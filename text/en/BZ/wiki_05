<text>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, generally referred to by its shortened title The Wealth of Nations, is the &quot;magnum opus&quot; of the Scottish economist and moral philosopher Adam Smith (1723–1790). First published in 1776, the book offers one of the world&#x27;s first connected accounts of what builds nations&#x27; wealth, and has become a fundamental work in classical economics. This is the first formulation of a comprehensive system of political economy. Reflecting upon economics at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, Smith addresses topics such as the division of labour, productivity, and free markets.

==History==
&quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; was published in two volumes on 9 March 1776 (with books I–III included in the first volume and books IV and V included in the second), during the Scottish Enlightenment and the Scottish Agricultural Revolution. It influenced several authors and economists, such as Karl Marx, as well as governments and organizations, setting the terms for economic debate and discussion for the next century and a half. For example, Alexander Hamilton was influenced in part by &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; to write his &quot;Report on Manufactures&quot;, in which he argued against many of Smith&#x27;s policies. Hamilton based much of this report on the ideas of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, and it was, in part, Colbert&#x27;s ideas that Smith responded to, and criticised, with &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;.

&quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; was the product of seventeen years of notes and earlier studies, as well as an observation of conversation among economists of the time (like Nicholas Magens) concerning economic and societal conditions during the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and it took Smith some ten years to produce. The result was a treatise which sought to offer a practical application for reformed economic theory to replace the mercantilist and physiocratic economic theories that were becoming less relevant in the time of industrial progress and innovation. It provided the foundation for economists, politicians, mathematicians, and thinkers of all fields to build upon. Irrespective of historical influence, &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; represented a clear paradigm shift in the field of economics, comparable to what Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; was for philosophy.
Five editions of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; were published during Smith&#x27;s lifetime: in 1776, 1778, 1784, 1786 and 1789. Numerous editions appeared after Smith&#x27;s death in 1790. To better understand the evolution of the work under Smith&#x27;s hand, a team led by Edwin Cannan collated the first five editions. The differences were published along with an edited sixth edition in 1904. They found minor but numerous differences (including the addition of many footnotes) between the first and the second editions; the differences between the second and third editions are major. In 1784, Smith annexed these first two editions with the publication of &quot;Additions and Corrections to the First and Second Editions of Dr. Adam Smith&#x27;s Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations&quot;, and he also had published the three-volume third edition of the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;, which incorporated &quot;Additions and Corrections&quot; and, for the first time, an index. Among other things, the &quot;Additions and Corrections&quot; included entirely new sections, particularly to book 4, chapters 4 and 5, and to book 5, chapter 1, as well as an additional chapter (8), &quot;Conclusion of the Mercantile System&quot;, in book 4.

The fourth edition, published in 1786, had only slight differences from the third edition, and Smith himself says in the &quot;Advertisement&quot; at the beginning of the book, &quot;I have made no alterations of any kind.&quot; Finally, Cannan notes only trivial differences between the fourth and fifth editions—a set of misprints being removed from the fourth and a different set of misprints being introduced.

==Synopsis==

===Book I: Of the Causes of Improvement in the productive Powers of Labour===
Of the Division of Labour: Division of labour has caused a greater increase in production than any other factor. This diversification is greatest for nations with more industry and improvement, and is responsible for &quot;universal opulence&quot; in those countries. This is in part due to increased quality of production, but more importantly because of increased efficiency of production, leading to a higher nominal output of units produced per time unit. Agriculture is less amenable than manufacturing to division of labour; hence, rich nations are not so far ahead of poor nations in agriculture as in manufacturing.

Of the Principle which gives Occasion to the Division of Labour: Division of labour arises not from innate wisdom, but from humans&#x27; propensity to barter.

That the Division of Labour is Limited by the Extent of the Market: Limited opportunity for exchange discourages division of labour. Because &quot;water-carriage&quot; (i.e. transportation) extends the market, division of labour, with its improvements, comes earliest to cities near waterways. Civilization began around the highly navigable Mediterranean Sea.

Of the Origin and Use of Money: With division of labour, the produce of one&#x27;s own labour can fill only a small part of one&#x27;s needs. Different commodities have served as a common medium of exchange, but all nations have finally settled on metals, which are durable and divisible, for this purpose. Before coinage, people had to weigh and assay with each exchange, or risk &quot;the grossest frauds and impositions.&quot; Thus nations began stamping metal, on one side only, to ascertain purity, or on all sides, to stipulate purity and amount. The quantity of real metal in coins has diminished, due to the &quot;avarice and injustice of princes and sovereign states,&quot; enabling them to pay their debts in appearance only, and to the defraudment of creditors.

Of the Wages of Labour: In this section, Smith describes how the wages of labour are dictated primarily by the competition among labourers and masters. When labourers bid against one another for limited employment opportunities, the wages of labour collectively fall, whereas when employers compete against one another for limited supplies of labour, the wages of labour collectively rise. However, this process of competition is often circumvented by combinations among labourers and among masters. When labourers combine and no longer bid against one another, their wages rise, whereas when masters combine, wages fall. In Smith&#x27;s day, organised labour was dealt with very harshly by the law.

Smith himself wrote about the &quot;severity&quot; of such laws against worker actions, and made a point to contrast the &quot;clamour&quot; of the &quot;masters&quot; against workers&#x27; associations, while associations and collusions of the masters &quot;are never heard by the people&quot; though such actions are &quot;always&quot; and &quot;everywhere&quot; taking place:

 &quot;We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform, combination, not to raise the wages of labour above their actual rate [...] Masters, too, sometimes enter into particular combinations to sink the wages of labour even below this rate. These are always conducted with the utmost silence and secrecy till the moment of execution; and when the workmen yield, as they sometimes do without resistance, though severely felt by them, they are never heard of by other people&quot;. In contrast, when workers combine, &quot;the masters [...] never cease to call aloud for the assistance of the civil magistrate, and the rigorous execution of those laws which have been enacted with so much severity against the combination of servants, labourers, and journeymen.&quot;

In societies where the amount of labour exceeds the amount of revenue available for waged labour, competition among workers is greater than the competition among employers, and wages fall. Conversely, where revenue is abundant, labour wages rise. Smith argues that, therefore, labour wages only rise as a result of greater revenue disposed to pay for labour. Smith thought of labour as being like any other commodity in this respect:

However, the amount of revenue must increase constantly in proportion to the amount of labour for wages to remain high. Smith illustrates this by juxtaposing England with the North American colonies. In England, there is more revenue than in the colonies, but wages are lower, because more workers flock to new employment opportunities caused by the large amount of revenue – so workers eventually compete against each other as much as they did before. By contrast, as capital continues to flow to the colonial economies at least at the same rate that population increases to &quot;fill out&quot; this excess capital, wages there stay higher than in England.

Smith was highly concerned about the problems of poverty. He writes:

The only way to determine whether a man is rich or poor is to examine the amount of labour he can afford to purchase.
&quot;Labour is the real exchange for commodities&quot;.

Smith also describes the relation of cheap years and the production of manufactures versus the production in dear years. He argues that while some examples, such as the linen production in France, show a correlation, another example in Scotland shows the opposite. He concludes that there are too many variables to make any statement about this.

Of the Profits of Stock: In this chapter, Smith uses interest rates as an indicator of the profits of stock. This is because interest can only be paid with the profits of stock, and so creditors will be able to raise rates in proportion to the increase or decrease of the profits of their debtors.

Smith argues that the profits of stock are inversely proportional to the wages of labour, because as more money is spent compensating labour, there is less remaining for personal profit. It follows that, in societies where competition among labourers is greatest relative to competition among employers, profits will be much higher. Smith illustrates this by comparing interest rates in England and Scotland. In England, government laws against usury had kept maximum interest rates very low, but even the maximum rate was believed to be higher than the rate at which money was usually loaned. In Scotland, however, interest rates are much higher. This is the result of a greater proportion of capitalists in England, which offsets some competition among labourers and raises wages.

However, Smith notes that, curiously, interest rates in the colonies are also remarkably high (recall that, in the previous chapter, Smith described how wages in the colonies are higher than in England). Smith attributes this to the fact that, when an empire takes control of a colony, prices for a huge abundance of land and resources are extremely cheap. This allows capitalists to increase their profits, but simultaneously draws many capitalists to the colonies, increasing the wages of labour. As this is done, however, the profits of stock in the mother country rise (or at least cease to fall), as much of it has already flocked offshore.

Of Wages and Profit in the Different Employments of Labour and Stock: Smith repeatedly attacks groups of politically aligned individuals who attempt to use their collective influence to manipulate the government into doing their bidding. At the time, these were referred to as &quot;factions&quot;, but are now more commonly called &quot;special interests,&quot; a term that can comprise international bankers, corporate conglomerations, outright oligopolies, trade unions and other groups. Indeed, Smith had a particular distrust of the tradesman class. He felt that the members of this class, especially acting together within the guilds they want to form, could constitute a power block and manipulate the state into regulating for special interests against the general interest:

Smith also argues against government subsidies of certain trades, because this will draw many more people to the trade than what would otherwise be normal, collectively lowering their wages.

Of the Rent of the Land: Chapter 10, part ii, motivates an understanding of the idea of feudalism. Rent, considered as the price paid for the use of land, is naturally the highest the tenant can afford in the actual circumstances of the land. In adjusting lease terms, the landlord endeavours to leave him no greater share of the produce than what is sufficient to keep up the stock from which he furnishes the seed, pays the labour, and purchases and maintains the cattle and other instruments of husbandry, together with the ordinary profits of farming stock in the neighbourhood.

This is evidently the smallest share with which the tenant can content himself without being a loser, and the landlord seldom means to leave him any more. Whatever part of the produce, or, what is the same thing, whatever part of its price, is over and above this share, he naturally endeavours to reserve to himself as the rent of his land, which is evidently the highest the tenant can afford to pay in the actual circumstances of the land. Sometimes, indeed, the liberality, more frequently the ignorance, of the landlord, makes him accept of somewhat less than this portion; and sometimes too, though more rarely, the ignorance of the tenant makes him undertake to pay somewhat more, or to content himself with somewhat less, than the ordinary profits of farming stock in the neighbourhood. This portion, however, may still be considered as the natural rent of land, or the rent for which it is naturally meant that land should for the most part be let.

===Book II: Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock===
Of the Division of Stock:
When the stock which a man possesses is no more than sufficient to maintain him for a few days or a few weeks, he seldom thinks of deriving any revenue from it. He consumes it as sparingly as he can, and endeavours by his labour to acquire something which may supply its place before it be consumed altogether. His revenue is, in this case, derived from his labour only. This is the state of the greater part of the labouring poor in all countries.

But when he possesses stock sufficient to maintain him for months or years, he naturally endeavours to derive a revenue from the greater part of it; reserving only so much for his immediate consumption as may maintain him till this revenue begins to come in. His whole stock, therefore, is distinguished into two parts. That part which, he expects, is to afford him this revenue, is called his capital.Of Money Considered as a particular Branch of the General Stock of the Society:

===Book III: Of the different Progress of Opulence in different Nations===
==== Long-term economic growth ====
Adam Smith uses this example to address long-term economic growth. Smith states, &quot;As subsistence is, in the nature of things, prior to conveniency and luxury, so the industry which procures the former, must necessarily be prior to that which ministers to the latter&quot;. In order for industrial success, subsistence is required first from the countryside. Industry and trade occur in cities while agriculture occurs in the countryside.

==== Agricultural jobs ====
Agricultural work is a more desirable situation than industrial work because the owner is in complete control. Smith states that: In our North American colonies, where uncultivated land is still to be had upon easy terms, no manufactures for distant sale have ever yet been established in any of their towns. When an artificer has acquired a little more stock than is necessary for carrying on his own business in supplying the neighbouring country, he does not, in North America, attempt to establish with it a manufacture for more distant sale, but employs it in the purchase and improvement of uncultivated land. From artificer he becomes planter, and neither the large wages nor the easy subsistence which that country affords to artificers, can bribe him rather to work for other people than for himself. He feels that an artificer is the servant of his customers, from whom he derives his subsistence; but that a planter who cultivates his own land, and derives his necessary subsistence from the labour of his own family, is really a master, and independent of all the world. Where there is open countryside agriculture is much preferable to industrial occupations and ownership.

Adam Smith goes on to say &quot;According to the natural course of things, therefore, the greater part of the capital of every growing society is, first, directed to agriculture, afterwards to manufactures, and last of all to foreign commerce&quot;. This sequence leads to growth, and therefore opulence.

Of the Discouragement of Agriculture: Chapter 2&#x27;s long title is &quot;Of the Discouragement of Agriculture in the Ancient State of Europe after the Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;.

Of the Rise and Progress of Cities and Towns, after the Fall of the Roman Empire:

How the Commerce of the Towns Contributed to the Improvement of the Country: Smith often harshly criticised those who act purely out of self-interest and greed, and warns that,

...[a]ll for ourselves, and nothing for other people, seems, in every age of the world, to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind.

===Book IV: Of Systems of political Economy===
Smith vigorously attacked the antiquated government restrictions he thought hindered industrial expansion. In fact, he attacked most forms of government interference in the economic process, including tariffs, arguing that this creates inefficiency and high prices in the long run. It is believed that this theory influenced government legislation in later years, especially during the 19th century.

Smith advocated a government that was active in sectors other than the economy. He advocated public education for poor adults, a judiciary, and a standing army—institutional systems not directly profitable for private industries.

Of the Principle of the Commercial or Mercantile System: The book has sometimes been described as a critique of mercantilism and a synthesis of the emerging economic thinking of Smith&#x27;s time. Specifically, &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; attacks, &quot;inter alia&quot;, two major tenets of mercantilism:
# The idea that protectionist tariffs serve the economic interests of a nation (or indeed any purpose whatsoever) and
# The idea that large reserves of gold bullion or other precious metals are necessary for a country&#x27;s economic success. This critique of mercantilism was later used by David Ricardo when he laid out his Theory of Comparative Advantage.

Of Restraints upon the Importation: Chapter 2&#x27;s full title is &quot;Of Restraints upon the Importation from Foreign Countries of such Goods as can be Produced at Home&quot;. The &quot;invisible hand&quot; is a frequently referenced theme from the book, although it is specifically mentioned only once.

The metaphor of the &quot;invisible hand&quot; has been widely used out of context. In the passage above Smith is referring to &quot;the support of domestic industry&quot; and contrasting that support with the importation of goods. Neoclassical economic theory has expanded the metaphor beyond the domestic/foreign manufacture argument to encompass nearly all aspects of economics.

Of the extraordinary Restraints: Chapter 3&#x27;s long title is &quot;Of the extraordinary Restraints upon the Importation of Goods of almost all Kinds, from those Countries with which the Balance is supposed to be Disadvantageous&quot;.

Of Drawbacks: Merchants and manufacturers are not contented with the monopoly of the home market, but desire likewise the most extensive foreign sale for their goods. Their country has no jurisdiction in foreign nations, and therefore can seldom procure them any monopoly there. They are generally obliged, therefore, to content themselves with petitioning for certain encouragements to exportation.

Of these encouragements what are called Drawbacks seem to be the most reasonable. To allow the merchant to draw back upon exportation, either the whole or a part of whatever excise or inland duty is imposed upon domestic industry, can never occasion the exportation of a greater quantity of goods than what would have been exported had no duty been imposed. Such encouragements do not tend to turn towards any particular employment a greater share of the capital of the country than what would go to that employment of its own accord, but only to hinder the duty from driving away any part of that shares to other employments.

Of Bounties: Bounties upon exportation are, in Great Britain, frequently petitioned for, and sometimes granted to the produce of particular branches of domestic industry. By means of them our merchants and manufacturers, it is pretended, will be enabled to sell their goods as cheap, or cheaper than their rivals in the foreign market. A greater quantity, it is said, will thus be exported, and the balance of trade consequently turned more in favour of our own country. We cannot give our workmen a monopoly in the foreign as we have done in the home market. We cannot force foreigners to buy their goods as we have done our own countrymen. The next best expedient, it has been thought, therefore, is to pay them for buying. It is in this manner that the mercantile system proposes to enrich the whole country, and to put money into all our pockets by means of the balance of trade.

Conclusion of the Mercantile System: Smith&#x27;s argument about the international political economy opposed the idea of mercantilism. While the Mercantile System encouraged each country to hoard gold, while trying to grasp hegemony, Smith argued that free trade eventually makes all actors better off. This argument is the modern &#x27;Free Trade&#x27; argument.

Of the Agricultural Systems: Chapter 9&#x27;s long title is &quot;Of the Agricultural Systems, or of those Systems of Political Economy, which Represent the Produce of Land, as either the Sole or the Principal, Source of the Revenue and Wealth of Every Country&quot;.

===Book V: Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth===
Smith postulated four &quot;maxims&quot; of taxation: proportionality, transparency, convenience, and efficiency. Some economists interpret Smith&#x27;s opposition to taxes on transfers of money, such as the Stamp Act, as opposition to capital gains taxes, which did not exist in the 18th century. Other economists credit Smith as one of the first to advocate a progressive tax. Smith wrote, &quot;The necessaries of life occasion the great expense of the poor. They find it difficult to get food, and the greater part of their little revenue is spent in getting it. The luxuries and vanities of life occasion the principal expense of the rich, and a magnificent house embellishes and sets off to the best advantage all the other luxuries and vanities which they possess. A tax upon house-rents, therefore, would in general fall heaviest upon the rich; and in this sort of inequality there would not, perhaps, be anything very unreasonable. It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion.&quot; Smith believed that an even &quot;more proper&quot; source of progressive taxation than property taxes was ground rent. Smith wrote that &quot;nothing [could] be more reasonable&quot; than a land value tax.

Of the Expenses of the Sovereign or Commonwealth: Smith uses this chapter to comment on the concept of taxation and expenditure by the state. On taxation, Smith wrote,

Smith advocates a tax naturally attached to the &quot;abilities&quot; and habits of each echelon of society.

For the lower echelon, Smith recognised the intellectually erosive effect that the otherwise beneficial division of labour can have on workers, what Marx, though he mainly opposes Smith, later named &quot;alienation&quot;; therefore, Smith warns of the consequence of government failing to fulfill its proper role, which is to preserve against the innate tendency of human society to fall apart.

Under Smith&#x27;s model, government involvement in any area other than those stated above negatively impacts economic growth. This is because economic growth is determined by the needs of a free market and the entrepreneurial nature of private persons. A shortage of a product makes its price rise, and so stimulates producers to produce more and attracts new people to that line of production. An excess supply of a product (more of the product than people are willing to buy) drives prices down, and producers refocus energy and money to other areas where there is a need.

Of the Sources of the General or Public Revenue of the Society: In his discussion of taxes in Book Five, Smith wrote:

He also introduced the distinction between a &quot;direct tax&quot;, and by implication an &quot;indirect tax&quot; (although he did not use the word &quot;indirect&quot;):

And further:

This term was later used in United States, Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution, and James Madison, who wrote much of the Constitution, is known to have read Smith&#x27;s book.

Of War and Public Debts:
Smith then goes on to say that even if money was set aside from future revenues to pay for the debts of war, it seldom actually gets used to pay down the debt. Politicians are inclined to spend the money on some other scheme that will win the favour of their constituents. Hence, interest payments rise and war debts continue to grow larger, well beyond the end of the war.

Summing up, if governments can borrow without check, then they are more likely to wage war without check, and the costs of the war spending will burden future generations, since war debts are almost never repaid by the generations that incurred them.

==Reception and impact==
===Greater Britain===
====Intellectuals, critics, and reviewers====

The first edition of the book sold out in six months. The printer William Strahan wrote on 12 April 1776 that David Hume said &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; required too much thought to be as popular as Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;. Strahan also wrote: &quot;What you say of Mr. Gibbon&#x27;s and Dr. Smith&#x27;s book is exactly just. The former is the most popular work; but the sale of the latter, though not near so rapid, has been more than I could have expected from a work that requires much thought and reflection (qualities that do not abound among modern readers) to peruse to any purpose.&quot; Gibbon wrote to Adam Ferguson on 1 April: &quot;What an excellent work is that with which our common friend Mr. Adam Smith has enriched the public! An extensive science in a single book, and the most profound ideas expressed in the most perspicuous language&quot;. The review of the book in the &quot;Annual Register&quot; was probably written by Whig MP Edmund Burke. In 1791, the English-born radical Thomas Paine wrote in his &quot;Rights of Man&quot; that &quot;Had Mr. Burke possessed talents similar to the author &#x27;On the Wealth of Nations,&#x27; he would have comprehended all the parts which enter into, and, by assemblage, form a constitution.&quot;

In 1800, the &quot;Anti-Jacobin Review&quot; criticized &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. In 1803, &quot;The Times&quot; argued against war with Spain: She is our best customer; and by the gentle and peaceable stream of commerce, the treasures of the new world flow with greater certainty into English reservoirs, than it could do by the most successful warfare. They come in this way to support our manufactures, to encourage industry, to feed our poor, to pay taxes, to reward ingenuity, to diffuse riches among all classes of people. But for the full understanding of this beneficial circulation of wealth, we must refer to Dr. Adam Smith&#x27;s incomparable &quot;Treatise on the Wealth of Nations&quot;. In 1810, a correspondent writing under the pseudonym of Publicola included at the head of his letter Smith&#x27;s line that &quot;Exclusive Companies are &quot;nuisances&quot; in every respect&quot; and called him &quot;that learned writer&quot;. In 1812, Robert Southey of the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; condemned &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; as a &quot;tedious and hard-hearted book&quot;. In 1821, &quot;The Times&quot; quoted Smith&#x27;s opinion that the interests of corn dealers and the people were the same. In 1826, the English radical William Cobbett criticised in his &quot;Rural Rides&quot; the political economists&#x27; hostility to the Poor Law: &quot;Well, amidst all this suffering, there is one good thing; the Scotch political economy is blown to the devil, and the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; and Adam Smith along with it&quot;. In 1829, Thomas Carlyle named Smith as one of the philosophers of the age who taught that &quot;our happiness depends entirely on external circumstances&quot; and to whose eye &quot;all is well that works quietly.&quot;

The Liberal statesman William Ewart Gladstone chaired the meeting of the Political Economy Club to celebrate the centenary of the publication of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;. The Liberal historian Lord Acton believed that &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; gave a &quot;scientific backbone to liberal sentiment&quot; and that it was the &quot;classic English philosophy of history&quot;.

====Public policy====
Smith&#x27;s biographer John Rae contended that &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; shaped government policy soon after it was published.

=====18th century=====
In 1777, in the first budget after the book was published, Prime Minister Lord North got the idea for two new taxes from the book: one on man-servants and the other on property sold at auction. The budget of 1778 introduced the inhabited house duty and the malt tax, both recommended by Smith. In 1779, Smith was consulted by politicians Henry Dundas and Lord Carlisle on the subject of giving Ireland free trade.
&quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; was first mentioned in Parliament by the Whig leader Charles James Fox on 11 November 1783: There was a maxim laid down in an excellent book upon the Wealth of Nations which had been ridiculed for its simplicity, but which was indisputable as to its truth. In that book it was stated that the only way to become rich was to manage matters so as to make one&#x27;s income exceed one&#x27;s expenses. This maxim applied equally to an individual and to a nation. The proper line of conduct therefore was by a well-directed economy to retrench every current expense, and to make as large a saving during the peace as possible. However Fox once told Charles Butler sometime after 1785 that he had never read the book and that &quot;There is something in all these subjects which passes my comprehension; something so wide that I could never embrace them myself nor find any one who did.&quot; When Fox was dining with Lord Lauderdale in 1796, Lauderdale remarked that they knew nothing of political economy before Adam Smith wrote. &quot;Pooh,&quot; replied Fox, &quot;your Adam Smiths are nothing, but&quot; (he added, turning to the company) &quot;that is his love; we must spare him there.&quot; Lauderdale replied: &quot;I think he is everything&quot;, to which Fox rejoined: &quot;That is a great proof of your affection&quot;. Fox also found Adam Smith &quot;tedious&quot; and believed that one half of &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; could be &quot;omitted with much benefit to the subject&quot;.

&quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; was next mentioned in Parliament by Robert Thornton MP in 1787 to support the Commercial Treaty with France. In the same year George Dempster MP referenced it in the debate on the proposal to farm the post-horse duties and in 1788 by a Mr. Hussy on the Wool Exportation Bill.

The prime minister, William Pitt, praised Smith in the House of Commons on 17 February 1792: &quot;…an author of our own times now unfortunately no more (I mean the author of a celebrated treatise &quot;on the Wealth of Nations&quot;), whose extensive knowledge of detail, and depth of philosophical research will, I believe, furnish the best solution to every question connected with the history of commerce, or with the systems of political economy.&quot; In the same year it was quoted by Samuel Whitbread MP and Fox (on the division of labour) in the debate on the armament against Russia and also by William Wilberforce in introducing his Bill against the slave trade. The book was not mentioned in the House of Lords until a debate in 1793 between Lord Lansdowne and Lord Loughborough about revolutionary principles in France. On 16 May 1797, Pitt said in the debate on the suspension of cash payments by the Bank of England that Smith was &quot;that great author&quot; but his arguments, &quot;though always ingenious&quot;, were &quot;sometimes injudicious&quot;. In 1798, Sir John Mitford, the Solicitor-General, cited the book in his criticism of bills of exchange given in consideration of other bills.

During a debate on the price of corn in 1800 Lord Warwick said: There was hardly any kind of property on which the law did not impose some restraints and regulations with regard to the sale of them, except that of provisions. This was probably done on the principles laid down by a celebrated and able writer, Doctor Adam Smith, who had maintained that every thing ought to be left to its own level. He knew something of that Gentleman, whose heart he knew was as sound as his head; and he was sure that had he lived to this day and beheld the novel state of wretchedness to which the country was now reduced ...; that Great Man would have reason to blush for some of the doctrines he had laid down. He would now have abundant opportunities of observing that all those artificial means of enhancing the price of provisions, which he had considered as no way mischievous, were practised at this time to a most alarming extent. He would see the Farmer keeping up his produce while the poor were labouring under all the miseries of want, and he would see Forestallers, Regraters, and all kinds of Middle-men making large profits upon it. Lord Grenville replied: [W]hen that great man lived, ... his book was first published at a period, previous to which there had been two or three seasons of great dearth and distress; and during those seasons there were speculators without number, who ... proposed that a certain price should be fixed on every article: but all their plans were wisely rejected, and the &quot;Treatise on the Wealth of Nations&quot;, which came forward soon after, pointed out in the clearest light how absurd and futile they must have been.

=====19th century=====

The Radical MP Richard Cobden studied &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; as a young man; his copy is still in the library of his home at Dunford House and there are marginal notes on the places where Smith criticizes British colonial policies. There are none on the passage about the invisible hand. Cobden campaigned for free trade in his agitation against the Corn Laws. In 1843, Cobden quoted Smith&#x27;s protest against the &quot;plain violation of the most sacred property&quot; of every man derived from his labour. In 1844, he cited Smith&#x27;s opposition to slave labour and claimed that Smith had been misrepresented by protectionists as a monopolist. In 1849, Cobden claimed that he had &quot;gone through the length and breadth of this country, with Adam Smith in my hand, to advocate the principles of Free Trade.&quot; He also said he had tried &quot;to popularise to the people of this country, and of the Continent, those arguments with which Adam Smith ... and every man who has written on this subject, have demonstrated the funding system to be injurious to mankind.&quot;

Cobden believed it to be morally wrong to lend money to be spent on war. In 1849, when &quot;The Times&quot; claimed political economists were against Cobden on this, Cobden wrote: &quot;I can quote Adam Smith whose authority is without appeal now in intellectual circles, it gives one the basis of science upon which to raise appeals to the moral feelings.&quot; In 1850, when the Russian government attempted to raise a loan to cover the deficit brought about by its war against Hungary, Cobden said: &quot;I take my stand on one of the strongest grounds in stating that Adam Smith and other great authorities on political economy are opposed to the very principle of such loans.&quot; In 1863, during Cobden&#x27;s dispute with &quot;The Times&quot; over its claims that his fellow Radical John Bright wanted to divide the land of the rich amongst the poor, Cobden read to a friend the passage in the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; which criticized primogeniture and entail. Cobden said that if Bright had been as plain-speaking as Smith, &quot;how he would have been branded as an incendiary and Socialist&quot;. In 1864, Cobden proclaimed, &quot;If I were five-and-twenty or thirty, ... I would take Adam Smith in hand, and I would have a League for free trade in Land just as we had a League for free trade in Corn. You will find just the same authority in Adam Smith for the one as for the other.&quot;

===United States===
After the conquest of New France in 1760 during the French and Indian War, Charles Townshend suggested that the American colonists provide help to pay for the war debt by paying an additional tax on tea. During this time, Adam Smith was working for Townshend and developed a relationship with Benjamin Franklin, who played a vital role in the American Revolution three months after Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; book was released.

James Madison, in a speech given in Congress on 2 February 1791, cited &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; in opposing a national bank: &quot;The principal disadvantages consisted in, 1st. banishing the precious metals, by substituting another medium to perform their office: This effect was inevitable. It was admitted by the most enlightened patrons of banks, particularly by Smith on the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;.&quot; Thomas Jefferson, writing to John Norvell on 14 June 1807, claimed that on &quot;the subjects of money &amp; commerce, Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; is the best book to be read, unless &quot;Say&#x27;s Political Economy&quot; can be had, which treats the same subject on the same principles, but in a shorter compass &amp; more lucid manner.&quot;

===Translations===
&quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; was translated into French, German and Spanish in the late 18th century.
The French version by Germain Garnier was not the first to appear, but is regarded as better than earlier translations. In the 1840s Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui, a free trader, supplemented Garnier&#x27;s translation with notes and comments by the principal economists in Europe.

The Spanish Inquisition banned &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; in French translation, but José Alonso Ortiz was able to publish a virtually complete Spanish translation (although he appears to have self-censored the text as it relates to usury). This translation, which was dedicated to Manuel Godoy, has remained in print, although it has been modernised by later editors.

==Modern evaluation==
With 36,331 citations, it is the second most cited book in economics published before 1950, behind Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital&quot;.
George Stigler attributes to Smith &quot;the most important substantive proposition in all of economics&quot; and foundation of resource-allocation theory. It is that, under competition, owners of resources (labour, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in equilibrium for all uses (adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment). He also describes Smith&#x27;s theorem that &quot;the division of labour is limited by the extent of the market&quot; as the &quot;core of a theory of the functions of firm and industry&quot; and a &quot;fundamental principle of economic organisation.&quot;

Paul Samuelson finds in Smith&#x27;s pluralist use of supply and demand—as applied to wages, rents, and profit—a valid and valuable anticipation of the general equilibrium modelling of Walras a century later. Moreover, Smith&#x27;s allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention added a realism missed later by Malthus and Ricardo in their propounding a rigid subsistence-wage theory of labour supply.

In noting the last words of the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;,
Ronald Coase suggests that if Smith&#x27;s earlier proposal of granting colonies representation in the British parliament proportional to their contributions to public revenues had been followed, &quot;there would have been no 1776, … America would now be ruling England, and we [in America] would be today celebrating Adam Smith not simply as the author of the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;, but hailing him as a founding father.&quot;

Mark Blaug argues that it was Smith&#x27;s achievement to shift the burden of proof against those maintaining that the pursuit of self-interest does not achieve social good. But he notes Smith&#x27;s relevant attention to definite institutional arrangements and process as disciplining self-interest to widen the scope of the market, accumulate capital, and grow income.

Economic anthropologist David Graeber argues that throughout antiquity one can identify many different systems of credit and later monetary exchange, drawing evidence for his argument from historical and also ethnographical records, that the traditional explanation for the origins of monetary economies from primitive bartering systems, as laid out by Adam Smith, does not find empirical support. The author argues that credit systems developed as means of account long before the advent of coinage around 600 BCE, and can still be seen operating in non-monetary economies. The idea of barter, on the other hand, seems only to apply to limited exchanges between societies that had infrequent contact and often in a context of ritualised warfare, rendering its conceptualisation among economists as a myth. As an alternative explanation for the creation of economic life, the author suggests that it originally related to social currencies, closely related to non-market quotidian interactions among a community and based on the &quot;everyday communism&quot; that is based on mutual expectations and responsibilities among individuals. This type of economy is, then, contrasted with the moral foundations of exchange based on formal equality and reciprocity (but not necessarily leading to market relations) and hierarchy, based on clear inequalities that tend to crystallise in customs and castes.

<text>Blinking is a bodily function; it is a semi-autonomic rapid closing of the eyelid. A single blink is determined by the forceful closing of the eyelid or inactivation of the levator palpebrae superioris and the activation of the palpebral portion of the orbicularis oculi, not the full open and close. It is an essential function of the eye that helps spread tears across and remove irritants from the surface of the cornea and conjunctiva.

Blinking may have other functions since it occurs more often than necessary just to keep the eye lubricated. Researchers think blinking may help with disengagement of attention; following blink onset, cortical activity decreases in the dorsal network and increases in the default-mode network, associated with internal processing. Blink speed can be affected by elements such as fatigue, eye injury, medication, and disease. The blinking rate is determined by the &quot;blinking center&quot;, but it can also be affected by external stimulus.

Some animals, such as tortoises and hamsters, blink their eyes independently of each other. Humans use winking, the blinking of only one eye, as a form of body language.

Blinking provides moisture to the eye by irrigation using tears and a lubricant the eyes secrete. The eyelid provides suction across the eye from the tear duct to the entire eyeball to keep it from drying out.

Blinking also protects the eye from irritants. Eyelashes are hairs which grow from the edges of the upper and lower eyelids that create a line of defense against dust and other elements to the eye. The eyelashes catch most of these irritants before they reach the eyeball.

There are multiple muscles that control reflexes of blinking. The main muscles, in the upper eyelid, that control the opening and closing are the orbicularis oculi and levator palpebrae superioris muscle. The orbicularis oculi closes the eye, while the contraction of the levator palpebrae muscle opens the eye. The Müller&#x27;s muscle, or the superior tarsal muscle, in the upper eyelid and the inferior palpebral muscle in the lower 3 eyelid are responsible for widening the eyes. These muscles are not only imperative in blinking, but they are also important in many other functions such as squinting and winking. The inferior palpebral muscle is coordinated with the inferior rectus to pull down the lower lid when one looks down.

The correlation between human eyelid blink behavior and psychological stress was also demonstrated by means of a laboratory study. Lying may affect the rate of blinking. 

Blinking is used for communication in humans, some primates, in human interactions with cats, and by female concave-eared torrent frogs to initiate mating with males. 

===Central nervous system&#x27;s control===
Though one may think that the stimulus triggering blinking is dry or irritated eyes, it is most likely that it is controlled by a &quot;blinking center&quot; of the globus pallidus of the lenticular nucleus—a body of nerve cells between the base and outer surface of the brain. Nevertheless, external stimuli can contribute. The orbicularis oculi is a facial muscle; therefore its actions are translated by the facial nerve root. The levator palpebrae superioris&#x27; action is sent through the oculomotor nerve. The duration of a blink is
on average 100–150 milliseconds according to UCL researcher and between 100 and 400 ms according to the Harvard Database of Useful Biological Numbers. Closures in excess of 1000 ms were defined as microsleeps.

Greater activation of dopaminergic pathways dopamine production in the striatum is associated with a higher rate of spontaneous eye blinking. Conditions in which there is reduced dopamine availability such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease have reduced eye blink rate, while conditions in which it is raised such as schizophrenia have an increased rate. Blink rate is associated with dopamine-related executive function and creativity.

===Evolutionary origins===
Blinking is present in all major tetrapod crown groups. The soft tissues involved in blinking have not been preserved in the fossil record, but study of mudskippers (a group of amphibious fish species that evolved blinking independently from other tetrapod species, but for similar purposes), suggest that blinking (which involves the eye retracting in mudskippers) may have arose in response to selective pressures upon species shifting from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. For example, compared to an aquatic environment, in a terrestrial environment, the corneal cells must be kept moist such that vital substances like oxygen can more easily diffuse into them, detritus may adhere to the eye in dry conditions, and objects may move towards the eye at faster and more dangerous speeds in air than in water. Additionally, when at their fully aquatic juvenile stage of development, their eyes are not in the positioning with which they blink, but as adults, their eyes elevate to a position that can blink, which they do when they are not submerged or bump into a surface, suggesting blinking emerged as an adaptation to terrestrial life as opposed to aquatic life.

Early tetrapods in the transition to land, which would later yield all non-mudskipper blinking species, possessed similar characteristics regarding eye positioning that suggest blinking arose in response to aerial vision and terrestrial lifestyle.

==Types of blinking==
There are three types of blinking.

===Spontaneous blink===
Spontaneous blinking is done without external stimuli and internal effort. This type of blinking is conducted in the pre-motor brain stem and happens without conscious effort, like breathing and digestion.

===Reflex blink===
A reflex blink occurs in response to an external stimulus, such as contact with the cornea or objects that appear rapidly in front of the eye. A reflex blink is not necessarily a conscious blink either; however it does happen faster than a spontaneous blink. Reflex blink may occur in response to tactile stimuli (e.g., corneal, eyelash, skin of eyelid, contact with eyebrow), optical stimuli (e.g. dazzle reflex, or menace reflex) or auditory stimuli (e.g., menace reflex).

===Voluntary blink===
A voluntary blink is a conscious blink, with the use of all 3 divisions of the orbicularis oculi muscle.

==Blinking in everyday life==

===Children===
Infants do not blink at the same rate of adults; in fact, infants only blink at an average rate of one or two times in a minute. The reason for this difference is unknown, but it is suggested that infants do not require the same amount of eye lubrication that adults do because their eyelid opening is smaller in relation to adults. Additionally, infants do not produce tears during their first month of life. Infants also get a significant amount more sleep than adults do and, as discussed earlier, fatigued eyes blink more. However, throughout childhood the blink rate increases, and by adolescence, it is usually equivalent to that of adults.

===Adults===
There have been mixed results when studying gender-dependent differences in blinking rates, with results varying from the women&#x27;s rate nearly doubling the men&#x27;s to no significant difference between them. In addition, women using oral contraceptives blink 32% more often than other women on average for unknown reasons. Generally, between each blink is an interval of 2–10 seconds; actual rates vary by individual, averaging around 17 blinks per minute in a laboratory setting. However, when the eyes are focused on an object for an extended period of time, such as when reading, the rate of blinking decreases to about 4 to 5 times per minute. This is the major reason that eyes dry out and become fatigued when reading.

When the eyes dry out or become fatigued due to reading on a computer screen, it can be an indication of computer vision syndrome. Computer vision syndrome can be prevented by taking regular breaks, focusing on objects far from the screen, having a well-lit workplace, or using a blink reminder application. Studies suggest that adults can learn to maintain a healthy blinking rate while reading or looking at a computer screen using biofeedback.

Eye blinking can be a criterion for diagnosing medical conditions. For example, excessive blinking may help to indicate the onset of Tourette syndrome, strokes or disorders of the nervous system. A reduced rate of blinking is associated with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>A glovebox (or glove box) is a sealed container that is designed to allow one to manipulate objects where a separate atmosphere is desired. Built into the sides of the glovebox are gloves arranged in such a way that the user can place their hands into the gloves and perform tasks inside the box without breaking containment. Part or all of the box is usually transparent to allow the user to see what is being manipulated. A smaller antechamber compartment is used to transport items into or out of the main chamber without compromising the internal environment. Antechambers are much smaller than the main chambers so they can be exposed to ambient conditions more often and achieve inert conditions quickly.

Two types of gloveboxes exist. The first allows a person to work with hazardous substances, such as radioactive materials or infectious disease agents, and the second allows manipulation of substances that must be contained within a very high purity inert atmosphere, such as argon or nitrogen. It is also possible to use a glovebox for manipulation of items in a vacuum chamber.
== Inert atmosphere work ==
The gas in a glovebox is pumped through a series of treatment devices which remove solvents, water and oxygen from the gas. Copper metal (or some other finely divided metal) is commonly used to remove oxygen, this oxygen removing column is normally regenerated by passing a hydrogen/nitrogen mixture through it while it is heated: the water formed is passed out of the box with the excess hydrogen and nitrogen. It is common to use molecular sieves to remove water by absorbing it in the molecular sieves&#x27; pores. Such a box is often used by organometallic chemists to transfer dry solids from one container to another container.

An alternative to using a glovebox for air sensitive work is to employ Schlenk methods using a Schlenk line. One disadvantage of working in a glovebox is that organic solvents will attack the plastic seals. As a result, the box will start to leak and water and oxygen can then enter the box. Another disadvantage of a glovebox is that oxygen and water can diffuse through the plastic gloves. Also, coordinating solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran and dichloromethane, can bind irreversibly to the copper catalyst, reducing its effectiveness. One way to prolong the lifespan of the glovebox and catalyst is to turn off circulation when using solvents, followed by purging when work involving solvents is finished.

Inert atmosphere gloveboxes are typically kept at a higher pressure than the surrounding air, so that any microscopic leaks are mostly leaking inert gas out of the box instead of letting air in.

== Hazardous materials work ==
At the now-deactivated Rocky Flats Plant, which manufactured plutonium triggers, also called &quot;pits&quot;, production facilities consisted of linked stainless steel gloveboxes up to 64 feet, or 20 meters, in length, which contained the equipment which forged and machined the trigger parts. The gloves were lead-lined. Other materials used in the gloveboxes included acrylic viewing windows and Benelex shielding composed of wood fiber and plastic which shielded against neutron radiation. Manipulation of the lead-lined gloves was onerous work.

Some gloveboxes for radioactive work are under inert conditions, for instance, one nitrogen-filled box contains an argon-filled box. The argon box is fitted with a gas treatment system to keep the gas very pure to enable electrochemical experiments in molten salts.

Gloveboxes are also used in the biological sciences when dealing with anaerobes or high-biosafety level pathogens.

Gloveboxes used for hazardous materials are generally maintained at a lower pressure than the surrounding atmosphere, so that microscopic leaks result in air intake rather than hazard outflow. Gloveboxes used for hazardous materials generally incorporate HEPA filters into the exhaust, to keep the hazard contained.

<doc id="725999" wikidata="Q1415117" url="?curid=725999" title="Glove compartment">
<text>A glove compartment or glove box is a compartment built into the dashboard of an automobile, located over the front-seat passenger&#x27;s footwell, and often used for miscellaneous storage. The name derives from the original purpose of the compartment, to store driving gloves. They were sometimes in a box on the floorboard near the driver, hence the phrase &quot;glove box&quot;. In most vehicles, the glove compartment closes with a latch, with the option of being locked with a key (often desirable when using valet service, when parking with the convertible top down, or when the compartment contains a mechanism to open the trunk).

==History==
An early innovation was the addition of a storage compartment on the front or dashboard of the 1900 Packard.

Driving gloves were considered necessary equipment in early cars, many of which were mostly open to the weather, to prevent the cooling effect of fast-moving air from numbing drivers&#x27; hands. Gloves are still considered necessary equipment on motorcycles for the same reason, although, unlike cars, most motorcycles do not have glove boxes.

According to the BBC Four program &quot;Penelope Keith and the Fast Lady (Aaron Syer)&quot;, Dorothy Levitt first coined the phrase &quot;glove compartment&quot; as she advised motorists to carry a number of pairs of gloves to deal with many eventualities.

In some vehicles, the inside of the compartment&#x27;s door may have an indented area for cups or beverage containers when open. These were for use while at a drive-in while the car was stationary, not in the modern applications of cup holders. Some glove compartments have sections for holding a pen or pencil. There were storage compartments on the backs of the seats to hold a woman&#x27;s bag or rain apparel in the 1955 and 1956 Dodge La Femme. The 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham featured a cocktail set with magnetized cups in its dashboard compartment.

In some newer cars, the glove compartment may be temperature-controlled, so that it can be used as a cooler for beverages such as on the Dodge Caliber. Some cars now have multiple compartments.

In the past, glove compartments typically contained an internal light. This light automatically turned on when the box was opened, helping to search its contents. From the 2000s, many manufacturers have not provided this light, to cut costs, even in luxury vehicles.

<doc id="726006" wikidata="Q2994894" url="?curid=726006" title="Dual monarchy">
<text>Dual monarchy occurs when two separate kingdoms are ruled by the same monarch, follow the same foreign policy, exist in a customs union with each other, and have a combined military but are otherwise self-governing. The term is typically used to refer to Austria-Hungary, a dual monarchy that existed from 1867 to 1918 that spanned across parts of Central and Eastern Europe, but applies to other dual monarchies such as the Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz. Dual monarchy is an uncommon form of government, and has been practiced few times in history, although many of the world&#x27;s most powerful countries have been or are dual monarchies. 

In the 1870s, using the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary as a model, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) and William Ewart Gladstone proposed that Ireland and Great Britain form a dual monarchy. Their efforts were unsuccessful, but the idea was later used in 1904 by Arthur Griffith in his seminal work, &quot;The Resurrection of Hungary&quot;. Griffith noted how in 1867 Hungary went from being part of the Austrian Empire to a separate co-equal kingdom in Austria-Hungary. Though not a monarchist himself, Griffith advocated such an approach for the Anglo-Irish relationship. The idea was not embraced by other Irish political leaders, and Ireland eventually fought a war of independence (1919–1921) to secede from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

The idea had a great appeal in the political circles of Great Britain because of its success in integrating Scotland and England into Great Britain. The Stuart Kings of Scotland, starting with James VI, also were the heads of state of England, holding the English crown. After the 17th century brought three different civil wars, and a great deal of armed conflict, it was decided in 1707 to codify the unification of England and Scotland into the &quot;perpetual&quot; partnership promised by the Acts of Union. A similar series of historical events had earlier incorporated Wales into England. A century of personal union of the Crowns of Scotland and England also saw the monarchs use the parliaments of each nation against each other, and civil war, but generally benefitted the economic state of both nations. Indeed, it was the 1707 Acts which gave England and Scotland the name Great Britain. Despite its historical success, the proposal to merge Ireland into Great Britain with some form of home rule was bandied about for decades before finally coming to naught in the Irish War of Independence.

Later historians have used the term to refer to other examples where one king ruled two states, such as Henry V and Henry VI, who were effectively kings of both England and France in the fifteenth century as a result of the formation of a puppet state in a large area of France during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Denmark–Norway, a dual monarchy that existed from 1537 to 1814, a century of personal union of Sweden and Norway (1814–1905), and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795).

A dual monarchy is a stronger bond than a personal union, in which two or more kingdoms are ruled by the same person but there are no other shared government structures. States in personal union with each other have separate militaries, separate foreign policies and separate customs duties. In this sense Austria-Hungary was not a mere personal union, as both states shared a cabinet that governed foreign policy, the Army and common finances.

<text>Hassan Muhammad Makki () (22 December 1933 – 9 June 2016) was the Prime Minister of the Yemen Arab Republic for four months in 1974. Makki was appointed by President Abdul Rahman al-Iryani. He was replaced shortly after the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; that placed Ibrahim al-Hamdi in power as Chairman of the Military Command Council.

Before and after his term as the Prime Minister he served as Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs or Minister for Economical Affairs several times between 1963 and 1980. He also has been sent as ambassador to Italy (1968–70, 1977–79), Western Germany (1970–72), to the United Nations (1974–76) and to the United States and Canada (1975–1976). Makki died on 9 June 2016, aged 82.

<text>In mathematics, a filtration formula_1 is an indexed family formula_2 of subobjects of a given algebraic structure formula_3, with the index formula_4 running over some totally ordered index set formula_5, subject to the condition that

::if formula_6 in formula_5, then formula_8.

If the index formula_4 is the time parameter of some stochastic process, then the filtration can be interpreted as representing all historical but not future information available about the stochastic process, with the algebraic structure formula_10 gaining in complexity with time. Hence, a process that is adapted to a filtration formula_1 is also called non-anticipating, because it cannot &quot;see into the future&quot;.

Sometimes, as in a filtered algebra, there is instead the requirement that the formula_10 be subalgebras with respect to some operations (say, vector addition), but not with respect to other operations (say, multiplication) that satisfy only formula_13, where the index set is the natural numbers; this is by analogy with a graded algebra.

Sometimes, filtrations are supposed to satisfy the additional requirement that the union of the formula_10 be the whole formula_3, or (in more general cases, when the notion of union does not make sense) that the canonical homomorphism from the direct limit of the formula_10 to formula_3 is an isomorphism. Whether this requirement is assumed or not usually depends on the author of the text and is often explicitly stated. This article does &quot;not&quot; impose this requirement.

There is also the notion of a descending filtration, which is required to satisfy formula_18 in lieu of formula_19 (and, occasionally, formula_20 instead of formula_21). Again, it depends on the context how exactly the word &quot;filtration&quot; is to be understood. Descending filtrations are not to be confused with the dual notion of cofiltrations (which consist of quotient objects rather than subobjects).

Filtrations are widely used in abstract algebra, homological algebra (where they are related in an important way to spectral sequences), and in measure theory and probability theory for nested sequences of σ-algebras. In functional analysis and numerical analysis, other terminology is usually used, such as scale of spaces or nested spaces.

==Examples==
===Sets===
Farey Sequence

===Algebra===

====Algebras====
See: Filtered algebra

====Groups====
In algebra, filtrations are ordinarily indexed by formula_22, the set of natural numbers. A &quot;filtration&quot; of a group formula_23, is then a nested sequence formula_24 of normal subgroups of formula_23 (that is, for any formula_26 we have formula_27). Note that this use of the word &quot;filtration&quot; corresponds to our &quot;descending filtration&quot;.

Given a group formula_23 and a filtration formula_24, there is a natural way to define a topology on formula_23, said to be &quot;associated&quot; to the filtration. A basis for this topology is the set of all cosets of subgroups appearing in the filtration, that is, a subset of formula_23 is defined to be open if it is a union of sets of the form formula_32, where formula_33 and formula_26 is a natural number.

The topology associated to a filtration on a group formula_23 makes formula_23 into a topological group.

The topology associated to a filtration formula_24 on a group formula_23 is Hausdorff if and only if formula_39.

If two filtrations formula_24 and formula_41 are defined on a group formula_23, then the identity map from formula_23 to formula_23, where the first copy of formula_23 is given the formula_24-topology and the second the formula_41-topology, is continuous if and only if for any formula_26 there is an formula_49 such that formula_50, that is, if and only if the identity map is continuous at 1. In particular, the two filtrations define the same topology if and only if for any subgroup appearing in one there is a smaller or equal one appearing in the other.

====Rings and modules: descending filtrations====

Given a ring formula_51 and an formula_51-module formula_53, a &quot;descending filtration&quot; of formula_53 is a decreasing sequence of submodules formula_55. This is therefore a special case of the notion for groups, with the additional condition that the subgroups be submodules. The associated topology is defined as for groups.

An important special case is known as the formula_5-adic topology (or formula_57-adic, etc.): Let formula_51 be a commutative ring, and formula_5 an ideal of formula_51. Given an formula_51-module formula_53, the sequence formula_63 of submodules of formula_53 forms a filtration of formula_53 (the &quot;formula_5-adic filtration&quot;). The &quot;formula_5-adic topology&quot; on formula_53 is then the topology associated to this filtration. If formula_53 is just the ring formula_51 itself, we have defined the &quot;formula_5-adic topology&quot; on formula_51.

When formula_51 is given the formula_5-adic topology, formula_51 becomes a topological ring. If an formula_51-module formula_53 is then given the formula_5-adic topology, it becomes a topological formula_51-module, relative to the topology given on formula_51.

====Rings and modules: ascending filtrations====

Given a ring formula_51 and an formula_51-module formula_53, an &quot;ascending filtration&quot; of formula_53 is an increasing sequence of submodules formula_55. In particular, if formula_51 is a field, then an ascending filtration of the formula_51-vector space formula_53 is an increasing sequence of vector subspaces of formula_53. Flags are one important class of such filtrations.

====Sets====
A maximal filtration of a set is equivalent to an ordering (a permutation) of the set. For instance, the filtration formula_90 corresponds to the ordering formula_91. From the point of view of the field with one element, an ordering on a set corresponds to a maximal flag (a filtration on a vector space), considering a set to be a vector space over the field with one element.

===Measure theory===

In measure theory, in particular in martingale theory and the theory of stochastic processes, a filtration is an increasing sequence of formula_92-algebras on a measurable space. That is, given a measurable space formula_93, a filtration is a sequence of formula_92-algebras formula_95 with formula_96 where each formula_97 is a non-negative real number and

:formula_98

The exact range of the &quot;times&quot; &quot;formula_97&quot; will usually depend on context: the set of values for formula_97 might be discrete or continuous, bounded or unbounded. For example,

:formula_101

Similarly, a filtered probability space (also known as a stochastic basis) formula_102, is a probability space equipped with the filtration formula_103 of its formula_92-algebra formula_1. A filtered probability space is said to satisfy the &quot;usual conditions&quot; if it is complete (i.e., formula_106 contains all formula_107-null sets) and right-continuous (i.e. formula_108 for all times formula_97).

It is also useful (in the case of an unbounded index set) to define formula_110 as the formula_92-algebra generated by the infinite union of the formula_112&#x27;s, which is contained in formula_1:

:formula_114

A &quot;σ&quot;-algebra defines the set of events that can be measured, which in a probability context is equivalent to events that can be discriminated, or &quot;questions that can be answered at time formula_97&quot;. Therefore, a filtration is often used to represent the change in the set of events that can be measured, through gain or loss of information. A typical example is in mathematical finance, where a filtration represents the information available up to and including each time formula_97, and is more and more precise (the set of measurable events is staying the same or increasing) as more information from the evolution of the stock price becomes available.

====Relation to stopping times: stopping time sigma-algebras====

Let formula_102 be a filtered probability space. A random variable formula_118 is a stopping time with respect to the filtration formula_119, if formula_120 for all formula_121. 
The &quot;stopping time&quot; formula_92-algebra is now defined as
:formula_123.

It is not difficult to show that formula_124 is indeed a formula_92-algebra.
The set formula_124 encodes information up to the &quot;random&quot; time formula_127 in the sense that, if the filtered probability space is interpreted as a random experiment, the maximum information that can be found out about it from arbitrarily often repeating the experiment until the random time formula_127 is formula_124. In particular, if the underlying probability space is finite (i.e. formula_1 is finite), the minimal sets of formula_124 (with respect to set inclusion) are given by the union over all formula_121 of the sets of minimal sets of formula_112 that lie in formula_134.

It can be shown that formula_127 is formula_124-measurable. However, simple examples show that, in general, formula_137. If formula_138 and formula_139 are stopping times on formula_102, and formula_141 almost surely, then formula_142

<text>A dry box is a storage container in which the interior is kept at a low level of humidity. It may be as simple as an airtight and watertight enclosure, or it may use active means to remove water vapor from the air trapped inside.

Dry boxes are used to safely store items that would otherwise be damaged or adversely affected by excessive humidity, such as cameras and lenses (to prevent fungal growth), 3D printing filament (to prevent moisture caused damages such as popping and sizzling when passing thru the hotend and turning into steam. Moisture soaked filament also becomes brittle or soft.), and musical instruments (to prevent humidity induced swelling or shrinkage of wooden instrument parts). They are also used in the storage of surface mount electronic components prior to circuit board assembly, to prevent water absorption that could flash into steam during reflow soldering, destroying the part.

== Types ==
=== Desiccant boxes ===
A simple dry box can consist of nothing more than a sealed, airtight box containing a desiccant, such as silica gel or anhydrous calcium chloride. These can be easily built at relatively low cost. However, the humidity level in such boxes cannot be controlled or regulated, owing to the difficulty of gauging the quantity of desiccant required to achieve a certain humidity level. Repeated opening of such boxes, allowing humid ambient air to enter, can saturate the desiccant, and some desiccants can have corrosive or other harmful effects on the contents of the box if they collect enough water to dissolve.

=== Electronic dry boxes ===
Electronic dry boxes contain a small Peltier cooler, which removes moisture from the air by condensing it out. A control dial is usually provided that permits the user rough adjustment of the humidity level. More sophisticated designs link the cooler to a settable digital hygrometer, allowing very precise humidity level control.

Another form of electronic dry box technology utilizes multi-porous molecular sieve desiccants to absorb moisture. This moisture and humidity control technology is renewable without having to replace desiccant and is capable of reaching low humidity (20%RH or less) to ultra low humidity (5%RH or less) levels. Generally dry boxes with 5%RH or less is utilized in surface mount technology in order to comply with IPC/JEDEC J-STD-033. Desiccants have advantages over Peltier coolers in lower ambient temperatures.

<text>Qadhi Abdullah al-Hajjri (; 1911 – 10 April 1977) was the Prime Minister of the Yemen Arab Republic from 30 December 1972 until 10 February 1974. He was appointed by President Abdul Rahman al-Iryani.

== Death ==
Hajjri was assassinated in London on April 10, 1977, along with his wife Fatimah and Abdullah Ali al Hammami, minister plenipotentiary of the Yemen Arab Republic embassy in London. All three were shot dead in their Mercedes-Benz car outside the Royal Lancaster Hotel near Hyde Park using a silenced .32 automatic pistol. A report in a British newspaper named Zohair Yousif Akache, a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) militant and later that year the leader of the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181, as being wanted by Scotland Yard in connection with the political killings.

<doc id="726022" wikidata="Q726272" url="?curid=726022" title="Tommy Lawton">
<text>Thomas Lawton (6 October 1919 – 6 November 1996) was an English football player and manager.

Born in Farnworth and raised in Bolton, he played amateur football at Rossendale United, before he turned professional at Burnley on his 17th birthday. He also played cricket for Burnley Cricket Club before his potential as a footballer won him a £6,500 move to Everton in January 1937. He went on to finish as the First Division&#x27;s top-scorer in 1938 and 1939, helping Everton to finish as champions of the Football League in the latter campaign. League football was then suspended for seven full seasons due to the outbreak of war in Europe, during which time he scored 24 goals in 23 appearances for England whilst guesting for Everton and some other clubs. In November 1945, he moved to Chelsea for £14,000 and scored a club-record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season.

In November 1947, he made a surprise move to Third Division South club Notts County for a British record transfer fee of £20,000. He helped the club to win promotion as champions in 1949–50 before he moved on to Brentford in March 1952 for a club record £16,000. In January 1953, Brentford appointed him player-manager, though he would only remain in charge for nine months. He joined Arsenal as a player in November 1953 for £10,000, where he saw out the remainder of his playing career. Despite losing much of his best years to World War II, he scored 260 goals in 433 league and cup competitions in 14 full seasons in the Football League.

He had a promising start to his managerial career by leading Kettering Town to the Southern League title in 1956–57, but then only had two more seasons as manager, getting relegated with Notts County in 1957–58 and then relegated with Kettering Town in 1963–64. During the 1970s, he struggled with debt and related legal problems, which were reported in the media as an example of a celebrated person falling from grace.

He scored 22 goals in his 23 England appearances over a ten-year international career from 1938 to 1948, including four against Portugal in May 1947. He helped England to win two British Home Championship titles outright (1946–47 and 1947–48) and to share the Championship in 1938–39. He fell out of international contention at the age of 28 due to his contempt for manager Walter Winterbottom, his decision to drop out of the First Division, and the emergence of Jackie Milburn and Nat Lofthouse. In addition to his England caps, he also represented The Football League XI and played in a special Great Britain game against Europe in 1947. He married twice and had two children and one step-child. His ashes are held in the National Football Museum, and he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2003.

==Early life==
Thomas Lawton was born on 6 October 1919 to Elizabeth Riley and Thomas Lawton Senior in Farnworth, Lancashire. His father was a railway signalman, and his mother worked as a weaver at Harrowby Mill. His father left the family 18 months after Lawton was born, and Elizabeth moved back into her parents&#x27; home in Bolton. Elizabeth&#x27;s father, James Hugh &quot;Jim&quot; Riley, became Lawton&#x27;s surrogate father. Lawton&#x27;s natural footballing ability earned him a place on the Bolton Town Schools team in 1930. Lancashire Schools picked him at the age of 13. Despite scoring a hat-trick in a trial game for England Schoolboys, he never earned a full England Schoolboy cap. At the age of 14, he began playing for Hayes Athletic in the Bolton Senior League and went on to score 570 goals in three seasons. 

The FA&#x27;s rules meant he was unable to turn professional at a club until he was 17, and Lawton&#x27;s grandfather rejected Bolton Wanderers&#x27;s offer for Lawton to work as a delivery driver for two years before turning professional at the club. Lawton instead played as an amateur for Rossendale United in the Lancashire Combination, scoring a hat-trick on his debut against Bacup. He took up temporary work at a tannery and then joined Burnley as assistant groundsman after his mother rejected an offer from Sheffield Wednesday as she objected to him travelling to Sheffield daily.

==Club career==

===Burnley===
Lawton played his first game for Burnley Reserves against Manchester City Reserves in September 1935. Though he struggled in this game, he became a regular Reserve team player by age 16. After a poor run of form from Cecil Smith, Lawton was selected ahead of Smith for the Second Division game against Doncaster Rovers at Turf Moor on 28 March 1936; aged 16 years and 174 days, this made him the youngest centre-forward ever to play in the Football League. Rovers centre-half Syd Bycroft, also making his league debut, marked Lawton out of the game, which ended in a 1–1 draw. Burnley had played poorly, though Lawton was praised for his &quot;keen and fearless&quot; performance by the &quot;Express &amp; News&quot; newspaper. He retained his place for the following game, and scored two goals in a 3–1 victory over Swansea Town at Vetch Field. He picked up a groin strain in his third appearance, which caused him to miss two fixtures before he returned to the first team for the final four games of the 1935–36 season; he claimed three more goals to take his season tally to five goals from seven games.

Lawton continued to train his heading skills intensely in the summer of 1936 and also played cricket for Burnley Cricket Club as a batsman in the Lancashire League. He scored a six against both Learie Constantine and Amar Singh. He scored 369 runs in 15 completed innings for an average of 24.06.

He turned professional at Burnley at 17 on wages of £7 a week. His grandfather attempted to negotiate a £500 signing-on fee on his behalf but was rebuffed after the club alerted Charles Sutcliffe, Secretary of the Football League, who informed them that any attempt to circumvent the league&#x27;s maximum wage was illegal. Lawton scored in his first appearance since signing the contract after just 30 seconds before going on to record a hat-trick in a 3–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur, scoring a goal with either foot and one with his head.

===Everton===
In January 1937, First Division club Everton paid Burnley £6,500 to secure Lawton&#x27;s services and also gave his grandfather a job as deputy groundsman at Goodison Park; the fee was a record for a player under 21. The move to Everton made him a teammate of Dixie Dean, his boyhood idol, who he was expected to gradually replace as first-choice centre-forward. He later recalled that on his way to Goodison Park on his first day as an Everton player, he was told by a tram conductor that &quot;You&#x27;re that young Lawton, aren&#x27;t you? You&#x27;ll never be as good as Dixie.&quot; Dean was finally rested on 13 February, which allowed Lawton to make his first team debut against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux; the match ended in a 6–2 defeat, though Lawton scored a penalty. He spent the rest of the season at inside-left, with Dean at centre-forward, and ended the 1936–37 campaign with four goals in 11 games. He started the 1937–38 season in the Reserves. He was installed as first choice centre-forward in September after Dean was dropped for punching club secretary Theo Kelly. On 2 October, Lawton scored the winning penalty in a 2–1 victory over Merseyside derby rivals Liverpool at Anfield. He ended the campaign with 28 goals in 39 appearances to become the division&#x27;s top-scorer.

Everton had a young but highly effective team for the 1938–39 campaign, and Lawton was praised for the way he led the attack, with the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;&#x27;s Roland Allen describing Lawton as a &quot;clever footballer, bringing his wing men into the game with shrewd flicks and widely flung and accurate passes&quot; after Everton recorded a 2–1 victory over Arsenal at Highbury. The game against Arsenal was part of a run of six wins in the first six games of the campaign, during which time Lawton scored eight goals. Everton lost their lead at the top of the table to Derby County over Christmas, but returned to form and to first position by Easter. They faced a difficult final run of games, but beat Chelsea and recorded two victories over Sunderland to secure the club&#x27;s fifth league title, finishing four points ahead of second-place Wolverhampton Wanderers. Lawton scored 35 goals in 38 league games to finish as the division&#x27;s top-scorer for the second successive season. However, in the summer he wrote to Leicester City to request that the club buy him from Everton; it was reported that he reached out to Leicester as they were managed by Tom Bromilow, his former Burnley manager. Everton were fifth in the league and Lawton was the division&#x27;s top-scorer with four goals when league football was suspended three games into the 1939–40 season due to the outbreak of World War II. Lawton later remarked that &quot;I&#x27;m convinced that if it hadn&#x27;t been for the War, we&#x27;d have won the Championship again, the average age of those players was about 24 or 25&quot;.

===World War II===
Lawton continued to play for both Everton and England during the war. However, the FA decided not to award full caps for England appearances during the war. As a result, his 24 goals in 23 international games were not counted in statistics for the official England team. As was common for footballers during the war, he also made guest appearances for several clubs besides Everton, including Leicester City, Greenock Morton, Chester City, Aldershot, and Tranmere Rovers. He was called up to the British Army in January 1940, and his status as an England international saw him recruited to the Royal Army Physical Training Corps. He also played for the British Army team and his Area Command team. He was posted in Birkenhead, which allowed him to appear for Everton frequently. 

On Christmas Day 1940, he played for Everton against Liverpool at Anfield in the morning and Tranmere Rovers at Crewe Alexandra in the afternoon. Explaining this later, he said, &#x27;The Tranmere people came into the dressing room and asked if anyone wanted to play as they were two men short. I said, &quot;Go on, I&#x27;ll help you out.&quot; And I did.&#x27; In 1942, he scored a hat-trick for England in a 5–4 win over Scotland at Hampden Park. Later in the year, he scored six goals for Aldershot in a 9–0 win over Luton Town. On 16 October 1943, he scored four goals in an 8–0 victory over Scotland at Maine Road.

===Chelsea===
In July 1945, Lawton handed in a transfer request at Everton as he wanted a move to a Southern club to see more of his increasingly estranged wife. In November 1945, he was sold to Chelsea for a fee of £14,000. Chelsea continued to play regional wartime fixtures as national league football had not resumed for the 1945–46 season, and Lawton also continued his uncapped appearances for the England national team. In the summer of 1946, following his demobilisation, he coached for the FA in a summer camp in Switzerland. He scored a club record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season. However, he struggled to settle at Stamford Bridge. He came into conflict with manager Billy Birrell after refusing to go on a pre-season tour of Sweden in 1947, which resulted in him requesting a transfer. He favoured a move to Arsenal, but the Chelsea hierarchy ruled this out. Lawton turned down an approach by Sunderland manager Bill Murray as he held out hope that Chelsea would relent and allow him a move to Arsenal.

===Notts County===

In November 1947, Lawton was sold to Notts County of the Third Division South for a British record transfer fee of £20,000 (). He made the surprise decision to drop down two divisions to be reunited with manager Arthur Stollery, his former masseur and friend at Chelsea, and because he was promised a job outside of football upon his retirement by vice-chairman Harold Walmsley. Walmsley told the &quot;Nottingham Guardian Journal&quot; that &quot;we are prepared to spend to the limit to put this old club back where it belongs&quot;. He scored two goals on his home debut, a 4–2 win over Bristol Rovers in front of 38,000 spectators at Meadow Lane – a huge increase on previous home games of typically 6,000 to 7,000 supporters. He ended the 1947–48 season with 24 goals in as many games, though he was resented by the club&#x27;s directors after he insisted on pay rises for his teammates and stopped the practice of director&#x27;s friends and family travelling to away games on the team coach.

He formed a productive forward partnership with Jackie Sewell in the 1948–49 campaign and scored 23 goals in 40 league and cup appearances. County finished in mid-table despite scoring 102 goals, 15 more than champions Swansea. Stollery was sacked, and upon Lawton&#x27;s suggestion, the club appointed Eric Houghton as manager after Lawton turned down the role as player-manager. Lawton and Sewell&#x27;s understanding grew throughout the 1949–50 campaign, and Lawton finished as the division&#x27;s top-scorer with 31 goals in 37 league games as County won promotion as champions, seven points ahead of second-placed Northampton Town. Promotion was secured with a 2–0 win over local rivals Nottingham Forest at Meadow Lane on 22 April.

However, he struggled with poor form during the 1950–51 season as his first marriage ended, and he came into increasing conflict with his teammates. He was angered when the club sold Jackie Sewell to Sheffield Wednesday in March 1951 – breaking Lawton&#x27;s own transfer record in the process – as he felt the move showed a lack of ambition from the club&#x27;s directors. He also found that the well-paid job he was promised outside of football did not transpire. His tally of nine goals in 31 games in 1950–51 and 13 goals in 31 games in 1951–52 was disappointing, and he was made available for transfer. He voluntarily relinquished the captaincy to teammate Leon Leuty in November 1951, expressing that he no longer wanted the responsibility.

===Brentford===
In March 1952, Lawton joined Second Division side Brentford for a club record £16,000 fee. Manager Jackie Gibbons left the club at the start of the 1952–53 season and was succeeded by his assistant Jimmy Bain, who proved ill-suited to management, and so in January 1953 Lawton was appointed as player-manager, with Bain as his assistant. However he lost the dressing room due to his excessive demands of the players, and the strains of management were hurting his form. Brentford also lost their best players having sold both Ron Greenwood and Jimmy Hill. He signed two veterans in former Notts County teammate Frank Broome and Ian McPherson to play on the wings, who, with Lawton, formed an attacking trio with a combined age of 104. They got off to a poor start to the 1953–54 season, and Lawton resigned as manager after the Griffin Park crowd began to mock the forward line by singing &quot;Dear Old Pals&quot;.

===Arsenal===
In November 1953, Lawton was traded to First Division champions Arsenal for £7,500 plus James Robertson who was valued at £2,500. He was signed by manager Tom Whittaker, who had previously found success in bringing in veterans such as Ronnie Rooke and Joe Mercer. However Lawton was limited to ten appearances in the 1953–54 campaign after picking up an injury on his debut. He also played in the 1953 Charity Shield, scoring one goal as Arsenal beat Blackpool 3–1. He scored seven goals in 20 appearances throughout the 1954–55 season, including winning goals against Chelsea and Cardiff City. He scored a hat-trick past Cardiff City on the opening day of the 1955–56 season, before he announced his decision to leave Arsenal to pursue a career in management eight games into the campaign.

==International career==
Lawton was called up to play for The Football League XI against a League of Ireland XI at Windsor Park on 21 September 1938, and scored four goals in what finished as an 8–2 win. A month later he went on to win his first cap for England on 22 October, England&#x27;s first game of the 1938–39 British Home Championship, a 4–2 defeat to Wales at Ninian Park, and converted a penalty kick to mark his first England appearance with a goal. This made him the youngest player to score on his England debut, a record which lasted until Marcus Rashford broke it in 2016. Four days after Lawton&#x27;s debut, he scored again for England at Highbury in a 3–0 win over &#x27;The Rest of Europe&#x27;, a team of players selected from Italy, Germany, France, Belgium, Hungary and Norway. Later in the year he also scored in victories over Norway and Ireland. He played in all four games of 1939, scoring against Scotland and Italy; the goal against Scotland secured a 2–1 win in front of 149,269 spectators at Hampden Park.

Newly appointed England manager Walter Winterbottom played Lawton in England&#x27;s first official match in seven years on 28 September 1946, a 7–2 win over Ireland. He played the remaining three fixtures of 1946 and scored four goals in an 8–2 victory over the Netherlands at Leeds Road on 27 November. On 10 May 1947, he scored two goals playing for the Great Britain XI in a 6–1 victory over a Rest of Europe XI that was billed as the &#x27;Match of the Century&#x27;. Five days later he scored four goals in a 10–0 victory over Portugal at Lisbon&#x27;s Estádio Nacional. On 21 September, he scored after just 12 seconds in a 5–2 win over Belgium at Heysel Stadium.

He retained his place in the England team following his club move to Notts County, and in doing so, became the first Third Division footballer to represent England when he scored from the penalty spot in a 4–2 win over Sweden on 19 November. However, he only won three further caps in 1948, his final appearance coming in a 0–0 draw with Denmark in Copenhagen on 26 September. He had become increasingly disillusioned with the England set-up, and told Winterbottom that &quot;if you think you can teach Stanley Matthews to play on the wing and me how to score goals, you&#x27;ve got another think coming!&quot; Winterbottom was also frustrated by Lawton&#x27;s smoking habit and preferred Jackie Milburn ahead of Lawton. Hopes of any future comeback were ended by the emergence of powerful centre-forward Nat Lofthouse, who made his England debut in November 1950.

==Style of play==
Lawton was widely regarded as the finest centre-forward of his generation. He boasted a strong physique and good ball control skills, as well as a great passing range and a powerful shot. He was naturally right-footed, though worked to improve his left foot to a good enough standard to be considered a two-footed player. His greatest strength though was his ability to head the ball with power and accuracy, as he possessed muscular legs to give himself a strong jump and long hang-time, and was also able to time his jumps to perfection. Stanley Matthews surmised that &quot;Quite simply, Tommy was the greatest header of the ball I ever saw.&quot; Lawton was never booked throughout his career.

==Coaching career and later life==
An Arsenal director helped Lawton to secure the position of player-manager at Southern League side Kettering Town. He took up the role at the club on wages of £1,500 a year in the summer of 1956. At the helm he thereafter signed several footballers such as Jim Standen of Arsenal, Amos Moss of Aston Villa, Jack Wheeler who played for Huddersfield Town and Brentford&#x27;s Jack Goodwin. He was also successful in bringing to Kettering Fulham&#x27;s Bob Thomas, Harry McDonald who was previously with Crystal Palace and Sunderland&#x27;s Geoff Toseland. During his debut season as manager, 1956–1957, Kettering found themselves ten points clear at the top of the table by Christmas. As a result of this success, in January 1956, he turned down an approach from Notts County. Lawton then went on to foster Kettering towards their winning of the league title in 1956–57 by eight points. Out of Kettering&#x27;s 106 league goals, Lawton scored 15.

He was appointed Notts County manager in May 1957, controversially replacing caretaker-manager Frank Broome. Broome, who had steered the club away from being relegated from the Second Division, was installed as his assistant manager. He found it tedious making new signings due to financial constraints on the part of the club. He did though take on forwards Jeff Astle and Tony Hateley as apprentices, who would both go on to have long careers in the First Division. Lawton agreed to go without his wages for six months to improve the club&#x27;s finances. County were, however, relegated at the end of the 1957–58 season, finishing one point short of safety, and Lawton was sacked. He received a total of just three months&#x27; pay for his time at the club, having only a verbal offer of a three-year contract to fall back on and nothing in writing.

After being sacked as Notts County manager, Lawton ran the &quot;Magna Charta&quot; public house in Lowdham from October 1958. An employee stole £2,500 from the business, and Lawton decided to leave the pub trade after four years. He then took up a job selling insurance. 
He returned to football management with Kettering Town for the 1963–64 season as a caretaker following the resignation of Wally Akers. The season ended with Kettering being relegated from the Southern League Premier Division. He was offered the job permanently, but turned it down to concentrate on his job as an insurance salesman. He lost his job in insurance in 1967 and then opened a sporting goods shop that bore his name after going into partnership with a friend, but was forced to close the business after just two months due to poor sales. After a period on unemployment benefits he found work at a betting company in Nottingham.

He returned to Notts County as a coach and chief scout from 1968 to 1970. He was sacked after new manager Jimmy Sirrel decided to appoint his own backroom staff, and Lawton returned to unemployment. In May 1970, he wrote to Chelsea chairman Richard Attenborough asking for a loan of £250 and possible employment; Attenborough lent him £100. He was interviewed by Eamonn Andrews on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme on his fall from England star to the unemployment line. After his financial troubles became public knowledge, a large furnishing company offered him a lucrative job as director of his own subsidiary furniture company on Tottenham Court Road; however the company went into liquidation the following year. He continued to write cheques in the company&#x27;s name, and in June 1972, pleaded guilty to seven charges of obtaining goods and cash by deception. He was sentenced to three years probation, and ordered to pay £240 compensation and £100 in costs.

In 1972, a testimonial match was organised by Everton on Lawton&#x27;s behalf to help him pay off his debts of around £6,000. However his financial situation was still bleak, and on two occasions he narrowly avoided a prison sentence for failing to pay his rates after an Arsenal supporters club and later an anonymous former co-worker stepped in to pay the bill for him. In August 1974, he was again found guilty of obtaining goods by deception after failing to repay a £10 debt to a publican. He was sentenced to 200 hours of Community service and ordered to pay £40 costs. In 1984, he began writing a column for the &quot;Nottingham Evening Post&quot;. Brentford also organised a testimonial match for him in May 1985.

Lawton&#x27;s health deteriorated in his old age, and he died in November 1996, aged 77, as a result of pneumonia. His ashes were donated to the National Football Museum. He was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2003.

==Personal life==
Lawton married Rosaleen May Kavanagh in January 1941; the marriage bore one child, Amanda. Divorce was granted with a decree nisi in March 1951 after Rosaleen was found to have committed adultery with Notts County director Adrian Van Geffen; Lawton never saw Amanda again and was not required to pay child support. Lawton married second wife Gladys Rose in September 1952, who bore him a son, Thomas Junior. Gladys was also divorced, and her ex-husband cited Lawton as a co-respondent in the divorce proceedings as the pair had begun their relationship whilst Gladys was still married; her family were staunch Catholics, and her family ostracised Gladys following her divorce. Gladys had a daughter, Carol, from her previous marriage, who Lawton raised as his own. Thomas Junior went on to play rugby union for Leicester Tigers.

He starred alongside Thora Hird and Diana Dors in the 1953 film &quot;The Great Game&quot;, playing himself in a cameo role. Throughout the 1950s he went on to appear on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; amongst other radio and television programmes. He published a total of five books: &quot;Football is My Business&quot; (1946),&quot;Tommy Lawton&#x27;s all star football book&quot; (1950), &quot;Soccer the Lawton way&quot; (1954), &quot;My Twenty Years of Soccer&quot; (1955), and &quot;When the Cheering Stopped&quot; (1973).

<text>Nancy Jane Kulp (August 28, 1921 – February 3, 1991) was an American character actor, writer and comedian best known as Miss Jane Hathaway on the CBS television series &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.

==Early life==
Kulp was born to Robert Tilden and Marjorie C. (née Snyder) Kulp in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. She was their only child. Kulp&#x27;s father was a traveling salesman, and her mother was a schoolteacher and later a principal. The family moved from Mifflintown, Pennsylvania, to Miami in Miami-Dade County, Florida, sometime before 1935.

In 1943, Kulp graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism from Florida State College for Women (now Florida State University). She continued her studies for a master&#x27;s degree in English and French at the University of Miami, where she was a member of the sorority Pi Beta Phi. Early in the 1940s, she also worked as a feature writer for the &quot;Miami Beach Tropics&quot; newspaper, writing profiles of celebrities such as Clark Gable and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.

==Military service==
In 1944, during World War II, Kulp left the University of Miami to join the U.S. Naval Reserve. She attained the rank of lieutenant, junior grade, and received several decorations while in the service, including the American Campaign Medal. She was honorably discharged in 1946.

==Career==

===Film===
In 1951, not long after marrying Charles Malcolm Dacus, Kulp moved to Hollywood, California, to work in MGM&#x27;s publicity department. At the studio, director George Cukor soon convinced her that she should be an actress, so the same year she began her MGM publicity job, she also made her film debut as a character actress in &quot;The Model and the Marriage Broker&quot;. She then appeared in other films, including &quot;Shane&quot;, &quot;Sabrina&quot;, and &quot;A Star is Born&quot;. After working in television on &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; and on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; in &quot;The Case of the Deadly Toy&quot; in 1959, Kulp returned to movies in &quot;Forever, Darling&quot;, &quot;The Three Faces of Eve&quot;, &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Minding the Store?&quot;, and &quot;The Aristocats&quot;. In 1966, she appeared as Wilhelmina Peterson in the film &quot;The Night of the Grizzly&quot;, starring Clint Walker and Martha Hyer.

===Television===
In 1955 Kulp joined the cast of &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; (&quot;Love That Bob&quot;) with Bob Cummings, portraying pith-helmeted neighborhood bird watcher Pamela Livingstone. In 1956, she appeared as a waitress in the episode &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; of the ABC/Warner Brothers series &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, with Clint Walker. Kulp played the role of Anastasia in three episodes of the NBC sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Life&quot; in 1955 and 1956. In 1958, she appeared in Orson Welles&#x27; little-known pilot episode &quot;The Fountain of Youth&quot; in the television series &quot;Colgate Theatre&quot;. In 1960, she appeared as Emma St. John in the episode &quot;Kill with Kindness&quot; of the ABC/WB detective series &quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot;, starring Andrew Duggan.

Kulp appeared on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; in the 1956 episode &quot;Lucy Meets the Queen&quot;, performing as an English maid, who shows Lucy and Ethel how to curtsy properly before Queen Elizabeth. Kulp also appeared in episodes of &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (&quot;The Case of the Prodigal Parent&quot;, 1958, and &quot;The Case of the Deadly Toy&quot;, 1959), &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;s 27th Anniversary with Jack&quot;), &quot;87th Precinct&quot; (&quot;Killer&#x27;s Choice&quot;), &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (as Mrs. Gann in &quot;The Fugitive&quot;), and &quot;Outlaws&quot; (&quot;The Dark Sunrise of Griff Kincaid, Esquire&quot;). Kulp portrayed a slurring-drunk waitress in a scene with James Garner and Jean Willes in the 1959 &quot;Maverick&quot; episode &quot;Full House&quot;. She played a housekeeper in a pilot for &quot;The William Bendix Show&quot;, which aired as the 1960–1961 season finale of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Mister Ed&quot; under the title &quot;Pine Lake Lodge&quot;. On the series &quot;My Three Sons&quot; in 1962, she portrayed a high school math and science teacher in two episodes under different character names, Miss Harris and Miss Fisher.

Shortly after her performances on &quot;My Three Sons&quot; in 1962, Kulp landed her breakout role as Jane Hathaway, the love-starved, bird-watching, perennial spinster, on the CBS television series &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. In 1967, she received an Emmy Award nomination for her role, and she remained with the show until its cancellation in 1971. In 1978, she appeared on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; in the episode &quot;Mike and Ike / The Witness / The Kissing Bandit&quot; and she played Aunt Gertrude in the episode &quot;Tony and Julie / Separate Beds / America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot;. On April 7, 1989, she played a nun in the &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; season 1 episode &quot;The Right Hand of God&quot;. Kulp also appeared on &quot;The Brian Keith Show&quot; and &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;.

===Theatre===
Kulp also performed in the Broadway production of &quot;Morning&#x27;s at Seven&quot; in 1980 to 1981 as Aaronetta Gibbs as a replacement for Elizabeth Wilson in the Lyceum Theatre.

==Politics, academia and retirement==
Nancy Kulp served on the board of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) while living in California. In 1984, after working with the Democratic state committee in her home state of Pennsylvania &quot;on a variety of projects&quot; over a period of years, Kulp ran unopposed as the Democratic nominee for the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania&#x27;s 9th congressional district. As an opponent of six-term Republican Bud Shuster in a Republican-dominated district, Kulp was a decided underdog. Sixty-two years old at the time, Kulp said some voters might feel her background as an actress was &quot;frivolous&quot;, but she noted that Ronald Reagan had taken the route from screen to politics, and she said anyone who &quot;listens and cares&quot; can do well.

To her dismay, her &quot;Hillbillies&quot; co-star Buddy Ebsen, an ardent Republican, contacted the Shuster campaign and volunteered to make a radio campaign ad in which he called Kulp &quot;too liberal&quot;. Kulp and Ebsen had a somewhat frosty relationship on set in part because of their sharp political differences. Later, Kulp said of Ebsen, &quot;He&#x27;s not the kindly old Jed Clampett that you saw on the show ... It&#x27;s none of his business and he should have stayed out of it.&quot; She said Ebsen and she &quot;didn&#x27;t get along because I found him difficult to work with. But I never would have done something like this to him.&quot; Garnering 59,449 votes—just 33.6% of the ballots cast in the election—to Shuster&#x27;s 117,203 votes and 66.4%, she lost. After this, according to her close friends and family, Ebsen was regarded as &quot;persona non grata&quot; to Kulp and she made it clear to people not to bring him up in conversation around her with the exception of interviews related to her time on &quot;Hillbillies&quot;. In his later years, especially after Kulp&#x27;s death, Ebsen privately expressed remorse for doing the ad and they only reconciled shortly before Kulp&#x27;s death.

After her defeat, she worked at Juniata College, a private liberal arts college in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, as an artist-in-residence. Later she taught acting.

==Personal life==

Kulp married Charles Malcolm Dacus on April 1, 1951, in Dade County, Florida; they divorced in 1961. After her retirement from acting and teaching, she moved first to a farm in Connecticut and later to Palm Springs, California, where she became involved in several charity organizations, including the Humane Society of the Desert, the Desert Theatre League, and United Cerebral Palsy. 

Later, Nancy Kulp gave an interview to author and LGBT activist Boze Hadleigh, for his book &quot;Hollywood Lesbians&quot; in which she said,

As long as you reproduce my reply word for word, and the question, you may use it ... I&#x27;d appreciate it if you&#x27;d let me phrase the question. There is more than one way. Here&#x27;s how I would ask it: &quot;Do you think that opposites attract?&quot; My own reply would be that I&#x27;m the other sort—I find that birds of a feather flock together. That answers your question.
===Death===
Kulp, a cigarette smoker, was diagnosed with cancer in 1990 and received chemotherapy. By 1991 the cancer had spread, and she died on February 3, 1991, aged 69, in Palm Desert, California. Her remains are interred at Westminster Presbyterian Cemetery in Mifflintown, Pennsylvania.

<text>Andrew Plotkin (born May 15, 1970), also known as Zarf, is an American programmer and writer. He is a central figure in the modern interactive fiction (IF) community. Having both written a number of award-winning games and developed a range of new file formats, interpreters, and other utilities for the design, production, and running of IF games, Plotkin is widely recognised for both his creative and his technical contributions to the homebrew IF scene.

==Interactive fiction==
Plotkin was one of the earliest writers to use Graham Nelson&#x27;s Inform development system, and one of the first since Infocom&#x27;s heyday to explore the boundaries of interactive fiction as an artistic medium. Many later authors cite him as a primary influence. He has won many awards within the community, and is frequently interviewed for magazine articles about interactive fiction.

Plotkin has also made major technical contributions to the interactive fiction medium, designing the Blorb archive format, the Glk I/O platform, and the Glulx virtual machine, and implementing Glulx Inform and several interactive fiction interpreters for the Macintosh and X. The Glk API has made possible the creation of &quot;universal translator&quot; interpreters such as Gargoyle, a single program capable of running all interactive fiction formats.

, Plotkin holds two XYZZY Award-related records: for most XYZZYs won in one year (5, with &quot;Spider and Web&quot;) and for most XYZZYs won in total: 18.
His most influential games are:
* &quot;Freefall&quot; (1995; Tetris clone – possibly the first so-called Z-machine abuse)
* &quot;A Change in the Weather&quot; (1995; winner of the 1995 IF Comp&#x27;s Inform division)
* &quot;So Far&quot; (1996; winner of many XYZZY Awards that year, including for Best Game)
* &quot;The Space Under the Window&quot; (1997)
* &quot;Spider and Web&quot; (1998; winner of many XYZZY Awards that year, including for Best Game)
* &quot;Hunter, in Darkness&quot; (1999; winner of the XYZZY Awards for Best Individual Puzzle and Best Setting)
* &quot;Shade&quot; (2000; winner of the XYZZY Award for Best Setting)

Other Andrew Plotkin games include:

*&quot;Lists and Lists&quot; (1996), an introductory course in the Scheme programming language
*&quot;The Dreamhold&quot; (2004), a general IF tutorial game
*&quot;Delightful Wallpaper&quot; (2006; sixth place in IF Comp and winner of Miss Congeniality)
*&quot;Dual Transform&quot; (2010)
*&quot;Hoist Sail for the Heliopause and Home&quot; (2010)

More recently, he was featured on CNN Money for successfully raising over $31,000 using Kickstarter for development of a new interactive fiction piece called &quot;Hadean Lands&quot; for the iPhone and release of the resulting iPhone game framework as open source. Plotkin was also featured prominently in the 2010 interactive fiction documentary, GET LAMP.

On June 24, 2014, Plotkin released the source code for several of his games for educational purposes.

==Other work==
He wrote the former shareware puzzle game &quot;System&#x27;s Twilight&quot;. Plotkin appears as a character in &quot;Being Andrew Plotkin&quot;, an interactive fiction game by J. Robinson Wheeler based in part on the film &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;.

While a student at Carnegie Mellon University, Plotkin was one of the early members of the Carnegie Mellon KGB. He created the organization&#x27;s signature &quot;Capture the Flag with Stuff&quot; game, which is now played by several hundred students every semester.

In 1997, Plotkin developed a rethemed version of Dmitry Davidoff&#x27;s social game Mafia, replacing the &quot;mafia&quot; characters with werewolves. Plotkin&#x27;s version of the game subsequently became popular at universities and conferences in the United States, with a set of cards being produced by Looney Labs.

He has also made contributions to the Icehouse community, both in designing the game &quot;Branches &amp; Twigs &amp; Thorns&quot;, and the creation of several custom sets of pieces. During 2006 he was involved in the open source on-line game platform Volity and has created, or assisted in the creation of, on-line versions of the pyramid game Treehouse and other Looney Labs titles to showcase the platform.

In 2019 he created and co-chaired with Adri Mills NarraScope, a games conference focusing on interactive narrative, adventure games, and interactive fiction.

<text>Joseph Ward (May 5, 1838 – December 11, 1889) was an American educator.

==Biography==
Joseph Ward was born at Perry Center, New York. After attending public schools, he taught and worked on a farm before entering Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. He graduated from Brown University and Andover Theological Seminary. After accepting a missionary appointment, he was ordained and directed church efforts in Yankton, capital of the Dakota Territory in 1869. Because there were no public school funds, Ward opened a private school, which became Yankton Academy. Later given over to public control, it became the earliest high school in Dakota.

He was instrumental in the founding of Yankton College, the first collegiate-rank institution of the upper Missouri River Valley, and served as its president. He also played an important role in keeping school lands out of the control of eastern speculators, and was the first president of the Yankton Board of Education. He also helped establish in 1879 the Dakota Hospital for the Insane.

Ward was a leader in the movement for South Dakota statehood, serving as a delegate to the various conventions and as a member of the 1885 committee to present the petition for statehood to Congress. He drafted much of the constitution and was chairman of the committee charged with keeping the convention records. He composed the state motto (&quot;Under God the People Rule&quot;), and wrote the description for the Great Seal of the State of South Dakota. Bedridden and unable to attend the final constitutional convention in 1889, he died on December 11, 1889, a few weeks after South Dakota was admitted as a state.

In 1963, the State of South Dakota donated a marble statue of Ward to the United States Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection.

<text>James Williams Adams VC (24 November 1839 – 20 October 1903) was an Irish Anglican chaplain and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the first clergyman, and the last of five civilians, to be awarded the VC.

==Early life==
Adams was born in Cork, Ireland on 24 November 1839. He was the only son of James O&#x27;Brien Adams, magistrate, and his wife, Elizabeth Williams.

He was educated at Hamblin and Porter&#x27;s Grammar School, Cork, and Trinity College, Dublin, and ordained in 1863.
His first curacy was in Hyde, Hampshire, from 1863 to 1865 and then at Shottesbrooke, Berkshire, from 1865 to 1866. In October 1866 Adams became a chaplain on the Bengal establishment under Bishop Robert Milman at Calcutta.

==Victoria Cross==
Reverend James Williams Adams was 40 years old, and a chaplain in the Bengal Ecclesiastical Department (serving as chaplain to the Kabul Field Force), British Indian Army during the Second Afghan War when on 11 December 1879 he carried out the actions for which he was awarded the VC. The citation was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 24 August 1881 (dated 26 August 1881) and read:

For the above actions Adams was recommended for the VC by General Sir Frederick Roberts. Along with the Presbyterian and Roman Catholic chaplains who also accompanied the force, Adams was three times mentioned in dispatches during the campaign. He received his medal from Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace on 1 December 1881.

==Later career and life==
In 1885 he accompanied the field force under General Roberts in Burma, and he took part in the operations there.

Returning to England he was the rector of Postwick (1887–94) and vicar of Stow Bardolph (1895–1902) in Norfolk. In 1902 he was instituted rector of Ashwell, Rutland.

Adams was appointed an honorary chaplain to the Prince of Wales on 7 May 1900, and following the Prince&#x27;s accession as King Edward VII he was confirmed in the post of honorary chaplain to the King on 23 July 1901. After the resignation of Reverend Handley Moule to become bishop in September 1901, Adams was appointed one of twelve chaplains-in-ordinary to the King.

Adams died on 20 October 1903 and was buried on 24 October in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Ashwell, Rutland where he was rector. His grave was restored in 2007.

On 16 August 1881 at Iver Heath, he married Alice Mary, eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Willshire, 1st Baronet; they had a daughter, Edith, who married Geoffry Northcote.

<doc id="726042" wikidata="Q317420" url="?curid=726042" title="Abdul Rahman al-Eryani">
<text>Abdul Rahman Yahya al-Eryani (; 10 June 1910 – 14 March 1998) was a Yemeni politician who served as the second President of the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen) from 5 November 1967 to 13 June 1974. Originally a leader of the Free Yemeni Movement opposition group during the time of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen, al-Eryani served as Minister of Religious Endowments under North Yemen&#x27;s first republican government and later became the only civilian politician to have led Northern Yemen. He was eventually overthrown by Ibrahim al-Hamdi and died in exile.

==Early life==
Abd al-Rahman al-Iryani was born in the village of Iryan in 1910. His father, Yahia al-Iryani, was the Chief Judge of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen and a highly regarded Sharia scholar. His mother, Salwa al-Iryani was well known for her charitable efforts in her village.

Abd al-Rahman started his education in his village Iryan until the age of 16 when he left for the capital Sanaa to study at its famous Sharia School. After a few years, he graduated and worked at the Imam Court until 1937 when he was appointed as a judge for the first time.

According to Yossi Melman of &quot;Haaretz&quot;, Dorit Mizrahi of the &quot;Mishpacha Magazine&quot;, and an article in the weekly &quot;HaOlam HaZeh&quot;, there are allegations that al-Iryani was born Zekharia Hadad to a Yemenite Jewish family in Ibb. According to this version, in 1918, there was a drought in Yemen, which had a severe effect on the Jews, who were generally worse off than the Arabs. Both his parents died, and he was then adopted by the al-Iryani, a powerful Muslim family, and was renamed &quot;Abd al-Rahman al-Iryani&quot; and converted to Islam. At that time, Yemen was ruled by Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din, who decreed that all orphaned Jewish children must be disconnected from their religion and be given over for adoption to a Muslim family.

According to &quot;YemenOnline&quot;, the claim of Jewish descent of Abd al-Rahman al-Iryani is a &quot;fantasy&quot;. According to this version, Abdul Rahman was not the adopted Zekharia, but his stepbrother. Furthermore, Abdul Raheem, who was close to his stepbrother, Abdul Rahman, was the real Zekharia Hadad. Abdul Raheem is said to have retired in Iryan before dying in 1980, and has dozens of surviving children and grandchildren.

==Participation in the Alwaziri coup==
Al-Eryani actively opposed the kings of the Kingdom of Yemen, helping to lead the Free Yemeni Movement in pushing for a republic. In February 1948, he participated in the Alwaziri coup against the then ruler of Yemen, Yahya Hamiduddin, aiming at the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. He was imprisoned for about 7 years after the failure of the revolution, which lasted only for 12 days. Al-Eryani was sentenced to death by beheading in 1955 for his activities with the Free Yemeni Movement. However, minutes before his execution, he was granted a reprieve by King Ahmed bin Yahya. He spent a total of 15 years in jail until his release in 1962.

==Term as President of North Yemen==
Abdul Rahman Al-Eryani opposed Egyptian and Saudi interference in Yemeni affairs and, with two of his colleagues, Ahmad Muhammad Numan and Mohamad Al-Zubairi, led a strong movement against Egyptian intervention in the North Yemen Civil War between republicans and royalists. He was held in Egypt with Numan in 1966 while their partner Al-Zubairi had been assassinated earlier.

In 1970, he arrived at a national conciliation agreement with the supporters of the royal regime and established a formal relation with Saudi Arabia. In 1972, he reached an agreement with South Yemen for the unification of the two parts of the country, which constituted the basic foundations for the unification of 1990. It was also during his regime that Yemen had parliamentary elections and permanent constitution for the first time.

Following Ibrahim al-Hamdi&#x27;s coup in 1974, al-Eryani went into exile in Syria. He eventually died in Damascus in 1998.

<doc id="726049" wikidata="Q725307" url="?curid=726049" title="Pharmacodynamics">
<text>Pharmacodynamics (PD) is the study of the biochemical and physiologic effects of drugs (especially pharmaceutical drugs). The effects can include those manifested within animals (including humans), microorganisms, or combinations of organisms (for example, infection).

Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are the main branches of pharmacology, being itself a topic of biology interested in the study of the interactions of both endogenous and exogenous chemical substances with living organisms.

In particular, pharmacodynamics is the study of how a drug affects an organism, whereas pharmacokinetics is the study of how the organism affects the drug. Both together influence dosing, benefit, and adverse effects. Pharmacodynamics is sometimes abbreviated as PD and pharmacokinetics as PK, especially in combined reference (for example, when speaking of PK/PD models).

Pharmacodynamics places particular emphasis on dose–response relationships, that is, the relationships between drug concentration and effect. One dominant example is drug-receptor interactions as modeled by

:&lt;chem&gt;L + R &lt;=&gt; LR &lt;/chem&gt;

where &quot;L&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, and &quot;LR&quot; represent ligand (drug), receptor, and ligand-receptor complex concentrations, respectively. This equation represents a simplified model of reaction dynamics that can be studied mathematically through tools such as free energy maps.

==Basics==
There are four principal protein targets with which drugs can interact:

* Enzymes (e.g. neostigmine and acetyl cholinesterase)
** Inhibitors
** Inducers 
** Activators 
* Membrane carriers [Reuptake vs Efflux] (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants and catecholamine uptake-1)
** Enhancer (RE)
** Inhibitor (RI)
** Releaser (RA)
* Ion channels (e.g. nimodipine and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels)
** Blocker
** Opener
* Receptor (e.g. Listed in table below)
** Agonists can be full, partial or inverse.
** Antagonists can be competitive, non-competitive, or uncompetive.
** Allosteric modulator can have 3 effects within a receptor. One is its capability or incapability to activate a receptor (2 possibilities). The other two are agonist affinity and efficacy. They may be increased, decreased or unaffected (3 and 3 possibilities).
&quot;NMBD = neuromuscular blocking drugs; NMDA = N-methyl-d-aspartate; EGF = epidermal growth factor.&quot;

== Effects on the body ==
The majority of drugs either 
There are 7 main drug actions:
*stimulating action through direct receptor agonism and downstream effects
*depressing action through direct receptor agonism and downstream effects (ex.: inverse agonist)
*blocking/antagonizing action (as with silent antagonists), the drug binds the receptor but does not activate it
*stabilizing action, the drug seems to act neither as a stimulant or as a depressant (ex.: some drugs possess receptor activity that allows them to stabilize general receptor activation, like buprenorphine in opioid dependent individuals or aripiprazole in schizophrenia, all depending on the dose and the recipient)
*exchanging/replacing substances or accumulating them to form a reserve (ex.: glycogen storage)
*direct beneficial chemical reaction as in free radical scavenging
*direct harmful chemical reaction which might result in damage or destruction of the cells, through induced toxic or lethal damage (cytotoxicity or irritation)

===Desired activity===
The desired activity of a drug is mainly due to successful targeting of one of the following:
*Cellular membrane disruption
*Chemical reaction with downstream effects
*Interaction with enzyme proteins
*Interaction with structural proteins
*Interaction with carrier proteins
*Interaction with ion channels
*Ligand binding to receptors:
**Hormone receptors
**Neuromodulator receptors
**Neurotransmitter receptors

General anesthetics were once thought to work by disordering the neural membranes, thereby altering the Na+ influx. Antacids and chelating agents combine chemically in the body. Enzyme-substrate binding is a way to alter the production or metabolism of key endogenous chemicals, for example aspirin irreversibly inhibits the enzyme prostaglandin synthetase (cyclooxygenase) thereby preventing inflammatory response. Colchicine, a drug for gout, interferes with the function of the structural protein tubulin, while digitalis, a drug still used in heart failure, inhibits the activity of the carrier molecule, Na-K-ATPase pump. The widest class of drugs act as ligands that bind to receptors that determine cellular effects. Upon drug binding, receptors can elicit their normal action (agonist), blocked action (antagonist), or even action opposite to normal (inverse agonist).

In principle, a pharmacologist would aim for a target plasma concentration of the drug for a desired level of response. In reality, there are many factors affecting this goal. Pharmacokinetic factors determine peak concentrations, and concentrations cannot be maintained with absolute consistency because of metabolic breakdown and excretory clearance. Genetic factors may exist which would alter metabolism or drug action itself, and a patient&#x27;s immediate status may also affect indicated dosage.

===Undesirable effects=== 
Undesirable effects of a drug include:
*Increased probability of cell mutation (carcinogenic activity)
*A multitude of simultaneous assorted actions which may be deleterious
*Interaction (additive, multiplicative, or metabolic)
*Induced physiological damage, or abnormal chronic conditions

===Therapeutic window===

The therapeutic window is the amount of a medication between the amount that gives an effect (effective dose) and the amount that gives more adverse effects than desired effects. For instance, medication with a small pharmaceutical window must be administered with care and control, e.g. by frequently measuring blood concentration of the drug, since it easily loses effects or gives adverse effects.

===Duration of action===
The &quot;duration of action&quot; of a drug is the length of time that particular drug is effective. Duration of action is a function of several parameters including plasma half-life, the time to equilibrate between plasma and target compartments, and the off rate of the drug from its biological target.

==== Recreational drug use ====

In recreational psychoactive drug spaces, duration refers to the length of time over which the subjective effects of a psychoactive substance manifest themselves. 
Duration can be broken down into 6 parts: (1) total duration (2) onset (3) come up (4) peak (5) offset and (6) after effects. Depending upon the substance consumed, each of these occurs in a separate and continuous fashion.

====Total====
The total duration of a substance can be defined as the amount of time it takes for the effects of a substance to completely wear off into sobriety, starting from the moment the substance is first administered.

====Onset====
The onset phase can be defined as the period until the very first changes in perception (i.e. &quot;first alerts&quot;) are able to be detected.

====Come up====
The &quot;come up&quot; phase can be defined as the period between the first noticeable changes in perception and the point of highest subjective intensity. This is colloquially known as &quot;coming up.&quot;

====Peak====
The peak phase can be defined as period of time in which the intensity of the substance&#x27;s effects are at its height.

====Offset====
The offset phase can be defined as the amount of time in between the conclusion of the peak and shifting into a sober state. This is colloquially referred to as &quot;coming down.&quot;

====After effects====
The after effects can be defined as any residual effects which may remain after the experience has reached its conclusion. After effects depend on the substance and usage. This is colloquially known as a &quot;hangover&quot; for negative after effects of substances, such as alcohol, cocaine, and MDMA or an &quot;afterglow&quot; for describing a typically positive, pleasant effect, typically found in substances such as cannabis, LSD in low to high doses, and ketamine.

==Receptor binding and effect==
The binding of ligands (drug) to receptors is governed by the &quot;law of mass action&quot; which relates the large-scale status to the rate of numerous molecular processes. The rates of formation and un-formation can be used to determine the equilibrium concentration of bound receptors. The &quot;equilibrium dissociation constant&quot; is defined by:
:&lt;chem&gt;L + R &lt;=&gt; LR &lt;/chem&gt;                      formula_1
where &quot;L&quot;=ligand, &quot;R&quot;=receptor, square brackets [] denote concentration. The fraction of bound receptors is

:formula_2

Where formula_3 is the fraction of receptor bound by the ligand.

This expression is one way to consider the effect of a drug, in which the response is related to the fraction of bound receptors (see: Hill equation). The fraction of bound receptors is known as occupancy. The relationship between occupancy and pharmacological response is usually non-linear. This explains the so-called &quot;receptor reserve&quot; phenomenon i.e. the concentration producing 50% occupancy is typically higher than the concentration producing 50% of maximum response. More precisely, receptor reserve refers to a phenomenon whereby stimulation of only a fraction of the whole receptor population apparently elicits the maximal effect achievable in a particular tissue.

The simplest interpretation of receptor reserve is that it is a model that states there are excess receptors on the cell surface than what is necessary for full effect. Taking a more sophisticated approach, receptor reserve is an integrative measure of the response-inducing capacity of an agonist (in some receptor models it is termed intrinsic efficacy or intrinsic activity) and of the signal amplification capacity of the corresponding receptor (and its downstream signaling pathways). Thus, the existence (and magnitude) of receptor reserve depends on the agonist (efficacy), tissue (signal amplification ability) and measured effect (pathways activated to cause signal amplification). As receptor reserve is very sensitive to agonist&#x27;s intrinsic efficacy, it is usually defined only for full (high-efficacy) agonists.

Often the response is determined as a function of log[&quot;L&quot;] to consider many orders of magnitude of concentration. However, there is no biological or physical theory that relates effects to the log of concentration. It is just convenient for graphing purposes. It is useful to note that 50% of the receptors are bound when [&quot;L&quot;]=&quot;Kd&quot; .

The graph shown represents the conc-response for two hypothetical receptor agonists, plotted in a semi-log fashion. The curve toward the left represents a higher potency (potency arrow does not indicate direction of increase) since lower concentrations are needed for a given response. The effect increases as a function of concentration.

== Multicellular pharmacodynamics ==
The concept of pharmacodynamics has been expanded to include Multicellular Pharmacodynamics (MCPD). MCPD is the study of the static and dynamic properties and relationships between a set of drugs and a dynamic and diverse multicellular four-dimensional organization. It is the study of the workings of a drug on a minimal multicellular system (mMCS), both &quot;in vivo&quot; and &quot;in silico&quot;. Networked Multicellular Pharmacodynamics (Net-MCPD) further extends the concept of MCPD to model regulatory genomic networks together with signal transduction pathways, as part of a complex of interacting components in the cell.

== Toxicodynamics ==
Toxicodynamics (TD) and pharmacodynamics (PD) link a therapeutic agent or toxicant, or toxin (xenobiotic)&#x27;s dosage to the features, amount, and time course of its biological action. The mechanism of action is a crucial factor in determining effect and toxicity of the drug, taking in consideration the pharmacokinetic (PK) factors. The sort and extent of altered cellular physiology will depend on the combination of the drug&#x27;s presence (as established by pharmacokinetic (PK) studies) and/or its mechanism and duration of action (PD). Types of xenobiotic-target interaction can be described either by reversible, irreversible, noncompetitive, and allosteric interaction or agonist, partial agonist, antagonist, and inverse interactions. &quot;In vitro, ex vivo,&quot; or &quot;in vivo&quot; studies can be used to assess PD and TD from the molecule to the level of the entire organism. 

The mechanism of drug action and adverse drug reaction is either physiochemical property based and biochemical based. Adverse drugs reactions can be classified as either idiosyncratic (type B) or intrinsic (type A). Idiosyncratic toxicity is not dosage dependent and defy the mass-action relationship. Immune-mediated processes are frequently cited as the source of type B reactions. These cannot be accurately described in preclinical research or clinical trials due to their low incidence frequency. Type A reactions are dosage (concentration) dependent. Usually, this kind of side effect is an extension of an ongoing treatment.

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are termed toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics in the field of ecotoxicology. Here, the focus is on toxic effects on a wide range of organisms. The corresponding models are called toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic models.

<text>Vercelli (; ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; of 46,552 inhabitants (January 1, 2017) in the Province of Vercelli, Piedmont, northern Italy. One of the oldest urban sites in northern Italy, it was founded, according to most historians, around 600 BC.

The city is situated on the Sesia River in the plain of the Po River between Milan and Turin. It is an important centre for the cultivation of rice and is surrounded by rice paddies, which are flooded in the summer. The climate is typical of the Po Valley with cold, foggy winters ( in January) and oppressive heat during the summer months ( in July). Rainfall is most prevalent during the spring and autumn; thunderstorms are common in the summer.

The languages spoken in Vercelli are Italian and Piedmontese; the variety of Piedmontese native to the city is called &quot;Varsleis&quot;.

The world&#x27;s first university funded by public money was established in Vercelli in 1228 (the seventh university founded in Italy), but was closed in 1372. Today it has a university of literature and philosophy as a part of the Università del Piemonte Orientale and a satellite campus of the Politecnico di Torino.

== History ==
Vercellae (or &quot;Vercelum&quot;) was the capital of the &quot;Libici&quot; or &quot;Lebecili&quot;, a Ligurian tribe; it became an important municipium, near which Gaius Marius defeated the Cimbri and the Teutones in the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC.

The imperial magister militum Flavius Stilicho annihilated the Goths there 500 years later. It was half-ruined in St. Jerome&#x27;s time (&quot;olim potens, nunc raro habitatore semiruta&quot; (1, 3.1)). After the Lombard invasion it belonged to the Duchy of Ivrea. From 885 it was under the jurisdiction of the prince-bishop, who was a Count of the Empire.

It became an independent commune in 1120 and joined the first and second Lombard leagues. Its statutes are among the most interesting of those of the medieval republics. In 1197 they abolished the servitude of the glebe. In 1228 the University of Pavia was transferred to Vercelli, where it remained until the fourteenth century, but without gaining much prominence; only a university school of law has been maintained.

In 1307, Fra Dolcino, the leader of the Dulcinians, was tortured and burned at the stake.

During the troubles of the 13th century, it fell into the power of the Della Torre of Milan (1263), of the Marquesses of Monferrato (1277), who appointed Matteo I Visconti captain (1290–1299). The Tizzoni (Ghibellines) and Avogadri (Guelphs) disputed the city from 1301 to 1334. The Guelphs were expelled several times, enabling the Marquess of Monferrato to take Vercelli (1328), which voluntarily placed itself under the Viscount of Milan in 1334. In 1373, Bishop Giovanni Fieschi expelled the Visconti, but Matteo reconquered the city. Facino Cane (1402), profiting by the strife between Giovanni Maria and Filippo Maria Visconti, took Vercelli, but was driven out by Theodore II of Montferrat (1404), from whom the city passed to the dukes of Savoy (1427).

In 1499 and 1553 Vercelli was captured by the French, and in 1616 and 1678 by the Spaniards. In 1704 it sustained an energetic siege by the French, who failed to destroy the fortress, after which it shared the fortunes of Savoy. In 1821 Vercelli rose in favour of the Constitution.

== Main sights ==

Vercelli is home to numerous relics of the Roman period, e.g. an amphitheatre, hippodrome, sarcophagi, and many important inscriptions, some of which are Christian.

There are seven noteworthy towers in the town, the most important are the &quot;Torre dell’Angelo&quot;, which rears up over the old market square, and the &quot;Torre di Città&quot; in Via Gioberti.

Vercelli Cathedral, formerly adorned with precious pillars and mosaics, was erected and enlarged by Saint Eusebius of Vercelli, to whom it was dedicated after his death. It was remodelled as of the ninth century and radically changed in the eighteenth by Count Alfieri. Like the other churches in the city, it contains valuable paintings, especially those of Gaudenzio Ferrari, Gerolamo Giovenone and Bernardino Lanino, who were natives of Vercelli.

The cathedral&#x27;s Capitulary Library contains valuable manuscripts. Its religious texts include the Codex Vercellensis, an evangeliarium of the fourth century; hagiographical manuscripts, not all of which have been critically examined; and a very old copy of the &quot;Imitation of Christ&quot;, which is relied upon as an argument for attributing the authorship to John Gersen. Its secular texts include the &quot;Novels&quot; of Justinian; and the 8th-century &quot;Leges Langobardorum&quot; (Laws of the Lombards - Germanic). Finally, it contains the famous Vercelli Book — an Old English manuscript which includes the celebrated alliterative poem &quot;The Dream of the Rood&quot;. The civil archives are not less important and contain documents dating from 882.

The Basilica di Sant&#x27;Andrea was erected by Cardinal Guala Bicchieri in 1219. Together with the old Cistercian monastery, it is one of the most beautiful and best-preserved Romanesque monuments in Italy. Among other noteworthy churches in the city is the &quot;Santa Maria Maggiore&quot;.

Vercelli&#x27;s synagogue, an example of Moorish Revival architecture, is located at Via Foà 70 and the city&#x27;s Jewish cemetery at Corso Randaccio 24. On 23 November 2013, after what was believed to be an antisemitic act, two swastikas were found sprayed on its walls.

The Institute of the Beaux-Arts contains paintings by Vercellese artists.

Ancient charitable institutions continue, such as the hospital founded by Cardinal Guala Bicchieri (1224), which has an annual revenue of more than 600,000 lire ($117,000); and the hospices for orphan girls (1553) and for boys (1542), and mendicant homes.

Vercelli is the seat of the Viotti International Music Competition.

== Demographics ==

In 2007, 44,475 people were recorded as residing in Vercelli, of whom 47.3% were male and 52.7% were female. Minors (children aged 18 and younger) totalled 14.41% of the population and pensioners 25.83%; the overall national averages are, respectively, 18.06% and 19.94%. The average age of a Vercelli resident was 47 (five years more than the national average of 42) and the birth rate was 8.69 births per 1,000 inhabitants (national average of 9.45 births per 1,000 inhabitants). In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Vercelli declined by 1.31% while the national population grew by 3.56%.

, 92.38% of the population was Italian. The remainder were Albanian and Romanian (3.48%), North African (2.21%) and Sub-Saharan (0.64%). Approximately 1 in 6 babies born in Vercelli has at least one foreign parent.

<text>Brynjólfur Sveinsson (14 September 1605 – 5 August 1675) served as the Lutheran Bishop of the see of Skálholt in Iceland. His main influence has been on modern knowledge of Old Norse literature. Brynjólfur is also known for his support of the career of the Icelandic poet and hymn writer Hallgrímur Pétursson. Brynjólfur Sveinsson is currently pictured on the banknote.

Brynjólfur was born in Önundarfjörður in the Westfjords of northwestern Iceland. He studied at the University of Copenhagen from 1624 to 1629 and was Provost of Roskilde University from 1632 to 1638.

In 1643, he named the collection of Old Norse mythological and heroic poems &quot;Edda&quot;. Brynjólfur attributed the manuscript to Sæmundr fróði, but the scholarly consensus is that whoever wrote the Eddic poems, whether in the sense of being the compiler or the poet, it could not have been Sæmundr. It is believed that the manuscript has multiple authorship from over a long span of time.

In 1650 King Frederick III appointed Brynjólfur to succeed the late Stephanius as Royal Danish Historian. He declined the post but promised the king to do what he could to collect manuscripts in Iceland. One of his first acts was to request all people residing in his diocese to turn over to the King any old manuscripts, either an original or a copy, as a gift or for a price.

Among the most monumental of the Icelandic manuscripts thus collected is the &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot;, which was secured only after a personal visit to the owner from Brynjólfur. Jón Finnsson of Flatey, Breiðafjörður, who owned the manuscript, was initially unwilling to give up his precious heirloom. After a personal visit and persuasion from Brynjólfur, Finnsson gave up the valuable manuscript. The manuscript was given to King Frederick III in 1656, and placed in the Royal Library of Copenhagen.

==Brynjólfur Sveinsson in fiction==
The novel &quot;Brynjólfur Sveinsson biskup&quot; by Torfhildur Þorsteinsdóttir Hólm, first published in 1882, is based on the life of the historical Brynjólfsson Sveinsson.

Numan was a descendant of a family of important shaykhs in al-Hujariyya, a province in the southern highlands southeast of the department of Ta&#x27;izz. Numan&#x27;s uncle, Abd al-Wahhab Numan, was the Ottoman-appointed &quot;hakim&quot; (governor) of the region. The Numans were Sunni, specifically Shafi&#x27;i. Numan&#x27;s father was a farmer.

Numan was educated in the traditional Islamic &quot;kuttab&quot; elementary school. He spent seven years at the University of Zabid. After his father&#x27;s death in 1934, Numan assumed the role of head of household, in which capacity he gained the respect of fellow villagers and came into contact with local officials.

=== Career as educator ===

In the mid-1930s, Numan met Muhammad Ahmad al-Haydara, who had studied abroad and had been exposed to subjects beyond Numan&#x27;s limited Islamic education. The two began a school in Dubhan, &quot;al-Madrassa al-Ahliyya&quot;, specifically for young teenage boys. The school became famous for teaching geography, arithmetic and modern sciences. The school also soon became a local center for the discussion of current events. Much of the material came from books and newspapers supplied by Numan&#x27;s brother Ali, who worked in Aden. The regulars who attended the discussions came to be known as &quot;Nadi a-Islah&quot; (the &quot;Reform Group&quot;). Unlike reform-minded intellectuals in the capital of Sana&#x27;a, the Dubhan group was made up of peasant farmers.

Numan&#x27;s school attracted notice. In 1935, Ahmad al Muta, then an examination inspector for the Ministry of Education, met Numan. Al-Muta was an outspoken advocate for reform, for which he was removed from the Army and as editor of the Imam&#x27;s official newspaper. After the Imam&#x27;s defeat in the border war with Saudi Arabia al-Muta had formed the secret &quot;Hay&#x27;at al Nidal&quot; (the Committee of the Struggle&quot;) to resist a conservative backlash. Al-Muta tried to attach Numan&#x27;s groups to that organization.

In 1936 the Imam dispatched his son Sayf al-Islam Qasim to visit the school. Accompanying him were the Governor of Ta&#x27;izz Sayyid Ali al-Wazir and the poet Muhammad al-Zubayri. The report must have pleased the Imam inasmuch as he recommended it to an Egyptian education delegation. Complaints from conservatives, however, led to the appointment of a traditional instructor to teach Zaidi doctrines. And when the Imam&#x27;s secret police discovered the &quot;Hay&#x27;at al Nidal&quot; and arrested al-Muta, Numan was placed under house arrest in Ta&#x27;izz.

=== Activities in Cairo ===

On release from arrest, Numan travelled to Cairo. He later said that while under arrest he developed his ambition to be a political leader. He left Dhjubhan in 1937 and travelled to Cairo by way of Lahej and Aden. Numan&#x27;s original goal was to attend King Fuad I University but was refused admission because he lacked qualifications in modern subjects. Instead Numan reluctantly attended al-Azhar University, which he feared would simply duplicate the Islamic education he received at Zabid. Instead, he encountered modern Arab political thought. The university was a center of Muslim Brotherhood activity, who were particularly interested in Yemen, owing to its isolation, as a suitable test for governance according to &quot;shari&#x27;a&quot;. At al-Azhar Numan made the acquaintance of Ali al-Tahir, a Palestinian newspaper publisher in Cairo. It was through al-Tahir that Numan met Shakib Arslan.
Arslan soon took Numan under his wing. Arslan&#x27;s interest in the Yemen went back to his attempted mediation of the Saudi-Yemen war of 1934. At the time he was shocked by the backwardness of Yemen, and persuaded the Imam to employ advisers (from the same Lebanese Druze community that he came from. For similar reasons he hired Numan as his secretary in 1939.

While working for Arslan and writing for &quot;al-&#x27;Alam&quot;, Numan also wrote pamphlets. His first contribution was an introduction to &quot;The Journey of H.H. Prince Sayf al-Islam the Great Crown Prince of Yemen&quot; by Sayyid Husayn al-Yamani in 1937. He also wrote two pamphlets mainly about his treatment by Sayyid Ali al-Wazir, the governor of Ta&#x27;izz: &quot;The First Moan&quot; (1948) and &quot;A Few Words on the Outrages of Ali al-Wazir&quot; (1939), both of which also criticized the government of Yemen in general.

In March 1940 the poet Muhammad al-Zubayri arrived in Cairo. Although al-Zubayri&#x27;s patron was Ali al-Wazir, the former governor of Ta&#x27;izz against whom Numan&#x27;s pamphlets were directed, al-Zubayri sought out Numan (whom he had once before met when he accompanied Ahmad al Muta to inspect Numan&#x27;s school). Although the poet had no background in reform politics or anti-imamic agitation and spent his first few months in Cairo writing poetry and reading at Dar al-Ulum University, he was gradually drawn into the orb of Yemeni dissidents. In mid-1940 al-Zubayri and Numan formed &quot;al-Katiba al-Ula&quot; (the &quot;First Battalion&quot;), a discussion group focusing on plans for reform of Yemen. The members contributed articles to the Cairo press.

In 1941 Arslan decided to return to Switzerland and invited Numan to join him. But Numan&#x27;s travel documents were not in order, and he decided to return to Aden instead.

=== Numan among the &quot;shabab&quot; ===

When Numan returned to Yemen at the end of February 1941, Crown Prince Ahmad bin Yahya, whom his father the Imam appointed Governor of Ta&#x27;izz in place of Ali al-Wazir, appointed him inspector of the province&#x27;s primary schools. Numan remained in contact with al-Zubayri, who continued the meetings of &quot;al-Katiba&quot;, changing its name, however, to &quot;Shabab al-Amr&quot;, based on the title of the reform manifesto he was writing: &quot;al-Barnamij al-Awwal min Baramij Shabab al-Amr bi&#x27;l-Ma&#x27;ruf wa &#x27;l-Nahi &#x27;an al-Mankur&quot; (&quot;The First Programme of the Youths for Promoting the Good and Preventing the Bad&quot;), a title based on the Quranic expression suggesting government by the &quot;ummah&quot;. In August al-Zubayri arrived in Ta&#x27;izz with his Programme and would later be joined by other of the &quot;shabab&quot; from Cairo. Before his arrival al-Zubayri had consulted with Ahmad al Muta and several associates in Sana&#x27;a and had written to Numan of his plan to present the &quot;Barnamij&quot; to the Imam. Numan counsel him against doing so on the ground that public support had not been sufficiently organized to risk a confrontation with the Imam.

Disregarding Numan&#x27;s advice, al-Zubayri proceeded with his plan. The Imam exploded with rage and charged him with &quot;offence against Islam.&quot; He set up a board to try al-Zubaryi, which included the &quot;unnamah,&quot; including Zayd al-Daylami of the Sana&#x27;a appeal court and notables such as former Governor of Ta&#x27;izz Ali al-Wazir and his son Abdullah al-Wazir (whom he suspected of using al-Zubayri to promote their own ambitions for the imamate). During the trial persons associated with the &quot;Shabab al-Amr&quot; distributed hand-written pamphlets supporting al-Zubayri. The Imam cracked down on the protests and ordered two waves of imprisonments in December 1941 and January 1942. The Board acquitted al-Zubayri in defiance of the Imam. The protestors were left in jail, however. Most were released in April 1942, but al-Zubayri was not freed until September 1942.

=== Offices in the Yemen Arab Republic ===

Numan&#x27;s first term as prime minister was under President Abdullah al-Sallal. Numan served for less than three months, from 20 April to 6 July 1965. His second term was under President Abdul Rahman al-Iryani, this time lasting less than four months, from 3 May to 24 August 1971.

Numan withdrew from politics completely when his son Muhammad Ahmad Numan was assassinated. He spent the rest of his life in Saudi Arabia and Cairo.

<text>The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (also known as the Scottish SPCA and SSPCA) is a charity to promote animal welfare in Scotland.

==History and operations==
It was founded in Edinburgh in 1839 and one of its first aims was to improve the welfare of cart-horses. Over the next century and a half, the charity grew and merged with other local SPCAs, such as the Dundee SPCA, Glasgow and West of Scotland SPCA and Aberdeen SPCA.

The Scottish SPCA opened its first centre in Mansfield, Balerno, in 1930. It acted as a Rest Farm for Horses which provided many working horses and ponies a period of rest before being returned to work. It now has 10 animal rescue centres which treat over 12,000 animals a year, with its headquarters and animal helpline based in Dunfermline.

As an animal welfare charity, the society receives no government or lottery funding and relies on public donations to continue their work rescuing and rehoming mistreated animals in Scotland.

The Scottish SPCA is the only animal welfare charity in the United Kingdom that is a specialist reporting agency to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. This enables it to lay reports for prosecutions, given there is no effective system of private prosecution in Scotland. This power is coupled with the designation of the Scottish SPCA&#x27;s inspectors under section 49(2)(a) of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006, which enables SSPCA Inspectors to exercise powers of entry, search, seizure and issue of binding notices under the Act, such as &quot;care notices&quot;. The Scottish SPCA is the only animal welfare organisation in Great Britain to have such powers.

In promoting prevention of cruelty, the Scottish SPCA is unique in running a free visiting education service for schools, tying in extensively with the Scottish curriculum. Since devolution, the Scottish SPCA has been at the forefront of campaigning in the Scottish Parliament for improved animal protection laws in Scotland and were prominent advisors on the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Bill which obtained Royal Assent in May 2006.

===Relationship with RSPCA===

The Scottish SPCA is often confused with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). Although the two societies both work with animal welfare, the RSPCA operates only in England and Wales while the Scottish SPCA covers Scotland. Both charities are entirely separate from each other. The RSPCA has been criticised by the Scottish SPCA for fund-raising in Scotland and thereby &quot;stealing food from the mouths of animals north of the border by taking donations intended for Scotland&quot;. The RSPCA insists that it does not deliberately advertise in Scotland but that many satellite channels only enabled the organisation to purchase UK-wide advertising.

In a statement, the RSPCA said it went &quot;to great lengths&quot; to ensure wherever possible that adverts were not distributed outside England and Wales. It said: &quot;Every piece of printed literature, television advertising and internet banner advertising always features the wording &#x27;The RSPCA is a charity registered in England and Wales. &quot;All Scottish donors, who contact us via RSPCA fundraising campaigns, are directed to the Scottish SPCA so that they can donate to them if they so wish.&quot; A memorandum was signed between the Scottish SPCA and the RSPCA that any legacies left to the &quot;Scottish RSPCA&quot; or &quot;RSPCA Scotland&quot; would, unless evidence existed to the contrary, be given to the Scottish SPCA.

The Scottish SPCA changed its logo in 2005 to make a clearer distinction between itself and the RSPCA in an attempt to prevent legacies being left to its English &amp; Welsh equivalent by mistake when the Scottish charity was intended.

<text>The League of Polish Families (Polish: &quot;Liga Polskich Rodzin,&quot; , LPR) is a social conservative political party in Poland, with many far-right elements in the past. The party&#x27;s original ideology was that of the National Democracy movement which was headed by Roman Dmowski, however, in 2006 its leader Roman Giertych distanced himself from that heritage.

It was represented in the Polish parliament, forming part of the cabinet of Jarosław Kaczyński until the latter dissolved in September 2007. In the 2007 parliamentary election, it failed to gain the 5% threshold required to enter the Sejm and lost all its seats, even failing to cross the 3% threshold for eligibility to receive government funding. Since then, the party has become a minor political force, but continues to exist.

The All-Polish Youth used to be affiliated with the party as its youth wing, but these two organisations later severed their relations.

== History ==
The LPR was created just before the elections in 2001 and gained 8% of the vote, giving it 38 out of 460 seats in the Sejm and two seats in the Senate. Its former leader, Roman Giertych, studied Law and History at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań. During his career his political alliances have included such Polish National Democrats as Jan Łopuszański, Antoni Macierewicz, Gabriel Janowski.

Roman Giertych reactivated the &quot;All-Polish Youth&quot; (&quot;Młodzież Wszechpolska&quot;) organisation in 1989, becoming its chairman; he remains honorary chairman. For several years he was a member of the National-Democratic Party (&quot;Stronnictwo Narodowo-Demokratyczne&quot;) and the National Party (&quot;Stronnictwo Narodowe&quot;), which merged with several other organisations to form the League of Polish Families (&quot;Liga Polskich Rodzin&quot;, LPR) in 2001.

Roman Giertych&#x27;s father, Maciej Giertych, also a member of LPR, is a former member of the European Parliament. His grandfather was a member of parliament of the Second Polish Republic prior to World War II from the National Democracy Party. Some sources claim that the LPR owes much of its success to Radio Maryja, a Catholic radio station with a nationalist, ultra-conservative agenda.

The performance of League of Polish Families in the September 2001 elections, has been partly attributed to its well publicized and uncompromising attitude towards the Jedwabne pogrom. During the election campaign Ryszard Bender, one of the LPR founders and leaders, participated in LPR television broadcasts denying the facts of the Jedwabne pogrom of 1941 and accusing President Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who participated in commemoration ceremony, that took place in the village of Jedwabne in July 2001, of bowing to Jewish interest groups.

Soon after the election in 2001 a group of deputies separated from LPR, creating a new party known now as Polish Agreement led by Jan Łopuszański and Catholic-National Movement (Ruch Katolicko-Narodowy) led by Antoni Macierewicz.

In the 2004 elections to the European Parliament, LPR received 15,2% votes, which gave it 10 out of 54 seats reserved for Poland in the European Parliament. This made the LPR the second-largest party in Poland in that election, second only to the liberal conservative Civic Platform (PO), and well ahead of the then ruling post-communist Democratic Left Alliance, the populist Samoobrona and the conservative Law and Justice (PiS). However, the overall turnout of that election was less than 20% of eligible voters. Thus, the long-term significance of the LPR&#x27;s strong performance in that election is unclear. In the 2005 elections, LPR again received 8% of votes, but saw its seats reduced from 38 to 34. However, it gained five seats in the Senate, taking it up to seven.

The 2005 election produced no clear winner, producing a political gridlock and a possibility of new elections. The two largest parties, PiS and PO, entered negotiatons in order to form a &quot;grand coaliton&quot;. The PiS-PO coalition was supported by 44% of PiS voters and 78% of PO voters. However, PO broke off negotiations - PO complained that although PiS offered it half of the Polish 16 ministries, none of them included the so-called &quot;power-ministries&quot; (interior, justice and secret services), which led to fears that PiS would abuse its control over the Polish justice system. PO also noted that PiS had been shifting to the left economically, whereas PO was staunchly neoliberal.

Ultimately, PiS settled down for a minority government, composed entirely of PiS members. However, the party began losing popular support in 2006, which eventually forced it to form a &quot;stabilization pact&quot; with League of Polish Families and Samoobrona. All three parties were, to varying degrees, socially conservative and economically left-leaning. For its part, LPR demanded the withdrawal of the Polish army from Iraq, renegotiation of the EU accession treaty, as well as &quot;pro-family&quot; economic policy. 

However, the coalition broke down in August 2007 - PiS sought to &quot;neutralize&quot; LPR and Samoobrona, aware of a significant overlap between the voter bases of all parties involved. To this end, PiS arranged a sting operation against the leader of Samoobrona, Andrzej Lepper, in order to expose his supposed bribery. The plot failed, and PiS expelled Samoobrona from the government. LPR also abandoned the coalition, accusing PiS of abandoning what LPR called the “national-socialist program” that all three parties agreed to in the stabilization pact. 

Samoobrona and LPR then joined forces to form a single formation, the League and Self-Defense (LiS). Initially, LiS was seen positively by the press and the electorate - political scientist Andrzej Rychard argued that it had a chance to become &quot;a better PiS&quot;, outflank on left-wing economic appeal, and attract voters nostalgic towards communism. In the summer of 2007, LiS was polling as much as 23%. However, the formation rapidly declined in polls as Samoobrona and LPR clashed with each other, which led to dissolution of LiS in September 2007. 

Ultimately, Samoobrona and LPR ran separately. In the 2007 Parliamentary election, both parties failed to gain the 5% of votes required to enter the Sejm and lost all its seats, in addition to failing meeting the 3% of votes requirement for eligibility to receive government funding. The leader of LPR, Roman Giertych, stepped down from his post as the party&#x27;s leader, while Lepper died in 2011. The left-wing populist appeal of Samoobrona was taken and consolidated by PiS. Likewise, PiS &quot;neutralized&quot; LPR by appropriating its Catholic nationalist rhetoric and sociocultural stances. 

Some present or former members of LPR (including Janusz Dobrosz) and five of its MEPs moved to &quot;Forward Poland&quot; in 2008/9.

In the 2010s, the party became more moderate and changed its attitude towards the European Union. In parliamentary and presidential elections, it usually supports the candidates of the Civic Platform or the Polish People&#x27;s Party. In 2019, LPR declared its accession to the European Coalition. Roman Giertych is an active politician in the ruling coalition, and has stated successfully ran for the Sejm in the 2023 Polish parliamentary election as part of the Civic Coalition.
== Ideology ==

The party was described as belonging to the populist current in European politics, that juxtaposes the &#x27;simple man&#x27; and the &#x27;corrupt elite&#x27;.

The Journal of Communist Studies and Transition Politics described the party as clerical-nationalist, the party&#x27;s agenda combining conservative social values, Christian solidarity and nationalism. Adam Michnik has characterized the groups that formed the party as the heirs of the chauvinist, xenophobic and antisemitic organizations of the pre-war Poland.

The party takes economically anti-capitalist stances, campaigning on re-nationalization of the Polish economy, promoting welfare programs, and strongly opposing cuts in social spending and taxation. Its economic stances are based on the party&#x27;s own interpretation of the Catholic social teaching. containing many populist as well as socialist policies and proposals.
===Economic issues===
Economically, the party takes an interventionist and anti-capitalist stance. It is strongly critical of Balcerowicz Plan, the neoliberal economic reforms that transitioned Polish economy to free-market capitalism in the 1990s. LPR argues that it enrichened very few, creating oligarchs in Poland who formed local &quot;capital empires&quot;, called &quot;children of Balcerowicz&quot; by the party. The party contrasts them with the &#x27;victims of Balcerowicz&#x27;, such as the farmers, unemployed, poor and disadvantaged, who were &quot;were robbed by Balcerowicz financial politics&quot;. The party supports economic interventionism and nationalization of the economy - it is strongly opposed to privatization and cuts in social welfare, and calls for expelling foreign firms and capital from the Polish economy. LPR called for nationalization of several economic sectors such as the banking, energy, oil, mining, telecommunication and transport industries. It denounced privatization, especially of sectors such as insurance and healthcare, denouncing such proposals as social Darwinism and &quot;Neo-Malthusianism&quot;.

According to political scientists Tomasz Zarycki and George Kolankiewicz, LPR holds &quot;objectively left-wing views on issues such as privatisation, state intervention in the economy and redistribution of wealth&quot;, combined with &quot;strong opposition to Polish EU membership and, more generally, a nationalist and anti-cosmopolitan worldview.&quot; Similarly, Oliver Kossack argued that LPR is &quot;clearly positioned on the left end of the socio-economic spectrum&quot;. Some also called LPR the &quot;national left&quot;, which was also a classification applied to Samoobrona. 

The party supports for the &quot;defense of Polish property&quot; through nationalization of most Polish industries, development of domestic agriculture via state intervention and protectionist measures, as well as creating a economy that would prioritize care for Polish families and the homeless. It claims to be a voice of the disadvantaged groups that became the &quot;losers&quot; of socioeconomic changes in Poland, caused by globalization, privatization and austerity. LPR rejects capitalism as a system that causes the &quot;McDonaldization of the planet&quot;; it also condemns neoliberalism and the tradition of economic liberalism in general as &quot;lumpenliberalism&quot; that is characterized by consumptionism and hedonism rather than serving the needs of the poor and disadvantaged. It postulates the creation of an extensive system of welfare and social protection. Political scientist Tim Bale described LPR as an overtly anti-capitalist party, and Ashley Timidaiski considers the economic ideology of the LPR to be a combination of populism and socialism.

LPR argues that after 1989, Polish economy should have remained state-owned, and made to serve the interests of the Polish nation. The party considers the privatization of crucial industries such as the energy, mining, road and railway industries particularly detrimental to the interests of Polish people. It accused the cabinets that carried out privatization to have sold the Polish economy to foreign capital for personal gain and causing widespread poverty and misery. It also harshly attacked privatization of the armaments industry, concluding that the Polish transition of capitalism was &quot;economic colonialism&quot;. It decried privatization as &quot;pathological&quot; and undemocratic, arguing that any kind of privatization should have been voted on in the Sejm. The solution proposed by the party was renationalization of the Polish economy and a creation of investigative committees that would persecute and criminalize &quot;unfair&quot; and &quot;treasonous&quot; cases of privatization and deregulation.

In addition to its support of a state-owned industry, the party also envisioned an extensive spending program that would greatly increase spending on education and healthcare, as well as provide generous subsidies to core industrise as well as research in order to spur innovation. LPR believes that Poland should be self-sufficient in regards to energy and food, and prioritize the development of Polish agriculture. The agricultural proposals of the party include a referendum on banning foreign ownership of arable land in Poland, land reform that would break up large farms in favor of &quot;family farms&quot;, as well as a program that would guarantee full employment to the impoverished rural regions. LPR also postulated environmental improvements and development of biofuels in order to guarantee &quot;ecologically high&quot; quality of Polish agricultural products. The party consistently supported farmer protests, and spoke against suppressing them through police intervention.

The party is also highly protectionist, listing protection of Polish economy from foreign capital and competition as one of its main goals. According to LPR, Polish economic regulations favor foreign capital and suppress local industries; the party proposes to reverse the situation by heavily limiting the presence and possibilities of foreign capital in Poland, and introducing a package of reforms that would favor Polish producers over foreign ones. Foreign corporations in Poland are to be obliged to invest at least 50% of their profit from Poland to local economies. The party also attacked what it perceived to be a monopolizaton of the Polish economy, described as an emergence of large corporations and chain stores; LPR particularly called for regulation and extensive taxation of &quot;hypermarkets&quot; and supermarkets, and blamed them for the decline of family stores.
===Social issues===
Some of the policies the LPR opposes include: the selling of land to foreigners (especially German expellees), abolishing the draft, legalization of &quot;soft drugs&quot;, legalization of abortion, euthanasia, and gay marriage. It supports capital punishment, maintaining universal health care and public education, and supports the withdrawal of Polish troops from Iraq. The LPR also supports the publication of the complete archives of the Polish communist secret police—in other words, full &quot;de-Communization&quot;.

The party particularly appealed to voters sympathetic towards traditional social values, the Catholic faith, and the concept of Polish national sovereignty. Its policies also attract some who feel lost in the post-1989 political transformation of the country, although the populist Andrzej Lepper&#x27;s Samoobrona (&quot;Self Defense&quot;), also speaking out for the &#x27;simple man&#x27;, menaced by the post 1989 changes thus, appeal more directly to so-called marginalized voters. The press close to the party has published antisemitic articles; some of the Polish politicians like Adam Michnik have been characterized as pink hyenas representing non-Polish interests, assisted by Mossad and &quot;godless, satanical masons propagating nihilism and demoralisation.&quot; Those &quot;dark forces&quot; are said to be fiercely opposed to a Catholic state of the Polish nation.

The party was considered staunchly homophobic, and its opposition to same-sex marriage and several other demands of Polish gays and lesbians has led to condemnation of the party by the European Commission. It was also labelled as antisemitic by some authors.

In the 2010s, LPR ceased to arouse controversy and began gradually moving to the centre. The party is no longer xenophobic and Eurosceptic. Its views on religion have also become more moderate.

=== Stance towards the European Union ===
The party was anti-EU. &quot;The Economist&quot; reported in 2002 that the LPR spreads the word that the EU is a communist conspiracy. Although it was the only significant political force in Poland that unconditionally opposed Polish membership in the European Union (believing that a union controlled by social liberals could never be reformed), after Polish accession to the EU the party participated in European Parliament elections, in order to have actual influence over decisions made regarding Poland. During the 2004 controversy surrounding Rocco Buttiglione (the conservative Italian nominee as European Commissioner for &quot;Justice, Freedom, and Security&quot;), the LPR deputies demanded the dissolution of the parliament, feeling that it was too much under the influence of a homosexual lobby. . In 2004, 31 MEPs from the UK, Poland, Denmark and Sweden formed the new Independence/Democracy, formerly the group for Europe of Democracies and Diversities. The main goals of this group were the rejection of any European Constitution and opposition to any plans for a federal Europe. Currently, LPR is pro-European and considers membership in the European Union as the will of the Polish nation. Although it retains its nationalistic ideology, it mainly supports the EU.

<text>Muhammad Ali Haitham (7 March 1940 – 10 July 1993) () was the 2nd Prime Minister of the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen).

Haitham was appointed prime minister of the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen in 1969. He replaced Faysal al-Shaabi in the post. Salim Rubai Ali and the left wing of National Liberation Front (of which both Rubai and Haitham were members) took power in the country on 22 June 1969. Haitham was replaced with Ali Nasir Mohammed after he resigned from his post and left the country in August 1971.

Haitham then formed the United Yemen Front (a political movement against the socialist regime in South Yemen) and lived in exile until the unification of the two Yemens in 1990. He played an important role in helping Yemen to have its first parliamentary elections in April 1993. Haitham was appointed minister of social and labor affairs in May 1993.

Haitham died on 10 July 1993. His daughter, Sosan Ali Haitham, claim that he died due to a heart attack, but the circumstances of his death are still a source of debate today.

<text>Kenneth Hood &quot;Buddy&quot; MacKay Jr. (March 22, 1933 – December 31, 2024) was an American politician and diplomat who served as the 42nd governor of Florida from December 12, 1998, to January 5, 1999, upon the death of Lawton Chiles. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 14th lieutenant governor of Florida from 1991 to 1998. During his career, he also served as a state legislator and as a United States representative and special envoy. MacKay was the most recent Democratic Governor of Florida, and until his death in 2024, the last living one.

==Early life==
MacKay was born to a citrus-farming family in Ocala, Florida, the son of Julia Elizabeth (Farnum) and Kenneth Hood MacKay. He served in the United States Air Force during the 1950s, and then attended the University of Florida, where he was tapped into Florida Blue Key and eventually received a law degree. MacKay was inducted into the University of Florida Hall of Fame (the most prestigious honor a student can receive from UF) and was a member of The Board. He married Anne Selph in 1960; the couple has four sons.

==Political career==
MacKay was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 1968, and to the Florida Senate in 1974.

In 1980, he ran for U.S. Senate and came third in the Democratic Party primary, therefore failing to qualify for the runoff.

Two years later in 1982, he ran for the U.S. House of Representatives and won. From 1983 to 1989 he served for three terms in the United States House of Representatives.

In 1988 he received the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate, but lost in a very close race for that office to Connie Mack III.

===Lieutenant governorship===

MacKay won the 1990 Democratic primary for lieutenant governor on the ticket headed by former U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles, who had held the Senate seat MacKay had unsuccessfully sought two years earlier. They won the election and were re-elected in 1994, the latter campaign being a close contest against the Republican ticket headed by Jeb Bush.

As lieutenant governor, MacKay was co-chair of the Florida Commission on Education, Reform and Accountability. He was regarded as the most significant and powerful lieutenant governor in Florida&#x27;s history.

MacKay was a strong supporter of the use of capital punishment, as was Chiles. When he was asked during the 1998 gubernatorial election campaign about his positions on use of the death penalty and electric chair in Florida, he replied: &quot;I support the death penalty and support the use of the electric chair so long as it operates in a reliable fashion.&quot; However he suggested that Florida should change its mode of execution after Pedro Medina&#x27;s botched execution, saying: &quot;The last thing we want to do is generate sympathy for these killers.&quot;

===Gubernatorial campaign===
In 1998, MacKay sought to succeed the term-limited Chiles as governor, easily winning the Democratic nomination with his full support. However, MacKay secured only 44.7% of the vote, losing to Republican nominee Jeb Bush, who had narrowly lost the 1994 contest but secured 55.3% of the vote in 1998.

===Governorship===

Despite his defeat, MacKay became Chiles&#x27; successor when Chiles died unexpectedly on December 12, 1998. MacKay was at this time in Boston with his wife. When they returned to their hotel room, they found a message about Chiles&#x27; death, asking MacKay to get on a plane to Atlanta, where they were picked up by a state crew and flown through thick fog to Tallahassee. At 12.30 a.m. the next day, the 65-year-old MacKay was sworn in as Florida&#x27;s 42nd governor at his Capitol office for the 24 days remaining in Chiles&#x27; term.

&quot;There&#x27;s no great pleasure in this,&quot; said MacKay about taking a job he had sought, but got for a short time after his political partner&#x27;s death. He also stated how sorry he was that he would be unable because of the short time and lack of mandate to take care of such issues as education and health care.

Despite keeping a low public profile during his time as governor, MacKay made at least 56 appointments to various boards and to various offices, including two judgeships. He granted six pardons to female prisoners and was involved in such issues as the negotiation plan for the Everglades, and moderated some other disputes. Perhaps his most visible act as governor was signing Peggy Quince&#x27;s nomination to the Florida Supreme Court. Quince was Chiles&#x27; last pick for the bench and it fell to MacKay, and then Bush, to sustain her nomination.

MacKay was succeeded by Bush on January 5, 1999.

==Diplomacy==

After his governorship ended, MacKay retired from active politics, but remained publicly active.

MacKay was appointed by President Clinton as a special envoy for the Americas, being the second person to hold this position. During his tenure he traveled to 26 countries in the Americas, working on issues such as the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), hemispheric security, strengthening the rule of law, labor standards, environmental policies and human rights.

He attended a “Day with Florida Governors” symposium, organized by the University of Central Florida and Louis Frey Institute on March 27, 2006, with Governor Bush and former governors Claude Roy Kirk Jr., Reubin Askew, Bob Graham and Bob Martinez (Wayne Mixson, who served for three days after Graham&#x27;s resignation, wasn&#x27;t present).

==Personal life and death==
MacKay&#x27;s memoir about his political career, &quot;How Florida Happened&quot;, was published by the University Press of Florida in March 2010.

MacKay died at his home in Ocklawaha, Florida, on the afternoon of December 31, 2024.

<text>Herman Hupfeld (February 1, 1894June 8, 1951) was an American songwriter, whose most notable composition was the lyrics and music of &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;. 

==Life and career==
Hupfeld was born in Montclair, New Jersey, the son of Fredericka (Rader), a church organist, and Charles Ludwig Hupfeld. He was sent to study violin in Germany at age nine. Returning to the United States, he graduated from Montclair High School in 1915 and enlisted in the Navy during World War I. Following the war, he commenced a songwriting career. He entertained camps and hospitals during World War II.

Hupfeld never wrote a whole Broadway score, but became known as someone could write a song to fit a specific scene within a show. Besides &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, his best-known songs include &quot;Sing Something Simple&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Put Out the Lights (and Go to Sleep)&quot;, &quot;When Yuba Plays the Rumba on the Tuba&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Gotta Get Up and Go to Work&quot;, &quot;Are You Making Any Money?&quot;, &quot;Savage Serenade&quot;, &quot;Down the Old Back Road&quot;, &quot;A Hut in Hoboken&quot;, &quot;Night Owl&quot;, &quot;Honey Ma Love&quot;, &quot;Baby&#x27;s Blue&quot;, &quot;Untitled&quot; and &quot;The Calinda&quot;. While not known as a public performer, he is featured on a 78 rpm gramophone record with Victor Young &amp; his Orchestra, recorded on January 22, 1932, singing and playing piano on two of his compositions, &quot;Goopy Geer (he plays piano and he plays by ear)&quot; and &quot;Down the Old Back Road&quot;.

Hupfeld never married and lived with his mother in Montclair until his death by a stroke in 1951 at the age of 57. He was buried at Mount Hebron Cemetery, Montclair, New Jersey. His mother died six years later, aged 90. While Hupfeld was alive, their house was often visited by people from the world of entertainment, including Bing Crosby and Mae West. Crosby recorded &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; in 1943.

==&quot;As Time Goes By&quot;==
&quot;As Time Goes By&quot; is most famous from the film &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942). It was originally written for the Broadway show &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Welcome&quot; (1931), which ran for 139 performances. In 1931, the song was a modest hit, with versions issued on Victor, Columbia, Brunswick and the dime store labels.

The song was featured in the unproduced play &quot;Everybody Comes To Rick&#x27;s&quot;, the basis for the &quot;Casablanca&quot; story and script. Against the wishes of Max Steiner, who wrote the music for the film, it was decided to feature the song in the 1942 film. It has been well documented that the producers considered dropping the song in post-production but, since Ingrid Bergman had been given the part of Maria in Paramount&#x27;s &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; and had cut her hair for the part, it would not have been possible to reshoot her scenes in which the song was performed or to meet her request that Sam (Dooley Wilson) play a different song.

<text>Ibiraçu is the name of a municipality in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. It covers , and has a population of 12,591 with a population density of 66 inhabitants per square kilometer. 73% of the population resides in urban areas and 27% in rural areas. Ibiraçu borders on the municipalities of João Neiva (N), Santa Teresa (W), Fundão (S). It is located north of the state capital of Vitória.

The topography of Ibiraçu consists of rolling hills and some mountainous areas. Noted peaks in the municipality include Monte Negro, Morro Encantado, and Morro da Vargem.

==History==

Ibiraçu was founded in 1877 by a group of 54 families who departed from the Genoa region of northern Italy. After a voyage by steam boat of 35 days the immigrants arrived in the state capital of Vitória, were briefly quarantined, then traveled by boat and canoe to colonize the headwaters of the Piraqueaçu River. The area they settled was then known as Santa Cruz Colonial Nucleus (&quot;Núcleo Colonial Santa Cruz&quot;), since the most accessible town to it was Santa Cruz, at the mouth of the Piraqueaçu. The early settlers of the municipality were affected by the yellow fever outbreak of 1895, which both suspended further settlement of Espírito Santo and killed 41 members.

The capital of this area was first known as Conde D&#x27;eu, and was later known by many names such as Bocaiúva (after the proclamation of the republic), Vila Guaraná (after it became a municipality), Pau Gigante in 1892 (meaning &quot;giant tree&quot;, due to a large tree in the region), and only in 1942 did both the town and municipality gain Ibiraçu as their name. In recent history it is notable to mention the separation of João Neiva municipality.

==Monastery==

Morro da Vargem, a mountain at the south of Ibiraçu, is home to Mosteiro Zen Morro da Vargem, a Sōtō Zen Buddhist monastery. It was founded in 1974 and claims to be the first Buddhist monastery in South America. The monastery has focused on the reforestation of Morro da Vargem and the restoration of Atlantic Forest (&quot;Mata Atlântica&quot;) vegetation. In August 2021, the 35-meter-tall Buddha of Ibiraçu was inaugurated at the monastery&#x27;s Torii Square.

==Economy==

The cultivation of coffee and eucalyptus forms the basis of the economy of Ibiraçu. Fish farming is new to the municipality.

<text>Baba Zula (also stylized as BaBa ZuLa) is a Turkish alternative musical group, founded in Istanbul in 1996. With a wide variety of influences and a wide range of instruments, they create a unique psychedelic sound.

==History==
Founded in 1996, the band features Levent Akman and Osman Murat Ertel till today. Latest incarnation added Periklis Tsoukalas, Melike Şahin and Özgür Çakırlar. The other founder member Emre Onel was replaced by Coşar Kamçı in 2005. He was replaced by Özgür Çakırlar in 2012. BaBa ZuLa added live drawing artist Ceren Oykut into the mix in 2004. She left the band in 2010. Her presence onstage had added an important visual aspect to BaBa ZuLa&#x27;s live performances. Akman, Ertel, and Onel originally formed BaBa ZuLa as a side project of now disbanded psychedelic Anatolian rock group ZeN.

The group started performing internationally at the Kumanova Jazz Festival in 2003 and gradually started building an international audience as well as a cult following in Turkey.

In 2005 BaBa ZuLa was exposed to a wider international audience when they were featured in a documentary, &quot;Crossing the Bridge&quot; by Fatih Akin, which took an in-depth look at Istanbul&#x27;s contemporary and avant-garde music scene.

==Musical style==
Described as &quot;Turkey’s most beloved alternative music purveyors,&quot; Baba Zula create a unique psychedelic sound, combining traditional Turkish instruments, electronica, reggae, and dub. The core of their sound is the saz, a Turkish bouzouki-like stringed instrument with a bright, high-pitched sound. They use a revolutionary approach to electric saz, combining it both with retro and high-end electronic effects that creates an original sound never heard before until now.

BaBa ZuLa have performed at festivals such as The Spirit of Tengri (Almaty, Kazakhstan), Images of Middle East (multi-city Denmark tour), Roskilde Festival (Denmark), Sofia Film Festival (Bulgaria), Klinkende Munt Festival (Belgium), Printemps de Bourges (France), Cologne Triennale (Germany), Şimdi/Now Festival (Germany), Arezzo Wave Festival (Italy), the Venice Biennial (Italy), the Boost Festival (Netherlands), the Festival Islâmico (Mértola, Portugal) and the Era Nowe Horyzonty (Wrocław, Poland).

<text>El Torito (Spanish for &quot;the little bull&quot;) is an American chain that serves Mexican food. El Torito operates 25 restaurants all in California. El Torito is one of several Mexican cuisine restaurant chains operated by Xperience Restaurant Group.

Founded in 1954, El Torito claims to be &quot;a pioneer in the California full service Mexican casual dining restaurant segment.&quot;

==History==
El Torito was founded in 1954 by Larry J. Cano. Cano had served tours in the U.S Army in Europe and Korea, earned a business degree and worked tending bar. In 1954 he was managing a Polynesian restaurant. When the restaurant’s owner died, his widow gave Cano the restaurant. He began serving Mexican food at the restaurant and it became the first El Torito. Cano, at one point began struggling financially and moved into the restaurant.

Within three years the restaurant became successful, and Cano opened additional locations. By 1976 he had 20 locations, and sold the business to W. R. Grace and Company for about $20 million. They hired Cano as the president with a directive for rapid expansion.

Grace sold its restaurants in a leveraged buyout in 1986. The resulting firm, Restaurant Enterprises Group, Inc. (REGI), filed for bankruptcy in 1993. REGI was acquired out of bankruptcy in 1994 by Foodmaker, who renamed itself Family Restaurants, then Koo Koo Roo Enterprises, then Prandium. In 2000, Acapulco bought El Torito from Prandium. Acapulco renamed its parent company to Real Mex Restaurants in 2004 and moved the headquarters to Cypress, California.

In February 1994, engineers working on an extension of the CD-ROM specification visited El Torito in Irvine and later named the specification after the restaurant.

On October 3, 2011, Real Mex Restaurants filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and announced that it was putting itself up for sale, citing the poor economy as a reason. No plans were announced to close restaurants or layoff staff. It was acquired by a group of its noteholders in a bankruptcy auction in 2012.

In 2018, FM Restaurants HoldCo, LLC acquired Real Mex Restaurants out of bankruptcy and begun operating under Xperience Restaurant Group led by Randy Sharpe, former vice president of operations of the El Torito division. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the group begun renovating 19 of their 31 locations in Southern California.

<text>The Otselic River (aht-SEEL-ik), formerly known as Otselic Creek, is a tributary of the Tioughnioga River in central New York in the United States. It drains a hilly area, mostly forested and agricultural, east of the Finger Lakes at the northern edge of the Susquehanna River watershed.

Originally the Otselic Creek began at Hatch Lake in the Town of Eaton. 
When Hatch Lake was dammed in the 1830s to supply the Chenango Canal, all the lake water was diverted to the Chenango Valley to the east. The Otselic River now rises in Torpy Pond in southwestern Madison County, northeast of Georgetown, and meanders southwest through rich river bottom farmland. The Otselic Valley runs through Georgetown, Otselic, Pitcher, Cincinnatus, Willet, Lisle, and Whitney Point, where it is impounded to form Whitney Point Reservoir. Below the Whitney Point Dam, the Otselic River joins the Tioughnioga River from the northeast.

Formerly, several &quot;mill ditches&quot; diverted the river water to mills in the town of Otselic. One such present diversion is a dam above the hamlet of South Otselic which originally supplied a mill in the hamlet of South Otselic and later was piped to supply the present New York State South Otselic Fish Hatchery.

The Otselic River holds both native brook trout and stocked brown trout in the upper reaches and warmer water species such as smallmouth bass, walleyes and northern pike in the lower southern sections. Before the Otselic River was dammed in 1942 to form the Whitney Point Reservoir, eels and shad migrated up the Otselic River from the Susquehanna River.

<doc id="726134" wikidata="Q1428959" url="?curid=726134" title="Flipper (band)">
<text>Flipper is an American punk rock band formed in San Francisco, California in 1979, continuing in often erratic fashion until the mid-1990s, then reuniting in 2005. The band influenced a number of grunge, punk rock and noise rock bands. Their slowed-down, bass-driven and heavily distorted style of punk is considered to have inspired bands such as the Melvins and Nirvana, whose bass player Krist Novoselic played with the band in the 2000s.

==History==

===Early years (1979–1989)===

Flipper was founded by former Sleepers member Ricky Williams (vocals), former Rad Command member Ted Falconi (guitar), and former Negative Trend members Will Shatter (bass) and Steve DePace (drums). Founding member and original vocalist Williams was credited for naming the band, but was fired before it made any recordings. Bruce “Loose” Calderwood replaced Williams and he and Shatter then went on to trade vocal and bass duties, with both bringing a bass onstage. Falconi, a Vietnam War veteran, played a uniquely distorted style of guitar.

Flipper&#x27;s first recordings appeared in late 1979 on the &quot;SF Underground&quot; 7-inch EP released on the newly formed Subterranean Records, followed by the &quot;Love Canal&quot;/&quot;Ha Ha Ha&quot; 7-inch single in 1980.

 In 1981, the &quot;Sex Bomb&quot;/&quot;Brainwash&quot; single was released, featured individually hand-made covers. The lengthy A-side had minimal lyrics (&quot;She&#x27;s a sex bomb, my baby, yeah&quot;) and gained the band notoriety within the punk community. The original lineup released their first full-length album, &quot;Album – Generic Flipper&quot;, on Subterranean in 1982. It was recorded over a year and contained a new version of &quot;Sex Bomb&quot;. It was followed later in the year with another single on Subterranean, &quot;Get Away&quot;/&quot;The Old Lady that Swallowed the Fly&quot;.

The band regularly performed in the San Francisco area and attracted a large following. Simultaneously, their uniquely slowed-down and raucous approach to punk managed to infuriate other members of the local punk scene, especially with the burgeoning popularity of faster-paced hardcore punk. Mark Arm claimed, in the 2006 documentary &quot;American Hardcore&quot;, that Flipper&#x27;s charm as a band lay in their ability to upset audiences while attracting their undivided attention and curiosity at the same time. Fans began spray painting &quot;Flipper Rules&quot; in various locations around San Francisco and eventually the world.

In 1983, Flipper appeared in Rick Schmidt&#x27;s independent film, &quot;Emerald Cities&quot;. Footage of a live performance was interspersed throughout the film, showcasing three songs: &quot;One By One&quot;, &quot;Get Away&quot; and &quot;Love Canal&quot;.

A follow-up 1984 Subterranean studio album, &quot;Gone Fishin&#x27;&quot;, featured the opening track &quot;The Lights, the Sound, the Rhythm, the Noise&quot;, as well as &quot;Survivors of the Plague&quot; and &quot;Sacrifice&quot;. The colorful van on the cover, along with figures representing the band and their equipment, could be cut out and folded. Subterranean also offered extra covers through a small mail order fee. 

Also in 1984, the ROIR cassette label released &quot;Blow&#x27;n Chunks&quot;, a live document of a Flipper performance at CBGB. It included material from all phases of the band&#x27;s existence to that date. It was reissued on CD in 1990. A 2001 reissue included four outtakes from the live sessions.

Flipper titled their 1986 double live album &quot;Public Flipper Limited&quot;. The album unfolded into a board game with a cutout spinner and game cards, with Subterranean once again providing extra covers through mail order.

The original lineup splintered after a period of touring, and singer and core member Shatter died on December 9, 1987, of a drug overdose after forming A3I. Subterranean packaged the band&#x27;s singles and rarities as the 1988 collection &quot;Sex Bomb Baby&quot;. The cassette edition and later CD re-releases featured three bonus tracks.

===After Will Shatter (1990–1999)===
The band resurfaced in 1990 with a new single on Subterranean, &quot;Some Day&quot;/&quot;Distant Illusion&quot;, and began performing again. &quot;Nürnberg Fish Trials&quot;, another live album, was released in 1991. This lineup released an all-new studio album in 1992, &quot;American Grafishy&quot;, on Rick Rubin&#x27;s Def American imprint, which was not as well-received as their previous work. Also in 1992, founding member Ricky Williams also died of a heroin overdose. After the album was released, replacement bass player John Dougherty died of a drug overdose in 1997.

Rubin also reissued &quot;Album – Generic Flipper&quot; and the singles compilation &quot;Sex Bomb Baby&quot; on his Infinite Zero label. By 1997, Flipper&#x27;s music went largely out of print, with Rubin holding on to the rights. As part of a legal settlement, Subterranean was awarded the right to reissue its Flipper records on vinyl in the United States.

===Reformations (2002–present)===
In 2002, Loose (using a cane) returned for a one-off gig at Berkeley&#x27;s 924 Gilman Street space as &quot;Not Flipper&quot;. He stated that he had changed his name from Bruce Lose to Bruce Loose &quot;because he wanted to be less negative&quot;.

The original members of Flipper, save for the late Shatter (with Bruno DeSmartass again replacing Shatter, as he had done for a 1982 tour), reunited to support CBGB on August 22 and 28, 2005. This lineup then continued to perform live beginning in 2006.

In December 2006, DeSmartass was replaced by Novoselic (ex-Nirvana) on bass for a tour of the UK and Ireland, as well as several US shows. The song &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot;, which the band recorded (without Novoselic) for a 2000 Nirvana tribute album, was added to the band&#x27;s setlist.

In 2008, the band recorded a new album with Novoselic, On May 19, 2009, Flipper released a &quot;twin album&quot; featuring one album, titled &quot;Love&quot;, of new studio material, and a second live album, titled &quot;Fight&quot; featuring both old and new songs. Both of these albums were produced by Seattle producer Jack Endino and were well received. Novoselic announced his departure from the band in September 2009 due to responsibilities at home, forcing a tour cancellation. He was replaced by Rachel Thoele, formerly of Frightwig, Mudwimin and Van Gough&#x27;s Daughter.

Several Flipper albums were reissued during 2008–2009 in a variety of formats. &quot;Album – Generic Flipper&quot;, &quot;Gone Fishin&quot;&#x27;, &quot;Public Flipper Limited&quot; and &quot;Sex Bomb Baby!&quot; were reissued on compact disc by Water Records in the US and Domino Recording Company in the UK, and on vinyl by the Runt Distribution imprint 4 Men with Beards.

Flipper played two shows at San Francisco&#x27;s Bottom of the Hill on October 10 and 11, 2015, with DeSmartass returning on bass and David Yow (formerly of Scratch Acid and the Jesus Lizard) on vocals.

In 2019, Flipper decided to play some dates to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the band. The 2019 incarnation of the band consists of Steve DePace, Ted Falconi, and David Yow. With no permanent bass player, the band reached out to friends Rachel Thoele, Mike Watt (whose previous band Minutemen played with Flipper 36 years earlier), and Krist Novoselic. Their Northern California dates will be with Thoele on bass and supported by No Parents, Mike Watt &amp; the Secondmen, and Qui. Watt will take over for Thoele when the band embarks on their European tour.

==Influence on other musicians==
Kurt Cobain wore a self-made Flipper T-shirt, seen in the booklet pictures of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;In Utero&quot;, on the band&#x27;s first performance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1992, and also in the music video for &quot;Come as You Are&quot;. Cobain and Novoselic cited Flipper as one of their band&#x27;s influences.

In the documentary &quot;American Hardcore&quot;, Moby stated that he fronted Flipper for two days while singer Will Shatter was in jail because he &quot;knew all of their songs&quot;. Steve DePace recalls that it was only for one night.

Eric Avery of Jane&#x27;s Addiction has said that Flipper&#x27;s rolling rhythms and repetitive riffs were an influence on his band&#x27;s early sound.

In &quot;Get in the Van&quot;, his memoir of the early 1980s punk rock scene, Henry Rollins of Black Flag described the Flipper experience: &quot;They were just heavy. Heavier than you. Heavier than anything...When they played they were amazing&quot;.

==Covers==
R.E.M. covered &quot;Sex Bomb&quot; for the A-side of the 1994 edition of their Fan Club Singles 7-inch series.

The Melvins covered several Flipper songs: &quot;Sacrifice&quot; on their &quot;Lysol&quot; album; &quot;Love Canal&quot; and &quot;Someday&quot; on a 5-inch single released by Slap-A-Ham Records; and &quot;Way of the World&quot; on the &quot;Singles 1–12&quot; compilation. 

Belgian electronica/industrial band Lords of Acid covered Flipper&#x27;s song &quot;Sex Bomb&quot;, and released a live version on the 1995 &quot;Do What You Wanna Do&quot; maxi-single. The track started with Praga Khan giving credit to Flipper. It was later reinterpreted in the Lords&#x27; typical style on the 2000 album &quot;Farstucker&quot;, and is a staple of their live shows. 

UK band Terminal Cheesecake also covered&#x27; &quot;Sex Bomb&quot; on their second album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;V.C.L.&quot; (Wiiija Records). 

Unsane covered the song &quot;Ha Ha Ha&quot; on their 2012 album &quot;Wreck&quot;.

<text>Sri Prakasa (3 August 1890 – 23 June 1971) was an Indian politician, freedom-fighter and administrator. He served as India&#x27;s first High Commissioner to Pakistan from 1947 to 1949, Governor of Assam from 1949 to 1950, Governor of Madras from 1952 to 1956 and Governor of Bombay from 1956 to 1962.

Sri Prakasa was born in Varanasi in 1890. In his early days, he participated in the Indian independence movement and was jailed. After India&#x27;s independence, he served as an administrator and cabinet minister. Sri Prakasa died in 1971 at the age of 80.

== Early life ==
Sri Prakasa was born on 3 August 1890 in Varanasi to Bhagwan Das. He had his schooling at Central Hindu Boys&#x27; School C.H.B.S. (B.H.U.) Varanasi and graduated from Cambridge.

== Indian independence movement ==
Prakasa was arrested during the Quit India Movement and was in jail from 1942 to 1944.

== High Commissioner to Pakistan ==
In August 1947, Sri Prakasa was appointed India&#x27;s first High Commissioner to Pakistan and served in the post till 1949. During this time, Pakistan was gripped by communal riots and Sri Prakasa had to deal with the influx of refugees to India and the granting of Indian citizenship to migrants. Sri Prakasa had also to represent India&#x27;s diplomatic interests during Pakistan&#x27;s invasion of Kashmir.

== Governor of Assam ==
Sri Prakasa served as the governor of Assam from 16 February 1949 to 27 May 1949. When Prakasa took over as governor, there were serious disturbances in the eastern parts of the province which were inhabited by the Mizo Hill tribes. The Governor pacified the agitators by promising to grant sufficient autonomy. As a result, a Lushai Hills Advisory Council was set up. During his short tenure, he secured the accession of Manipur.

== Governor of Madras ==
Sri Prakasa was elected to Lok Sabha from Prayagraj in 1952 but was quite soon appointed the Governor of Madras. He served as the governor of Madras from 1952 to 1956. While governor, he took the highly criticized decision to invite C. Rajagopalachari to form a Congress government in the state despite the fact that the Indian National Congress did not have a majority and Rajagopalachari was not an elected member of the assembly as he had not participated in the elections. Rajagopalachari requested Prakasa to nominate him to the assembly thereby forgoing the usual process of election by the members of the assembly. However, Rajagopalachari resigned in two years because of strong opposition to his leadership among party ranks. P.C. Alexander, a former Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra governor, viewed the behaviour of the governor and the chief minister of Madras in 1952 as one of the most serious breaches of the democratic process.

== Governor of Bombay ==
Sri Prakasa served as the governor of Bombay.

<text>The Democratic Republic of Yemen ( &quot;&quot;), was a short-lived breakaway state that fought against the mainland Yemen in the 1994 Yemeni Civil War. It was declared in May 1994 and covered all of the former South Yemen.

The DRY, with its capital in Aden, was led by President Ali Salim al-Beidh and Prime Minister Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas and represented a response to the weakening position of the South in the civil war of 1994. The new state failed to receive international recognition. Its leaders, in addition to Yemeni Socialist Party figures such as al-Beidh and Attas, included some prominent personalities from South Yemeni history such as Abdallah al-Asnaj, who had been strenuously opposed to YSP one-party rule in the former People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen.

== History ==
The secession followed several weeks of fighting, which began on 27 April and lasted from 21 May 1994 until 7 July 1994. The civil war ended by the DRY strongholds of Mukalla and Aden falling to government forces.

<text>Wonga Philip Harris (June 24, 1904 – August 11, 1995) was an American actor, bandleader, entertainer and singer. He was an orchestra leader and a pioneer in radio situation comedy, first with &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, then in &quot;The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show&quot; in which he co-starred with his wife, singer-actress Alice Faye, for eight years. Harris is also noted for his voice acting in animated films. As a voice actor, he played Baloo in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967), Thomas O&#x27;Malley in &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970), Little John in &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1973), and Patou in &quot;Rock-a-Doodle&quot; (1991). As a singer, he recorded a number one novelty hit record, &quot;The Thing&quot; (1950).

== Early life and career ==
Harris was born in Linton, Indiana, on June 24, 1904, but grew up in Nashville, Tennessee, and identified himself as a Southerner. His hallmark song was &quot;That&#x27;s What I Like About the South.&quot; He had a trace of a Southern accent and in later years made self-deprecating jokes over the air about his heritage. His parents were circus performers. His father, a tent bandleader, gave him his first job as a drummer with the circus band.

His unusual first name &quot;Wonga,&quot; is said to derive from a Cherokee word meaning &quot;messenger of fleet&quot; or, perhaps more accurately translated, &quot;fast messenger.&quot;

Harris began his music career as a drummer in San Francisco, in the mid-1920s playing drums in the Henry Halstead Big Band Orchestra. He formed an orchestra with Carol Lofner in the latter 1920s and started a long engagement at the St. Francis Hotel. In the 1930s, Lofner-Harris recorded swing music for Victor, Columbia, Decca, and Vocalion. The partnership ended by 1932, and Harris led a band in Los Angeles for which he was the singer and bandleader.
In 1933, he made a short film for RKO called &quot;So This Is Harris!&quot;, which won an Academy Award for best live action short subject. He followed with a feature-length film, &quot;Melody Cruise&quot;. Both films were created by the same team that produced &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot;, which started the careers of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. He also starred in &quot;I Love a Bandleader&quot; (1945) with Leslie Brooks. Here he played a house painter who gets amnesia, then starts to lead a band. He recorded &quot;Woodman, Spare That Tree&quot; (by George Pope Morris and Henry Russell) in 1947. His nickname was &quot;Old Curly.&quot; In 1950, Harris recorded a hit novelty song, the million-seller, &quot;The Thing,&quot; which hit number one on the U.S. chart. Additionally, he appeared in &quot;The Wild Blue Yonder&quot; (1951), alongside Forrest Tucker and Walter Brennan. He made a cameo appearance in the Warner Bros. musical, &quot;Starlift&quot;, with Janice Rule and Dick Wesson, and was featured in &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot; with John Wayne in 1954.

Harris made two feature films with Jack Benny for Paramount Pictures, &quot;Man About Town&quot; (1939) and &quot;Buck Benny Rides Again&quot; (1940). Both films also featured Eddie &quot;Rochester&quot; Anderson.

==Radio==
In 1936, Harris became musical director of &quot;The Jell-O Program Starring Jack Benny&quot; singing and leading his band, with Mahlon Merrick writing much of the show&#x27;s music. When Harris exhibited a knack for snappy one-liners, he joined the cast, portraying himself as a hip, hard-drinking Southerner whose good nature superseded his ego. He gave the others nicknames, such as &quot;Jackson&quot; for Jack Benny. (Addressing a man as &quot;Jackson&quot; or sometimes &quot;Mr. Jackson&quot; became popular slang in the early 1940s.) His signature song was &quot;That&#x27;s What I Like About the South.&quot; Many of his vocal recordings were comic novelty &quot;talking blues,&quot; similar to the songs of Bert Williams, which are sometimes considered a precursor to rap.

In 1942, Harris and his band joined the U.S. Merchant Marine and served for 16 weeks.

In 1946, Harris and wife Alice Faye began co-hosting &quot;The Fitch Bandwagon&quot;, a comedy-variety program that followed the Jack Benny show on Sunday nights. On &quot;The Fitch Bandwagon&quot; and its later incarnation as &quot;The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show&quot;, Harris played a vain, stumbling husband, while Faye played his sarcastic but loving wife. Gerald Nachman has written that Harris was a soft-spoken, modest man off the air. In &quot;On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio&quot; John Dunning wrote that Harris&#x27;s character made the show popular. &quot;The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show&quot; appeared until 1954. Harris continued to appear on Jack Benny&#x27;s show from 1948 to 1952.

== Recording career ==
Harris was recording songs as early as 1931. He sang with a deep baritone voice. Songs by Harris include the early 1950s novelty song, &quot;The Thing&quot;. The song describes the hapless finder of a box with a mysterious secret and his efforts to rid himself of it.

==Later career==
In 1956, Harris appeared in the film &quot;Good-bye, My Lady&quot;. He made numerous guest appearances on 1960s and 1970s television series, including &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, the &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot;, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;F Troop&quot;, &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, and other musical variety programs. He appeared on &quot;The American Sportsman&quot; which took celebrities on hunting and fishing trips around the world.

Harris worked as a voice actor for a number of Disney animated films, providing the voice of Baloo the bear in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967), Thomas O&#x27;Malley in &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970), and Little John in &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1973). In 1989, he reprised his role as Baloo for the cartoon series &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, but after a few recording sessions he was replaced by Ed Gilbert. Harris&#x27;s final film role was in &quot;Rock-a-Doodle&quot; (1991), where he voiced Patou, the Basset Hound.

Harris spent time in the 1970s and early 1980s leading a band that appeared often in Las Vegas, often on the same bill with bandleader Harry James.

== Personal life ==
On September 2, 1927, Harris married actress Marcia Ralston (then known as Mascotte Ralston) in Melbourne, Australia, where his band had a long engagement. The couple adopted a son, Phil Harris Jr. (b. 1935). Harris and Marcia divorced in September 1940.

Harris and Alice Faye married in 1941; it was a second marriage for both (Faye had been married briefly to singer-actor Tony Martin) and lasted 54 years, until Harris&#x27;s death.

As a Democrat, Harris supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.

Harris was a lifelong friend of singer and actor Bing Crosby. He appeared on telecasts of Bing&#x27;s Pro-Am Golf Tournament from Pebble Beach, California, and appeared in an episode of ABC&#x27;s short-lived sitcom &quot;The Bing Crosby Show&quot;. After Crosby died in 1977, Harris replaced him as commentator for the annual Bing Crosby Pro-Am Golf Tournament.

Harris was a resident and benefactor of Palm Springs, California, and was active in many local civic organizations.

==Death and legacy==
Harris died of a heart attack at age 91 in his Rancho Mirage home on the night of August 11, 1995. He is interred at Forest Lawn Cemetery, Cathedral City, California.

Harris was a benefactor of his birthplace of Linton, Indiana, establishing scholarships in his honor for promising high school students, performing at the high school, and hosting a celebrity golf tournament in his honor every year. Harris and Faye donated most of their show business memorabilia and papers to Linton&#x27;s public library. Harris was inducted into the Indiana Hall of Fame.

In 1994, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

<text>Julio María Sanguinetti Coirolo (; born 6 January 1936) often known by his initials JMS, is a Uruguayan former lawyer, journalist and politician of the Colorado Party (PC) who served as the President of Uruguay as the 35th president from 1985 to 1990, and again as the 37th president from 1995 to 2000. He was the first democratically elected president after twelve years of military dictatorship.

Born in Montevideo, Sanguinetti graduated from the University of the Republic in 1961 with a law degree. He later combined his legal practice with work as a journalist. He had already been writing for the press, first in the weekly &quot;Canelones&quot; and later, since 1955, as a columnist for &quot;Acción&quot;, a newspaper established by the then-President, Luis Batlle Berres, for which he covered events such as the Cuban Revolution and the OAS Foreign Ministers&#x27; summit that censured Cuba for its decision to establish relations with the Soviet Union.

In the 1962 general election, Sanguinetti was elected National Representative for the Montevideo Department, and re-elected in 1966. In 1969 the then president Jorge Pacheco Areco appointed him Minister of Industry and Commerce. From March to October 1972 he served as Minister of Education and Culture under Juan María Bordaberry. He publicly opposed the 1973 coup d&#x27;état and the subsequent civil-military dictatorship.

He participated in the Naval Club Pact that made the democratic transition possible. In the 1984 general election he was elected President of Uruguay as the most voted candidate of the most voted political party, according to the &quot;Ley de Lemas system&quot;. Major government initiatives he undertook during his first term consisted of measures to disarm the previous regime, and included an amnesty law in favor of people who were still detained, convicted by military justice for political crimes and the Law on the Expiration of the Punitive Claims of the State. In foreign policy, Sanguinetti&#x27;s government recognized and established diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and signed the Alvorada Act, which added Uruguay to the regional integration process, which later led to the creation of the Southern Common Market.

== Early life and education ==
Sanguinetti Coirolo was born in Montevideo on January 6, 1936, to a middle-class Italian-Uruguayan family from the town of Chiavari near the city of Genoa. His parents were Julio León Sanguinetti Maupe and Ema Coirolo Saravia. His maternal grandmother was Regina Saravia de Coirolo, daughter of Chiquito Saravia, brother of Aparicio Saravia, &quot;caudillo&quot; of the National Party.

Raised in a politically diverse family, he joined the Colorado Party in his teens. He attended Elbio Fernández School. In 1955 he enrolled at the University of the Republic, from which he obtained a law degree in 1961.

== Early political career ==
In 1963, at the age of 27, Sanguinetti became a member of the Chamber of Representative for the Montevideo Department. In 1964 he was a member of the Uruguayan delegation that participated in the establishment of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Geneva.

In 1966, Sanguinetti served as a member of the drafting group and informer on Constitutional Reform and from 1967 he was a member of the advisory group of Colorado President Jorge Pacheco on affairs related to the Organization of American States. Later on, in 1969, Pacheco appointed him as Minister for Industry and Commerce, a position which he occupied until 1971, when he was appointed Head of the Uruguayan Trade Mission to the USSR. He also became Deputy Editor of &quot;Acción&quot;.

In March 1972, the new President, also from the PC Party, Juan María Bordaberry, brought him to the government once again as Minister for Education and Culture. That same year, Sanguinetti was a founding member of the National Commission for the Historical, Artistic and Cultural Heritage of the Nation.

== Civilian-military administration 1973–1985 ==

The breach of the constitutional order by the Armed Forces in June 1973 deprived him of his positions in the Government and in the Chamber of Representatives, where he had renewed his seat once again in 1971, as well as his position as Deputy Editor of Acción Newspaper - which was closed down - and President of the National Council of Visual Arts, to which he had been appointed in 1967. In 1976 he was prohibited from undertaking any political activity.

During the following years, Sanguinetti worked as a journalist, working from a viewpoint that was critical of the de facto Government, in &quot;El Día Newspaper&quot; (1973–1981), &quot;Visión Newspaper&quot; (since 1974, as an opinion columnist, a collaboration which he has continued up until today), and in the weekly publication &quot;Correo de los Viernes&quot; (established by him in 1981 and edited until 1984), as well as in the promotion of cultural and sports activities as the President of the Regional UNESCO Centre for the promotion of books in South America (1975–1984) and Vice-President of the popular Peñarol Football Club.

Following the rejection of the constitutional project on 30 November 1980 and having had his political rights restored on 29 June 1981, Sanguinetti headed the PC delegation in the political party negotiations with the army in order to allow a peaceful and ordered transition to democracy. The negotiations ended with the signing of the Naval Club Pact on 3 August 1984. In 1983 he was elected Secretary General of the Executive Committee of PC and in August 1984 he obtained the majority nomination for the presidential elections which were to be held later that year, putting an end to 12 years of dictatorship. Sanguinetti also received significant support for his candidacy from the ruling military.

==First presidency (1985–1990)==
On 25 November 1984, general elections were held. Sanguinetti won 31.2% of the votes, defeating the best PN candidate, Alberto Zumarán; thus on 1 March 1985 he was sworn in as president with a 5-year term substituting the temporary president, Rafael Addiego, who had in turn substituted the military president, Gregorio Álvarez, on the previous 12 February. The ceremony was attended by 72 foreign representatives as an expression of support from the international community towards that new era in Uruguayan politics. (At the time, Sanguinetti had been unwilling to participate in an office-conferring ceremony together with Álvarez, and thus the interim arrangement with Addiego was worked out with the agreement of the parties concerned, but in later years Álvarez found a not so unlikely defender in Sanguinetti, who argued that Álvarez&#x27;s legal troubles since the coming of the Broad Front government in 2005 were unnecessarily one-sided, since known former Tupamaro insurgents were being ignored by Uruguayan justice.)

Considered at the time a progressive politician in political questions and more conservative in economic questions, Sanguinetti managed to rehabilitate the image of a party that included a great variety of ideological diversity, the more conservative sectors of which had supported the coup d&#x27;état in 1973. He immediately lifted the ban on political parties and leaders that had actively opposed the dictatorship and signed an amnesty for political prisoners.

With respect to foreign relations, Sanguinetti re-launched relations with Spain and re-established contacts with communist countries. In the nearer geographic arena, on 26 May 1987, and as a colophon to several preparatory meetings, he signed the Montevideo Agreement with his colleague, Raúl Alfonsín. This agreement was decisive in giving an impulse to regional economic integration according to the objectives outlined in the South American Integration Association (ALADI).

Alfonsín had already been negotiating an ambitious agreement to dismantle tariffs in bilateral trade with the Brazilian José Sarney; now, Sanguinetti was included in an open field project that adopted a three-country shape and that gained impulse from the summit of the three presidents which the Uruguayan had organized in Colonia on 6 February 1988. With the inclusion of Paraguay, all this work led to the creation of the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) in 1991.

In the economic area, Sanguinetti&#x27;s Government had the reduction of the USD $510 million foreign debt as one of its most important objectives. This is an enormous figure which is close to the level of national production. Likewise, Sanguinetti was an active member of the Support Group (Uruguay, Peru, Brazil and Argentina) of the Contadora Group (Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Panama), an informal consultative forum dedicated to exploring preventive measures against the expansion of armed conflicts in Central America, which, in December 1986 decided to merge with the so-called Group of Eight, which in turn was called the Río Group in October 1990 coinciding with its expansion to include Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay. Sanguinetti presided the II Group of Eight Meeting, in Punta del Este on 29 October 1988.

In his first presidential term, the Uruguayan economy, which had suffered from a deep depression until 1985, registered positive indicators with production growth, a reduction in inflation, stabilization of unemployment and an increase in exports. The confrontation with trade unions -which demanded separation from the IMF and non-payment of the national debt- was compensated with opening up agreements among political parties to strengthen the consensus between the parties in order to bring forward legislation which was in the general interest. The result of this consensus was the National Agreement which was signed on 1 April 1986 by PC, PN, the left-wing Broad Front (FA) and the conservative Unión Cívica (UC).

Towards the end of his presidency, in spite of the agreements reached for its re-financing, Uruguay&#x27;s foreign debt kept on increasing, always slightly below GDP, which was also reduced to a virtually nonexistent growth rate. Inflation also experienced a strong increase and 1990 ended with a 130% inflation rate.

A very particular aspect of his first term in office was the handling of the military issues. Uruguay had endured 12 long years of military dictatorship and the transition to democracy was very hard. Many opposition leaders and human-right organizations fought for truth and justice, and hundreds of cases were brought to the courts; but the military refused to cooperate, a political crisis was about to take place and, at the end of 1986, the very controversial Law on the Expiration of the Punitive Claims of the State was passed by the Parliament.

On 1 March 1990, Sanguinetti handed over the Presidency to Luis Alberto Lacalle, the PN candidate who had won the elections on 26 November 1989. Sanguinetti remained committed to journalism and to academic activities as well as to the internal politics of his party as the leader of the Batllist Forum, which had a Social Democratic ideology, the most important faction of PC along with Batllismo Unido, headed by Jorge Batlle.

Among the several prominent politicians who served in his government can be mentioned: Enrique V. Iglesias, Antonio Marchesano, Ricardo Zerbino, Juan Vicente Chiarino, Adela Reta, Hugo Fernández Faingold, Luis Brezzo, Alejandro Atchugarry and Ariel Davrieux. Opposition leader Wilson Ferreira Aldunate played a key role in the definition of the most difficult issues for the democratic institutions.

==Second presidency (1995–2000)==

Sanguinetti sought a second term in the 1994 presidential elections on 27 November, which he won with 24.7% of the vote, beating Tabaré Vázquez of the Encuentro Progresista-Frente Amplio (EP-FA) coalition, the other PC candidates - Jorge Batlle and Jorge Pacheco - as well as the three PN candidates, the strongest of which was Alberto Volonté who received 14.9% of the vote.

While Vázquez won the most votes of any individual candidate, under the Ley de Lemas still in force at the time, the highest-finishing candidate from the party winning the most votes would become president. This was the case even if that candidate was not the most-voted individual candidate (in practice this only affected the two biggest parties). In this case, even though Sanguinetti finished with 121,000 fewer votes than Vázquez, the Colorados polled 32.3% of the vote between them higher than the combined 31.2% received by the PN and the 30.6% received by Vázquez&#x27;s Broad Front. On 1 March 1995 Sanguinetti was sworn in as the third leader to be re-elected in the country&#x27;s history.

Sanguinetti formed a coalition Government with PN which received 4 ministries, the Gobierno del Pueblo Party (PGP) - created by those who had broken away from the PC- whose leader, Hugo Batalla, was given the Vice-Presidency-, along with an independent cabinet minister with Unión Cívica ties.

This alliance framework allowed him to bring the budget through a parliament divided in equal parts between the three main groups each year until the end of his term along with the reforms of the Social Security Law –attacked by worker and pensioner organizations- as well as the constitutional reform. Guaranteed the backing of two-thirds of the parliament, this reform, which eliminated the almost hundred-year old Ley de Lemas, was supported by 50.45% of the votes and came into force on 14 January 1997.

The amendments strengthened the executive power against the legislative power and undertook a profound reform of the electoral system. Among other points, it limited each party to a single presidential candidate. If no candidate won a majority in the first round, the top two candidates in the first round would advance to a runoff.

The expansionist economic policy of his Government brought about a reduction in the recession of -1.8% which had been registered the previous year, partly due to a fall in exports, and gave way to high growth rates that didn&#x27;t generate inflation. The opposite is true in fact, this variable experimented a continuous fall until it reached around 6% in 1999. The positive results in trading and in key production sectors generated employment that gave way to improved salaries and pensions, a general increase in income that in turn increased investment and internal consumption.

This boom panorama was drastically affected by the Brazilian crisis of 1998-1999, which reduced the products it bought from Uruguay; Brazil was the destination of more than a third of total Uruguayan exports. This interdependence was created within MERCOSUR, whose IX, XIII and XVII summits were hosted by Sanguinetti, respectively on the 7 December 1995 in Punta del Este, 15 December 1997 in Montevideo, and, again, on 8 December 1999, also in Montevideo.

On 1 March 2000 his term as President ended and he handed over the Presidency to his colleague Jorge Batlle, who had won the elections on 28 November 1999.

Among the many prominent politicians who took part in his government can be mentioned: Didier Opertti, Guillermo Stirling, Luis Antonio Hierro López, Álvaro Ramos, Luis Mosca, Luis Brezzo, Lucio Cáceres, Juan Antonio Chiruchi, and Ariel Davrieux. The Nationalist leader Alberto Volonté was pivotal in daily affairs of the government coalition.

==Post-presidency (2000–present)==
Always active in journalism and in the cultural world, during his break from presidential duties between 1990 and 1995 Sanguinetti was a columnist for the EFE Press Agency and &quot;El País&quot;, both Spanish companies. His link with Spain was strengthened as the Director of several Seminars organized by the Complutense University in Madrid and as a lecturer in summer courses at the Menéndez Pelayo International University in Santander.

Since 1996 he has promoted the work of individuals from the political and intellectual world, including the former Colombian President Belisario Betancur, the former Spanish President, Felipe González, the former President of Chile, Ricardo Lagos and the former President of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. This group is known as the Montevideo Circle.

Since 1990, he has also been President of the PAX Institute, an academic foundation for international action. He is likewise a member of the InterAcción Council – another forum for retired world leaders that centers its work on the elaboration of reports and studies offering advice on diverse areas of the international arena- as well as of the Council of Presidents and Prime Ministers of the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia. He is also a member of Washington D.C.–based Western Hemisphere think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue.

He professed support for the same-sex marriage bill recently approved by the Uruguayan legislature.

Sanguinetti was a pre-candidate for the presidential primaries in June 2019 supported by the Batllistas political sector of the Colorado Party, and accompanied by some of his former trusted advisers, including former ministers and politicians from the Foro Batllista. In the primaries, he was second, being surpassed by Ernesto Talvi, who was proclaimed the presidential candidate of the PC. After being elected senator for the 49th Legislature in the general election of October 2019, Sanguinetti expressed his intention to collaborate from Parliament with the Multicolor Coalition during the first year, and then work on his activities as general secretary of the Colorado Party. He resigned his senatorial seat on October 20, 2020, announcing that he will begin a &quot;full dedication&quot; stage to his party. He resigned with former President José Mujica (2010-2015).

He has received honorary doctorate degrees from the Universities of Brasília (1985), Moscow (1990), Asunción (1994), Genoa and Bucharest, and, excluding short articles and studies, he has published the books entitled &quot;Alcances y aplicaciones de la nueva Constitución uruguaya&quot; [The Scope and Application of the New Uruguayan Constitution] (1967), &quot;La nación, el nacionalismo y otros ismos&quot; [The Nation, Nationalism and other &#x27;-isms&#x27;] (1978), &quot;El temor y la impaciencia&quot; Fear and Impatience (1991), &quot;El año 501&quot; [The Year 501] (1992), &quot;Un mundo sin Marx&quot; [A World without Marx] (1993) y &quot;Meditaciones del milenio&quot; [Meditations of the Millennium] (1994), &quot;El doctor Figari&quot; [Doctor Figari] (2002), &quot;La agonía de una democracia&quot; [Agony of a democracy] (2008), &quot;La reconquista, Proceso de la restauración democrática en Uruguay (1980-1990)&quot; [The reconquest, Process of Uruguay&#x27;s democratic rs restoration] (2012), &quot;Retratos desde la memoria (Debate, Montevideo)&quot; [Portraits from memory] (2015), &quot;El cronista y la historia&quot; [The reporter and history] (2017).

<text>Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s The Jungle Book, also known as The Jungle Book, is a 1994 American adventure film co-written and directed by Stephen Sommers, produced by Edward S. Feldman and Raju Patel, from a story by Ronald Yanover and Mark Geldman. An independent production funded by MDP Worldwide, the film&#x27;s distribution rights were acquired by Buena Vista Pictures in most territories in exchange for Disney providing half of the film&#x27;s overall budget. The film is based on the Mowgli stories from &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1894) and &quot;The Second Jungle Book&quot; (1895) by Rudyard Kipling, but mostly focuses on the plotline of the second book. Unlike the books and Walt Disney&#x27;s 1967 animated adaption, the animal characters in this film do not talk.

The film stars Jason Scott Lee, Cary Elwes, Lena Headey, Sam Neill, and John Cleese. Released on December 25, 1994, the film received generally positive reviews and grossed $70 million worldwide against a $30 million budget.

== Plot ==
During the British rule in India, Mowgli is the five-year-old son of Nathoo, a widowed guide who is guiding an expedition in the jungle for fellow widower Colonel Geoffrey Brydon, his five-year-old daughter, Kitty, and Brydon&#x27;s friend, Dr. Julius Plumford. Shere Khan the tiger begins stalking the group when fellow guide Buldeo and two other soldiers kill some animals for sport, which is against the jungle law. Shere Khan attacks the camp at night, killing the two soldiers and Nathoo, who dies trying to fight him off to defend Buldeo.

In the chaos, Mowgli and his wolf cub, Grey Brother, are separated and presumed dead. Mowgli meets Bagheera the panther who leads him to the wolf pack, and also befriends bear cub Baloo. Years later, a monkey steals a bracelet from Mowgli, which Kitty had given to him when they were children. Mowgli chases the monkey to an ancient abandoned city honoring Hanuman which hosts piles of treasure, ruled by an orangutan, King Louie. Mowgli battles and subdues Kaa the snake using a dagger and is given the bracelet back by Louie.

Meanwhile, Kitty still resides in India with Brydon. Venturing into the jungle, she meets Mowgli again and does not recognize him. Mowgli also encounters Captain William Boone, Kitty&#x27;s suitor, who perceives the animalistic Mowgli as a threat. Mowgli arrives in Kitty&#x27;s village, and she recognizes him after seeing the bracelet. Mowgli is pursued by Boone; after a chase, he is caught by Buldeo, who recognizes Mowgli&#x27;s dagger as being from the legendary city of Hanuman. Boone and his men imprison Mowgli and torture him in an attempt to find out where he obtained the dagger. Kitty informs her father that the prisoner is Mowgli, though Brydon remains skeptical; Kitty and Plumford attempt to reintroduce Mowgli to the world of man. Boone learns from Buldeo and his friend Tabaqui about the lost city and attempts to persuade Mowgli to show him the way. However, Mowgli refuses, citing that Boone does not keep the jungle law by killing animals for fun.

Brydon later announces that Boone and Kitty are to be married. A heartbroken Mowgli returns to the jungle after Boone and his men treat him poorly; Kitty refuses to marry Boone following this, enabling Brydon to send her back to England. Boone, desperate to find the treasure, recruits fellow soldiers Wilkins and Harley, and they team up with Buldeo and Tabaqui. They attempt to capture Mowgli but fail and Baloo is shot while defending Mowgli.
The men later ambush Kitty and her father with the help of bandits, who later are attacked by Bagheera and the wolves and Brydon is shot in the leg. The would-be treasure hunters hold Kitty and Brydon hostage as leverage for Mowgli to lead them to the treasure. At night, Shere Khan returns; Mowgli promises to protect Kitty and Brydon from him and escapes the next morning with Bagheera&#x27;s aid. Harley gives chase, only to fall into quicksand and drown. The party continues their journey, Boone leaving behind a wounded Brydon, who is helped back to the village on an elephant courtesy of Mowgli. Later, Tabaqui decides that Mowgli is no longer needed and tries to murder him, only to die after falling from a cliff. As they reach the city, Wilkins becomes separated from the group and is mauled to death by Shere Khan. Inside the city, Buldeo attempts to shoot Mowgli but is entombed in a booby trap. Boone and Kitty make it to the treasure room, where Boone tries to kill Mowgli with a sword, though Mowgli injures him with a dagger and escapes with Kitty. Boone gathers treasure for himself, however his victory is cut short when Kaa kills him.

Outside the ruins, Mowgli and Kitty are confronted by Shere Khan who roars at Mowgli. Mowgli roars back and Shere Khan sees him as a creature of the jungle, fulfilling a childhood dream of Mowgli&#x27;s. Returning to the jungle, Mowgli and Kitty are delighted to find that both the lives of Brydon and Baloo have been saved by Plumford. Mowgli becomes lord of the jungle and begins a relationship with Kitty.

== Cast ==
* Jason Scott Lee as Mowgli, a wild man who was orphaned at 5 years old and was raised by the animals in the jungle of India.
** Sean Naegeli as 5-year-old Mowgli
* Cary Elwes as Captain William Boone, Kitty&#x27;s suitor who desires the wealth of the ancient ruins and leads a mutiny in search of it.
* Lena Headey as Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Brydon, the feisty and benevolent daughter of Colonel Brydon who is also the childhood friend and romantic interest of Mowgli.
** Joanna Wolff as 5-year-old Kitty
* Sam Neill as Colonel Geoffrey Brydon, Kitty&#x27;s firm but reasonable father who is the head of the British army stationed in India. He is also the narrator of the film.
* John Cleese as Dr. Julius Plumford, Colonel Brydon&#x27;s friend who is the medical professional of Brydon&#x27;s battalion and who assists Kitty in teaching Mowgli the ways of mankind.
* Jason Flemyng as Lieutenant John Wilkins, a nervous soldier in Brydon&#x27;s battalion and Boone&#x27;s close friend.
* Stefan Kalipha as Buldeo, an outlaw who knows about the ancient ruins. He is also the man responsible for provoking Shere Khan and causing the death of Mowgli&#x27;s father Nathoo.
* Ron Donachie as Sergeant Harley, a brutish soldier who sides with Boone in the mutiny.
* Anirudh Agarwal as Tabaqui, a ruthless jungle guide working for Boone. He shares the same name as a golden jackal in Kipling&#x27;s stories, who was Shere Khan&#x27;s henchman.
* Faran Tahir as Nathoo, Mowgli&#x27;s father who served as a guide for Colonel Brydon until he was killed by Shere Khan. This was also Tahir&#x27;s film debut.

=== Trained animals ===
* Casey as Baloo, a black bear who was rescued by Mowgli as a cub and his best friend among the animals.
* Shadow as Bagheera, a wise black panther who took Mowgli to be raised by the wolves and watches over him.
* Shannon as Grey Brother, an Indian wolf that Mowgli had since childhood and has been his closest companion.
* Lowell as King Louie, an orangutan who is the leader of a community of monkeys in the ancient ruins.
* Bombay as Shere Khan, a fierce and vicious Bengal tiger who is the keeper of the jungle law. Unlike most versions where he is the main villain, this version of the character served as a neutral force of nature in the film.

Kaa is portrayed by both a CGI and an animatronic python, as well as a trained green anaconda. Other trained animals include monkeys, Indian elephants, camels, horses, zebus, and wolves. The sounds used for the monkeys were actually those of chimpanzees and siamangs. KNB FX Group crew member Shannon Shea doubled for Baloo in certain shots in an animatronic bear suit.

== Production ==
=== Pre-production ===
Raju Patel, an Indian producer, figured the 100th anniversary of Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Book&quot; stories publication should be commemorated with a film adaptation.

On June 7, 1993, it was announced that The Walt Disney Company had secured distribution rights to the film in the United States, the United Kingdom, alongside Nordics, and Benelux territories as an exchange to allow Disney to provide half of the film&#x27;s production budget and funding, which was estimated between $15 and 20 million. The Disney deal was later extended to include additional territories such as Latin America, Portugal, Greece and Switzerland. In other countries, MDP Worldwide (Mark Damon&#x27;s company) was the sales agent for the film rights. MDP pre-sold the film to distributors such as 
AMLF in France, Roadshow Films in Australia, and Alliance Communications in Canada.

Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg saw the potential of adapting the animated classic and assigned Ronald Yonver and Mark Geldman to write the project. Dissatisfied with these scripts, one of which was 180 pages long with no dialogue for the first 70 pages, Katzenberg handed the project to Stephen Sommers after being satisfied with his work on &quot;The Adventures of Huck Finn&quot;. Sommers, who is a huge fan of the original animated film and various jungle adventure films, was eager to do a lush, romantic adventure and to show the beauty of the jungle. Executives were stunned by Sommers&#x27; decisions for the project as some were expecting an exact recreation of the original animated film and others wanted a teen romance to be the main focus.

=== Casting ===
Jason Scott Lee was Sommers&#x27; only choice for Mowgli. Disney executives labeled him as &quot;too old&quot; for the role until Sommers convinced them that he would be a much more believable leading man than an unknown teenager. Lee was also cast because the animals reacted to him the best. Sommers and his crew did try to cast actors in India, but due to Bollywood guidelines, their schedules and limits on the number of films they could work on restricted their involvement. However, they were able to cast Stefan Kalipha and Anirudh Agarwal before they agreed to any Bollywood productions. The casting of Cary Elwes as Captain William Boone, Lena Headey as Kitty Brydon, and Sam Neill as Colonel Geoffrey Brydon soon followed. Neill, in particular, found himself drawn to the role as he comes from a long line of family who served in the British Army during the Raj. The role of Dr. Julius Plumford was always written for John Cleese but Sommers was discouraged that Cleese would never accept it. Cleese agreed to the role after he received the script and fell in love with it. Jason Flemyng made his film debut with this film and his role grew after Sommers instantly bonded with him.

=== Animals ===
For the principal animal actors, a male black bear named Casey was chosen to play a role of Baloo, a male panther named Shadow was chosen to play Bagheera, a purebred female wolf named Shannon was chosen to play Grey Brother, a male tiger named Bombay was chosen to play Shere Khan, and a male orangutan named Lowell was chosen to play King Louie. Lowell was the only animal to play his character all the way through and, according to Sommers, was the easiest and most entertaining animal to work with. Sommers did not want the animal characters to speak like in the animated film and had them perform with the actors and exhibit natural behavior as much as possible. In total, 52 animals including tigers, leopards, bears, wolves, elephants, bulls, monkeys, and horses appear in the film.

=== Filming ===
Filming in Jodhpur in India took eight weeks and included scenes with rhesus macaques and Asian elephants. Indoor scenes like the lost treasure city set were shot on sound stages in Bombay. The jungles in India did not have the exact rainforest look envisioned by the filmmakers, so the jungle scenes were mostly shot in Fripp Island, South Carolina (scenes featuring Bagheera and Shere Khan) as well as Ozone Falls State Natural Area and Fall Creek Falls State Park in Tennessee (scenes featuring Baloo and the wolf pack). Scenes featuring Lowell were shot in a Los Angeles studio against a blue screen due to the production not being able to bring him to India. One of the Asian elephants in the production was named Shirley, and she lived at Wild Adventures Theme Park in Valdosta, Georgia.

=== Score ===
While electronics dominated most of his work during the early 1990s, composer Basil Poledouris returned to his symphonic roots for his score to the film. Most European versions of Milan&#x27;s official CD release include &quot;Two Different Worlds&quot;, a pop song performed by Kenny Loggins.

== Release ==
The film was released in theaters on December 25, 1994.

=== Home media ===
The film was released by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on VHS and LaserDisc on May 19, 1995. Disney also released the film on DVD on January 15, 2002.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 80% based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s The Jungle Book&quot; may not hew as closely to the book as its title suggests, but it still offers an entertaining live-action take on a story best known in animated form.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

The film was well received, with praise for its performances, action, and visuals, but it was also chided for not staying true to Kipling&#x27;s work, even though his name remains in the title. Most notably, Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; shared this sentiment. He said the film &quot;has so little connection to Rudyard Kipling or his classic book that the title is beyond explanation.&quot;

He goes on to say that it is a good film, awarding it three stars out of four, but it does not fit its target audience; some &quot;scenes are unsuitable for small children, and the &#x27;PG&#x27; rating is laughable.&quot;

Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; said that &quot;technically, &quot;Jungle Book&quot; is an encyclopedia of wonders, from the dazzling scenery (shot largely in Jodhpur, India), cinematography, costumes and sets, to the animals, who frequently out-emote their two-legged counterparts. Even so, &quot;Book&quot; may have been more effective had its story stayed on one page.&quot; Rita Kempley from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was more favorable, stating that &quot;the narrative shifts from romance to adventure the way Cheetah used to hop from foot to foot, but Sommers nevertheless delivers a bully family picture.&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed $43.2 million in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $27.5 million for a worldwide total of $70.7 million.

=== Accolades ===
The film was nominated for Excellence in Media&#x27;s 1994 Golden Angel Award for Best Motion Picture. It was also nominated for Best Action, Adventure or Thriller Film at the Saturn Awards.

=== Year-end lists ===
* Honorable mention – Betsy Pickle, &quot;Knoxville News-Sentinel&quot;
* Top 18 worst (alphabetically listed, not ranked) – Michael Mills, &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot;

== Prequel ==

In 1998, MDP Worldwide produced &quot;The Second Jungle Book: Mowgli and Baloo&quot;, a prequel film that was based on the original book and featured a different cast. Disney was not involved with the production of this film, with MDP instead selling distribution rights in most territories to Sony Pictures Releasing.

== Video game ==
The film was adapted into a 1996 video game, which includes clips from the film, while providing an original story and new characters. The game follows the player in their quest to save the jungle. Soldiers have stolen King Louie&#x27;s crown and the player must recover it to prevent the jungle from losing its magic. The player is aided by a Scotsman named Ilgwom (&quot;Mowgli&quot; spelled backwards) and his chimpanzee Lahtee, while also guided by a spirit made from Mowgli&#x27;s memories.

<doc id="726165" wikidata="Q4825075" url="?curid=726165" title="Australian permanent resident">
<text>Australian permanent residents are residents of Australia who hold a permanent visa but are not citizens of Australia. A holder of a permanent visa may remain in Australia indefinitely. A 5-year initial travel facility, which corresponds to the underlying migration program, is granted alongside the permanent visa. Until the travel facility expires, the visa holder may leave and re-enter Australia freely. After that period the visa holder needs to re-apply for the travel facility. However, holders of a permanent visa who are already in Australia with an expired travel facility may remain in Australia indefinitely.

Permanent residents enjoy many of the rights and privileges of citizens, including access to free or subsidised legal, education and health services. They do not have the right to vote in federal or state/territory elections, unless they were registered to vote prior to 1984, but may vote in some local government elections. Permanent residents are not entitled to an Australian passport.

Most permanent residents are eligible to become citizens after a waiting period. When the waiting period is complete, the process of sitting the citizenship test and attending the ceremony may add up to two years to gaining citizenship.

==Migration programs==

There are a number of programs under which a person may enter and obtain permanent residency in Australia, including:

* Skilled stream - mainly for skilled migrants, and has made available 129,250 visas for year 2012-2013
* Family and Child stream Family members can also be sponsored. An unlimited number of visas can be issued for partners (either married or &quot;de facto&quot;) and dependent children. Visas for other family member types are subject to limited (known as &quot;capping&quot;); for example there are only 1000 visas available under the &#x27;Parent&#x27; category, and as a consequence there is currently up to a twenty-year waiting period before undergoing consideration for these visas.
* Special Eligibility - mainly for former residents and persons who served in the Australian Defence Force.
* Humanitarian Program - mainly for refugees seeking permanent residency, and has made available 13,750 visas for year 2012-2013.

==Citizens of New Zealand==
Citizens of New Zealand are allowed to enter Australia to live and work indefinitely under the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, without applying for a visa but instead are automatically granted a Special Category Visa (SCV) on arrival. Though able to reside with no time limit, SCV holders are not considered as having permanent resident status, and the SCV is a temporary visa. Between 2001 and 2023, SCV holders who wanted to become Australian citizens first needed to apply for and obtain a permanent visa under one of the migration programs. On 1 July 2023, new legislation was introduced to consider SCV holders permanent residents for the purposes of Australian citizenship, allowing them to apply directly for citizenship.

==Benefits and limitations==
Benefits of permanent resident status include:

* Few limitations on employment in Australia. Some job opportunities, largely federal governmental work, require citizenship as opposed to permanent residence.
* The right to apply for Australian citizenship after fulfilling some criteria.
* For permanent residents accepted under the humanitarian program and enrolled in a Commonwealth supported place, the right to defer payment of their student contribution under the HECS-HELP scheme.
* The right to sponsor relatives for permanent residence, subject to fulfilling residence criteria and assurance of support requirements.
* Children born &quot;inside&quot; Australia will be Australian citizens by birth.
* The right to access medical and social security benefits, though there is a 2-year waiting period for some benefits.
* The right to travel to New Zealand without applying for a New Zealand visa. (This right is granted by the New Zealand government.)
* Unrestricted rights to live, work and study in New Zealand. (This right is granted by the New Zealand government.)

Permanent residents do not have the right to vote in federal, state or territory elections, unless they were “British subjects” and registered to vote prior to 1984, but may vote in some local government elections. Permanent residents are not entitled to an Australian passport.

<doc id="726166" wikidata="Q429963" url="?curid=726166" title="Tim Reid">
<text>Timothy Lee Reid Sr. (born December 19, 1944) is an American actor, comedian and film director best known for his roles in prime time American television programs, such as Venus Flytrap on &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; (1978–82), Marcel &quot;Downtown&quot; Brown on &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot; (1983–87), Ray Campbell on &quot;Sister, Sister&quot; (1994–99) and William Barnett on &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; (2004–06).

Reid also starred in a CBS series, &quot;Frank&#x27;s Place&quot;, as a professor who inherits a Louisiana restaurant. Reid is the founder and president of Legacy Media Institute, a non-profit organization &quot;dedicated to bringing together leading professionals in the film and television industry, outstanding actors, and young men and women who wish to pursue a career in the entertainment media&quot;.

==Early years==
Reid was born in Norfolk, Virginia, and raised in the Crestwood area of Chesapeake, formerly Norfolk County, Virginia. He is the son of William Lee and Augustine (née Wilkins) Reid. He had experienced segregation growing up in Norfolk, the majority of businesses around him being black-owned. He earned his Bachelor of Business Administration degree at Norfolk State College in 1968. Reid also became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. After graduation, he was hired by Dupont Corporation, where he worked for three years.

Reid&#x27;s entertainment career also began in 1968. He and insurance salesman Tom Dreesen met at a Junior Chamber of Commerce meeting near Chicago. They were &quot;put together to promote an anti-drug program in the local schools&quot; and, prompted by a comment from a child, decided to form a comedy team. The team, later billed as &quot;Tim and Tom&quot;, was the first interracial comedy duo. Years later, Reid and Dreesen wrote a book about those years called &quot;Tim &amp; Tom: An American Comedy in Black and White&quot; (2008), co-written with sports writer Ron Rapoport.

==Television acting career==
Reid started out on the short-lived &quot;The Richard Pryor Show&quot;. Reid starred as DJ &quot;Venus Flytrap&quot; on the hit CBS sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, in what is perhaps his best known TV role. Reid starred as Lieutenant Marcel Proust &quot;Downtown&quot; Brown (episodes 43–127) on the CBS detective series &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;. In 1988, Reid won an award from Viewers for Quality Television Awards as &quot;Best Actor in a Quality Comedy Series&quot; in &quot;Frank&#x27;s Place&quot;. In 1988, the same role earned him an Image Award for &quot;Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series&quot;.

Reid played the adult Mike Hanlon in the 1990 television mini-series adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s epic horror novel &quot;It&quot;. He made an appearance as Sgt. Ray Bennett of the Seacouver Police Department in three first-season episodes of &quot;&quot;. He had a starring role in the series &quot;Sister, Sister&quot; as Ray Campbell for the entire six-season run. On April 13, 2009, Reid appeared opposite former co-star Tamera Mowry on the short-lived ABC Family series &quot;Roommates&quot; as Mr. Daniels. Reid had a recurring role on &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; as William Barnett.

==Directing==
Reid has directed various television programs, as well the 1996 film &quot;Once Upon a Time...When We Were Colored&quot;, based on a similarly titled memoir by Clifton L. Taulbert. Reid directed and adapted a children&#x27;s TV show called &quot;Bobobobs&quot; that aired in the late 1980s. He is the creator of Stop the Madness, an after-school special video in the fight against drugs, recorded on December 11, 1985.

==New Millennium Studios ==
Tim and Daphne Maxwell Reid built New Millennium Studios in 1997. Located in Petersburg, Virginia, the 57.4-acre site with its 14,850-square-foot sound studio was both the only Black-owned film studio in the United States since the 1930s, but also one of the largest independent film studios outside of Hollywood.

New Millennium Studios was used in dozens of movie and television productions, including scenes from the 2001 film &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot; of the Stephen King book of the same name; parts of 2000&#x27;s &quot;The Contender&quot; and elements of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Lincoln&quot; were all shot there. The Reids also produced feature films of their own.

Due to &quot;a lack of incentives in the state&quot; to bring film production to Virginia, the Reids sold the property in March 2015 for $1.475 million to Four Square Property Management LLC, a company formed by Four Square Industrial Constructors, based in Chester, Virginia.

==Personal life==

In 1966, Reid married Rita Ann Sykes; they divorced on May 9, 1980. They have two children together: Timothy II (born 1968) and Tori Reid (born 1971). On December 4, 1982, he married actress Daphne Maxwell Reid.

In July 2011, Reid was named to the board of directors of the American Civil War Center at Tredegar Iron Works. On May 10, 2014, Reid received a Virginia Commonwealth University honorary doctorate for his many outstanding and distinguished contributions after he delivered a commencement speech.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Reid served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute. A native Virginian, Reid resides in Glensheallah, Portsmouth, Virginia.

<doc id="726172" wikidata="Q336253" url="?curid=726172" title="Luis Alberto Lacalle">
<text>Luis Alberto Lacalle de Herrera, (; &quot;Lacalle&quot; locally or ; born 13 July 1941), is a Uruguayan politician and lawyer who served as the 36th president of Uruguay from 1990 to 1995. A member of the National Party, he previously served as National Representative from 1972 to 1973, and as Senator of the Republic from 1985 to 1990.

Lacalle was born and raised in Montevideo. He is the grandson of Luis Alberto de Herrera who led the National Party and founded one of its most prominent sectors. He attended the Jesuit Colegio Seminario and graduated from the University of the Republic in 1964 with a law degree. In his youth he worked as a journalist in some media outlets. From 1972 to 1973 he served as National Representative for the Montevideo Department, but lost his seat after the dissolution of parliament with the coup d&#x27;état carried out by President Juan María Bordaberry.

Lacalle was elected president in the 1989 election, which marked the return of the National Party to government since it was the ruling political group in the National Council of Government from 1963 to 1967, and the first election of a president for that party since Bernardo Prudencio Berro in 1860. His presidency was characterized by a liberal economic policy in line with the Washington Consensus. He carried out a fiscal adjustment and a reform to state-owned companies to deregulate them. This earned him opposition from the left and the union movement. In foreign policy, the Lacalle government signed the Treaty of Asunción that established the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR).

After leaving office in 1995, Lacalle continued in active politics. In 1999 he ran for president again, finishing in third place. In 2004 he ran in the National Party presidential primaries, but was defeated by Jorge Larrañaga, who was the party&#x27;s candidate in the general election. In 2009 he was a presidential candidate again but was defeated in the second round by the Broad Front nominee, José Mujica, who was elected president. With the victory of his son, Luis Lacalle Pou, in the 2019 general election, the two became the third father–son pair to serve as the nation&#x27;s president.

== Early life and education ==
Lacalle in was born in Montevideo on 13 July 1941, the son of Carlos Pedro Lacalle Nuñez and María Hortensia de Herrera de Lacalle. He is of Basque and Spanish descent. His mother was the daughter of Luis Alberto de Herrera, a prominent politician of the National Party.

He attended Colegio Seminario and joined the National Party at the age of 17. He graduated from the University of the Republic&#x27;s law school in 1964.

== Early political career (1958–1972) ==
Lacalle endorsed his grandfather Luis Alberto de Herrera in the 1958 election, in which the National Party obtained a historic victory after 93 years in the opposition and became the ruling political group in the National Council of Government.

In 1961 he started working as a journalist for &quot;Clarín&quot;, writing articles and columns. In the 1971 election, he was elected National Representative for the Montevideo Department and kept his seat until the 1973 coup, when President Juan María Bordaberry dissolved parliament. 

== Opposition to the dictatorship (1973–1985) ==
Lacalle was an opponent of the civil-military dictatorship and was imprisoned for several weeks. When he was released he was part of the clandestine opposition to the regime.

In August 1978, Lacalle was sent three bottles of wine tainted with poison addressed to himself and two fellow National Party members (Mario Heber and Carlos Julio Pereyra) who had been trying to negotiate a way out of the military regime. Lacalle&#x27;s wife warned him against the suspicious gift, but Heber&#x27;s wife drank a glass, dying immediately. The case remains unsolved.

He campaigned for the &quot;NO&quot; option in the 1980 constitutional referendum. In 1981, within the framework of the campaign for the 1982 primary elections in which there was a greater democratic opening, Lacalle founded the Congreso Nacional Herrerista (), a sector within the National Party. In the 1984 general election that ended the dictatorship, he endorsed Alberto Zumarán for president, who was defeated by Julio María Sanguinetti. However, Lacalle was elected Senator of the Republic.

== National leadership (1985–1990) ==
Following the 1984 election, Lacalle served as Senator of the Republic in the 42nd Legislature. In 1987 he was appointed vice president of the Senate. In this period he increased his political profile and began to be compared to John F. Kennedy.

== Presidency (1990–1995) ==

===1989 election===
In 1989 he ran for the presidency for his faction, Herrerismo, with Gonzalo Aguirre as his running-mate. In the 1989 general election, governed by the &quot;Ley de Lemas&quot; system, Lacalle received the most votes of any presidential candidate, while his party was the most voted political group. Under the Ley de Lemas system, the highest finishing candidate of the most-voted party was elected president. 

He took office on March 1, 1990 for a five-year term. He formed a coalition with some factions of the Colorado Party, called &quot;Coincidencia Nacional&quot; ().

===Tenure===
Upon taking office, Lacalle sent parliament a tax reform bill which was immediately passed with the support of the Colorado Party. Sales tax were increased from 21% to 22% income tax was increased and a few other taxes were created. During his rule, he encouraged a free market program, participated in the Brady bonds plan to alleviate foreign debt obligations, and was a co-founder of the Mercosur, along with the presidents of Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina, which came into effect with the Treaty of Asunción in 1991.

In 1992, support for his economic reforms suffered a heavy blow when one of his most significant initiatives, a plan to privatize Uruguay&#x27;s state-owned companies, was rejected by referendum.

In the 1994 national elections, he selected his Interior Minister, Juan Andrés Ramírez to be the presidential candidate of the Herrerismo faction. The National Party narrowly lost the elections to the Colorado Party.

Among several prominent politicians who took part in his government are Héctor Gros Espiell, Sergio Abreu, Juan Andrés Ramírez, Carlos Cat and Ignacio de Posadas.
==Later runs for the presidency==
In 1999, he won his party&#x27;s primary elections against Juan Andrés Ramírez (who had split from the Herrerismo) and several other candidates, and was a candidate for presidency again. However, a string of accusations about corruption in his government damaged his chances. Ramírez&#x27;s departure from active politics after losing the primary was the final blow, and Lacalle came in third place with 22.3% of the votes in the general elections.

Lacalle ran again for president in the 2004 elections, but the other party leaders had gathered around a single opposing candidate, Jorge Larrañaga, who defeated him in the primaries by a 2-to-1 margin. In 2009, he ran for the presidency again, this time defeating Jorge Larrañaga in the June primaries. By winning the primary election, he became head of the governing board of the party. He lost the presidential elections to José Mujica in a run-off election in November.

Lacalle is a member of the Club de Madrid. and he is member of the board of the Public Affairs Committee of the Jerusalem Summit.

==Personal life==
Lacalle is married to María Julia Pou Brito del Pino (born 1946); they have four children, Pilar Lacalle Pou, President Luis Lacalle Pou, economist Juan José Lacalle Pou and Manuel Lacalle Pou. Luis Alberto Lacalle Pou was the 2014 presidential candidate of the National Party and once again in 2019. On both occasions, he entered the second round but in 2019 he won, and became president elect of Uruguay, for the 2020–2025 term.

<text>Santa Fe Opera (SFO) is an American opera company, located north of Santa Fe, New Mexico. After creating the &quot;Opera Association of New Mexico&quot; in 1956, its founding director, John Crosby, oversaw the building of the first opera house on a newly acquired former guest ranch of . The company has presented operas each summer festival season since July 1957, and is internationally known for introducing new operas as well as for its productions of the standard operatic repertoire. Five operas are presented each season during the summer. 

Since its inception, Santa Fe Opera has staged 45 American premieres and 18 world premieres, including &quot;Emmeline&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs&quot;, &quot;Adriana Mater&quot;, and &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;.

==General history==

John Crosby, who was a New York-based conductor, founded the company in 1956, initially with the financial support of his parents, who helped in the acquisition of the land and the building of the first opera house. One goal was to give American singers the opportunity to learn and perform new roles while having ample time for rehearsal and preparation in the context of a summer festival situation with the presentation of five operas in repertory. Its first season began on 3 July 1957 with a performance of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; with a seating capacity of nearly 500. 

Crosby remained as general director until 2000, the longest general directorship in US opera history. Richard Gaddes served as the company&#x27;s general director from 2000 through 2008. In November 2007, SFO named Charles MacKay the company&#x27;s third general director, effective 1 October 2008. In August 2017, the company announced the intention of MacKay to stand down as its general director after the 2018 season.

In addition to being the opera company&#x27;s founding general director, Crosby had simultaneously served as its &quot;de facto&quot; first principal conductor. Alan Gilbert became the company&#x27;s first music director from 2003 to 2006. Kenneth Montgomery, a regular guest conductor starting in 1982, served as interim music director for the 2007 season. In July 2007, Edo de Waart was named as chief conductor, effective 1 October 2007, with an initial contract was of four years. He was the first conductor to hold that title with the company However, in November 2008, the company announced that de Waart stood down from the post before the end of his contract, with de Waart citing health and family reasons for this decision. In May 2010, the company announced the appointment of Frédéric Chaslin as the company&#x27;s next chief conductor, effective 1 October 2010, with an initial contract of three years. However, in August 2012, Chaslin resigned as the Opera&#x27;s chief conductor. In April 2013, the company announced simultaneously the appointments of Harry Bicket as its next chief conductor, effective 1 October 2013, and of Montgomery as conductor laureate for the 2013 season. In November 2016, the company announced the extension of Bicket&#x27;s contract as chief conductor through 30 September 2020.

In February 2018, the company announced the appointments of Robert K. Meya as its next general director and of Alexander Neef as its first-ever artistic director, and the elevation of Harry Bicket from chief conductor of the company to its music director, with three appointments effective as of 1 October 2018. In October 2018, the company announced the extension of Bicket&#x27;s contract as music director through the 2023 season. Neef stood down as artistic director in 2021, following his appointment to the Opéra national de Paris. In February 2021, the company announced the appointment of David Lomelí to its newly created post of chief artistic officer, a combination of the past posts of artistic director and director of artistic administration, effective 1 May 2021.

==Programming and organizational philosophy==
From the beginning, certain characteristics of what was to become a typical season emerged. It runs annually from late June or the beginning of July to the third week of August, with five operas presented in rotating repertory.

Generally, from the time of Crosby&#x27;s inception of the company, two popular operas opened the season. An American (or world) premiere was generally in the program and these included works commissioned by the company. A lifelong lover of the operas of Richard Strauss, Crosby regularly scheduled one and presented many American premieres of the composer’s work, an example being the 1964 U.S. premiere of the 1938 &quot;Daphne&quot;. Finally, the fifth opera was often a rarely performed work. The same philosophy continues to the present day. For modern works, US premiere productions of contemporary operas include Thomas Adès&#x27; &quot;The Tempest&quot; (2006), Tan Dun&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Kaija Saariaho&#x27;s &quot;Adriana Mater&quot;, the July 2009 world premiere of &quot;The Letter&quot;, by composer Paul Moravec and librettist Terry Teachout, and the first full production of Lewis Spratlan&#x27;s &quot;Life Is a Dream&quot; in July 2010. World premieres have included Theodore Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Oscar&quot; (2013), Jennifer Higdon&#x27;s &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; (2015)., and Mason Bates&#x27; and Mark Campbell&#x27;s &quot;The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs&quot; (2017), and also &quot;M. Butterfly&quot; (2022) a re-envisioned and socially updated telling of &quot;Madama Butterfly.&quot; In a recent 2018 world premiere, &quot;Doctor Atomic&quot; was presented. The opera tells the story of the day before the atomic bomb was tested at the Trinity Site just a couple hundred miles south of Santa Fe and the man who helped to create it, J. Robert Oppenheimer. They are also scheduled this summer to premiere another American opera called &quot;The Righteous&quot; in 2024.

Santa Fe Opera House declared it would open its 2021 season in July. This post-pandemic decision led them to introduce a new position; Covid Compliance and Safety Manager. With a lead from Mike VanAartsen, the Santa Fe Opera began to build protocol surrounding the pandemic, working towards their upcoming season.Their COVID-safe protocols book pulls from VanAartsen&#x27;s experience with OSHA, federal COVID and Emergency regulations, and suggestions from the AGMA (American Guild of Musical Artists). Pushing to maintain their audience and keep appealing to the younger generations, simulcasts of the dress rehearsals and shows were broadcast outside as a drive-in theater. In the 2021 season, Santa Fe Opera put on four productions and returned to five the following year.

===Apprentice programs===
In his first season, Crosby created the Apprentice Singer Program, whereby eight young people were to be given living expenses and paid per performance to be members of the chorus and to cover (understudy) major roles. Unusual for its time in America in the 1950s, the Apprentice Singers Program helped young singers to make the transition from academic to professional life. To date, over 1,500 aspiring opera singers have participated. As Crosby noted:

: &quot;In this country young artists have to do something which is impossible – gain experience. But with our plan, these young people will be scheduled in small roles and will have the opportunity of working with their older brothers and sisters who have already won their spurs. To get such experience now, a young artist has to go to Europe.&quot;

The Apprentice Program for Technicians was added in 1965.

The program has formal academic goals in addition to the &quot;hands on&quot; experience provided by the preparation for and participation in professional productions. Seminars and master classes are conducted; singers receive coaching in voice, music, body movement, career counseling, and diction. Technical apprentices are provided with instruction in stage operations, stage properties, costume and wig construction, scenic art, wigs and make up, music services, and stage lighting.

The Apprentice Program for Singers and Technicians continues at The Santa Fe Opera today. Typically, about 1,000 aspiring young singers and 600 technicians apply; in 2014, 43 singers and almost 90 technical apprentices worked at the opera. The Santa Fe Opera offers the only technician apprentice program at an opera house with a budget larger than $15 million in the U.S. 

The singers act as the chorus for each opera, as well as performing small roles. In addition, apprentices &quot;cover&quot; some leading roles, and on occasion have been known to have performed, replacing contracted singers who have been indisposed.

The Technical Apprentices perform a variety of backstage functions. They are divided into five separate running crews: costumes, scenery, electrics, properties, and production/music services. These five crews perform the majority of work on the daily changeovers between the five operas of the summer season and also fill positions crucial to the live running of productions. At the end of the summer, the apprentice crews are invited to apply for staff positions for the two weekends of &quot;Apprentice Scenes&quot;, a showcase for the apprentice singers, and can serve as everything from costume and lighting designers, to lighting and stage supervisors, to follow spot operators and assistant stage managers and more. There is even an apprentice technicians program for young local high school students who can use what they&#x27;ve learned in school and bring it to a worksite. 

===Notable past apprentices===
Some major American opera singers who have been company apprentices include the sopranos Susanna Phillips (2004), Judith Blegen (1961), Ashley Putnam (1973 and 1975), and Celena Shafer (1999–2000); mezzos Joyce DiDonato (1995), Susan Quittmeyer (1978), and Michelle DeYoung (?); tenors Carl Tanner (1992,93), William Burden (1989–90), Richard Croft (1978), Chris Merritt (1974–75), and Neil Shicoff (1973); baritones David Gockley (1965–67; later general manager of the Houston Grand Opera and the San Francisco Opera) and Sherrill Milnes (1959); and basses Mark Doss (1983), James Morris (1969) and Samuel Ramey (1966).

Many former apprentice singers have returned to perform major roles with the company. These have included Mark Doss in the 2011 &quot;Faust&quot;; Joyce DiDonato in the 2006 &quot;Cendrillon&quot; (and again in 2013 in &quot;La donna del lago&quot;); Chris Merritt also in 2006 in &quot;The Tempest&quot;; Carl Tanner in the 2005 production of &quot;Turandot&quot;; and Joyce El-Khoury (2006 and 2008 Apprentice Singer) as Micaëla in the 2014 production of &quot;Carmen&quot;. Beth Clayton, an apprentice singer during the 1995 season, returned in 2002 in the production of &quot;Eugene Onegin.&quot; 

==Theatres and other facilities==

There have been three theatres on the present site of The Santa Fe Opera&#x27;s approximately (now) 150 acres of land. Each has been located on the same site on a mesa, with the audience facing West toward an ever-changing horizon of sunsets and thunderstorms, frequently visible throughout many productions when no backdrops are used. In the first two theaters, the exposure to weather caused occasional cancellations, postponements, or extended intermissions. The rain, the want to improve acoustics, improve patron facilities, comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and provide more seating led to the making of the Crosby Theater.

Three features distinguish each of the Santa Fe Opera theaters from any conventional opera house. There is no fly system to allow for scenery to be lowered from above. There is no proscenium arch which does include no curtain and no means for projecting surtitles. And, the sides of the house are open and the rear of the stage may be completely opened to provide westward views.

Performances begin close to sunset, so that the lighting of the productions is not compromised by the sides of the theatre being open to the outside environment. Since the 2011 season, the starting time has been moved up by one half-hour from the original 9pm time. More social aspects of the performance starting time include giving opera-goers the opportunity to observe New Mexico sunsets against the surrounding landscape and the tradition of tailgate dining.

===Original theatre, 1957 to 1967===
The totally open-air theatre was designed to seat 480 and was built for $115,000 on a site carefully selected by Crosby and an acoustician friend, who fired off a series of rifle shots until they found the perfect natural location for an outdoor theatre. It was &quot;the only outdoor theatre in America exclusively designed for opera&quot;. Audience members sat on benches. The Santa Fe firm of McHugh, Hooker, Bradley P. Kidder and Associates were architects for the original theatre; lead architects John W. McHugh and Van Dorn Hooker worked with the acoustical engineer Jack Purcell of Bolt, Beranek and Newman (Boston and Los Angeles). The structural design calculations were performed by Sergio Acosta, a structural engineer and immigrant from Panama who graduated from the University of Texas and was a resident of Albuquerque, NM from 1948 until his death at age 78.

This was the location of the inaugural performance on opening night, 3 July 1957. &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; played to a sold-out crowd. By the end of the eight-week season, the 12,000 people who attended accounted for sales at 90% of capacity.

A mezzanine was added in 1965 but, on 27 July 1967, four weeks into the season, a fire destroyed the theatre, causing the company to move to a local downtown high school for the remainder of the season. From the Sweeney Gymnasium, they created the &quot;Sweeney Opera House&quot;, and completed the season, albeit without most of the original costumes or sets. A huge fund-raising operation took place, backed by Igor Stravinsky, and $2.4 million was raised to rebuild the theatre in time for the following season.

===Rebuilt theatre, 1968 to 1997===

The second theatre, a new open-air house seating 1,889, was ready for the start of the new season on 26 June 1968. Just like the company&#x27;s opening night in 1957, it presented Puccini’s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;.

The new theatre was also designed by McHugh and Kidder. One of its principal features was the partial opening of the roof towards the middle of the orchestra section, provided by the curving, audience-facing slope of the stage roof and the thrust of the mezzanine and rear orchestra roof forward. Also, the auditorium&#x27;s sides were open, as was the rear of the stage (although sliding doors could be closed). It provided for spectacular Westward views – as well as giving some centrally located audience members a view of the night sky.

Most of the new theatre&#x27;s backstage facilities, including scenery construction and storage and costume and props production, were actually constructed below the stage level in order to preserve the open views to the West. Additionally, a large elevator, located immediately behind the stage and known as the &quot;B-Lift&quot;, was included and it became the means whereby scenery could be moved up one level from the scene construction shop to the stage or up or down two levels to or from the large scenery storage area located three levels below the stage. The elevator still remains in place.

===Crosby Theatre, since 1998===

It was renamed the Crosby Theatre not only to honor the founder&#x27;s death in 2002, but also used to reflect the contributions of his parents, the present theatre was designed by the architectural firm headed by James Polshek of New York.

It was built during extensive reconstruction, which followed the tearing down of the auditorium of the 1968 theatre at the end of the opera season in late August 1997. The stage and backstage facilities such as dressing rooms and the costume shop as well as the scenery construction shop remained in place. The new theatre was completed in ten months for an early July 1998 opening of a new season. Like the previous opening nights of 1957 and 1968, it featured a performance of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; this time sung by Miriam Gauci, the Maltese soprano who had her debut in the same role at the SFO in 1987.

With fewer storm-related problems (and, with a higher stage roof providing a better view of the Westward landscape), the theatre now seats 2,128 plus 106 standees, although it has a strikingly intimate feel. It added a wider and more complete roof structure, with the new front and rear portions supported by cables and joined together with a clerestory window. This offers protection from the sky, but with the sides remaining open to the elements. The presence of wind baffles and, since 2001, Stieren Hall, the orchestra&#x27;s rehearsal hall, has helped improve exposure on the southern, windward side of the auditorium. A performance of &quot;The 13th Child&quot; on August 9, 2019, was paused for twenty minutes due to inclement passing weather, a first in the Santa Fe Opera&#x27;s history. 

In 1999, as an alternative to installing a translation system using the projected supertitles (or surtitles), an electronic titles system was installed in the Crosby Theatre. Invented by Figaro Systems of Santa Fe (and only the second one installed after the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s &quot;Met Titles&quot; in 1995), the system provides small rectangular electronic screens in front of each patron&#x27;s seat, showing a two-line translation of the sung text in either English or Spanish. The system has the possibility of handling up to six languages.

Along with operas, the Crosby Theatre has also played host to numerous concerts in recent years, such as: The B-52s, Wilco, and also St. Vincent and Andrew Bird. 

===Stieren Orchestra Hall===
Completed for the 2001 season under the patronage of Arthur and Jane Stieren, the hall fulfills the long-standing need for an orchestra rehearsal hall. Constructed on three levels with a total of , the building is also used for lectures, recitals, and social events.

On its main level, guide rails attached to the ceiling indicate the dimensions of the theatre&#x27;s main stage and offstage wings. This allows for scenery to be placed correctly, with access via large sliding doors from the scenery deck level, thus allowing fully staged rehearsals. The upper level contains rehearsal studios for one-on-one coaching for singers while the lower level features a large air-conditioned costume storage facility. The roof of Stieren Orchestra Hall is home to 135 solar panels as the SFO begins to move towards solar power.

===Rehearsal halls===

Eight rehearsal halls exist on the campus grounds. They vary in size from the reproduction of the full-scale of the Crosby Theatre&#x27;s stage and down to individual coaching studios for one-on-one coaching. Of the former group, the newest, completed for the 2010 season, is the Richard Gaddes Rehearsal Hall. It complements the existing full-size O&#x27;Shaughnessy Hall, which was rehabilitated for the 2012 season. In addition, six other halls of varying sizes allow several productions to be rehearsed simultaneously.

===Dapples Pavilion, new cantina===

The original &quot;cantina&quot; dating from the 1970s was completely torn down after the 2007 season and construction of a new one was completed in time for the opening of the 2008 season. It contains modern kitchen facilities, new serving stations, and generally good protection from the rain for its patrons. Its arching roof matches the architectural lines of the Crosby Theatre and it bears some resemblance to the roofline of Denver Airport.

Now known as the Dapples Pavilion (named after long-time supporter Florence Dapples), the cantina supplies season-long food and drink for the staff and artists from breakfast time to mid-afternoon. In addition, it functions as the location for pre-performance Preview Buffet dinners for up to about 200 members of the general public in the evenings. The evening includes an introductory talk about the evening&#x27;s opera.

<doc id="726178" wikidata="Q1130676" url="?curid=726178" title="Naked Came the Stranger">
<text>Naked Came the Stranger is a 1969 novel written as a literary hoax poking fun at the American literary culture of its time. Though credited to &quot;Penelope Ashe&quot;, it was in fact written by a group of twenty-four journalists led by &quot;Newsday&quot; columnist Mike McGrady.

McGrady&#x27;s intention was to write a book that was both deliberately terrible and contained a lot of descriptions of sex, to illustrate the point that popular American literary culture had become mindlessly vulgar. The book fulfilled the authors&#x27; expectations and became a bestseller in 1969; they revealed the hoax later that year, further spurring the book&#x27;s popularity.

==Hoax==
Mike McGrady was convinced that popular American literary culture had become so base—with the best-seller lists dominated by the likes of Harold Robbins and Jacqueline Susann—that any book could succeed if enough sex was thrown in. To test his theory, in 1966 McGrady recruited a team of &quot;Newsday&quot; colleagues (according to Andreas Schroder, nineteen men and five women) to collaborate on a sexually explicit novel with no literary or social value whatsoever. McGrady co-edited the project with Harvey Aronson, and among the other collaborators were well-known writers including 1965 Pulitzer Prize winner Gene Goltz, 1970 Pulitzer Prize winner Robert W. Greene, and journalist Marilyn Berger.

The group wrote the book as a deliberately inconsistent hodge-podge, with each chapter written by a different author. Some of the chapters had to be heavily edited, because they were originally too well written. The book was submitted for publication under the pseudonym &quot;Penelope Ashe&quot; who was portrayed by McGrady&#x27;s sister-in-law Billie Young for photographs and meetings with publishers. The back of the first print run&#x27;s dust jacket features a black-and-white picture of a fully clothed Young with her pet Afghan Hound and the accompanying caption &quot;PENELOPE ASHE is a demure Long Island housewife...&quot;

The publisher, Lyle Stuart, was an independent publisher then known for controversial books, many with sexual content. According to Stuart, he had appropriated the cover photo (a kneeling nude woman with very long hair down her back, photographed from behind) from a Hungarian nudist magazine; the model and photographer later demanded and received payment.

==Synopsis==
Gillian and William Blake are the hosts of a popular New York City breakfast radio chat show, &quot;The Billy &amp; Gilly Show&quot;, where they play the perfect couple. When Gillian finds out that her husband is having an affair, she decides to cheat on him with a variety of men from their Long Island neighborhood. Most of the book is taken up by vignettes describing Gilly&#x27;s adventures with a variety of men, from a progressive rabbi to a mobster.

The first chapter introduces the Blakes and the book&#x27;s plot, with the thirteen subsequent ones titled and about the characters seduced by Gillian (actual writers in parentheses). 
* Billy and Gilly 
* Ernie Miklos 
* Morton Earbrow (George Vecsey) 
* Joshua Turnbull (Jack Schwartz) 
* Arthur Franhop 
* Mario Vella 
* Marvin Goodman 
* Alan Hetterton 
* Paddy Madigan 
* Taylor Hawkes (William McIlwain Jr.) 
* Ansel Varth 
* Melvin Corby 
* Willoughby Martin (Gene Goltz) 
* Zoltan Caradoc 

==Reception==
The book fulfilled McGrady&#x27;s cynical expectations, and sales soon reached 20,000 copies, whereupon the co-authors decided to go public, in August 1969. The male authors gave their confession on &quot;The David Frost Show&quot;, after being introduced as &quot;Penelope Ashe&quot; and walking out on stage, single file, as the orchestra played the song &quot;A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody&quot;. The revelation of the true origins of the book prompted more sales with the book selling approximately 90,000 copies by October 13, 1969. By the end of the year, the book had spent 13 weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best-Seller List, although by that time its authorship was common knowledge. It is unclear how much of the book&#x27;s success was due to its content and how much to publicity about its unusual origin. Profits from its book sales were equally distributed amongst all 25 contributors. As of May 2012, the book&#x27;s publisher reported the book had sold 400,000 copies.

In 1970, McGrady published &quot;Stranger Than Naked, or How to Write Dirty Books for Fun and Profit&quot;, which told the story of the hoax.

==Film==

&quot;Naked Came the Stranger&quot; was adapted in 1975 as directed by Radley Metzger and starring Darby Lloyd Rains. As reported by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Mr. McGrady and the other writers had nothing to do with the hardcore film with the same title. They did, however, see the movie at a Times Square theater. During one vivid scene, Aronson told &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;, someone shouted &#x27;Author, Author!&#x27; &#x27;Seventeen of us stood up.

<text>Area 7 is a novel written by the Australian thriller writer Matthew Reilly. It is his fourth book, published in 2001, and is the sequel to &quot;Ice Station&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The President of the United States is visiting America&#x27;s most secret military installation, Area 7. Assigned to his protective detail is Shane Schofield and his team of Marines including Gunnery Sergeant Gena &#x27;Mother&#x27; Newman, Staff Sergeant Elizabeth &#x27;Fox&#x27; Gant and Buck &#x27;Book II&#x27; Riley Jr. They are plunged into a race for survival when an Air Force general, Charles &quot;Caesar&quot; Russell, unleashes a plan he has been working on for over 15 years. Despite being &#x27;executed&#x27; on the day of the president&#x27;s inauguration, Caesar is revived, and with a squadron of 50 elite Air Force soldiers (the 7th Squadron), have taken control of Area 7 and initiated a lockdown. A transmitter, attached to the president&#x27;s heart before he was elected, has been activated; a satellite sends and receives messages to and from this transmitter, which is powered by the kinetic energy of the president&#x27;s heart beating. If the satellite does not receive the messages from the transmitter, 14 Type-240 Blast Plasma-based nuclear warheads in the airports of the major cities of the United States will explode, destroying these cities, and making way for a new, racist, Confederate America. As long as the President&#x27;s heart beats, the messages will be sent to the satellite, and the nuclear warheads will not detonate. To prevent the president from trying to escape Area 7, Caesar also overrode the launch codes on the Nuclear Football so that to prevent the detonation of the warheads, the president must place his hand on the fingerprint sensor on the Football (that is being kept in Caesar&#x27;s possession) every 90 minutes.

While moving through the underground complex Gant and her group, including the president, come to a cell block and find a scientist locked inside one of the cells. After being released and questioned, it is discovered that the prisoners being held at Area 7 are &quot;volunteers&quot; that the scientists use to carry out experiments. It soon comes to light that there are ways of opening exits out of Area 7, and that two have already been opened by another scientist, Dr Gunther Botha. In addition to opening two exits, Botha has also shut down main power to the complex, so that it is now running on auxiliary power. Meanwhile, Schofield and his group, after fleeing from the ground level hangar, make their way into the sublevels where they find a bedroom of a 6-year-old boy named Kevin who lives in a cube. Schofield&#x27;s group then meets up with Riley&#x27;s group, and the president reveals that the reason for his visit to Area 7 is to check on the progress of a vaccine being developed for the Sinovirus, a genetically engineered virus that differentiates between the amount of pigmentation in a person&#x27;s skin, allowing it to target only people of a specific race (however people of Asian descent are immune). The president explains that to develop a vaccine for the Sinovirus (and protect America from biological weapons containing the Sinovirus) the scientists had to create a genetically engineered human, a boy named Kevin, whose blood could be used to produce antibodies, and the prisoners being held at Area 7 are used as guinea pigs to test the vaccine. Botha is killed during a chase on Lake Powell the President and Scarecrow escape to Area 8. When they reach it they realise Echo unit from the 7th squadron are being paid 120 million American dollars by the Chinese government to bring Kevin to them. Schofield and the President follow onto the 747 which has a mounted X-38 in an attempt to rescue Kevin. Schofield hijacks the X-38, escaping with the president and Kevin. Later, Schofield and Gant finally face off with Caesar back in Area 7.

<text>&lt;noinclude&gt;
Oaxaca is a state in Southeastern Mexico that is divided into 570 municipalities, more than any other state in Mexico. According to Article 113 of the state&#x27;s constitution, the municipalities are grouped into 30 judicial and tax districts to facilitate the distribution of the state&#x27;s revenues. It is the only state in Mexico with this particular judicial and tax district organization. Oaxaca is the tenth most populated state with inhabitants as of the 2020 Mexican census and the fifth largest by land area spanning .

Municipalities in Oaxaca have some administrative autonomy from the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president () by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council () responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

The largest municipality by population as of the 2020 census is Oaxaca de Juárez, seat of the state capital, with 270,955 residents (6.55% of the state&#x27;s total), while the smallest is Santa Magdalena Jicotlán with 81 residents, the least populated municipality in Mexico. The largest municipality by land area is Santa María Chimalapa which spans , and the smallest is Natividad with , also the smallest municipality by area in Mexico. The newest municipality is Chahuites, established in 1949.

<doc id="726200" wikidata="Q2289193" url="?curid=726200" title="Sierra Nevada Brewing Company">
<text>Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. was established in 1979 by homebrewers Ken Grossman and Paul Camusi in Chico, California, United States. The brewery produced in 2010, and as of 2016, Sierra Nevada Brewing is the seventh-largest brewing company in the United States and is the third largest privately owned brewery in the United States. 

The brewery was named &quot;Green Business of the Year&quot; by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 2010 for its practices in sustainability. In 2014, a second brewery location was opened in Mills River, North Carolina.

Sierra Nevada is considered one of the earliest and most influential American craft breweries in the latter half of the 20th century.

==History==
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. was founded in 1980, with founders Ken Grossman and Paul Camusi expanding their homebrewing hobby into a brewery in Chico, California. Along with the brewery&#x27;s location, Grossman says the company&#x27;s name comes from his love of hiking in the mountains of the Sierra Nevada. With $50,000 in loans from friends and family, Grossman and Camusi rented a warehouse and pieced together discarded dairy equipment and scrapyard metal to create their brewing equipment. They later were able to acquire second-hand copper brewing kettles from Germany before moving to their larger, current brewing facility in 1989.

The first batch brewed on premises was its Pale Ale, in November 1980. The following year, the brewery introduced Celebration, an IPA, which continues to be released as a winter seasonal. The company sold of beer in its first year and doubled that amount in the second.

The company&#x27;s first employee was Steve Harrison, who was put in charge of marketing and sales. Head brewer Steve Dresler was hired in 1983, when its output was 25 to 30 barrels per week, and retired in 2017.

The company distributed the beer itself in the early 1980s, struggling with financial and marketing problems. A 1982 article in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; highlighting the brewery, as well as having its beer sold in prominent restaurants such as Berkeley&#x27;s Chez Panisse, helped establish a market for Sierra Nevada&#x27;s beer.

By 1987, the brewery was distributing to seven states and production had reached per year, causing the company to pursue building a new brewery. In 1988, the brewery moved into a 100-barrel brewhouse, with four open fermenters, and eleven secondary fermenters. A year later, Grossman and Camusi added the Sierra Nevada Taproom and Restaurant, which serves lunch and dinner and includes a giftshop. In 2000, the brewery opened &quot;The Big Room&quot;, a live-music venue located inside the brewery&#x27;s facilities, featuring a variety of acts including country, bluegrass, folk, rock, blues, and other musical genres.

Camusi retired in 1998 and sold his share in the company to Grossman.

In 2010, Sierra Nevada Brewing partnered with the Abbey of New Clairvaux, with the monastery beginning production of Trappist-style beers in 2011. The Abbey has not yet been sanctioned by the International Trappist Association, and therefore the monastery will not be brewing official Trappist beer.

The brewery employed about 450 people in 2011.
In January 2012, Sierra Nevada announced it would build a second brewing facility with an attached restaurant in Mills River, North Carolina. The LEED-Platinum-certified building opened in early 2014 on a forested tract adjacent to Asheville Regional Airport, re-using the cut-down trees as lumber both in the building and for the rainwater cisterns that flush the toilets.

From 2013-2022, the company operated the &quot;Torpedo Room&quot; in Berkeley, their first tasting room outside of Chico.

In January 2017, Sierra Nevada issued a voluntary recall of certain 12-ounce bottles of different beers in 36 states due to a manufacturing defect that had possibly introduced chipped pieces of glass into the bottle.

==Influence==
Along with Anchor Brewing Company in San Francisco and the now-defunct New Albion Brewing Company in Sonoma, whose owners offered Grossman and Camusi early guidance in their venture, Sierra Nevada is considered one of the earliest and most influential breweries which spawned the craft beer movement of the 1980s-90s. Grossman has been dubbed a &quot;pioneer&quot; by fellow craft brewers in the United States.

Whereas many of the newly spawned microbreweries of the 1980s went out of business, Sierra Nevada Brewing endured to become one of the largest independent brewers in the country, whose beers were noted for their &quot;character and complexity&quot;. Grossman believed many microbrewers of the early 1980s had put out an inferior product due to lack of preparation for the financial and mechanical realities of commercial brewing, which were a &quot;much different process&quot; from homebrewing.

For its 30th anniversary in 2010, the company released a series of collaborative beers with the assistance of those Grossman considered an early influence on his brewing: Charlie Papazian, Fred Eckhardt, Fritz Maytag (Anchor) and Jack McAuliffe (New Albion).

In November 2010, Stansbury Publishing released &quot;Hops and Dreams: The Story of Sierra Nevada Brewing Co&quot;, written by California State University, Chico professor Rob Burton, who researched the company for three years.

The company has claimed to be neutral on political issues, and reiterated this stance in 2010 when it was erroneously linked by a beer industry group to opposing the California Proposition 19 of that year, which would have legalized marijuana in the state.

==Environmental record==
Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. won the US Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s &quot;Green Business of the Year&quot; award for 2010.

The brewery is powered by solar energy, having 10,000 photovoltaic modules covering its rooftops and parking lot. In all, the brewery uses 2.6 megawatts of solar electricity on premises. It also has built a charging station for electric vehicles on its premises.

The company uses a small-scale BioPro™ biodiesel processor to convert the used cooking oil from its restaurant for biodiesel use in its delivery trucks. In 2009, it reached an agreement with a local ethanol company to produce high-grade ethanol fuel from its discarded yeast. Spent grain is sold to local cattle ranchers for livestock feed; spent water is sent to the brewery&#x27;s own water treatment plant, where it is reused, mainly as drip irrigation for its fields. Over 99.5% of the brewery plant&#x27;s solid waste is diverted from landfill.

The company owns one mile of railway in Chico for use in intermodal freight transport, which aids in reducing the brewery&#x27;s carbon footprint. Each rail car can hold the equivalent of four semi-trailers of grain; rail transport is more fuel efficient than road transport.

Sierra Nevada is the largest buyer of organic hops in the United States. It also farms its own organic hops and barley for use in its annual Chico Estate Harvest Ale release.

Sierra Nevada Brewing Company&#x27;s Mills River, NC facility earned a LEED Platinum certification in June 2016 Sierra Nevada&#x27;s Mills River brewery is the only LEED Platinum certified brewery in the USA. The Mills River brewery is also a Platinum Zero Waste facility, certified by the US Zero Waste Business Council.

==Beers==

===Sierra Nevada Classics===

The brewery&#x27;s year-round offerings include its Pale Ale, Porter, Stout, Torpedo &#x27;Extra&#x27; IPA, Kellerweis Hefeweizen, and Hazy Little Thing.

Sierra&#x27;s flagship Pale Ale has been described as &quot;a balance between aggressive hops and hearty malt flavor&quot;, with its Cascade hops offering a grapefruit aroma and fruity palate. Like several other Sierra Nevada offerings, it is bottle-conditioned. It is the best-selling pale ale in the United States as of 2012.

Sierra Nevada&#x27;s Porter, along with its heavier Stout version, have been described by writer Michael Jackson as &quot;gently coffeish&quot; and &quot;beautifully roasty&quot; examples of their respective styles. The two offerings have been brewed since the company&#x27;s first year of operation.

Torpedo is an American India Pale Ale, and Kellerweis is a traditional Bavarian hefeweizen. Both were introduced as nationwide offerings in 2009.

===Seasonals===
The brewery&#x27;s current lineup of seasonals include Beer Camp Hoppy Lager, Summerfest Lager, Oktoberfest, and Celebration Ale.

Sierra Nevada&#x27;s Celebration Ale has been brewed as a winter seasonal since 1981. While it has won medals under the IPA category, it has also been described as a hoppy, malty amber ale, as well as a &quot;bigger version&quot; of the company&#x27;s pale ale.

Previous Autumn seasonal Tumbler Brown Ale has been described as a full-bodied, malt-heavy brown ale and is sold for the autumn months.

Previous Spring seasonal Ruthless Rye IPA is an IPA brewed with rye and whole-cone hops for the spring, while Summerfest is a pilsner brewed in the Czech tradition.

===Special release===


Annual &quot;Special Release&quot; beers produced by Sierra Nevada include Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale, Hemisphere Harvest Ales and Chico Harvest Estate Ale.

Bigfoot is brewed with two types of malt and three differing hops, and tops out at 9.6%ABV. It is a barleywine, but due to alcohol laws in the U.S. it must be marketed as a &quot;barleywine style ale&quot;. Only alcohols derived from fruits, not grains, can be marketed as wine. It first won medals at the Great American Beer Festival in 1987. It is generally released January–February of each year.

The brewery releases both a Northern and Southern Hemisphere Harvest &quot;wet hop&quot; ale. Introduced in 1996 as Harvest Ale, Northern Hemisphere utilizes wet (undried) hops from eastern Washington for its &quot;fresh harvest&quot; ale. It was the first fresh-hop ale brewed in the United States. The brewery later introduced Southern Hemisphere which features wet hops from New Zealand.

The Chico Estate Harvest Ale is brewed with organic wet hops and barley grown on the brewery&#x27;s premises.

Old Chico Crystal Wheat, a wheat beer, is named in memory of the Chico Brewery which operated in the town during the 19th century. Old Chico brand beers are only distributed in the northern California area around Chico.

The &quot;Resilience Butte County Proud IPA&quot; is a limited edition IPA, released to benefit recovery efforts for the Camp Fire, which impacted areas nearby Sierra Nevada&#x27;s Chico brewery in 2018; about 50 Sierra Nevada employees lost their homes in the fire. Resilience IPA is brewed at the Chico and Mills River, North Carolina breweries, and over 1,500 other breweries signed up to brew and sell the beer.

<text>A jockstrap, also a jock (male), jill (female), strap, cup, groin guard, pelvic protector (female), supporter, or athletic supporter, is an undergarment for protecting the scrotum and penis or vulva during contact sports or other vigorous physical activity. This article deals chiefly with the genital protective sports gear designed for the male body, colloquially known as a &quot;jock&quot;.

A jockstrap (males) consists of a waistband (usually elastic) with a support pouch for the genitalia and two elastic straps affixed to the base of the pouch and to the left and right sides of the waistband at the hip. The pouch, in some varieties, may be fitted with a pocket to hold an abdominal guard (impact resistant cup, box) to protect the testicles and the penis from injury.

The jillstrap ( a &quot;jill&quot;) is the female equivalent of the jockstrap, but is designed to protect the vulva from getting struck.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;jockstrap&quot; has purportedly been in use at least since 1891, a likely contraction of &quot;jockey strap&quot;, as the garment was first designed for bicycle-riding messengers and deliverymen, or &#x27;bike jockeys&#x27;. The Bike Jockey Strap was the first jockstrap manufactured in America in 1874.

Jockey meaning &#x27;rider&#x27;, primarily a race horse rider, has been in use since 1670. Jockey itself is the diminutive form of the Scots nickname Jock (for John) as Jackie is for the English nickname Jack. The nicknames Jack and Jackie, Jock and Jockey have been used generically for &#x27;man, fellow, boy, common man&#x27;. From the period &quot;c&quot;.1650–&quot;c.&quot;1850, &#x27;jock&#x27; was used as slang for penis.

The more recent American slang term &quot;jock&quot;, meaning an athlete, is traced to the period of 1953 to 1963, and is itself derived from &quot;jockstrap&quot; and &quot;jockey&quot;.

== History ==
The jockstrap was invented in 1874 by C. F. Bennett of a Chicago sporting goods company, Sharp &amp; Smith, to provide comfort and support for bicycle jockeys working the cobblestone streets of Boston. The original incarnation of the jockstrap resembled a thong, as it featured a strap that went between the buttocks. In 1897 Bennett&#x27;s newly formed Bike Web Company patented and began mass-producing the Bike Jockey Strap. The Bike Web Company later became known as the Bike Company. Bike, until 2003, was a stand-alone company. In that year, the company and its trademarks were purchased by Russell Athletic. Russell Athletic continued to produce jockstraps using the Bike brand and logos until 2017 when they retired the brand. Russell had become a Fruit-of-the-Loom subsidiary, and Fruit-of-the-Loom is owned by and part of Berkshire Hathaway. On April 15, 2021, the brand&#x27;s website reopened for online sales, featuring a modernized version of their trademark &quot;No. 10&quot; jockstrap, as well as active apparel. 

The jockstrap was also influential in early 20th-century medicine with the invention of the Heidelberg Electric Belt, a low-voltage electric powered jockstrap that claimed to cure kidney disorders, insomnia, erectile dysfunction, and other ailments. Today, jockstraps are still worn in the US by adolescent and adult men for sports, weightlifting, medical purposes, and for recovery from injury or surgery for such conditions as hematocele, inguinal hernia, hydrocele, or spermatocele.

In the early 2020s, jockstraps saw a renewed popularity as underwear for men with jockstraps finding favor in place of more conventional underwear as wearing them became a fashionable trend. The trend was reflected with the inclusion of the garment in the runways of various major designers including, Calvin Klein, JW Anderson, Gucci, and Rick Owens, alongside other large brands like Adidas, Diesel, and 2(x)ist making multiple styles.

== Design ==
Jockstraps are fairly consistent in design with variations appearing in details like width of waistband and fabrics. Some jockstraps are designed for specific sports: &quot;Swim jocks&quot;, for example, have a narrow waistband, and &quot;hockey jocks&quot; sometimes have adjustable elastic straps and garter clips that hold hockey socks in place while the bulky goalie protector has genital and abdominal foam padding. &quot;Windproof jockstraps&quot; have a special layer of fabric to protect the wearer from wind and cold in winter sports. Jockstraps are made in other materials as fetish wear. Aside from the aforementioned &quot;fashion jockstraps&quot;, the 2000s have seen a resurgence in jockstrap designs and brands.

Alternatives to jockstraps include the &quot;jock brief&quot;, or &quot;support briefs&quot;, which have the wide waistband of a jockstrap combined with a full seat and are made of an elastic supportive material. A thong style strap, sometimes called a &quot;dance belt&quot;, has one narrow elastic strap attached to the bottom of the pouch, passing between the legs and attaching to the waistband at the middle of the back. A strapless garment, called a &quot;jock sock&quot; or sometimes a &quot;slingshot&quot;, has only an elastic waist band with an elastic pouch that holds the genitals from the front.

In Europe, from the time of the Middle Ages, undergarments available were limited to a loose fitting trouser-like piece of clothing called a braies. This article of clothing was stepped into and then laced or tied around the waist and legs at about mid-calf and provided no support to the male genitals. This allowed the scrotum unlimited movement under clothing and resulted in injury from carts, carriages with wooden planks for seats or the saddle as the body took all of the force of the motion. The &quot;suspensory&quot; was developed around the early 1820s as a way to lift the scrotum away from the plank seat and saddle thereby preventing injury while in a cart, carriage or horseback riding. Today the &quot;suspensory&quot; is used primarily as a medical device after genital surgery to aid in post operative healing. General Custer&#x27;s suspensory can be seen in the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument museum, near Crow Agency Montana.

== Protective cup ==

Optional &quot;cups&quot; offer additional protection for contact sports and are made of hard plastic or steel, perforated for ventilation. A more flexible and comfortable &quot;soft cup&quot; is also offered for low contact sports such as soccer. A &quot;flex cup&quot; variation features a hard exterior melded with a soft lining.

A similar piece of protective equipment in the sport of cricket is known as a &quot;box&quot;. In cricket, a box is usually worn by only a batsman, a wicket-keeper, and sometimes other close-up fielders. For fielders farther from the batsman, the wearing of a box would impede their movement and running (for batsmen the benefits outweigh the disadvantages).

An abdominal guard (also called &quot;compression cup&quot;, &quot;box&quot;, or &quot;L Guard&quot;) is a hard usually plastic cup that is inserted in a jockstrap to protect male genitalia. Some jockstraps have a lined front pouch for this purpose. The abdominal guard is usually constructed from high density plastic with a padded edge, shaped like a hollow half-pear, and inserted into the jockstrap or jockstrap-style underwear of the batsmen and wicket-keeper. This is used to protect the genitals against impact from the ball.

Many sports require the use of an athletic cup. These include cricket, fencing, martial arts, boxing, lacrosse, hockey, baseball, paintball, football and many others.

Fashion jocks often incorporate soft-lined front pouches or they may be designed to bring the male genitalia forward or upward. The purpose of these modifications is to enhance the masculine appearance of the wearer. Wearers of fashion jocks may also wear abdominal guards for the same purpose.

With the decline in the use of jockstraps in sports, the use of the necessary abdominal guard has also declined despite the safety implications. Typically cups are worn in the pouch of a jockstrap which may be double-lined to hold the cup, or in compression shorts or sport-specific briefs.

Cups for some combat sports (e.g. mixed martial arts, kick boxing) have a waistband and straps attached directly to the cup designed to be worn over a regular jockstrap or briefs. Some sports such as boxing use an oversized cup and jock combined into a single item which has layered foam padding that protects the groin, kidneys and abdomen.

== Jockstraps for women ==
The pelvic protector is the female equivalent of the male jockstrap. It is currently unclear who was responsible for the first invention of the female pelvic protector. It is designed to protect the female genitalia from bruising or tearing. The area protected includes the entire vulva, including the clitoris, the clitoral hood and the delicate labia minora which protrude from the vulva in some women and are therefore especially vulnerable to bruising from impact. It is also occasionally nicknamed a &quot;jill&quot; or &quot;jillstrap&quot;. Women wear the garment during contact sports or activities. The garment cups around the genitals and is usually reinforced with rigid material.

==Gay subculture==
Since the 1950s and 1960s, some gay men use jockstraps as an erotic attire, particularly those belonging to the leather and BDSM subcultures. The garment has become especially popular between gay men and the LGBTQ community in the 2020s, with major brands producing rainbow-colored, pride-themed jockstraps.

<doc id="726230" wikidata="Q3386144" url="?curid=726230" title="Kimberly McCullough">
<text>Kimberly Anne McCullough (born March 5, 1978) is an American actress and television director. She is best known for her role as Robin Scorpio on the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;, a role which she originated at age seven, playing the character on and off from 1985 to 2000 and 2004 to 2018, in addition to 2021. She has subsequently taken a step back from acting in order to focus on directing.

McCullough has also played the character in one episode of the &quot;GH&quot; spinoff &quot;Port Charles&quot;, and in a few episodes of &quot;All My Children&quot;. In 2007 and 2008, she portrayed Robin as one of the leading characters in the primetime &quot;GH&quot; spinoff, &quot;General Hospital: Night Shift&quot;.

McCullough is also an ABC Director Fellow, shadowing other directors.

==Career==
In 1985, after failing to land a role on the TV sitcom &quot;Webster&quot;, McCullough auditioned for the role of Robin Scorpio, the 6-year-old daughter of Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers) and Anna Devane (director/actress Finola Hughes). The producers made her audition 12 times but eventually gave her the part and her role became a popular success.

In the fall of 1985, McCullough made her debut during the Asian Quarter storyline, which showcased her acting skills alongside veteran actor Keye Luke through the majority of the storyline. In 1989 at the age of 11, McCullough won her first Daytime Emmy Award, for &quot;Outstanding Juvenile Female in a Drama Series&quot;. One of her most memorable storylines began in 1995, when her teenage character contracted HIV after having unprotected sex with her boyfriend Stone, who was unknowingly infected with the virus and later died of AIDS. She won a second Daytime Emmy in 1996 for this storyline, once again for &quot;Outstanding Younger Leading Actress in a Drama Series&quot;. In 1996, she took a short break from playing the character when she went off to college for a brief stint at New York University Tisch School of the Arts from 1996 to 1997, although she never graduated or received a degree from the university. On &quot;General Hospital&quot;, Robin Scorpio was also written out for the same reason, except the character was attending Yale University to study medicine. Unlike many soap opera characters, her character of Robin Scorpio has never been &quot;sorased&quot; but has aged in real time along with McCullough.

In 1998, she returned to the show, but then left once again to pursue other acting opportunities, which included co-starring in the primetime drama series &quot;Once and Again&quot; and &quot;Joan of Arcadia&quot;. She also wrote and directed the mockumentary &quot;Lil Star&quot; about girls in childhood beauty pageants, a story which allowed McCullough to draw on her own experiences. In 2001 she appeared in the movie &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; as Amy, one of Elle Woods&#x27; sorority sisters. After brief returns to &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 2000 and 2004, she returned on a permanent basis in October 2005, with her character Robin Scorpio a doctor, having graduated from medical school. In November 2011, McCullough announced her plans to leave &quot;General Hospital&quot; once again in order to pursue a career as a director, and her character was believed to have died on February 21, 2012. However, scenes airing on March 27, 2012, showed Robin to be alive and held captive in an undisclosed location, leaving the door open for her to return in the future. Starting in July 2012, McCullough made several guest appearances on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, and returned to the role in 2013.

She again went off contract in 2018, announcing her retirement from acting to focus on a directing career. McCullough did make an appearance in 2021 to participate in an on-air tribute for actor John Reilly, who played Sean Donely.

In 2011, McCullough directed the short film &quot;Nice Guys Finish Last&quot;. The film starred Danielle Harris and McCullough&#x27;s &quot;General Hospital&quot; co-star Lexi Ainsworth.

==Personal life==

McCullough was born in Bellflower, California. She has two older brothers and is of Mexican descent. Her mother is a dance teacher, who took her to rehearsals, and got her involved with acting. McCullough&#x27;s first appearance was as a 7-month-old baby in a diaper commercial, co-starring with actress Juliet Mills. She started doing gymnastics at the age of 4, and performed as part of a group called the Gym Dandies. McCullough followed this up with a dancing part in &quot;Breakin&#x27; 2: Electric Boogaloo&quot;. McCullough dated actor Freddie Prinze Jr. from 1996 until 1999.

In a year-end blog post for 2015, McCullough revealed she had a miscarriage. In her 2016 Year End Wrap Up, she revealed she was pregnant again after her miscarriage. McCullough gave birth to her son, Otis, on June 7, 2017.

<doc id="726237" wikidata="Q7442964" url="?curid=726237" title="Second-hand Smoke">
<text>Second-hand Smoke is a compilation album by the band Sublime. It was released in 1997 following the death of lead singer Bradley Nowell the year before. Although this is technically a compilation album, it features some unreleased material as well as recycled and remixed versions of previous tracks. Even though the surviving members of Sublime (Eric Wilson and Bud Gaugh) stated that the band would not make any more albums after Nowell&#x27;s death, which would result in the band&#x27;s breakup, MCA bound them by their contract and made the remaining members follow out their contract with the next three albums. Instead of recording more albums with Sublime, Wilson and Gaugh would record together in their later projects Long Beach Dub Allstars and Sublime with Rome.

==Track listing==
==Songs==
The song &quot;Get Out!&quot; originally appeared on their debut album &quot;40 Oz. to Freedom&quot; but had to be removed when the album was picked up for distribution by MCA Records due to the presence of an unauthorized sample (which included bits of Jimmy Page&#x27;s guitar and a looped section of John Paul Jones&#x27; bassline from &quot;The Lemon Song&quot;). The samples were all removed or replaced and the song was re-released as &quot;Get Out! (remix)&quot; (the original version of &quot;Get Out!&quot; complete with the samples can be found on Sublime&#x27;s &quot;Bums Lie&quot; bootleg). &quot;Thanx Dub&quot; is a slightly longer instrumental version of the extended version of the song from the original cassette release of &quot;40 Oz. to Freedom&quot;.

Two of the previously unreleased songs, &quot;New Realization&quot; and &quot;Romeo&quot;, were recorded in 1988, very early in the band&#x27;s career.

The song &quot;Chick on My Tip&quot; is perceived as an entirely English language version of &quot;Chica Mi Tipo&quot; from &quot;40 Oz. to Freedom&quot; although the Spanish lyrics do not translate to the same content as in the English version. The title &quot;Chica Mi Tipo&quot; translates to the English &quot;My Type of Girl&quot;. The &quot;Second-hand Smoke&quot; version of this song was recorded in 1989, along with the other unreleased tracks &quot;Had a Dat&quot; and &quot;Slow Ride&quot; (which also appeared on the band&#x27;s 1991 demo tape &quot;Jah Won&#x27;t Pay the Bills&quot;).

&quot;Badfish&quot; and &quot;Saw Red&quot; are the only songs to appear on this album virtually unchanged from their original LP versions, however both songs appear to have been remastered, if not remixed entirely. Some instrument sounds in &quot;Saw Red&quot;, for example, come from the opposite stereo channel that they appeared on originally. Noteworthy of the song &quot;Saw Red&quot; is that Gwen Stefani sings a duet with Nowell; the song was originally released on the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Robbin&#x27; the Hood&quot; in 1994, and this was before Stefani&#x27;s band No Doubt hit mainstream success.

<doc id="726241" wikidata="Q581996" url="?curid=726241" title="Anti-inflammatory">
<text>Anti-inflammatory or antiphlogistic is the property of a substance or treatment that reduces inflammation or swelling. Anti-inflammatory drugs, also called anti-inflammatories, make up about half of analgesics. These drugs remedy pain by reducing inflammation as opposed to opioids, which affect the central nervous system to block pain signaling to the brain.

==Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs==

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alleviate pain by counteracting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme. On its own, COX enzyme synthesizes prostaglandins, creating inflammation. In whole, the NSAIDs prevent the prostaglandins from ever being synthesized, reducing or eliminating the inflammation and resulting pain.

Some common examples of NSAIDs are aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. The newer specific COX-inhibitors are not classified together with the traditional NSAIDs, even though they presumably share the same mode of action.

On the other hand, there are analgesics that are commonly associated with anti-inflammatory drugs but that have no anti-inflammatory effects. An example is paracetamol (known as acetaminophen in the U.S). Contrary to NSAIDs, which reduce pain and inflammation by inhibiting COX enzymes, paracetamol has—as early as 2006—been shown to block the reuptake of endocannabinoids, which only reduces pain, likely explaining why it has minimal effect on inflammation; paracetamol is sometimes combined with an NSAID (in place of an opioid) in clinical practice to enhance the pain relief of the NSAID, while still receiving the injury/disease modulating effect of NSAID-induced inflammation reduction (which is not received from opioid/paracetamol combinations).

===Side effects===
Long-term use of NSAIDs can cause gastric erosions, which can become stomach ulcers and in extreme cases can cause severe haemorrhage, resulting in death. The risk of death as a result of GI bleeding caused by the use of NSAIDs is 1 in 12,000 for adults aged 16–45. The risk increases almost twentyfold for those over 75. Other dangers of NSAIDs are exacerbating asthma and causing kidney damage. Apart from aspirin, prescription and over-the-counter NSAIDs also increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.

== Corticosteroids ==
Corticosteroids, specifically glucocorticoids or glucocorticoid receptor agonists, are powerful anti-inflammatory agents, but they are also powerful immunosuppressants and are associated with various toxicities, which constrains their use.

== Antileukotrienes ==
Antileukotrienes are anti-inflammatory agents which function as leukotriene-related enzyme inhibitors (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) or leukotriene receptor antagonists (cysteinyl leukotriene receptors), and consequently oppose the function of these inflammatory mediators. Although they are not used for analgesic benefits, they are widely utilized in the treatment of diseases related to inflammation of the lungs, such as asthma and COPD, as well as sinus inflammation in allergic rhinitis. They are also being investigated for use in diseases and injuries involving inflammation of the brain (e.g., Parkinson&#x27;s disease).

==Serotonergic psychedelics==
Various serotonergic psychedelics, acting as serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists, have been found to be powerful and highly potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents. In contrast to corticosteroids however, psychedelics with anti-inflammatory effects do not suppress the immune system. Some psychedelics are far more potent in their anti-inflammatory effects than in their psychedelic effects. For instance, (&quot;R&quot;)-DOI is 30- to &gt;50-fold more potent in producing anti-inflammatory effects than in producing psychedelic-like behavioral effects in preclinical research. Psilocin, the active form of psilocybin, has similar anti-inflammatory potency as (&quot;R&quot;)-DOI.

The potencies of psychedelics and other serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists as anti-inflammatory drugs vary, with 2C-I, DOIB, 2C-B, 4-HO-DiPT, DOI, 2,5-DMA, DOET, DOM, psilocin, and 2C-H being highly potent and fully efficacious anti-inflammatories; TMA-2, 2C-B-Fly, TCB-2, ETH-LAD, LSD, and 2C-T-33 being partially efficacious anti-inflammatories; and lisuride, 1-methylpsilocin, 5-MeO-DMT, and DMT having negligible efficacy.

Both non-hallucinogenic agents with full anti-inflammatory effects, such as 2,5-DMA, and non-anti-inflammatory agents with full psychedelic effects, such as DOTFM, are known. Hence, the psychedelic and anti-inflammatory effects of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists appear to be fully dissociable. These effects appear to be mediated by different intracellular signaling pathways, although the exact pathways are still under study.

Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists with anti-inflammatory effects but reduced psychedelic effects, such as 2C-iBu (ELE-02), are under development for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. They may also have applications in the treatment of neuroinflammation. The anti-inflammatory effects of psychedelics may be involved in the effects of psychedelic microdosing. Relatedly, LSD microdosing is being studied in the treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease for its anti-inflammatory effects.

Although some psychedelics have anti-inflammatory effects, many psychedelics are also potent serotonin 5-HT2B receptor agonists. This action, with repeated long-term use, has been implicated in the development of cardiac fibrosis and valvulopathy. This may also be the case with microdosing. However, the risks are theoretical, and more research is needed to see if these complications can actually occur with psychedelics. A preliminary animal study found that chronic microdosing of LSD did not result in heart structure changes or valvulopathy in rodents. Research appears to be mixed on whether LSD and psilocin are potent serotonin 5-HT2B receptor agonists or not.

<text>Judy and Mary (often stylized as JUDY AND MARY) was a Japanese rock band formed in 1991 in Japan by bassist Yoshihito Onda and vocalist Yuki, with drummer Kohta Igarashi and guitarist Taiji Fujimoto completing the lineup in 1992. Guitarist Takuya replaced Taiji the following year. The band is known for their innovative punk, rock, and pop meldings of noisy but melodic music in the 1990s.

== History ==
In 1992, Judy and Mary released an album and accompanying video, &quot;Be Ambitious&quot;, on the independent Chainsaw Records label. The band was soon signed by Epic/Sony Records and released their first major label single, &quot;Power of Love&quot;, in 1993. The band&#x27;s major label debut album, &quot;J.A.M&quot;, was released in 1994. Judy and Mary quickly became one of the most popular bands in Japan. Their song &quot;Sobakasu&quot; was used as the first opening theme for the anime television series &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, and sold over a million copies.

Judy and Mary released seven original albums, three compilation albums (through 2006) and twenty-two singles. The band dissolved in March 2001.

Yuki is now enjoying a successful solo career as YUKI. Takuya is also currently a solo artist. Onda joined the band Hot Rod Crue, but since 2008 has been a member, along with Igarashi, of the band Zamza.

<text>Tlaxcala is a state in Central Mexico that is divided into 60 municipalities. According to the 2020 Mexican census, it is the fifth least populated state with inhabitants and the 2nd smallest by land area spanning .

Municipalities in Tlaxcala are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) responsible for providing public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens, and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection, and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

The largest municipality by population is Tlaxcala, with 99,896 residents (7.43% of the state total), while the smallest is San Lucas Tecopilco with 3,077 residents. The largest municipality by land area is Tlaxco which spans , and the smallest is San Lorenzo Axocomanitla with . In 1995, 16 municipalities were created, the most recent being Benito Juárez, which was established on October 9, 1995.

<text>&quot;The One with the Fake Monica&quot; is the twenty-first episode of &quot;Friends&quot;″ first season. It first aired on the NBC network in the United States on April 27, 1995.

==Plot==
Monica finds out that someone has stolen her credit card and has been using it. When she receives the credit card statement she realises that the thief is doing all the things in life that she wishes she could do, including taking tap dancing lessons. She, Rachel and Phoebe decide to find the thief at the tap dance class and end up becoming her friends. In order to prevent suspicion, real Monica introduces herself as &quot;Monana&quot;. The four become good friends and Monica lives her life as recklessly as she wished she did. However, Fake Monica eventually gets caught and the real Monica visits her in jail and tells her that it was her credit card that was stolen. Monica admits that she did not turn her in and thanks her for inspiring her. She also decides to use this experience as a lesson to not just wish she did things, but actually do them.

Ross&#x27;s capuchin monkey, Marcel, reaches sexual maturity and will not stop trying to mate with objects and his leg. Ross decides that he can no longer take care of Marcel and so he looks for a zoo for him. After some frustrating attempts including an offer where Marcel would be pitted against other animals in combat, Marcel is eventually accepted into the San Diego Zoo and Ross, Chandler, Joey, Rachel and Phoebe say goodbye to him at the airport.

Joey&#x27;s agent, Estelle, suggests that he create a stage name because &quot;Joey Tribbiani&quot; is too ethnic. Chandler tricks him into using the name &quot;Joseph Stalin&quot;, only for him to be rejected at the audition upon finding out and being appalled about the dictator&#x27;s actions. Later, at the audition, Joey uses the name &quot;Holden McGroin&quot;, presumably having been tricked again.

==Production==
In one scene, Phoebe, sitting on the couch, can be seen playing Game Boy. Unusually though, she looks into the camera while doing so.

When Joey asks what his stage name should be, Phoebe replies with Flame Boy, presumably as she is playing Game Boy.

==Reception==
&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the episode a C, describing the episode as &quot;thin and hokey&quot; with a &quot;semi-sappy &quot;carpe diem&quot; theme that doesn&#x27;t jibe with the series&#x27; tone of slackeresque cynicism&quot;. They also said the monkey-humping joke gets annoying after a while.

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; were more positive about the episode, and called the tap dance scene a &quot;total gem&quot;.

&quot;Telegraph &amp; Argus&quot; ranked it #142 on their ranking of the 236 &quot;Friends&quot; episodes.

<doc id="726284" wikidata="Q1119841" url="?curid=726284" title="Ediacara Hills">
<text>Ediacara Hills ( ), also known as Ediacaran Hills, are a range of low hills in the northern part of the Flinders Ranges of South Australia, around north of the state capital of Adelaide. They are within the Nilpena Ediacara National Park.

The hills are known for being the location where significant trace fossils of a group of previously unknown lifeforms were discovered, and have given their name to the geological period known as the Ediacaran.

==Mining==
The area has many old copper and silver mines from mining activity during the late 19th century. Mining was first reported there in 1888, with an area becoming known as the Ediacara Mines after more costeans were dug. Attempts to mine the area were carried out as recently as 1967 by C.R.A. Exploration, which used diamond drilling to explore the ground, but this was abandoned after they proved fruitless. 

As of 2012, the area was still able to be accessed for &quot;licensed mineral exploration or mining activities&quot;.

==Fossil beds==
The hills also contain fossils of early multicellular life forms, the Ediacaran biota (lagerstätte), and have given their name to the Ediacaran.

There are two separate fossil sites within the region which have heritage protection: The Ediacara Fossil Site – Nilpena is listed on the Australian National Heritage List, while the Ediacara Fossil Reserve Palaeontological Site, located to its north, is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.

The hills are located within the locality of Ediacara, named primarily after the range itself, and within the Nilpena Ediacara National Park. They are also sometimes referred to as the Ediacaran Hills.

===IUGS geological heritage site===
In respect of &quot;the locality where well preserved Precambrian fossils of multicellular life were first found globally&quot; the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) included the &quot;Ediacaran fossils in the Ediacara Hills, Flinders Ranges&quot; in its assemblage of 100 geological heritage sites around the world in a listing published in October 2022. The organisation defines an IUGS Geological Heritage Site as &quot;a key place with geological elements and/or processes of international scientific relevance, used as a reference, and/or with a substantial contribution to the development of geological sciences through history&quot;.

== Word origin ==
The name &quot;Ediacara&quot; has a disputed origin from one of the Aboriginal languages near the Flinders Range area. It is first known to have been used during the middle of the 19th century. Earlier Australian sources suggested that the &quot;name &#x27;Ediacara&#x27; or &#x27;Idiyakra&#x27; may be derived from an Indigenous term associating it with a place near water&quot;.

Another theory suggests that the term may be a mispronunciation of the two words &quot;Yata Takarra&quot;, meaning hard or stony ground (&quot;in reference to the flat Ediacara plateau of dolomite that forms the centre of the Ediacara syncline&quot;). Supporting this latter contention, it has been argued that the word &quot;has nothing in it that corresponds to any word for water in any of the local languages&quot; and that local tradition &quot;has it that the name meant &#x27;granite plain&#x27;, but, since there appears to be no igneous rock in the area, this could well refer to the hardness of the ground, rather than to its geological composition&quot;. Adnyamathanha woman Beverley Patterson, who had heard stories since childhood about the fossils, said shortly before the opening of the national park in April 2023 that Ediacara was the Adnyamathanha word for the zebra finch, a bird endemic to the area.

However, there are a number of complications in trying to establish the origins of place names supposedly relating to Aboriginal words, and there is no definitive answer for Ediacara.

<doc id="726285" wikidata="Q2757513" url="?curid=726285" title="Sublime (album)">
<text>Sublime is the third studio album by American ska punk band Sublime. Produced by Paul Leary and David Kahne, the album was released on July 30, 1996 by MCA Records. It is their first release following the death of singer Bradley Nowell and is the final studio album to feature him.

By the time it came to record their major label debut, Nowell had been struggling with a heroin addiction. &quot;Sublime&quot; was recorded over a period of three months in Austin, Texas, in sessions characterized by heavy drug use and raucous partying. The album&#x27;s musical style contains elements of punk rock, reggae, and ska, as well as dancehall, hip hop, and dub music, with tempos ranging wildly. Nowell&#x27;s lyrical subject matter relates to relationships, prostitution, riots, and addiction. Nowell died due to a heroin overdose in May 1996, just two months prior to the band&#x27;s major album release, which led to the band&#x27;s dissolution.

Bolstered by numerous hit singles, among them &quot;What I Got&quot;, &quot;Santeria&quot;, and &quot;Wrong Way&quot;, the record proved to be enormously successful, despite the band being defunct and thus not able to promote the album through touring. It sold over five million copies in the United States by the end of the decade, and it continues to be a popular catalog album. The album was released during the third wave ska peak, and etched Sublime into a permanent place among the stars of the 1990s. Critical reviews were positive, praising Nowell&#x27;s songwriting ability and the album&#x27;s musical variety. &quot;Sublime&quot; has since been listed as one of the most well-regarded albums of the 1990s by &quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

==Background==
Sublime formed in Long Beach, California in 1988 by vocalist/guitarist Nowell, bassist Eric Wilson, and drummer Bud Gaugh. The group originated as a garage punk band, and they eventually began to infuse elements of reggae and ska over the course of their existence. The group formed playing backyard parties, attracting crowds of 300–400 people. The band toured heavily over the ensuing years, leading to a major following among the beach-oriented surfing/skateboarding subcultures. By 1990, the band had become a mainstay along the Southern California coast scene, and Nowell dropped out of California State University Long Beach one semester shy of graduating. The trio recorded their debut album, &quot;40 Oz. to Freedom&quot;, in 1992, selling the independent release at live performances. Local radio station KROQ began spinning the single &quot;Date Rape&quot; two years following its release, and Sublime rose to fame. By this point, the band had dropped &quot;Date Rape&quot; from their setlists, but the ensuing success of the single led &quot;40 Oz.&quot; to place on Soundscan&#x27;s alternative chart for 70 straight weeks.

MCA signed the group shortly thereafter, releasing their second album &quot;Robbin&#x27; the Hood&quot; in 1994. The record was nevertheless carried by various independent distributors, which placed it in independent record shops, surf/skate shops, and &quot;head shops&quot;, in a marketing effort designed to appeal to the band&#x27;s fan base. The band also adopted the Internet as a viable promotional tool, distributing their albums through early online music retailers. Despite this, Nowell had developed an addiction to heroin; at live performances, he would often be unable to make it through sets. On several occasions, he would steal the band&#x27;s equipment for a night&#x27;s performance to pawn for drug money, knowing band manager Michael &quot;Miguel&quot; Happoldt would find a way to re-acquire the equipment. He used clonidine patches in an attempt to quit, determined to do so both before signing to MCA and before the birth of his son the following year.

&quot;Robbin&#x27; the Hood&quot; performed well on college radio, and Sublime continued to grow in popularity, largely &quot;on the back of the California punk explosion engendered by Green Day and the Offspring.&quot; Nowell&#x27;s addiction worsened over the course of 1995–96; on May 25, 1996, Nowell died at age 28 in a San Francisco hotel room of a heroin overdose. According to one report, Gaugh had raided Nowell&#x27;s stash and shot up while he was away; he awoke hours later beside the deceased Nowell in bed. Gaugh later told a reporter that &quot;I thought, &#x27;That was probably supposed to be me.&#x27;&quot;

==Recording and production==
&quot;Sublime&quot; was largely recorded at Willie Nelson&#x27;s Pedernales Studio in Austin, Texas between February and May 1996. Although he had previously attempted to stay clean, Nowell returned to using heroin, &quot;more vigorously than ever.&quot; According to Leary, on some days, the band would arrive at 9am &quot;with margaritas in one hand and instruments in the other,&quot; ready to record; on others, &quot;they nearly burned the place down.&quot;

Nowell was so addled with the drug that he was sent home by Leary before the recording process was complete. &quot;There were times where someone had to go into the bathroom to see if Brad was still alive,&quot; he remarked. According to Nowell&#x27;s father, it took his son three days to recover, commenting, &quot;It was the worst I&#x27;d ever seen him.&quot;

The album was originally intended to open with a cover of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Trenchtown Rock&quot;, followed by &quot;Doin&#x27; Time&quot; – a loose cover of &quot;Summertime&quot; by George Gershwin. However, Sublime were initially unable to get the rights for &quot;Summertime&quot;, so Nowell discarded &quot;Doin&#x27; Time&quot; as well as &quot;Trenchtown Rock&quot; entirely and re-sequenced the album.

The band managed to gain the rights to the song before the album was released, and &quot;Doin&#x27; Time&quot; was added to the end of the tracklist at the 11th hour. In order to release the song using the Gershwin sample, the band had to agree to use the line &quot;summertime&quot; instead of &quot;doin&#x27; time&quot;. However, the song was already recorded with the &quot;doin&#x27; time&quot; lyric, and lead singer Bradley Nowell had recently died of a heroin overdose. The lyric was re-recorded by Sublime&#x27;s friend/producer Michael Happoldt singing &quot;summertime&quot;. It is this version of the song that appears on the album. The album&#x27;s original sequence, along with the original mix of &quot;Doin&#x27; Time&quot;, was restored for the album&#x27;s 10th Anniversary reissue.

==Music and composition==
&quot;Sublime&quot; features elements of punk rock, dub, hardcore punk, hip hop, reggae, blues, folk, ska and surf music.

The album has been classified by critics as ska punk and alternative rock.

===Covered songs===
* &quot;Pawn Shop&quot; is a cover of &quot;War Deh Round A John Shop&quot; by the Wailing Souls with modified lyrics.
*&quot;What I Got&quot; is based on Half Pint&#x27;s &quot;Loving&quot; and features a similar melody to the Beatles&#x27;s &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;. 
* Sublime also covers the Wailers&#x27; 1965 song &quot;Jailhouse&quot;, written by Bunny Wailer, combining it with a partial cover of Tenor Saw&#x27;s &quot;Roll Call&quot; in &quot;Jailhouse&quot;.
* &quot;The Ballad of Johnny Butt&quot; is largely a cover of a Secret Hate song from their &quot;Vegetables Dancing + Live &amp; More&quot; album.
* &quot;Doin&#x27; Time&quot; is a loose cover of the jazz standard &quot;Summertime&quot; by George Gershwin.
* &quot;Get Ready&quot; is largely based on Frankie Paul&#x27;s 1987 single of the same name.

===Samples===
Some of the album&#x27;s original compositions also have samples:

* While &quot;April 29, 1992&quot; is an original song, it features samples from &quot;La Di Da Di&quot; by Doug E. Fresh featuring MC Ricky D (a.k.a. Slick Rick), &quot;Original Gangster of Hip-Hop&quot; by Just-Ice, and &quot;Shook One (Part 1)&quot; by Mobb Deep.
* The heavy bass line of &quot;Garden Grove&quot; is based on Courtney Melody&#x27;s 1988 7&#x27; single &quot;A Ninja Mi Ninja&quot;, and a synth loop in the third verse is lifted from the Ohio Players&#x27; &quot;Funky Worm&quot;.
* Much of the rhythm and melody of &quot;Wrong Way&quot; was borrowed from the Specials &quot;It&#x27;s Up To You&quot; off their 1979 self-titled album.
* Part of the melody from &quot;Seed&quot; was taken from the Bel-Airs 1961 single &quot;Mr. Moto&quot; as well as &quot;Lori Meyers&quot; by NOFX.
* The guitar solo and chords in &quot;Santeria&quot; were a reuse of the ones in their song &quot;Lincoln Highway Dub&quot; featured on the previous album, &quot;Robbin&#x27; the Hood&quot;.
* &quot;Burritos&quot; is a reworked version of one of Sublime&#x27;s earliest recordings called &quot;Fighting Blindly&quot;, albeit with vastly different lyrics.
* The bass line of &quot;Caress Me Down&quot; features the famous Sleng Teng riddim from Wayne Smith&#x27;s 1985 song &quot;Under Me Sleng Teng&quot; and lyrics and melody are primarily from the 1980s 12-inch single &quot;Caress Me Down&quot; by Clement Irie.

==Cover art==
The cover art shows frontman Bradley Nowell posing with his back turned showing off his tattoo of the band&#x27;s logo. The tattoo was applied by Long Beach artist Opie Ortiz on September 29, 1995. Ortiz&#x27;s pop art had been featured on the band&#x27;s albums before, namely their iconic &quot;sun&quot; logo used on &quot;40oz to Freedom&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Sublime&quot; was released in the United States on July 30, 1996, with releases in Europe following that October and in Australia and Japan in December. MCA drafted the band&#x27;s former promotional team at Gasoline Alley (renaming the team Sublime Marketing) to promote &quot;Sublime&quot; through methods that played to the band&#x27;s fan base. This marketing included posters and advance copies at independent shops, and advertisements in board-sport and alternative magazines. Promoting the album proved to be challenging due to Nowell&#x27;s death, with no band to provide touring support or broadcast appearances.

The album soon began to expand upon the band&#x27;s surf/skate fan base, appealing to consumers not associated with that community. At least one retailer attributed this to Nowell&#x27;s death, remarking to &quot;Billboard&quot; that &quot;death sells,&quot; comparing a similar situation in which Roy Orbison&#x27;s discography rose in sales following his passing. Eric Weissbard, in a &quot;Spin&quot; column, compared Nowell&#x27;s posthumous success to that of Jonathan Larson, the composer of the Broadway musical &quot;Rent&quot;, who died the day before the musical&#x27;s scheduled premiere earlier in the year. &quot;Billboard&quot; deemed the band&#x27;s posthumous success &quot;a tale of tragic irony.&quot;

Abbey Konowitch, vice president of MCA Records, remarked to trades on the album&#x27;s timing:

Eric Wilson, the band&#x27;s bassist, was &quot;more pragmatic about the issue&quot;:
==Commercial performance==
By October 1996, the disc had moved 145,000 units; its success led to renewed interest in the band&#x27;s back catalog, which experienced marked growth. By April 1997, the album cracked the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and it eventually peaked at position 13. Sixteen months following the album&#x27;s release, it still sold 40,000 albums per week. It eventually spent 208 weeks on the chart. As of April 2024, it has sold nearly 7 million copies in the United States, according to Luminate Data.

==Reception==

David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; complimented the band&#x27;s &quot;bright, wired bounce and the shell-game shuffle of funk beats, snappy Jamaican rhythms and mosh-pit, shout-it-out choruses in Nowell&#x27;s writing,&quot; deeming it &quot;the stuff of a band with great promise and the confidence to make good on it. If only that were still possible.&quot; RJ Smith of &quot;Spin&quot; praised Nowell&#x27;s songwriting craft, writing, &quot;It might seem a daring experiment if it hadn&#x27;t so effortlessly sprung from a Long Beach surf scene that featured acoustic jams on the beach that naturally flowed from Wailers to Descendents classics [...] &quot;Sublime&quot; succeeds not just on vibe but on songcraft.&quot; Nisid Hajari of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the album a &quot;respectable testament&quot; to Nowell&#x27;s memory, ultimately noting that the record &quot;coheres more on an intellectual rather than emotional level, its sound too diffuse to be dramatic.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the record an A−, commenting, &quot;Junkies who retain enough soul to create music at all are generally driven to put their brilliance and stupidity in your face. Nowell is altogether more loving, unassuming, good-humored, and down-to-earth — or so he pretends, which when you&#x27;re good is all it takes.&quot;

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic reports that Nowell&#x27;s death allowed the album to be &quot;slightly overrated in some critical quarters&quot;. His critical review deems the album engaging and a demonstration of their potential, but also at times meandering: &quot;The low moments don&#x27;t arrive that often — by and large, the album is quite engaging — but they happen frequently enough to make the record a demonstration of the band&#x27;s blossoming ability, but not the fulfillment of their full potential.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Spin&quot; included the album on its list of the best albums of the decade, opining that it &quot;redeemed&quot; modern rock radio in the post-grunge era. It deems &quot;Sublime&quot; &quot;a tragic contradiction: a confident, clearheaded work by an artist coming into his own and at the same time losing control.&quot;

<text>Action for the Republic () is a conservative liberal political party in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

==History==
Founded in 1997 by Domingo Cavallo, Harvard University graduate liberal economist and defender of neoliberal ideologies, it became the third party in the 1999 elections. When Cavallo joined the De la Rúa´s government in 2001, many of the members of the party became part of the Ministry of the Economy.

Domingo Cavallo resolved to channel his political wishes of 1997 as a candidate for deputy for the Capital. It closed an agreement with Gustavo Béliz to form an opposition and anti-Menemist front that will aim to change the agenda of state priorities with a view to 1999: they will raise the flag of justice, security and the fight against corruption. Beliz dubbed it an &quot;anti-mafia front.&quot;

Elective positions were established, and Cavallo topped the list of candidates for deputies accompanied by Guillermo Francos, María Eugenia Estenssoro and Franco Caviglia. New Leadership, on the other hand, held the candidacies for Buenos Aires legislators with Beliz as the first candidate, seconded by the former Minister of Labor Enrique Rodríguez.

After the 2001 collapse of the economy, the party lost funding and most of its members joined other parties, such as Recreate for Growth or the Justicialist Party, or formed their own small local parties.

Nowadays it&#x27;s part of the Encounter for Corrientes provincial coalition. Corrientes is also the only district where the party has legal status.

<text>John W. Taylor (December 13, 1873 – March 4, 1938) was a right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals.

==Career==
He made his major league debut with the Cubs on September 25, 1898. His best years as a pitcher were 1900 (2.55 earned run average), 1902 (1.33 ERA with 7 shutouts; #1 in the league), 1903 (2.45 ERA), and 1906 (1.99 ERA). He recorded a career 2.65 ERA.

In 1904, Taylor set a major league record by pitching 39 consecutive complete games. Taylor actually threw 187 consecutive complete games between June 1901 and August 1906, but this streak was interrupted by 15 additional relief appearances. Thus Taylor appeared in 202 consecutive games without being relieved himself.

Taylor and fellow Cub Larry McLean were traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in return for Mordecai Brown and Jack O&#x27;Neill in December 1903; he was then traded back to Chicago in July 1906 (in return for Fred Beebe and Pete Noonan).

Thus he was part of the great 1906 Cubs; that year the ERA for the entire pitching staff was 1.76. He also contributed to the World Series-winning season in 1907.

Taylor was an above-average hitting pitcher in his major-league career, posting a .222 batting average (236-for-1063) with 110 runs, 2 home runs and 88 RBI. He also drew 66 bases on balls.

Taylor died in Columbus, Ohio at the age of 64.

In December 2022, Archer revealed that she had been involved in a cult a few years earlier. The cult was led by a man in Tanzania, who Archer believed at the time to be her spiritual father and the mouthpiece of God. After a trip with four other women to the home church in Tanzania for leadership training, Archer&#x27;s instincts told her that something was wrong. After a friend confessed to her that she had been molested by the cult leader, Archer decided to leave. She returned home, joined a new church, and received therapy for Post-traumatic stress disorder.

<text>Carol Martha Browner (born December 16, 1955) is an American lawyer, environmentalist and businesswoman who served as director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2011. Browner previously served as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001. She currently works as a Senior Counselor at Albright Stonebridge Group, a global business strategy firm.

Browner grew up in Florida and graduated from the University of Florida and the University of Florida College of Law. After working for the Florida House of Representatives, she was employed by Citizen Action in Washington, D.C. She became a legislative assistant for Senators Lawton Chiles and Al Gore. Browner then headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993, where she turned it into one of the most active departments in the state government.

She was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the EPA, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency. During her tenure, she reorganized the agency&#x27;s enforcement structure and oversaw two new programs designed to create flexible partnerships with industry as an alternative to traditional regulation. She started a successful program to deal with contaminated lands in urban areas. She took the lead within the administration in defending existing environmental laws and budgets and was the driving force behind a stringent tightening of air quality standards that led to a prolonged political and legal battle.

Afterward, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group and Albright Capital Management in 2001. She also served on a number of boards of directors and committees dealing with environmental issues. Her director role in the Obama administration was sometimes informally referred to as the &quot;Energy Czar&quot; or &quot;Climate Czar&quot;. Her efforts towards getting comprehensive climate and energy legislation passed in Congress came to no avail, but she assumed a prominent role in the federal government&#x27;s response to the BP &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil spill during 2010. She left her position in 2011 and the job itself was abolished shortly thereafter. Following that she rejoined the merged Albright Stonebridge Group, continued being active in several boards of environmental organizations, joined the boards of some energy- and agriculture-related companies, and became an advocate for nuclear energy in response to the dangers of global warming.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Miami, Florida, on December 16, 1955, Browner is the daughter of Isabella Harty-Hugues and Michael Browner, both of whom were professors at Miami Dade Community College, in social science and English respectively. She has two younger sisters. Browner grew up in South Miami, and her hikes in the nearby Everglades – only a bicycle ride away from her house – gave her a close connection to the natural world: &quot;I was very shaped by growing up in that kind of environment where nature was right there.&quot;

Browner received her B.A. degree from the University of Florida in 1977, majoring in English. She then graduated from the University of Florida College of Law with a J.D. degree in 1979.

== Early career ==
During 1980 and 1981, Browner worked as General Counsel for the Florida House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations. There she helped revise Florida&#x27;s Conservation and Recreational Lands Program. In 1983, she moved to Washington, D.C. and worked as associate director for the national Citizen Action group, a grassroots lobbying organization that was active in environmental issues.

Browner met Michael Podhorzer, a specialist in health-care issues at Citizen Action, in 1983. They married in 1987 and lived in Takoma Park, Maryland. They have a son, Zachary, born in 1987.

Between 1986 and 1988, Browner served as chief legislative assistant to Democratic U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles from Florida. In that role, she worked on a complex negotiation to expand Florida&#x27;s Big Cypress National Preserve as well as on a ban on offshore drilling nearby the Florida Keys. During 1989, she served as a legal counsel for the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. She was not averse to in-field investigation, and once dived in coastal waters to do research while pregnant.

From 1988 to 1991, Browner worked as legislative director for Senator Al Gore, and became known as a Gore protégé. She helped prepare amendments to the Clean Air Act and managed Gore&#x27;s legislative staff.

== Secretary of Environmental Regulation for Florida ==
As Secretary of Environmental Regulation, Browner headed the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation from 1991 to 1993, while living in Tallahassee. It was the nation&#x27;s third-largest such state agency, with 1,500 employees and a budget of some $650 million. There she believed that economic development and environmental protection did not have to be in conflict with each other. She revitalized the demoralized department and turned it into one of the most active in the Florida state government. She shortened the amount of time it took the department to review development permits for wetlands-affected areas and for manufacturing plants; in doing so, she annoyed some environmentalists who thought that the streamlined procedures diminished public review.

Browner pushed for the halting of construction of new hazardous waste plants and municipal waste incinerators, on the grounds that health and environmental consequences were insufficiently known. She brokered a deal with Walt Disney World that would allow it to build on wetlands it owned, in exchange for $40 million of work by Disney to restore endangered wetlands nearby. She pleased environmentalists by persuading Chiles, who had become governor, to negotiate a settlement to a federal lawsuit regarding damage to Everglades National Park and forcing the Florida sugar industry to bear much of the $1 billion cost. The head of Florida&#x27;s largest business trade association described dealing with Browner: &quot;She kicks the door open, throws in a hand grenade, and then walks in to shoot who&#x27;s left. She really doesn&#x27;t like to compromise. [But she] has done a pretty good job down here. People have more complaints with the way she does it than what she does.&quot;

== EPA Administrator ==
=== Nomination and confirmation ===
After the 1992 presidential election, Browner served as transition director for Vice President-elect Gore. President-elect Bill Clinton announced her as his choice for Environmental Protection Agency head on December 11, 1992. While both Clinton and Gore had criticized the George H. W. Bush administration&#x27;s commitment to environmental protection during the campaign, the selection of Browner – who was described by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as having &quot;the mind and training of an attorney-legislator but the soul of an activist&quot; – was seen as an indication that Gore&#x27;s ardent environmentalism had won out over Clinton&#x27;s more pro-business mindset. Clinton later wrote that he had not known her, but that Chiles had recommended her highly and Gore had requested she be named. The pick, along with several others of Gore protégés that Clinton made, helped solidify the vice president&#x27;s position within the administration. At her confirmation hearings before the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Browner came across as pragmatic and allayed fears that she would be excessively influenced by or tied to Gore. She was confirmed by the unanimous consent of the United States Senate on January 21, 1993.

She and Podhorzer returned to Takoma Park, Maryland, and he continued to work at Citizen Action. Her long-term goal was &quot;to leave the world a slightly better place&quot;, and she practiced various environmentally beneficial practices at home. She avoided the Nannygate problems of some of Clinton&#x27;s other early female nominees by having never used a nanny. She continued to lead an active outdoor life via bicycling, skiing, and jogging.

=== First four years ===

At the EPA, Browner supervised some 17,000 employees and a $7 billion budget. Early in her administration, she angered some EPA employees by publicly stating that the organization lacked management accountability and discipline and was wasting taxpayer money. Soon after taking office, Browner and her top aides, including assistant administrator for enforcement Steven Herman, reorganized several awkward and inefficient agency enforcement structures into a single Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. The EPA&#x27;s regional offices were permitted flexibility in reworking their own enforcement structures, however, which led to some bureaucratic conflicts.

Browner found criticism from both sides of environmental issues and battled many environmentalists, who objected to her support for repeal of the 1958 Delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods. Her announcement in May 1993 that the EPA would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and industrial furnace licensing drew support from environmentalists, however. A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet-level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support. Many of her legislative desires had to take a back seat to the higher-priority 1993 Clinton health care plan.

When the Republican Party took control of Congress after the 1994 U.S. elections, Browner took the lead for the Clinton administration in successfully fighting efforts by the Republicans, especially in the House of Representatives, to amend the Clean Water Act and to roll back other environmental regulations. She was able to work in a bipartisan manner, though, with Republicans in helping craft amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and passage of the Food Quality Protection Act. During the budget-cutting negotiations surrounding the federal government shutdown in 1995, Browner successfully protected the EPA&#x27;s review and enforcement powers and managed to gain over $750 million in increased spending for the agency. Her bureaucratic effectiveness illustrated what one of her top aides characterized as her talent: &quot;an extreme focus on a single issue where she is completely certain that she is right&quot;.

Two initiatives begun by the Clinton administration under Browner&#x27;s tenure were part of its &quot;reinventing government&quot; program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts as a way of expanding the EPA&#x27;s flexible public-private partnerships, as an alternative to traditional regulation. Project XL in 1995 was designed to find common sense, cost-effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities, while the Common Sense Initiative in 1994 was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors, rather than dealing with issues on a crisis-by-crisis, pollutant-by-pollutant basis. Project XL had mixed results, with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned. The more ambitious Common Sense Initiative, which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some European countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice, showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in 1998.

In March 1995, Browner and the EPA were charged by the House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs with violating the federal Anti-Lobbying Act (18 U.S. Code § 1913) by faxing unsolicited material opposing the Republican-sponsored regulatory reform package to various corporations and public-interest groups. Browner denied the accusation, saying the charge was an attempt to keep her from debating a possible rollback of health and environmental protections.

As EPA Administrator, Browner started the agency&#x27;s successful Brownfields Program in 1995. The program helped facilitate cleanups of brownfield lands and their contaminated facilities, especially in urban areas, by empowering states, communities, and assorted stakeholders in economic development. It leveraged more than $1 billion in public and private funds for cleanups and created thousands of new jobs, while enabling hundreds of communities to bring idle properties back into productive use.

=== Second four years ===
Perhaps Browner&#x27;s biggest triumph came in 1997, when she convinced Clinton to support a stringent tightening of the Clean Air Act&#x27;s National Ambient Air Quality Standards regarding permissible levels of the ground-level ozone that makes up smog and the fine airborne particulate matter that makes up soot. The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards that became the most divisive environmental debate of the decade. There was a long and fierce internal discussion within the administration, with opposition from the president&#x27;s economic advisers echoing strong objections from some industry groups who said the costs of the new standards would far outweigh any benefits and that Browner had exaggerated the degree of certainty behind the EPA&#x27;s scientific reviews on the matter. Over eighty environmental and health groups, who had grown quite frustrated with the administration&#x27;s preference for minimal-cost incremental actions in the area, pressured Vice President Gore to take a stand on the matter, but he remained silent. Browner&#x27;s adamant defense in favor of the new standards was conducted almost single-handedly, in private meetings, Congressional testimony, and public debate, and had come in the face of a silence from the White House that had put at risk her standing within the administration. Some within the administration objected to her unwillingness to modify her stance and even suggested she be fired for insubordination. Ultimately, Gore lent behind-the-scenes support in favor of the new regulations, which was a key factor in Clinton&#x27;s final decision in Browner&#x27;s favor. Overall, &quot;The New York Times&quot; termed Browner&#x27;s actions &quot;a remarkable piece of bureaucratic bravura&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazine labelled Browner the &quot;Queen of Clean Air&quot;. As the decision was announced, one which would affect hundreds of American cities and towns, Browner said: &quot;These new standards will provide new health protections to 125 million Americans, including 35 million children.&quot;

The change to the standards had to survive Congressional review, but the support of Republicans from the northeast, especially New York Senator Al D&#x27;Amato, helped compensate for Democrats opposed to them. The new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s nondelegation principle and eventually landed in the U.S. Supreme Court, whose 2001 unanimous ruling in the case now titled &quot;Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc.&quot; largely upheld Browner&#x27;s and the EPA&#x27;s actions. Browner and the EPA also took action against air pollution caused by motor vehicles, issuing standards in 1999 that for the first time included light trucks and sport utility vehicles to meet the same emission standards as cars, and that would require the sulfur content of gasoline to be reduced by 90 percent over five years.

During her tenure, Browner also began efforts to deal with global warming, giving the EPA authority to regulate carbon emissions causing climate change, although the EPA under the following George W. Bush administration chose not to use that authority. Several other policies of hers were reversed in the Bush administration as well.

During Browner&#x27;s tenure, there were many reports from African American employees of racism directed at them from a network of &quot;good old boys&quot; who dominated the agency&#x27;s middle management. The most known of these reports involved policy specialist Marsha Coleman-Adebayo, who in 1997 filed suit against the agency; in 2000, the court found the EPA guilty of discrimination against Coleman-Adebayo, and awarded her $300,000. Coleman-Adebayo said that Browner allowed the problems to persist rather than trying to clean them up. In an October 2000 Congressional hearing on the matter, Browner emphasized that minorities had tripled in number in the agency&#x27;s senior rank during her time as administrator, but was unable to explain why the culprits in Coleman-Adebayo&#x27;s case had not been dismissed and in some cases had been promoted. Congressional dissatisfaction with the situation and the EPA&#x27;s treatment of Coleman-Adebayo led to passage of the No-FEAR Act in 2002, which prohibits federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation.

In the final days of the Clinton administration, D.C. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered the EPA to preserve under the Freedom of Information Act all documents possibly relevant to last-minute EPA regulation issuances. In 2003, Lamberth found the EPA in contempt for not having preserved Browner&#x27;s files, but did not find Browner or other officials in contempt. Browner had said that she had not been aware of the court order and that the computer material she had removed was not work-related.

During her EPA tenure, Browner became unpopular with a number of industry groups, especially utilities and heavy manufacturing, as well as with conservatives in Congress, who thought businesses were stifled by her policies. She also battled the Treasury Department at times, and sometimes opposed Clinton himself, who tended to give priority to economic growth over environmental considerations. Nonetheless, Browner was the longest-serving administrator in the history of the agency, staying through both terms of the Clinton presidency – and in the type of position that often sees turnover every three or four years. Robert W. Collin, author of a 2005 text on the agency, assessed her as &quot;one of the ablest administrators ever to lead the EPA&quot;, and wrote that she was &quot;completely fearless in her engagement with controversial environmental issues&quot;. Clinton himself later stated that Browner had accumulated a long list of important achievements.

== Business career ==
After the Clinton administration, Browner became a founding member of the Albright Group, a &quot;global strategy group&quot; headed by former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. As a principal, Browner assisted businesses and other organizations with the challenges of operating internationally, including complying with environmental regulations and climate change. Coca-Cola and Merck &amp; Co. have been among the clients for such international assistance. She also became a founding member and principal of Albright Capital Management, an investment advisory company. During 2002, she taught classes at the study abroad program of her alma mater, now named the Fredric G. Levin College of Law.

Browner is now married to former Congressman Thomas Downey. The marriage, his second, her third, took place on June 21, 2007, in Riverhead, New York. Downey heads a lobbying firm representing clients in the energy industry. In 2006, she and Downey collaborated on behalf of Dubai Ports World, but were unable to persuade Senator Charles Schumer to their viewpoint during the Dubai Ports World controversy.

Browner joined the board of the National Audubon Society in 2001 and became chair in 2003; her term expired in 2008. She also joined the board of the Alliance for Climate Protection, an organization founded by Gore in 2006. In 2008, she joined the board of APX, Inc., which specializes in technology infrastructure for the environmental commodities markets including those for carbon offsets and the CDM Gold Standard. She was also on the founding board of the Center for American Progress as well as the boards of the Alliance for Climate Protection and the League of Conservation Voters. She left all of these boards in late 2008 when she was named to serve in the Obama administration. Until summer 2008 she was a member of Socialist International&#x27;s Commission for a Sustainable World Society, although the commission&#x27;s web site still had her listed as a member in January 2009.

Her income in 2008 was between $1 million and $5 million from lobbying firm Downey McGrath Group, where her husband was a principal. She also reported $450,000 in &quot;member distribution&quot; income, plus retirement and other benefits from the Albright Group.

Browner retained a political voice during her business career, describing the George W. Bush administration as &quot;the worst environmental administration ever&quot;. She also stated that global warming is &quot;the greatest challenge ever faced&quot;. In the 2008 presidential election, she was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s bid for the Democratic nomination. After Clinton lost her bid, Browner campaigned for Barack Obama in several battleground states and in League of Conservation Voters events.

==Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy==

On November 5, 2008, Browner was named to the advisory board of the Obama-Biden Transition Project.

On December 15, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama named Browner as Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change. Officially known as the Director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy, she acted as a coordinator for environmental, energy, climate, transport and related matters for the federal government. Her position was sometimes informally described as the &quot;Energy Czar&quot; or the &quot;Climate Czar&quot;. (The form &quot;Czarina&quot; was sometimes also used.) It did not require Senate confirmation. Her participation on the Commission for a Sustainable World Society drew criticism from some Republican members of Congress, but the Obama transition team said there was nothing wrong with it. In any case, her power and influence relied primarily on persuasion: &quot;I don&#x27;t have any independent policymaking authority. It&#x27;s not like when I was at EPA and I could depend on regulation.&quot;
Browner&#x27;s deputy assistant was Heather Zichal, a former legislative director for Senator John Kerry.

The early months of the Obama administration found her working well with the Cabinet members. She was a key negotiator between the administration and automakers in formulating the new United States emission standards in May 2009, and also was a member of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry that bailed out American automakers. She successfully urged incorporation of tens of billions of dollars for renewable energy programs into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. She was a central player in negotiation with Congress of the United States Carbon Cap and Trade Program, seemingly more so than U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu, and continued to stress its importance despite the Obama health care plan being the top legislative priority overall. Environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the White House. By September 2009, Republican members of Congress expressed concern that her access to the president had usurped power from other agencies. She also became a brief target of fervent anti-&quot;czar&quot; radio and television commentator Glenn Beck, following the Van Jones resignation.

In October 2009, Browner conceded that congressional passage of the cap-and-trade legislation before the end of the year was unlikely, and feared its absence would harm prospects for meaningful international agreement at the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference in December. By the next month, she moderated her concern but expressed opposition to any congressional &quot;slicing and dicing&quot; that would separate energy and climate concerns. Attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in July 2010 due to lack of enough votes in the Senate; Browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said, &quot;Obviously, everyone is disappointed that we do not yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation.&quot; At other times she became philosophical, later saying that she would quote the key lines from one of The Rolling Stones&#x27; most well-known songs to Obama: &quot;You can&#x27;t always get what you want, but you get what you need.&quot;

In 2010, Browner became a key part of the administration team handling, and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about, the BP &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. In late May 2010 she assessed the spill as &quot;probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country&quot; and said that the administration was &quot;prepared for the worst&quot;. She added that &quot;I think what the American people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August, when the relief wells will be finished.&quot; Mike Allen of &quot;Politico&quot; later wrote, &quot;[Browner&#x27;s] calm, authoritative television presence during the BP oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the Gulf catastrophe.&quot;

With Republicans taking over the House of Representatives following the 2010 midterm elections, chances of climate and energy legislation passing that embodied Browner&#x27;s and the administration&#x27;s goals were essentially nil, and Obama conceded as much. As the Obama administration neared its two-year mark and a number of personnel changes were underway, there was a possibility that Browner might be named to another position with broader responsibilities, such as White House Deputy Chief of Staff. But that did not come to pass.

Instead, in late January 2011, White House officials disclosed that Browner would be leaving her position in the fairly near future. Browner said of her unexpected decision, &quot;[there&#x27;s] no back story – it was just time to go&quot; and that she felt &quot;honored to have a second ... chance to serve&quot;. League of Conservation Voters president Gene Karpinski characterized Browner as a &quot;tenacious advocate on our issues&quot; who would be &quot;sorely missed&quot;, while a member of the law and energy industry lobbying firm Bracewell &amp; Giuliani said Browner&#x27;s exit was a good development and that &quot;Her departure may be part of a legitimate effort to pay careful attention to addressing some of the real regulatory obstacles in the way of job creation in the United States.&quot; Browner left the White House in March 2011. Her general responsibilities were taken over by her second-in-command, Heather Zichal, from a position within the U.S. Domestic Policy Council.

In late February 2011, while Browner was still in place, the House voted to eliminate the Director of the Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy position altogether. While the move was part of an overall effort to get rid of Obama&#x27;s &quot;czars&quot;, Browner was a particular focus of it. Representative Steve Scalise, who led the effort, said of Browner, &quot;Let her leave, and take the funding, too.&quot; In the mid-April 2011 federal spending agreement that averted a possible government shutdown, funding for the position was indeed eliminated (as were three other &quot;czar&quot; roles, most of which were similarly vacant). Obama issued a signing statement protesting the move and saying he would not abide by it, but the point was largely moot as the positions in question, including the Browner one, had already been moved inside the Domestic Policy Council.

== Return to business and advocacy ==
Browner rejoined the Center for American Progress in April 2011 as a Distinguished Senior Fellow and a member of the organization&#x27;s executive committee. She also rejoined the Albright firm, now known due to merger as the Albright Stonebridge Group, as a Senior Counselor whose responsibilities included providing strategic services to clients in assorted areas of environmental impact. She continued to speak publicly on environmental issues and indicated she was &quot;disappointed&quot; by the Obama administration&#x27;s September 2011 decision to drop toughening of low-altitude ozone levels in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

In July 2013, Browner was named to the board of directors of Bunge Limited, a global agribusiness and food company. In November 2013, she was named to the advisory board of Opower, a software provider to the utility industry. In January 2014, she joined the Global Ocean Commission, an initiative to restore oceanic health and productivity, which issued its final report in 2016. In March 2014, she was elected as chair of the board of directors of the League of Conservation Voters.

In April 2014 she joined the Leadership Council of Nuclear Matters, an industry-backed group that advocates for nuclear power as a means to combat climate change. In that role, she said, &quot;We can&#x27;t take a carbon-free source of energy off the table.&quot; She has acknowledged that looking at herself twenty years earlier, she would &quot;probably not be pro-nuclear&quot;, but said, &quot;I think climate change is the biggest problem the world has ever faced&quot; and it would simply be &quot;irresponsible&quot; not to consider nuclear energy as part of the solution.

After a different administration had been in power for a year, Browner was one of several former EPA heads who expressed alarm at the effects that new head Scott Pruitt had had upon the agency. She said that while the George W. Bush administration had treated the EPA with a &quot;sort of benign neglect&quot;, in contrast, &quot;Under Pruitt, what they&#x27;re doing is conscientiously tearing the place down.&quot; She was especially concerned that reversing budget cuts would be difficult and that a successful full repeal of the second-term Obama administration&#x27;s Clean Power Plan could set back an effort to resume combating human-caused global warming some &quot;20 to 30 years&quot;. She did not think that the replacing of Pruitt with Andrew R. Wheeler made anything better; overall, she said the actions of this administration were &quot;worse than disappointing. I mean, it is stunning and very alarming.&quot;

By 2019, Browner had joined the electric scooter company Lime as a sustainability adviser. She said of her role there, &quot;So we are looking at, how do we make sure that a carbon reduction plan includes micro-mobility? How do we understand what it means to get people out of a car for the last couple of miles?&quot; In reference to the Green New Deal proposal of early 2019, Browner said, &quot;The science is clear: Time is not our friend here. So I have to say I&#x27;m as excited about this as I have been about anything in the environmental space in a long time.&quot;

Browner joined the law firm of Covington &amp; Burling in September 2021, in the position of Senior Of Counsel in the firm&#x27;s Environmental, Social, and Governance Practice, as part of a trend of ESG-related concerns becoming important to corporate clients.

== Awards and honors ==
In April 1997, Browner received the Outstanding Mother of the Year Award from the National Mother&#x27;s Day Committee &quot;for her dedication to providing &#x27;children with a safer, healthier world.&#x27;&quot;. In September 1997 Browner was honored as one of the 47 Distinguished Alumnae of University of Florida. Browner also has received &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine&#x27;s Woman of the Year Award, the Ambulatory Pediatric Association&#x27;s Advocate for Children Award, the South Florida Chapter of the Audubon Society&#x27;s Guy M. Bradley Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Lifetime Environmental Achievement Award from the New York State Bar Association. In 1998 she received Vice President Gore&#x27;s Hammer Award for helping to make government cost less and work better. In 2000, she received the American Lung Association&#x27;s President&#x27;s Award for leadership towards &quot;the toughest action in a generation to safeguard public health from the threats posed by air pollution.&quot;

<text>Zdeněk Fibich (, 21 December 1850 in Všebořice – 15 October 1900 in Prague) was a Czech composer of classical music. Among his compositions are chamber works (including two string quartets, a piano trio, piano quartet and a quintet for piano, strings and winds), symphonic poems, three symphonies, at least seven operas (the most famous probably &quot;Šárka&quot; and &quot;The Bride of Messina&quot;), melodramas including the substantial trilogy &quot;Hippodamia&quot;, liturgical music including a mass – a &quot;missa brevis&quot;; and a large cycle (a total of 376 pieces, from the 1890s) of piano works called &quot;Moods, Impressions, and Reminiscences&quot;. The piano cycle served as a diary of sorts of his love for a piano pupil, and one of the pieces formed the basis for the short instrumental work &quot;Poème&quot;, for which Fibich is best remembered today.

==Early life and education==
That Fibich is far less known than either Antonín Dvořák or Bedřich Smetana can be explained by the fact that he lived during the rise of Czech nationalism within the Habsburg Empire. While Smetana and Dvořák gave themselves over entirely to the national cause, consciously writing Czech music with which the emerging nation strongly identified, Fibich&#x27;s position was more ambivalent. This was due to the background of his parents and to his education. Fibich&#x27;s father was a Czech forestry official and the composer&#x27;s early life was spent on various wooded estates of the nobleman for whom his father worked. His mother, however, was an ethnic German Viennese. She started teaching him how to play the piano when he was six years old. Home schooled by his mother until the age of nine, he was first sent to a German-speaking gymnasium in Vienna for two years before attending a Czech-speaking gymnasium in Prague where he stayed until he was 15. After this he was sent to Leipzig where he remained for three years studying piano with Ignaz Moscheles and composition with Salomon Jadassohn and Ernst Richter. After the better part of a year in Paris, Fibich concluded his studies with Vinzenz Lachner (the younger brother of Franz and Ignaz Lachner) in Mannheim. Fibich spent the next few years living with his parents back in Prague where he composed his first opera &quot;Bukovina&quot;, based on a libretto of Karel Sabina, the librettist of Smetana&#x27;s &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot;.

==Personal life==
At the age of 23, he married Růžena Hanušová and took up residence in the Lithuanian city of Vilnius. where he had obtained a position of choirmaster. After spending two unhappy years there (his wife and newly born twins both died in Vilnius), he returned to Prague in 1874 and remained there until his death in 1900. In 1875 Fibich married Růžena&#x27;s sister, the operatic contralto Betty Fibichová (née Hanušová), but left her in 1895 for his former student and lover Anežka Schulzová. The relationship between Schulzová and Fibich was important to him artistically, since she wrote the libretti for all his later operas including &quot;Šárka&quot;, but also served as the inspiration for his &quot;Moods, Impressions, and Reminiscences&quot;.

==Career==
Fibich was given a bi-cultural education, living during his formative early years in Germany, France and Austria in addition to his native Bohemia. He was fluent in German as well as Czech. In his instrumental works, Fibich generally wrote in the vein of the German romantics, first falling under the influence of Weber, Mendelssohn and Schumann and later Wagner. His early operas and close to 200 of his early songs are in German. These works along with his symphonies and chamber music won considerable praise from German critics, though not from Czechs. The bulk of Fibich&#x27;s operas are in Czech, although many are based on non-Czech sources such as Shakespeare, Schiller and Byron. In his chamber music, more than anywhere else, Fibich makes use of Bohemian folk melodies and dance rhythms such as the dumka. Fibich was the first to write a Czech nationalist tone poem (&quot;Záboj, Slavoj a Luděk&quot;) which served as the inspiration for Smetana&#x27;s &quot;Má vlast&quot;. He was also the first to use the polka in a chamber work, his quartet in A.

===Criticisms from Prague&#x27;s musical community===
After his return to Prague in 1874, Fibich&#x27;s music encountered severely negative reactions in the Prague musical community, stemming from his (and Smetana&#x27;s) adherence to Richard Wagner&#x27;s theories on opera. While Smetana&#x27;s later career was plagued with problems for presenting Wagnerian-style music dramas in Czech before a conservative audience, Fibich&#x27;s pugilistic music criticism, not to mention his overtly Wagnerian later operas, &quot;Hedy&quot;, &quot;Šárka&quot;, and &quot;Pád Arkuna&quot;, exacerbated the problem in the years after Smetana&#x27;s death in 1884. Together with the music aesthetician Otakar Hostinský, he was ostracized from the musical establishment at the National Theatre and Prague Conservatory and forced to rely on his private composition studio. The studio nevertheless was well respected among students, drawing such names as Emanuel Chvála, Karel Kovařovic, Otakar Ostrčil, and Zdeněk Nejedlý, the notorious critic and subsequent politician. Much of the reception of Fibich&#x27;s music in the early twentieth century is a result of these students&#x27; efforts after their teacher&#x27;s death, especially in Nejedlý&#x27;s highly polemical campaigns enacted in a series of monographs and articles that sought to redress what he considered to be past inequities. Although this served to bring Fibich&#x27;s music to greater attention, subsequent scholarship has had to deal with the spectre of Nejedlý&#x27;s intensely personal bias.

There is a &quot;Fibich Society&quot; which has organized projects such as Vladimir Hudec&#x27;s Thematic Catalog (below) and much else.

==Works==

Fibich&#x27;s best-known work, &quot;Poème&quot;, began life as an unnamed piano piece (no. 139 in D flat) in his cycle &quot;Moods, Impressions and Reminiscences&quot;. He reused the material in his symphonic idyll &quot;At Twilight&quot; from where it was adapted after his death by the violinist Jan Kubelik and given the title &quot;Poème&quot;. This has been published and recorded in numerous arrangements, one of which was &quot;My Moonlight Madonna&quot; to English lyrics by Paul Francis Webster. In 1933 the tune was popularly harmonized by William Scotti.

<text>Fusang is a mythical world tree or place located far east of China.

In the &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot; and several contemporary texts, the term refers to a mythological tree of life, alternatively identified as a mulberry or a hibiscus, allegedly growing far to the east of China, and perhaps to various more concrete territories which are located to the east of the mainland.

A country which was named Fusang was described by the native Buddhist missionary Huishen (, &quot;Huìshēn&quot;), also variously romanized as Hui Shen, Hoei-sin, and Hwai Shan. In his record dated to AD 499 during China&#x27;s Northern and Southern dynastic period, he describes Fusang as a place which is located 20,000 Chinese &quot;li&quot; to the east of Dahan, and it is also located to the east of China (according to Joseph Needham, Dahan corresponds to the Buriat region of Siberia). Huishen arrived in China from Kabul in 450 AD and went by ship to Fusang in 458 AD, and upon his return in 499 reported his findings to the Liang emperor. His descriptions are recorded in the 7th-century text &quot;Book of Liang&quot; by Yao Silian, and they describe a civilization which inhabits the Fusang country. The Fusang which is described by Huishen has variously been posited to be the Americas, Sakhalin Island, the Kamchatka Peninsula or the Kuril Islands. The American hypothesis was the most hotly debated one during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, after the 18th-century writings of Joseph de Guignes were republished and disseminated by Charles Godfrey Leland in 1875. Sinologists, including Emil Bretschneider, Berthold Laufer, and Henri Cordier, refuted this hypothesis, however, and according to Needham, the American hypothesis was all but refuted by the time of the First World War.

In later Chinese accounts, other, even less well-identified places were given the name Fusang.

== Mythological accounts ==
An earlier account claims that in 219 BC, emperor Shi Huang sent an expedition of some 3,000 convicts to a place which was located far off to the east, across the ocean, a place which was called Fusang, where they were required to make a sacrifice to a volcano god who held the elixir of life. Apparently, two expeditions were undertaken by Xu Fu, the court sorcerer, in order to seek the elixir of life. The first expedition returned c. 210 BC because Xu Fu claimed that a giant sea creature was blocking his men&#x27;s path. Archers were then sent to kill this monster when the expedition set out a second time, but it was never heard from again. However, &quot;... asides in the &quot;Record of the Historian&quot; imply that its leader Xu Fu had returned to China long ago and was lurking somewhere near Langya, frittering away the expedition&#x27;s impressive budget.&quot;

In Chinese mythology, Fusang refers to a divine tree and an island which are both located in the East, from where the sun rises. A similar tree, known as the Ruomu () exists in the west, and each morning, the sun was said to rise in Fusang and fall on Ruomu. According to Chinese legends, ten birds (typically ravens) lived in the tree, and because nine of the birds rested, the tenth bird would carry the Sun on its journey. This legend has similarities with the Chinese tale of the fictional hero Houyi, sometimes referred to as the Archer, who is credited with saving the world by shooting down nine of the suns when all ten suns simultaneously took to the air one day. Some scholars have identified the bronze trees which were found at the archaeological site Sanxingdui as these Fusang trees.

==Interpretations of Huishen&#x27;s account==
===Eastern Japan===
Japan was one of the interpretation place for &quot;Fusang&quot;. However, Huishen&#x27;s report differentiates Fusang from the ancient Japanese kingdom of Wa, which has been tentatively located in the Kinki, Kyūshū, or it has been located on the Ryukyu Islands.

The term Fusang would later be used as a designation for &#x27;Japan&#x27; in Chinese poetry. Since Japanese name &quot;Nihon&quot; (, lit. &#x27;Root [&quot;i.e.&quot; source, birthplace, origin] of the Sun&#x27;) or the Chinese name &quot;Riben&quot; was a name of Japan, some Tang dynasty poets believed that Fusang &quot;lay between the mainland and Japan.&quot; For instance, Wang Wei wrote a 753 farewell poem when Abe no Nakamaro (Chinese Zhao Heng ) returned to Japan, &quot;The trees of your home are beyond Fu-sang.&quot;

Fusang is pronounced in Japanese, from classical &quot;Fusau&quot;, and it is one of the names which is used as a designation for ancient Japan. Several warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy were named &quot;Fusō&quot; (the Japanese ironclad warship &quot;Fusō&quot;, or the World War II battleship &quot;Fusō&quot;). Several companies, such as Fuso, also bear the name.

Gustaaf Schlegel believed that Fusang was most probably &quot;the long island of Karafuto or it was Sakhalin&quot;. Joseph Needham added that &quot;if Kamchatka and the Kuriles may also be considered, there is no better means of identifying it at the present day.&quot;

Note that there was an ancient province of Japan which was named the &quot;Fusa-no kuni&quot; (the &#x27;Country of Fusa&#x27;) in eastern Honshū, which encompassed all of the modern-day Chiba Prefecture as well as the southwestern part of the modern-day Ibaraki Prefecture.

===The Americas===

According to some historians such as Charles Godfrey Leland and Joseph de Guignes (&quot;Le Fou-Sang des Chinois est-il l&#x27;Amérique?&quot; Mémoires de l&#x27;Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, tome 28, Paris, 1761), the distances which are given by Huishen (20,000 Chinese &quot;li&quot;) would mean that Fusang is located on the west coast of the American continent, when the ancient Han-period definition of the Chinese &quot;li&quot; is taken into account. Some 18th-century European maps locate Fusang north of California, in the area of British Columbia. An American location does not match with the claim that horses were sighted (because horses did not exist in either North or South America at that time) nor does it match with the claim that deer were domesticated and milked.

Fusang was mentioned in a map of Marco Polo&#x27;s voyages to the Far East which was supposedly made (or copied) by his family, the map includes the Kamchatka Peninsula and Alaska. The map has been dated to the 15th or 16th century, which means that at best, it is a copy of the original map. However, the ink wasn&#x27;t dated, so it&#x27;s also possible that Alaska could&#x27;ve been added later on when the existence of it became known.

==Descriptions of Fusang==
According to the report of Huishen to the Chinese during his visit to China, which is described in the &quot;Book of Liang&quot;:


On the organization of the country:
On the social practices:
The &quot;Book of Liang&quot; also describes the conversion of Fusang to the Buddhist faith by five Buddhist monks who were from Gandhara:

It is also reported that 1,000 li (415 km, 258 miles) beyond of Fusang, there was a Land of Women, where &quot;its female inhabitants were completely covered with hair, walked erect, and chattered a lot among themselves but were shy when they saw ordinary human beings. They gave birth to their young after six or seven months of pregnancy and nursed them on their backs. The babies were able to walk within 100 days and were fully grown in three or four years.&quot;

<text>The Battle of Dysert O&#x27;Dea took place on 10 May 1318 at Dysert O&#x27;Dea near Corofin, Ireland. It was part of the Bruce campaign in Ireland. The Norman Richard de Clare attacked the Gaelic Irish chieftain Conchobhar ÓDeághaidh, chief of the Cineal Fearmaic and ally of Muircheartach ÓBriain, but he was defeated.


==Precursors to war==
The Bruce invasion of Ireland enabled the outbreak of a number of small wars that had little, if anything, pertaining to the Scots. Perhaps the most notable was the battle at Dysert O&#x27;Dea which erupted in Brian Boru&#x27;s old Kingdom of Thomond in 1318.

Two factions of the O&#x27;Brien clan had been fighting for generations for supremacy in Thomond. Murtough O&#x27;Brien, the descendant of Toirdelbach UaBriain was the rightful King of Thomond. A challenger appeared in the form of Mahon O&#x27;Brien, allied with the opposing faction of the family, which paid its homage to Brian O&#x27;Brien. This side of the family was allied with the powerful Anglo-Norman Richard deClare, a relative of Strongbow. DeClare ruled over much of western Ireland from his castle at Bunratty, yet the English respected Thomond as a sovereign state and remained outside its borders. However, deClare&#x27;s alliance with Mahon O&#x27;Brien provided an excuse to invade Thomond. His Pale Englishmen would meet in a pitched battle against Murtough&#x27;s Irish in the Battle of Dysert O&#x27;Dea.

During this time, Donnchadh, an ally of deClare, was overwhelmingly defeated in the Battle of Lough Raska near Corcomruadh Abbey.

==Order of battle==
When news arrived of his allies&#x27; defeat at Corcomruadh, Richard deClare decided to attack the Gaelic stronghold at Dysert O&#x27;Dea. His troops arrived at Ruan on the morning of 10 May 1318, and were divided into three columns. The first division was headed by de Clare&#x27;s son and marched northwards to Tullach O&#x27;Dea in an effort to cut off any help which might arrive from O&#x27;Connor of Ennistymon. The second column travelled southwards towards Magowna to quell any support from that direction. The third division was commanded by deClare himself and marched westwards towards Dysert O&#x27;Dea, the home of Conor O&#x27;Dea. O&#x27;Dea intentionally made his forces look few in number, for some time fighting in retreat, and when deClare charged for an attack the Anglo-Normans were ambushed. Richard deClare was felled by an axe and his son was killed by a Feilim O&#x27;Connor. The O&#x27;Deas were reinforced by the O&#x27;Connors and later the O&#x27;Briens, who turned the tide of a potentially unpredictable battle along with further decisive assistance from the O&#x27;Hehir and MacNamaras; and the English were soon defeated. Following their victory, the Irish marched back to the deClare settlement, only to find that deClare&#x27;s wife had set it aflame, including Bunratty Castle, and had returned to England.

Over eighty Englishmen of noble birth and many foot soldiers were killed in the battle. The Kingdom of Thomond remained beyond foreign control for over two hundred and fifty years, until 1570.

<text>Audouin Charles Dollfus (12 November 1924 – 1 October 2010) was a French astronomer and aeronaut, specialist in studies of the Solar System and discoverer of Janus, a moon of Saturn.

==Life and career==
Dollfus was born in Paris to aeronaut Charles Dollfus.

Dollfus studied at the University of Paris, obtaining a doctorate in physical sciences in 1955. Beginning in 1946, Dollfus worked as an astronomer at the Meudon Observatory, following his advisor and mentor Bernard Lyot. In particular, he directed the Laboratory of Solar System Physics there. Until his death, he was an honorary astronomer at the Paris Observatory. Most of his work was carried out based on observations from the Pic du Midi Observatory, and his preferred research method is the use of polarized light as a diagnostic of the properties of Solar System objects. Through patient and persistent research and the development of new observational techniques, he was able to obtain many remarkable results. Dollfus published more than 300 scientific publications, relating primarily to astrophysics of the Solar System.

Before the &quot;Viking&quot; spacecraft landed on Mars, the composition of the Martian surface was the subject of many debates. Dollfus tried to determine the composition of the Martian desert, through comparison with the appearance in polarized light of several hundred terrestrial minerals. He found that only pulverized limonite (FeO(OH)) corresponded with the appearance of Mars, and concluded that the Martian surface could be composed of iron oxide. Astronomer Gerard P. Kuiper of the University of Chicago disagreed with this conclusion, believing that fine-grained igneous rocks were a better fit to the data, but subsequent observations proved Dollfus correct.

By using the polarization of light, it is possible to detect an atmosphere around a planet or natural satellite. In 1950, most scientists thought that Mercury, because of its small size, had probably lost its atmosphere due to molecular escape into space. Dollfus announced that he had detected a very small atmosphere, again using polarization measurements made at the Pic du Midi Observatory in the French Pyrenees. His discovery contradicted the previous theoretical predictions based on the kinetic theory of gases. Dollfus estimated that the atmospheric pressure at the surface of Mercury was approximately 1 mm of mercury. The nature of gas composing this atmosphere was unknown but thought to be a dense, heavy gas. It was however certain that the atmosphere of Mercury must be less than 1/300th that of the Earth. Currently, it is known that the atmosphere of Mercury is very thin indeed: only 10−15 bar, with the total mass of the atmosphere not exceeding 1000 kg.

Mercury has dark zones which contrast with a brighter bottom; this was observed first by Giovanni Schiaparelli in 1889. By using the refracting telescope of the Pic du Midi Observatory, Dollfus was able in 1959 to clearly resolve surface features as small as 300 km.

Dollfus also studied the possible presence of an atmosphere around the Moon. The rate of dissipation into space of any gases on the Moon (except for certain rare heavy elements) is so high that no substantial atmosphere is possible. The presence of any atmosphere should be detectable by the polarization of light; Bernard Lyot and later Dollfus showed that there was no detectable polarization, thereby confirming the theoretical prediction that the Moon lacks an atmosphere.

Direct visual observation became rare in astronomy. By 1965 Robert S. Richardson called Dollfus one of two great living experienced visual observers as talented as Percival Lowell or Giovanni Schiaparelli. In 1966, Dollfus discovered Janus, a small inner moon of Saturn. He made this discovery by observing at a time when the rings, very close to Janus, were nearly edge-on to the Earth and thus practically invisible. At this time he probably also observed Epimetheus, a smaller moon which shares the same orbit as Janus, but he did not realize these were two separate objects and it is Richard Walker that holds credit for this discovery.

In 1981, Dollfus became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

==Aerospace and Ballooning Pioneer==
With his father, the aeronautical pioneer Charles Dollfus, he holds
several world records in ballooning, including the first stratospheric flight
in France. He was the first to carry out astronomical observations from a
stratospheric balloon, in particular to study Mars in a detailed way.

==Honours and awards==
The asteroid 2451 Dollfus is named in his honour. One of the largest craters on Mars was also named for him in 2013.

Dollfus was the President of the Société astronomique de France (SAF), the French popular astronomy society, from 1979 to 1981. The Société astronomique de France awarded him its Prix Jules Janssen in 1993.

<doc id="726316" wikidata="Q456714" url="?curid=726316" title="Vladimir Ilyushin">
<text>Vladimir Sergeyevich Ilyushin (; 31 March 1927 – 1 March 2010) was a Russian military officer and a test pilot in the former Soviet space program. Ilyushin was a son of the famous aviation designer Sergey Ilyushin, and whose career was mostly as a test pilot for the Sukhoi OKB (a rival of Ilyushin OKB). After retiring from the space program, Ilyushin became a sports administrator and was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame (then known as the IRB Hall of Fame) in 2013.

In 1961, Ilyushin was the subject of a conspiracy theory that he, rather than Yuri Gagarin, was the first cosmonaut in space. There is no evidence and no support for the theory.

==Career as test pilot==
Ilyushin was a test pilot and lieutenant general in the Soviet Air Forces. He piloted the maiden flights of the Sukhoi&#x27;s Su-11 (1958), Т-5 (1958), Su-15 (1962), Su-17 (1966), Su-24 (1967), Т-4 (1972), Su-25 (1975) and the Su-27 (1977). Ilyushin demonstrated his outstanding piloting skills as a test pilot of the Sukhoi Su-24. He flew a course so precisely that he caused a software crash in the aircraft instrumentation. That is, the software initially used in the nav/attack system of the Su-24 lacked a null function, and failed to proceed after it hit the so-called &quot;machine zero&quot;, i.e. Ilyushin&#x27;s actual geographical position became identical to the mission target input into the software. There had been no expectation that this objective would be achieved and there was no provision for it, in the software used during his test flight.

==Rugby union==
Ilyushin was first exposed to rugby while studying at the Moscow Aviation Institute in the 1940s; according to World Rugby (formerly the International Rugby Board, or IRB), &quot;His love of the sport was immediate and stayed with him for the rest of his life.&quot; He went on to a career as a rugby administrator that made him, according to then-IRB president Bernard Lapasset, &quot;a true pioneer of Rugby in Russia&quot;. On 31 March 1967 (his 40th birthday), he founded the Soviet Rugby Federation, and was named its first president. By 1975, he had fully integrated the Soviet Union into the European international structure, and the following year played a significant role in the creation of a Soviet club championship. Ilyushin&#x27;s career as an administrator continued into the post-communist era. He died two days after Russia secured its place in the 2011 Rugby World Cup, the country&#x27;s first appearance ever in that competition. In February 2013, Ilyushin was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame, now known as the World Rugby Hall of Fame, during the pool allocation draw for the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens in Moscow.

==Alleged first person in space ==
Two days before Gagarin&#x27;s launch on 12 April 1961, Dennis Ogden wrote in the Western Communist newspaper the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; that the Soviet Union&#x27;s announcement that Ilyushin had been involved in a serious car crash was really a cover story for a 7 April 1961 orbital spaceflight gone wrong. A similar story was told by French broadcaster Eduard Bobrovsky, but his version had the launch occurring in March, resulting in Ilyushin slipping into a coma. NORAD tracking stations, however, had no record of any such launch. Later that year, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; transmitted the rumor by claiming that Gagarin had never flown, and was merely a stand-in for the sickened Ilyushin. The 1999 film &quot;The Cosmonaut Cover-Up&quot; takes the position that Ilyushin was the first man in space and discusses the alleged cover-up in detail. They claim, &quot;According to recently declassified documents, Ilyushin was placed in a capsule named Rossiya, and the secret flight took place in the early hours of the morning, on Friday April 7th 1961&quot;. After a guidance malfunction, the cosmonaut is reported to have made an unguided crash landing in China, too critically injured to announce the mission a complete success. The 2009 film &quot;Fallen Idol: The Yuri Gagarin Conspiracy&quot; also takes the same position and further discusses US efforts to continue the allegation, even citing national security not to release information under the Freedom of Information Act. The data sought was from the CIA tracking station at Tern Island that supposedly covered and recorded Iluyshin&#x27;s failed mission.

According to Mark Wade, editor of the space history web site &quot;Encyclopedia Astronautica&quot;, &quot;The entire early history of the Soviet manned space program has been declassified and we have piles of memoirs of cosmonauts, engineers, etc., who participated. We know who was in the original cosmonaut team, who never flew, was dismissed, or was killed in ground tests. Ilyushin is not one of them.&quot;

<text>James Howard Thome (; ; born August 27, 1970) is an American former professional baseball first baseman, third baseman and designated hitter, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 22 seasons (1991–2012). A prolific power hitter, Thome hit 612 home runs during his career—the eighth-most all time. He amassed a total of 2,328 hits and 1,699 runs batted in (RBIs). His career batting average was .276. He was a member of five All-Star teams and won a Silver Slugger Award in 1996.

Thome grew up in Peoria, Illinois, as part of a large blue-collar family of athletes, who predominantly played baseball and basketball. After attending Illinois Central College, he was drafted by the Indians in the 1989 draft, and made his big league debut in 1991. Early in his career, Thome played third base, before eventually becoming a first baseman. With the Indians, he was part of a core of players that led the franchise to five consecutive playoff appearances in the 1990s, including World Series appearances in 1995 and 1997. Thome spent over a decade with Cleveland, before leaving via free agency after the 2002 season, to join the Philadelphia Phillies, with whom he spent the following three seasons. Traded to the Chicago White Sox before the 2006 season, he won the American League (AL) Comeback Player of the Year Award that year and joined the 500 home run club during his three-season tenure with the White Sox. By this point in his career, back pain limited Thome to being a designated hitter. After stints with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Minnesota Twins, he made brief returns to Cleveland and Philadelphia, before ending his career with the Baltimore Orioles. Upon retiring, Thome accepted an executive position with the White Sox.

Throughout his career, Thome&#x27;s strength was power hitting. In 12 different seasons, he hit at least 30 home runs, topping 40 home runs in six of those seasons. He hit a career-high 52 home runs in 2002, and in 2003 he led the National League in home runs with 47. Due in part to his ability to draw walks, with 12 seasons of at least 90 bases on balls, he finished his career with a .402 on-base percentage. Thome&#x27;s career on-base plus slugging (OPS) of .956 ranks 19th all-time. In 2011, he became only the eighth MLB player to hit 600 home runs. Thome is the career leader in walk-off home runs with 13. One of his trademarks was his unique batting stance, in which he held the bat out with his right hand and pointed it at right field before the pitcher threw, something he first saw in &quot;The Natural&quot;. Thome was known for his consistently positive attitude and &quot;gregarious&quot; personality. An active philanthropist during his playing career, he was honored with two Marvin Miller Man of the Year Awards, a Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, and a Roberto Clemente Award for his community involvement. In 2018, Thome was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.

==Early life==
Thome was born in Peoria, Illinois, on August 27, 1970, and is the youngest of five children. Many of the Thome family played sports: Jim&#x27;s grandmother was hired at a local Caterpillar plant solely to play for the company&#x27;s softball team; his father built bulldozers for Caterpillar and played slow-pitch softball; his aunt Caroline Thome Hart is in the Women&#x27;s Softball Hall of Fame; and his two older brothers, Chuck III and Randy, played baseball at Limestone High School. Thome learned to play baseball from his father on a tennis court, and also played basketball in what he described as the &quot;ghetto&quot; of Peoria, noting that he was the only white kid there but that he earned the respect of his fellow players. One day during his youth, Thome sneaked into the Cubs&#x27; clubhouse at Wrigley Field in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain an autograph from his favorite player, Dave Kingman. Though Thome received signatures from several other players, this experience influenced him to be generous with signing autographs for fans during his playing career.

As with his older brothers, Thome attended Limestone High School where he achieved all-state honors in basketball and as a baseball shortstop. He played American Legion Baseball for Bartonville Limestone Post 979 in his hometown, as well. Although he had hoped to draw the attention of scouts, at just he was relatively underweight for his height, meaning that he attracted only passing interest—the average Major League Baseball (MLB) player weighed in 1993. Thome graduated in 1988 and, after not being drafted, enrolled at Illinois Central College where he continued his baseball and basketball careers. After one season, he was drafted by MLB&#x27;s Cleveland Indians as an &quot;afterthought&quot; in the 13th round (333rd overall) of the 1989 MLB draft.

==Professional career==

===Minor leagues (1989–1991)===
For the 1989 season, Thome was assigned to the Gulf Coast League Indians, a minor league affiliate of the Cleveland Indians. He finished the year with a .237 batting average, no home runs, and 22 runs batted in (RBIs) in 55 games. After his rookie season, he met &quot;hitting guru&quot; Charlie Manuel, who later became his manager and mentor. Unlike most Indians staff, Manuel saw potential in Thome and worked hard with him, particularly on his hip motion while swinging the bat. Thome later said, &quot;[Manuel] saw something in me I didn&#x27;t.&quot; During this work, Manuel suggested to Thome that he point his bat out to center field before the pitch to relax himself like Roy Hobbs did when batting in the baseball film &quot;The Natural&quot;. The work paid off; in 1990, Thome hit .340 and totaled 16 home runs and 50 RBIs in 67 games playing at both the Rookie and Class A levels of the minor leagues. Thome spent most of the 1991 season splitting time between Double-A and Triple-A where, in combination, he hit .319 with seven home runs and 73 RBIs in 125 games.

===Cleveland Indians (1991–2002)===

Thome made his MLB debut on September 4, 1991, as a third baseman against the Minnesota Twins. In the game, he recorded two hits in four at bats (2-for-4). He hit his first career home run on October 4. Injuries shortened his 1992 campaign, during which he played for both the Indians and their Triple-A affiliate, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. Across the minor and major leagues that year, he combined to hit .236 with four home runs and 26 RBIs in 52 games. In 1993, playing mostly for the Charlotte Knights, the Indians&#x27; new Triple-A affiliate, he led the International League with a .332 batting average and 102 RBIs, complemented by 25 home runs in 115 games. This performance earned him a late season promotion to the major league, where he hit .266 with seven home runs and 22 RBIs in 47 games.

Thome spent the entire 1994 season with Cleveland, playing in 98 games while hitting .268 with 20 home runs and 52 RBIs, before the 1994 players&#x27; strike forced cancellation of the season&#x27;s remaining games. Thome achieved his first career multi-home run game, hitting two solo home runs on June 22, 1994, against Detroit Tigers&#x27; pitcher John Doherty.
Part of a strong Cleveland lineup in 1995, Thome hit .314 with 25 home runs and 73 RBIs in 137 games. The Indians won the American League pennant but lost the 1995 World Series to the Atlanta Braves in six games. Thome hit .211 in the World Series with one home run and two RBIs. During the 1996 season, Thome hit 38 home runs.

Before their 1997 season, the Indians moved Thome, originally a third baseman, to first base after acquiring third baseman Matt Williams from the San Francisco Giants. That year, Thome helped the Indians set a new franchise single-season record for home runs (220), contributing 40 of them. Thome also totaled an AL-high 120 walks to go along with 102 RBIs in 147 games. Cleveland returned to the World Series, but they lost to the Florida Marlins in seven games; Thome hit .286 with two home runs and four RBIs in the World Series.

An article in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; published in July 1998 commented that despite Thome&#x27;s early career success (two All-Star Games and appearances in two of the previous three World Series), he was only &quot;faintly famous&quot; nationally and was not particularly well known outside of Cleveland or his hometown, Peoria. His former teammate Jeromy Burnitz said, &quot;You can&#x27;t really say he&#x27;s underrated, because everybody considers him one of the top hitters in the American League, but he&#x27;s surrounded by so many good players, it&#x27;s hard to stand out on that team.&quot; In August, Thome broke a bone in his right hand and spent several weeks on the disabled list, missing 35 games. He finished the year with 30 home runs and 85 RBIs while posting a .293 batting average in 123 games. Thome hit four home runs in the AL Championship Series against the New York Yankees, but Cleveland lost the series in six games.

In 1999, Thome&#x27;s batting average fell to .277, but he increased both his home run and RBI totals to 33 and 108, respectively. On July 3, 1999, against Kansas City Royals pitcher Don Wengert, Thome hit a home run at Jacobs Field, the longest home run ever at a Cleveland ballpark. Thome hit four home runs in the AL Division Series against the Boston Red Sox, but the Indians lost the series three games to two.

During the 2000 season, Thome hit .269 with 37 home runs and 106 RBIs in 158 games. In 2001, he finished second in the AL with 49 home runs. In addition, Thome had 124 RBIs and 111 walks in 156 games. However, he led the league with 185 strikeouts.

Thome had his best season with Cleveland in 2002, leading the AL in walks (122), slugging percentage (.677) and on-base plus slugging (OPS) (1.122), while batting .304 (16th in AL) with a .445 on-base percentage (second in AL). He also hit a career-high 52 home runs (second in AL) and collected 118 RBIs (seventh in AL). The 52 home runs set a new Cleveland Indians&#x27; single-season record and made Thome the 21st major league player to join the 50 home run club. During his stint with the Cleveland Indians, when Jim Thome would hit a home run, the scoreboard would often display &quot;THOME RUN&quot; to mark this accomplishment. He was also known as the &quot;THOMENATOR&quot; during this time. On December 6, 2002, Thome, who was a free agent, signed a six-year, $85 million contract with the Philadelphia Phillies – he thought the Phillies were closer to winning a championship than the Indians. With the Phillies, Thome&#x27;s salary rose from $8 million per year to $11 million per year. Thome hit a franchise record 334 home runs in his first stint with the Indians.

===Philadelphia Phillies (2003–2005)===

Thome hit 47 home runs in his first season with the Phillies, finishing one behind Mike Schmidt&#x27;s single-season team record of 48 in 1980, and tied with Alex Rodriguez for the MLB lead in 2003. On June 14, 2004, at Citizens Bank Park, Thome hit his 400th career home run, surpassing Al Kaline for 37th on the all-time home run list. He ended the 2004 season batting .274 with 42 home runs and 105 RBIs in 143 games. In 2004, Thome won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, which is given to players who best exemplify Gehrig&#x27;s character and integrity both on and off the field.

Thome missed a significant portion of the first half of the Phillies&#x27; 2005 season due to injury; he compiled only a .207 batting average with seven home runs and 30 RBIs going into the All-Star break. He had season-ending surgery on his right elbow in August, while his replacement at first base, Ryan Howard, won the NL Rookie of the Year Award. The Phillies traded Thome and cash considerations to the Chicago White Sox on November 25, 2005, for outfielder Aaron Rowand and minor league pitching prospects Gio González and Daniel Haigwood. Though the emergence of Howard made Thome more expendable to the squad, another factor in his trade to the White Sox was his family situation – Thome&#x27;s mother, the &quot;go-to lady&quot; in his family and his biggest fan, had died a year earlier, and he worried about his father. Since Philadelphia was willing to trade him, Thome waived the no-trade clause in his contract for the good of the team and requested that if possible, they trade him to either the Chicago White Sox or Cubs so he could be near his father.

===Chicago White Sox (2006–2009)===

Thome became Chicago&#x27;s regular designated hitter in April 2006 and flourished in his first season in Chicago. He set the team record for most home runs in the month of April (10), overtaking Frank Thomas&#x27;s previous record by one. He also set a major league record by scoring in each of Chicago&#x27;s first 17 games. For the season, Thome hit 42 home runs, drove in 109 runs, and hit .288 in 143 games, though he struck out in 30% of his plate appearances, the highest percentage in the AL. On May 1, 2006, Thome returned to Cleveland to play against the Indians in his first game as a visitor at Jacobs Field, and received an unenthusiastic reception.

On September 16, 2007, Thome joined the 500 home run club by hitting a walk-off home run against Los Angeles Angels pitcher Dustin Moseley. Thome became the 23rd major leaguer to reach the milestone and the third in the 2007 MLB season (the others were Frank Thomas and Alex Rodriguez), as well as the first ever to do it with a walk-off home run. Several family members including his father were on hand to witness the accomplishment, which occurred at a game during which the White Sox distributed free Thome bobbleheads to fans. Thome celebrated by pointing upward in homage to his late mother as he rounded the bases.

On June 4, 2008, Thome hit a home run—which at the time was the ninth-longest home run in U.S. Cellular Field history—against Kansas City Royals pitcher Luke Hochevar in a 6–4 White Sox victory. He hit a solo home run in the AL Central Tiebreaker game, which proved to be the difference as the White Sox defeated the Minnesota Twins, 1–0. Those two 2008 home runs are honored with a plaque in the center field Fan Deck at Rate Field.

Thome&#x27;s hitting remained strong during Chicago&#x27;s 2009 season, as he hit .249 with 23 home runs and 74 RBIs in 107 games, including his 550th career home run on June 1. On July 17, 2009, he hit a grand slam and a three-run home run for a single-game career-high seven RBIs. By the conclusion of the season, he had passed Reggie Jackson for 11th place on the all-time home run list with 564 home runs.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2009)===
On August 31, 2009, the White Sox traded Thome to the Los Angeles Dodgers along with financial considerations for minor league infielder Justin Fuller. Thome waived his no-trade clause because he thought the Dodgers could win the World Series, but Thome&#x27;s only appearances with the Dodgers were as a pinch hitter, due to chronic foot injuries that limited his mobility. Thome reunited with former Cleveland teammate Manny Ramirez in Los Angeles. He hit .235 (4-for-17) with no home runs and three RBIs in 17 games with the Dodgers. After the season, Thome filed for free agency.

===Minnesota Twins (2010–2011)===

On January 26, 2010, Thome signed a one-year, $1.5 million contract with the Minnesota Twins. Thome hit his first home run with the Twins on April 8, during the Twins&#x27; season-opening road trip. The Twins opened Target Field, their new home stadium, on April 12, 2010. This was the third time in Thome&#x27;s career that his team had opened a new stadium – the 1994 Cleveland Indians when they opened Jacobs Field, and the 2004 Philadelphia Phillies when they opened Citizens Bank Park. On July 3, Thome hit two home runs, passing fellow Twin Harmon Killebrew for tenth on the all-time home run list. The game was stopped and the Twins played a pre-recorded message from Killebrew congratulating Thome on the accomplishment, during which Killebrew noted he was happy Thome did it while a member of the Twins. Thome hit the first walk-off hit in Target Field on August 17, a 445-foot two-run home run in the bottom of the 10th inning against the White Sox. It was the 12th walk-off home run of his career, tying him for the most all time (a record he subsequently broke). On September 4, Thome again hit two home runs in a single game to tie and then pass Mark McGwire for the ninth spot on the career home run list. Thome surpassed Frank Robinson&#x27;s home run total on September 11, when he hit his 587th career home run in the top of the 12th inning in Cleveland. Toward the end of the season, Thome commented that playing with the Twins made him feel rejuvenated. He finished the 2010 season with a .283 average, 25 home runs and 59 RBIs in 108 games. Thome posted his best slugging percentage since 2002.

In January 2011, Thome accepted a one-year, $3 million contract with incentives to continue playing for the Twins. On July 17, Thome hit the longest home run ever at Target Field, a home run into the upper deck in right-center field. He hit his 599th and 600th career home runs (in consecutive at-bats) at Comerica Park in Detroit on August 15, making him only the eighth player to achieve that home run total.

===Second stint with Cleveland (2011)===
On August 26, 2011, Thome waived his contractual no-trade clause to return to his first team, the Cleveland Indians, in exchange for future considerations for the Twins. On September 18, the clubs announced that Minnesota had received $20,000 for him, which Aaron Gleeman of NBC Sports called &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;nothing&quot;; Paul Hoynes of &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; wrote that ticket and jersey sales alone from re-acquiring Thome covered the money they paid to acquire him. On September 23, Cleveland held a ceremony to honor Thome, and revealed plans to erect a statue depicting him in Heritage Park. In the game, he hit a home run that landed near the proposed location for his statue. While with Cleveland in 2011, Thome played in 22 games, predominantly hitting fifth in the batting order, and he posted a .296 batting average with three home runs and 10 RBIs. Through 2011, Thome was second among all active major leaguers in career home runs (604; behind Alex Rodriguez) and RBIs (1,674; Rodriguez), and fifth in career slugging percentage (.556; behind Albert Pujols, Rodriguez, Ryan Braun, and Howard). Thome is currently the Indians/Guardians&#x27; all-time leader in home runs (337), walks (1,008), and strikeouts (1,400).

===Second stint with Philadelphia (2012)===

On November 4, 2011, Thome agreed to a one-year, $1.25 million deal that returned him to Philadelphia. He called coming back to Philadelphia a &quot;no-brainer&quot; in his news conference. He also mentioned that, due to Ryan Howard&#x27;s Achilles tendon injury, he would &quot;spend the offseason preparing himself to play first base once or twice a week&quot;, despite not having played defensively since 2007. Thome started his first game at first base since 2007 on April 8, 2012, during which he started a 3–6–3 double play.

Thome experienced stiffness in his lower back in the Phillies&#x27; game against the Chicago Cubs on April 28, and early in May, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained lower back. At the time, he was batting only .100. Thome returned to the club in early June, and prepared for interleague play against the Baltimore Orioles as the DH. Thome finished the nine-game interleague road trip with four home runs and 14 RBIs.

On June 17, Thome became the fourth major league player to hit 100 home runs with three different teams, joining Reggie Jackson, Darrell Evans and Rodriguez. Six days later, Thome hit a pinch-hit walk-off home run in the ninth inning off of Jake McGee to beat the Tampa Bay Rays, 7–6. This was Thome&#x27;s 609th home run, tying Sammy Sosa for seventh all-time in home runs while also setting the new record for most walk-off home runs (13) in the modern era. Thome&#x27;s last game as a Phillie was an afternoon loss to the Miami Marlins on June 30. After the game (which coincided with Howard&#x27;s return from the disabled list), the team announced that Thome had been traded to Baltimore to serve as their designated hitter.

===Baltimore Orioles (2012)===

The Orioles cited Thome&#x27;s veteran experience on a playoff-bound team as a primary factor in acquiring him. Orioles catcher Matt Wieters said of Thome,

On July 20, Thome hit his first home run with the Orioles, his 610th of all time moving him past Sosa for seventh place all-time, against the Indians at Progressive Field. On August 6, Thome was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a herniated disk; he remained on the DL until September 21. In his first game back, he drove in the game-winning run in extra innings against the Boston Red Sox. After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, &quot;There&#x27;s a lot [of] memories. I&#x27;ve had great memories on that side and then coming in here as an opponent against them. Any time you come home, they say, it&#x27;s very special. It&#x27;s even more special to get the W&#x27;s. That&#x27;s, I think, the main thing. The bottom line is I played here a long time.&quot; Orioles teammates remarked at Thome&#x27;s commitment to talking about the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, &quot;I talk the game. When I sit in the dugout during games, I talk baseball to these guys. They&#x27;ll ask, &#x27;Hey, what&#x27;s this pitcher like?&#x27; or &#x27;What about the game?&#x27; &#x27;What about all those Indians teams you were on?&#x27; I did it to Eddie Murray when he was in his 40s.&quot; The Orioles made the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Yankees during the AL Division Series. Thome hit .133 in the playoffs with no home runs or RBIs.

==Post-playing career==

On July 2, 2013, Thome joined the White Sox organization as special assistant to the general manager. In the future, Thome aspires to be a manager, an aspiration that White Sox chairman Jerry Reinsdorf wholeheartedly supports; Reinsdorf commented, &quot;He can be a batting coach. He&#x27;d be a great batting coach, but someday he&#x27;ll be a manager.&quot; In March 2014, Thome clarified that he was not officially retired; while he &quot;loves&quot; his front office job with the White Sox, he would &quot;have to take&quot; a call about him playing again. However, on August 2, 2014, he signed a one-day contract with the Cleveland Indians to retire officially as a member of the team. In addition to his role with the White Sox, Thome currently serves as an analyst for MLB Network.

On January 24, 2018, Thome was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. He was formally inducted on July 29, 2018, alongside Trevor Hoffman, Vladimir Guerrero, and Chipper Jones. He was the first person to be inducted as an Indian without the use of Chief Wahoo on his plaque since the mascot&#x27;s inception in 1947. The Indians retired Thome&#x27;s number 25 on August 18, 2018.

On February 23, 2022, Thome was announced as the new president of the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association, succeeding Brooks Robinson.

==Player profile==

===Offense===

Thome is regarded as a great example of a &quot;pure&quot; power hitter, as indicated by his .278 Isolated Power (ISO) rating. Thome&#x27;s consistency was a draw for clubs to continue to sign him, even toward the very end of his 22-year career and after most sluggers&#x27; productivity fades. In 2011, he was ranked the sixth-best designated hitter in MLB history by Fox Sports. During his career, he compiled a .284 batting average against fastballs but compiled just a .170 batting average against sliders.

Since Thome was a pull hitter, opposing teams often employed a defensive shift against him; by playing three infielders on the right side of the field and the outfielders towards his pull side, teams put themselves in better position to field batted balls. In 2011, &quot;Lindy&#x27;s Sports&quot; described him as an &quot;extremely patient veteran slugger who launches cripple fastballs and breaking-ball mistakes to all fields&quot;, though they did note that he struck out frequently, had poor speed, and should serve only as a designated hitter. During his career, he had strong power numbers; in 15 of his 22 seasons, he had a slugging percentage of over .500. He is an example of a &quot;three-true-outcome&quot; player; 47.6% of his career plate appearances resulted in either home runs, strikeouts, or walks, the highest of all time by nearly seven percentage points. Thome averaged 111 bases on balls per 162 games, and currently ranks seventh on the MLB career walks list with 1,747. He led the American League in walks in three seasons, all with Cleveland (1997, 1999 and 2002). He is a self-described slow runner, but has said that he always hustled. He stole only 19 bases after 1994.

===Defense===

Thome began his career playing third base and did so until the 1997 season, when he converted to first base to make room at third after the Indians traded for Matt Williams. Injuries, however, took their toll and confined him almost exclusively to being a designated hitter in the latter stages of his career. Overall, he spent 10 separate stints on the disabled list, mostly for his back. By the end of Thome&#x27;s career, his back prevented him from playing the field effectively—he played first base four times with the Phillies in 2012, which marked the first time he played the field since 2007 with the White Sox. By the end of his career, writers described him as being a &quot;huge liability in the field&quot;.

===Playing characteristics===
Thome was known throughout the baseball world for wearing high socks and for his unique batting stance. In 1997, the Indians wore high socks for his birthday in August, but ended up wearing them for the remainder of the season out of superstition and eventually reached the World Series. Upon his return to the Indians in 2011, the club again sported the high socks as a tribute. His batting stance featured him pointing his bat to center field prior to the pitch. Thome adopted this stance from Charlie Manuel, who was the Indians hitting coach, and since then Ryan Howard has also adopted it. Thome credits his calm demeanor to his role model during his early playing years, Eddie Murray, once commenting, 

===Personality===

Thome&#x27;s friendly personality has been the subject of much attention. In a 2007 poll of 464 MLB players, he tied with Mike Sweeney for second-friendliest player, behind Sean Casey. After Thome hit his 600th home run, Twins closer Joe Nathan said, &quot;He is the world&#x27;s nicest man.&quot; Teammate Michael Cuddyer added, &quot;He is the nicest, gentlest, kindest guy you will ever meet ... to everything except the baseball, he still hits that really hard.&quot; His kindness comes up in conversations with many MLB players. When he signed with the Phillies in the offseason before the 2012 season, Phillies general manager Rubén Amaro Jr. cited Thome&#x27;s constant positive attitude as a main reason for his signing. As an exercise in remaining humble, he annually visited his high school prior to spring training. A &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article said that Thome frequently signs autographs for fans and that he is &quot;endlessly patient with requests&quot;. In a piece for &quot;Philadelphia&quot; magazine discussing Thome&#x27;s Baseball Hall of Fame prospects, sportswriter Stephen Silver wrote,
A fan poll in &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; in 2003 named him the most popular athlete in Cleveland sports history.

===Career legacy===
Despite his injuries throughout his later years, Thome totaled, according to Fangraphs, 71.6 Wins Above Replacement (WAR), a sabermetrics baseball statistic intended to quantify a player&#x27;s total contributions to a team. He was one of few players whose prime was during the steroid era and who was not suspected of using steroids; Thome adamantly denies ever using performance-enhancing drugs. Soon after the announcement of his front office position (which signified the end of his playing career), writers began to speculate as to whether Thome would make it to the Baseball Hall of Fame, and more specifically, whether he would gain entrance in his first year of eligibility in 2018. Writers also questioned whether Thome&#x27;s candidacy would be hindered by his lack of self-promotion and others&#x27; tendency to overlook him.

==Personal life==

Thome and his wife, Andrea, have two children, Lila Grace and Landon. He has also established funds to put his 10 nieces and nephews through college. During the offseason he lives in Burr Ridge, Illinois. ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot; reported that shortly after his nephew, Brandon, was paralyzed in an accident, he asked Thome to hit a home run for him; Thome obliged, hitting two in the subsequent game. Thome is also a philanthropist and provided help to the communities surrounding the teams for which he played. In recognition of his community involvement, he was given the Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award in 2001 and 2004, and the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award in 2004. In 2013, after the November 17, 2013, tornado outbreak struck Washington, Illinois, just from his hometown, he and his wife pledged to donate $100,000 to relief efforts. Among the philanthropic endeavors Thome and his wife heavily support are Children&#x27;s Home + Aid, which strives to help underprivileged children predominantly with finding care (e.g., foster care, adoption, etc.), and an annual benefit to raise money for the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Illinois, continuing a tradition his mother started years ago. Moreover, the Thomes try &quot;to stay connected with at least one or two organizations in each of the cities&quot; that Thome has played.

In 2019, a renovated youth baseball field in Cleveland was named the &#x27;Jim Thome All-Star Complex&#x27; in his honor.

<text>William Wallace Campbell (April 11, 1862 – June 14, 1938) was an American astronomer, and director of Lick Observatory from 1901 to 1930. He specialized in spectroscopy. He was the tenth president of the University of California from 1923 to 1930.

==Biography==
He was born on a farm in Hancock County, Ohio, the son of Robert Wilson and Harriet Welsh Campbell. After a few years of local schooling he entered in 1882 the University of Michigan to study civil engineering, graduating Bachelor of Science in 1886. Whilst at university he developed his interest in astronomy when he read Simon Newcomb&#x27;s &quot;Popular Astronomy&quot;.

After graduating he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of Colorado but soon moved back to Michigan as an instructor in astronomy. In 1891 he was invited to work on spectroscopy at Lick Observatory in California. Campbell was a pioneer of astronomical spectroscopy and catalogued the radial velocities of stars. He was also recognized for his work in solar eclipse photography. In 1893 he discovered the Wolf–Rayet star HD 184738 (also known as Campbell&#x27;s hydrogen envelope star). He was made a director of Lick Observatory from 1901 to 1930.

In August 1914, Campbell and Erwin Freundlich of the Berlin Observatory were in Russia to photograph a solar eclipse, in an early attempt to test the validity of Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity. The outbreak of World War I (and in particular Germany&#x27;s declaration of war against Russia) led to the seizure of Freundlich and his equipment in the Crimea by Russian officers. Campbell, from neutral America, was permitted to continue with his plans, but cloud cover obscured the eclipse. Campbell undertook another attempt to photograph a solar eclipse on June 8, 1918, in Goldendale, in Washington state. But his precision photographic equipment had been retained in Russia four years earlier, and he had to improvise the needed apparatus from existing equipment at the Lick Observatory. The cameras he used were not adequate to provide the measurement accuracy needed to confirm the deflection of star light predicted by Einstein&#x27;s theory. The equipment from Russia was finally shipped back on August 15, 1917, arriving August 21 the following year.

Confirmation of Einstein&#x27;s theory came in 1919 in the wake of an expedition led by Arthur Eddington to photograph the eclipse of May 29, 1919. But some uncertainty remained, as well as scepticism fueled in part by anti-German sentiment in the wake of World War I. Final and uncontested confirmation is generally dated to Campbell&#x27;s 1922 Lick Observatory expedition to Australia to photograph the solar eclipse. Campbell&#x27;s report of the results state that the observations &quot;furnish a value … which agrees exactly with Einstein&#x27;s prediction.&quot;

He served as 10th President of the University of California from 1923 to 1930. He also served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science &amp; the Public, from 1923 to 1926. He served three terms as president of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (in 1895, 1909 and 1918).

He committed suicide in California at the age of 76 by leaping to his death from a fourth-story window in San Francisco. He was mostly blind and suffering from bouts of aphasia. This was not only very frustrating to him, but he felt that it left him a burden to his family in terms of care and expense, according to notes he left behind at the time of his death. He married Elizabeth Ballard Thompson in 1892; they had three sons (one of them was WWI ace Douglas Campbell).

*Solar eclipse of August 21, 1914, Brovary, Ukraine
*Solar eclipse of June 8, 1918, Goldendale, Washington
*Solar eclipse of September 21, 1922, Wallal, Australia

== Family ==
He married Elizabeth Ballard Thompson in 1892; they had three sons (one of them was WWI ace Douglas Campbell). Elizabeth contributed greatly to Campbell&#x27;s work and played an important role in his success as a scientist. She adopted the role of hostess during his time as director of the Lick Observatory, also undertaking public relations work on behalf of the Observatory by writing letters to staff and potential donors and supporters of her husband&#x27;s work. Elizabeth organised many of the expeditions that Campbell led, arranging the expedition members travel, food, supplies and living quarters. She contributed to the work of the expeditions by undertaking astronomical spectroscopy, developing plates and extensively documented the expeditions including writing two manuscripts.

<doc id="726332" wikidata="Q7642976" url="?curid=726332" title="Super ultra-low emission vehicle">
<text>Super ultra-low emissions vehicle (SULEV) is a U.S. classification for passenger vehicle emissions. The classification is based on producing 90% fewer emissions than the average gasoline-powered vehicle. The SULEV standard is stricter than the standard for LEV (low emission vehicle) and ULEV (ultra-low-emission vehicle), however not as strict as PZEV (partial zero-emissions vehicle) which meets the SULEV standard for tailpipe emissions, but has zero instead of reduced evaporative emissions. Japan also offers an SU-LEV classification, for vehicles that show a 75 percent reduction in emissions vis-à-vis the 2005 emissions standards.

==Examples==

Examples of vehicles delivering SULEV emissions performance include:
* Honda Accord 2000-
* Honda Insight (CVT transmission models only) 
* Honda Civic Hybrid CVT transmission models only, AT-PZEV available in certain states 
* Honda Civic GX Natural Gas 
* Honda CR-Z (AT-PZEV)
* Toyota Prius
* Ford Focus SULEV
* BMW SULEV 230i, i3 REx, 128i, 328i, 325i, 325Ci, and 325iT
* Subaru PZEV Vehicles beginning with 2008 year models including Forester, Outback, and Legacy
* Chevrolet Volt
* Hyundai Elantra
* Lexus CT200h
* Honda Clarity PHEV 2018 – LEV3-SULEV20
* Kia Forte
* Volkswagen Jetta
* Mini Cooper Hardtop 4-Door
* Toyota RAV4 Hybrid
* Pontiac Grand Prix, 3800 V6 equipped vehicles beginning with the 2005 model year
* Toyota Highlander Hybrid
* Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid
* Volvo S80 PZEV

==Tax incentives==
In California, manufacturers of SULEVs can be given a partial credit for producing a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) and so a vehicle of this type can be administratively designated as a partial zero-emissions vehicle (PZEV). In order to qualify as a PZEV, a vehicle must meet the SULEV standard and, in addition, have zero evaporative emissions from its fuel system plus a 15-year/ warranty on its emission-control components.

In the case of hybrid vehicles this warranty is extended to the electric propulsion components (electric motor/generator/starter, battery, inverter, controls) and their mechanical interface to the driveline. However, the high-voltage battery warranty is limited to ten years (but still 150,000 miles).

<doc id="726335" wikidata="Q1669863" url="?curid=726335" title="Compact-open topology">
<text>In mathematics, the compact-open topology is a topology defined on the set of continuous maps between two topological spaces. The compact-open topology is one of the commonly used topologies on function spaces, and is applied in homotopy theory and functional analysis. It was introduced by Ralph Fox in 1945.

If the codomain of the functions under consideration has a uniform structure or a metric structure then the compact-open topology is the &quot;topology of uniform convergence on compact sets.&quot; That is to say, a sequence of functions converges in the compact-open topology precisely when it converges uniformly on every compact subset of the domain.

== Definition ==
Let and be two topological spaces, and let denote the set of all continuous maps between and . Given a compact subset of and an open subset of , let denote the set of all functions such that In other words, formula_1. Then the collection of all such is a subbase for the compact-open topology on . (This collection does not always form a base for a topology on .)

When working in the category of compactly generated spaces, it is common to modify this definition by restricting to the subbase formed from those that are the image of a compact Hausdorff space. Of course, if is compactly generated and Hausdorff, this definition coincides with the previous one. However, the modified definition is crucial if one wants the convenient category of compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces to be Cartesian closed, among other useful properties. The confusion between this definition and the one above is caused by differing usage of the word compact.

If is locally compact, then formula_2 from the category of topological spaces always has a right adjoint formula_3. This adjoint coincides with the compact-open topology and may be used to uniquely define it. The modification of the definition for compactly generated spaces may be viewed as taking the adjoint of the product in the category of compactly generated spaces instead of the category of topological spaces, which ensures that the right adjoint always exists.

== Properties ==
* If is a one-point space then one can identify with , and under this identification the compact-open topology agrees with the topology on . More generally, if is a discrete space, then can be identified with the cartesian product of copies of and the compact-open topology agrees with the product topology.
* If is , , Hausdorff, regular, or Tychonoff, then the compact-open topology has the corresponding separation axiom.
* If is Hausdorff and is a subbase for , then the collection is a subbase for the compact-open topology on .
* If is a metric space (or more generally, a uniform space), then the compact-open topology is equal to the topology of compact convergence. In other words, if is a metric space, then a sequence converges to in the compact-open topology if and only if for every compact subset of , converges uniformly to on . If is compact and is a uniform space, then the compact-open topology is equal to the topology of uniform convergence.
* If and are topological spaces, with locally compact Hausdorff (or even just locally compact preregular), then the composition map given by is continuous (here all the function spaces are given the compact-open topology and is given the product topology).
*If is a locally compact Hausdorff (or preregular) space, then the evaluation map , defined by , is continuous. This can be seen as a special case of the above where is a one-point space.
* If is compact, and is a metric space with metric , then the compact-open topology on is metrizable, and a metric for it is given by for in . More generally, if is hemicompact, and metric, the compact-open topology is metrizable by the construction linked here. 

=== Applications ===
The compact open topology can be used to topologize the following sets:

* formula_4, the loop space of formula_5 at formula_6,
* formula_7,
* formula_8.

In addition, there is a homotopy equivalence between the spaces formula_9. These topological spaces, formula_10 are useful in homotopy theory because it can be used to form a topological space and a model for the homotopy type of the &quot;set&quot; of homotopy classes of maps
:formula_11
This is because formula_12 is the set of path components in formula_10, that is, there is an isomorphism of sets
:formula_14
where formula_15 is the homotopy equivalence.

== Fréchet differentiable functions ==
Let and be two Banach spaces defined over the same field, and let denote the set of all -continuously Fréchet-differentiable functions from the open subset to . The compact-open topology is the initial topology induced by the seminorms

:formula_16

where , for each compact subset .

<doc id="726337" wikidata="Q5978094" url="?curid=726337" title="Frameup">
<text>In the United States criminal law, a frame-up (frameup) or setup is the act of falsely implicating (framing) someone in a crime by providing fabricated evidence or testimony. In British usage, to frame, or stitch up, is to maliciously or dishonestly incriminate someone or set them up, in the sense trap or ensnare.

While those who are innocent might be done out of sheer malice, framing is primarily used as a distraction. Generally, the person who is framing someone else is the actual perpetrator of the crime. In other cases it is an attempt by law enforcement to get around due process. Motives include getting rid of political dissidents or &quot;correcting&quot; what they see as the court&#x27;s mistake. Some lawbreakers will try to claim they were framed as a defense strategy. Frameups may use conspiracy theories to hide the true crimes of the accused.

==Technique==
===In labor disputes===
Frameups in labor disputes sometimes swing public opinion one way or the other. In Massachusetts, during the 1912 Lawrence Textile Strike, Massachusetts State Police officers acting on a tip discovered dynamite and blamed it on the Industrial Workers of the World union. National media echoed an anti-union message. Later, the police revealed that the dynamite had been wrapped in a magazine addressed to the son of the former mayor. The man had received an unexplained payment from the largest of the employers. Exposed, the plot swung public sympathy to the IWW.

===In police operations===
A frameup where a police officer shoots an unarmed suspect and then places a weapon near the body is a form of police misconduct known as a &quot;throw down&quot;. This is used to justify the shooting by making it appear that the officer fired in self-defence or to defend other bystanders.

==Notable frame-ups==
* Dreyfus affair (around 1900), in which a Jewish soldier of the French Army was framed for treason and sent to Devil&#x27;s Island before being exonerated.

<text>Daemonologie—in full Dæmonologie, In Forme of a Dialogue, Divided into three Books: By the High and Mightie Prince, James &amp;c.—was first published in 1597 by King James VI of Scotland (later also James I of England) as a philosophical dissertation on contemporary necromancy and the historical relationships between the various methods of divination used from ancient black magic. It was reprinted again in 1603 when James took the throne of England. The widespread consensus is that King James wrote &quot;Daemonologie&quot; in response to sceptical publications such as Reginald Scot&#x27;s &quot;The Discoverie of Witchcraft.&quot; 

&quot;Daemonologie&quot; included a study of demonology and the methods demons used to bother troubled men. The book endorses the practice of witch hunting.

This book is believed to be one of the main sources used by William Shakespeare in the production of &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Shakespeare attributed many quotes and rituals found within the book directly to the Weird Sisters, yet also attributed the Scottish themes and settings referenced from the trials in which King James was involved.

==Structure==
King James wrote a dissertation titled &quot;Daemonologie&quot; that was first sold in 1597, several years prior to the first publication of the King James Authorized Version of the Bible. Within three short books James wrote a philosophical dissertation in the form of a Socratic dialogue for the purpose of making arguments and comparisons between magic, sorcery and witchcraft, but wrote also his classification of demons.

In writing the book, King James was heavily influenced by his personal involvement in the North Berwick witch trials from 1590. Following the execution of an alleged sorcerer in the year 1591, the news of the trials was narrated in a news pamphlet titled &quot;Newes from Scotland&quot; and was included as the final chapter of the text. The book endorses the practice of witch hunting in a Christian society. King James may also have been prompted to write the &quot;Daemonologie&quot; by an anonymous critical pamphlet &quot;John Upaland&quot; which circulated in 1597 and alleged the Scottish court was bewitched.

James begins the book: The feaefull aboundinge at this time in this countrie, of these detestable slaves of the Devil, the Witches or enchanters, hath moved me (beloved reader) to dispatch in post, this following treatise of mine (...) to resolve the doubting (...) both that such assaults of Satan are most certainly practised, and that the instrument thereof merits most severely to be punished.

As detailed in his preface, the main sources of this work were that of historically confessed witches, judicial case history and the Bible itself. He also amassed various dissertations on magical studies to expand his education on the relationships between infernal spirits and men. James generally sought to prove that the devilish arts have always been yet still are, but also explains the justification of a witch trial and the punishments which a practitioner of the dark arts merits.

He also reasons scholastically what kinds of things are possible in the performance of these arts, and the natural causes of the Devil&#x27;s power with the use of philosophical reasoning. King James sought to prove the existence of witchcraft to other Christians through biblical teachings. His work is separated into three books based on the different arguments the philosophers discuss, with citations of biblical scripture throughout the text.

===Character===
This work reads as a political and theological dissertation in the form of a philosophical dialogue between the characters Philomathes and Epistemon who debate the various topics of magic, sorcery, witchcraft and demonology. The purpose seems to be an educational piece on the study of witchcraft and to inform the public about the histories and etymologies of all subcategories involved in magical practices. The work also serves to make formal accusations against the practice of witchcraft and comparatively elaborates James&#x27; views against papistry.

In the preface, King James states that he chose to write the content in the form of a dialogue to better entertain the reader. By doing so, he follows the method of many philosophical writers prior to his time. As the main plot, Philomathes hears news in the kingdom regarding the rumors of witchcraft which seems all miraculous and amazing but could find no one knowledgeable on the matter to have a serious political discussion on the issue. He finds a philosopher named Epistemon who is very knowledgeable on the topics of theology.

===Book One===
The argument of the first book is on the following topics regarding the description of magic:
* The division of the various magical arts with a comparison between necromancy and witchcraft
* The use of charms, circles, and conjurations
* The division of astrology
* The Devil&#x27;s contract with man
* Comparisons between the miracles of God and the devil
* The purpose of these practices is to advise people

===Book Two===
The main argument of the second book is based on the following topics regarding the description of sorcery and witchcraft:
* The difference between biblical proof and imagination or myth
* A description of sorcery and its comparison with witchcraft
* The path of a sorcerer&#x27;s apprenticeship
* Curses and the roles of Satan
* The appearance of devils; the times and forms which they appear
* The division of witch actions
* Methods of transportation and the illusions of Satan

===Book Three===
The third book is the conclusion of the whole dialogue. James says that demons are under the direct supervision of God and are unable to act without God&#x27;s permission, and he shows how God uses demonic forces as a &quot;Rod of Correction&quot; when men stray from His will. Demons may also be commissioned by witches or magicians to conduct acts of ill will against others. He quotes previous authors who state that each devil has the ability to appear in diverse shapes or forms for varying purposes. Ultimately the works of demons (despite their attempts to do otherwise) will end in the further glorification of God .

James provides a description of all of the kinds of spirits and specters that trouble men or women. His classification of demons is not based on separate demonic entities with their names, ranks, or titles. Instead, demonic entities are categorized according to the methods that they use to inflict mischief or torment on a living individual or a deceased corpse. The four categories of demonic entities, based on their methods, are:
* Spectra: spirits that trouble houses or solitary places
* Obsession: spirits that trouble people at various times of the day, such as incubi and succubae
* Possession: spirits that enter inwardly into a person to trouble them
* Faries: illusionary spirits that prophesy, consort, and transport their servants

===&quot;Newes from Scotland&quot;===
Newes from Scotland – declaring the damnable life and death of Dr. Fian, a notable sorcerer is a pamphlet originally printed in London in 1591 that details the infamous North Berwick witch trials in Scotland and the confessions given before the King.

The initial and subsequent publications of &quot;Daemonologie&quot; included a previously published news pamphlet detailing the accounts of the North Berwick witch trials that involved King James himself as he acted as judge over the proceedings. The deputy bailiff to the kingdom of Scotland, David Seaton, had a servant named Geillis Duncan who, within a short period of time, was found to have miraculously helped any who were troubled or grieved with sickness or infirmity.

David Seaton examined her as a witch and obtained a confession that caused the apprehension of several others later declared to be notorious witches. Agnis Tompson confessed before King James to have attempted his assassination using witchcraft on more than one occasion. The pamphlet details how she attempted these. She also confessed to participating in a sabbat during All Hallows&#x27; Eve where she and others sacrificed a cat and sent it into the sea as they chanted in hopes of summoning a tempest to sink a fleet of ships accompanying James as he was arriving in the port of Leith from a trip to Norway. One ship was sunk from the storm containing gifts meant for the Queen of Scotland but the others including the ship transporting King James were unharmed.

Doctor Fian was deemed a notable sorcerer and was among many others that were put on trial. The pamphlet details their reasons for conducting sorcery, the methods used, how each of the witches were apprehended and the torture methods used in their punishments and death. The case of Doctor Fian follows his compact with Satan, a conflict he had with another witch who sabotaged an enchantment meant for her daughter, his examinations during the trial, the torture he endured, his escape and subsequent execution.

==Cultural significance==
It has been noted that the themes taken from &quot;Daemonologie&quot; and King James&#x27; involvement in the North Berwick witch trials may have directly contributed to Shakespeare&#x27;s work &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Evidence of this exists in the three witches&#x27; use of ritual magic and direct quotes that directly relate to the testimony given from the witch trials described in the &quot;Newes of Scotland&quot; pamphlet. &quot;Macbeth&quot; had come into public enjoyment a few years after the publication of &quot;Daemonologie&quot; and retains many of the same Scottish themes and settings.

&quot;Daemonologie&quot; assisted in the creation of witchcraft reform, heavily inspiring Richard Bernard in writing a manual on witch-finding in 1629 titled &quot;A Guide to Grand-Jury Men&quot;, which advised judicial trial procedure to take a stronger investigative approach to acquiring and analyzing evidence and obtaining witnesses to be present during witch-craft trials. There was also an influence on Matthew Hopkins in his work as a witch-finder between 1644 and 1646 in which an estimated 300 witches were tried and executed. In the year of Hopkins&#x27; death, 1647, he published &quot;The Discovery of Witches&quot; which directly cited &quot;Daemonologie&quot; as a source for creating methods in discovering a witch.

The philosophical arguments King James poses through the character Epistemon are based on concepts of theological reasoning regarding society&#x27;s belief as his opponent, Philomathes, takes a philosophical stance on society&#x27;s legal aspects but sought to obtain the knowledge of Epistemon. This philosophical approach signified as a philomath seeking to obtain greater knowledge through epistemology, a term that was later coined by James Frederick Ferrier in 1854.

<text>Jean Meeus (born 12 December 1928) is a Belgian meteorologist and amateur astronomer specializing in celestial mechanics, spherical astronomy, and mathematical astronomy.

Meeus studied mathematics at the University of Leuven in Belgium, where he received the Degree of Licentiate in 1953. From then until his retirement in 1993, he was a meteorologist at Brussels Airport.

== Awards and honors ==

In 1986, he won the Amateur Achievement Award of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. The main belt asteroid 2213 Meeus was named after him by the International Astronomical Union in 1981 for his contributions to the field.

<text>Unrest was an indie rock band from the Washington, D.C., area. It was one of Mark Robinson&#x27;s projects for what would eventually become the TeenBeat label, also created by Robinson while in high school. Developing from an experimental approach of never playing the same song twice, earlier material seemed to be influenced by everything from punk to funk to Ennio Morricone. Original members Robinson (guitar) and drummer Philip Krauth were joined by Bridget Cross on bass in 1990 and their sound evolved into a minimalist but lively kind of pop. The two full-length albums released with this line up, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Imperial f.f.r.r.&quot; and 1993&#x27;s &quot;Perfect Teeth&quot; (distributed by the influential British label 4AD Records) featured pop songs interspersed with avant-garde percussive and sonic tracks, sometimes featuring nothing but white noise, beeps or sirens. EPs released around the same time period reveal a more pronounced gap between pop and experimental elements. The group broke up in 1994 with Krauth pursuing a solo career and Robinson and Cross continued for a time as Air Miami, which released two singles and one album, &quot;me me me&quot;. Since Air Miami&#x27;s demise in the mid &#x27;90s, Robinson has continued to release various solo projects, as well as albums with his bands Cotton Candy and Flin Flon, and continues to run the TeenBeat label as well.

On February 24, 2005, Unrest played a one-time reunion show at Washington&#x27;s Black Cat club as a part of the TeenBeat Records 20th anniversary celebration. Also appearing were Eggs, +/-, True Love Always, The Fontaine Toups, and Jonny Cohen.

On April 22, 2008, Teenbeat released an album by Cross under the alias &quot;Maybe It&#x27;s Reno&quot;. The self-titled album features Robinson and Krauth on the first seven tracks, almost equating this project to another reunion of Unrest, though this time, all of the songs are written by Cross and she also performs all of the vocals.

Unrest reunited again for a small east coast tour in July 2010.

<doc id="726366" wikidata="Q434224" url="?curid=726366" title="Bart Bok">
<text>Bartholomeus Jan &quot;Bart&quot; Bok (April 28, 1906 – August 5, 1983) was a Dutch-American astronomer, teacher, and lecturer. He is best known for his work on the structure and evolution of the Milky Way galaxy, and for the discovery of Bok globules, which are small, densely dark clouds of interstellar gas and dust that can be seen silhouetted against brighter backgrounds. Bok suggested that these globules may be in the process of contracting, before forming into stars.

Bok married fellow astronomer Priscilla Fairfield in 1929, and for the remainder of their lives, the two collaborated so closely on their astronomical work that the Royal Astronomical Society said &quot;from that point on it is difficult and pointless to separate his achievements from hers&quot;. The Boks displayed such great mutual enthusiasm for explaining astronomy to the public that &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; described them in 1936 as &quot;salesmen of the Milky Way&quot;. They worked together on research and co-authored academic papers, and their general interest book &quot;The Milky Way&quot; went through five editions and was &quot;widely acclaimed as one of the most successful astronomical books ever published&quot;.

Bok&#x27;s primary research interest was the structure of our galaxy. When he was asked by the editors of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in America&quot; to submit a statement concerning &quot;Thoughts on My Life&quot;, he wrote, &quot;I have been a happy astronomer for the past sixty years, wandering through the highways and byways of our beautiful Milky Way.&quot;

Bart Bok was an exceedingly popular personality in the field of astronomy, noted for his affability and humor. When asteroid 1983 Bok was named for him and his wife Priscilla, he thanked the International Astronomical Union for giving him &quot;a little plot of land that I can retire to and live on.&quot;

==Early life and studies 1906–1929==

Bok was born in the small Dutch town of Hoorn, north of Amsterdam, to Jan Bok, who was a sergeant-major in the Dutch army, and Gesina Annetta (née van der Lee) Bok, but he spent a good deal of his childhood with his grandparents in the town of Haarlem, where he attended primary school. He attended high school in The Hague, excelling at mathematics and science, and he also told the story that this was where he met a Scoutmaster who introduced him to the night sky while on camping trips away from the city lights. After completing high school, he went on to study astronomy at Leiden and Groningen Universities.

In 1928, he attended the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Third General Assembly in Leiden in the Netherlands. Priscilla Fairfield was an associate professor in Astronomy, and the young Bart Bok was assigned to her reception committee. He was a graduate student ten years her junior, but he fell in love and proposed to her at the end of the conference. Priscilla did not accept his proposal at the time, and Bart corresponded with her for the next year before she finally agreed.

The following year, Bok broke off his thesis studies at Groningen with Piet van Rhijn and moved across the Atlantic to Cambridge, Massachusetts, on the invitation of Harlow Shapley, director of Harvard College Observatory, whom he had also met at the same IAU Assembly where he met Priscilla. On September 9, 1929, two days after moving to the US, the two were married. This caused some awkwardness with their mutual superior Shapley, who regarded Priscilla as something of a protégée and was protective of her. While Bok had the greatest admiration for Shapley, it took Shapley time to build the required level of trust with Bok.

==Harvard 1929–1957==
The Boks remained at Harvard University for almost thirty years, from 1929 until 1957, where he taught astronomy and directed the Harvard Observatory. Bart was steadily promoted through the academic ranks: he completed his Doctoral dissertation entitled &quot;A Study of the Eta Carinae Region&quot; in 1932, became an assistant professor in 1933, an associate professor in 1939, associate director of the Harvard Observatory by 1946, and he became a full professor in 1947 when he was appointed to the Robert Wheeler Wilson Chair in Astronomy (some sources say this happened in 1945). Meanwhile, Priscilla was also conducting her own research and writing with Bart, but she was not being paid, which prompted Bart to describe Shapley as &quot;rather cheap when it came to hiring people&quot;.

The Boks had two children: a son, John Fairfield, in 1930 and a daughter, Joyce Annetta (now Mrs John Ambruster), in 1933. Priscilla stayed at home until the children finished high school, so she published less research herself in this period. Nevertheless, she was consistently involved with supporting Bart&#x27;s research and their public outreach activities often put them together and gave her some degree of recognition. When Bart became a naturalized US citizen in 1938, he shortened his first name to &quot;Bart&quot;.

Their marriage began a close scientific collaboration that would span the next four decades, in which the Royal Astronomical Society said &quot;it is difficult and pointless to separate his achievements from hers&quot;. They co-authored a number of academic papers on star clusters, stellar magnitudes, and the structure of the Milky Way. Bok was fiercely interested in the mechanical processes which form star clusters and galaxies, and his paper &quot;The Apparent Clustering of External Galaxies&quot; (&quot;Nature&quot;, vol. 133, p. 578) was the first to demonstrate how dissipation of a star cluster relates to its density, and so by examining the clusters in our galaxy he concluded that it cannot be older than about twenty billion years.

Their enthusiasm for explaining astronomy to the public led to them being well known: they were described as &quot;salesmen of the Milky Way&quot; by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; in 1936. Their main work together was a definitive undergraduate textbook and popular science book, &quot;The Milky Way&quot;, &quot;widely acclaimed as one of the most successful astronomical books ever published&quot;, which had five editions over forty years following its initial publication in 1941, and was translated into many languages. The writing of this book, begun in 1937, was shared equally – according to Bart:


In the 1940s, Bok first observed small, dark clouds of dense cosmic dust and gas which would later become known as &quot;Bok globules&quot; in the Milky Way. In a paper published in 1947, Bok and E.F. Reilly hypothesized that these clouds were &quot;similar to insect&#x27;s cocoons&quot; that were undergoing gravitational collapse to form new stars and star clusters. This hypothesis was difficult to verify due to the observational difficulties of establishing what was happening inside a dense dark cloud that obscured all visible light emitted from within it, but after Bok&#x27;s death his ideas were confirmed when analyses of near infrared observations published in 1990 confirmed that stars were being born inside Bok globules.

The Bok family also traveled to spend time setting up two international facilities on opposite sides of the world. During 1941, Bok helped to set up the Tonantzintla Observatory in Tonantzintla, Mexico. In 1950, he set up the Schmidt Telescope at Harvard&#x27;s Boyden Station in South Africa. While there, he and Priscilla also enjoyed the opportunity to study the southern stars, including &quot;Eta Carinae&quot; which had been the subject of Bart&#x27;s doctoral dissertation.

Bok&#x27;s record of success in setting up new observatories would guide the rest of his career. Starting in 1952 he led the efforts to fund and construct a major radio telescope facility at Harvard&#x27;s Oak Ridge Observatory. Unusually for his time, Bok believed that the combination of radio and optical astronomy could produce exceptional benefits. Initially, this was inspired by the difficulty and unreliability of visual star counting techniques, especially when there is obscuring dust. This combined approach proved to be vital in analyzing the interstellar medium, and particularly in developing an understanding of what was happening inside Bok Globules.

==Australia 1957–1966==

In 1957, the Boks moved to Australia, where Bart took up the position of Director at Mount Stromlo Observatory in the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, which he was to hold for the next nine years. His presence was a crucial factor in the development of optical astronomy in Australia, and its integration with the well-established field of radio astronomy. During his tenure, Bok established a thriving international graduate program at Stromlo which became known as &quot;Harvard in the South&quot;, obtained funds from the Prime Minister of the time, Robert Menzies, for a new telescope at Stromlo, and established a field observatory at Siding Spring.

He was a pioneer in the use of electronic computers for astronomical observing, and the first person to use them for any purpose at the ANU: in February 1960 he had the first one installed in the observatory. He was also a pioneer in taking advantage of mass media to promote astronomy: he made a television series which was broadcast on the ABC, reaching far more people than any of his predecessors dreamed of and helping to build awareness and support for astronomy in Australia.

By the early 1960s, Mount Stromlo had developed into one of the leading facilities for observational astronomy in the southern hemisphere. However, Bok appreciated the limitations of the site of Mount Stromlo due to weather and increasing light pollution, and he initiated a site-testing program which stretched across the country. In 1962, Siding Spring Mountain was chosen for the creation of a world-class telescope facility. As Siding Spring grew, Bok threw his support behind a new project: what would become Australia&#x27;s largest optical telescope, the Anglo-Australian Telescope.

This did not leave much time for astronomy research; Priscilla spent many nights at the Stromlo telescopes observing and analyzing their data. This suited her greater interest in basic observations such as determining stellar positions and providing calibrated magnitudes. Their close relationship and the way their personalities complemented one another supported their scientific efforts: Priscilla&#x27;s empathy balanced Bart&#x27;s energetic and dynamic nature.
In the subsequent editions of their book, the Boks made major changes to accommodate the rapid progress in galactic astronomy. The approachability of the text for the general public was particularly important to Priscilla, according to Bart:

Bok was a tireless promoter of astronomy to the general public, trying to keep to a routine of devoting three days each month to public lectures:

one in Canberra or near Canberra, one in a capital city, and one in the country ... I accepted almost any invitation I could get to give a lecture ... my price was that if I spoke to [a group of adults] ... I would [also] address the local high school and this paid off amazingly well in a direction that had never occurred to me, because in a high school audience there is generally a nephew or a niece of a Member of Parliament, and all the Members of Parliament learned about it.

This ability to &quot;sell&quot; astronomy to the public and especially to the Members of Parliament was crucial in winning support for such huge, and expensive, projects as the Anglo-Australian Observatory against competing scientific priorities. In the end, he did not get to see it completed; the formal agreement to construct the AAO was reached the year after he and Priscilla left Australia to return to the US.

==Return to the US 1966–1983==

In 1966, the Boks moved back to the US, where Bart took up the roles of Head of the Department of Astronomy at the University of Arizona and Director of Steward Observatory, posts which he held until 1970. He was largely responsible for the construction of the telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, and oversaw a doubling of the university&#x27;s staff and growth in the graduate student program until by 1970 it was ranked fifth in the US, and Steward was regarded as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s premier astronomical research institutions.&quot;

From 1970, when he left his positions at Steward University and the University of Arizona, Bok became more actively involved in national and global organizations for professional astronomers. In 1970, he became vice-president of the executive committee of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), and in 1973 he was appointed for a second three-year term in the same position. Overlapping with this, he also served as president of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) from 1972 to 1974.

Priscilla suffered a stroke in 1972; her health declined in the following years, and Bok resigned his positions with the IAU and the AAS in 1974 and dedicated himself to her care. She died of a heart attack in November 1975.
In 1975 Bok coauthored the statement &quot;Objections to Astrology&quot;, which was endorsed by 186 professional astronomers, astrophysicists, and other scientists, including nineteen winners of the Nobel Prize. The statement was published in The Humanist and copies were sent to every major newspaper in the US. This led to the formation of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (now called the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry), of which he was a founding Fellow. In 2000, Bok was voted by readers of Skeptical Inquirer magazine as one of the &quot;outstanding skeptics of the twentieth century&quot;. At a meeting of the executive council of CSI in Denver, Colorado in April 2011, Bok was selected for inclusion in CSI&#x27;s Pantheon of Skeptics. The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.

Bok continued as an emeritus professor at the University of Arizona, and he participated in or led several groups to view solar eclipses, including a trip to the eclipse near Bratsk in Siberia in July 1981 and his last eclipse trip to what he called his &quot;spiritual home&quot; of Java to view a totality that passed near the town of Salatiga in June 1983.

Bok died of a heart attack at his home in Tucson, Arizona a little more than a month after that final trip. His body was bequeathed to the college of medicine at the University of Arizona.

<text>&lt;noinclude&gt;

Coahuila is a state in Northeast Mexico that is divided into 38 municipalities. According to the 2020 Mexican census, Coahuila is the 15th most populous state with inhabitants and the third largest by land area spanning .

Municipalities in Coahuila are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

The largest municipality by population is the state capital Saltillo, with 879,958 residents, while the smallest is Abasolo with 1,022 residents. The largest municipality by land area in Coahuila and the third largest in Mexico is Ocampo, which spans , and the smallest is Allende which spans . The first municipality to incorporate was Monclova on and the newest municipality is Francisco I. Madero, which incorporated .

Sandage was one of the most influential astronomers of the 20th century. He was born in Iowa City, Iowa, United States. He graduated from the University of Illinois in 1948. In 1953 he received a PhD from the California Institute of Technology; the German-born Wilson Observatory-based astronomer Walter Baade was his advisor. During this time Sandage was a graduate student assistant to cosmologist Edwin Hubble. He continued Hubble&#x27;s research program after Hubble died in 1953.

In 1952 Baade surprised his fellow astronomers by announcing (at the 1952 Conference of the International Astronomical Union, in Rome) his determination of two separate populations of Cepheid variable stars in the Andromeda Galaxy, resulted in a doubling of the estimated age of the universe (from 1.8 to 3.6 billion years). Hubble had posited the earlier value; he had considered only the weaker Population II Cepheid variables as standard candles. After Baade&#x27;s pronouncements, Sandage showed that astronomers&#x27; previous assumption, that the brightest stars in galaxies were of approximately equal inherent intensity, was mistaken in the case of H II regions which he found not to be stars and inherently brighter than the brightest stars in distant galaxies. This resulted in another 1.5-fold increase in the calculated age of the universe, to approximately 5.5 billion years.

Throughout the 1950s and well into the 1980s Sandage was regarded as the pre-eminent observational cosmologist, making contributions to all aspects of the cosmological distance scale, ranging from calibrators within our own Milky Way Galaxy, to cosmologically distant galaxies.

Sandage began working at the Palomar Observatory. In 1958 he published the first good estimate for the Hubble constant, revising Hubble&#x27;s value of 250 down to 75 km/s/Mpc, which is close to today&#x27;s accepted value. Later he became the chief advocate of an even lower value, around 50, corresponding to a Hubble age of around 20 billion years. At the time, many, especially Sandage, believed that the cosmological constant was zero. In such a case, a low Hubble constant is necessary in order for the age of the universe (as opposed to the Hubble age) to be at least as old as the oldest objects it contains, i.e. ca. 14 billion years.

Sandage performed photometric studies of globular clusters, and calculated their age to be at least 25 billion years. This led him to speculate that the universe did not merely expand, but actually expanded and contracted with a period of 80 billion years. The current cosmological estimates of the age of the universe, in contrast, are typically of the order of 14 billion years. As part of his studies concerning the formation of galaxies in the early universe, he co-wrote the paper now referred to as ELS after the authors Olin J. Eggen, Donald Lynden-Bell and Sandage, first describing the collapse of a proto-galactic gas cloud into our present Milky Way Galaxy. He later defended the paper in 1990.

In his 1961 paper &quot;The Ability of the 200-inch Telescope to Discriminate Between Selected World Models,&quot; he suggested that the future of observational cosmology would be the search for two parameters: the Hubble constant H0 and the deceleration parameter q0. This paper influenced observational cosmology for at least three decades as it carefully specified the types of observational tests that could be performed with a large telescope. He also published two atlases of galaxies, in 1961 and 1981, based on the Hubble classification scheme.

In 1962 Sandage studied the possibility of directly measuring the temporal variation of the redshift of extra-galactic sources. This analysis became known as the &quot;Sandage–Loeb test&quot;.

Sandage discovered jets erupting from the core of the so-called Cigar Galaxy. These must have been caused by massive explosions in the core, and they have apparently been occurring for at least 1.5 million years.

Sandage was a prolific researcher; during his career he published more than 500 papers. Until his death he continued to be an active researcher at the Carnegie Observatories, still publishing several papers a year.

==Personal life==
In 1959, Sandage married Mary Connelley, also an astronomer, with whom he had two sons, David and John. In 1983 Sandage announced he had become a Christian and began to write essays on the subject of religion and science. On November 13, 2010, Sandage died of pancreatic cancer at his home in San Gabriel, California. He was 84 years old.

<doc id="726379" wikidata="Q1094882" url="?curid=726379" title="Clam chowder">
<text>Clam chowder is any of several chowder soups in American cuisine containing clams. In addition to clams, common ingredients include diced potatoes, salt pork, and onions. Other vegetables are not typically used. It is believed that clams were used in chowder because of the relative ease of harvesting them. Clam chowder is usually served with saltine crackers or small, hexagonal oyster crackers.

The dish originated in the Northeastern United States, but is now commonly served in restaurants throughout the country. Many regional variations exist, but the three most prevalent are New England or &quot;white&quot; clam chowder, which includes milk or cream, Manhattan or &quot;red&quot; clam chowder, which includes tomatoes, and Rhode Island or &quot;clear&quot; clam chowder, which omits both.

==History==
Early documentation of &quot;clam chowder&quot; as we know it today did not contain milk and was thickened during cooking using crackers or stale bread. The first recipe for Manhattan clam chowder, with tomatoes and no milk, was published before 1919, and the current name was attested in 1934.

==Primary variants and styles==

As recipes for clam chowder spread throughout the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries, many regionally developed variants have arisen.

===Manhattan clam chowder===

Manhattan clam chowder has a red, tomato-based broth and unlike New England clam chowder there is no milk or cream. Manhattan-style chowder also usually contains other vegetables, such as celery and carrots to create a mirepoix. Thyme is often used as a seasoning.

Many sources attribute its creation to Rhode Island&#x27;s Portuguese fishing communities who were known both for their traditional tomato-based stews and for their frequent travels to New York City&#x27;s Fulton Fish Market during the mid-1800s. While Rhode Island clam chowder is clear, it was relatively common in Rhode Island for some cooks to add tomato sauce to their chowder. In Rhode Island this style chowder is also frequently referred to as &quot;Rocky Point Clam Chowder&quot; as it was a popular menu item at the Rocky Point Amusement Park Shore Dinner Hall since the park opened in 1847.

This chowder was at times called by various names including &quot;Clam Chowder – Coney Island Style&quot; (1893). Manhattan clam chowder is included in Victor Hirtzler&#x27;s &quot;Hotel St. Francis Cookbook&quot; (1919) and &quot;The Delmonico Cook Book&quot; (1890) as &quot;clam chowder&quot;. The &quot;Manhattan&quot; name is first attested in a 1934 cookbook.

===New England clam chowder===
New England clam chowder, occasionally referred to as Boston or Boston-style clam chowder, is a milk- or cream-based chowder, and is often of a thicker consistency than other regional styles. It is commonly made with milk, butter, potatoes, salt pork, onion, and clams. Flour or, historically, crushed hard tack may be added as a thickener.

New England clam chowder is usually accompanied by oyster crackers. Crackers may be crushed and mixed into the soup for thickener, or used as a garnish.

===Rhode Island clam chowder===
Rhode Island clam chowder is made with clear broth, and contains no dairy or tomatoes. It is common in southeastern Rhode Island through eastern Connecticut. In Rhode Island, it is sometimes called &quot;South County Style&quot; referring to Washington County, where it apparently originated.

===Long Island clam chowder===
Long Island clam chowder is part New England–style and part Manhattan-style, making it a pinkish creamy tomato clam chowder. The name is intended as humorous: Long Island is between Manhattan and New England. The two parent chowders are typically cooked separately before being poured in the same bowl. This variant is popular in many small restaurants across Suffolk County, New York.

=== Hatteras clam chowder ===
Served throughout North Carolina&#x27;s Outer Banks region, this simple variation of clam chowder has clear broth, bacon, potatoes, and onions. It is usually seasoned with generous amounts of black pepper.

=== Minorcan clam chowder ===
Minorcan clam chowder is a spicy traditional version found in restaurants in northeastern Florida, particularly in St. Augustine. It has a tomato broth base, and includes Spanish datil pepper, an extremely hot chili comparable to the habanero.

===Ships===
Shipbuilding was the founding activity of Ishikawajima in 1853. It remains part of IHI&#x27;s business activities, although it has been diluted through several mergers with other Japanese shipbuilding companies.

In 1960, Ishikawajima Heavy Industries merged with Harima Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company to establish the Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI).
In 1995, Marine United was established jointly with Sumitomo Heavy Industries. 
In 2013, IHI Marine United was merged with Universal Shipbuilding Corporation owned by the steel company JFE Holdings in order to newly establish a larger firm, Japan Marine United Corporation (JMU), of which IHI remained a shareholder.

In March 2020, Japan Marine United (with 49% of shares) agreed to merge with Imabari Shipbuilding (with 51% of shares) into a joint venture named Nihon Shipyard (NSY), covering all ship types except Liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers. This agreement became effective in January 2021.
In parallel with the creation of Nihon Shipyard, Imabari Shipbuilding bought 30% of JMU&#x27;s shares, while IHI and JFE Holdings each kept 35% of JMU&#x27;s capital. 
The merger between these two Japanese companies resulted in Nihon Shipyard becoming one of the largest marine-engineering and shipbuilding companies in the world, of which IHI remains a shareholder.

<text>Mercury-Atlas 10 (MA-10) was a cancelled early crewed space mission, which would have been the last flight in NASA&#x27;s Mercury program. It was planned as a three-day extended mission, to launch in late 1963; the spacecraft, Freedom 7-II, would have been flown by Alan Shepard, a veteran of the suborbital Mercury-Redstone 3 mission in 1961. However, it was cancelled after the success of the one-day Mercury-Atlas 9 mission in May 1963, to allow NASA to focus its efforts on the more advanced two-man Gemini program.

==Planning==

Scheduling for the MA-10 mission began as early as mid-1961, before a single orbital flight had been flown. It was planned as a one-day orbital mission, using Spacecraft #15 and Atlas booster 144D. The - by now heavily modified - spacecraft #15A was delivered to Cape Canaveral on 16 November 1962, renumbered #15B in January 1963, and prepared for use as a backup spacecraft for MA-9; by this stage, NASA was noncommittal about whether or not a fifth orbital flight would be flown.

Shortly after the Mercury-Atlas 8 flight in October 1962, some commentators speculated on the possibility of MA-10 being flown as a &quot;dual mission&quot;. In this approach, MA-10 and a new MA-11 flight, the latter using the MA-10 backup capsule, would be launched in close proximity, and fly a loosely co-ordinated mission, similar to the Soviet Vostok 3 and Vostok 4.

While in late 1962 the MA-10 mission had still been planned as a nominal one-day flight, as of early 1963, the tentative plan for the MA-10 mission anticipated it being around three days long. The mission was to be flown by Alan Shepard, the backup pilot for MA-9, then in preparation, and previously the pilot of the Mercury-Redstone 3 suborbital mission in 1961. In a nod to his earlier spacecraft, Shepard named #15B &quot;Freedom 7-II&quot;.

The mission would have carried a re-entry communications experiment, which involved injecting water into the plasma sheath surrounding the spacecraft on reentry, in the hope that it would disrupt the sheath enough to allow radio communications; this was later flown on Gemini 3.

The backup astronaut for Shepard is unclear, but most likely would have been Gordon Cooper, as he was the only other astronaut who had not left the program entirely by mid-1963 or had moved to Gemini.

==Cancellation==

By April, NASA had begun referring to MA-9 as the &quot;culmination&quot; of the program, and on 11 May NASA declared publicly that it was &quot;absolutely beyond question&quot; that a successful MA-9 flight would mean no MA-10. During the MA-9 postflight press conference on 19 May, Robert C. Seamans was asked about the possibility of a fifth orbital flight, and described it as &quot;quite unlikely&quot;. President John F. Kennedy, when asked a similar question three days later, demurred, saying that the decision was one for NASA to make.

A meeting on 6 and 7 June debated carrying on to the MA-10 flight - or possibly beyond. The main argument put forward was that it would gain usable information for the Gemini and Apollo missions without needing a great deal of investment; the spacecraft and launch vehicles were available and almost ready for flight. Pressure had come from a more directly involved constituency as well; both NASA officials and the President himself had been lobbied by the &quot;Mercury Seven&quot; astronauts for a seventh Mercury mission.

Work continued on modifying Spacecraft #15B until 8 June, but on 12 June, the NASA Administrator, James E. Webb, stated publicly to the Senate Space Committee that there would be no further Mercury flights. All work ceased on the program, with personnel and resources reassigned to the Gemini and Apollo programs.

By the summer of 1963, it was obvious that continuing Mercury would sap resources needed for Gemini and Apollo. Despite the ambitious experiments planned for later Mercury missions, they would have run up against the tight payload capacity limits of the capsule and Atlas vehicle. The consumables needed for a three-day Mercury flight alone would have added 100 pounds (136 kilograms) of additional weight. In addition, the large number of malfunctions that occurred on Faith 7&#x27;s flight drove home the fact that Mercury&#x27;s hardware wasn&#x27;t robust enough to stand a day-long mission, let alone multi-day. NASA officials disliked the lengthy gap between crewed missions that would result from this decision, and the first crewed Gemini mission ended up taking place in March 1965, twenty-two months after the end of Mercury and an even longer amount of time than originally expected.

Four Atlas boosters and Mercury capsules were in a state of partial completion when Mercury was cancelled. Although there was talk of using the leftover Atlases to launch Agena target vehicles for Gemini, the program&#x27;s funding was eventually increased enough that NASA could afford to buy brand-new Atlases using the newer SLV-3 core.

The capsule was placed in storage, then later displayed at the Ames Research Center in California; it is now on display at the Smithsonian&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.
