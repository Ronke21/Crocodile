<text>George Walker Crawford (December 22, 1798 – July 27, 1872) was a licensed attorney turned politician from Columbia County, Georgia. Crawford was appointed attorney general for the state in 1827, by Governor John Forsyth, serving in that capacity until 1831. Crawford also served five years in the General Assembly&#x27;s lower house as a representative of Richmond County on a platform of states&#x27; rights.

George Crawford served in the U.S. House of Representatives, filling the seat vacated by Richard W. Habersham who died while in office. Crawford was elected Georgia&#x27;s 38th governor – serving two terms from 1843 to 1847. He became the only Whig Party candidate in state history to occupy the Governor&#x27;s Mansion. Crawford then served as United States Secretary of War from 1849 to 1850.

Crawford&#x27;s time in President Zachary Taylor&#x27;s cabinet was marred by speculation regarding a probate claim he settled for George Galphin&#x27;s heirs. Crawford received a gratuity of substantial remuneration for his services&#x27; – Crawford&#x27;s political adversaries framed it as the Galphin Affair – marking the end of Crawford&#x27;s political aspirations. When President Taylor unexpectedly died while in office, Crawford resigned his position as Secretary of War and entered political retirement.

In 1861, however, Crawford was elected a delegate from Richmond County to the state&#x27;s Secession Convention which brought him out of retirement to answer the call of his constituents. By the convention&#x27;s first order of business, Crawford was elected Permanent President of the Convention by which he presided over Georgia&#x27;s decision to secede from the Union and join the Confederate States of America.

==Early life==
George Walker Crawford was born on December 22, 1798, in Columbia County, Georgia. He was the fourth son of Peter and Mary Ann Crawford. His father was a veteran of the American Revolutionary War from Virginia who had settled in Georgia to claim a land share, known as a bounty grant, which the state of Georgia had set aside for &quot;those who had fought for independence&quot;.

Peter Crawford acquired a sizable tract of land that he called Belair Plantation. The homestead was situated close to his uncle, Joel Crawford. Peter&#x27;s uncle Joel fathered William H. Crawford, soon becoming a politician renowned locally for his political service to the state and for two presidential bids – running in 1816, and then again in 1824.

George Crawford grew up on the family&#x27;s estate, heavily influenced by his father, and his cousin William as well. George&#x27;s father was a practicing attorney and George availed himself to the well-stocked personal library of his father while homeschooling his education. Peter Crawford also entered Georgia politics himself – beginning as Columbia County&#x27;s first &quot;clerk of courts&quot; and becoming a 10-term representative in the state legislature. George Crawford&#x27;s cousin, William H. Crawford, was also becoming well known for his political service, and was the subject of local legend for two famous duels he had been a principal of.

George Crawford built on his homeschooling at the College of New Jersey&#x27;s school of law (later becoming Princeton University). Crawford graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1820, and subsequently completed an internship under the tutelage of Richard Henry Wilde. Crawford was licensed to practice law in 1822, and started a legal practice in Augusta partnering with Henry H. Cumming. He went on to obtain a master&#x27;s degree from the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, the founding college of the University of Georgia. After graduating Franklin, Crawford served from 1824 to 1825, as a second lieutenant in the 10th Regiment of the Georgia Militia.

In 1826, George Crawford married Mary Ann MacIntosh, having four children of the marriage: William Peter, Sarah MacIntosh, Anna Elizabeth, and Charles. George W. Crawford embarked on his political career the following year, accepting a gubernatorial appointment to become Georgia&#x27;s attorney general.

==Attorney General of Georgia==
Governor John Forsyth appointed Crawford to succeed Thomas F. Wells as Georgia&#x27;s attorney general in 1827. The following year, Crawford challenged Georgia state legislator Thomas E. Burnside, Ambrose Burnside&#x27;s uncle, to a duel over published defamation Burnside had written about Crawford&#x27;s father.

===The code duello===
When George Crawford read the anonymous letter to the editor published in &quot;The Augusta Chronicle&quot; he was incensed by the prose – sharply criticizing the political views of his father, then declining in health. Crawford regarded it as an attack on his father&#x27;s good name. Crawford demanded the newspaper editor give him the author&#x27;s name but the editor refused, protecting Burnside&#x27;s identity by telling Crawford the letter was from a woman, and that for this reason, he would not release the person&#x27;s name.

Inexplicably, Burnside contacted Crawford telling him that he was the author. Crawford immediately challenged Burnside to a duel which Burnside accepted, although with reluctance. The code duello was waning in vogue but it was still held as a measure which an honorable man was obliged to endure. Burnside was aspiring his own political career which showed promise of upward mobility. Burnside felt he would be shamed with dishonor if he refused, and in his era, without honor there was no career in politics.

Dueling had already been outlawed in Georgia so the two belligerents, with their seconds, traveled together by train to Fort Mitchell, Alabama where the practice was still legal – to finish what by then had become a &quot;well-publicized fight&quot;. Burnside seemed to have sensed the duel would not end in his favor, dispatching a letter to his wife on the eve of the fateful encounter:Fort Mitchell, Jan. 24, 1828Dear Wife and Mother:    Tomorrow I fight. I do it on principle. Whatever may be my fate, I believe I am right. On this ground I have acted and will act. I believe I shall succeed, but if I do not I am prepared for consequences. Kiss the children and tell them that if I fall my last thought was of them. Yours most affectionatelyThomas E. Burnside

Crawford shot Burnside dead in the infamous duel, prompting the state to pass new legislation; &quot;forbidding persons involved in duels from holding office&quot;. The restriction only applied to duels fought after the law was enacted and did not affect Crawford&#x27;s career. He continued serving as attorney general until 1831, when he was succeeded by Charles J. Jenkins.

Thomas E. Burnside was interred in the private burial ground of Colonel John Crowell, renowned for his participation in the War of 1812. The Colonel lived near the site where the duel had taken place and personally ensured every protocol of respect was accorded at Burnside&#x27;s burial. Two weeks passed before Mrs. Burnside received word of her husband&#x27;s demise. It was said that she nearly died herself from distraught upon receiving the news.

She moved with her children to Dahlonega, Georgia, residing there until her death. Crawford carried regret for his role in what was called &quot;a deplorable and unfortunate affair&quot;. He was known to have made anonymous financial contributions to Burnside&#x27;s widow and children though he was remembered as saying it made no amends – and for having expressed lament shortly before his own death in 1872.

==Congressman==
In 1837, Crawford was elected to the Georgia General Assembly as a member of the House of Representatives for Richmond County. There, Crawford distinguished himself as a fiscal conservative. He was elevated to the United States House of Representatives as a Whig to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Richard W. Habersham. His term there was short, only serving from January 7 to March 3, 1843.

==Governor of Georgia==
George W. Crawford was the Whig Party&#x27;s nominee for governor in 1843. Crawford defeated the Democratic nominee, Mark Anthony Cooper, by a vote of 38,813 to 35,325 succeeding Charles J. McDonald to become the first Whig candidate to serve as Georgia&#x27;s governor (as of 2019, he remains the only Whig governor). The Whigs won a majority in both houses of the state legislature in 1843, as well. Crawford was reelected in 1845, defeating Democratic challenger Matthew H. McAllister by a margin of 1,751 votes.

With the legislature&#x27;s support, Crawford was able to effect the Whig&#x27;s agenda which focused on debt reduction and fiscal restraint. Crawford&#x27;s administration was able to reduce expenditures more than $66,000 in its first year and nearly eliminate the state&#x27;s debt of $500,000 before being succeeded by George W. Towns. Besides implementing sound budget policy, Crawford was able to expand educational opportunities in the state and hasten construction of the state-owned Western and Atlantic Railroad.

Crawford&#x27;s administration established the Supreme Court of Georgia as well, which had failed to be institutionalized for decades of previous effort. He redrew the state&#x27;s congressional maps, and reformed the state penitentiary – making it &quot;a more economically sound institution&quot;. Crawford also succeeded at dismantling the Georgia Central Bank, an important Whig campaign endeavor for years.

==Secretary of War==
When General Zachary Taylor became President of the United States in 1849, he appointed Crawford United States Secretary of War. As War Secretary, he was involved in settling a claim from the United States government for the Galphin family, descendants of George Galphin, an American businessman who specialized in Indian Trade. Crawford received a large payment for his services and several of his political foes seized upon the opportunity to suggest impropriety.

Crawford was subsequently investigated by a commission and completely exonerated of any wrongdoing yet his critics continued casting aspersions. When Millard Fillmore became president after Taylor&#x27;s sudden death while in office in 1850, Crawford resigned along with the rest of the Taylor administration, rather than work for Millard Fillmore.

==Georgia Secession Convention==

In 1861, Crawford was elected as a delegate from Richmond County, Georgia to the state&#x27;s Secession Convention. The delegation elected Crawford president of the convention by a unanimous vote and he oversaw the state&#x27;s vote of secession. As the convention&#x27;s president, Crawford is considered the author of Georgia&#x27;s Ordinance of Secession, the official document announcing the state&#x27;s formal intent to secede the federal Union – originally as an independent republic, ultimately to join the Confederate States of America.

The delegation approved the ordinance January 19, 1861, with 208 voting in favor of secession and 89 opposed. The delegates signed the document in celebratory fashion two days later in the public square in front of the statehouse in Milledgeville where the convention was assembled. Crawford survived to witness the consequences of enacting the ordinance, lamenting its cost in the shed blood of Georgia citizens rallied by the convention&#x27;s call.

Crawford was to be tried for inciting a rebellion due to his role in presiding over the state&#x27;s secession and was excluded from eligibility for both Lincoln&#x27;s and Johnson&#x27;s amnesty proclamations because of his leadership status. Crawford escaped the harsh consequences of an adjudication of guilt in 1865, when Johnson approved his direct application for amnesty thereby restoring Crawford as a citizen of the United States in good stead – with full protection of his person and property against all forms of reprisal.

==Death and legacy==
Crawford died on July 27, 1872, at his Belair estate, located near Augusta, Georgia. His funeral was held in St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church and he was buried in Summerville Cemetery located in Augusta.

On November 16, 1943, the keel was laid for the &quot;SS George Walker Crawford&quot;, a liberty ship built by the J.A. Jones Construction Company in Brunswick, Georgia honoring Crawford for his service to the state of Georgia. The ship was launched January 1, 1944, and delivered into federal service January 13, 1944.

Crawford&#x27;s biographer Len Cleveland said that in researching his material he observed that &quot;Crawford&#x27;s entire political career was motivated by a traditional sense of duty rather than by deep political convictions&quot;. Robert Toombs spoke well of Crawford, Saying, &quot;There are but few abler and no purer men in America, and he has administrative qualities of an unusually high order.&quot;

<doc id="739588" wikidata="Q2497134" url="?curid=739588" title="Adaptive system">
<text>An adaptive system is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole that together are able to respond to environmental changes or changes in the interacting parts, in a way analogous to either continuous physiological homeostasis or evolutionary adaptation in biology. Feedback loops represent a key feature of adaptive systems, such as ecosystems and individual organisms; or in the human world, communities, organizations, and families. Adaptive systems can be organized into a hierarchy.

Artificial adaptive systems include robots with control systems that utilize negative feedback to maintain desired states.

==The law of adaptation==

The law of adaptation may be stated informally as: 
Formally, the law can be defined as follows:

Given a system formula_1, we say that a physical event formula_2 is a stimulus for the system formula_1 if and only if the probability formula_4 that the system suffers a change or be perturbed (in its elements or in its processes) when the event formula_2 occurs is strictly greater than the prior probability that formula_1 suffers a change independently of formula_2:

:formula_8

&quot;Let formula_1 be an arbitrary system subject to changes in time formula_10 and let formula_2 be an arbitrary event that is a stimulus for the system formula_1: we say that formula_1 is an adaptive system if and only if when t tends to infinity formula_14 the probability that the system formula_1 change its behavior formula_16 in a time step formula_17 given the event formula_2 is equal to the probability that the system change its behavior independently of the occurrence of the event formula_2. In mathematical terms:&quot;

#- formula_20
#- formula_21

Thus, for each instant formula_10 will exist a temporal interval formula_23 such that:

:formula_24

==Benefit of self-adjusting systems==
In an adaptive system, a parameter changes slowly and has no preferred value. In a self-adjusting system though, the parameter value “depends on the history of the system dynamics”. One of the most important qualities of &quot;self-adjusting systems&quot; is its “adaptation to the edge of chaos” or ability to avoid chaos. Practically speaking, by heading to the edge of chaos without going further, a leader may act spontaneously yet without disaster. A March/April 2009 Complexity article further explains the self-adjusting systems used and the realistic implications. Physicists have shown that adaptation to the edge of chaos occurs in almost all systems with feedback.

<text>Sir Edward Shepherd Creasy (12 September 1812 – 17 January 1878) was an English historian and jurist.

==Life==
The son of a land agent, he was born in Bexley, Kent, England, and educated at Eton College (where he won the Newcastle Scholarship in 1831) and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He was called to the Bar in 1837 and appointed assistant judge at the Westminster sessions court.

In 1840, he began teaching history at the University of London and wrote a number of historical books including &quot;The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World&quot; (1851).

Creasy was knighted in 1860 and spent the next decade and a half in Ceylon as Chief Justice of Ceylon (1860 to 1875). He then returned in poor health to England and died in London on 17 January 1878.

While in Ceylon, he served as president of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society from 1861 to 1864. In July, 1864 Creasy founded the Colombo Rowing Club.

==Works==
Creasy&#x27;s best known contribution to literature is his &quot;Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World&quot; (1851). The reason that Creasy gives for the significance of many of the fifteen battles is that they denied Eastern peoples access to European soil. Other battles are seen as &quot;decisive&quot; because they shaped the development of Britain, which was the world&#x27;s leading power at the time of writing.

Other works are:
* &quot;Biographies of Eminent Etonians&quot; (1850) (several editions)
* &quot;Historical and Critical Account of the Several Invasions of England&quot; (1852);
* &quot;History of the Ottoman Turks, from the Beginning of Their Empire to the Present Time&quot; (1854)
* &quot;The Rise and Progress of the English Constitution&quot; (1855) (17th ed. 1886)
* &quot;History of England from the Earliest to the Present Time&quot; (5 vols.), 1869–70
* &quot;Imperial and Colonial Institutions of the Britannic Empire, Including Indian Institutions&quot; (1872)

&quot;Old Love and the New&quot; (1870) was a novel. With John Sheehan and Robert Gordon Latham, Creasy took part in contributing to &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;, the political squibs in verse known as the &quot;Tipperary Papers&quot;.

<doc id="739601" wikidata="Q1056224" url="?curid=739601" title="Part III of the Mathematical Tripos">
<text>Part III of the Mathematical Tripos (officially Master of Mathematics/Master of Advanced Study) is a one-year master&#x27;s-level taught course in mathematics offered at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge. It is regarded as one of the most difficult and intensive mathematics courses in the world. Roughly one third of the students take the course as a continuation at Cambridge after finishing the Parts IA, IB, and II of the Mathematical Tripos resulting in an integrated Master&#x27;s (M.Math), whilst the remaining two thirds are external students who take the course as a one-year Master&#x27;s (M.A.St).

==History==
The Smith&#x27;s Prize Examination was founded by bequest of Robert Smith upon his death in 1768 to encourage the study of more advanced mathematics than that found in the undergraduate course. T. W. Körner notes

In 1883 this was replaced by an exam called &quot;Part III&quot; and the Smith&#x27;s Prize awarded for an essay rather than examination. In 1886 this exam was renamed &quot;Part II&quot;, and later in 1909 &quot;Part II, Schedule B&quot;. In 1934 it was again renamed &quot;Part III&quot;.

In the 1980s the &quot;Certificate of Advanced Study in Mathematics&quot; was introduced; for those students successfully completing Part III of the Mathematical Tripos in Easter Term 2011 CASM was replaced by two new degrees, the &quot;Master of Mathematics&quot; (M.Math.) and &quot;Master of Advanced Study&quot; (M.A.St.). All who have passed the course since 1962 are entitled to these new degrees. The first retrospective M.Math and M.A.St. degrees were conferred as part of a celebration of the university&#x27;s 800th anniversary. The course is often still referred to as Part III.

==Master of Mathematics vs Master of Advanced Study==
Students who have completed their undergraduate degree at Cambridge will be awarded both a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and the Master of Mathematics (M.Math.) degree for four years of study, provided they have not previously graduated with a B.A. This allows Cambridge graduates to remain eligible for government funding for the course. Progression from Part II of the Mathematical Tripos to Part III requires either a first class degree in Part II or very good performances in Parts IB and Part II. 
Students who complete Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, but did not complete undergraduate studies at Cambridge (or have previously graduated with a B.A.) are awarded the Master of Advanced Study (M.A.St.) in Mathematics degree for the one-year course.

The programme previously resulted in a Certificate of Advanced Study in Mathematics instead of a master&#x27;s degree.

==Course structure==
The course lasts one year, divided into three eight-week terms. There are a wide variety of lectures on both pure and applied maths, mostly concentrated in the first two terms. The third term is primarily for examinations (and revision for said examinations) which, together with the option of writing a part III essay (introduced in the 1970s, a miniature thesis, often in the form of a literature review), determine one&#x27;s final grade entirely.

==Grading==

The grades available are Fail, Pass (Honours), Merit, and Distinction (the Merit grade was introduced in 2000). Cambridge recognises that in Part III of the mathematical tripos a merit is equivalent to a First Class in the other parts of the Tripos. The level of achievement required for a distinction is yet higher than a typical First Class degree.
Traditionally, results are announced in the university&#x27;s Senate House. Standing on the balcony, the examiner reads out the class results for each student, and printed copies of the results are then thrown to the audience below. The students&#x27; exact rankings are no longer announced, but the highest-ranked student is still identified, nowadays by the tipping of the examiner&#x27;s academic hat when the relevant name is read out.

==Prizes==

In addition to the grades, there are six associated prizes. Five of these may be awarded at the discretion of the examiners: the Mayhew Prize for applied mathematics, the Tyson Medal for mathematics and astronomy, the Bartlett Prize for applied probability, the Wishart Prize for statistics and the Pure Mathematics Prize for pure mathematics. Several notable astronomers and astrophysicists have been awarded the Tyson Medal in the history of Part III maths, including Jayant Narlikar, Ray Lyttleton and Edmund Whittaker. In addition, the Thomas Bond Sprague Prize
is awarded by the Rollo Davidson Trust for distinguished performance in actuarial science, 
finance, insurance, mathematics of operational research, probability, risk
and statistics.

<text>John Patrick &quot;Pat&quot; Crecine (August 22, 1939 – April 28, 2008) was an American educator and economist who served as President of Georgia Tech, Dean at Carnegie Mellon University, business executive, and professor. After receiving his early education at public schools in Lansing, Michigan, he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in industrial management, and master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees in industrial administration from the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (now called Tepper School of Business) at Carnegie Mellon University. He also spent a year at the Stanford University School of Business.

==Michigan==
Dr. Crecine&#x27;s academic career began at the University of Michigan, where he established the country&#x27;s first graduate program in public policy in 1968 as the first Director of the Institute of Public Policy Studies, IPPS, (now the Gerald Ford School of Public Policy), while also holding academic appointments in political science and sociology. While at Michigan, Crecine established a joint Law and Public Policy program with the Michigan Law School and joint Ph.D. programs with Economics, Political Science, Sociology, Urban and Regional Planning, and Industrial Engineering, each of which were represented in the core curriculum of the IPPS Masters Program.

While at Michigan, he interrupted his teaching several times to serve the federal government as an economist, statistician, and consultant, and to work as an economist with the RAND Corporation. He earned tenure in 1968 and full professorships in Political Science and Sociology in 1970.

==Carnegie Mellon==
In 1976, he became dean Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and Professor of Political Economy in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences and in the School of Urban and Public Affairs (now Heinz College). As Dean he conceived of and implemented a core curriculum, described by the Education Editor of the New York Times as &quot;the most innovative in America&quot;, and added departments of Statistics, Social and Decision Sciences, Philosophy, and several research centers in the cognitive sciences, design, and computational linguistics to the College. Following a year as Visiting Fellow Commoner at the University of Cambridge, he was appointed Senior Vice President and Provost in 1983, with administrative responsibility for Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s academic, research, and systems development in computing Andrew Project and computer science and initiated, with Prof. Raj Reddy, the formation of the Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science (which became the first such college in the country). He was also the founding chief executive officer of the Inter-university Consortium for Educational Computing, an association of research universities. In 1986, he was the first chief administrative officer and oversaw the founding of the University Athletic Association, an NCAA Division III Conference.

Crecine returned to Carnegie Mellon in the fall of 2006 as Distinguished Service Professor at the Heinz College.

==Georgia Tech==
In 1987, Dr. Crecine became the ninth president of the Georgia Institute of Technology. In addition to his administrative responsibilities, Dr. Crecine held a joint appointment as tenured professor in the new School of International Affairs, and the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering. During his tenure, he initiated the establishment of three new colleges at Tech: the College of Computing (the first such college in the country); the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs; and the College of Sciences. He also served as Chairman of the Georgia Tech Athletic Association and as President of the Georgia Tech Research Corporation. During his tenure as President, the College of Engineering&#x27;s ranking climbed from 14th to 9th in the country, the institution was transformed from a specialized institution to a top-30 national university, SAT scores of Fall entering freshmen for 1992, 1993, and 1994 rose to become the highest of any public research university in the U.S., graduation rates increased by nearly 12 percent, student facilities and housing (including those under construction) were doubled from those of the previous 102 years of the institution&#x27;s existence, and sponsored research awards more than doubled.

===Athletics===
During Crecine&#x27;s tenure and under Athletic Director Homer Rice&#x27;s leadership, Georgia Tech&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic programs thrived with the football team winning the NCAA national championship in 1990, the basketball team going to the NCAA &quot;Final Four&quot; in 1990 along with several ACC championships, and the baseball team going to the 1994 College World Series. During Dr. Crecine&#x27;s tenure, Georgia Tech student-athletes had roughly the same graduation rates as other Georgia Tech students.

===Reorganization===
In 1988, Crecine proposed a controversial restructuring of the university. The Institute at that point had four colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Management, the College of Architecture, and the catch-all COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal Studies. Crecine proposed the reorganization of the latter two into the College of Computing, the College of Sciences, and the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs. A significant feature of the proposed reorganization was, in addition to creating degree programs in international affairs and public policy, was allowing faculty in the social sciences and humanities to develop degree programs in addition to traditional service courses and to add programs in the fine and performing arts to the College of Architecture and Design&#x27;s programs. The proposals generally represented an action plan for creating a &quot;technological university for the 21st Century&quot; and an elaboration of Crecine&#x27;s April, 1988 Inaugural Address. Although the Institute historian, August Geibelhaus states that &quot;Crecine announced the changes without asking for input, and consequently many faculty members disliked him for his top-down management style&quot;, Crecine asked the Faculty Senate in August 1988 to appoint and form committees for each of the three proposed new colleges to comment on the advisability of the proposed reorganization and to suggest improvements in the proposals. Although the Faculty Senate initially resisted the formation of the three committees, they were all formed and chaired by faculty not part of the administration and supported the proposals with modest changes. In June 1989, the administration sent out ballots, and the proposed changes passed, with a slim margin among the academic faculty (52%-48%) and with a wider margin among the research faculty (75%-25%). The proposed reorganization was approved unanimously by the Board of Regents of the State University System of Georgia. The restructuring took effect in January 1990. While Crecine was seen in a poor light by many of the faculty at the time, the changes he made are considered visionary.

==Post-academic career==
Dr. Crecine&#x27;s resignation as President of Georgia Tech took effect in July 1994. Dr. Crecine was associated with several start-up companies involved in Information Technology, ecommerce, and the internet and at the time of his death was CEO of B.P.T., Inc. a consulting firm. He served as a member of the Board of Directors of several public companies: Intermet Corporation (1993–2005), Web.com (formerly Interland Corporation, 2003–present), Liebert Corporation (1982–1987), 796 (Pittsburgh Baseball Club Ownership Group, 1982–87), NeXT Computer, Inc. (1987–1990), HBOC, Inc. (1992–1998), Total eMed (1999–2000), and numerous non-profit and charitable organizations.

<text>Sir William Randal Cremer (18 March 1828 – 22 July 1908) usually known by his middle name &quot;Randal&quot;, was a British Liberal Member of Parliament, a pacifist, and a leading advocate for international arbitration. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1903 for his work with the international arbitration movement.

==Early life==
Cremer was born to a working-class family in the southern English town of Fareham. His father was a coachman, who abandoned the family soon after Randal Cremer was born. His mother raised him along with his two sisters, ensuring he received an education at a local Methodist school. He augmented his knowledge by attending free lectures, was apprenticed as a builder and became a skilled carpenter.

Moving to London 1852, Cremer became active as a union organiser, swiftly becoming a recognized labour leader. Cremer was elected as the Secretary of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association in 1865 but resigned two years later in 1867, when the organization decided to make women eligible for membership. Being strongly opposed to women&#x27;s suffrage, Cremer might have now felt that the organisation was becoming too radical. While heavily involved in campaigning for progressive causes and respected by Karl Marx, Cremer did not agree with a worker-led revolution.

==Role in the international arbitration movement==
From as early as his first unsuccessful run for Parliament in 1868, Cremer had advocated the expansion of international arbitration as peaceful alternative to war for the resolution of disputes.

He was elected as Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Haggerston in the Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch from 1885 to 1895, and then from 1900 until his death from pneumonia in 1908.

Using his platform as an MP, Cremer cultivated allies on both continental Europe and across the Atlantic, including Frédéric Passy, William Jennings Bryan and Andrew Carnegie. Using his network of contacts and his talent for organisation, Cremer did much to create and expand institutions for international arbitration, which during his lifetime were successful in peacefully resolving numerous international disputes. This work includes co-founding the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the International Arbitration League; gaining acceptance for the 1897 Olney–Pauncefote Treaty between the United States and Britain that would have required arbitration of major disputes as the Essequibo territory (the treaty was rejected by the US Senate and never went into effect); and preparing the ground for the Hague peace conferences of 1899 and 1907.

In recognition of his work in the arbitration movement, Cremer won the Nobel Peace Prize, the first to do so solo, in 1903. Of the £8,000 award he donated £7,000 as an endowment for the International Arbitration League.

He also was named a Chevalier of the French Légion d&#x27;honneur, won the Norwegian Knighthood of Saint Olaf and was knighted in 1907.

Randal Cremer Primary School, in Haggerston, is named in his honour.

==Death==
Cremer died on 22 July 1908, leaving an estate of £2,241 (£1,803 net). Cremer&#x27;s Nobel Prize medal was sold at auction at Sotheby&#x27;s in London in November 1985 for $16,750 ()

<text>The end-blown flute (also called an edge-blown flute or rim-blown flute) is a woodwind instrument played by directing an airstream against the sharp edge of the upper end of a tube. Unlike a recorder or tin whistle, there is not a ducted flue voicing, also known as a fipple. Most rim-blown flutes are &quot;oblique&quot; flutes, being played at an angle to the body&#x27;s vertical axis. A notched flute is an end-blown flute with a notch on the blowing surface. A lip-valley flute is a type of notched flute.

End-blown flutes are widespread in folk music and art music. In Europe, the Russians have the svirel, attested from at least the 11th century. In the Middle East and Mediterranean the ney is frequently used, constructed from reed. Depictions of early versions of the ney can be found in wall paintings in ancient Egyptian tombs, indicating that it is one of the oldest musical instruments in continuous use. Several ancient Persian artworks depict the use of the ney.

The Persian ney has six finger holes, is blown with a specific technique that is found in a couple other occurrence by creating a flow of air between the tongue and the upper teeth while keeping the blowing end under the upper lip. Modern instruments often use a piece of plastic rolled in a tube to protect the instrument, older instrument could use copper.

The Arabic &quot;nay&quot; and the Turkish &quot;ney&quot; are played differently, outside the mouth, blowing the air towards the circumference of the mouth end, and feature seven finger holes - both are played in the same fashion but the Turkish version has an added horn or wood mouthpiece to facilitate the technique.

In Turkey the ney and kaval are both end-blown, although one type of Turkish kaval (dilli kaval) has a fipple. The kaval is also played throughout the Balkan countries of Bulgaria, Albania, Serbia, North Macedonia, and elsewhere. The Turkish ney plays a prominent role in classical Turkish music and Mevlevi (Sufi) music.

China has the xiao, Japan has the shakuhachi and Korea has the danso and tongso. People of the Andes play the quena, the Hopi and their predecessors the Ancestral Puebloans of the American southwest have and had a lain-ah flute using techniques similar to the neys (both Arabic and Persian). The washint is an East African flute. Panpipes are rim-blown in the same fashion with their lower ends stopped, bound together in a row or &quot;raft&quot;.

In Polynesia, the Māori of New Zealand play a number of end-blown flutes with the oblique method, including the , the and the .

<text>John Andrew Jackson Creswell (November 18, 1828December 23, 1891) was an American politician and abolitionist from Maryland, who served as United States Representative, United States Senator, and as Postmaster General of the United States appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant. Creswell is considered to be one of the ablest, if not the best, Postmaster General in United States history. Creswell modernized the U.S. Postal system to adapt to an expanding demand for increased postal routes throughout the Western states and remain competitive worldwide. Creswell also integrated the U.S. Postal system appointing both male and female African American postmasters throughout the United States, giving them significant positions of federal authority. Sweeping and constructive reforms of the U.S. Postal system took place during Creswell&#x27;s tenure, including securing fair competition among Star Route carriages, and the abolishment of the franking system. Creswell developed a codified classification system of offenses against postal laws. Creswell streamlined and reduced postal costs making the United States Postal System run efficiently creating a fair pricing system domestically, and reducing international mailing prices. Creswell developed and implemented the United States first penny postcard.

After attending a local academy, Creswell graduated from Dickinson College in 1848 and passed the bar in 1850. A former Whig, Creswell joined the Democratic Party and supported James Buchanan for president. When the Civil War broke in 1861, Creswell remained loyal to the Union and supported Abraham Lincoln. Creswell joined the Radical Republicans and supported the end of slavery and the civil rights of African Americans. In 1861, Creswell was elected to represent Cecil County in the Maryland House of Delegates and served until 1862, where he helped keep the state from joining the Confederacy. In 1862 Creswell was elected U.S. Representative and served from 1863 to 1865. Creswell was elected U.S. Senator in 1864 and served from 1865 to 1867. In 1868 Creswell supported Ulysses S. Grant for president. In 1869, President Grant appointed the &quot;gifted and debonair&quot; Creswell as Postmaster General. His appointment by Grant was very popular in Maryland whose citizens considered themselves part of the South. Having retired as Postmaster, Creswell was appointed by President Grant as an &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims Commissioner and served from 1874 to 1876. Creswell returned to private law practice and worked in the banking industry.

Modern historians, starting in the 1960s and continuing into the 21st century, have taken a renewed interest in Creswell as a forgotten abolitionist and for his appointments and integration of both male and female African Americans to prominent positions in the U.S. Postal system, viewing him as &quot;a man of the future&quot;.

==Early life==
John A. J. Creswell was born in Port Deposit, Maryland, then known as Creswells Ferry, on November 18, 1828. His father was John G. Creswell, from Maryland of English ancestry. His mother was Rebecca E. Webb, from Pennsylvania, of German and English ancestry. One of Rebecca&#x27;s forebears was Quaker missionary, Elizabeth Webb. 
Creswell attended a local academy before moving on to Dickinson College where he graduated with honors in 1848. He studied law for two years and was admitted to the bar in Baltimore in 1850, commencing practice in Elkton, Maryland.

==Family life==
During Creswell&#x27;s early career as a Maryland lawyer, he married Hannah J. Richardson of Maryland. Hannah was considerably wealthy. His uncle was Jacob Tome.

==Political career==
During the early 1850s, Creswell was a strongly partisan Whig. In 1850, Creswell was an unsuccessful candidate to the Maryland Reform State Convention. When the Whig party ceased to exist in the mid-1850s, Creswell became a Democrat and he attended the 1856 Democratic National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio that nominated James Buchanan for president.

===Maryland delegate and the Civil War===
At the outbreak of the Civil War, Creswell became a devoted and strongly influential Radical Republican. In 1861 Creswell was elected for the first time to public office, as a loyalist Union member of the Maryland House of Delegates. He served until 1862 and worked to prevent Maryland from leaving the Union and joining the Confederate States. In 1863, Creswell was appointed the state&#x27;s adjutant general, where he was in charge of raising Maryland&#x27;s quota of troops for the Union war effort.

===U.S. Representative===
Creswell was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1862, serving from 1863 to 1865. A staunch supporter of President Abraham Lincoln, Creswell was the first man in Congress to propose a constitutional amendment banning slavery.

===U.S. Senator===
Having lost reelection to the House in 1864, Creswell was elected to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Thomas H. Hicks, serving from 1865 until the end of that term in 1867. During his time in the Senate, he served as chairman of the Committee on the Library in the 39th Congress. At the Republican National Convention in 1868, Creswell&#x27;s name was put forward for either the presidential or vice presidential nominations.

==Postmaster General==

After Ulysses S. Grant was elected, he appointed Creswell Postmaster General. As Postmaster General, he reorganized the Post Office Department, introduced penny postcards and postal telegraphs, proposed a postal savings system. Creswell proved to be one of the ablest organizers ever to head the Post Office. He cut costs while greatly expanding the number of mail routes, postal clerks and letter carriers. He introduced the penny postcard and worked with Fish to revise postal treaties. A Radical, he used the vast patronage of the post office to support Grant&#x27;s coalition. He asked for the total abolition of the franking privilege since it reduced the revenue receipts by five percent. The franking privilege allowed members of Congress to send mail at the government&#x27;s expense. When Creswell suddenly resigned in 1874, historians have speculated this was due to impending scandals that plagued the Grant administration, however, Creswell gave no official reason for his resignation. Fatigue and an important personal matter may have been factors why Creswell resigned.

During the beginning of the Grant administration, it was reported by the New York Times, July 29, 1869, that Creswell injured himself in Baltimore while on a visit to his father-in-law Rev. James McIntire, near Elton. His left elbow was fractured by a fall from a porch on a chair. Creswell was in deep pain, but the injury was not considered serious and was expected to heal in a few weeks. Creswell said he felt better and he would take a few days off before he returned to Washington.

===Appointed African Americans and patronage===
Creswell, as Postmaster-General, had enormous power in distributing patronage nationally in the Postal Service. During Reconstruction as a Radical Republican Creswell appointed African Americans to serve in every state working in the Postal System. African American postal workers encountered abuse in certain areas of the South. Creswell appointed more African Americans than any of his predecessors. In distributing patronage Creswell followed the spirit of Civil Service reform and improved the efficiency of the postal service. Creswell was known to have &quot;distributed the enormous patronage of his office with a minimum of friction.&quot;

Prior to 1865, African Americans were banned from working in the Postal Department, mostly due to the Southern racism of not allowing blacks to handle the mail. At the end of the Civil War this restriction was lifted, but white postmasters in major cities around the nation only appointed a few African American clerks. Immediately when Creswell took office the conservative policy of appointing only white postmasters ended. When black applicants overcame the difficulty of posting a bond, Creswell began to appoint black postmasters across the country, including the South. One black postmaster, Charles Miller, received as hostile reception among white conservative society in Columbia, South Carolina in 1869. On November 15, 1872 Creswell appointed Mrs. Anna M. Dumas the first female African American postmaster in Covington, Louisiana. Creswell ended the policy of whites only mail carriers and appointed James Christian of Richmond, Virginia, the first black mail carrier, on June 1, 1869. Five months later Creswell appointed black Union veteran and first Medal of Honor hero, William Carney, letter carrier of Bedford, Massachusetts. On April 20, 1870 Creswell appointed John W. Curry Washington D.C.&#x27;s first black postman. Creswell also appointed Isaac Myers of Baltimore the first African American postal inspector.

===General Tate conversation (1870)===
President Grant, at the beginning of his first term in office, initiated an attempt to annex the Dominican Republic, then known as Santo Domingo. President Grant believed that the annexation and eventual statehood of the island country would add to American mineral resources and serve as a refuge for African Americans, who were harassed by violence from the Ku Klux Klan. At a White House reception on January 1, 1870, African Haitian minister, General Alexander Tate, attended. President Grant, who had no racial animosity, cordially shook General Tate&#x27;s hand. Other white dignitaries refused to associate with General Tate because he was black and ignored him at the reception. Postmaster Creswell, however, noticed that General Tate was being snubbed, and went over and had a pleasant conversation with him.

===Attempt to remove Creswell (1870)===
Upon assuming office, Postmaster Creswell strongly advocated the abolishment of the franking privilege that allowed Congress, both the Senate and the House of Representatives, to use the U.S. Postal Service paid for by taxpayers. Many in Congress, during November 1870, opposed the removal of this privilege, and friends of President Grant extensively lobbied that Creswell to be removed from office and replaced by Pennsylvanian, John W. Forney. This was done in part to having a Pennsylvanian on the Presidential cabinet so President Grant could freely choose a Revenue Commissioner. President Grant, however, resisted this pressure and kept Creswell in office.

===Congressional franking privilege abolished (1873)===
On January 28, 1873, President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law the abolition of the Congressional franking privilege. Previously, on January 27, 1873, the U.S. Senate bill, with amendments, to abolish the franking privilege, had been introduced by New Jersey Representative John Hill to vote on by the House of Representatives. Many Representatives in the House attempted by an amendment to make the franking abolition legislature less sweeping, however, these efforts failed. The stronger franking abolition bill passed the House by a vote of 143 to 48. Those who voted against the franking abolition were divided equally among both Republicans and Democrats, mostly from the Southern states. A bill to cut spending on Public Printing was introduced to the House, however, this failed to gain a two-thirds majority to pass. The abolition of the franking privilege would be effective on July 1, 1873. On February 26, 1873 Postmaster Creswell went before the House Committee on Appropriations and testified that federal postage appropriations were necessary for the U.S. Treasury and the Postal Department, after the abolishment of the franking took effect. Federal executive departments were exempt from the law.

===Proposed check payable bill (1874)===
By law, to secure a postal contract, bidders had to pay a 5% guarantee check at a national bank payable to the Postmaster General. Some bidders, however, in good faith, were only writing &quot;John Creswell&quot; or &quot;John A. Creswell&quot; rather than &quot;John A.J. Creswell, Postmaster General&quot; on their deposit checks. This was brought to the attention of Postmaster Creswell by California U.S. Representative John K. Luttrell. Pacific Coast mail routes would be effected without the proper format. On February 8, 1874, in order to solve the problem, Postmaster Creswell wrote a bill to Congress that required the correct &quot;Postmaster General&quot; format be put on all postal route guarantee checks. On February 9, Representative Luttrell promptly submitted the bill written by Postmaster Creswell to the House for ratification.

==&quot;Alabama&quot; claims commissioner==
Creswell accepted the appointment of a United States counsel before the &quot;Alabama&quot; Claims Commission; he served in that position from 1874 to 1876.

==Legal and banking career==
Creswell resumed practicing law and served as the president of two banks.

==Death==
Creswell died suddenly at noon at his home a mile outside of Elkton, Cecil County, Maryland, on December 23, 1891. His wife and the Presbyterian minister, Rev. Dr. Osmond, were with Creswell when he died. Creswell had contracted the flu and then succumbed to pneumonia. For the past several years Creswell had been in poor health having a heart condition. Seven other Marylanders during the last previous ten days had died of the flu and pneumonia. Creswell was interred in Elkton Presbyterian Cemetery. In April 1892, his extensive law library was put up for auction by Latimer &amp; Sloan, Auctioneers in Washington, D.C.

==Historical reputation==
Historians view Creswell as a forgotten &quot;committed abolitionist&quot; and have taken renewed interest for Creswell&#x27;s support of the Thirteenth Amendment ending slavery for African Americans in the United States, as a member of the House of Representatives, and for his advancement of African Americans, both male and female, in the Postal Service, while serving as President Grant&#x27;s appointed Postmaster General during that latter half of Reconstruction. The mistake of his name &quot;Angel James&quot; from his correct name &quot;Andrew Jackson&quot; may have &quot;originated in the late nineteenth century, possibly when his papers were processed by the Library of Congress.&quot; According to historians John M. Osborne and Christine Bombaro, both of Dickinson College, Creswell &quot;left few records of his personal life. There is no autobiography, diary, or memoir to be found beyond a brief and incomplete biographical sketch he wrote in November 1863, presumably for the United States Congressional Directory.&quot; 

Professor Matthew Pinsker, also of Dickinson College, said &quot;[w]hile serving as a Postmaster General during the Grant Administration, Creswell helped to integrate and modernize the federal post office system. He had truly become a man of the future.&quot; Born a Southerner, Creswell became &quot;an unlikely advocate for equality of opportunity.&quot; Historian Ronald C. White said Creswell was a &quot;highly competent lawyer&quot; and &quot;had ideas on how to reform the Post Office Department.&quot; White noted that Postmaster Creswell received &quot;strong commendations&quot; for introducing reforms, including expanding the Western mail service, instituting fair competition on carriage routes for mail transportation, a system previously riddled with bribery, and for strongly advocating the abolishment of the franking privilege system, all of these efforts endorsed by President Grant.

Osborne and Bombaro concluded that Creswell was &quot;a true Border State pragmatist who came to embrace what were at the time considered radical ideas about abolishing slavery and promoting equality. He came late to these ideas of &#x27;freedom national,&#x27; but when he joined the movement, he was as ardent as any of its adherents. Creswell could be ambitious and opportunistic, but he could also stand firmly for important values.&quot;

==Memorials==
John Creswell is the namesake of Creswell, North Carolina, and Creswell, Oregon.

<text>Jackson Lake is in Grand Teton National Park in northwestern Wyoming. This natural lake was enlarged by the construction of the Jackson Lake Dam, which was originally built in 1911, enlarged in 1916 and rebuilt by 1989. As part of the Minidoka Project the top of the lake is used by farmers in Idaho for irrigation purposes under water rights legislation that was enacted prior to the establishment of Grand Teton National Park. The lake is the remnant of large glacial gouging from the neighboring Teton Range to the west and the Yellowstone Plateau to the north. The lake is primarily fed by the Snake River, which flows in from the north, and empties at Jackson Lake Dam. Jackson Lake is one of the largest high altitude lakes in the United States, at an elevation of above sea level. The lake is up to long, wide and deep. The water of the lake averages below , even during the summer.

Numerous species of fish inhabit the lake including nonnative brown and lake trout and the native Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout and mountain whitefish.

There are over 15 islands in the lake, including the largest, Elk Island, and Donoho Point.

John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway is located near the northern end of Jackson Lake and extends to the south entrance of Yellowstone National Park. This roadway combines with the roads in Grand Teton National Park that follow the eastern side of the lake, and provides access for boating and fishing. There are several marinas and lodges along the eastern shore such as Leeks marina, Colter Bay Village, Jackson Lake Lodge and Signal Mountain Lodge. All of these except Jackson Lake Lodge have boat access points and ramps. The western shore of Jackson Lake is primitive, with only hiking trails and a handful of primitive campground spots.

<doc id="739625" wikidata="Q2255249" url="?curid=739625" title="James Crichton">
<text>James Crichton, known as the Admirable Crichton (19 August 1560 – 3 July 1582), was an alleged Scottish polymath noted for his extraordinary accomplishments in languages, the arts, and sciences before he was murdered at the age of 21.

==Early life==
James Crichton was from Clunie, in Perthshire, although some sources maintain his birthplace was Dumfries. He was the son of Robert Crichton of Eliok, Lord Advocate of Scotland, and Elizabeth Stewart, from whose line James could claim Royal descent.

One of the most gifted individuals of the 16th century, Crichton was educated at St Andrews University between the ages of ten and fourteen, during which time he completed requirements for both his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. James was taught by the celebrated Scottish scholar, politician and poet George Buchanan (1506–1582). It was apparent from his earliest days that James was an unusually gifted prodigy, which may have been associated with a gift for perfect recall.

==Further education in France==
By the age of twenty, he was not only fluent in, but could discourse in (both prose and verse) no fewer than twelve languages, as well as being an accomplished horseman, fencer, singer, musician, orator, and debater. Noted for his good looks as well as his refined social graces, he was considered to have come closest to the ideal of the complete man.

Leaving Scotland, Crichton travelled to Paris, where he continued his education at the Collège de Navarre. It was in the French capital that he first came to prominence by challenging French professors to ask him any question on any science or liberal arts subject in Arabic, Dutch, English, French, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Latin, Slavonic, Spanish, or Syriac. It is said that throughout the course of one extremely long day, French scholars failed to stump Crichton on any question they threw at him, no matter how abstruse.

==Travel to Italy==
Thereafter he spent two years as a soldier in the French army before travelling to Italy in 1579, winning acclaim in Genoa, Venice, and Padua by repeating his exploit of challenging Italian scholars to intellectual discourse and debate. Once, he is alleged to have bested a professional gladiator in a brutal fencing match.

In Venice in 1580, Crichton befriended the printer Aldus Manutius, who introduced him to the Venetian intellectual community, where the young Scot made an enormous impression on humanist scholars. In Padua in 1581, he clashed with a number of scholars over their interpretation of Aristotle, while demonstrating that their mathematics was flawed.

Perhaps tiring of intellectual duels, the following year Crichton entered the service of the Duke of Mantua, and may have become tutor to the Duke&#x27;s headstrong son Vincenzo Gonzaga (although some sources suggest that Crichton served only as a member of the ducal council, and did not actually teach the prince).

==Death in Mantua==
What is beyond dispute is that while Crichton was in the Duke&#x27;s employ, Vincenzo Gonzaga became hugely jealous of him, probably from a combination of his father&#x27;s strong regard for the young prodigy as well as Crichton replacing Vincenzo as the lover of the prince&#x27;s former mistress.

On the night of 3 July 1582, after leaving this lady&#x27;s dwelling in Mantua, Crichton was attacked in the street by a gang of masked ruffians. He bested all but one with his sword, until the last man removed his mask to reveal the group&#x27;s ringleader, Vincenzo Gonzaga himself. Tradition holds that, on seeing Vincenzo, Crichton instantly dropped to one knee and presented his sword, hilt first, to the prince, his master&#x27;s son. Vincenzo took the blade and with it stabbed Crichton cruelly through the heart, killing him instantly at the age of 21.

==Reputation==
Much of Crichton&#x27;s posthumous reputation comes from a romantic 1652 account of his life written by Sir Thomas Urquhart (1611–1660), contained within an unclassifiable work (&quot;The Jewel&quot;) that is characterized by exaggeration and hyperbole. There is little or no contemporary evidence for many of the stories surrounding him.

That said, his existence is supported by a few letters and his actual abilities were probably impressive, enough that his story has not been lost through the centuries since his death. Samuel Johnson devoted the 14 August 1753 issue of the periodical &quot;The Adventurer&quot; to the story of Crichton, writing, &quot;&quot;Among the favourites of nature that have from time to time appeared in the world, enriched with various endowments and contrarieties of excellence, none seems to have been [more] exalted above the common rate of humanity, than the man known about two centuries ago by the appellation of the Admirable Crichton.&quot; A historical novel entitled &quot;Crichton&quot; was published by the English writer William Harrison Ainsworth in 1837. &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot; is referred to by Charles Dickens in his 1859 story collection &quot;The Haunted House&quot;. The &quot;Admirable Crichton&quot; was mentioned as an exemplar in W. M. Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (1847) and referenced in chapter 3 of Anthony Trollope&#x27;s &quot;The Prime Minister&quot; (1876). James Crichton&#x27;s sobriquet was later employed by fellow Scot Sir James Barrie as the title of his 1902 satirical play, &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot;, about a butler whose &quot;savoir-faire&quot; far exceeds that of his aristocratic employers. A memorial to Crichton can be found in the church of St. Bride&#x27;s in Sanquhar and in the church of San Simone in Mantua.

He is also the namesake of the James Crichton Society at St Andrews University which publishes a monthly academic journal.

<doc id="739628" wikidata="Q866226" url="?curid=739628" title="Carbon nanofoam">
<text>Carbon nanofoam is an allotrope of carbon discovered in 1997 by Andrei V. Rode and co-workers at the Australian National University in Canberra. It consists of a cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web. The fractal-like bond structure consists of sp2 graphite-like clusters connected by sp3 bonds. The sp3 bonds are located mostly on the surface of the structure and make up 15% to 45% of the material, making its framework similar to diamond-like carbon films. The material is remarkably light, with a density of 2-10 x 10−3 g/cm3 (0.0012 lb/ft3) and is similar to an aerogel. Other remarkable physical properties include the large surface area of 300–400 m2/g (similar to zeolites). of nanofoam weighs about .

Each cluster is about 6 nanometers wide and consists of about 4000 carbon atoms linked in graphite-like sheets that are given negative curvature by the inclusion of heptagons among the regular hexagonal pattern. This is the opposite of what happens in the case of buckminsterfullerenes in which carbon sheets are given positive curvature by the inclusion of pentagons.

The large-scale structure of carbon nanofoam is similar to that of an aerogel, but with 1% of the density of previously produced carbon aerogels—or only a few times the density of air at sea level. Unlike carbon aerogels, carbon nanofoam is a poor electrical conductor. The nanofoam contains numerous unpaired electrons, which Rode and colleagues propose is due to carbon atoms with only three bonds that are found at topological and bonding defects. This gives rise to what is perhaps carbon nanofoam&#x27;s most unusual feature: it is attracted to magnets, and below −183 °C can itself be made magnetic.

Carbon nanofoam is the only form of pure carbon known to be ferromagnetic which is unusual for a carbon allotrope. Ferromagnetism is an intrinsic property observed in the carbon nanofoam and may be accounted for by its complex structure. Impurities in the material are excluded as the source of magnetism as they are not sufficient for the strong magnetization observed. Researchers postulate that embedded carbon atoms with unpaired electrons carry enough of a magnetic moment to lead to strong magnetization. The sheet curvature localizes unpaired electrons by breaking up the π-electron clouds and sterically protects the electrons which normally would be too reactive to persist. The ferromagnetism of the carbon nanofoam is sensitive to time and temperature. Some magnetism is lost within the first few hours of synthesis, however most of it is persistent. Carbon nanofoam may have some application in spintronic devices which exploits electron spin as a further degree of freedom.

Carbon nanofoam may be suitable for hydrogen storage due to its low density and high surface area. Preliminary experimentation has shown that hydrogen can be stored in the nanofoam at room temperature in a reversible process.

==Synthesis ==

Carbon nanofoam clusters can be synthesized through high-repetition-rate laser ablation in inert gases such as argon. Short (fs), low-energy (μJ) pulses delivered at high rates of repetition (10 kHz – 100 MHz) generate carbon vapors for deposition. Ambient gas is heated from room temperature with the atomized carbon which leads to an increase in the partial density of the carbon in the chamber. In optimal conditions, the inert gas does not cool down but maintains its high temperature between cycles of formation. Subsequent cycles in the chamber are carried out at temperatures above the formation threshold temperature initiating sp2 bonding. The increase in density and temperature promotes favorable conditions for the formation of carbonaceous clusters. The rate of consumption exceeds the rate of evaporation by laser ablation and thus the formation is in a non-equilibrium state.

<text>John Hurrell Crook (27 November 1930 – 15 July 2011) was a British ethologist who filled a pivotal role in British primatology.

As Reader in Ethology (animal behaviour) in the Psychology Department of University of Bristol, he led a research group studying social and reproductive behaviour in birds and primates throughout the 1970s–80s, turning to the socio-psychological anthropology of Himalayan peoples in the 1990s. In his later years he was the Teacher of the Western Chan Fellowship.

==Early life==
He was educated at Oakmount School, Southampton and Sherborne School, Dorset.

He completed his national service in Hong Kong, where he first encountered Chan Buddhism.

==Academic career==

Crook was a pioneer in the early development of socio-ecology, adding this dimension to ethology which was then dominated by the ideas of &quot;Niko&quot; Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz. His student paper on the gulls of Southampton Water while at University of Southampton, led to his doctoral study at Jesus College, Cambridge of the weaver birds (&quot;Ploceidae&quot;) of West Africa, supervised by William Homan Thorpe and Robert Hinde. This was followed by further research in India, the Seychelles Islands and East Africa. His theoretical interpretation subsequently contributed to David Lack&#x27;s discussion of the behavioural component in avian population research. His fieldwork was further supported by laboratory experimentation on the endocrinal basis for the behaviour observed in the field.

After moving to Bristol University, he collaborated with Professor K.R.L. Hall in establishing a centre for primate studies, extending socio-ecological principles to primates, supervising doctoral projects and leading field research in Ethiopia on geladas and in Morocco on the Barbary macaque, subsequently developed by Robin Dunbar and John Deag respectively.

His year as Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University in California introduced him to the new techniques of humanistic psychotherapy. On return to Bristol, his students requested him to demonstrate these methods, leading to the creation of the Bristol Encounter Centre and to his teaching of the subject widely in the UK, especially based on workshops run at his retreat centre in mid Wales.

In 1977, Crook led an expedition to Zanskar in the Himalayas of Ladakh, a pilot study focussing on polyandry. For several years, he and colleagues led further expeditions studying the geology, agriculture, social and family life and monastic practices in this remote, high-altitude region. He later returned with James Low, a Tibetologist fluent in the texts and language, to study the lives of Buddhist hermits in the mountains.

Retiring early, he began practising Zen Buddhism in intensive retreats taught at Dharma Drum Retreat Center in New York by Chan Master Sheng-yen of Dharma Drum Mountain, Taiwan, who in 1993 transmitted to him the authority to teach Chan Buddhism. Forming the Western Chan Fellowship with colleagues, Crook developed a programme of retreats adapted to Western Zen practitioners.

Crook published around a hundred scientific papers in ornithology, ethology and evolutionary psychology, and several books focussing on consciousness and Zen practice. His last work was &quot;World Crisis and Buddhist Humanism&quot; (New Age Books, Delhi 2009).

He died on 15 July 2011, shortly after a gathering of many former students and colleagues in Somerset to celebrate his life. Dr Innes Cuthill, Professor of Behavioural Ecology at Bristol University, described him as &quot;a pivotal figure in the rise of British primatology and socio-ecology&quot;.

<text>Laughing Stock is the fifth and final studio album by English band Talk Talk, released in 1991. Following their previous release &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; (1988), bassist Paul Webb left the group, which reduced Talk Talk to the duo of singer/multi-instrumentalist Mark Hollis and drummer Lee Harris. Talk Talk then acrimoniously left EMI and signed to Polydor, who released the album on their newly revitalised jazz-based Verve Records label. &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; was recorded at London&#x27;s Wessex Sound Studios from September 1990 to April 1991 with producer Tim Friese-Greene and engineer Phill Brown.

Like &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; the album featured improvised instrumentation from a large ensemble of musicians. The demanding sessions were marked by Hollis&#x27; perfectionist tendencies and desire to create a suitable recording atmosphere. Engineer Phill Brown stated that the album, like its predecessor, was &quot;recorded by chance, accident, and hours of trying every possible overdub idea.&quot; The band split up following its release.

The album garnered significant critical praise, often cited as a watershed entry for the budding post-rock genre at the time of its release. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; retrospectively gave the album a 10 out of 10 score and named it the eleventh best album of the 1990s, saying it &quot;makes its own environment and becomes more than the sum of its sounds.&quot; In a 2007 list, &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; named it the greatest post-rock album.

== Background ==
In 1986, Talk Talk, then a three-piece band consisting of leader and singer Mark Hollis alongside drummer Lee Harris and bassist Paul Webb, released their third album &quot;The Colour of Spring&quot;, which saw the band shift from their earlier, synthpop-oriented sound and featured a more organic art pop sound, where musicians improvised with their instruments for many hours, then Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene edited and arranged the performances to get the sound they wanted. A total of sixteen musicians appeared on the album. It became their most successful album, selling over two million copies and prompting a major world tour. Nonetheless, for their next album &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; (1988), the band chose to work towards an even more unconventional and uncommercial direction. The album was compiled from a lengthy recording process at in Studio 1 at London&#x27;s Wessex Studios between 1987 and 1988 where the band worked again with Friese-Greene and engineer Phill Brown. Once again working largely in darkness, the band recorded many hours of improvised performances which were heavily edited and re-arranged into the final album.

&quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; was not a commercial success and although it would be acclaimed in later retrospective reviews, it initially polarized music critics. Their record label EMI had doubts about whether it could have been successful many months in advance. They asked Hollis to re-record a song or replace material, but he refused to do so. By the time the masters were delivered later in the month, however, the label conceded that the album had been satisfactorily completed, and chose to extend the band&#x27;s recording contract. The band, however, wanted out of the contract. &quot;I knew by that time that EMI was not the company this band should be with,&quot; manager Keith Aspden told &quot;Mojo&quot;. &quot;I was fearful that the money wouldn&#x27;t be there to record another album.&quot; EMI and Talk Talk went to court to decide the issue. Centered around whether EMI had notified the band in time about the contract extension, because as part of the agreement, the label had to send a written notice within three months after the completion of the album, but the band said they had notified them too late, arguing that the three-month period began once recording had finished; EMI argued that the three-month period did not begin until they were satisfied with the recording. Justice Andrew Morritt ruled in favour of EMI, but his decision was overturned in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. Talk Talk were released from the contract.

Nonetheless, in 1990, bassist Paul Webb left the band, officially reducing Talk Talk to the duo of Hollis and Harris. EMI also issued two compilations without the band&#x27;s consent in 1990 and 1991; &quot;Natural History: The Very Best of Talk Talk&quot; – a best-of/greatest hits album, and &quot;History Revisited&quot; – a collection of new remixes of old material from the band. Hollis was vocal in his opposition to both releases. Before the latter was released, Hollis sent letters requesting that the compilation be stopped, but EMI did not respond. In November 1991, Talk Talk sued EMI, delivering four writs against their former record label. The band claimed that material had been falsely attributed to them and that they were owed money from unpaid royalties. Talk Talk won the case in 1992, and EMI agreed to withdraw and destroy all remaining copies of the album. Manager Keith Aspden hoped that the case would set a precedent for future recording contracts.

As the band&#x27;s legal battle with EMI concerning their contract had freed them from the label, the band began searching for other record labels, and eventually, their manager Keith Aspden signed them to Verve Records, the jazz offshoot label of Polydor Records. Hollis was pleased that they signed Talk Talk because the Mothers of Invention were once on Verve. The band set to recording their new album soon after the contract was signed. Again hiring an array of guest musicians, producer/multi-instrumentalist Tim Friese-Greene and engineer Phill Brown, work began on &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; in 1990.

== Recording ==

With Verve Records guaranteeing full funding for &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; and offering not to interfere during recording, the band took full advantage of the scenario &quot;and locked themselves away for the duration of recording.&quot; As with the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; was produced by Tim Friese-Greene and recorded at the North London recording studio Wessex Sound Studios with engineer Phill Brown, and around fifty guest musicians, although a total of only eighteen guest musicians feature on the final album. Working in an environment influenced by that of Traffic&#x27;s recording sessions from 1967 that Brown worked on, Hollis&#x27; vision with &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; was to &quot;collect a group of like-minded musicians together&quot; in the studio where he could then record the &quot;perspective of instruments in physical distance rather than off the board,&quot; after which &quot;each player gets to improvise around a basic theme as he or she feels it.&quot; The process continued over a long period of time, and ultimately the album took a year to record, although its liner notes state it was recorded from September 1990 to April 1991. The record was &quot;only complete&quot; when Hollis felt each guest musician had &quot;expressed their character and refined their contribution to the purest, most truthful essence.&quot;

Hollis&#x27; discipline during the recording is well noted; Jess Harvell of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; noted that &quot;the recording process has long been described as one of the most arduous and prone to control freakitude ever.&quot; Wyndham Wallace of &quot;The Quietus&quot; said that &quot;what went on in that studio strengthens the belief that Hollis was on a crusade to push boundaries and perfect his art on an even grander scale than &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot;. Furnished with the opportunity to fulfil his most extreme creative instincts.&quot; Often working in darkness, &quot;there was an effort to create a vibe in the studio sympathetic with the feel of the album,&quot; as Aspden recalled, and the band removed clocks from the walls, covered up the windows, &quot;set up oil projections on the walls and ceiling, and used no other light apart from a strobe,&quot; to create a suitable atmosphere for recording.

The guest musicians were brought in &quot;to improvise on sections without hearing the full track. With just a basic chord structure at most, they were encouraged to try out anything their hearts encouraged them to, and then, thanks to the emerging digital technology, any results felt appropriate were employed, sometimes in places for which they had never originally been envisioned.&quot; Most of the music recorded never made the final album, with Brown commenting &quot;it takes a strong discipline to erase 80% of the music you record. Few have the discipline to get rid of &#x27;stuff&#x27;.&quot;
As with previous albums, Hollis alone chose what parts of the recordings to use and in what context. Compared to &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot;, &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; was recorded with &quot;a more conventional &#x27;80&#x27;s set up.&quot; Brown and the band worked with a Studer A800 24-track recorder with Dolby SR noise reduction, which, to make editing simpler, was run at 30 inches per second.
Harris&#x27; drums were firstly set up against the far wall of the studio&#x27;s main recording room, Wessex Studio 1, and were microphoned in &quot;the usual rock arrangement&quot;, using &quot;about ten microphones all close to the kit – bass drum, snare, hi-hat, tom-toms, overheads, ambient etc.&quot; Following this, Brown and Hollis rented the Telefunken U47, a large-diaphragm condenser valve microphone manufactured by Georg Neumann GmbH during the years 1949–1965. They chose it from an offering of several valve mics, which besides the U47 included a Neumann U48, M49 and &quot;Tube&quot;, alongside &quot;the old Wessex Collection&quot; which included three AKG C12As. They carefully listened to each before settling on the U47. However, they placed it &quot;30 feet away from the kit near the control-room window,&quot; which became an issue as the physical distance triggered a delay of 26-32 milliseconds.

Having by that point created backing tracks, they &quot;made up Mitsubishi Digital masters&quot; as they had done with &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot;, although this time they operated five analogue slave tapes, which gave them access &quot;to over 120 tracks for recording ideas.&quot; From this point, they continued to overdub further textures and instruments, including cellos, pianos, harmoniums, guitars, double bass, violas, harmonica, percussion, Melodica, Hammond organ, Variophon, drums, and unusually, a water heater and kettle, as well as techniques such as &quot;sampling, looping, off-setting, and the odd backwards F/X.&quot; Differing, distant miking techniques were employed for these instruments, with mics being placed &quot;six feet from acoustic instruments, and about twelve feet from amplifiers.&quot; With the album now completed, they used only &quot;an old spring echo, an EMT echo plate, and a DDL&quot; to mix the album.

== Music ==
&quot;Laughing Stock&quot; consists of six tracks; Steve Sutherland said the album is &quot;divided into six parts although it&#x27;s really one long piece spanning an evolution of moods.&quot; Ian Cranna of &quot;Q&quot; said the album was &quot;even more withdrawn and personal than before.&quot; Comparing the album to &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot;, Jess Harvell of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; says &quot;the song structures are even stranger, built up from the tiniest musical gestures, clashing in mood from track to track, frequently more improvised-sounding than ever. The goal, assembling a coherent album from all this stuff, probably seemed quixotic to many of the contributors as it was being made.&quot; In a 1991 interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Mark Hollis said &quot;the last thing I would ever want to do is intellectualise music because that&#x27;s never been what it&#x27;s about for me. Nothing has changed from the ethic of the last album and I would never want that to change because I can&#x27;t see any way of improving upon that process. As before, silence is the most important thing you have, one note is better than two, spirit is everything, and technique, although it has a degree of importance, is always secondary.&quot;

Hollis cited Can&#x27;s &quot;Tago Mago&quot;, John Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;In a Sentimental Mood&quot; – where &quot;it sounds like the bloke&#x27;s setting his kit up&quot; – and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;New Morning&quot; as influences, &quot;because there, if you&#x27;re talking about sounds being honest, I don&#x27;t think you can get much more honest than that. It just sounds like the band&#x27;s in the front room with you.&quot; In a radio interview with Richard Skinner at the time of the album&#x27;s release, Hollis commented that &quot;I think silence is an extremely important thing. It isn&#x27;t something that should be abused. And that&#x27;s my biggest worry because of the whole way that communications have developed, that there is a tendency just to allow this background noise all the time rather than thinking about what is important. The silence is above everything, and I would rather hear one note than I would two, and I would rather hear silence than I would one note,&quot; and according to Wyndham Wallace, &quot;this helps explain the fifteen seconds of amplifier hiss that open the record&#x27;s first track, &#x27;Myrrhman&#x27;, the huge amounts of space left in final track &#x27;Runeii&#x27;, and the overall sonic concept perfected by Friese-Greene and Brown, who declares third track &#x27;After The Flood&#x27; to be &quot;probably the best engineering for me in the past forty years.&quot; Drums were miked far from the kit, sounds were allowed to echo through the studio space, mistakes were an integral part of the performance, and the album&#x27;s dynamics are entirely genuine, the live feel of a jazz record.&quot;

&quot;New Grass&quot; was described as &quot;Talk Talk as a purely placid and lovely proposition, electric organ and lilting guitar endlessly circling around Harris&#x27; heartbeat-steady drumming.&quot; &quot;Ascension Day&quot;, in contrast, is considered the band&#x27;s &quot;most chaotic and vicious song,&quot; described by Harvell as &quot;like a small jazz combo being elbowed aside by a noise rock band, with a climactic barrage of drumming that falls on your ears like an avalanche before the audible tape-splice cuts it dead.&quot; In the song, Hollis sings about judgment day and &quot;its inevitable coming, saying farewell to us all.&quot;

“Taphead&quot;, &quot;a masterfully subtle piece of music&quot;, begins with a simple guitar melody and Hollis&#x27; &quot;wavering, unsure vocals,&quot; when keyboards unexpectedly fade in &quot;and then the darkest, warmest trumpet sounds, one after the other, building beautiful harmony, with tension and release techniques apparent throughout the feature.&quot; Tyler Fisher, describing it for Sputnikmusic continued that &quot;with this, Talk Talk creates a climax unlike any heard before or after. Following a more frenetic trumpet feature, light drums, bass, and piano enter, setting the slightest groove to allow for a screaming trumpet note and Hollis&#x27; vocals. Another climax that lasted less than a second. The control that the ensemble shows in &quot;Taphead&quot; is unparalleled.&quot;

== Release ==
When the band delivered &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; to Verve, Polydor were purported &quot;gutted&quot;, wondering how they would be able to sell such an uncommercial record. Sutherland recalled that &quot;the first time I heard the record was at a dinner given for retailers by the record company at The New Serpentine Gallery. It was an embarrassingly desperate attempt over cocktails to convince store owners that they should stock a record which, the company was trying to infer, stood for quality over likely quantity of sales. Nobody knew where to look as Hollis&#x27; muted blues confessional purposely disintegrated into shivering feedback. A similar farce was, apparently, held in a Paris planetarium. Hollis attended both playbacks and survived. He says the Paris one wasn&#x27;t too bad because, when the lights went out, it was close to the perfect way to listen to his music – with your eyes closed, watching your own mind movies. He didn&#x27;t stick around in London, though – he had no desire to see people&#x27;s reactions. He says he&#x27;s proud of the record and, seeing as it wasn&#x27;t made for other people, their opinions don&#x27;t bother him.&quot;

Hollis denied that there was any problem with Polydor, saying &quot;the whole structure of the deal we have with this record company is understanding how we work. I suppose because it&#x27;s on Verve some people will think we&#x27;ve been stuck under &#x27;Jazz&#x27; but what on earth does jazz mean? It&#x27;s such a vague term, isn&#x27;t it? Without any question there are certain areas of jazz that are extremely important to me. Ornette Coleman is an example. But jazz as a term is as widely used and abused as soul – it no longer means what it should mean. Jazz has almost been bastardised to such an extent that, if you&#x27;ve got a saxophone on a record, it&#x27;s jazz, which is a terrifying idea. It&#x27;s like, where would you ever place Can? To me &quot;Tago Mago&quot; is an extremely important album that has elements of jazz in it, but I would never call it jazz. Basically, the deal is that I promise to give them the best album I can. I think they have options across four albums which, at the pace we work, is the next 12 years. What more can you say?&quot;

Verve Records released the album on 16 September 1991. No official singles or music videos were released to promote the album. Nonetheless, a limited edition box set entitled &quot;After the Flood / New Grass / Ascension Day&quot; was released in France, containing the aforementioned three songs from the album, with the former edited down as an &quot;outtake&quot;, and two unreleased B-sides (&quot;Stump&quot;, &quot;5:09&quot;). In the United States, a recording of an interview with Mark Hollis entitled &quot;Mark Hollis Talks About Laughing Stock&quot; was distributed on cassette. Despite the lack of traditional promotion, the album reached number 26 on the UK Albums Chart, and stayed on the chart for two weeks.

Unlike Talk Talk&#x27;s other albums, the album has never been remastered for CD, but on 11 October 2011, Ba Da Bing Records released a remastered version of &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; on vinyl, marking the first time that the album has been issued on vinyl in the United States. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; commented that the remastering on this re-release sounds &quot;amazing, as good as the album&#x27;s ever sounded, in any format. Which is crucial, because on some level Talk Talk&#x27;s later albums are all about sound. How startling, isolated moments of sound, or a formless wash of sound, can wring emotions out of listeners as powerfully as any conventional melody.&quot;

== Artwork ==

The cover art was designed by English visual artist James Marsh, responsible for most of Talk Talk&#x27;s artwork. Marsh initially painted a cover depicting a group of threatened birds forming the shape of a larger bird in flight over a desolate landscape. However, Hollis later felt the artwork should feature a tree, to create a visual connection to &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot;. The final cover featured the same birds in a spherical tree forming the shapes of the Earth&#x27;s continents. Later on, the first cover was used as the artwork for Talk Talk&#x27;s three-single box set &quot;After the Flood&quot;. As with previous albums, the album&#x27;s liner notes feature Hollis&#x27; handwritten lyrics for each of the songs. Russel Uttley of Peacock Design is credited with the layout design of the sleeve.

== Critical reception ==
Upon release, &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. Jim Irvin was effusive in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, finding that with &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;, Talk Talk had produced &quot;three masterpieces in a row&quot; and become &quot;certainly the most individual, possibly the most important group we have.&quot; Writing for &quot;Vox&quot;, Betty Page lauded it as one of 1991&#x27;s &quot;most challenging records&quot;. &quot;Select&quot;″s Nick Griffiths called the album &quot;perverse genius&quot; and &quot;an exercise in self-indulgence and nothing more. If you refuse to enter their playground for the world-weary then that&#x27;s fine by them.&quot; Ian Cranna of &quot;Q&quot; said that while &quot;the melancholy mood, a rare thoughtfulness and the sense of sharing something deeply personal, together with the haunting, emotional quality of the understated music, put Talk Talk heavily at odds with the commercial charts... the same qualities will ensure that even though &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; may lose Hollis some of his newly found friends, it will be valued long after such superficial quick thrills are forgotten.&quot; In &quot;NME&quot;, however, David Quantick wrote that the album &quot;is unutterably pretentious and looks over its shoulder hoping that someone will remark on its &#x27;moody brilliance&#x27; or some such. It&#x27;s horrible.&quot; At the end of 1991, &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; was listed by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; as the year&#x27;s 12th best album, while &quot;Oor&quot; ranked it 20th best; it also placed at number 26 on &quot;Eye Weekly&quot;″s year-end critics&#x27; poll.

Retrospectively, &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; has gone on to receive widespread acclaim. &quot;A work of staggering complexity and immense beauty,&quot; wrote AllMusic critic Jason Ankeny, &quot;&quot;Laughing Stock&quot; remains an under-recognized masterpiece, and its echoes can be heard throughout much of the finest experimental music issued in its wake.&quot; Reviewing the album for &quot;The Times&quot;, Victoria Segal found that in its &quot;instrumental richness and exploratory dynamics&quot;, it &quot;chimes unexpectedly with many recent developments in today&#x27;s rock landscape&quot;, while also noting an &quot;emotional heat&quot; which &quot;stops &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; from being mere academic indulgence.&quot; Jess Harvell of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; commented that &quot;sound can become all the more powerful when surrounded by silence, great gulfs of which are all over the later Talk Talk albums, especially &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;&quot;. Sputnikmusic&#x27;s Tyler Fisher said, &quot;The world needs to hear this album, even if you haven&#x27;t liked post rock before, because I guarantee that this is not the type of music you think of when you think post rock. Unfortunately, it should be.&quot; In &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, Donal Dineen wrote that the album &quot;shows what magic can happen if bands have the talent and daring to push boundaries&quot;.

== Legacy ==

The album has appeared in multiple &quot;best albums&quot; lists. In 2003, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; as 11th best album of the 1990s. The same year, &quot;Mojo&quot; placed the album on their list of the &quot;Top 50 Eccentric Albums&quot;. In 1999, Ned Raggett included the album at number 4 in his list of &quot;The Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties&quot;. In 2014, &quot;Rockdelux&quot; ranked the album at 138 on their list of &quot;The 300 Best Albums of 1984–2014&quot;. In 2004, the German version of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 108 in their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

&quot;Laughing Stock&quot; is considered, along with &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; and Slint&#x27;s &quot;Spiderland&quot;, to have been the primary catalyst of the post-rock genre. AllMusic said that &quot;the musical foundation for post-rock crystallized in 1991, with the release of two very different landmarks: Talk Talk&#x27;s &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; and Slint&#x27;s &quot;Spiderland&quot;.&quot; The term &quot;post-rock&quot; itself was not coined until Simon Reynolds used it in his &quot;Melody Maker&quot; review of &quot;Hex&quot; (1994) by Bark Psychosis, which featured Talk Talk-inspired ambient experiments. &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; has also influenced Elbow and Bon Iver, and in 2011, Jess Harvell of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; said &quot;many indie rock bands and experimental composers have genuflected toward it over the last 20 years.&quot;

Norwegian singer-songwriter Jenny Hval said in 2011 that &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; &quot;is an incredibly intuitive and bare recording – some songs feel like vapour trails. To me, every sound on the album is about death, like the songs are about to die, like a band of Beckett characters. But at the same time the album is so emotional. &#x27;After The Flood&#x27; is like crying. After 22 July [the day of the 2011 Norway attacks], &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; was one of two records I wanted to listen to.&quot; Scottish singer King Creosote said &quot;I think of the final two albums by Talk Talk as siblings very close in age. If &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; is the older, pretty and sophisticated big sister who got all the A grades, then &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; is the wayward, grubby wee brother who got kicked out of school for skiving.&quot; Tom Fleming of Wild Beasts, whose bands have been often compared to Talk Talk, praised the album and commented that it is a &quot;kind of a dead end. It&#x27;s like minimal techno. It&#x27;s like, how much more minimal can you be?&quot;

After engineering &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;, Phill Brown said &quot;there was divorce, breakdown. It was intense. I have never worked on more focussed sessions though. And no – I wouldn&#x27;t work in the dark again. It was difficult getting back to &#x27;normal&#x27; sessions.&quot; However, compared to prior Talk Talk albums, he goes on to note that &quot;&quot;Laughing Stock&quot; is a different beast. I am very proud of the album, it&#x27;s probably one of my best projects, but I find it dark and claustrophobic.&quot; &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; was the last release in the band&#x27;s career, as Talk Talk silently disbanded in 1992, as Hollis wished to focus on his family. Paul Webb rejoined Lee Harris, and the two went on to form the band .O.rang, who recorded several albums in the 1990s, while Tim Friese-Greene started recording under the name Heligoland. Mark Hollis effectively left the music industry, but in 1998 released his unexpected self-titled solo début &quot;Mark Hollis&quot;, which was much in keeping with the post-rock sound of &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; and &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;, finding inspiration not in the popular music of the day, but rather in 20th-century classical music and jazz from the late fifties and sixties. He officially retired from the music industry shortly afterwards.

<text>George Romney ( – 15 November 1802) was an English portrait painter. He was the most fashionable artist of his day, painting many leading society figures – including his artistic muse, Emma Hamilton, mistress of Lord Nelson.

==Early life and training==

Romney was born in Beckside in Dalton-in-Furness, Lancashire (now in Cumbria), the 3rd son (of 11 children) of John Romney, cabinet maker, and Anne Simpson. Raised in a cottage named High Cocken in modern-day Barrow-in-Furness, he was sent to school at nearby Dendron. He appears to have been an indifferent student and was withdrawn at the age of 11 and apprenticed to his father&#x27;s business instead.

He proved to have a natural ability for drawing and making things from wood – including violins (which he played throughout his life). From the age of 15, he was taught art informally by a local watchmaker called John Williamson, but his studies began in earnest in 1755, when he went to Kendal, at the age of 21, for a 4-year apprenticeship with local artist Christopher Steele – a portraitist who had himself studied with distinguished French artist Carlo Vanloo. All costs were to be borne by George&#x27;s father.

In October 1756, Romney married Mary Abbot (a decision he initially regretted), but the couple were immediately separated when he was called away to York on business by his employer. After a year, Steele eventually agreed to cancel the apprenticeship, at George&#x27;s request, leaving the young artist – now a father of a son – free to pursue his own career as a painter.

==Work==
===Westmorland===
In 1757, Romney rejoined his wife and young son in Kendal, working as a portraitist, landscape and historical painter. In this period he became friends with Adam Walker, the inventor and writer, and also pursued musical interests in his spare time. In March 1762, he parted from his wife, son and daughter (the latter dying in 1763), to seek his fortune in London, where he stayed (apart from a few return visits to Cumbria) until 1799. Throughout the separation, he maintained contact with his family and financially supported them, but they never lived with him in the capital.

===London===

In 1763, Romney entered his painting, &quot;The Death of General Wolfe&quot;, into a Royal Society of Arts competition. According to friends of Romney, he was awarded the second prize of 50 guineas, but this was later reduced to 25 guineas on questionable grounds. It is said that Sir Joshua Reynolds himself was the prime mover behind this decision, a fact which may have accounted for the lifelong aversion of the two men for each other.

Despite his later success, Romney was never invited to join the Royal Academy of Arts (formed 1768), though he was asked, urged even, to exhibit there – nor did he ever apply to join. This decision certainly cost him valuable royal patronage and support from others connected at court. While there has been much speculation about his actual relationship with the academy, there is no doubt that he normally remained aloof, maintaining that a good artist should succeed without being a member. His own career supported this belief, and it was only towards the end of his life that he expressed the slightest regret for his views.

His early years in the capital were something of a financial struggle . In September 1764, he travelled to Paris (with a friend, lawyer Thomas Greene) for a few weeks to study the works of the old masters (travel abroad was seen as a requisite of a developing artist&#x27;s training as the opportunity to view great art in London was very limited). In 1765 he again won the second prize of 50 guineas in the Royal Society of Arts competition. In 1768, he made the acquaintance of Richard Cumberland, the dramatist, whose portrait he painted, and who was helpful in introducing him to influential patrons. He also became friends with miniature painter Ozias Humphrey.

1769 was a breakthrough year – he exhibited a large portrait of Sir George Warren and family at the Free Society of Artists, which was greatly admired and helped to lay the foundations of his future popularity. In 1770 he started to exhibit his work at the Chartered Society of Artists rather the rival &quot;Free Society of Artists&quot;.

===Italy===
By 1772 Romney was financially secure enough to make the journey (with Ozias Humphrey) to Italy to study the great artists of the past, as he had always intended. He set off in March, making his way through Europe (via Paris, Lyon, Marseilles, Nice, Genoa, Livorno, Florence and Pisa) and arriving in Rome in June. A letter of introduction allowed him to meet the Pope, Clement XIV, who allowed him to set up scaffolding in the Vatican to study the frescoes of Raphael. He spent 18 months in Rome making studies and sketches of the great art works on view there. He returned to London in July 1775 (via Florence, Bologna, Venice, Parma, and Turin) after an absence of over 2 years.

===Later career===

On his return, in 1775, Romney moved to Cavendish Square, in a house formerly owned by noted portraitist Francis Cotes. He was considerably in debt, not only on his own account but also due to being saddled with the debt of his artistic but dissolute brother Peter. However, he was offered commissions by the Duke of Richmond and his circle of friends, which helped turn the tide of fortune permanently in the artist&#x27;s favour. In 1776–77, he made the acquaintance of William Hayley, striking up a lasting friendship with the writer, and painting portraits for him.

1782 was the beginning of an important new chapter in Romney&#x27;s life, for in that year he was first introduced to Emma Hamilton (then called Emma Hart) who became his muse. He painted more than 60 portraits of her in various poses, sometimes playing the part of historical or mythological figures. He also painted many other contemporaries, including fellow artist Mary Moser and, in 1787, a little-known seventeen-year old young lady in one of his most charming works, &quot;Miss Constable in a Bergère Hat&quot;.

In 1797 Romney left his studio at 32 Cavendish Square, where he had worked for more than twenty years, to move to Holly Bush Hill in Hampstead. In Hampstead Romney embarked on a series of costly building projects, and sold the house two years later. Romney&#x27;s House is now a Grade I listed building, and Romney is commemorated by a blue plaque placed on the property.

In the summer of 1799, his health was broken, and after an absence of almost forty years, Romney returned to his wife, Mary, in Kendal. She nursed him during the remaining 2 years of his life until he died in November 1802. He was buried in the churchyard of St. Mary&#x27;s Parish Church, Dalton-in-Furness.

George Romney is a kinsman of American businessmen and politicians George W. Romney (1907–1995) and Mitt Romney (born 1947); their ancestor Miles Romney was George Romney&#x27;s first cousin once removed.

<text>Julie Goodyear (&#x27;Kemp&quot;&#x27;; born 29 March 1942) is an English retired actress. She is known for portraying Bet Lynch in the long-running ITV soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. She first appeared as Bet for nine episodes in 1966, before becoming a series regular from 1970 to 1995. She returned for eight episodes in 2002 and another seven in 2003. For her role on &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, she received the Special Recognition Award at the 1995 National Television Awards. She was made an MBE in the 1996 New Year Honours.

==Early life==
Goodyear was born on 29 March 1942 in Heywood, Lancashire, to Alice (&quot;née&quot; Duckworth) and George Kemp, who divorced when Goodyear was six years old. Her mother remarried to William Goodyear in 1949, whom she knew as her father and whose surname she adopted. Goodyear was brought up by her maternal grandmother, Elizabeth Duckworth, who died by drowning when Goodyear was thirteen years old. She attended Queen Elizabeth Grammar School in Middleton.

== Career ==
=== Early work ===
Goodyear began modelling in the 1960s, predominantly as hand and foot model, which led to her acting debut in 1965, portraying the uncredited role of Charity in the first series of the ITV sitcom &quot;Pardon the Expression&quot;. The following year, she appeared in the second series on a further three occasions as separate minor characters. Between 1965 and 1966, she appeared as Duckie in two episodes of the crime drama &quot;The Man in Room 17&quot; and also featured in one of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Play of the Week&quot; in 1966.

===&quot;Coronation Street&quot;===

Goodyear is known for playing barmaid Bet Lynch on the ITV1 soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. After appearing as an extra the previous year, she started playing the role for a brief time in 1966, but left when senior cast member Pat Phoenix (who played Elsie Tanner) advised her to get some more training. It was at that time she joined Oldham&#x27;s Repertory Theatre and went on to appear in episodes of various television series including &quot;Mr. Rose&quot; and &quot;The Fellows&quot; in 1967, &quot;City &#x27;68&quot;, &quot;Spindoe&quot;, &quot;The War of Darkie Pilbeam&quot; and appeared as Sandra in Granada Television&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Nearest and Dearest&quot; in 1968, as well as &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Pleasure&quot;, &quot;The Contenders&quot; and &quot;Kes&quot; in 1969. She appeared in two episodes of &quot;The Dustbinmen&quot; between 1969 and 1970, and portrayed Mrs. Powner in an episode of &quot;A Family At War&quot;.

Goodyear returned to &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 1970 and remained in the series for 25 years. She quit &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 1995, shortly after winning the Lifetime Achievement Award for her role as Bet Lynch in the first ever National Television Awards. She returned to the role of Bet in 1999 for the home video spin-off &quot;The Rover Returns&quot;.

In 2002, it was announced that Goodyear would be returning to the show after seven years away. Goodyear&#x27;s return was intended to be permanent and she had signed a year&#x27;s contract, however she was forced to quit after seventeen days due to the intense filming schedule, which had left her suffering from exhaustion. She returned to the show again in 2003, though this time, her appearances were part of a storyline set in Blackpool that involved Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) and her husband Jim (Charles Lawson), who had recently escaped from prison. These transpired to be Goodyear&#x27;s final scenes in the show.

===Career after &quot;Coronation Street&quot;===
In 1996, she signed a deal for advertisements for Shredded Wheat. Her other work included filming a pilot of &quot;The Julie Goodyear Show&quot; for Granada, presenting &quot;Live Time&quot; on the Granada Breeze network every week day throughout January 1999, and being a DJ on Manchester Talk Radio. In 2001, she appeared in the BBC television comedy sketch series &quot;Revolver&quot; and on several episodes of the ITV1 game show &quot;Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank&quot;. In 2004, she won the first series of the Living TV reality series, &quot;I&#x27;m Famous and Frightened!&quot;.

In 2005, Goodyear was one of the celebrities taking part in the ITV reality series, &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;, alongside former &quot;Coronation Street&quot; co-star Ken Morley. She was originally made team captain but quit the role after six weeks, and the role was taken over by Aldo Zilli. She lost 1 stone 10 pounds, and her team won the show.

She appeared in the reality shows &quot;Road Raja&quot;, &quot;Age Swap&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Penthouse&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Stars in Their Eyes&quot; as Marlene Dietrich. She had a small role in the British film &quot;Tug of War&quot; (2006) and in October 2006 played a brief role in Channel 4 soap opera &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; as Mrs. Temple, owner of a B&amp;B. In 2007, she was interviewed by Piers Morgan for the BBC series &quot;You Can&#x27;t Fire Me, I&#x27;m Famous&quot; where she discussed her highly publicised short-lived return to &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 2002. In April 2008, Goodyear and her fourth husband appeared on an episode of &quot;All Star Mr &amp; Mrs&quot;, and in December 2008, Goodyear portrayed Sarah Harding&#x27;s mother in the Christmas variety show &quot;The Girls Aloud Party&quot;. In October 2009, it was confirmed that she would be starring in &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; on the West End stage, and appeared in the show for three weeks before dropping out due to a virus. In December 2010, she participated in a &quot;Coronation Street&quot; special of &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot;.

In 2012, Goodyear became a housemate on the tenth series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; on Channel 5. She was the seventh housemate to be evicted on Day 22 in a double eviction alongside fellow housemate Lorenzo Borghese.

Goodyear appeared on &quot;Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories&quot; in 2013. In 2017, Goodyear appeared in the BBC Two documentary &quot;Queer as Art&quot;. She made an appearance on &quot;The Big Quiz&quot; in 2018 and was interviewed for the television documentary &quot;Coronation Street at Christmas&quot; in 2019, the latter of which was her final television appearance.

==Personal life==
Goodyear has been married four times. Her first marriage to Ray Sutcliffe at the age of 17 when she was two months pregnant with her son Gary, who was born in April 1960. Her second husband, Tony Rudman, left her for his best man on their wedding day after Goodyear discovered he was gay; their marriage was subsequently annulled. Her third marriage in 1985 was after a long-distance relationship with American Richard Skrob. She married her fourth husband, Scott Brand, 26 years her junior, in 2007 after eleven years together. She has three grandchildren. Goodyear is a life-long resident of Heywood, Lancashire and lives with her fourth husband at Primrose Hill Farm, a property she purchased and renovated in 1995.

Her autobiography, titled &quot;Just Julie&quot;, was released in November 2006. In the book, she discussed her upbringing, bisexuality, experience with cancer, and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. Goodyear is a patron of Willow Wood Hospice, where her &quot;Coronation Street&quot; co-star Roy Barraclough died in 2017. She donated several pieces of jewellery and memorabilia worn by her character Bet Lynch in order to raise funds for the hospice.

===Health===
In 1979, she temporarily left &quot;Coronation Street&quot; for the second of three times after being diagnosed with cervical cancer, something she kept secret from the public until she had recovered. Following her ordeal with cancer, she founded a charity which resulted in formation of the Julie Goodyear Cancer Screening Centre.

In June 2023, Goodyear&#x27;s husband Scott Brand announced that she had been diagnosed with dementia, confirming in a statement that she had been &quot;suffering [from] forgetfulness for some time&quot; [...] adding that they had been seeking medical advice and assistance, however there was &quot;no hope of a reversal in the situation&quot; and that her condition will get progressively worse. Following her diagnosis, Goodyear attended a memory walk alongside her husband in Heaton Park, Manchester for the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society in October 2023. In March 2024, Goodyear&#x27;s husband said she was &quot;slowly fading away&quot; and that it had been &quot;extremely painful&quot; to watch her deterioration.

==Honours==
She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1996 New Year Honours, &quot;for services to television drama&quot;.

<doc id="739654" wikidata="Q804635" url="?curid=739654" title="Balancing selection">
<text>Balancing selection refers to a number of selective processes by which multiple alleles (different versions of a gene) are actively maintained in the gene pool of a population at frequencies larger than expected from genetic drift alone. Balancing selection is rare compared to purifying selection. It can occur by various mechanisms, in particular, when the heterozygotes for the alleles under consideration have a higher fitness than the homozygote. In this way genetic polymorphism is conserved.
Evidence for balancing selection can be found in the number of alleles in a population which are maintained above mutation rate frequencies. All modern research has shown that this significant genetic variation is ubiquitous in panmictic populations.

There are several mechanisms (which are not exclusive within any given population) by which balancing selection works to maintain polymorphism. The two major and most studied are heterozygote advantage and frequency-dependent selection.

== Mechanisms ==

=== Heterozygote advantage ===

In heterozygote advantage, or &quot;heterotic balancing selection&quot;, an individual who is heterozygous at a particular gene locus has a greater fitness than a homozygous individual. Polymorphisms maintained by this mechanism are &quot;balanced polymorphisms&quot;. Due to unexpected high frequencies of heterozygotes, and an elevated level of heterozygote fitness, heterozygotic advantage may also be called &quot;overdominance&quot; in some literature. 
A well-studied case is that of sickle cell anemia in humans, a hereditary disease that damages red blood cells. Sickle cell anemia is caused by the inheritance of an allele (HgbS) of the hemoglobin gene from both parents. In such individuals, the hemoglobin in red blood cells is extremely sensitive to oxygen deprivation, which results in shorter life expectancy. 
A person who inherits the sickle cell gene from one parent and a normal hemoglobin allele (HgbA) from the other, has a normal life expectancy. However, these heterozygote individuals, known as &quot;carriers&quot; of the sickle cell trait, may suffer problems from time to time.

The heterozygote is resistant to the malarial parasite which kills a large number of people each year. This is an example of balancing selection between the fierce selection against homozygous sickle-cell sufferers, and the selection against the standard HgbA homozygotes by malaria. The heterozygote has a permanent advantage (a higher fitness) wherever malaria exists. Maintenance of the HgbS allele through positive selection is supported by significant evidence that heterozygotes have decreased fitness in regions where malaria is not prevalent. In Surinam, for example, the allele is maintained in the gene pools of descendants of African slaves, as the Surinam suffers from perennial malaria outbreaks. Curacao, however, which also has a significant population of individuals descending from African slaves, lacks the presence of widespread malaria, and therefore also lacks the selective pressure to maintain the HgbS allele. In Curacao, the HgbS allele has decreased in frequency over the past 300 years, and will eventually be lost from the gene pool due to heterozygote disadvantage.

=== Frequency-dependent selection ===
Frequency-dependent selection occurs when the fitness of a phenotype is dependent on its frequency relative to other phenotypes in a given population. In &quot;positive frequency-dependent selection&quot; the fitness of a phenotype increases as it becomes more common. In &quot;negative frequency-dependent selection&quot; the fitness of a phenotype decreases as it becomes more common. For example, in prey switching, rare morphs of prey are actually fitter due to predators concentrating on the more frequent morphs. As predation drives the demographic frequencies of the common morph of prey down, the once rare morph of prey becomes the more common morph. Thus, the morph of advantage now is the morph of disadvantage. This may lead to boom and bust cycles of prey morphs. Host-parasite interactions may also drive negative frequency-dependent selection, in alignment with the Red Queen hypothesis. For example, parasitism of freshwater New Zealand snail (&quot;Potamopyrgus antipodarum&quot;) by the trematode &quot;Microphallus sp.&quot; results in decreasing frequencies of the most commonly hosted genotypes across several generations. The more common a genotype became in a generation, the more vulnerable to parasitism by &quot;Microphallus sp.&quot; it became. Note that in these examples that no one phenotypic morph, nor one genotype is entirely extinguished from a population, nor is one phenotypic morph nor genotype selected for fixation. Thus, polymorphism is maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection.

=== Fitness varies in time and space ===
The fitness of a genotype may vary greatly between larval and adult stages, or between parts of a habitat range. Variation over time, unlike variation over space, is not in itself enough to maintain multiple types, because in general the type with the highest geometric mean fitness will take over, but there are a number of mechanisms that make stable coexistence possible.

== More complex examples ==
Species in their natural habitat are often far more complex than the typical textbook examples.

=== Grove snail ===
The grove snail, &quot;Cepaea nemoralis&quot;, is famous for the rich polymorphism of its shell. The system is controlled by a series of multiple alleles. Unbanded is the top dominant trait, and the forms of banding are controlled by modifier genes (see epistasis).

In England the snail is regularly preyed upon by the song thrush &quot;Turdus philomelos&quot;, which breaks them open on &quot;thrush anvils&quot; (large stones). Here fragments accumulate, permitting researchers to analyse the snails taken. The thrushes hunt by sight, and capture selectively those forms which match the habitat &quot;least well&quot;. Snail colonies are found in woodland, hedgerows and grassland, and the predation determines the proportion of phenotypes (morphs) found in each colony.

A second kind of selection also operates on the snail, whereby certain heterozygotes have a physiological advantage over the homozygotes. Thirdly, apostatic selection is likely, with the birds preferentially taking the most common morph. This is the &#x27;search pattern&#x27; effect, where a predominantly visual predator persists in targeting the morph which gave a good result, even though other morphs are available.

The polymorphism survives in almost all habitats, though the proportions of morphs varies considerably. The alleles controlling the polymorphism form a supergene with linkage so close as to be nearly absolute. This control saves the population from a high proportion of undesirable recombinants.

In this species predation by birds appears to be the main (but not the only) selective force driving the polymorphism. The snails live on heterogeneous backgrounds, and thrush are adept at detecting poor matches. The inheritance of physiological and cryptic diversity is preserved also by heterozygous advantage in the supergene. Recent work has included the effect of shell colour on thermoregulation, and a wider selection of possible genetic influences is also considered.

=== Chromosome polymorphism in &quot;Drosophila&quot; ===
In the 1930s Theodosius Dobzhansky and his co-workers collected &quot;Drosophila pseudoobscura&quot; and &quot;D. persimilis&quot; from wild populations in California and neighbouring states. Using Painter&#x27;s technique, they studied the polytene chromosomes and discovered that all the wild populations were polymorphic for chromosomal inversions. All the flies look alike whatever inversions they carry, so this is an example of a cryptic polymorphism. Evidence accumulated to show that natural selection was responsible:

# Values for heterozygote inversions of the third chromosome were often much higher than they should be under the null assumption: if no advantage for any form the number of heterozygotes should conform to Ns (number in sample) = p2+2pq+q2 where 2pq is the number of heterozygotes (see Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium).
# Using a method invented by L&#x27;Heretier and Teissier, Dobzhansky bred populations in &quot;population cages&quot;, which enabled feeding, breeding and sampling whilst preventing escape. This had the benefit of eliminating migration as a possible explanation of the results. Stocks containing inversions at a known initial frequency can be maintained in controlled conditions. It was found that the various chromosome types do not fluctuate at random, as they would if selectively neutral, but adjust to certain frequencies at which they become stabilised.
# Different proportions of chromosome morphs were found in different areas. There is, for example, a polymorph-ratio cline in &quot;D. robusta&quot; along an transect near Gatlinburg, TN passing from to 4,000 feet. Also, the same areas sampled at different times of year yielded significant differences in the proportions of forms. This indicates a regular cycle of changes which adjust the population to the seasonal conditions. For these results selection is by far the most likely explanation.
# Lastly, morphs cannot be maintained at the high levels found simply by mutation, nor is drift a possible explanation when population numbers are high.

By 1951 Dobzhansky was persuaded that the chromosome morphs were being maintained in the population by the selective advantage of the heterozygotes, as with most polymorphisms.

<doc id="739656" wikidata="Q19798782" url="?curid=739656" title="What Would You Do? (1991 TV program)">
<text>What Would You Do? is a 30-minute television show hosted by Marc Summers shown on Nickelodeon from 1991 to 1993. Robin Marrella acted as the on-camera stagehand for the show&#x27;s first season. Both Summers and Marrella performed their respective duties on &quot;Double Dare&quot;, also on Nickelodeon. The show was produced in Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios in Florida; some early segments were produced at Universal Studios in Hollywood.

==Format==
During each show, the audience viewed a previously taped segment or stock film featuring children or families or others put in unusual situations. The tape was stopped before the outcome and Summers asked the audience to vote on either what they would do in the same situation or what the outcome would be. After the results were tallied, the outcome was played.

Special guests, usually performers from other Universal Studios attractions, appeared on &quot;What Would You Do?&quot; and picked audience members to perform gross, silly or extraordinary stunts. Stunts could involve handling animals, playing a very messy version of Twister barefoot, painting, dancing or creating sound effects.

==Segments==
===Anything You Can Do...===
Additional segments included contests between two selected audience members (&quot;Anything You Can Do&quot;). These contests ranged from who could finish a glass of milk the fastest, to seeing who could inflate and pop a balloon the fastest. The end result of these contests would be the winner having the opportunity to smash a whipped cream pie in the face of the loser (or send the loser to one of the show&#x27;s pie contraptions). This type of contest often pitted a child against his or her parent. This feature was used in the second (1993) season.

===&quot;What Would You Do?&quot; Medley===
The end of each episode in the first season featured the &quot;What Would You Do?&quot; Medley, where certain audience members and Summers had index cards attached to their foreheads; usually, any special guests on the show would also participate in the Medley. Each card had a different stunt listed on it. One card would usually have a stunt based on a segment from earlier in the show. The participant either had to do what it said on the card, sight unseen, or be sent to the Pie Pod.

===Wall o&#x27; Stuff===
In the second season, the Medley was replaced with the Wall o&#x27; Stuff, a wall of numbered doors, each hiding a prize or surprise. Each audience member was assigned a number. If their number was drawn from a lottery machine, that participant received a token to open one of the 20 doors. Some of the doors had &quot;What Would You Do?&quot; merchandise, such as a T-shirt or a gym bag. Others concealed pies that would be flung at the contestants&#x27; face (or a water cannon filled with whipped cream which would be squirted at the contestant). In addition, an unlucky participant could receive a card that sent them to one of the pie contraptions upon reading the paper containing a poem that is associated with the pie contraptions. Sometimes the contestant received a card that instructed them to open another door. On one occasion, a door contained a card that said &quot;Pie Marc&quot; so Marc got a pie in the face from the audience member.

Sometimes, winning a stunt would award a token for the Wall o&#x27; Stuff. In these instances, those who won their tokens would take their turn at the Wall before any balls were drawn from the lottery machine.

The only doors were not chosen were doors 14 and 17.

==Pie contraptions==
The cream pie was central to the show&#x27;s premise, and was frequently doled out as &quot;punishment&quot; (or sometimes, a reward) for anything. Whenever audience members were picked to perform a stunt, they were often given the option to either perform it or go to one of several pie contraptions. Alternatively, failure to complete a stunt could also send someone to one of these devices. In the first season Robin would place the audience member in the contraption, but during the second season, staff members wearing red jumpsuits that read &quot;Pie Pod Attendant&quot;, &quot;Pie Wash Attendant&quot;, or &quot;Pie Coaster Attendant&quot; took over the duties of preparing the devices.

===The Pie Pod===
The most used and most popular &quot;pie device&quot; on the show, this contraption could launch up to four whipped cream pies at one audience member (sometimes two and on one episode, three). They were set up in a hydraulic chair and covered with a clear plastic tarp, leaving their head exposed. Then the chair, which resembled a barber&#x27;s chair or an antique-style dentist&#x27;s chair, would be pumped up until the participant&#x27;s head was aligned with a target behind them. Summers then asked the audience (or the winning player, in case of a game that sends the loser to the Pie Pod) how many pies (out of 4) should be launched – &quot;4&quot; was the usual answer – and then released them, following a count of three. During the first season, a device called the &quot;Crowning Glory&quot; was suspended over the participant&#x27;s head. This was a container shaped like a crown that held a small amount of pink slime. Most of the time this was only released if the audience determined that the &quot;victim&quot; flinched during the release of the pies. However, it could be used for any random occasion Marc deemed warranted it, such as it being someone&#x27;s birthday.

In the second season, the Crowning Glory was removed, but a fifth pie was added; in addition, participants were no longer covered with a smock, and the large lab goggles were replaced with small swimming goggles. (Incidentally, on very early episodes, the Pie Pod could be loaded with up to six pies - but the two outer ones were never launched, and were subsequently removed). Sometimes, in the show&#x27;s second season, the Wall O&#x27; Stuff would result in an audience member &quot;winning&quot; a trip to the Pie Pod (or some other pie device), as heralded by a corny poem such as the following: &quot;Roses are Red, Violets are Blue. A Trip to the Pie Pod is Waiting for You.&quot;

On very early episodes, the audience member would not get a plastic tarp to protect their clothes, and/or no goggles, or only got safety glasses that were usually knocked right off with a direct hit. Marc was sent to the Pie Pod at least twice during the show&#x27;s run. On the first occasion, Marc said a censored word and had to go to the Pie Pod as a result. The second time, after Marc chose the card during the What Would You Do medley, which was to eat a &quot;veggie split&quot;, Robin decided the sundae &quot;needed some whipped cream&quot; and therefore sent Marc to the Pie Pod.

One game was played directly at the Pie Pod, where Marc interviewed a member of the studio audience while a 60-second clock counted down. When the audience member thought that they were within 10 seconds of the 60-second target, they were to say &quot;Stop&quot;, and for every 10 seconds they were out, one pie would be launched. If the 60 seconds expired, all four pies would be launched.

===Pie Slide===
By far the messiest. An audience member was sent to the top of a playground slide which ended up in a large vat filled with hundreds of gallons of whipped cream and a red beach ball made to look like a cherry. Participants would first remove their socks, shoes and other valuables, and go barefoot up the ladder to the top of the slide. Then the victim was usually allowed to choose whether to go head first or feet first, and would then set off down into the vat, following a count of three. Sometimes when the victim chose to go head first, they would get to hold a small video camera which Marc called the &quot;Pie Cam&quot; as they went down the Pie Slide, giving the home viewers a first-person view of the victim going down the Pie Slide.

One memorable &quot;Pie Slide&quot; incident featured a young woman during the &quot;&quot;What Would You Do?&quot; Medley&quot; segment who opted to ride the Pie Slide headfirst rather than eat a Twinkie with gravy, when it was all over; the woman, laughing hysterically, her entire body covered with cream, openly wished she had chosen to eat the Twinkie with gravy.

Another memorable Pie Slide moment featured Marc having the audience point to someone who they wanted to see go down the Pie Slide. Everyone in the audience pointed to Marc, which meant that Marc had to go down the Pie Slide, head first. In that same episode, Marc&#x27;s card during the &quot;What Would You Do&quot; Medley said &quot;Pie Slide&quot; and he tried to get out of it by saying that they were out of time. But Robin made him go down the Pie Slide anyway, although he got to go feet first.

The Pie Slide was featured only in the first season, in the second season, it was replaced by the Pie Coaster (see below), which was much less messy.

===Pie Pendulum===
A family was selected, with one family member being strapped to a long board with their face hanging over the side. The participant was asked five questions about another family member, with each incorrect answer resulting in the other participating family member turning a crank which lowered the victim&#x27;s face toward a large pie (a pile of whipped cream in a giant metal bowl). Three incorrect answers resulted in the victim&#x27;s face landing in the pie; three correct answers resulted in the victim being &quot;saved&quot;, and the other participating family member would be &quot;cranked&quot; into the pie face first. This was used only in the first season.

===Pie in the Sky===
Two participants were chosen (usually two family members). Three bowls were stacked directly above each participant&#x27;s head, with the top one containing pink slime (referred to as &quot;pie filling&quot;). The two participants were then asked a series of five questions about another family member standing between the two contraptions; each time a participant missed one, one of three levers was pulled, allowing the slime to be emptied into the bowl underneath the current one. Three incorrect answers resulted in the third lever being pulled, releasing the &quot;pie filling&quot; onto the contestant&#x27;s head. If after five questions neither participant had been slimed, the family member about whom the questions were being asked was forced to stand under one of the contraptions and get slimed (though this rarely happened). One variation had a contestant trying to complete a stunt in a 30-second time limit, the stunt would be stopped at 10-second intervals to release the pie filling. On more than one occasion, the device malfunctioned, thus releasing the &quot;pie filling&quot; after only two pulls, or not at all after the required three pulls (which the contestant immediately jumped out from underneath and was not slimed).

===Pie Roulette===
In this Pie game, which is borrowed from &quot;Wild and Crazy Kids&quot;, another Woody Fraser/Nickelodeon/Reeves Entertainment production, the chosen participants took turns being seated at a table loaded with a pie. The contestant placed their head in a chin rest on the table. They rolled a die, and had to turn a crank whatever number of times the die showed. At any time the crank was being turned, the device could spring the pie, which would land in the contestant&#x27;s face. In addition, the &quot;Flinch Factor&quot; (a bucket containing the aforementioned pink &quot;pie filling&quot;) was positioned above the contestant&#x27;s head, if the audience voted that the contestant flinched at any time (whether he was pied or not), the bucket would be released onto their head. On at least one occasion a contestant was slimed with the bucket even though he had not been pied. (On the &quot;Wild and Crazy Kids&quot; version, this bucket was filled with actual cherry pie filling, and was &quot;reloaded&quot; after each use.)

Woody Fraser would reuse this pie contraption in his later &quot;Family Challenge&quot;.

===Pie Wash===
Appearing in the second season only, this device would have the audience member sit in a large leather chair and be strapped in with a seatbelt, while three nozzles above attempted to spray the audience member with whipped cream while he was being spun around rapidly, before it &quot;cleaned them up&quot; using a rotating car wash styled brush. Its associated poem at the Wall o&#x27; Stuff goes as &quot;Roses are Red, Envy is Green. After the Pie Wash, You&#x27;ll be Squeaky Clean.&quot; On one occasion, the Wall o&#x27; Stuff card said &quot;We couldn&#x27;t think of anything to rhyme with Pie Wash, so just go there.&quot; The Pie Wash often failed to get whipped cream onto the participant, as the whipped cream had either melted in the contraption (causing it to simply dribble out onto the floor), or the hoses failed to spray it out altogether. On the occasions when it did work, however, the contestant was immersed. As with the Pie Pod, the &quot;Pie Wash&quot; victim was made to wear goggles.

In one famous moment, a contestant was sent to the Pie Wash, but as she rotated, nothing came out of the pipes. While everyone was figuring out what was going on, Marc turned and found that the Pie Pod had gone off with no one in it. Just as Marc and crew went to see what was going on, a large burst of cream suddenly burst out, soaking the girl.

===Pie Coaster===
Replacing the Pie Slide for the second season of the show, this was a mini roller coaster which ended with an audience member crashing into an oversized pie which stood on its side. At first the contestant would crash through some paper &quot;What Would You Do?&quot; banners before crashing into the giant pie. The participant usually got hit multiple times as he rocked back and forth on the final dip, where the pie was located; however, since participants were required to wear a large helmet with a full-face clear shield when on the Pie Coaster, the messiness relative to the other devices was severely limited.

A trip to the Pie Coaster via the Wall O&#x27; Stuff would be heralded by one of the two following poems: &quot;You didn&#x27;t win a car, you didn&#x27;t win a toaster. You won a free ticket on our famous Pie Coaster.&quot; or &quot;We&#x27;ve got a one-track mind, and so will you, a trip down the Pie Coaster on &quot;What Would You Do?&quot;.&quot;

==Other features==
===Musical Pies===
In addition, the show often featured pieing-related variations on games such as Musical chairs, Simon Says, Rock paper scissors, and &quot;One potato, two potato&quot;. In &quot;Musical Chairs&quot; (redubbed &quot;Musical Pies&quot;), contestants seated together in a row passed around a cream pie while music played, when the music stopped, the person left holding the pie had to stick it into his or her face, and if the person refused, a family member or friend might be called down to pie him or her. The winner was awarded a &quot;real&quot; pie (i.e. a cherry or apple pie) to take home. This was also featured on Slime Time Live.

===Family Challenges===
The second season often featured &quot;family challenge&quot; games which pitted entire families against each other in performing certain activities; the family with the fewest pied members when the game was over would be declared the winner. On other occasions, one family was divided into several teams (ladies vs. men, kids vs. parents, etc.) Most of the time the winning team got to choose from getting a token to the &quot;Wall o&#x27; Stuff&quot; for each winning team member, or sending the losing team member(s) to a pie device.

===Pie-a-Thons===
A handful of episodes during the first season, promoted as &quot;Pie-a-Thons&quot;, were made up entirely of stunts, games and activities featuring pies and also pitted the children in the audience against the adults. In a departure from normal shows, the winners could pie themselves, thus earning points for their team. One popular &quot;Pie-a-Thon&quot; feature was the &quot;Pie Lottery&quot;, in which each member of the audience was assigned a number and any person whose number was called would be given the opportunity to pie themselves; on rare occasions, a person who did not wish to pie themselves would get to pie a family member or friend or someone else of their choosing.

At the end of the show, one child and one adult would stand by the Pie Slide and exchange two envelopes repeatedly until a buzzer sounded. At that point, the audience would vote on who should go down the Pie Slide. The winner of the vote went down the pie slide, then opened their envelope. One of the envelopes hid a zero, the other hid either a 50 or a 100. Each participant earned their team the number of points in their envelope (if the winner of the vote had the zero, the other would have to go down the Pie Slide in order to collect the points); usually it would be enough to win the show. On one occasion, the child (a teenage girl) won the vote and got to ride the Pie Slide head first; her envelope hid a 100, thus winning the show for the &quot;kids&quot;, her competitor adult (a young man) was given the opportunity to ride the Pie Slide anyway, and ended up with the upper half of his body completely covered in pie.

===Roving Camera===
The first season of &quot;What Would You Do?&quot; also often featured segments taped as the show&#x27;s crew traversed the Nickelodeon Studios theme park in Orlando searching for participants. The activities in which volunteers participated were sometimes pie-related (i.e. &quot;Do an impression of a cartoon character being hit with a pie&quot;, or being given the choice of pieing themselves or someone else of their choosing), but more often involved performing a stunt or a &quot;Candid Camera&quot; or &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;-style &quot;hidden camera&quot; prank.

==Personnel change==
Robin Marrella left the series in 1993 – due to, according to Summers, a disagreement over pay – but continued to work with Summers on &quot;Double Dare&quot; (at that time, &quot;Family Double Dare&quot;). Instead of a permanent replacement, a kid from the audience was picked to be &quot;Co-Host of the Day&quot; for the remainder of the series&#x27; run, expanding on the show&#x27;s audience participation theme. Co-hosts assisted Marc by providing pies and other props for the games and stunts, and also participated in the Wall O&#x27;Stuff by operating the lottery by which audience members earned participation. When this outlived its usefulness (the kids were often very shy), a chimpanzee named Corey was brought on stage to hand Summers props and supply primate-related jokes through voiceover acting.

==Reruns==
Reruns aired on Nickelodeon until July 4, 1999, and on Nick GAS from 1999–2002. After cancellation, Nickelodeon decided to go back and redub the ending theme on most of the 1991 episodes with the 1993 one, and add parting gift prizes that never existed before. Only a handful of 1991 episodes retained the original ending theme.

Despite the show&#x27;s popularity, Summers himself hated hosting the program as he thought it was odd and didn&#x27;t like doing a Nickelodeon Studios tour show.

<text>In political campaigns, an attack ad is an advertisement designed to wage a personal attack against an opposing candidate or political party in order to gain support for the attacking candidate and attract voters. Attack ads often form part of negative campaigning or smear campaigns, and in large or well-financed campaigns, may be disseminated via mass media.

An attack ad will generally unfairly criticize an opponent&#x27;s political platform, usually by pointing out its faults. Often the ad will simply make use of innuendo, based on opposition research. Political attack ads across all types of media can have different strategic aims. Some are character attacks, trying to persuade the viewer to think differently about a candidate&#x27;s character in hopes that they will reconsider their perception of the candidate and who they are as a person. Another strategy is an attack on the candidate&#x27;s policy or political ideas. This attempts to derail one&#x27;s support for a candidate by persuading them that the candidate-under-attack&#x27;s political ideas are illogical, extreme, or will be ineffective.

Televised attack ads rose to prominence in the United States in the 1960s, especially since Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations require over-the-air commercial TV stations with licenses issued by the FCC—effectively all regulated TV stations, since others would either be public television or be pirated—to air political ads by both parties, whether it be attack ads or more traditional political ads. Although cable television and the Internet are not required to air such ads, attack ads have become commonplace on both media as well.

==Examples==

===United States===

One of the earliest and most famous television attack ads, known as &quot;Daisy&quot;, was used by Lyndon B. Johnson against Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election. The ad opened with a young girl innocently picking petals from a daisy, while a man&#x27;s voice performed a countdown to zero. It then zoomed in to an extreme close-up to her eye, and cut to an image of a nuclear explosion. The ad was shocking and disturbing, but also very effective. It convinced many that Goldwater&#x27;s more aggressive approach to fighting the Cold War could result in a nuclear conflict.

During the 1968 presidential election, Vice President Hubert Humphrey made a political ad against candidate Spiro Agnew with Humphrey laughing on the TV screen showing the text &quot;Agnew, for vice president?&quot;. The ad ended with a quote &quot;This would be funny, if it weren&#x27;t so serious...&quot; and it also ended with Humphrey coughing due to his non-stop laughter.

Attack ads were used again by the campaign of George H. W. Bush against Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential election. The two most famous were the &quot;Willie Horton&quot; and &quot;Tank Ride&quot; ads. The &quot;Willie Horton&quot; ad began with a statement of Vice President Bush&#x27;s support of the death penalty. Then it described the case of Willie Horton, who was convicted of murder. The ad stated that Governor Dukakis&#x27;s prison furlough program (unsupervised weekend passes from Massachusetts prison) released Horton ten times; in one of those furloughs, he kidnapped a young couple, stabbed the boy and repeatedly raped the girl. The ad ended with, &quot;Weekend prison passes. Dukakis on crime.&quot;

The &quot;Tank Ride&quot; ad from 1988 was an attack on Dukakis by the GOP. It created a lasting negative impression and helped guarantee Dukakis&#x27; defeat. The ad suggested that Bush was more supportive of military spending and weapons programs than Dukakis. The footage, pulled from the news media, showed Dukakis riding a tank in his attempt to counter the claim that he was weak on defense. He wore a large, oversized helmet and a wide smile, which was used by the GOP to insinuate that he was a fool. The GOP also added gear sounds from an 18-wheeler truck to imply that Dukakis could not run the tank smoothly – although tanks do not have gears that grind.

The 2008 Democratic presidential primaries featured an ad by Hillary Clinton directed at her main rival at the time, Barack Obama, which aired days before the Texas primary. The ad began by showing children asleep in bed while phone rang in the background. A voice-over stated that it was 3 a.m., the phone was ringing in the White House, and that &quot;something&#x27;s happening in the world&quot;. The voice-over then asked voters if they wanted someone who &quot;already knows the world&#x27;s leaders, knows the military&quot; and is &quot;tested and ready to lead in a dangerous world&quot; to pick up the phone. While Obama was never mentioned by name, the implication was clear and the ad set off a firestorm of discussion and controversy, causing even Obama himself to respond and describe it as an ad that &quot;play[ed] on people&#x27;s fears&quot;, predicting it would not work. Later in the campaign, after Obama had become the Democratic nominee, Republican nominee John McCain echoed a similar sentiment. In a controversial ad called &quot;Celebrity&quot;, McCain&#x27;s campaign asked, &quot;[Barack Obama] is the biggest celebrity in the world. But, is he ready to lead?&quot; The ad juxtaposed Obama supporters with photos of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton.

By 2010, attack ads had spread online as political candidates published their ads on YouTube. Carly Fiorina, a Republican candidate from California, released a video on YouTube depicting former Republican opponent Tom Campbell as a &quot;Fiscal conservative in name only”.

===Mexico===

The first attack ads of the 2006 Mexican general election were launched by the conservative National Action Party against Andrés Manuel López Obrador; the ad claimed that López Obrador&#x27;s &quot;populistic&quot; proposals would drive Mexico further into economic crisis and bankruptcy. The Party of the Democratic Revolution answered with attack ads against the current president Felipe Calderón, claiming that he was partly culpable for the 1994 economic crisis; since Calderón was running with a motto of &quot;the president of employment&quot;, the ads closed with, &quot;dirty hands, zero employments&quot;. After López Obrador alleged that Calderón was illegally patronizing his brother-in-law Hildebrando Zavala, the tagline was changed to &quot;dirty hands, one employment for his brother-in-law&quot;.

===Canada===
Although it has been found that Canadian elections are less likely to use attack ads than US elections, there has been an increasingly strong presence of negative ads in Canadian campaigns in modern times. Comparatively, Canadians were more likely to use acclaim ads- or ads that praise another individual- than Americans, as American campaigns are much more likely to use attack ads than Canadian campaigns. Overall, however, Canadian campaigns are more likely to use attack ads than acclaim ads, similarly to the US. Famous examples of Canadian attack ads include the 1993 Chrétien attack ad during the 1993 Canadian federal election, and the 2006 Liberal Party of Canada election ads during the 2006 Canadian federal election, both of which were widely criticized and ultimately managed to improve the electoral results of the candidates being targeted by the ads.

=== Philippines ===
During the 2016 general election campaign, presidential candidate and Senator Antonio Trillanes launched negative advertisements that featured six children against presidential candidate and Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte on ABS-CBN a few days before the election on May 9, 2016.

The 30-second advertisement showing each of the six children (four boys and two girls) briefly criticizes the video clips shown: Duterte&#x27;s remarks of &quot;killing everybody&quot;, his cursing on Pope Francis, yelling &quot;Mabuhay ang NPA&quot; (), kissing a woman and his comments about the rape-slay on the Australian missionary, the remarks of his war on drug campaign &quot;would be bloody&quot; should Duterte elected president, and finally raising his blurred middle finger.

The advertisement drew criticism from Duterte&#x27;s supporters on social media. A 72-hour temporary restraining order was issued by Taguig Regional Trial Court to stop ABS-CBN and its TV stations from airing the negative advertisement. Duterte&#x27;s running mate, vice-presidential candidate Alan Peter Cayetano, accused President Benigno Aquino III; two other rivals, Mar Roxas and Grace Poe; and ABS-CBN of conspiracy for making the ad. Former PCOO Secretary Sonny Coloma denied the conspiracy claim made by Cayetano. Prior to the airing of the ad, the ABS-CBN Corporation issued a statement that the ad had been reviewed to the ethics committee, complied with election laws, and was allowed to air. Later, TV5 refused to air the controversial ad, the TV5 Network stating that the ad had not met requirements.

On February 24, 2020, during the Senate hearing on the ABS-CBN franchise renewal, GMA Network, Inc. First Vice President for Legal Affairs, Maria Luz Delfin clarified that the GMA Network had not aired the ad, stating that it was disapproved by the internal election committee.

===Non-political usage===
While attack ads have primarily been relegated for political usage, there have been some instances of private businesses running them. In 2013, Highmark, a healthcare company associated with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) were unable to reach an agreement on whether Highmark&#x27;s insurance would be accepted at UPMC. Highmark also entered into negotiations to acquire the struggling West Penn Allegheny Health System; Highmark and UPMC then started airing attack ads at each other. Both parties&#x27; ads accused the other of pushing patients with their respective health insurance plans to hospitals operated by their respective health insurance provider, as well as attacking each other&#x27;s nonprofit status. At the same year, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon began airing attack ads against each other.

== Effect on voter turnout ==
Studies suggest that attack ads have no effect on voter turnout in the United States. There is, in fact, a noted negative impact on voter turnout by some researches, but it has no bearing on the evidence as it is statistically insignificant. The only case in which evidence reveals a correlation between negative advertising and voter turnout is for &quot;late&quot; negativity. This is when two conditions exist for the voter: they have already selected their preferred candidate and the attack and the negativity is about their selected candidate. If these two conditions exist, there is a negative effect on voter turnout. In this case, a forty percent increase in &quot;late&quot; negative ads will decrease the likelihood of turnout by 0.087, and a sixty percent increase in late ads merits a 0.145 decrease in turnout. Thus, the only case in which attack ads have been found to effect on voter turn out is when the voter has already selected their candidate, as they realize that their candidate is potentially no better than the alternative options.

==Effectiveness==
Studies claim that 82% of Americans dislike attack ads, and 53% believe that the &quot;ethics and values&quot; of election campaigns have worsened since 1985. The voting public see attack ads as an element of smear campaigning. Other research indicates that voters are open to candidates attacking each other if the issues in question are &quot;appropriate&quot;. In a 1999 survey of Virginia voters, 80.7% felt it is fair for a candidate to criticize an opponent for &quot;talking one way and voting another&quot;, though but only 7.7% feel it is fair for a candidate to attack an opponent for the &quot;behavior of his/her family members&quot;.

Political operatives, however, have found attack ads to be useful, and social psychologists claim that negative information has a tendency &quot;to be more influential than equally extreme or equally likely positive information&quot;. University of Toronto professor Scott Hawkins &quot;suggests that even a mention in the media that a candidate or party is planning to run negative advertisements can be beneficial, since it plants seeds of doubt in the voter&#x27;s mind, especially early in the campaign when voters tend to be less involved. If the reported claims turn up in advertisements later in the campaign, they already seem familiar to the voter.&quot;

In the United States, researchers have consistently found that negative advertising has positive effects. Negative advertising &quot;is likely to stimulate voters by increasing the degree to which they care about the election&#x27;s outcome or by increasing ties to their party&#x27;s nominee;&quot; it makes the election seem more important, and thus increases voter turnout. Other research has found that negative advertisements only appeal to partisan voters, and that it alienates independents, causing elections to be fought among partisan extremes.

===Backfires===
If an ad is seen as going too far or being &quot;too personal&quot;, voters may turn against the party that put the ad out. For example, in the Canada 1993 federal election, the Progressive Conservative (PC) Party attacked Liberal Party leader Jean Chrétien by implicitly mocking his Bell&#x27;s Palsy partial facial paralysis. Outrage followed, and the PC Party&#x27;s image was badly damaged in the polls. Similar backlash happened to the Liberal Party of Canada in the 2006 federal election, when they created an attack ad suggesting that Conservative leader Stephen Harper would use armed Canadian soldiers to police major cities. Though the ads were never aired, they diminished the believability of other ads by the Liberal Party. A leaked copy, broadcast on the news, offended many Canadians, particularly the military, some of whom were fighting in Afghanistan at the time.

In the run up to, and in the 2015 Canadian federal election itself, Justin Trudeau, Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada and the son of Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, was subjected to a sustained negative ad campaign by the Conservative Party of Canada. However, the &quot;Just Not Ready&quot; campaign was judged by the public as unfair and mocking of the Liberal leader. More importantly, the advertising campaign lowered public expectations of Trudeau&#x27;s performance that even Conservative personnel noted that he would impress people if he showed any display of competence in public events such as the televised debates. That proved to be the case, and Trudeau took advantage of the public&#x27;s low expectations to impress the public with his articulate and passionate manner to garner support throughout the campaign until his party won a majority government.

In 2006, Republican challenger Paul R. Nelson campaigned against Democrat Ron Kind for a seat in the United States House of Representatives. Nelson&#x27;s ad stated, &quot;Ron Kind has no trouble spending your money, he&#x27;d just rather spend it on sex,&quot; and, &quot;Instead of spending money on cancer research, Ron Kind voted to spend your money to study the sex lives of Vietnamese prostitutes.&quot; Nelson&#x27;s challenge fell short, as Ron Kind was reelected, while the attack&#x27;s outrageous presentation provoked an uproar from Republicans and Democrats alike. A 1999 survey showed that challengers lose almost 3 points on the feeling thermometer (a 100-point scale used to assess survey-takers feelings on certain issues) when a candidate engages in mudslinging. The study also shows that the influence of negativity is less powerful for challengers than for incumbents.

== Front groups ==
Campaigns often establish or support front groups (organizations that appear to be independent voluntary associations or charity) to run counter-attack ads. This technique ties into the wider practice of astroturfing. Former political speechwriter Leonard Steinhorn points out that &quot;issue ads&quot; run by front groups use deceptive names to hide their true sponsors – such as the pharmaceutical industry-backed United Seniors Association, which spent $17 million on ads during the 2000 US presidential election. As front ads are not controlled by the candidates they support, the candidates are insulated from criticism.

== Popular culture ==
George Orwell&#x27;s dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; includes mention of the &quot;Two Minutes Hate&quot;, a routine in which workers are subject to films encouraging distrust, fear and hatred towards the enemies of Big Brother.

<doc id="739672" wikidata="Q3038014" url="?curid=739672" title="Douglas Jardine">
<text>Douglas Robert Jardine ( 1900 – 1958) was an English cricketer who played 22 Test matches for England, captaining the side in 15 of those matches between 1931 and 1934. A right-handed batsman, he is best known for captaining the English team during their successful 1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia. During that series, England employed &quot;Bodyline&quot; tactics against the Australian batsmen, headed by Donald Bradman, wherein bowlers pitched the ball short on the line of leg stump to rise towards the bodies of the batsmen in a manner that some contemporary players and critics viewed as intimidatory and physically dangerous. As captain, Jardine was the person responsible for the implementation of Bodyline.

A controversial figure among cricketers, partially for what was perceived by some to be an arrogant manner, he was well known for his dislike of Australian players and crowds, and thus was unpopular in Australia, especially so after the Bodyline tour where he continued use of dangerous bowling tactics injured a number of opposing players and was considered to be contrary to the ‘spirit of cricket’ that English cricketers aspired to. However, many who played under his leadership regarded him as an excellent and dedicated captain. He was also famous in cricket circles for wearing a multi-coloured Harlequin cap.

After establishing an early reputation as a prolific schoolboy batsman, Jardine played cricket for Winchester College, attended the University of Oxford, playing for its cricket team, and then played for Surrey County Cricket Club as an amateur. He developed a stubborn, defensive method of batting which was considered unusual for an amateur at the time, and he received occasional criticism for negative batting. Nonetheless, Jardine was selected in Test matches for the first time in 1928, and went on to play with some success in the Test series in Australia in 1928–29. Following this tour, his business commitments prevented him from playing as much cricket. However, in 1931, he was asked to captain England in a Test against New Zealand. Although there were some initial misgivings about his captaincy, Jardine led England in the next three cricket seasons and on two overseas tours, one of which was the Australian tour of 1932–33. Of his 15 Tests as captain, he won nine, drew five and lost only one. He retired from all first-class cricket in 1934 following a tour to India and he was advised that, due to his continued use of Bodyline tactics and subsequent civil unrest in India in response, he would no longer be appointed as the English captain.

Although Jardine was a qualified solicitor he did not work much in law, choosing instead to devote most of his working life to banking and, later on, journalism. He joined the Territorial Army in the Second World War and spent most of it posted in India. After the war, he worked as company secretary at a paper manufacturer and also returned to journalism. While on a business trip in 1957, he became ill with what proved to be lung cancer and died, aged 57, in 1958.

==Early life==
Douglas Jardine was born on 23 October 1900 in Bombay, British India, to Scottish parents, Malcolm Jardine—a former first-class cricketer who became a barrister—and Alison Moir. At the age of nine, he was sent to St Andrews in Scotland to stay with his mother&#x27;s sister. He attended Horris Hill School, near Newbury, Berkshire, from May 1910. There, Jardine was moderately successful academically, and from 1912, he played cricket for the school first eleven, enjoying success as a bowler and as a batsman. He led the team in his final year, and the team were unbeaten under his captaincy. As a schoolboy, Jardine was influenced by the writing of former England captain C. B. Fry on batting technique, which contradicted the advice of his coach at Horris Hill. The coach disapproved of Jardine&#x27;s batting methods, but Jardine did not back down and quoted a book by Fry to support his viewpoint.

In 1914, Jardine entered Winchester College. At the time, life for pupils at Winchester was arduous and austere; discipline was harsh. Sport and exercise were vital parts of the school day. In Jardine&#x27;s time, preparing the pupils for war was also important. According to Jardine&#x27;s biographer, Christopher Douglas, the pupils were &quot;taught to be honest, practical, impervious to physical pain, uncomplaining and civilised.&quot; All pupils were required to be academically competent and as such Jardine was able to get along satisfactorily without exhibiting academic brilliance; successful sportsmen, on the other hand, were revered. Jardine enjoyed a slightly better position than some pupils, already possessing a reputation as a very fine cricketer and excelling at other sports; he represented the school at football as a goalkeeper and rackets, and played Winchester College football. But it was at cricket that he particularly excelled. He was in the first eleven for three years from 1917 and received coaching from Harry Altham, Rockley Wilson and Schofield Haigh, the latter two of whom were distinguished cricketers. In 1919, his final year, Jardine came top of the school batting averages with 997 runs at an average of 66.46. He also became captain despite some doubts within the school about his ability to unify the team. Under Jardine, Winchester won their annual match against Eton College in 1919, a fixture in which Eton had usually held the upper hand. Jardine&#x27;s batting (35 and 89 in the match) and captaincy were key factors in his side&#x27;s first victory over Eton for 12 years. Years later, after his retirement from cricket, he named his 89 in that match as his personal favourite innings. Jardine went on to score 135 not out against Harrow School.

Jardine&#x27;s achievements in the season were widely reported in the local and national press. He played two representative matches, for the best schoolboy cricketers, at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground, scored 44, 91, 57 and 55 and won favourable reviews in the press. &quot;Wisden&quot;, in 1928, described Jardine at this time as being obviously of a much higher standard than his contemporaries, particularly in defence and on side batting. However, he was criticised for being occasionally too cautious and not using all the batting strokes of which he was capable—his good batting technique gave the impression that he could easily score more quickly if he so desired.

==First-class career==

===Oxford University===
Jardine entered New College, Oxford, in September 1919 at a time when the university was more crowded than usual due to the arrival of men whose entrance had been delayed due to the war. He took part in several sports, representing New College as goalkeeper in matches between the colleges, and being given a trial for the university football team, although he was not chosen. He continued to play rackets and began to play real tennis, making such progress and showing such promise that he went on to represent the university successfully and won his Blue. In cricket, Jardine came under the coaching of Tom Hayward who influenced his footwork and defence. &quot;Wisden&quot; commented in 1928 that Jardine had come with an excellent reputation, but did not quite achieve the success which was expected. His batting ability, particularly defensively, remained unquestioned.

In the 1920 season, Jardine made his first-class debut, played eight first-class matches and scored two fifties. Playing mainly as an opening batsman, he won his Blue, appearing in the University Match against Cambridge but fell short of expectations, and continued to be criticised for over-caution with the bat. In all, he scored 217 runs at an average of 22.64. In the match for Oxford against Essex, he took six wickets for six runs in a bowling spell of 45 balls, bowling leg breaks, to have bowling figures of six for 28. It was the only occasion in his career where he took five or more wickets in an innings.

Playing more confidently and fluently in 1921, Jardine began the season well, scoring three fifties in his first three first-class matches. Oxford then played against the Australian touring side which dominated the season. In the second innings, Jardine scored 96 not out to save the game but was unable to complete his century before the game ended. The innings was praised by those who saw it and the Australians were criticised in the press for not allowing Jardine to reach his hundred, particularly as the match had been reduced from three days to two at their request. They had tried to help him with some easy bowling but the situation was confusing as batsmen&#x27;s scores were not displayed on the ground&#x27;s scoreboard. Some critics have speculated that this incident led to Jardine&#x27;s later hatred of Australians, although Christopher Douglas does not believe this. Cricket historian David Frith believes that Australian captain Warwick Armstrong may have addressed sarcastic comments to Jardine but &quot;Wisden&quot; blamed Jardine himself for batting too slowly to score a century. The Australian manager expressed regret that he missed out. This innings was the highest that had been played to that point in the season against the Australians, and only one higher score was made before the first Test. Consequently, Plum Warner, an influential figure who had recently captained Middlesex, suggested in &quot;The Cricketer&quot; magazine that Jardine should play for England in the first Test, which followed the Oxford match. Warner had been previously impressed by Jardine. The latter remained in Test contention for a short time, but was not selected. In the meantime, he scored his maiden first-class hundred against The Army and another followed against Sussex. Both innings were cautious, with defence his main priority for much of the innings, but he failed in the match against Cambridge.

Jardine played for Surrey, for whom he was qualified, in the remainder of the season. He replaced the injured Jack Hobbs as an opening batsman before dropping down the order to number five on Hobbs&#x27; return. In a situation of great pressure, Jardine scored a vital 55 in an important match against reigning County Champions Middlesex, although Surrey lost the game. Jardine finished the season with 1,015 first-class runs at an average of 39.03, although critics argued that he was still yet to fulfill his full potential.

Jardine missed most of the 1922 season owing to a serious knee injury; he played only four matches at a time when he was expected to make a big impression. He missed Oxford&#x27;s match against Cambridge and was unable to play for Surrey at all that season. Even so, in 1922 he was selected by &quot;The Isis&quot; as one of its men of the year. After some problems with his troublesome knee, Jardine returned to cricket by May of the 1923 season. He was not given the Oxford captaincy in his final year, which has led to later speculation that his manner and unfriendliness was held against him. However, his persistent injury and the availability of other deserving candidates may have provided some of the explanation. Jardine gradually found his batting form, and contributed to Oxford&#x27;s only win over Cambridge in the decade. During one innings of another match, he received criticism for using his pads to stop the ball from hitting the wickets: this was fully within the laws of the game but was considered controversial, being seen by critics to be against the spirit of the game. Christopher Douglas traces Jardine&#x27;s hostility towards the press and critics to this incident. He also received criticism for his slow batting for Oxford, again being singled out due to his known ability to play attacking shots. Partly this was because Jardine held a responsible position, with the team often reliant on his personal success. The complaints against him were a manifestation of wider criticism of young amateur batting at the time for its supposed lack of verve and enterprise, as older commentators began to hark back to the &quot;golden age&quot; before the war. Jardine left Oxford in 1923 having scored a total of 1,381 runs and was awarded a fourth class degree in modern history.

When Jardine went on to play for Surrey that season, and now in an already strong batting side, he played with more freedom. Batting at number five, he had to adapt his style depending on the match situation. He was successful, playing either long defensive innings or sacrificing his innings in an attempt to hit quick runs. His captain Percy Fender retained him in the role for the rest of the season. He scored his first century for Surrey against Yorkshire and was awarded his County Cap, making 916 runs at an average of 38.16 in the whole season.

===County cricketer===
Once Jardine left Oxford, he began to qualify as a solicitor while still playing for Surrey. He made steady progress over the next three seasons but was overshadowed by other amateur batsmen. His contemporaries at Oxford and Cambridge attracted more attention in the press, as did the next generation of amateur batsmen. He was appointed vice-captain to Fender for the 1924 season. Several professionals, such as Jack Hobbs, could have been made vice-captain, but Jardine was preferred as an amateur. In that season, Jardine was selected for the Gentlemen v Players match for the first time and came third in the Surrey averages. In all first-class matches, he scored 1,249 runs at an average of 40.29. In the following season, Jardine was less successful, scoring fewer runs at a lower average and with a highest score of 87 (1,020 runs at 30.90). Suggestions made in the press that Jardine should captain the Gentlemen with a view towards the future of the England Test team, were ignored. In the event, owing to an ankle injury sustained playing village cricket, he was unable to appear in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord&#x27;s. In 1926, Jardine had his most successful season to date, with 1,473 runs (average 46.03), although he was again overshadowed by other players and by the attention given to the Ashes series being played. Towards the end of the season, his batting became more attractive and his rate of scoring increased as he began to play more attacking shots. His assurance and judgement against all bowling, even international bowlers, increased and he scored 538 runs in his final ten innings.

In 1927, Jardine achieved his highest average in a season, scoring 1,002 runs and averaging 91.09 in a very wet summer which led to difficult wickets to bat on. &quot;Wisden&quot; named him as one of its Cricketers of the Year, commenting that he had improved his style and footwork. That season, he only played 11 matches due to work commitments as a clerk with Barings Bank, for whom he had worked since qualifying as a solicitor. Despite his comparative lack of practice, he scored centuries in his first three matches and came top of the Surrey batting averages. He scored a century in the Gentlemen v Players match, which impressed influential observers at Lord&#x27;s, and represented England in a trial match against The Rest. In this latter match, when Percy Chapman withdrew at the last minute, Jardine took over the captaincy, earning praise in the press for his performance. By this stage, he was considered a certainty to tour Australia the following winter.

===Test cricketer===
Jardine&#x27;s batting performance in 1928 was similar to that from the previous season. He played 14 matches, scoring 1,133 runs at an average of 87.15. He was successful in high-profile matches, scoring 193 for Gentlemen at the Oval, where the crowd had booed his slow start (at one stage, he took half an hour to score two runs) but later cheered him as his last fifty runs were scored in half an hour. For the same team at Lord&#x27;s, he scored 86 and 40. He captained The Rest against England in a Test trial and made the highest score in each innings, scoring 74 not out in the fourth innings to help his team to draw the game on a difficult pitch, against international bowlers Maurice Tate and Harold Larwood.

Immediately after this match, Jardine made his Test debut against the West Indies who were touring England that season. This was West Indies&#x27; first ever Test match. The team possessed several fast bowlers who had enjoyed some success on the tour of England. Many batsmen only played them with difficulty, particularly on the occasional fast-paced pitch, but Jardine played them confidently. Jardine played in the first two Tests, both of which were won by England by an innings, but missed the third for reasons that were not revealed. He scored 22 on his debut, but was more successful in the second Test, scoring 83. During this innings, when he had scored 26, he accidentally hit his wicket when setting off for a run but was given not out. At the time, the laws of the game stated that a batsman was not out if he had completed his shot and was setting off for a run; the West Indian cricketer Learie Constantine believed that Jardine was only given not out because he told the umpire his shot was complete. Later, while he was batting with Tate, a player with whom he did not have a good relationship, Jardine was run out when Tate refused to go for a run.

===First tour to Australia===

Jardine was selected to tour Australia with the M.C.C. team in 1928–29 as part of a very strong batting side, playing in all five Test matches and scoring 341 runs at an average of 42.62. In all first-class matches, he scored 1,168 runs (average 64.88). He was also on the five-man selection committee for the tour, which chose teams to play in specific games but had not chosen the touring party. &quot;Wisden&quot; judged that he had been as great a success as had been expected and impressed everyone with the strength of his defensive shots and his play on the back foot. It said that he played some delightful innings. Percy Fender, covering the tour as a journalist, believed that Jardine never had the chance to play a normal innings in the Test, having to provide the stability to the batting, and often seeming to come out to bat in a crisis.

Jardine was the centre of attention at the start of the tour. He began the tour with three consecutive hundreds and was seen as one of the main English threats. In his first hundred, the crowd engaged in some good-natured joking at Jardine&#x27;s expense, but he was jeered by the crowd in his second hundred for batting too slowly. His third hundred was described by Bradman as one of the finest exhibitions of strokeplay that he had seen; Jardine accelerated after another slow start, during which he was again barracked, to play some excellent shots. The crowds took an increasing dislike to him, partially for his success with the bat, but mainly for his superior attitude and bearing, his awkward fielding, and particularly his choice of headwear. His first public action in South Australia was to take out the members of the South Australian team who had been to Oxford or Cambridge Universities. Then, he wore a Harlequin cap, given to people who played good cricket at Oxford. It was not unusual for Oxford and Cambridge cricketers to wear similar caps while batting, as both Jardine and M.C.C. captain Percy Chapman did so on this tour, although it was slightly unorthodox to wear them while fielding. However, this was neither understood nor acceptable to the Australian crowds. They quickly took exception to the importance he seemed to place on class distinction. Although Jardine may simply have worn the cap out of superstition, it conveyed a negative impression to the spectators, with his general demeanour drawing one comment of &quot;Where&#x27;s the butler to carry the bat for you?&quot; Jardine&#x27;s cap became a focus for criticism and mockery from the crowds throughout the tour. Nevertheless, Jack Fingleton later claimed that Jardine could still have brought the crowds onto his side by exchanging jokes or pleasantries with them. It is certain that Jardine by this stage had developed an intense dislike for Australian crowds. During his third century at the start of the tour, during a period of abuse from the spectators, he observed to a sympathetic Hunter Hendry that &quot;All Australians are uneducated, and an unruly mob&quot;. After the innings, when Patsy Hendren said that the Australian crowds did not like Jardine, he replied &quot;It&#x27;s fucking mutual&quot;. Due to the large number of good close fielders in the side, Jardine did not field in the slips, his usual position for Surrey, but next to the crowd on the boundary. There, he was roundly abused and mocked, particularly when chasing the ball: he was not a good fielder on the boundary. In one of the Test matches, he spat towards the crowd while fielding on the boundary as he changed position for the final time.

In the first Test, Jardine scored 35 and 65 not out. His first innings began with England in an uncertain position, having lost three wickets for 108 on a very good batting wicket. His innings led England to a stronger position. He played very cautiously, being troubled by Clarrie Grimmett and Bert Ironmonger, the Australian spinners. Jardine believed that Ironmonger threw the ball, and this bowler gave him considerable trouble throughout his career. Thanks to the bowling of Harold Larwood, England took a huge first innings lead. In his second innings, although he played well in his 65, Jardine was not under much pressure. He scored a large number of singles, giving his partners most of the bowling and building up the lead to the point where England achieved a massive victory by 675 runs. This victory surprised and troubled the Australian cricketing public. Jardine played a similar role in the second Test, batting with Wally Hammond to retrieve a poor start for England in his only innings as they won by eight wickets. Jardine scored 62 in the third Test, supporting Hammond who made a double century. However, when Australia batted a second time, they built up a big lead and left England needing 332 to win on an exceptionally bad wicket which had been damaged by rain. Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe, in one of their most famous partnerships, put on 105. Hobbs sent a message to the team that Jardine should be the next batsmen to come in, even though he usually batted later on, as he was the batsman most likely to survive in the conditions. When Hobbs was dismissed, Jardine came in to bat. He survived, although finding batting exceptionally difficult, until the day&#x27;s play ended. Percy Fender believed that Jardine was the only batsman in the side who could have coped with the difficult conditions. He went on to make 33 next day, and England won by three wickets.

During the team&#x27;s brief visit to Tasmania, Jardine made his highest first-class score of 214. In the fourth Test, Jardine only scored one run in the first innings, before he was given out leg before wicket (lbw) despite obviously hitting the ball. In the second innings, coming out to bat with the score 21 for two, Jardine scored 98 in a partnership of 262 with Hammond which was then the highest partnership for the third wicket in all Test matches. The scoring was very slow, and the crowd protested throughout Jardine&#x27;s innings, even though he scored faster than Hammond. He was out when &quot;Wisden&quot; believed he looked certain to reach a century. England went on to win the match by 12 runs.

Jardine was not successful in the final Test, won by Australia. He was used as an opener, due to an injury to Sutcliffe, and made just 19 and a first ball duck. Once both of his innings were completed, on the fifth day of a match which lasted eight days, he left the match and set off across Australia to catch a boat to India for a holiday. It is not clear if this was planned or if he had simply had enough. Jardine never provided an explanation, to the Australian press nor afterwards. Later, Jardine wrote about the Australian crowds, complaining over their involvement, but praising their knowledge and judgement of the game and describing them as more informed than English crowds. He also expressed later reservations to Bob Wyatt about Percy Chapman, saying that he would have shot him if a gun was available. Jardine did not appear in first-class cricket in the 1929 season due to business commitments.

==England captain==
===Appointment as captain===
At the beginning of the 1930 season, Jardine was offered the vice-captaincy of Surrey. He was unable to accept owing to business commitments and played just nine matches for the season, scoring 402 runs at an average of 36.54 and managing one century and one fifty. He was never in the running for Test selection that season, although his presence may have been missed as the English batting was unreliable in the Tests. Christopher Douglas argues that had Jardine been playing regularly, he would have been made captain for the final Test, when Chapman was dropped in favour of the sounder batsman Bob Wyatt. The sensation of the Test series was Donald Bradman, who dominated the English bowling to score 974 runs with unprecedented speed and certainty, making the English selectors realise that something must be done to address his skill. With Bradman at the fore, Australia regained the Ashes 2–1.

Jardine played a full season of cricket in 1931. In June, he was appointed as captain for the Test against New Zealand (two more Tests were later added). The English selectors were searching for possible captains for the 1932–33 tour of Australia, with Bradman and Australia&#x27;s strong batting line up foremost in their minds. Christopher Douglas believes that, as Jardine was not a regular county captain, the selectors wanted to assess his leadership ability but had probably not settled on him as a final choice. He was also chosen as a dependable, proven batsman. While Percy Fender approved of his appointment, &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27; correspondent believed that he was unproven and others were more deserving of the leadership. Ian Peebles, writing 40 years later, claimed that Jardine&#x27;s appointment was popular but cricket administrators had misgivings. Alan Gibson believed that Jardine was chosen because the other candidates were either not worth their place in the side, too old or had controversy attached to them. Furthermore, Jardine impressed the chairman of selectors, Pelham Warner, who stated that he was very effective in selection meetings through his knowledge of cricket history and went into great detail to choose the correct players; it seems that Warner was the driving force behind Jardine&#x27;s appointment.

In his first Test as captain, Jardine clashed with several players. Frank Woolley was unhappy with his captain&#x27;s manner, feeling humiliated at his treatment in the field at one point. He also rebuked Ian Peebles and Walter Robins, two young amateur bowlers, for their amusement over an incident in the match. The home team&#x27;s fortunes were mixed, as New Zealand put up a very good fight in their first Test in England, and both sides could have won. The New Zealanders were so successful that a further two Tests were arranged. Jardine was criticised in the press for not instructing his batsmen to score quickly enough to win in the fourth innings, although this strategy was unlikely to succeed, and the match was drawn. England won the second Test by an innings and the third Test was drawn, sealing the series 1–0. Jardine had a top score of just 38 in the series, but only batted four times and was not out in three of the innings. At the beginning of the following season, &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; editor believed that, as Jardine had failed to impress (unspecified) people with his captaincy, he was no longer a certainty to lead the side to Australia, and only Percy Chapman&#x27;s lack of form prevented his reinstatement at Jardine&#x27;s expense. As a batsman, Jardine was more impressive in &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; opinion, showing himself to be good in defence despite his lack of cricket in the past two seasons. A notable innings was his 104 for The Rest to prevent defeat against champion county Yorkshire. The opposition bowling, particularly from Bill Bowes, was short and hostile, but Jardine survived for over four hours. He scored 1,104 first-class runs for the season at an average of 64.94.

At the beginning of the 1932 season, Jardine became captain of Surrey. There was much speculation that Fender had been replaced due to disputes with the Surrey committee but it was some time before this, and Jardine&#x27;s appointment, was confirmed. Fender was supportive of Jardine and happy to play under him. Jardine overcame a cautious beginning to develop a more aggressive captaincy style, and Surrey finished in their highest position in the championship for six years. England played one international match that season, India&#x27;s first ever Test match, and Jardine was selected as captain. India possessed a very effective bowling attack on this tour, which surprised many teams, and England&#x27;s batsmen struggled against them. Jardine, who had played a long innings against the tourists for M.C.C. earlier in the season, was the only English batsman to pass 30 in both innings. He scored 79 and 85 not out, and was praised for two excellent defensive innings in a difficult situation by &quot;Wisden&quot; and &quot;The Cricketer&quot;. During the match, Jardine again clashed with his team. He gave Bill Bowes and Bill Voce the very unusual instruction to bowl one full toss each over to take advantage of the batsmen&#x27;s trouble seeing the ball against the crowd. The bowlers did not do so, and were later reprimanded by Jardine who told them to obey orders. Jardine himself went on to score 1,464 runs in the season at an average of 52.28.

===Planning for the 1932–33 tour===
A week after the Test, it was announced that Jardine would captain the M.C.C. team to Australia that winter, although he seemed to have had last minute doubts about accepting. Others were also concerned about whether he was the best choice. For example, Rockley Wilson is reputed to have said that with Jardine as captain, &quot;We shall win the Ashes ... but we may well lose a Dominion&quot;. However, the selectors thought that a determined leader was needed to defeat the Australians and a more disciplined approach than that of Percy Chapman on the previous tour was needed. Jardine began to plan tactics from this point, discussing ideas with various people. He was aware that Bradman, Australia&#x27;s star batsman and the main worry of the selectors, had occasionally shown vulnerability to pace bowling. During the final Test of the 1930 Ashes at the Oval, during Bradman&#x27;s innings of 232, the wicket became difficult for a time following rain. Bradman was briefly seen to be uncomfortable facing deliveries that bounced higher than usual at a faster pace. Percy Fender was one of many cricketers who noticed, and he discussed this with Jardine in 1932. When Jardine later saw film footage of the Oval incident and noticed Bradman&#x27;s discomfort, he shouted, &quot;I&#x27;ve got it! He&#x27;s yellow!&quot; Further details that developed his plans came from letters Fender received from Australia in 1932 describing how Australian batsmen were increasingly moving across the stumps towards the off-side to play the ball on the on-side. Fender showed these letters to Jardine. It was also known in England that Bradman had shown some discomfort during the 1931–32 Australian season against pace bowling.

Following Jardine&#x27;s appointment, a meeting was arranged with Nottinghamshire captain Arthur Carr and his two fast bowlers Larwood and Voce at London&#x27;s Piccadilly Hotel. Jardine explained his belief that Bradman was weak against bowling directed at leg stump and that if this line of attack could be maintained, it would restrict Bradman&#x27;s scoring to one side of the field, giving the bowlers greater control of his scoring. Jardine asked Larwood and Voce if they could bowl accurately on leg stump and make the ball rise up into the body of the batsman. The bowlers agreed that they could, and that it might prove effective, but Jardine stressed that bowling accurately was vitally important, or Bradman would dominate the bowling. Larwood believed that Jardine saw Bradman as his main target and wished to attack him psychologically as well as in a cricketing sense. At the same time, other Australian batsmen were also discussed. Larwood and Voce practised the plan over the remainder of the 1932 season with mixed success. Jardine also visited Frank Foster who had toured Australia in 1911–12 to discuss field placings appropriate to Australian conditions. Foster had bowled leg theory on that tour with his fielders placed close in on the leg-side, as had George Hirst in 1903–04. During the second half of the season, the team to tour Australia was announced. The selection of four fast bowlers and a few medium pacers was very unusual at the time, and it was commented on by the hosts&#x27; media, including Bradman. The selection of Eddie Paynter, who did not have a strong record, to replace the ill Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji was very likely a choice of Jardine. He had a history of good performances against Yorkshire, and Jardine considered that a player&#x27;s record against northern counties was a good indication of his potential at international level.

==Bodyline tour==
===Beginning of the tour===

In Jardine&#x27;s obituary, &quot;Wisden&quot; described this tour as &quot;probably the most controversial tour in history. England won four of the five Tests, but it was the methods they employed rather than the results which caused so much discussion and acrimony.&quot; On the journey to Australia, by the boat &quot;Orontes&quot;, Jardine kept away from his team. He issued some instructions on their conduct, such as giving autographs or keeping out of the sun. He also began to have disagreements with Plum Warner, who was one of the two team managers along with Richard Palairet. He discussed tactics with Harold Larwood and other bowlers, spoke to Hedley Verity about his role in the team, and he may have met batsmen Wally Hammond and Herbert Sutcliffe. Some players reported that Jardine told them to hate the Australians in order to defeat them, while instructing them to refer to Bradman as &quot;the little bastard.&quot; At this stage, he seems to have settled on leg theory, if not full Bodyline, as his main tactic.

Once the team arrived in Australia, Jardine quickly alienated the press by refusing to give team details before a match and being uncooperative when interviewed by journalists. The press printed some negative stories as a result and the crowds barracked as they had done on his previous tour, which made him angry. Jardine still wore his Harlequin cap and began the tour well with 98 and 127 before the first Test. Once again, he clashed with paceman Bill Bowes, refusing to give his bowler the requested field placings in an early match. As a result, Bowes deliberately gave away easy runs in an attempt to get his way, but following a discussion, Bowes was converted to Jardine&#x27;s tactics and ultimately to his ability as a captain. In a tour match, Jardine also instructed Hammond to attack the bowling of Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, whom he considered dangerous and thus did not want him to play in the Tests. Up until this point, there had been little unusual about the English bowling except the number of fast bowlers. Larwood and Voce were given a light workload in the early matches by Jardine. This changed in the match against an Australian XI, from which Jardine rested himself, where the bowlers first used the tactics that came to be known as Bodyline. Under the captaincy of Wyatt, the bowlers bowled short and around leg stump, with fielders positioned close by on the leg side to catch any deflections. Wyatt later claimed that this was not planned beforehand and he simply passed on to Jardine what happened after the match. These tactics continued in the next match; several players were hit. Many commentators criticised this style of bowling; although bowlers had previously used leg theory bowling, where bowlers bowled outside leg stump with a concentration of fielders on the leg side; using these tactics with fast bowlers dropping the ball short was almost unprecedented. It was seen as dangerous and against the spirit of the game. In a letter, Jardine told Fender that his information about the Australian batting technique was correct and that it meant he was having to move more and more fielders onto the leg side. He said that &quot;if this goes on I shall have to move the whole bloody lot to the leg side.&quot; Jardine increasingly came into disagreement with Warner over Bodyline as the tour progressed, but his tactics were successful in one respect: in six innings against the tourists ahead of the Tests, Bradman had scored only 103 runs, causing concern among the Australian public who expected much more from him.

===Test matches===
When the first Test began, Jardine persisted with Bodyline tactics, even though Bradman, the main target, did not play in the match. David Frith has pointed out that Bradman would have been watching and seeing the tactics that England were using. However, when Stan McCabe was scoring 187 not out, Jardine was briefly seen to be unsettled as runs came quickly, and he may not have been fully convinced that the tactics would be successful. England eventually won the match comfortably. In the second Test, Jardine completely misjudged the pitch and left out a specialist spinner when conditions later in the match favoured one. The match seemed to be going well when Bill Bowes unexpectedly bowled the returning Bradman first ball in the first innings; Jardine was seen to be so delighted that he had clasped his hands above his head and performed a &quot;war dance&quot;. This was an extremely unusual reaction in the 1930s, particularly from Jardine who rarely showed any emotion while playing cricket. In the second innings, Bradman scored an unbeaten century which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each. This made it seem to critics that Bodyline was not quite the threat that had been perceived and Bradman&#x27;s reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored. On the other hand, the pitch was slightly slower than was customary throughout the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness.

Jardine had clashed with more of his team by this stage: he had argued with Gubby Allen at least twice about his refusal to bowl Bodyline (although he did bowl bouncers and fielded in the &quot;leg trap&quot;, the fielders who waited for catches close in on the leg side); and the Nawab of Pataudi had refused to field in the &quot;leg trap&quot;, to which Jardine responded, &quot;I see his highness is a conscientious objector&quot;, and subsequently allowed Pataudi to play little part in the tour.

The teams went into the third Test with the series level; England won that match but the controversy nearly ended the tour. Jardine, concerned by his poor run of batting form, had promoted himself to open the batting but was part of a drastic England collapse to 30 for four in the first innings. However, the trouble began when Bill Woodfull was struck on the chest by a Larwood delivery, drawing the comment from Jardine of &quot;Well bowled, Harold&quot;, aimed mainly at Bradman who was also batting at the time. For the next ball faced by Woodfull, at the start of Larwood&#x27;s next over, the fielders moved into the Bodyline fielding positions for the next ball he faced. Jardine wrote that Larwood had asked for the field to be moved, while Larwood said that it was Jardine&#x27;s decision. The crowd became noisily angry as the ill feeling caused by the English bowling tactics spilled out, and Jardine later expressed regret that he had moved the fielders when he did. There was further anger later in the innings when Bert Oldfield suffered a fractured skull. At this point, several of the players feared that there might be a riot and that the crowd would jump onto the field to attack them; mounted police were deployed as a precaution, but the spectators remained behind the fences. Jardine then batted very slowly in an innings of 56, during which he was continuously barracked by the crowd. During the match one of the Australian team called Jardine a &quot;bastard&quot;. He went to the Australian dressing room during the Test to demand an apology. The Australian vice-captain Vic Richardson who answered the door turned to his team and asked &quot;OK, which of you bastards called this bastard a bastard?&quot;. Despite England&#x27;s win, &quot;Wisden&quot; believed that it was probably the most unpleasant match ever played. However, it commended Jardine&#x27;s courage, claimed that praise of his leadership was unanimous, and said that &quot;above all he captained his team in this particular match like a genius&quot;. In the immediate aftermath, journalists in England and Australia took up viewpoints both for and against Jardine. The M.C.C. sent a telegram congratulating him on winning the match.

Following the third Test, strongly worded cables passed between the Australian Board of Control and the M.C.C. at Lord&#x27;s. The Australian Board accused the English team of unsportsmanlike tactics, stating that &quot;Bodyline bowling has assumed such proportions as to menace the best interests of the game, making protection of the body the main consideration.&quot; The M.C.C. responded angrily to the accusations of unsporting conduct, played down the Australian claims about the danger of Bodyline and threatened to call off the tour. The series was becoming a major diplomatic incident by this stage, and many people saw Bodyline as damaging to an international relationship that needed to remain strong. Public reaction in both England and Australia was outrage directed at the other nation. The Governor of South Australia, Alexander Hore-Ruthven, who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs James Henry Thomas that this would cause a significant impact on trade between the nations. The standoff was settled only when Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons met members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the fourth Test, thus saving the tour. However, correspondence continued for almost a year. Jardine was shaken by the events and by the hostile reactions that his team were receiving. Stories appeared in the press, possibly leaked by the disenchanted Nawab of Pataudi, about fights and arguments between the England players. Jardine offered to stop using Bodyline if the team did not support him, but after a private meeting (not attended by Jardine or either of the team managers) the players released a statement fully supporting Jardine and the Bodyline tactics. It was subsequently revealed that several of the players had private reservations, but they did not express them publicly at the time. Even so, Jardine would not have played in the fourth Test without the withdrawal of the unsportsmanlike accusation.

Once the fourth Test got underway, England won the match to take the series. Partly prompted by Jardine, Eddie Paynter scored 83 having released himself from hospital. Jardine went on to make a painstaking 24, at one point facing 82 balls without scoring a single run. He was not proud of his batting performance, being shamefaced to Australian Test opener Jack Fingleton, and describing his batting to Bill O&#x27;Reilly as being &quot;like an old maid defending her virginity.&quot; England also won the final Test ending on 28 February, with a final clash taking place between Jardine and Larwood. After a long bowling spell, Larwood was furious when Jardine sent him in to bat as nightwatchman but went on to score 98 runs. Later, Larwood broke his foot while bowling in the second innings, but Jardine was not convinced that he was seriously injured. He made him stay on the field until Bradman was out. Larwood, partly through this injury and partly through political repercussions from this series, never played another Test. Also in this match, Jardine enraged Harry Alexander by asking him not to run on the pitch as he was damaging it and giving his side an advantage. He proceeded to bowl hostile bouncers at Jardine, who was struck painfully to the delight of the crowd.

While Jardine won the series as captain, he contributed just 199 runs at an average of 22.11 in the Tests, and 628 runs (average 36.94) in all first-class cricket in Australia. Jardine only played in the first Test of the short series which followed in New Zealand, due to rheumatism. All the players enjoyed the short tour although rain ruined the cricket, and Jardine was observed to show signs of paranoia towards all things Australian. Pelham Warner, although he later stated that he disapproved of Bodyline bowling, praised Jardine&#x27;s captaincy on the tour and believed that he was cruelly treated by the Australian crowds. He further believed that Jardine was convinced that the tactics were legitimate.

===Aftermath and 1933 season===
Controversy over Bodyline continued throughout the following summer. Jardine himself contributed his opinion in a book, &quot;In Quest for the Ashes&quot;, a first-hand account of the Bodyline tour. He defended his tactics and heavily criticised the Australian barrackers, to the extent of suggesting that fixtures between England and Australia should be halted until this problem was solved. While arguments continued to rage in print and discussion, even at government level, Jardine received a hero&#x27;s welcome on his return to England, making several public appearances. Despite his fears that the M.C.C. might sack him in the face of criticism, he was appointed as England captain for the series against the West Indies in 1933. He continued to captain Surrey during his infrequent first-class appearances that summer, although business commitments prevented him from playing a full season. He was cheered by the crowd or given a standing ovation when he came out to bat as M.C.C. captain against the West Indians in May, at Sheffield for Surrey against Yorkshire, and in the first and second Test matches. In all first-class cricket that season, Jardine scored 779 runs at an average of 51.93, including three hundreds. One of these centuries came in the second Test (Jardine missed the third with an injury that ended his season).

Some bowlers had experimented with Bodyline in the season, and the West Indian team, 1–0 down in the series and frustrated by the lack of pace in the pitches, decided to experiment with the tactic. Facing a good West Indies total, England suffered a batting collapse, at one point falling to 134 for four. With Les Ames in difficulty against the short-pitched bowling, Jardine said, &quot;You get yourself down this end, Les. I&#x27;ll take care of this bloody nonsense.&quot; He went right back to the bouncers, standing on tiptoe, and stopped them with a dead bat, sometimes playing the ball one handed for more control. &quot;Wisden&quot; described how he never flinched despite facing the greatest amount of Bodyline. It also believed that he played it &quot;probably better than any other man in the world was capable of doing.&quot; He batted for nearly five hours, scoring 127, his only Test century. England then retaliated by bowling Bodyline in the West Indies&#x27; second innings, but the slow pitch meant that the match was drawn. However, this performance played a large part in turning English opinion against Bodyline. &quot;The Times&quot; used the word &quot;Bodyline&quot;, without using inverted commas or using the qualification &quot;so-called&quot;, for the first time. &quot;Wisden&quot; said that &quot;most of those watching it for the first time must have come to the conclusion that, while strictly within the law, it was not nice.&quot;

===Retirement===

During the 1933 season, Jardine was appointed as captain for the M.C.C. tour of India that winter which would feature the hosts&#x27; first Tests at home. This continued support for Jardine in the face of growing unhappiness towards Bodyline bowling came with some reservations, as the President and Secretary of the M.C.C. met Jardine for discussions prior to his appointment. This was probably about the need for diplomacy and tact on what may have proved to be a sensitive tour. With only two players from the Bodyline tour, Jardine and Verity, taking part, it was not a full-strength side but won the Test series 2–0. India were weaker than expected, and lacked a large group of quality players. Jardine nevertheless won praise from &quot;Wisden&quot; for his captaincy and his batting. He approached the matches with a very competitive spirit, seeking to gain every advantage with his tactics and research. At the same time, he was far more willing to take up speaking engagements than on the Bodyline tour, showed an appreciation and regard for Indian crowds which he had never extended to Australia, and played the diplomatic role that was usually expected of a captain of the M.C.C. at the time. He often spoke of his affection for India, describing it as the land of his birth and seemed to be relaxed and happy on this tour.

England won the Test series 2–0. Jardine contributed three fifties in four innings in the series, scoring 221 runs at an average of 73.66. He scored 60, 61 and 65 before his final Test innings ended at 35 not out. Jardine scored 831 first-class runs on the Indian leg of the tour—he played one match in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka)—averaging 55.40. Although Jardine enjoyed the tour, there were still clashes evident. There was an argument with the Viceroy over Jardine selecting the Maharaja of Patiala to play for the M.C.C. in one match; in a subsequent match, Jardine complained that the pitch was rolled for too long. He also clashed, later on, with the umpire Frank Tarrant, initially due to suspicion over the number of lbw decisions given against the M.C.C., but also because Tarrant had warned him against using Bodyline and was employed by Indian princes. Jardine threatened to stop him umpiring and sent a telegram to Lord&#x27;s, with the result that Tarrant, having officiated the first two Tests, was not used in the third. For much of the time, Jardine used different tactics to those employed in Australia. Slow bowling, particularly that of Hedley Verity, played a key part in the bowling attack. At times, the faster bowlers Nobby Clark and Stan Nichols bowled Bodyline, resulting in several injuries. In this case, the Indian bowlers Mohammad Nissar and Amar Singh retaliated with Bodyline bowling of their own.

As the tour went on, there was discussion at a high level over Jardine&#x27;s future. The M.C.C. authorities had realised that Bodyline was dangerous and should not be continued, but some figures such as Lord Hawke did not want to let Jardine down. Australians saw him as more of a problem; the likes of Alexander Hore-Ruthven wanted guarantees that Jardine would not use Bodyline and even that he not play. Plum Warner also believed that Jardine should no longer captain. Jardine himself saved the English selectors from any possible dilemma. In March 1934, he first told Surrey that he would be unable to play regularly any more and he resigned as captain. Then in an announcement in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, he stated that &quot;I have neither the intention nor the desire to play cricket against Australia this summer.&quot; It is unclear whether this was due to the pressure over Bodyline, over assurances that the M.C.C. may have asked him to give or simply due to financial worries. This decision effectively ended his first-class career. He never played another Test and played only two more first-class matches in England, in 1937 and 1948, and one in India in 1943–44.

Jardine played in 22 Test matches for England, scoring 1,296 runs at an average of 48.00. In his first-class cricket career, he played 262 matches, scoring 14,848 runs at an average of 46.83. His occasional bowling brought him 48 wickets at an average of 31.10.

==Style and personality==

===Batting===

Jardine was seen as having a classical technique. While batting, he stood very straight and side on to the bowler. His off-driving was powerful, his defence was excellent, and he was superb at judging the line of the ball and letting it pass by if it was going to miss his wickets. His on-side play was also excellent, being able to place the ball between fielders for easy runs. Christopher Douglas described Jardine as &quot;the epitome of the old-fashioned amateur&quot;. However, he also comments that his approach to batting was like that of a professional and that his back-foot batting was of a quality that few amateurs could manage. In 1928, &quot;Wisden&#x27;s&quot; correspondent described Jardine as the most secure amateur batsman of the time, and identified his greatest strength as his defence and his &quot;mental gifts.&quot; He played very straight and hit the ball hard in defence, but could not play all the strokes, particularly on the off side. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow believed that Jardine had modelled himself on C. B. Fry. He also noted that Jardine displayed good concentration, a strong desire to improve his batting and a fighting spirit that brought out his best in a crisis. He also said that Jardine could play every recognised cricket shot, but would not do so in a match and Robertson-Glasgow believed it was Jardine&#x27;s one weakness as a batsman. The more important the occasion, the more defensive and restricted Jardine&#x27;s batting became: &quot;In general, as the task grew greater, the strokes grew fewer.&quot;

Christopher Douglas argues that Jardine liked to make his runs when his side was in difficulty and enjoyed being tested; his approach would often lead his team to recovery from an unfavourable situation. Douglas comments that Jardine held his place in the England side despite strong competition from other batsmen. His defensive technique rescued England from weak positions in around a dozen innings and only played in two losses with England (which were his two least successful games with the bat). He also excelled in the main Gentlemen v Players fixture at Lord&#x27;s, making a good score in each of his appearances in this match. Jack Hobbs classed him as a great batsman and believed that he was under-rated by his contemporaries.

&quot;Wisden&quot; believed that Jardine&#x27;s effective batting technique meant that fast bowlers troubled him less than other batsmen. He did have difficulties with a few bowlers. Alec Kennedy, a medium paced inswing bowler, took Jardine&#x27;s wicket eleven times, eight of these occasions before the batsman had scored 20 runs. Kennedy found that Jardine had slightly slow footwork, often bowling him or trapping him lbw. Bert Ironmonger also troubled Jardine, taking his wicket in five of the eleven Test innings in which they faced each other. Jardine displayed a slight weakness against Australian slow bowlers, not moving his feet well enough against them. In 16 Test innings in Australia, he was out to slow bowlers ten times, but he rarely experienced similar difficulties against English spinners. One other bowler to cause Jardine problems was the Australian paceman Tim Wall, who took his wicket five times on the nine occasions he bowled to him.

===Captaincy===
As a captain, Jardine inspired great loyalty in his players, even if they did not approve of his tactics. Christopher Douglas judges that Jardine did very well to keep the team united and loyal on the Bodyline tour. He points out that team spirit was always excellent and the players showed great determination and resolve. Jardine particularly impressed Yorkshiremen who played under him, as they believed he thought about cricket in a similar way to their county colleagues. He became close to Herbert Sutcliffe during the Bodyline tour, even though Sutcliffe was sceptical about Jardine on the previous Australian tour in 1928–29. Hedley Verity was impressed by Jardine&#x27;s tactical understanding and named his younger son Douglas after the captain. Bill Bowes expressed approval of his leadership after initial misgivings, and went on to call him England&#x27;s greatest captain. Nevertheless, some players such as Arthur Mitchell who played under Jardine believed he was intolerant and unsupportive of players of lesser talent, expecting everyone to perform at world-class standards.

Jardine insisted on strict discipline from his players but in return he went to great lengths to look after them, such as organising dental treatment or providing champagne for his tired bowlers. Critics praised his skill in field placing, which was sometimes interpreted as panic when he made frequent changes if the batsmen were on top. He also displayed great physical courage, such as when he was struck by a ball hard enough to draw blood on the Bodyline tour, but refused to show pain before reaching the dressing room. On the same tour, he instructed his men not to be friendly or to socialise with the Australian players; Gubby Allen even claimed that Jardine instructed the team to hate the Australians. Robertson-Glasgow wrote that Jardine made thorough preparation for games in which he was captain, studying individual batsmen at great length to find weaknesses. He had very clear plans, judged the strengths and weaknesses of his teams and knew how to get the best out of individual players. However, Robertson-Glasgow considered it a grave misjudgement to make Jardine captain of England, particularly given his known antipathy towards Australia. Pelham Warner described how Jardine &quot;was a master of tactics and strategy, and was especially adept in managing fast bowlers and thereby preserving their energy. He possessed a great capacity for taking pains, which, it has been said, is the mark of a genius ... As a field tactician and selector of teams he was, I consider, surpassed by no one and equalled by few, if any.&quot;

Laurence Le Quesne argues that one of Jardine&#x27;s greatest talents, and at the same time greatest weaknesses, was his ability to formulate a winning strategy without consideration of wider contexts such as the social aspect of the game. On the Bodyline tour, he ignored the diplomacy required of an M.C.C. delegation. Instead, he embarked, according to Le Quesne, to win the Tests and settle personal scores with the Australians. Jardine was personally incapable of reacting to the crowds or responding to the controversy in a way that would have eased tensions, and so was not a good choice as captain given what the selectors already knew of him. Nevertheless, Le Quesne believed that when trouble arose, Jardine conducted himself with &quot;great moral courage and an impressive degree of dignity and restraint.&quot;

In his &quot;Wisden&quot; obituary, Jardine was described as one of England&#x27;s best captains, while Jack Hobbs rated him the second best captain after Percy Fender. Warner also said that he was a fine captain on and off the field, and in dealing with administrators. In fact, he stated that, &quot;If ever there was a cricket match between England and the rest of the world and the fate of England depended upon its result, I would pick Jardine as England captain every time.&quot;

===Personality===
Jardine divided opinion among those with whom he played. He could be charming and witty or ruthless and harsh, while many people who knew him believed him to be innately shy. David Frith describes him as a complex figure who could change moods quickly. Although he could be friendly off the field, he became hostile and determined once he stepped onto the field. At his memorial service, he was described by Hubert Ashton as being &quot;provocative, austere, brusque, shy, humble, thoughtful, kindly, proud, sensitive, single-minded and possessed of immense moral and physical courage,&quot; and Frith argues that these varied qualities are easily proven by what was said about him.

Harold Larwood maintained great respect for Jardine, treasuring a gift his captain gave him after the Bodyline tour and believing him to be a great man. Jardine showed affection for Larwood in return even after both of their retirements; he expressed his concern for the way Larwood was treated, hosted a lunch for the former fast bowler shortly before he emigrated to Australia and met him there in 1954. On the other hand, Donald Bradman would never speak to journalists about Bodyline or Jardine, and refused to give a tribute when Jardine died in 1958. Jack Fingleton admitted that he had liked Jardine and stated that he and Larwood had each done their job on the Bodyline tour, and expressed regret at the way both left cricket in acrimonious circumstances. Fingleton also described Jardine as an aloof individual who preferred to take his time in judging a person before befriending them, a quality that caused problems in Australia. Bill O&#x27;Reilly stated that he disliked Jardine at the time of Bodyline, but on meeting him later found him agreeable and even charming.

Alan Gibson said that Jardine had &quot;irony rather than humour&quot;. He sent Herbert Sutcliffe an umbrella as a joke on the day of his benefit match, when rain would have ruined the match and lost Sutcliffe a considerable amount of money. Many people who knew Jardine later in his life described him as having a sense of humour. Robertson-Glasgow noted that while he could curse very eloquently, Jardine displayed &quot;dislike of waste in material or words.&quot; He also commented that &quot;if he has sometimes been a fierce enemy, he has also been a wonderful friend.&quot;

==Later life==

===Career after cricket===
Shortly before the tour of India in 1933–34, Jardine became engaged and on 1934, married Irene &quot;Isla&quot; Margaret Peat in London. She had met Jardine at shooting parties at her father&#x27;s Norfolk home. According to Gerald Howat, Jardine&#x27;s marriage was the probable reason for his giving up playing first-class cricket. Jardine&#x27;s father-in-law was keen for him to pursue his law career but he instead continued as a bank clerk and began to work as a journalist. He reported on the 1934 Ashes for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. His writing for the press, and in a follow-up book on the series, was critical of selectors but less so of the players. In 1936, he penned &quot;Cricket: how to succeed&quot;, which was written as an instruction book for the National Union of Teachers. There was a possibility of his going to Australia as a journalist to cover the M.C.C. tour of 1936–37, to the dismay of Hore-Ruthven, but nothing came of this. With alterations to the law in 1935, changing the lbw law and preventing Bodyline bowling, Jardine became increasingly disillusioned with top-level cricket. He had grown uncomfortable with the nationalism stirred up by Tests, the greed of clubs and the large public following of individual players, particularly Bradman. At the same time, Jardine seemed to be ostracised by cricket writers and commentators, who simply ignored him. For example, &quot;Wisden&quot; made no mention of his retirement. Christopher Douglas believes that Jardine was used as a scapegoat for Bodyline once the M.C.C. stopped supporting the tactic and that a stigma was attached to him for the rest of his life and beyond.

Although Jardine had retired from regular first-class competition, he continued to play club cricket. Jardine and his wife initially lived in Kensington but moved to Reading after the birth of their first child, daughter Fianach. A second daughter, Marion, followed but the family suffered from financial worries. Jardine, as well as working in journalism, earned money from playing bridge. The family also tried unsuccessfully to engage in market gardening. To make more money, Jardine became a salesman with Cable &amp; Wireless before working for a coal mining company in the late 1930s. In 1939, he returned to cricket journalism and according to Christopher Douglas, achieved his highest standard as a writer.

===Career in the Second World War===
Jardine joined the Territorial Army in August 1939. Once World War II began, he was commissioned into the Royal Berkshire Regiment and went with the British Expeditionary Force to France. He served at Dunkirk, where he was fortunate to escape but suffered some injuries. After serving as staff captain at St. Albans, he was posted to India for the remainder of the war. He served in Quetta, then Simla as a major in the Central Provisions Directorate. He became fluent in the Hindustani language and although friendly, never formed close relationships with other officers. He gave lectures and played some cricket while in India. He left the army in 1945 only to find his job with the coal mining company was no longer available.

In the meantime, his wife had moved to Somerset. In 1940, she gave birth to a son, Euan, who had many medical problems, and in 1943 she bore a third daughter, Iona. The pressure of running the household and caring for Euan led Isla to have a nervous breakdown after Iona&#x27;s birth. When Jardine returned from the war, the family moved to Radlett to be closer to London. Isla recovered and Jardine found a job with paper manufacturers Wiggins Teape. In 1946, Jardine was chosen to play for Old England in a popular and successful fund raising match against Surrey. He displayed much of his old batting skill but did not show much involvement with his team-mates. By 1948, Jardine was more accepted in the cricket world. This was partly due to English perception of the short-pitched fast bowling of Australian pairing Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller as being hostile. England&#x27;s poor performance in the 1946–47 and 1948 Ashes also caused writers to remember Jardine more fondly as an icon of past English success.

===Final years===
In 1953, Jardine resumed journalism for the Ashes series and expressed a high opinion of Len Hutton&#x27;s captaincy. He also did some broadcasting and wrote short stories to supplement his income; Isla was in poor health and her medical care was expensive. In the same year, he became the first President of the Umpires Association, while from 1955 to 1957 he was President of the Oxford University Cricket Club. In 1953, he travelled, with some trepidation, as a board member of the Scottish Australian Company to inspect some land in Australia. While there, he struck up a friendship with Fingleton and was surprised to be well received in the country, in his own words, as &quot;an old so-and-so who got away with it.&quot;

In 1957, Jardine travelled to Rhodesia, again to inspect some land, with his daughter Marion. While there, he became ill with tick fever. He showed no improvement upon his return to England and further tests revealed that he had advanced lung cancer. After some treatment, he travelled with his wife to a clinic in Switzerland but it was discovered that the cancer had spread and was incurable. He died in Switzerland on 1958 and his ashes were scattered at the summit of Cross Craigs overlooking Loch Rannoch in Perthshire, Scotland. His family had enquired about having his ashes dispersed at Lord&#x27;s, but this honour was restricted to war dead. When he died, his estate was valued at just over £71,000, which would have been worth around £1,765,000 in 2022 terms.

==Legacy==
Jardine is inextricably associated with Bodyline. John Arlott wrote in 1989 that &quot;It is no exaggeration to say that, among Australians, Douglas Jardine is probably the most disliked of cricketers.&quot; In the view of Christopher Douglas, his name &quot;stands for the legendary British qualities of cool-headed determination, implacable resolve, patrician disdain for crowds and critics alike – if you&#x27;re English that is. To Australians the name is synonymous with the legendary British qualities of snobbishness, cynicism and downright Pommie arrogance.&quot; He also argues that Bodyline, which was legal at the time, was a necessary step to overcome the unfair advantage which batsmen of the time enjoyed.

After the Bodyline tour, according to cricket writer Gideon Haigh, Jardine was seen as &quot;the most reviled man in sport.&quot; This perception faded from the 1950s onwards, and in more recent times, Jardine has been viewed more sympathetically. In 2002, the England captain Nasser Hussain was compared to Jardine as a compliment when he displayed ruthlessness against the opposition.

<text>Wellington Harbour ( ), officially called Wellington Harbour / Port Nicholson, is a large natural harbour on the southern tip of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. The harbour entrance is from Cook Strait. Central Wellington is located on parts of the western and southern sides of the harbour, and the suburban area of Lower Hutt is to the north and east.

The harbour area bounded by a line between Pencarrow Head to Petone foreshore, was officially named Port Nicholson until it assumed its current dual name in 1984.

== Toponymy ==
The earliest known Māori name for the area, &quot;Te Upoko-o-te-Ika-a-Māui&quot;, is derived from Māori legend and translates literally as &quot;the head of Māui&#x27;s fish&quot;.

&quot;Te Whanganui-a-Tara&quot;, another Māori name for the area, translates literally as &quot;the great harbour of Tara&quot;. It is believed to refer to Tara, a son of the Polynesian explorer Whātonga, who was sent down from the Māhia Peninsula by his father to explore southern lands for their people to settle.

Captain James Herd is said to have named the harbour &quot;Port Nicholson&quot; after Sydney&#x27;s harbourmaster Captain John Nicholson. However, while Herd is attributed as the creator of the first charts describing Te Whanganui a Tara as &quot;Port Nicholson&quot; it is likely that Captain John Rodolphus Kent of the cutter &quot;Mermaid&quot; had entered the harbour in 1824, and named it after the harbourmaster, his superior officer. A further Māori name for Wellington, &quot;Pōneke&quot;, is said to be a transliteration of Port Nick (Port Nicholson).

An alternative suggested etymology for the name states that it derives from a shortening of the Māori phrase , meaning &quot;the journey into the night&quot;, in reference to the exodus of Te Āti Awa after they were displaced from the Wellington area by the first Europeans. However, the name Pōneke was already in use by February 1842, earlier than the displacement is said to have happened.

William Wakefield is thought to have named the harbour Lambton Harbour in 1839 in honour of the Earl of Durham, who had the family name of &quot;Lambton&quot;. Alternatively, it could have been named for the &quot;Lambton&quot;, a cutter commanded by Captain Barnett, who in 1826 had produced one of the earliest charts of the harbour.

==History==
===Pre-European history===
According to oral history, Wellington Harbour was first discovered by the Polynesian explorer Kupe, who visited in the 10th century. A number of place names in the area commemorate Kupe, such as Te Tangihanga o Kupe or Te Raranga o Kupe (Barrett Reef), and Te Aroaro o Kupe or Te Ure o Kupe (Steeple Rock). Kupe also named two islands in the harbour, Mākaro (Ward Island) and Matiu (Somes Island), after his daughters or nieces.

Kupe was followed to the area by Tara and Tautoki, sons of the explorer Whātonga, who settled there. Tara is remembered in the names of both the harbour and the first iwi (tribe) to settle there permanently, Ngāi Tara.

===Modern history===

During his voyage on HMS &quot;Resolution&quot;, James Cook passed by the entrance to the harbour on 2 November 1773, and then put about, in an attempt to see what lay within the entrance. He anchored a mile from Barrett Reef, and made some brief observations noting that it appeared to be a sheltered harbour. A wind change led him to leave the area, and there were no further observations from European explorers for the next 50 years. 

In 1826, Captain James Herd entered the harbour on the barque &quot;Rosanna&quot;, along with Captain Barnett of the cutter &quot;Lambton&quot;. Both subsequently made charts of the harbour.

The New Zealand Company established settlements in Petone and Wellington from 1840.

The 1855 Wairarapa earthquake uplifted the north-western side of the harbour. This led to reclamation in the harbour, which increased the availability of flat land for Wellington City.

In 1968, the inter-island passenger ferry &quot;Wahine&quot; grounded at Barrett Reef, near the harbour entrance, during a storm. Fifty-one people died at the time and two more died much later from injuries suffered that day.

==Mythology==
===Legend of ===
According to legend, the harbour of Te Whanganui-a-Tara was created by two taniwha (nature guardian spirits), Whātaitai (or Hataitai) and Ngake. Whataitai lived in the north of the lake where the harbour now is, and was gentle. Ngake, who lived further south, was more violent. Ngake could hear the waters of Raukawa Moana (Cook Strait) pounding to the south, and decided to escape the lake to get to it. He went to the north of the lake to build up his speed for the attempt, then headed off rapidly towards the south. Ngake crashed into and through the rocks at Seatoun and headed out into the Strait. Barrett Reef is said to be the debris left from Ngake&#x27;s escape. This was seen by Whataitai, who tried to follow Ngake out of the new entrance. The water was now running out of the lake, however, and Whataitai became stranded in the shallows. He stayed there for many generations before being lifted high onto the land by a great earthquake. The soul of Whataitai left him in the form of a bird, Te Keo, and his body formed the isthmus of land where Wellington airport is now located. It flew high above the harbour and wept for the taniwha, whose body was lifted high onto the hills close to the harbour entrance. To this day, Mount Victoria is known to Māori as &quot;Tangi Te Keo&quot;, &quot;The weeping of Te Keo&quot;, and the suburb on the hills immediately below it is named Hataitai.
Another name for the region around the harbour is , which means &quot;the head of Māui’s fish&quot;. According to Māori legend, a giant fish was hooked and pulled to the surface by Polynesian navigator Māui and the fish turned into land which became the North Island. The older name is still used in some circumstances for the city or the region, such as the former Māori name of Victoria University of Wellington, which was Te Whare Wānanga o te Ūpoko o te Ika a Māui until 2018.

==Geography and geology==

=== Setting ===
Wellington Harbour is a natural harbour with an area of around 76 km², with an entrance from Cook Strait at its southern end between Pencarrow Head and Palmer Head on the southern tip of Miramar Peninsula. The harbour has a maximum length of over 11 kilometres and a width of 9.25 kilometres, and the entrance is over 1.6 kilometres wide from shore to shore.

The shipping channel through the harbour entrance lies between Barrett Reef on the western side, and Pencarrow Head to the east. Barrett Reef is a cluster of rocks that is partly exposed even at high tide. It has been the site of a large number of shipwrecks. The most serious loss caused by impact with Barrett Reef is the sinking of the inter-island ferry TEV &quot;Wahine&quot; in 1968, with the loss of 53 lives.

Wellington Harbour provides sheltered anchorage in a region where wind velocities may exceed 160 km/h. The depth of water over most of the harbour exceeds 20 metres or 10 fathoms.

There are two main bays within the harbour, Evans Bay and Lambton Harbour. The small Oriental Bay to the north of Mount Victoria features beaches and cafes. The suburbs of Wellington city are spread around the low lying terrain immediately surrounding the harbour, and the hills overlooking the west and south-west of the harbour. Lambton Harbour is surrounded by the reclaimed land of Wellington&#x27;s central business district and contains the majority of the city&#x27;s port facilities. Evans Bay lies between Mt Victoria and the Miramar Peninsula, and is below the flight path to low-lying Wellington Airport.

To the east of the harbour lie several small bays, most of which are populated by small coastal communities. The largest of these suburban settlements is Eastbourne, directly to the east of the northern tip of the Miramar Peninsula.

The Hutt River enters the harbour at Waiwhetū. In Wellington city, many small creeks or streams including the Kumutoto, Waitangi and Waipapa streams formerly reached the harbour but were culverted many years ago.

The small islands Matiu / Somes Island, Mākaro / Ward Island and Mokopuna Island are located within the harbour.

=== Geology ===

The harbour is of seismic origin, and a major earthquake fault line (the Wellington Fault) lies along its western shore. In 2014 another fault line (the Aotea Fault) was discovered extending from Oriental Bay into the harbour. At the northern end of the harbour lies the narrow triangular plain of the Hutt River, which largely follows the line of the earthquake fault to the north-east. The city of Lower Hutt is located on this plain.

Māori oral history recounts that there used to be two channels at the entrance to the harbour. The present entrance was called Te Au-a-Tane and a western channel (now the Rongotai isthmus) was called Te-Awa-a-Taia. Between the two channels lay the island of Motu-Kairangi (present day Miramar Peninsula). Then a violent earthquake known as Haowhenua (Māori for &#x27;land swallower&#x27;) uplifted the land so that the Te-Awa-a-Taia channel dried up and the island of Motu-Kairangi became joined to the mainland. Researchers have concluded that the earthquake happened around 1460AD.

==== Tsunami ====
Although the harbour is almost entirely surrounded by land, several tsunami have been recorded within it. The 1855 Wairarapa earthquake caused a tsunami 3-4-metres high which entered Wellington harbour through the harbour entrance and also straight over the isthmus between Lyall Bay and Kilbirnie. In August 1868, the Arica earthquake in South America causes unusual changes in water levels in the harbour. A gravel bar appeared at Ngauranga, and water almost reached the street at Te Aro. In May 1877, the Iquique earthquake in South America caused water to rush into the harbour, and water levels rose and fell dramatically around the harbour for hours. 

==== Waiwhetu Aquifer ====

The Waiwhetu Aquifer is a pressurized zone of water-retaining sand, gravel and boulders beneath the Hutt Valley and Wellington Harbour, which provides around 40 percent of the Wellington region&#x27;s annual water supply. The harbour basin contains massive quantities of gravel washed down from the Hutt River, in some places hundreds of metres deep. Above the gravel is a layer of mud and silt which seals fresh water within the gravel, creating an artesian aquifer. There are several aquifers in the area in different layers underground, but the Waiwhetu Aquifer is the largest and most productive one. Water flows down into the aquifer from a five-kilometre stretch of the Hutt River south of Taita Gorge, and rainwater also contributes to the aquifer. South of Melling the aquifer becomes pressurized by the layer of mud and silt above the gravel layer holding the water in, meaning that if a bore is sunk into the aquifer, water will rise up the pipe. Water from the aquifer also reaches the surface through natural springs at various places around the harbour. Pressure within the aquifer stops sea water from getting into the aquifer.

The water level in Wellington Harbour was much lower 20,000 years ago, and the ancient Hutt River used to flow down a paleochannel to the east of Matiu / Somes Island as far as the present-day Miramar Peninsula. Much of the water in the Waiwhetu aquifer moves under the sea bed from the direction of the Hutt River to the Falcon Shoals area (between Karaka Bay and Worser Bay) at the harbour mouth via the paleochannel. The characteristics of the aquifer between Matiu / Somes Island and the harbour mouth are not as well studied as the portion to the north of the island.

=== Reclamations ===
Reclamation of Wellington Harbour started in the 1850s, in order to increase the amount of usable land for the then new City of Wellington. Land plots in the early city were scarce, with little room for public buildings and parks, as well as inadequate dockside areas for shipping. Reclamation progressively advanced into the harbour throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, providing room for public, commercial and industrial areas for the city.

==Marine life==

=== Fish ===
Fish species commonly caught in the harbour by recreational fishers include red cod, kahawai, gurnard, tarakihi, snapper, trevally, elephant fish and kingfish. Children enjoy catching spotties. Eagle rays and stingrays can both be found in the harbour: eagle rays are often seen in the shallow water around Whairepo Lagoon, which was named after the Māori name for the species. Several species of octopus live in the harbour. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, large octopuses would occasionally grab people at the water&#x27;s edge. Rig sharks visit the harbour each year to mate and give birth. Other species seen less often include basking sharks, blue sharks and seven-gilled sharks.

=== Marine mammals ===
Common dolphins and orca visit the harbour quite often. In the nineteenth century, southern right whales bred within Wellington Harbour, but in the 21st century sightings are much rarer. Humpback whales are also seen occasionally. There is a fur seal colony at Pariwhero / Red Rocks on the south coast facing Cook Strait, and seals sometimes appear in and around the harbour. Vagrant and rare marine mammal visitors include leopard seals (reclassified from vagrant to resident in 2019), crabeater seals, and an elephant seal nicknamed &#x27;Blossom&#x27; that hung around the harbour for several years in the 1960s.

=== Plants and sponges ===
Over 100 species of seaweed are found in Wellington Harbour. Rocky shores around the harbour support kelp forests, for example at Kau Bay, but rising sea temperatures may be affecting the health of these areas. Sponge beds are found in deeper parts of the harbour.

=== Birds ===
Between 2018 and 2022, annual surveys were made of indigenous coastal birdlife along the coastlines of the south coast and the western side of Wellington Harbour. Thirty-four native or endemic species and 14 naturalised introduced species were observed, though some of these were only seen on the south coast and not within the harbour. The surveys showed that stretches of the coastline &quot;hardened&quot; by reclamation or seawall construction have lower densities of birds and less diversity of species, probably due to the steepness of the shoreline and lack of intertidal foraging habitats. Changes to average sea level and temperature may affect some species in the future. Black-backed gulls, red-billed gulls and several species of shags are found all around the harbour. A breeding population of fluttering shearwaters has been established on Matiu / Somes Island. Little blue penguins are found in many locations, with nesting boxes provided in some places to encourage them.

== Environmental protection ==
As part of maintaining a healthy marine environment, Greater Wellington Regional Council and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) have monitored water quality in Wellington Harbour since 2016. Water quality is affected by sediment, nutrients and pollutants from the whole catchment around the harbour, turbidity caused by rainfall and outflow from the Hutt River, and tides.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and NIWA have carried out surveillance on non-indigenous marine species which may arrive in the harbour in water ballast or attached to hulls of ships. Examples of marine pests found in the harbour include the Northern Pacific sea star and wakame, a seaweed native to the north-west Pacific Ocean, which was first found in Wellington Harbour in 1987. It grows rapidly and can displace native species of seaweed.

Volunteers from the group Ghost Diving organise regular harbour clean-ups, collecting tonnes of rubbish from the water around the inner-city waterfront and bringing attention to the problem of littering.

==Transport==
Wellington Harbour is a significant port serving the lower North Island, with the Regional Council-owned company CentrePort recording around 14,000 commercial shipping movements each year. Wellington Harbour, the region&#x27;s third largest container port, is located in Wellington City. There is a tanker terminal at Seaview in Lower Hutt.

Wellington harbour ferries first began operating at the end of the 19th century and regular crossings from central Wellington to Days Bay continue today. The harbour is also used by inter-island ferries linking Wellington to Picton.

A project to develop a walking and cycling route around the harbour, the Great Harbour Way, is gathering momentum. Te Ara Tupua is a cycling and walking path being built from Melling in the Hutt Valley to central Wellington.

== Wharves ==

As of 2024, there are 20 wharves situated around Wellington Harbour. This includes large wharves in the inner harbour and port area, smaller wharves in seaside suburbs and the fuel wharves at Point Howard and Evans Bay. The first wharves were built from 1840 by newly-arrived European settlers, to enable them to move goods from ship to shore. The first publicly-owned wharf built in Wellington Harbour was Queens Wharf, completed in 1862. In 1880 the Wellington Harbour Board was created and took control of most wharves in the harbour until its disestablishment in 1989.

At that time a commercial company, Port of Wellington (now called CentrePort Wellington) took over management of most industrial wharves, while Wellington City Council and Hutt City Council gained control of most suburban wharves. Wharves were built for various purposes – moving fuel, primary products such as timber, wool and meat coming from the hinterland, other goods and passengers. Wharves for passenger ferries included ferries taking commuters and day trippers to and from the city and suburbs, and larger inter-island ferries going to Picton and Lyttelton. The wharves also serviced passenger liners from overseas, and TEAL flying boats. Over time Wellington&#x27;s wharves have been altered, upgraded, extended, truncated or buried in reclamation along the shoreline of Wellington Harbour. Many wharves have been repurposed in response to changing domestic and international conditions and requirements for maritime transport of passengers and cargo.

==Recreation==

Wellington&#x27;s south coast and harbour entrance are exposed to open sea, providing places to dive and fish. There are also fishing spots at the rocks and reclamations within the harbour.

Harbour beaches like Oriental Bay, Petone, Days Bay and Hataitai Beach are suited to swimming and sunbathing.

The harbour accommodates a range of activities, with five water ski lanes, an area for personal water craft and areas for windsurfing. Several rowing, waka ama and yachting clubs operate from the harbour.

Small boat craft can anchor at Mākaro / Ward Island and Mokopuna Island and can also visit the Matiu / Somes Island reserve during daylight hours. Harbour cruises also travel regularly between the main Wellington waterfront, Matiu / Somes Island, Days Bay and Petone.

==In the arts==
In 1974, the New Zealand author Denis Glover published the anthology &quot;Wellington Harbour&quot;, containing poems about or inspired by views of the harbour.

&quot;Big weather&quot; is an anthology of 100 poems about Wellington&#x27;s harbour, hills, and environment. It was published in 2009 and in later editions.

The Wellington Writers Walk is a series of 23 quotations from New Zealand poets, novelists, and playwrights, installed along the Wellington waterfront in the form of contemporary concrete plaques or inlaid metal text on wooden &#x27;benchmarks&#x27;. The plaques celebrate the lives and works of these well-known writers, all of whom had (or have) some connection to Wellington. Many of the quotations reference the harbour.

<text>18XX is the generic term for a series of board games that, with a few exceptions, recreate the building of railroad corporations during the 19th century; individual games within the series use particular years in the 19th century as their title (usually the date of the start of railway development in the area of the world they cover), or &quot;18&quot; plus a two or more letter geographical designator (such as &quot;18EU&quot; for a game set in the European Union). The games &quot;2038&quot;, set in the future, and &quot;Poseidon&quot; and &quot;Ur, 1830 BC&quot;, both set in ancient history, are also regarded as 18XX titles as their game mechanics and titling nomenclature are similar despite variance from the common railroad/stock-market theme.

The 18XX series has its origins in the game &quot;1829&quot;, first produced by Francis Tresham in the mid-1970s. 1829 was chosen as it was the year of the Rainhill Trials. &quot;1830&quot; was produced by Avalon Hill in 1986, and was the first game of the series widely available in the United States; it is seen as the basic 18XX game by the U.S. audience.

In addition to traditionally published games, the 18XX series has spawned self-published variants and games published by low-volume game companies.

With few exceptions (such as &quot;2038&quot;), 18XX titles are multiplayer board games without random variables in their game mechanics.

==Gameplay==

===Common features===
&quot;18XX&quot; games vary, but most follow this general pattern:
* The objective is to enhance personal wealth, not the assets of any companies a player may be operating. Personal wealth consists of cash, company stock (which increases wealth both by receiving dividends and by capital appreciation), and other investments (such as private companies).
* Players don&#x27;t directly interact with the game board, but do so indirectly through companies they control. Generally, the player who owns the most stock of a company is the president of that company and makes all decisions on behalf of that company. The president is also often required to help fund the company when it lacks sufficient funds to satisfy a mandated expense (such as owning a train by the end of its turn).
* Game play alternates between &quot;stock rounds&quot; and one or more &quot;operating rounds&quot;. In a stock round, players buy and sell stock (some games have company actions during a stock round as well), while in an operating round players take actions on behalf of companies they control, including laying track, placing station tokens, operating trains, withholding income or paying dividends, and buying trains.
* &quot;Certificate limit&quot;: there is usually a limit to how many corporate shares and private companies a player may own, to keep the game competitive by preventing snowball effects resulting from early leads by some players.
* The &quot;President&#x27;s certificate&quot; (or &quot;Director&#x27;s certificate&quot;) represents control of a railroad corporation, usually represents a greater percentage of corporate stock than other certificates (e.g., 20% as opposed to 10%), and is usually the first one purchased for a company (with its purchaser setting the price, or &quot;par value&quot;, for regular shares of stock in many titles in the series). If another player accumulates more shares in a company than the current president, they acquire the President&#x27;s certificate (with attendant side-effects for both players regarding certificate limits) in exchange for their own lesser shares, and becomes the new controller of the corporation.
* Certain games may impose restrictions on the order in which companies may be started (generally to impose a historical context upon the game), and they vary in how many shares must be purchased before the company may operate (&quot;floats&quot;).
* The map is usually a hex grid that depicts cities and terrain features. Hexagonal &quot;track&quot; tiles (representing available land-rights) are laid on top of this map to represent the growth of railroad networks, and tokens are placed on the board to represent stations (as well as special abilities from private companies). Cities have values which can vary based on which tiles have been laid on the city, the phase of the game, their historical importance to a corporation, or type of train used to reach them. Different color tiles are available in succession, and in phases that are typically determined by the first purchase of a more advanced type of train.
* A company&#x27;s stock price is adjusted based on the revenues earned and whether the president chose to pay dividends or to withhold the earnings in the company treasury. Stock prices are usually also affected by actions in the stock round, and some games have other mechanisms that affect the stock price.
* Scarcity (forcing future-turn planning by players) of available corporations, shares thereof, train types, and track tiles.
* Trains eventually become obsolete and must be replaced by more-expensive trains that also have greater capacity for earning revenue. Purchase of a new type of train usually triggers other phase-changes in the game, such as the obsolescence of older trains, the availability of different sets of tiles, increased valuation of certain non-tiled cities, closure of private companies, and the ability to merge corporations or form them at higher valuations.
* Game end is usually determined when the bank runs out of money, and also by player bankruptcy (when a player cannot pay the debt of a company they control). Some games do not end when a player goes bankrupt, while others add other conditions for ending the game such as when a stock reaches a certain value on the stock market, or the most advanced type of train has been purchased. Other games do not feature bankruptcy at all, and enable a player to place a moribund company in &quot;receivership&quot;, or be incorporated into a government railway, and walk away from debts.

===Differences===
While adhering to common similarities (see preceding section), each &quot;18XX&quot; game differs from the others in subtle or significant ways in rule set as well as game map. As with games in general, each individual mechanic has probably been used before, but a new game can put together a set of mechanics which provide a new and interesting challenge. Some typical areas of difference are:
* Initial Auction – there are many different ways to distribute initial private companies and starting major corporations.
* Private Companies – most &quot;18XX&quot; games have private companies which are entirely owned by one player, and represent the earliest companies in the game and/or provide special abilities. &quot;Privates&quot;, as they are called, generally do little other than provide revenue, but in some games they control access to or enhance the revenue of certain hexes on the map. Some games have very similar private companies, some have very different private companies, and some dispense with having private companies at all. Some titles (e.g., &quot;1835&quot; and &quot;1861&quot;) also have Minor Companies, which are again owned entirely by one player but play a more dynamic role than Privates.
* Corporation Funding – some games have full funding for a corporation as soon as it floats, while others have the company receiving money only as each share is sold. Some games require the corporation to reach a historically relevant destination in order to receive some of its capital or earn the best level of income.
* Company Types – some games have multiple company types. These types may vary based on how many shares are available for purchase, the funding model for the company, the number of station tokens available, or which types of trains may be purchased by the company.
* Corporate mergers and demergers – some games feature optional, or forced, mergers or splits of one or more companies.
* Corporate stock-ownership – some games enable companies to hold their own stock, purchase private corporations, and/or own the stock of other companies (even to the point of owning or as prelude to merger).
* Train Types – some may offer multiple types of trains with distinct capabilities or lifetimes.
** Some trains may &quot;degrade&quot; into other train types upon certain events (for example, delayed obsolescence of 4-trains in &quot;18MEX&quot;, or normal trains becoming H-trains in &quot;1844&quot;).
** Trains may become available in unusual sequences. For example, in &quot;1830&quot;, diesel engines are available as soon as the first 6-train is purchased — all the 6-trains are not required to be purchased first. In &quot;1824&quot;, G-train availability is controlled by when normal trains are purchased.
** Certain trains may be restricted in terms of which locations they may run to or may count revenue from, or they may provide bonuses for running to certain locations. For example, in &quot;1844&quot;, H-trains are prohibited from running to off-board locations. In &quot;1854&quot;, only Orient Express trains may run to certain off-board areas. In &quot;1889&quot;, diesels get special bonuses for off-board locations. In &quot;1826&quot;, E-trains and TGVs ignore dot-towns. TGVs in 1826 and 4D-trains in &quot;18MEX&quot; double the value of cities they count. In &quot;1824&quot;, only G-trains may run to mines and the corporation always gets the value of the mine rather than it being potentially paid to stockholders.
* Theme – a few titles eschew the common railroad/stock-market theme. For example, &quot;2038&quot; involves space exploration of the asteroid belt, while &quot;Ur, 1830 BC&quot; involves building dams and canals in ancient Mesopotamia (in the latter game, &quot;corporations&quot;, &quot;presidents&quot; and stock &quot;shares&quot; are represented by kingdoms, rulers and parcels of land).

== Conventions and tournaments ==
A number of conventions have at least some emphasis on 18XX games, including the Chattanooga Rail Gaming Challenge, held in January or February in Chattanooga, Tennessee and run by Mark Derrick. 18XX games also figure prominently in various &quot;RailCon&quot; and &quot;Puffing Billy&quot; tournaments at many conventions.

== Play by email and Online ==
18xx games are often played remotely using various tools that support 
play by email games.

Many games in the genre are implemented on 18xx.games , which is open-source and supports both multiplayer and local play.

Another open source project which supports a large number of 18xx titles is BOARD18.
BOARD18 was designed for use in play by email games and is not recommended for live play.
==Publishers==
Following Tresham&#x27;s initial design, many different designers and publishers have made games using the same basic mechanics and theming. Today, many different publishers offer 18XX games. Some of the most notable include:
*All-Aboard Games, a publisher dedicated solely to 18XX games
*GMT Games, notable for its collaborations with designer Tom Lehmann (also known for the Race for the Galaxy series)
*Golden Spike Games, which manufactures games by hand for Deep Thought Games (a now-inactive publisher of 18XX games)
*Grand Trunk Games, publishing previously self-published titles
*Lonny Games, a German publisher reprinting games and the original designs of Leonhard Orgler
*Marflow Games, a German publisher mainly publishing the designs of Wolfram Janich
*TraXX Games, offering print-and-play titles
*18Wood, offering mainly handmade 18XX accessories

== List of 18XX titles ==
The 18XX series is prolific, with many different publishers offering games and many fans designing and self-publishing titles in the series as well. The website BoardGameGeek lists 293 titles (including games and expansions) in the series as of January 2025. Not all of these titles are necessarily in production: many titles are only available as print-and-play games, offering rules and digital assets but requiring fans to print and assemble the games independently.

Due to the large number of games, the disparate designers and publishers, and the question of what constitutes a complete 18XX game, it is difficult to create an exhaustive list of all 18XX titles. This list contains the most notable titles from major publishers as well as some notable self-published 18XX titles.

;&quot;1761: From Canal to Rail&quot;: Self-published in 2011, and then in 2017 by All-Aboard Games and designed by Ian D. Wilson. &quot;1761&quot; is set in England, with its early game focused on building canals and portrays the eventual fading away of canal companies as rail companies start to dominate.
;&quot;1800: Colorado&quot;: Set in Colorado, the game was published in 2002 by David Methany in &quot;Rail Gamer&quot; magazine #17 and was later available in free print-and-play format. The game was designed by Antonio Leal. A mini-18XX game for 2–3 players, and consists of only nine playable hexes.
;&quot;1817&quot;: Designed by Craig Bartell and Tim Flowers and published by Deep Thought Games in 2009 and subsequently by All-Aboard Games in 2012 and 2020. &quot;1817&quot;, set in the United States, is well-known as one of the heaviest 18XX titles in term of complexity and game length. It offers a complex financial system with features such as short selling, market-driven interest rates, and company liquidations. An expansion, &quot;18USA&quot;, published in 2017 (self-published), 2018, and 2021 (by All-Aboard Games) offers new contents and a randomizing of elements of the game.
;&quot;1822: The Railways of Great Britain&quot;: Designed by Simon Cutforth and published 2016 by All-Aboard Games. Set in Great Britain, the game offers several unique features such as historical destinations for companies and new local trains. The game was the winner of &quot;Golden Elephant Award&quot; for &quot;Best Heavy Game of 2016&quot; by Heavy Cardboard.
;&quot;1822CA&quot;: Designed by Robert Lecuyer and Simon Cutforth, and published 2018 by All-Aboard Games. This game, also strongly based on &quot;1822: The Railways of Great Britain&quot;, takes place in Canada, features a larger number of private companies, and includes an innovative scale change halfway across the map to account for the larger expanse between cities in Western Canada.
;&quot;1822MX&quot;: Inspired by &quot;1822: The Railways of Great Britain&quot;, the game (set in Mexico) was designed by Scott Petersen and published by All-Aboard Games in 2019.
;&quot;1822PNW&quot;: Designed by Ken Kuhn and published 2023 by All-Aboard Games and inspired by &quot;1822: The Railways of Great Britain&quot;; takes place in the mountainous Pacific Northwest.
;&quot;1824: Austria-Hungary&quot;: &quot;1824&quot; was published by Double-O Games in 2005. The game was designed by Leonard &quot;Lonny&quot; Orgler and Helmut Ohley, and is set in Austria-Hungary. It is a smaller and simpler version of Lonny&#x27;s &quot;1837&quot;, and adds some ideas from his later &quot;1854&quot; and Helmut&#x27;s &quot;1844&quot;. Publisher Fox in the Box and Lonny Games re-implemented the game in 2019 under the title &quot;1824: Austrian-Hungarian Railway&quot;.
;&quot;1825&quot;: Great Britain, released 1995 (Unit 1) by Hartland Trefoil, 2000 (Unit 2) and 2004 (Unit 3) by Tresham Games, designed by Francis Tresham. The game has subsequently had many revisions, reprints, add-on kits and variants.
;&quot;1826: Railroading in France and Belgium from 1826&quot;: &quot;1826&quot; was published by Chris Lawson in 2000 and Deep Thought Games in 2004 and set in France and Belgium. As David Hecht&#x27;s first design, it is the most conventional, and only one to use &quot;traditional&quot; green and brown plain track upgrade tiles. 1826 started out as &quot;&quot;1830&quot; on a different map&quot;, but rapidly evolved into a game of capital and technology management: the game&#x27;s key decisions revolve around when to &quot;grow&quot; a company, and which trains to buy to optimize a company&#x27;s final position.
;&quot;1829 Mainline&quot;: England, released 2005 by Tresham Games, designed by Francis Tresham.
;&quot;1829 (South)&quot; and &quot;1829 (North)&quot;: &quot;1829 (South)&quot; was the first game in the 18XX series, published by Hartland Trefoil Ltd (UK) in 1974 from an original design by Francis Tresham. A second version, &quot;1829 (North)&quot; was published in 1981. The game has subsequently had many revisions, reprints, add-on kits and variants.
;&quot;1830: The Game of Railroads and Robber Barons&quot;: &quot;1830&quot; was published by Avalon Hill in 1986, and its popularity led to the creation of many other 18XX games. The game has subsequently had many revisions, reprints, add-on kits and variants. The latest English editions were published in 2011 and 2021 by Mayfair Games and Lookout Games, respectively, under the title &quot;1830: Railways &amp; Robber Barons&quot;. Set in eastern United States.
;&quot;1832: The South&quot;: &quot;1832&quot; was published by Deep Thought Games in 2006. The game was designed by Bill Dixon and is set in the Southeastern United States. It retains the new rules Bill introduced in 1850 and 1870 for share price protection, stock redeeming, and reissuing, while adding new rules to model the mergers that shaped the South&#x27;s railroads.
;&quot;1835&quot;: &quot;1835&quot; was designed and published by Hans im Glück in 1990 and distributed in the United States by Mayfair Games. The game board covers most of Germany. It was the first 18XX game use the concept of &#x27;minor&#x27; companies, which operated like the normal stock companies (with some limitations) but are owned by a single person like a private company.
;&quot;1837: Rail Building in the Austro-Hungarian Empire&quot;: Set in Austria-Hungary, self-published and designed 1994 by Leonard &quot;Lonny&quot; Orgler. It was subsequently republished in 2021 by All-Aboard Games.
;&quot;1837 Saxony&quot;: The game, an updated version of &quot;1837SX&quot; and &quot;18SX&quot; by the same designer Wolfram Janich, was published in 2022 by Spielworxx. As the title suggests, it is set in the Saxony region.
;&quot;1838: Rheinland&quot;: Designed and self-published by Wolfram Janich in 2003, and set in the Rhineland region. &quot;18Rhl-Rhineland&quot;, a newer version, was published in 2007 by Marflow Games.
;&quot;1839&quot;: Published in 1993 by Diabolo and designed by Paul Stouthard and Rob van Wijngaarden. Set in the Netherlands. The designers hand-made only 32 copies of the game.
;&quot;1840: Vienna Tramways&quot;: Designed by Leonard Orgler and published through Lonny Games in 2020, the game is unique in that it focuses on the building of tram transport systems rather than heavy rails. It is set in Vienna, Austria. Also innovative is the availability of the best trains from the very start, albeit with reduced income as they grow older.
;&quot;1841: Railways in Northern Italy&quot;: &quot;1841&quot; was published by Chris Lawson in 1996. The game was designed by Federico Vellani with assistance from Manlio Manzini and is set in Italy. With its complicated financial rules and very steep train gradient (i.e., the trains get very expensive very quickly), it emphasizes stock manipulation and funding train purchases over route building.
;&quot;1842: Schleswig Holstein&quot;: Self-published in 1992 by Wolfram Janich through Marflow Games and set in the Schleswig-Holstein province of Germany.
;&quot;1844: Schweiz&quot;: &quot;1844&quot; was designed and published by Helmut Ohley in 2003 and set in Switzerland. Peter Minder collected extensive background materials and drew the map. The game was republished (with revisions) as &quot;1844/1854&quot; in 2016.
;&quot;1844/1854&quot;: A 2016 Mayfair Games and Lookout Games republishing and re-packaging of &quot;1844&quot; and &quot;1854&quot; in one box with various changes.
;&quot;1846: The Race for the Midwest&quot;: &quot;1846&quot; was published by Deep Thought Games in 2005, with a second edition by GMT Games in 2016. The game was designed by Tom Lehmann and is set in the Midwestern United States. It features a linear stock market (like 1829), &quot;N&quot;/&quot;M&quot; trains (which count &quot;N&quot; cities but may run through &quot;M&quot; total cities) and a simplified private company distribution. Another unusual feature is that the number of corporations, private companies, and the bank size all scale with the number of players, and the resulting game is shorter than most 18XX games.
;&quot;1847: Pfalz&quot;: Set in the German Pfalz area, the game was self-published in 1996 by its designer Wolfram Janich. An Anniversary Edition was published in 2015.
;&quot;1848: Australia&quot;: The game was published in 2007 by Double-O Games, designed by Helmut Ohley and Leonhard &quot;Lonny&quot; Orgler. It is set in Australia. 1848 was unique in that it includes the Bank of England as a public company that extends loans and administers railroads that are in receivership. A newer 2022 version was published by GMT Games.
;&quot;1849: The Game of Sicilian Railways&quot;: Set in Sicily. The game was designed by Federico Vellani and released in 1998 by Chris Lawson. A newer 2021 version was published by All-Aboard games.
;&quot;1850&quot;: &quot;1850&quot; was published by Deep Thought Games in 2006. The game was designed by Bill Dixon and is set in the upper Midwestern United States. It retains the rules Bill introduced in &quot;1870&quot; for share price protection and stock redeeming/reissuing.
;&quot;1851: Kentucky and Tennessee&quot;: Set in the Tennessee, the game was released 1998 by Chris Lawson, designed by Mark Derrick and Chris Lawson. It&#x27;s a streamlined 18XX game designed for smaller groups with a shorter playing time.
;&quot;1853&quot;: Set in India, designed by Francis Tresham, and published in 1989 by Hartland Trefoil. Mayfair Games and Lookout Games released a revised, newer version in 2009.
;&quot;1854&quot;: &quot;1854&quot; was published by both Leonard &quot;Lonny&quot; Orgler in 2002 and Deep Thought Games in 2005. The game was designed by Lonny Orgler and is set in Austria. It features a hexagonal stock market, local railways which operate on a smaller map (which takes place on two hexes of the large map), mail contracts, 150% capitalization, and player share options. There are also tunnels which allow you to build under other track and terrain features, such as avoiding small cities. The local railways eventually grow up to be regional railroads operating on the main map, and the tradeoff between getting good revenues on the local map versus getting locked out of important locations on the main map is an important decision to make. The game was republished (with revisions) as &quot;1844/1854&quot; in 2016.
;&quot;1856: Railroading in Upper Canada from 1856&quot;: &quot;1856&quot; was published by Mayfair Games in 1995 and was designed by Bill Dixon. The game is set in Upper Canada, including the upper reaches of the St. Lawrence River, and the Toronto to Detroit area for southern Ontario.
;&quot;1858: The Railways of Iberia&quot;: &quot;1858&quot; was designed by Ian D. Wilson, and published in 2012 by All-Aboard Games. &quot;1858&quot; is set in Spain and Portugal in the late 19th to early 20th centuries
;&quot;1860: Railways on the Isle of Wight&quot;: Set in the Isle of Wight, the game was released 2004 by JKLM Games, designed by Mike Hutton. Z-Man Games published a second edition in 2010, and All-Aboard Games published the newest edition in 2022.
;&quot;1861: The Railways of the Russian Empire&quot;: Set in Russia, the game was released by JKLM Games in 2006 and by All-Aboard Games in 2012. It was designed by Ian D. Wilson and features a non-player controlled government railway.
;&quot;1861/1867: Railways of Russia/Canada&quot;: Published in 2020 as a package containing the two games &quot;1861&quot; and &quot;1867&quot; by Grand Trunk Games.
;&quot;1862&quot;: &quot;1862&quot; was designed and published by Helmut Ohley in 2000. The game covers the entire width of the United States and parts of Canada.
;&quot;1862: Railway Mania in the Eastern Counties&quot;: East Anglia, England; designed by Mike Hutton and published in 2013. The game was famous for a few unique features; among them was petitioning the parliament as a mean to float new companies and three different train types available. It was re-released by GMT Games in 2019.
;&quot;1865: Sardinia&quot;: Designed by Alessandro Lala and published by Gotha Games in 2011, &quot;1865&quot; is set in Sardinia and features the Dragon, a non-player foreign investor who trade in certificates between players. It also contains the Traffic system, which makes calculating company revenues easier.
;&quot;1867: Railways of Canada&quot;: Set in Canada and designed by Ian D. Wilson, the game was originally set as an expansion to &quot;1861&quot; in 2015 (published by All-Aboard Games), but was released as a standalone game in 2017 by Grand Trunk Games.
;&quot;1868&quot;: Set in Uruguay and designed by John Bohrer. As usual with Winsome 18XX games, a copy of 1830 is required to play, largely due to the need for the tiles. 1868 has a shorter playing time than 1830 and includes a number of little companies, a delayed fifth railroad and a bit of South American history. For 3-5 players for about 3 hours.
;&quot;1870: Railroading across the Trans Mississippi from 1870&quot;: The game is set in the Mississippi Valley and central United States, released in 1992 by Mayfair Games, and designed by Bill Dixon.
;&quot;Harzbahn 1873&quot;: &quot;Harzbahn 1873,&quot; set in the Harz mountains in Germany, was designed by Klaus Kiermeier and initially self-published in 2011 in German. It was later republished by All-Aboard Games in 2014 and 2021 in English, and by Marflow Games in 2017 in German. &quot;Harzbahn 1873&quot; includes independent and public mining companies which can purchase trains as &quot;machines&quot; to improve their revenue and the revenue earned by train companies running past mines, a unique method of revenue calculation (a 4-train runs 4 connected routes of arbitrary length), and a maintenance mechanic that replaces train rusting.
;&quot;1880: China&quot;: Set in China and designed by Helmut Ohley and Leonhard &quot;Lonny&quot; Orgler, this game was self-published through Double-O Games in 2010 and 2016. Lookout Games worked with the designers to republish a new third edition in 2022. The game is unique in that the turn order for companies are set along with the starting par price, and players could manipulate the Stock Round-Operation Round ratio.
;&quot;1882: Assiniboia&quot;: Designed by Marc Voyer and published by All-Aboard Games in 2020, &quot;1882&quot; is set in the historical Assiniboia region of Canada and depicts the Canadian Prairies railway boom.
;&quot;Shikoku 1889&quot;: &quot;1889&quot; was published by both Wild Heaven Productions in 2004 and Deep Thought Games in 2006. The game was designed by Yasutaka Ikeda and is set in Shikoku, Japan. The rules for &quot;1889&quot; are essentially the same as &quot;1830&quot;, except on a much smaller and terrain-heavy map and different privates. The goal is to make a quick and relatively simple game which explores the history of railroads on Shikoku. A new 2022 version was published by Grand Trunk Games.
;&quot;1890&quot;: Set in Osaka metropolitan area, Japan, the game was designed by Shin-ichi Takasaki and released in 1999 by Nobuhiro Izumi.
;&quot;1895 Namibia&quot;: Designed by Helmut Ohley and Adam Romoth and self-published through Double-O Games in 2004, the game is set in Namibia, one of the few 18XX titles to be set in the Africa continent.
;&quot;1899&quot;: A variant of the &quot;1830&quot; played on a new map set in China and Korea. It was designed by Dirk Clemens and Ingo Meyer and released by Chris Lawson in 1994.
;&quot;18??&quot;: A variant in a form of add-on kit for &quot;1870&quot; played on a somewhat larger fictionalized map, with additional privates and other rules variations. Designed by Allen Sliwinski and self-published by Scott Petersen through All-Aboard Games.
;&quot;18AL&quot;: &quot;18AL&quot; was self-published by Mark Derrick in 1999 and later by John David Galt. It is set in Alabama, United States and aims to provide a quicker and simpler introduction to the 18XX series. It is very similar to &quot;18GA&quot;.
;&quot;18C2C&quot;: &quot;18C2C&quot; (aka &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;) was published by Designs in Creative Entertainment in 2003. The game was designed by Mark Frazier and covers the entire United States and Southern Canada. This is an extremely large game that attempts to model the entire history of railroading in the United States, and accordingly takes a long time to play. It consists of a 38&quot;x68&quot; map, 34 public companies, 18 private companies, and 108 trains.
;&quot;18Chesapeake&quot;: The game, designed to provide a full 18XX experience for newcomers to the series, was published in 2020 by All-Aboard Games, and designed by Scott Petersen. It&#x27;s similar to &quot;1830&quot;, with a smaller map focused on the Chesapeake Bay area and a train export mechanic which improves gameplay pace.
;&quot;18CZ&quot;: Designed by Leonard Orgler and published by Fox in the Box and Lonny Games in 2017, the game is set in the Czech Republic. It features three different corporation sizes with their own share size distributions. Each company sizes own different sets of trains, and larger companies can absorb smaller ones.
;&quot;18Dixie with 18MS and 18GA&quot;: Published in 2015 by Deep Thought Games and designed by John Merrick, it is set in the Deep South US during the post-Civil War Reconstruction era. Also includes two upgraded smaller games: &quot;18GA&quot; and &quot;18MS&quot;.
;&quot;18DO: Dortmund&quot;: Designed by Wolfram Janich and Michael Scharf and published by Fox in the Box and Marflow Games in 2020, &quot;18DO&quot; focuses on both the development of railway around Dortmund and its burgeoning breweries.
;&quot;18EU&quot;: &quot;18EU&quot; was published by Deep Thought Games in 2004. The game was designed by David G.D. Hecht, and is set in the heart of Europe, reaching from Paris and London to Rome, Budapest and Warsaw. &quot;18EU&quot; is a compact game, played on four map panels. Unlike most 18XX games, there are no private companies, and before the sale of the first 5 train, share companies may only be started indirectly. When the game starts, fifteen minor companies (similar to the &quot;forerunner&quot; companies in &quot;1835&quot;, &quot;1837&quot; and &quot;1824&quot;) are auctioned off. These companies represent regional or private-sector rail companies. There are eight possible share companies, and before the first 5 train at least one minor company must be merged into a share company to form it.
;&quot;18FL&quot;: &quot;18FL&quot; was published by Deep Thought Games in 2006. The game was designed by David G.D. Hecht and is set in Florida, United States. It is very similar to Mark Derrick&#x27;s &quot;18AL&quot; and &quot;18GA&quot; in that it is a simple game intended as an introduction to the 18XX game system for new players. Unlike the two mentioned games, the &quot;ultimate&quot; train is a 6 (or a 3E) train. This means that 4 trains never become obsolete, and the greatest difficulty in a small game (and the greatest deterrent for new players), a massive &quot;train rush&quot; when permanent trains are first available, is substantially mitigated.
;&quot;18GA&quot;: &quot;18GA&quot; was self-published by Mark Derrick in 1998 and later by John David Galt. It is set in Georgia, United States and aims to provide a quicker and simpler introduction to the 18XX series. It is very similar to &quot;18AL&quot;. The game was republished in a package with &quot;18Dixie&quot; in 2015.
;&quot;18GB: The Railways of Great Britain&quot;: &quot;18GB&quot; was published by Deep Thought Games in 2018. It was designed by Dave Berry and is set in Great Britain. It combines elements of &quot;1860&quot; and &quot;1830&quot;, and features a twist to the usual 18XX rules for laying tiles.
;&quot;18GL&quot;: &quot;18GL&quot; was published by Deep Thought Games in 2006. The game was designed by Gary Mroczka and is set in the Great Lakes area of United States. It uses basically the same rules as David G.D. Hecht&#x27;s &quot;1826&quot; (specifically, H-trains, loans, trainless companies get merged into a government railroad) except that there are no destinations, there is only one merger, and instead of TGV trains there are Diesel trains. The map is quite different, and the private companies have the effect of altering how the map develops depending on the combinations of private companies and corporations particular players get.
;&quot;18GM: The 18XX GameMaster&quot;: Self-published in 1996 by designers Colin Barnhorst and Kristopher Marquardt. &quot;18GM&quot; is an 18XX game development kit with modular boards which permits many different scenarios to be designed and played out.
;&quot;18HeXX&quot;: A variable-geometry 18XX map system, designed and self-published in 2000 by Mike Schneider
;&quot;18Ireland&quot;: Set in Ireland, the game was web-published in 2016 and designed by Ian Scrivins. It was republished in 2017 by All-Aboard Games.
;&quot;18Kaas&quot;: Set in Utrecht, Netherlands, and self-published in 1992 by Erno Eekelschot through ERJO Games.
;&quot;18Lilliput&quot;: Designed by Leonard Orgler and published by Fox in the Box and Lonny Games in 2018, this game was noted for its innovative elements which stayed true to the 18XX spirit but provides a fresh and light experience for players. Actions are picked based on a set of action cards in a common pool. As the title suggest, the game was set in the fictional land of Lilliput.
;&quot;18Mag: Hungarian Railway History&quot;: Designed by Leonard Orgler and published by Lonny Games in 2021, &quot;18Mag&quot; recreates the history of Hungarian railroads and companies. The game features, in addition to the usual operating railroad companies, seven service companies which provides special supporting effects to its owners. All trains are also available from the start of the game.
;&quot;18MEX&quot;: &quot;18MEX&quot; was published by Deep Thought Games in 2005 and by All-Aboard Games as a second edition in 2020. The game was designed by Mark Derrick and is set in Mexico. The moderate length game features minor and major railroads, as well as government ones.
;&quot;18MS: The Railroads Come to Mississippi&quot;: The standalone version of &quot;18MS&quot; was published by All-Aboard Games in 2020 and designed by Mark Derrick. A lighter 18XX game set in Mississippi and Alabama. The older 2015 version was only available in the same package with &quot;19Dixie&quot;.
;&quot;18Namibia&quot;: Designed by Helmut Ohley and Adam Romoth. Reimplements &quot;1895 Namibia&quot;.
;&quot;18NEB&quot;: &quot;18NEB&quot; was published by Deep Thought Games in 2010. Designed by Matthew Campbell, it supports 2–4 players and plays in 2–4 hours. It is set in Nebraska, United States.
;&quot;18NL&quot;: Set in Netherlands, the game was self-published in 1999 and 2005 by Wolfram Janich through Marflow Games. It uses the same system as &quot;1830&quot; over a new map.
;&quot;18NW: Railroading in the &quot;Great Northwest&quot;&quot;: Designed and self-published by Gary Mroczka in 2017. Set in the US Pacific Northwest and surrounding areas.
;&quot;18NY&quot;: Designed by Pierre LeBoeuf, published by Deep Thought Games in 2011. Set in the New York state and surrounding areas. All-Aboard Games will publish a new version in 2023 through its fifth Kickstarter wave of projects.
;&quot;18OE: On the Rails of the Orient Express&quot;: Designed by Edward Sindelar and published by Designs In Creative Entertainment in 2014. The large game (rivaling those of the likes of &quot;18C2C&quot;) covers the entire Europe and features a staggering five types of companies.
;&quot;18SA&quot;: &quot;18SA&quot;, set in South America, designed by Peter Mette and published by Marflow Games in 2015, is a feature-rich and moderately complex entry in the 18XX series, such as different tokens for different kinds of trains, and extra costs for laying tracks across countries.
;&quot;18Scan&quot;: &quot;18Scan&quot; was published by Deep Thought Games in 2005. The game, set in the Scandinavia, is one of the smaller 18XX titles, and was designed by David G.D. Hecht in order to introduce gamers to some of the more &quot;exotic&quot; systems used in other designs. &quot;18Scan&quot; includes &quot;1835&quot;-style minor companies, an &quot;1835&quot;-style merger corporation, &quot;1870&quot;-style destination rules (for the minor companies), &quot;1856&quot;-style company flotation rules, and market-priced incremental capitalization rules as in &quot;1851&quot; and &quot;1826&quot;.
;&quot;18SJ: Railway in the Frozen North&quot;: Designed by Örjan Wennman and self-published in 2021 (with a newer edition publishing in 2023 by All-Aboard Games), &quot;18SJ&quot; is set in the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway during the formative years of Nordic railways. The game features nationalization of public railway corporations.
;&quot;18Svea&quot;: Designed by Jonas Jones and self-published in 2022. 18Svea is one of the smallest and fastest 18XX games around with less than two hours playtime taking place on a map with only ten hexes in total. Designed for two or three players.
;&quot;18TN&quot;: &quot;18TN&quot; was published by Deep Thought Games in 2006. The game was designed by Mark Derrick originally in 1996, and upon discussions with Chris Lawson it was modified and published by Chris as &quot;1851&quot; in 1998. The two games were sufficiently different that the publication of the original was warranted. It is set in Tennessee.
;&quot;18US&quot;: &quot;18US&quot; was published in 2006 by Deep Thought Games. The game, designed by David G.D. Hecht as an &quot;advanced&quot; 18XX game, is set in the continental United States. Unlike 18C2C or other, similar products, it is a very compact game: the entire &quot;Lower 48&quot; only takes up two map panels.
;&quot;18VA&quot;: &quot;18VA&quot; was published by Deep Thought Games in 2005. The game, designed by David G.D. Hecht, is a smaller 18xx game, originally intended to be similar in scope to Mark Derrick&#x27;s &quot;one-state&quot; games &quot;18AL&quot; and &quot;18GA&quot;. Set in Virginia and Maryland, it is slightly more complex than the two mentioned.
;&quot;18West&quot;: &quot;18West&quot; was published in 2007 by Deep Thought Games. The game, designed by David G.D. Hecht, is set in the western United States. Many of the mechanics are quite different from other 18XX games, such as three different kinds of companies (including the Grange Road) and subsidized track laying. All-Aboard Games published a new version of the game in 2020.
;&quot;2038: Tycoons of the Asteroid Belt&quot;: &quot;2038&quot;, by Tom Lehmann, has the game mechanics of an 18XX railroad game but with an asteroid mining theme. Its financial aspects are fairly similar to those of &quot;1835&quot;, including a set of minor companies and a larger merger company. Its board features include asteroid mines that can be improved (the equivalent of cities), a small exploration reward for companies which explore asteroids (the equivalent of laying a tile, but requiring a spaceship/train), and two different types of corporations (those that start with full monetary assets and &quot;growth companies&quot;, which start with fewer assets and a lower stock price but retain earnings from their unsold stock). The game was published in 1995 by Prism Games and TimJim Games.
;&quot;21Moon&quot;: Published in 2020 by All-Aboard Games and designed by Jonas Jones, the futuristic game is set in 2117 on the Moon. Players must build a network of transportation to support the resource mining efforts on the Earth&#x27;s natural satellite.
;&quot;Poseidon&quot;: Set in the Aegean Sea during the Ancient Greece period, designed by Helmut Ohley and Lonny Orgler, with artworks drawn by Klemens Franz, and published through Lookout Games and Z-Man Games in 2010, is a shorter two-hours 18XX game with shipping lines instead of railroads.
;&quot;Powerrails&quot;: Designed and self-published by Tom Schoeps in 1999. The game, based on &quot;1830&quot; and &quot;1835&quot;, uses eleven small A4-sized map boards with only a handful of hexes and a small set of special rules for each of them.
;&quot;Steam Over Holland&quot;: Set in the 1839 Netherlands, the game was designed by Bart van Dijk and published by Vendetta in 2007.
;&quot;Railways of the Lost Atlas&quot;: Designed by Kevin Delger and Jacob Schacht, and published by Asterisk Games in 2024, RotLA features a variable-geometry modular board with divergent corporate abilities and mergers, with many variant options.
;&quot;Ur: 1830 BC&quot;: The game is loosely adapted from the 18XX series, and features irrigation and kingdom management in ancient Mesopotamia. It was designed by Jeroen Doumen and Joris Wiersinga and published by Splotter Spellen in 2001. Its play centers around ownership of valuable networks, replacing the rail networks found in most 18XX games with irrigation canals, shares with parcels of land, companies with kingdoms, trains with irrigation technologies (such as reservoirs and pumps), and presidents with kings. Networks of canals and waterworks generate income by irrigating lands within kingdoms.

<doc id="739677" wikidata="Q2578463" url="?curid=739677" title="William Dennison (Canadian politician)">
<text>William Donald Dennison (January 20, 1905 – May 2, 1981) was a Canadian social-democratic politician who served in both the Ontario Legislative Assembly and finally as the City of Toronto&#x27;s mayor. He served two nonconsecutive terms as a Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in the 1940s and early 1950s. After his provincial-level career, he focused on Toronto&#x27;s municipal politics, holding offices as an alderman, member of the Toronto Board of Control, and finally as the city&#x27;s mayor. He was the mayor from 1967 to 1972, winning two consecutive three-year terms. Prior to entering politics, he was a school principal and teacher. As of 2022, he was the last mayor of Toronto to be a member of the Orange Order.

==Background==
Dennison grew up on a farm in Renfrew County. He first left home at age 15 to work in the lumber camps of Northern Ontario. As a young man, he would trek west to Saskatchewan in the summers to earn money helping with the harvest and pitching grain. By night, he would educate himself by reading Little Blue Books.

As a child and a young man he stammered to the point where he struggled to pronounce his name, although after several attempts to manage his stammering, first at a school in Kitchener and later at a school in New York City, he learned how to control it himself, opening his own School of Speech Correction.

==Politics==

===UFO/CCF===
Dennison was a member of the United Farmers of Ontario in the 1920s, and became a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and its successor, the New Democratic Party. He was the CCF candidate in the Rosedale electoral district during the 1935 federal election: he placed third.

He won a seat in the 1943 provincial election as the Ontario CCF Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) representing St. David electoral district in downtown Toronto. He defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Roland Michener, a future Governor General of Canada. In the legislature, Dennison was an early environmentalist. As an early conservationist, in the 1940s, he tried to stop the de Havilland aircraft factory from polluting Black Creek. He also tried to force the government to stop a pulp and paper mill from polluting the Spanish River. In 1946 he personally planted 40,000 trees. Michener defeated Dennison in the 1945 provincial election, but Dennison regained the seat in the 1948 election. Dennison lost his seat for the last time during the Conservative sweep that left the Ontario CCF with only two seats in the 1951 provincial election.

===City of Toronto===
In 1938, he was elected a school trustee and served three successive one-year terms. In 1941 and 1943 he won election to serve as an alderman on Toronto City Council for Ward 2 (Cabbagetown and Rosedale) After a ten-year interlude with his involvement in provincial politics, Dennison returned to Toronto City Council in 1953 serving again as an alderman for Ward 2. In 1958, he was elected to the Toronto Board of Control. On council he interrogated other politicians and officials on conflict of interest, expense accounts, and their relationships with companies doing business with the city. He ran to be Toronto&#x27;s mayor in 1966, campaigning on providing &quot;a strong voice for labour in city affairs&quot; and opposing the pro-development policies of incumbent Philip Givens. He was elected despite being opposed by all three daily newspapers. He was the first member of the CCF or NDP to serve as mayor of Toronto since James Simpson in 1935, and the last until Barbara Hall.

He opposed the early Eaton Centre development plan that would have seen the demolition of Toronto&#x27;s Old City Hall, Dennison was a pro-labour mayor but later became more conservative in response to early criticism. Serving as mayor during the Canadian Centennial, he urged the organizers of Caribana to make it a recurring event.

He generally favoured development and complained about hippies and deserters from the US military flocking to the city, saying that &quot;a few hippies and deserters are Toronto&#x27;s only problem.&quot; He decided not to run again for mayor, and due to a prostate operation, watched the 1972 municipal election from a bed at St. Michael&#x27;s Hospital.

==Retirement and death==
Dennison and his wife Dorothy (née Bainbridge) had a Christmas tree farm in Caledon East, where they went to get away from the city. He was also a beekeeper, and at one point, had 900,000 bees living in his Jarvis Street home&#x27;s backyard. During his retirement, the Dennisons would vacation in Florida during the winter months. While vacationing in the United States, a medical emergency arose due to his Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and it finally forced him to be evacuated back to Toronto in April 1981. He died at Toronto General Hospital from complications due to Parkinson&#x27;s Disease on May 2, 1981. Their only child, Lorna Dennison Milne, was a community activist who was appointed to the Senate of Canada, sitting in the Red Chamber as a Liberal from 1995 to 2009.

<doc id="739680" wikidata="Q1044646" url="?curid=739680" title="New Journalism">
<text>New Journalism is a style of news writing and journalism, developed in the 1960s and 1970s, that uses literary techniques unconventional at the time. It is characterized by a subjective perspective, a literary style reminiscent of long-form non-fiction. Using extensive imagery, reporters interpolate subjective language within facts whilst immersing themselves in the stories as they reported and wrote them. In traditional journalism, the journalist is &quot;invisible&quot;; facts are meant to be reported objectively.

The term was codified with its current meaning by Tom Wolfe in a 1973 collection of journalism articles he published as &quot;The New Journalism&quot;, which included works by himself, Truman Capote, Hunter S. Thompson, Norman Mailer, Joan Didion, Terry Southern, Robert Christgau, Gay Talese and others.

Articles in the New Journalism style tended not to be found in newspapers, but in magazines such as &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;CoEvolution Quarterly&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and for a short while in the early 1970s, &quot;Scanlan&#x27;s Monthly&quot;.

Contemporary journalists and writers questioned the &quot;currency&quot; of New Journalism and its qualification as a distinct genre. The subjective nature of New Journalism received extensive exploration: one critic suggested the genre&#x27;s practitioners functioned more as sociologists and psychoanalysts than as journalists. Criticism has been leveled at numerous individual writers in the genre, as well.

==Precursors and alternate uses of the term==
Various people and tendencies throughout the history of American journalism have been labeled &quot;new journalism&quot;. Robert E. Park, for instance, in his &quot;Natural History of the Newspaper&quot;, referred to the advent of the penny press in the 1830s as &quot;new journalism&quot;. Likewise, the appearance of the yellow press—papers such as Joseph Pulitzer&#x27;s &quot;New York World&quot; in the 1880s—led journalists and historians to proclaim that a &quot;New Journalism&quot; had been created. Ault and Emery, for instance, said &quot;[i]ndustrialization and urbanization changed the face of America during the latter half of the Nineteenth century, and its newspapers entered an era known as that of the &#x27;New Journalism. John Hohenberg, in &quot;The Professional Journalist&quot; (1960), called the interpretive reporting which developed after World War II a &quot;new journalism which not only seeks to explain as well as to inform; it even dares to teach, to measure, to evaluate.&quot;

During the 1960s and 1970s, the term enjoyed widespread popularity, often with meanings bearing manifestly little or no connection with one another. Although James E. Murphy noted that &quot;...most uses of the term seem to refer to something no more specific than vague new directions in journalism&quot;, Curtis D. MacDougal devoted the preface of the sixth edition of his &quot;Interpretative Reporting&quot; to New Journalism and cataloged many of the contemporary definitions: &quot;Activist, advocacy, participatory, tell-it-as-you-see-it, sensitivity, investigative, saturation, humanistic, reformist and a few more.&quot;

&quot;The Magic Writing Machine—Student Probes of the New Journalism&quot;, a collection edited and introduced by Everette E. Dennis, came up with six categories, labelled new nonfiction (reportage), alternative journalism (&quot;modern muckraking&quot;), advocacy journalism, underground journalism and precision journalism. Michael Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The New Journalism&quot; addresses itself to three phenomena: the underground press, the artists of nonfiction, and changes in the established media.

===First usage===

Matthew Arnold is credited with coining the term &quot;New Journalism&quot; in 1887, which went on to define an entire genre of newspaper history, particularly Lord Northcliffe&#x27;s turn-of-the-century press empire. However, at the time, the target of Arnold&#x27;s irritation was not Northcliffe, but the sensational journalism of &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; editor W. T. Stead. He strongly disapproved of the muck-raking Stead, and declared that, under this editor, &quot;the P.M.G., whatever may be its merits, is fast ceasing to be literature.&quot; Stead himself called his brand of journalism &#x27;Government by Journalism&#x27;.

===Early development, 1960s===

How and when the term New Journalism began to refer to a genre is not clear. Tom Wolfe, a practitioner and principal advocate of the form, wrote in at least two articles in 1972 that he had no idea of where it began. Trying to shed light on the matter, literary critic Seymour Krim offered his explanation in 1973.

I&#x27;m certain that [Pete] Hamill first used the expression. In about April of 1965 he called me at &quot;Nugget&quot; Magazine, where I was editorial director, and told me he wanted to write an article about new New Journalism. It was to be about the exciting things being done in the old reporting genre by Talese, Wolfe and Jimmy Breslin. He never wrote the piece, so far as I know, but I began using the expression in conversation and writing. It was picked up and stuck.

Despite the uncertainty of the term itself, there is evidence of literary experimentation in the early 1960s. Norman Mailer wrote his early political essay &quot;Superman Comes to the Supermarket&quot; about the 1960 nomination of John F. Kennedy. The piece established a precedent which Mailer would later build on in his 1968 convention coverage (&quot;Miami and the Siege of Chicago&quot;) and in other nonfiction as well.

Wolfe wrote that his first acquaintance with a new style of reporting came in a 1962 &quot;Esquire&quot; article about Joe Louis by Gay Talese. Joe Louis at Fifty&#x27; wasn&#x27;t like a magazine article at all. It was like a short story. It began with a scene, an intimate confrontation between Louis and his third wife...&quot; Wolfe said Talese was the first to apply fiction techniques to reporting. &quot;Esquire&quot; claimed credit as the seedbed for these new techniques. &quot;Esquire&quot; editor Harold Hayes later wrote that &quot;in the Sixties, events seemed to move too swiftly to allow the osmotic process of art to keep abreast, and when we found a good novelist we immediately sought to seduce him with the sweet mysteries of current events.&quot; Soon others, notably &quot;New York&quot;, followed &quot;Esquire&quot;″s lead, and the style eventually reached other magazines and then books.

Rarely mentioned, perhaps because they are somewhat less playfully countercultural in tone, as early and eminent exemplars of the new form are: Hannah Arendt&#x27;s &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot;, John Hersey&#x27;s &quot;Hiroshima&quot;, and Rachel Carson&#x27;s &quot;Silent Spring&quot;; articles which respectively introduced the Holocaust, nuclear war, and the existential threat of mass extinction into public consciousness for the first time for most of their contemporary readers.

===1970s===
Much of the criticism favorable to this New Journalism came from the writers themselves. Talese and Wolfe, in a panel discussion cited earlier, asserted that, although what they wrote may look like fiction, it was indeed reporting: &quot;Fact reporting, leg work&quot;, Talese called it.

Wolfe, in &quot;Esquire&quot; for December, 1972, hailed the replacement of the novel by the New Journalism as literature&#x27;s &quot;main event&quot; and detailed the points of similarity and contrast between the New Journalism and the novel. The four techniques of realism that he and the other New Journalists employed, he wrote, had been the sole province of novelists and other &quot;literati&quot;. They are scene-by-scene construction, full record of dialogue, third-person point of view and the manifold incidental details to round out character (i.e., descriptive incidentals). The result:

... is a form that is not merely like a &quot;novel&quot;. It consumes devices that happen to have originated with the novel and mixes them with every other device known to prose. And all the while, quite beyond matters of technique, it enjoys an advantage so obvious, so built-in, one almost forgets what power it has: the simple fact that the reader knows &quot;all this actually happened&quot;. The disclaimers have been erased. The screen is gone. The writer is one step closer to the absolute involvement of the reader that Henry James and James Joyce dreamed of but never achieved.

The essential difference between the new nonfiction and conventional reporting is, he said, that the basic unit of reporting was no longer the datum or piece of information but the scene. Scene is what underlies &quot;the sophisticated strategies of prose&quot;.

The first of the new breed of nonfiction writers to receive wide notoriety was Truman Capote, whose 1965 best-seller, &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, was a detailed narrative of the murder of a Kansas farm family. Capote culled material from some 6,000 pages of notes. The book brought its author instant celebrity. Capote announced that he had created a new art form which he labelled the &quot;nonfiction novel&quot;.

I&#x27;ve always had the theory that reportage is the great unexplored art form... I&#x27;ve had this theory that a factual piece of work could explore whole new dimensions in writing that would have a double effect fiction does not have—the very fact of its being true, every word of it&#x27;s true, would add a double contribution of strength and impact

Capote continued to stress that he was a literary artist, not a journalist, but critics hailed the book as a classic example of New Journalism.

Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby&quot;, whose introduction and title story, according to James E. Murphy, &quot;emerged as a manifesto of sorts for the nonfiction genre,&quot; was published the same year. In his introduction, Wolfe wrote that he encountered trouble fashioning an &quot;Esquire&quot; article out of material on a custom car extravaganza in Los Angeles, in 1963. Finding he could not do justice to the subject in magazine article format, he wrote a letter to his editor, Byron Dobell, which grew into a 49-page report detailing the custom car world, complete with scene construction, dialogue and flamboyant description. &quot;Esquire&quot; ran the letter, striking out &quot;Dear Byron.&quot; and it became Wolfe&#x27;s maiden effort as a New Journalist.

In an article entitled &quot;The Personal Voice and the Impersonal Eye&quot;, Dan Wakefield acclaimed the nonfiction of Capote and Wolfe as elevating reporting to the level of literature, terming that work and some of Norman Mailer&#x27;s nonfiction a journalistic breakthrough: reporting &quot;charged with the energy of art&quot;. A review by Jack Newfield of Dick Schaap&#x27;s &quot;Turned On&quot; saw the book as a good example of budding tradition in American journalism which rejected many of the constraints of conventional reporting:

This new genre defines itself by claiming many of the techniques that were once the unchallenged terrain of the novelist: tension, symbol, cadence, irony, prosody, imagination.

A 1968 review of Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Pump House Gang&quot; and &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; said Wolfe and Mailer were applying &quot;the imaginative resources of fiction&quot; to the world around them and termed such creative journalism &quot;hystory&quot; to connote their involvement in what they reported. Talese in 1970, in his Author&#x27;s Note to &quot;Fame and Obscurity&quot;, a collection of his pieces from the 1960s, wrote:

The new journalism, though often reading like fiction, is not fiction. It is, or should be, as reliable as the most reliable reportage although it seeks a larger truth than is possible through the mere compilation of verifiable facts, the use of direct quotations, and adherence to the rigid organizational style of the older form.

Seymour Krim&#x27;s &quot;Shake It for the World, Smartass&quot;, which appeared in 1970, contained &quot;An Open Letter to Norman Mailer&quot; which defined New Journalism as &quot;a free nonfictional prose that uses every resource of the best fiction.&quot; In &quot;The Newspaper As Literature/Literature As Leadership&quot;, he called journalism &quot;the &quot;de facto&quot; literature&quot; of the majority, a synthesis of journalism and literature that the book&#x27;s postscript called &quot;journalit&quot;. In 1972, in &quot;An Enemy of the Novel&quot;, Krim identified his own fictional roots and declared that the needs of the time compelled him to move beyond fiction to a more &quot;direct&quot; communication to which he promised to bring all of fiction&#x27;s resources.

David McHam, in an article titled &quot;The Authentic New Journalists&quot;, distinguished the nonfiction reportage of Capote, Wolfe and others from other, more generic interpretations of New Journalism. Also in 1971, William L. Rivers disparaged the former and embraced the latter, concluding, &quot;In some hands, they add a flavor and a humanity to journalistic writing that push it into the realm of art.&quot; Charles Brown in 1972 reviewed much that had been written as New Journalism and about New Journalism by Capote, Wolfe, Mailer and others and labelled the genre &quot;New Art Journalism&quot;, which allowed him to test it both as art and as journalism. He concluded that the new literary form was useful only in the hands of literary artists of great talent.

In the first of two pieces by Wolfe in &quot;New York&quot; detailing the growth of the new nonfiction and its techniques, Wolfe returned to the fortuitous circumstances surrounding the construction of &quot;Kandy-Kolored&quot; and added:

Its virtue was precisely in showing me the possibility of there being something &quot;new&quot; in journalism. What interested me was not simply the discovery that it was possible to write accurate nonfiction with techniques usually associated with novels and short stories. It was that—plus. It was the discovery that it was possible in nonfiction, in journalism, to use any literary device, from the traditional dialogisms of the essay to stream-of-consciousness...

===1980s===
In the eighties, the use of New Journalism saw a decline, several of the old trailblazers still used fiction techniques in their nonfiction books. However, younger writers in &quot;Esquire&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, where the style had flourished in the two earlier decades, shifted away from the New Journalism. Fiction techniques had not been abandoned by these writers, but they were used sparingly and less flamboyantly.

&quot;Whatever happened to the New Journalism?&quot; wondered Thomas Powers in a 1975 issue of &quot;Commonweal&quot;. In 1981, Joe Nocera published a postmortem in &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; blaming its demise on the journalistic liberties taken by Hunter S. Thompson. Regardless of the culprit, less than a decade after Wolfe&#x27;s 1973 New Journalism anthology, the consensus was that New Journalism was dead.

==Characteristics==
As a literary genre, New Journalism has certain technical characteristics. It is an artistic, creative, literary reporting form with three basic traits: dramatic literary techniques; intensive reporting; and reporting of generally acknowledged subjectivity.

===As subjective journalism===
Pervading many of the specific interpretations of New Journalism is a posture of subjectivity. Subjectivism is thus a common element among many (though not all) of its definitions. In contrast to a conventional journalistic striving for an objectivity, subjective journalism allows for the writer&#x27;s opinion, ideas or involvement to creep into the story.

Much of the critical literature concerns itself with a strain of subjectivism which may be called activism in news reporting. In 1970, Gerald Grant wrote disparagingly in &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; of a &quot;New Journalism of passion and advocacy&quot; and in the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; Hohenberg discussed &quot;The Journalist As Missionary&quot; For Masterson in 1971, &quot;The New Journalism&quot; provided a forum for discussion of journalistic and social activism. In another 1971 article under the same title, Ridgeway called the counterculture magazines such as &quot;The New Republic&quot; and &quot;Ramparts&quot; and the American underground press New Journalism.

Another version of subjectivism in reporting is what is sometimes called participatory reporting. Robert Stein, in &quot;Media Power&quot;, defines New Journalism as &quot;A form of participatory reporting that evolved in parallel with participatory politics...&quot;

===As form and technique===
The above interpretations of New Journalism view it as an attitude toward the practice of journalism. But a significant portion of the critical literature deals with form and technique. Critical comment dealing with New Journalism as a literary-journalistic genre (a distinct type of category of literary work grouped according to similar and technical characteristics) treats it as the &quot;new nonfiction&quot;. Its traits are extracted from the criticism written by those who claim to practice it and by others. Admittedly it is hard to isolate from a number of the more generic meanings.

The new nonfiction were sometimes taken for advocacy of subjective journalism. A 1972 article by Dennis Chase defines New Journalism as a subjective journalism emphasizing &quot;truth&quot; over &quot;facts&quot; but uses major nonfiction stylists as its example.

===As intensive reportage===
Although much of the critical literature discussed the use of literary or fictional techniques as the basis for a New Journalism, critics also referred to the form as stemming from intensive reporting. Stein, for instance, found the key to New Journalism not its fictionlike form but the &quot; reporting&quot; which precedes it, the result of the writer&#x27;s immersion in his subject. Consequently, Stein concluded, the writer is as much part of his story as is the subject and he thus linked saturation reporting with subjectivity. For him, New Journalism is inconsistent with objectivity or accuracy.

However, others have argued that total immersion enhances accuracy. As Wolfe put the case:

I am the first to agree that the New Journalism should be as accurate as traditional journalism. In fact my claims for the New Journalism, and my demands upon it, go far beyond that. I contend that it has already proven itself &quot;more&quot; accurate than traditional journalism—which unfortunately is saying but so much...

Wolfe coined &quot;saturation reporting&quot; in his &quot;Bulletin of the American Society of Newspaper Editors&quot; article. After citing the opening paragraphs of Talese&#x27;s Joe Louis piece, he confessed believing that Talese had &quot;piped&quot; or faked the story, only later to be convinced, after learning that Talese so deeply delved into the subject, that he could report entire scenes and dialogues.

The basic units of reporting are no longer who-what-when-where-how and why but whole scenes and stretches of dialogue. The New Journalism involves a depth of reporting and an attention to the most minute facts and details that most newspapermen, even the most experienced, have never dreamed of.

In his &quot;Birth of the New Journalism&quot; in &quot;New York&quot;, Wolfe returned to the subject, which he here described as a depth of information never before demanded in newspaper work. The New Journalist, he said, must stay with his subject for days and weeks at a stretch. In Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;Esquire&quot; piece, saturation became the &quot;Locker Room Genre&quot; of intensive digging into the lives and personalities of one&#x27;s subject, in contrast to the aloof and genteel tradition of the essayists and &quot;The Literary Gentlemen in the Grandstand&quot;.

For Talese, intensive reportage took the form of interior monologue to discover from his subjects what they were thinking, not, he said in a panel discussion reported in &quot;Writer&#x27;s Digest&quot;, merely reporting what people did and said.

Wolfe identified the four main devices New Journalists borrowed from literary fiction:
* Telling the story using scenes rather than historical narrative as much as possible
* Dialogue in full (conversational speech rather than quotations and statements)
* Point-of-view (present every scene through the eyes of a particular character)
* Recording everyday details such as behavior, possessions, friends and family (which indicate the &quot;status life&quot; of the character)

Despite these elements, New Journalism is not fiction. It maintains elements of reporting including strict adherence to factual accuracy and the writer being the primary source. To get &quot;inside the head&quot; of a character, the journalist asks the subject what they were thinking or how they felt.

==Writers and editors==
There is little consensus on which writers can be definitively categorized as New Journalists. In &quot;The New Journalism: A Critical Perspective&quot;, Murphy writes that New Journalism &quot;involves a more or less well defined group of writers,&quot; who are &quot;stylistically unique&quot; but share &quot;common formal elements&quot;. Among the most prominent New Journalists, Murphy lists: Jimmy Breslin, Truman Capote, Joan Didion, David Halberstam, Pete Hamill, Larry L. King, Norman Mailer, Joe McGinniss, Rex Reed, Mike Royko, John Sack, Dick Schaap, Terry Southern, Gail Sheehy, Gay Talese, Hunter S. Thompson, Dan Wakefield and Tom Wolfe. In &quot;The New Journalism&quot;, the editors E.W Johnson and Tom Wolfe, include George Plimpton for &quot;Paper Lion&quot;, &quot;Life&quot; writer James Mills and Robert Christgau, et cetera, in the corps. Christgau, however, stated in a 2001 interview that he does not see himself as a New Journalist.

The editors Clay Felker, Normand Poirier and Harold Hayes also contributed to the rise of New Journalism.

==Criticism==
While many praised the New Journalist&#x27;s style of writing, Wolfe et al., also received severe criticism from contemporary journalists and writers. Essentially two different charges were leveled against New Journalism: criticism against it as a &quot;distinct genre&quot; and criticism against it as a &quot;new&quot; form.

Robert Stein believed that &quot;In the New Journalism the eye of the beholder is all—or almost all,&quot; and in 1971 Philip M. Howard, wrote that the new nonfiction writers rejected objectivity in favor of a more personal, subjective reportage. This parallels much of what Wakefield said in his 1966 &quot;Atlantic&quot; article.

The important and interesting and hopeful trend to me in the new journalism is its personal nature—not in the sense of personal attacks, but in the presence of the reporter himself and the significance of his own involvement. This is sometimes felt to be egotistical, and the frank identification of the author, especially as the &quot;I&quot; instead of merely the impersonal &quot;eye&quot; is often frowned upon and taken as proof of &quot;subjectivity&quot;, which is the opposite of the usual journalistic pretense.

And in spite of the fact that Capote believed in the objective accuracy of &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; and strove to keep himself totally out of the narrative, one reviewer found in the book the &quot;tendency among writers to resort to subjective sociology, on the other hand, or to super-creative reportage, on the other.&quot; Charles Self termed this characteristic of New Journalism as &quot;admitted&quot; subjectivity, whether first-person or third-person, and acknowledged the subjectivity inherent in his account.

Lester Markel polemically criticized New Journalism in the &quot;Bulletin of the American Society of Newspaper Editors&quot;, he rejected the claim to greater in-depth reporting and labelled the writers &quot;factual fictionists&quot; and &quot;deep-see reporters&quot;. He feared they were performing as sociologists and psychoanalysts rather than as journalists. The lack of source footnotes and bibliographies in most works of New Journalism is often cited by critics as showing a lack of intellectual rigor, verifiability, and even author laziness and sloppiness.

More reasoned, though still essentially negative, Arlen in his 1972 &quot;Notes on the New Journalism&quot;, put the New Journalism into a larger socio-historical perspective by tracing the techniques from earlier writers and from the constraints and opportunities of the current age. But much of the more routine New Journalism &quot;consists in exercises by writer ... in gripping and controlling and confronting a subject within the journalist&#x27;s own temperament. Presumably,&quot; he wrote, &quot;this is the &#x27;novelistic technique. However, he conceded that the best of this work had &quot;considerably expanded the possibilities of journalism&quot;.

Much negative criticism of New Journalism were directed at individual writers. For example, Cynthia Ozick asserted in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, that Capote in &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; was doing little more than trying to devise a form: &quot;One more esthetic manipulation.&quot; Sheed offered, in &quot;A Fun-House Mirror&quot;, a witty refutation of Wolfe&#x27;s claim that he takes on the expression and the guise of whomever he is writing about. &quot;The Truman Capotes may hold up a tolerably clear glass to nature,&quot; he wrote, &quot;but Wolfe holds up a fun-house mirror, and I for one don&#x27;t give a hoot whether he calls the reflection fact or fiction.&quot;

===&quot;Parajournalism&quot; and the &quot;New Yorker&quot; affair===
Among the hostile critics of the New Journalism were Dwight Macdonald, whose most vocal criticism comprised a chapter in what became known as &quot;the &quot;New Yorker&quot; affair&quot; of 1965. Wolfe had written a two-part semi-fictional parody in &quot;New York&quot; of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and its editor, William Shawn. Reaction, notably from &quot;New Yorker&quot; writers, was loud and prolonged, but the most significant reaction came from Macdonald, who counterattacked in two articles in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. In the first, Macdonald termed Wolfe&#x27;s approach &quot;parajournalism&quot; and applied it to all similar styles. &quot;Parajournalism&quot;, Macdonald wrote,

... seems to be journalism—&quot;the collection and dissemination of current news&quot;—but the appearance is deceptive. It is a bastard form, having it both ways, exploiting the factual authority of journalism and the atmospheric license of fiction.

The &quot;New Yorker&quot; parody, he added, &quot;... revealed the ugly side of Parajournalism when it tries to be serious.&quot;

In his second article, MacDonald addressed himself to the accuracy of Wolfe&#x27;s report. He charged that Wolfe &quot;takes a middle course, shifting gears between fact and fantasy, spoof and reportage, until nobody knows which end is, at the moment, up&quot;. &quot;New Yorker&quot; writers Renata Adler and Gerald Jonas joined the fray in the Winter 1966 issue of &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;.

Wolfe himself returned to the affair a full seven years later, devoting the second of his two February &quot;New York&quot; articles (1972) to his detractors but not to dispute their attack on his factual accuracy. He argued that most of the contentions arose because for traditional &quot;literati&quot; nonfiction should not succeed—which his nonfiction obviously had.

===Gail Sheehy and &quot;Redpants&quot;===
In &quot;The New Journalism: A Critical Perspective&quot;, Murphy writes, &quot;Partly because Wolfe took liberties with the facts in his &quot;New Yorker&quot; parody, New Journalism began to get a reputation for juggling the facts in the search for truth, fictionalizing some details to get a larger &#x27;reality. Widely criticized was the technique of the composite character, the most notorious example of which was &quot;Redpants&quot;, a presumed prostitute whom Gail Sheehy wrote about in &quot;New York&quot; in a series on that city&#x27;s sexual subculture. When it later became known that the character was distilled from a number of prostitutes, there was an outcry against Sheehy&#x27;s method and, by extension, to the credibility of all of New Journalism. In the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, one critic wrote:

It&#x27;s all part of the New Journalism, or the Now Journalism, and it&#x27;s practiced widely these days. Some editors and reporters vigorously defend it. Others just as vigorously attack it. No one has polled the reader, but whether he approves or disapproves, it&#x27;s getting harder and harder for him to know what he can believe.

&quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that critics felt Sheehy&#x27;s energies were better suited to fiction than fact. John Tebbel, in an article in &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, although treating New Journalism in its more generic sense as new a trend, chided it for the fictional technique of narrative leads which the new nonfiction writers had introduced into journalism and deplored its use in newspapers.

===Criticism against New Journalism as a distinct genre===
Newfield, in 1972, changed his attitude following his earlier, 1967, review of Wolfe. &quot;New Journalism does not exist&quot;, the later article titled &quot;Is there a &#x27;new journalism&#x27;?&quot; says. &quot;It is a false category. There is only good writing and bad writing, smart ideas and dumb ideas, hard work and laziness.&quot; While the practice of journalism had improved during the past fifteen years, he argued, it was because of an influx of good writers notable for unique styles, not because they belonged to any school or movement.

Jimmy Breslin, who is often labelled a New Journalist, took the same view: &quot;Believe me, there is no new journalism. It is a gimmick to say there is ... Story telling is older than the alphabet and that is what it is all about.&quot;

=== Explanatory notes ===

 The article Wolfe referred to was actually titled &quot;Joe Louis—the King as a Middle-Aged Man&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, June, 1962.
 Wolfe&#x27;s letter had the original title &quot;There Goes (Varoom! Varoom!) That Kandy-Kolored (Thphhhhhh!) Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby (Rahghhh!) Around the Bend (Brummmmmmmmmmmmmmm)...&quot;. The title was later contracted to &quot;The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby&quot;, which became the title of the book, published in 1965.
 For example, J.D. Salinger wrote to Jock Whitney &quot;With the printing of the inaccurate and sub-collegiate and gleeful and unrelievedly poisonous article on William Shawn, the name of the Herald Tribune, and certainly your own will very likely never again stand for anything either respect-worthy or honorable.&quot; E. B. White&#x27;s letter to Whitney, dated &quot;April 1965,&quot; contains the following passage: &quot;Tom Wolfe&#x27;s piece on William Shawn violated every rule of conduct I know anything about. It is sly, cruel, and to a large extent undocumented, and it has, I think, shocked everyone who knows what sort of person Shawn really is[...],&quot; and Shawn&#x27;s hand-delivered letter to Whitney, sent Thursday before publication on April 11, 1965, read &quot;To be technical for a moment, I think that Tom Wolfe&#x27;s article on The New Yorker is false and libelous. But I&#x27;d rather not be technical ... I cannot believe that, as a man of known integrity and responsibility, you will allow it to reach your readers ... The question is whether you will stop the distribution of that issue of New York. I urge you to do so, for the sake of The New Yorker and for the sake of the Herald Tribune. In fact, I am convinced that the publication of that article will hurt you more than it will hurt me ...&quot;. Bellows 2002, pp. 3–4.

<doc id="739681" wikidata="Q587628" url="?curid=739681" title="Vernon Reid">
<text>Vernon Alphonsus Reid (born 22 August 1958) is a British-born American guitarist and songwriter best known as the founder of the rock band Living Colour. Reid was named No. 66 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2003 list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time, and in August 2023, was ranked #42 in Rolling Stone Magazine top 250 Greatest Guitarists of all time. Critic Steve Huey writes, &quot;[Reid&#x27;s] rampant eclecticism encompasses everything from heavy metal and punk to funk, R&amp;B and avant-garde jazz, and his anarchic, lightning-fast solos have become something of a hallmark as well.&quot;

==Early life==

Born in London, England, to West Indian parents, Reid was raised in New York City. He attended Brooklyn Technical High School, then New York University.

==Career==
===Early career===
He first came to prominence in the 1980s in Ronald Shannon Jackson&#x27;s avant-jazz-rock band The Decoding Society, and is on six studio and three live albums recorded with that group from 1980-1986. &quot;Smash &amp; Scatteration&quot; was a duo record with guitarist Bill Frisell recorded in 1984. In 1985, Reid co-founded the Black Rock Coalition with journalist Greg Tate and producer Konda Mason.

===Living Colour===

Reid formed Living Colour in New York City in 1984, and its lineup was solidified in 1986. Their debut album &quot;Vivid&quot; was released in 1988 and sold double Platinum. Its successor &quot;Time&#x27;s Up&quot; was released 1990 and was gold-certified. They received two consecutive Grammy Awards in the category of Best Hard Rock Performance. They opened for the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1989 &quot;Steel Wheels&quot; tour; and appeared on the first Lollapalooza tour in the summer of 1991.

Living Colour broke up in 1995 but reformed in 2000. Since then, they have released three more albums: &quot;Collideøscope&quot; in October 2003 on Sanctuary Records, &quot;The Chair in the Doorway&quot; in September 2009, and &quot;Shade&quot; in September 2017 on Megaforce Records.

===Solo career===
In addition to his work with Living Colour, Reid has been engaged in a number of other projects. He released &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot;, his first solo album, in 1996, and has collaborated with the choreographers Bill T. Jones on &quot;Still/Here&quot; and Donald Byrd on &quot;Jazztrain&quot;. He performed &quot;Party &#x27;Til The End of Time&quot; at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) with The Roots, an end of the 2000 millennium tribute featuring the music of Prince&#x27;s album &quot;1999&quot;. He also composed and performed &quot;Bring Your Beats&quot; a children&#x27;s program for BAM.

Reid has also undertaken significant work as a record producer, including two Grammy-nominated albums: &quot;Papa&quot; (1999) by the African vocalist Salif Keita and &quot;Memphis Blood: The Sun Sessions&quot; (2001) by guitarist James Blood Ulmer. Ulmer&#x27;s subsequent albums, &quot;No Escape from the Blues: The Electric Lady Sessions&quot; (2003), &quot;Birthright&quot; (2005), and &quot;Bad Blood in the City: The Piety Street Sessions&quot; (2007), were also produced by Reid.

Reid also appears on &quot;Guitar Oblique&quot; (Knitting Factory) with guitarists David Torn and Elliott Sharp. Reid was also featured in the program presented by BAM and the Experience Music Project in Seattle entitled &quot;Magic Science&quot;, which includes Medeski Martin &amp; Wood and the Gil Evans Orchestra performing Gil Evans&#x27; arrangements of songs by Jimi Hendrix.

Reid composed the score for the film &quot;Paid in Full&quot;, directed by Charles Stone III (well known for creating the &quot;Wasssup!&quot; series of commercials for Budweiser as well as directing three videos for Living Colour) and released by Miramax in the fall of 2002. Reid also composed the score for the celebrated documentary &quot;Ghosts of Attica&quot; (directed by Brad Lichtenstein), which aired on Court TV in the fall of 2001 and has been featured at several film festivals. He composed the score for another documentary directed by Lichtenstein, &quot;Almost Home&quot;, which aired in 2006 on the PBS series &quot;Independent Lens.&quot;

Reid and DJ Logic, calling themselves &quot;Yohimbe Brothers&quot;, released an album in September 2002 entitled &quot;Front End Lifter&quot;. The Yohimbe Brothers have been touring on and off since the release of the album. Reid was also the music supervisor for the film &quot;Mr. 3000&quot;, starring Bernie Mac and directed by Charles Stone III; the film was released in September 2004. Vernon&#x27;s album with Masque (Leon Gruenbaum – keyboards and Samchillian, Hank Schroy – bass and Marlon Browden – drums), an instrumental album entitled &quot;Known Unknown&quot;, was released in April 2004, and on 18 April 2006 Vernon Reid and Masque released &quot;Other True Self&quot;, both on Favored Nations records, owned by another guitarist, Steve Vai.

Reid has a prolific session output in a variety of contexts. He has played live or on record with The Roots, Eye &amp; I, Mick Jagger, Ambitious Lovers, Rollins Band, Spearhead, Public Enemy, Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey, Colonial Cousins, Tracy Chapman, Ronald Shannon Jackson, Don Byron, Defunkt, Santana, Bernie Worrell, MC 900 Ft. Jesus, B.B. King, Madeleine Peyroux, Meridiem, Jack Bruce, Terry Bozzio, Black Sugar Transmission (Reid solos on the title track of 2009&#x27;s &quot;USE IT&quot; EP) and DJ Spooky.

Reid played at America&#x27;s Millennium Gala, New Year&#x27;s Eve 31 December 1999, and 1 January 2000, at the Lincoln Memorial, performing &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; with John Fogerty. Among those in the audience were President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton.

In March 2007, Reid played with Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and G. Calvin Weston at Tonic in New York and Tritone in Philadelphia, which led them to record as Free Form Funky Freqs. Their debut recording, &quot;Urban Mythology Volume One&quot;, was released in 2008.

In July 2008, Vernon Reid assembled a one-off solo band for his appearance at the G-TARanaki Guitar Festival in Taranaki, New Zealand, with keyboard player Jonathan Crayford, bassist Crete Haami and drummer Magesh Magesh. At the Puke Ariki &quot;Midnight Session&quot; concert, Vernon performed an all-star jam with Uli Jon Roth, Gilby Clarke and Alex Skolnick.

In 2008, Reid also played a series of Blue Note Club tribute concerts to the Tony Williams Lifetime in Japan with Jack Bruce, Cindy Blackman and John Medeski. In June 2012 the collaboration released a self-titled album &quot;Spectrum Road&quot; on the US jazz record label Palmetto. This was accompanied by a series of dates at large jazz festivals in North America and Europe throughout June and July.

In 2018, Reid signed with Mascot Label Group. He has an album slated for release in 2019.

In 2023, Reid wrote an article titled &quot;The Promise And Peril Of AI Music: What Have We Unleashed?&quot; that was published by Media Post.

===An Underground Railroad of the Mind===
In 2017, Reid debuted his semi-monthly broadcast on the streaming radio station Home. His show, titled &quot;An Underground Railroad of the Mind&quot;, features Reid playing vinyl records from his record collection.

==Personal life==
Reid resides in Staten Island with his wife Gabri Christa, a choreographer and filmmaker, and their daughter born in 2003.

==Influences==
Reid has cited Miles Davis, James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, Robert Fripp, John Coltrane, Frank Zappa, Jeff Beck, Carlos Santana, Eddie Hazel, John McLaughlin, Jimmy Page, Eddie Van Halen, and Dr. Know among his influences.

== Equipment ==

During the early years of Living Colour, Reid used a multi-colored ESP Mirage with EMG pickups, and he was an endorser of the A/DA MP-1 preamp. During the mid-1980s, Reid commissioned a highly figured maple custom guitar from Vancouver-based luthier Martini Guitars. This guitar was later acquired by Bob Wiseman, a founding member of the band Blue Rodeo. In later years, Reid has used custom Hamer guitars, and started a relationship with Parker Guitars, who built the &quot;DF824VR&quot; Vernon Reid signature model based on their &quot;Dragonfly&quot; design. it has EMG-X pickups in a H SS layout with 5-way switching system, a Floyd Rose vibrato (a first for Parker), and a Roland GK divided pickup.
In 2016, he switched to PRS and was working on a signature model with them. The result is the PRS S2 VR Vela.
ESP Released the 86-run limited edition Cult &#x27;86 based on the original used on &quot;Cult of Personality.&quot;

<text>Toxicodendron diversilobum (syn. &quot;Rhus diversiloba&quot;), commonly named Pacific poison oak or western poison oak, is a woody vine or shrub in the sumac family, Anacardiaceae. 

It is widely distributed in western North America, inhabiting conifer and mixed broadleaf forests, woodlands, grasslands, and chaparral biomes. Peak flowering occurs in May. Like other members of the genus &quot;Toxicodendron&quot;, &quot;T. diversilobum&quot; causes itching and allergic rashes in most people after contact by touch or smoke inhalation. Despite its name, it is not closely related to oaks, nor is it a true tree.

==Description==
&quot;Toxicodendron diversilobum&quot; is extremely variable in growth habit and leaf appearance. It grows as a dense tall shrub in open sunlight, a treelike vine and may be more than long with an trunk, as dense thickets in shaded areas, or any form in between. It reproduces by spreading rhizomes and by seeds.
The plant is winter deciduous, so that after cold weather sets in, the stems are leafless and bear only the occasional cluster of mature fruit. Without leaves the stems may sometimes be identified by occasional black marks where its milky sap may have oozed and dried.

The leaves are divided into three (rarely 5, 7, or 9) leaflets, long, with scalloped, toothed, or lobed edges. They generally resemble the lobed leaves of a true oak, though tend to be more glossy. Leaves are typically bronze when first unfolding in February to March, bright green in the spring, yellow-green to reddish in the summer, and bright red or pink from late July to October.

White flowers form in the spring, from March to June. If they are fertilized, they develop into greenish-white or tan drupes.

Botanist John Howell observed that the plant&#x27;s toxicity obscures its aesthetic values: 
::In spring, the ivory flowers bloom on the sunny hill or in sheltered glade, in summer its fine green leaves contrast refreshingly with dried and tawny grassland, in autumn its colors flame more brilliantly than in any other native, but one great fault, its poisonous juice, nullifies its every other virtue and renders this beautiful shrub the most disparaged of all within our region.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Toxicodendron diversilobum&quot; is found in California (Los Angeles was built on the site of a village named Yaangna or &quot;iyáanga’&quot;, meaning &quot;poison oak place&quot;), the Baja California Peninsula, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. The related &quot;T. pubescens&quot; (eastern poison oak) is native to the Southeastern United States. &quot;T. diversilobum&quot; and &quot;T. rydbergii&quot; (western poison ivy) hybridize in the Columbia River Gorge area.

&quot;Toxicodendron diversilobum&quot; is common in various habitats, from mesic riparian zones to xeric chaparral. It thrives in shady and dappled light through full and direct sunlight conditions, at elevations below . The vining form can climb up large shrub and tree trunks into their canopies. Sometimes it kills the support plant by smothering or breaking it. The plant often occurs in chaparral and woodlands, coastal sage scrub, grasslands, and oak woodlands; and Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menzesii&quot;), hemlock–Sitka spruce, &quot;Sequoia sempervirens &quot;(coast redwood), &quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; (Ponderosa pine), and mixed evergreen forests.

== Ecology ==
Black-tailed deer, mule deer, California ground squirrels, western gray squirrels, and other indigenous fauna feed on the leaves of the plant. It is rich in phosphorus, calcium, and sulfur. Bird species use the berries for food, and utilize the plant structure for shelter. Neither native animals nor horses, livestock, or dogs demonstrate reactions to urushiol.

Due to human allergic reactions, &quot;T. diversilobum &quot;is usually eradicated from gardens and public landscaped areas. It can be a weed in agricultural fields, orchards, and vineyards. It is usually removed by pruning, herbicides, digging out, or a combination. Poison oak is susceptible to infection by &quot;Phytophthora ramorum&quot;.

== Toxicity ==
&quot;Toxicodendron diversilobum&quot; leaves and twigs have a surface oil, urushiol, which causes an allergic reaction. It causes contact dermatitis – an immune-mediated skin inflammation – in four-fifths of humans. Most, if not all, will become sensitized over time with repeated or more concentrated exposure to urushiol.

The active components of urushiol have been determined to be unsaturated congeners of 3-heptadecylcatechol with up to three double bonds in an unbranched C17 side chain. In poison ivy, these components are unique in that they contain a -CH2CH2- group in an unbranched alkyl side chain.

=== Exposure ===
&quot;Toxicodendron diversilobum&quot; skin contact first causes itching; then evolves into dermatitis with inflammation, colorless bumps, severe itching, and blistering. In the dormant deciduous seasons the plant can be difficult to recognize, however contact with leafless branches and twigs also causes allergic reactions.

Urushiol volatilizes when burned, and human exposure to &quot;T. diversilobum&quot; smoke is extremely hazardous, from wildfires, controlled burns, or disposal fires. The smoke can poison people who thought they were immune. Branches used to toast food over campfires can cause reactions internally and externally.

Urushiol is also found in the skin of mangos, posing a danger to people sensitized to &quot;T. diversilobum&quot; when eating the fruit while it is still in the rind.

==Uses==

===Medicinal===
Californian Native Americans used the plant&#x27;s stems and shoots to make baskets, the sap to cure ringworm, and as a poultice of fresh leaves applied to rattlesnake bites. The juice or soot was used as a black dye for sedge basket elements, tattoos, and skin darkening.

An infusion of dried roots, or buds eaten in the spring, were taken by some native peoples for an immunity from the plant poisons.

Chumash peoples used &quot;T. diversilobum&quot; sap to remove warts, corns, and calluses; to cauterize sores; and to stop bleeding. They drank a decoction made from the roots to treat dysentery.

===Cultivation===
&quot;Toxicodendron diversilobum&quot; can be a carefully situated component in wildlife gardens, habitat gardens, and natural landscaping.

The plant is used in habitat restoration projects. It can be early stage succession where woodlands have been burned or removed, serving as a nurse plant for other species.

<doc id="739686" wikidata="Q284560" url="?curid=739686" title="Manuel Puig">
<text>Juan Manuel Puig Delledonne (December 28, 1932 – July 22, 1990), commonly called Manuel Puig, was an Argentine author. Among his best-known novels are &quot;La traición de Rita Hayworth&quot; (&quot;Betrayed by Rita Hayworth&quot;, 1968), &quot;Boquitas pintadas&quot; (&quot;Heartbreak Tango&quot;, 1969), and &quot;El beso de la mujer araña&quot; (&quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot;, 1976) which was adapted into the film released in 1985, directed by the Argentine-Brazilian director Héctor Babenco; and a Broadway musical in 1993.

==Early life, education and early career==
Puig was born in General Villegas, Buenos Aires Province. Since there was no high school in General Villegas, his parents sent him to Buenos Aires in 1946. Puig attended Colegio Ward in Villa Sarmiento (Morón County). This is when he began to read systematically, beginning with a collection of texts by Nobel Prize winners. A classmate named Horacio, in whose home Puig rented accommodation when he first moved to Buenos Aires City introduced him to readings from the school of psychoanalysis. The first novel that he read was &quot;The Pastoral Symphony&quot; by André Gide; he also read Hermann Hesse, Aldous Huxley, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Thomas Mann.

Horacio also introduced Puig to European cinema. After seeing &quot;Quai des Orfèvres&quot; (1947), he decided that he wanted to be a film director. To prepare for his chosen career, he learned Italian, French, and German, which were considered &quot;the new languages of cinema&quot;. He was advised to study engineering in order to specialize in sound-on-film but did not consider this to be the right choice. In 1950, he enrolled in the University of Buenos Aires Faculty of Architecture but only took classes for six months. In 1951, Puig switched to the School of Philosophy. He was a diligent student, although he struggled with subjects such as Latin. When he graduated, he was already working in film as an archivist and editor in Buenos Aires and later, in Italy after winning a scholarship from the Italian Institute of Buenos Aires. However, the world of Hollywood and the stars that had captivated him during his childhood now disappointed him; the exceptions were Marilyn Monroe and Gloria Swanson.

A note in the magazine &quot;Radiolandia&quot; about the upcoming premiere of the film Deshonra prompted Puig to try and meet its director Daniel Tinayre, whose comedy &quot;La vendedora de fantasías&quot; he admired. Since the director denied him access to the set, he spoke to the actress Fanny Navarro, who played the main role, without Tinayre&#x27;s permission. He felt no sympathy for her since she supported Juan Domingo Perón, who had prohibited the importation of American films into Argentina. Navarro sent him to another actress of the cast, Herminia Franco, who got him in. Shortly after, he began to work in Alex laboratories.

In 1953, Puig did his obligatory military service in the area of Aeronautics, working as a translator.

==Writing career==
In the 1960s, Manuel Puig moved back to Buenos Aires, where he penned his first major novel, &quot;La traición de Rita Hayworth&quot;. Because he had leftist political tendencies and also foresaw a rightist wave in Argentina, Puig moved to Mexico in 1973, where he wrote his later works (including &quot;El beso de la mujer araña&quot;).

Much of Puig&#x27;s work can be seen as pop art. Perhaps due to his work in film and television, Puig managed to create a writing style that incorporated elements of these mediums, such as montage and the use of multiple points of view. He also made much use of popular culture (for example, soap opera) in his works. In Latin American literary histories, he is presented as a writer who belongs to the Postboom and Post-modernist schools.

== Death ==

Puig lived in exile throughout most of his life. In 1989, Puig moved from Mexico City to Cuernavaca, Mexico, where he died in 1990. In the previous months, he had stopped smoking on his doctor&#x27;s orders and took daily walks but did not feel well at the altitude of Mexico. He also made sure to receive his care in a clinic near his house so he would not be far away from his mother, but for economic reasons and availability of contacts, he had access to higher quality medical attention. In the official biography, &quot;Manuel Puig and the Spider Woman: His Life and Fiction&quot;, his close friend Suzanne Jill Levine writes that Puig had been in pain for a few days prior to being admitted to a hospital, where he was told what needed to be done.

On Saturday July 21, 1990, he was checked into Las Palmas Surgical Center for risk of peritonitis. An emergency procedure was performed on his inflamed gallbladder, which was removed. While Puig was recovering after the surgery, he began to have respiratory problems; his lungs had filled with fluid, and he was becoming delirious. The medical team was unable to help Puig and they had to secure him to the bed. He died from acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) at 4:55 a.m. on July 22, 1990.

His death leaked quickly through the media. Although he had a background of cardiac problems, the first public assumption was that he had died from AIDS. It was soon ascertained that Manuel Puig did not have HIV. Nevertheless, the public had already contested that fact several times.

Only six people attended his funeral service, including his mother, his friends Javier Labrada and Agustín Garcia Gil, and his colleague Tununa Mercado who happened to be on her way to Xalapa city in Veracruz.

When Jorge Abelardo Ramos, the Argentine ambassador of Mexico was asked to speak to the media about the death of Manuel Puig, he responded by saying that he was not aware of the death of an Argentine with that name. Regardless, they had his body sent to the Federal District of Mexico for his funeral rites with the Writer&#x27;s Society, and the ambassador arrived and gave a speech.

Manuel Puig&#x27;s bodily remains were sent to Argentina a few days later and were placed in the Puig family tomb in the cemetery of La Plata.

The 2004 film Vereda Tropical (film), directed by Javier Torres, depicts the period during which Puig lived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The writer&#x27;s role is played by the actor Fabio Aste.

==Work==
Critics such as Pamela Bacarisse divide Puig&#x27;s work into two groups: his early novels, which &quot;attracted an enormous audience by weaving into his narratives the artistic &#x27;sub-products&#x27; of mass culture&quot;; and his later books, which have &quot;lost their popular appeal&quot; as they evidence &quot;a depressing, even unpalatable, vision of life, no longer even superficially sweetened by palliatives as the mass-media elements are left behind&quot;.

Three translations of his work have been reprinted by Dalkey Archive Press:

<doc id="739695" wikidata="Q1432674" url="?curid=739695" title="Magnesia on the Maeander">
<text>Magnesia or Magnesia on the Maeander ( or ; ) was an ancient Greek city in Ionia, considerable in size, at an important location commercially and strategically in the triangle of Priene, Ephesus and Tralles. The city was named Magnesia, after the Magnetes from Thessaly who settled the area along with some Cretans. It was later called &quot;on the Meander&quot; to distinguish it from the nearby Lydian city Magnesia ad Sipylum. It was earlier the site of Leucophrys mentioned by several ancient writers.

The territory around Magnesia was extremely fertile, and produced excellent wine, figs, and cucumbers. It was built on the slope of Mount Thorax, on the banks of the small river Lethacus, a tributary of the Maeander river upstream from Ephesus. It was 15 miles from the city of Miletus. The ruins of the city are located west of the modern village Tekin in the Germencik district of Aydın Province, Turkey.

Magnesia lay within Ionia, but because it had been settled by Aeolians from Greece, was not accepted into the Ionian League. Magnesia may have been ruled for a time by the Lydians, and was for some time under the control of the Persians and subject to Cimmerian raids. In later years, Magnesia supported the Romans during the Second Mithridatic War.

== General history ==

Magnesia soon attained great power and prosperity, so as to be able to cope even with a challenge from Ephesus. However, the city was taken and destroyed by the Cimmerians sometime between 726 BC and 660 BC. The deserted site was soon reoccupied, and rebuilt by the Milesians or, according to Athenaeus, by the Ephesians. The Persian satraps of Lydia also occasionally resided in the place.

In the fifth century BC, the exiled Athenian Themistocles came to Persia to offer his services to Artaxerxes, and was given control of Magnesia to support his family.

The word &quot;magnet&quot; possibly derives from lodestones found around Magnesia ad Sipylum, a neighbouring city with a similar name.

In the time of the Romans, Magnesia was added to the kingdom of Pergamon, after Antiochus had been driven eastward beyond Mount Taurus. After this time the town seems to have declined and is rarely mentioned, though it is still noticed by Pliny and Tacitus. Hierocles ranks it among the bishoprics of the province of Asia, and later documents seem to imply that at one time it bore the name of Maeandropolis. The existence of the town in the time of the emperors Aurelius and Gallienus is attested to by coins.

=== Leucophryna ===
A great quadrennial festival called the Leucophryna (Λευκόφρυνα) was held in the city and people from all over the Greek world gathered there.

=== Landmarks ===

Magnesia contained a temple of Dindymene, the mother of the gods; the wife or daughter of Themistocles was said to have been a priestess of that divinity.

Strabo later noted the temple no longer existed, the town having been transferred to another place. The change in the site of the town alluded to by Strabo, is not noticed by other contemporary authors, however some suggest that Magnesia was moved from the banks of the Meander to a place at the foot of Mount Thorax three miles from the river.

The new town which Strabo saw was remarkable for its temple of Artemis Leucophryene (), which in size and the number of its treasures was surpassed by the temple of Ephesus, but in beauty and the harmony of its parts was superior to all the temples in Asia Minor: 
:&quot;The first city one comes to after Ephesos is Magnesia, which is an Aiolian city . . . In the present city is the temple of Artemis Leukophryene, which in the size of its shrine and in the number of its votive offerings is inferior to the temple at Ephesos, but in the harmony and skill shown in the structure of the sacred enclosure is far superior to it. And in size it surpasses all the sacred enclosures in Asia except two, that [of Artemis] at Ephesos and that [of Apollon] at Didymoi.&quot;
The temple to Artemis is said by Vitruvius to have been built by the architect Hermogenes, in the Ionic style. Following a theophany of the goddess Artemis in the 3rd century B.C., the temple and the city were recognised as a place of asylia by other Greek states.

The temples of the city would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire and little remains of either temple today. The site of Magnesia on the Maeander was once identified with the modern Güzelhisar; since then the ruins of a temple to Artemis were found at Inck-bazar, and the latter is considered a more likely site.

A further important monument in Magnesia was the stadium in the south-western part of the city with a length of 185,90 meters.

== Modern excavations ==
The first excavations at the archaeological site were performed during 1891 and 1893 by a German archaeological team conducted by Carl Humann, discoverer of the Pergamon Altar. These lasted 21 months and partially revealed the theatre, the Artemis temple, the agora, the Zeus temple and the prytaneion. Excavations were resumed at the site, after an interval of almost 100 years, in 1984, by Orhan Bingöl of the University of Ankara and the Turkish Ministry of Culture.

Findings from the site are now displayed in Istanbul and Aydın, as well as in Berlin and Paris. Copies of the portico (pronaos) of the Zeus temple and of a bay of the Artemis temple can be visited in the Pergamonmuseum in Berlin. Much of the architectural remains of Magnesia were destroyed long ago by local lime burners. The well preserved remains of the Zeus temple have been destroyed by local residents even after Humann&#x27;s excavation campaign.

In July 2018, six Greek statues were discovered. Four female, one male and one with unknown gender were unearthed in the ruins of a temple of Artemis.

<text>Tractor Supply Company (also known as TSCO or TSC), founded in 1938, is an American chain store that sells home improvement, agriculture, lawn and garden maintenance, livestock, equine and pet care equipment and supplies. It caters to farmers, ranchers, pet owners, and landowners. As of 2024, the company had 2,250 stores. It is based in Brentwood, Tennessee. It is publicly traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol TSCO and is a &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 company.


==History==
In 1938, Charles Schmidt founded Tractor Supply Company in Chicago as a mail-order business that sold tractors. The first retail store was founded in 1939 in Minot, North Dakota. From 1941 to 1946, the company opened stores in Nebraska, Minnesota and Iowa.

On January 14, 1959, Tractor Supply became publicly traded on the over-the-counter market and reached $10 million in sales. The company was later traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

In 1967, TSC opened its first international stores in Canada. Two years later, Schmidt sold his controlling interest in the company to National Industries. This and other factors, such as changing executive leadership and adding inventory that strayed from its traditional categories, led to a few years of losses for the company.

From that point onward, the Canadian stores were now completely separate from the US Tractor Supply Company and were 100% Canadian-owned. The licensing agreement allowed them to keep using TSC, but not &quot;Tractor Supply Company.&quot;

In 1979, the company moved to Nashville, Tennessee. 

In 1982, Tractor Supply put ownership of the company back in the hands of executives and returned to their farm-store niche, resulting in a break-even year. The company was re-incorporated in Delaware the same year.

On February 17, 1994, the company&#x27;s stock was listed on the Nasdaq under the symbol TSCO.

Tractor Supply expanded to serve hobbyist farmers, such as families living in the suburbs with an interest in gardening and livestock. In 2002, the company earned $1.21 billion.

Two years later in 2004, the company reported revenues of more than $1.7 billion and &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine named Tractor Supply to its list of the 100 fastest growing businesses. That year, Tractor Supply moved its headquarters to Brentwood, Tennessee. Jim Wright served as the CEO from 2004 to 2013. He was replaced by Gregory Sandfort.

In 2014, Tractor Supply made it on the Fortune 500 list. On March 31, 2018, the company opened its 1700th store. On September 4, 2018, the company celebrated its 80th anniversary by ringing the closing bell at the NASDAQ Stock Exchange in New York.

TSC&#x27;s 1,900th store opened in September 2020. By December, the company had 1,923 stores in 49 states. By October 2021, there were 1,967 stores in 49 states. Hal Lawton became CEO in 2020. That year, the company received a Great Place to Work certification.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tractor Supply was deemed an essential business and remained open. The company saw revenue grow 27 percent as more people turned to gardening and pet and livestock ownership. That year, it also established the Tractor Supply Company Foundation.

In 2021, Tractor Supply reached #291 on the &quot;Fortune 500&quot; list and had over 20 million members in its loyalty program, Neighbor&#x27;s Club. TSC is the largest retail ranch and farm store operator in the U.S.

On Oct 11, 2022, Tractor Supply received clearance from the FTC to close on its acquisition of Orscheln Farm &amp; Home. In order to mitigate federal anti-trust concerns, Tractor Supply sold 73 Orscheln stores and the Orscheln distribution center in Moberly, Missouri, to Bomgaars; 12 stores were sold to Missouri-based farm store chain Buchheit.

As of late 2024, Tractor Supply had 2,216 locations with a target of 3,000. The target number of locations increased by 200 from the previous year.

==Products==
Tractor Supply carries between 15,500 and 20,000 products in store, including work and recreational clothing, lawn and garden tools, home goods, fencing, truck beds, chicken coops, pet food, and feed for farm animals. Around 15 percent of in-store products are unique to each store&#x27;s region. Online, the company offers thirteen product categories and sells between 125,000 and 150,000 products.

In 2020, the livestock and pet products category accounted for 47 percent of the company&#x27;s sales. Two categories tied for second-highest sales with 21 percent each: hardware, tools, truck and towing products; and seasonal products such as lawn and garden equipment, gifts, and toys. They were followed by clothing and footwear with 7 percent and agricultural products with 4 percent of sales. Tractor Supply&#x27;s exclusive brands represented 29 percent of their total sales in 2021.

From 1998 to 2002, George Strait was the spokesman for Tractor Supply.

===Acquisitions and subsidiaries===
In 2002, Tractor Supply was part of a group (also including four liquidation firms) that purchased some of the leases of the bankrupt Quality Stores, a Michigan-based company. The company operated over 300 stores in 30 states under the names CT Farm &amp; Country; Country General; Quality Farm &amp; Fleet; County Post; Central Farm and Fleet, and FISCO. 

In September 2016, Tractor Supply acquired Petsense, a small-box specialty retailer of pet supplies primarily located in small and mid-size communities. 

In February 2021, the company announced that it would acquire Orscheln Farm &amp; Home for $297 million. The acquisition was approved by the Federal Trade Commission in October of 2022 on the condition that 85 of the locations to be acquired would be divested. Tractor Supply sold 73 stores to Bomgaars Supply and 12 stores to Burcheit Enterprises. Tractor Supply received about $72 million in consideration for these locations.

Tractor Supply also owns Del&#x27;s Feed &amp; Farm Supply, a former farm retail chain in the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii, with all but two Del&#x27;s stores having been converted into Tractor Supply stores.

In 2019, Tractor Supply started working with the MuttNation Foundation, a nonprofit founded by Miranda Lambert that helps shelter pets. The foundation is supported by proceeds from MuttNation&#x27;s line of pet products sold by Tractor Supply.

In 2020, Tractor Supply joined Land O&#x27;Lakes, Microsoft and others in the American Connection Project to support rural broadband access.

In 2022, Tractor Supply announced that it would spend $5 million over the next five years to support the FFA Future Leaders Scholarship. As of late 2024, about 300 students have received such scholarships for use at colleges and trade schools.

As of 2024, Tractor Supply supports service members, veterans, and first responders through its &quot;Hometown Heroes&quot; program. The program provides several perks to these groups.

TSC said it would stop submitting data to Human Rights Campaign and would no longer sponsor pride festivals. It eliminated internal DEI roles and abandoned its DEI goals. TSC also gave up its plan to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040. The company said that the changes were made to better represent the values of its customers who were upset by its practices.

<text>Ahmet Piriştina (8 April 1952 – 15 June 2004) was a Turkish politician who was Mayor of İzmir from 1999 to 2004. He was of Albanian descent, his family was from the city of Prishtina.

Piriştina was born in İzmir, Turkey. He was elected as Mayor of İzmir in two consecutive elections, in 1999 and 2004. As mayor he became known in Izmir for keeping his electoral promises and being an honest politician. He died of a heart attack at the age of 52. Mayor Piriştina&#x27;s image was draped by Izmir residents over buildings, monuments, boats and buses, while over a million people attended his funeral.

==Political life==

During his terms of office he launched many projects to resolve the structural problems of İzmir and protect İzmir&#x27;s natural resources and cultural heritage. Some examples of his achievements are:

* İzmir Port Area Urban Design International Ideas Competition: The aim of this competition was to encourage new ideas for the development of urban areas and the architectural character of the İzmir port area, and, following this competition, construct a new city centre in the port area of an international repute.
* Channel Project: The aim of this project was to collect the domestic and industrial waste water throughout İzmir and, after purification, to discharge them to the Gulf of İzmir, the biggest natural gulf of Turkey. This project resulted in a reduction in the pollution levels of the Gulf.
* Parks and gardens: Mr Piriştina created of open spaces. He also grassed over street refuges and viaducts and not only doubled the area of open spaces but also improved their appearance.
* Metro Project: He constructed the İzmir Metro to reduce traffic congestion. With its high technology and coordination, the İzmir Metro System became an important model for many developed countries.
* Car Park Project: Rapid immigration resulted in a spate of unplanned and chaotic construction, accompanied by a decline in open spaces and car parking lots. Such a one process, local administrations experience difficulties in finding corresponding places for increasing access needs, and come across with high costs. Despite these problems, the İzmir Metropolitan Government created new areas to meet the requirements for car parking.
* The Project of Protecting Water Sources: While providing a reliable water supply to İzmir, he was setting workers to resolve firmly to protect existent water sources for ensuring high quality and healthy water to İzmir. Besides of these, Piriştina entrenched and safeguarded the dam of Tahtalı and its basin. Tahtalı barrage is important for İzmir because it makes up the shortage in water supply to the city.
* Parent House of İzmir: Among the buildings constructed during the period of İzmir’s Republic, Fire Department Building had a privilege. Because of this concession, Mr. Piriştina restored this building and made it Parent House of İzmir.
* Museums in İzmir: Ahmet Piriştina constructed a culture park for historical artifacts (stone, ceramic and precious works of art). This museum contains many precious works covering several civilisations.

<text>Michael Damian Weir (born April 26, 1962) is an American actor, singer, director, writer, and producer, best known for his role as Danny Romalotti on the soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, which he played from 1981 to 1998, 2002 to 2004, 2008, 2012 to 2013, and again from 2022 to 2024.

==Career==
Michael began his music career as a member of his family band, The Weirz, who released two self-titled albums, one in 1975 and one in 1979. After a 1981 appearance on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; in support of his debut single, a cover of the Eric Carmen tune &quot;She Did It”, Damian was offered the part of struggling singer, Danny Romalotti, on the daytime television series &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

Michael appeared in three episodes of the popular television series &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; (in 1985 - Season 6 episodes 19-20 as well as 1986 in the nineteenth episode of Season 7) playing Flyman, the love interest of Jo Polniaczek (Nancy McKeon).

Damian performed the theme song to &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;.

After twelve years with &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, Damian landed the starring role in the Broadway production of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice&#x27;s musical, &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;. With Damian cast as Joseph, the production set a single day box-office record as well as a historical record for the highest weekly gross for a Broadway revival at the Minskoff Theatre. &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; had 231 performances at the Minskoff Theatre from November 10, 1993, to May 29, 1994. The cast album earned a Grammy Award nomination in the &quot;Best Musical Show Album&quot; category.

Damian has released five albums with three top 40 hits, including his number-one cover of the David Essex song &quot;Rock On&quot; (from the &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot; soundtrack), which was certified gold in 1989. He also won a BMI Song-writing Award for his hit single &quot;Was It Nothing at All.” He made his feature film directorial debut with an indie comedy, &quot;Hot Tamale&quot;, which he co-wrote with his wife Janeen, who is the daughter of actor James Best. Following in the family film genre, he directed the films &quot;Moondance Alexander&quot;, &quot;Flicka 2&quot;, &quot;Marley &amp; Me: The Puppy Years&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;A Princess for Christmas&quot;. In 2012, he directed and co-wrote, again with his wife, the 90-minute romantic comedy &quot;The Sweeter Side of Life&quot;, co-starring his father-in-law veteran actor James Best in his last film role. The film premiered on the Hallmark Channel on January 19, 2013.

<doc id="739711" wikidata="Q1971610" url="?curid=739711" title="Ecco the Dolphin (video game)">
<text>Ecco the Dolphin (エコー・ザ・ドルフィン) is an action-adventure game developed by Ed Annunziata and Novotrade International and published by Sega for the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1992. Versions for the Sega CD, Master System and Game Gear were released the following years. It is the first installment in the &quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; video game franchise. The player character is a bottlenose dolphin who travels through time to combat hostile extraterrestrials in Earth&#x27;s oceans and on an alien spacecraft.

&quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; received favourable reviews and became a bestseller on the Genesis. It has been re-released several times, including on the Nintendo Virtual Console, Xbox Live Arcade, Steam, iOS, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. A sequel, &quot;&quot;, was released in 1994.

==Gameplay==
Ecco can attack enemies by ramming into them at high speeds. Swimming can be made progressively faster by tapping a certain button, and the speed can be maintained by holding it down. Players can perform a purely aesthetic spin in the air when jumping out of the water.

Two features of the gameplay are based on actual dolphin habits: one button causes Ecco to sing, allowing him to speak with other cetaceans and interact with certain objects. The same button is used for echolocation: holding it down causes the song to return, generating a map of the area. Several levels contain enormous crystals called &quot;glyphs&quot;, which respond in different ways if Ecco touches or sings to them. Some block paths, and a &quot;key-glyph&quot; must be found in such cases to pass. Others give information, and a few in later levels replenish health/air and give Ecco temporary invulnerability.

Additionally, Ecco, being a mammal, must surface periodically for air or find an air vent. If the &quot;air meter&quot; runs out, Ecco loses health rapidly, which represents drowning. His health is measured by a separate meter (above the air meter) which is depleted by enemies or when his air meter runs out and can be recharged by eating fish, &quot;singing&quot; to clams, or, later in the game, singing to special statues or glyphs. Ecco&#x27;s song can be optionally upgraded at two points in the game: one upgrade allows Ecco&#x27;s song to be used in combination with a charge as a long-range weapon, and the other temporarily disorients sharks and makes minor enemies freeze temporarily. Touching an enemy by any means other than an attack causes Ecco to sustain damage. The enemies range from seahorses to giant octopods.

==Plot==
The game opens with Ecco, a bottlenose dolphin, as he and his pod are swimming in their home bay. A podmate challenges Ecco to a game to see how high he can jump into the air. When he is in the air, a giant waterspout forms and sucks up all marine life in the bay except Ecco, leaving him alone in the bay. Upon leaving the bay, Ecco swims around meeting other marine life including other dolphins who tell them they have felt the storm and the entire ocean is in chaos. An orca that Ecco encounters tells him to travel to the Arctic to meet the &quot;Big Blue&quot;, an ancient blue whale revered by marine life for his age and wisdom, who might be able to help Ecco on his journey. Arriving in the Arctic after a long journey through the ocean, Ecco finds the Big Blue, who says that the storms occur every 500 years. Though the Big Blue doesn&#x27;t know what causes the storms, he suggests that Ecco should seek the Asterite, the oldest life form on Earth. Acting on this advice, Ecco leaves the Arctic and travels to a deep-sea cavern, where he finds the Asterite. To his dismay, though the Asterite would otherwise have the power to aid Ecco, it currently can&#x27;t, as some orbs from its body were lost a long time ago. The Asterite tells Ecco to go to the sunken ruins of the city of Atlantis, where he can use the time machine left behind by the Atlanteans to retrieve the orbs.

Ecco travels to the sunken city of Atlantis, where he discovers an ancient library filled with Glyphs, giant crystals filled with information. From the library, Ecco learns about the source of the storms: an alien race known as the Vortex lost the ability to produce food on their planet. According to the texts, when the planets align once every 500 years, the Vortex use their technology to harvest from the waters of Earth. The Atlanteans fought a long war with the Vortex, which only ended when the Vortex fired a beam at Atlantis, sending the city into the depths of the ocean. Learning this, Ecco activates the time machine and travels 55 million years into Earth&#x27;s past. While Ecco is in the past he learns an ancient song to communicate with a &quot;Pteranodon&quot;. Ecco locates the Asterite in the past but is immediately attacked by it. Forced into battle, he manages to dislodge a globe from it. This opens a time portal and he is sent back into the present. After receiving the globe, the Asterite grants him the power to turn his sonar into a deadly weapon against the Vortex, as well as the abilities to breathe underwater and to slowly regenerate lost health. The Asterite instructs him to use the time machine to travel back in time to the hour of the harvest. This time he manages to be sucked into the waterspout with his pod. Ecco is sent flying through outer space to a giant tube-like machine. Making his way through the construct Ecco arrives on the planet Vortex engaging the aliens in combat. He makes his way to the Vortex Queen and engages her in a fight. When the Queen is defeated, she spits out Ecco&#x27;s pod, and the dolphins make their collective escape back to Earth.

==Development==
The existence of &quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; had been heavily rumored throughout the industry before it was finally revealed by Sega in 1992 as a Mega Drive/Genesis exclusive, then simply known as &quot;Dolphin&quot;. After deciding to create a game based around dolphins, developer Ed Annunziata carried out research on the subject and was particularly inspired by the book &quot;Sounding&quot; by Hank Searls which explained how the creatures use echolocation. Annunziata worked with the music team on the soundtrack, playing them songs by Pink Floyd to illustrate the feeling he was aiming for. Annunziata later said: &quot;I was paranoid about game rentals and kids beating the game over the weekend. So... I... uh... made it hard&quot;. His favourite level was &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot;, which was &quot;way over the top challenging&quot;.

Annunziata had considered naming the character after the constellation Delphinus, which is depicted on the character&#x27;s forehead. But Sega&#x27;s director of marketing Al Nilsen suggested the name &quot;Botticelli the Dolphin&quot;, citing the popularity of characters named after Italian artists, like the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. Panicked, Annunziata turned to his boss Clyde Grossman who suggested &quot;Echo&quot;, which alluded to the dolphin&#x27;s echolocation ability. Annunziata loved the idea. Being of Italian descent, he chose the spelling &quot;Ecco&quot;, because it can loosely mean &quot;I see&quot; in that language, and &quot;seeing with sound&quot; is what echolocation enables dolphins to do. Another explanation is that it references John C. Lilly, a controversial scientist who believed in an alien organization called the Earth Coincidence Control Office or E.C.C.O. and was also noted for his work with Dolphins. Annuziata stated on Facebook once that he &quot;read a lot from John C. Lilly.&quot;

The penultimate level of the game is titled &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot;, named after &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot;, a song on Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1975 studio album &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;. &quot;&quot; (1994) features a level called &quot;New Machine&quot;, named after &quot;A New Machine&quot;, a two-part song on Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot;.

==Release==
The Mega Drive/Genesis version of the game was released in December 1992. The game was ported to multiple consoles throughout the years.

Versions for the Game Gear and the Master System were also released; they feature different levels from the other versions and a special intro featuring a whale song, and dolphin noises for the title screen. The Game Gear version has a dolphin &quot;SEGA&quot; on the SEGA screen and dolphins laughing on the title screen, along with a new soundtrack by Csaba Gigor and Gábor Foltán, as well as a wider color gamut.

An enhanced Sega CD version that features new and redesigned levels and an alternate Red Book audio soundtrack, composed by Spencer Nilsen, was also released. In Japan, the Sega CD version was only released in a compilation (along with &quot;Ecco: The Tides of Time&quot;), titled &quot;Ecco the Dolphin CD&quot;, on February 24, 1995. The Sega CD version was later ported to Windows. The Windows port was further enhanced with higher resolution graphics. In 2014 a fan-made fixed and enhanced version, dubbed &quot;Ecco PC Fixed &amp; Enhanced Edition&quot;, became available.

&quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot;, along with &quot;&quot; and &quot;Ecco Jr.&quot;, can be found on the PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable game &quot;Sega Genesis Collection&quot;.

In 2002, Sega&#x27;s first attempt to enter the downloadable retail game content business occurred on the digital storefront RealOne Arcade. The first few titles released included &quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot;, &quot;Columns III&quot; and &quot;Shinobi III.&quot; These downloadable releases came in one-hour trial versions.

&quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; was released in Europe and Australia for the Virtual Console on Nintendo&#x27;s Wii console on December 8, 2006, for 800 Wii Points. It was released later in North America on November 28 for 800 Wii Points, and in Japan on December 2 for 600 Wii Points.

&quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; was released on the Xbox Live Arcade on August 15, 2007, for the Xbox 360.

&quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; is part of &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, along with its sequel.

&quot;3D Ecco the Dolphin&quot; is a port of the game for the Nintendo 3DS as part of Sega&#x27;s 3D Classics line. Along with stereoscopic 3D graphics and the option to choose between Japanese and international versions of the game, the port also adds &#x27;Super Dolphin Mode&#x27;, which decreases the difficulty by giving players invincibility and unlimited oxygen. The game was released for the Nintendo eShop in Japan on June 26 and in North America and Europe on December 12, 2013.

&quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; is one of the games included on both Sega Genesis Mini consoles (with the Megadrive/Genesis cartridge version being on the first mini and the Sega CD version being on the second mini).

In 1996, a soundtrack album combining music from both &quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; and &quot;Ecco: The Tides of Time&quot; was released, under the title &quot;Ecco: Songs of Time&quot;.

==Reception==
The Sega Mega Drive version became a bestseller. It sold over 570,000 copies worldwide. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; called the PC release &quot;little more than a conversion from the yesteryears of the 16-bit Sega Genesis. Except for a few video cut-scenes, there is little attempt to make this game look or play better for the PC&quot;. He nonetheless praised the game not only for its novel concept and responsive controls, but also &quot;its smooth graphics&quot;.

&quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at No. 24 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time. &quot;Complex&quot; ranked &quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; number 44 in their &quot;The Best 100 Sega Genesis Games&quot;. They called the game: &quot;the most soothing puzzle-action game available on the Genesis.&quot; In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; ranked the Sega CD version 100th on their Top 100 Video Games, they praised the game&#x27;s atmosphere, eerie music, sad dolphin song and the rich underwater look, concluding: &quot;Proof that you don’t need explosions, fatalities or a celebrity endorsement to make a great game.&quot;

<text>Lowe&#x27;s Companies, Inc. ( ) is an American retail company specializing in home improvement. Headquartered in Mooresville, North Carolina, the company operates a chain of retail stores in the United States. As of Oct. 28, 2022, Lowe&#x27;s and its related businesses operated 2,181 home improvement and hardware stores in North America.

Lowe&#x27;s is the second-largest hardware chain in the United States (previously the largest in the U.S. until surpassed by Home Depot in 1989) behind rival the Home Depot and ahead of Menards. It is also the second-largest hardware chain in the world, also behind the Home Depot, but ahead of European retailers Leroy Merlin, B&amp;Q, and OBI.

The company previously operated in Australia through the Masters Home Improvement joint venture until 2016, in Mexico until 2019, and in Canada until selling its operations (which will be consolidated under the Rona brand) to Sycamore Partners in 2023.

==History==

The first Lowe&#x27;s store, Mr. L.S. Lowe&#x27;s North Wilkesboro Hardware, opened in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina, in 1921 by Lucius Smith Lowe. After Lowe died in 1940, the business was inherited by his daughter, Ruth Buchan, who sold the company to her brother, James Lowe, for $4,200, that same year. James took on his brother-in-law H. Carl Buchan as a partner in 1943.

Buchan anticipated the dramatic increase in construction after World War II, and under his management, the store focused on hardware and building materials. Before then, the product mix had also included notions, dry goods, horse tack, snuff, produce, and groceries. Buchan and Lowe started the concept of procuring large quantities of products directly from manufacturers, which eliminated the wholesaler and allowed them to offer customers lower prices. The company opened its second store in Sparta, North Carolina, in 1949. 

In 1952, Buchan became the sole owner of Lowe&#x27;s, and the company was incorporated as Lowe&#x27;s North Wilkesboro Hardware. In 1954, Jim Lowe started the Lowes Foods grocery store chain.

In 1960, Buchan died of a heart attack at age 44. His five-man executive team, which included Robert Strickland and Leonard Herring, took the company public in 1961 under the name Lowe&#x27;s Companies Inc. By 1962, Lowe&#x27;s operated 21 stores and reported annual revenues of $32 million. Lowe&#x27;s began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1979. By 1970s, Lowe&#x27;s revenue reached more than $150 million and, in 1980, to nearly $900 million.

Lowe&#x27;s has since grown nationally, as it was aided by the purchase of the Renton, Washington–based Eagle Hardware &amp; Garden company in 1999. The first store outside the United States was in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. According to its website, Lowe&#x27;s has operated/serviced more than 2,355 locations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico alone, although the Mexican stores were closed in the late 2010s.

Lowe&#x27;s formerly operated in Mexico with 14 locations: 8 in Monterrey, Nuevo León, 1 in Saltillo, Coahuila, 1 in Hermosillo, Sonora, 1 in Chihuahua, Chihuahua, 1 in Culiacán, Sinaloa, 1 in Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes and 1 in León, Guanajuato. Lowe&#x27;s Mexico closed all its stores on April 10, 2019.

In 2023, Lowe&#x27;s sold its Canadian retail business, based in Boucherville, Quebec, to Sycamore Partners for $400 million in cash. They will all be consolidated into Rona stores.

== Finances ==
In 2020, for the May–July yearly quarter, the company reported sales of $27.3 billion; in 2019, for the same period, the firm had reported sales of $21 billion. The digital sales for the same period also were up to 135%. The sales surges were a result of consumers switching their buying habits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Seventy five percent of the company&#x27;s revenue comes from do it yourself consumers.
===Historical data===
For the fiscal year 2019 (2/1/2019-1/31/2020), Lowe&#x27;s reported earnings of US$4.281 billion, with an annual revenue of US$72.148 billion, an increase of 1.17% over the previous fiscal cycle. Lowe&#x27;s shares traded at over $116 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$90.32 billion in January 2020. Lowe&#x27;s ranked No. 42 on the 2019 Fortune 500 list. Lowes announced a $10 billion stock buyback at the end of 2018 to begin in 2019, while trimming jobs.

For the fiscal year 2018, Lowe&#x27;s reported earnings of US$2.314 billion, with an annual revenue of US$71.309 billion, an increase of 3.92% over the previous fiscal cycle. Lowe&#x27;s shares traded at over $96 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$75.8 billion in October 2018. Lowe&#x27;s ranked No. 40 on the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.

==Headquarters==

In 1998, Lowe&#x27;s purchased the Wilkes Mall in Wilkesboro, North Carolina, to serve as the company&#x27;s headquarters. In 2002, Lowe&#x27;s acquired full control over the building after the 10 remaining mall tenants vacated the property. A year later, Lowe&#x27;s constructed and relocated the corporate headquarters to a new, 350-acre campus in Mooresville, North Carolina. The new facility contains a five-story and two seven-story buildings. The building has a central atrium and two office wings; the atrium houses a food court, a five-story spiral staircase, and meeting and reception rooms. A lake flows underneath the headquarters building.

Lowe&#x27;s maintained its former headquarters in Wilkesboro, where it employed over 2,400 people until 2019. In 2011, Lowe&#x27;s invested $10 million in improvements and renovations in the property, including a full-service food court, coffee shop, and health center, as well as gating the entire property with an addition of a guardhouse. All positions have since been relocated and the former Wilkes corporate office is vacant, although still owned by Lowe&#x27;s.

In addition to Wilkesboro, Lowe&#x27;s formerly operated a customer contact center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, both of which quietly closed in 2023. Currently, customer contact centers remain in Indianapolis, Indiana and India.

On June 27, 2019, Lowe&#x27;s announced the construction of a $153 million, 23-story tower in Charlotte&#x27;s fast-growing South End neighborhood, which will be completed by 2020 and eventually house 2000 employees, 400 of whom will move from the headquarters. The new tower will house a &quot;global technology hub&quot; for Lowe&#x27;s. The state of North Carolina is providing $54 million in incentives provided Lowe&#x27;s meets certain goals.

==Environmental record==

Lowe&#x27;s won eight consecutive Energy Star awards from 2003 to 2010, including four Energy Star Partner of the Year awards for educating consumers about the benefits of energy efficiency. On March 1, 2010, Lowe&#x27;s also became the first winner of the Energy Star Sustained Excellence Award in Retail, to recognize its contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by promoting energy-efficient products and educating consumers and employees on the value of the Energy Star program. In 2000, Lowe&#x27;s released a policy promising that all wood products sold would not be sourced from rainforests. However, according to a 2006 report released by the Environmental Investigation Agency, wood used in flooring by Armstrong Flooring that Lowe&#x27;s was selling had been coming from the forests of Indonesia’s remote Papua Province, where some logging was estimated to be illegal. According to the Telepak report, which was the sole basis of the EIA allegations, Armstrong commissioned an independent audit of Kreasi&#x27;s merbau supplies over the last 18 month which found documentation relating to the source of the company&#x27;s merbau logs in Papua, and based on this, Armstrong decided to continue to trade in merbau supplied by Kreasi. The cited report dates to 2006 and Lowe&#x27;s continues to claim its wood products come from known sources; is legally harvested and traded, and more.

On April 17, 2014, Lowe&#x27;s paid a $500,000 penalty for violations of the federal Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) Rule, which require renovation contractors, such as window and carpet installers to manage the risk of lead dust when renovating customer homes. As of 2022, this is the largest RRP violation to ever occur. In the words of the EPA, &quot;“This settlement will ensure that not only children in southern Illinois, but children throughout the United States will be better protected from the known hazards associated with lead exposure&quot;.

On March 6, 2020, Lowe&#x27;s paid a $1,600,000 fine for violating California&#x27;s air quality regulations. This includes violations in NOx emissions from ovens and asbestos from demolition/renovation activities.

===Carbon footprint===
Lowe&#x27;s reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the 12 months ending 31 December 2020 at 1,971 Kt (-138 /-6.5% y-o-y). Lowe&#x27;s plans to reduce emissions 40% by 2025 from a 2016 base year.

==Labor relations==
In April 2019, a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) judge found that Lowe’s had violated the National Labor Relations Act by illegally forbidding workers from discussing their pay.

In August 2022, Lowe&#x27;s announced that it was awarding $55 million in bonus income to front-line workers, and that it was offering staff discounts on common household and cleaning items in light of recent inflationary pressures.

In October 2022, a group of 172 workers at a Lowe&#x27;s store in New Orleans, Louisiana, organizing under the banner of Lowe&#x27;s Workers United and led by a worker at the store named Felix Allen, filed for a union election with the NLRB. In June 2023, Felix Allen was fired, leading to multiple unfair labor practice charges being filed with the NLRB against Lowe&#x27;s, accusing the company of multiple violations of labor law in response to the unionization drive at the New Orleans store, including surveillance, interrogation of employees, and retaliating against union organizers.

==Advertising and sponsorships==
In January 2019, Lowes became the official home improvement sponsor of the National Football League. In April 2024, Lowes launched a partnership with Major League Soccer&#x27;s Inter Miami CF, Lionel Messi, and the 2024 Copa América.

=== Racing sponsorships ===

Lowe&#x27;s purchased naming rights to Charlotte Motor Speedway in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1998, and the speedway changed names to Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway. After the 10-year naming rights expired, Lowe&#x27;s extended naming rights by one year. After the one-year extension expired, Lowe&#x27;s discontinued naming rights, and as of the 2010 racing season, the racetrack returned to its original name.

The corporation was the primary sponsor for seven-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson in the No. 48 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 and it was a part-time sponsor of the former No. 5 Nationwide Series car; both teams are owned by Hendrick Motorsports. Prior to the current sponsorship deal with Hendrick Motorsports, Lowe&#x27;s was the sponsor of the No. 31 Chevrolet for Richard Childress Racing driven by Mike Skinner and Robby Gordon from 1997 to 2001. Prior to the RCR deal, Lowe&#x27;s was the primary sponsor of the No. 11 Ford driven by Brett Bodine for Junior Johnson &amp; Associates and later his own team, Brett Bodine Racing (after Bodine bought the No. 11 from Johnson). One of the company&#x27;s earliest forays into racing sponsorship was in 1979, when it sponsored the No. 2 Buick of the Rod Osterlund team in what was then known the Winston Cup Series, for the Talladega 500. The car was driven in that race by David Pearson, substituting for injured rookie Dale Earnhardt. Lowe&#x27;s continued with sporadic car sponsorship throughout the next two decades until the aforementioned Bodine sponsorship in 1995. On March 14, 2018, Lowe&#x27;s announced it would end sponsorship of the No. 48 car after the 2018 season, thereby ending all involvement in motorsports.

Lowe&#x27;s also sponsored Fernandez Racing in the American Le Mans Series and previously sponsored the team in the Rolex Sports Car Series; in that series, Lowe&#x27;s sponsored the No. 99 Gainsco Stallings Racing Pontiac in events where Johnson was driving.

In 2006, Lowe&#x27;s contracted designer Marianne Cusato to develop and offer affordable house plans for the hurricane-affected Gulf region. Lowe&#x27;s is the exclusive retailer for both the plans and building materials for the Lowe&#x27;s Katrina Cottage. They offer easy construction and affordability, as well as the possibility of expansion. Moreover, they meet all international building codes and exceed hurricane codes. Lowe&#x27;s discontinued the Katrina Cottage line in 2011.

Lowe&#x27;s has a wide variety of television and radio commercials. A significant number of different racing-inspired commercials can be seen and are often played outside of television race coverage. Before 2010, when he was replaced by Ben Yannette, Gene Hackman&#x27;s voice could be heard on many commercial advertisements for Lowe&#x27;s.

===&quot;All-American Muslim&quot; advertising controversy===
Lowe&#x27;s withdrew its advertising from the TLC reality television show &quot;All-American Muslim&quot; in December 2011. A spokesperson for Lowe&#x27;s said, &quot;we understand the program raised concerns, complaints, or issues from multiple sides of the viewer spectrum, which we found after doing research of news articles and blogs covering the show&quot;.

Lowe&#x27;s faced a backlash from several quarters, including Muslim-American and Arab-American organizations. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee called upon members to contact Lowe&#x27;s to urge it to reverse its position. The Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations met to consider possible actions, including boycotts and protests. Several celebrities also called for a boycott. California State Senator Ted Lieu called Lowe&#x27;s decision &quot;naked religious bigotry&quot; and said he would consider legislative action if Lowe&#x27;s did not apologize to Muslim Americans and reinstate the ads. Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League expressed similar views. Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to the United States Congress, criticized Lowe&#x27;s decision to &quot;uphold the beliefs of a fringe hate group and not the creed of the First Amendment&quot;. Representative John Conyers of Michigan called on Lowe&#x27;s to apologize. Michigan state representative Rashida Tlaib contacted the company&#x27;s corporate headquarters, reporting that Lowe&#x27;s declined to change its decision.

==Canada==

Lowe&#x27;s opened its first three stores in Canada on December 10, 2007, in Hamilton, Brampton, and Brantford. On February 1, 2008, they opened three more stores in Toronto, East Gwillimbury, and a second store in Brampton, as well as a new location in Maple (Vaughan). Lowe&#x27;s also expanded into western Canada, starting with three new stores in Calgary, Alberta. One of the three locations opened in late September 2010. The other two opened in early 2011. 

In February 2013, Lowe&#x27;s Canada hired former Walmart Canada and Loblaw Companies executive Sylvain Prud&#x27;homme as CEO.

On May 11, 2015, Lowe&#x27;s Canada announced that it would acquire the leases of 13 former Target Canada stores, as well as an Ontario distribution centre, for $151 million.

In 2012, Lowe&#x27;s attempted to buy Rona, Inc., a Quebec-based hardware chain. However, the deal was met with objections from RONA shareholders (particularly the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec) and operators of its franchised locations over concerns that the company could centralize its supply operations in the United States, and was eventually called off. On February 3, 2016, Rona announced that it had accepted an offer to be acquired by Lowe&#x27;s for CDN$3.2 billion, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The division would remain under the leadership of Sylvain Prud&#x27;homme, but would be operated out of Rona&#x27;s headquarters in Boucherville. Lowe&#x27;s maintained Rona&#x27;s retail banners, &quot;key&quot; executives, and the &quot;vast majority of its current employees&quot; after the acquisition.

In February 2020, Lowe&#x27;s closed 34 low-performance stores, 26 that were under the Rona brand, six Lowe&#x27;s stores, and two Réno-Dépôt stores.

In November 2022, Lowe&#x27;s agreed to sell its Canadian operations to the private equity firm Sycamore Partners for $400 million. with the Lowe&#x27;s stores expected to be rebranded under the Rona brand in the future. The sale was completed on February 3, 2023. In July 2023, Rona announced that it would begin to replace Lowe&#x27;s with the new banner Rona+, beginning with 10 locations in Ontario.

==Australia==

Trading as Masters Home Improvement, the first store opened in Braybrook, Victoria, to tradesmen on August 31, 2011, and later to the general public. Masters was a joint venture between Lowe&#x27;s and Woolworths to compete against Bunnings, which operates in the large bigbox format similar to Lowe&#x27;s and Home Depot.

In January 2016, Woolworths announced that it intended to either sell or wind up all its home improvement areas, including the Masters hardware chain. Chairman Gordon Cairns said that it would take years to become profitable and that the ongoing losses could not be sustained. The windup involved Woolworths buying back a 33.3 per cent interest in the venture, held by the Lowe&#x27;s subsidiary WDR Delaware Corporation. The last stores closed in December 2016.

==Lawsuits==
Lowe&#x27;s was involved in a small cluster of class action lawsuits that revolved around the employee payment system. The cases focused on a pay practice known as &quot;variable rate overtime&quot;. Variable-rate overtime has the effect of paying a decreasing overtime rate the more hours a person works in a week. The suits alleged that salaried managers who worked 40 to 50 hours per week were improperly compensated for that time. The variable rate overtime ended in the first quarter of 2006.

The first case was filed in October 2002 by employees of the Lowe&#x27;s store in Shawnee, Kansas. In September 2005, the cases were certified as a class action. Four similar briefs were filed in New York, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The lawsuits for New York, Indiana, and Kansas resulted in an out-of-court settlement on September 22, 2006. The lawsuit in Pennsylvania became a class-action lawsuit in June 2004, with 550 employees. The case in Ohio was filed by ten former Lowe&#x27;s employees in August 2004.

Lowe&#x27;s faced multiple lawsuits from its Loss Prevention Managers citing that they were classified as exempt employees and therefore denied overtime pay. The managers asserted that they were forced to work a minimum of 48 hours per week which saved Lowe&#x27;s and its investors millions of dollars every year. Lawsuits have been settled for $2.95 million in California and $6.2 million in Texas.

In 2014, Lowe&#x27;s faced a class-action lawsuit from former and current Human Resource Managers. Similarly to the lawsuit regarding its Loss Prevention Managers, the lawsuit stated that the HR Managers were improperly, and illegally, classified as exempt employees and were, therefore, denied overtime even though they were required to work 48-hour weeks.

<text>Ellen Virginia Holly (January 16, 1931 – December 6, 2023) was an American actress. Beginning her career on stage in the late 1950s, Holly was perhaps best known for her role as Carla Gray–Hall on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1968–1980; 1983–1985). Holly is noted as the first African American to appear on daytime television in a leading role.
==Biography==
===Early life, education and family===
Holly was born on January 16, 1931, in New York City, to William Garnet Holly and Grace Holly. Raised in Richmond Hills neighborhood of Queens, Holly graduated from Hunter College. Holly was African American, and claimed African, English, French, and Shinnecock Native heritage. Her father&#x27;s grandmother was Susan Smith McKinney Steward, the third African-American woman to earn a medical degree, and the first in New York state. Her grandaunt was Sarah Smith Thompson Garnet, an educator and suffragist from New York City who was a pioneering African-American female school principal in the New York City public school system. Holly&#x27;s great-grandfather was the Rev. James Theodore Holly, the first African-American bishop in the Protestant Episcopal church, who spent most of his episcopal career as missionary bishop of Haiti. A great-great-grandfather was Sylvanus Smith, one of many leaders encouraging African American people to purchase land in Kings County, New York (later known as the Weeksville settlement). Her maternal aunt was Anna Arnold Hedgeman, a civil rights leader, politician, educator, and writer who served under President Harry Truman as executive director of the National Council for a Permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission.
===Career===
Holly, a life long member of The Actors Studio, Began her acting career in the late-1950s. Holly appeared in several Broadway productions including &quot;Tiger, Tiger Burning Bright&quot; and &quot;A Hand Is on the Gate&quot;; she also played Desdemona in a production of &quot;Othello&quot; by the New York Shakespeare Festival. In 1960, Holly resolved a &quot;feud&quot; with producer Lester Osterman when he cast her in a play. Holly guest-starred on &quot;Sam Benedict&quot; and &quot;The Nurses&quot; prior to starring on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. 
====One Life to Live====
Holly came to the attention of Agnes Nixon, the creator of &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, after writing a letter to the editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; about what it was like to be a light-skinned African American. Nixon created the role of Carla Gray, actress-turned-judge and offered Holly the role. In 1968, Holly became the first African-American actress to star on daytime television. &quot;She is beautiful, plainly cultured, has one of the most alive faces, full of lovely strength, ever to brighten our tube,&quot; wrote television reporter Jack O&#x27;Brian in 1969. When Holly began on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in October 1968, her African-American heritage was not publicized as part of the storyline. Holly&#x27;s character, named Carla Benari, was a touring actress of apparently Italian-American heritage. Carla and white physician Dr. Jim Craig fell in love and became engaged, but she was falling for an African-American doctor. When the two kissed onscreen, it was reported that the switchboards at ABC were busy by fans who thought that the show had shown an African-American and white person kissing. The fact that Carla was an African-American posing as white was revealed when Sadie Gray, played by Lillian Hayman, was identified as her mother. Sadie convinced her daughter to embrace her heritage and tell the truth. Holly left the series in 1980, but returned in 1983. In 1972, Holly was public in her criticism of Anthony Quinn being cast to play Haitian general Henri Christophe. Holly returned to the question of race and casting when she commented on Jonathan Pryce&#x27;s role in &quot;Miss Saigon&quot; in 1990. In 1996, Holly released her autobiography describing her life and struggles as a light-skinned black actress in Hollywood. According to her autobiography &quot;One Life: The Autobiography of an African American Actress&quot;, Holly was fired from the show by new executive producer Paul Rauch in 1985. 
====Later career and life====
In 1988, Holly appeared in Spike Lee&#x27;s School Daze as Mission College president Mr. McPherson&#x27;s wife Odrie. Holly returned to daytime in the long-term recurring role of a judge on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; from 1989 until 1993. Holly made a return to the small screen in 2002, when she appeared as Selena Frey in the television film &quot;10,000 Black Men Named George&quot;, alongside Andre Braugher and Mario Van Peebles. Holly retired from acting in 1993 and became a librarian in White Plains, New York.

===Personal life and death===
Holly was a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority. Holly never married or had children. She had a relationship with her &quot;One Life to Live&quot; co-star Roger Hill, who is also known for his role as Cyrus in the cult film &quot;The Warriors&quot; (1979). In her autobiography, Holly wrote about her romances with actors Harry Belafonte and Ron O&#x27;Neal. Holly died at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx on December 6, 2023, at the age of 92.

<doc id="739724" wikidata="Q3368525" url="?curid=739724" title="Pat Carney">
<text>Patricia Dora Carney (May 26, 1935 – July 25, 2023) was a Canadian politician who served as a member of parliament from 1980 to 1988 and as a Senator from 1990 to 2008.

A member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, she first ran for the House of Commons of Canada during the 1979 Canadian federal election, but was defeated. She ran again in the election the following year and won, representing the district of Vancouver Centre. After winning a second term in the 1984 elections, she held three cabinet positions under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney: minister of Energy, Mines and Resources from 1984 to 1986, minister of International Trade from 1986 to 1988 and President of the Treasury Board for eight months in 1988. She was the first woman named to each of these three major economic cabinet positions. She did not seek a third term during the next federal election in 1988, and was succeeded by future prime minister Kim Campbell. In 1990, Mulroney appointed her to the Senate, where she served until her resignation in 2008.

== Early life ==
Carney was born in Shanghai, China to parents Dora May Sanders and John James Carney, a World War I veteran from British Columbia, Canada who relocated to Shanghai and worked as a public health inspector and police officer for over twenty years. Carney had three siblings, a brother named Thomas (Tom), a twin brother named John James (Jim) and a younger sister, Norah (Nora). Following increasing violence as a result of Japanese occupation of Shanghai and her father&#x27;s interest in pursuing veterinarian medicine at the age of 51, the family relocated to the small town of Morriston, Ontario in 1940 just before Japanese forces began to inter foreign residents. As a result of her father&#x27;s studies and subsequent work as a veterinarian, the family moved to Guelph in 1944 and then to Victoria, British Columbia a year later. They moved again in 1949 to Nelson in British Columbia&#x27;s Kootenay Region. 

Carney&#x27;s brother recalled that she demonstrated a keen interest in organizing various events for her family and neighbours by the time she was ten years old, including plays, which she frequently wrote and starred in. Although Carney&#x27;s mother was proud of her creative inclinations, her father &quot;was equally sure it was all God-damned foolishness, and that [she&#x27;d] starve to death&quot;. The reason for the family&#x27;s move to Nelson was, in part, so Carney and her siblings could work on a farm and learn basic homesteading skills.

== Education and journalist career ==
In the early 1950s, Carney left the family farm for Vancouver, British Columbia where she worked as a freelance journalist for the Vancouver Sun and The Province. In 1956 when Carney was twenty-one years old, Carney married the Vancouver Province&#x27;s rewrite chief, Gordon Dickson. He was fifteen years older than her and had a daughter from a previous marriage. Carney kept her maiden name and continued to work as a freelance journalist to support Dickson while he finished law school, which was unusual for women of the time. Carney and Dickson had a son together but would ultimately divorce in the late 1960s. 

Carney attended the University of British Columbia and graduated in 1960 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics and political science. Alongside her twin brother Jim, Carney joined the university&#x27;s student-run newspaper, the Ubyssey. Carney later recalled that the Ubyssey was where the siblings &quot;pushed open the door and entered the rest of [their] lives.&quot; Jim pursued a career in radio and television and in 1965, Carney became a business columnist for the Vancouver Sun. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Carney continued to freelance for newspapers within Canada and even globally, writing for the Toronto Star, Maclean&#x27;s, the Financial Post, The New York Times, and the Times of London about financial news and economic developments, particularly those in northern Canada. She also wrote television specials for the CBC and CTV on finance and economics. 

== Gemini North ==
In 1970, a strike at the Vancouver Sun left Carney, who was recently divorced and a single mother, unemployed. After struggling to make ends meet as a freelance journalist, Carney went north to the city of Whitehorse, Yukon and started a consulting firm with her brother Jim. Trading under the name of Gemini North, Ltd., the firm worked on a number of projects related to the development of lumber and gas and oil industries in Yukon and the Northwest Territories (NWT). Gemini North also produced a number of studies on the potential social and economic impacts of such projects on local residents and Indigenous people in northern Canada. 

Following the 1970 Centennial Royal Tour of the NWT, Carney, at the invitation of the NWT Commissioner, Stuart Hodgson, produced a book about the tour. Carney became a close friend of Stuart Hodgson and accompanied the Commissioner and his party in the 1971 Canadian North Pole expedition an aborted attempt to reach the Pole by Twin Otter in a bid to establish the route for tourist adventurers. Carney was joined by her brother during the flight in and out of the Polar Basin.

In the early 1970s, Gemini North was commissioned to conduct a survey of local opinion about the installation of a gas pipeline along the Mackenzie River Valley. Carney organised an information tour of the valley with stops at all the river settlements where the fly-in pipeliners conducted workshops explaining to the local people details about the pipeline project. The pipeline&#x27;s tour was shadowed by the president of the Northwest Territories Indian Brotherhood president James Wah-shee and was seen in native rights circles as a demonstration of the Brotherhood&#x27;s aim to be consulted before any pipeline work started. Shortly after this tour the Brotherhood applied for a development caveat to stop all development on treaty land. This caveat eventually led to the pipeline inquiry which resulted in the project being shelved.

A fictionalized account of these events was published in 2008.

== Political career ==
=== Member of Parliament ===
Carney first ran for the House of Commons of Canada as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the 1979 election and was defeated. She was elected in the 1980 election as the Member of Parliament (MP) from Vancouver Centre.

=== Cabinet minister ===
When the Tories formed government under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney as a result of the 1984 election, Carney was appointed to Cabinet as Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, and was responsible for dismantling the previous Canadian government&#x27;s unpopular National Energy Program.

In 1986, she was named Minister of International Trade and, as such, was involved in negotiating the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement.

Carney did not run for re-election in the 1988 election due to continuing pain from arthritis.

=== Senator ===
In 1990, she was appointed to the Canadian Senate by Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn. In January 1991, Carney—a pro-choice advocate of women&#x27;s rights to abortion—voted against the restrictive, anti-abortion Bill C-43 proposed by her successor as MP for Vancouver Centre and fellow Conservative party member, Kim Campbell. Despite &quot;heavy, heavy pressure&quot; from Campbell and other party members, Carney maintained her opposition and the bill failed in the Senate with a tie vote, the first legislation to do so in 30 years. In 2023, Carney recalled that &quot;Conservative senators were not expected to vote down their own government&#x27;s bill. We had the option to simply abstain.&quot; Several male senators planned to abstain as they felt abortion was a &quot;women&#x27;s issue&quot; but when they saw Carney vote no, it spurred them to similarly oppose the bill and contribute to its defeat.

In 1997, Carney suggested that British Columbia might benefit from separating from Canada.

In 2000, Carney acted on concerns that landmark lighthouses on both Canadian coasts were being neglected by teaming up with Senator Mike Forrestall from Nova Scotia to introduce the &quot;Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act&quot;, a private members bill which enjoyed consistent multi-party support in subsequent minority Parliaments and which received royal assent in 2008.

On October 11, 2007, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office announced that Senator Carney intended to resign, two years in advance of the mandatory retirement age of 75 years. She officially resigned on January 31, 2008. In 2011, she was made a Member of the Order of Canada &quot;for her public service as a journalist, politician and senator.&quot;

<text>Merrill Anthony McPeak (born January 9, 1936) is a retired 4-star general in the United States Air Force whose final assignment before retirement was as the 14th Chief of Staff of the Air Force from 1990 to 1994.

In 1993, McPeak served as Acting Secretary of the Air Force, before Sheila E. Widnall was appointed by President Bill Clinton, and is the only Chief of Staff of the Air Force and uniformed Air Force officer on active duty to have ever served as Acting Secretary.

==Early life and education==
McPeak was born in Santa Rosa, California. After graduating from Grants Pass High School in Grants Pass, Oregon, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from San Diego State College in 1957 and became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. He was commissioned through Air Force ROTC, and entered active duty in November of that year. He later earned a Master of Arts degree in international relations from George Washington University in 1974.

==Career==

After completing preflight and pilot training, McPeak flew single-seat fighter aircraft, the F-100 Super Sabre and the F-104 Starfighter, in operational squadrons in the United States and the United Kingdom. He later returned to the United States as an instructor pilot and weapons officer at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona.

From December 1966 to December 1968, McPeak was assigned as an opposing solo and then lead solo pilot with the Thunderbirds, the Air Force&#x27;s aerobatic flying team. While with the Thunderbirds, he performed in nearly 200 air shows in the United States and overseas.

Upon completion of his tour with the Thunderbirds, he was assigned as an F-100 pilot with the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing at Phù Cát Air Base in South Vietnam. On February 1, 1969, he was assigned to Project Commando Sabre (Detachment 1, 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron), known as the &quot;Misty&quot; FACs, a specialized group of high speed forward air controllers trying to stop vehicular resupply traffic down the Ho Chi Minh Trail. He became the tenth commander of Commando Sabre on April 22, 1969, and moved it to the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing at Tuy Hoa Air Base on May 1, when the 37th TFW transitioned to the twin-seat F-4 Phantom II. Rotating out of his command on May 31, 1969 after 98 missions, he served as chief of standardization and evaluation for 31st TFW. McPeak completed a total of 269 combat missions while in Vietnam, was awarded the Silver Star, and remained in-country until 1970, after which he attended the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia.

From 1970 to 1973, McPeak was an air operations staff officer for the Mideast Division at Headquarters USAF in Washington, D.C. After graduating from the National War College in 1974, he was named assistant deputy commander for operations for the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing at MacDill AFB, Florida flying the F-4 Phantom II. From 1975 to 1976, he was a military fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City.

In 1976, McPeak contributed an article to &quot;Foreign Affairs Journal&quot; expressing his views on the Israeli occupation of territories during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.

In July 1976, he became commander of the 513th Combat Support Group based at RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom; a year later he moved to Zaragoza Air Base, Spain as vice commander of the 406th Tactical Fighter Training Wing. From 1978 to 1980, he was assistant chief of staff for current operations, Allied Air Forces Central Europe (in Boerfink, West Germany). 1980 and 1981 saw him flying the twin-seat F-111E fighter bomber and commanding the 20th Tactical Fighter Wing based at RAF Upper Heyford, United Kingdom. McPeak was chief of staff at USAFE headquarters from 1981 to 1982, and deputy chief of staff for plans at Tactical Air Command (TAC) headquarters, Langley AFB, Virginia from 1982 to 1985. He returned to Headquarters USAF in 1985–87 as deputy chief of staff for programs and resources.

In June 1987, McPeak moved to Bergstrom AFB, Texas in the dual roles of Commander, 12th Air Force and Commander of Air Forces for United States Southern Command. A year later, he was named commander-in-chief of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF).

== Air Force Chief of Staff ==


McPeak was appointed Air Force Chief of Staff by President George H. W. Bush in October 1990, replacing the retiring General Michael Dugan following the latter&#x27;s removal from the CSAF post by SECDEF Dick Cheney for ill-timed and inappropriate comments to the news media regarding Iraq during Operation Desert Shield.

McPeak took over as chief of staff during Operation Desert Shield, and assisted in overall strategic planning for Operation Desert Storm.

McPeak&#x27;s later tenure as chief of staff following the Gulf War also saw a major reduction in force in terms of aircraft, units, officers and enlisted airmen across the entire Air Force as a result of the end of the Cold War. During his time as chief of staff, he oversaw the disestablishment of Strategic Air Command (SAC), Tactical Air Command (TAC), Military Airlift Command (MAC), Air Force Systems Command (AFSC), Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC), and Air Force Communications Command (AFCC), with assets transferred primarily to the newly established Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and the then-Air Force Communications Agency. His tenure also oversaw the merging of Air Training Command (ATC) and Air University (AU) into the Air Education and Training Command (AETC).

McPeak pushed through major organizational changes in the Air Force aimed at streamlining and emphasizing operations and combat readiness. Much of his tenure focused on elevating the status of flight operations, especially single-seat fighter pilots, some say at the expense of multi-seat fighter, bomber and reconnaissance aircraft and personnel, cargo and air refueling aircraft and personnel, and non-flying career fields. He also created the Air Force Expeditionary Wing concept, a fusion of combat forces and support into a single organization. He also transferred several flying wing and space wing command billets to brigadier generals, even though previously these had been commanded by colonels.

However, McPeak is best remembered by many current and since-retired Air Force personnel for the sweeping changes he made to the Air Force&#x27;s service dress uniform, especially for commissioned officers. Worn by personnel during most garrison duties, the new version was a radical departure from the earlier version, which was essentially the same design as the then-U.S. Army service uniform (the U.S. Air Force was originally the U.S. Army Air Corps and then the U.S. Army Air Forces), but with fewer insignia and in blue. In addition to a new three-button design with fewer and non-buttoning pockets, it changed the rank insignia for officers to use naval-style sleeve stripes, as opposed to metal pins on shoulder straps. Because of the new uniform&#x27;s resemblance to both commissioned officer&#x27;s uniforms of the U.S. Navy and those of commercial airline pilots, the McPeak uniform was said to be unpopular with Air Force service members. Some uniform changes were subsequently reversed by his successor. The basic redesign continues to be worn to this day, but the navalized sleeve braid rank insignia was eliminated and shoulder straps with pin-on rank for officers reinstated. McPeak&#x27;s original concept of simplifying and toning down the various devices and insignia pinned to the uniform has gone by the wayside, with nearly all USAF personnel wearing at least one, if not two, three or more metal insignia with their dress uniforms.

McPeak also acted as Secretary of the Air Force for three weeks in 1993, before the formal appointment and confirmation of Sheila E. Widnall, becoming the only person to have ever concurrently served in both capacities. McPeak continued as Chief of Staff through October 1994, retiring afterwards.

McPeak&#x27;s legacy as Chief of Staff has been considered in several quarters as one of the most controversial in Air Force history and has been the subject of much debate. Many Air Force senior officers and senior enlisted personnel, both active and retired from the Regular Air Force, the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard, have accused him of trying to run the Air Force as a corporation, with his introduction of Total Quality Management (TQM) under the moniker of &quot;Quality Air Force&quot; (QAF).

Rightly or wrongly, McPeak was also often accused of ignoring the needs of enlisted personnel, non-flying officers, aeronautically-rated navigator officers, and looking out solely for his officers who were pilots, primarily single-seat fighter pilots. There was even debate over the somewhat traditional act of inducting him as the outgoing Chief of Staff into the Order of the Sword.

Some of this controversy may also be traced, at least in part, to the abrupt manner in which McPeak had replaced General Michael Dugan as Chief of Staff of the Air Force. General Dugan, a popular and well-intentioned officer, had sought to repair the Air Force&#x27;s image, badly frayed by the service&#x27;s withholding of embarrassing information about the performance of the F-117 Nighthawk during the invasion of Panama. Dugan had also sought to make top Air Force officials more accessible, but he was relieved of command by then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney shortly before the start of Operation Desert Storm and the first Gulf War following some intemperate remarks Dugan had made to the news media about targeting Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein under United Nations Security Council Resolution 666 prior to the start of hostilities, this despite the fact that as Air Force Chief of Staff, Dugan had no command authority within the U.S. Central Command theater of operations. In short order, Cheney quickly replaced Dugan with McPeak as Chief of Staff, although Dugan was retained as a 4-star special advisor by the Secretary of Defense until his retirement from the Air Force.

==Later work==
Following his Air Force career, McPeak entered the private sector as a consultant and business executive. He has been on the boards of directors for TWA, ECC International, where he served for several years as Chairman, Tektronix, Sensis Corporation, Aerojet/Rocketdyne, Iovance Biotherapeutics and other corporations. He was a founding investor and for a decade Chairman of Ethicspoint, a Portland, Oregon-based software startup. When sold to private equity, it was perhaps Oregon&#x27;s most successful startup in recent years. McPeak and his wife Elynor currently reside in Portland, Oregon. Ellie served for nine years as a member of the Lake Oswego City Council.

McPeak was appointed in July 2010 to the American Battle Monuments Commission. He was the tenth Chairman (and the first airman) to lead the commission. In 2018, the government of France decorated McPeak (Legion of Honor, Officer class) in connection with his prior service as U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff and in recognition of his Chairmanship of the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC). His leadership was essential in the restoration of the Lafayette Escadrille Memorial, outside Paris. The monument had fallen into disrepair, but has now been renovated and has become an ABMC property, ensuring its future maintenance. McPeak was a technical advisor to Ken Burns and Lynn Novick in their award-winning documentary, “The Vietnam War”. He appeared on-screen in 4 of the 10 episodes.

In 1992, San Diego State University gave its first ever Lifetime Achievement Award to General McPeak. In 1995, George Washington University honored him with its Distinguished Alumni Award, the &quot;George.&quot; In 2005, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the founding of Sigma Chi Fraternity, he was selected as one of 150 members of its Hall of Fame. He was among the initial seven inductees to the Oregon Aviation Hall of Honor.

In May 2012, McPeak published &quot;Hangar Flying&quot;, the first volume of The Aerial View Trilogy, three memoirs that document his career in the Air Force. The book was followed by Volume 2, &quot;Below the Zone&quot;, in November 2013, and Volume 3, &quot;Roles and Missions&quot;, in January 2017.

===Israel===
McPeak was harshly criticized by &quot;American Spectator&quot; journalist Robert Goldberg for comments and writings he has made regarding Israel.

Goldberg begins the piece saying that &quot;McPeak has a long history of criticizing Israel for not going back to the 1967 borders as part of any peace agreement with Arab states. In 1976 McPeak wrote an article for &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; magazine questioning Israel&#x27;s insistence on holding on to the Golan Heights and parts of the West Bank.&quot;

Goldberg writes that &quot;[in] recent years McPeak has echoed the Mearsheimer-Walt view that American Middle East policy is being controlled by Jews at the expense of America&#x27;s interests in the region.&quot; Goldberg then quotes McPeak responding to a question as to what is the cause for the lack of progress in getting Israelis and Palestinians together: &quot;New York City. Miami. We have a large vote – vote, here in favor of Israel. And no politician wants to run against it.&quot;

Goldberg also wrote that McPeak &quot;claims that a combination of Jews and Christian Zionists are manipulating U.S. policy in Iraq in dangerous and radical ways.&quot;To support this claim, Goldberg quotes McPeak from a published interview: &quot;Let&#x27;s say that one of your abiding concerns is the security of Israel as opposed to a purely American self-interest, then it would make sense to build a dozen or so bases in Iraq. Let&#x27;s say you are a born-again Christian and you think that Armageddon and the rapture are about to happen any minute and what you want to do is retrace steps you think are laid out in Revelations, then it makes sense. So there are a number of scenarios here that could lead you in this direction. This is radical...&quot;

====McPeak&#x27;s response====
:More than 30 years ago, ... I wrote, and Foreign Affairs published, an article now being circulated in the blogosphere as evidence of an alleged anti-Israel point of view. Some commentators reach farther, suggesting that since I have been an active supporter of Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential bid he, too, is anti-Israel. Both these assertions fall flat after any objective reading of the historical record.

:I am a long-time admirer (and think myself a friend) of Israel. In the early 1970s, I played a key role in getting advanced weaponry released to the Israeli Air Force – capabilities it later put to active use. During that period, I made many official visits to Israel and established close relationships there. These contacts turned out to be useful during Operation Desert Storm, when, as chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, I worked with my Israeli counterparts to help defend Israel from Iraqi Scud missile attacks.

:I was a vocal opponent of the George W. Bush Administration&#x27;s decision to invade Iraq, a strategic blunder made worse by slapdash execution. As we have seen, this star-crossed action took our eye off the ball in Afghanistan, breathed new life into a moribund al Qaeda, and enhanced Iranian influence in this critical region – all outcomes which damaged both the United States and our ally Israel.

:It is my view and hope that Israel will have our continued support. I wish it every success. Of course, what Israel regards as success is up to it to decide. But for friends like me, &quot;success&quot; means a secure Israel at peace with neighbors who recognize and respect its existence. Even so, we should maintain our special relationship and help Israel keep its qualitative military edge.

:As for the article, much has changed in 32 years and much has not. The essential argument holds: no set of realistically achievable geographic borders produces safety for Israel. Rather, the security requirement is that any of the territory taken in the Six-Day War and given back as part of a peace settlement should be effectively demilitarized. Of course, the Sinai Peninsula was returned to Egypt long ago in exactly this way, resulting in relative quiet along Israel&#x27;s southern border and creating a fundamental shift in the regional balance of forces. This opportunity was not skillfully exploited, so the result has been a &quot;cold peace.&quot; But it is nevertheless peace and has served the interests of both sides.

===Political activities===
In 1996, McPeak served as Oregon state chairman for the Bob Dole for president campaign. During the presidential election of 2000 McPeak endorsed George W. Bush and served as co-chairman of Oregon Veterans for Bush. As the military and foreign policy of the Bush administration coalesced, however, McPeak expressed strong objections, especially with regard to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. McPeak later openly campaigned for Howard Dean&#x27;s nomination, and when Dean withdrew, acted as an adviser for the John Kerry campaign. He was also one of twenty-seven signatories to the statement of the &quot;Committee of Diplomats &amp; Commanders for Change&quot; calling the Bush Administration a failure at &quot;preserving national security&quot; and calling for Bush not to be re-elected.

McPeak was a co-chair of Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign. He generated controversy following comments he made at a campaign appearance in Medford, Oregon where he implied that former President Bill Clinton had appeared to question Obama&#x27;s patriotism: &quot;As one who for 37 years proudly wore the uniform of our country, I&#x27;m saddened to see a president employ these tactics. He of all people should know better because he was the target of exactly the same kind of tactics.&quot; McPeak also compared the former President&#x27;s comments to McCarthyism: &quot;I grew up, I was going to college when Joe McCarthy was accusing good Americans of being traitors, so I&#x27;ve had enough of it.&quot;

===East Timor===
According to journalist Allan Nairn, General McPeak oversaw the delivery of advanced U.S. fighter planes to Suharto&#x27;s government not long after the November 1991 shooting of pro-independence demonstrators known as the Dili massacre.

<text>The Tsyklon (, &quot;Cyclone&quot;, also known as Tsiklon), GRAU index 11K67, was a Soviet-designed expendable launch system, primarily used to put Kosmos satellites into low Earth orbit in the late-1960s. It is based on the R-36 intercontinental ballistic missile designed by Mikhail Yangel and made eight launches, with seven successes and one failure. All of its launches were conducted from LC-90 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. It is sometimes designated Tsyklon-2A, not to be confused with the later Tsyklon-2 rocket. It was introduced in 1967 and was derived from the R-36 ICBM (NATO designation SS-9 Scarp). It was retired in 1969.

It made its maiden flight on 27 October 1967. The booster&#x27;s design was kept secret and no images or film clips of the complete vehicle were released to the public until after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in part because of being used exclusively for military payloads and also because it was derived from an actively serving missile system. After 1991, the plant where the R-36/Tsyklon were manufactured ended up in newly independent Ukraine.

Tsyklon was designed by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau and manufactured by Yuzhmash (both in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine). Control system was designed at NPO &quot;Electropribor&quot; (Kharkiv, Ukraine). The last flown derivative, the Tsyklon-3 was retired in January 2009. Another derivative, the Tsyklon-4, continued to be developed after the retirement of Tsyklon-3, but the Tsyklon-4 project was cancelled in 2015 due to financial concerns. Tsyklon-4 never reached launch pad. However, yet another derivative, the Cyclone-4M, a development of Tsyklon-4, continued to be developed and is still currently (2021) under development.

==Derivatives==

Two rockets were derived from the Tsyklon: the Tsyklon-2 and Tsyklon-3, known respectively as the SL-11 and SL-14 by the United States DoD.

===Tsyklon-2===

The two stage Tsyklon-2 was first launched 6 August 1977 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The Tsyklon-2 was long with a fueled mass of 182 tonnes. The Tsyklon-2 made its final flight in 2006.

===Tsyklon-3===

The Tsyklon-3, which featured a restartable third stage, first launched on 24 June 1977 from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The Tsyklon-3 is long with a fueled mass of 186 to 190 tonnes. It was partially the result of an effort to reduce the number of Soviet launch vehicles in use, replacing the small R-12 derived Kosmos booster and some R-7 variants.

On 27 December 2000, a Tsyklon-3 failed in its attempt to carry six Russian satellites into orbit, plummeting to the earth. An electrical failure in the rocket&#x27;s third stage was the suspected cause.

The Tsyklon-3 was retired after launching the Koronas-Foton satellite on 30 January 2009.

===Tsyklon-4===

The Tsyklon-4 was under development as an evolution of the Tsyklon-3, but was eventually abandoned due to economic and market concerns. A derivative, the Cyclone-4M, is under development for Canadian service provider Maritime Launch Services; however the Cyclone-4M does not share any booster stage derived from the original Tsyklon series.

<doc id="739735" wikidata="Q3269882" url="?curid=739735" title="USS Razorback">
<text>USS &quot;Razorback&quot; (SS-394), a , was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named after the razorback, a species of whale (&quot;Balaenoptera physalus&quot;) found in the far southern reaches of the Pacific Ocean. She is arguably the longest-serving combat front-line submarine still existing in the world, having been commissioned by two different countries for 56 years of active duty. She was in Tokyo Bay during the surrender of Japan. In 2004, the state of Arkansas adopted the submarine (although she was not named after the University of Arkansas Razorbacks mascot) and she is now a museum ship at the Arkansas Inland Maritime Museum.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Razorback&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine on 9 September 1943. She was launched, sponsored by Hazel DuMont (Grant) Davis, wife of Captain H.F.D. Davis, manager of the Portland Navy Yard from June 1940 to June 1944, on 27 January 1944 along with and . was launched a few hours later, making 27 January 1944 the only time the U.S. Navy has launched four submarines at one shipyard in a single day. &quot;Razorback&quot; was commissioned on 3 April 1944, Lt. Comdr. A.M. Bontier, commanding.

==Service history==
===U.S. Navy===
==== World War II ====

During shakedown exercises off New London, Connecticut in late April 1944, &quot;Razorback&quot; ran aground on Race Point Ledge between Fisher Island&#x27;s Race Point and Race Rock in Block Island Sound. A board of inquiry removed the captain and replaced him with Commander Roy S. Benson. The executive officer, Lt. Commander Haynes was also replaced, by Lt Commander C. Donald Brown.

After shakedown off New England, &quot;Razorback&quot; proceeded to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Her first war patrol, commencing 25 August, was conducted east of Luzon as a member of an offensive group in support of the mid-September Palau landings. After sighting only enemy antisubmarine planes, she headed northeastward, arriving at Midway Island on 19 October.

On 15 November &quot;Razorback&quot; sailed from Midway Island on her second war patrol in company with and . Operating with these submarines in the Luzon Straits, &quot;Razorback&quot; damaged 6933 ton freighter &quot;Kenjo Maru&quot; on 6 December and sank the old 820 ton destroyer Kuretake and damaged another freighter on 30 December. She arrived at Guam for refit on 5 January 1945.

On 1 February &quot;Razorback&quot; set out for the East China Sea for her third war patrol, this time accompanied by &quot;Segundo&quot; and . After sinking four wooden ships in three separate surface gun actions, she deposited three Japanese prisoners at Guam before terminating her patrol at Pearl Harbor on 26 March 1945.

On 7 May &quot;Razorback&quot; headed west again. Assigned to lifeguard duty in the Nanpō Islands and Tokyo Bay areas, she rescued Lieutenant Colonel Charles E. Taylor, a P-51 fighter pilot from the 21st Fighter Group on 25 May. On 5 June she rescued four B-29 Superfortress crewmen shot down during an air raid over Kobe, Japan. &quot;Razorback&quot; retired to Midway Island to end that patrol and refit on 27 June.

On 22 July &quot;Razorback&quot; departed Midway Island for patrol in the Okhotsk Sea, where she sank six wooden cargo sea trucks (i.e., small Imperial Japanese Navy ship types used for frontline logistics) and damaged two in a surface gun action. The remainder of the patrol was spent performing lifeguard services off Paramushiro for Alaska-based planes. On 31 August &quot;Razorback&quot; entered Tokyo Bay with 11 other submarines to take part in the formal Japanese surrender. She departed 3 September, arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on 11 September and San Diego, California on 20 September.

==== 1945–1954 ====

After the war she remained active with the Pacific Fleet serving off Japan and China in early 1948 and again in late 1949. She won the Navy &quot;E&quot; for overall excellence in 1949. In August 1952 she decommissioned incident to conversion to a GUPPY IIA-type submarine. She recommissioned in January 1954 and reported to Submarine Squadron 10 at New London, Connecticut, for shakedown and training.

==== 1954–1970 ====

Following shakedown &quot;Razorback&quot; was transferred to the United States West Coast and on 24 May 1954 became a unit of Submarine Squadron 3, based at Naval Station San Diego in San Diego, California. The remainder of 1954 and 1955 were spent providing antisubmarine training services for local surface and air units. In 1956 her range of operations was extended north to Canada and on 24 June 1957 she got underway for an extended Far East patrol that included extensive surveillance of the Russian port of Petropavlovsk. She won a second Battle &quot;E&quot; in 1959.

 On 11 May 1962, &quot;Razorback&quot; participated in the &quot;SWORDFISH&quot; nuclear weapons test, a test of the ASROC (Anti-Submarine Rocket). An ASROC with a 10-kiloton, W44 nuclear depth charge warhead was fired by the destroyer at a target raft from a range of . &quot;Razorback&quot; was submerged at periscope depth approximately from the target raft. The explosion produced an underwater shock wave that shook &quot;Razorback&quot;. A video of this test is available from the Department of Energy.

Regularly deployed to the Seventh Fleet into the sixties &quot;Razorback&quot; sailed into the South China Sea on her 1965 deployment where she earned her first Vietnam Service Medal. She returned to San Diego on 1 February 1966, but was in the western Pacific from 29 December 1966 to 3 July 1967 and from 6 August 1968 to February 1969. During 1969 she continued to operate on the west coast out of San Diego, winning her third Battle &quot;E&quot; on 2 July 1969. &quot;Razorback&quot;″s last deployment, again to the western Pacific, was from 30 January to 7 August 1970. During a stopover in Guam, scenes for the film &quot;Noon Sunday&quot; were shot aboard the boat. Not long after her return to the West Coast, she was decommissioned at Hunter&#x27;s Point Naval Shipyard. Concurrent with her decommissioning on 30 November, &quot;Razorback&quot; was transferred to the Turkish Navy.

In her 26 years of service in the U.S. Navy &quot;Razorback&quot; earned five battle stars for World War II service, four campaign stars for Vietnam War service and two awards of the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal.

=== TCG &quot;Muratreis&quot; (S-336) ===

The submarine was recommissioned TCG &quot;Muratreis&quot; (S-336) on 17 December 1971, named after the great Ottoman admiral Murat Reis and served Turkey for 31 years, decommissioning on 8 August 2001.

== After decommissioning ==
The city of North Little Rock, Arkansas purchased ex-&quot;Muratreis&quot; from Turkey on 25 March 2004 for US$37,500. Private donations provided the funds for the purchase and all towing costs.

The submarine departed Turkey under tow on 5 May 2004, crossed the Mediterranean Sea to Gibraltar, and then was towed across the Atlantic Ocean, arriving at Key West, Florida, on the evening of 13 June 2004. On 14 June 2004, she again was taken under tow, and she arrived in New Orleans, Louisiana, on 19 June 2004. From there she was towed up the Mississippi River and the Arkansas River to her permanent berth in North Little Rock.

After a stopover for the dedication of the Montgomery Point Lock and Dam on 16 July, her transit was delayed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers over safety concerns. At the time of transit, she was drafting at her bow and at nearly at her stern, while some portions of the Arkansas River were less than deep. A pair of barges were used as pontoons to lift the submarine a few feet to clear the river bottom while remaining low enough to pass under the bridges along her route, just as the submarine had 32 years earlier.

On 29 August 2004, &quot;Razorback&quot; reached her berth in North Little Rock, at the Arkansas Inland Maritime Museum. She officially opened to the public on 15 May 2005.

&quot;Razorback&quot; was also the meeting place the Quapaw Area Council Sea Scout ship number 394. Sea Scout Ship 394, as part of the Venturing program, had a particular emphasis on water-based activities. The Sea Scout Ship dissolved after only a few years of being chartered.

&quot;Razorback&quot; is the subject of a full-length documentary film, &quot;Greyhound of the Sea: USS Razorback,&quot; slated for release in 2016. The film is a joint effort between the Arkansas Inland Maritime Museum and the University of Arkansas at Little Rock School of Mass Communication.
&quot;Razorback&quot; shares her shoreline with memorials to the submarines and .

Visitors to the Arkansas Inland Maritime Museum can tour the submarine most Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

==In Pop Culture==
The &quot;USS Razorback&quot; is featured in the fictional book &quot;SSN Seadragon The Crucible of Leviathan&quot; by J.P. Ronald. 

&quot;Razorback&quot; already converted to GUPPY IIA reconnoiters the beaches off Inchon, and lands a covert CIA/Underwater Demolition Team operative to collect vital intelligence in the weeks leading up to the famous Inchon landings of 1950.

<doc id="739751" wikidata="Q309872" url="?curid=739751" title="Gary Payton">
<text>Gary Dwayne Payton Sr. (born July 23, 1968) is an American former professional basketball player who was a point guard in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely considered one of the greatest point guards of all time, he is best known for his 13-year tenure with the Seattle SuperSonics, where he holds franchise records in assists and steals and led them to an NBA Finals appearance. He also played with the Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics, and Miami Heat. Payton won an NBA championship with the Heat in 2006. Nicknamed &quot;the Glove&quot; for his defensive abilities, Payton was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013. In October 2021, Payton was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.

Payton is the first point guard to win the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award, and the only point guard winner in the award&#x27;s first 39 years, until Marcus Smart was selected in 2022. He was selected to the NBA All-Defensive First Team nine times, an NBA record he shares with Michael Jordan, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant. He was also a nine-time NBA All-Star and a nine-time All-NBA Team member. Payton was called &quot;probably as complete a guard as there ever was&quot; by Basketball Hall of Famer Gail Goodrich.

==Early life==
Gary Dwayne Payton was born on July 23, 1968, in Oakland, California. He attended Skyline High School, where he excelled in basketball along with former NBA player Greg Foster.

==College career==
Payton attended Oregon State University in Corvallis. At one point, he wanted to attend The University of Texas at El Paso, but Don Haskins later rescinded his offer after Payton was deciding between UTEP and St. John&#x27;s. In his sophomore year of high school, his grades plummeted and he was declared academically ineligible. His father encouraged him to focus on school, and he was allowed to play again. Throughout his four-year career at Oregon State, he became one of the most decorated basketball players in school history.

During his senior season in 1989–90, Payton was featured in the cover story of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; on March 5 as the nation&#x27;s best college basketball player. He was a consensus All-American, a three-time All-Pac-10 selection, and both the Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year and conference Freshman of the Year in 1987. He was the MVP of the Far West Classic tournament three times, the Pac-10 Player of the Week nine times, and named to the Pac-10&#x27;s All-Decade Team. At the time of his graduation, Payton held the school record for points, field goals, three-point field goals, assists, and steals – all of which he still holds today except for career points and three-point field goals. During his career at OSU, the Beavers made three NCAA tournament appearances and one NIT appearance. He was elected into OSU&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1996.

==Professional career==
===Seattle SuperSonics (1990–2003)===
Payton was the second overall pick in the 1990 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics. In his third career game, Payton recorded his first double-double after recording 13 points and 10 assists in a road win over the Nuggets. On February 23, 1991, Payton recorded his first career triple-double after recording 18 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists in a losing effort to the Suns. The following game, Payton scored only 2 points but dished out 16 assists, a then career-high for him. He joined Slick Watts and Nate McMillan as the only SuperSonics&#x27; players to have dished out 16 or more assists in his rookie season. Throughout his rookie campaign, Payton recorded 8 point-assist double-doubles, the most by any SuperSonics&#x27; player in history. His average for his rookie season is 7.2 points per game, 3.0 rebounds per game, 6.4 assists per game, and 2.0 steals per game.

In his second season, Payton recorded 2 triple-doubles on the whole season joining Slick Watts and Nate McMillan at that time to have recorded 2 triple-doubles in a season in Supersonics franchise history. He scored a season-high 22 points to go along with 7 assists in a road win over the Bullets on November 19, 1991. His season average is 9.4 points per game, 3.6 rebounds per game, 6.2 assists per game, 1.8 steals per game, and 0.3 blocks per game.

Payton spent his first 12½ seasons with the Sonics. Entering the league to star-studded expectations, Payton struggled during his first two seasons in the league, averaging 8.2 points per game during that span. However, he soon proved himself to be one of the league&#x27;s top point guards, while, during the 1990s Payton, alongside Shawn Kemp formed the &quot;Sonic Boom&quot;. He earned his first of 9 consecutive All-NBA team selections when he was chosen to the All-NBA Third team in 1994. Payton would go on to make the All-NBA First-Team in 1998 and 2000, All-NBA Second Team in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2002, and All-NBA Third Team in 1994 and 2001. He was selected to the NBA All-Defensive First Team a record nine consecutive seasons (1994–2002), and won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1996, the first point guard to win the award. He has been selected to the NBA All-Star Team nine times and was voted as a starter in 1997 and 1998. He was a member of the gold medal-winning 1996 and 2000 U.S. Men&#x27;s Olympic Basketball Teams. In 1996, Payton and the SuperSonics, under coach George Karl, reached the NBA Finals after winning a franchise record 64 games and lost in six games to Michael Jordan&#x27;s Chicago Bulls.

In 2001, the SuperSonics were bought by Howard Schultz, with whom Payton had a sour relationship. When Payton did not attend the first day of training camp in 2002, Schultz insisted that Payton be traded.

===Milwaukee Bucks (2003)===
In the middle of the 2002–03 season at the trade deadline, Payton was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks along with Desmond Mason in exchange for Ray Allen, Kevin Ollie, Ronald Murray and 2003 first-round draft pick. Payton played the remaining 28 games with the Bucks, averaging 19.6 points and 7.4 assists per game. The Bucks faced the defending Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Nets in the first round of the playoffs, pushing the Nets to six games before losing to the more experienced and well rounded Nets. Payton led the Bucks in scoring (18.5) and assists (8.7) during the series, which included a 20-point, 14-assist performance in a Game 4 Milwaukee win.

===Los Angeles Lakers (2003–2004)===

As an unrestricted free agent prior to the 2003–04 season, Payton, along with Karl Malone, signed with the Los Angeles Lakers to make a run at their first NBA Championship. Payton started in all 82 games and averaged 14.6 points with 5.5 assists and 1.2 steals, but struggled with Lakers coach Phil Jackson&#x27;s triangle offense, which limited his ball-handling and post-up opportunities. Payton provided offense in games where superstar teammates Shaquille O&#x27;Neal or Kobe Bryant could not play due to injury, including a 30-point outburst in an overtime win against the Cleveland Cavaliers on February 4.

Despite injuries to Malone, O&#x27;Neal and Bryant throughout the season, the Lakers won 56 games and the Pacific Division. In the playoffs, Payton averaged just 7.8 points per game, but scored 15 points in Games 3 and 6 of the Lakers&#x27; semifinals series against the San Antonio Spurs, and scored 18 points to go with nine assists in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Lakers would reach the NBA Finals before falling to the Detroit Pistons in five games.

===Boston Celtics (2004–2005)===
Prior to the 2004–05 season, the Lakers traded Payton and Rick Fox to the Boston Celtics for center Chris Mihm, small forward Jumaine Jones and point guard Chucky Atkins. While Payton expressed displeasure with the trade, he ultimately did report to Boston and began the 2004–05 season as the Celtics&#x27; starting point guard. On February 24, 2005, Payton was traded to the Atlanta Hawks in a deal that brought former Celtic Antoine Walker back to Boston. The Hawks then waived Payton immediately following the trade, and he returned a week later to Boston as a free agent. Payton started all 77 games he played for Boston and averaged 11.3 points per game and 6.1 assists as the Celtics won the Atlantic Division before losing in the first round to the Indiana Pacers.

===Miami Heat (2005–2007)===
On September 22, 2005, he signed a one-year $1.1 million contract with Miami, reuniting with Walker (who was acquired seven weeks earlier by the Heat), as well as former Lakers&#x27; teammate Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. Serving as a backup to Jason Williams, Payton averaged 7.7 points and started 25 of 81 games. In the playoffs, Payton did not start but averaged 24.3 minutes a game after averaging 28.5 minutes during the regular season, often playing during pressure situations in the 4th quarter of games. In Game 4 of the semifinals against the New Jersey Nets, Payton hit a critical three-pointer with 56 seconds left in the game to clinch the Heat victory. In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals on the road against the Detroit Pistons, Payton scored 14 points on 6-of-8 shooting, helping the Heat set the tone in the series. Miami won the series in 6 games to reach the team&#x27;s first ever Finals against the Dallas Mavericks. Miami lost the first two games in Dallas and trailed in the final quarter of Game 3 before a comeback led by Dwyane Wade culminated with a Jason Williams pass to Payton, who faked his defender and hit the game-winning jump shot to keep Miami from falling 3–0 in the series. In Game 5, Payton scored 8 points, including Miami&#x27;s final field goal with 29 seconds left, to help clinch a one-point victory. The Heat returned to Dallas for Game 6 and won 95–92, securing their first and Payton&#x27;s only NBA title.

On September 6, 2006, the 38-year-old Payton re-signed with the defending champion Miami Heat on a one-year, $1.2 million contract. During the subsequent 2006–07 NBA season, Payton continued to climb up several NBA all-time lists: he moved from 17th to 8th in all-time NBA games played, passed John Havlicek and Robert Parish to move into 7th in all-time minutes played, and passed Hal Greer and Larry Bird to become the 21st-highest scorer in NBA history.

Payton is well known for his trash-talk. He received the fourth-most technical fouls of all time (behind Karl Malone, Charles Barkley, and Rasheed Wallace) with 250. Of his trash talking, Payton has stated &quot;I never take it too far...I just try to talk and get their mind off the game, and turn their attention on me&quot;, adding that &quot;sometimes I get accused of trash talking even though I&#x27;m not...[referees and spectators] immediately figure you&#x27;re trash talking. But I could be talking to a guy about what&#x27;s going on or asking about his family.&quot;

In addition, All-Star point guard Jason Kidd has referred to Payton as a &quot;mentor&quot; for the way he treated Kidd growing up in the same neighborhood of Oakland.

In 2001, he gave a humorous, televised &quot;motivational speech&quot; to his team during the NBA All-Star Game.

===Playing style===
Payton&#x27;s nickname of &quot;The Glove&quot; in reference to his defensive skills was popularized during the 1993 Western Conference Finals series against Phoenix.

Since Payton&#x27;s career ended in 2007, he has been mentioned among the all-time greatest point guards. Gail Goodrich, who played with Hall of Fame guard Jerry West, said &quot;Gary Payton is probably as complete a guard as there ever was.&quot; Kevin Johnson considers Payton &quot;certainly...amongst the best ever&quot; and &quot;just as intimidating...maybe even more so than all-time greats Magic Johnson, Isiah Thomas, Tiny Archibald, and Maurice Cheeks.&quot; When asked to classify the best players in each position of the late 1990s and early 21st century, NBA coach George Karl said of Payton, &quot;I don&#x27;t know who else you&#x27;d take at point guard. Some say Jason Kidd. Well, every time Gary went nose-to-nose with Kidd, Gary won that matchup.&quot;

Payton is ranked 35th all-time in points scored, and 11th in assists, but he is most widely recognized for his defensive contributions. &quot;The Sporting News&quot; said in 2000 that Payton was &quot;building a case as the best two-way point guard in history&quot;, and asked &quot;If you weigh offense and defense equally, is Payton the best ever?&quot;
When comparing Payton to the all-time greats, it has been said that &quot;Payton arguably is the best defender of them all, and his offensive game is better than most.&quot;

His defensive prowess was once described by Kevin Johnson:&quot;You think of guys with great hands, like Maurice Cheeks and Derek Harper. Gary is like that. But he&#x27;s also a great individual defender and a great team defender. He has all three components covered. That&#x27;s very rare.&quot;

Offensively, Payton was not a particularly strong shooter, but was much more physical than most point guards of his era, preferring to use his body frame and strength to shield defenders on his way to the basket or posting up his opponent in an isolation play. Nonetheless, in his prime, Payton was the &quot;NBA&#x27;s reigning high scorer among point guards.&quot;

He was the only guard to have won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award since Michael Jordan in 1988, until Marcus Smart received the award in 2022. Also, he, Jordan, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant share the record for most career NBA All-Defensive First Team selections, with nine. He is currently fifth all-time in career steals. Payton also ranks fifth all-time among guards in defensive rebounds though not alone, 12th in offensive rebounds, and 10th in total rebounds for a guard. Among players considered point guards, Payton ranks 3rd in defensive rebounds, 5th in offensive rebounds, and 4th in total rebounds, behind Jason Kidd, Oscar Robertson, and Magic Johnson. In 2021, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Payton as the 48th greatest player in NBA history.

In 2006, he was referred to as &quot;obviously...one of the greatest clutch shooters of our time&quot;.

===Payton vs. Jordan===
Payton is also considered one of the best defensive opponents of Michael Jordan, and the two players had a high-profile rivalry that culminated in the 1996 NBA Finals. Jordan and Payton have both won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award and despite their different positions (shooting guard and point guard respectively), they were well matched for other reasons. Both were prodigious &quot;trash talkers&quot; (Larry Johnson once named Payton, Jordan and himself the best three trash talkers in the league), had legendary competitiveness, and as the 1997 &quot;NBA Preview&quot; magazine stated, &quot;Payton [was] quick, and strong as an ox&quot;, making him the kind of player who could frustrate Jordan defensively.

Midway through the 1996 NBA Finals, Seattle coach George Karl decided to assign Payton to defend Jordan, instead of his normal role defending the Bulls&#x27; point guards. Though the Bulls won the series, Seattle&#x27;s (and especially Payton&#x27;s) defense held Jordan and the Bulls to their lowest offensive output in an NBA finals and &quot;frustrated the best player in the game.&quot; In a Game 5 preview after Payton had held Jordan to a career NBA Finals low of 23, an NBA pregame show described the rivalry of two strong defensive players renowned for their competitiveness. &quot;[In Game 4, Jordan had his] lowest output in a Finals game, much of it with Payton guarding him. Though afterwards, Jordan refused to give Payton credit, saying &#x27;No one can stop me, I can only stop myself. I missed some easy shots.&#x27; The truth is, Jordan finds the NBA&#x27;s Defensive Player of the Year [Payton] annoying. He views the [young Payton] as impudent, and he would love to have a big game at [Payton&#x27;s] expense.&quot; (NBA on NBC Preview, Game 5) The Sonics won that game by 21 points and Payton held Jordan to 26 points – Jordan&#x27;s second-lowest-scoring Finals game in his career up to that point. In Game 6, which the Bulls won to capture the Championship, Payton played 47 minutes and Jordan missed 14 of his 19 shots, getting a career Finals low 22 points. Bill Walton, commentating for NBC at the time, said Payton &quot;outplayed&quot; Jordan during the second half of the series, and that Seattle coach George Karl would &quot;rue&quot; the decision to &quot;hide [Payton] from &#x27;the king&#x27;&quot; in the early games of the series.

Later, of his performance that series, Payton said &quot;You&#x27;ve got to get back at Jordan, you can&#x27;t back down on him. If you do, he&#x27;s like a wolf, he&#x27;s going to eat everything. He knew I wasn&#x27;t going to back down. I had to realize or see if he is really about being a dog, about this neighborhood stuff. I went at him. It was just me being me.&quot;

===Durability ===
In his 17-year career, Payton missed only 25 games, and at one point held the longest active streak for consecutive games played, with 356; the streak ended in January 2001. &quot;The Sporting News&quot; noted in a 2000 article, &quot;Durability always has been one of Payton&#x27;s strong suits. He has missed only two games in 10 seasons and is generally counted on for nearly a full game&#x27;s worth of nonstop motion, despite chronic back pain that requires extensive stretching and regular applications of heating packs.&quot;

==Coaching career==
Payton was the head coach at Lincoln University in Oakland for three seasons before becoming the head coach of the nearby College of Alameda men&#x27;s team in 2024.

==Off the court==
===Personal life===
Payton is the son of Al and Annie Payton. He married Monique James on July 26, 1997. They lived in Oakland and Las Vegas and have three children: Gary II, Julian, and Raquel. Gary II has played for the Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Lakers, Washington Wizards, Portland Trail Blazers, and the Golden State Warriors, where he won the NBA Championship. Payton also has another son named Gary Payton Jr. with a different mother. His brother, Brandon, was also a professional basketball player during the 2000s.

Payton is cross-dominant: he was a natural left-handed player who shot with his right hand.

===Post-NBA career===
During the 2008–09 season, Payton served as a studio analyst for NBA TV and as an occasional substitute analyst on &quot;The NBA on TNT&quot;. He was replaced with Kevin McHale for the 2009–10 season. In 2013, Payton was named an analyst for Fox Sports 1&#x27;s &quot;Fox Sports Live&quot;. For the 2016 NFL season, Payton provided weekly picks for Sports Betting Dime.

===Movie and TV appearances===
Payton has appeared in &quot;Eddie&quot; (1996), &quot;Like Mike&quot; (2002), &quot;The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part&quot; (2019), and also performed a speaking role in the 1999 comedy film &quot;The Breaks&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;The Jamie Foxx Show&quot;.

Payton appeared on &quot;Onion SportsDome&quot;.

===Charity and community involvement===
Payton has made numerous well-regarded contributions of both time and money to the community. He set up &quot;The Gary Payton Foundation&quot; in 1996 to provide safe places for recreational activity, and to help underprivileged youth in his hometown of Oakland stay in school. He hosts an annual charity basketball game as part of his foundation. Payton also gave back to the East Oakland Youth Development Center (EOYDC), a youth center that he attended in Oakland when he was growing up. In 2001, Payton donated $100,000 to renovate EOYDC&#x27;s gym – his first big grant in his hometown of Oakland. Payton and his wife, Monique, have been active in fundraising endeavors for HIV awareness, and Payton has lent many hours and provided tremendous financial support to the Boys &amp; Girls Club of America and the Make-a-Wish Foundation. Payton has also donated Miami Heat tickets to underprivileged children. For the Christmas of 2003 he took 10 families from the Ronald McDonald House in Los Angeles and let each of the over 40 children have a $100 shopping spree at FAO Schwarz. For Christmas, 2005, he gave 60 children $100 Toys-R-Us shopping sprees as part of the Voices For Children program. In 1999, he wrote an autobiographical children&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Confidence Counts&quot; as part of the &quot;Positively for Kids&quot; series, illustrating the importance of confidence through events in his own life. In July 1999, Payton was named to The Sporting News&#x27; &quot;Good Guys in Sports&quot; list. Payton hosted a radio show in early 1998 on Seattle&#x27;s KUBE 93.3 station. He played hip-hop including The Roots, Raekwon, Outkast, and Cam&#x27;ron. He did it for charity during the NBA lockout. During the 2021 NHL Expansion Draft for the Seattle Kraken, he made an appearance alongside former teammate Shawn Kemp.

===Support of Seattle basketball===
Since the Sonics&#x27; move to Oklahoma City, Payton has openly expressed his desire not to have his retired jersey number in Oklahoma City as part of that team&#x27;s history. He wishes instead for it to remain in Seattle, where he enjoyed the majority of his career&#x27;s success and popularity. This seems likely as the SuperSonics&#x27; team name, colors, uniforms and trophies are remaining in Seattle for a possible future team to adopt upon arrival. Despite no official acknowledgement from the Thunder, they have not issued the number 20 to any player since their relocation.

Payton is featured in the documentary &quot;Sonicsgate&quot;, which covers the team&#x27;s relocation from Seattle to Oklahoma City. When Sonicsgate won a Webby Award for Best Sports Film, Payton gave the acceptance speech, which consisted solely of the five words &quot;Bring back our Seattle SuperSonics.&quot;

Payton is currently working on bringing the NBA back to Seattle, aligning himself with the Oak View Group.

<text>Vladimir Yakovlevich Propp (; – 22 August 1970) was a Soviet folklorist and scholar who analysed the basic structural elements of Russian folk tales to identify their simplest irreducible structural units.

== Biography ==
Vladimir Propp was born on 29 April 1895 in Saint Petersburg to an assimilated Russian family of German descent. His parents, Yakov Philippovich Propp and Anna-Elizaveta Fridrikhovna Propp (née Beisel), were Volga German wealthy peasants from Saratov Governorate. He attended Saint Petersburg University (1913–1918), majoring in Russian and German philology. Upon graduation he taught Russian and German at a secondary school and then became a college teacher of German.

His &quot;Morphology of the Folktale&quot; was published in Russian in 1928. Although it represented a breakthrough in both folkloristics and morphology and influenced Claude Lévi-Strauss and Roland Barthes, it was generally unnoticed in the West until it was translated in 1958. His morphology is used in media education and has been applied to other types of narrative, be it in literature, theatre, film, television series, games, etc., although Propp applied it specifically to the wonder or fairy tale.

In 1932, Propp became a member of Leningrad University (formerly St. Petersburg University) faculty. After 1938, he chaired the Department of Folklore until it became part of the Department of Russian Literature. Propp remained a faculty member until his death in 1970.

==Works in Russian==

His main books are:
*&quot;Morphology of the Folktale&quot;, Leningrad 1928
*&quot;Historical Roots of the wonder tale&quot;, Leningrad 1946
*&quot;Russian Epic Song&quot;, Leningrad 1955–1958
*&quot;Popular Lyric Songs&quot;, Leningrad 1961
*&quot;Russian Agrarian Feasts&quot;, Leningrad 1963

He also published some articles, the most important are:
*&quot;The Magical Tree on the tomb&quot;
*&quot;Wonderful Childbirth&quot;
*&quot;Ritual Laughter in folklore&quot;
*&quot;Oedipus in the light of folklore&quot;
First printed in specialized reviews, they were republished in &quot;Folklore and Reality&quot;, Leningrad 1976

Two books were published posthumously:
*&quot;Problems of comedy and laughter&quot;, Leningrad 1983
*&quot;The Russian Folktale&quot;, Leningrad 1984
The first book remained unfinished, the second one is the edition of the course he gave in Leningrad university.

==Translations into English and other languages==

*&quot;Morphology of the Folktale&quot; was translated into English in 1958 and 1968. It was also translated into Italian and Polish in 1966, French and Romanian in 1970, Spanish in 1971, German in 1972, Hungarian in 1975.
*&quot;Historical Roots of the Wonder Tale&quot; was translated into Italian in 1949 and 1972, Spanish in 1974, and French, Romanian and Japanese in 1983.
* &quot;Oedipus in the light of folklore&quot; was translated into Italian in 1975.
*&quot;Russian Agrarian Feasts&quot; was translated into French in 1987.

==Narrative structure==

According to Propp, based on his analysis of 100 folktales from the corpus of Alexander Fyodorovich Afanasyev, there were 31 basic structural elements (or &#x27;functions&#x27;) that typically occurred within Russian fairy tales. He identified these 31 functions as typical of all fairy tales, or wonder tales [skazka] in Russian folklore. These functions occurred in a specific, ascending order (1-31, although not inclusive of all functions within any tale) within each story. This type of structural analysis of folklore is referred to as &quot;syntagmatic&quot;. This focus on the events of a story and the order in which they occur is in contrast to another form of analysis, the &quot;paradigmatic&quot; which is more typical of Lévi-Strauss&#x27;s structuralist theory of mythology. Lévi-Strauss sought to uncover a narrative&#x27;s underlying pattern, regardless of the linear, superficial syntagm, and his structure is usually rendered as a binary oppositional structure. For paradigmatic analysis, the syntagm, or the linear structural arrangement of narratives is irrelevant to their underlying meaning.

===Functions===
After the initial situation is depicted, any wonder tale will be composed of a selection of the following 31 functions, in a fixed, consecutive order:

1. ABSENTATION: A member of the hero&#x27;s community or family leaves the security of the home environment. This may be the hero themself, or some other relation that the hero must later rescue. This division of the cohesive family injects initial tension into the storyline. This may serve as the hero&#x27;s introduction, typically portraying them as an ordinary person.

2. INTERDICTION: A forbidding edict or command is passed upon the hero (&#x27;don&#x27;t go there&#x27;, &#x27;don&#x27;t do this&#x27;). The hero is warned against some action.

3. VIOLATION of INTERDICTION. The prior rule is violated. Therefore, the hero did not listen to the command or forbidding edict. Whether committed by the Hero by accident or temper, a third party or a foe, this generally leads to negative consequences. The villain enters the story via this event, although not necessarily confronting the hero. They may be a lurking and manipulative presence, or might act against the hero&#x27;s family in his absence.

4. RECONNAISSANCE: The villain makes an effort to attain knowledge needed to fulfill their plot. Disguises are often invoked as the villain actively probes for information, perhaps for a valuable item or to abduct someone. They may speak with a family member who innocently divulges a crucial insight. The villain may also seek out the hero in their reconnaissance, perhaps to gauge their strengths in response to learning of their special nature.

5. DELIVERY: The villain succeeds at recon and gains a lead on their intended victim. A map is often involved in some level of the event.

6. TRICKERY: The villain attempts to deceive the victim to acquire something valuable. They press further, aiming to con the protagonists and earn their trust. Sometimes the villain makes little or no deception and instead ransoms one valuable thing for another.

7. COMPLICITY: The victim is fooled or forced to concede and unwittingly or unwillingly helps the villain, who is now free to access somewhere previously off-limits, like the privacy of the hero&#x27;s home or a treasure vault, acting without restraint in their ploy.

8. VILLAINY or LACKING: The villain harms a family member, including but not limited to abduction, theft, spoiling crops, plundering, banishment or expulsion of one or more protagonists, murder, threatening a forced marriage, inflicting nightly torments and so on. Simultaneously or alternatively, a protagonist finds they desire or require something lacking from the home environment (potion, artifact, etc.). The villain may still be indirectly involved, perhaps fooling the family member into believing they need such an item.

9. MEDIATION: One or more of the negative factors covered above comes to the attention of the Hero, who uncovers the deceit/perceives the lacking/learns of the villainous acts that have transpired.

10. BEGINNING COUNTERACTION: The hero considers ways to resolve the issues, by seeking a needed magical item, rescuing those who are captured or otherwise thwarting the villain. This is a defining moment for the hero, one that shapes their further actions and marks the point when they begin to fit their noble mantle.

11. DEPARTURE: The hero leaves the home environment, this time with a sense of purpose. Here begins their adventure.

12. FIRST FUNCTION OF THE DONOR: The hero encounters a magical agent or helper (donor) on their path, and is tested in some manner through interrogation, combat, puzzles or more.

13. HERO&#x27;S REACTION: The hero responds to the actions of their future donor; perhaps withstanding the rigours of a test and/or failing in some manner, freeing a captive, reconciles disputing parties or otherwise performing good services. This may also be the first time the hero comes to understand the villain&#x27;s skills and powers, and uses them for good.

14. RECEIPT OF A MAGICAL AGENT: The hero acquires use of a magical agent as a consequence of their good actions. This may be a directly acquired item, something located after navigating a tough environment, a good purchased or bartered with a hard-earned resource or fashioned from parts and ingredients prepared by the hero, spontaneously summoned from another world, a magical food that is consumed, or even the earned loyalty and aid of another.

15. GUIDANCE: The hero is transferred, delivered or somehow led to a vital location, perhaps related to one of the above functions such as the home of the donor or the location of the magical agent or its parts, or to the villain.

16. STRUGGLE: The hero and villain meet and engage in conflict directly, either in battle or some nature of contest.

17. BRANDING: The hero is marked in some manner, perhaps receiving a distinctive scar or granted a cosmetic item like a ring or scarf.

18. VICTORY: The villain is defeated by the hero – killed in combat, outperformed in a contest, struck when vulnerable, banished, and so on.

19. LIQUIDATION: The earlier misfortunes or issues of the story are resolved; objects of search are distributed, spells broken, captives freed.

20. RETURN: The hero travels back to their home.

21. PURSUIT: The hero is pursued by some threatening adversary, who perhaps seek to capture or eat them.

22. RESCUE: The hero is saved from a chase. Something may act as an obstacle to delay the pursuer, or the hero may find or be shown a way to hide, up to and including transformation unrecognisably. The hero&#x27;s life may be saved by another.

23. UNRECOGNIZED ARRIVAL: The hero arrives, whether in a location along their journey or in their destination, and is unrecognised or unacknowledged.

24. UNFOUNDED CLAIMS: A false hero presents unfounded claims or performs some other form of deceit. This may be the villain, one of the villain&#x27;s underlings or an unrelated party. It may even be some form of future donor for the hero, once they&#x27;ve faced their actions.

25. DIFFICULT TASK: A trial is proposed to the hero – riddles, test of strength or endurance, acrobatics and other ordeals.

26. SOLUTION: The hero accomplishes a difficult task.

27. RECOGNITION: The hero is given due recognition – usually by means of their prior branding.

28. EXPOSURE: The false hero and/or villain is exposed to all and sundry.

29. TRANSFIGURATION: The hero gains a new appearance. This may reflect aging and/or the benefits of labour and health, or it may constitute a magical remembering after a limb or digit was lost (as a part of the branding or from failing a trial). Regardless, it serves to improve their looks.

30. PUNISHMENT: The villain suffers the consequences of their actions, perhaps at the hands of the hero, the avenged victims, or as a direct result of their own ploy.

31. WEDDING: The hero marries and is rewarded or promoted by the family or community, typically ascending to a throne.

Some of these functions may be &quot;inverted&quot;, such as the hero receives an artifact of power whilst still at home, thus fulfilling the donor function early. Typically such functions are negated twice, so that it must be repeated three times in Western cultures.

===Characters===

He also concluded that all the characters in tales could be resolved into seven abstract character functions:

# The villain — an evil character that creates struggles for the hero.
# The dispatcher — any character who illustrates the need for the hero&#x27;s quest and sends the hero off. This often overlaps with the princess&#x27;s father.
# The helper — a typically magical entity that comes to help the hero in their quest.
# The princess or prize, and often her father — the hero deserves her throughout the story but is unable to marry her as a consequence of some evil or injustice, perhaps the work of the villain. The hero&#x27;s journey is often ended when he marries the princess, which constitutes the villain&#x27;s defeat.
# The donor — a character that prepares the hero or gives the hero some magical object, sometimes after testing them.
# The hero — the character who reacts to the dispatcher and donor characters, thwarts the villain, resolves any lacking or wronghoods and weds the princess.
# The false hero — a Miles Gloriosus figure who takes credit for the hero&#x27;s actions or tries to marry the princess.

These roles could sometimes be distributed among various characters, as the hero kills the villain dragon, and the dragon&#x27;s sisters take on the villainous role of chasing him. Conversely, one character could engage in acts as more than one role, as a father could send his son on the quest and give him a sword, acting as both dispatcher and donor.

==Criticism==
Propp&#x27;s approach has been criticized for its excessive formalism (a major critique of the Soviets). One of the most prominent critics of Propp was structuralist Claude Lévi-Strauss, who, in dialogue with Propp, argued for the superiority of the paradigmatic over syntagmatic approach. Propp responded to this criticism in a sharply-worded rebuttal: he wrote that Lévi-Strauss showed no interest in empirical investigation.

<text>The Lira system () is a two-way communication system used between the International Space Station and Mission Control via the Russian &quot;Luch&quot; relay satellite constellation including the four first generation &quot;Altair&quot; satellites and the second generation &quot;Gelios&quot; satellite.
The Russian Orbital Segment (ROS) communication Subsystems can receive commands directly from ground stations through the Regul Subsystem and can receive commands from the LUCH satellite through the Lira or the Regul System.

The Lira antenna and associated electronics were part of the Zvezda module which was launched in July 2000. Due to issues with the Luch satellite system communications from the Russian Orbital Segment was routed through a mix of direct connection to ground stations via the Regul system and the NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System. Additional Luch satellites were launched between 2011 and 2014 but the system was unable to reach full functionality until a spacewalk in February 2018 to replace electronics was completed.

<text>Allan Austin Lamport, (April 4, 1903 – November 18, 1999) was mayor of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from 1951 to 1954. Known as &quot;Lampy&quot;, his most notable achievement was his opposition to Toronto&#x27;s Blue laws which banned virtually any activities on Sundays. Lamport fought to allow professional sporting activities on Sundays. He won the 1954 election, but resigned after six months to become vice-chairman (later chairman) of the newly formed Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). Lamport later returned to City Council and made headlines for his opposition to Yorkville&#x27;s hippies in the late 1960s.

==Political life==
He first sat on Toronto City Council in 1937. A licensed pilot, he urged the city to build airports on Toronto Island and in Malton, Ontario. These projects were approved and became the Toronto Island Airport and what is now Pearson International Airport. He also advocated the construction of the Mount Pleasant Road extension connecting it to Jarvis Street in order to create a north–south alternative to Yonge Street.

From 1937 to 1943 he was an Ontario Liberal Party Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for the Toronto riding of St. David. He enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II and once rose in the legislature to denounce Henry Ford for his lack of support for the Canadian war effort, calling him a &quot;black-hearted American Quisling&quot;. As a result, he was transferred by the RCAF to the east coast and was unable to carry out his political duties contributing his electoral defeat in the 1943 provincial election. He returned to city council in 1946 and campaigned for the provincial government of George Drew to permit the opening of cocktail bars in Toronto. In 1947, the legislature approved the opening of bars in cities with more than 100,000 people. In 1949 he was elected to the Board of Control for the first time.

In 1950, Lamport spearheaded a municipal plebiscite that approved the playing of sports on Sundays. Until then, playing fields and even swings were padlocked under the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot;.
He was defeated in his first campaign for mayor in 1951 but won on his second attempt the next year. As mayor, Lamport encouraged the construction of Toronto&#x27;s subway system which would be Canada&#x27;s first when it opened in 1954. He also advocated the creation of Regent Park, Canada&#x27;s first large scale public housing project. Premier Leslie Frost considered Lamport for the position of Chairman of the newly created Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto but he was not interested. Lamport resigned as mayor in 1954 to serve on the Toronto Transit Commission first as vice-chairman and then as chairman from 1955 to 1959 and recommended and won approval for the construction of the Bloor-Danforth subway line. Following a political scandal over control of the TTC, he clashed with then Metro Chairman Fred Gardiner, and was nearly ousted from the TTC.

In 1960, he again ran for mayor but was defeated by Nathan Phillips; in 1962 he won election to the Board of Control. In 1964, he again ran for mayor and was defeated by Philip Givens. He returned to City Council again in 1966 as a Controller, and then as an alderman when the Board of Control was abolished. He famously opposed the hippies who populated the neighbourhood of Yorkville pledging to drive them out of Toronto and encouraging police action against them and urged that the neighbourhood be demolished and replaced by a shopping mall. He clashed with David DePoe, unofficial spokesperson for the Yorkville hippies opposing DePoe&#x27;s bid to address city council. The confrontation resulted in Lamport ordering police to remove the hippies from the city council chamber This conflict was documented in the National Film Board of Canada films &quot;Flowers on a One Way Street&quot; and &quot;Christopher&#x27;s Movie Matinée&quot;.

In 1994, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. Lamport Stadium in Toronto and the Allan A. Lamport Regatta Course on Toronto Island are named in his honour. His funeral was arranged through Ralph Day Funeral Home and services were held at St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church and he is buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto.

==Quotations==
Lamport was known as &quot;Metro&#x27;s Goldwyn Mayor&quot;, a take on movie mogul Sam Goldwyn because both of them were known for their malapropisms. He was quoted on many subjects. For example, on the subject of progress he said &quot;All this progress is marvellous... now if only it would stop.&quot; On the future, he said &quot;It&#x27;s hard to make predictions - especially about the future.&quot; On achieving the impossible, he said &quot;It&#x27;s like pushing a car uphill with a rope.&quot;

Some of his quotes were related to political life. On being Mayor of Toronto, he said &quot;Being Mayor of Toronto is like being a Prime Minister - without a cabinet or a majority.&quot; He once commented on Metro Chairman Fred Gardiner: &quot;Trailing Fred Gardiner is like tracking a bleeding elephant through a fresh fall of snow.&quot;

<text>James &quot;Blood&quot; Ulmer (born February 8, 1940) is an American jazz, free funk and blues guitarist and singer. Ulmer plays a Gibson Byrdland guitar. His guitar sound has been described as &quot;jagged&quot; and &quot;stinging&quot;. His singing has been called &quot;raggedly soulful&quot;.

==Biography==
Willie James Ulmer was born in St. Matthews, South Carolina, United States. He began his career playing with soul jazz ensembles, first in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from 1959 to 1964, and then in the Columbus, Ohio, area from 1964 to 1967. He recorded with organist Hank Marr in 1964 (released 1967). After moving to New York in 1971, Ulmer played with Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers, Joe Henderson, Paul Bley, Rashied Ali, and Larry Young.

In the early 1970s, Ulmer joined Ornette Coleman; he was the first electric guitarist to record and tour extensively with Coleman. He has credited Coleman as a major influence. Coleman&#x27;s reliance on electric guitar in his fusion-oriented recordings owes a debt to Ulmer.

His appearance on Arthur Blythe&#x27;s two consecutive Columbia albums, &quot;Lenox Avenue Breakdown&quot; (1979) and &quot;Illusions&quot; (1980), was followed by Ulmer&#x27;s signing to that label. That resulted in three albums: &quot;Free Lancing&quot;, &quot;Black Rock&quot;, and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, which was the inaugural release of Odyssey The Band with drummer Warren Benbow and violinist Charles Burnham. The trio was called &quot;avant-gutbucket&quot; by music critic Bill Milkowski to describe the music as &quot;conjuring images of Skip James and Albert Ayler jamming on the Mississippi Delta.&quot;

Ulmer formed Music Revelation Ensemble around 1980, co-led with David Murray for the first decade and lasting into the 1990s. Later versions of the band included Arthur Blythe, Sam Rivers, Pharoah Sanders, and John Zorn. In the 1980s he co-led the quartet Phalanx with saxophonist George Adams. Ulmer has recorded as a leader, including blues-oriented albums produced by Vernon Reid: &quot;Memphis Blood&quot;, &quot;No Escape from the Blues&quot;, &quot;Bad Blood in the City&quot;, and &quot;Birthright&quot;.

Ulmer was a judge for the 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent musicians.

In a 2005 &quot;DownBeat&quot; interview, he said guitar technique stagnated after the death of Jimi Hendrix. He stated technique could advance &quot;if the guitar would stop following the piano&quot; and indicated he tunes his guitar strings to A.

In 2009, Ulmer started the label American Revelation. In spring 2011, he joined James Carter&#x27;s organ trio as a special guest with Nicholas Payton on trumpet for a six-night stand of performances at Blue Note New York.

<text>The Luch (; lit. &quot;Ray&quot;) Satellite Data Relay Network (SDRN), also referred to as Altair and Gelios, is a series of geosynchronous Russian relay satellites, used to transmit live TV images, communications and other telemetry from the Soviet/Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot;, the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS) of the International Space Station and other orbital spacecraft to the Earth, in a manner similar to that of the US Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System.

== First generation ==

The first generation of satellites was created by NPO-PM using the satellite platform KAUR-4 (its first use) and had the code name &quot;Altair&quot; (index GUKOS - 11F669). The system was conceived as part of the second generation of the Global Satellite Data Relay Network (Глобальная Космическая Командно-Ретрансляционная система (GKKRS)) and was developed by decree of the Soviet Council of Ministers of February 17, 1976 (the other part of this decree authorized the construction of geostationary system &quot;Geyser&quot;). Five satellites have been built on this platform, but only four have been launched: Kosmos 1700, Kosmos 1897, Kosmos 2054 and &quot;Luch&quot;-1, none of which are currently operational. The fifth satellite has been, due to lack of funds for the launcher, donated to the A.S. Popov Central Museum of Communications in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

=== Platform design ===
Each satellite has a mass of 2.4 metric tons and featured two photovoltaic arrays, providing 1.8 kW of power. Three large antennas and numerous, small helical antennas permitted data relays in the 15/14, 15/11, and 0.9/0.7 GHz bands.

== Second generation ==
In the second generation of the satellites, code named &quot;Gelios&quot;, several improvements had been introduced, but due to lack of funds, only one satellite built on this platform has been launched: &quot;Luch&quot;-2 1 (Gelios-12L) on September 11, 1995 – it stopped working in 1998.

== Third generation - MKSR Luch Constellation ==

Originally, during 2009, the Russian Federal Space Agency signed a contract with JSC Information Satellite Systems (previously &quot;NPO-PM&quot;) for development of a new generation of satellites, &quot;Luch&quot;-4, &quot;Luch&quot;-5A and &quot;Luch&quot;-5B. It enabled the rebuild of the Luch network and provided the ROS with 45 minutes of coverage per orbit via the &quot;Lira&quot; and &quot;Regul&quot; communications systems. Luch-4 was based on the heavier Ekspress-2000 satellite platform, while the Luch-5A and Luch-5B was based on the lighter Ekspress-1000 and flew with companion satellites on Proton-M/Briz-M. That plan was suspended and the MKSR Luch Constellation was defined. It replaced the heavier and more expensive Luch-4 and added a twin of the Luch-5A, the &quot;Luch&quot;-5V. The three orbital position used by this system was 95° east over the Indian Ocean, 16° west, over the Atlantic Ocean and 167° east over the Pacific Ocean. The positions were assigned to the Luch-5V, Luch-5B and Luch-5A respectively.

Luch 5A arrived at Baikonur on November 10, 2011, and was launched on December 11, 2011, along AMOS-5. Luch 5B went through vacuum thermal testing during May 2012 and was launched on November 3, 2012, along Yamal-300K. Luch 5V was launched on April 28, 2014, along KazSat-3.

During 2013 a military communication satellite was identified as both Luch and Olymp, and later named Olymp-K, was manifested to fly on the Proton-M. It launched successfully on a Proton-M/Briz-M on September 28, 2014. It is known to be based on the USP platform, to be designed for a 15-year life on GEO, to have a laser communications terminal, to use Hall thrusters and is considered to also have a SIGINT payload.

On the 9 October 2015, spacenews.com reported that in April 2015, Olymp-K had moved within of the Intelsat communications spacecraft Intelsat 901 and the nearby Intelsat 7, causing concerns of a safety-of-flight incident. Attempts by Intelsat to contact the Russian satellite&#x27;s operators were not successful, and no reason for the satellite&#x27;s movement was given by the Russian government. The move sparked classified meetings within the Department of Defense.

The Luch-4 is speculated to have mutated into the Yenisey A1. It will be mostly a demonstration spacecraft for new technologies, particularly large diameter unfurlable antenna reflectors and use of electric propulsion for orbit raising maneuvers.

The new Progress-MS and Soyuz-MS will have a Unified Command Telemetry System (UCTS) that will make extensive use of the Luch and GLONASS networks to have real-time telemetry and control of the spacecraft even when not overflying a ground radio station.

<text>In mathematics, specifically order theory, a well-quasi-ordering or wqo on a set formula_1 is a quasi-ordering of formula_1 for which every infinite sequence of elements formula_3 from formula_1 contains an increasing pair formula_5 with formula_6

==Motivation==

Well-founded induction can be used on any set with a well-founded relation, thus one is interested in when a quasi-order is well-founded. (Here, by abuse of terminology, a quasiorder formula_7 is said to be well-founded if the corresponding strict order formula_8 is a well-founded relation.) However the class of well-founded quasiorders is not closed under certain operations—that is, when a quasi-order is used to obtain a new quasi-order on a set of structures derived from our original set, this quasiorder is found to be not well-founded. By placing stronger restrictions on the original well-founded quasiordering one can hope to ensure that our derived quasiorderings are still well-founded.

An example of this is the power set operation. Given a quasiordering formula_7 for a set formula_1 one can define a quasiorder formula_11 on formula_1&#x27;s power set formula_13 by setting formula_14 if and only if for each element of formula_15 one can find some element of formula_16 that is larger than it with respect to formula_7. One can show that this quasiordering on formula_13 needn&#x27;t be well-founded, but if one takes the original quasi-ordering to be a well-quasi-ordering, then it is.

==Formal definition==

A well-quasi-ordering on a set formula_1 is a quasi-ordering (i.e., a reflexive, transitive binary relation) such that any infinite sequence of elements formula_3 from formula_1 contains an increasing pair formula_22 with formula_23. The set formula_1 is said to be well-quasi-ordered, or shortly wqo.

A well partial order, or a wpo, is a wqo that is a proper ordering relation, i.e., it is antisymmetric.

Among other ways of defining wqo&#x27;s, one is to say that they are quasi-orderings which do not contain infinite &quot;strictly decreasing&quot; sequences (of the form formula_25) nor infinite sequences of &quot;pairwise incomparable&quot; elements. Hence a quasi-order (&quot;X&quot;, ≤) is wqo if and only if (&quot;X&quot;, &lt;) is well-founded and has no infinite antichains.

==Ordinal type==

Let formula_1 be well partially ordered. A (necessarily finite) sequence formula_27 of elements of formula_1 that contains no pair formula_22 with formula_23 is usually called a &quot;bad sequence&quot;. The &quot;tree of bad sequences&quot; formula_31 is the tree that contains a vertex for each bad sequence, and an edge joining each nonempty bad sequence formula_32 to its parent formula_33. The root of formula_31 corresponds to the empty sequence. Since formula_1 contains no infinite bad sequence, the tree formula_31 contains no infinite path starting at the root. Therefore, each vertex formula_37 of formula_31 has an ordinal height formula_39, which is defined by transfinite induction as formula_40. The &quot;ordinal type&quot; of formula_1, denoted formula_42, is the ordinal height of the root of formula_31.

A &quot;linearization&quot; of formula_1 is an extension of the partial order into a total order. It is easy to verify that formula_42 is an upper bound on the ordinal type of every linearization of formula_1. De Jongh and Parikh proved that in fact there always exists a linearization of formula_1 that achieves the maximal ordinal type formula_42.

==Examples==

* formula_49, the set of natural numbers with standard ordering, is a well partial order (in fact, a well-order). However, formula_50, the set of positive and negative integers, is not a well-quasi-order, because it is not well-founded (see Pic.1).
* formula_51, the set of natural numbers ordered by divisibility, is not a well-quasi-order: the prime numbers are an infinite antichain (see Pic.2).
* formula_52, the set of vectors of formula_53 natural numbers (where formula_53 is finite) with component-wise ordering, is a well partial order (Dickson&#x27;s lemma; see Pic.3). More generally, if formula_55 is well-quasi-order, then formula_56 is also a well-quasi-order for all formula_53.
* Let formula_1 be an arbitrary finite set with at least two elements. The set formula_59 of words over formula_1 ordered lexicographically (as in a dictionary) is not a well-quasi-order because it contains the infinite decreasing sequence formula_61. Similarly, formula_59 ordered by the prefix relation is not a well-quasi-order, because the previous sequence is an infinite antichain of this partial order. However, formula_59 ordered by the subsequence relation is a well partial order. (If formula_1 has only one element, these three partial orders are identical.)
* More generally, formula_65, the set of finite formula_1-sequences ordered by embedding is a well-quasi-order if and only if formula_55 is a well-quasi-order (Higman&#x27;s lemma). Recall that one embeds a sequence formula_68 into a sequence formula_37 by finding a subsequence of formula_37 that has the same length as formula_68 and that dominates it term by term. When formula_72 is an unordered set, formula_73 if and only if formula_68 is a subsequence of formula_37.
* formula_76, the set of infinite sequences over a well-quasi-order formula_55, ordered by embedding, is not a well-quasi-order in general. That is, Higman&#x27;s lemma does not carry over to infinite sequences. Better-quasi-orderings have been introduced to generalize Higman&#x27;s lemma to sequences of arbitrary lengths.
* Embedding between finite trees with nodes labeled by elements of a wqo formula_55 is a wqo (Kruskal&#x27;s tree theorem).
* Embedding between infinite trees with nodes labeled by elements of a wqo formula_55 is a wqo (Nash-Williams&#x27; theorem).
* Embedding between countable scattered linear order types is a well-quasi-order (Laver&#x27;s theorem).
* Embedding between countable boolean algebras is a well-quasi-order. This follows from Laver&#x27;s theorem and a theorem of Ketonen.
* Finite graphs ordered by a notion of embedding called &quot;graph minor&quot; is a well-quasi-order (Robertson–Seymour theorem).
* Graphs of finite tree-depth ordered by the induced subgraph relation form a well-quasi-order, as do the cographs ordered by induced subgraphs.

==Constructing new wpo&#x27;s from given ones==

Let formula_80 and formula_81 be two disjoint wpo sets. Let formula_82, and define a partial order on formula_83 by letting formula_84 if and only if formula_85 for the same formula_86 and formula_87. Then formula_83 is wpo, and formula_89, where formula_90 denotes natural sum of ordinals.

Given wpo sets formula_80 and formula_81, define a partial order on the Cartesian product formula_93, by letting formula_94 if and only if formula_95 and formula_96. Then formula_83 is wpo (this is a generalization of Dickson&#x27;s lemma), and formula_98, where formula_99 denotes natural product of ordinals.

Given a wpo set formula_1, let formula_59 be the set of finite sequences of elements of formula_1, partially ordered by the subsequence relation. Meaning, let formula_103 if and only if there exist indices formula_104 such that formula_105 for each formula_106. By Higman&#x27;s lemma, formula_59 is wpo. The ordinal type of formula_59 is formula_109

Given a wpo set formula_1, let formula_111 be the set of all finite rooted trees whose vertices are labeled by elements of formula_1. Partially order formula_111 by the tree embedding relation. By Kruskal&#x27;s tree theorem, formula_111 is wpo. This result is nontrivial even for the case formula_115 (which corresponds to unlabeled trees), in which case formula_116 equals the small Veblen ordinal. In general, for formula_42 countable, we have the upper bound formula_118 in terms of the formula_119 ordinal collapsing function. (The small Veblen ordinal equals formula_120 in this ordinal notation.)

==Wqo&#x27;s versus well partial orders==

In practice, the wqo&#x27;s one manipulates are quite often not orderings (see examples above), and the theory is technically smoother if we do not require antisymmetry, so it is built with wqo&#x27;s as the basic notion. On the other hand, according to Milner 1985, &quot;no real gain in generality is obtained by considering quasi-orders rather than partial orders... it is simply more convenient to do so.&quot;

Observe that a wpo is a wqo, and that a wqo gives rise to a wpo between equivalence classes induced by the kernel of the wqo. For example, if we order formula_121 by divisibility, we end up with formula_122 if and only if formula_123, so that formula_124.

==Infinite increasing subsequences==
If formula_55 is wqo then every infinite sequence formula_126 contains an infinite increasing subsequence formula_127 (with formula_128). Such a subsequence is sometimes called perfect.
This can be proved by a Ramsey argument: given some sequence formula_129, consider the set formula_130 of indexes formula_131 such that formula_132 has no larger or equal formula_133 to its right, i.e., with formula_134. If formula_130 is infinite, then the formula_130-extracted subsequence contradicts the assumption that formula_1 is wqo. So formula_130 is finite, and any formula_139 with formula_140 larger than any index in formula_130 can be used as the starting point of an infinite increasing subsequence.

The existence of such infinite increasing subsequences is sometimes taken as a definition for well-quasi-ordering, leading to an equivalent notion.

==Properties of wqos==

* Given a quasiordering formula_142 the quasiordering formula_143 defined by formula_144 is well-founded if and only if formula_142 is a wqo.
* A quasiordering is a wqo if and only if the corresponding partial order (obtained by quotienting by formula_146) has no infinite descending sequences or antichains. (This can be proved using a Ramsey argument as above.)
* Given a well-quasi-ordering formula_142, any sequence of upward-closed subsets formula_148 eventually stabilises (meaning there exists formula_149 such that formula_150; a subset formula_151 is called &quot;upward-closed&quot; if formula_152): assuming the contrary formula_153, a contradiction is reached by extracting an infinite non-ascending subsequence.
* Given a well-quasi-ordering formula_142, any subset formula_155 of formula_1 has a finite number of minimal elements with respect to formula_7, for otherwise the minimal elements of formula_155 would constitute an infinite antichain.

<doc id="739780" wikidata="Q63809" url="?curid=739780" title="Erich Neumann (politician)">
<text>Erich Neumann (31 May 1892 – 23 March 1951) was a German lawyer and civil servant, a member of the Nazi party and an SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot;. Neumann was a participant in the Wannsee Conference that determined the implementation of the Final Solution. He was interned at the end of the Second World War but was released in 1948 due to ill health and was never prosecuted.

== Early life, education and war service ==
Neumann was born into a Protestant family in Forst (Lausitz) where his father was a factory owner. He attended the local &quot;Volksschule&quot; and a boarding secondary school. After receiving his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1911, Neumann enrolled at the University of Freiburg to study law and economics where he also joined the fraternity. He continued his studies at the University of Leipzig and the University of Halle-Wittenberg. After passing his first state law examination in August 1914, he joined the Imperial German Army after the outbreak of the First World War. He served in the 2nd Mounted Light Infantry Regiment () on the eastern front before being discharged on 30 October 1917 due to a severe hand wound. He left the service with the rank of &quot;Leutnant&quot; of reserves, having earned the Iron Cross, second class, and the Wound Badge.

== Employment in the Prussian civil service ==
Neumann began a legal clerkship in January 1918 with the Prussian state judicial administration in Stettin (today, Szczecin). After passing his second state legal examination in October 1920, he entered the civil service as a government attorney () in the Prussian Ministry of the Interior and, thereafter, in its Essen district office. He became a Government Councilor () in October 1923, and transferred to the Prussian Ministry of Trade and Commerce in December. From November 1926 through September 1928, he served as the District Administrator () in Freystadt (Lower Silesia). On 1 October 1928, he returned to the Prussian Ministry of Trade and Commerce as a Ministerial Councilor (). There he headed the department for reparations, subsidies and credits, and served as the German representative at an international debt conference in Paris in 1931-32. Following the 1932 Prussian coup d&#x27;état by the administration of Reich Chancellor Franz von Papen, Neumann was transferred to the Prussian State Ministry in September 1932, where he was placed in charge of administrative reforms.

== Career in Nazi Germany ==
=== Government posts ===
Shortly after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s seizure of power, Neumann was promoted to the post of Permanent Secretary () on 11 February 1933 and was made a deputy plenipotentiary to the &quot;Reichsrat&quot; for Prussia, where he served until its abolition on 14 February 1934. Formerly a member of the German National People&#x27;s Party, Neumann joined the Nazi Party in May 1933 (membership number 2,645,024). On 15 September of that year, he was appointed to the Prussian State Council by Prussian Minister President Hermann Göring and served as its secretary until 1942. In October 1933, he became a founding member of Hans Frank&#x27;s Academy for German Law, serving on its committees for administrative law and municipal constitutions. In the summers of 1935 through 1937, he participated in military training exercises with the &quot;Reiter&quot; Regiment 9, headquartered in Fürstenwalde, and later advanced to the rank of &quot;Rittmeister&quot; of reserves.

On 23 October 1936, Neumann was appointed the director of the Foreign Currency Department of the Office of the Plenipotentiary for the Four Year Plan, headed by Göring. On 23 July 1938, Neumann was promoted to State Secretary and Deputy to Paul Körner, Göring&#x27;s chief deputy in the Four Year Plan, and sat as a member of its general council (). Neumann attended Göring&#x27;s 12 November 1938 meeting about the &quot;Aryanisation&quot; of the German economy. After the occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Neumann was involved in the actions that resulted in the takeover of the Petschek coal concern by the &quot;Reichswerke Hermann Göring&quot; conglomerate. He also profited personally from the Aryanization process, as he lived in a villa near the Berlin Botanical Garden that a Jewish woman had been forced to sell in order to emigrate.

After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Neumann became a member of the Economic Management Plan East () in 1941 and 1942 that planned for the economic exploitation of the Soviet Union. From 1941, he was the deputy chairman of the supervisory board of Kontinentale Öl, a company set up for the exploitation of Soviet oil reserves.

As State Secretary, Neumann was the official representative of the Four Year Plan at the 20 January 1942 Wannsee Conference, at which the genocidal Final Solution to the Jewish Question was planned. Neumann requested that Jewish workers in firms essential to the war effort not be deported for the time being. His objection was not that they should be spared based on humanitarian or moral grounds, only that they not be deported before replacements could be found, thus temporarily retaining them for their economic benefit to the Reich. On 1 August 1942, Neumann left government service at his own request to become the General Director of the German Potassium Syndicate () where he remained through the fall of the Nazi regime in May 1945.

=== SS membership ===
In addition to his government positions, Neumann was also a member of the &quot;Allgemeine SS&quot;. He joined the organization on 13 August 1934 (SS number 222,014) where he first was assigned to the &quot;SS-Oberabschnitt Ost&quot; (SS-Main District East) (1934) then to the office of the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; (1934–36), the SS Main Office (1936–39) and, finally, back to Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s personal staff (1939–45). Commissioned as an SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; in August 1934, he rose through the ranks and attained his final promotion to SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; on 30 January 1939.

== Post-war life ==
After Germany&#x27;s surrender, Neumann was interned by the Allies, first in Ludwigsburg and later in Nuremberg. He was repeatedly interrogated but denied all knowledge of the Holocaust, even refusing to admit that he had been an attendee at the meeting in Wanssee. No charges were ever brought against him and he was released due to poor health in mid-1948. He returned to his family in Grainau and was employed as an advisor to the Potassium Syndicate. He died three years later of acute circulatory failure in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, on 23 March 1951.

== Film portrayals ==
Neumann was portrayed by in the German film &quot;Die Wannseekonferenz&quot; (1984), by Jonathan Coy in the BBC/HBO film &quot;Conspiracy&quot; (2001) and by in the German film &quot;Die Wannseekonferenz&quot; (2022).

<text>John Patton (July 12, 1935 – March 19, 2002) was an American jazz, blues and R&amp;B pianist and organist often known by his nickname, Big John Patton.

Patton was one of the most in-demand organists during the golden era of the Hammond B-3 organs between 1963 and 1970.
 He recorded extensively for Blue Note and performed or collaborated with Lloyd Price, Grant Green, and Lou Donaldson. Patton had a lower profile in the 1970s but enjoyed a comeback in the 1980s and 1990s, often in collaboration with saxophonist John Zorn. His later music incorporated modal and free jazz.

==Biography==
John Patton, born in Kansas City, Missouri, United States, was an American jazz composer and performer. He developed the nickname &quot;Big John&quot;, not because of his size, but because of a song. &quot;Remember the tune, &#x27;Big Bad John&#x27;? ... yeah, well, that&#x27;s what they started calling me and at first I didn&#x27;t understand it but I love it now. It&#x27;s just a name; if it&#x27;s going to help you, then boogie on up in there!&quot;

Patton&#x27;s mother was a church pianist who taught him how to play fundamentals. When he was about 13 years old, in 1948, he began to teach himself. He was inspired by the music he heard in his hometown, but he wanted to play beyond the Kansas City jazz scene. After high school, he headed East and found professional work. In 1954 in Washington, D.C., he found out that R&amp;B star Lloyd Price was playing at the Howard Theater, and that Price had just fired his pianist and needed a new player. Patton played a few bars from the introduction to &quot;Lawdy, Miss Clawdy&quot;. He was given the job.

It was a relationship that would last until 1959. &quot;I learned everything with Lloyd,&quot; Patton said. &quot;I was his &#x27;straw boss&#x27; and the leader and he dumped all this on me and that was an experience that I got a chance to deal with.&quot; He recruited top players for Lloyd, including drummer Ben Dixon. Dixon, another self-taught player, encouraged John to check out the Hammond B-3 organ when they played in clubs that had one. &quot;Some of the clubs that we would play in would have an organ off to the side and every time I would have a chance to get with that organ, man, it was just fascinating to me...especially the bass line.&quot;

A man called &quot;Butts&quot; first showed Patton how to set up the organ and find the right registrations. When he moved to New York in late 1959, and began playing gigs around town, Herman Green, a friend who played with Lionel Hampton&#x27;s band, took him to a Hammond in Asbury Park, New Jersey, and helped him learn how to play it. Patton was fascinated with the differences in the nuance of the sound that an electric organ could produce. &quot;Man, listen, it&#x27;s so sensitive and it will reveal its secrets if you try to get up in there and learn it...and learn the sound and contact. You can&#x27;t play it like a piano &#x27;cause that&#x27;s another thing all together - The notes are the same but, see, that electricity puts another &#x27;jammie&#x27; on you, you know what I mean? You must deal with touch and so many other things...and I was very frustrated at first.&quot;

Patton set up his own Hammond organ trio in 1959. Blue Note artist Ike Quebec became his mentor, introducing him into Blue Note and to one of the most important relationships in his career, with guitarist Grant Green. &quot;Grant is my love...I never heard nobody play the guitar like that brother...Grant started playing when he was about twelve and he was out there a long time...and I was so thrilled that I got a chance to play with him, man, but he was greedy, (like a) Gemini, (but) I was a mule...I didn&#x27;t care; I sho&#x27; learned!&quot;

He worked as a sideman for Lou Donaldson for three and a half years, until 1964. &quot;He says &#x27;Play the BLUES&#x27;,&quot; Patton recalled. &quot;You don&#x27;t mess with Lou &#x27;cause Lou knows how to play the Be Bop and Blues and Rhythm and Blues ... I am very fortunate that I got a chance to spend that much time with him and I can&#x27;t thank him enough.&quot; Of his influences, Patton stated &quot;I love trumpet, I love trombone, I love reeds...I love it all...Musicians like Fred Jackson, Richard Williams, Grant Green, Ben Dixon and Johnny Griffin...I can go on and on ...This is where I got my concept.&quot;

The acid jazz movement in the 1980s caused a resurgence in interest in Patton&#x27;s music in the UK. Blue Note released many sessions that had not previously been released, including &quot;Blue John&quot; with Grant Green and George Braith (listed as Braithwaite on the LP). Patton made several trips to England where he was embraced by the acid jazz community.

Patton died from complications arising from diabetes, in Montclair, New Jersey, on March 19, 2002.

<text>Scandal is a 1989 British historical drama film, directed by Michael Caton-Jones. It is a fictionalised account of the Profumo affair that rocked the government of British prime minister Harold Macmillan. It stars Joanne Whalley as Christine Keeler and John Hurt as Stephen Ward, personalities at the heart of the affair.

&quot;Scandal&quot; was screened in competition at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. Its theme song &quot;Nothing Has Been Proved&quot; was written and produced by Pet Shop Boys and sung by Dusty Springfield.

==Plot==
An English osteopath is enchanted with a young exotic dancer and invites her to live with him. He serves as friend and mentor, and through his wide range of contacts and his parties she and her friend meet and date members of the Conservative Party. A scandal develops when her affair with the Minister of War comes to public attention.

==Cast==
==Production==

===Development===
Australian screenwriter Michael Thomas and prospective producer Joe Boyd approached the BBC with the idea of a three-part mini-series on the Profumo affair. The BBC agreed to finance scripts for two of the 90-minute episodes, but support dried up when internal memos were found that forbade their production. Channel 4 turned them down on grounds of taste.

Boyd and Thomas joined forces with Palace Pictures who invested nearly £200,000 by 1985; a further £184,319 of development funding was raised from Robert Maxwell. As the prospects for a television mini-series began to fade, Palace Pictures became increasingly interested in making a feature film and estimated the budget requirements at £3.2 million. Co-founders Stephen Woolley and Nik Powell signed up first time director Michael Caton-Jones on a pay-or-play contract and began a marketing campaign to raise the finance. The controversial nature of the story, as well as its sexual content, appealed to Bob and Harvey Weinstein&#x27;s independent film company, Miramax. The Weinsteins agreed to pay $2.35 million for the North American distribution rights.

The original screenplay was written as a historically detailed mini-series running four to five hours. When it was pared down to film length, it became more of a docudrama, with a chronology that is sometimes unclear. Producer Woolley arranged discreet meetings between Mandy Rice-Davies and Bridget Fonda to help the American actress with her portrayal.

===Filming===
Filming began in June 1988. Part of &quot;Scandal&quot; was filmed at Bathurst Mews in Bayswater, London, although Ward&#x27;s house was actually at Wimpole Mews in Marylebone. The exterior of 29 Francis Street, Victoria, SW1 was used as the Police Station.

===Poster===

Christine Keeler took part in a publicity shoot with photographer Lewis Morley for a 1963 film about the Profumo Affair, &quot;The Keeler Affair&quot;. Under pressure to pose nude, Keeler agreed to sit straddling the chair with just the back of the chair as a screen. The film was never released in the United Kingdom, but the image became &quot;one of the most famous and most imitated photographs ever published&quot;. Joanne Whalley-Kilmer recreated the pose for the theatrical release poster.

===US classification===
The Weinsteins had been impressed by the amount of free publicity generated for Alan Parker&#x27;s &quot;Angel Heart&quot; in 1987 when it was initially given an &quot;X&quot; rating in the United States. Beginning with &quot;Scandal&quot;, Harvey Weinstein would routinely help publicise Miramax&#x27;s films by attacking the integrity of the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA) and X ratings. They encouraged Woolley and Powell to deliver an X rated movie, and in particular to include nude shots of Whalley-Kilmer. The film was awarded an X rating for its orgy scene, but after two appeals and three seconds of edits, it was released with an &quot;R&quot; rating.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack, and soundtrack album, included a specially written song by the Pet Shop Boys &quot;Nothing Has Been Proved&quot; for Dusty Springfield.

==Reception==
The film received positive reviews. At the movie review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Scandal&quot; received an overall approval rating of 88% based on 34 reviews. Roger Ebert awarded it four stars out of four and said the film was &quot;surprisingly wise about the complexities of the human heart&quot;. He praised the performance of John Hurt. Following Hurt&#x27;s death, &quot;The Guardian&quot; film critic Peter Bradshaw said the performance was Hurt&#x27;s masterpiece.

The film made a comfortable profit. In the UK it made £3,705,065.

Commenting on the pain felt by his parents when the film was released, David Profumo said, &quot;I never felt sorrier for them in my life&quot;.

Its first recorded uses were Godwin Nieweman in Oxfordshire, England, in 1169, and in Germany, Herman Nyeman of Barth in 1325. It was mostly likely originally used as a nickname for a recent arrival or settler. Its early use in Germany was mainly in West Prussia and Pomerelia. It was also used by the Anglo-Saxons and in France (as Neuman). In Middle High German the word for &quot;new&quot; was &quot;&quot;, and in modern German &quot;&quot;.
