<text>Vasily Vasilyevich Vereshchagin (; 26 October 184213 April 1904) was a Russian painter, war artist, and traveller. The graphic nature of his realist scenes led to many of them never being printed or exhibited to the public.

==Years of apprenticeship==
Vereshchagin was born at Cherepovets, Novgorod Governorate, Russia, in 1842 as the middle of three brothers. His father was a landowner of noble birth, while his mother was of common origin and had Tatar roots. When he was eight years old, he was sent to Tsarskoe Selo to enter the Alexander Cadet Corps. Three years later, he entered the Naval Cadet Corps at St. Petersburg, making his first voyage in 1858. He served on the frigate , which sailed to Denmark, France, and Egypt.

Vereshchagin graduated first in his list at the naval school, but left the service immediately to begin the study of drawing in earnest. Two years later, in 1863, he won a medal from the Imperial Academy of Arts for his &quot;Ulysses Slaying the Suitors&quot;. In 1864, he proceeded to Paris, where he studied under Jean-Léon Gérôme, though he dissented widely from his master&#x27;s methods.

==Travels in Central Asia==
In the Paris Salon of 1866, Vereshchagin exhibited a drawing of &quot;Dukhobors chanting their Psalms&quot;. In the next year, he was invited to accompany General Konstantin Petrovich Kaufman&#x27;s expedition in Central Asia and Turkestan. He was granted the rank of ensign. His heroism at the siege of Samarkand from 2–8 June 1868 resulted an award of the Cross of St. George (4th Class). He was an indefatigable traveller, returning to St. Petersburg in late 1868, to Paris in 1869, back to St. Petersburg later in the year, and then back to Turkestan via Siberia at the end of 1869.

In 1871, Vereshchagin established an atelier in Munich, German Empire. He gave a solo exhibition of his works (later referred to as his &quot;Turkestan Series&quot;) at the Crystal Palace in London, United Kingdom in 1873. He gave another exhibition of his works in St. Petersburg in 1874, where two of his paintings, namely, &quot;The Apotheosis of War&quot;, dedicated &quot;to all conquerors, past, present and to come,&quot; and &quot;Left Behind&quot;, the picture of a dying soldier deserted by his fellows, were denied a showing on the grounds that they portrayed the Russian military in a poor light. In late 1874, Vereshchagin departed in Northern and Eastern Asia for an extensive tour of the Himalayas, British India, Mongolia, and Tibet, spending over two years in travel. He returned to Paris in late 1876.

==Russo-Turkish War==
With the start of the Second Russo-Turkish War, Vereshchagin left Paris and returned to active service with the Imperial Russian Army. He was present at the crossing of the Shipka Pass and at the siege of Plevna (1877), where his brother was killed. He was dangerously wounded during the preparations for the crossing of the Danube near Rustchuk. At the conclusion of the war, he acted as secretary to General Skobelev at San Stefano.

==World fame==
After the war, Vereshchagin settled in Munich, where he produced his war pictures so rapidly that he was freely accused of employing assistants. The sensational subjects of his pictures, and their didactic aim, namely, the promotion of peace by a representation of the horrors of war, attracted a large section of the public not usually interested in art to the series of exhibitions of his pictures in Paris in 1881, and subsequently in London, Berlin, Dresden, Vienna, and other cities.
Vereshchagin painted several scenes of imperial rule in British India. His epic portrayal of &quot;The State Procession of the Prince of Wales into Jaipur in 1876&quot; is at believed to be the second-largest oil painting in the world. He traveled again to India in 1882–1883. 
He aroused much controversy by his series of three pictures: firstly, of a Roman execution (the &quot;Crucifixion by the Romans (1887)&quot;); secondly, &quot;Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English&quot;; and, thirdly, of the execution of Nihilists in St Petersburg. When &quot;Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English&quot; was first exhibited, many in America and Britain believed that it depicted executions of sepoys carried out by tying victims to the barrels of guns. Vereshchagin&#x27;s detractors argued that such executions had only occurred in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, but the painting depicted modern soldiers of the 1880s, implying that the practice was then current. Because of its photographic style, the painting appeared to present itself as an impartial record of a real event. In fact, Vereshchagin&#x27;s work did show a more contemporary though lesser known execution; in 1872 Deputy-Commissioner J. L. Cowan ordered the execution of a group of Namdhari Sikhs at the parade grounds in Malerkotla by blowing from guns. In 1887, Vereshchagin defended himself in &quot;The Magazine of Art&quot; by saying that if there were another rebellion then the British would use this method again.

A journey to the Ottoman provinces of Syria and Palestine in 1884 furnished him with an equally discussed set of subjects from the New Testament. Vereshchagin&#x27;s paintings caused controversy over his portrayal of the figure of Christ with what was thought at the time to be an unseemly realism. The &quot;1812&quot; series on Napoleon&#x27;s Russian campaign, on which Vereshchagin also wrote a book, seems to have been inspired by Tolstoi&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;, and was painted in 1893 in Moscow, where the artist eventually settled.

==Last years==
Vereshchagin was in the Far East during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895, and was with the Russian troops in Manchuria during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. In 1901, he visited the Philippines, in 1902 the United States and Cuba, and in 1903, Japan.

During the Russo-Japanese War, he was invited by Admiral Stepan Makarov to join him aboard Makarov&#x27;s battleship, . On April 13, 1904, &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot; struck two mines while returning to Port Arthur and sank, taking with it most of the crew, including both Admiral Makarov and Vereshchagin. Vereshchagin&#x27;s last work, a picture of a council of war presided over by Admiral Makarov, was recovered almost undamaged.

<text>Giovanni Carmelo Verga di Fontanabianca (; 2 September 1840 – 27 January 1922) was an Italian realist (&quot;verista&quot;) writer. 

==Life and career==
The first son of Giovanni Battista Catalano Verga and Caterina Di Mauro, Verga was born into a prosperous family of Catania in Sicily. He began writing in his teens, producing the historical novel &quot;Amore e Patria&quot; (&quot;Love and Homeland&quot;) when he was only 16 years old. Although nominally studying law at the University of Catania, he used money his father had given him to publish his &quot;I carbonari della montagna&quot; (&quot;The Carbonari of the Mountain&quot;) in 1861 and 1862. This was followed by &quot;Sulle lagune&quot; (&quot;On the Lagoons&quot;) in 1863 and &quot;Una peccatrice&quot; (&quot;A Sinner&quot;) in 1866. 

Meanwhile, Verga had been serving in the Catania National Guard (1860–64), after which he travelled to Florence several times, settling there in 1869. Important personalities stayed in this city, and the cultural debate on subjects such as physiology, positivism, and Darwinism was lively. Verga wrote the comedy &quot;Rose caduche&quot; (&quot;Deciduous roses&quot;), which was never performed and published posthumously in 1923, and his first successful novel, &quot;Storia di una capinera&quot; (&quot;The Story of a blackcap&quot;).

He moved to Milan in 1872, where he developed his new approach, characterized by the use of dialogue to develop character, which resulted in his most significant works. In this period this city was the most modern one of the peninsula, economic capital and home to the main newspapers and major publishing houses to come into contact with modernity. He became assiduous with the most famous Milanese cultural circles, such as the salon of Countess Clara Maffei. He befriended unruly writers and teamed up at the Cova café with authors, publishers and literary critics. For instance he strengthened his friendship with Luigi Capuana. In 1880 his story collection &quot;Vita dei campi&quot; (&quot;Life in the Fields&quot;), including &quot;Fantasticheria&quot; (&quot;Daydreaming&quot;), &quot;La lupa&quot; (&quot;The She-wolf&quot;), &quot;Jeli il pastore&quot; (&quot;Jeli the Shepherd&quot;), &quot;Pentolaccia&quot; (&quot;The Plaything&quot;), and &quot;Rosso Malpelo&quot;, most of which were about rural Sicily, came out. It also included &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; (&quot;Rustic Chivalry&quot;), which he adapted for the theatre - and later formed the basis for several opera librettos, including Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; and Gastaldon&#x27;s &quot;Mala Pasqua!&quot;. Verga&#x27;s short story, &quot;Malaria&quot;, was one of the first literary depictions of the disease malaria.

He then embarked on a projected series of five novels, the &quot;Ciclo dei vinti&quot; (Cycle of the Vanquished) dealing with the problem of social and economic advancement. However, he completed only two, &quot;I Malavoglia&quot; (1881) and &quot;Mastro-don Gesualdo&quot; (1889), the second of which was the last major work of his literary career. Both are widely recognized as masterpieces. He then began to write &quot;La Duchessa di Leyra&quot;, but he completed only the first chapter, and he did not even start the last two novels, &quot;L&#x27;Onorevole Scipioni&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Uomo di Lusso&quot;.

In 1894 Verga moved back to Catania, to the house in which he had lived as a child. This house in the city of Catania on via Sant&#x27;Anna #8 is now a museum dedicated to the author. The &quot;Casa-Museo Giovanni Verga&quot; is located on the second floor of a generally unimposing 18th-century palace. The furnishings were those present at the time of his death, including his large personal library. Also in Catania, a performance stage that often performs works of local artists, the Teatro Verga, was founded in 1969 in a former cinema located on Via Giuseppe Fava #34.

In 1920 he was appointed Senator of the Kingdom &quot;(Senatore del Regno)&quot; for life &quot;(ad vitam)&quot;. He died of a cerebral thrombosis in 1922. He was an atheist. In 2022 the official &quot;Verga 100&quot; event was launched, dedicated to the centenary of the writer, with many events from Palermo to Milan, from theater to musical performances, Cinema, and Book Festival

<text>Ancients is a board wargame published by Good Industries in 1986 that simulates various historical battles in pre-gunpowder settings.

==Description==
&quot;Ancients&quot; is a two-player wargame with rules for low-complexity tactical combat. The game box includes four map sheets to be used with various battles. Various options allow for the inclusion of exotic items such as chariots or elephants. The game includes over 60 scenarios for historical battles from Ancient Greece to the Renaissance. Each scenario only lasts seven turns.

==Gameplay==
Combat uses a simple alternating system of turns: the first player removes leaders from the board, then moves units. The second player&#x27;s missile troops fire, then the first player&#x27;s melee troops attack. Any units that are his are disorganized and cannot attack. After combat, the leaders are replaced, and any disorganized units in touch with the leader are rallied. Once this is finished, the players switch attacking and defensive roles, the second player now getting an opportunity to move and attack. 

==Publication history==
&quot;Ancients&quot; was designed by Bill Banks who founded Good Industries in 1986 to self-publish the game. Banks also published a companion board game, &quot;King of Kings&quot;, as well as &quot;Ancients II&quot; that added naval combat rules and scenarios. 

3W became the publisher of &quot;Ancients&quot; in 1992, and reduced the number of scenarios to 32. 3W also revised and re-published the companion board game, retitling it &quot;Imperator&quot;.

==Reception==
Mike Siggins reviewed &quot;Ancients&quot; for &quot;Games International&quot;, and was pleasantly surprised by the professional components, given that it was a self-published effort. Siggins found all of the scenarios were well-balanced, and said, &quot;I think &quot;Ancients&quot; is one of those games, like &quot;Squad Leader&quot;, that simply &#x27;works&#x27;. He concluded by giving it an excellent rating of 5 stars out of 5, saying, &quot;At the price, even with postage from the States, &quot;Ancients&quot; is one of the best bargains in gaming. The components are very good indeed, the rules are concise and accurate and the system works extremely well.&quot;

In Issue 7 of &quot;Berg&#x27;s Review of Games&quot;, game designer Richard Berg commented that the game &quot;attempts to combine at least a modicum of flavor and creativity with its simplicity, synthesizing familiar rules into an enjoyable and eminently playable system.&quot; After examining the scenarios, Berg was impressed, writing, &quot;With his simple little system, [game designer Bill] Banks has managed to paint some (but certainly not all) broad truths about ancient and medieval warfare.&quot; Berg called the game a family hatchback compared to the Maseratis of the wargaming world but concluded that &quot;Ancients&quot; was &quot;a pretty good way to introduce the uninitiated to our obsession. It&#x27;s fast, furious, fun that ends quickly, and leaves you wanting more. Bill Banks has managed to keep it simple without becoming overly simplistic.&quot;

<text>Calvin William Verity Jr. (January 26, 1917 – January 3, 2007) was an American government official and steel industrialist who served as the 27th United States secretary of commerce between 1987 and 1989, under President Ronald Reagan.

== Early life and education ==
He was born in Middletown, Ohio, on January 26, 1917, to Calvin William Verity and Elizabeth (O&#x27;Brien) Verity. He roomed with John F. Kennedy at Choate, a Connecticut boarding school, starting a friendship with the future president. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from Yale University.

== Career ==
After graduating from college, Verity tramped around the world and worked as maître d&#x27; at an upscale Manhattan restaurant. He also served in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1945. Verity worked for most of his career at Armco Steel, a corporation founded by his grandfather, George M. Verity. He started there in 1940 and retired from Armco in 1982.

=== Secretary of Commerce ===

Between 1980 and 1981, Verity chaired the United States Chamber of Commerce. In 1981, he chaired Reagan&#x27;s bipartisan task force on Private Sector Initiatives (PSI). In 1983, he was appointed a member of PSI&#x27;s Advisory Council and later served on PSI&#x27;s Board of Advisors. Between 1979 and 1984, he co-chaired the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade Economic Council, a private sector council of American and Soviet businessmen.

During Verity&#x27;s time at the U.S. Department of Commerce, he established the Commerce Hall of Fame in 1988 to honor good department employees. In 1988, he also created the Office of Space Commerce to support the National Space Council. That office was an early version of the Office of Space Commercialization, an office created to promote the effective commercial use of outer space. According to Jonathan Chait of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Verity kept a passage from Ayn Rand&#x27;s novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; on his desk, including the line &quot;How well you do your work . . . [is] the only measure of human value.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Verity&#x27;s wife, the former Margaret Wymond Verity, known as Peggy, and they had two sons and a daughter together (Peggy Verity Power, Jonathan George Verity, and William Wymond Verity).

He died on January 3, 2007, a complications of pneumonia, in Beaufort, South Carolina, at the age of 89, twenty-three days before his 90th birthday. His wife, Peggy Verity, died on Wednesday, January 20, 1999, at age 81. He is interred in Woodside Cemetery, Middletown, Ohio.

<text>Pierre Vernier (; 19 August 1580 at Ornans, Franche-Comté (at that time ruled by the Spanish Habsburgs, now part of France) – 14 September 1637, same location) was a French mathematician and instrument inventor. He was the inventor and eponym of the vernier scale used in measuring devices.

== Life ==

He was born in Ornans, France, in 1580. He was taught science by his father. He became captain and castellan of the castle at Ornans, for the King of Spain. He was also later councillor and director general of economy in the County of Burgundy.

In Brussels, in the year 1631, Vernier published his treatise &quot;La construction, l&#x27;usage, et les propriétés du quadrant nouveau de mathématique&quot;, and dedicated it to the Infanta. In it, he described the ingenious device which now bears his name, the vernier scale.

To a quadrant with a primary scale in half degrees Vernier proposed to attach a movable sector, thirty-one half degrees in length but divided into thirty equal parts (each part consisting then of a half-degree plus one minute). In measuring an angle, minutes could be easily reckoned by noticing which division line of the sector coincided with a division line of the quadrant.

Christopher Clavius had earlier mentioned this idea but had not proposed to attach the scale permanently to the instrument.

The name &quot;vernier&quot; is now applied to the small movable scale attached to a caliper, sextant, barometer, or other graduated instrument and was given by Jérôme Lalande. Lalande showed that the previous name, &quot;nonius&quot; after Pedro Nunes, belonged more properly to a different contrivance. The name &quot;nonius&quot; continued to be applied to the vernier until the beginning of the 19th century.

<doc id="754250" wikidata="Q284635" url="?curid=754250" title="Maurice J. Tobin">
<text>Maurice Joseph Tobin (May 22, 1901July 19, 1953) was an American politician serving as 46th Mayor of Boston, the 56th Governor of Massachusetts and 6th United States Secretary of Labor. He was a member of the Democratic Party and a liberal that supported the New Deal and Fair Deal programs, and was outspoken in his support for labor unions. However, he had little success battling against the conservative majorities in the Massachusetts legislature, and the U.S. Congress.

==Early life and career==

Tobin was born in Mission Hill, Boston, Massachusetts on May 22, 1901. Deeply rooted in the highly politicized Irish Catholic community, he was the oldest of four children of James Tobin, a carpenter, and Margaret Daly. He took evening classes at Boston College and worked for Conway Leather and New England Telephone before entering politics as a protégé of the legendary James Michael Curley. Tobin was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives at the age of 25 and served from 1927 to 1929.

On November 19, 1932, Tobin married the former Helen Noonan (1906-1987) in Brighton, Massachusetts, with whom he had three children. He served on the Boston School Committee from 1931 to 1937, before shocking the political establishment by defeating Curley in the 1937 race for Mayor of Boston.

==Mayoralty==

Tobin was elected mayor of Boston in 1937. He was reelected in 1941. He served as mayor from 1938 to 1945, during which time he advocated the Fair Employment Practices Bill, which prohibited discrimination based on race, color, creed, and national origin in hiring or promotion practices. He was fiscally conservative, choosing to forgo the large public works projects that had characterized the Curley administration, and he smoothed over previously contentious battles with the federal government over access to New Deal relief funding. The Huntington Avenue subway, a WPA project begun in 1936 and one of its largest projects undertaken, was completed under his administration in 1941. In 1941, the Boston Housing Authority began clearing the land for the whites-only West Broadway Housing Development (which would open in 1949).

During his tenure as mayor, the Cocoanut Grove fire occurred in Boston. Prior to the fire, club owner Barney Welansky boasted that that club had not needed to adhere to fire codes because Tobin would not permit his club to be closed. Welansky was convicted of manslaughter, and Tobin himself only narrowly escaped indictment. Four years into Welansky&#x27;s sentence, then-Governor Tobin pardoned him.

==Governorship==
In 1944, Mayor Tobin was elected governor of Massachusetts, defeating the Republican nominee, Lieutenant Governor Horace T. Cahill. He served one term as governor from 1945 to 1947. Tobin proposed a liberal agenda that was not accepted by the Republican-controlled Massachusetts legislature. He called for additional unemployment benefits, veterans benefits, rent control, and laws to end racial discrimination in hiring. He was a strong supporter of labor unions. In 1946, he was defeated for re-election by his Republican opponent, Lieutenant Governor Robert F. Bradford.

==Secretary of Labor==

Governor Tobin remained active in Democratic politics, however, and campaigned vigorously for President Truman in 1948. Tobin repeatedly denounced the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, making 150 speeches against it in the 1948 election campaign. He argued that it was bad for workers. Upon Truman&#x27;s reelection, Tobin was appointed as U.S. Secretary of Labor, a position he held until the close of the Truman Administration in January 1953.

Tobin discovered that the Department of Labor had minimal influence; it did not control the National Labor Relations Board, or the Mediation Service, which were more influential. In 1949 he had president Truman transfer the United States Employment Service and the Unemployment Insurance Service to his department. He also managed to move several smaller bureaus, and he created a Federal Safety Council. Although the Democrats regained control of Congress in 1948 election, the Conservatives were still dominant and Tobin and Truman were unable to repeal Taft-Hartley.

Tobin&#x27;s most notable deed as Labor Secretary came in the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949, which increased the minimum wage to 75 cents an hour, and strengthened the prohibitions on child labor. Tobin played a role during the Korean War in coordinating defense manpower needs. However, in the steel strike of 1952, Tobin came out on the side of the unions, saying that &quot;the time for impartiality&quot; had passed, and that the unions were justified in their wartime strike. In 1951, Tobin attacked Senator Joseph McCarthy, a fellow Irish Catholic, calling on fellow Catholics to repudiate McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;campaign of terror against free thought in the United States.&quot;

==Later months and death==
Shortly after he left his position in the Truman cabinet in January 1953, Tobin died of a heart attack on July 19, 1953, at his summer home in Scituate, Massachusetts, at the age of 52. He is buried in Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline, Massachusetts. His funeral was attended by Senator John F. Kennedy.

==Legacy==
A men&#x27;s dormitory facility on the Long Island Hospital campus on Long Island in Boston Harbor is dedicated to Tobin. The Tobin Building&#x27;s cornerstone was laid on November 9, 1940. In 1967, the Mystic River Bridge was renamed the Maurice J. Tobin Memorial Bridge. An elementary school is named after Tobin in the Mission Hill neighborhood of Boston, where he was born. The Psychology Department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst is located in Tobin Hall.

<doc id="754254" wikidata="Q713145" url="?curid=754254" title="Edward Vernon">
<text>Admiral Edward Vernon (12 November 1684 – 30 October 1757) was a Royal Navy officer and politician. He had a long and distinguished career, rising to the rank of admiral after 46 years service. As a vice admiral during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, in 1739 he was responsible for the capture of Portobelo, Panama, seen as expunging the failure of Admiral Hosier there in a previous conflict. However, his amphibious operation against the Spanish port of Cartagena de Indias was a disastrous defeat. Vernon also served as a Member of Parliament (MP) on three occasions and was outspoken on naval matters in Parliament, making him a controversial figure.

The origin of the name &quot;grog&quot; for rum diluted with water is attributed to Vernon. He was known for wearing coats made of grogram cloth, earning him the nickname of &quot;Old Grog&quot;, which in turn came to mean the diluted rum that he first introduced into his naval squadron. He is also the eponym of George Washington&#x27;s estate Mount Vernon, and thereby the many places in the United States named after it.

==Early life==
Born in Westminster, London, Vernon was the second son of James Vernon, secretary of state to William III. Edward had one other sibling, James who became British envoy to Denmark and served as a member of parliament and Clerk of the Privy Council. Vernon briefly attended Westminster School, then joined the Royal Navy on 10 May 1700 as a &quot;Volunteer per order&quot; on board . Vernon&#x27;s secondary education was sharply at odds with the norm for Royal Navy officers of his day, most of whom received an elementary education before they were sent to sea at about the age of twelve.

==War of the Spanish Succession==

In March 1701, he was transferred to and three months later, joined . On 16 September 1702, Vernon was promoted lieutenant and appointed to serving in the Channel Squadron. The ship was later transferred to the Mediterranean and finally paid off in March 1704. He was then appointed to , which at the time was the flagship of Admiral Cloudesley Shovell in the Mediterranean. The ship was present at the capture of Gibraltar and the Battle of Málaga. 
In December, with Shovell, he transferred to and was present at the capture of Barcelona in 1705.

On 22 January 1706, he was promoted captain and appointed to HMS &quot;Dolphin&quot;. However, he was moved ten days later into and remained in the Mediterranean until 1707. With the rest of Shovell&#x27;s fleet, he returned to England, but was fortunate to escape the disaster that befell Shovell&#x27;s flagship, at the Isles of Scilly. In November, he joined and in April 1708, took command of the West Indies station. In 1710, he successfully broke up a Spanish squadron off Cartagena. At the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1712, he returned to Britain.

===Peace, promotion and Parliament===
In March 1715, he was appointed to , in which he served in the Baltic until 1717, when the ship was paid off. After this, he was put on half pay for the next eighteen months. In March 1719, he was appointed to HMS &quot;Mary&quot; and returned to the Baltic. Vernon was the commodore on the Jamaica Station in 1720.

In 1721, he again went on half pay for five years. During this period, he became the Member of Parliament for Penryn, a seat his father had represented, and took a leading part in naval debates.

In 1726, he was re-appointed to active service in . This ship served in the Baltic until the winter of 1727, when it was transferred to the fleet at Gibraltar after Spain declared war on Britain. In May 1728, peace was made with Spain, and Vernon returned to Britain and resumed his Parliamentary duties. He took up the case of the Welshman Robert Jenkins, a merchant seaman who claimed to have had his ear cut off after his vessel was boarded by Spanish privateers &quot;Coast guards or privateers guardacostas&quot; in 1731.

==War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear==

The accumulation of Spanish-British conflicts led to the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear in 1739, in which Vice Admiral Vernon led a fleet along with Major General Thomas Wentworth. Vernon captured Portobelo, Panama, a Spanish colonial possession, as a result of which he was granted the Freedom of the City of London. However, Vernon&#x27;s next campaign against the Spanish, a large-scale assault on Cartagena de Indias in 1741, ended in disaster. After initial success, the British fleet of 186 ships and around 12,000 infantry was defeated by a garrison of 3,500 men and the sailors disembarked from the six ships of the line commanded by the one-eyed, one-legged and one-armed Spanish admiral Blas de Lezo. As disease spread among the British troops, delaying tactics by the Spaniards and a failed assault on the last fortification defending the city led a council of war to decide to abandon the siege and withdraw to Jamaica. The assault was further marred by bitter quarrels with Wentworth. After a further year and a half ineffectually campaigning in the Caribbean, Vernon was recalled back to England to find he had been elected MP for Ipswich.

During the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, Vernon was promoted vice admiral of the blue on 9 July 1739 and, as he had prominently spoken for both the war and the Navy, he was given the command of a squadron of six ships assigned to the Jamaica Station. &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; reported England&#x27;s preparations for war against Spain in July 1739, noting that Vernon had been recalled to active duty and promoted; that, on 10 July King George II had instructed the Lords of the Admiralty to prepare &quot;Letters of Marque&quot;; and (a week after the fact) it reported Vernon and his squadron had sailed for the West Indies on 20 July.

Despite the unmistakable signs of Great Britain preparing for a naval war in the summer of 1739, the formal declaration of war against Spain was not announced in London until Saturday, 23 October 1739.

===Portobelo===

 On 21 November 1739 Vernon captured the Spanish colonial possession of Portobelo, Panama (now in Panama) using just six ships (against the 90-man Spanish garrison). Vernon was subsequently granted the Freedom of the City of London and commemorative medals were produced. The Portobello areas in London, Dublin and Edinburgh (see Portobello Road and Portobello, Dublin) are named after this victory, and &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; was composed by Thomas Arne during the celebrations in 1740. A tower commemorating his victory was erected by members of the Vernon family living at Hilton Hall outside Wolverhampton.

===Addressed by Hosier&#x27;s Ghost===
Vernon&#x27;s action was seen by the &quot;Patriots&quot;, or pro-war party opposed to Robert Walpole, as just vengeance for Admiral Hosier&#x27;s disastrous blockade of Porto Bello during 1726–1728, where with a greater force of 20 ships, and Portobelo inadequately defended, government orders forbade him from firing a shot, leaving him and some 4,000 sailors to linger ineffectually off the shore and to die of tropical disease. The ballad &quot;Admiral Hosier&#x27;s Ghost&quot; was written by Richard Glover following Vernon&#x27;s triumph as an attempt to remind Walpole of his previous failed policy of inaction and to check any basking in Vernon&#x27;s glory on his part. In the ballad, the ghost of Hosier appears to Vernon as he rests at anchor following his successful engagement, and congratulates him:

Unrepining at thy glory
Thy successful arms we hail.

He then charges him to &quot;let Hosier&#x27;s wrongs prevail&quot; when he returns to England, upon which he and his fellow ghosts can finally rest, their reputations restored. The first half of verse 7 is thus:

For resistance I could fear none
But with twenty ships had done
What thou brave and happy Vernon
Hast atchiev&#x27;d with six alone.
===Cartagena de Indias===

In 1741 he commanded a great fleet formed by one hundred and ninety-five ships and around thirty thousand men whose objective was to take the Spanish port of Cartagena de Indias, main port of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, defended by the Spanish admiral Blas de Lezo. The British fleet totaled two thousand cannons arranged in almost one hundred and eighty ships, including three-bridge ships (eight), ships of the line (twenty-eight), frigates (twelve), bombards (two) and transport ships (one hundred and thirty), and around thirty thousand combatants including sailors (fifteen thousand), soldiers (nine thousand regulars and four thousand from the American militias) and black slaves from Jamaica (four thousand).

The defences of Cartagena included three thousand men among regular troops (about one thousand seven hundred and eighty), militiamen (five hundred), six hundred Indians brought from the interior, plus the seamen and landing troops of the six warships that the city had (one hundred and fifty men): the &quot;Galicia&quot;, which was the captain ship, the &quot;San Felipe&quot;, the &quot;San Carlos&quot;, the &quot;África&quot;, the &quot;Dragón&quot; and the &quot;Conquistador&quot;. After taking some of the city&#x27;s defences, the British assault on the castle San Felipe de Barajas, the last important bastion defending it, failed on April 20; with a large part of the troops ill, heavy casualties suffered in the fighting and the arrival of the rainy season, the British opted to destroy the defences within their reach and abandon the siege.

British losses were very heavy: some four thousand five hundred dead, six ships lost and between seventeen and twenty badly damaged.4 The latter forced the British Government to concentrate its forces on the defence of the metropolis, the northern Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and to discard new campaigns in the Spanish colonies in America.4 The defeat at Cartagena derailed British plans for the campaign and allowed Spanish rule in the region to continue for several more decades.5 The British, certain that they were going to take the victory, had rushed to mint coins and medals to celebrate it.6 These medals read on their obverse: &quot;British heroes took Cartagena April 1, 1741&quot; and &quot;Spanish pride humiliated by Vernon. &quot;76

Vernon&#x27;s expedition continued its operations in the Caribbean without further success after the failed attack on Santiago de Cuba, thanks to the defence plan deployed by Governor Francisco Cagigal de la Vega and the French engineer Francisco de Langle.8 Vernon returned to England with the bulk of the fleet in 1742.

At the end of May 1741, the British forces in the Caribbean decided to attack Cuba. Vernon captured Guantánamo Bay, briefly renaming it Cumberland Bay. He arrived with a force of eight warships and 4,000 soldiers with plans to march on Santiago de Cuba, but finally abandoned the half-hearted attempt in December after sickness broke out again. Vernon could no longer hold back his anger at what he perceived as Wentworth&#x27;s ineptitude and a bitter quarrel ensued ending in the recall of both parties to Britain at the end of 1742.

==Further political career, naval innovation and death ==
While he had been away, Vernon had been elected MP for Ipswich, after having purchased the Orwell Park estate in Nacton, Suffolk. Vernon returned to Parliament and continued to harass the government on naval affairs. In 1745, Vernon was promoted to admiral and appointed to command the North Sea Fleet in response to the threat from the French forces in support of Charles Edward Stuart (&quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;). This was his last operational command. When the Admiralty refused to grant him the status of Commander-in-Chief, he asked to be relieved on 1 December 1745. Vernon&#x27;s naval career had, however, a controversial ending. He wrote two pamphlets about his disagreements with the Admiralty. The first was entitled &quot;A Specimen of Naked Truth from a British Sailor&quot; and the second &quot;Some Seasonal Advice from an Honest Sailor&quot;. As a result, the Admiralty brought the matter to King George II who advised to have his name removed from the navy flag list. He was dismissed on 11 April 1746. After this, his political career was seen to go into decline, although he held on to his Ipswich seat in the 1754 general election despite a stiff challenge.

Throughout his career, Vernon had tried to improve naval procedures and encouraged his captains to improve manoeuvres and gun drill. He introduced new instructions to improve the flexibility of handling fleets in battle and formed the basis of continuing improvement to Admiralty fighting instructions by subsequent naval commanders. Vernon continued to serve in Parliament and remained active in the interest of naval affairs until his death at Nacton on 30 October 1757.

His enduring claim to fame was his 1740 order that his sailors&#x27; rum should be diluted with water. In 1740, supposedly calling the new drink &quot;grog&quot; after Vernon&#x27;s nickname &quot;Old Grog&quot;, attributed to his habitual wearing of a grogram coat. Some writers have claimed that Vernon also added citrus juice to prevent spoilage and that it was found to prevent scurvy. Scurvy is not mentioned in Vernon&#x27;s order, in which he instructed his captains to dilute the sailors&#x27; daily allowance of rum with water, &quot;which those that are good husbandmen may from the saving of their salt provisions and bread, purchase sugar and limes to make more palatable to them.&quot;]

Scurvy, a disease of long ocean voyages—not of squadrons operating among islands where there was an abundance of fruits and fresh foodstuffs—was seen by the medical establishment (incorrectly) as the consequence of poor digestion and internal putrefaction.[4] Standard medical remedies focused on &#x27;gingering up&#x27; the system by imbibing a variety of (ineffective) fizzy or fermenting drinks. Until an official daily issue of lemon juice was introduced into the Royal Navy in 1795, scurvy continued to be a debilitating disease which destroyed men and disabled ships and whole fleets. Practical seamen and surgeons, however, had known from practical experience that vitamin C, in the form of citrus juice, cured scurvy. In 1795, in defiance of medical opinion, the Admiralty and the admirals introduced lemon juice and sugar as a regular part of the naval diet. When a few years later Spain allied itself with France and lemons became unobtainable, West Indian limes were substituted. It was from this time that British obtained the nickname &quot;limeys&quot;.

==Mount Vernon==
George Washington&#x27;s elder half-brother, Lawrence Washington, served on Vernon&#x27;s flagship HMS &quot;Princess Caroline&quot; (an 80-gun three-decker) as a captain of Royal Marines in 1741. He named his Virginia estate Mount Vernon in honour of his former commander, a name retained by George Washington.

<text>Vittorino Veronese (1 March 1910 – 3 September 1986) was an Italian anti-fascist lawyer and activist who served as UNESCO’s Director-General from 1958 to 1961. Before his appointment as UNESCO’s Director-General he served as Chairman of the Catholic Institute for Social Activity and of Azione Cattolica. From 1952 to 1956 he served on UNESCO’s board and was UNESCO’s chairperson from 1956 to 1958. Three years after the appointment as the Director-General, Veronese had to resign due to health concerns.

Veronese would continue to hold roles within the Catholic Church after his career with UNESCO, and to be prominent in the international sphere until his death in 1986 at the age of 76.

== Early life and career ==
Vittorino Veronese was born in a country town near Venice, Vicenza on 1 March 1910. His father worked in a local electric plant as a chief technician, and his mother was a school teacher.

Young Vittorino Veronese started school early and advanced with his scholastic peers. He was not proficient in sports, but would cite a passion for music later in life.

Veronese graduated from the University of Padua with a doctoral degree in law before he reached twenty-one. His thesis was about the right of Vatican citizenship. He worked as a lawyer for ten years after graduation, then started to pursue a career in the fields of sociology and education. He became a sociology instructor at the Institute of Social Sciences at Ateneo Angelicum University in Rome.

During the war years, he worked together with democratically-minded scholars and directed a review, named “Studium”. He became the editor of the review in a later year.

Veronese was a captain for a time in the infantry reserve and discharged during the war because of his suffering from arthritis. He served as a high officer during his twenties in the Catholic Movement of University Graduates and he was close with the Vatican-including activism there.

Veronese did not participate in the Fascist movement under the rule of Mussolini. During the early interwar period, he supported the rule of Giovanni Battista Montini, the future Paul VI. In 1939, at the age of twenty-nine, Veronese was invited by Montini to Rome and appointed to the position of general secretaryship of the Movimento Laureati (Catholic University Graduates’ Association) affiliated with Italia Catholic Action. His work mission was to expel Communists out of the postwar governments. The same year, he married Maria Petrarca, with whom he had seven children: Marialaura, Francesca, Paolo, Gianluca, Alberto, Lucia, and Pietro.

Between 1944 and 1946, he participated in the establishment of the Associazione Cattolica Lavoratori Italiani (ACLI), Italy&#x27;s future Catholic trade union association.

After 1944 and the collapse of fascism in Italy, Veronese was appointed the first lay President of Italian Catholic Action. In this capacity he would go on to hold many other prominent roles, including member of the Governing Board of the Foundation “Premi Roma” for youth, President of the Association of Refugee Intellectual in Italy, President of the Italian Central Institute of Credit, President of the “Consorzio di Credito per le Opere Pubbliche” and member of the executive committee of the Italian African Institute.

Vittorino Veronese would later be removed as President of Italian Catholic Action in 1952 by Pope Pius XII in favour of Luigi Gedda.

== UNESCO ==

As a well-known member the Italian Movement of Catholic graduates and Catholic Action, Veronese became active participant in the work of UNESCO after 1948. From 1952 to 1956 he served as a representative on UNESCO&#x27;s executive board, and was elected as the board&#x27;s chairperson between 1956 and 1958. He continued to hold this role until his appointment as UNESCO Director-General. He advocated for the importance of self-determination without discrimination in education as well as the importance of its inclusion of linkages to daily life. Veronese believed that education went along with the benefits of industrialization. As a UNESCO Director-General, Vittorino Veronese would lead member nations to sign the Paris Convention against Discrimination in Education in 1960.

Also in 1960, 19 newly independent African nations (including Burkina Faso, Chad, Gambia, and Nigeria) were granted membership. Special emphasis was placed on the “elimination of illiteracy” within the new African member nations, which resulted in the Addis Ababa Conference of African Ministers of Education, held May 15–25 of 1961. This was the first educational conference held by African leaders where the focus was determined by member nations and general concerns of middle Africa. From 1960, Veronese led the start of the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.

Vittorino Veronese followed the socio-cultural lead of predecessor Luther H. Evans and inaugurated Evans’ proposed “Special Fund” for extra-budgetary collection to support the launch of 37 teacher training programs in developing countries. This allowed for the later progress of UNESCO with the support of the UNDP and UNICEF across the 60 members.

After his work cementing this conference within development history, his term as the head of this committee continued until the beginning of his presidency at the Banco di Roma in 1961.

== Later life ==
Veronese resigned from the position of Director-General of UNESCO in 1961 and returned to Rome, which he cited as being due to illnesses. Veronese served as the head of the Banco di Roma until he retired in 1976. Even after his retirement, in the last ten years of his life, Veronese continued to volunteer in charitable initiatives and the international peace movement until his death in 1986.

Veronese was also involved in the creation of the Second Vatican Council in 1963, together with Frenchman Jean Guitton. Veronese was invited to address the council at St. Peter&#x27;s in support of “movement toward ecunism and the expanding role of laypeople in the Church” . Veronese was initially competing for the lay auditor position to the Second Vatican Council with Guitton, debating back and forth to decide which one of them should have the honor. Their speeches were regarded as “Attestations of Reverence” by the Roman Curia: “The Italian spoke simply and briefly; M. Guitton was more rhetorical”.

Following the council Veronese became a consultor to the secretariat of Nonbelievers. In &quot;LIFE&quot; magazine June 21, 1963 issue, Veronese was cited of his opinion on the selection of the new Pope due to his history being involved in Italian Catholic Association and his closeness to Montini, who will later take on the name Paul VI as Pope from 1963 to 1978. Veronese stated “for the first time, the Church is attempting to make a bridge between itself and the world. Now we can see that the Church and the world have the same frontiers”. In 1967 he was a member of the Pontifical Commission for Justice and Peace, in which he chaired the study Committee for the Problems of Peace and the International Community. In March 1972 he was appointed a member of the College of Lawyers of the Sacred Consistory.

In 1967, Veronese was awarded an honorary doctorate in law by Université Laval in Quebec. In 1967 he was a member of the Pontifical Commission for Justice and Peace, in which he chairs the study Committee for the Problems of Peace and the International Community. In March 1972 he was appointed a member of the College of Lawyers of the Sacred Consistory.

<text>Frank Washington Very (February 12, 1852 – November 23, 1927) was a U.S. astronomer, astrophysicist, and meteorologist. He was born in Salem, Massachusetts, and educated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1873) where he taught physics after his graduation.

After several years at MIT, Very was employed at the Allegheny Observatory at the University of Pittsburgh, where he worked from 1878–1895. In 1890, he became a professor and chair of astronomy at the University of Pittsburgh (then known as the Western University of Pennsylvania), concurrent with his post at Allegheny Observatory. He was then made professor and acting director of the Ladd Observatory at Brown University from 1896–1897. After his time at Brown, he worked as an independent researcher for nearly a decade until 1906, when he was appointed director of the Westwood Astrophysical Observatory in Westwood, Massachusetts.

Very&#x27;s most important work was in measuring the temperatures of the surfaces of the Moon and other planets using a bolometer. Samuel Pierpont Langley published in 1890 a widely read paper that included Very&#x27;s Moon observations, but for unknown reasons omitted his name from the list of contributors. In 1891, Very published his own paper, &quot;Distribution of the Moon&#x27;s Heat,&quot; which also included measurements taken during a lunar eclipse.

Infrared observations by Langley and Very, published in 1890, were used to make the first calculations of the greenhouse effect.

Very crater on Mars and Very crater on the Moon are named in his honor.

He also addressed the American Astronomical Society at Harvard College Observatory on August 20, 1918, with a paper titled: The Luminiferous Aether 1. Its Relation to The Electron and to A Universal Interstellar Medium 2. Its Relation to The Atom. He seemed to be inspired by Emanuel Swedenborg, a 1700&#x27;s mystic.

==Early life==
Jackson was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Her mother is of mixed African-American and Puerto Rican heritage.

==Acting==
From 1996 to 2001, Jackson played the titular character&#x27;s best friend, Niecy Jackson, on the UPN TV show &quot;Moesha&quot; (starring Brandy Norwood). She has also appeared on &quot;The Parkers&quot;, &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot;, and &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;. In 1997, Jackson co-starred in the Nickelodeon movie &quot;Good Burger&quot; alongside Kel Mitchell and Kenan Thompson. She was also featured on the ABC reality series &quot;The Ex-Wives Club&quot; with Marla Maples and Angie Everhart.

<doc id="754282" wikidata="Q728029" url="?curid=754282" title="Harold Budd">
<text>Harold Montgomory Budd (May 24, 1936December 8, 2020) was an American music composer and poet. Born in Los Angeles and raised in the Mojave Desert, he became a respected composer in the minimal music and avant-garde scene of Southern California in the late 1960s, and later became better known for his work with figures such as Brian Eno and Robin Guthrie. Budd developed what he called a &quot;soft pedal&quot; technique for playing piano, with use of slow playing and prominent sustain.

==Early life==
Budd was born in Los Angeles, California, and spent his childhood in Victorville, California on the southwestern edge of the Mojave Desert. 

Harold was only 13 when his father died, and soon his family fell out of their comfortable middle class existence. He was sent up to the desert to live with friends and relatives as often as possible, but the reality in Los Angeles was growing up in a tough neighborhood, and as the oldest son, being the man of the house. During this time Black culture had an enormous impact on Harold, especially jazz music and bebop, and he could be found in his teenage years playing drums in bars and jazz clubs in South Central Los Angeles.

Drafted into the army, he joined the regimental band where he played drums at Presidio of Monterey (POM). Jazz saxophonist Albert Ayler was drafted at the same time and was also a member of the band. Budd joined him in gigs around the Monterey area. Budd&#x27;s experience of the army made him determined to get an education.

==Education, academic career and early works==
Budd attended high school at Los Angeles High School, but did not graduate. He worked as &quot;everything from cowboy to mailman,&quot; including a stint at Douglas Aircraft. At the age of 21, he left Douglas, and briefly moved to San Francisco. While there, he worked at Gump&#x27;s. Unable to continue living in San Francisco, Budd returned to Los Angeles, and enrolled in an architecture course at Los Angeles City College. He switched to a course in harmony and renaissance counterpoint and his musical talent was spotted by a teacher who encouraged him to compose. He began to attend performances by artists like Chet Baker and Pharoah Sanders.

“From that moment on,” he recalls, “I had an insatiable appetite. Harmony, counterpoint, Renaissance music: I really heard it for the first time.”

Budd&#x27;s career as a composer began in 1962. In the following years, he gained a notable reputation in the local avant-garde community. Budd studied music at California State University, Northridge, under Gerald Strang (a protege of Arnold Schoenberg) and Aurelio de la Vega. He graduated from CSUN, and then went on full scholarship to the University of Southern California, under the tutelage of Ingolf Dahl, graduating in 1966. Budd&#x27;s work of this period was primarily minimalist drone music influenced by John Cage and Morton Feldman, as well as the abstract expressionist painter Mark Rothko, with whom he corresponded.

After completing his degree in composition in 1969, Budd took up a teaching position at the California Institute for the Arts. In 1970, he released his first piece, &quot;The Oak of the Golden Dreams&quot;, which he recorded with an early model Buchla modular synthesizer at the institute.

At the encouragement of Brian Eno and Marion Brown, he left CalArts for London. Soon afterwards, Budd gave up composition, disgusted by the &quot;academic pyrotechnics&quot; of the avant-garde community. 
In London, he found his composing community of Eno, Gavin Bryars, Michael Nyman, and the members of the Cocteau Twins.

In 2004, Budd and his wife moved to Monument House in Joshua Tree, California.

==Composer and recording artist==
In 1972, while still retaining his teaching career at the California Institute for the Arts, he resurfaced as a composer. Spanning from 1972 to 1975, he created four individual works under the collective title &quot;The Pavilion of Dreams&quot;. The style of these works was an unusual blend of popular jazz and the avant-garde. His 1972 work &quot;Madrigals of the Rose Angel&quot; was sent to English composer Gavin Bryars who passed it on to Brian Eno. Eno contacted Budd and brought him to London to record for his Obscure Records label.

Budd resigned from the institute in 1976 and began recording his new compositions, produced by Eno. Two years later, Harold Budd&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Pavilion of Dreams&quot; (1978), was released. The first performance of the piece was at a Franciscan church in California conducted by Daniel Lentz.&quot;

The work with Eno led Budd to shift his focus to studio-led projects, characterised by use of synthesisers and electronic treatments, often collaborating with other musicians. Budd developed a style of piano playing he deemed &quot;soft pedal,&quot; which can be described as slow and sustained. While he is often placed in the Ambient category, he emphatically declared that he was not an Ambient artist, and felt that he got &quot;kidnapped&quot; into the category.

His two collaborations with Eno, 1980&#x27;s &quot;The Plateaux of Mirror&quot; and 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Pearl&quot;, established his trademark atmospheric piano style. On &quot;Lovely Thunder&quot;, he introduced subtle electronic textures. His thematic 2000 release &quot;The Room&quot; saw a return to a more minimalist approach. In 2003, Daniel Lanois, a producer for U2 and Bob Dylan, and occasional collaborator with Brian Eno, recorded an impromptu performance of Budd playing the piano in his Los Angeles living room, unaware; it was released in 2005 as the album &quot;La Bella Vista&quot;.

He had a long-running collaboration with guitarist Robin Guthrie. They worked together initially when Budd worked with Guthrie&#x27;s band Cocteau Twins on their 1985 collaboration &quot;The Moon and the Melodies&quot;. The record was released by 4AD under all the collaborator&#x27;s names (rather than being a Cocteau Twins/Harold Budd record), with Budd being listed first as it was an alphabetical listing. In November 1986, the record charted on the UK Top 75 album chart, spending a week at number 46. Budd and Guthrie subsequently released several albums together, including two soundtracks to the Gregg Araki films &quot;Mysterious Skin&quot; (2004) and &quot;White Bird in a Blizzard&quot; (2014), with the last, 2020&#x27;s &quot;Another Flower&quot;, recorded in 2013 but only released four days before Budd&#x27;s death.

Budd also collaborated with Andy Partridge of XTC on the album &quot;Through the Hill&quot; (1994), John Foxx on the album &quot;Translucence/Drift Music&quot; (2003) and work with Jah Wobble on the &quot;Solaris&quot; concert and live album in 2002.

He composed music for the score of the 2020 miniseries &quot;I Know This Much Is True.&quot;

===Reception===
Brian Eno called Budd &quot;a great abstract painter trapped in the body of a musician&quot;.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; said, &quot;The core Budd sound of yearning piano motifs and reverb-laden impressionism is often called minimalism. But compared with the cyclical craft of Steve Reich and early Philip Glass, his low-key, expansive forays felt deftly maximalist. This has made Budd&#x27;s craft synonymous with the dreamworld. An heir to Satie and Debussy, his music was treated and poetic, never kneejerk nor incautious.&quot;

==Death==
Budd was undergoing therapy at a short-term rehabilitation facility after suffering a stroke on November 11, 2020. It was there he contracted COVID-19 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in California. He died from complications of the virus at a hospital in Arcadia, on December 8, 2020. He was 84.

<text>The Haute Cour () was the feudal council of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. It was sometimes also called the &quot;curia generalis&quot;, the &quot;curia regis&quot;, or, rarely, the &quot;parlement&quot;.

==Composition of the court==

The Haute Cour was a combination of legislative and judicial powers. It had its basis in medieval parliamentarian ideals: a sovereign desired the consent of his subjects in certain matters, such as taxation and obligations to conduct military service.

The court developed gradually during the early 12th century CE, along with the kingdom itself, in the aftermath of the First Crusade. Technically all vassals of the king which were subject to its decisions had the right to sit and vote, but in practice only the more wealthy nobles did so; certain nobles attended regularly and tended to serve as presiding judges when necessary. This developed into a system of higher nobles (direct vassals of the king) and lesser nobles (indirect vassals, who owed service to the higher nobles), with different privileges depending on idiosyncratic circumstances. Anyone who had committed perjury or had broken an oath (whether a higher or lesser noble) forfeited his right to speak and vote. Only four votes (the king and any three vassals) were required to form a quorum. 

The court could meet wherever necessary, not solely in Jerusalem. After around 1120 the court also included bishops, and according to tradition new crusaders were entitled to sit and vote; the first time this occurred was the Council of Acre on 24 June 1148 during the Second Crusade, when the fatal decision to attack Damascus was made. Later the masters of the military orders were entitled to sit and vote as well. During the 12th century there was also a smaller group of advisors to the king, but by the end of the century this group had fallen out of use.

==Duties of the court==
The court levied taxes on the inhabitants of the kingdom, and voted on military expeditions. A formal vote for war would mobilize all the vassals of the kingdom. The court was the only judicial body for the nobles of the kingdom, hearing cases of murder, rape, assault, wardship, debt, recovery of slaves, sales and purchases of fiefs and horses, default of service, inheritance, and treason. Punishments included forfeiture of land and exile, or in extreme cases, death. It was possible to escape punishment from the court by challenging all the appointed judges to a trial by combat and defeating them (but this was of course impractical and was never done). The court was also responsible for minting coins.

Most importantly, the court elected the king or his regent, or settled disputes between various claimants. Each new reign began with a meeting of the court, to formally recognize the new king and to swear an oath of homage to him. They also gave advice to the king and developed proper procedures for doing so, but in practise they could disagree with the king and override his wishes. Essentially, the king was only &quot;first among equals&quot; while sitting in the court, although he was recognized as its head (in the king&#x27;s absence the court was presided over by his seneschal).

==Factions within the court==
There tended to be two factions within the court, a so-called &quot;court party,&quot; consisting of the royal family, the patriarch, and their supporters, and the &quot;nobles&#x27; party&quot;, consisting of the higher nobility and the military orders. Disputes between the two factions were frequent. There was a major dispute during the co-reign of Melisende and her son Baldwin III, when Melisende refused to give up the crown after Baldwin came of age. Baldwin eventually gained the support of the nobility and was recognized as sole king. A second major dispute arose during the regency of Raymond III of Tripoli for the child-king Baldwin V, when the relative newcomer Guy of Lusignan was chosen by the court party over more experienced nobles. This decision would eventually lead to increased conflict with the Muslims and the fall of Jerusalem itself in 1187.

==The &quot;Assise sur la ligece&quot;==
Perhaps the most important piece of legislation passed by the court was Amalric I&#x27;s &quot;Assise sur la ligece&quot;. The &quot;Assise&quot; formally prohibited the illegal confiscation of fiefs and required all of the king&#x27;s vassals to ally against any lord who did so. Such a lord would not be given a trial, but would instead be stripped of his land or exiled. It also made all nobles direct vassals of the king, eliminating the previous distinction between higher and lesser nobles. This distinction still existed in reality, and although lesser nobles now had an equal voice in the court, the more powerful barons refused to be tried by lesser lords who were not their peers. The higher nobles were still able to judge the less powerful lords themselves. There were about 600 men eligible to vote in the Court according to the Assise.

==The court in the 13th century==
There was also a &quot;Cour des Bourgeois&quot; in the kingdom but in the 12th century the two do not seem to have met together. They began to do so in the 13th century when the capital of the kingdom had been moved to Acre, and the leaders of the merchant colonies in the coastal cities were also allowed to sit (but not vote). By this time central authority had eroded so much that the more powerful nobles often had their own courts. 

Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II opposed the authority of the court while he was staying in Acre during the Fifth Crusade, and it was temporarily abolished from 1232 to 1244. In its place the Commune of Acre was set up, which invoked the Assise against him, although his army was much larger than any force the remnant of the kingdom could muster. The Commune, unlike the Court, included the burgesses. Meanwhile, the &quot;Haute Cour&quot; of the Kingdom of Cyprus adopted basically the same structure.

==Significance==
Most of our information on the court comes from John of Ibelin&#x27;s description of it, written in the 1260s. His description was an idealized explanation of the laws and procedures, based on the idea that Godfrey of Bouillon, the first king of Jerusalem, had personally established it and that it had remained unchanged since then (in the 13th century Godfrey was already a legendary figure). This was not the case, although it did develop much more slowly than similar contemporary courts elsewhere in Europe. Unlike France or England, the kingdom was not developing into a centralized parliamentary government – in fact it developed the opposite way, with the king losing more and more power to the barons. The court had essentially fossilized the feudalism of northern France circa 1100; because the kingdom was constantly at war, covered so little land, had so few westerners, and survived in Jerusalem for less than a hundred years, it did not have a chance to develop into a true Parliament. 

John of Ibelin&#x27;s description, while useful, was taken too literally by later historians. In the 19th century, the court was commonly held to be the purest representation of feudalism in all of the Middle Ages, although today this is considered too simplistic. The court was in some ways a fairly typical feudal court, but was adapted to the specific circumstances of the crusades and of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

<doc id="754287" wikidata="Q1985811" url="?curid=754287" title="Nicky Gumbel">
<text>Nicholas Glyn Paul Gumbel (born 28 April 1955) is an English Anglican priest and author in the evangelical and charismatic traditions. He is known as the developer of the Alpha Course, a basic introduction to Christianity supported by churches of many Christian traditions. He was Vicar of Holy Trinity Brompton in the Diocese of London, Church of England from 2005 to 2022.

==Early life and education==
Nicky Gumbel was born on 28 April 1955 in London, England. He is the son of Walter Gumbel, a German secular Jew from Stuttgart whose licence to practise law in that city was withdrawn in one of the early Nazi purges. Walter Gumbel emigrated to Britain and became a successful barrister. Gumbel&#x27;s mother, Muriel, was a barrister and nominal Christian.

Gumbel was educated at Hill House School, an independent day preparatory school in Knightsbridge in London, followed by Eton College, an independent boys&#x27; boarding school near Windsor, in Berkshire. He studied law at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1976; as per tradition, his BA degree was later promoted to a Master of Arts (MA) degree.

He converted to Christianity while attending university in 1974. Gumbel also attended the Iwerne holiday camps founded by EJ &quot;Bash&quot; Nash; these were evangelical Christian holiday camps aimed at children from English public schools, aimed at preparing boys for future ministry at the highest level in the church. Further to the revelations in the Makin review cataloguing the sexual and physical abuse perpetrated on trainees by fellow-barrister John Smyth at these camps, Gumbel gradually distanced himself from Iwerne, and in subsequent editions of his 2011 book Bible in One Year, replaced the eulogy to Nash with a verbatim eulogy to John Collins.

==Life and career==
After graduating from university, Gumbel followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and became a practising barrister. Meanwhile, he became a regular worshipper at Holy Trinity Brompton Church, Knightsbridge. In January 1978, Gumbel married at the church Pippa, with whom he would go on to have three children.

In 1982, Gumbel announced his decision to leave the bar to train for ordination in the Church of England. In 1983 he began theological studies and training for ordained ministry at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford. He graduated with a BA degree in 1986; as per tradition, his BA degree was later promoted to an MA degree.

==Ordained ministry==
Gumbel was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon in 1986. After some difficulty in finding a curacy, he joined the staff of his &quot;home&quot; church of Holy Trinity Brompton (HTB) in the Diocese of London. He was ordained as a priest in 1987. In 1996, the Bishop of London appointed him Alpha Chaplain, though he remained at HTB as a curate. In 2005, Gumbel was officially installed as Vicar of Holy Trinity Brompton Church. The previous vicar, Sandy Millar, had retired from stipendiary ministry and became an assistant bishop in the Diocese of London.

In 2007, Gumbel was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Gloucestershire as recognition of his broad contribution to the wider church through Alpha.

He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to the Church of England.

===Alpha Course===
In 1990, Gumbel took over the running of the Alpha Course that had been running there since 1977. The course was transformed under his leadership from being one designed for new Christians to one primarily for those outside the church who would not consider themselves Christians. Gumbel serves as the public face of the course, being described by James Heard as something of a &quot;Weberian charismatic leader&quot;.

Gumbel is the author of a number of books related to the Alpha Course, including &quot;Questions of Life&quot; which has sold over 1,000,000 copies. Voted &quot;Christian Book of the Year&quot; in 1994, it has been published in 48 languages. Other related books include &quot;Why Jesus&quot;, &quot;Searching Issues&quot;, &quot;Telling Others&quot;, &quot;A Life Worth Living&quot;, &quot;Challenging Lifestyle&quot;, &quot;Heart of Revival&quot;, and &quot;30 Days&quot;.

<text>The Baronetcy of Temple, of Stowe, in the Baronetage of England, was created on the 24th of September 1611 for Thomas Temple, eldest son of John Temple of Stowe, Buckinghamshire. His great-grandson Sir Richard, 4th Baronet, was created Baron Cobham on 19 October 1714, and Viscount Cobham and Baron Cobham on 23 May 1718, the latter with a special remainder, failing his male issue (of which he had none) to his sisters and their heirs male. Upon his death on the 13th September 1749, the barony of 1714 became extinct. Both the viscountcy and barony of 1718 passed to his elder sister, and the baronetcy passed to his second cousin once removed William Temple, of Nash House, who became 5th Baronet. On the death of Sir William&#x27;s nephew Sir Richard Temple, 7th Baronet, on 15 November 1786, the baronetcy became dormant.

The Earldom of Temple was created in the Peerage of Great Britain on 18 October 1749 for Hester, 2nd Viscountess Cobham, a sister of Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham. She had been married in 1710 to Richard Grenville, of Wotton, Buckinghamshire, and at her death on 6 October 1752, she was succeeded by her eldest son Richard, who became 2nd Earl Temple. His nephew George, 3rd Earl Temple (son of his younger brother George Grenville, who served as Prime Minister), was created Marquess of Buckingham on 4 December 1784. His son Richard, 2nd Marquess of Buckingham and 4th Earl Temple, was created Duke of Buckingham and Chandos and Earl Temple of Stowe in the Peerage of the United Kingdom on 4 February 1822, the latter title with a special remainder to allow female descendants to succeed. On the death of the 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos on 26 March 1889, the Dukedom and Marquessate became extinct, as did the Earldom of 1749. The Earldom of 1822 passed to his nephew William Gore-Langton, son of his sister Lady Anna, and the Viscountcy of Cobham to his fourth cousin once removed, the 5th Lord Lyttelton and Westcote, a great-great-grandson of the younger sister of the 1st Viscount. Both these titles remain extant.

<doc id="754299" wikidata="Q4791291" url="?curid=754299" title="Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry">
<text>The Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation &amp; Reentry (ADCRR), commonly and formerly referred to as simply the Arizona Department of Corrections, is the statutory law enforcement agency responsible for the incarceration of inmates in 13 prisons in the U.S. state of Arizona. As of December 2015, the ADC manages over 42,643 imprisoned inmates and over 5,466 inmates who have been paroled or that are statutorily released. ADC is also in involved in recruitment and training of Correctional Officers at the Correctional Officer Training Academy (COTA) in Tucson, Arizona. The ADC is headquartered in Downtown Phoenix.

==Funding==
==Death row==
The men&#x27;s death row is located in Browning Unit of Arizona State Prison Complex – Eyman, and also Central Unit of Arizona State Prison Complex - Florence. The women&#x27;s death row is in the Lumley Unit of the Arizona State Prison Complex-Perryville. Executions occur at the Central Unit of the Arizona State Prison Complex – Florence. As of 2010, one Arizona death row inmate is confined in West Virginia.

== Facilities ==
There are currently forty-eight state prisons, geographically grouped into fourteen complexes and two correctional treatment facilities in Arizona. This number does not include federal prisons, detention centers for the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or county jails

As of 2007, Arizona had exported more than 2,000 prisoners to privately run facilities in Oklahoma and Indiana, a number that would have been higher if not for a riot of Arizona prisoners at the GEO Group&#x27;s New Castle Correctional Facility on April 27, 2007, protesting the practice. As of 2013, the states of Vermont, California and Hawaii export prisoners to facilities in Arizona.

== Incidents ==
In July 2014, a teacher was raped at the Meadows Unit of the Arizona State Prison Complex at Eyman. She had been left alone in a room with then 21-year-old Jacob Harvey, who stabbed her multiple times with a pen and raped her. The radio she was issued was tuned to a frequency not in use. The officers were found to have failed to make their required checks. The state settled the matter for an undisclosed amount and the Department of Corrections denies any wrongdoing.

In July 2015, at the medium security housing area at the Arizona State Prison-Kingman a four-day riot damaged facilities so extensively as to require major repairs. More than one thousand inmates had to be moved to other locations. The facility was being run by Management and Training Corporation under a contract with the department in which Director Charles L. Ryan failed to ensure contractual obligations were met.

In August 2015, Prisoner Cynthia Apkaw hanged herself in her cell. Officers had not made their required checks and later faked records to conceal their misconduct.

In February 2016, officers failed to conduct required checks on Scott Saba who hanged himself in his cell. His body was discovered by Correctional Officers who had finished their shifts and subsequently didn&#x27;t have the equipment required to provide aid.

In April 2016, thirteen prison staff were fired and six more disciplined as a result of an investigation into the two most recent prison suicides.

==Fallen officers==
Since 1967, nine officers have died while on duty.

<text>Greenmail or greenmailing is a financial maneuver where investors buy enough shares in a target company to threaten a hostile takeover, prompting the target company to buy back the shares at a premium to prevent the takeover.

Corporate raids involve hostile takeovers of undervalued companies, sometimes through asset stripping or pressuring the sale of valuable assets like real estate. Greenmailers may offer to sell back their shares to the target company at a premium, resulting in losses for the company and its shareholders.

The tactic was used by investors such as T. Boone Pickens and Sir James Goldsmith in the 1980s, who made profits by pressuring companies into repurchasing shares at a premium. For instance, Goldsmith&#x27;s group acquired stakes in companies like St. Regis, prompting buybacks at a higher price and yielding substantial profits.

Greenmail is a complex corporate strategy, but legal restrictions and counter-tactics, like imposing limits on formal bids and a 50% excise tax on gains in the United States, have made it less common since the early 1990s.

== Term ==
The term is a financial neologism, coined in the 1980s, from &quot;blackmail&quot; and &quot;greenback&quot; as commentators and journalists saw the practice of corporate raiders as attempts by well-financed individuals, or their operating companies, to blackmail a company into handing over money by using the threat of a takeover.

==Tactic==
Corporate raids occasionally aim to generate large amounts of money by hostile takeovers of large, often undervalued or inefficient (i.e. non-profit-maximizing) companies, by either asset stripping and/or replacing management and employees. In other circumstances, the greenmailer seeks out assets the target company has built up as equity, such as real estate, and attempts to have the target company dispose of those assets and lease them back via a recurring lease payment, while returning the sold-off real estate to shareholders as a special dividend.

The greenmail strategy has evolved since its first practices with ways to counter greenmail, other variations of greenmail, as well as ways to reinforce a greenmail tactic. 
In the area of mergers and acquisitions, the greenmail payment is made in an attempt to stop the hostile takeover.

One example of this practice was the attempted takeover by William Ackman&#x27;s Pershing Square Capital Management of American retailer Target, which had a large inventory of mature or nearly mature real estate properties in its corporate portfolio. Ackman attempted to have these assets spun off as an IPO, along with a partial sale of Target&#x27;s credit card unit and the execution of share buybacks, which reduce the number of shares outstanding by using corporate equity and earnings to repurchase existing shareholders&#x27; positions.

Once having secured a large share of a target company, instead of completing the hostile takeover, the greenmailer offers to end the threat to the victim company by selling his share back to it, but at a substantial premium to the fair market stock price.

From the viewpoint of the target, the ransom payment may be referred to as a goodbye kiss. The origin of the term goodbye kiss as a business metaphor is unclear. In reference to a President, Chairman, or CEO in charge of a target company being taken over, there are many situations in which a golden parachute is provided. A company which agrees to buy back the bidder&#x27;s stockholding in the target avoids being taken over. In return, the bidder agrees to momentarily abandon the takeover attempt and may sign a confidential agreement with the greenmailee, guaranteeing not to resume the maneuver for a period of time.

While benefiting the corporate raider, the company and the company&#x27;s shareholders lose money. Greenmail also momentarily protects the company&#x27;s existing management and employees from termination, demotion, or reduction in wages, which would have most certainly seen their ranks reduced or eliminated had the hostile takeover successfully gone through.

==Examples==
Greenmail proved lucrative for investors such as T. Boone Pickens and Sir James Goldsmith during the 1980s. In the latter example, Goldsmith made $90 million from the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in the 1980s in this manner. In 1984, Occidental Petroleum paid $194 million greenmail to David Murdock.

The St. Regis Paper Company provides an example of greenmail. When an investor group led by Sir James Goldsmith acquired 8.6% stake in St. Regis and expressed interest in taking over the paper concern, the company agreed to repurchase the shares at a premium. Goldsmith&#x27;s group acquired the shares for an average price of $35.50 per share, a total of $109 million. It sold its stake at $52 per share, netting a profit of $51 million. Shortly after the payoff in March 1984, St. Regis became the target of publisher Rupert Murdoch. St Regis turned to Champion International and agreed to a $1.84 billion takeover. Murdoch tendered his 5.6% stake in St. Regis to the Champion offer for a profit.

In a fictional context, greenmail tactics are prominently used in the 1987 film &quot;Wall Street&quot;. At one point, fellow corporate raider Sir Larry Wildman refers to Gordon Gekko as &quot;a two-bit pirate and a greenmailer.&quot;

=== 2024 Ohio case ===
In 2021, a plaintiff&#x27;s law firm tried to sue two so-called &quot;activist&quot; investors in a Franklin County, Ohio court, alleging that the investors violated Ohio&#x27;s law against greenmailing. Law firm Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd LLP represented the Corpus Christi Firefighters’ Retirement System and filed the suit against two investment firms. In the suit, the plaintiff alleged that Macellum and Ancora attempted to engage in a greenmail campaign against Big Lots, a publicly traded discount retailer. Ohio&#x27;s statute would force the investors to give up any profits it earned from ownership of Big Lots stock if they had engaged in greenmailing. However, the investors did not make any such attempt, according to RealClearMarkets. In March 2024, Ohio Judge Daniel Hawkins - who is running for the Ohio Supreme Court - dismissed the case.

=== Other cases ===
*&quot;Viacom Int&#x27;l, Inc. v. Icahn&quot;, 747 F. Supp. 205 (S.D.N.Y. 1990)
*&quot;Polk v. Good&quot;, 507 A.2d 531 (Del. 1986).

A Harvard Business School case study in 1990 pointed to the repeated use of greenmail attempts by the Walt Disney Company - &quot;a much criticized defensive tactic which Disney uses trying to buy enough time to fix its investment and financial strategies.&quot;

In 2003, Michael Ashcroft was criticised by the High Court judge, Mr Justice Peter Smith in &quot;Rock (Nominees) Ltd v RCO (Holdings) Plc&quot;. Smith condemned Ashcroft&#x27;s tactics in relation to the takeover of cleaning company RCO by the Danish firm ISS. Smith said,

==History==
Greenmail&#x27;s use, as a strategy, is one of many corporate finance tactics. The most cited 20th century legal precedents of stock manipulation, which set the foundation for tactics like Greenmail, were:

;Cases
*&quot;United States v. Charnay&quot;, 537 F.2d 341 (1976) Legal Precedent
*&quot;The United States v. Charnay&quot;, 577 F.2d 81 (1978) Legal Precedent
*&quot;United States v. Wolfson&quot;, 405 F.2d 779 (2d Cir.1968) illegal, Conviction
*Gilette and Revlon
*New World and Four Star

Significant pre-20th century precedents of stock manipulation, which set the foundation for tactics like Greenmail, were:

;Historic Examples
*Grant and Ward
*J.P. Morgan
*William Vanderbilt
*William Duer

==Prevention tactics==
Greenmail is a financially sophisticated corporate business tactic, and many counter-tactics have been applied to defend against and to financially engineer the reception of a greenmail. There is a legal requirement in some jurisdictions for companies to impose limits for launching formal bids. United States Federal tax treatment of greenmail gains (a 50% excise tax), legal restrictions, as well as counter-tactics have all made greenmail far less common since the early 1990s (see 26 U.S.C. § 5881, and 26 C.F.R. Part 156, notably § 156.5881-1 &quot;ff.&quot;).

Some U.S. states have enacted laws prohibiting greenmailing. In Ohio, for example, a state statute makes it illegal for someone who has made the intention of trying to acquire control of a company from disposing of their shares in that company within 18 months after making the intention. New York&#x27;s anti-greenmail law prohibits a corporation from buying back more than 10 percent of its stock from a shareholder for more than market value. It is only allowed if it is approved by both the board of directors and a majority of shareholders (excluding the shareholder in question attempting to sell back the stock).

<doc id="754309" wikidata="Q880369" url="?curid=754309" title="Leverett Saltonstall">
<text>Leverett Atholville Saltonstall (September 1, 1892June 17, 1979) was an American lawyer and politician from Massachusetts. He served three two-year terms as the 55th Governor of Massachusetts, and for more than twenty years as a United States senator (1945–1967). Saltonstall was internationalist in foreign policy and moderate on domestic policy, serving as a well-liked mediating force in the Republican Party. He was the only member of the Republican Senate leadership to vote for the censure of Joseph McCarthy.

==Early years==
Leverett Saltonstall was born on September 1, 1892 in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts to Richard Middlecott Saltonstall, an attorney, and Eleanor Brooks Saltonstall, an heiress to the Peter Chardon Brooks fortune. Both families had deep colonial roots which could be traced to the Mayflower and a circle of friends which included future President Theodore Roosevelt.

The Saltonstall family had deep colonial roots, as did that of his mother. Saltonstall was able to trace his ancestral roots to the &quot;Mayflower&quot;; his grandfather and great-grandfather, both also named Leverett Saltonstall.

Saltonstall was educated at the private Noble and Greenough School in Dedham and the Evans School for Boys in Mesa, Arizona, an upper-crust ranch school where his classmates included Nicholas Roosevelt.

He attended Harvard College, graduating in 1914. He was active in varsity sports at Harvard, notably captaining the first American crew to win the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta in 1914. He also played football and hockey, scoring a dramatic overtime goal in a 1914 win over Hobey Baker&#x27;s Princeton team.

He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1917. While at Harvard Law, he married Alice Wesselhoeft of Jaffrey, New Hampshire. They had six children.

==Military service and early political career==
After graduation, Saltonstall entered the United States Army. He served as a first lieutenant in the 301st Field Artillery Regiment in the 76th Division in World War I, spending six months in France. He was discharged in 1919, and then entered the law firm of his uncle.

Saltonstall, a socially progressive Republican, entered politics as an alderman in Newton, Massachusetts, serving from 1920 to 1922, while simultaneously serving as second assistant district attorney of Middlesex County under his uncle, Endicott Peabody Saltonstall, from 1921 to 1922. He was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives that same year; there he rose to the position of Speaker of the House, which he held from 1929 to 1937.

In 1930 Saltonstall became a compatriot of the Massachusetts Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.

==Governor of Massachusetts==
In 1936, Saltonstall decided to seek the Republican nomination for Governor of Massachusetts. In the party convention, conservative forces prevailed in securing the nomination for John W. Haigis. Saltonstall&#x27;s friends were able to engineer his nomination for lieutenant governor. Both Haigis and Saltonstall were defeated by their Democratic rivals, although Saltonstall&#x27;s margin of defeat, just over 7,000 votes, was small enough to merit a recount; he demurred. He ran again for governor two years later, and won a decisive victory over former Boston Mayor James Michael Curley, who had been involved in a bruising Democratic primary fight against the incumbent Charles F. Hurley.

He was reelected in 1940 and 1942; the 1940 election win was by an extremely narrow margin. During his tenure, Saltonstall mediated a Teamsters strike, reduced taxes, and retired 90 percent of the state&#x27;s debt. He served as president of the National Governors Association from 1943 to 1944. In 1944, he also served as the fifth president of the Council of State Governments.

==U.S. Senator==
In 1944, Saltonstall was elected to the United States Senate in a special election to fill the unexpired term created by the resignation of U.S. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. He was re-elected three times, serving from 1945 to 1967. Early in his first term, in April 1945 he was one of a dozen Senators and Congressmen who toured the Buchenwald Concentration Camp at the invitation of Gen. Dwight Eisenhower to attest to the reality of Nazi atrocities. Those he defeated included John H. Corcoran in 1944, John I. Fitzgerald in 1948, Foster Furcolo in 1954, and Thomas J. O&#x27;Connor in 1960. During his tenure in the Senate, he served as the Senate Republican Whip and on five influential Senate committees. He also served as the chair of the Senate Republican Conference, 1957–1967. He was viewed as a political moderate, and served as a mediating force between the party&#x27;s conservative and progressive wings. He was an unspectacular but effective legislator, good at drafting legislation and finding compromise language. When he left office, after more than thirty years in politics, he had few political enemies. Saltonstall voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Saltonstall was one of thirteen Republican senators to vote in favor of the creation of Medicare. As a senator, Saltonstall was described by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as neither liberal or conservative, but as being on the side of common sense.

== Personal life ==
In 1916, Saltonstall married Alice Wesselhoeft (1893–1981) of Jaffrey, New Hampshire. Together they had six children, including:

* Emily (1920–2006), at one time the daughter-in-law of Richard Byrd and a former WAVE;
* Peter Brooks Saltonstall, killed in action at the Battle of Guam in 1944; 
* William L. Saltonstall (1927–2009), a member of the Massachusetts Senate; and 
* Susan (1930–1994), a horse breeder.

==Death and legacy==
Saltonstall opted not to run for reelection in 1966, in part to provide an opportunity for his seat to Edward Brooke, a rising star in Massachusetts Republican circles. He retired to his farm in Dover, where he spent his remaining years as a gentleman farmer.

Leverett Saltonstall died of congestive heart failure in 1979 aged 86, and is buried in Harmony Grove Cemetery in Salem, Massachusetts. The Saltonstall Building in downtown Boston is named for him.

<text>Your Sinclair, or YS as it was commonly abbreviated, was a commercially published and printed British computer magazine for the Sinclair range of computers, mainly the ZX Spectrum. It was in circulation between 1984 and 1993.

==History==
The magazine was launched in January 1984 as Your Spectrum by Sportscene Specialist Press. (Sportscene would later be renamed to Dennis Publishing in April 1987.)

Initially, it was published bimonthly, changing to monthly in June 1984. With the January 1986 issue, the title was relaunched as &quot;Your Sinclair&quot;, with the intention of expanding coverage of the QL into the main magazine (previously, &quot;QL User&quot; had been a pull-out section within the magazine), and any future computers produced by Sinclair. However, the magazine remained focused almost entirely on the ZX Spectrum games scene.

In 1990, the magazine was sold to Bath-based Future plc, and the April 1990 issue was the first to be published by the new company. That issue&#x27;s news section contained a feature on the change in publishers, which jokingly suggested that Future had intended to buy a Sinclair C5 and had ended up buying the magazine by mistake.

Publishing of the magazine ended in September 1993, after the commercial life of the Spectrum ended and the magazine had shrunk to fewer than forty pages per issue. A 94th issue, a retrospective on the magazine, was published in 2004 and given away free with &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine. It featured interviews with some of the writers and reviewers from across the magazine&#x27;s history, a four-page memoir written by former staff writer Phil South, and several new reviews and tips, keeping the style of the original magazine throughout. 

The magazine introduced a unique writing style, inspired by launch editor Roger Munford and expanded upon by subsequent editors and writers. Influences can be found in titles ranging from &quot;Private Eye&quot; to &quot;Viz&quot;. Towards the end of the magazine&#x27;s life, and particularly under the editorship of Jonathan Nash, the style was further influenced by magazines &quot;YS&quot; had itself inspired, in particular &quot;Amiga Power&quot; and fanzine &quot;The Thing Monthly&quot;.

The original 1986 Your Sinclair team included Kevin Cox (editor), Teresa &quot;T&#x27;zer&quot; Maughan (deputy editor), Sara Biggs (production editor), Pete Shaw (editorial assistant), and Phil &quot;Snouty&quot; South (writer). Marcus Berkmann joined as staff writer in early 1987 when Maughan took over as editor. Freelance writers of the time included John Minson (writing under various pseudonyms, including Sue Denham, Gwyn Hughes and Rachael Smith), Mike Gerrard, Max Phillips, Tony Worrall and David McCandless. The final 1993 team consisted of just two permanent staff members: Jonathan Nash (editor) and Andy Ounsted (art editor). Steve Anderson, Rich Pelley, Tim Kemp, Simon Cooke, Dave Golder and Simon Forrester were among those working on a freelance basis.

==Content==

YS&#x27;s content varied widely, occasionally ignoring the subject of computers entirely. As the Spectrum scene diminished and there was less software to review, this happened more frequently. The tone of the magazine was inspired by teenage magazines such as Smash Hits and Just Seventeen. In 1992, under the editorship of Andy Hutchinson, several &#x27;lifestyle&#x27; type sections were introduced. These included &quot;Haylp!&quot;, an agony aunt column, and &quot;The World&quot; (later retitled &quot;Flip!&quot;), which contained reviews of films and books. This section included &quot;The Killer Kolumn From Outer Space&quot;, dedicated to science fiction news, rumours and reviews. It was written by Dave Golder, who went on to be the second editor of the successful &quot;SFX&quot;. Writing in the 100th issue of that publication, Golder cited his earlier work on &quot;YS&quot; and described &quot;SFX&quot; as &quot;like hundreds of Killer Kolumns stapled together&quot;. Flip! was discontinued, but the Killer Kolumn was kept on until the penultimate issue in 1993. A similar page to Flip!/The World had existed in 1987–88 called &quot;Street Life&quot;, but this had also contained Spectrum game charts.

===Pssst/Frontlines===
The news section was originally called &quot;Frontlines&quot; and dealt with Sinclair news and rumours. It also regularly contained mock celebrity interviews (such as the &quot;At The Bus Stop With...&quot; series) and trivial charts, as well as features about the writers themselves.

Subsections of Pssst and Frontlines included &quot;T&#x27;zers&quot;, a column which contained rumours about possible forthcoming releases for the Spectrum and, later on, the SAM Coupé. It was named after and originally written by Teresa Maughan, but the column remained after she left the magazine, as it was felt &#x27;T&#x27;zers&#x27; was an appropriate title since it contained &#x27;teasers&#x27; for future games. &quot;Rock Around The Clock&quot;, which first appeared in 1991, was a small column dedicated to looking at a particular back issue, as well as news and current affairs from the same time.

Perhaps one of the odder sections of &quot;Pssst&quot; was the &quot;Peculiar Pets Corner&quot;. Editor Matt Bielby originally intended this to be a showcase for &quot;YS&quot; readers&#x27; exotic pets such as snakes, pigs, monkeys or spiders, but these &quot;pets&quot; also included such things as a purple fruit gum and a tuba.

When an editor or member of the writing staff left, the magazine would often concoct fanciful stories surrounding their leaving. Matt Bielby was carted off to the funny farm after declaring himself to be God, Andy Ide became a Green Party ambassador, and Andy Hutchinson left to design a skate park at Alton Towers. In actuality, the majority of ex-&quot;YS&quot; staff went on to work for other magazines, such as &quot;Amiga Power&quot;.

===Reviews===
&quot;Your Sinclair&quot;″s reviewing system varied throughout the magazine&#x27;s life. During the &quot;Your Spectrum&quot; era, game reviews were confined to the &quot;Spectrum Soft&quot; section, later called &quot;Joystick Jury&quot;. Games were reviewed by a panel of reviewers and given a mark out of 10. In practice this was a score out of 9, since no game ever received a perfect 10, on the rationale that a better game could come along at a later date. After the name change to Joystick Jury, games were judged by each individual reviewer to be either a &#x27;hit&#x27; or a &#x27;miss&#x27; (in the manner of television show &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot;, after which it was named). The hit and miss system was abandoned with Issue 19, and with the transition to &quot;Your Sinclair&quot;, the review section was renamed &quot;Screen Shots&quot;. In Screen Shots, games were still rated out of ten, but they were also given separate ratings for graphics, playability, value for money and addictiveness. They were also now reviewed by individual writers, rather than a panel.

In 1988, Joystick Jury was superseded by Joystick Jugglers, and the familiar cartoons of reviewers were introduced. Screen Shots was removed as a self-contained section in 1989, and reviews began to appear throughout the magazine, generally with the bigger games being reviewed towards the front. Budget games had their own section, &quot;Bargain Basement&quot; (later replaced with &quot;Replay&quot; when it was felt that original budget games should be reviewed alongside full price games). The magazine also began using a rating out of 100, rather than ten, when reviewing games. However, this was referred to as a &#x27;degree scale&#x27; rather than a percentage scale, with a graphic of a thermometer representing the rating; the higher the rating, the &quot;hotter&quot; the game. Reviewer Jon Pillar embraced both extremes of the review scale, giving &quot;Count Duckula 2&quot; a mere 9˚ and &quot;Mercenary&quot; 99˚. The final change in review style came in late 1992 when the various ratings for addictiveness, graphics, and so forth were replaced by a summary of the game&#x27;s good and bad points, with an overall mark (now as a percentage) below that.
Games which were scored at more than 90˚/90%, or 9/10 before the degree scale was introduced, were awarded &quot;YS&quot; coveted &quot;Megagame&quot; status, though this was undermined slightly when Duncan MacDonald gave it to his own deliberately bad Sinclair BASIC creation, &quot;Advanced Lawnmower Simulator&quot;, in a moment of surreal humour. The logo was used in advertisements for games, big and small. Reader games were also reviewed for a while in the &quot;Crap Games Corner&quot;, many being inspired by &quot;Advanced Lawnmower Simulator&quot; or being just as deliberately bad. Good reader games sometimes ended up on the covertape.

YS reviewers were often &#x27;interviewed&#x27; in a column at first called &quot;Joystick Jury&quot; (the same as the reviews section in &quot;Your Spectrum&quot;), then &quot;Joystick Jugglers&quot;, and finally (when there were fewer games to review and they wanted to introduce the team as a whole, including design staff) &quot;The Shed Crew&quot;, a reference to the recurring joke that after the move to Future Publishing, their office was now a garden shed. The Jugglers were depicted with caricatures mostly drawn by Nick Davies, although some writers (such as Jon Pillar/Jonathan Nash) drew their own and art editor Andy Ounsted drew most of the latter reviewers. The Juggler caricatures took on something of a life of their own, and in 1990, a game, &quot;YS Capers&quot;, was given away with the magazine in which you had to shoot the &quot;YS&quot; crew, depicted in their cartoon forms.

===Tipshop===
Originally, the tips section of the magazine was called &quot;Hack Free Zone&quot;, to distinguish it from &quot;Hacking Away&quot;, which was dedicated to type-in POKEs. Hacking away was written by Chris Wood and &quot;ZZKJ&quot;, while Hex Loader was written by Phil South under the pseudonym of Hex Loader. The sections were merged in 1987 to become the &quot;Tipshop&quot;.

It contained all tips, cheats and complete solutions sent in by readers, and spawned its own book, the &quot;YS Tipshop Tiptionary&quot;. &quot;Dr. Berkmann&#x27;s Clinic&quot; (renamed &quot;The YS Clinic With Dr. Hugo Z Hackenbush&quot; after Marcus Berkmann left to go freelance), originally set up to provide help for the game &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;, allowed readers to provide solutions to each other&#x27;s gaming problems, more often than not solved by Richard Swann. &quot;Practical Pokes&quot;, hosted mainly by Jon North, was the successor to Hacking Away, and contained both type-in and Multiface POKEs. The Tipshop was hosted variously by Phil South, David McCandless, Jonathan Davies and Linda Barker.

===Technical sections===
While &quot;YS&quot; is often thought of as primarily a games magazine, throughout its life it hosted a variety of technical columns, mainly dedicated to programming technique.

&quot;Program Pitstop&quot;, first hosted by David McCandless, then Jonathan Davies and finally Craig Broadbent, contained type-in programs and was one of the last columns of its kind, a remnant of an era when computer magazines would dedicate entire sections to BASIC program listings. Most of the programs were in Sinclair BASIC, although some were in hexadecimal machine code, for which a special interpreter, the Hex Loader, was written. It replaced the pull-out section &quot;Program Power&quot;; the main difference was that Program Pitstop mainly included listings for utility programs and demos (for example, a level editor for games such as Atari&#x27;s &quot;Gauntlet&quot;), while Program Power also included games. Program Pitstop also featured contributions from well known programmers, such as the Rainbow Processor by Dominic Robinson, which allowed the Spectrum to display more than two colours per character.

&quot;Spec Tec&quot; (Adam Waring) and its descendant &quot;Spec Tec Jr&quot; (Simon Cooke) were home to readers&#x27; technical queries. The introduction to these columns were typically written in the style of a Philip Marlowe monologue, occasionally including ongoing plots.

Other technical columns included &quot;Rage Hard&quot;, an occasional page which brought news of peripherals and other enhancements for the Spectrum; &quot;Steve&#x27;s Programming Laundrette&quot;, in which Steve Anderson took the reader step-by-step through producing a BASIC game; and Simon Hindle&#x27;s &quot;Dial Hard&quot;, which helped you connect a Spectrum to the Internet.

Before the magazine&#x27;s relaunch as &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; in 1986, &quot;Your Spectrum&quot; contained a plethora of technical articles, including guides on programming in machine code and Forth, and information on how to upgrade the basic Spectrum set-up to incorporate better sound and more memory.

===Letters===
From the magazine&#x27;s inception, letters were answered mainly by the magazine&#x27;s editor. The letters page contained several subsections, which varied through the magazines&#x27; lifetime, but included:
*&quot;Small Print&quot; – either deliberately short letters, or parts of longer letters taken out of context, most often for comedy value.
*&quot;Doodlebugs&quot; – readers&#x27; cartoons, often based around puns on current Spectrum games (e.g. a cartoon based on the game &quot;Midnight Resistance&quot; showed a house with the bedroom light on and a speech bubble saying &quot;Not tonight dear, I&#x27;ve got a headache&quot;). Doodlebugs spawned one of &quot;YS&quot; occasional comic strips, &quot;Ernie The Psychotic Madman&quot;, drawn by Phil McCardle.
*&quot;Kindly Leave The Stage&quot; – readers&#x27; jokes, often nonsensical or surreal (an example being &quot;Q: Why is an orange orange? A: Because you can&#x27;t clean a window with a spade&quot;), and often met with a gong.
*&quot;Wonderful World of Speccy&quot; – letters from readers for whom English was not their first language, many from Eastern Europe, where the Spectrum scene was flourishing well into the early 1990s.
*&quot;Trainspotters&quot; – where readers would send in mistakes they&#x27;d noticed in a previous issue of the magazine, in the hopes of convincing the editor to send them a Trainspotter Award. Most of the time, however, the editor found a way out of sending the award, by coming up with convoluted reasons why the &#x27;mistake&#x27; wasn&#x27;t a mistake at all (for example, by insisting there was no such place as the Isle of Man after accidentally omitting it from a map in Issue 50). The Trainspotter caricature was supposedly based on the man pictured on the cover of Issue 1 of &quot;Your Spectrum&quot;. As with the Jugglers, this was drawn by Nick Davies. The last ever award was given to Stuart Campbell, a then former writer who had since left, who found a mistake in a reprint of an article that he wrote.
*&quot;The Picos&quot; – a fictional family created for a series of columns in the letters page. Firstly there was Madame Pico, a psychic and agony aunt who answered readers&#x27; problems with &quot;ooh, you poor dear&quot;. After her kidnapping, her son Bud Pico, a DIY specialist, took over. His solutions to readers&#x27; DIY problems often involved Rice Krispies. After Bud&#x27;s &quot;death&quot;, the baton was passed to cousin Femto Pico, a scientist and nightclub bouncer, and finally, Femto&#x27;s sister Soya Pico, a vegetarian hippy. Most of the letters to the Picos were fictional.
*&quot;Norman Tebbit&#x27;s Dead Serious Corner&quot; (originally &quot;Peter Snow&#x27;s Dead Serious Corner&quot;) – one of the last additions to the letters pages, containing, as the name suggests, more serious letters than the rest of the pages. These often dealt with consumer issues, such as the price of games, or declining software support for the Spectrum.

The Star Letter was awarded three full-price Spectrum games. When asked what qualities a star letter possessed, editor Linda Barker answered &quot;A star letter is one that makes the entire Shed crew rock with mirth, or touches their hearts&quot;, although other editors had their own criteria for the type of letter they awarded Star Letter status to.

Like many later computer magazines (such as &quot;Zero&quot; and &quot;Amiga Power&quot;) &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; created a sense of community with its readers through the letters page, and many readers wrote in regularly, becoming almost part of the team themselves. Indeed, several letter writers went on to write for &quot;YS&quot; in a freelance capacity, including Leigh Loveday and Rich Pelley. Along with Jonathan Davies, Pelley had formerly written for the fanzine &quot;Spectacular&quot;, and both became regular contributors for the magazine between 1988 and 1993. After &quot;YS&quot; closed, Davies went on to become editor of &quot;Sega Zone&quot;, &quot;Amiga Power&quot; and &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, while Pelley regularly wrote articles for a number of magazines. 

===Cover tape===
By October 1988, the magazine had committed itself to including a cover tape every month. Content typically included an older full game, and a specially-made single-level demo of a new, high-profile game such as Cybernoid II or Power Drift. Other content included game soundtracks and user-submitted demos. In December 1988, the magazine became the first to include two tapes.

==Official Top 100 games==
Between October 1991 and January 1992, contributor Stuart Campbell compiled his list of the Top 100 ZX Spectrum games of all time. In the months leading up to the final issue, readers were invited to vote on their ten favourite games, which was then compiled into a &#x27;readers choice&#x27; top 100, which was published in the final issue alongside Stuart Campbell&#x27;s list. 

==&quot;YS2&quot;==
As reduced advertising and lack of material to review caused &quot;YS&quot; page numbers to drop, the magazine introduced &quot;YS2&quot;, which was incorporated on the cover tape, and contained a teletext-like viewer program and a collection of around fifty extra pages of content largely written by then editor Jonathan Nash and regular contributor Steve Anderson. It contained, amongst other things, short stories, surrealist and absurdist humour, and &quot;Private Eye&quot;-style news satire.

The code for &quot;YS2&quot; had been taken (supposedly without permission) from adventure game company Delta 4&#x27;s similar &quot;Sceptical&quot; program. The writers often jokingly referred to a possible lawsuit against them, and wrote as an acknowledgement &quot;The Sceptical driver is copyright Delta 4, who are really nice and hardly ever sue&quot;.

In 1999, a webzine, &quot;YS3&quot;, was launched by comp.sys.sinclair newsgroup regulars Nathan Cross and Jon Hyde, and managed to recreate something of the original magazine&#x27;s style and humour. It ran irregularly until 2002. It has since returned in blog form.

<doc id="754322" wikidata="Q689998" url="?curid=754322" title="Oral contract">
<text>An oral contract is a contract, the terms of which have been agreed by spoken communication. This is in contrast to a written contract, where the contract is a written document. There may be written, or other physical evidence, of an oral contract – for example where the parties write down what they have agreed – but the contract itself is not a written one.

In general, oral contracts are just as valid as written ones, but some jurisdictions either require a contract to be in writing in certain circumstances (for example where real property is being conveyed), or that a contract be evidenced in writing (although the contract itself may be oral). An example of the latter is the requirement that a contract of guarantee be evidenced in writing, which is found in the Statute of Frauds.

Similarly, the limitation period prescribed for an action may be shorter for an oral contract than it is for a written one.

The term &quot;verbal contract&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for oral contract. However, since the term &quot;verbal&quot; could also mean just &quot;using words&quot;, not only &quot;spoken words&quot;, the term &quot;oral contract&quot; is recommended when maximum clarity is desired.

== Enforcement ==

Provided that an oral contract satisfies any requirements imposed by law, such a requirement that contracts for a specific type of transaction be in writing, it is legally enforceable.

For example, in 1984, Getty Oil was sold to Pennzoil in a handshake deal, a lay term for an oral contract, which was binding under New York law. Texaco later made a higher offer, and the company was sold to Texaco. Pennzoil filed a lawsuit alleging tortious interference with the oral contract and, after prevailing in court, was awarded $11.1 billion in damages, later reduced to $9.1 billion plus interest and penalties.

In a United Kingdom case, &quot;RCS Contractors Ltd v. Conway&quot;, the parties to an otherwise valid oral contract for construction services disagreed as to whether they had entered a single oral contract for work at three sites, or three separate contracts, one for each work site. Without a written agreement, the court had to examine other evidence to attempt to discern the intent of the parties, ultimately concluding that the parties were operating under a single contract.

<doc id="754323" wikidata="Q578391" url="?curid=754323" title="Josie and the Pussycats (film)">
<text>Josie and the Pussycats is a 2001 musical comedy film co-produced by Universal Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures. Written and directed by Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan, the film is based on both the Archie Comics series and the Hanna-Barbera cartoon of the same name. Filmed entirely in Vancouver, Canada, the film features Rachael Leigh Cook, Tara Reid, and Rosario Dawson as the Pussycats, with Alan Cumming, Parker Posey, Gabriel Mann, Paulo Costanzo, and Missi Pyle in supporting roles.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack album was well received, charting at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and quickly achieving Gold status. The film received mixed reviews, and was a commercial failure upon its initial release. It later gained some success as a cult film.

==Plot==
The members of successful boy band DuJour, signed to the pop music record label MegaRecords, confront Wyatt Frame, an executive with the label, on their private jet, expressing innocent concern about a strange backing track they have discovered on their recent single &quot;DuJour Around the World&quot;. After the band members get into a fight, Wyatt and the plane&#x27;s pilot parachute out of the jet, leaving it to crash with the band still on board, presumably &quot;killing&quot; them.

Landing outside the town of Riverdale, Wyatt begins searching for a replacement band for DuJour, eventually discovering struggling local rock band The Pussycats: lead vocalist and guitarist Josie McCoy, drummer Melody Valentine, and bassist and backup vocalist Valerie Brown. The group accepts Wyatt&#x27;s immediate offer of a major record deal despite its seeming implausibility, and they are soon flown to New York City with their manager Alexander Cabot, his sister Alexandra, and Josie&#x27;s love interest Alan M. Wyatt renames the band &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; without their permission, making them very uncomfortable.

Meanwhile, MegaRecords CEO Fiona, in an underground meeting with world government representatives, details how the United States government has conspired with the music industry to hide subliminal messages in pop music to indoctrinate teenagers into buying consumer products as part of a new trend each week, thus helping to build a robust economy from the money the teenagers earn from minimum wage jobs such as babysitting. Musicians who discover the hidden messages are made to disappear via staged plane crashes, drug overdoses and similar disasters.

The band&#x27;s first single &quot;Pretend to Be Nice&quot; is released and, due to subliminal messaging, instantly becomes successful, soon topping the charts. However, Valerie increasingly resents the attention the label gives Josie rather than the band as a whole, while Melody&#x27;s uncanny behavioral perception makes her suspicious of Fiona and Wyatt. Fiona orders Wyatt to kill the pair before they uncover the conspiracy. The Pussycats are sent to a fake appearance on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; where Carson Daly and a Carson Daly impersonator (Aries Spears) attempt to kill them with baseball bats, though the girls survive due to their attackers&#x27; incompetence.

Rather than allow her to attend a gig by Alan M, claiming it was canceled, Wyatt instead gives Josie a copy of the group&#x27;s latest single &quot;You Don&#x27;t See Me&quot;, which contains a subliminal message track designed to brainwash her into desiring a solo career. After arguing with her bandmates, Josie realizes that the single caused the fight. Her suspicions are confirmed when she uses a mixing board to amplify the subliminal track. However, Fiona catches her unawares.

MegaRecords have organized a giant pay-per-view concert that will be streamed online, wherein they plan to unleash a major subliminal message via themed cat-ears headsets that viewers must buy to hear the audio. Fiona and Wyatt plan for Josie to perform solo, but when the band insists on performing together, the pair hold Melody and Valerie hostage, threatening to kill them in a staged car explosion if they do not comply. However, the badly injured members of DuJour arrive and thwart the pair&#x27;s plan, having survived the plane crash by landing the plane in the middle of a Metallica concert, where they were severely assaulted by fans.

The trio fight Fiona, Wyatt and their security guards. During the tussle, Fiona accidentally destroys the Megasound 8000, the machine used to generate the messages, revealing the new subliminal message to be one that would make Fiona universally popular. Fiona suffers a breakdown and reveals that her lisp made her a social outcast in high school, while Wyatt reveals that his appearance is a disguise. He went to the same high school as Fiona, but was a persecuted and unpopular albino, and the two immediately bond. The government agents colluding with Fiona arrive, but with the conspiracy exposed, they arrest the pair as scapegoats to cover up their involvement in the scheme. They abandon the idea of spreading subliminal messages via music, deciding that movies are far more effective.

Josie, Valerie, and Melody perform the concert together. Alan M arrives and confesses his love for Josie, who returns his feelings. The concert audience removes their headsets at Josie&#x27;s suggestion and, able to judge the band on its own merits for the first time, roar their approval.

==Cast==
Johnny Depp, Gwen Stefani, Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears and Matt Damon appear as cardboard cut-outs during the TRL scene.

==Production==
Maggie Gyllenhaal and Zooey Deschanel both auditioned for the role of Josie, and while Kaplan and Elfont were enamored with the latter, the studio did not want to cast an unknown. Beyoncé, Aaliyah and Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes auditioned for the role of Valerie. Lopes in particular was very interested in the role and read for it twice. Elfont stated that they wanted someone who was well versed in comedy, noting that Beyoncé was &quot;quiet and shy&quot; and Aaliyah was &quot;serious and thoughtful&quot;. Reid did not have to audition for the role of Melody, due to her popularity with the studio after the success of &quot;American Pie&quot; (1999).

Cook later expressed surprise at her casting: &quot;somehow, they gave one of the title roles to me, and I cannot sing at all. I don&#x27;t play guitar. I have no idea.&quot; Cook said the producers considered her for the titular lead in &quot;Josie&quot; after having remembered Cook from her audition for the lead role in &quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait&quot; (1998); both films were co-written and directed by Kaplan and Elfont.

Cook&#x27;s singing voice in the film was provided by Kay Hanley of the band Letters to Cleo, while backing vocals were provided by Cook, Reid, Dawson, and Bif Naked. Although the actresses did not perform the instrumentation on the songs themselves, they took music lessons in order to look as if they were playing the songs in the film. The trio went through a &quot;band camp&quot; with the rock band Powder, learning their characters&#x27; instruments and rehearsing the songs for several months before filming.

In line with its theme of subliminal advertising, the inordinate degree of product placement in the film constitutes a running gag. Almost every scene features a mention or appearance of one or more famous brands, including Sega and the Dreamcast (Sega&#x27;s mascot Sonic the Hedgehog also appears in Archie Comics), Motorola, Starbucks, Gatorade, Snapple, Evian, Target, Aquafina, America Online, Pizza Hut, Cartoon Network (which has aired the cartoon series on many occasions), Revlon, Kodak, Puma, Advil, Bounce, and more. None of the advertising was paid promotion by the represented brands; it was inserted voluntarily by the filmmakers.

==Soundtrack==

Released by Sony Music Soundtrax and Playtone Records on March 27, 2001, &quot;Josie and the Pussycats: Music from the Motion Picture&quot; was well-received and was certified gold for sales of 500,000 copies. The album peaked at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

The soundtrack was reissued on vinyl by Mondo in 2017.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed $14,866,015 at the U.S. box office, less than its production budget, an estimated $22–39 million, resulting in a domestic box office bomb. Kaplan and Elfont both later attributed the film&#x27;s failure to their lack of consideration of the fact that the film would be marketed to pre-pubescent girls: &quot;I don&#x27;t know why we weren&#x27;t thinking that based on the property, we kind of forgot that&#x27;s who they were going to sell it to, but that&#x27;s when that panic set in. They&#x27;re not going to sell it to the people who are going to understand this movie, and the people they&#x27;re selling it to aren&#x27;t going to get it. And that&#x27;s kind of what happened.&quot;

===Critical reception===
The film received mixed reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 53% based on reviews from 125 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;This live-action update of &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; offers up bubbly, fluffy fun, but the constant appearance of product placements seems rather hypocritical.&quot; On Metacritic, the film scores a 47 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a B grade on a scale from A to F.

Roger Ebert gave the film one-half of a star out of a possible four, commenting that &quot;Josie and the Pussycats are not dumber than the Spice Girls, but they&#x27;re as dumb as the Spice Girls, which is dumb enough&quot;. Ebert had given the British girl group&#x27;s 1997 feature film &quot;Spice World&quot; the same rating. Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; gave a positive review in which he praised the film&#x27;s satire, music, and performances. Leydon wrote, &quot;Sensationally exuberant, imaginatively crafted and intoxicatingly clever, &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; shrewdly recycles a trifling curio of 1970s pop-culture kitsch as the linchpin for a freewheeling, candy-colored swirl of comicbook adventure, girl-power hijinks and prickly satirical barbs.&quot; He concluded, &quot;To a degree that recalls the flashy Depression era musicals and the nuclear-nightmare horror shows of the &#x27;50s, pic vividly conveys key aspects of the zeitgeist without ever stinting on the crowdpleasing fun and games. It&#x27;s made for the megaplexes, but it&#x27;s also one for the time capsule.&quot;

===Proposed TV series===
A month before the film was released, DiC Entertainment, an animation studio with extensive ties to Archie Comics, announced it had bought the rights to create a cartoon featuring the characters, and was planning to release it in the wake of the film. However, these plans never came to fruition.

==Legacy and reappraisal==
In the years subsequent to its initial release, &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; has been reappraised by critics, and has found success as a cult film. The film has been praised for its satirical take on American pop culture, and for its prescience in satirizing product placement and the corporatization of the music industry. A year after the film&#x27;s release, Kaplan met U2 frontman Bono, who told her he loved the film. Elfont later elaborated that Bono &quot;totally got it. That was within a year of it coming out, when we still thought people were going to get it and it would open people&#x27;s eyes up to the music business. ... Until social media, we would always say, &#x27;Well, at least Bono got it.&#x27;&quot;

Evaluating the film for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; in 2009, Nathan Rabin opined that the film is &quot;funny, sly and sweet&quot; and &quot;a sly, sustained spoof of consumerism&quot;, rating the film as a &quot;secret success&quot;. Mikael Wood of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote in 2017 that the film&#x27;s &quot;sharply satirical vision of the hyper-commercial record industry feels only more relevant.&quot;

On September 26, 2017, to commemorate the first vinyl release of the film&#x27;s soundtrack, &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; was screened by Alamo Drafthouse at the Ace Hotel in Los Angeles, followed by a Q&amp;A panel with Kaplan, Elfont, Cook, Reid, and Dawson and a performance of songs from the film by Hanley. Additionally, an oral history on the film was featured in &quot;The Fader&quot;.

DuJour appears in the 2021 &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; special &quot;The Bleepin&#x27; Robot Chicken Archie Comics Special&quot;, with Green, Meyer and Faison reprising their roles and Cook reprising her role of Josie.

==Home media==
&quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; was released on VHS and DVD by Universal Studios Home Video on August 21, 2001. The film&#x27;s theatrical PG-13 rating from the MPAA in the United States caused some contention with licenser Archie Comics, and a &quot;Family-Friendly&quot; PG-rated version was released alongside the theatrical version on home media. The &quot;Family-Friendly&quot; version omitted a great deal of profanity and sexual references. The theatrical version was presented in the Widescreen (1.85:1) format while the &quot;Family-Friendly&quot; version was presented in the Full Screen (1.33:1) format.

The movie was released on home media internationally by MGM Home Entertainment (through 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment) on December 17, 2001.

To coincide with the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary, the film was released on Blu-ray for the first time through Mill Creek Entertainment on September 21, 2021, with most of the extras from the DVD release carried over.

<doc id="754326" wikidata="Q1458645" url="?curid=754326" title="Symmachus (translator)">
<text>Symmachus (; &quot;ally&quot;; fl. late 2nd century AD) was a writer who translated the Old Testament into Greek. His translation was included by Origen in his &quot;Hexapla&quot; and &quot;Tetrapla&quot;, which compared various versions of the Old Testament side by side with the Septuagint. Some fragments of Symmachus&#x27;s version that survive, in what remains of the &quot;Hexapla&quot;, inspire scholars to remark on the purity and idiomatic elegance of Symmachus&#x27; Greek. He was admired by Jerome, who used his work in composing the &quot;Vulgate&quot;.

==Life==
Eusebius inferred that Symmachus was an Ebionite (Ἐβιωνίτης Σύμμαχος &quot;Symmachus the Ebionite&quot;), but this is now generally thought to be unreliable. The alternative is that he was a Samaritan who converted to Judaism. Epiphanius&#x27; account that Symmachus was a Samaritan who having quarrelled with his own people converted to Judaism is now given greater credence, since Symmachus&#x27; exegetical writings give no indication of Ebionism. At some time in his life, he had also written a commentary on the Aramaic Gospel of Matthew, known then as &quot;According to the Hebrews&quot;.

=== Symmachus ben Joseph ===

A rabbi from the time of the Mishnah, named Symmachus ben Joseph, is identified by some with Symmachus the translator; others hold the claim to be unfounded, although Epiphanius of Salamis puts Symmachus within the time-frame of Rabbi Meir, saying that Symmachus had converted to the Jewish religion after being a Samaritan. The rabbinic Symmachus was a student of Rabbi Meir, and his teachings are mentioned in the Mishnah under the name &quot;Sūmkos&quot; ().

==His translation==
According to Bruce M. Metzger the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures prepared by Symmachus followed a &#x27;theory and method... the opposite of that of Aquila&#x27;:for his aim was to make an elegant Greek rendering. To judge from the scattered fragments that remain of his translation, Symmachus tended to be periphrastic in representing the Hebrew original. He preferred idiomatic Greek constructions in contrast to other versions in which the Hebrew constructions are preserved. Thus he usually converted into a Greek participle the first of two finite verbs connected with a copula. He made copious use of a wide range of Greek particles to bring out subtle distinctions of relationship that the Hebrew cannot adequately express. In more than one passage Symmachus had a tendency to soften anthropomorphic expressions of the Hebrew text.However, Symmachus aimed to preserve the meaning of his Hebrew source text by a more literal translation than the Septuagint.

Jerome admired his style but faulted his translation in two areas important to Christians, saying that he substituted the Greek word &quot;neanis&quot; (woman) for &quot;parthenos&quot; (virgin) in Isaiah 7:14 and . Symmachus&#x27; Greek translation of the Pentateuch appeared in Origen&#x27;s &quot;Hexapla&quot;, in which he had written κεραύνιος (=onyx) for the precious stone known in Hebrew as &quot;bareḳet&quot; in .

==Lost works==
According to Eusebius, Symmachus also wrote commentaries, then still extant, apparently written to counter the canonical Greek Gospel of Matthew, his &quot;Hypomnemata&quot;; it may be related to the &quot;De distinctione præceptorum&quot;, mentioned in the catalogue of the Nestorian metropolitan Abdiso Bar Berika (d.1318). Eusebius also records Origen&#x27;s statement that he obtained these and others of Symmachus&#x27; commentaries on the scriptures from a certain Juliana, who, he says, inherited them from Symmachus himself (&quot;Historia Ecclesiae&quot;, VI: xvii); Palladius of Galatia (&quot;Historia Lausiaca&quot;, lxiv) records that he found in a manuscript that was &quot;very ancient&quot; the following entry made by Origen: &quot;This book I found in the house of Juliana, the virgin in Caesarea, when I was hiding there; who said she had received it from Symmachus himself, the interpreter of the Jews&quot;. The date of Origen&#x27;s stay with Juliana was probably 238-41, but Symmachus&#x27;s version of the Scriptures had already been known to Origen when he wrote his earliest commentaries, ca 228.

==Later traditions==
From the language of many later writers who speak of Symmachus, he must have been a man of great importance among the Ebionites, for &quot;Symmachians&quot; remained a term applied by Catholics even in the fourth century to the Nazarenes or Ebionites, as we know from the pseudepigraphical imitator of Ambrose, the &quot;Ambrosiaster&quot;, &quot;Prologue to the Epistle to the Galatians&quot;, and from Augustine&#x27;s writings against heretics.

<text>Quintus Aurelius Symmachus [[Nickname|signo]] Eusebius (, ; c. 345 – 402) was a Roman statesman, orator, and man of letters. He held the offices of governor of proconsular Africa in 373, urban prefect of Rome in 384 and 385, and consul in 391. Symmachus sought to preserve the traditional religions of Rome at a time when the aristocracy was converting to Christianity, and led an unsuccessful delegation of protest against Emperor Gratian&#x27;s order to remove the Altar of Victory from the curia, the principal meeting place of the Roman Senate in the Forum Romanum. Two years later he made a famous appeal to Gratian&#x27;s successor, Valentinian II, in a dispatch that was rebutted by Ambrose, the bishop of Milan. Symmachus&#x27;s career was temporarily derailed when he supported the short-lived usurper Magnus Maximus, but he was rehabilitated and three years later appointed consul. After the death of Theodosius I, he became an ally of Stilicho, the guardian of emperor Honorius. In collaboration with Stilicho he was able to restore some of the legislative powers of the Senate. Much of his writing has survived: nine books of letters; a collection of &quot;Relationes&quot; or official dispatches; and fragments of various orations.

==Life==
Symmachus was the son of a prominent aristocrat, Lucius Aurelius Avianius Symmachus, who had been urban prefect of Rome twice. His mother, whose name has not survived, was a daughter of Fabius Tatianus, consul in 337 and a two-term urban prefect. He had two brothers, both &quot;consulares&quot; (provincial governors) and one possibly a Christian, and a sister who may have been the family member that established a connection through marriage between the Symmachi and the Anicii, one of the first Roman families of the highest rank to convert to Christianity.

Symmachus was educated in Gaul, apparently at Bordeaux or Toulouse. In early life he became devoted to literature. In 369, he met Ausonius, and their friendship proved mutually beneficial.

Having discharged the functions of quaestor and praetor, he was appointed Corrector of Lucania and the Bruttii in 365. In 373, he was proconsul of Africa. Probably about the same time, he became a member of the College of Pontiffs. As a representative of the political &quot;cursus honorum&quot;, Symmachus sought to preserve the ancient religion of Rome at a time when the senatorial aristocracy was converting to Christianity.
In 382, the Emperor Gratian, a Christian, ordered the Altar of Victory removed from the Curia, the Roman Senate house in the Forum, and curtailed the sums annually allowed for the maintenance of the Vestal Virgins, and for the public celebration of sacred rites. Symmachus was chosen by the Senate on account of his eloquence to lead a delegation of protest, which the emperor refused to receive. Two years later, Gratian was assassinated in Lugdunum, and Symmachus, now urban prefect of Rome, addressed an elaborate epistle to Gratian&#x27;s successor, Valentinian II, in a famous dispatch that was rebutted by Ambrose, the bishop of Milan. In an age when all religious communities credited the divine power with direct involvement in human affairs, Symmachus argues that the removal of the altar had caused a famine and its restoration would be beneficial in other ways. Subtly he pleads for tolerance for traditional cult practices and beliefs that the Empire was poised to suppress in the Theodosian edicts of 391.

It was natural for Symmachus to sympathise with Magnus Maximus who had defeated Gratian. When Maximus was threatening to invade Italy in 387, his cause was openly advocated by Symmachus, who upon the arrival of Theodosius I was impeached for treason, and forced to take refuge in a sanctuary. Having been pardoned through the intervention of numerous and powerful friends, he expressed his contrition and gratitude in an apologetic address to Theodosius, by whom he was not only forgiven, but was received into favour and elevated to the consulship in 391. During the remainder of his life, he appears to have taken an active part in public affairs. The date of his death is unknown, but one of his letters was written as late as 402.

His leisure hours were devoted exclusively to literary pursuits, as is evident from the numerous allusions in his letters to the studies in which he was engaged. His friendship with Ausonius and other distinguished authors of the era proves that he delighted in associating and corresponding with the learned. His wealth must have been prodigious, for in addition to his town mansion on the Caelian Hill and several houses in the city which he lent to his friends. He possessed upwards of a dozen villas in Italy, many detached farms, together with estates in Sicily and Mauretania.

5th-century monk Gerontius of Jerusalem, cited Olimpiodorus when he wrote, &quot;The orator Symmachus...had relatively but a modest income, possessed three magnificent palaces in Rome, as well as fifteen villas to which he could betake himself whenever he needed change.&quot;

Symmachus, and his real-life associates Vettius Agorius Praetextatus and Virius Nicomachus Flavianus, are the main characters of the &quot;Saturnalia&quot; of Macrobius Ambrosius Theodosius, which was written in the 5th century but set in 384. These three aristocratic intellectuals lead nine others, consisting of fellow noble and non-noble intellectuals, in a discussion of learned topics, dominated by the many-sided erudition of the poet Vergil.

== Writings ==

Of his many writings, the following have survived:

*Nine or ten books of letters, published by his son. Many of the letters are notes extending to a few lines only, addressed to a wide circle of relations, friends, and acquaintances. They relate for the most part to matters of little importance. The most famous letter is the most highly finished and important piece in the collection, the celebrated epistle to &quot;Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius&quot; entreating them to restore the Altar of Victory to its ancient position in the senate house.
*A collection of &quot;Relationes&quot; or official dispatches, which is chiefly composed of the letters written by him when prefect of Rome to the emperors under whom he served.
*Panegyrics, written in his youth, two on Valentinian I and one on the youthful Gratian.
*Fragments of various orations, discovered by Angelo Mai in palimpsests in the Ambrosian library and the Vatican.

According to one of his letters (dated to 401), Symmachus also engaged in the preparation of an edition of Livy&#x27;s &quot;Ab Urbe Condita&quot;. Seven manuscripts of the first decade of Livy&#x27;s extensive work (books 1-10) bear subscriptions including Symmachus&#x27; name along with Tascius Victorianus, Appius Nicomachus Dexter, and Nicomachus Flavianus. J.E.G. Zetzel has identified some of their effects to this tradition of the transmission of this portion of Livy&#x27;s work.

In other letters, Symmachus describes preparations for his shows in the arena. He managed to procure antelopes, gazelles, leopards, lions, bears, bear-cubs, and even some crocodiles. Symmachus also purchased Saxon slaves to fight and die in the games. He was annoyed when twenty-nine of the Saxons strangled each other in their cells on the night before their final scheduled appearance.

One quote of Symmachus from &quot;The Memorial of Symmachus, Prefect of the City&quot; reads (in translation), &quot;We gaze up at the same stars; the sky covers us all; the same universe encompasses us. Does it matter what practical system we adopt in our search for the Truth? The heart of so great a mystery cannot be reached by following one road only.&quot;

The style of Symmachus was widely admired in his own time and into the early Middle Ages, but modern scholars have been frustrated by the lack of solid information about the events of his times to be found in these writings. As a consequence, little of his work has been translated into English.

== Family ==

Symmachus married Rusticiana, whose parents were Memmius Vitrasius Orfitus, twice urban prefect of Rome (353-355; 357-359) and Constantia, possibly the daughter of Constantina and Hannibalianus. Their children included:
* Galla, their oldest child who married Symmachus&#x27; friend Nicomachus Flavianus
* Quintus Fabius Memmius Symmachus, aristocrat

<text>Rheinpark Stadion in Vaduz is the national stadium of Liechtenstein. It plays host to home matches of the Liechtenstein national football team, and is also the home of football club FC Vaduz. It lies on the banks of the river Rhine, just metres from the border with Switzerland.

Rheinpark was officially opened on 31 July 1998 with a match between FC Vaduz, the Liechtenstein Cup holders at the time, and 1. FC Kaiserslautern, the then Bundesliga champions. 1. FC Kaiserslautern won 8–0.

The stadium has a seating capacity of 5,873, with additional standing room giving it a total capacity of 7,584. The stadium cost 19 million CHF to construct.

In 2006, the stadium was upgraded with the South and North grandstands gaining covers, and improvements to the training facilities. In June 2007, the stadium hosted concerts by Clueso and Herbert Grönemeyer.

<text>The Stade Josy Barthel is the former national stadium of Luxembourg, and the former home of the Luxembourg national football team. The stadium, which also hosted rugby union and athletics events, is located on route d&#x27;Arlon, in the Luxembourg City quarter of Belair. Following the opening of the Stade de Luxembourg in September 2021, the stadium and its grounds are currently due for demolition and redevelopment, to be ultimately replaced with a new mixed use neighbourhood named &quot;Wunnquartier Stade&quot;.

==History==
Originally called &quot;Stade Municipal&quot; after its construction in 1928–1931, it was entirely rebuilt in 1990. Since July 1993, it has borne the name of Joseph &quot;Josy&quot; Barthel, the 1500m gold medalist at the 1952 Olympics: Luxembourg&#x27;s only Olympic gold medal winner. The stadium is also home to the biggest athletics club in the country, CAL Spora Luxembourg. The spectator capacity is 7,983, some under cover, some in the open air.

In 2014 it was announced that an investment of €230,000 would be required to get the stadium up to a sufficient standard to hold the qualifying matches for Euro 2016.

In June 2014, the Luxembourg Ministry of Sport, in conjunction with the Luxembourg City administration, decided upon the construction of the new Stade de Luxembourg in Gasperich, currently due to open in 2021. As a result, the Luxembourg City authorities have announced their intentions to demolish the Stade Josy Barthel and redevelop its grounds and surrounding areas.

The Luxembourg national football team played its last official game at the Josy Barthel Stadium on 27 March 2021, a 3–1 defeat to Portugal in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers.

<doc id="754342" wikidata="Q7390071" url="?curid=754342" title="SGI Tezro">
<text>The SGI Tezro is a series of high-end computer workstations sold by SGI from 2003 until 2006. Using MIPS CPUs and running IRIX, it is the immediate successor to the SGI Octane line. The systems were produced in both rack-mount and tower versions, and the series was released in June 2003 with a list price of . The Tezro was released alongside the SGI Onyx 4 and rack-mountable Tezros share many components with it, including plastic skins. The rack-mounted Tezros are functionally very similar to an Infinite Performance-equipped SGI Onyx350. Tezro marked the return of the original cube logo to SGI machines.

It was replaced in 2008 by the SGI Virtu product line.

==Technical specifications==
=== Architecture ===
Similar to other SGI systems, the Tezro uses a non-blocking crossbar interconnect to connect all subsystems together. Tezro is based on SGI&#x27;s Origin 3000 architecture.

ARCS is provided as the boot firmware, as with other SGI computer systems of that era.

=== Processors ===
Tezro systems use two or four 64-bit MIPS R16000 microprocessors.

The following R16000 processor types were available options:

Node boards from Onyx/Origin 350/3900 systems are compatible and use the same RAM. For example, a quad-R16K/700 MHz (8 MB L2) board from a CX-Brick will work in a Tezro; likewise, other boards up to the same quad-1 GHz edition.

=== Memory ===
The Tezro shipped with 512 MB of DDR SDRAM. It can be expanded using proprietary DIMMs. The tower version can hold up to 8 GB of main memory total, and the rack version can hold up to 8 GB per brick (2 bricks can be directly linked by NUMAlink cables, or up to 8 with the use of a NUMAlink Router).

=== Graphics ===
Tezro supports the VPro V10 and V12 graphics options. Dual-channel options were produced for the desktop variants allowing up to two 1920x1200 displays, while dual-head, dual-channel were available for the rack version, allowing a fully equipped rackmount Tezro to drive up to four 1920x1200 displays at once.

=== Audio ===
Tower systems shipped with analog audio output as standard, and PCI cards provide audio capabilities (including 2-channel 24-bit AES and 8-channel ADAT connectors) on rack-mountable versions.

== Expansion ==
The number of available 64-bit PCI slots included in a Tezro system depends upon the number of CPUs installed in the system:

* 7 133/100 MHz slots in two- or four-CPU tower systems
* 3 133/100 MHz slots in single-CPU tower systems
* 6 100 MHz slots and two 66 MHz slots in 4U rackmountable systems
* 2 100 MHz slots and one 66 MHz slot in 2U rackmountable systems.

All PCI slots in each Tezro model are 3.3V card slots.

A single U160 SCSI connector was produced for attaching external peripherals, as was an optional FireWire card.

<doc id="754354" wikidata="Q5568745" url="?curid=754354" title="Glenn Cunningham (New Jersey politician)">
<text>Glenn Dale Cunningham (September 16, 1943 – May 25, 2004) was an American Democratic Party politician, who was the first African American Mayor of Jersey City, the state&#x27;s second-largest city, winning the 2001 Jersey City mayoral election. Cunningham also served in the New Jersey Senate.

After Cunningham&#x27;s death, L. Harvey Smith became the acting mayor of Jersey City. In a November 2004 special election, Judge Jerramiah T. Healy was elected to complete the remainder of Cunningham&#x27;s term. Joseph Doria was selected to fill Cunningham&#x27;s Senate vacancy on an interim basis, and won a special election to fill the balance of the term.

==Biography==
Raised in Jersey City, Cunningham attended Henry Snyder High School, and was inducted into the school&#x27;s first hall of fame class in 2018.

Before his election as mayor, Cunningham, a former Marine and member of the Jersey City Police Department for 25 years, had been appointed by President Bill Clinton as head of New Jersey&#x27;s United States Marshals Service Office. He also served on the Hudson County Board of Chosen Freeholders, as Jersey City Council President, and as public safety director of Hudson County. Cunningham died at Greenville Hospital in Jersey City of a heart attack on May 25, 2004, aged 60. He was a Master Mason and full member of the Most Worshipful Oriental Grand Lodge of Free &amp; Accepted Masons in Newark and was buried with Masonic honors in a funerary procession.

Cunningham&#x27;s widow, Sandra Bolden Cunningham, has become a political leader in Jersey City in her own right. She reportedly considered a bid for her husband&#x27;s State Senate seat in the 2004 special election and a bid for the State Assembly in 2005. In March 2006 signs appeared around Jersey City touting Mrs. Cunningham as a candidate for the United States Senate either in a Democratic Party primary versus her husband&#x27;s political rival, Sen. Bob Menendez or in the general election against Menendez and Republican State Sen. Thomas Kean Jr. Mrs. Cunningham defeated Assemblyman Louis Manzo in the June 2007 Democratic primary for State Senate and was elected to the Senate in November 2007.

<doc id="754362" wikidata="Q2845210" url="?curid=754362" title="Power analysis">
<text>Power analysis is a form of side channel attack in which the attacker studies the power consumption of a cryptographic hardware device. These attacks rely on basic physical properties of the device: semiconductor devices are governed by the laws of physics, which dictate that changes in voltages within the device require very small movements of electric charges (currents). By measuring those currents, it is possible to learn a small amount of information about the data being manipulated.

Simple power analysis (SPA) involves visually interpreting power &quot;traces&quot;, or graphs of electrical activity over time. Differential power analysis (DPA) is a more advanced form of power analysis, which can allow an attacker to compute the intermediate values within cryptographic computations through statistical analysis of data collected from multiple cryptographic operations. SPA and DPA were introduced to the open cryptography community in 1998 by Paul Kocher, Joshua Jaffe and Benjamin Jun.

==Background==
In cryptography, a side channel attack is used to extract secret data from some secure device (such as a smart card, tamper-resistant &quot;black box&quot;, or integrated circuit). Side-channel analysis is typically trying to non-invasively extract cryptographic keys and other secret information from the device. A simple example of this is the German tank problem: the serial numbers of tanks provide details of the production data for tanks. In physical security, a non-invasive attack would be similar to lock-picking, where a successful attack leaves no trace of the attacker being present.

==Simple power analysis==
Simple power analysis (SPA) is a side-channel attack which involves visual examination of graphs of the current used by a device over time. Variations in power consumption occur as the device performs different operations. For example, different instructions performed by a microprocessor will have differing power consumption profiles.

Codeflow that depends on a secret value will thus leak the code-flow via the power consumption monitoring (and thus also leak the secret value). As a simple example, consider a password check as follows:
bool check_password(const char input[]) {
 const char correct_password[] = &quot;hunter2&quot;;

 if (strlen(input) != strlen(correct_password)) return false;

 for (int i = 0; i &lt; strlen(correct_password); i++) {
 if (input[i] != correct_password[i]) {
 return false;
 }

 return true;


This password check potentially contains a Timing attack, since the execution time is not constant. Observing the power consumption will make clear the number of loops executed. However, there is a mitigation possible. The function may not output to the user an exploitable result if, for example, there is a compensating delay before the response is returned. Or the code is structured to complete all the loops irrespective of the character position mismatching between the input and the secret-password. We can see one such sample code in the algorithm section of Timing attack.

Similarly, squaring and multiplication operations in RSA implementations can often be distinguished, enabling an adversary to compute the secret key. Even if the magnitude of the variations in power consumption are small, standard digital oscilloscopes can easily show the data-induced variations. Frequency filters and averaging functions (such as those built into oscilloscopes) are often used to filter out high-frequency components.

==Differential power analysis==

Differential power analysis (DPA) is a side-channel attack which involves statistically analyzing power consumption measurements from a cryptosystem. The attack exploits biases varying power consumption of microprocessors or other hardware while performing operations using secret keys. DPA attacks have &quot;signal processing&quot; and &quot;error correction&quot; properties which can extract secrets from measurements which contain too much noise to be analyzed using simple power analysis. Using DPA, an adversary can obtain secret keys by analyzing power consumption measurements from multiple cryptographic operations performed by a vulnerable smart card or other device.

==High-order differential power analysis==
High-Order Differential Power Analysis (HO-DPA) is an advanced form of DPA attack. HO-DPA enables multiple data sources and different time offsets to be incorporated in the analysis. HO-DPA is less widely practiced than SPA and DPA, as the analysis is complex and most vulnerable devices can be broken more easily with SPA or DPA.

==Power analysis and algorithmic security==

Power analysis provides a way to &quot;see inside&quot; otherwise &#x27;tamperproof&#x27; hardware. For example, DES&#x27;s key schedule involves rotating 28-bit key registers. Many implementations check the least significant bit to see if it is a 1. If so, the device shifts the register right and prepends the 1 at the left end. If the bit is a zero, the register is shifted right without prepending a 1. Power analysis can distinguish between these processes, enabling an adversary to determine the bits of the secret key.

Implementations of algorithms such as AES and triple DES that are believed to be mathematically strong may be trivially breakable using power analysis attacks. As a result, power analysis attacks combine elements of algorithmic cryptanalysis and implementation security.

==Standards and practical security concerns==

For applications where devices may fall into the physical possession of an adversary, protection against power analysis is generally a major design requirement. Power analyses have also been reportedly used against conditional access modules used in pay television systems.

The equipment necessary for performing power analysis attacks is widely available. For example, most digital storage oscilloscopes provide the necessary data collection functionality, and the data analysis is typically performed using conventional PCs.

==Preventing simple and differential power analysis attacks==

Power analysis attacks cannot generally be detected by a device, since the adversary&#x27;s monitoring is normally passive. In addition, the attack is non-invasive. As a result, physical enclosures, auditing capabilities, and attack detectors are ineffective. Instead, cryptosystem engineers must ensure that devices&#x27; power variations do not reveal information usable by adversaries.

Simple power analysis can easily distinguish the outcome of conditional branches in the execution of cryptographic software, since a device does different things (consuming different power) depending on whether the conditional branch is taken. For this reason, care should be taken to ensure there are no secret values which affect the conditional branches within cryptographic software implementations. Other sources of variation, such as microcode differences, branches introduced by compilers, and power consumption variations in multipliers, also commonly lead to SPA vulnerabilities.

Differential power analysis is more difficult to prevent, since even small biases in the power consumption can lead to exploitable weaknesses. Some countermeasure strategies involve algorithmic modifications such that the cryptographic operations occur on data that is related to the actual value by some mathematical relationship that survives the cryptographic operation. One approach involves blinding parameters to randomize their value. Other countermeasure strategies to reduce the effectiveness of DPA attacks involve hardware modifications: varying the chip internal clock frequency has been considered to desynchronize electric signals, which lead in return to algorithmic enhancements of traditional DPA.

<text>Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, often referred to as Fulton County Stadium and originally named Atlanta Stadium, was a multi-purpose stadium located in Atlanta, Georgia. The stadium was home of the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball from 1966 until 1996 and the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League from 1966 until 1991. It was built to attract an MLB team and in 1966 succeeded when the Milwaukee Braves relocated from Wisconsin.

The Braves and expansion Falcons shared the venue for 26 years, until the Falcons moved into the newly completed Georgia Dome in 1992. The Braves continued to play at the stadium for another five years, then moved into Turner Field in 1997, the converted Centennial Olympic Stadium built for the previous year&#x27;s Summer Olympics. Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium hosted baseball events. Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium was demolished on August 2, 1997.

==History==
During his 1961 campaign for mayor of Atlanta, Ivan Allen Jr. promised to build a sports facility to attract a Major League Baseball team. After winning office, Allen chose a plot in the Washington–Rawson neighborhood for the building site, citing its proximity to the state capitol, downtown businesses, and major highways. Allen and &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot; sports editor Furman Bisher attempted to persuade Charlie Finley, owner of the Kansas City Athletics, to move his team to Atlanta. Finley was receptive and began discussing stadium design plans with Allen. However, the deal ended in July 1963 when the American League did not approve the move.

In 1964, Mayor Allen announced that an unidentified team had given him a verbal commitment to move to Atlanta, provided a stadium was in place by 1966. Soon afterward, the prospective team was revealed to be the Milwaukee Braves, who announced in October that they intended to move to Atlanta for the 1965 season. However, court battles kept the Braves in Milwaukee for one last season.
The new stadium was built on the site of the cleared Washington–Rawson neighborhood, which a half-century before had been a wealthy neighborhood home to Georgia&#x27;s governor, among others, but which by the 1960s had fallen on hard times. Forty-seven dignitaries took part in a groundbreaking ceremony on April 15, 1964, and that November, the Braves signed a 25-year agreement to play there, beginning in 1966. Construction was completed on April 9, 1965, for $18 million, and that night the Milwaukee Braves and Detroit Tigers played an exhibition game in the stadium. During that year the International League&#x27;s Atlanta Crackers, whose previous home had been Ponce de Leon Park, played their final season in Atlanta Stadium. On August 18, 1965, the Beatles performed a concert at Atlanta Stadium.

In 1966, both the National League&#x27;s transplanted Braves and the National Football League&#x27;s Atlanta Falcons, an expansion team, began to use the facilities. In 1967, the Atlanta Chiefs of the National Professional Soccer League (re-formed as the North American Soccer League in 1968) began the first of five seasons played at the stadium. The venue hosted the second match of the NASL Final 1968 and two matches of the NASL Final 1971. 

On February 11, 1975, the stadium&#x27;s name was changed to the compound Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium after the county threatened to withdraw its financial support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution 2/12/1975&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, the official website of the Atlanta Braves maintains that the name change occurred after Ted Turner purchased the team in 1976.

The Falcons moved to the Georgia Dome in 1992, while the Braves remained until Centennial Olympic Stadium from the 1996 Summer Olympics was converted into Turner Field, which was completed just prior to the start of the 1997 season. The stadium sat 60,606 for football and 52,007 for baseball. The baseball competition for the 1996 Summer Olympics was held at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium while the Braves were on a three-week road trip.

===Demolition===
Following the Olympics and the 1996 World Series, Fulton County commissioner, Marvin S. Arrington Sr., wanted to preserve the stadium as the home of a future Major League Soccer franchise and share the parking facilities between it and Turner Field but he was unable to push it through.

On April 4, 1997, home plate was removed from Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium and taken to Turner Field, where it was installed by Hank Aaron in the new stadium. Afterwards, demolition of the old stadium began. Between spring and summer 1997, the inside of the stadium was demolished. The stadium was imploded on August 2, 1997; the remains were later removed and demolished. A parking lot, built for Turner Field now stands on the site, with an outline of the old stadium built in. The monument that marked the landing point of Hank Aaron&#x27;s historic 715th home run stands in the same place it did when the stadium was on the site.

The outfield fence was donated to the Georgia State Baseball Complex and installed prior to the 1998 season.

===Redevelopment===
Upon the Atlanta Braves&#x27; move to Truist Park in suburban Cobb County after the 2016 season, the stadium site and the adjacent Turner Field were purchased by Georgia State University in 2016, with final approval from the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia on November 9 of that year. Turner Field was renovated into Center Parc Stadium for the Panthers football team, while new baseball and softball parks are planned for the former Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium site. In May 2024, The Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia approved the construction of a new baseball stadium on the site, with completion planned in time for the start of the 2026 season.

The site is currently a parking lot for Center Parc Stadium.

==Notable events==

===Baseball===
* On April 12, 1966, Joe Torre hit the first major league home run in the history of Atlanta Stadium.
* On July 25, 1972, the stadium hosted the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Hank Aaron hit a home run during the game, and the National League won it, 4–3, in 10 innings.
* On April 8, 1974, Hank Aaron became baseball&#x27;s all-time career home run leader by hitting his 715th home run off the Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; Al Downing.
* 1984 Braves–Padres bean brawl: During a series between the Braves and the San Diego Padres, one game spawned several brawls between the two teams. On August 12, 1984, Braves pitcher Pascual Pérez hit the Padres&#x27; Alan Wiggins with a pitch; Wiggins did not charge the mound, but the Padres vowed revenge on Pérez for his actions (several Padres were ejected in their subsequent attempts to hit Pérez). When Pérez was finally hit, by a pitch thrown by the Padres&#x27; Craig Lefferts, the first of many bench-clearing brawls began. By the time the game was over, both teams&#x27; lineups had been nearly emptied (due to all the ejections on both sides).
* On July 6, 1986, Bob Horner became the eleventh player in Major League Baseball history to hit four home runs in a single game.
* The stadium hosted the World Series for the first time in 1991 when the Braves played the Minnesota Twins in what ESPN judged to be the best World Series ever played. The Braves won all three games played in Atlanta, two in their final at-bat, but lost the series in seven games.
* The 1992 World Series saw the Braves play the Toronto Blue Jays with the Blue Jays defeating the Braves four games to two, including two of three in Atlanta.
* On July 20, 1993, a fire occurred in the stadium press box during batting practice for that evening&#x27;s game against the St. Louis Cardinals. This fire occurred on the same day Fred McGriff joined the Braves.
* On October 10, 1995, the Braves clinched the 1995 NLDS the 1st team to win a Division Series since the NLDS format in the playoff system began that same year. They defeated the Colorado Rockies 3 games to 1, with the decisive win at home.
* On October 28, 1995, the Braves clinched the 1995 World Series by defeating the Cleveland Indians, 1–0, on a one-hit, 8-inning performance by pitcher Tom Glavine. The title was the Braves&#x27; first World Series championship in Atlanta, making one title in each of the three cities in which they have resided (also Boston and Milwaukee).
* September 23, 1996, marked the stadium&#x27;s final regular season game as the Braves played host to the Montreal Expos. Atlanta won the game 3–1 and clinched the NL Eastern Division title in the process.
* The stadium&#x27;s final event was Game 5 of the 1996 World Series, when the Braves played host to the New York Yankees. The final score was 1–0 in favor of the Yankees, with the ballpark&#x27;s final run scored by Charlie Hayes. The final ceremonial first pitch was thrown to Eddie Perez by former President Jimmy Carter, who had done the honors at Braves home openers while still Governor of Georgia. The winning pitcher was New York&#x27;s Andy Pettitte, defeating the Braves&#x27; John Smoltz. The final hit was recorded by Atlanta&#x27;s Chipper Jones, who doubled off Pettitte in the bottom of the ninth inning. Pinch-hitter Luis Polonia was the final out in Fulton County Stadium&#x27;s history, hitting a deep fly ball to right-center field caught by Yankees right fielder Paul O&#x27;Neill, which gave the stadium&#x27;s final save to John Wetteland. (Since no home runs were hit in that game the final home run in the stadium&#x27;s history belongs to Jim Leyritz, who hit a 3-run home run in Game 4. Leyritz was also Pettitte&#x27;s batterymate for Game 5.)
For the 1996 summer Olympics, the stadium was the primary venue for baseball.

===Football===
* The Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings played the first NFL preseason game on August 14, .
* On September 11, 1966, the Atlanta Falcons played their first game in the stadium and lost to the Los Angeles Rams 19–14.
* The Falcons&#x27; last game played at the stadium was on December 15, 1991, where they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 26–13, clinching a NFC wild-card spot for the team&#x27;s first playoff berth since 1982; among some of the attendees included Wayne Newton and MC Hammer.

===Concerts===
===Other events===
* In February 1966 Vietnam War supporters held a prayer rally that featured Dean Rusk as its keynote speaker.
* The stadium hosted a round of the AMA Supercross Championship 1977–1986 and 1989–1992.
* In 1994, the UniverSoul Circus conducted its first performance at the stadium.

==Layout==

The stadium was relatively nondescript, one of the many multi-purpose stadiums built during the 1960s and 1970s, similar to Veterans Stadium, RFK Stadium, the Astrodome, Three Rivers Stadium, Busch Memorial Stadium, Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum and Riverfront Stadium.

As was the case for every stadium that used this design concept, the fundamentally different sizes and shapes of baseball and football fields made it inadequate for both sports. In the baseball configuration, 70% of the seats were in foul territory. In the football configuration, seats on the 50-yard-line—normally prime seats for football—were more than away from the sidelines. One unusual feature of this stadium is the fact that, unlike most multi-purpose stadiums – where the football field was laid either parallel to one of the foul lines or running from home plate to center field – the football field here was laid along a line running between first and third base. Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum has a similar configuration. Thus, a seat behind home plate for baseball would also be on the 50-yard line for football. The stadium was refurbished for the 1996 season prior to hosting the Olympic baseball competition.

Unlike similarly designed outdoor stadiums—such as Riverfront Stadium and Busch Memorial Stadium—Fulton County Stadium always had a natural grass surface. However, for many years it was notorious for its poor field conditions. Until 1989, it didn&#x27;t have full-time groundskeepers. Instead, it was tended to by a municipal street-maintenance crew.

Due to the elevation of the Atlanta area (situated at the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains), the stadium boasted the highest elevation in baseball when it opened, at above sea level. It retained this distinction for 27 seasons, until the expansion Colorado Rockies entered the National League in 1993. The high elevation and the Southern summer heat made it favorable to home run hitters, resulting in the nickname &quot;The Launching Pad.&quot; Until the Florida Marlins arrived (also in 1993), the stadium was the hottest in the majors.

Fulton County Stadium was designed by a joint-venture team of FABRAP (Finch Alexander Barnes Rothschild &amp; Paschal) and Heery, Inc.

<text>The Pontiac Silverdome (also known as the Silverdome) was a stadium in Pontiac, Michigan. It opened in 1975 and sat on 199 acres (51 ha) of land. When the stadium opened, it featured a fiberglass fabric roof held up by air pressure, the first use of the architectural technique in a major athletic facility. With a seating capacity of 82,600+, it was the largest stadium in the National Football League (NFL) until FedExField in Landover, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. expanded its capacity to over 85,000 in 2000.

It was primarily the home of the Detroit Lions of the NFL from 1975 to 2001 and was also home to the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1978 to 1988. In addition, the Silverdome also served as the home venue for the Detroit Express of the North American Soccer League and the Michigan Panthers of the United States Football League, as well as two college bowl games: the Cherry Bowl and the Motor City Bowl. In 2012, the Silverdome served as the home venue of the Detroit Mechanix of the American Ultimate Disc League and hosted the league championship game that season.

The stadium was a regular concert venue and hosted a number of athletic and non-athletic events, including the 1979 NBA All-Star Game, Super Bowl XVI, WrestleMania III, early round games of the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and regional games in the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

After the opening of Ford Field in 2002, the stadium was left without a permanent tenant. The city of Pontiac was unable to find a good use for the stadium, leaving it empty for eight years; the city ran out of money, and was forced to sell due to the rising maintenance costs. After multiple attempts to solicit redevelopment plans, the city eventually sold the stadium at auction in 2009 with no reserve for $550,000 (less than 1% of the cost to build the dome) to Andreas Apostolopoulos. The property had fallen into disrepair brought on by the city&#x27;s financial crises, and the city of Pontiac&#x27;s inability to afford to spend the necessary capital investments it required. After a significant financial investment by the new owners, the facility was brought back to its original glory. The millions of dollars invested by the new owners were needed to bring The Silverdome back to a safe and clean facility. The Pontiac Silverdome reopened in 2010 and hosted many events, including soccer matches, concerts, HBO championship boxing, monster truck shows and many more. The harsh Michigan weather eventually got the best of the aging venue, and in 2013 an excessive amount of snow caused a portion of the antiquated roof system to tear. The Pontiac Silverdome&#x27;s roof issues dated back to the 1980s with a long list of weather related problems. The Pontiac Silverdome&#x27;s uniqueness was also its downfall. As one of the last air supported football stadiums left, it was not possible to find a qualified company capable of repairing the damaged roof. Paired with the financial woes of the city, which included the inability to pay for police, emergency services and road maintenance, the decision to close the facility for good was made in 2013. The owners later auctioned the stadium&#x27;s contents in 2014 and for a few years the parking lot was home to tens of thousands of recalled Volkswagen vehicles.

In 2017, the Silverdome owner decided to tear down the closed facility. The upper ring of the stadium, which had supported the roof structure, was imploded on December 4, 2017, after a failed attempt the previous day. Following the implosion, the remains of the stadium were brought down in sections with hydraulic excavators, and the last free standing section was felled by late March 2018. In September 2019, it was announced that Amazon would develop the site.

==Former uses==
The Silverdome hosted the Detroit Lions of the NFL (1975–2001), the Detroit Pistons of the NBA (1978–1988), the Detroit Express (for both outdoor and indoor soccer) of the NASL (1978–1980), the Michigan Panthers of the USFL (1983–1984), college football&#x27;s Cherry Bowl (1984–1985), the Motor City Bowl (1997–2001), the MHSAA football state finals (1976–2004) and four first-round games during soccer&#x27;s 1994 FIFA World Cup.

For the World Cup matches, a natural grass surface capable of growing inside the dome was developed and installed by a team from Michigan State University. This grass surface was laid upon wooden pallets atop the artificial turf that was usually used. It was the first time that World Cup games were played indoors. The Silverdome also hosted the 1979 NBA All-Star Game, Super Bowl XVI on January 24, 1982, and the 1988 and 1991 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament Midwest Regionals and NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships in 1982 and 1983.

On March 29, 1987, the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s WrestleMania III reportedly established the record for attendance of 93,173, the largest recorded attendance for a live indoor sporting event in North America. The record stood until February 14, 2010, when the 2010 NBA All-Star Game broke the indoor sporting event record with an attendance of 108,713 at Cowboys Stadium.

The Silverdome hosted an AMA Supercross Championship round from 1976 to 2005.

In 2012, the Silverdome became the home stadium of the city&#x27;s professional Ultimate Frisbee team, the Detroit Mechanix, of the American Ultimate Disc League. That year, the Silverdome hosted the AUDL championship game, as on August 11, the Philadelphia Spinners defeated the Indianapolis AlleyCats 29–22.

After the roof had been collapsed and the stadium abandoned, Red Bull produced a video of BMX rider Tyler Fernengel riding inside the Silverdome in 2015. Some notable tricks in the video were Fernengel&#x27;s barspin to double peg to 180° spin on one of the handrails inside the stadium and an impressive &quot;truckdriver&quot; (handlebars spinning 360° while the bike frame spins 360°) out of the luxury boxes onto a ramp that led down to the field. That same year, a drag racing event at the former parking lot marked the beginning of Woodward Dream Cruise.

==History==

===Conception/development===
The idea of a major sports complex was part of a dream of C. Don Davidson, a Pontiac native and star high school athlete. Davidson, upon graduating from Pontiac Central High School in 1947 and completing active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps, attended North Carolina State University on a football scholarship. After earning a master&#x27;s degree in urban planning and architecture, Davidson began his career as an architect and was recognized for several government and city projects throughout the south including Florida&#x27;s Jacksonville International Airport. He returned to Pontiac in 1965 and was shocked to see the deterioration of the city and its lack of a future plan. Davidson embarked upon what would eventually become an obsession for him to see his beloved city succeed. In 1965–66, he was hired as a professor of architecture and urban planning at the University of Detroit under the direction of Bruno Leon.

As part of an ongoing, comprehensive study by his architecture class on urban renewal for the city of Pontiac, Davidson met with various city and state authorities including William Clay Ford, owner of the Detroit Lions, to discuss the possibility of a new stadium, made it a college class project to find a suitable site for a new stadium and even started his own weekly newspaper known as &quot;The Pontiac Times&quot;, to help promote his vision. After much controversy and sparring with Detroit city officials, Pontiac was chosen over several other sites including the Michigan Fairgrounds, Walled Lake and the Detroit Riverfront as the best place for construction of what would become known as the Pontiac Silverdome. Already having a stadium concept as part of his master plan for the city, Davidson was interviewed and ultimately hired as chief project designer for the stadium project by the architectural firm of O&#x27;Dell, Hewlett &amp; Luckenbach. Initial designs included a dual stadium complex for both football and baseball (potentially housing the Detroit Tigers) that was later scrapped due to high costs. Davidson was pleased to see a part of his vision for the city of Pontiac accomplished in the building of the 80,000-seat sports complex. Completed in 1975 as the Pontiac Metropolitan Stadium, at a cost of $55.7 million, the Silverdome seated 80,311. It contained 102 luxury suites and 7,384 club seats. It sometimes incorporated the arrowhead emblem from its now-defunct namesake General Motors division into its own logo.

===Original silver-like roof===
The original silver-like roof was built of Teflon-coated fiberglass panels, and supported by air pressure inside the stadium. Although the roof has always been white in color as viewed with the naked eye, the stadium obtained the name &quot;Silverdome&quot; (which it would officially take on in 1977) due to a silver-like reflection caused by the Sun, mainly noticed from the sky. (Initially, however, the stadium also went by its shortened nickname of &quot;PonMet&quot;, but that nickname was disliked by Pontiac city commissioners.) The roof was replaced by a new canvas fabric, reinforced by steel girders after a strong snowstorm on March 4, 1985, caused structural damage to the old roof. Because of the damage, the Detroit Pistons played the remainder of the 1984–85 season at the now-closed and demolished Joe Louis Arena. The accident, and the delay in repairs, partially prompted the Pistons moving three seasons later north to their new, privately owned, 20,000-seat sports arena, The Palace of Auburn Hills (like Joe Louis Arena, it also has since closed down and demolished).

The 1985 repairs were necessitated by a collapse of the original 1975 roof around noon EST on March 4, 1985. Heavy, wet snow accumulated on the southwest corner of the dome and depressed the fabric panels low enough so that the fabric came in contact with a steel lighting catwalk that was positioned just below the inner lip of the roof&#x27;s ring beam. The hole caused a loss of air pressure and the Dome deflated slowly – there were no injuries. The shift from a &quot;dome&quot; to &quot;bowl&quot; caused all the heavy, wet snow to slide down into the bowl and rupture more roof panels, collapse some precast risers in the SW upper deck, and dislodge more plastic seats &quot;... than a Rolling Stones concert&quot; according to Bob Haney, the Dome&#x27;s Operations Manager. Crews from Owens-Corning Fiberglas, the dome&#x27;s original roof installer, were on site by 1:30 pm on March 4. Repair operations began immediately but were interrupted for over a week due to high winds. During the high winds event nearly all of the remaining panels in the deflated roof, 100 in all, were badly damaged. The decision was made to replace the entire roof and incorporate some improvements to prevent a similar event from occurring in the future. Repair cost of the roof was just under $8 million.

The repairs were completed and the dome re-inflated at noon on May 28, 1985. A thunderstorm passed through the Pontiac area the morning the Dome was to be re-inflated and a partial inflation, or &quot;puff&quot;, was performed so that the scheduled inflation could occur in the presence of the many city and area politicians as well as a number of corporate executives. The original-style, Teflon-coated fiberglass material was used to make the repairs – not canvas as described in the article. There were several snow-melting and waterproofing improvements that kept the dome inflated until January 2, 2013 – almost 28 years.

===Notable audience attendance numbers===
The largest crowd to gather at the Silverdome was on September 18, 1987, for Mass with Pope John Paul II, with a reported attendance of 93,682 — just shading the reported record of 93,173 set at the Silverdome on March 29, 1987, for WrestleMania III. Another notable audience attendance record had earlier been broken on April 30, 1977, when the English rock band Led Zeppelin played in front of 76,229 fans at the Silverdome. This was, at the time, a new world record attendance for a solo indoor attraction, beating the 75,962 that The Who attracted there on December 6, 1975. The Detroit Pistons also set numerous NBA attendance records during their time at the Silverdome; Regular Season, 61,983 vs. Boston, January 29, 1988; Playoffs, 41,732, vs. L.A. Lakers, June 16, 1988.

===1994 FIFA World Cup===
The Silverdome was a venue for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. In an exhibition game between Germany and England in June 1993, English coach Graham Taylor criticized the indoor venue&#x27;s lack of weather as removing an unpredictability factor from soccer. The lack of air conditioning contributed to extreme heat and humidity, an advantage to the Germans playing for Italian clubs. The 62,126 attendance was the highest in any US soccer match since 1984.

On June 18, 1994, the United States tied 1–1 with Switzerland in the first World Cup game to be played indoors. Swiss coach Roy Hodgson later admitted that his team had not prepared for the extreme temperature and humidity.

===Marching band activities and events===
The Silverdome was also the home to many marching band activities and events, including the Michigan Competing Band Association State Marching Band Championships until 2005, the Bands of America Regional championships from 2003 to 2005, and the Bands of America Grand National Championships in 1987 and 1988. Following its reopening, the Silverdome was host to the 2010, 2011 and 2012 Bands of America Pontiac Regional Championship.

===Usage after Lions&#x27; move to Ford Field===
The Lions moved from the Silverdome to Ford Field after the end of their 2001 season. Despite being the Lions&#x27; home for 27 seasons, the day of the last home game, January 6, 2002, was marked by a noticeable absence of nostalgia among the fans as well as the players. In particular, long-time Lions&#x27; defensive end Robert Porcher singled out the stadium&#x27;s artificial turf as the worst part about playing at the Silverdome, echoing other players present that day.

The upper concourse was used for inline skating and provided skaters with a 25-foot wide track measuring 0.4 miles on the inner edge and 0.5 miles on the outer edge.

When the World Hockey Association (WHA) tried to re-introduce itself, the new WHA Detroit team was slated to play its home games at the Silverdome. Plans were also mooted for a Windsor-based Canadian Football League team which could have used the dome for possible playoff games, but that team also did not materialize.

After the Lions relocated, activity in the Silverdome dropped drastically; however, it still staged some events. Annually, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses used the Silverdome from the late 1970s to 2004. Due to talk of renovation in 2004, the Witnesses opted to travel to The Dow Event Center in Saginaw, and the SeaGate Convention Centre in Toledo, Ohio for their District Conventions. Between 2003 and 2006, a three-screen drive-in theater operated in the parking lot; this theater reopened in 2010 before closing again on July 13, 2011.

The Silverdome hosted Monster Jam on January 7, 2006, and was used as a practice facility for the AFC champion Pittsburgh Steelers for Super Bowl XL, with the NFL adding FieldTurf, which was later donated to a local high school.

===Sale===
After the Lions&#x27; departure, the city of Pontiac began to experience several years of serious financial problems. Due to the continued high maintenance costs of the structure, it made several unsuccessful attempts to sell the stadium. In early 2008, United Assurance Company Ltd. made the highest purchase offer to date, with a bid of $18 million to convert the Silverdome into a Hollywood-style entertainment complex, following an earlier bid of $12 million by an attorney. However, the city announced in October 2009 that the property would go to auction with no minimum bid, and that zoning regulations would be relaxed for any buyer in order to spark development. The city engaged the firm of Williams &amp; Williams to conduct the auction in November 2009.

After reading about the auction in a newspaper, Greek-born Canadian real estate developer Andreas Apostolopoulos, CEO of Toronto-based Triple Properties Inc., submitted a winning bid of US$550,000. Real estate fees of 6% raised the price to US$583,000. The sale of the Silverdome, completed in 1975 at a cost of $55.7 million (approx. $225 million in 2012 dollars) and sold in 2009 for $583,000, was viewed by many as a symbol of the collapse of real estate prices in the Detroit metropolitan area though many local leaders and residents claimed the sale was brought about due to the incompetence of city management and their not having a vision or future plans for the stadium and surrounding area.

===Reopening (2010–2013)===
In the March 11, 2010, edition of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, Apostolopoulos vowed &quot;to revive the stadium as a big-event venue by investing millions of dollars&quot;.

The Silverdome re-opened on April 17, 2010, with a monster truck event.

A.C. Milan and Panathinaikos F.C. played an exhibition game on August 6, 2010. On January 29, 2011, professional boxer Timothy Bradley defended his WBO light welterweight title in a unification fight against WBC champion Devon Alexander. The fight aired live on &quot;HBO World Championship Boxing&quot;, with an attendance of about 7,000.

The owners indicated that they were pursuing a possible expansion team for Major League Soccer, and contemplated renovating the Silverdome for this purpose. Ultimately, the lack of events coming into the stadium, combined with the 2013 roof collapse, put any further development plans on indefinite hold.
===Auctioning of contents and demolition===

In March 2014, the owners announced that they would be auctioning off the contents of the facility, including seats and fixtures.

In December 2014, Cleveland-based photographer Johnny Joo captured the Silverdome in a state of abandonment, showing destruction caused by the 2013 roof collapse.

Afterwards, in October 2015, it was announced that the Silverdome would be demolished in the Spring of 2016, and the area would be part of an Oakland County mixed-use development. Demolition was then scheduled for December 3, 2017. In June 2016, fire caused by arson destroyed the former press box. Around the same time, the parking lot began being used as storage for hundreds of Volkswagen diesel cars as a result of Volkswagen&#x27;s 2015 emissions scandal. The dome owner and the city were in conflict over the condition of the dome and the cars in the lot.
In 2017, the Silverdome was condemned and cleared for demolition. Workers had been on the site for the past few months before main power feeds were disconnected preparing the Silverdome for demolition, including completing environmental remediation, universal waste removal and tearing out transite asbestos panels that were used in a majority of the suites around the perimeter of the dome; though not without a few local trespasser visits to explore the place leading up to the demolition. On September 18 and 19, 2017, four power feeds were disconnected, officially starting the final preparation process for demolition. The firm contracted to handle the demolition, the Detroit-based Adamo Group, also imploded the Georgia Dome in Atlanta on November 20 before moving on to the Silverdome. The demolition of the Silverdome was to commence on December 3, 2017, with a partial implosion of the upper deck, followed by an excavation of the building from the inside out.

Due to a wiring issue, eight of the explosive charges failed to detonate, preventing the stadium from imploding as planned. A second attempt was successful the next day. While Adamo could not pinpoint the exact cause of the issues, they did note that trespassers had been seen on the property a couple of days prior to the first attempt. It was noted that on the second attempt, Adamo doubled the amount of explosives used from of TNT.
By the end of March 2018, the last free standing wall of the Silverdome was destroyed, leaving a deep hole where the stadium once stood. of crushed concrete remained on site to be used as landfill material. Demolition officials stated that final filling and grading operations of the former Silverdome site were expected to be completed by the end of November 2018.

===Site re-development===
In September 2019, the City of Pontiac announced that Amazon was going to develop the Silverdome site into both a distribution facility and delivery center. The delivery center opened in September 2020, while the distribution center opened in 2021. The project cost an estimated $250 million.

<text>Nikolai Nikolayevich Yudenich (Russian: Николай Николаевич Юденич; – 5 October 1933) was a commander of the Russian Imperial Army during World War I. He was a leader of the anti-communist White movement in northwestern Russia during the Civil War.

==Early life==
Yudenich was born in Moscow, where his father was a minor court official. Yudenich graduated from the Alexandrovsky Military College in 1881 and the General Staff Academy in 1887. He first served with the Life Guards Regiment in Lithuania from November 1889 to December 1890. In January 1892, he was transferred to the Turkestan Military District and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in April 1892. He was a member of the Pamir Expedition in 1894 and was promoted to colonel in 1896. From September 20, 1900, Yudenich served on the staff of the 1st Turkestan Rifle Brigade.

In 1902, Yudenich was appointed commander of the 18th Infantry Regiment, which he continued to command during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. He was wounded in the arm during the Battle of Sandepu and wounded in the neck during the Battle of Mukden. At the end of the war, he was promoted to major general.

From February 1907, Yudenich served as quartermaster of the General Staff of the Caucasus Military District. He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1912 and served as chief of staff at Kazan, followed by the Caucasus Military District in 1913.

==World War I==
At the beginning of World War I, Yudenich was appointed Chief of Staff of the Russian Caucasus Army. Major operations included the Battle of Sarikamish, a victory against Enver Pasha of the Ottoman Empire. In January 1915, Yudenich was promoted to General of Infantry and replaced Count Illarion Ivanovich Vorontsov-Dashkov as commander of the Caucasus Campaign. Yudenich tried to exploit the Ottoman defeat by attacking into Turkish territory, specifically around Lake Van during the Siege of Van. The Russians captured Van in May 1915, but they were forced to withdraw from the city two months later. The Ottoman 3rd Army reoccupied Van in August.

Grand Duke Nicholas, having been removed from command of all of Russia&#x27;s armies, was then put in charge of the Caucasus. Yudenich was given a free hand by the Grand Duke, and, in September the Russians retook Van and re-established the Administration for Western Armenia in June 1916. Fighting back and forth around the region continued for the next 14 months without a clear victory for either side.

In 1916, Yudenich successfully carried out an offensive, winning the Battle of Erzurum (1916) and the Trebizond Campaign. In the summer of that year, his forces fought off a Turkish counterattack, culminating in the Battle of Erzincan, which included the presence of Ottoman General Mustafa Kemal. During the battle, Yudenich was awarded the Order of St. George (2nd degree), the final time the decoration was awarded in the Russian Empire.

After the February Revolution, Yudenich was appointed commander of the Caucasus Front in 1917, but in May, the Russian Provisional Government removed him from command for insubordination. On direct orders from Alexander Kerensky, he retired from the army. Yudenich then relocated from Tbilisi to Petrograd, where he supported the Kornilov revolt.

==White Army==
After the October Revolution of 1917, Yudenich went into hiding from the Bolsheviks and was sheltered by a former sergeant of the Life Guards of Lithuania, who had served with Yudenich from his time in the Pamirs. He managed to escape to exile in Finland in January 1919. In Helsinki, Yudenich joined the &quot;Russian Committee,&quot; which had formed in November 1918 to oppose the Bolsheviks, and he was proclaimed as leader of the White movement in northwestern Russia with absolute powers. In the spring of 1919, Yudenich visited Stockholm, where he met with diplomatic representatives of Britain, France, and the United States and tried with limited success to obtain assistance in developing a Russian volunteer corps to fight the Bolsheviks.

In June 1919, Yudenich made contact with Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak&#x27;s All-Russian Government based in Omsk, which subsequently acknowledged him as commander-in-chief of all Russian armed forces operating against the Bolsheviks in the Baltic Sea and in northwestern Russia. Kolchak also provided much-needed funds to pay and equip his forces. In June 1919, Yudenich went to Tallinn to meet with General Aleksandr Rodzyanko, the commander of the White Russian Northern Army, attacking Petrograd formally under the Estonian High Command. Yudenich appointed Rodzyanko as his aide.

In August 1919, under pressure from the British government, &quot;ad hoc&quot; to issue a legally-binding guarantee of the independence of his key ally Estonia, Yudenich was forced to create the counterrevolutionary &quot;Regional Government of Northwest Russia,&quot; which included monarchists, Socialist-Revolutionaries, and Mensheviks. Yudenich served as Minister of War and spent the next two months organizing and training his army. By September 1919, he had a fairly well-organized army of approximately 17,000 troops, with 53 guns and six tanks. The six tanks were supplied by Britain, together with their volunteer crews, who were the only British ground troops to fight alongside the Northwestern Army.

In early October 1919, Yudenich launched his army against Petrograd, which was only lightly defended, as the Red Army was actively engaged on several other fronts in fighting Kolchak&#x27;s forces in Siberia and several Cossack armies in Ukraine. Yudenich&#x27;s friend from the Imperial Russian Army, General Carl Gustav Emil Mannerheim, asked Finnish President Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg to join Yudenich&#x27;s force and to attack Petrograd with help from the Finnish White Guards. Yudenich would have recognized Finland&#x27;s independence, and the country&#x27;s pro-Triple Entente relationships would be recognized. As Kolchak, nominally the leader of the White Armies, would not recognize Finland&#x27;s independence, Stålhberg denied Mannerheim&#x27;s request. Overall, the Northwestern Army was nationalistic and patriotic and thus rejected ethnic particularism and separatism. The Northwestern Army generally believed in a united multinational Russia and opposed separatists wanting to create nation-states.

On 12 October 1919, the Whites retook Yamburg. Two days later, Yudenich was approaching Gatchina. On 19 October 1919 his troops reached the outskirts of Petrograd, but his forces failed to secure the vital Moscow – Saint Petersburg Railway, which allowed the Revolutionary Military Council to send in massive reinforcements to prevent the fall of the city. Yudenich&#x27;s stalled offensive collapsed in late October, and the 7th and the 15th Red Armies repulsed the White Russian troops back into Estonia in November. Distrustful of the White Russians, the Estonian High Command disarmed and interned the remains of Northwestern Army, which retreated behind Estonian lines. Politically, the Bolsheviks secured a separate armistice with Estonia on 3 January by promising to recognize Estonian independence, an offer contrary to the White Army&#x27;s and the Kolchak government&#x27;s position.

During the civil war, like many other generals, Yudenich issued currency to pay his troops. They were reported to be so worthless that a Tallinn chocolate company requested permission to use the banknotes as wrappers for its products.

On 28 January 1920, General Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz, together with several Russian officers and the Estonian Police, arrested Yudenich as he tried to escape to Western Europe. Yudenich was later released from prison.

==Later life==
After his release, Yudenich departed for exile in France. During his remaining 13 years, he played no significant role among White émigré community there.

Yudenich died at Saint-Laurent-du-Var, near Nice, on the French Riviera, on 5 October 1933.

<text>Steven Ferencz Udvar-Házy (; born 1946), also known as István or Steve Hazy, is a Hungarian-American billionaire businessman and the executive chairman of Air Lease Corporation. He is the former chairman and CEO of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), one of the two largest aircraft lessors in the world (the other being AerCap). &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2021 list of The World&#x27;s Billionaires estimated his net worth at US$4 billion.

==Early life==
The Udvar-Házy family moved to the US in 1958, fleeing the Soviet occupation of Hungary. Hazy attended University High School in Los Angeles, and the University of California, Los Angeles.

==Career==
Udvar-Házy was in his 20s during the later part of transition from propeller aircraft to jets during the mid to late 1960s, and realized that the higher capital investment required to purchase jet aircraft created an opportunity for a leasing business. He founded ILFC with fellow Hungarian Leslie Gonda and his son Louis Gonda in 1973, leasing a single used Douglas DC-8 to Aeroméxico. He left ILFC in February 2010 and founded Air Lease Corporation.

In 2016, Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orbán presented Udvar-Házy the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of Hungary for his achievements in airline industry.

==Philanthropy==
Udvar-Házy gave a US$66 million grant to the Smithsonian Institution that allowed the U.S. National Air and Space Museum to build the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center annex at Washington Dulles International Airport. The annex houses more than 120 aircraft and 140 space-exploration exhibits as of 2006, and also includes the Space Shuttle Discovery. Plans call for eventually installing over 300 aircraft.

The Udvar-Házy family contributed funds to build the Christine and Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Library and Learning Center at Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University&#x27;s Prescott Campus. The business building at Utah Tech University in St. George, Utah is named after his parents, Erno and Etel Udvar-Házy.

==Personal life==
He is married with four children and lives in Beverly Hills, California.

<text>National League Park, commonly referred to as the Baker Bowl after 1923, was a baseball stadium home to the Philadelphia Phillies from 1887 until 1938, and the first home field of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1933 to 1935. It opened in 1887 with a capacity of 12,500. It burned down in 1894 and was rebuilt in 1895 as the first ballpark constructed primarily of steel and brick and with a cantilevered upper deck. 

The ballpark&#x27;s first base line ran parallel to Huntingdon Street; right field to center field parallel to North Broad Street; center field to left field parallel to Lehigh Avenue; and the third base line parallel to 15th Street. The stadium was demolished in 1950.

==History==
===1887 construction===
 
The Philadelphia Phillies had played at Recreation Park since their first season in 1883. Phillies owners Al Reach and John Rogers built the new National League Park for $80,000 with a capacity of 12,500 to open for the 1887 season.

Philadelphia&#x27;s Building Inspectors&#x27; office issued a permit to Joseph Bird on August 4, 1886, to construct a pavilion 130 × 105 feet, one story high, at the northeast corner of Fifteenth and Huntingdon Streets. The pavilion was built of iron and brick and featured two turrets. The ballpark&#x27;s superintendent would live in one of the turrets.

The new ballpark was to have opened on April 4, 1887, for the preseason City Series against the Philadelphia Athletics, but inclement weather delayed final construction.

The Phillies played their first game in the new ballpark on Saturday, April 30, 1887, in the home opener against the New York Giants. 18,000 tickets were sold for the first game, with 13,000 in the stands. An additional 5,000 fans crowded onto the by wide bicycle track which encircled the field, and others in the terraces above left field.

Philadelphia Mayor Edwin Henry Fitler attended along with the city&#x27;s political and business leadership and many baseball leaders, including New York Giants owner John B. Day, Brooklyn Dodgers&#x27; founder and owner Charlie Byrne, Baltimore Orioles manager Billy Barnie, and Philadelphia Athletics manager Lew Simmons. The Phillies defeated New York 15 to 9.

The original layout of the field was different from its shape by 1895. In 1887, the dimensions of the playing field were left field , center field , and right field . The long left field distance was to the outer wall before the bleachers were added. The center field was much closer than it became later when the center field area was extended over the sunken railroad tracks. 

The bicycle track was upgraded in October 1890. During the 1891 baseball season, the Phillies welcomed fans to ride their bicycles to games, check and lock their cycles at the park, and then use the bicycle track at the end of the game.

Following the 1893 season, the Reading Railroad constructed a railroad tunnel under the intersection of Broad Street and Lehigh Avenue and the ballpark&#x27;s centerfield, creating the ballpark&#x27;s distinctive outfield &quot;hump&quot;, and elevating the street level along the outfield fences. This tunnel continues to be used today by SEPTA Regional Rail&#x27;s Main Line. To prevent fans from viewing the games over the right field wall along the now higher Broad Street, the Phillies constructed the fence before the 1894 season.

===1894 fire===
On August 6, 1894, the grandstand and bleachers of the original stadium were destroyed in a fire, inflicting $80,000 in damages (equal to $ today), which was covered fully by insurance. The fire also spread to the adjoining properties, causing an additional $20,000 in damage, equal to $ today.

While the Phillies were playing a short road trip and staging six home games at the University of Pennsylvania Grounds at 37th and Spruce, a building crew worked around the clock erecting temporary bleachers. The makeshift stands were finished in time for the game on August 18.

===1895 reconstruction and expansion===


During the 1894–95 off-season, the park was fully rebuilt, seated 18,800, and was dedicated on May 2, 1895.

The Phillies&#x27; National League Park was the first ballpark to be constructed primarily of steel and brick to prevent future fires. The ballpark had outer brick walls on all four sides, three wide steel stairways between decks, and a series of fifteen 30-foot heavy iron girders supporting the platforms and roof of the upper deck. The upper deck was made possible by the use of the cantilever system.

Cantilever design was a new architectural technique in stadium construction in 1894, and National League Park was the first to be constructed with it. The ballpark&#x27;s cantilevered concrete supports eliminated the need for many of the support columns in the pavilion that had made for &quot;obstructed view seating&quot; in the original ballpark and other stadiums. Use of the cantilever design would become, and continues to be standard in the construction of stadiums.

The sweeping curve behind the plate was about , and instead of angling back toward the foul lines, the foul ground extended all the way to the wall in right, and well down the left field line. The spacious foul ground allowed for a higher probability of foul flyouts and extended an advantage to pitchers.

Seats were added along the left field wall prior to the 1896 season.

The ballpark was held in such high regard that in April 1897, the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; reported on Phillies&#x27; outfielder Sam Thompson singing the park&#x27;s praises to the team&#x27;s new players as they returned to Philadelphia from spring training, &quot;...Thompson says that if he can see the cantilever just once more he will die happy. Many of the boys have never seen the monument at Broad and Huntingdon streets, and Samuel has given luminous descriptions of the hump, grade, and drainage system.&quot;

Prior to the 1897 season, Phillies owner John Rogers claimed that the ballpark&#x27;s capacity was 20,008.

During the August 8, 1903 game against Boston with 10,078 in the stands, an altercation between two drunken men and two teenage girls on 15th Street caught the attention of bleacher fans down the left field line. Many of the fans ran to the top of the wooden seating area, and the added stress on that section of the bleachers caused it to collapse into the street, killing 12 and injuring 232. This led to additional renovations to the stadium and forced ownership to sell the team.

The Phillies temporarily moved to the Philadelphia Athletics&#x27; home field, Columbia Park, while their ballpark was repaired. The Phillies played sixteen games at Columbia Park in August and September 1903.

The Phillies rebuilt the stands prior to the 1904 season, which had the effect of reducing capacity. Following the 1903 disaster, Phillies owner James Potter and the other club officers hosted National League president Harry Pulliam and the city&#x27;s baseball writers for a luncheon, and then made an official tour of the ballpark to show off the reconstructed and reinforced left field bleachers. The grandstand improvements were inspected by the City of Philadelphia&#x27;s Chief Building Inspector and granted his approval.

The Phillies&#x27; new ownership refurbished the ballpark further prior to the 1905 season. They had the grandstand painted and every seat cleaned. As they had the previous year before the season, the Phillies had the stands inspected by the chief of the city&#x27;s Bureau of Building Inspections prior to Opening Day, and publicized his approval that they met all codes.

The Phillies erected field-level seats extending from the left field stands around to the centerfield club house before the 1906 season, which increased capacity by 3,000 spectators. The ballpark had featured hanging seats in left field on Lehigh Avenue beneath which fans parked carriages, bicycles, and other vehicles; these accommodations were lost with the erection of the new left field stands.

Prior to the 1907 season, a new corrugated roof was placed over half of the grandstand, and the visiting team clubhouse was refurbished with new showers and other amenities. Through the 1907 season, the batters eye in centerfield was stonework and reflected the sun. Prior to the 1908 season, the Phillies&#x27; painted the stonework green to match the wood fences and reduce the glare; moved the score board to the right field foul line; and for the first time built covered dugouts described as &quot;small pavilion-like sheds erected over the players&#x27; bench, completely shutting the bench out from view of the people in the grandstand.&quot;

The park was refurbished again prior to the 1909 season with increased seating capacity, new box seats, and renovations to the players&#x27; clubhouse. The park itself was painted green which the Philadelphia Inquirer welcomed as an improvement &quot;instead of the old glaring assortment of rainbow colors which predominated in the past.&quot; It was around this time that the double deck on the first base side was extended from the dugout all the way to the right field corner. This extension ran parallel to the foul line instead of curving, resulting in a relatively large amount of foul territory. This factor gave the right fielder more room to catch foul fly balls, theoretically mitigating the close proximity of the outfield wall to some extent.

During a game on May 14, 1927, parts of two sections of the lower deck extension along the right-field line collapsed due to rotted shoring timbers, again triggered by an oversize gathering of people, who were seeking shelter from the rain. While no one died during the collapse, one individual died of heart failure in the subsequent stampede that injured 50. As in 1903, the Phillies rented from the A&#x27;s while repairs were being made to the old structure.

The left field stands and bleachers were entirely rebuilt with fresh lumber prior to the 1932 season.

While the ballpark would never feature its own floodlights for night games, the House of David baseball team, traveling with portable arc lights, played a Philadelphia All-Star team featuring Grover Cleveland Alexander at night before 8,000 fans on July 25, 1932. Alexander had led the Phillies to the 1915 pennant at the ballpark and was cheered warmly when he came to bat. The lights were placed on 50-foot-high poles around the playing field and powered by a portable 1000-watt generator with a 250-horsepower engine and radiator.

A small incident occurred overnight on August 2–3, 1935, when a lightning bolt hit the flagpole and splintered it. The reporter wryly observed that if the Phillies were to win the 1935 pennant, they would have no place to hang it. That was a safe proposition, as the Phillies finished in seventh place, games behind the first-place Chicago Cubs.

When the Phillies departed in 1938, the ballpark did not offer motor vehicle parking, and would never feature a separate press box nor public address system. The stadium would never feature its own lights for night games.

===The Baker Wall===

National League Park was distinguished by its right field wall which at its closest distance was only from home plate, with right-center only away. Behind the right field wall was North Broad Street and North Broad Street train station across the street.

The right field wall came to be known as the Baker Wall after William Baker, who ran the club from 1913 until his death in 1930. The right field wall and fence in its final form was high. By comparison, Fenway Park&#x27;s left field wall, the Green Monster, is high, and away.

The wall was an amalgam of different materials. It was originally a masonry structure topped by a wire fence.

With the advent of the live-ball era in 1920, it became significantly easier to hit home runs over the near right field wall. The Phillies extended the barrier upward with masonry, wood, and a metal pipe-and-wire fence. The lower part of the wall was rough and eventually a layer of tin was laid over the entire structure except for the upper part of the fence.

Because of its material, it made a distinctive sound when balls ricocheted off it, as happened frequently. The clubhouse was located above and behind the center field wall. No batter ever hit a ball over the clubhouse, but Rogers Hornsby once hit a ball through a window.

===1923 Baker Bowl naming===
The proper name of the original ballpark was Philadelphia Ball Park while the rebuilt structure from 1895 was National League Park.

The opening-day game program in 1887 called it Philadelphia Ball Park. Photographs during its later years show a sign on the ballpark&#x27;s exterior reading National League Park. The Phillies referred to it as National League Park in newspaper advertisements through the final game day, June 30, 1938.

Huntingdon Street Grounds was an early common name for the ballpark after the street running behind the first base line and intersecting Broad Street behind home plate where the ballpark&#x27;s primary entrance was located.

On July 11, 1923, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; coined the term Baker Bowl after then Phillies owner William F. Baker. Baker had purchased the club in 1913 and would own the club until his death in 1930.

Built for the expectations of baseball in the dead ball era, it came to be seen as cramped and inadequate during the post-1920 live ball era. The ballpark was written about as &quot;The Cigar Box&quot; and &quot;The Band Box&quot;, referring to the diminutive size of the outfield. After the close of the Baker Bowl, the terms &quot;cigar box&quot; and &quot;bandbox&quot; were subsequently applied to any &quot;intimate&quot; ballpark (like Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park or Brooklyn&#x27;s Ebbets Field) whose configurations were conducive to players hitting extra base hits and home runs.

The ballpark would also be referred to as &quot;The Hump&quot; in reference to the hill in center field covering the partially submerged railroad tunnel in the street beyond right field that extended through into center field. Outfielders would occasionally feel the rumblings of the trains passing underneath them.

===Philadelphia Phillies===

During the seasons the Phillies played there, they managed only one pennant, in 1915. The 1915 World Series was the first attended by a sitting US president, Woodrow Wilson, and the last to be played in a venue whose structure predated the establishment of the post-season interleague championship.

While the Phillies were occasionally at least respectable in the dead-ball era, once the lively ball was introduced the team became less competitive. It was an extremely hitter-friendly park, making it an especially difficult place to pitch. For a number of years, a huge advertising sign on the right field wall read &quot;The Phillies Use Lifebuoy&quot;, a popular brand of soap. This led to the oft-reported quip that appended &quot;... and they still stink!&quot; In 1936, a vandal snuck into the Baker Bowl one night and actually wrote that phrase on the Lifebuoy ad. Conventional wisdom ties their failures to the Baker Bowl, but they often finished poorly in Shibe Park as well.

At the ballpark on September 17, 1900, in game 1 of a doubleheader against the Cincinnati Reds, the Phillies were discovered to have been stealing opponents&#x27; signs using hidden wires and an electronic device. Phillies&#x27; backup catcher Morgan Murphy sat in the team&#x27;s centerfield clubhouse window which faced home plate. The Phillies ran wires from Murphy, under the field, to a battery-powered device in a box buried underneath the third-base coach&#x27;s box. From centerfield, Murphy would spot the opposing catcher&#x27;s signals, and then send an electronic signal – once for a fastball and twice for a breaking ball. Phillies infielder Pearce Chiles coached third-base, received the signal beneath his feet, and signaled to the batter.

Cincinnati shortstop Tommy Corcoran had noted Chiles&#x27; unusual leg jolts. In the third inning, Corcoran walked to the third-base coach&#x27;s box and began digging at the dirt with his cleats. Before the Phillies&#x27; groundskeeper could stop him, Corcoran had unearthed the electronic box and showed it to umpire Tim Hurst. Hurst disciplined no one, signaled the game to continue, and is reported to have shouted, &quot;Back to the mines, men!&quot;

On June 9, 1914, Honus Wagner hit his 3,000th career hit in the stadium. Babe Ruth, then with the Boston Braves, played his final major league baseball game in the Baker Bowl on May 30, 1935, grounding out to first base in his only at bat but getting an assist by throwing a runner out at home plate on a relay play from left field. He retired, at 40, after a poor start, confident of receiving a managerial offer, but one never came from any franchise, only a brief stint as a 1st base coach three years later for the Brooklyn Dodgers.

When the ballpark first opened, it was praised as among the finest baseball palaces in America. Phillies&#x27; ownership under Colonel John Rogers invested in the grounds and made continuous improvements the 1890s, and the Phillies&#x27; owners in the early 1900s did the same. William Baker, the Phillies&#x27; owner from 1913 to 1930, neglected the ballpark&#x27;s maintenance and allowed it to fall into disrepair. Baker died in 1930 in the early days of the Depression, and the Phillies new ownership were not in a position to make badly needed renovations.

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; ran a series of articles on baseball parks during the summer of 1937; the article on the Phillies&#x27; ballpark was merciless in its ridicule. Included was the oft-repeated joke of this era that the Phillies had remodeled the clubhouse by installing brand new nails to hang their clothes upon. This was in contrast to the 1890s when the same clubhouse was known for its handball court, pool, trainers&#x27; facilities, and locker room.
The ballpark was abandoned during the middle of the 1938 season, as the Phillies chose to move five blocks west on Lehigh Avenue to rent the newer and more spacious Shibe Park from the Athletics rather than remain at the Baker Bowl. Phillies president Gerald Nugent cited the move as an opportunity for the Phillies to cut expenses as stadium upkeep would be split between two clubs. The final game was played on June 30, when a crowd of only 1,500 spectators watched the Phillies lose to the New York Giants, 14–1.

At the Baker Bowl, the Phillies finished with a 30–38–1 record against the Athletics in City Series exhibition games.

===Philadelphia Eagles===

Philadelphia Ball Park was the first home field of the Philadelphia Eagles, who played there from 1933 through 1935. In their three seasons there, they had a 9–21–1 record.

Eagles&#x27; owner Bert Bell hoped to play home games at larger Shibe Park, but negotiations with the Athletics were not fruitful, and Bell agreed to a deal with Phillies&#x27; owner Gerry Nugent. For Eagles games, 5,000 temporary seats were erected along the right-field wall. The Eagles played their first game at the ballpark on October 3, 1933, a 40–0 pre-season victory over a U.S. Marines team; the game was played at night under rented floodlights. In the first regular-season game on October 18, 1933, 1,750 fans saw the Portsmouth Spartans beat the Eagles, 25–0. Later that season, 17,850 fans watched the Eagles tie the Chicago Bears on Sunday, November 12, 1933. Under Pennsylvania blue laws, Sunday games had been prohibited.

With the ballpark in poor condition, the Eagles left the ballpark after the 1935 season for the city-owned Municipal Stadium, which was then only 10 years old and could seat up to 100,000 spectators.

===Other tenants===
 
In addition to Phillies baseball and Philadelphia Eagles football, the ballpark served the city as a multipurpose playing field available to other teams.

The ballpark was selected as a neutral host site for Game 6 of the 1888 World Series played on October 22, 1888. 4,000 fans saw the National League New York Giants defeat the American Association St. Louis Browns including veteran journalist Henry Chadwick, and popular entertainers DeWolf Hopper and Digby Bell.

In 1894, six of the National League baseball clubs organized the American League of Professional Football Clubs, a professional soccer league. The league&#x27;s inaugural game was played at Philadelphia Ball Park on October 6, 1894. The playing field measured 160 by 330 feet, and 500 fans saw New York defeat Philadelphia 5 to 0.

The Cleveland Spiders played nine &#x27;home games&#x27; at the ballpark on July 29–30, August 5–6, 8, and 11, 1898.

The minor league baseball Tri-State League contested its 1904 championship game at the Phillies&#x27; ball park. York defeated Williamsport before 3,500 fans.

Central High School&#x27;s football team opened its season against Atlantic City High School on October 20, 1906, at the park.

During its tenure, the park hosted Negro league games, including four postseason seasons. In 1921, the Chicago American Giants (champions of the Negro National League) played a series against the team considered the best of the East in the Hilldale Club. The Baker Bowl hosted the first two games of a best-of-six series that Hilldale won three (with one tie).

Three years later, the venue hosted the first two games of the 1924 Colored World Series between the Kansas City Monarchs and the Hilldale Club that the Monarchs won in ten games. The following year, the two teams met again in the 1925 Colored World Series; the Baker Bowl hosted Game 5 and 6 in a series that saw Hilldale win their first and only World Series. The following year, the Bowl hosted Game 4 and 5 of the 1926 Colored World Series. It was during a 1929 exhibition with a Negro league team that Babe Ruth hit two home runs that landed about halfway into the rail yards across the street in right.

In 1923, Phillies Park hosted multiple college football games of Saint Joseph&#x27;s Hawks football. LaSalle University opened its 1932 football season at the ballpark hosting Mount St. Mary&#x27;s.

Boxing matches were held at the ballpark and attracted large crowds. 35,000 spectators saw George Godfrey lose on a foul to Primo Carnera on June 23, 1930.

===1938 to 1950===

Among all Major League Baseball parks whose permanent structures were built in the 19th century, the Baker Bowl remained open the longest, hosting its last game on June 30, 1938, or about years after it opened and 43 years after it had burned and been completely rebuilt. (Robison Field in St. Louis, the next-longest-lasting 19th-century big-league ballpark, had closed in 1920.)

As early as 1928, the ballpark&#x27;s site was put forth by the Greater Kensington Business Men&#x27;s Association as an advantageous location for the city&#x27;s proposed convention center. The ballpark was across the street from the Reading Railroad&#x27;s North Broad station and the city&#x27;s Broad Street Line subway had recently opened. The Philadelphia Convention Hall and Civic Center would be built in 1931 near the University of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia&#x27;s Center City.

After the Phillies moved to Shibe Park, its new owners renamed the lot Philadelphia Gardens and experimented with various types of events. For 1939 the roof and upper deck were peeled off and a midget-car race track was built around the inside perimeter.

In the summer of 1940, an ice rink of regulation hockey dimensions was installed, its underground machinery maintaining a frozen surface and enabling ice skating year round.

The old centerfield clubhouse was remodeled into a piano bar and entertainment venue called &quot;Dick McClain&#x27;s Alpine Musical Bar&quot; which opened on May 15, 1942, with the Harlem Highlanders. It would remain open until sometime in the summer of 1943.

Temple&#x27;s hockey team played some of their games at this site also.

In February 1946, Leonard Peto, owner of the former-Montreal Maroons NHL franchise, announced plans to revive the franchise in Philadelphia for the 1946-1947 NHL season as the league&#x27;s seventh team. By March 1946, Peto and his partners had identified the Phillies&#x27; park site for their planned 20,000 uptown arena. However, the group was unable to secure funding for the project and the arena was never built. Philadelphia would eventually receive an NHL expansion team in 1967.

By 1947, a business called Phillies Auto Mart at Broad and Huntington Streets advertised in the newspaper that prospective buyers could &quot;Try It Out On the Old PHILLIES Ballpark Racing Oval.&quot;

On July 11, 1950, one of the still standing structures at the southwest corner of Broad St and Lehigh Ave, repurposed into a bar and taproom, caught fire, and burned the 80-foot-long wooden structure to the ground. What was left of the ballpark was demolished afterwards.

==Legacy==
A Pennsylvania Historical marker stands on North Broad Street just north of West Huntingdon Street in Philadelphia. The marker is titled, &quot;Baker Bowl National League Park&quot; and the text reads,

The Phillies&#x27; baseball park from its opening in 1887 until 1938. Rebuilt 1895; hailed as nation&#x27;s finest stadium. Site of first World Series attended by U.S. President, 1915; Negro League World Series, 1924-26; Babe Ruth&#x27;s last major league game, 1935. Razed 1950.

The marker was dedicated on August 16, 2000, at Veterans Stadium during an on-the-field pre-game ceremony. The marker was unveiled by former Phillies shortstop Bobby Stevens, who played for the team in 1931, and then–current Phillies pitcher Randy Wolf. The marker was displayed at the Vet through the end of the 2000 season and then moved to the location of the ballpark, just behind where the right field foul pole would be.

Some distinctive buildings visible in vintage photos of the ballpark remain standing and help to mark the ballpark&#x27;s former location. The most prominent structure is the 10-story-tall, triangular building across Lehigh to the north-northeast, behind what was centerfield. It was originally a Ford Motor Company building, and was constructed during the 1914 season. Another is the neoclassical North Broad Street Station train depot building across Broad Street from what was the end of the first base grandstand, and where Huntingdon tees into Broad. It opened in 1929 and is visible in later aerial photos of the ballpark. The building itself now houses a homeless shelter.

The active and in-use North Broad station serving SEPTA Regional Rail&#x27;s Lansdale/Doylestown Line and Manayunk/Norristown Line stands behind the former station building.

The ballpark&#x27;s site now features a gas station and convenience store where the center-field clubhouse once stood, garages, and a car wash.

<doc id="754409" wikidata="Q17519" url="?curid=754409" title="Anousheh Ansari">
<text>Anousheh Ansari (; ; born September 12, 1966) is an Iranian-American engineer, space tourist, and entrepreneur. She is the co-founder and chairwoman of Prodea Systems, and her previous business accomplishments include serving as co-founder and chief executive officer of Telecom Technologies, Inc. On September 18, 2006, a few days after her 40th birthday, she became the first Iranian person to be in outer space. Ansari was the fourth overall self-funded space tourist and the first self-funded woman to fly to the International Space Station. Her memoir &quot;My Dream of Stars&quot;, co-written with American engineer Homer Hickam, was published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2010. 

She is also the chief executive officer of the XPRIZE Foundation, and the Ansari family is the title sponsor of the Ansari X Prize.

== Early life ==
Born Anousheh Raissyan in Mashhad, Iran, she and her parents moved to Tehran shortly afterward. When Ansari was six years old, her parents divorced. Ansari has a sister, Atousa Raissyan, who is five years younger. At the age of six, Ansari would visit her grandparents and sleep overnight on the balcony, as there was no air conditioning. Ansari would gaze at the night sky and was very curious about space. In Tehran, at the age of seven, Ansari attended a French Catholic school called Jeanne d’Arc. Half of the day was taught in Farsi while the other half was taught in French. She witnessed the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and recalls memories of &quot;hearing gun shots, screaming, people being killed, and explosions&quot;. From then on until the Iran–Iraq War, Ansari would have to take shelter in the basement of her apartment building, where she was the eldest of the children taking shelter. She would narrate stories to them, offering them comfort, which distracted them from the noise of bombs being dropped outside. Ansari immigrated to the United States in 1984 as a teenager, and attended a high school in Northern Virginia, Lake Braddock. Apart from her native Persian, she is fluent in English and French and acquired a working knowledge of Russian for her spaceflight experience.

She received her Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering and computer science at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, and her master&#x27;s degree at George Washington University in Washington D.C.

== Career ==
After graduation, Raissyan began work at MCI, where she met her future husband, Hamid Ansari. They married in 1991.

In 1993, she persuaded her husband and her brother-in-law, Amir Ansari, to co-found Telecom Technologies Inc., using their savings and corporate retirement accounts, as deregulation happened in the US telecommunications industry. The company was a supplier of softswitch technology that enabled telecom &quot;service providers to enhance system performance, lower operating costs and furnish new revenue opportunities.&quot; The company, headquartered in Richardson, Texas, offered products that allowed the integration between existing telecom networks and application-centric, next-generation networks via software switch technology. Telecom Technologies was acquired by Sonus Networks, Inc. in 2001 in a stock-for-stock transaction for 10.8 million shares of Sonus stock. Anousheh Ansari became &quot;a vice president of Sonus and general manager of Sonus&#x27; new INtelligentIP division.&quot;

In 2006, she co-founded Prodea Systems, becoming its chairwoman and CEO. Prodea is a technology and services management company. Prodea is a privately held company formed by the Ansari family with development centers in Richardson, Texas, and Silicon Valley.

== Space ==
Ansari has expressed that she does not consider herself a &quot;space tourist&quot; and prefers the title of &quot;spaceflight participant.&quot;

Ansari is a member of the X PRIZE Foundation&#x27;s Vision Circle, as well as its Board of Trustees. Along with her brother-in-law, Amir Ansari, she made a multimillion-dollar contribution to the X PRIZE foundation on May 5, 2004, the 43rd anniversary of Alan Shepard&#x27;s sub-orbital spaceflight. The X PRIZE has officially renamed the &quot;Ansari X PRIZE&quot; to honor their donation. As demonstrated by her commitment to the X PRIZE and through presentations at Space Enthusiast conferences, Ansari is a spokesperson for the &quot;privatization of space,&quot; a process enabling commercially viable companies to government-independently send equipment and people into space for exploration and other purposes.

The Ansari family also invested in a partnership with Space Adventures, Ltd. and the Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation (FSA) to create a fleet of suborbital spaceflight vehicles (the Space Adventures Explorer) for global commercial use.

=== Spaceflight ===

Ansari trained as a backup for Daisuke Enomoto for a Soyuz flight to the International Space Station, through Space Adventures, Ltd. On August 21, 2006, Enomoto was medically disqualified from flying the Soyuz TMA-9 mission that was due to launch the following month. The next day Ansari was elevated to the prime crew.
Asked what she hoped to achieve on her spaceflight, Ansari said, &quot;I hope to inspire everyone—especially young people, women, and young girls all over the world, and in Middle Eastern countries that do not provide women with the same opportunities as men—not to give up their dreams and to pursue them... It may seem impossible to them at times. But I believe they can realize their dreams if they keep it in their hearts, nurture it, and look for opportunities and make those opportunities happen.&quot; The day before her departure, she was interviewed on Iran national television for the astronomy show &quot;Night&#x27;s Sky&quot;. The hosts wished her success and thanked her on behalf of the Iranians. Ansari in return thanked them.

Ansari lifted off on the Soyuz TMA-9 mission with commander Mikhail Tyurin (RSA) and flight engineer Michael Lopez-Alegria (NASA) at 04:59 (UTC) on Monday, September 18, 2006, from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Ansari became the fourth (and first female) space tourist. Her contract did not allow for disclosure of the amount paid, but previous space tourists have paid more than $20 million USD. The spacecraft docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday, September 20, 2006, at 05:21 (UTC). Ansari landed safely aboard Soyuz TMA-8 on September 29, 2006, at 01:13 UTC on the steppes of Kazakhstan (90 kilometers north of Arkalyk) with U.S. astronaut Jeffrey Williams and Russian cosmonaut Pavel Vinogradov. She was given red roses from an unidentified official, and a kiss from her husband, Hamid. The crew&#x27;s rescuers moved them to Kustanai by helicopter for the welcome ceremony.

During her nine-day stay on board the International Space Station, Ansari agreed to perform a series of experiments on behalf of the European Space Agency. She conducted four experiments, including:
* Researching the mechanisms behind anemia.
* How changes in muscles influence lower back pain.
* Consequences of space radiation on ISS crew members and different species of microbes that have made a home for themselves on the space station.

She also became the first person to publish a weblog from space.

=== Iranian flag controversy ===

Ansari intended to wear the U.S. flag on her spacesuit alongside a politically neutral version of the Iranian flag, i.e., the simple 3-color flag with no government-specific emblem, to honor the two countries that have contributed to her life. A few U.S.-based media wrongly speculated that she intended to wear the version of the Iranian flag that predated the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.

At the insistence of the NASA and Russian officials, she did not wear the Iranian flag officially but wore the Iranian flag colors instead and kept the Iranian flag on her official flight patch. She and her husband said no political message was intended, despite the increasing tensions between the United States and Iran, which had dominated world headlines in the weeks leading up to her launch. She noted that she had &quot;plans to devote her mission to expanding a global consciousness she expected would be seeded with her first look at Earth from space.&quot;

=== Reactions to Ansari&#x27;s flight ===

==== Crewmates ====
Michael López-Alegría, the Spanish-born NASA astronaut who flew on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft on the return flight with Ansari, expressed his doubts to reporters before the flight: &quot;I&#x27;m not a big fan personally of having those guys go visit the space station because I think a space station is still a place that is under construction, and not quite operational. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ideal.&quot;

López-Alegría later stated that he was skeptical of private tourists a few years ago but now believes it is essential to the survival of the Russian space program, which is important to the U.S. space program: &quot;If that&#x27;s the correct solution... then not only is it good from the standpoint of supporting the Russian space program, but it&#x27;s good for us as well,&quot; he said. Ansari&#x27;s presence in space &quot;is a great dream and a great hope not just for our country but for countries all around the world.&quot;

The same Associated Press story also quoted Mikhail Tyurin describing Ansari as &quot;very professional&quot; and said he felt like they had worked together for a decade. López would eventually change his stance on tourism at the ISS and joined Axiom space, eventually commanding their first tourist mission.

==== Reactions in Iran ====

The flight was given significant coverage by Iranian state television, with an hour-long live interview with Ansari being broadcast on the show &quot;Asemane Shab&quot; (&quot;Night Sky&quot;). Ansari was praised by newspapers such as &quot;Hambastegi&quot; and &quot;Jam-e-Jam Daily&quot;, which published daily columns detailing the journey. The astronomy magazine &quot;NOJUM&quot; also published an exclusive interview of Pouria Nazemi with Ansari before her trip, in which she discussed her vision for commercial spaceflight. &quot;NOJUM&quot; also organized and held gatherings when the ISS passed over Iran&#x27;s cities. Shahram Yazdanpanah made a special part about Anousheh&#x27;s trip to space at the Persian &quot;Space Science&quot; website and covered all the trip news.

=== Interviews ===

On September 22, 2006, she told reporters she had no regrets and said, &quot;I am having a wonderful time here. It&#x27;s been more than I expected, and I enjoy every second of it. The entire experience has been wonderful up here.&quot;

== Awards and honors ==
Ansari has received multiple honors, including the George Mason University Entrepreneurial Excellence Award, the George Washington University Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award, the Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award for the Southwest Region, and the Horatio Alger Award. While under her leadership, Telecom Technologies, Inc. earned recognition as one of &quot;Inc. magazine&quot;″s 500 fastest-growing companies and one of Deloitte &amp; Touche&#x27;s Fast 500 technology companies. She was listed in &quot;Fortune Magazine&quot;″s 40 under 40 list in 2001 and honored by &quot;Working Woman&quot; as the winner of the 2000 National Entrepreneurial Excellence award.

In 2009, she received the first NCWIT Symons Innovator Award given annually by the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology to honor successful women entrepreneurs in technology.

She received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from her alma mater George Mason University on December 20, 2012.

The Ansari family was honored with an Orbit Award by the National Space Society and Space Tourism Society for underwriting the Ansari X Prize.

In 2010, she was awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor recognition of her humanitarian efforts.

In 2015, the National Space Society awarded Ansari the Space Pioneer Award for her &quot;Service to the Space Community.&quot;

==Other activities and public appearances==

Ansari participated as a speaker at the 2010 Honeywell Leadership Academy with Homer Hickam at United States Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama.

In 2009, Ansari was featured in the documentary film &quot;Space Tourists&quot; by independent Swiss filmmaker Christian Frei about billionaires who paid to ride to the International Space Station aboard Russian spacecraft. The DVD of the film was released in 2011.

She was the commencement speaker and received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Utah Valley University on April 25, 2013.

On February 26, 2017, she and Firouz Naderi represented Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi at the 89th Academy Awards. They accepted the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for &quot;The Salesman&quot; on Farhadi&#x27;s behalf. Farhadi did not attend the ceremony due to his opposition to President Trump&#x27;s immigration ban applying to seven Muslim countries, including Iran. Farhadi selected Ansari and Naderi as his representatives because both are successful Iranian-Americans who immigrated to the US.

Ansari has served on the boards of directors for Make-a-Wish Foundation of North Texas and Collin County Children&#x27;s Advocacy Center. She has been active with several nonprofit organizations, including the nonprofit Iranian American Women Foundation organization. Other non-profit organizations include Ashoka in its support of social entrepreneurs.

==Personal life==
While working at MCI, she met Hamid Ansari. They married in 1991. The Ansaris reside in Plano, Texas. She is also the aunt of the American actors Yara Shahidi and Sayeed Shahidi.

<text>Brighton &amp; Hove Bus and Coach Company Limited, trading as Metrobus, is a bus operator with routes in parts of Surrey, Kent, Sussex, and Greater London. Formed through a management buyout in 1983, Metrobus was purchased by the Go-Ahead Group in September 1999 and is now under the control of Brighton &amp; Hove, part of the Go-Ahead Group.

Metrobus previously operated many routes under contract to Transport for London in south and south-east London, but following a restructure, on 1 April 2014 these were transferred to Go-Ahead London under London General. The remaining commercial operations were brought under the control of Brighton &amp; Hove on 1 July 2014. On 2 September 2023, the operations of Southdown Buses were transferred to Metrobus.

==History==

In February 1981 the Orpington &amp; District bus company collapsed due to financial difficulties, and the Tillingbourne Bus Company based in West Surrey took over their operations, setting up Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) Limited. In July 1983, Metrobus Limited was formed when two directors, Gary Wood and Peter Larking, purchased the subsidiary.

The newly formed company acquired the former Orpington &amp; District garage at Green Street Green, Orpington, along with six employees and six vehicles. Three routes were operated by Metrobus at the time it was set up: 353 (Croydon to Orpington via Coombe Road, weekday peak hours only), 355 (Croydon to Forestdale, weekday peak hours only) and 357 (Croydon to Orpington via Forestdale, Monday-Saturday, all day).

In May 1982 a &#x27;shopper bus&#x27; service was introduced, running from Sanderstead to Bromley town centre via New Addington. In keeping with the route numbers of the former Tillingbourne services, this route was numbered 354. Due to requests from residents, the route also began to serve Bourne Vale and the Hayesford Park Estate, which were some distance from other bus services. In October 1983 the 354 was rerouted to cut out New Addington, and diverted at Addington to run to Croydon instead of Sanderstead. 

In 1986 route 355 was discontinued for short journeys between Croydon and Forestdale, and the 354 frequency increased and rerouted via Selsdon Vale (although the residents of the area refused to allow LT to put fixed bus stops in place). The route was also curtailed at Selsdon, although it was extended back to East Croydon the next year. By the summer of 1988, route 354 was offering an hourly service on Mondays to Saturdays between Croydon, Selsdon, Addington, Hayes and Bromley. In 1995 route 357 was withdrawn after routes 353 and 354 were re-timetabled.

Two coach operators, Southland Travel and RB Coaches, were taken over by Metrobus in October 1991 along with the ten vehicles originally owned by the companies. These coaches were used on the already existing private hire business, and to operate scheduled day trips to European destinations. In 2005, Southland Travel was purchased by Sullivan Buses, along with Polhill Garage. The business was later resold to its management.

In the summers of 1994 and 1995, Metrobus operated their &#x27;Wealdsman&#x27; service (numbered 746) to complement the Surrey Hills weekend leisure bus network. Metrobus used a specially painted blue and yellow AEC Regal IV (RF-class) vehicle, on loan from the Wealdsman Preservation Group, for the long service between Bromley and Tunbridge Wells, connecting with other leisure services (London &amp; Country Routemaster service 410 to Box Hill) at Westerham.

Throughout the late 1990s, Metrobus introduced other commercial routes operated under Section 3(2) of the London Regional Transport Act 1984 (later to become London Local Service Agreements), including the 351, 356 and 358. All such routes were later transferred to Transport for London in mid-2002, although the 358 still remains tendered to Metrobus as of 2012.

In September 1999, Metrobus was purchased by the Go-Ahead Group.

Routes 353 and 354 were altered due to the opening of Croydon Tramlink on 20 May 2000. Both routes were transferred to standard TfL contract; the 353 was withdrawn between Addington Village and Croydon, and the 354 (renumbered T33 to reflect its new status as a Tramlink &#x27;feeder&#x27; route) was withdrawn between Addington and Bromley.

Metrobus is the operator of the Fastway guided bus network in Gatwick and Crawley which opened in September 2003 in order to reduce congestion on the roads around Crawley by encouraging people to take the bus instead of using their cars.

On 8 December 2007, Metrobus took over the operations of First London&#x27;s Orpington garage. All the staff and 35 vehicles were included, although the garage itself was closed, with the &#x27;R&#x27; prefix routes transferring to the Orpington garage, and the T32 going to Croydon.

Routes 526/527 were lost in a Surrey County Council contract to Southdown PSV in January 2008 although regained in September 2012, and Route 100 (Maidenbower - Redhill) became part of the Fastway Network in Spring 2008.

In September 2009 it was announced that from 3 October 2009, Metrobus would take over Arriva Guildford &amp; West Surrey&#x27;s Horsham operations, including Horsham town routes, route 93 (Dorking - Horsham) and London Buses route 465 (Dorking - Kingston). Metrobus purchased 19 buses as part of the sale and moved operations away from Arriva&#x27;s site at Warnham to their existing depot in Crawley.

On 1 April 2014, Go-Ahead restructured the business with the management of the Transport for London contracted services passing to the control of Go-Ahead London under its London General subsidiary, with the remaining services administered by Brighton &amp; Hove from 1 July 2014. The commercial services retain the Metrobus brand as of April 2024.

===Incidents===
In March 2003, two Metrobus vehicles were involved in a fatal accident at Crawley bus station. A bus crashed into the back of another bus and mounted the kerb where passengers were waiting. As a result of the impact, one woman was killed and five others injured. Metrobus described themselves as &quot;devastated&quot; by the accident, and said it was their &quot;first major incident&quot;.

On 8 January 2011, one of Metrobus&#x27; vehicles was hijacked while in service in Merstham. The bus was empty having just dropped off the last passengers, and the bus driver managed to escape unharmed, along with the cash box the hijackers had tried to steal. The hijacked bus was then driven through the area, striking a number of parked cars and signs, before being reversed into another Metrobus vehicle which was in service with passengers. There were no injuries, but the road was closed for a number of hours while the police investigated. Two men, aged 23 and 25, were arrested. One was released on bail and the other was charged with seven separate offences.

On 13 August 2022, vehicle number 6559 burst to flames after a collision on the A24 in Ashington just north of Worthing while on route 23. Two people were taken to hospital and the vehicle was scrapped shortly after.

==Fleet==
As of October 2024, the Metrobus fleet consists of 192 buses.

===Fleet livery===
Metrobus initially had a blue and yellow livery. This was superseded by a two-tone blue livery in the early 2000s.

The majority of Crawley buses featured a light blue base with a dark blue roof which swoops down at the front. It also has a white stripe separating the roof from the base, and a light blue lower dash panel. The Fastway livery is a silver base with navy blue cantrail panels and a navy blue lower front panel. Some older buses feature light blue with a dark blue roof and skirt panels along with a dark blue lower dash panel.

Most buses had a blue, red and orange oblong shapes on the seats, or &quot;sails&quot;, however buses are now getting refurbished with Crawley&#x27;s &quot;Blue Moon&quot; moquette now becoming standard on all Metrobus buses. Fastway buses have a slightly different moquette, with the letters &quot;fw&quot; sewn into the fabric, along with dark grey vinyl inserts.

In 2015, Metrobus unveiled a new livery featuring a bright blue front with a dark blue rear separated by a yellow swoop with a dark blue panel on the front. This livery has since become the corporate livery of Metrobus. The new livery also featured a new moquette with predominantly blue with light blue circles and yellow dots.

==Garages==
Metrobus operates from garages in Crawley and Copthorne.

===Crawley (CY)===
====History====

Following the decision by Arriva to discontinue its operations in Crawley and most of East Surrey and West Sussex in March 2001, Metrobus purchased Arriva&#x27;s premises in Crawley, moved the company headquarters (along with all non-London routes) there and began to develop a commercial bus network in the town.

In October 2009, Arriva sold their Horsham bus operations to Metrobus. Metrobus took over operation of various Horsham town routes, route 93 to Dorking and London Buses route 465 which is run under contract jointly to Transport for London and Surrey County Council. Operations moved to Metrobus&#x27; existing depot in Crawley, away from the previous garage in Warnham which closed. All of Arriva&#x27;s single deckers based at Warnham transferred to Metrobus. Six Alexander Dennis Enviro200s used on the 465 continued on that route. Six Dennis Dart SLF/Plaxton Pointers were kept and were refurbished internally and repainted (390, 393, 394, 395, 396 and 398), these are currently being used on route 93 between Dorking and Horsham; and a further six (388, 399, 397, 389, 391 and 392) being sold on to other operators. A solitary Volvo Olympian/Northern Counties double-decker remained in operation with Arriva.

On 30 June 2012, route 465 passed to Quality Line. During August 2013, new Wright Eclipses with Volvo chassis have been ordered as a replacement for the ageing Scania OmniCitys currently employed on the Crawley Fastway. This will displace the Scanias to other &quot;country&quot; workings and facilitate the retirement of the remaining unrefurbished Caetano Nimbuses, whose refurbishments were cancelled. 10 Alexander Dennis Enviro200s were ordered to replace the non-DDA compliant Darts, in order to both modernise the fleet and to comply to new legislation by 2016. These entered service in March 2015.

In August 2016, Metrobus transferred 5 (out of a total of 31) Scania OmniCity double deckers from Brighton &amp; Hove to allow route 400 to be converted to double-deck operation. The other 26 arrived between November 2017 and June 2018 and this allowed retirement of all but two of the ageing dual door Scania OmniDekkas.

In January 2017, 17 new Wright StreetLites entered service. These are used on routes 2, 4, 5 and Fastway Route 100. Ten more StreetLites were delivered in May 2019, with 1 second hand Enviro200 acquired in January 2020 to replace an accident damaged StreetLite. 2 more Enviro200s arrived in March 2020 for the newly acquired E9 and E10 local routes in Epsom.

Metrobus received a fleet of 6 Wright Eclipse Gemini 2 bodied Volvo B9TLs in December 2020, once again from Brighton &amp; Hove. Numbered 6901 to 6906, they are currently mainly used on route 420.

Metrobus took delivery of Wright GB Kite Hydroliner FCEVs for use on the Fastway network in early 2023, with the official launch of the buses taking place on 29 June. To facilitate their delivery, Crawley depot was equipped with a hydrogen refuelling station that is capable of refuelling up to 100 buses. The stations store up to five tonnes of liquid hydrogen each in individual storage tanks and are capable of dispensing up to of vapourised fuel per hour, meaning a hydrogen bus at Crawley depot can be refuelled in around eight minutes. A further 34 hydrogen buses have been ordered for delivery to Crawley depot.

===Copthorne (CP)===
====History====
This garage was originally operated by Southdown Buses until 2 September 2023, when it was taken over by Metrobus. The buses&#x27; fleetcodes were renumbered into the Metrobus fleetcode sequence on 12 March 2023, after Southdown Buses was purchased by the Go-Ahead Group on 1 February 2023.

==Former garages==

Metrobus operated two depots that operated Transport for London contracted services. On 1 April 2014 in a reorganisation of the business, these were brought under the control of Go-Ahead London&#x27;s London General subsidiary.

=== Croydon (C)===
Croydon garage operated London bus routes 119, 127, 202, 293, 359, 405, 434 and 455.

==== History ====
The Beddington Lane depot was opened by Metrobus in December 2005 to house route 127 which had been surrendered early by Centra. Work was completed on the garage buildings in February 2006. This garage took over the London routes that ran from Godstone with the exception of the 146 and 246 which moved to Orpington.

On 19 May 2012, route T33 passed to Abellio London and route 54 was transferred to this garage.

===Orpington (MB)===

Orpington garage operated London bus routes 119 (night service only on this 24-hour route), 126, 138, 146, 161, 162, 181, 233, 284, 320, 336, 352, 353, 358, 464, B14, R1, R2, R3, R4, R6, R8, R9, R11, and school route 654.

A former farm, Orpington depot was for many years the only garage for all of Metrobus&#x27; London tendered routes since the award of route 61 in 1986. More recently routes have been operated from Godstone and in December 2005 a new depot was constructed in Croydon to cope with new tender awards. During mid-2005 major reconstruction started on the Green Street Green site to make improvements and provide an expansion. During these works, a temporary base was being used on Polhill, near Halstead, next to the base of what was Southlands Travel.

On 23 February 2013, Metrobus commenced operating route 233, later commencing their operations of route 126 in March of the same year.

<doc id="754440" wikidata="Q3886817" url="?curid=754440" title="Suitland, Maryland">
<text>Suitland is a suburb of Washington, D.C., approximately one mile (1.6 km) southeast of Washington, D.C. Suitland is a census designated place (CDP), as of the 2020 census, its population was 25,839. Prior to 2010, it was part of the Suitland-Silver Hill census-designated place.

==History==
Suitland is named after 19th century landowner and businessman Senator Samuel Taylor Suit, whose estate, &quot;Suitland&quot;, was located near the present-day intersection of Suitland and Silver Hill Roads.

===17th and 18th centuries===
In the 1600s, the Piscataway tribe inhabited the lands in southern Maryland. European settlers first visited Saint Clement&#x27;s Island on the Potomac River and then established their first Maryland colony downriver at Saint Mary&#x27;s City in 1634, and by the 1660s through the 1680s, settlers had moved into what is now known as Prince George&#x27;s County. Faced with this encroachment, the Piscataways left the area in 1697, and moved north to what is now known as Coney Island. They eventually moved further north into Pennsylvania and Michigan. The sole export of the European settlers was tobacco, and slaves were first brought to the county in the 1700s.

===19th century===
Prior to the Civil War, tobacco production had made Prince George&#x27;s County one of the wealthiest counties in Maryland, and half of the county&#x27;s population was enslaved. After the war, old plantations were broken up and replaced by communities centered on small farming and country villages.

In 1867, Samuel Taylor Suit moved to Maryland and purchased more than 800 acres (320 ha) near Washington, D.C. In the 1870s and 1880s, such prominent guests as U.S. Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes visited the Suitland estate. It was the 1871 site of negotiations preliminary to the international tribunal in Geneva that arbitrated the Alabama Claims. After Suit&#x27;s death in 1888, portions of the estate were sold (&quot;circa&quot; 1892 to 1903) to William A. Harrison, and the land was subsequently subdivided and sold over the years. Suit&#x27;s son, Arthur B. Suit, retained three acres (1.2 ha) of land near the corner of Suitland and Silver Hill Roads, where he maintained a general store, a bar, a bowling alley, and the community&#x27;s one-room jailhouse.

===20th century ===
By the turn of the century, the village of Suitland had added a post office, churches, and several houses. On August 10, 1909, local residents met at the home of George J. Hess and organized the Suitland Improvement Association of Maryland to raise funds for a community meeting hall. Three officers were elected to serve one-year posts: President, Dr. C. M. Emmons; Vice President, C. L. Jenkins; and Secretary and Treasurer, George J. Hess. The Association was incorporated on November 17, 1950, and is now known as the Suitland Civic Association.

There are two historic cemeteries in Suitland: Cedar Hill and Lincoln Memorial. Cedar Hill Cemetery was founded in 1895 and built on the former Nonesuch Plantation. Prior to 1913, it was known as Forest Lake Cemetery and was likely renamed after the cedar trees that lined both sides of Suitland Road from the D.C. line to Silver Hill Road. Early churches performed baptisms at this location and it is also the burial site for victims of the 1906 Terra Cotta Railroad wreck. Lincoln Memorial Cemetery was founded in 1927 on the former Landon dairy farm and is the site where many prominent African-Americans are buried. Individuals include Dr. Charles Richard Drew, who established improved techniques for blood storage and developed large scale blood banks early in World War II, and Nannie Helen Burroughs, educator and civil rights activist.

The first one-room schoolhouse was built in 1891 on land purchased by the community. A two-room schoolhouse was later built in 1915 on Silver Hill Road, expanded to four rooms in 1922, and saw additions to the building in 1928, 1941, and 1957.

Property owned by James West and Joseph Friday, located near the current intersection of Swann and Silver Hill Roads, was used as an airfield from 1938 to 1941. Named &quot;Skyhaven&quot; by a local student who won the naming contest sponsored by West and Friday, Skyhaven Airfield hosted a flying club that served 20 small planes, including Wacos, Great Lakes, and Pipers.

Suitland remained a rural farming community until the onset of World War II. To meet the need for additional office space to support the war effort, in September 1941, the Public Buildings Administration awarded a $2,749,000 contract to McCloskey and Co. of Philadelphia to develop a new federal office building in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. Later that year, 437 acres (177 ha) of farm and dairy land were purchased in Suitland to build the Suitland Federal Center. The 12 existing residences on this property included the former dairy and summer home of Albert Carry, the German-American founder of the National Capital Brewing Company and the Carry Ice Cream Co. The Suitland House, built by Lowell O. Minear, a pioneer designer of memorial parks, is the sole remaining residence on the Federal Center property. A colonial-revival style home, it now serves as office space for the U.S. Census Bureau and is included in the Prince George&#x27;s County Planning Department&#x27;s 2010 &quot;Approved Historic Sites and Districts Plan&quot;.

In 1942, the Suitland Manor apartments were built in anticipation of new federal workers. Parkway Terrace, Whitehall Square, and Marlborough House developments soon followed to accommodate the influx of Census Bureau and other federal employees. In 1943, the Census Bureau turned 14 acres (5.7 ha) of land at the Federal Center site into the largest Victory Garden in the Washington metropolitan area. The land was a parceled into 616 plots and plowed, fertilized, and tended by census employees. As late as 1989, 110 garden plots were still available for summer rental on a first-come, first-served basis for $7.00 each. These gardens were located at the site of the current Naval Intelligence Building.

In 1944, the Suitland Parkway was opened to connect the Army&#x27;s Bolling Air Force Base (Bolling Field) to the Camp Springs Army Military Reservation, later named Andrews Air Force Base and now known as Joint Base Andrews. The of highway, originally named the Fighter Command Station Access Parkway, was initially limited to military use only and came under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service in 1949.

Suitland Junior-Senior High School (now Suitland High School), was the first high school in Suitland. The building was dedicated on November 15, 1951, to the high ideal of freedom of education, with John W. McNamara presiding as master-of-ceremonies and principal Thomas Warthen accepting the dedication on behalf of the students and faculty. Nearby was also LaReine High School, offering a Roman Catholic education for girls. LaReine was eventually closed, and its students transferred to nearby Bishop McNamara High School which became co-educational.

The 1950s and 1960s were a period of major growth for Suitland, as new middle and working-class families settled into the newly built residential communities. However, this population boom came to an end around 1970 due to several converging factors. These included the availability of cheaper land and lower taxes in neighboring county jurisdictions; the ending of the postwar baby boom; the slowdown in the rate of federal government growth; and migration patterns spurred by school busing mandates leading to regional demographic shifts.

The 1970s were both the beginning of a period of population adjustment and a recognition of Suitland&#x27;s unique local history. Beginning in 1973, Prince George&#x27;s County became the largest school district to adopt a busing plan after the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling on Brown v. Board of Education. The demographic changes caused by desegregation busing changed the county, transforming a great number of neighborhoods that were formerly white and middle-class to majority black and middle-class, and these shifts are reflected in the current population demographic of the Suitland CDP.

In 1975, local historian Darlie Norton was elected to draft a local history of the township in preparation for Suitland&#x27;s centennial celebration. &quot;A History of Suitland, Maryland, 1867–1976&quot; (1976) includes a detailed history of early residents, businesses, land purchases, and the development of Suitland civic, public, and private enterprises. That same year, local resident Walter Coley organized a committee within the Suitland Civic Association to preserve the Suitland Bog, which led to the purchase of 20 acres (8.1 ha) of woods and wetland by the Maryland National Capitol Park and Planning Commission.

In the 1980s, crime associated with vandalism, property violations, landlord absenteeism, and drugs were seen as a threat to the federal workers who were now commuting into Suitland from outside the community, and in 1983, a razor wired fence was erected around the Federal Center complex. Through most of this decade, neighborhoods near the Federal Center remained distressed and in need of a plan for positive change and growth.

In the mid-1990s, county executive Wayne Curry conceived a plan to revitalize Suitland as part of a greater county-wide effort to improve townships located inside the Beltway. In 1997, as the first stage of the Prince George&#x27;s County Redevelopment Authority project to reduce local crime rates and revitalize the site, the Manchester Square housing development was turned over to the county. Two years later, the fence surrounding the Federal Center was replaced with a regular wrought iron fence. Notoriously in 2003, two business women in their 70s were murdered during a robbery at their retail flower shop on Suitland Road. As of Spring 2019, most of the retail district along Suitland Road across from the Census Bureau has been torn down, with plans for building new residential/retail ventures finally moving forward.

===21st century===

The Suitland station on the Washington Metro&#x27;s Green Line opened to the public January 13, 2001.

In 2004, Windsor Crossing, a $45 million multifamily condominium complex built by Stavrou Associates in partnership with the Prince George&#x27;s Redevelopment Authority, was completed on the former Manchester Square development. In 2005, the $15.7 million Suitland Elementary School was opened to the public as part of the revitalization plan. The defense departments Base Realignment Commission initiatives resulted in major changes at Andrews Air Force Base with hundreds of new employment positions anticipated over the coming decades.

In 2006, multi-million-dollar federal renovations of the U.S. Census Building and National Oceanic and Atmospheric headquarters were completed. On October 1, 2009, Andrews Air Force Base, along with Naval Air Facility Washington, became a joint base known as Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility Washington, or Joint Base Andrews. Renovations were completed at the Spauldings Branch Library in 2012, which while located in District Heights, MD also serves Suitland and surrounding communities.

Recent developments in Suitland include a double-digit fall in crime rates and increased development in the surrounding county. These include National Harbor to the south, Konterra to the north, Joint Base Andrews to the east of town, and the continuing development and/or gentrification of southeast Washington D.C. to the west. Several currently under-utilized Metro Stations in or around Suitland promise further development, as does recent legislation permitting gaming/casinos to be located in National Harbor. Two more revitalization projects were announced to the public in 2012: the &quot;Buy Suitland&quot; initiative and the Green Suitland Neighborhood Stabilization Project.

The &quot;Buy Suitland&quot; initiative offers up to 5% purchase price to first time home buyers, up to 7% purchase price to local civic workers, or 35% of purchase price or $40,000 to debt-to-income candidates for properties located in 11 census tracts. Green Suitland NSP is allocating over $2 million for the purchase of foreclosed and abandoned homes to be rehabilitated with enviro-friendly, cost-saving upgrades before they are resold.

==Geography==
As an unincorporated area, Suitland&#x27;s boundaries are not officially defined. The U.S. Geological Survey locates the center of Suitland at 38°50&#x27;49&quot;N 76°55&#x27;33&quot;W.

<text>Bishonen... (; literally: &quot;Passion Between Beautiful Youths&quot;) is a 1998 Hong Kong romantic drama film about an ill-fated gay romance. Written and directed by Yonfan, the film stars Stephen Fung, Daniel Wu and Shu Qi.

In 2011, the film was screened at the 16th Busan International Film Festival as part of a retrospective of Yonfan&#x27;s work, which featured seven of his restored and re-mastered films from the 1980s through the 2000s.

==Synopsis==
Jet (Stephen Fung) is a handsome gay hustler whose sex appeal seems to know no bounds. Everyone wants to make love to him, but he is in love with no one but himself and he is very picky about his clients. Things change drastically when he notices what seems like a young couple in a shop, Sam (Daniel Wu) and Kana (Shu Qi). At first sight, he falls in love with Sam and begins following the two around trying to get noticed by him.

Jet&#x27;s friend Ching, who is also a hustler, runs a personal ad in a gay magazine for Jet, imploring Sam to contact Jet. At first, Jet is angry with Ching for not asking him, but his wrath subsides quickly when indeed he meets Sam again in what seems like a chance encounter. Sam turns out to be a police officer and Jet starts to befriend him, hoping this will turn into a relationship. But Sam does not seem to notice Jet&#x27;s intentions. Jet quickly gains love and trust of Sam&#x27;s parents and visits them often and helping them with chores and is jealous by the love and affection Sam receives and really wants to become a part of it.

Unbeknownst to Jet, Sam had a relationship with pop star Kingsley aka K.S. (Terence Yin) five years earlier. At the same time, Ching had been in unrequited love with Sam (then calling himself Fai) when the two were co-workers in an office. Then just a small star, K.S spends too much money on clothes and other expenses. Sam borrows some money from Ching to pay for his boyfriend&#x27;s expenses, unbeknownst to Sam, Ching made the money by becoming a hustler hoping that he can finally settle down with Sam after saving enough money. But Kingsley&#x27;s expenses just increases so Sam starts renting himself out to make some money for his boyfriend. But he eventually leaves Kingsley and Ching behind and joins the police department to become an officer like his father.

In the present day Jet feels more and more guilty about his profession due to his love towards Sam. One day Jet spends a night in Sam&#x27;s apartment because he lost his key but nothing happens between them even though Jet wanted this occasion to be their special moment where his love finally get recognized. Disappointed Jet travels to one of his usual part and hooks up with Kingsley. After having sex Kingsley says that Jet smells like someone he used to know. Jet&#x27;s guilt only increases after this event.

Jet continues to hang out with Sam and one day he gets hurt while playing beach volleyball. Sam helps Jet to get to his apartment which he shares with Ching. Ching comes in after work instantly recognizes Sam as Fai and is furious with Jet for stealing his beloved. Sam runs back to his apartment, but Jet pursues him. The two kiss, but they are interrupted by an unknown person at the door. Sam quickly rushes to find who it is but that person had already left.

Later, Sam while having dinner with his parents he finds out that it was his father who was there that day. Unwilling to face his father&#x27;s disappointment, he kills himself. Jet, depressed with Sam&#x27;s death, continues to live on as a hustler. Kana brings Jet a letter written by Sam before he committed suicide, informing Jet that Sam loved him and attached to the letter was the personal ad Ching ran on the magazine Sam was keeping like a treasure with him. Jet goes to sleep that night peacefully after knowing someone truly loved him and Sam appears in his dreams for the first time.

<text>Derby Midland F.C. were an English football club, in existence from 1881 until 1891. However, the first known match played by Derby Midland Club was a game of 15 each side against Wirksworth Football Club in 1873.

The club were founder members of the Midland Football League in 1889. They finished second in 1889–90 and fourth in 1890–91. In the FA Cup, they progressed to the third round in 1883–84 and the second round in 1885-86 and 1889–90. In 1891, the club merged with Derby County, who were playing in the Football League.

<text>Mormon fiction is generally fiction by or about members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), who are also referred to as Latter-day Saints or Mormons. Its history is commonly divided into four sections as first organized by Eugene England: foundations, home literature, the &quot;lost&quot; generation, and faithful realism. During the first fifty years of the church&#x27;s existence, 1830–1880, fiction was not popular, though Parley P. Pratt wrote a fictional &quot;Dialogue between Joseph Smith and the Devil&quot;. With the emergence of the novel and short stories as popular reading material, Orson F. Whitney called on fellow members to write inspirational stories. During this &quot;home literature&quot; movement, church-published magazines published many didactic stories and Nephi Anderson wrote the novel &quot;Added Upon&quot;. The generation of writers after the home literature movement produced fiction that was recognized nationally but was seen as rebelling against home literature&#x27;s outward moralization. Vardis Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Children of God&quot; and Maurine Whipple&#x27;s &quot;The Giant Joshua&quot; were prominent novels from this time period. In the 1970s and 1980s, authors started writing realistic fiction as faithful members of the LDS Church. Acclaimed examples include Levi S. Peterson&#x27;s &quot;The Backslider&quot; and Linda Sillitoe&#x27;s &quot;Sideways to the Sun&quot;. Home literature experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1980s and 1990s when church-owned Deseret Book started to publish more fiction, including Gerald Lund&#x27;s historical fiction series &quot;The Work and the Glory&quot; and Jack Weyland&#x27;s novels.

Latter-day Saint authors are well-represented in various literary genres. A tradition of conforming to conventions and building communities may explain why Mormon authors are successful in genre fiction. Glenn Beck, Jason F. Wright, and Richard Paul Evans have written inspirational fiction featured on New York Times bestseller lists. Orson Scott Card, Stephenie Meyer, and Brandon Sanderson are award-winning popular authors of science fiction and fantasy novels. Shannon Hale, James Dashner, and Ally Condie are popular authors of young adult science fiction and fantasy. The Association for Mormon Letters and LDStorymakers support their faith&#x27;s authors with awards and conferences.

There have been some controversies over Mormon authors and their works. Brian Evenson resigned from his job at Brigham Young University (BYU) after controversy over his short story collection. In the past, Deseret Book has declined to sell books from popular authors because of their content. In 2013, Cedar Fort refused to sell a contracted book after one of the authors wanted to include a reference to his male partner in his author bio.

==History==

Mormon fiction&#x27;s history begins at the same time as the LDS Church. The history of LDS literature is generally divided into four periods, as organized by Eugene England in his article on the subject.

===Foundations: 1830–1880===
Early written works among Mormons were generally non-fiction, including scripture, missionary tracts, and doctrinal literature. In 1844, Parley P. Pratt published what is commonly cited as the first work of LDS fiction, the didactic &quot;Dialogue between Joseph Smith and the Devil&quot;. It was first published in the New York Herald. Early Mormon leaders like Brigham Young and George Q. Cannon condemned novels for wasting time, a rhetoric that persisted until the 1880s.

===Home literature: 1880–1930===
Fiction among LDS Church members developed once the Mormons had settled in Utah and developed a degree of economic stability. In 1888, Orson F. Whitney called for an increase in &quot;home literature&quot;, a &quot;literature whose top shall touch heaven&quot;. He contributed his own poetry to the efforts. In response to Whitney&#x27;s call, LDS periodicals published didactic stories. There was still resistance to the idea of reading fiction. In 1879, a church magazine called &quot;Contributor&quot; was started to encourage members to write. The third issue condemned fiction as unhealthy for the mind and did not publish it in early issues. Later, in 1889, B. H. Roberts wrote an essay for &quot;Contributor&quot; on how fiction had increased in scope and popularity, and published his own historical short fiction, &quot;A Story of Zarahemla&quot;, in the periodical that year. &quot;Woman&#x27;s Exponent&quot;, founded in 1872 and &quot;Young Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, starting in 1889, also published home literature. &quot;Relief Society Magazine&quot; started in 1915, with an entire department dedicated to &quot;Arts and Literature&quot;.
The most successful work of LDS fiction in this period was the novel &quot;Added Upon&quot; (1898) by Nephi Anderson. Following a man and woman from their pre-earth life, through life on the earth and into the afterlife, &quot;Added Upon&quot; also served as a model plot for later LDS fictional works, such as the 1970s musical &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Warrior&quot; by Lex de Azevedo. Michael Austin noted in 1998 that &quot;Added Upon&quot; opened the door to fiction based on Mormon theology. Josephine Spencer was another popular writer who Gean Clark called the &quot;most versatile and skillful&quot; of early Mormon writers.

Brigham Young&#x27;s daughter, Susa Young Gates, published a fairly successful novel, &quot;John Stevens&#x27; Courtship&quot; (1909), and B. H. Roberts wrote the novel &quot;Corianton&quot;, which Orestes Utah Bean plagiarized into a play and adapted into a movie. The literary development in this period stimulated the development of the first professional LDS publishing company in 1866. Originally independent of the church, George Q. Cannon and Sons is now part of Deseret Book.

===The &quot;lost&quot; generation: 1930–1970===
While this &quot;home literature&quot; has continued to be produced ever since, a new generation of LDS writers arose in the mid century, one that was able to be published nationally and gain national recognition, but generally at the expense of close ties to the church and in rebellion against the moralism of &quot;home literature&quot;, leading this generation to be called the &quot;lost&quot; generation.

Vardis Fisher was born in Idaho and his parents were Mormon; he joined the LDS Church briefly as an adult but did not identify as Mormon. Mormon characters are prominent in his early fiction. He won the Harper Prize in 1939 for &quot;Children of God&quot; (1939). Fisher&#x27;s later fiction does not feature Mormon characters. In a 1976 paper, Leonard Arrington and his student, John Haupt, renewed interest in Fisher&#x27;s Mormon heritage, arguing that he did not completely reject Mormonism. Fisher&#x27;s widow subsequently issued a press release stating that Fisher was not Mormon. A 2014 &quot;Dialogue&quot; essay by Michael Austin concluded that Fisher was definitely influenced by the religion he rejected.

&quot;Historical-regional&quot; novels were prevalent during this era, which Karl Keller called the &quot;best fiction to come out of the Church&quot; and criticized it as a byproduct of &quot;a history and lifestyle that has &quot;already&quot; been created&quot;. In this genre of &quot;provincial&quot; novels, Samuel W. Taylor wrote the humorous &quot;Heaven Knows Why&quot; (1948). Maurine Whipple won the Houghton Mifflin Literary Prize in 1938 and published &quot;The Giant Joshua&quot; (1941), which presented plural marriage as a test of faith similar to colonizing Utah&#x27;s desert. In &quot;Fifty Important Mormon Books&quot;, Curt Bench reported that Mormon scholars in 1990 unanimously chose &quot;The Giant Joshua&quot; as the best Mormon novel before 1980. Virginia Sorensen is best known for &quot;A Little Lower than the Angels&quot; (1942), which also addressed the emotional hardship of polygamy, and the acclaimed &quot;The Evening and the Morning&quot; (1949). Her children&#x27;s book, &quot;Miracles on Maple Hill&quot; (1957), won a Newbery Award. Edward Geary wrote that Sorenson &quot;perhaps realizes regionalist&#x27;s ambivalence more completely than any other&quot;. Other notable writers from this period include Paul Bailey, Ardyth Kennelly, Lorene Pearson, and Blanche Cannon. These &quot;provincial&quot; novels often feature a protagonist who belongs to her community, yet desires to leave. Another character, usually a man, is committed to community values and grows fanatical, opposing the protagonist. A third character, usually the child of the first two characters, leaves the community for a more individualistic life. Often a fourth character will take on the role of &quot;liberating Gentile&quot;, an outsider who tempts characters to leave their community or violate its norms. In an analysis of the &quot;lost&quot; generation, Terryl Givens argues that the novels from this era were &quot;too compliant with the voices of criticism and cynicism to produce an art fully worthy of its subject.&quot;

===Faithful realism: 1960 to present===
In the 1960s, Clinton F. Larsen developed poetry in a faithful modernist style, but it was not until the mid-1980s that novels emerged in this mode. Starting in the 1970s, BYU professors Douglas Thayer and Donald R. Marshall began to write skillful stories that explored Mormon thought and culture in a critical but fundamentally affirmative way. Marshall published collections &quot;The Rummage Sale: Collections and Recollections&quot; (1972) and &quot;Frost in the Orchard&quot; (1977). Thayer began publishing stories in BYU Studies and &quot;Dialogue&quot; in the mid-1960s, and published his collection of short stories, &quot;Under the Cottonwoods&quot;, in 1977. In 1974, Karl Keller praised Thayer for using &quot;concrete, worldly symbols&quot; to articulate his faith, but stated that his work did not go as far as creating a world where Mormon theology was &quot;concretely true&quot;. Keller called on authors to follow Flannery O&#x27;Conner&#x27;s example and let religion be &quot;the light by which [they] see&quot; rather than a substitute for seeing.

Levi S. Peterson, influenced by Thayer, wrote &quot;The Backslider&quot; (1986), which Terryl Givens called the &quot;standard for the contemporary Mormon novel&quot;. Common themes in Peterson&#x27;s work are the conflict between justice and mercy and between religious and secular thought. Eugene England hailed Linda Sillitoe&#x27;s &quot;Sideways to the Sun&quot; (1987) as &quot;the first good Mormon novel about 1980s Mormon life in Utah.&quot; It features a typical Mormon housewife whose husband disappears, leading her to form a new, more independent identity. Also in 1987, Orson Scott Card published &quot;Seventh Son&quot;, which England wrote &quot;raises troubling questions about the supposedly sharp borderline between magic and religion.&quot;

The &quot;faithful realism&quot; genre of LDS fiction refers to &quot;challenging Mormon-themed fiction&quot; written by Mormons for Mormons, and only represents a small part of LDS fiction. Other writers in this genre include Margaret Blair Young, Phyllis Barber, Marilyn Brown, and John Bennion. Richard Cracroft called Douglas Thayer&#x27;s &quot;The Tree House&quot; (2010) the &quot;best LDS literary novel of recent decades&quot;. The Mormon missionary novel, a common Mormon Bildungsroman, commonly falls under the faithful realism or modern home literature genre; Michael Fillerup&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the River&quot; and Alan Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Angel of the Danube&quot; (2000) fall on the faithful realism side of the spectrum. Faithful realist fiction has been anthologized by Levi Peterson in &quot;Greening Wheat: Fifteen Mormon Short Stories&quot; (1983), by Eugene England in &quot;Bright Angels and Familiars&quot; (1992), in by Orson Scott Card and David Dollahite in &quot;Turning Hearts: Short Stories on Family Life&quot; (1994) and by Angela Hallstrom in &quot;Dispensation&quot; (2010). Eugene England noted that &quot;In Our Lovely Deseret&quot;, while also a realist anthology, differed notably from the faithful realist anthologies by having stories with &quot;in-your-face &quot;im&quot;piety.&quot; In 2017, the Mormon blog By Common Consent started the By Common Consent Press, a volunteer, non-profit press.

Mormon, or formerly Mormon, authors also write literary fiction for a general audience. Terry Tempest Williams&#x27;s &quot;Refuge&quot; is commonly anthologized and taught in college classes. Works by Walter Kirn and Judith Freeman appeal to non-Mormon audiences and deal with Mormon issues.

===Mormon folk realism: 2000–present===
Writing for &quot;Irreantum&quot; in 2000, Eric Eliason described Phyllis Barber&#x27;s &quot;Parting the Veil&quot; as part of a Mormon magical realism movement in Mormon fiction, along with works by Orson Scott Card and Levi Peterson. He stated that their work &quot;allows for the reality of sacred experience and the possibility of bumping into beings of light&quot;. In his dissertation on Mormon Literature, Scott Hales proposed a new type of Mormon literature that embraces ambiguity and is more concerned with the experience of Mormonism than its truth. It tends to blur genres and subvert expectations, and includes a range of literary styles. Hales attributes this shift to the way the LDS church has changed how it interacts with the public opinions of its members. In the early 1990s, several intellectuals were excommunicated in connection with their ideas and criticism of the church. Later, when church members began voicing opinions online on social media and in the Mormon blogosphere, communal criticism and doctrinal speculation became more common and unlikely to lead to ecclesiastical action. The New Mormon Fiction provides a place for readers to &quot;explore the cultural upheaval that surrounds them&quot;. Hales and William Morris have since suggested that this type of literature be called &quot;Mormon Folk Realism&quot;. Hales lists the work of several authors as falling under this category, including Arianne Cope&#x27;s &quot;The Coming of Elijah&quot; (2006), Coke Newell&#x27;s &quot;On the Road to Heaven&quot; (2007), Todd Robert Peterson&#x27;s &quot;Family History&quot; (2007), Brady Udall&#x27;s &quot;The Lonely Polygamist&quot; (2010), and Steven L. Peck&#x27;s &quot;The Scholar of Moab&quot; (2011).

===Modern home literature: 1980–present===
Authors produced a new &quot;home literature&quot; of uplifting literature marketed to Mormon audiences and usually published by Deseret Book. Popular authors in the 1980s included Jack Weyland and Blaine M. Yorgason. In the 1990s, Deseret Book, Bookcraft, and Covenant Communications, publishers targeting the LDS market, started selling more works of fiction. Other small publishers also started publishing fiction for the LDS market. Deseret Book published &quot;The Work and the Glory&quot; historical fiction series by Gerald Lund. The popular nine-volume series sold over two million copies. Dean Hughes is known for the series &quot;Children of the Promise&quot;, set in World War II, and &quot;Hearts of the Fathers&quot;, which follows the same family into the 1960s. Tennis Shoes Among the Nephites, a series about people transported into scriptural times, was also published in the 1990s. Anita Stansfield&#x27;s Mormon romance, &quot;First Love and Forever&quot; (1994), sold over 40,000 copies and paved the way for similar novels, such as those by Susan Evans McCloud, Rachel Nunes, and Jennie Hansen.

In a 2010 essay examining how LDS fiction has changed since the 1990s, Jennie Hansen wrote that the writing improved over time and LDS publishers stopped requiring an explicit LDS connection. Hansen also noted that some publishers cut corners on editing and &quot;do not always adhere to LDS standards&quot;. In 2006, Deseret Book stopped selling books to Seagull Book; Deseret Book&#x27;s books accounted for about half of Seagull Book&#x27;s book sales. Later that year, Deseret Book purchased Seagull Book and Covenant Communications, which greatly reduced Deseret Book&#x27;s competition.

==Genre fiction==
LDS authors&#x27; success in genre fiction is perhaps because, as Rosalynde Welch argues, &quot;Mormon culture values superior performance of shared forms over the originality of invention.&quot; She notes that the communities Mormons foster in their families and wards is duplicated in the way authors understand genre communities. Building on Welch&#x27;s work, Jana Riess argues that LDS authors are adept at conforming to genre expectations, and that the way they form and interact with their reading and writing communities contributes to their success. At &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;, Nathaniel Givens states that Mormonism&#x27;s lack of &quot;official&quot; theology or creeds leads members to a culture of &quot;amateur theology&quot;. This culture leads to theories that make good science fiction stories.

In a &quot;New York Times&quot; article, Shannon Hale theorized that LDS authors are drawn to genre fiction because they prefer happy endings to bleak or tragic stories. Hale also noted that strong writing communities for LDS authors in children&#x27;s and YA genres draw budding authors to those genres. In the same article, Rachel Nunes explained that since many LDS authors prefer not to include sexual content, they often write in the young adult genre, where avoiding sexual content is less conspicuous. In response to these arguments, Leah Libresco points out that &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; did not shy away from violent content, and also that sexual content seems like a requirement for YA novels, with tamer books being relegated to the children&#x27;s section.

===Inspirational fiction===
LDS radio host Glenn Beck co-authored &quot;The Christmas Sweater&quot;, which was a number one New York Times bestseller in 2008. Jason F. Wright co-authored &quot;The Christmas Sweater&quot; with Beck; he also wrote &quot;The Wednesday Letters&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Jars&quot;, both New York Times bestsellers.
 Richard Paul Evans&#x27;s &quot;The Christmas Box&quot; was a number one New York Times bestseller. Evans has written 30 other novels in romance, action, and fantasy genres, and each novel spent some time on the New York Times bestseller list.

===Science fiction and fantasy===
A number of LDS authors are successful science fiction and fantasy authors. Orson Scott Card was the first prominent LDS science fiction writer. He earned Hugo and Nebula Awards in 1986 and 1987 for his books &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; and&quot; Speaker for the Dead&quot;. Also in the 1980s, Tracy Hickman helped to develop the gaming fiction genre, writing adventure models connected to TSR&#x27;s Advanced Dungeons and Dragons and co-authoring Dragonlance novels with Margaret Weis. Stephenie Meyer, known for writing the &quot;Twilight&quot; series, wrote &quot;The Host&quot;, which was a New York Times bestseller for over a year. Brandon Sanderson, writer of epic fantasy, is another LDS author of &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers, including &quot;The Stormlight Archive&quot;. Sanderson has also written YA fantasy, including &quot;The Reckoners&quot; series of urban fantasy. Zenna Henderson, popular in the 1960s for her stories about &quot;The People&quot;, was raised in an LDS family. According to Terryl Givens, science fiction works by Mormons commonly explore ideas &quot;at the margins of conventional thinking&quot;, like life on other planets and apotheosis. According to Preston Hunter at adherents.com, a quarter of novels that won Hugo or Nebula awards had an LDS author or references to Latter-day Saints and Utah.

===Children&#x27;s and YA fiction===
In 2014, Utah had more nationally recognized children&#x27;s book writers and illustrators per capita than any other state. Rick Walton, a prolific author of children&#x27;s books, helped to foster a community of children&#x27;s book authors in Utah by leading critique groups and hosting a listserv for authors to meet and support each other. The invitation-only group started as a listserv in 2001, and in 2014, held monthly meetings. Walton, Carol Lynch Williams, and Cheri Earl planned the Writing and Illustrating for Young Readers annual conference starting in 2000.

LDS authors of young adult novels frequently write in fantasy or science fiction genres. Shannon Hale won the 2006 Newbery Award for her middle-grade fantasy novel &quot;Princess Academy&quot;. Brandon Mull, Aprilynne Pike, Jessica Day George, and Kiersten White are also prominent writers of middle grade and YA fantasy. James Dashner and Ally Condie have written popular dystopian YA novels. Robert Farrell Smith wrote the Leven Thumps series under the pseudonym Obert Skye.

==Associations and awards==
In 1976, the Association for Mormon Letters (AML) held its first annual symposium. The association created an e-mail forum, AML-list, in 1995, and started the blog &quot;The Dawning of a Brighter Day&quot; in 2009. The group has given annual awards since 1977. The Mormon writers group, LDStorymakers, starting from a listserv made by Rachel Nunes, has held an annual conference since 2004. Robison Wells founded the Whitney Awards in 2007 as an autonomous subsidiary of LDStorymakers. The science fiction and fantasy conference Life, the Universe, &amp; Everything, held annually in Provo, Utah, often highlights LDS authors. BYU publishes the student-run science fiction and fantasy magazine Leading Edge.

Starting in 1998, the AML began presenting an award to the best unpublished novel manuscript of the regional culture. In 2000 it changed to the &quot;Marilyn Brown Novel Award&quot;, administered by the UVU English Department. After 2011, the award was changed to a scholarship with a creative writing component.

== Controversies about LDS fiction ==
In the late 1970s, BYU Press declined to publish &quot;Nothing Very Important and Other Stories&quot; by Bela Petsco, because its content was &quot;too controversial&quot;.

While a new professor of creative writing at Brigham Young University (BYU), Brian Evenson published a short story collection, &quot;Altmann&#x27;s Tongue&quot;. A graduate student complained anonymously to church leaders that the work promoted the &quot;enjoyment&quot; of violence, while Evenson argued that his fiction accentuated violence to show its horror and &quot;thus allow it to be condemned&quot;. A senior faculty member advised Evenson not to publish similar works in the future. Evenson resigned from BYU in 1995, and left the church formally in 2000.

Deseret Book has refused to sell books from successful LDS authors because of implied adultery, premarital sex, and offensive language. In 2002, they stopped selling several books as a result of a study that showed that their customers did not want to buy books that violated &quot;their core values&quot;. They refused to sell Richard Paul Evans&#x27;s &quot;The Last Promise&quot;, which contains a scene, where, Deseret Book argued, there was an implication of adultery. In a defense of his work, Evans said that the book &quot;would be a PG-rated movie&quot;. Also in 2002, Covenant Communications, an imprint of Deseret Book, declined to publish Anita Stansfield&#x27;s &quot;The Captain of Her Heart&quot; because &quot;of its reference to premarital sex&quot;. Stansfield self-published the novel. In a column in &quot;The Provo Daily Herald&quot;, Eric Snider highlighted that Deseret Book still sold the Bible, which contains graphic sex and violence, but conceded that it depicted &quot;the woeful effects of sinning&quot; to better effect than &quot;The Last Promise&quot;, which described the protagonist leaving her abusive husband positively. In a 2003 interview with &quot;Irreantum&quot;, Jana Riess said that &quot;increased inventory conservatism&quot; was a trend with Christian publishers at the time and called it a &quot;sound marketing decision&quot; but &quot;troubling from a literary perspective&quot;. In 2009, Deseret Book stopped selling novels in the Twilight series and in 2010, Deseret Book declined to stock James Dashner&#x27;s &quot;The Scorch Trials&quot; because of offensive language.

In 2013, Cedar Fort Publishing&#x27;s imprint, Sweetwater Books, deleted gay author Michael Jensen&#x27;s reference to his partner in his cover bio. Jensen requested that his bio reference his partner, and Lyle Mortimer threatened to publish the book without giving authors credit for their work. Subsequently, Cedar Fort released the writers from their contract and did not publish the book. In response to Cedar Fort&#x27;s decision, over 40 Mormon authors signed a letter requesting that publishers make their publishing decisions based on a book&#x27;s content.

<text>Joe Boyd (born August 5, 1942) is an American record producer and writer. He formerly owned Hannibal Records. Boyd has worked on recordings of Pink Floyd, Fairport Convention, Sandy Denny, Richard Thompson, Nick Drake, The Incredible String Band, R.E.M., Vashti Bunyan, John and Beverley Martyn, Maria Muldaur, Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle, Billy Bragg, James Booker, 10,000 Maniacs, and Muzsikás. He was also one of the founders of the highly influential nightclub venue UFO.

==Life and career==
Boyd was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and raised in Princeton, New Jersey. He attended Pomfret School in Pomfret, Connecticut. He first became involved in music promoting blues artists while a student at Harvard University. After graduating, Boyd worked as a production and tour manager for music impresario George Wein, which took Boyd to Europe to organise concerts with Muddy Waters, Coleman Hawkins, Stan Getz and Sister Rosetta Tharpe. Boyd was responsible for the sound at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, when Bob Dylan played a controversial set backed by electric musicians.

In 1964 Boyd moved to London to establish the UK office of Elektra Records. In 1966, Boyd and John &quot;Hoppy&quot; Hopkins opened the UFO Club, a famous but short-lived UK Underground club in London&#x27;s Tottenham Court Road. He produced the first single &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; by UFO regulars Pink Floyd, and recordings by Soft Machine. Boyd worked extensively with audio engineer John Wood at Sound Techniques studio in Chelsea. In this studio, Boyd and Wood made a succession of celebrated albums with British folk and folk rock artists, including the Incredible String Band, Martin Carthy, Nick Drake, John Martyn, Fairport Convention and Richard Thompson. Some of these were produced by Boyd&#x27;s company Witchseason Productions.

Boyd returned to the United States at the end of 1970 to work as a music producer for Warner Bros. with special input into films, where he collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on the sound track release of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Boyd also contributed to the soundtrack of &quot;Deliverance&quot;, directed by John Boorman, where he supervised the recording of &quot;Dueling Banjos&quot;, which became a hit single for Eric Weissberg. Boyd also produced and co-directed the film documentary &quot;Jimi Hendrix&quot; (1973). In the States, Boyd produced albums by Maria Muldaur and Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle. Boyd subsequently founded the Hannibal Records label in 1980 (later absorbed into Rykodisc), which released albums by Richard Thompson and many recordings of world music, including Hungarian band Muzsikás. Boyd also produced R.E.M.&#x27;s third album &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot; (1985) and records by Billy Bragg and 10,000 Maniacs.

Boyd was executive producer for the 1989 feature film &quot;Scandal&quot;, starring John Hurt and Bridget Fonda about the Profumo affair in UK politics in 1963. Boyd left Hannibal/Ryko in 2001 and his autobiography, &quot;White Bicycles - Making Music in the 1960s&quot;, was published in 2006 by Serpent&#x27;s Tail in the UK.

In 2008, Boyd was a judge for the 7th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists.

Boyd was a producer on the long-delayed Aretha Franklin concert film &quot;Amazing Grace.&quot;

<doc id="754452" wikidata="Q885544" url="?curid=754452" title="Frank G. Allen">
<text>Frank Gilman Allen (October 6, 1874October 9, 1950) was an American businessman and politician from Massachusetts. He was president of a successful leathergoods business in Norwood, Massachusetts, and active in local and state politics. A Republican, he served two terms as the 49th lieutenant governor, and then one as the 51st governor of Massachusetts. He was a major proponent of development in Norwood, donating land and funds for a number of civic improvements.

==Early years==
Allen was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on October 6, 1874, the son of Abbie Louise (Gilman) and Frank Mitchell Allen. He was educated in local schools. Although he won admission to Harvard University, he lacked the funds to attend, and instead began working Lynn&#x27;s shoe industry. He later moved to Norwood, where he worked in the tannery of Francis O. Winslow. Allen rose to become president of the Winslow Brothers &amp; Smith Company, a position he held from 1912 to 1929, and married Winslow&#x27;s daughter Clara in 1897. Allen was for many years a business partner of George Willett, who had married another of Winslow&#x27;s daughters. The two men were major influences in the modernization of Norwood&#x27;s civic infrastructure, spearheading a number of projects, from the construction of schools to a new hospital. 

Allen maintained a summer residence on Marblehead Neck from 1923 until his death. Clara Winslow Allen, with whom Allen had a daughter, died in 1924, and he remarried in 1927, to Eleanor Hamilton Wallace.

==Political career==

Allen entered public service as a member of the Norwood Board of Assessors from 1910 to 1915 and as a Norwood town selectman from 1915 to 1922. During that period, he also served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1918 to 1919, and in the Massachusetts Senate from 1921 to 1924. In 1924, he was elected Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, having defeated the Democratic ticket of James Michael Curley and running mate James Henry Brennan with fellow Republican governor Alvan T. Fuller. Fuller and Allen served two terms, after which Allen succeeded Fuller as governor, and served until 1931.

During the administration of Governor Allen, he established the state&#x27;s Industrial Commission. He expanded facilities to care for the sick and the indigent, and in an unusual move for the times, appointed two women to judgeships in Massachusetts. He also signed the bill granting the Eastern Nazarene College the power to grant degrees in Massachusetts on March 12, 1930, after the school defended its petition before the General Court.
In 1930, Governor Allen was defeated for re-election by Democrat Joseph B. Ely, and returned to the Winslow Brothers &amp; Smith Company, where he served as chairman of the board.

==Business and Norwood civic affairs==
Allen&#x27;s post-governorship leadership of Winslow Brothers &amp; Smith was marked by declines in business, caused in part by the Great Depression. There was also conflict with workers that included three strikes, some of which included violent confrontations between strikers and police. Allen retired as board chairman in December 1949, and Winslow Brothers &amp; Smith left Norwood in 1952.

Allen and his brother-in-law George Willett were leaders in efforts to modernize Norwood&#x27;s civic affairs and infrastructure in the 1920s and 1930s. Projects shepherded by them included construction of schools, as well as the local hospital, projects for which they gave both land and funding. The pair had a good relationship until 1930, when Willett, who had suffered financial reverses and descended into paranoia, accused Allen of leading a conspiracy to frustrate a major residential development project in the town. Due to the highly public way the charge was made, Allen, then governor, was forced to make a public denial of Willett&#x27;s charges. (Willett was declared mentally incompetent in 1952.)

Allen died in 1950 at his Boston home, and is buried in Norwood&#x27;s Highland Cemetery. He was survived by his second wife, Eleanor Wallace Allen, a son, and two daughters.

<doc id="754454" wikidata="Q1401336" url="?curid=754454" title="Nikolai Tolstoy">
<text>Count Nikolai Dmitrievich Tolstoy-Miloslavsky (; born 23 June 1935), known as Nikolai Tolstoy, is a British monarchist and revisionist historian. He is a former parliamentary candidate of the UK Independence Party and is the current nominal head of the House of Tolstoy, a Russian noble family.

==Early life==
Born in England in 1935, Tolstoy is of part Russian descent. The son of Count Dimitri Tolstoy and Mary Wicksteed, he is a member of the noble Tolstoy family. He grew up as the stepson of author Patrick O&#x27;Brian, whom his mother married after his parents divorced. On his upbringing he has written:
Tolstoy holds dual British and Russian citizenship. He was educated at Wellington College, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and Trinity College Dublin.

==Literary career==
Tolstoy has written a number of books about Celtic mythology. In &quot;The Quest for Merlin&quot; he has explored the character of Merlin, and his Arthurian novel &quot;The Coming of the King&quot; builds on his research into ancient British history and Welsh mythology. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1979.

He has also researched and written about World War II and has alleged that British war crimes took place during its immediate aftermath. In 1977, he wrote the book &quot;Victims of Yalta&quot;, which exposed and criticised Britain&#x27;s role in Operation Keelhaul, a forced repatriation of anti-communist political refugees to Joseph Stalin&#x27;s NKVD in direct violation of the Geneva Conventions. In 1986 he wrote &quot;The Minister and the Massacres&quot; which similar documented and denounced the British Army&#x27;s forced repatriation of alleged collaborationists to Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Soviet-backed Yugoslav Partisans. It received much critical praise, as well as criticism by Macmillan&#x27;s authorised biographer.

==Controversy==
Tolstoy has written of the forced repatriation of Soviet citizens and others during and after World War II. As a result, he was called by the defence as an expert witness at the 1986-88 trial of John Demjanjuk in Israel. In a letter to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; (21 April 1988), Tolstoy said the trial and the court&#x27;s procedures struck &quot;at the most vital principles of natural justice&quot;. He condemned the use of especially bussed-in audiences, who were repeatedly permitted by Judge Levin to boo and hiss at appropriate moments. He called Levin&#x27;s conduct &quot;an appalling travesty of every principle of equity&quot;, and said that it was &quot;a show trial in every sense of the word&quot;, even being conducted in a theatre.

In 1989, Lord Aldington, previously a British officer (chief-of-staff to General Charles Keightley), former chairman of the Conservative Party, and then chairman of Sun Alliance insurance company, commenced a libel action over allegations of war crimes made by Tolstoy in a pamphlet distributed by Nigel Watts, a man in dispute with Sun Alliance on an insurance matter. Although Tolstoy was not the initial target of the libel action, he insisted in joining Watts as defendant because, Tolstoy later wrote, Watts was not a historian and so would have been unable to defend himself. Tolstoy lost and was ordered to pay £2 million to Lord Aldington (£1.5 million in damages and £0.5 million in costs). This sum was over three times any previous award for libel.

According to historian Bob Moore, although the repatriations did occur, Tolstoy&#x27;s intention was to minimize the culpability of the Cossacks for having sided with the Nazis, and in doing so he had undertaken manipulation of the sources and made &quot;outrageous claims&quot; that were exposed during the trial.

Tolstoy delayed payment by appealing to fifteen courts in Britain and Europe, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the size of the penalty violated his right to freedom of expression. Documents subsequently obtained from the Ministry of Defence suggested that, under Government instructions, files that could have had a bearing on the defence case might have been withdrawn from the Public Record Office and retained by the Ministry of Defence and Foreign Office throughout the run-up to the trial and the trial itself.

Tolstoy sought to appeal on the basis of new evidence which he claimed proved Aldington had perjured himself over the date of his departure from Austria in May 1945. This was ruled inadmissible at a hearing in the High Courts of Justice, from which the press and public were barred, and his application for an appeal was rejected.

In July 1995, the European Court of Human Rights decided unanimously that the British Government had violated Tolstoy&#x27;s rights in respect of Article 10 of the Convention on Human Rights. This decision referred only to the amount of the damages awarded against him and did not overturn the verdict of the libel action. &quot;The Times&quot; commented: 

Tolstoy refused to pay any libel damages while Lord Aldington was alive. It was not until 9 December 2000, two days after Aldington&#x27;s death, that Tolstoy, under court order, was forced to pay £57,000 to Aldington&#x27;s estate.

==Political activity==
A committed monarchist, Tolstoy is Chancellor of the International Monarchist League. In 1978, Tolstoy was Guest-of-Honour at the Eldon League (founded by Neil Hamilton while a student at Cambridge), and appeared to respond to the Russian Tsarist toast &quot;Autocracy, Orthodoxy and Nationalism&quot; (also a motto of the League). He was also Chairman of the London-based Russian Monarchist League, and chaired their annual dinner on 6 March 1986, when the Guest-of-Honour was the MP John Biggs-Davison. He was also in the chair for their Summer Dinner on 4 June 1987, at the Oxford and Cambridge Club in Pall Mall. 

Tolstoy was a founding committee member (January 1989) of the now established &quot;War and Peace Ball&quot;, held annually in London, which raises funds for White Russian charities. A member of the Royal Stuart Society since 1954, he is presently one of the vice-presidents.

In October 1987, he was presented with the International Freedom Award by the United States Industrial Council Educational Foundation: &quot;for his courageous search for the truth about the victims of totalitarianism and deceit.&quot; In October 1991, Tolstoy joined a Conservative Monday Club delegation, under the auspices of the club&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Committee, and travelled to observe the war between Serbia and Croatia, the first British political delegation to observe that conflict.

Conservative MPs Andrew Hunter, and Roger Knapman, then a junior minister in the Conservative government (and from 2002 to 2006 leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party), were also part of the delegation which, after going to the front lines in the Sisak region, was entertained by President Franjo Tuđman and the Croatian government in Zagreb.

On 13 October the group held a Press Conference at the Hotel Intercontinental in Zagreb, which apart from the media, was also attended by delegates from the French government. A report on the conflict was agreed and handed in to 10 Downing Street by Andrew Hunter.

Tolstoy has stood unsuccessfully for the Eurosceptic and populist United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) as a parliamentary candidate in four British general elections, having first been asked by UKIP founder Alan Sked in November 1996. Tolstoy was subsequently UKIP&#x27;s candidate for the Barnsley East by-election in 1996; where he received 2.1% of the vote, and for Wantage in the 1997 (0.8%), 2001 (1.9%) and 2005 general elections (1.5%). Tolstoy stood for UKIP in Witney at the 2010 general election – against David Cameron – and received 3.5% of the vote.

In 2024, Tolstoy accepted Patronage of the Peel Club, a private member&#x27;s group in Pall Mall, London.

==Family==

Tolstoy is the head of the senior branch of the Tolstoy family, being descended from Ivan Andreyevich Tolstoy (1644–1713). He is a distant cousin to the author Leo Tolstoy (1828–1910) as Leo Tolstoy was descended from Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy (1645–1729), the younger brother of Ivan. Tolstoy&#x27;s great-grandfather, Pavel Tolstoy-Miloslavsky, was chamberlain to the last Emperor, Nicholas II of Russia, who had declared his intention of creating him a Count for his services, but this was deferred due to the growing crisis in Russia during the First World War. When Grand Duke Kiril succeeded to the imperial inheritance and rights, he granted Pavel Tolstoy-Miloslavsky the title, an elevation which was approved by the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna and by Nicholas II&#x27;s sisters Xenia and Olga.Tolstoy&#x27;s father, Count Dimitri Tolstoy, escaped from Russia in 1920 and settled in the United Kingdom, granted British nationality in September 1946. He entered the legal profession, was called to the bar, and later appointed a Queen&#x27;s Counsel. 

Tolstoy himself is married and has four children:
* Alexandra (born 1973), a broadcaster, equine adventurer, and former socialite.
* Anastasia (born 1975), married with two children.
* Dmitri (born 1978),
* Xenia, Lady Buckhurst (born 1980) married since 2010 to the elder son and heir of the Earl De La Warr, William Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, with whom she has two children

<doc id="754455" wikidata="Q11335096" url="?curid=754455" title="Braves Field">
<text>Braves Field was a baseball park located in Boston, Massachusetts. Today the site is home to Nickerson Field on the campus of Boston University. The stadium was home of the Boston Braves of the National League from 1915 to 1952, prior to the Braves&#x27; move to Milwaukee in 1953. The stadium hosted the 1936 Major League Baseball All-Star Game and Braves home games during the 1948 World Series. The Boston Red Sox used Braves Field for their home games in the 1915 and 1916 World Series since the stadium had a larger seating capacity than Fenway Park. Braves Field was the site of Babe Ruth&#x27;s final season, playing for the Braves in 1935. From 1929 to 1932, the Boston Red Sox played select regular season games periodically at Braves Field. On May 1, 1920, Braves Field hosted the longest major league baseball game in history: 26 innings, which eventually ended in a 1–1 tie.

Braves Field was also home to multiple professional football teams between 1929 and 1948, including the first home of the National Football League (NFL) franchise that became the Washington Commanders. The pro football Braves played at the ballpark in their inaugural season of 1932, then were at Fenway Park for four seasons as the Boston Redskins before the move south in 1937 to Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C. After the stadium was purchased, Boston University leased it to the new American Football League&#x27;s Boston Patriots for the 1960–1962 seasons, before, like the Redskins, the team relocated to Fenway Park.

Located on Commonwealth Avenue at Babcock Street, the baseball field was aligned northeast, much as Fenway Park has been since it opened in April 1912. Most of the stadium was demolished in 1955, but significant portions of the original structure still stand and make up part of the Nickerson Field sports complex on the campus of Boston University.

==Professional football==
While built for baseball and having a rich baseball history, Braves Field briefly served as host for football teams. Braves Field was one of two homes (with Fenway Park) of the Boston Bulldogs of the first American Football League (in 1926) and the Boston Shamrocks of the second AFL (in 1936 and 1937). The National Football League&#x27;s Pottsville Maroons were sold and relocated to Braves Field in 1929 as the Boston Bulldogs. In 1932, Braves Field became home of the football Boston Braves, a National Football League expansion franchise, owned by George Preston Marshall. The next year, after a 4–4–2 season, the Boston Braves Football franchise moved to Fenway Park and changed its name to the Redskins. In 1937 the franchise relocated and eventually became today&#x27;s Washington Commanders. Later, the Boston Yanks played a few games at Braves Field when Fenway Park was unavailable.

==Baseball history==

Before the Braves became the first modern-era franchise to relocate, in 1952, the Boston Braves franchise had been in Boston since 1871. Before Braves Field, the franchise had played at South End Grounds, with play at Congress Street Grounds in 1894 while South End Grounds was rebuilt following the May 15, 1894 Roxbury Fire.

Shortly after the Boston Red Sox opened Fenway Park in 1912, Braves owner James Gaffney purchased the former Allston Golf Club, one mile west of Fenway Park to build a new park for the Braves. Construction of the $600,000 Braves Field began on March 20, 1915, and was completed before the end of the 1915 season. The park was constructed entirely of steel (approx 750 tons) and an estimated of concrete. Braves Field officially opened on August 18, 1915, with 46,000 in attendance to see the Braves defeat the St. Louis Cardinals 3–1. In his Opening Day coverage, J. C. O&#x27;Leary of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; described brand new Braves Field as &quot;the finest ballpark in the world. There is not another like it anywhere, and the probability is that it will stand preeminent for the next 25 years.&quot; Braves Park was the largest stadium built in that era, with 40,000 capacity and a trolley system leading to the park.

Braves Field was nicknamed &quot;The Wigwam&quot; by fans. Later it was nicknamed &quot;The Bee Hive&quot; and the name changed to National League Park, from 1936 to 1941, a period during which the owners changed the nickname of the team to the Boston Bees. The renaming of the team and stadium were both eventually dropped. During this span, it hosted the fourth Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1936. With its capacity to hold more fans than Fenway Park, Braves Field was used by the Red Sox in the 1915 and 1916 World Series; with Braves Field still under construction, the Braves had used Fenway Park for their World Series title in 1914.
Looking at design, James Gaffney wanted to see the game played in a wide open field conducive to allowing numerous inside-the-park home runs. Thus, the stadium was built in what was, at the time, the outskirts of Boston, in a large rectangular plot, contrasting with the cozy and lopsided block containing Fenway Park. The stands were almost entirely in foul territory, leaving little beyond the fence into which players could hit home runs – with the fences over away down the lines and nearly to dead center, hitting the ball over the outer fences was all but impossible during the dead-ball era. A stiff breeze coming in from center field across the Charles River further lessened any chances of seeing home runs fly out of the park. The only possible target in the outfield was a small bleacher section, which came to be known as &quot;The Jury Box&quot; after a sportswriter noticed during one slow mid-week game that there were only twelve individuals sitting in the 2,000-seat stand. Ty Cobb visited the park and commented, &quot;Nobody will ever hit a ball out of this park.&quot; The large foul ground area further favored the pitchers.

It took seven years and a livelier ball before a batter hit a home run that cleared the outer wall on the fly. New York Giants catcher Frank Snyder hit the first major league home run in the history of Braves Field in when he cleared the left field foul pole. Meanwhile, it remained a pitchers&#x27; park, perhaps never more so than on May 1, 1920, when Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Leon Cadore and Braves pitcher Joe Oeschger locked horns for a pair of complete-game performances that went on for a still-record 26 innings. After all that work, the game ended in a 1–1 tie, called on account of darkness.

At the advent of the lively ball era, it became clear that the fans were unhappy with Gaffney&#x27;s vision of how baseball should be played, and inner fences were built, and regularly moved, being moved in and out based on whims. Later, the ownership of the team even went so far as to shift the entire field in a clockwise direction (towards right field) at one point. One year after opening Braves Field, Gaffney had sold the Braves, but kept Braves Field. Gaffney and his heirs then leased the stadium out to Braves owners until 1949, when his heirs sold it back to the Braves for approx. $750,000.

On Sunday, September 21, 1952, the Brooklyn Dodgers defeated the Braves, 8–2, before 8,822 fans in the final Major League game at Braves Field. Roy Campanella hit the last home run to help Joe Black defeat a Braves team with 20 year-old rookie Eddie Mathews hitting 3rd.

==Closing and renovation==
After purchasing the Braves from Bob Quinn in 1945, owner Lou Perini, citing low attendance, moved the Braves to Milwaukee just prior to the 1953 season, leaving Braves Field vacant. The Braves had drawn fewer than 300,000 fans in 1952, after drawing over 1 million in 1947, 1948, and 1949. Milwaukee had been the home of a Braves Minor League team called the Brewers since 1902, and the Braves had earlier blocked an attempt by the St. Louis Browns to return to Milwaukee, the Browns&#x27; original home. With the Braves gone, Boston University quickly purchased Braves Field on July 30, 1953, renaming it Boston University Field and utilizing it for their student athletes, a usage that remains today. The remaining scoreboard was sold and was moved to Kansas City Municipal Stadium, where it was in use until it was demolished along with the stadium in 1976.

The old ballpark was used as-is until 1955, when Boston University began to reconfigure the stands and the grounds. By 1968, the remodel replaced all but the pavilion grandstand at the end of the right field line, which was retained as the seating core of a football, soccer, field hockey, and track-and-field stadium. The stadium was initially called &quot;Boston University Field&quot; and later renamed Nickerson Field. Along with the pavilion, the original outer wall was retained, though a portion of that wall along what is now Harry Agganis Way was replaced with wrought iron fencing in 2008. The stadium&#x27;s ticket office was converted into the Boston University police station. The rest of the stadium structure was replaced by dormitories covering the former main grandstand; and the Case Physical Education Center, which houses Walter Brown Arena and Case Gym in the vicinity of what was the left field pavilion along Babcock Street. Of the demolished Jewel Box ballparks, Braves Field has the largest proportion of visible remnants still standing, as no other former ballpark has any portion of its seating still in use.

==World Series games==
World Series games were played at Braves Field in 1915, 1916, and 1948. The Boston Red Sox played their home games in the 1915 and 1916 World Series at the new Braves Field, as its capacity at the time was larger than Fenway Park, while the Braves hosted three games of the 1948 World Series.
The Red Sox defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 4 games to 1 to win the 1915 World Series. On Monday, October 11, the Red Sox won Game 3 at Braves Field, 2–1, in front of 42,300. The next day, the Red Sox won Game 4 in front of 41,096, also 2–1. As a young pitcher on the Red Sox, Babe Ruth only appeared in the series once, as a pinch hitter, going 0–1 in Game 1.

The following year, the Red Sox played the Brooklyn Robins in the 1916 World Series. In Game 1, the Red Sox defeated Brooklyn, 6–5, at Braves Field in front of 36,117. On Monday, October 9, Boston left-hander Babe Ruth pitched against Sherry Smith in front of 47,373. Ruth and Smith dueled for 14 innings, before Ruth and the Red Sox won in the bottom of the 14th, 2–1. The Red Sox won their second consecutive World Series with a 4–1 victory in Game 5 at Braves Field, with 43,620 in attendance.
In 1948, the Boston Braves captured the National League pennant with 91 wins. The Braves then played the Cleveland Indians in the World Series, losing 4 games to 2. Two future Hall-of-Famers led their teams as Managers, Lou Boudreau of Indians and Billy Southworth leading the Braves. The 1948 Braves were led by pitchers Johnny Sain and Hall-of-Famer Warren Spahn. In Game 1, on October 6, Sain beat Bob Feller of the Indians, 1–0, at Braves Field in front of 40,135. The Indians took Game 2, 4–1, the next day at Braves Field, with Bob Lemon beating Spahn with 39,633 in attendance. Game 2 also made television history when a live broadcast of the game was shown to passengers of the B&amp;O Railroad&#x27;s train traveling between Washington, D.C., and New York City. The Braves and Indians returned to Boston for Game 6 on Monday October 11, 1948. The Indians defeated the Braves, 4–3, in front of 40,103 to capture the championship.

==1936 All-Star Game==
On July 7, 1936, the 1936 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played at Braves Field, with 25,566 in attendance. The National League defeated the American League, 4–3, in the 4th All-Star game, featuring over 20 future Major League Baseball Hall of Fame members.

Lefty Grove and Dizzy Dean were the starting pitchers for managers Joe McCarthy of the New York Yankees and Charlie Grimm of the Chicago Cubs. Lou Gehrig hit a home run for the American League, batting behind rookie Joe DiMaggio in the lineup. Among others, Luke Appling, Bill Dickey, Joe Cronin, Schoolboy Rowe, Jimmie Foxx, Rick Ferrell, Earl Averill and Charlie Gehringer were selected for the American League. The National League roster included Billy Herman, Joe Medwick, Gabby Hartnett, Arky Vaughan, Goose Goslin, Leo Durocher, Ernie Lombardi, Mel Ott and Carl Hubbell.

==Longest Major League game==

On Saturday, May 1, 1920, at Braves Field, the Braves and Brooklyn Robins played 26 complete innings in a game that ended in a 1–1 tie, called due to darkness by home plate umpire Barry McCormick. It is the longest game, by innings, in Major League history. Starting pitchers Leon Cadore (Brooklyn) and Joe Oeschger (Boston) both pitched the entire game in front of 4,500 fans. The 26 innings by both pitchers is also a record, and it is conservatively estimated that each threw at least 300 pitches. Oeschager threw 21 consecutive scoreless innings in the game, Cadore threw 20. Second baseman Charlie Pick of the Braves went 0–11, the worst single day at the plate in MLB history. Cadore faced 95 Braves hitters, while Oeschager faced 90 hitters.

Brooklyn and the Braves met again on Monday, May 3, after an off-day for the Braves. That game lasted another 19 innings, a 2–1 Boston win. In between, on Sunday, May 2, Brooklyn played at home against Philadelphia (a 4–3 Brooklyn win) in a game that went 13 innings. This gave Brooklyn 58 innings played in three days and three games.

==No-hitters==
There were four no-hitters pitched at Braves Field, none of them was a perfect game;

: Second game of a doubleheader

==3-home-run games==
There were only two three-home-run games at Braves Field:

: Bell also hit a triple.
: Tobin is the only modern era (post-1900) pitcher to hit three home runs in one game.

<text>Worcester State University (WSU) is a public university in Worcester, Massachusetts. The fourth largest of the Commonwealth’s nine Universities, WSU enrolls 4500 undergraduates and nearly 900 graduate students in more than 80 undergraduate majors and minors and 39 graduate programs. 

WSU was one of several Massachusetts State Universities that was founded as a normal school in the 19th century before evolving into a state college in the 1960s and achieving university status in 2012. WSU is administered by the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education which oversees 29 campuses including community colleges, state universities, and research universities across the Commonwealth.

==History==
Founded in 1874 as the Massachusetts State Normal School at Worcester, WSU was the fifth of nine teacher training colleges in the state. Spurred by the success of a city-run normal school founded two years earlier, its school committee successfully petitioned the Massachusetts General Court for a state-sponsored institution in Worcester. The original campus was located in a Second Empire-style stone building on St. Ann&#x27;s Hill, near the city&#x27;s downtown. By 1900, the campus included a president&#x27;s house, the &quot;Stoddard Terrace&quot; residence hall, and a turreted gymnasium annex. This site would serve WSU for nearly sixty years until the current Chandler Street campus opened in 1932.

The first &quot;principal&quot; of WSU, Elias Harlow Russell (1874–1909), shaped the school&#x27;s early curriculum. A pioneer in the Child Study Movement that emphasized childhood development and educational reform efforts, Russell partnered with colleague G. Stanley Hall, who later became President of Clark University, to develop a program that placed normal school students in city schools. Russell was later succeeded by Francis Randsom Lane (1909–1912).

In the 1920s, WSU followed national trends in teacher education by introducing a broader array of college courses and a Bachelor of Science in Education degree in 1921 culminating in a new designation of Worcester State Teachers College in 1932. The Great Depression threatened the College as the state proposed cost-cutting measures that would eliminate many schools. Presidents William B. Aspinwall (1912–1940) and Clinton E. Carpenter (1940–1946) led the college through this crisis and set the stage for post-war development under the presidency of Eugene A. Sullivan (1947–1970).

President Sullivan oversaw the expansion of the WSU curriculum. In 1952, the college introduced a Master of Science in Education, and in 1963, a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1960 the school was designated Worcester State College. Sullivan also oversaw the development of a collegiate athletic system, introducing varsity sports in 1950 and constructing a new gymnasium building in 1958. President Robert E. Leestamper (1970–1975), further expanded graduate programs and introduced professional programs such as nursing and business. In 1973, Chandler Village was created as the first residence halls on the Chandler Street campus.

The tenure of presidents Joseph J. Orze (1975–1982) and Phillip D. Vario (1982–1992) expanded the campus with the addition of a student center and a new residence hall, named Dowden Hall, as well as continued support of varsity sports and degree offerings in speech and occupational therapy. Under the tenure of President Vario, the school joined the Coalition of Urban and Metropolitan Universities. The Worcester State Foundation was created in 1994, during the presidency of Kaylan K. Ghosh (1992–2002), to support school fundraising efforts. During the following decade, the campus grew to include the new Ghosh Science and Technology Center, as well as an additional residence hall and parking structure, which was built during the tenure of President Janelle C. Ashley (2002–2011).

In 2010, WSU reorganized into two schools: the School of Humanities and Social Sciences and the School of Education, Health, and Natural Sciences. That same year, the state granted Massachusetts State Colleges university status and the college became the Worcester State University.

In 2011, Worcester State installed its eleventh president, Barry M. Maloney. That same year, students and faculty relaunched the &quot;Worcester Spy&quot;, a newspaper originally founded in 1775.

At the end of the 2020–2021 academic year, nearby Becker College closed, and transferred custody of their academic records to WSU.

==Campus==
WSU is located on Chandler Street in the Tatnuck neighborhood of Worcester. The 58-acre campus includes woods and wetlands, and features several buildings constructed on a steep, east-facing slope. 

In the late nineteenth century, the campus was the site of &quot;Willow Farm&quot;, home of William Sever Lincoln (1811–1889), who led the 34th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War and was brevetted Brigadier General in 1865. He was the son of Levi Lincoln Jr., former Governor of Massachusetts. The property was later purchased by Worcester industrialist George I. Rockwood for whom Worcester&#x27;s Rockwood Field, adjacent to WSU&#x27;s campus, is named.

In 1930, the farm was acquired for WSU&#x27;s new campus and, in 1942, an additional thirty-five acres were added, forming the campus&#x27;s current boundaries . Today, about thirty-percent of full-time students reside on campus.

<text>Alexander Ilyich Dutov (; – 7 February 1921) was a Russian Cossack ataman and lieutenant general who led the Orenburg Cossacks in a revolt against the Bolsheviks.

== Biography ==
Dutov was born in Kazalinsk in Syr-Darya Oblast (now Kazaly in Kazakhstan). He graduated from and , now Military engineering-technical university (Russian Военный инженерно-технический университет), and General Staff Academy (1908). He was assistant commander of the Cossack regiment during World War I. After the February Revolution, Dutov was appointed head of the All-Russian Cossack Army Union, then chairman of the counterrevolutionary All-Russian Cossack Congress (June 1917), and then, in September 1917, Chief of the Army Administration and ataman of the Orenburg Cossack Army.

In November 1917, Dutov raised a revolt against the Red Army authorities in Orenburg. In June 1918, Dutov, with the help of the Czech Legion, organized a struggle for complete termination of the Soviet authority in the Urals. He was in charge of the Orenburg Independent Army in Aleksandr Kolchak&#x27;s army.

In 1919, he tried to convince General Grigory Semyonov to join him as a stronger force to fight the Red Army. Semyonov refused despite a significant diplomatic effort from Governor Vasile Balabanov, claiming he was governor only since the provisional government in Saint Petersburg collapsed in the revolution.

On 9 May 1918, after Dutov captured Alexandrov Gay village, nearly 2,000 men of the Red Army were buried alive. More than 700 people from the village were executed. After capturing Troitsk, Orenburg, and other cities, a regime of terror was installed over 6,000 people, of whom 500 were killed just during interrogations. In Chelyabinsk, Dutov&#x27;s men executed or deported to Siberian prisons over 9,000 people. In Troitsk, in the first weeks after the capture of the city, Dutov&#x27;s men shot about 700 people. In Ileka they killed over 400. These mass executions were typical of Dutov&#x27;s Cossack troops. Dutov&#x27;s executive order of 4 August 1918, imposed the death penalty for evasion of military service and for even passive resistance to authorities on its territory. In one district of the Ural region in January 1918, Dutov&#x27;s men killed over 1,000 people. On 3 April 1919, the Cossack warlord ordered his troops to shoot and take hostages for the slightest display of opposition. In the village of Sugar, Dutov&#x27;s men burned down a hospital with hundreds of Red Army patients.

After his army&#x27;s defeat by Red Army, Dutov led his Orenburg Army in the Starving March during the winter of 1919–1920 to Semirechye, and from there in March–May 1920 to China. At that time, General Dutov also helped a number of Russian leaders, including Vasile Balabanov, the administrator of Semirechye, to escape to China.

Dutov was assassinated in Suiding, China, by the Bolshevik agent Мahmud Khadzhamirov (Махмуд Хаджамиров) in February 1921.

<text>Crosley Field was a Major League Baseball park in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was the home field of the National League&#x27;s Cincinnati Reds from 1912 through June 24, 1970, and the original Cincinnati Bengals football team, members of the second (1937) and third American Football League (1940–41). It was not the original home of the current NFL franchise of the same name: the home of those Bengals in 1968 and 1969 was nearby Nippert Stadium, located on the campus of the University of Cincinnati. Crosley Field was on an asymmetrical block bounded by Findlay Street (south), Western Avenue (northeast, angling), Dalton Avenue (east), York Street (north) and McLean Avenue (west) in the Queensgate section of the city. Crosley has the distinction of being the first major-league park with lights for playing night games.

The &quot;Findlay and Western&quot; intersection was the home field of the Reds from 1884 until mid-season 1970, when the team moved to Riverfront Stadium. The location of the diamond and consequently the main grandstand seating area was shifted several times during the seasons that the Reds played at the site. Three different parks stood there:

:1884–1901: [[League Park (Cincinnati)|League Park]]
:1902–1911: [[Palace of the Fans]]
:1912–1970: Redland Field, renamed Crosley Field in 1934

==History==
=== Rebuilding ===
Between the 1911 and 1912 seasons, the entire seating area of the Palace of the Fans as well as the remaining seating from the original League Park were demolished. They were replaced with the third steel-and-concrete stadium in the National League. It consisted of a double-deck grandstand around the diamond, positioned in the southwest corner of the lot. Beyond first and third base were single-deck covered pavilions extended to the corners, with bleachers in the right field area. The unusual angle of the covered areas down the lines, and behind home plate gave that area a distinctive &quot;V&quot; shape, giving rise to one of several nicknames the park had, &quot;The Old Boomerang.&quot;

Redland Field, whose name was a reference to the Reds&#x27; name and color, was built for $225,000 by Harry Hake Sr.&#x27;s architectural firm. Initially, Cincinnati fans that were not interested in the new name continued to call the facility League Park (IV), just like with the Palace of the Fans. Unlike the Palace of the Fans, the new name of the ballpark stuck around and fans got used to it. It was one of many classic steel and concrete ballparks constructed during the first ballpark boom era of 1909–1923. Chicago&#x27;s Wrigley Field and Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park were also built during this era and remain in use today. Although occupying the site since 1884, the Reds dated their ballpark from the permanent structure opened in 1912.

Throughout its history, Redland/Crosley Field was usually among the smallest parks in the major leagues. It accommodated 25,000 fans in 1912; even at its peak, it barely exceeded 30,000 seats, excluding temporary seating areas created for opening day and World Series games. Contributing to this was the fact that there were no bleachers in left or center fields; all outfield seating (about 4,500 seats), were in the semi-trapezoid-shaped right field stands that came to be known as the &quot;Sun Deck&quot; (or, in the case of night games, the &quot;Moon Deck&quot;).

Groundskeeper Mathias &quot;Matty&quot; Schwab, who had been hired in 1894, had the sod laid just in time for the Reds&#x27; first game at the new park, April 11, 1912. In the game, the Reds rallied from a 5–0 deficit to defeat the Chicago Cubs 10–6, the same team that had opened and closed at the Palace in 1902 and 1911 respectively. Schwab would be the Reds&#x27; groundkeeper until he retired at age 83 in 1963.

The Reds&#x27; on-field success continued to be sparse most of the time, but the club won the National League pennant in 1919, the franchise&#x27;s first league title in 37 years, going back to the AA inaugural season. It was also the 50th anniversary of the Cincinnati Red Stockings&#x27; historic tour, and was a celebratory occasion for Cincinnati fans, especially when they scored an upset win over the Chicago White Sox in the World Series. The win was tainted by the fact, made public a year later, that the Series had been &quot;thrown&quot; by the heavily favored Sox. The Reds gradually returned to mediocrity and attendance flagged.

===Crosley and lights===
When local businessman Powel Crosley Jr. bought the struggling Reds in 1934, team president Larry MacPhail insisted that the ballpark be renamed in honor of the man many thought had rescued the franchise. Thus, the park was renamed &quot;Crosley Field&quot;, and Crosley himself took the opportunity to advertise his Crosley cars. Under Crosley&#x27;s ownership, the park underwent notable structural renovations.

With the effects of the Great Depression in Cincinnati, the Reds convinced baseball owners to allow night baseball at Crosley Field. Without lights, Larry MacPhail insisted, the team would fold because of low attendance. Lights had been installed in a number of minor league ballparks in the early 1930s, with positive results. The major league owners acquiesced; 632 individual lamps in eight metal stanchions were erected in 1935 and the Reds hosted the Philadelphia Phillies under the lights on Friday, May 24. In attendance at the game was Ford Frick, president of the National League. In the White House, President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressed a button that lit up Crosley Field, where a crowd of 20,422 fans, sizable for a last-place team in the middle of the Great Depression, came out to watch the game. Lou Chiozza was the leadoff man for the Phillies and thus has the distinction of being the first player to bat under the lights in a night game in the majors. The Reds won the game 2–1 behind right-hander Paul Derringer.

On July 31, a large crowd showed up to see the visiting St. Louis Cardinals, the defending World Series champions, in the sixth night game at Crosley Field. As the game progressed, the throng of Reds fans forced people onto the field of play which caused mass confusion for the police and umpires. (This was during a time in baseball when overflow crowds were often allowed to sit or stand on the fringes of the playing field.) Reds manager Chuck Dressen could only follow the game via the scoreboard. At one point, he was heard to say: &quot;I see the Cardinals got a run — but I don&#x27;t know how they got it&quot;.

During a lull in the eighth inning, a local burlesque performer named Kitty Burke came out of the crowd, picked up the Reds outfielder Floyd &quot;Babe&quot; Herman&#x27;s bat, stepped into the batter&#x27;s box, and dared the Cardinals&#x27; starter, Paul &quot;Daffy&quot; Dean, to throw her a pitch. He accommodated Burke with a soft toss; Burke grounded weakly to first base. The &quot;pinch hit&quot; appearance was never recorded as an official at bat, of course, but nonetheless, Burke began promoting herself as the first woman in major league history. Allegedly, the Reds gave her a uniform.

The late 1930s finally brought some prosperity to the club again, along with some changes to the ballpark. After the 1937 season, home plate was moved toward center field, decreasing the park&#x27;s outfield dimensions while expanding foul ground. Left field was reduced from ; right field from ; and the deepest part of center field, at the corner of the Sun Deck, was reduced from .

The following summer, Crosley hosted Cincinnati&#x27;s first All-Star Game on Wednesday, July 6, 1938, won by the National League. In the middle of a pennant-winning season of 1939, their first in twenty years, the Reds added roofed upper decks to the left and right side pavilions, increasing the seating capacity by some 5,000 to give the ballpark the appearance it retained for the rest of its existence. The Reds lost the World Series to the powerful New York Yankees in a four-game sweep, but bounced back to win the pennant again in 1940, then defeated the Detroit Tigers in a seven-game thriller.

===Later years===
By the 1950s, the Reds were back to mediocrity, but they had some sluggers, including the muscle-bound Ted Kluszewski, who took full advantage of Crosley&#x27;s cozy dimensions. Crosley Field again hosted the All-Star Game in 1953.

After a poor season in 1960, the &quot;Ragamuffin Reds&quot; put everything together in 1961 and won the National League pennant, an effort documented in pitcher Jim Brosnan&#x27;s book, &quot;Pennant Race&quot;. The dream season ended for the Reds at the hand of the Yankees, whose slugging duo of Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle had demolished the rest of the American League. Maris, who had set a record with 61 home runs that season, also knocked one into the Moon Deck in the ninth inning of Game 3 of the World Series.

Crosley Field was the site of the major leagues&#x27; first save, after the save became an official statistic in 1969. Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Bill Singer earned the save on April 7, 1969, in the season opener, working three scoreless innings after taking over for Dodgers starting and winning pitcher Don Drysdale. Singer did not allow a hit, walking one batter and striking out one, as the Dodgers beat the Reds, 3–2.

The Reds would continue to be a frequent contender, gradually building up toward what would become known as the &quot;Big Red Machine&quot;. By the time the Reds reached that peak, though, Crosley would be but a memory. Crosley Field&#x27;s decline had begun in earnest in the mid-1950s with the automobile supplanting the train as the main method of transportation. The ballpark was located in the dense west end. Businesses (such as the Superior Towel and Linen Service, a.k.a. &quot;The Laundry&quot;, as well as a large factory) bounded the park on three sides. The neighborhood was not suited for the automobile; parking increasingly became a major problem in the last 15 years of Crosley Field&#x27;s existence, as did crime — especially during night games.

Around 1960, Powel Crosley was courted by a group seeking to return a National League franchise to New York City to replace the Dodgers and the Giants, who had moved to Los Angeles and San Francisco respectively after the 1957 season. The moves left the American League Yankees as the city&#x27;s sole baseball team. A move to New York was speculated in the media as early as 1957, prior to the Dodgers and Giants moving to California. Crosley was unwilling to move. However, he died the following year and his estate sold the team a few months later to Bill DeWitt, who kept Crosley&#x27;s name on the park.

Complicating matters was that legendary football coach Paul Brown, the founder of the Cleveland Browns, who had been deposed by new owner Art Modell in 1963, was wanting to get back into professional football. He was granted an American Football League franchise for Cincinnati, the Bengals. A contingency of that agreement was that an appropriate facility be ready by the time the 1970 National Football League season began, which would be the first season that the AFL was fully merged with the NFL.
An agreement was struck to build a multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city. Riverfront Stadium seated about 60,000 people and was deemed a logical solution to the myriad problems. The Reds were part of that agreement, and Crosley Field&#x27;s end was in sight.

It was believed that the Sunday, September 28, 1969 game against the Houston Astros, which was that year&#x27;s last home game for the Reds (who won 4–1), would be the final game ever at Crosley Field. However, delays in final construction of Riverfront Stadium, led to the Reds opening the 1970 season at Findlay and Western, against the Montreal Expos. New additions to the Reds that season were figures who would become Reds legends: manager George Lee &quot;Sparky&quot; Anderson and shortstop Dave Concepción, who had actually been signed by the Reds as an amateur free agent in 1967 as a pitcher. The 1970 Reds were pennant-bound, but Crosley Field did not figure into that event.

The Reds&#x27; last game at Crosley Field was played on June 24, 1970, against the San Francisco Giants. With the Reds trailing Juan Marichal and the Giants 4–3 in the eighth inning, catcher Johnny Bench tied the game on a solo home run. The next batter, first baseman Lee May won it on a solo shot of his own. The ninth inning was a relatively easy one for Reds reliever Wayne Granger; Bobby Bonds grounded out to first base. Jim McGlothlin, the starting pitcher for the Reds in their last game at Crosley Field, was also the starting pitcher for the team&#x27;s first game at Riverfront Stadium.

One of the highlights of the closing festivities was mayor Eugene P. Ruehlmann taking home plate out of the ground and taking it via helicopter (which had landed on the field), to Riverfront Stadium and installed it in the artificial turf. After a brief road trip to Houston, which saw them sweep the Houston Astros, they returned to Cincinnati and opened Riverfront Stadium against the Atlanta Braves. They lost 8–2.

Crosley was the first of three Jewel Box era National League parks to close in 1970. Forbes Field, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates since 1909, closed four days later, and the Pirates moved into Three Rivers Stadium two days after Riverfront Stadium hosted the All-Star Game. Philadelphia&#x27;s Connie Mack Stadium, which hosted the Athletics from 1909 through 1954 and Phillies since 1938, closed at the end of the season.

==The Terrace==
Crosley Field was usually among the smallest parks in Major League Baseball, both in seating capacity and playing field size.

Probably the most notable (or infamous) feature of Crosley Field otherwise was the fifteen-degree left field incline, called &quot;the terrace&quot;. Terraces were not unusual in old ballparks. Most of them were constructed as a way to make up the difference between field level and street level on a sloping block, and most of them were leveled out (&quot;Duffy&#x27;s Cliff&quot; at Fenway Park and Left Field bump at Wrigley Field are two examples).

The story of the Crosley Terrace is the reverse of the long-departed &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Cliff&quot;. There was no terrace in evidence during the ballpark&#x27;s days as the Palace, which had a fairly high wall whose base was below street level. The terrace came about when the new ballpark was constructed for 1912. The club received permission to expand the playing field, by way of the city closing the eastbound lane of York Street. Instead of building a very high wall and retaining a level playing field, the club built a somewhat shorter wall with its base at roughly street level, with the sloping terrace making up the difference in grade.

As baseball boomed during the 1920s, many clubs built additional seating in their once-spacious outfield areas. The outfield area at Findlay and Western was already small, so building inner bleachers was not practical, and the Crosley terrace persisted and became one of the park&#x27;s trademarks. It was used, as Duffy&#x27;s Cliff had been, for temporary spectator seating, in the days when standing-room-only crowds would be allowed at the fringes of the field behind ropes. The terrace also served as a warning track, in lieu of the more typical dirt or gravel warning tracks that began to appear at most other ballparks by the 1950s. The slope was at least as much warning to an outfielder as a flat track was. Although the terrace was most prominent in left field, it extended clear across the outfield.

In later years, box seats were added to the terrace in the left field corner, in foul ground, directly facing the infield as the fair-territory seating once had. At the north end of the box-seat aisle, behind the corner boxes, and visible in some photos, was a stairway up to a roll-up exit gate to York Street. Another roll-up exit gate was on the center field side of the scoreboard. The terrace was shallower there, with a shorter flight of stairs up to Western Avenue.

There was a low fence in front of the left-center stairway (and the flagpole) which led to one of the two posted ground rules. The one on the low fence read, &quot;Batted ball remaining back of barrier - 2 base hit. Bouncing out - in play.&quot; In building the new scoreboard for the 1957 season, that corner was reconfigured, eliminating the need for that short barrier and the ground rule. The other, more famous posted ground rule in the right-center field corner above the 387 sign (later 390) read, &quot;Batted ball hitting wall on fly to right of white line - home run.&quot;

The Crosley terrace was not as extreme as the terrace at Nashville&#x27;s Sulphur Dell, but it still frustrated many outfielders, mostly from visiting teams. Babe Ruth was victimized by it on May 28, 1935, playing for the Boston Braves in his final season. He was headed for the Hall of Fame, but one game as Ruth was headed up the Crosley terrace, he fell down on his face. Less dramatically, Yogi Berra had to negotiate the terrace on a Frank Robinson double in Game 3 of the 1961 World Series.
Frank Robinson, however, loved it. In the early 1990s, when the Baltimore Orioles were planning their future home, Oriole Park at Camden Yards, Robinson, an Orioles executive and one-time Reds star, unsuccessfully lobbied to get the team to install a terrace in left field.

When the Houston Astros&#x27; new facility, Enron Field, was being built, a prominent addition to the field was a 30° center field incline with a flagpole, which was dubbed &quot;Tal&#x27;s Hill&quot; in reference to its proponent, Astros executive Tal Smith. However, it was removed in 2016 and replaced with seating.

To commemorate their Crosley Field years, the main entrance of the Cincinnati Reds&#x27; new park, Great American Ball Park, features a monument called &quot;Crosley Terrace&quot; that features inclines and statues of Crosley-era stars Joe Nuxhall, Ernie Lombardi, Ted Kluszewski, and Frank Robinson. References to the terrace are also visible. This monument was designed by architecture firm Populous and sculptor Tom Tsuchiya.

==Other uses==
Through much of its history, Crosley Field was used for other events besides Cincinnati Reds baseball games. During World War I, the city&#x27;s police force staged a review at Redland Field on October 17, 1917. The Negro leagues&#x27; Cincinnati Tigers in 1936 and 1937 called Crosley home. The original 1937 Cincinnati Bengals football team played home games there.

On August 21, 1966, Crosley Field hosted The Beatles on their final tour. The concert had been scheduled for the previous day, but was rained out. On June 13, 1970, Crosley Field hosted The Cincinnati Pop Festival. The band lineup included: The Stooges, Mountain, Grand Funk Railroad, Alice Cooper, Traffic, Mighty Quick, Bob Seger, Mott The Hoople, Ten Years After, Bloodrock, Savage Grace, Brownsville Station, Zephyr, Damnation Of Adam Blessing, and John Drakes Shakedown.

Other events held there included a Roy Rogers rodeo, a political rally for Wendell Willkie, and an Ice Capades show.

==After the Reds==
After the 1970 season, the Cincinnati Reds and the city, which had agreed to buy Crosley Field, were at an impasse over how much Crosley Field was worth. The Reds wanted $3.5 million, whereas the city countered with a $1.5 million offer. Eventually the case went to court. The city contended that since Crosley Field&#x27;s playing field was extremely depressed, it would need to be filled, a costly and time-consuming job, while the Reds countered that since Interstate 75 ran by it, the site would become premium real estate, and they should be fairly compensated for the increase in value.

Eventually, a jury set the sale price at $2.5 million. After the sale was made official, the city turned the park into an auxiliary auto impound lot while the Queensgate project was Ironically, given the parking shortage for many years, Crosley had itself become a parking lot.

Two years later, the demolition of Crosley Field began in earnest: the lights were dismantled and relocated to various recreation areas in the city. The park was soon gutted; seats sold for $10 each, and fans and present and former club employees scrounged for mementos. On April 19, 1972, Pete Rose Jr. pulled a lever that sent a wrecking ball into the side of Crosley Field. By autumn, just the faint outline of the grandstand remained.

Today, seven buildings occupy the site and a street runs through it. The former site of home plate has been painted in an alley. The old left field terrace area is now a parking lot, but it is still distinguishable due to its slope and its location next to York Street. Dalton Street, which formerly dead-ended into Findlay Street, was extended through the former field of play.

===Remnants and memorials at the site===
==Replica field==
In 1974, Larry Luebbers of Union, Kentucky, built a replica of the Crosley Field playing field on his farm. To that, he added memorabilia that he had harvested during Crosley&#x27;s demolition, such as seats, signage, and the old Crosley ticket booth; painted advertising on the fences; and opened it for the Cincinnati Suds professional softball team, which he also owned. However, by 1984, it was gone, too. Luebbers was forced to sell his farm to pay off his creditors. Luebbers&#x27; son, Larry Luebbers, played for the Reds and several other clubs in the 1990s.

At about the time Larry Luebbers&#x27; Crosley re-creation failed, Marvin Thompson, then city manager Cincinnati suburb Blue Ash, came up with the idea to make one of the ballfields of a planned community sports complex a re-creation of Crosley Field. Administrative aide Mark Rohr was put in charge. He tracked down memorabilia for the park; what he couldn&#x27;t find was often donated by fans. Items such as usher&#x27;s uniforms, signage, rooftop pennants, and a field microphone were given to the new project, which opened in 1988 with an Old Timer&#x27;s game (which has been discontinued). A replica scoreboard carries information from the final game at the old park. The field also has a white wall with &quot;CROSLEY FIELD&quot; in red letters in the appropriate font. This re-creation was met with positive reviews from fans old enough to remember the real park, as well as retired Reds players such as Pete Rose, Joe Nuxhall, and Jim O&#x27;Toole. A wall features a number of plaques commemorating Crosley-era Reds greats. Additionally, 400 seats from the original field were installed at the Blue Ash replica.

Rohr, who wasn&#x27;t a baseball fan when the project began, stated: &quot;Sometimes I have a hard time understanding the people who come and stare at this place with tears in their eyes; a woman actually hugged the ticket booth and kissed it&quot;. The field is used regularly by teams in various levels of play. Moeller High School&#x27;s Varsity Baseball team plays its home games at Crosley.

==Home runs==
Crosley Field was known as a hitter-friendly park, though it was less so in its early days when the diamond was farther from the fences.
*The first over-the-fence home run struck at Redland/Crosley Field was by outfielder Pat Duncan on June 2, 1921.
*Ernie Lombardi once hit a home run that landed in a truck traveling beyond the outfield fence. The truck carried the ball for . Writers facetiously called this the &quot;longest home run&quot; in history.
*The Goat Run, additional rows of seats which decreased the right field porch from 366 feet (111.5 m) to 342 feet (104.2 m), was added specifically for slugging, sleeveless left-handed batter Ted Kluszewski, presumably to increase his home run total. However, &quot;Klu&quot; rarely hit home runs in the area and it was removed after the 1958 season. Crosley&#x27;s normal right field layout had the rare element of a foul line farther away (366) than the power alley (360); this meant that balls hit down the right-field line &quot;died&quot; in the corner, with the batter often getting a triple, due to the long distance to third base from right field.
*The scoreboard in left-center field was a major impediment to home-run hitting. At 55 ft (16.8 m) tall, and entirely in play (yellow lines appeared on walls many years later), many hits that would be home runs anywhere else became two-base hits, bouncing back to the outfielder. A sign to the right side of the clock at the very top of the scoreboard offered a free suit from a local tailor to any Reds player to hit the sign. Small consolation for a near miss on a home run.
*On June 10, 1967, Houston outfielder Jimmy Wynn hit a home run to center, onto future I-75. This shot has been portrayed in many films and television shows.

==Flood==
In 1937, the Mill Creek flooded, submerging the field under of water. As a lark, Reds pitcher Lee Grissom and the team&#x27;s traveling secretary, John McDonald, got into a rowboat and entered Crosley Field over the left field fence and rowed to the area of the pitcher&#x27;s mound. There was a photographer present, of course, and the picture has been well-circulated since then. For example, it can be seen on p. 40–41 of &quot;Lost Ballparks&quot;, by Lawrence Ritter.

==Neighbors==
Across the left field wall on York Street, a sign on the Superior Towel and Linen Service plant advertised a downtown clothier, Seibler Suits, which rewarded any player hitting the sign with a suit. Wally Post, who won 11, led the Reds in this unofficial statistical category; Willie Mays led all visitors with seven. Its demolition in the early-1960s netted 38 parking spaces.

<text>In electromagnetism, permeability is the measure of magnetization produced in a material in response to an applied magnetic field. Permeability is typically represented by the (italicized) Greek letter &quot;μ&quot;. It is the ratio of the magnetic induction formula_1 to the magnetizing field formula_2 in a material. The term was coined by William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin in 1872, and used alongside permittivity by Oliver Heaviside in 1885. The reciprocal of permeability is magnetic reluctivity.

In SI units, permeability is measured in henries per meter (H/m), or equivalently in newtons per ampere squared (N/A2). The permeability constant &quot;μ&quot;0, also known as the magnetic constant or the permeability of free space, is the proportionality between magnetic induction and magnetizing force when forming a magnetic field in a classical vacuum.

A closely related property of materials is magnetic susceptibility, which is a dimensionless proportionality factor that indicates the degree of magnetization of a material in response to an applied magnetic field.

== Explanation ==
In the macroscopic formulation of electromagnetism, there appear two different kinds of magnetic field:
* the magnetizing field H which is generated around electric currents and displacement currents, and also emanates from the poles of magnets. The SI units of H are amperes per meter.
* the magnetic flux density B which acts back on the electrical domain, by curving the motion of charges and causing electromagnetic induction. The SI units of B are volt-seconds per square meter, a ratio equivalent to one tesla.

The concept of permeability arises since in many materials (and in vacuum), there is a simple relationship between H and B at any location or time, in that the two fields are precisely proportional to each other:
: formula_3
where the proportionality factor &quot;μ&quot; is the permeability, which depends on the material. The permeability of vacuum (also known as permeability of free space) is a physical constant, denoted &quot;μ&quot;0. The SI units of &quot;μ&quot; are volt-seconds per ampere-meter, equivalently henry per meter. Typically &quot;μ&quot; would be a scalar, but for an anisotropic material, &quot;μ&quot; could be a second rank tensor.

However, inside strong magnetic materials (such as iron, or permanent magnets), there is typically no simple relationship between H and B. The concept of permeability is then nonsensical or at least only applicable to special cases such as unsaturated magnetic cores. Not only do these materials have nonlinear magnetic behaviour, but often there is significant magnetic hysteresis, so there is not even a single-valued functional relationship between B and H. However, considering starting at a given value of B and H and slightly changing the fields, it is still possible to define an &quot;incremental permeability&quot; as:
: formula_4
assuming B and H are parallel.

In the microscopic formulation of electromagnetism, where there is no concept of an H field, the vacuum permeability &quot;μ&quot;0 appears directly (in the SI Maxwell&#x27;s equations) as a factor that relates total electric currents and time-varying electric fields to the B field they generate. In order to represent the magnetic response of a linear material with permeability &quot;μ&quot;, this instead appears as a magnetization M that arises in response to the B field: formula_5. The magnetization in turn is a contribution to the total electric current—the magnetization current.

== Relative permeability and magnetic susceptibility ==
Relative permeability, denoted by the symbol formula_6, is the ratio of the permeability of a specific medium to the permeability of free space &quot;μ&quot;0:
: formula_7
where formula_8 4 × 10−7 H/m is the magnetic permeability of free space. In terms of relative permeability, the magnetic susceptibility is
: formula_9

The number &quot;χ&quot;m is a dimensionless quantity, sometimes called &quot;volumetric&quot; or &quot;bulk&quot; susceptibility, to distinguish it from &quot;χ&quot;p (&quot;magnetic mass&quot; or &quot;specific&quot; susceptibility) and &quot;χ&quot;M (&quot;molar&quot; or &quot;molar mass&quot; susceptibility).

== Diamagnetism ==

&quot;Diamagnetism&quot; is the property of an object which causes it to create a magnetic field in opposition of an externally applied magnetic field, thus causing a repulsive effect. Specifically, an external magnetic field alters the orbital velocity of electrons around their atom&#x27;s nuclei, thus changing the magnetic dipole moment in the direction opposing the external field. Diamagnets are materials with a magnetic permeability less than &quot;μ&quot;0 (a relative permeability less than 1).

Consequently, diamagnetism is a form of magnetism that a substance exhibits only in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. It is generally a quite weak effect in most materials, although superconductors exhibit a strong effect.

== Paramagnetism ==

&quot;Paramagnetism&quot; is a form of magnetism which occurs only in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. Paramagnetic materials are attracted to magnetic fields, hence have a relative magnetic permeability greater than one (or, equivalently, a positive magnetic susceptibility).

The magnetic moment induced by the applied field is &quot;linear&quot; in the field strength, and it is rather &quot;weak&quot;. It typically requires a sensitive analytical balance to detect the effect. Unlike ferromagnets, paramagnets do not retain any magnetization in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field, because thermal motion causes the spins to become &quot;randomly oriented&quot; without it. Thus the total magnetization will drop to zero when the applied field is removed. Even in the presence of the field, there is only a small &quot;induced&quot; magnetization because only a small fraction of the spins will be oriented by the field. This fraction is proportional to the field strength and this explains the linear dependency. The attraction experienced by ferromagnets is non-linear and much stronger so that it is easily observed, for instance, in magnets on one&#x27;s refrigerator.

== Gyromagnetism ==
For gyromagnetic media (see Faraday rotation) the magnetic permeability response to an alternating electromagnetic field in the microwave frequency domain is treated as a non-diagonal tensor expressed by:
: formula_10

== Values for some common materials ==
The following table should be used with caution as the permeability of ferromagnetic materials varies greatly with field strength and specific composition and fabrication. For example, 4% electrical steel has an initial relative permeability (at or near 0 T) of 2,000 and a maximum of 38,000 at T = 1 and different range of values at different percent of Si and manufacturing process, and, indeed, the relative permeability of any material at a sufficiently high field strength trends toward 1 (at magnetic saturation).


A good magnetic core material must have high permeability.

For &quot;passive&quot; magnetic levitation a relative permeability below 1 is needed (corresponding to a negative susceptibility).

Permeability varies with a magnetic field. Values shown above are approximate and valid only at the magnetic fields shown. They are given for a zero frequency; in practice, the permeability is generally a function of the frequency. When the frequency is considered, the permeability can be complex, corresponding to the in-phase and out of phase response.

== Complex permeability ==
A useful tool for dealing with high frequency magnetic effects is the complex permeability. While at low frequencies in a linear material the magnetic field and the auxiliary magnetic field are simply proportional to each other through some scalar permeability, at high frequencies these quantities will react to each other with some lag time. These fields can be written as phasors, such that
: formula_11
where formula_12 is the phase delay of formula_1 from formula_2.

Understanding permeability as the ratio of the magnetic flux density to the magnetic field, the ratio of the phasors can be written and simplified as
: formula_15
so that the permeability becomes a complex number.

By Euler&#x27;s formula, the complex permeability can be translated from polar to rectangular form,
: formula_16

The ratio of the imaginary to the real part of the complex permeability is called the loss tangent,
: formula_17
which provides a measure of how much power is lost in material versus how much is stored.

<doc id="754488" wikidata="Q256699" url="?curid=754488" title="Permeability (porous media)">
<text>In fluid mechanics, materials science and Earth sciences, the permeability of porous media (often, a rock or soil) is a measure of the ability for fluids (gas or liquid) to flow through the media; it is commonly symbolized as &quot;k&quot;.
Fluids can more easily flow through a material with high permeability than one with low permeability. 

The permeability of a medium is related to the &quot;porosity&quot;, but also to the shapes of the pores in the medium and their level of connectedness. 
Fluid flows can also be influenced in different lithological settings by brittle deformation of rocks in fault zones; the mechanisms by which this occurs are the subject of fault zone hydrogeology. Permeability is also affected by the pressure inside a material.

The SI unit for permeability is the square metre (m2). A practical unit for permeability is the &quot;darcy&quot; (d), or more commonly the &quot;millidarcy&quot; (md) The name honors the French Engineer Henry Darcy who first described the flow of water through sand filters for potable water supply. Permeability values for most materials commonly range typically from a fraction to several thousand millidarcys. The unit of square centimetre (cm2) is also sometimes used 

== Applications ==
The concept of permeability is of importance in determining the flow characteristics of hydrocarbons in oil and gas reservoirs, and of groundwater in aquifers.

For a rock to be considered as an exploitable hydrocarbon reservoir without stimulation, its permeability must be greater than approximately 100 md (depending on the nature of the hydrocarbon – gas reservoirs with lower permeabilities are still exploitable because of the lower viscosity of gas in comparison with oil). Rocks with permeabilities significantly lower than 100 md can form efficient &quot;seals&quot; (see petroleum geology). Unconsolidated sands may have permeabilities of over 5000 md.

The concept also has many practical applications outside of geology, for example in chemical engineering (e.g., filtration), as well as in Civil Engineering when determining whether the ground conditions of a site are suitable for construction.

== Description ==
Permeability is part of the proportionality constant in Darcy&#x27;s law which relates discharge (flow rate) and fluid physical properties (e.g. dynamic viscosity), to a pressure gradient applied to the porous media:

:formula_1 (for linear flow)

Therefore:
: formula_2

where:
:formula_3 is the fluid velocity through the porous medium (i.e., the average flow velocity calculated as if the fluid was the only phase present in the porous medium) (m/s)
:formula_4 is the permeability of a medium (m2)
:formula_5 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa·s)
:formula_6 is the applied pressure difference (Pa)
:formula_7 is the thickness of the bed of the porous medium (m)

In naturally occurring materials, the permeability values range over many orders of magnitude (see table below for an example of this range).

=== Relation to hydraulic conductivity ===
The global proportionality constant for the flow of water through a porous medium is called the hydraulic conductivity (, unit: m/s). Permeability, or intrinsic permeability, (, unit: m2) is a part of this, and is a specific property characteristic of the solid skeleton and the microstructure of the porous medium itself, independently of the nature and properties of the fluid flowing through the pores of the medium. This allows to take into account the effect of temperature on the viscosity of the fluid flowing though the porous medium and to address other fluids than pure water, &quot;e.g.&quot;, concentrated brines, petroleum, or organic solvents. Given the value of hydraulic conductivity for a studied system, the permeability can be calculated as follows:

:formula_8

:where
* formula_4 is the permeability, m2
* formula_10 is the hydraulic conductivity, m/s
* formula_5 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, Pa·s
* formula_12 is the density of the fluid, kg/m3
* formula_13 is the acceleration due to gravity, m/s2.

=== Anisotropic permeability ===
Tissue such as brain, liver, muscle, etc can be treated as a heterogeneous porous medium. Describing the flow of biofluids (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, etc.) within such a medium requires a full 3-dimensional anisotropic treatment of the tissue. In this case the scalar hydraulic permeability is replaced with the hydraulic permeability tensor so that Darcy&#x27;s Law reads

:formula_14

* formula_15 is the Darcy flux, or filtration velocity, which describes the bulk (not microscopic) velocity field of the fluid, formula_16 
* formula_5 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, formula_18
* formula_19 is the hydraulic permeability tensor, formula_20
* formula_21 is the gradient operator, formula_22
* formula_23 is the pressure field in the fluid, formula_24

Connecting this expression to the isotropic case, formula_25, where k is the scalar hydraulic permeability, and 1 is the identity tensor.

== Determination ==
Permeability is typically determined in the lab by application of Darcy&#x27;s law under steady state conditions or, more generally, by application of various solutions to the diffusion equation for unsteady flow conditions.

Permeability needs to be measured, either directly (using Darcy&#x27;s law), or through estimation using empirically derived formulas. However, for some simple models of porous media, permeability can be calculated (e.g., random close packing of identical spheres).

===Permeability model based on conduit flow===
Based on the Hagen–Poiseuille equation for viscous flow in a pipe, permeability can be expressed as:
:formula_26
where:
:formula_27 is the intrinsic permeability [length2]
:formula_28 is a dimensionless constant that is related to the configuration of the flow-paths
:formula_29 is the average, or effective pore diameter [length].

==Absolute permeability (aka intrinsic or specific permeability)==
&quot;Absolute permeability&quot; denotes the permeability in a porous medium that is 100% saturated with a single-phase fluid. This may also be called the &quot;intrinsic permeability&quot; or &quot;specific permeability.&quot; These terms refer to the quality that the permeability value in question is an intensive property of the medium, not a spatial average of a heterogeneous block of material ; and that it is a function of the material structure only (and not of the fluid). They explicitly distinguish the value from that of relative permeability.

==Permeability to gases==
Sometimes, permeability to gases can be somewhat different than that for liquids in the same media. One difference is attributable to the &quot;slippage&quot; of gas at the interface with the solid when the gas mean free path is comparable to the pore size (about 0.01 to 0.1 μm at standard temperature and pressure). See also Knudsen diffusion and constrictivity. For example, measurement of permeability through sandstones and shales yielded values from 9.0×10−19 m2 to 2.4×10−12 m2 for water and between 1.7×10−17 m2 to 2.6×10−12 m2 for nitrogen gas. Gas permeability of reservoir rock and source rock is important in petroleum engineering, when considering the optimal extraction of gas from unconventional sources such as shale gas, tight gas, or coalbed methane.

== Permeability tensor ==
To model permeability in anisotropic media, a permeability tensor is needed. Pressure can be applied in three directions, and for each direction, permeability can be measured (via Darcy&#x27;s law in 3D) in three directions, thus leading to a 3 by 3 tensor. The tensor is realised using a 3 by 3 matrix being both symmetric and positive definite (SPD matrix):
* The tensor is symmetric by the Onsager reciprocal relations
* The tensor is positive definite because the energy being expended (the inner product of fluid flow and negative pressure gradient) is always positive

The permeability tensor is always diagonalizable (being both symmetric and positive definite). The eigenvectors will yield the principal directions of flow where flow is parallel to the pressure gradient, and the eigenvalues represent the principal permeabilities.

==Ranges of common intrinsic permeabilities==
These values do not depend on the fluid properties; see the table derived from the same source for values of hydraulic conductivity, which are specific to the material through which the fluid is flowing.

<text>Montreal (; ), or Qal&#x27;at ash-Shawbak () in Arabic, is a castle built by the Crusaders and expanded by the Mamluks, on the eastern side of the Arabah Valley, perched on the side of a rocky, conical mountain, looking out over fruit orchards below. The ruins are located next to the modern town of Shoubak in Jordan.

==Name==
The Crusaders, who wrote their chronicles in Medieval Latin, Old French and Occitan, mentioned the castle as Castrum Saboach or Scobach, or as Mons Regalis, Mont Real, and Monreal. The second set of variants translate to &#x27;Royal Castle&#x27; or &#x27;King&#x27;s Castle&#x27;.

The Arabic name is spelled variously as Shobak, Shawbak, Shaubak, Shubek, etc. The word castle or fortress translates in Arabic to &quot;qal&#x27;a&quot;.

==Excavation history==
As of 1994, the castle had never yet been fully excavated, but as of 2006 it was being investigated by an Italian archaeological team from the University of Florence.

==History==
The castle was built in 1115 by Baldwin I of Jerusalem during his expedition to the area when he captured Aqaba on the Red Sea in 1116. Originally called &#x27;Krak de Montreal&#x27; or &#x27;Mons Regalis&#x27;, it was named in honor of the king&#x27;s own contribution to its construction (Mont Royal). The castle is located on a round hilltop site that is separated from the rest of the plateau of Edom, which along with the Moab formed the core of Oultrejourdain. Despite appearance, the Edom plain was a relatively fertile location, which made the site, along with its strategic importance, highly desirable. The castle was strategically important due to the fact that it also dominated the main passage from Egypt to Syria. This allowed whoever held the castle to tax not only traders, but also those who were on pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina. One of the major disadvantages of the site was the lack of a reliable source of water, an issue that the Crusaders encountered all over the Middle East. This problem was solved by the construction of a tunnel down the hill to two spring-fed cisterns. The tunnel allowed defenders to go and retrieve water without exposing themselves to any attackers.

It remained property of the royal family of the Kingdom of Jerusalem until 1142, when it became part of the Lordship of Oultrejordain. At the same time the center of the Lordship was moved to Kerak, a stronger fortress to the north of Montreal. Along with Kerak, the castle owed sixty knights to the kingdom. The first Lord of Oultrejordain was Philip of Nablus. It was held by Philip de Milly, and then passed to Raynald of Châtillon when he married Stephanie de Milly. Raynald used the castle to attack the rich caravans that had previously been allowed to pass unharmed. He also built ships there, then transported them overland to the Red Sea, planning to attack Mecca itself. This was intolerable to the Ayyubid sultan Saladin (Salah al-Din), who invaded the kingdom in 1187. After capturing Jerusalem, later in the year he besieged Montreal. During the siege the defenders are said to have sold their wives and children for food, and to have gone blind from &quot;lack of salt.&quot; Because of the hill Saladin was unable to use siege engines, but after almost two years the castle finally fell to his troops in May 1189, after which the defenders&#x27; families were returned to them. After its capture, Saladin awarded it to his brother, al-&#x27;Adil, who held it until after his brother&#x27;s death in 1193. During negotiations between the Crusaders and the Ayyubids in 1218-19, the Ayyubids unwillingness to hand back over the ownership of Montreal and Kerak was a major reason the negotiations broke down. In 1261, the Mamluk Sultan Baybars, stormed the castle bringing it under the control of Egypt.

==Structure==
Little remains of the original Crusader fortifications. Although it has never been fully excavated, it is known that there was a set of three walls, which partially remain. The most significant remains of the Crusader portions of the Crusader castle is the remains of a curtain wall that ran inside the later Muslim additions and two chapels. The towers and walls are decorated with carved inscriptions dating from 14th century Mameluke renovations, but the inside is in ruins. The pilgrim Thietmar, who saw the castle in 1217 after the Muslim conquest, referred to it as &quot;a most excellent fortress, surrounded by triple walls and as strong as any I have ever seen&quot;. The external walls and towers are attributed to the patronage of the Mamluk sultan Lajin.

<doc id="754503" wikidata="Q17100234" url="?curid=754503" title="Democratic Programme">
<text>The Democratic Programme was a declaration of economic and social principles adopted by the First Dáil at its first meeting on 21 January 1919. A text of the programme was first adopted in Irish and then in English. Its official Irish title was Clár Oibre Poblacánaighe.

On the national issue, the Sinn Féin Manifesto for the 1918 election had stressed the long history of Irish resistance to British rule &quot;based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression...&quot; The party was committed to use &quot;any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.&quot; The stance was not inclusive of those who supported or tolerated the link with Britain, and &#x27;alien aggression&#x27; became synonymous with occupation of the island of Ireland, whether by the British forces or by the descendants of the British settlers from earlier centuries. 

On the social front, the Manifesto linked the nationalist aim of freedom with the opportunity for equality, &quot;reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.&quot;

On winning 73 seats, the Dáil voted at its first session for the Democratic Programme, as embodying these ideals and also the Declaration of Independence.

The Democratic Program was drafted with the assistance of Thomas Johnson, the leader of the Labour Party, in return for Labour Party not campaigning in the 1918 election and continuing moral support.

==The Programme&#x27;s Vision==
The Programme was published and approved by the First Dáil on the same day as the declaration of the Irish Republic, and by chance the same day as the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence . The programme outlined a socialist policy which included: the public ownership of the means of production, natural resources and &quot;wealth&quot;; state provision of education for children and care for the elderly; ensuring that children receive food; promotion of industrial development as well as the exploitation of natural resources. The Labour Party inserted a clause that private property was to be subordinate &quot;to the public right and welfare.&quot; 

The First Dáil subsequently issued &quot;decrees&quot; on many matters, but none of these were based on the Programme. There was no money to put the plans into effect. The war launched by Sinn Féin led to &quot;British sanctions in the form of withdrawal of grants... inhibiting financial autonomy. The Minister for Finance, Michael Collins, found it impossible to introduce a system of income tax and the Dáil itself never advocated that the Irish should stop paying tax or indeed land annuities to the British.&quot; Of amounts raised abroad, by far the greatest share went to &quot;world propaganda&quot;, and not towards social issues, according to the May 1921 Dáil statement.

==The debate on its practicality==
Brian Farrell felt that the Democratic Programme &quot;did not represent the social and economic ideals of the first Dáil. Most of its members had not read the document in advance; the few who had seen it in draft form were reluctant enough to subscribe to it and there was a last minute redrafting ... only hours before the Dáil met.&quot;

<doc id="754540" wikidata="Q512294" url="?curid=754540" title="Gerald Posner">
<text>Gerald Leo Posner is an American investigative journalist and author of thirteen books, including &quot;Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK&quot; (1993), which explores the John F. Kennedy assassination, and &quot;Killing the Dream: James Earl Ray and the Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.&quot; (1998), about the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. A plagiarism scandal involving articles that Posner wrote for &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; and his book &quot;Miami Babylon&quot; arose in 2010.

== Early life and education ==
Posner was born in San Francisco, California, the only child of Jerry and Gloria Posner. His father was Jewish and his mother Catholic, and both were native San Franciscans. His father was a labor union official.

Posner was raised Catholic. He was educated at St. Ignatius College Preparatory and graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Berkeley in 1975. In 1978, he earned his J.D. from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, where he served as the associate executive editor for the university&#x27;s &quot;Law Review&quot;.

At age 23, he joined the law firm, Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore, as one of the youngest attorneys ever hired by the firm. In 1980, he went into private practice with a partner. In 1981, he represented Deborah Ann Fountain, Miss New York State, against the Miss America pageant after Fountain was disqualified for padding her bra. He left the law in 1986, when his first book, about Nazi Josef Mengele&#x27;s life on the run, was published by McGraw Hill.

== Journalism career ==

=== &quot;Mengele: The Complete Story&quot; ===
Posner&#x27;s first book, co-written with British journalist John Ware, was the 1986 biography &quot;Mengele: The Complete Story&quot;. The book was the result of a five-year &quot;pro bono&quot; lawsuit that Posner brought on behalf of survivors of Josef Mengele&#x27;s medical experiments at Auschwitz. Posner and Ware obtained exclusive access to 5,000 pages of Mengele&#x27;s diaries and personal papers for their book. The book was critically recognized as the &quot;definitive&quot; biography of Mengele.

Posner testified before the United States Senate in 1986 about how Mengele used an International Red Cross passport to travel safely from Europe to Argentina in 1949. He also testified about the discovery made by himself and Ware that Mengele had twice been captured by U.S. Army troops in 1945, but released both times before authorities realized he was on several wanted lists.

In June 1986, Posner appeared with Mengele&#x27;s only son, Rolf Mengele, on the &quot;Phil Donahue Show&quot;. Syndicated columnist, Lewis Grizzard, called the hour-long live program &quot;an incredibly compelling piece of television journalism.&quot;

Some of the content in &quot;Mengele: The Complete Story&quot; was utilized by the United States Department of Justice&#x27;s Office of Special Investigations (OSI), which in, February 1985, began an in-depth investigation into Mengele&#x27;s post-war activities and whereabouts. The investigation, done in conjunction with the United States Marshals Service, was launched after allegations that Mengele was at any time in the custody of or had any relationship with U.S. government institutions or personnel after World War II. In its official report to the Attorney General of the United States in 1992, &quot;In the Matter of Josef Mengele&quot;, OSI noted it was indebted to Posner for obtaining a witness statement concerning Mengele&#x27;s whereabouts from October 1945 to August 1, 1948.

=== &quot;Warlords of Crime&quot; ===
In 1988, Posner published &quot;Warlords of Crime: Chinese Secret Societies: The New Mafia&quot;, an exposé of Triads and international heroin syndicates. Posner, and his wife, Trisha, traveled to Hong Kong, the Golden Triangle, the Netherlands, San Francisco, London and New York to conduct in-person research with drug traffickers. Clarence Petersen, reviewing the book for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, commented, &quot;Posner ... is persuasive for the facts he gathered, all the more so because his narrative is largely the story of how he got the story, what he was told by the criminals and by law enforcement agents here and abroad and, most persuasive of all, what he saw with his own eyes. He does not dramatize; he doesn&#x27;t have to. The chilling story he unearthed speaks for itself.&quot; Former New York detective and best-selling novelist, Dorothy Uhnak, wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;&quot;Warlords of Crime&quot; is powerful, frightening and, unfortunately, nonfiction.&quot;

Touchstone Pictures purchased the film rights to &quot;Warlords of Crime&quot;.

=== &quot;The Bio-Assassins&quot; ===
Posner&#x27;s only novel is a biological warfare thriller set in the Cold War. According to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;Posner&#x27;s first novel, a thriller whose development depends heavily on the author&#x27;s convincing descriptions of the technology in intelligence work. The narrative works within the current conventions of its genre: principle is a mask for expedience; cynicism displaces conviction; proficiency implies virtue. But Posner, author of nonfiction works on Josef Mengele and Chinese secret societies, handles his material well. His descriptions move smartly; his characters, while somewhat two-dimensional, are convincing in their context; and his plot is constructed to satisfy demanding readers.&quot;

=== &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Children&quot; ===
Posner&#x27;s 1991 book, &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Children: Sons and Daughters of Leaders of the Third Reich Talk About Themselves and Their Fathers&quot;, included in-depth interviews with a dozen children of top Nazi officials. The book was also well received. Karen Stabiner wrote in her review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;This is a mesmerizing, blood-chilling book, a set of oral histories of the sons and daughters of 11 of Hitler&#x27;s top men. It is barely possible to read more than a few pages at a time; the contrast between innocent childhood experience, and the awful understanding of that experience that came with time, is enough to make you weep.&quot;

Christopher Lehmann-Haupt in &quot;The New York Times&quot; questioned whether Posner&#x27;s book length treatment was necessary to study the children of Nazi perpetrators. &quot;Perhaps it would have been more enlightening had Mr. Posner studied fewer cases more intensely, or even a single case from the most intimate point of view.&quot;

=== &quot;Case Closed&quot; ===
In his 1993 book &quot;Case Closed&quot;, Posner contended that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of John F. Kennedy and Oswald&#x27;s murderer, Jack Ruby, acted independently as well. &quot;Case Closed&quot; was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller and a finalist for the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for History. It was also the subject of a double issue of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, and featured on programs such as ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot;, CBS &quot;Special Reports&quot;, and PBS&#x27;s &quot;Frontline&quot;. The book was optioned for a television miniseries by David L. Wolper, the producer of the miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;. In his 2003 autobiography, &quot;Producer: A Memoir&quot;, Wolper cited his failure to get movies made of &quot;Case Closed&quot; and the Cuban Missile Crisis book, &quot;One Hell of a Gamble: Khrushchev, Castro, and Kennedy&quot;, as his two major career disappointments.

In 1993, Posner testified before the Legislation and National Security Subcommittee of the United States House Committee on Government Operations about the findings in &quot;Case Closed&quot;. In 1998, the Assassination Records Review Board briefly referenced this testimony in discussing two unsuccessful attempts to acquire the interview notes of two physicians, James Humes and J. Thornton Boswell, that Posner said he possessed.

&quot;Case Closed&quot; generally drew critical acclaim from the media; the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;Newsday&quot; all cited Posner&#x27;s &quot;meticulous&quot; research in their respective reviews.

In his review for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Jeffrey Toobin wrote, &quot;Unlike many of the 2,000 other books that have been written about the Kennedy assassination, Posner&#x27;s &quot;Case Closed&quot; is a resolutely sane piece of work. More importantly, &quot;Case Closed&quot; is utterly convincing in its thesis, which seems, in light of all that has transpired over the past 30 years, almost revolutionary. His thesis is this: Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy by himself. ... I started &quot;Case Closed&quot; as a skeptic—and slightly put off by the presumptuous title. To my mind historical truth is always a slippery thing. The chances of knowing for sure what happened in any event—much less one as murky as the Kennedy assassination—seem remote. But this fascinating and important book won me over. Case closed, indeed.&quot;

&quot;Case Closed&quot; also drew widespread criticism from academics involved in assassination research as well as from non-academic assassination researchers who contended that it contained factual inaccuracies. For example, historian David Wrone wrote that &quot;massive numbers of factual errors suffuse the book&quot;. Vincent Bugliosi, whose own book &quot;Reclaiming History&quot; largely agrees with Posner&#x27;s conclusions, accused Posner of &quot;omissions and distortions&quot; but also described &quot;Case Closed&quot; as &quot;an impressive work&quot;. &quot;He is perhaps public enemy No. 1 to members of what might be called the JFK conspiracy industry,&quot; wrote journalist Paul Galloway.

Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the assassination in 2013, Gallup released a national poll showing that while a majority (61%) of Americans still believed a conspiracy was behind JFK&#x27;s death, the number of those who thought it was a lone assassin (30%) was the highest in 46 years. Although some mainstream media commentators such as &quot;The Independent&quot; said that &quot;for Americans, JFK will never be case closed&quot;, others like &quot;The Economist&quot; cited &quot;Case Closed&quot; and concluded, &quot;50 years on, face it, Oswald did it.&quot; 

Historian Robert Dallek called &quot;Case Closed&quot; &quot;authoritative,&quot; and said: &quot;the best book on this subject is by a man named Gerald Posner, called &#x27;Case Closed&#x27;, I think he has responded very effectively to all the conspiracy theories, and there are so many of them.&quot; Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist, Hector Tobar wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that &quot;Case Closed&quot; was &quot;the book that cured me of JFK conspiracies once and for all.&quot;

&quot;Case Closed&quot; continued to generate widely divergent views. Film director Oliver Stone told a JFK assassination conference in Pittsburgh that &quot;Case Closed&quot; was discredited and &quot;there&#x27;s nothing in the movie (&quot;JFK&quot;) that I would go back on.&quot; Posner, on the day of the 50th anniversary, told CNN&#x27;s Anderson Cooper that &quot;the only thing he [Stone] gets right in &#x27;JFK&#x27; is the date on which Kennedy is killed.&quot;

=== &quot;Killing the Dream&quot; ===
As controversial and talked-about as &quot;Case Closed&quot; was Posner&#x27;s 1998 &quot;Killing the Dream: James Earl Ray and the Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.&quot; (Random House). The book concluded that confessed assassin, James Earl Ray, killed Martin Luther King Jr. acting alone, likely for the hope of collecting a racist bounty for the murder. Among other portions of his book, Posner tracked down for the first time the mysterious &quot;Raoul&quot;, fingered by James Earl Ray as the mastermind of a conspiracy to kill King and to frame Ray. After setting out to settle Ray&#x27;s Raoul story, Posner challenged as a hoax the widely printed conspiracy story that Green Beret snipers from the 20th Special Forces Group were in Memphis on the day of the assassination.

&quot;Killing the Dream&quot; was the largest private reinvestigation of the King assassination in 30 years. As was &quot;Case Closed&quot;, &quot;Killing the Dream&quot; was widely praised and embraced by the mainstream press, and among the national broadcasts that featured the book included CBS&#x27; &quot;48 Hours&quot;, &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; and &quot;TODAY&quot;. Richard Bernstein in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the book was &quot;the most comprehensive and definitive study of the King assassination to date. ... He [Posner] has rendered a valuable service by putting the King murder under his magnifying glass. One finishes this book reassured that no dark secrets remain, that no unexplained details need bedevil the national composure.&quot; Two-time Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist and columnist, Anthony Lewis, in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, said: &quot;With &quot;Killing the Dream&quot;, he [Posner] has written a superb book: a model of investigation, meticulous in its discovery and presentation of evidence, unbiased in its exploration of every claim. And it is a wonderfully readable book, as gripping as a first-class detective story.&quot;

On the other hand, conspiracy theorists bristled at &quot;Killing the Dream&quot;, criticizing Posner for in part basing it on &quot;a psychological evaluation of James Earl Ray, which he [Posner] is not qualified to give, and he dismisses evidence of conspiracy in King&#x27;s murder as cynical attempts to exploit the tragedy&quot;. William Pepper, Ray&#x27;s final defense attorney, repeatedly dismissed Posner&#x27;s book as inaccurate and misleading. 

Dexter King, one of Martin Luther King&#x27;s sons, also criticized it. In 1999, the King family, represented by Pepper, brought a civil lawsuit in which a jury found evidence of a conspiracy involving Loyd Jowers, the owner of a restaurant near the assassination site. In response to that verdict, Posner told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;It distresses me greatly that the legal system was used in such a callous and farcical manner in Memphis. If the King family wanted a rubber stamp of their own view of the facts, they got it.&quot;

=== &quot;Motown&quot; ===
Posner seemingly took a respite from assassination controversy in his 2003 book, &quot;Motown: Music, Money, Sex and Power&quot;, a business history of one of the most successful U.S. recording labels. &quot;The New York Times&quot;s Janet Maslin said the book was &quot;actually a much more reputable book than its title suggests&quot; and concludes that &quot;Happily, Mr. Posner, a former Wall Street lawyer, has a good ear for tales, tall or otherwise. And he also assiduously digs into the business practices that turned the Motown story sour.&quot; Most of the mainstream press echoed the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; which concluded that &quot;Posner offers the most objective and thoroughly accurate history of the label to date, plus a detailed and complex portrait of its founder, Berry Gordy&quot;.
In his &quot;New York Times&quot; review of the 2013 Broadway show &quot;Motown: The Musical&quot;, Charles Isherwood noted: &quot;For a full and coherent history of Mr. Gordy&#x27;s game-changing music factory, you&#x27;d need to check out Gerald Posner&#x27;s engrossing book &#x27;Motown: Music, Money, Sex and Power.&#x27; The criticism by some of &quot;Motown&quot; was that Posner was &quot;tone deaf about music&quot; but invariably noted that since he had written a business history, not a review of the label&#x27;s music, &quot;to his credit, Posner claims to be nothing more than a historian anyway ...&quot;

=== &quot;Why America Slept&quot; ===
In 2003 Random House published Posner&#x27;s &quot;Why America Slept&quot;, which discusses the conspiracy of the al-Qaeda terrorists who were responsible for the September 11, 2001, attacks. In the book, Posner claims that Prince Ahmed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud had ties to al-Qaeda and advance knowledge of the 9/11 attacks. This assertion was strongly denied by Prince Ahmed&#x27;s family, who pointed out that he in fact loved the U.S., spent time at his home there, and invested heavily in the U.S. horse racing industry. Prince Ahmed, two other Saudi princes named by Posner, and the chief of the Pakistani Air Force all died within days of each other from a blood clot after a simple operation, a car wreck involving only one vehicle, dehydration in the desert and a sabotaged helicopter explosion. Three of the men were in their forties, and one in his twenties. In &quot;Why America Slept&quot;, Posner became the first journalist to reveal the details of a U.S. interrogation against one of the highest-ranking al-Qaeda suspects caught to date. &quot;Why America Slept&quot; reached No. 2 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

=== &quot;Secrets of the Kingdom&quot; ===
In his 2005 book &quot;Secrets of the Kingdom: The Inside Story of the Secret Saudi-U.S. Connection&quot;, Posner provides an account of the &quot;close&quot; business and personal relationship between the House of Saud and the U.S. government, including discussions of &quot;dirty bomb&quot; technology and the financial and political maneuvering surrounding 9/11. Posner also asserts that the Saudis have built an elaborate doomsday scenario around their oil fields. The Saudis have denied this, and some skepticism has been expressed about the plausibility of Posner&#x27;s account of such a scheme. According to Posner, he and his wife Trisha have been banned from entering Saudi Arabia as a result of the book.

=== &quot;Miami Babylon&quot; ===
This 2009 book explores the history of Miami Beach, with a particular focus on corruption, extravagance, and the drug trade. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; review, Byron Burroughs said: &quot;Where Posner thrives is telling the stories of the first developers and artists who foresaw what Miami Beach would become and worked against all odds to build it.&quot; Some of the individuals interviewed by Posner for &quot;Miami Babylon&quot; have complained of severe misquoting and inaccuracies. &quot;Miami Babylon&quot; has been optioned for a television series. The original name for the book was listed as &quot;American Babylon&quot;, but it was changed prior to publication.

=== &quot;God&#x27;s Bankers&quot; ===
&quot;God&#x27;s Bankers&quot; is a 2015 book based on a 200-year history of Vatican finances and the Vatican Bank. It became Posner&#x27;s third &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller (after &quot;Case Closed&quot; and &quot;Why America Slept&quot;) on February 22, 2015.

In the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Damon Linker said that &quot;&quot;God&#x27;s Bankers&quot; provides an exhaustive history of financial machinations at the center of the church in Rome, from the final decades of the 19th century down to Pope Francis&#x27; sincere but as yet inconclusive efforts to reform the church&#x27;s labyrinthine bureaucracy. ... From there Posner weaves an extraordinarily intricate tale of intrigue, corruption and organized criminality. ... The cumulative effect of Posner&#x27;s detective work is an acute sensation of disgust—along with a mix of admiration for and skepticism about Pope Francis&#x27; efforts to reform the Vatican Bank and its curial enablers.&quot; Trine Tsouderos wrote in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;: &quot;Wall-Street-lawyer-turned-author Gerald Posner lays it all out in his deeply researched, passionately argued book, &quot;God&#x27;s Bankers&quot;.&quot; According to &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, &quot;Posner uses his superlative investigative skills to craft a fascinating and comprehensive look at the dark side of the Catholic Church ... Accessible and well written, Posner&#x27;s is the definitive history of the topic to date.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; said: &quot;A dogged reporter exhaustively pursues the nefarious enrichment of the Vatican, from the Borgias to Pope Francis ... A meticulous work that cracks wide open the Vatican&#x27;s legendary, enabling secrecy.&quot;

&quot;Booklist&quot; said that &quot;A decade of exhaustive research into the deep and mysterious history of the Vatican&#x27;s finances is a monumental task, but controversial author Posner proves more than up to this daunting challenge. ... It&#x27;s a fast-paced read that brings history alive on every page. The book will captivate those who prefer their historical nonfiction spiked with real-life tales of murder, power, and intrigue.&quot;

Some reviewers have noted that &quot;God&#x27;s Bankers&quot; contains inaccuracies, the most serious of which is Posner&#x27;s allegation in Chapter 11 that Bernardino Nogara, the wartime director of the Vatican&#x27;s &quot;Amministrazione Speciale per la Santa Sede&quot;, was a Nazi intelligence agent. This allegation is based on his finding of a man named Nogara named in the interrogation report of &quot;Abwehr&quot; recruiter Reinhard Reme, which he suggests could only be Bernardino Nogara, who was therefore working for the Nazis throughout World War II. Dr. Marilyn Mallory, a scholar familiar with the pontificates of Popes Pius XI and Pius XII, rebutted Posner in a 2015 article in &quot;Inside the Vatican&quot;, asserting that the interrogation report, found in the National Archives in London, identifies the man as Bruno Nogara, a Venice school teacher who was arrested by the Allies in April 1945. Faced with this evidence, Posner amended the paperback version of &quot;God&#x27;s Bankers&quot;, now stating on page 137 that there were in fact two &quot;Abwehr&quot; agents named Nogara: Bruno Nogara and Branch Nogara, listed in Appendix C of Reme&#x27;s interrogation report. Posner argues that it is Bruno Nogara, who is listed as a member of &quot;Abwehr&quot; Unit 257 under &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; Hubert Pfannenstiel, while Branch Nogara is listed under &quot;Abwehr&quot; Unit 254, commanded by &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; Ernst Schmidt-Burck. Thus, there were two different &quot;Abwehr&quot; units under two different commanders, and therefore two different Nogaras.

But &quot;The Tablet&quot;, a London-based Catholic journal, points out that the source cited by Posner, a copy of which can be read online, clearly identifies Branch Nogara not as a person, but as the small town of Nogara located just north of the River Po, where &quot;Abwehr&quot; Unit 254 maintained its supply depot. According to &quot;The Tablet&quot;, there is no second person named Nogara.

Citing disclosures in &quot;God&#x27;s Bankers&quot;, Posner wrote an opinion editorial in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on February 13, 2015 calling on Pope Francis &quot;to approve the release of the Vatican&#x27;s Holocaust-era files in its secret archives. They probably contain not only answers to how early the Vatican knew about the Nazis&#x27; mass murder of innocents, but also crucially important documents from the Vatican Bank, founded in June 1942.&quot; Subsequently, Posner started collecting online signatures in petitions to Pope Francis to release the Vatican Bank&#x27;s World War II archives and the Vatican&#x27;s Holocaust documents. Posner said that his goal was to get more than 1,000 signatures to present to Pope Francis when the Pope visited the U.S. in September 2015.

=== &quot;PHARMA&quot; ===
Posner&#x27;s history of the American pharmaceutical industry was published by Simon &amp; Schuster imprint Avid Reader Press for March 10, 2020. &quot;Kirkus&quot; said that the book is &quot;A shocking, rousing condemnation of an industry clearly in need of better policing.&quot; &quot;Literary Hub&quot; selected &quot;PHARMA&quot; as one of the &quot;most anticipated books of 2020,&quot; and in a review, author John Freeman stated: &quot;The cat’s out of the bag on this one, we all know pharma has been a disaster for many Americans, but Gerald Posner specializes in telling you what you don’t know: in his &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers like &quot;Case Closed&quot; and books like &quot;Hitler’s Children&quot; or &quot;God’s Bankers&quot;, what he has perfected is achieving the kind of disgust only a massive research dive can bring... Posner has created a medical leviathan for our times.&quot; Beth Macy, author of Dopesick, says that &quot;I could not put down Gerald Posner’s &quot;Pharma&quot;, the definitive story of how one family, the Sacklers, set out to get exquisitely rich on the back of unsuspecting Americans—then blamed the so-called &#x27;abusers&#x27; instead of their own highly addictive drug.&quot;

Natasha Singer in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; said the book was “A withering and encyclopedic indictment of a drug industry that often seems to prioritize profits over patients…[PHARMA] reads like a pharmaceutical version of cops and robbers.&quot; &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; also selected &quot;Pharma&quot; as one of &quot;11 Editor&#x27;s Weekly Choices,&quot; calling referring to the book as a &quot;major work&quot;

&quot;PHARMA&quot; included extensive coverage of the opioid epidemic and the Sackler family. In STAT News, Posner listed some of his new findings about the Sackler family. In &quot;WIRED&quot;, Posner wrote about Marianne Skolek, who became an activist against Purdue Pharma and its narcotic painkiller, OxyContin, after her daughter died of an overdose.

&quot;PHARMA&quot; was published the day before the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. A week before publication, Posner wrote an opinion piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Big Pharma May Pose an Obstacle to Vaccine Development.&quot; He called COVID-19 &quot;the ultimate test case for whether drug firms might at last become full partners in a public-private partnership.&quot;

Posner&#x27;s penultimate chapter is titled &quot;The Coming Pandemic&quot;. Biochemist Karen Bush told Posner in a 2016 interview that when it comes to the next pandemic, “It is not a question of if, it is a question of when.” &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; wrote that while &quot;Long before coronavirus, Gerald Posner began writing ‘Pharma,’ which warns of ‘The Coming Pandemic.’ In Literary Hub, Posner wrote &quot;On the Near Impossibility of Planning for a Viral Pandemic.&quot;

The Society of American Business Editors and Writers selected &#x27;PHARMA&#x27; as a finalist for the Best Business Book of 2020

The Florida Book Award selected &#x27;PHARMA&#x27; for its Gold Medal award for the Best General Nonfiction Book of 2020.

Posner relied on his reporting from &#x27;PHARMA&#x27; to write a series of opinion pieces in national publications about either shortcomings in the drug industry or about the concerns that the Sackler family might not be held accountable for their role in the marketing of Oxycontin in their privately-owned drug company, Purdue Pharma. In the &quot; Los Angeles Times&quot; he argued for the appointment of an independent examiner in the bankruptcy of Purdue Pharma so that the case would not leave &quot;unanswered the many troubling questions about the full extent of the [Sackler] family’s role in igniting and fanning the opioid epidemic for its own profit.&quot; Posner subsequently co-wrote two opinion pieces about the Sacklers in &quot;The New York Times.&quot; In July 2020, he joined with bankruptcy law professor Ralph Brubaker in a piece titled &quot;The Sacklers Could Get Away With It.&quot; Posner wrote &quot;At stake is whether there will ever be a fair assessment of responsibility for America’s deadly prescription drug epidemic.&quot; In December, Posner teamed with another bankruptcy law professor, Jonathan C. Lipson, in a &quot;New York Times&quot; opinion piece titled &quot;The Sacklers’ Last Poison Pill.&quot;

Besides the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma, Posner joined Margarida Jorge, the campaign director for Lower Drug Prices Now, in a &quot;Newsweek&quot; opinion piece that criticized pharmaceutical executives for profiting from rumors and press releases about COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. And in February 2021, Posner wrote in &quot;USA Today&quot; asking President Biden not to make Janet Woodcock the permanent director of the Food and Drug Administration. Posner wrote that &quot;The Biden administration should avoid rewarding any government official who contributed to the opioid crisis having become the most lethal prescription drug epidemic in American history.&quot;

Posner also helped break the story of the role McKinsey &amp; Company had in advising Purdue Pharma how to energize its flagging OxyContin sales.

Tucker Carlson, when interviewing Posner about his reporting that the Sacklers might evade justice for their role in the opioid epidemic, said &quot;Gerald Posner may be the best known and most thorough investigative reporter in this country.&quot;

=== Editorial writings ===
Posner supported Al Gore during the 2000 presidential election, and wrote a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial shortly after the 9/11 attacks reversing his opinion of George W. Bush. Later he changed his opinion again; in October 2006, in &quot;An Open Letter to the President&quot;, published on &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, he reverted to his original position that Bush was a bad president stifled by his stubbornness. He also wrote about investigative issues for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Talk&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. He was a regular contributor to NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot;, as well as other national shows on the History Channel, CNN, FOX News, and CBS. He was a frequent guest on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;. A member of the National Advisory Board of the National Writers Union, Posner is also a member of the Authors Guild, International PEN, The Committee to Protect Journalists, and Phi Beta Kappa. He worked on all his projects with his wife, Trisha Posner, who is also an author and artist. Posner was the Chief Investigative Reporter for &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, until he resigned over plagiarism charges in 2010.

=== Film projects ===
Posner was a regular panelist on &quot;HistoryCENTER&quot;, the History Channel&#x27;s weekly current affairs discussion program, from 2000 to 2002. He has also had an on-air role in broadcast documentaries, including among others the 1993 &quot;Frontline&quot; &quot;Who Was Lee Harvey Oswald?&quot;; &quot;Who Killed JFK: The Final Chapter&quot; (1994); &quot;Hitler and Stalin, A Legacy of Hate&quot;(1994); &quot;The Secret KGB JFK Assassination File&quot; (1999); &quot;Jack Ruby on Trial&quot; History Channel (2004); &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, History Channel (2002); &quot;Conspiracy&quot;, TV Series (2004–05); &quot;Beyond Biba – A Portrait of Barbara Hulanicki&quot;, (2009); &quot;Roads to Memphis&quot;, a look at the Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination, American Experience PBS, 2010; and &quot;JFK Assassination: The Definitive Guide&quot;, History Channel (2013).

Posner has also been a historical consultant on two Holocaust-related episodes – &quot;Liberation and Revenge&quot; and &quot;Frenzied Killing&quot;, both in 2005 – of the documentary series &quot;Auschwitz: The Nazis and the &#x27;Final Solution&#x27;&quot;. He was also the consultant to &quot;Inheritance&quot;, a 2006 documentary about the story of Monika Hertwig and her effort to grapple with the enormity of the crimes of her father, Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp commander, Amon Göth. And in 2013, Posner was again the Historical Consultant, this time for PBS/NOVA &quot;Cold Case JFK&quot;, an updated ballistics examination of the JFK assassination.

Posner was also the consulting producer of the film documentary, &quot;The Barrel of a Gun&quot;, by Tigre Hill, about the 1981 murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner, and Faulkner&#x27;s convicted murderer, Mumia Abu-Jamal.

==Legal career==
After graduating with honors from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in 1978, Posner moved from San Francisco to New York and started practicing law as a litigation associate at the New York–Wall Street law firm Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore. After leaving Cravath in 1981 he was a co-founder of the New York firm, Posner &amp; Ferrara. It was there that he became involved in an ultimately unsuccessful 4-year pro bono effort on behalf of victims of concentration camp experiments against the West German government and the family of Nazi experimenter Josef Mengele. 
After the publication of his first book about Mengele, Posner was &quot;Of Counsel&quot; to Posner &amp; Ferrara.
In 2010 he began a series of high-profile client representations. Among them were three brothers of Afghanistan&#x27;s then-president Hamid Karzai: Posner represented Mahmud Karzai and Qayum Karzai, as well as the so-called &quot;King of Kandahar&quot;, Ahmed Wali Karzai, who was assassinated in July 2011. Posner also represented Haji Ruhullah, an Afghan security contractor described by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as &quot;a leading warlord in Southern Afghanistan.&quot; Posner successfully defended Ruhullah against U.S. Army efforts to debar the Afghan from doing business with the U.S. government.
Posner also assisted other high-profile defendants. He advised Dr. Conrad Murray, charged with manslaughter in the death of pop icon Michael Jackson, as part of a British documentary over Murray&#x27;s role. Posner provided pro-bono advice to Viktor Bout, the Russian arms dealer nicknamed in the press as the &quot;Merchant of Death&quot; (played by actor Nicolas Cage in the film &quot;Lord of War&quot;).
According to Posner, his legal training has given him a &quot;big&quot; edge in his primary career as an investigative reporter and author.
Posner is a member of the New York and Washington D.C. Bars and the International Criminal Bar.

In 2015, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called Posner &quot;a merciless little pitbull of an investigator.&quot;

==Personal life==
Posner is married to author and journalist Trisha Posner.

==Controversies==

===NSA Surveillance of Princess Diana and the Paget Report===
In 1999, in the premier September issue of &quot;Talk&quot; Magazine, Posner wrote about the mistakes of French and British investigators in the 1997 death of Diana, Princess of Wales (&quot;Al Fayed&#x27;s Rage&quot;). According to Posner, &quot;an active U.S. intelligence asset&quot; let him listen to &quot;an innocuous portion of an undated conversation between [Princess] Diana and di Lima (the wife then of the Brazilian ambassador to the United States).&quot; The recording, Posner reported, &quot;was one of several collected by the National Security Agency.&quot; According to Posner, &quot;The NSA never directly targeted Diana, but picked up her conversations as an incidental part of a separate monitoring operation.&quot; The NSA refused to acknowledge that the surveillance tapes existed but did admit that it had &quot;39 classified documents about Diana totaling 124 pages.&quot; News that the NSA might have spied, even inadvertently, on the Princess of Wales, caused a furor in the United Kingdom.

Posner also reported that the driver of the car in which Diana was killed, Henri Paul, had met with his French intelligence handler in the hours before the fatal crash. &quot;In fact, according to an American law enforcement official and an American intelligence agent, Paul spent the last several hours before the crash with a security officer from the DGSE. That may come as news to the French police; in an internal report a French police commandant named Jean Paul Copetti concluded that it was &#x27;not possible&#x27; to determine Paul&#x27;s whereabouts during that time.&quot;

In 2006, Scotland Yard released The Operation Paget Inquiry Report Into the Allegation of Conspiracy to Murder: Diana, Princess of Wales and Emad El-Din Mohamed Abdel Moneim Fayed. Operation Paget was the result of a multiyear investigation by the British police into lingering questions about whether the death of Princess Diana might have been the result of foul play. The Paget investigators interviewed Posner. The final report confirmed that driver Henri Paul had in his possession 12,560 French Francs at the time of his death. That was the amount Posner had reported Paul&#x27;s intelligence handler had given him in cash only a few hours before the fatal accident. According to the British investigators, &quot;The DGSE stated that they did not know Henri Paul. Gerald Posner gave ‘source’ information that they were with Henri Paul on Saturday night. Even if correct, the source stated that the meeting was of a routine nature and not connected to the Princess of Wales’ visit to Paris. She was apparently only discussed in passing.&quot;

Operation Paget also reviewed Posner&#x27;s charges about the NSA in the report&#x27;s Chapter 15, &quot;Central Intelligence Agency/National Security Agency, USA.&quot; As to the portion of a taped conversation Posner heard, the British investigators concluded &quot;The inference from Gerald Posner’s information was that the Embassy, and not the Princess of Wales, was the subject of any telephone interception...Gerald Posner’s sources did not indicate to him that the Princess of Wales herself was under targeted surveillance by the NSA. The importance of such information, had there been any, would not be lost on the sources and it is reasonable to assume that they would have passed on that information to Gerald Posner had they been in possession of it.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; titled its coverage of Operation Paget as &quot;The Final Word on Diana&#x27;s Death (Don&#x27;t Bet on It)&quot;. It reported on what Posner heard when the intelligence source had played him a small part of a surveillance tape: 

&quot;Lord Stevens said he felt confident that nothing had been withheld from him, and added that even if the intelligence agencies had been eavesdropping on Diana, which they had not been, they would not have heard anything interesting.

For instance, the American investigative writer Gerald Posner says in the report that through a source, he heard an intercept of a telephone call between Diana and Lúcia Flecha de Lima, wife of the Brazilian ambassador at the time. The inference, the report says, was that the embassy, not Diana, was being bugged.

What did he hear? &#x27;I could only decipher a British woman and a woman with a slight Hispanic accent talking about hairstyles,&#x27; he said.&quot;

===Plagiarism and quote falsification===
In 2010, Posner was the chief investigative reporter at &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;. Following the revelation that a number of Posner&#x27;s stories for the &quot;Beast&quot; contained portions plagiarized from articles in other publications, Posner resigned from the &quot;Beast&quot;. According to Posner, the plagiarism was inadvertent and the result of the &quot;compressed deadlines&quot; of the &quot;Beast&quot; and confusing his assembled research with his own writing in the &quot;master files&quot; he assembled on each story. Allegations of plagiarism also surfaced concerning his book, &quot;Miami Babylon&quot; (October 2009). Posner said the &quot;Miami Babylon&quot; plagiarism occurred because of a new system of &quot;trailing endnotes&quot;, because an individual he interviewed read one of the plagiarized sources and reiterated it during the interview, and because he mistook other people&#x27;s writing for his own after scanning source documents into a computer database. The &quot;Miami New Times&quot; also found that Posner &quot;seems to add, subtract, or misattribute quotes&quot; and displayed a series of such &quot;apparently altered or misattributed quotes&quot;.

Posner subsequently hired attorney Mark Lane, threatening litigation against the &quot;Miami New Times&quot; on grounds of tortious interference (i.e., that its investigation and reporting of this case damaged Posner&#x27;s business relationship with his publishers) and emotional distress. Posner&#x27;s choice of attorney was particularly notable, as Lane was a well-known conspiracy theorist in regards to the death of President John F. Kennedy, while Posner had written his debunking of such theories in his 1993 book, &quot;Case Closed&quot;. In a press release, Posner stated &quot;Although I&#x27;m convinced Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated President Kennedy, I&#x27;ve always believed that had Mark Lane represented Oswald, he would have won an acquittal. That&#x27;s why Mark Lane was the obvious choice as my own attorney.&quot; Soon thereafter, the &quot;Miami New Times&quot; published evidence of additional plagiarism from multiple sources in both &quot;Secrets of the Kingdom&quot; and &quot;Why America Slept&quot;. According to Poynter Institute senior scholar Roy Peter Clark, &quot;This constitutes plagiarism by any definition I can think of. ... The capturing of someone else&#x27;s material that is this extensive cannot, in my opinion, have been done accidentally.&quot; Evidence was also presented indicating that Posner had repeatedly &quot;scrubbed&quot; elements of the journalism scandal from his Wikipedia page.

===Harper Lee lawsuit===
On May 3, 2013, Posner was named in a federal lawsuit brought by author Harper Lee in Manhattan. Lee claimed that Samuel Pinkus, her literary agent&#x27;s son-in-law, tricked her into signing away her rights to &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, directing the royalties to be paid into a corporation formed by Posner for that purpose.

Before Posner filed an answer, he and one other defendant settled with Lee and were dismissed from the lawsuit. The parties did not disclose the terms of the settlement. Posner told the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;: &quot;I have always maintained that not a single contention about me in the complaint was accurate. I was simply the wrong person named in the wrong lawsuit.&quot; To &quot;Law360&quot;, he said: &quot;I am gratified the complaint was dismissed. There was never any basis for this lawsuit against me.&quot;

<text>The Australian Broadcasting Authority was an Australian government agency whose main roles were to regulate broadcasting, radio communications and telecommunications. The Authority took over the functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal on 5 October 1992 as stipulated in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.

The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal took over the functions of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in the 1970s. The engineering function in some cases was handled by the National Transmission Agency when the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department ceased being responsible for telecommunications.

On 1 July 2005, the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the Australian Communications Authority were merged to form the Australian Communications and Media Authority.

<text>The Kaplan turbine is a propeller-type water turbine which has adjustable blades. It was developed in 1913 by Austrian professor Viktor Kaplan, who combined automatically adjusted propeller blades with automatically adjusted wicket gates to achieve efficiency over a wide range of flow and water level.

The Kaplan turbine was an evolution of the Francis turbine. Its invention allowed efficient power production in low-head applications which was not possible with Francis turbines. The head ranges from and the output ranges from 5 to 200 MW. Runner diameters are between . Turbines rotate at a constant rate, which varies from facility to facility. That rate ranges from as low as 54.5 rpm (Albeni Falls Dam) to 450 rpm. 

Kaplan turbines are now widely used throughout the world in high-flow, low-head power production.
== Development ==
Viktor Kaplan, living in Brno, Austria-Hungary (now in the Czech Republic), obtained his first patent for an adjustable blade propeller turbine in 1912. But the development of a commercially successful machine would take another decade. Kaplan struggled with cavitation problems, and in 1922 abandoned his research for health reasons.

In 1919, Kaplan installed a demonstration unit in Poděbrady (now in the Czech Republic). In 1922, Voith introduced an 1100 HP (about 800 kW) Kaplan turbine for use mainly on rivers. In 1924 an 8 MW unit went on line at Lilla Edet, Sweden. This launched the commercial success and widespread acceptance of Kaplan turbines.

== Theory of operation ==
The Kaplan turbine is an inward flow reaction turbine, which means that the working fluid changes pressure as it moves through the turbine and gives up its energy. Power is recovered from both the hydrostatic head and from the kinetic energy of the flowing water. The design combines features of radial and axial turbines.

The inlet is a scroll-shaped tube that wraps around the turbine&#x27;s wicket gate. Water is directed tangentially through the wicket gate and spirals on to a propeller shaped runner, causing it to spin.

The outlet is a specially shaped draft tube that helps decelerate the water and recover kinetic energy.

The turbine does not need to be at the lowest point of water flow as long as the draft tube remains full of water. A higher turbine location, however, increases the suction that is imparted on the turbine blades by the draft tube. The resulting pressure drop may lead to cavitation.

Variable geometry of the wicket gate and turbine blades allow efficient operation for a range of flow conditions. Kaplan turbine efficiencies are typically over 90%, but may be lower in very low head applications.

Current areas of research include computational fluid dynamics (CFD) driven efficiency improvements and new designs that raise survival rates of fish passing through.

Because the propeller blades are rotated on high-pressure hydraulic oil bearings, a critical element of Kaplan design is to maintain a positive seal to prevent emission of oil into the waterway. Discharge of oil into rivers is not desirable because of the waste of resources and resulting ecological damage.

== Applications ==

Kaplan turbines are widely used throughout the world for electrical power production. They cover the lowest head hydro sites and are especially suited for high flow conditions.

Inexpensive micro turbines on the Kaplan turbine model are manufactured for individual power production designed for 3 m of head which can work with as little as 0.3 m of head at a highly reduced performance provided sufficient water flow.

Large Kaplan turbines are individually designed for each site to operate at the highest possible efficiency, typically over 90%. They are very expensive to design, manufacture and install, but operate for decades.

They have recently found a new application in offshore wave energy generation, see Wave Dragon.

== Variations ==
The Kaplan turbine is the most widely used of the propeller-type turbines, but several other variations exist:
* &quot;Propeller turbines&quot; have non-adjustable propeller vanes. They are used where the range of flow / power is not large. Commercial products exist for producing several hundred watts from only a few feet of head. Larger propeller turbines produce more than 100 MW. At the La Grande-1 generating station in northern Quebec, 12 propeller turbines generate 1368 MW.
* &quot;Bulb&quot; or &quot;tubular turbines&quot; are designed into the water delivery tube. A large bulb is centered in the water pipe which holds the generator, wicket gate and runner. Tubular turbines are a fully axial design, whereas Kaplan turbines have a radial wicket gate.
* &quot;Pit turbines&quot; are bulb turbines with a gear box. This allows for a smaller generator and bulb.
* &quot;Straflo turbines&quot; are axial turbines with the generator outside of the water channel, connected to the periphery of the runner.
* &quot;S-turbines&quot; eliminate the need for a bulb housing by placing the generator outside of the water channel. This is accomplished with a jog in the water channel and a shaft connecting the runner and generator.
* The &quot;VLH turbine&quot; is an open flow, very low head &quot;kaplan&quot; turbine slanted at an angle to the water flow. It has a large diameter &gt;3.55 m, is low speed using a directly connected shaft mounted permanent magnet alternator with electronic power regulation and is very fish friendly (&lt;5% mortality).
*The &quot;DIVE-Turbine&quot; is a vertical propeller turbine with double regulation by wicket gates and speed variation. It covers a range of application up to 4 MW with efficiencies comparable to standard Kaplan-Turbines. Due to the propeller design with fixed blades it is considered a fish friendly turbine. 
*&quot;Tyson turbines&quot; are a fixed propeller turbine designed to be immersed in a fast flowing river, either permanently anchored in the river bed, or attached to a boat or barge.

<text>Scanian ( ) is an East Scandinavian dialect spoken in the province of Scania in southern Sweden.
Broadly speaking, Scanian has been classified in three different ways:
# Older Scanian formed part of the old Scandinavian dialect continuum, and is by most historical linguists considered to be an East Danish dialect group.
# Due to the modern-era influence from Standard Swedish in the region, and because traditional dialectology in the Scandinavian countries normally has not considered isoglosses that cut across state borders, the Scanian dialects have normally been treated as part of the South Swedish dialects by Swedish dialectologists.
# Many of the early Scandinavian linguists, including Adolf Noreen and G. Sjöstedt, classified it as &quot;South Scandinavian&quot;, and some linguists, such as Elias Wessén, also considered Old Scanian a separate language, classified apart from both Old Danish and Old Swedish.

== Status ==
There has been active campaigning from local Scanian interest groups to promote Scanian as a separate language on par with the official minority languages, though this has been rejected by Swedish authorities. Swedish linguists generally view Scanian as just one of many local or regional Swedish (or Scandinavian) dialects, some of which differ considerably from Standard Swedish but don&#x27;t meet the criteria of a separate language.

Scanian was originally classified as a separate language in ISO 639-3, but was declassified as a language in 2009. A request for reinstatement was submitted during the 2009 annual review process, but rejected on the grounds of mutual intelligibility; it is listed in ISO 639-6 with code scyr.

The official stance of the Swedish government, as relayed through the Institute for language and folklore, is that all languages and dialects which have developed from &quot;a Nordic proto-language&quot;, regardless of how independent their development has been from Swedish itself, are &quot;de facto&quot; Swedish dialects by virtue of being spoken on the territory where Swedish is the national or official language.

== History ==
Swedish and Danish are considered to have once been part of the same dialect, Old East Norse, up until the 12th century. However, some scholars speculate that there might have been certain dialect differences within the Nordic language area as early as the Proto-Nordic period. The term Swedish is not mentioned specifically in any source until the first half of the 14th century, and no standard spoken language had developed in either Sweden or Denmark before 1500, although some scholars argue that there may have been tendencies towards a more formal &quot;courteous&quot; language among the aristocracy.

Scanian appeared in writing before 1200, at a time when Swedish and Danish had yet to be codified, and the long struggle between Sweden and Denmark over the right to claim the Old Scanian manuscripts as an early form of either of the two national state languages has led to some odd twists and turns. Two Scanian fragments dated to around 1325 were initially claimed to be (younger) Old Swedish, but further research in modern times has claimed that the language was not Swedish, but Scanian. During the 20th century the fragments were thus relabeled early Old Danish by Scandinavian linguists, and as explained by Danish linguist Britta Olrik Frederiksen, the fragments are now thought to &quot;represent as such a newly claimed territory for the history of the Danish language&quot;. Like the Scanian Law, one of the fragments, a six-leaf fragment (catalogued as SKB A 120), is written in the runic alphabet. The place of writing, according to Frederiksen, has been tentatively identified as the Cistercian monastery at Herrevad Abbey in Scania. The fragment contains a translation of Mary&#x27;s lament at the cross. The other fragment (catalogued as SKB *A 115) is a bifolium with just over a hundred metrical lines of knittelvers, a translation from Latin of the apocryphal gospel Evangelium Nicodemi about Christ&#x27;s descent into hell and resurrection.

In modern Scandinavian linguistic research, the assertion that Old Scanian was a Swedish dialect before the Swedish acquisition of most of old Skåneland is now seldom argued by linguistic scholars, although the comparative and historical research efforts continue.
One of the artifacts sometimes referred to as support for the view of Scanian as separate from both the Swedish and Danish language is a letter from the 16th century, where the Danish Bible translators were advised not to employ Scanian translators since their language was not &quot;proper Danish&quot;.

=== Language politics ===
As pointed out by the Norwegian scholar Lars S. Vikør, professor, Nordic and Linguistics Studies, University of Oslo, in the 2001 book &quot;Language and Nationalism&quot;, the &quot;animosity between the two countries [Sweden and Denmark], and the relative closeness of their standard languages (dialectal differences within each of the two countries were greater than [between] the two standards), made it imperative to stress the difference between them in the standardization process&quot;. According to Vikør, the &quot;Swedish treatment of the Scanians perhaps shows [that] the most important element of the [linguistic nationalism] ideology is the desire to stress the difference from another linguistic entity that in some way may be considered threatening or challenging one&#x27;s own autonomy.&quot;

In Scania, the Swedish government officially limited the use of Scanian in 1683 by nullifying the self-rule granted in the Treaty of Roskilde and the Malmö Recess of 1662, where Scania had been granted the right to a certain degree of autonomy including preservation of its old laws and customs. Scania became fully integrated into the Swedish Kingdom in 1719, and the assimilation has accelerated during the 20th century, with the dominance of Standard Swedish-language radio and television, urbanization, and movement of people to and from the other regions of Sweden.

Bornholm was once part of Skåneland but rebelled and returned to Denmark in 1659. The Scanian dialect of Bornholm remained in use as a functioning transitional stage, but Standard Danish soon became dominant in official contexts, and the dialect is thought to be disappearing.

=== Historic shifts ===
The gradual transition to Swedish has resulted in the introduction of many new Swedish characteristics into Scanian since the 18th century, especially when it comes to vocabulary and grammar. In spite of the shift, Scanian dialects have maintained a non-Swedish prosody, as well as details of grammar and vocabulary that in some aspects differ from Standard Swedish. The prosody, pronunciation of vowels and consonants in such qualities as length, stress and intonation has more in common with Danish, German and Dutch (and occasionally English) than with Swedish.

However, as pointed out by the researchers involved in the project &quot;Comparative Semantics for Nordic Languages&quot;, it is difficult to quantify and analyze the fine degrees of semantic differences that exist between the Scandinavian languages in general, even between the national languages Danish, Swedish and Norwegian: &quot;[S]ome of the Nordic languages [..] are historically, lexically and structurally very similar. [...] Are there systematic semantic differences between these languages? If so, are the formal semantic analytic tools that have been developed mainly for English and German sufficiently fine-grained to account for the differences among the Scandinavian languages?&quot;

Research that provides a cross-border overview of the spectrum of modern dialects in the Nordic region has recently been initiated through the Scandinavian Dialect Syntax Project, based at the University of Tromsø, in Norway, in which nine Scandinavian research groups collaborate for the systematic mapping and studying of the syntactic variation across the Scandinavian dialect continuum.

=== Historic preservation ===
Scanian once had many unique words which do not exist in either Swedish or Danish. In attempts to preserve the unique aspects of Scanian, the words have been recorded and documented by the Institute for Dialectology, Onomastics and Folklore Research in Sweden. Preservation is also accomplished by comparative studies such as the Scanian-Swedish-Danish dictionary project, commissioned by the Scanian Academy. This project is led by Helmer Lång and involves a group of scholars from different fields, including Birger Bergh, linguistics, Inger Elkjær and Inge Lise Pedersen, researcher of Danish dialects. 

Several Scanian dictionaries have been published over the years, including one by Sten Bertil Vide, who wrote his doctoral thesis on the names of plants in South Swedish dialects. This publication and a variety of other Scanian dictionaries are available through the Department of Dialectology and Onomastics in Lund.

== Phonology ==

Scanian realizes the phoneme as a uvular trill in clear articulation, but everyday speech has more commonly a voiceless or a voiced uvular fricative , depending on phonetic context. That is in contrast to the alveolar articulations and retroflex assimilations in most Swedish dialects north of Småland.

The realizations of the highly variable and uniquely Swedish fricative also tend to be more velar and less labialized than in other dialects. The phonemes of Scanian correspond to those of Standard Swedish and most other Swedish dialects, but long vowels have developed into diphthongs that are unique to the region (such as and being realized and , respectively). In the southern parts of Scania, many diphthongs also have a pharyngeal quality, similar to Danish vowels.

== Vocabulary ==
Scanian used to have many words which differed from standard Swedish. In 1995 Skånska Akademien released &quot;Skånsk-svensk-dansk ordbok&quot;, a dictionary with 2,711 Scanian words and expressions. It should be mentioned however that not all of these words are in wide use today. While the general vocabulary in modern Scanian does not differ considerably from Standard Swedish, a few specifically Scanian words still exist which are known in all of Scania, occurring frequently among a majority of the speakers. These are some examples:
* &quot;alika&quot;, &quot;jackdaw&quot; (Standard Swedish: &quot;kaja&quot;, Danish: &quot;allike&quot;)

<doc id="754575" wikidata="Q499797" url="?curid=754575" title="Trinity River (California)">
<text>The Trinity River (Yurok: Hoopa or Hupa; Hupa: hun&#x27;) is a major river in northwestern California in the United States and is the principal tributary of the Klamath River. The Trinity flows for through the Klamath Mountains and Coast Ranges, with a watershed area of nearly in Trinity and Humboldt Counties. Designated a National Wild and Scenic River, along most of its course the Trinity flows swiftly through tight canyons and mountain meadows.

The river is known for its once prolific runs of anadromous fish, notably Chinook salmon and steelhead, which sustained Native American tribes for thousands of years. Due to its remoteness, the Trinity did not feature prominently in the early European colonization of California, but the gold rush in the mid-1800s brought thousands of gold seekers to the area. The river was named by Major Pierson B. Reading who, upon reaching the river in 1848, mistakenly believed it to flow into the Pacific Ocean at Trinidad Bay. During and after the gold rush, the influx of settlers and miners into the Trinity River country led to conflict with indigenous tribes, many of which saw severe depopulation due to fighting and foreign diseases. In the following decades logging and ranching, combined with mining runoff, significantly changed the river&#x27;s ecology and led to the decline of its fish populations.

The Trinity River is an important water source for irrigation and hydroelectricity generation, as well as a major center of recreational activities such as gold panning, fishing and whitewater rafting. Since 1964 the Trinity River has been dammed to create Trinity Lake, the third largest man-made lake in the state. As much as 90 percent of the upper Trinity River watershed was diverted for agriculture in the Central Valley. In 1991 environmental regulations were enacted, requiring a greater release of water to the Trinity River in order to protect fish. However, the use of Trinity River water remains a contentious issue, especially in years of drought.

==Course==

The Trinity River begins deep in the Scott Mountains, in Trinity County, at the confluence of High Camp Creek and Chilcoot Creek. It flows south through a deep valley between the Trinity Mountains to the east as well as the Salmon Mountains/Trinity Alps and Scott Mountains to the west. The river picks up its first large tributary called Bear Creek near a series of large spring filled meadows roughly one mile from the headwaters. The short but steep Bull Creek comes in just shortly down stream from the West. Cedar Creek is the next major tributary that meets from the East. The river continues to flow in a Southwestern direction picking up numerous tributaries before entering Trinity Lake, a large reservoir created by the Trinity Dam. These tributaries include Picayunne Creek, Nyott Creek, and Sherer Creek, Sunflower Creek, and more. Coffee Creek, the Little Trinity River, Tangle Blue Creek, and Eagle Creek are the largest tributaries above the lake. East Fork and Stuart Fork of the Trinity River also flow into the reservoir along with many other tributaries. Just below Trinity Dam is the smaller Lewiston Dam, which diverts part of the Trinity River through a hydroelectric plant to the Sacramento River Basin as part of the Central Valley Project, providing irrigation water to California&#x27;s Central Valley.

Below Lewiston Dam the Trinity River passes the towns of Lewiston and receives another large tributary named Grass Valley Creek, before passing Douglas City and turns west, passing within a few miles of Weaverville, the seat of Trinity County and the main population center of the area. It then turns northwest and receives Browns Creek, passes Junction City, and receives Canyon Creek and the North Fork Trinity River at Helena. Further west it passes the former mining settlement of Big Bar and receives Price Creek. It then enters a deep gorge, which provides the route for Highway 299, the principal road connecting Redding to the Humboldt Bay area. At Burnt Ranch it receives the New River from the north. At Salyer the South Fork, its main tributary, enters from the south, nearly doubling the flow.

At the confluence of the South Fork, the Trinity River turns sharply north, entering Humboldt County. It flows through the wider steep-sided namesake valley of the Hoopa Valley Reservation, past the towns of Willow Creek and Hoopa. It joins the Klamath River at Weitchpec, above the mouth of the larger river on the Pacific Ocean. The confluence marks the point where the Klamath turns from its generally southwesterly course to flow north towards the sea. As the crow flies, Weitchpec is situated about northeast of Eureka.

The Trinity River is a predominantly rain-fed river, with the highest flows occurring between December and April and the lowest from August through October. The water level can rise quickly in the winter when large Pacific storms strike California&#x27;s north coast. Almost no precipitation occurs in summer, when the primary source of flow is snowmelt from the higher elevations of the Klamath Mountains and groundwater base flow. In addition, diversion of water to the Central Valley has greatly reduced the total flow of the river since the 1960s, though conversely, a required minimum dam release for protection of migrating salmon results in a flow rate during the dry season that is higher than it naturally would be.

===Streamflow===

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) operates eight real-time stream gages on the Trinity River. The lowermost gage, located at Hoopa, measures runoff from , or 97 percent of the Trinity River watershed. The annual discharge, averaged over the 1964–2013 period, was . The average discharge between 1912–1960, prior to construction of Trinity and Lewiston Dams, was . The maximum flow was on December 22, 1964, during the Christmas flood of 1964, and the lowest was on October 4, 1931.

The peak flow in 1964 was greatly attenuated by the Trinity Dam which had just started reservoir filling at the time, perhaps by as much as . However, the record-breaking rains of that winter swelled tributaries below the dam and contributed to a crest fully higher than the second highest peak, recorded in December 1955.

The other USGS gages are located at Coffee Creek (above Trinity Lake), below Lewiston Dam, above and below Douglas City, at Junction City, at Helena, and at Burnt Ranch.

==Watershed==

The Trinity River&#x27;s watershed drains a rugged, forested region of California&#x27;s North Coast. The highest point in the watershed is Sawtooth Peak in the Trinity Alps; the elevation is where the Trinity meets the Klamath River in the town of Salyer. The watershed is almost entirely covered by mountains, with the only level land in a few narrow valleys: the Weaverville basin, and the Hoopa, Hyampom and Hayfork Valleys. The Hayfork Valley is the largest agricultural area in Trinity County, with about of farmland. About 80 percent of the Trinity River watershed is federal land managed by the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. The remaining 20 percent are privately owned; about half are owned by logging companies.

The overall climate is Mediterranean, with cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Annual precipitation over the Trinity River watershed averages . Precipitation ranges from in lowlands around Weaverville and Hayfork, to as high as in some mountain ranges close to the coast. The high rainfall combined with the rugged geography results in extremely fast runoff and a high risk of flooding during winter storms. Large volumes of rocks and sediment carried by floods are spread along the rivers forming wide alluvial channels. In general, human activities such as mining and road construction have increased the rate of erosion within the watershed and consequentially the amount of sediment carried into the rivers. Dam building has had the opposite effect, by blocking natural sediment sources to a long section of the Trinity River. Both have had notable impacts on river geomorphology, altering the development of riparian zones and fish habitat.
The Trinity River watershed borders several major California drainage basins; these are the Mad River and Redwood Creek to the west, the Salmon River and Scott River (tributaries of the Klamath River) to the north, and Clear Creek and Cottonwood Creek (both tributaries of the Sacramento River) to the east and south, respectively. Fir, oak, and pine forests cover about 92 percent of the watershed. Chaparral and shrubs account for slightly over 5 percent, and grassland and barren land each cover approximately 1 percent. Riparian zones and wetlands encompass 0.5 percent of the watershed. Less than 2 percent of the watershed is urbanized.

About 86 percent of the Trinity River watershed is in Trinity County. As of the 2010 census, the population of Trinity County was 13,786. With a population density of 4.3 people per square mile (1.7/km2) it is one of the least densely populated counties in California. Only , or about 14 percent of the western part of the basin, is in Humboldt County. The part of the Trinity River watershed in Humboldt County is also sparsely populated, with the exception of the Hoopa Valley Reservation, which was home to 2,930 people as of 2011. Extractive industries such as mining and logging, and to a limited extent farming and ranching, have been the main economic drivers in the Trinity River basin since European settlement in the 1800s. These have declined in part due to increasing environmental regulations. Tourism has been an increasingly important part of the economy especially after the creation of the Trinity Lake reservoir in 1964.

==Geology==
The lands that make up the Trinity River basin today began to take shape over 200 million years ago by the collision of several exotic terranes – or crustal fragments of the Pacific Plate – with the North American Plate, causing uplift of the sea floor under what is now northwestern California. During the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, tectonic movement along the plate boundary produced a range of mountains much higher than those found in the area today. Over millions of years these mountains were eroded, then reformed again as the next oceanic terrane collided with the continental crust. This repeating cycle of erosion and orogeny created the complex &quot;jumble of different rock types&quot; that characterizes the region today. Rocks commonly found in the Trinity River area include gabbro, chert, granite, diorite, limestone, sandstone, serpentine, schist and marble. Gold-bearing quartz veins are widespread in local metamorphic rock formations; the richness of the area made it among the focal points of the California Gold Rush.
The Klamath Mountains, which make up the eastern part of the watershed are quite young in geologic terms, no more than 2 or 3 million years old. The present shape of the mountains was highly influenced by underground volcanic activity, which created batholiths, domes of igneous rock formed by cooled magma. They raised the elevation of the terrain above and created the widespread granite and diorite formations found in the area today. The higher mountains, including the Trinity Alps – the highest range in northwest California – were also sculpted by glaciation during successive Ice Ages, the last of which ended roughly 10,000 years ago. Glacial erosion produced numerous granite outcroppings, tarns, cirques and knife-edged ridges. Remnants of these glaciers, or &quot;glacierets&quot;, are still extant in the higher valleys.

The Coast Ranges pass through the western part of the Trinity River Basin and consist of even younger rock formations, chiefly the Franciscan Assemblage. The Franciscan formation consists of more unstable sedimentary and igneous rocks and soils that are highly breakable and prone to erosion. They formed even more recently in geologic history than the Klamath Mountains, primarily due to uplift along the Cascadia subduction zone. The Natural Resources Conservation Service refers to the Franciscan assemblage as a &quot;nightmare of rocks&quot; due to its complex and fragmented layers.
The most common type of rock is greywacke, followed by other types of sandstones and shales. Landslides and mass wasting are common in this region due to erosion as well as earthquakes.

==History==

===Native Americans===
An archaeological site on the Trinity River at Cox Bar, with spear points dating from 3000–6000 BC, has some of the oldest evidence of human habitation in Northern California. This site is believed to be part of the early Borax Lake Pattern culture. Archaeological evidence in the Whiskeytown area also indicates human presence as early as 5000 BC, although it is uncertain at what point the ancestors of modern Native American tribes arrived here.

The Wintu people are the first recorded indigenous group in the Trinity River area. Their traditional lands included much of the upper (eastern) Trinity River in the present day area of Shasta-Trinity National Forest. There were nine major groups of Wintu spread across the Trinity, Upper Sacramento, and McCloud River valleys as well as parts of the South Fork Trinity River and its tributary Hayfork Creek. The Trinity River Wintu were known as &quot;nomsu&#x27;s&quot; (&quot;those being west&quot;), and the Hayfork Wintu as &quot;norelmaq&quot; (&quot;south-uphill people&quot;). Many Wintu villages were located along the Trinity River, and were home to up to 150 people. Each village operated as an independent unit led by a chief, although the villagers interacted frequently through trade with each other as well as neighboring tribes, such as the Nomlaki, Achomawi and Shasta.
Since about 1000 A.D. the lower Trinity River has been inhabited by the Natinixwe, now known as the Hupa people. &quot;Natinixwe&quot; is an endonym meaning &quot;people of the place where the trails return&quot;. Their name for the Trinity River was &quot;hun&quot;&#x27; simply meaning &quot;river&quot;. The name &quot;Hupa&quot; or &quot;Hoopa&quot; appears to originate from the Yurok word for the Trinity River country, &quot;hopah&quot;, which was first recorded by ethnologist George Gibbs in 1852.

The Hupa lived in the fertile Hoopa Valley along the Trinity River and the Hyampom Valley on the South Fork – some of the few flat lands in a region otherwise dominated by rugged mountains. A Yurok village called Weitspus stood at the site of present-day Weitchpec at the confluence of the Trinity and Klamath Rivers. The Hupa traded with the coastal Yurok and Karok by using canoes to navigate the Trinity and Klamath Rivers. The trade arrangements with neighboring tribes were complex and involved the use of dentalium shells as currency.

The Tsnungwe people, also known as the South Fork Hupa, lived pre-contact in the South Fork of the Trinity River area and Burnt Ranch/New River area. After the Gold Rush of 1849, many years of battles occurred between the Trinity River Indians and the miners/soldiers. Most surviving Tsnungwe were taken to the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation. By 1900, a Tsnungwe community had re-established around the ancient principal village of at the mouth of the South Fork of the Trinity River. The tribe is still surviving there today and is recognized by both Humboldt County and Trinity County. The federal government considers the Tsnungwe to be a &quot;previously recognized&quot; tribe. The Tsnungwe Council is working towards having their federally recognized tribal status restored.

The Chimariko people lived along the Trinity River canyon near its confluence with the New River. They were enemies of the Hupa, but had friendly relations with the Wintu. The now extinct Chimariko language was of Northern Hokan origin, in contrast to the Athabaskan dialect of the Hupa and the Wintuan languages spoken by the Wintu. Carl Waldman describes in &quot;Encyclopedia of Native American Tribes&quot; (2014) that &quot;the Chimariko occupied one of the smallest homelands, if not the smallest, of any distinct linguistic group in North America.&quot;

The abundant salmon, steelhead and sturgeon runs in the Trinity River were central to the lives of indigenous peoples along the entire length of the river. Fishing provided their primary sustenance as well as goods for trade. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, native peoples took as much as of salmon from the Trinity River each year. Native peoples also made meal of berries, seeds and acorns, and hunted game animals such as deer and elk that were drawn to the Trinity River.

Due to their proximity to trade routes in and around the Central Valley, the Wintu came into frequent contact with European explorers, traders and settlers. These initial meetings were peaceful, but the Wintu population – along with many other Central Valley tribes – were decimated by a malaria epidemic in the 1830s, accidentally introduced by Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company fur trappers. In the following decades the remaining Wintu became embroiled in conflict as prospectors and settlers occupied their traditional lands. Some of these conflicts ended in deadly massacres. In 1846, one of the bloodiest single encounters occurred when soldiers led by John C. Frémont killed 175 Wintu, Maidu and Yana. In 1850 about 100 Trinity Wintu perished after being given poisoned food by white settlers. By 1910 the Wintu population had been reduced to about 1,000, from an estimated 12,000 prior to European contact.

The Chimariko also suffered heavily when European prospectors entered the region in the 19th century searching for gold. After clashing with the Europeans, many members of the tribe were dispersed to Shasta territory or killed. Some returned to the Trinity River in the late 19th century, after the gold seekers had left. People of Chimariko ancestry continue to live in the region, although the tribe functionally no longer exists.

Because of the geographic isolation of their homeland, the Hupa had few interactions with early European explorers, although they later came in conflict with miners looking for gold. Even after California became a US state in 1850, the Hupa continued to live on their traditional lands and were eventually granted a reservation here in 1876. They are the only Native American group in California to retain most of their original territory; today, the Hoopa Valley Reservation is the largest and most populous in the state.

===Explorers===
Jedediah Smith&#x27;s expedition to northwestern California in 1828 were some of the first Europeans to set foot in the Trinity River country. After departing from the Sacramento Valley Smith passed over the Klamath Mountains and arrived at what is probably now Hayfork Creek on April 18. They followed the creek to the South Fork and from there to the Trinity River and the Klamath River. After following the Klamath to the Pacific, they traveled north towards Oregon, thus becoming the first white men to travel from inland California to coastal Oregon. Smith and his party traded with the Hupas and Yuroks in the area and their encounters were generally friendly. Early maps of the area label the South Fork, the lower Trinity and the lower Klamath as &quot;Smith&#x27;s River&quot;. The name was later applied to the Smith River further north, which Smith also crossed on the same expedition. Harrison Rogers, a member of Smith&#x27;s party, called the Trinity &quot;Indian Scalp River&quot; although the reason for this name is unknown.

The Old Trinity Trail, which crosses the mountains between Redding and Weaverville (approximately where State Route 299 is today) was used by Native Americans for generations before Europeans came to the area. Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company fur trappers may have used this route in search of beaver as early as the 1830s and 1840s; trapping was common in the area until about 1845. The trail pioneered by Smith was also used by fur trappers, including mountain man Ewing Young in 1832. Today part of the trail also forms the route of California State Route 36. Major Pierson B. Reading (for whom the present city of Redding is named) explored the upper Trinity area in 1845 and is credited with the modern name of the river. Reading mistakenly thought that the Trinity flowed west to empty into the Pacific Ocean at Trinidad Bay. In 1849 prospectors confirmed the actual path of the river to flow into what, twenty years earlier had been called &quot;Smith&#x27;s River&quot;; however, Reading&#x27;s name stuck.

===Gold Rush===

In July 1848, not too long after James Marshall&#x27;s famous gold find at Sutter&#x27;s Mill – which started the California Gold Rush – Major Reading discovered gold on the Trinity River. The find attracted thousands of miners to the area and created boomtowns such as Douglas City, Francis, Hoboken, Lake City, Lewiston, Junction City and Quimby. Weaverville, located at the end of the trail Reading had established from the Sacramento Valley to the Trinity, prospered as the main trade center through which gold was exchanged for imported supplies and services. The initial discoveries were placer deposits, carried by the river to settle in gravel bars. The Trinity River gold rush is also noted for the large number of Chinese miners attracted to the area, as many as 2,500 by 1854. Many of the Chinese were from the Pearl River Delta (Guangdong region).

Mining activity was initially concentrated in the eastern (upper) valleys of the Trinity River around Weaverville, as the hostile Native Americans and treacherous gorges around Burnt Ranch precluded the transport of rations and equipment to places further west. For about two decades the area was extremely productive, second only to the Sierra Nevada (the Mother Lode) itself. The rate at which gold was extracted, and new methods pioneered to access the harder to reach deposits, was feverish. Author James Hilton remarked that Weaverville was a &quot;Shangri-La, that strange and wonderful somewhere which is not a place but a state of mind.&quot; The area was soon profiting $1.5 million a year, with hundreds of claims along the Trinity River equipped with flumes, waterwheels and other apparatus to separate fine gold from river gravel.
The Great Flood of 1862 largely obliterated the placer mining claims along this part of the Trinity River, spurring prospectors to push west, establishing a pack trail to the area around the New River and the South Fork of the Trinity. In fact, the New River was named thusly for being a &quot;new&quot; river to explore for gold. Although the river gold petered out by the 1870s, lode gold was discovered in the 1880s in the mountains above the Trinity River country. Because hard rock mining was required to access the gold bearing veins, new industries such as iron forges and stamp mills prospered in the region.

Another profitable way to access gold was hydraulic mining operations, which sprang up across the Trinity River country starting in the 1860s. At one point, there were 307 hydraulic mines in Trinity County alone, of which 145 were &quot;fully operational&quot;, all of which depended on the use of pressurized water to demolish hillsides in search of gold bearing ore. This had an enormous impact on the landscape – leveling forests, carving huge gullies and burying streambeds under dozens of feet of sediment – which still characterizes the area today. Elaborate flume, reservoir and tunnel systems were built to supply the massive quantities of water required by these &quot;hydraulicking&quot; operations.

The La Grange Mine which began operating in 1862 on Oregon Gulch, a small creek that flows into the Trinity, was the biggest hydraulic mine in California, covering over . Tailings washed from this single mine buried the valley, the creek and the entire town of Oregon Gulch (which had been purchased by the mine owners in anticipation of this) under a staggering 110 million cubic yards (84,000,000 m3) of sediment. This is equal to thirty times the volume of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

===Post-Gold Rush settlement===
In 1884 the California legislature banned hydraulic mining as the flow of tailings from hydraulic mines in the Sierra Nevada was silting up the Sacramento River, making it unnavigable. However, the Trinity hydraulic mines escaped this ban, as the remote and swift flowing Trinity River was not considered a navigable watercourse. Nevertheless, the largest deposits had been played out by the 1920s, and the mining settlements were abandoned or fell into decline. This brought on the last stage of commercial gold mining along the Trinity, as floating dredges (called &quot;doodle-bugs&quot; by the miners) were used to turn over the river bottoms that had been inaccessible by the placer miners a half-century earlier. After World War II commercial dredges continued to operate on the Trinity, but at a reduced scale, finally ending in 1959, when the last claim was bought by the federal government in preparation for dam construction of the Central Valley Project.
Although most of the miners left, either to return home or settle elsewhere, some stayed to work in the ranching and logging industries that became the economic mainstay of the Trinity River area. Some also continued to search for gold long after the major deposits were gone; even today, recreational gold panning remains a popular activity along the Trinity. One Mr. Jorstad who had been mining in the Trinity River country since the 1930s, continued to live in a small cabin at Pfeiffer Flat on the North Fork until his death in 1989. Jorstad&#x27;s cabin was an important rest stop for miners, hunters, hikers and fishermen along the North Fork for many years; it remains as a historical site maintained by the Forest Service.

Although settlers had been farming and ranching in the Trinity River valley since the beginning of the gold rush, the number greatly increased after the gold rush when miners decided to settle down and homestead in the area. One of the major ranching areas was the wide valley known as Trinity Meadows, which is now flooded by Trinity Lake. The Webber family bought a ranch along the Stuart Fork in 1922 and established a resort. Having traveled in Europe, the Webbers thought the area resembled the Austrian Alps, and so named the mountains along the upper Trinity River the &quot;Trinity Alps&quot;. During the 1870s, the Southern Pacific Railroad was extended from Sacramento through Redding and would eventually reach Oregon, making travel to the area easier than ever before.

Commercial logging had also been operating for years in the Trinity River country, but most of the timber produced was used locally. After World War II, logging greatly increased both due to high demand for housing domestically and abroad, and the introduction of more advanced technologies. In 1959 alone, loggers took 439 million board feet from Trinity County. The rate dropped after that, but logging continued at 200–300 million board feet per year well into the 1980s. Many logged areas were on steep mountains, and improper construction of roads and skid trails exposed slopes to erosion and landslides. In 1988 several environmentalist groups including the Wilderness Society, Audubon Society and Sierra Club filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service, preventing the cutting of 18.4 million board feet of salvage lumber in an area with particularly high erosion risk. This generated pushback in the local timber industry, whose decline has partly been attributed to more stringent environmental regulations.

===Central Valley Project===

As early as the 1930s, the state of California had floated the idea of diverting water from the rainy north to support irrigation in the fertile, but dry San Joaquin Valley. A diversion of the Trinity River was contemplated in order to boost the available water supply for the Central Valley watershed, but planners eventually determined that the extra water was not yet needed. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation took over the Central Valley Project from the bankrupt state of California during the Great Depression in 1933 as a federal public works project, and in 1942 it began investigations to dam the Trinity River. However, the Trinity River plan was dropped in 1945, after the completion of nearby Shasta Dam.

As the 1950s began, demand on the Colorado River – which forms the border of California and Arizona and provided most of Southern California&#x27;s water – was moving toward unsustainable levels. The Bureau of Reclamation restarted its surveys of the Trinity River basin as part of a larger proposal to move water from northern to southern parts of the state, and compensate for the shortages on the Colorado. The United Western Investigation, in 1951, proposed the damming of nearly every river in the North Coast region of California, chiefly the Trinity, Klamath and Eel. The Ah Pah Dam would have flooded the canyons of the Klamath and Trinity Rivers to form the largest reservoir in California. These grandiose plans culminated in the Pacific Southwest Water Plan of 1964, which sought to comprehensively link the water systems of California and the rest of the Colorado River Basin. One of the key projects was an aqueduct to transport North Coast water to the Imperial Valley, reducing its reliance on water from the Colorado River. However, with the exception of the upper Trinity River project, none of these dam and diversion projects were ever realized.
The Trinity River project was first drafted on October 1, 1951, and authorized by Congress on January 2, 1953, as the Trinity River Division of the Central Valley Project. In 1955 Congress authorized an annual diversion of of water (56 percent of total flow) from the Trinity River, stating that the water could be exported &quot;without detrimental effect on the fishery resources&quot; of the Trinity. In 1957 the Bureau of Reclamation revised the export volume to . Construction of Trinity Dam started in 1956 and was completed on December 23, 1963. The reservoir was originally named &quot;Clair Engle Lake&quot; to commemorate United States Senator Clair Engle, who played a crucial role in shepherding the Trinity bill through Congress; however, the name proved unpopular with locals, and it was changed to Trinity Lake in 1997.

Trinity Dam, an earth embankment structure high, was the tallest embankment dam in the world at its completion in 1962 (it was surpassed by Oroville Dam, also in California, in 1968). Trinity Lake can store a maximum of , or about twice the Trinity River&#x27;s flow at this point. Below Trinity Dam is the much smaller Lewiston Dam, the actual point at which the water is diverted. The Clear Creek Tunnel conveys water under the Trinity Mountains to the Whiskeytown Lake reservoir, and from there it flows through the Spring Creek Tunnel to join the Sacramento River at Keswick Dam. Along the way the water drops some through three hydroelectric plants, generating nearly one billion kilowatt hours each year. Water flow data for the Judge Francis Carr hydroelectric station located at the end of Trinity Tunnel indicates an annual average of , or , diverted from the river between 1963 and 2013.

The filling of the reservoir flooded the town of Trinity Center, one of the original main population centers of Trinity County, as well as the smaller communities of Stringtown and Minersville. Residents of the Trinity River valley were heavily opposed to the dam, but they had no recourse against eminent domain used by the federal government (although property owners were paid for their land). Many buildings in Trinity Center were moved to a new location on the western shore of the reservoir. The dam blocked salmon runs to of habitat in the upper Trinity River basin, destroying the fishing economy that had sustained local people for generations.

Other residents welcomed the dam project for the economic benefits it would bring via hydropower and tourism, as the gold mining industry that had long supported the region was greatly diminished by the 1950s. By 1986 tourism in the Trinity River country accounted for 50–75 percent of business in the summer and 25 percent in the winter. Many locals remained &quot;so bitter about the dam that they tore down signs and misdirected tourists&quot; for many years after the dam was built.

==Ecology==

With the exception of rocky alpine regions in the highest mountains, the Trinity River watershed is almost entirely forested. Mixed coniferous (fir and pine) forests dominate the landscape at elevations of up to . Common tree species include ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine, Douglas fir, white fir, red fir, sugar pine, knobcone pine and incense cedar. The watershed also includes some hardwood forests, typically located along canyon bottoms and streams, which are home to California black oak (&quot;Quercus kelloggii&quot;), madrone, tanbark oak, canyon live oak and bigleaf maple. Stands of Port Orford cedar are common along the upper Trinity River; Oregon white oak is widespread throughout lower elevations. Fir forests comprise almost 74 percent of the forests in the Trinity River watershed; pine and hardwoods account for 13 percent each. There are also limited amounts of chaparral, brush and grass/rangeland within the basin. Wildfires are common in the dry summers which receive little to no precipitation, aside from the occasional high elevation thunderstorm.

The Shasta-Trinity National Forest encompasses nearly the entire Trinity River watershed with the exception of private inholdings and the small area in Humboldt County. Large mammals found in the national forest include black bear, mountain lion, bobcat, coyote, gray fox, Columbian black-tailed deer (mule deer), and elk. River otters inhabit most streams. Other mammals include ringtails, raccoons, skunks, jackrabbits, martens and many squirrel and rat species including northern flying squirrel. Several species of bats are also found in the watershed, little brown bats being the most common. The area around Trinity Lake has a significant nesting bald eagle population.

Beaver also inhabit the Trinity River watershed although their numbers were much higher before fur trappers came to the area. In 1828, the Jedediah Smith expedition was helped across the Trinity River by the Yurok and camped on the east side of the Trinity River. His clerk, Harrison G. Rogers wrote, &quot;Mr. Smith purchases all the beaver furs he can from them&quot;, suggesting that beaver were then plentiful on the Trinity or at least in the surrounding area.
The Trinity River was once known for its prolific anadromous fish (salmon, steelhead and sturgeon) runs. The actual number of fish returning to the river each year to spawn, prior to European settlement, is uncertain due to the lack of records. During the first half of the 20th century, before damming, the fall chinook salmon run was estimated at anywhere between 19,000 and 75,500. The spring chinook and coho salmon runs were about 10,000 each and the annual steelhead run was about 50,000.

Forest and river habitats in the watershed have been heavily affected by human activities ever since Gold Rush mining began in the 1800s. Commercial logging has caused mountain slopes to become more prone to erosion; even in areas that are no longer logged and have seen secondary forest growth, abandoned logging roads pose a serious erosive threat. Grazing of livestock has also degraded grasslands and exposed soils to runoff. This has resulted in river channels becoming clogged and confined by sediment, harming salmon and steelhead populations by burying gravel bars used by these fish for spawning. Along the South Fork, this problem has been exacerbated by the inherently unstable rocks and soils of the Franciscan formation, causing mass wasting events that dump sediment into streams.
After the Trinity and Lewiston Dams were complete, the Bureau of Reclamation did not adhere to the water export limits set in the project&#x27;s authorization, diverting 72 percent of the total river flow and as much as 90 percent at certain times. On the main stem, dam construction has greatly reduced the capacity of the river to wash away excess sediment. The annual chinook salmon run has dropped by almost 80 percent since the 1950s. In 2002, 65,000 adult salmon perished in a fish kill on the lower Trinity and Klamath rivers (the fish were mostly of Trinity stock).

The Trinity River Division has also indirectly caused environmental impacts in other parts of California. Because no aqueduct or pipeline linking to the Imperial Valley or Colorado Basin was ever built, Trinity River water was and still is used in the Central Valley for irrigation. Most of it was used to develop new irrigation in the Westlands Water District on the western side of the San Joaquin Valley, which contains soils laced with salt and selenium. In the 1980s, water run-off from the Westlands district contributed to the highly publicized contamination of Kesterson Reservoir, part of the agricultural drainage system and a significant refuge for birds and wildlife.

After the completion of Lewiston Dam in 1963, the Bureau of Reclamation constructed the Trinity River Fish Hatchery to raise young steelhead, coho and chinook salmon. The primary purpose of the hatchery was to compensate for the loss of of anadromous fish habitat above Lewiston Dam. The hatchery is operated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to produce returns of 7,500 coho, 6,000 spring chinook, 70,000 fall chinook and 22,000 steelhead each year. In 2014, the California Fish Hatchery Review Project found that Trinity Hatchery raised coho were out-competing wild stocks. The hatchery has since been required to carefully time releases of young fish in order to reduce the risk of competition.

The deaths of a dog in 2021 after going swimming occurred due to cyanobacteria in blue-green algae on the river, east of Willow Creek. Algae blooms can occur during times of warm weather and low water flow.

===Restoration efforts===

After an environmental impact statement in 1991 the Bureau of Reclamation was required to make greater releases to the Trinity River below Lewiston Dam. On December 19, 2000, the Department of the Interior signed a Record of Decision (ROD) officially re-allocating Central Valley Project water for environmental purposes. This modified flow regime officially began in water year 2005. Prior to this, annual releases to the Trinity River ranged from , or about each year, with the exception of occasional flood water discharges. The ROD increases the minimum dam release to or about , even in &quot;critically dry&quot; years, with even greater releases made during years of normal and above average precipitation. These restrictions would reduce the Trinity River diversions about 28 percent on average; however, the impacts on the Central Valley Project as a whole would be far less, only about 1–4 percent. In addition, the project will periodically release high flows up to to simulate historic flooding and sediment transport conditions.

In 2015 Humboldt County won a lawsuit against the Westlands Water District for an extra of water from the Trinity River for in-stream flows. Previously, the Bureau of Reclamation had included this sum in the water released for fishery management. Although this means more water for the Trinity River, no provision was made for commensurately reducing Central Valley Project water diversions, increasing the risk that Trinity Lake could be drained to &quot;dead pool&quot; in drought years.

Construction crews have also worked to rehabilitate the river channel below the dam by clearing out mining debris and excess brush. However, these activities have been criticized by some environmental groups as too heavy-handed. The California Water Impact Network stated channel rehabilitation was &quot;an activity equivalent to a clear-cut on a Wild and Scenic River.&quot; Bulldozing of the riverbanks to clear space for juvenile salmon habitat has harmed steelhead spawning grounds, impacted public access and allowed the spread of invasive plant species. Between 2005 and 2011, restoration work cost a total of $36 million.

==Recreation==

The Trinity River and many of its tributaries have been part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System since 1981. The main stem is designated from a point below Lewiston Dam to the confluence with the Klamath River. The North Fork and New River are designated from the boundary of the Trinity Alps Wilderness to the mouth, and the South Fork from State Route 36 to the mouth. A total of are classified as &quot;wild&quot;, as &quot;scenic&quot; and as &quot;recreational&quot;. The South Fork is the largest river in California without a single dam along its length. Although fish populations have declined since the early 1900s, fishing for salmon and steelhead has recovered on many parts of the river. The Trinity is known as one of the best steelhead streams in the western United States and is home to both wild and hatchery fish. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for fish caught in the Trinity River based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in local species.

The Trinity is a popular whitewater rafting and kayaking river. Dam releases for fish restoration have incidentally increased the amount of water available for boating year-round. The river has three main whitewater runs, all known for their scenery and wildlife. The Pigeon Point section, alongside Highway 299, contains Class II-III (beginner to intermediate) rapids. Below the takeout at Cedar Flat, the Trinity flows through the extremely hazardous Class V Burnt Ranch Gorge, which was first run in 1971 by three kayakers, one of whom died of a heart attack soon after finishing the run, due to the arduous work of portaging many rapids. This gave the area a bad reputation for many years; it was not until 1983 that commercial trips began on this section of the river. The lower Trinity, much of which flows through the Hoopa Valley Reservation, is a Class II river with gentler and lower gradient despite having a greater volume of water flow.

Recreational gold panning is another pastime along the Trinity. However, many streams in the area are located on private property, or are part of existing placer mining claims. Claims in the area are administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Because the Trinity River flows through a patchwork of private and public lands, the BLM and Forest Service maintain 14 designated locations for river access between Lewiston and Pigeon Point (just below Helena).

<doc id="754576" wikidata="Q4771901" url="?curid=754576" title="Anthology of American Folk Music">
<text>Anthology of American Folk Music is a three-volume compilation album released in 1952 by Folkways Records. The album was compiled by experimental filmmaker Harry Smith from his own personal collection of 78 rpm records. It consists of eighty-four recordings of American folk, blues and country music made and issued from 1926 to 1933 by a variety of performers, divided into three categories: &quot;Ballads&quot;, &quot;Social music&quot;, and &quot;Songs.&quot;

Upon its release the Anthology sold relatively poorly and had no notable early coverage besides a minor mention in &quot;Sing Out!&quot; magazine in 1958. However, it would eventually become regarded as a landmark and influential release, particularly for the 1950s and 1960s American folk music revival. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 276 on their list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and, in 2005, the album was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress.

==Background==
Harry Smith was a West Coast filmmaker, magickian and bohemian eccentric. As a teenager he started collecting old blues, jazz, country, Cajun, and gospel records and accumulated a large collection of 78s, those being the only medium at the time.

In 1947, he met with Moses Asch, with an interest in selling or licensing the collection to Asch&#x27;s label, Folkways Records. Smith wrote that he selected recordings from between &quot;1927, when electronic recording made possible accurate music reproduction, and 1932, when the Great Depression halted folk music sales.&quot; When the &quot;Anthology&quot; was released, neither Folkways nor Smith possessed the licensing rights to these recordings, many of which had initially been issued by record companies that were still in existence, including Columbia and Paramount. The anthology thus technically qualifies as a high profile bootleg. Folkways would later obtain some licensing rights, although the &quot;Anthology&quot; would not be completely licensed until the 1997 Smithsonian reissue. Asch had a &quot;reputation for releasing copyrighted songs without going through the proper legal channels.&quot;

== Sequencing ==
Smith divided the collection into three, two record volumes: &quot;Ballads,&quot; &quot;Social Music,&quot; and &quot;Songs.&quot; The first volume consists of ballads including many American versions of Child Ballads taken from the English folk tradition. Each song tells a story about a specific event or time, and Smith may have made some effort to organize them to suggest a historical narrative, a theory suggested by the fact that many of the first songs in this volume are old English folk ballads while the closing songs deal with the hardships of being a farmer in the 1920s.

The first record in the &quot; Social Music&quot; volume mostly consists of music that was likely performed at social gatherings and dances with many of the songs being instrumentals. The second record in the volume consists of religious and spiritual songs, including some Gospel songs.

The volume of &quot;Songs&quot; consists of regular songs, dealing with everyday life. Critic Greil Marcus describes them as being about &quot;marriage, labor, dissipation, prison, and death.&quot;

Smith&#x27;s booklet in the original release refers to three additionally planned volumes made up of music up until 1950. Although none were released during his lifetime, a fourth volume was released posthumously in 2000. Entitled &quot;Labor Songs&quot;, this volume centers around work songs and union songs. The album contains later material than the original three volumes, anthologizing material recorded as late as 1940.

== Design ==
 Smith himself designed and edited the anthology and wrote the liner notes, which are almost as well known as the music, using an unusual fragmented, collage method that presaged some postmodern artwork. He also penned short synopses of the songs which read like newspaper headlines. For the song &quot;King Kong Kitchie Kitchie Ki-Me-O&quot; by Chubby Parker, a song about a mouse marrying a frog, Smith notes: &quot;Zoologic Miscegeny Achieved in Mouse Frog Nuptials, Relatives Approve.&quot;

Each of the three sets carries the same cover art, a Theodore de Bry etching of an instrument Smith referred to as the &quot;Celestial Monochord,&quot; taken from a mystical treatise by scientist/alchemist Robert Fludd. The etching is printed over a different color background for each volume of the set: blue, red and green. Smith incorporated both the music and the art into his own unusual cosmology. He considered each of these colors as corresponding to an alchemical classical element: water, fire, and air, respectively. The fourth &quot;Labour&quot; volume (released later by Revenant) is colored yellow to represent the element earth.

== Release and reissues ==
Folkways originally released the &quot;Anthology&quot; as three double-LP boxed sets on August 9, 1952. It sold relatively poorly initially. By 1953, Folkways had sold only fifty albums, forty-seven of which went to libraries and colleges and for a time, it was out of print because of copyright issues.

One of the first notable reissues was in the 1960s, released as three individual volumes like the original release. Irwin Silber replaced Smith&#x27;s covers with a Ben Shahn photograph of a poor Depression-era farmer, over Smith&#x27;s objections, although others considered this a wise commercial choice in the politically charged atmosphere of the times .

In 1997, Smithsonian Folkways Recordings which bought Folkways Records in 1986 reissued the collection on six compact discs, each disc corresponding to an album in the original set including replicas of Smith&#x27;s original artwork and liner notes. An additional booklet included expanded track information for each song by Jeff Place, excerpts from &quot;Invisible Republic&quot; by Greil Marcus, essays by Jon Pankake, Luis Kemnitzer, Moses Asch, and Neil Rosenberg, and tributes and appreciations by John Fahey, John Cohen, Elvis Costello, Peter Stampfel, Lucy Sante, Dave Van Ronk, Eric Von Schmidt, Chuck Pirtle, and Allen Ginsberg. The back cover to this booklet closes with a quote by Smith: &quot;I&#x27;m glad to say that my dreams came true. I saw America changed through music.&quot; At the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998, the reissue won awards for Best Historical Album and Best Album Notes.

In 2006, Shout! Factory and the Harry Smith Archive released a tribute album titled &quot;The Harry Smith Project: The Anthology of American Folk Music Revisited&quot;, a two cd/ two dvd box set culled from a series of concerts staged by Hal Willner that took place in 1999 and 2001. The album features Beck, Nick Cave, Elvis Costello, Steve Earle, Beth Orton, Lou Reed, Sonic Youth, Richard Thompson, Wilco and others covering the songs of the original anthology.

In 2020, &quot;Dust-to-Digital&quot; released a compilation containing the B-sides of the records included on the &quot;Anthology&quot; entitled &quot;The Harry Smith B-Sides&quot;. Some songs were not included due to the racist or offensive nature of the lyrics, which drew criticism from reviewers.

==Reception and legacy ==
Writing for AllMusic, critic John Bush wrote the compilation &quot;could well be the most influential document of the &#x27;50s folk revival. Many of the recordings that appeared on it had languished in obscurity for 20 years, and it proved a revelation to a new group of folkies, from Pete Seeger to John Fahey to Bob Dylan... Many of the most interesting selections on the Anthology, however, are taken from [obscure] artists... such as Clarence Ashley, Bascom Lamar Lunsford, and Buell Kazee.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, music critic Robert Christgau wrote &quot;Harry Smith&#x27;s act of history... aces two very &#x27;90s concepts: the canon that accrues as rock gathers commentary, and the compilations that multiply as labels recycle catalogue. In its time, it wrested the idea of the folk from ideologues and ethnomusicologists by imagining a commercial music of everyday pleasure and alienation—which might as well have been conceived to merge with a rock and roll that didn&#x27;t yet exist... Somebody you know is worth the 60 bucks it&#x27;ll run you. So are you.&quot; Jon Pareles, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said that the songs &quot;still sound marvelous and uncanny.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the album as number 276 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and number 278 in a 2012 revised list. It is the earliest released album on that list and also includes the oldest recordings dating back to Uncle Dave Macon&#x27;s recording of &quot;Way Down the Old Plank Road&quot; in April 1926. In 2005, the album was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, aesthetically, or historically significant&quot;. In 2007, The Guardian listed the album as part of their 1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die. It was included in the 2008 book 1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, and the 2009 book 101 Albums That Changed Popular Music. In 2012, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Though relatively little was written about the &quot;Anthology&quot; during the first years after it was released (the first known press reference to the collection was in the folk music magazine &quot;Sing Out!&quot; in 1958, which focused on Clarence Ashley’s &quot;The Coo Coo&quot;) musicians and writers tell of how much of an impact it had on them at the time. The music in the collection provided direct inspiration to much of the emerging folk music revival movement. The anthology made available music which was previously largely heard only in marginalized social and economic groups. Many people who first heard this music through the &quot;Anthology&quot; came from very different cultural and economic backgrounds than its original creators and listeners. Many previously obscure songs became standards at hootenannies and in folk clubs and coffee houses because they were in the &quot;Anthology&quot;. Some of the musicians represented in the &quot;Anthology&quot; had their musical careers revived. Some made additional recordings and live appearances. The collection brought the works of Blind Lemon Jefferson, Mississippi John Hurt, Dick Justice and many others to the attention of musicians such as The New Lost City Ramblers, Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. The Harry Smith Anthology, as some call it, was the folk music Bible during the late 1950s and 1960s Greenwich Village folk scene. As the liner notes to the 1997 reissue say, musician Dave van Ronk had earlier commented that &quot;We all knew every word of every song on it, including the ones we hated.&quot;

The &quot;Anthology&quot; has had major historical influence. Smith&#x27;s method of sequencing tracks along with his inventive liner notes called attention to the set. This reintroduction of nearly forgotten popular styles of rural American music to new listeners had impact on American ethnomusicology and was directly and indirectly influential on the American folk music revival.

&quot;Sing Out!&quot; published a full article on the entire set in 1969.

In surveying the critical writing on the &quot;Anthology&quot;, Rory Crutchfield writes, &quot;[t]his is one of the strangest aspects of the critical heritage of the &quot;Anthology&quot;: its emergence from relative obscurity to prominence as a revivalist manifesto without much transition. In terms of academic credibility, this partly came from the work of [Robert] Cantwell and [Greil] Marcus, which was published fairly close to the reissue of the collection.&quot;

<text>Covenantal nomism, in opposition to merit theology, is the belief that 1st century Jews in the land of Israel did not believe in works righteousness. Essentially, it is the belief that one is brought into the Abrahamic covenant through birth and stays in the covenant through works. It suggests that the Jewish view of relationship with God is that keeping the law is based only on a prior understanding of relationship with God.

The &quot;structure&quot; of covenantal nomism can be described as follows: 
(1) God has chosen Israel and 
(2) given the law. The law implies both 
(3) God&#x27;s promise to maintain the election and 
(4) the requirement to obey. 
(5) God rewards obedience and punishes transgression. 
(6) The law provides for means of atonement and atonement results in 
(7) maintenance or re-establishment of the covenantal relationship. 
(8) All those who are maintained in the covenant by obedience, atonement and God&#x27;s mercy belong to the group that will be saved. 
An important interpretation of the first and last points is that election and, ultimately, salvation are considered to be by God&#x27;s mercy rather than human achievement.

<text>The Fellowship (incorporated as Fellowship Foundation and doing business as the International Foundation), also known as The Family, is a U.S.-based nonprofit religious and political organization founded in April 1935 by Abraham Vereide. The stated purpose of The Fellowship is to provide a fellowship forum where decision makers can attend Bible studies, attend prayer meetings, worship God, experience spiritual affirmation and receive support.

The Fellowship has been described as one of the most politically well-connected and one of the most secretly funded ministries in the United States. It shuns publicity and its members share a vow of secrecy. The Fellowship&#x27;s former leader, the late Douglas Coe, and others have justified the organization&#x27;s desire for secrecy by citing biblical admonitions against public displays of good works, insisting that they would not be able to tackle diplomatically sensitive missions if they drew public attention.

The Fellowship holds one regular public event each year, the National Prayer Breakfast, which is in Washington, D.C. Each sitting United States president since Dwight D. Eisenhower has participated in at least one National Prayer Breakfast during his term in office.

The group&#x27;s known participants include ranking United States government officials, corporate executives, heads of religious and humanitarian aid organizations, and ambassadors and high-ranking politicians from across the world. Many United States senators and congressmen have publicly acknowledged working with the Fellowship or are documented as having worked together to pass or influence legislation.

Doug Burleigh is a key figure in the organization and has taken over organizing the National Prayer Breakfast since the death of his father-in-law, Doug Coe. The current president of the organization (starting in 2017) is Katherine Crane.

In 2009, Lisa Miller wrote in &quot;Newsweek&quot; that rather than calling themselves &quot;Christians&quot;, as they describe themselves, they are brought together by common love for the teachings of Jesus and that all approaches to &quot;loving Jesus&quot; are acceptable.

==History==
The Fellowship Foundation traces its roots to Abraham Vereide, a Methodist clergyman and social innovator, who organized a month of prayer meetings in 1934 in San Francisco. The Fellowship was founded in 1935 in opposition to President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. His work spread down the West Coast and eventually to Boston.

The author Jeff Sharlet described the beginning of the Family as a reaction to union activities of Harry Bridges, &quot;The Family really begins when the founder (Abraham Vereide) has this vision, which he thinks comes from God, that Harry Bridges, this Australian labour organiser who organised really the biggest strike in American history, a very successful strike, is a Satanic and Soviet agent.&quot;

In April 1935, Vereide and Major J.F. Douglas invited 19 business and civic leaders for a prayer breakfast meeting. By 1937, 209 prayer breakfast groups had been organized throughout Seattle. In 1940, 300 men from all over the state of Washington attended a prayer breakfast for the new governor, Arthur Langlie. Vereide traveled throughout the Pacific Northwest, and later around the country, to develop similar groups. The non-denominational groups were meant to informally bring together civic and business leaders to share vision, study the Bible and develop relationships of trust and support.

The Fellowship Foundation was incorporated by Abraham Vereide in Chicago in 1942 as Fellowship Foundation, Inc. It also acquired the names International Christian Leadership (ICL), Fellowship House, and International Foundation for venues as its global outreach ministry expanded. The Fellowship Foundation, Inc. does most of its business as the International Foundation.

By 1942 there were 60 breakfast groups in major cities around the US and Canada, including Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Washington and Vancouver. That same year, Vereide began to hold small prayer breakfasts for members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.

The Fellowship in Chicago, Illinois was Vereide&#x27;s center of national outreach to businessmen and civic and clergy leadership. Vereide had moved the group&#x27;s offices from Seattle to the more centralized location of Chicago, headquarters of the businessmen&#x27;s luncheon outreach &quot;Christian Businessmen&#x27;s Committee&quot;, which Vereide led with industrialist C.B. Hedstrom. That same year the Fellowship Foundation established a delegation ministry in Washington DC on Massachusetts Avenue at Sheridan Circle named &quot;Fellowship House&quot;. Vereide later described it as the nerve center of the breakfast groups.

In 1944, Vereide held his first joint Senate–House prayer breakfast meeting. In 1946, he wrote a book with Reverend John G. Magee, chaplain to President Harry Truman, entitled &quot;Together&quot; (Abingdon Cokesbury). In the book, Vereide explained his philosophy of visionary discipleship and gathering together in what he termed spiritual cells:

In January 1947, a conference in Zurich led to the formation of the International Council for Christian Leadership (ICCL), an umbrella group for the national fellowship groups in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Norway, Hungary, Egypt and China. ICCL, which on its website describes itself as &quot;a relational network of leaders that came into existence through a sovereign act of God&quot;, was incorporated as a separate organization in 1953. ICL and ICCL were governed by different boards of directors, joined by a coordinating committee: four members of ICCL&#x27;s board and four from the ICL&#x27;s executive committee.

In 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower attended the Senate Prayer Breakfast Group. He was invited by fellow Kansan Frank Carlson. By that time, Vereide&#x27;s congressional members also included senators Frank Carlson, Karl Mundt, Everett Dirksen and Strom Thurmond.

By 1957, ICL had established 125 groups in 100 cities, with 16 groups in Washington, D.C. alone. It had set up another 125 groups in other countries. During 1958, a mentor from The Navigators, Douglas Coe, joined Vereide as assistant executive director of ICL in Washington, D.C. After over 35 years of leading the Fellowship Foundation, Vereide died in 1969 and was succeeded by Richard C. Halverson as executive director. Halverson and Coe worked side by side until Halverson&#x27;s death in 1995.

The organization was profiled in the 2019 Netflix documentary series &quot;The Family&quot; based on a book by Jeff Sharlet.

==Influence==
D. Michael Lindsay, a former Rice University sociologist who studies the evangelical movement, said &quot;there is no other organization like the Fellowship, especially among religious groups, in terms of its access or clout among the country&#x27;s leadership.&quot; He also reported that lawmakers mentioned the Fellowship more than any other organization when asked to name a ministry with the most influence on their faith. Lindsay interviewed 360 evangelical elites, among whom &quot;One in three mentioned [Doug] Coe or the Fellowship as an important influence.&quot; Lindsay reported that it &quot;has relationships with pretty much every world leader—good and bad—and there are not many organizations in the world that can claim that.&quot;

In 1977, four years after he became an evangelical Christian and later Fellowship member, Watergate conspirator Charles Colson described the group as a &quot;veritable underground of Christ&#x27;s men all through the U.S. government.&quot;

Former Kansas governor Sam Brownback, also a former member of the Senate Prayer Group, has described Fellowship members&#x27; method of operation: &quot;Typically, one person grows desirous of pursuing an action&quot;—a piece of legislation, a diplomatic strategy—&quot;and the others pull in behind.&quot;

Rob Schenck, founder of the Washington, D.C. ministry Faith and Action in the Nation&#x27;s Capital, described the Family&#x27;s influence as &quot;off the charts&quot; in comparison with other fundamentalist groups, specifically compared to Focus on the Family, Pat Robertson, Gary Bauer, Traditional Values Coalition, and Prison Fellowship. (These last two are associated with the Family: Traditional Values Coalition uses their C Street Center and Prison Fellowship was founded by Colson.) Schenck also says that &quot;the mystique of the Fellowship&quot; has helped it &quot;gain entree into almost impossible places in the capital.&quot;

&quot;The Fellowship&#x27;s reach into governments around the world is almost impossible to overstate or even grasp,&quot; said David Kuo, a former special assistant in George W. Bush&#x27;s Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives.

==Beliefs and theology==
The Fellowship Foundation&#x27;s 501(c)(3) mission statement is:

&quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that the Fellowship has often been criticized by conservative and fundamentalist Christian groups for being too inclusive and not putting enough emphasis on doctrine or church attendance. NPR has reported that the evangelical group&#x27;s views on religion and politics are so singular that some other Christian right organizations consider them heretical.

David Kuo, who has been affiliated with the Fellowship since college, said of it that:
Current Fellowship prayer group member and former U.S. Representative Tony P. Hall (D-OH) said, &quot;If people in this country knew how many Democrats and Republicans pray together and actually like each other behind closed doors, they would be amazed.&quot; The Fellowship is simply &quot;men and women who are trying to get right with God. Trying to follow God, learn how to love him, and learn how to love each other.&quot; When he lost his teenage son to leukemia, Hall says, &quot;This family helped me. This family was there for me. That&#x27;s what they do.&quot;

Hillary Clinton described meeting the leader of the Fellowship in 1993: &quot;Doug Coe, the longtime National Prayer Breakfast organizer, is a unique presence in Washington: a genuinely loving spiritual mentor and guide to anyone, regardless of party or faith, who wants to deepen his or her relationship to God.&quot;

Investigative reporter Jeff Sharlet wrote a book, &quot;The Family: The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power&quot;, as well as an article in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; magazine, describing his experience while serving as an intern in the Fellowship. Sharlet did intensive research in the Fellowship&#x27;s archives before they were closed to the public. He also spent a month in 2002 living in a Fellowship house near Washington, and wrote a magazine article describing his experiences. According to his 2008 book, their theology is an &quot;elite fundamentalism&quot; that fetishizes political power and wealth, consistently opposes labor movements in the US and abroad, and teaches that laissez-faire economic policy is &quot;God&#x27;s will.&quot; He opines that their theological teaching of instant forgiveness has been useful to powerful men, providing them a convenient excuse for misdeeds or crimes and allowing them to avoid accepting responsibility or accountability for their actions.

Jeff Sharlet stated in an NBC Nightly News report that when he was an intern with the Fellowship &quot;we were being taught the leadership lessons of Hitler, Lenin and Mao&quot; and that Hitler&#x27;s genocide &quot;wasn&#x27;t really an issue for them, it was the strength that he emulated.&quot; He opined that the Fellowship fetishizes power by comparing Jesus to &quot;Lenin, Ho Chi Minh, Bin Laden&quot; as examples of leaders who change the world through the strength of the covenants they had forged with their &#x27;brothers&#x27;&quot;.

In one videotaped lecture series in 1989, Coe said,

In the same series, Coe also compared Jesus&#x27;s teachings to the Red Guard during the Chinese Cultural Revolution:

David Kuo said that Coe is using Hitler as a metaphor for commitment. The NBC report said &quot;a close friend of Coe told NBC News that he invokes Hitler to show the power of small groups—for good and bad. And, the friend said, most of the time he talks about Jesus.&quot;

==Secrecy==
In a report on the Fellowship, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found:

[Fellowship members] share a vow of silence about Fellowship activities. Oddly, it is categorized under US law as a church rather than a political lobbying organization, so financial sources and budget expenditures remain unknown. Coe and others cite biblical admonitions against public displays of good works, insisting they would not be able to tackle their diplomatically sensitive missions if they drew public attention. Members, including congressmen, invoke this secrecy rule when refusing to discuss just about every aspect of the Fellowship and their involvement in it.

The Fellowship has long been a secretive organization. Rob Schenck wrote that &quot;all ministries in Washington need to protect the confidence of those we minister to, and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s a primary motive for C Street&#x27;s low profile.&quot; But he added, &quot;I think The Fellowship has been just a tad bit too clandestine.&quot;

Prominent political figures have insisted that confidentiality and privacy are essential to the Fellowship&#x27;s operation. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan said about the Fellowship, &quot;I wish I could say more about it, but it&#x27;s working precisely because it is private.&quot; At the 1990 National Prayer Breakfast, President George H. W. Bush praised Douglas Coe for what he described as &quot;quiet diplomacy, I wouldn&#x27;t say secret diplomacy.&quot; In 2009, Chris Halverson, son of Fellowship co-founder Richard C. Halverson, said that a culture of pastoral confidentiality is essential to the ministry: &quot;If you talked about it, you would destroy that fellowship.&quot;

In the 1960s, the Fellowship began distributing to involved members of Congress notes that stated that &quot;the group, as such, never takes any formal action, but individuals who participate in the group through their initiative have made possible the activities mentioned.&quot;

In 1974, after several Watergate conspirators had joined the Fellowship, a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; columnist discouraged further inquiries into Washington&#x27;s &quot;underground prayer movement&quot;, i.e. the Fellowship: &quot;They genuinely avoid publicity... they shun it.&quot;

In 1975, a member of the Fellowship&#x27;s inner circle wrote to the group&#x27;s chief South African operative, that their political initiatives

... have always been misunderstood by &#x27;outsiders.&#x27; As a result of very bitter experiences, therefore, we have learned never to commit to paper any discussions or negotiations that are taking place. There is no such thing as a &#x27;confidential&#x27; memorandum, and leakage always seems to occur. Thus, I would urge you not to put on paper &quot;anything&quot; relating to any of the work that you are doing... [unless] you know the recipient well enough to put at the top of the page &#x27;PLEASE DESTROY AFTER READING.&#x27;

In 2002, Coe denied that the Fellowship Foundation owns the National Prayer Breakfast. Jennifer Thornett, a Fellowship employee, said that &quot;there is no such thing as the Fellowship&quot;.

Former Republican senator William Armstrong said the group has &quot;made a fetish of being invisible&quot;.

On January 5, 2010, Fellowship member Bob Hunter gave an interview on national television in which he stated:

But I do agree with you, that The Fellowship is too secret. We don&#x27;t have a Web site. We don&#x27;t have – we have a lot of good ministers, 200 ministers doing good works that nobody knows about. I think that&#x27;s wrong, and there&#x27;s a debate going on among a lot of people about whether and how we should change that.

==Activities==

===National Prayer Breakfast===

Fellowship Foundation is best known for the National Prayer Breakfast, held each year on the first Thursday of February in Washington, D.C. First held in 1953, the event is now attended by over 3,400 guests including dignitaries from many nations. The President of the United States typically makes an address at the breakfast, following the main speaker&#x27;s keynote address. The event is hosted by a 24-member committee of members of Congress. Democrats and Republicans serve on the organizing committee, and chairmanship alternates each year between the House and the Senate.

At the National Prayer Breakfast, the president usually arrives an hour early and meets with eight to ten heads of state, usually of small nations, and guests chosen by the Fellowship.

G. Philip Hughes, the executive secretary for the National Security Council in the George H.W. Bush administration, said, &quot;Doug Coe or someone who worked with him would call and say, &#x27;So and so would like to have a word with the president. Do you think you could arrange something?&#x27;&quot; However, Coe said that the Fellowship does not help foreign dignitaries gain access to U.S. officials. &quot;We never make any commitment, ever, to arrange special meetings with the president, vice president or secretary of State,&quot; Coe said. &quot;We would never do it.&quot;

At the 2001 Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearings for State Department officials, Sen. Bill Nelson, whose wife was on the board of the Fellowship, lamented that the State Department had blocked then-President Bush from meeting with four foreign heads of state (Rwanda, Macedonia, Congo and Slovakia) at the NPB that year. Senator Paul Sarbanes said of Nelson&#x27;s complaint: &quot;I&#x27;m not sure a head of state ought to be able to wander over here for the prayer breakfast and, in effect, compel the president of the United States to meet with him as a consequence... Getting these meetings with the president is a process that&#x27;s usually very carefully vetted and worked up. Now sort of this back door has sort of evolved.&quot;

&quot;It [the NPB] totally circumvents the State Department and the usual vetting within the administration that such a meeting would require,&quot; an anonymous government informant told sociologist D. Michael Lindsay. &quot;If Doug Coe can get you some face time with the President of the United States, then you will take his call and seek his friendship. That&#x27;s power.&quot;

In 2023, The International Foundation held a separate event from the National Prayer Breakfast called &quot;The Gathering&quot; at the same time. Attendees of this new event still watched President Joe Biden&#x27;s remarks from the National Prayer Breakfast through a livestream according to A. Larry Ross who is a media representative for The International Foundation.

===Prayer Breakfast movement===
A primary activity of the Fellowship is to develop small support groups for politicians, including senators and members of Congress, Executive Branch officials, military officers, foreign leaders and dignitaries, businesspersons, and other influential individuals. Prayer groups have met in the White House, the Pentagon and at the Department of Defense.

==== Russia ====
Doug Burleigh is a key figure in the organization and has spoken at the Russian prayer breakfast beside Alexander Torshin. Burleigh stated in 2017 that &quot;a breakthrough in relations between Russia and the US is about to occur&quot;. Maria Butina, who has admitted to working as an undeclared Kremlin agent, helped arrange for five Russians chosen by a top official to attend the 2017 National Prayer Breakfast which she also attended before she was indicted and imprisoned. Butina&#x27;s main contact in Russia was Torshin. Over 50 Russians attended the 2018 National Prayer Breakfast, including leading members of Putin&#x27;s government. Doug Burleigh was interviewed by the FBI because of his relationship with Maria Butina.

===Role in international conflicts===
The Fellowship was a behind-the-scenes player at the Camp David Accords in 1978, working with President Jimmy Carter to issue a worldwide call to prayer with Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian president Anwar Sadat.

Sharlet has criticized the fellowship&#x27;s influence on US foreign policy. He argues that Coe and the &quot;networking&quot; (or formation of prayer cells) between foreign dictators and US politicians, defense contractors, and industry leaders facilitated military aid for repressive foreign regimes. Regarding his relationships with foreign dictators, Coe said in 2007, &quot;I never invite them. They come to me. And I do what Jesus did: I don&#x27;t turn my back to any one. You know, the Bible is full of mass murderers.&quot;

===Private diplomacy===
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; examined the Fellowship Foundation&#x27;s ministry records and archives (before they were sealed), as well as documents obtained from several presidential libraries and found that the Fellowship Foundation had extraordinary access and significant influence over U.S. foreign affairs for the last 75 years.

The Fellowship has funded the travel expenses of members of Congress to various hot spots throughout the globe, an example being Robert Aderholt to Darfur. In 2002, Frank Wolf, Tony P. Hall and Joe Pitts traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan on a fact-finding congressional trip, meeting with the leaders of both Muslim countries. According to Pitts, &quot;The first thing we did when we met with [Afghan] President Karzai and [then Pakistan] President Musharraf was to say, &#x27;We&#x27;re here officially representing the Congress; we&#x27;ll report back to the speaker, our leaders, our committees, our government. But we&#x27;re here also because we&#x27;re best friends... We&#x27;re members of the same prayer group&#x27;&quot;.

Coe was dispatched to foreign governments with the blessing of Congressional representatives and helped arrange meetings overseas for U.S. officials and members of Congress. In 1979, for instance, he messaged the Saudi Arabian Minister of Commerce and asked him to meet with a Defense Department official who was visiting Riyadh, the capital.

The Fellowship has brought controversial international figures to Washington to meet with U.S. officials. Among them are former Salvadoran Gen. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, who in 2002 was found liable by a civil jury in Florida for the torture of thousands of civilians in the 1980s. He was invited to the 1984 prayer breakfast, along with Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, then head of the Honduran armed forces who was linked to a death squad and the Central Intelligence Agency.

Coe was quoted in a rare interview regarding the Fellowship&#x27;s associations with despots as explaining, &quot;The people that are involved in this association of people around the world are the worst and the best, some are total despots. Some are totally religious. You can find what you want to find.&quot;

Coe also claimed that the Fellowship does not help foreign dignitaries gain access to U.S. officials. &quot;We never make any commitment, ever, to arrange special meetings with the president, vice president or secretary of State&quot;, Coe said. &quot;We would never do it&quot;. The LA Times found that &quot;the archives tell another story&quot;.

The Fellowship has promoted reconciliation between the warring leaders of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, and Rwanda. In 2001, the Fellowship helped arrange a secret meeting at The Cedars between Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila and Rwandan President Paul Kagame – one of the first discreet meetings between the two African leaders that led to a peace accord in July 2002.

In 1994 at the National Prayer Breakfast, the Fellowship helped to persuade South African Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi not to engage in a civil war with Nelson Mandela.

According to Jeff Sharlet, Senator Sam Brownback is a Fellowship member who leads a secret &quot;cell&quot; of leading U.S. Senators and representatives to influence U.S. foreign policy. Sharlet reports that the group has stamped much of U.S. foreign policy through a group of senators and affiliated religious organizations forming the &quot;Values Action Team&quot; or &quot;VAT&quot;. One victory for the group was Brownback&#x27;s North Korea Human Rights Act, which establishes a confrontational stance toward North Korea and shifts funds for humanitarian aid from the UN to Christian organizations.

The Fellowship is behind an international project called Youth Corps, a network of Christian youth groups that Sharlet alleged attract teenagers, and only later steer them to Jesus.

Fellowship funds have gone to an orphanage in India, a program in Uganda that provides schooling, and a development group in Peru.

====The Fellowship and Uganda====
In a November 2009 NPR interview, Sharlet alleged that Ugandan Fellowship associates David Bahati and Nsaba Buturo were behind the recent proposed bill in Uganda that called for the death penalty for gays. Bahati cited a conversation with Fellowship members in 2008 as having inspired the legislation.

Sharlet claimed that Bahati reportedly first floated the idea of executing gays during The Family&#x27;s Uganda National Prayer Breakfast in 2008. Sharlet described Bahati as a &quot;rising star&quot; in the Fellowship who has attended the National Prayer Breakfast in the United States and, until the news over the gay execution law broke, was scheduled to attend the 2010 U.S. National Prayer Breakfast.

Fellowship member Bob Hunter gave an interview to NPR in December 2009 in which he acknowledged Bahati&#x27;s connection but argued that no American associates support the bill. President Barack Obama, in his address to the Fellowship at their National Prayer Breakfast in early 2010, directly criticized the Uganda legislation targeting gay people for execution.

In 2023, Fellowship paid for Tim Walberg&#x27;s keynote at the Ugandan National Prayer Breakfast, attended by president Yoweri Museveni. Walberg urged the country&#x27;s leadership to &quot;stand firm&quot; on the Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2023, and resist opposition from the United States, United Nations, or other international entities.

==Relationships with other organizations==
The Fellowship Foundation is linked to numerous other organizations:
* Wilberforce Foundation
* Traditional Values Coalition
* International Center for Religion &amp; Diplomacy
* Young Life International
* World Vision

==Handling of politicians&#x27; extramarital affairs==
In 2009, the Fellowship received media attention in connection with three Republican politicians who reportedly engaged in extra-marital affairs. Two of them, Senator John Ensign, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee in the Senate and the fourth-ranking member in his party&#x27;s Senate leadership, and South Carolina governor Mark Sanford, immediate past chair of the Republican Governors Association and U.S. representative from 1995 to 2001, were considering running for president in 2012. The affairs of Ensign and then-Congressman Chip Pickering, R-Miss., took place while they were living at the C Street Center.

===Ensign affair===
Ensign, a Fellowship member and longtime resident of the C Street Center, admitted in June 2009 to an extra-marital affair with Cindy Hampton. Hampton was Ensign&#x27;s campaign treasurer and the wife of his co-chief of staff, longtime friend and fellow worshipper Doug Hampton.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the C Street House &quot;pulsed with backstage intrigue, in the days and months before the Sanford and Ensign scandals&quot; and that residents tried to talk each politician into ending his philandering. An emotional meeting was reportedly held to discuss &quot;forgiveness&quot; between Hampton, the husband of Ensign&#x27;s mistress, and Senator Tom Coburn. Coburn, with Timothy and David Coe, leaders of the Fellowship, attempted to intervene to end Ensign&#x27;s affair in February 2008.

Doug Hampton said he was not directly advised by the Fellowship to cover up Ensign&#x27;s affair with his wife, but instead to &quot;be cool&quot;. After losing his job with Ensign and losing a subsequent lobbying job, Hampton has said that he was in financial distress and reached out to Coburn—a C Street resident—in an effort to reach an agreement with Ensign. Coburn has denied negotiating a deal, but has stated that he &quot;had worked to &#x27;bring two families to a closure of a very painful episode&#x27;&quot;. Hampton has expressed the belief that his friends at C Street abandoned him by choosing to close ranks around Ensign, and that for them, the episode was &quot;[more] about preserving John [Ensign], preserving the Republican party...preserving C Street&quot; than about doing the right thing.

Ensign&#x27;s efforts to cover up his affair were investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee and the Department of Justice.

===Role in affair of Mark Sanford===
South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford, who served as a congressman from 1995 to 2001, admitted in June 2009 to having an extramarital affair and said he had sought counseling at the C Street Center during the months before the news broke. Sanford &quot;was a frequent visitor to the home for prayer meetings and meals during his time in Congress&quot;.

===Pickering case===
Chip Pickering was a U.S. Representative from Mississippi from 1997 to 2008. In 2009, his wife filed suit against Elizabeth Creekmore Byrd, his former college sweetheart and alleged mistress. Mrs. Pickering alleged that her husband restarted his relationship with Byrd while he was &quot;a United States congressman prior to and while living in the well-known C Street Complex in Washington, D.C.&quot;

==C Street Center==
The Fellowship runs a three-story brick mansion in Washington D.C. known as &quot;C Street&quot; (133 C St SE). It is the former convent for nearby St. Peter&#x27;s Church. It is located a short distance from the United States Capitol. The structure has 12 bedrooms, nine bathrooms, five living rooms, four dining rooms, three offices, a kitchen, and a small &quot;chapel&quot;.

The facility houses mostly Republican members of Congress. The house is also the locale for:

* An annual Ambassador Luncheon
* Receptions for foreign dignitaries, including the prime minister of Australia Kevin Rudd

C Street has been the subject of controversy over its claimed tax status as a church, the ownership of the property and its connection to the Fellowship, and the reportedly subsidized benefits the facility provides to members of Congress.

==Property holdings==

===Arlington===
Fellowship Foundation purchased a large old house in 1978 in the Woodmont neighborhood of Arlington Virginia called &quot;The Doubleday Mansion&quot; (located at 2145 24th St N). Now called &quot;The Cedars&quot;, the 70-acre property, located less than 3 miles from the White House and which also has quarters for volunteers, a detached two-story garage and a gardener&#x27;s cottage, is zoned as a worship and teaching center. This property currently (and has for many years) serves as the headquarters for the organization.
The home is also used as a center for Bible studies, counseling, hymn sings, life mentoring, prayer groups, prayer breakfasts, luncheons, dinners, and hospitality receptions for international reconciliation and conflict resolution initiatives. The home was once surrounded by cedar trees and so was renamed &quot;The Cedars&quot; (or simply &quot;Cedars&quot;). It is a historic landmark house.

Coe has described Cedars as a place &quot;committed to the care of the underprivileged, even though it looks very wealthy.&quot; He noted that people might say, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you sell a chandelier and help poor people?&quot; Answering his own question, Coe said, &quot;The people who come here have tremendous influence over kids.&quot; Private documents indicate that Cedars was purchased so that &quot;people throughout the world who carry heavy responsibilities could meet in Washington to think together, plan together and pray together about personal and public problems and opportunities.&quot; Cedars hosts prayer breakfasts, luncheons and dinners for ambassadors, congressional representatives, foreign religious leaders and many others.

===Other Fellowship properties===
* &quot;19th Street House,&quot; a two-story, brick apartment building located in Washington DC at 859 19th Street NE, used for afterschool activities.

==Finances==
In 2007, The Fellowship Foundation received nearly $16.8 million to support 400 ministries.
