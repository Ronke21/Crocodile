<text>Arnos Grove () is a London Underground station located in Arnos Grove in the London Borough of Enfield, North London. It is on the Piccadilly line between Bounds Green and Southgate stations and is in Travelcard Zone 4. The station opened on 19 September 1932 as the most northerly station on the first section of the Piccadilly line extension from Finsbury Park to Cockfosters. It was the terminus of the line until services were further extended to Oakwood on 13 March 1933. When travelling from east of Barons Court and through Central London, Arnos Grove is the first surface station after the long tunnel section of the Piccadilly line. The station has four platforms which face three tracks.

The station was designed by architect Charles Holden, and has been described as a significant work of modern architecture. On 19 February 1971, the station was Grade II listed. In 2005, the station was refurbished with the heritage features also maintained. In July 2011 Arnos Grove&#x27;s listed status was upgraded to Grade II*. The station was awarded with the Best Newcomer and the Best Overall Garden in the Underground in Bloom 2011 competition and also in the London in Bloom competition.

==Location==
The station is located on A1110 Bowes Road, serving a medium-sized residential area. Arnos Grove is the first surface station after the long tunnel section which starts east of Barons Court and passes through Central London. The station and surrounding neighbourhood of Arnos Grove take their names from the Arnos Grove estate, which was to the north of the station. The station is part of the Arnos Grove group of stations, comprising all seven stations from Cockfosters to Turnpike Lane, and the management office for the group is in Arnos Grove station. Linked to the station by a lineside passageway is Ash House, which is a drivers&#x27; depot. Nearby attractions include Arnos Park, Broomfield School and Bowes Road Library. Arnos Grove is known for its circular ticket hall and as a quiet, peaceful and green neighbourhood until the 1960s. When the Piccadilly line extension came, Edwardian villas were built in the area.

==History==
The Great Northern Railway (GNR) and its successor, the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), for many years refused consent for any extension into the suburbs of Haringey and Enfield. In 1902, parliamentary approval was obtained to ban any further extensions of London Underground lines northwards from Finsbury Park. This created a bottleneck at Finsbury Park, back then the northern terminus of the Piccadilly line. By 1923, a public campaign against the 1902 parliamentary ban emerged, and Frank Pick had risen to assistant managing director of the Underground group. To help address this issue, Frank Pick gathered photographs of the congestion at Finsbury Park and distributed to the press. In 1925, the LNER gave in to the objection. Pick began working on the extension proposal and obtained parliamentary approval in 1929. The alignment was based on the absence of property development along the line. Funding was obtained from legislation under the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act 1929 instead of the Trade Facilities Act. Tunnel rings, cabling and concrete were produced in Northern England, while unemployed industrial workers there helped in the construction of the extension. 22 tunnelling shields were used during construction which started in 1930. The station was opened on 19 September 1932 as the terminus on the first section of the Piccadilly line extension to Cockfosters. The line was further extended to Oakwood on 13 March 1933. Its name was chosen after public deliberation: alternatives were &quot;Arnos Park&quot;, &quot;Bowes Road&quot; and &quot;Southgate&quot;.

===Incidents===
On the night of 13 October 1940, during the Blitz, a lone German aircraft dropped a single bomb on houses to the north of Bounds Green station. The destruction of the houses caused the north end of the westbound platform tunnel to collapse. As a result, train services between Wood Green and Cockfosters were disrupted for two months. On 11 August 1948, a passenger train was derailed when the front and rear bogies of a carriage took different routes at a set of points at the station. On 7 July 2005, a bomb exploded on a train travelling between King&#x27;s Cross St. Pancras and Russell Square. Train services between Hyde Park Corner and Arnos Grove were disrupted until 4 August of the same year.

==Station building==
Like the other stations Charles Holden designed for the extension, Arnos Grove was built in a modern European style using brick, glass and reinforced concrete and basic geometric shapes. A circular drum-like ticket hall of brick and glass panels rises from a low single-storey structure and is capped by a flat concrete slab roof. The design was said to be inspired by the Stockholm City Library and Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund, although Charles Hutton, Holden&#x27;s chief assistant stated Holden based the idea on a groundsman&#x27;s lodge at Midhurst Sanatorium designed by Adams, Holden, and Pearson in 1904–1906. The centre of the ticket hall is occupied by a disused ticket office (a passimeter in London Underground parlance) which houses an exhibition on the station and the line. The original design by Holden was detailed by Charles Hutton, who also had to amend the construction method from Sudbury Town tube station due to issues with leaking shuttering for the concrete roof discolouring the brickwork.

==The station today==

Three parallel train tracks pass through the station, with two double-sided platforms between the central track and the outer tracks. The edges of the platforms are labelled platform 1 and 2, and platform 3 and 4, in such a way that the two outer tracks are accessible from platforms 1 and 4, and the central track, usually used by trains that terminate and reverse at Arnos Grove station, is accessible from platforms 2 and 3. Platforms 1 and 2 are designated for trains to Cockfosters while platforms 3 and 4 are for trains to Central London.

When operating a shuttle service between Arnos Grove and Cockfosters, the central track is used exclusively as it has access to both running tracks to/from Southgate (the outer tracks don&#x27;t have this access).

In July 2011 Arnos Grove became a Grade II* listed building. The building is one of the 12 &quot;Great Modern Buildings&quot; profiled in The Guardian during October 2007. Arnos Grove Drivers&#x27; Depot won Best Newcomer and Best Overall Garden in the Underground in Bloom 2011 competition for their new project which also got them an award in the London in Bloom competition. Their website tells the whole story with photographs of the garden and the awards ceremonies.

===Station improvements===
In 2005 the station underwent a refurbishment programme including improvements to signage, security and train information systems. General repairs and redecoration were carried out, flooring was renewed, and better lighting, an improved CCTV security system and Help Points were installed, with the latter being suitable for people with limited hearing. Some of the original signs are in a &#x27;petit-serif&#x27; adaptation of the London Underground typeface, Johnston Delf Smith Sans. This typeface was designed by Charles Holden and Percy Delf Smith, a former pupil of Edward Johnston.

During the refurbishment programme, all these heritage features were maintained as well:
*The circular &#x27;Sudbury box&#x27; red brick building with overhanging crenellated concrete roof and vestibule to front and left-hand elevations
*Dark red brick walls extending to either side of building and also on bridge parapet wall and also on the other side of Bowes Road
*Bronze-framed silhouette roundels with reinstated 1930s graphics on concrete backing panels on brick walls at either end of bus slip road
*Flag pole mounted silhouette roundel with reinstated 1930s graphics on vestibule roof
*Full height windows

==Services and connections==
===Services===
A journey between Arnos Grove and Southgate typically takes slightly more than four minutes. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3–9 minutes between 07:07 and 01:07 eastbound, and every 2–6 minutes between 05:19 and 00:06 westbound. When operational problems occur on the line, Arnos Grove station may act as a temporary terminus of a reduced service – either a shuttle service between Arnos Grove and Cockfosters or a truncated service from Central London. The station has a set of seven sidings to its south for stabling trains.

===Connections===
London Buses routes 34, 184, 232, 251, 298, 382, SL1 and night route N91 serve the station.

New Southgate railway station is a ten-minute walk from Arnos Grove.

<text>Vātsyāyana was an ancient Indian philosopher, known for authoring the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot;. He lived in India during the second or third century CE, probably in Pataliputra (modern day Patna in Bihar). 

He is not to be confused with Pakṣilasvāmin Vātsyāyana, the author of &quot;Nyāya Sutra Bhāshya&quot;, the first preserved commentary on Gotama&#x27;s &quot;Nyāya Sutras&quot;. His name is sometimes erroneously confused with Mallanaga, the seer of the Asuras, to whom the origin of erotic science is attributed.

==Biography==

Hardly anything is known about Vātsyāyana from sources outside the &quot;Kāmasūtra&quot; itself. Vātsyāyana&#x27;s interest in refined human, including sexual, behavior as a means of fulfilment, was recorded in his treatise &quot;Kama Sutra&quot;.

At the close of the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; this is what he writes about himself:

After reading and considering the works of Babhravya and other ancient authors, and thinking over the meaning of the rules given by them, this treatise was composed, according to the precepts of the Holy Writ, for the benefit of the world, by Vatsyayana, while leading the life of a religious student at Benares, and wholly engaged in the contemplation of the Deity. This work is not to be used merely as an instrument for satisfying our desires. A person acquainted with the true principles of this science, who preserves his Dharma (virtue or religious merit), his Artha (worldly wealth) and his Kama (pleasure or sensual gratification), and who has regard to the customs of the people, is sure to obtain the mastery over his senses. In short, an intelligent and knowing person attending to Dharma and Artha and also to Kama, without becoming the slave of his passions, will obtain success in everything that he may do.

Some believe that he must have lived between the 1st and 6th century CE, on the following grounds: He mentions that Satakarni Satavahana, a king of Kuntala, killed Malayevati his wife with an instrument called Katari by striking her in the passion of love. Vatsyayana quotes this case to warn people of the danger arising from some old customs of striking women when under the influence of sexual passion. This king of Kuntal is believed to have lived and reigned, consequently Vatsyayana must have lived after him. On the other hand, another author, Varahamihira, in the eighteenth chapter of his &quot;Brihatsanhita&quot;, discusses of the science of love, and appears to have borrowed largely from Vatsyayana on the subject. Some believe that Varahamihira lived during the 6th century and therefore Vatsyayana must have written his works before the 6th century.

<text>Manuel José Quintana y Lorenzo (April 11, 1772 - March 11, 1857), was a Spanish poet and man of letters.

==Life==
He was born at Madrid. After completing his studies at Salamanca he was called to the bar. In 1801 Quintana produced a tragedy, &quot;El Duque de Viseo&quot;, founded on M. G. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Castle Spectre&quot;; his &quot;Pelayo&quot; (1805), written on a patriotic theme, was more successful.

The first volume of his &quot;Vidas de Españoles célebres&quot;, containing lives of Spanish patriots, stirred the public imagination and secured Quintana the post of secretary to the Cortes during the French invasion. His proclamations and odes fanned the national enthusiasm into flame. But he was ill rewarded for his services, for on the return of Ferdinand VII he was imprisoned at Pamplona from 1814 to 1820. He was finally given a small post in the civil service, became tutor to Queen Isabella II, and was nominated senator. Though publicly crowned as the representative poet of Spain (1855), he seems to have lived in poverty.

Quintana died at the age of 84. His poems, thirty-four in number, are inspired by philanthropy and patriotism; the style is occasionally gallicized, and the thought is not profound, but his nobility of sentiment and resounding rhetoric attract many generations of Spaniards.

<text>Last Call is a fantasy novel by American writer Tim Powers. It was published by William Morrow &amp; Co in 1992. It is the first book in a loose trilogy called &quot;Fault Lines&quot;: the second book, &quot;Expiration Date&quot; (1995), is vaguely related to &quot;Last Call&quot;, and the third book, &quot;Earthquake Weather&quot; (1997), acts as a sequel to the first two books.

==Plot summary==
The novel focuses on Scott Crane, a professional gambler and grieving middle-aged widower who is the son of Georges Leon, a powerful occultist and mobster. Decades earlier, Leon killed Bugsy Siegel to take over the latter&#x27;s rackets and assume the mantle of the Fisher King. Leon also uses a system of Tarot card sorcery to transfer his consciousness into other people&#x27;s bodies in an attempt to attain immortality, at the cost of turning the person into a mindless automaton. Leon began this magical rite with young Scott before the act was interrupted by Scott&#x27;s mother who shot and wounded Leon and hid Scott under an assumed identity. 

As an adult Scott realizes the events of his youth are unresolved and impacting his current life. He reconnects with his estranged foster father Ozzie and foster sister Diana to confront Leon. &quot;Last Call&quot; is set mostly in and around Los Angeles, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. 

Like many of Powers&#x27; novels, &quot;Last Call&quot; features a detailed magic system, here based on divinatory tarot, and draws on mythical or historical events and characters. Powers uses details of real-life mobster Bugsy Siegel life, and the development of Las Vegas casinos as well as the legend of the Fisher King. Powers also makes use of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot; throughout, which also features the Fisher King legend. 

Powers&#x27; self-imposed rules prohibit him from disregarding established historical facts and timelines, instead finding alternate supernatural explanations for real-world events which he incorporates into his fiction, a genre known as a &quot;secret history&quot;.

==Awards==
&quot;Last Call&quot; won the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel and the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel in 1993.

<text>West Island School (WIS; ) is a co-educational, private, international secondary school in Hong Kong which provides an English-language education to students of all abilities from age eleven to eighteen with a &quot;modern liberal education&quot; based on British-influenced international curricula. The campus is a purpose-built development located at 250 Victoria Road, on the slopes of Mount Davis on Hong Kong Island. Students from Years Seven to Nine study the West Island School Middle Years Diploma; students in Years Ten to Eleven follow either the IGCSE, or the MYP IB Middle Years Programme; and students in Years Twelve to Thirteen follow the IB Diploma curricula. The school is a member of the English Schools Foundation, and as such still receives a small but symbolic subvention from the Government that has been frozen since the 1997 Handover of Hong Kong.

==History==
West Island School, began when the English Schools Foundation recognised a need for a new school on Hong Kong Island in the late-1980s; after Island School and South Island School. This was because of the recent residential boom in Discovery Bay, which then had no secondary school to cater for the growing need of English language secondary school education on the outlying islands. After government approval of a site and funding in November 1990, plans for West Island School began in earnest, with the school operating as an offshoot of Island School at a temporary home; the old military hospital in Borrett Road, Mid-Levels.

West Island&#x27;s first intake was in September 1991, when eighty-four Year 7 students were enrolled in four classes. In the meantime, work progressed on a purpose-built school in Pokfulam, designed by award-winning architect Patrick Lau, who was responsible for two other international schools in Hong Kong, the Lycée Français International Victor Segalen in Tai Hang and the American Hong Kong International School in Tai Tam.

In September 1994, the new purpose-built building opened. This consisted of a ten-storey building consisting of three blocks: housing classrooms, laboratories, an auditorium and a 25-metre indoor pool, linked together by open-air walkways and air-conditioned faculty-corridors.

Over the years, renovations further increased the usability of the building, although by 2001 the school was getting rather crowded with over 1,000 students enrolled; paving the way for the creation of a fourth block. This new addition opened for use in September 2003.

==Curriculum==
The school offers secondary education from Years 7 to 13, for pupils aged 10–19. West Island School students follow the International General Certificate of Secondary Education program in Years 10-11 and pursue the IB Diploma and BTEC Extended Diploma in Years 12–13.

The schools also offers AS-Level courses for Year 10 students pursuing in the study of critical thinking and entrepreneurship. 
The grades achieved by West Island students in IGCSE and IB examinations place them generously above similar schools across the world. In 2011, around 60% of IGCSE passes were at A* or A.

West Island also offers extracurricular activities run by both staff and students. Furthermore, students also have the opportunity to compete with other teams from other international schools as well as local schools from across Hong Kong and the region.

West Island School also participates in sports, with the school&#x27;s track, swimming, field hockey, volleyball, martial arts, and netball teams placing well in HKSSF rankings. West Island School&#x27;s football team has participated in 4 HKSSF finals in the last 5 years, and won three gold medals. In 2011, the school won the BOCHK Bauhinia Bowl, as the highest ranked co-educational school in Hong Kong.

==School Council==
WIS is a member school of the English Schools Foundation. WIS is governed by the &quot;School Council&quot; composed of teachers, parents, and management staff.

<text>James Quin (24 February 1693 – 21 January 1766) was an English actor of Irish descent.

==Life==
Quin was born in King Street, Covent Garden, London, an illegitimate son of James Quin, an Irish-born barrister, and his partner (whom he apparently never lawfully married) Mrs. Grinsell. He was the grandson of Mark Quin, Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1667–8. William Whitshed, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, was his first cousin. He was educated in Dublin, and probably spent some time at Trinity College, Dublin. His grandfather, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, who caused a sensation by committing suicide in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin in 1674, supposedly because of his wife&#x27;s infidelity, was one of the richest men in Dublin. James unsuccessfully claimed a share of the family fortune, but he could not prove that his parents had been lawfully married, since his mother had a previous husband who was still alive.

Soon after his father&#x27;s death in 1710, he made his first appearance on the stage at Abel in Sir Robert Howard&#x27;s &quot;The Committee&quot; at the Smock Alley Theatre. Quin&#x27;s first London engagement was in small parts at Drury Lane, and he secured his first triumph at Bajazet in Nicholas Rowe&#x27;s &quot;Tamerlane&quot;, on 8 November 1715. The next year he appeared as Hotspur at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, where he remained for fourteen years.

On 10 July 1718, he was convicted of manslaughter for having killed William Bowen, another actor, in a duel which the victim had himself provoked. Quin was not severely punished, the affair being regarded as more of an accident than a crime. The public took a similar view of another episode in which Quin, on being attacked by a young actor who had been angered by the sarcastic criticism of his superior, drew his sword upon him and killed him.

He took leading roles in &quot;Othello&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot; with Anna Maria Seymour as leading actress.

But if he was eager in his own defence he was no less so in that of others. In 1721 a drunken nobleman reeled onto the stage of the theatre and assaulted the manager, Rich, whose life was saved by Quin&#x27;s prompt armed interference. This resulted in a riot, and thereafter a guard was stationed in all theatres. In 1732 Quin appeared at Covent Garden, returning to Drury Lane from 1734 to 1741, and in 1742 was again at Covent Garden, where he remained until the close of his career. On 14 November 1746 Quin played Horatio and Garrick Lothario to the Calista of Mrs Cibber in &quot;Rose&#x27;s Fair Penitent&quot;. The applause of the audience was so great as to disconcert if not actually to alarm the two actors.

Public interest was yet more keenly stimulated in comparing Garrick&#x27;s and Quin&#x27;s impersonations of Richard III, the popular verdict being loudly in favour of Garrick. But Quin&#x27;s Falstaff in &quot;King Henry IV&quot; was emphatically preferred to the Hotspur of his rival. In consequence of an attempt made by Garrick in 1750–51 to draw him away from Covent Garden, Quin was enabled to extort from his manager a salary of £1000 a year, the highest figure then reached in the profession. Quin&#x27;s last regular appearance was on 15 May 1757, as Horatio in the &quot;Fair Penitent&quot;, though in the following year he twice played Falstaff for the benefit of friends. He had retired to Bath, where he lived a happy life, with late hours and much eating and drinking, until his death on 21 January 1766. He was buried in the abbey church at Bath.

Some coolness which had arisen between Quin and Garrick before the former&#x27;s retirement was dissipated on their subsequent meeting at Chatsworth at the duke of Devonshire&#x27;s, and Quin paid many a visit to Garrick&#x27;s villa at Hampton in the latter part of his life. The epitaph in verse on his tomb was written by Garrick. Quin&#x27;s will displayed a generous nature, and among numerous bequests was one of fifty pounds to &quot;Mr Thomas Gainsborough, limner.&quot;

In the Garrick Club in London are two portraits of the actor ascribed to Hogarth, and a portrait by Gainsborough is in Buckingham Palace. His personality was not gracious. His jokes were coarse; his temper irascible; his love of food, his important airs, and his capacity for deep drinking do not command respect; on the other hand, a few of his jokes were excellent, and there was no rancour in him. On many occasions, he showed his willingness to help persons in distress. His character is summarised by Smollett in &quot;Humphry Clinker&quot;. As an actor his manner was charged with an excess of gravity and deliberation; his pauses were so portentous as in some situations to appear even ludicrous, but he was well fitted for the delivery of Milton&#x27;s poetry, and for the portrayal of the graver roles in his repertory.

<text>The International Portuguese Language Institute (, IILP) is the Community of Portuguese Language Countries&#x27;s institute supporting the spread and popularity of the Portuguese language in the world. The institute&#x27;s headquarters is located in Praia, Cabo Verde.

==History==
The institute is recent, and its statutes are still not well regulated. However, its history starts in 1989 when the countries of Portuguese language gathered in São Luís do Maranhão in Brazil to create a base for a Portuguese language community. The Brazilian president, José Sarney, proposed the idea of an international institute to promote the language. Only 10 years later in a meeting in São Tomé and Príncipe, a small island-nation in the Gulf of Guinea, the institute&#x27;s objectives, implementation and location (Cape Verde) were set.

The IILP&#x27;s fundamental objectives are &quot;the promotion, the defence, the enrichment and the spread of the Portuguese language as a vehicle of culture, education, information and access to scientific and technologic knowledge and of official use in international forums&quot;.

The members of the IILP are the member states of the &quot;Lusophone Commonwealth&quot; – the CPLP: Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, East Timor, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, São Tomé and Príncipe, and since 2014 Equatorial Guinea.

<text>Guldbollen (&quot;Golden Ball&quot;) is a Swedish football award given by &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; and the Swedish Football Association to the best male Swedish footballer each year.

==History==

The award was created by Bengt Liljedahl and between 1946 and 1965 it was awarded in cooperation with &quot;Stockholms-Tidningen&quot;.

The first Guldbollen award was given in 1946 to Gunnar Gren. In 1973, Bo Larsson of Malmö FF became the first player to win the award for a second time, having previously won it in 1965. Zlatan Ibrahimović is the only player to win the award more than twice, winning it twelve times between 2005 and 2020.

The female equivalent of the award, Diamantbollen, was established in 1990. Both Guldbollen and Diamantbollen are now awarded at the Fotbollsgalan.

<doc id="740817" wikidata="Q3001919" url="?curid=740817" title="Mathematical coincidence">
<text>A mathematical coincidence is said to occur when two expressions with no direct relationship show a near-equality which has no apparent theoretical explanation.

For example, there is a near-equality close to the round number 1000 between powers of 2 and powers of 10:
: formula_1

Some mathematical coincidences are used in engineering when one expression is taken as an approximation of another.

== Introduction ==
A mathematical coincidence often involves an integer, and the surprising feature is the fact that a real number arising in some context is considered by some standard as a &quot;close&quot; approximation to a small integer or to a multiple or power of ten, or more generally, to a rational number with a small denominator. Other kinds of mathematical coincidences, such as integers simultaneously satisfying multiple seemingly unrelated criteria or coincidences regarding units of measurement, may also be considered. In the class of those coincidences that are of a purely mathematical sort, some simply result from sometimes very deep mathematical facts, while others appear to come &#x27;out of the blue&#x27;.

Given the countably infinite number of ways of forming mathematical expressions using a finite number of symbols, the number of symbols used and the precision of approximate equality might be the most obvious way to assess mathematical coincidences; but there is no standard, and the strong law of small numbers is the sort of thing one has to appeal to with no formal opposing mathematical guidance. Beyond this, some sense of mathematical aesthetics could be invoked to adjudicate the value of a mathematical coincidence, and there are in fact exceptional cases of true mathematical significance (see Ramanujan&#x27;s constant below, which made it into print some years ago as a scientific April Fools&#x27; joke). All in all, though, they are generally to be considered for their curiosity value, or perhaps to encourage new mathematical learners at an elementary level.

== Some examples ==

=== Rational approximants ===
Sometimes simple rational approximations are exceptionally close to interesting irrational values. These are explainable in terms of large terms in the continued fraction representation of the irrational value, but further insight into why such improbably large terms occur is often not available.

Rational approximants (convergents of continued fractions) to ratios of logs of different numbers are often invoked as well, making coincidences between the powers of those numbers.

Many other coincidences are combinations of numbers that put them into the form that such rational approximants provide close relationships.

==== Concerning &quot;π&quot; ====
* The second convergent of &quot;π&quot;, [3; 7] = 22/7 = 3.1428..., was known to Archimedes, and is correct to about 0.04%. The fourth convergent of &quot;π&quot;, [3; 7, 15, 1] = 355/113 = 3.1415929..., found by Zu Chongzhi, is correct to six decimal places; this high accuracy comes about because π has an unusually large next term in its continued fraction representation: = [3; 7, 15, 1, 292, ...].
* A coincidence involving &quot;π&quot; and the golden ratio &quot;φ&quot; is given by formula_2. Consequently, the square on the middle-sized edge of a Kepler triangle is similar in perimeter to its circumcircle. Some believe one or the other of these coincidences is to be found in the Great Pyramid of Giza, but it is highly improbable that this was intentional.
* There is a sequence of six nines in pi beginning at the 762nd decimal place of its decimal representation. For a randomly chosen normal number, the probability of a particular sequence of six consecutive digits—of any type, not just a repeating one—to appear this early is 0.08%. Pi is conjectured, but not known, to be a normal number.
* The first Feigenbaum constant is approximately equal to formula_3, with an error of 0.0015%.

==== Concerning base 2 ====
* The coincidence formula_4, correct to 2.4%, relates to the rational approximation formula_5, or formula_6 to within 0.3%. This relationship is used in engineering, for example to approximate a factor of two in power as 3 dB (actual is 3.0103 dB – see Half-power point), or to relate a kibibyte to a kilobyte; see binary prefix. The same numerical coincidence is responsible for the near equality between one third of an octave and one tenth of a decade.
* The same coincidence can also be expressed as formula_7 (eliminating common factor of formula_8, so also correct to 2.4%), which corresponds to the rational approximation formula_9, or formula_10 (also to within 0.4%). This is invoked in preferred numbers in engineering, such as shutter speed settings on cameras, as approximations to powers of two (128, 256, 512) in the sequence of speeds 125, 250, 500, etc., and in the original &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; game show in the question values ...£16,000, £32,000, £64,000, £125,000, £250,000...

==== Concerning musical intervals ====

In music, the distances between notes (intervals) are measured as ratios of their frequencies, with near-rational ratios often sounding harmonious. In western twelve-tone equal temperament, the ratio between consecutive note frequencies is formula_11. 
* The coincidence formula_12, from formula_13, closely relates the interval of 7 semitones in equal temperament to a perfect fifth of just intonation: formula_14, correct to about 0.1%. The just fifth is the basis of Pythagorean tuning; the difference between twelve just fifths and seven octaves is the Pythagorean comma.
* The coincidence formula_15 permitted the development of meantone temperament, in which just perfect fifths (ratio formula_16) and major thirds (formula_17) are &quot;tempered&quot; so that four formula_16&#x27;s is approximately equal to formula_19, or a formula_17 major third up two octaves. The difference (formula_21) between these stacks of intervals is the syntonic comma.
* The coincidence formula_22 leads to the rational version of 12-TET, as noted by Johann Kirnberger.
* The coincidence formula_23 leads to the rational version of quarter-comma meantone temperament.
* The coincidence of powers of 2, above, leads to the approximation that three major thirds concatenate to an octave, formula_24. This and similar approximations in music are called dieses.

=== Numerical expressions ===

==== Concerning powers of &quot;π&quot; ====
* formula_25 correct to about 1.32%. This can be understood in terms of the formula for the zeta function formula_26 This coincidence was used in the design of slide rules, where the &quot;folded&quot; scales are folded on formula_27 rather than formula_28 because it is a more useful number and has the effect of folding the scales in about the same place.
* formula_29 correct to about 0.086%.
* formula_30 correct to 4 parts per million.
* formula_31 correct to 0.02%.
* formula_32 correct to about 0.002% and can be seen as a combination of the above coincidences.
* formula_33 or formula_34 accurate to 8 decimal places (due to Ramanujan: &quot;Quarterly Journal of Mathematics&quot;, XLV, 1914, pp. 350–372). Ramanujan states that this &quot;curious approximation&quot; to formula_27 was &quot;obtained empirically&quot; and has no connection with the theory developed in the remainder of the paper.
* Some near-equivalences, which hold to a high degree of accuracy, are not actually coincidences. For example,
*: formula_36
: The two sides of this expression differ only after the 42nd decimal place; this is not a coincidence.

==== Containing both &quot;π&quot; and &quot;e&quot; ====
* formula_37 to 4 digits, where γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant.
* formula_38, to about 7 decimal places. Equivalently, formula_39.
* formula_40, to about 4 decimal places.
* formula_41, to about 9 decimal places.
* formula_42 to about 4 decimal places. (Conway, Sloane, Plouffe, 1988); this is equivalent to formula_43 Once considered a textbook example of a mathematical coincidence, the fact that formula_44 is close to 20 is itself not a coincidence, although the approximation is an order of magnitude closer than would be expected. No explanation for the near-identity was known until 2023. It is a consequence of the infinite sum formula_45 resulting from the Jacobian theta functional identity. The first term of the sum is by far the largest, which gives the approximation formula_46 or formula_47 Using the estimate formula_48 then gives formula_49
* formula_50, within 4 parts per million.
* formula_51, to about 5 decimal places. That is, formula_52, within 0.0002%.
* formula_53, within 0.02%.
* formula_54. In fact, this generalizes to the approximate identity formula_55 which can be explained by the Jacobian theta functional identity.
* Ramanujan&#x27;s constant: formula_56, within formula_57, discovered in 1859 by Charles Hermite. This very close approximation is not a typical sort of &quot;accidental&quot; mathematical coincidence, where no mathematical explanation is known or expected to exist (as is the case for most). It is a consequence of the fact that 163 is a Heegner number.
* There are several integers formula_58 () such that formula_59 for some integer &quot;n&quot;, or equivalently formula_60 for the same formula_61 These are not strictly coincidental because they are related to both Ramanujan&#x27;s constant above and the Heegner numbers. For example, formula_62 so these integers &quot;k&quot; are near-squares or near-cubes and note the consistent forms for &quot;n&quot; = 18, 22, 37,
:formula_63
:formula_64
:formula_65 
with the last accurate to 14 or 15 decimal places.
* formula_66
* formula_67 is almost an integer, to about 8th decimal place.

*formula_99. This number, found in 2017, answers a question by John Conway whether the digits of a composite number could be the same as its prime factorization.

=== Numerical coincidences in numbers from the physical world ===

==== Speed of light ====
The speed of light is (by definition) exactly , extremely close to (). This is a pure coincidence, as the metre was originally defined as 1 / of the distance between the Earth&#x27;s pole and equator along the surface at sea level, and the Earth&#x27;s circumference just happens to be about 2/15 of a light-second. It is also roughly equal to one foot per nanosecond (the actual number is 0.9836 ft/ns).

==== Angular diameters of the Sun and the Moon ====
As seen from Earth, the angular diameter of the Sun varies between 31′27″ and 32′32″, while that of the Moon is between 29′20″ and 34′6″. The fact that the intervals overlap (the former interval is contained in the latter) is a coincidence, and has implications for the types of solar eclipses that can be observed from Earth.

==== Gravitational acceleration ====

While not constant but varying depending on latitude and altitude, the numerical value of the acceleration caused by Earth&#x27;s gravity on the surface lies between 9.74 and 9.87 m/s2, which is quite close to 10. This means that as a result of Newton&#x27;s second law, the weight of a kilogram of mass on Earth&#x27;s surface corresponds roughly to 10 newtons of force exerted on an object.

This is related to the aforementioned coincidence that the square of pi is close to 10. One of the early definitions of the metre was the length of a pendulum whose half swing had a period equal to one second. Since the period of the full swing of a pendulum is approximated by the equation below, algebra shows that if this definition was maintained, gravitational acceleration measured in metres per second per second would be exactly equal to &quot;π&quot;2.
: formula_100

The upper limit of gravity on Earth&#x27;s surface (9.87 m/s2) is equal to π2 m/s2 to four significant figures. It is approximately 0.6% greater than standard gravity (9.80665 m/s2).

==== Rydberg constant ====
The Rydberg constant, when multiplied by the speed of light and expressed as a frequency, is close to formula_101:
: formula_102
: formula_103

This is also approximately the number of feet in one meter:
: formula_104 ft formula_105 m

==== US customary to metric conversions ====
As discovered by Randall Munroe, a cubic mile is close to formula_106 cubic kilometres (within 0.5%). This means that a sphere with radius &quot;n&quot; kilometres has almost exactly the same volume as a cube with side length &quot;n&quot; miles.

The ratio of a mile to a kilometre is approximately the Golden ratio. As a consequence, a Fibonacci number of miles is approximately the next Fibonacci number of kilometres.

The ratio of a mile to a kilometre is also very close to formula_107 (within 0.006%). That is, formula_108 where &quot;m&quot; is the number of miles, &quot;k&quot; is the number of kilometres and &quot;e&quot; is Euler&#x27;s number.

A density of one ounce per cubic foot is very close to one kilogram per cubic metre: 1 oz/ft3 = 1 oz × 0.028349523125 kg/oz / (1 ft × 0.3048 m/ft)3 ≈ 1.0012 kg/m3.

The ratio between one troy ounce and one gram is approximately formula_109.

==== Fine-structure constant ====
The fine-structure constant formula_110 is close to, and was once conjectured to be precisely equal to . Its CODATA recommended value is
: formula_110 = 
formula_110 is a dimensionless physical constant, so this coincidence is not an artifact of the system of units being used.

==== Earth&#x27;s Solar Orbit ====
The number of seconds in one year, based on the Gregorian calendar, can be calculated by: formula_113

This value can be approximated by formula_114 or 31,415,926.54 with less than one percent of an error: formula_115

<doc id="740818" wikidata="Q1625476" url="?curid=740818" title="Siding (construction)">
<text>Siding or wall cladding is the protective material attached to the exterior side of a wall of a house or other building. Along with the roof, it forms the first line of defense against the elements, most importantly sun, rain/snow, heat and cold, thus creating a stable, more comfortable environment on the interior side. The siding material and style also can enhance or detract from the building&#x27;s beauty. There is a wide and expanding variety of materials to side with, both natural and artificial, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. Masonry walls as such do not require siding, but any wall can be sided. Walls that are internally framed, whether with wood, or steel I-beams, however, must always be sided.

Most siding consists of pieces of weather-resistant material that are smaller than the wall they cover, to allow for expansion and contraction of the materials due to moisture and temperature changes. There are various styles of joining the pieces, from board and batton, where the butt joints between panels is covered with a thin strip (usually 25 to 50 mm wide) of wood, to a variety of clapboard, also called lap siding, in which planks are laid horizontally across the wall starting from the bottom, and building up, the board below overlapped by the board above it. These techniques of joinery are designed to prevent water from entering the walls. Siding that does not consist of pieces joined would include stucco, which is widely used in the Southwestern United States. It is a plaster-like siding and is applied over a lattice, just like plaster. However, because of the lack of joints, it eventually cracks and is susceptible to water damage. &quot;Rainscreen&quot; construction is used to improve siding&#x27;s ability to keep walls dry.

==Wood siding==

Wood siding is very versatile in style and can be used on a wide variety of building structures. It can be painted or stained in any color palette desired.

Though installation and repair is relatively simple, wood siding requires more maintenance than other popular solutions, requiring treatment every four to nine years depending on the severity of the elements to which it is exposed. Ants and termites are a threat to many types of wood siding, such that extra treatment and maintenance that can significantly increase the cost in some pest-infested areas.

Wood is a moderately renewable resource and is biodegradable. However, most paints and stains used to treat wood are not environmentally friendly and can be toxic. Wood siding can provide some minor insulation and structural properties as compared to thinner cladding materials.

===Shingles===
Wood shingles or irregular cedar &quot;shake&quot; siding was used in early New England construction, and was revived in Shingle Style and Queen Anne style architecture in the late 19th century.

===Clapboards===
Wood siding in overlapping horizontal rows or &quot;courses&quot; is called clapboard, weatherboard (British English), or bevel siding which is made with beveled boards, thin at the top edge and thick at the butt.

In colonial North America, Eastern white pine was the most common material. Wood siding can also be made of naturally rot-resistant woods such as redwood or cedar.

===Drop siding===
Jointed horizontal siding (also called &quot;drop&quot; siding or novelty siding) may be shiplapped or tongue and grooved (though less common). Drop siding comes in a wide variety of face finishes, including Dutch Lap (also called German or Cove Lap) and log siding (milled with curve).

===Vertical boards===

Vertical siding may have a cover over the joint: board and batten, popular in American wooden Carpenter Gothic houses; or less commonly behind the joint called &quot;batten and board&quot; or &quot;reversed board and batten&quot;.

===Wooden sheet siding===
Plywood sheet siding is sometimes used on inexpensive buildings, sometimes with grooves to imitate vertical shiplap siding. One example of such grooved plywood siding is the type called Texture 1–11, &quot;T1-11&quot;, or &quot;T111&quot; (&quot;tee-one-eleven&quot;). There is also a product known as reverse board-and-batten &quot;RBB&quot; that looks similar but has deeper grooves. Some of these products may be thick enough and rated for structural applications if properly fastened to studs. Both T-11 and RBB sheets are quick and easy to install as long as they are installed with compatible flashing at butt joints.

==Stone siding==

Slate shingles may be simple in form but many buildings with slate siding are highly decorative.

==Plastic siding==
 Wood clapboard is often imitated using vinyl siding or uPVC weatherboarding. It is usually produced in units twice as high as clapboard. Plastic imitations of wood shingle and wood shakes also exist.

Since plastic siding is a manufactured product, it may come in unlimited color choices and styles. Historically vinyl sidings would fade, crack and buckle over time, requiring the siding to be replaced. However, newer vinyl options have improved and resist damage and wear better. Vinyl siding is sensitive to direct heat from grills, barbecues or other sources. Unlike wood, vinyl siding does not provide additional insulation for the building, unless an insulation material (e.g., foam) has been added to the product. It has also been criticized by some fire safety experts for its heat sensitivity. This sensitivity makes it easier for a house fire to jump to neighboring houses in comparison to materials such as brick, metal or masonry.

Vinyl siding has a potential environmental cost. While vinyl siding can be recycled, it cannot be burned (due to toxic dioxin gases that would be released). If dumped in a landfill, plastic siding does not break down quickly.

Vinyl siding is also considered one of the more unattractive siding choices by many. Although newer options and proper installation can eliminate this complaint, vinyl siding often has visible seam lines between panels and generally do not have the quality appearance of wood, brick, or masonry. The fading and cracking of older types of plastic siding compound this issue. In many areas of newer housing development, particularly in North America, entire neighbourhoods are often built with all houses clad in vinyl siding, given an unappealing uniformity. Some cities now campaign for house developers to incorporate varied types of siding during construction.

==Imitation brick or stone–asphalt siding==
 A predecessor to modern maintenance free sidings was asphalt brick siding. Asphalt impregnated panels (about ) give the appearance of brick or even stone. Many buildings have this siding, especially old sheds and garages. If the panels are straight and level and not damaged, the only indication that they are not real brick may be seen at the corner caps. Trademarked names included Insulbrick, Insulstone, Insulwood. Commonly used names now are faux brick, lick-it-and-stick-it brick, and ghetto brick. Often such siding is now covered with newer metal or plastic siding. Today thin panels of real brick are manufactured for veneer or siding.

==Insulated siding==
Insulated siding has emerged as a new siding category in recent years. Considered an improvement over vinyl siding, insulated siding is custom fit with expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) that is fused to the back of the siding, which fills the gap between the home and the siding.

Products provide environmental advantages by reducing energy use by up to 20 percent. On average, insulated siding products have an R-value of 3.96, triple that of other exterior cladding materials. Insulated siding products are typically Energy Star qualified, engineered in compliance with environmental standards set by the U.S. Department of Energy and the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

In addition to reducing energy consumption, insulated siding is a durable exterior product, designed to last more than 50 years, according to manufacturers. The foam provides rigidity for a more ding- and wind-resistant siding, maintaining a quality look for the life of the products. The foam backing also creates straighter lines when hung, providing a look more like that of wood siding, while remaining low maintenance.

Manufacturers report that insulated siding is permeable or &quot;breathable&quot;, allowing water vapor to escape, which can protect against rot, mold and mildew, and help maintain healthy indoor air quality.

==Metal siding==

Metal siding comes in a variety of metals, styles, and colors. It is most often associated with modern, industrial, and retro buildings. Utilitarian buildings often use corrugated galvanized steel sheet siding or cladding, which often has a coloured vinyl finish. Corrugated aluminium cladding is also common where a more durable finish is required, while also being lightweight for easy shaping and installing making it a popular metal siding choice.

Formerly, imitation wood clapboard was made of aluminium (aluminium siding). That role is typically played by vinyl siding today. Aluminium siding is ideal for homes in coastal areas with much moisture and salt, since aluminium reacts with air to form aluminium oxide, an extremely hard coating that seals the aluminium surface from further degradation. In contrast, steel forms rust, which can weaken the structure of the material, and corrosion-resistant coatings for steel, such as zinc, sometimes fail around the edges as years pass. However, an advantage of steel siding can be its dent-resistance, which is excellent for regions with severe storms—especially if the area is prone to hail.

 The first architectural application of aluminium was the mounting of a small grounding cap on the Washington Monument in 1884. Sheet-iron or steel clapboard siding units had been patented in 1903, and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company had been offering embossed steel siding in stone and brick patterns in their catalogues for several years by the 1930s. Alcoa began promoting the use of aluminium in architecture by the 1920s when it produced ornamental spandrel panels for the Cathedral of Learning and the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings in New York. The exterior of the A.O. Smith Corporation Building in Milwaukee was clad entirely in aluminium by 1930, and siding panels of Duralumin sheet from Alcoa sheathed an experimental exhibit house for the Architectural League of New York in 1931. Most architectural applications of aluminium in the 1930s were on a monumental scale, and it was another six years before it was put to use on residential construction.

In the first few years after World War II, manufacturers began developing and widely distributing aluminium siding. Among them Indiana businessman Frank Hoess was credited with the invention of the configuration seen on modern aluminium siding. His experiments began in 1937 with steel siding in imitation of wooden clapboards. Other types of sheet metal and steel siding on the market at the time presented problems with warping, creating openings through which water could enter, introducing rust. Hoess remedied this problem through the use of a locking joint, which was formed by small flap at the top of each panel that joined with a U-shaped flange on the lower edge of the previous panel thus forming a watertight horizontal seam. After he had received a patent for his siding in 1939, Hoess produced a small housing development of about forty-four houses covered in his clapboard-style steel siding for blue-collar workers in Chicago. His operations were curtailed when war plants commandeered the industry. In 1946 Hoess allied with Metal Building Products of Detroit, a corporation that promoted and sold Hoess siding of Alcoa aluminium. Their product was used on large housing projects in the northeast and was purportedly the siding of choice for a 1947 Pennsylvania development, the first subdivision to solely use aluminium siding. Products such as by unpainted aluminium panels, starter strips, corner pieces and specialized application clips were assembled in the Indiana shop of the Hoess brothers. Siding could be applied over conventional wooden clapboards, or it could be nailed to studs via special clips affixed to the top of each panel. Insulation was placed between studs. While the Hoess Brothers company continued to function for about twelve more years after the dissolution of the Metal Building Products Corporation in 1948, they were less successful than rising siding companies like Reynolds Metals.

==Thatch siding==

Thatch is an ancient and very widespread building material used on roofs and walls. Thatch siding is made with dry vegetation such as longstraw, water reeds, or combed wheat reed. The materials are overlapped and weaved in patterns designed to deflect and direct water.

== Masonry siding ==

 Stone and masonry veneer is sometimes considered &quot;siding&quot;, are varied and can accommodate a variety of styles—from formal to rustic. Though masonry can be painted or tinted to match many color palettes, it is most suited to neutral earth tones, and coatings such as roughcast and pebbeldash. Masonry has excellent durability (over 100 years), and minimal maintenance is required. The primary drawback to masonry siding is the initial cost.

Precipitation can threaten the structure of buildings, so it is important that the siding will be able to withstand the weather conditions in the local region. For rainy regions, exterior insulation finishing systems (EIFS) have been known to suffer underlying wood rot problems with excessive moisture exposure.

The environmental impact of masonry depends on the type of material used. In general, concrete and concrete based materials are intensive energy materials to produce. However, the long durability and minimal maintenance of masonry sidings mean that less energy is required over the life of the siding.

==Composite siding==

Various composite materials are also used for siding: asphalt shingles, asbestos, fiber cement, aluminium (ACM), fiberboard, hardboard, &quot;etc.&quot; They may be in the form of shingles or boards, in which case they are sometimes called clapboard.

Composite sidings are available in many styles and can mimic the other siding options. Composite materials are ideal for achieving a certain style or &#x27;look&#x27; that may not be suited to the local environment (e.g., corrugated aluminium siding in an area prone to severe storms; steel in coastal climates; wood siding in termite-infested regions).

Costs of composites tend to be lower than wood options, but vary widely as do installation, maintenance and repair requirements. Not surprisingly, the durability and environmental impact of composite sidings depends on the specific materials used in the manufacturing process.

Fiber cement siding is a class of composite siding that is usually made from a combination of cement, cellulose (wood), sand, and water. They are either coated or painted in the factory or installed and then painted after installation. Fiber cement is popular for its realistic look, durability, low-maintenance properties, fire resistance, and its lightweight properties compared to traditional wood siding. Composite siding products containing cellulose (wood fibers) have been shown to have problems with deterioration, delamination, or loss of coating adhesion in certain climates or under certain environmental conditions.

A younger class of non-wood synthetic siding has sprouted in the past 15 years. These products are usually made from a combination of non-wood materials such as polymeric resins, fiberglass, stone, sand, and fly ash and are chosen for their durability, curb appeal, and ease of maintenance. Given the newness of such technologies, product lifespan can only be estimated, varieties are limited, and distribution is sporadic.

<doc id="740819" wikidata="Q310719" url="?curid=740819" title="ISimangaliso Wetland Park">
<text>iSimangaliso Wetland Park is situated on the east coast of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, about north of Durban by road. It is South Africa&#x27;s third-largest protected area, spanning of coastline, from the Mozambican border in the north to Mapelane south of the Lake St. Lucia estuary, and made up of around of natural ecosystems, managed by the iSimangaliso Authority.

The park was previously known as the Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park, but was renamed on 1 November 2007. The word means &quot;a miracle&quot; or &quot;something wondrous&quot; in Zulu. The name came as a result of Shaka&#x27;s subject having been sent to the land of the Tsonga. When he came back he described the beauty that he saw as a miracle.

The park includes:
* Lake St. Lucia
* St. Lucia Game Reserve
* False Bay Park
* Kosi Bay
* Lake Eteza Nature Reserve
* Lake Sibhayi
* St. Lucia Marine Reserve
* St. Lucia Marine Sanctuary
* Sodwana Bay National Park
* Mapelane Nature Reserve
* Maputaland Marine Protected Area
* Cape Vidal
* Ozabeni
* Mfabeni
* Tewate Wilderness Area
* Mkuze Game Reserve

==Transfrontier parks==
The park is part of a transfrontier marine park, the Ponta do Ouro-Kosi Bay Transfrontier Conservation Area, straddling South Africa, Mozambique, and Eswatini. The marine conservation area is included in the Greater Lubombo Transfrontier Conservation Area.

==History==

Until 1895, the bay had been a home of the Tsonga people and their Tsonga fish kraal. This is the original and the natural home of the Tsonga people who lived here for more than 1000 years. Records from early Portuguese sailors correctly point out this area as well as areas further south to be occupied by the Tsonga people. The area was also known as Tembeland or Thongaland but the name fell into disuse around the early 1900s. The area was ruled by a Tsonga branch of the Vahlanganu (Tembe). The Swiss missionary, Reverend Henri-Alexandre Junod (known as HA Junod), conducted a scientific and ethnographic study of the Tsonga people during the early 1890s and produced a detailed map, showing the occupation of the bay by the Tsonga Tembe people. Junod showed in his map that the area was known as Tembeland and that the Tembe capital city was located in the St Lucia bay, and that by 1906, the Tsonga people occupied the land from St Lucia to Valdezia in the Spelenkon district of the Transvaal province, known today as Limpopo Province. St Lucia bay and Maputo Bay are one land and they belong to the Tsonga people, Tsonga villages were built from St Lucia bay until Maputo and they were not separated by any natural division. Around St Lucia, the ruling chief was the Tembe Royal Family, while around Maputo, the ruling class was the Maputo royal family, who are all of the Vahlanganu branch of the Tsonga people. In and around Maputo and St Lucia bay (Tembeland), the language spoken is Ronga, which according to the Swiss Missionary, Rev HA Junod, is not an independent language but a dialect of Xitsonga due to its similarity to it.


St. Lucia was first named in 1554 (alternatively — &quot;River of the Gold Dunes&quot;) by the survivors of the Portuguese ship &quot;Saint Benedict&quot;. At this stage, only the Tugela River mouth was known as St. Lucia. Later, in 1575, the Tugela River was named Tugela. On 13 December 1575, the day of the feast of Saint Lucy, Manuel Peresterello renamed the mouth area to Santa Lucia.
:In 1822, St. Lucia was proclaimed by the British as a township.
:In 1895, St. Lucia Game Reserve, north of the town was proclaimed.
:In 1971, St. Lucia Lake and the turtle beaches and coral reefs of Maputaland have been listed by the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar Convention).
:In December 1999, the park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site at an unveiling ceremony, where Nelson Mandela was the guest of honour.

==Biodiversity==

The park was proclaimed a world heritage site because of the rich biodiversity, unique ecosystems and natural beauty occurring in a relatively small area. The reason for the great diversity in fauna and flora is the great variety of different ecosystems on the park, ranging from coral reefs and sandy beaches to subtropical dune forests, savannas, and wetlands. Animals occurring on the park include elephant, leopard, black and southern white rhino, Cape buffalo, and in the ocean, whales, dolphins, and marine turtles including the leatherback and loggerhead turtles.

The park is also home to 1,200 crocodiles and 800 hippopotami.

In December 2013, after 44 years of absence, African lions were reintroduced to iSimangaliso.

There are large outcrops of underwater reefs which are home to brightly coloured fish and corals. Some of the most spectacular coral diversity in the world is located in Sodwana Bay, and octopus and squid species are common. Whale sharks are occasionally seen.

Twenty-four species of bivalve molluscs are recorded in St. Lucia Lake, which constitutes a considerable portion of the park.

<text>Erik Olof Mellberg (; born 3 September 1977) is a Swedish football manager and former professional player who is the manager of St. Louis City in Major League Soccer. 

During his career, Mellberg played as a defender, with his longest spell being at Premier League club Aston Villa. He also played in Sweden, Spain, Italy, Greece and Denmark, for clubs including Juventus and Olympiacos. 

Mellberg played for Sweden at the World Cup in 2002 and 2006, as well as the European Championship in 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012. A former captain of the national team, he scored eight goals in 117 caps between 2000 and 2012.

Mellberg began managing Brommapojkarna in 2015 and won two the third and second divisions in consecutive seasons before managing them in Allsvenskan in a later spell. He also led Helsingborg in his country&#x27;s top flight.

==Early years==
Erik Olof Mellberg was born in Gullspång, Sweden, on 3 September 1977 to parents Erik and Berit. Mellberg&#x27;s mother Berit was a physical education teacher who passed on her love of sport to her son. As a youth, Mellberg enjoyed playing tennis and dreamed of Wimbledon rather than the World Cup. Mellberg was something of a tennis prodigy and it was not until he was 14 that he began to focus on football.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Mellberg played for local side &quot;Gullspång&quot; before being picked up by Degerfors of the Allsvenskan. After being relegated, he joined capital club AIK, who won the league title in 1998. He then signed for Spanish club Racing de Santander, where he played regularly over three seasons, ending with relegation from La Liga in 2000–01.

===Aston Villa===
In July 2001, Mellberg signed a five-year contract with Aston Villa of England&#x27;s Premier League, for an estimated fee of £5 million. He made his debut on 18 August as the season began with a goalless draw away to Tottenham Hotspur, in which he blocked a shot by Les Ferdinand and headed a chance against the crossbar. On 27 September, he left on a stretcher with an ankle injury shortly before half time in a UEFA Cup first round elimination by NK Varteks of Croatia,

On 16 September 2002, in the Second City derby away to Birmingham City, Mellberg took a throw-in to his goalkeeper Peter Enckelman, and the ball rolled into the goal. Referee David Elleray ruled that Enckelman made light contact with the ball as it rolled in, thereby making it a valid goal as a goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in; Birmingham City won 3–0. Mellberg criticised the decision in an interview with Sweden&#x27;s &quot;Expressen&quot;. Mellberg scored his first goal for Villa on 26 October, a header against eventual champions Manchester United. 

In August 2003, Mellberg said that the atmosphere at the club was positive after David O&#x27;Leary came in as manager to replace Graham Taylor, who had dropped Juan Pablo Ángel and Alpay Özalan; he warned that some players would be disappointed to not be included in the season opener against Portsmouth. Mellberg himself was left out of that game, a 2–1 loss to the newly promoted side, and said that he was unhappy over what he saw as a lack of an explanation why. He was then made captain by the Irishman, as Villa finished 6th in the league.
On 12 December 2004, Villa lost the derby 2–1 at home to Birmingham City, in a match that Mellberg had attempted to build up by voicing his dislike of the opponents. Winning manager Steve Bruce said that Mellberg&#x27;s insults motivated his team. His season ended in April due to knee meniscus cartilage damage in a 3–0 win over Newcastle United. In 2005–06, he missed five games over March and April due to a recurring hamstring injury; Gary Cahill made a breakthrough in his absence.

In 2006, incoming manager Martin O&#x27;Neill took the captaincy from Mellberg and gave it to Gareth Barry, who had signed a new contract after coming close to leaving the club. On 19 August, in the first game of the season, Mellberg headed the opening goal of a 1–1 draw away to Arsenal – the first competitive goal at the Emirates Stadium.

In January 2008, Mellberg signed a pre-contract agreement for a three-year deal with Juventus, moving on a Bosman transfer once his contract expired at the end of the season. O&#x27;Neill praised Mellberg for having adapted to playing at right-back during the season. His final home game for Aston Villa was against Wigan Athletic on 3 May, being designated as Olof Mellberg Day in appreciation of his service to the club. On his final game for Aston Villa away at West Ham United, as a leaving gift, Mellberg gave each of the 3,200 Villa fans at Upton Park either a home or an away shirt with his name and number on the back and the message &quot;Thanks 4 Your Support&quot;.

===Juventus===

Mellberg made his debut for Juventus on 26 August 2008 in a UEFA Champions League third qualifying round second leg away to Artmedia Petržalka of Slovakia, a 1–1 draw after having been left on the bench for the 4–0 win in the first leg. On 18 January 2009, he scored his first goal in a 1–1 draw away to S.S. Lazio, adding a second on 21 March also at the Stadio Olimpico in a 4–1 win against A.S. Roma. He was a regular part of the team in his only season in Turin, as the club came runners-up in Serie A and reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia.

===Olympiacos===
On 23 June 2009, Mellberg moved to Olympiacos on a three-year contract for a fee of €2.5 million. He won Super League Greece in his second season, securing the title on 20 March 2011 with three games to spare after a 6–0 home win over rivals AEK Athens.

The club from Piraeus retained their title in 2011–12, again with three games remaining, once Panathinaikos&#x27;s points deduction for fan behaviour was upheld. Olympiacos also won the Greek Football Cup, with Mellberg scoring the only goal of the two-legged semi-final against OFI Crete in March. He turned down a new deal at the end of the 2011–12 season, hoping to find a new challenge with his agent saying &quot;we don&#x27;t close any doors.&quot;

===Villarreal===
On 8 August 2012, Mellberg signed a one-year contract with Spanish club Villarreal. Mellberg appeared 29 times for Villarreal in Spanish Segunda División, scoring twice, and was an important part of the squad that finished second in Segunda División and was promoted to La Liga.

===Copenhagen===
On 9 July 2013, Mellberg signed a two-year contract with Danish champions Copenhagen, but left after one season. He then retired.

==International career==
Mellberg made his debut against Austria in March 2000.

During an open team practice before the 2002 World Cup, Mellberg broke into a fight with his teammate Freddie Ljungberg after a robust tackle from Mellberg. The two of them were quickly separated by teammates. Since then, the two of them have been known for not being the best of friends, and in the 2006 World Cup, Mellberg and Ljungberg, according to leak from inside the team, had a very fiery argument, after Sweden&#x27;s draw with Trinidad and Tobago. In 2003, he was selected as the best Swedish player of the year, winning the Guldbollen.

During the penalty shoot-out after the Euro 2004 quarter-final against Netherlands, Mellberg has a penalty saved by Edwin van der Sar, as the Netherlands won the shoot-out 5–4 and advanced to the semi-finals.

During a 2006 FIFA World Cup Qualifying match against Croatia in October 2005, Mellberg boxed the ball away with his hand in the Swedish penalty area. Croatia were awarded a penalty kick for this, which Dario Srna scored, and Sweden lost the match 0–1. After the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, Mellberg relinquished his captaincy and Ljungberg took his place as Sweden captain.

On 4 September 2006, Mellberg, along with Zlatan Ibrahimović and Christian Wilhelmsson, was sent home from the national squad for breaking an 11 pm team curfew ahead of a European Championships qualifier against Liechtenstein. On 7 October, he returned to the lineup for their European Championships qualifier against Spain, which they won 2–0. In the 2012 European Championships, Mellberg was involved in two goals in their match against England in the group stages to give Sweden a 2–1 lead, however, Sweden went on to lose 2–3 while Mellberg became &quot;Man of the Match&quot;. After the tournament, Mellberg decided to end his international career.

==Style of play==
During his career, Mellberg primarily played as a central defender or right-back, although he was also capable of playing in a holding role in midfield on occasion. In a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; profile in the lead-up to Euro 2012, he was described as being &quot;big, strong and exceptional in the air&quot;, while a &quot;BBC&quot; profile ahead of the 2002 World Cup noted that &quot;[h]e pressures attackers superbly and rarely comes off second best in a challenge.&quot; Regarded as a promising defender in his youth, he later made a name for himself as a solid, dependable and hard-tackling centre-back. Although he was not very fast, he was strong, and had an excellent positional sense, and was also a good header of the ball, which made him a goal-threat on set-pieces.

==Managerial career==
Mellberg was appointed manager of Swedish club Brommapojkarna in November 2015, signing a two-year contract and taking over following their recent relegation to the third tier of Swedish football.

Brommapojkarna won the Division 1 title during Mellberg&#x27;s first season in charge and won their second successive promotion the following year, in October 2017, to return to the top flight, Allsvenskan. After the season, Mellberg chose not to renew his expiring contract with Brommapojkarna.

On 1 July 2019 Fremad Amager of the Danish 1st Division announced that Mellberg had joined the club as their new manager. After only two months in charge, he left to become the manager of Helsingborgs IF in the Allsvenskan. After the club were relegated in December 2020, he resigned with one year remaining of his contract.

Mellberg returned to Brommapojkarna in December 2019, as promotion-winning manager Christer Mattiasson had left for IK Sirius. In his first season back, the club finished in the relegation play-off place, but defeated Utsiktens BK 7–0 with all goals scored in the away first leg. 

On 26 November 2024, Mellberg was announced as the new head coach of Major League Soccer club St. Louis City. On his debut in the season opener on 23 February, the team drew 0–0 at home to Colorado Rapids.

==Personal life==
According to Mellberg&#x27;s mother, he wished to become a lawyer, but a career in professional football then became viable. In the same 2006 interview, she said that he intended to go to university after retiring, like his scientist brother.

Mellberg&#x27;s son John (born 2006) also became a professional defender.

<text>The Quick and the Dead is a 1995 American revisionist Western film directed by Sam Raimi, and starring Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe, and Leonardo DiCaprio. The screenplay was written by Simon Moore, but includes contributions from Joss Whedon. The story focuses on &quot;The Lady&quot; (Stone), a gunfighter who rides into the frontier town of Redemption, controlled by John Herod (Hackman). The Lady joins a deadly dueling competition in an attempt to exact revenge for her father&#x27;s death.

Simon Moore&#x27;s script was purchased by Sony Pictures Entertainment in May 1993, and actress Sharon Stone signed on as both star and co-producer. Development was fast tracked after director Sam Raimi&#x27;s hiring, and principal photography began in Old Tucson Studios in Arizona on November 21, 1993. The film was distributed by TriStar Pictures and was released in the United States on February 10, 1995, to a dismal box-office performance, receiving mixed reviews from critics. In later years, however, the film has earned critical praise, especially for the performances, direction, cinematography, and musical score, with some critics noting it as underrated in Raimi&#x27;s catalog.

==Plot==
In 1881, a gunslinger known as &quot;The Lady&quot; arrives in the Old West town of Redemption, which is ruled by a ruthless outlaw-turned-mayor named John Herod. Herod has announced a fast-draw single-elimination shooting tournament with a large cash prize for the winner. The rules stipulate that any contestant may challenge any other, no challenge can be refused, every contestant must fight once per day, and a fight continues until one contestant either yields or dies. The Lady announces her participation, insisting that she is only interested in the prize.

During the sign-up, Herod&#x27;s henchmen arrive with Cort, an exceptionally skilled gunfighter and a former member of their gang. Cort has renounced violence to become a preacher and refuses to participate in the tournament. Herod&#x27;s men attempt to lynch him, but The Lady shoots through the rope, freeing him. The Lady meets &quot;The Kid&quot;, a brash young man who believes Herod is his father and hopes to earn his respect by winning the tournament. She wakes up alone in The Kid&#x27;s bed, and notices some barrels of loose dynamite under it. 

In the first round, Herod kills Ace Hanlon, a braggart who tried to take credit for some of Herod&#x27;s kills as an outlaw. The Kid and The Lady easily defeat their opponents. Herod buys a cheap gun for Cort from The Kid and declares that he can only have one bullet at a time, to prevent him from shooting his way out of town. Despite his conversion, Cort reflexively draws when challenged and wins his first-round duel.

Before the second round, Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill him. Herod declares that all duels are now to the death and kills Cantrell. The Kid wins his second fight. Later, The Lady faces off with Eugene Dred after he molests the saloon owner&#x27;s young daughter, eventually killing him. Upset, she rides out of town.

Meanwhile, Cort duels a Native American gunslinger, Spotted Horse, but fails to kill him with the first shot and only finishes him off with a second bullet thrown by a spectator. Doc Wallace finds The Lady at a nearby cemetery and tells her that he recognizes her and knows why she is there. Flashbacks reveal that the Lady&#x27;s real name is Ellen. Her father was the marshal in Redemption until Herod&#x27;s gang invaded and lynched him. Herod gave Ellen a pistol and three shots to try to break the rope, but she accidentally killed her father, after which she fled town. Doc hands Ellen her father&#x27;s old badge and persuades her to help rid the town of Herod.

The following day, Ellen challenges Herod, but he has already accepted a challenge from The Kid. As Ellen and Cort are the only fighters left, Herod orders them to fight, threatening to kill them himself if they refuse. Herod urges The Kid to withdraw, but he refuses. He wounds Herod, but is fatally shot himself. Herod coldly refuses to take his hand as he dies, and afterward says it was never proven that he was The Kid&#x27;s father. When Cort and Ellen face off, Cort draws and fires on her, and Doc declares Ellen dead. Cort angrily demands to fight Herod immediately, but settles for dawn of the next day. That night, one of Herod&#x27;s men breaks Cort&#x27;s right hand. 

The next morning, Herod rebukes the henchman and kills him for harming Cort. Herod confesses that he is afraid of Cort, which is why he forced him to enter the tournament. As a matter of honor, he offers to fight Cort left-handed, but still instructs his henchmen to kill Cort if he wins. At the moment Herod draws, several buildings explode, including Herod&#x27;s house and the clock tower. Ellen emerges from the smoke and flames, having faked her death and planted The Kid&#x27;s dynamite with help from Cort and Doc. Cort kills Herod&#x27;s remaining henchmen while Ellen faces off against Herod, revealing her identity by throwing her father&#x27;s badge at his feet. Herod wounds Ellen, but she shoots him through the chest and finishes him off with a bullet to the eye. She tosses the badge to Cort and rides away, leaving him in charge of bringing law and order back to Redemption.

==Production==

===Development===
Writer Simon Moore finished his speculative script for &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; in late 1992, writing it as a &quot;homage&quot; to the spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone, particularly the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot; starring Clint Eastwood. The writer decided the lead character should be a female. &quot;When you introduce women into that kind of world, something very interesting happens and you have an interesting dynamic straight away,&quot; Moore commented. The names of the lead villain (Herod) and the town (Redemption) were intentional allusions to the Bible. Moore considered directing his own script as an independent film and shooting &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; on a $3–4 million budget in either Spain or Italy.

Sony Pictures Entertainment purchased Moore&#x27;s script in May 1993 and approached Sharon Stone, fresh off the success of &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, to star in the lead role in July 1993. Because Stone also signed on as co-producer, she had approval over the choice of director. Sam Raimi was hired to direct because Stone was impressed with his work on &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; (1992); she made it clear that if he was not hired, she would quit the project. Although Stone had mixed emotions on Raimi&#x27;s previous work, she believed in his ability to handle the campy tone of the film, feeling that &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; would be a perfect opportunity to &quot;stretch the limits of his technical and creative ability.&quot; Moore was also enthusiastic over Raimi&#x27;s hiring, based on his previous work with the &quot;Evil Dead&quot; film series.

When Sony began development of &quot;The Quick and the Dead,&quot; the studio commissioned a series of rewrites from Moore. The writer was eventually dismissed and replaced with John Sayles, who, according to Moore, was chosen because the studio didn&#x27;t like the semi-serious tone and instructed him towards &quot;making more of an American Old West film.&quot; Moore was rehired with filming to begin in three weeks because Sayles&#x27; script was approaching a 2.5-hour runtime. When rewriting the shooting script, Moore simply omitted Sayles&#x27; work without Sony noticing. A week before shooting, Sony considered the script good enough to shoot; Moore described the rewrites as &quot;a completely fucking pointless exercise.&quot;

===Filming===
Russell Crowe originally auditioned for a different role in the film before Sharon Stone asked that the actor try for the lead male role. &quot;When I saw &quot;Romper Stomper&quot; (1992), I thought Russell was not only charismatic, attractive and talented, but also fearless,&quot; Stone reasoned. &quot;And I find fearlessness very attractive. I was convinced I wouldn&#x27;t scare him.&quot; Raimi found Crowe to be &quot;bold and challenging. He reminds me of what we imagine the American cowboy to have been like.&quot; On working with Raimi, Crowe later described the director as &quot;sort of like the fourth Stooge.&quot;
Sony Pictures was dubious over Stone&#x27;s choice of Crowe because he was unknown to American audiences in the mid-1990s. To cast Gene Hackman in the role of Herod, TriStar Pictures changed the shooting location from Durango, Mexico to Tucson, Arizona. Matt Damon was offered the role of Fee &quot;The Kid&quot; Herod, but declined. Sam Rockwell also auditioned for The Kid, a role which ended up going to Leonardo DiCaprio. Sony was also hesitant about the inexperienced DiCaprio&#x27;s casting; Stone compromised by paying his salary out of her own pocket.

Filming was originally set to begin in October 1993, but was delayed because Crowe needed to finish a prior commitment in Australia. Principal photography for &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; lasted from November 21, 1993, to February 27, 1994. Locations included Old Tucson Studios in Arizona and Mescal, southeast of Tucson. Production was briefly halted at times over weather problems. Thell Reed, who was hired as the gun coach and weapons master, worked with the cast through over three months of training. To age Cort&#x27;s Colt 1851 Navy Revolver and the other guns used, Reed experimented with simple measures. &quot;I took them out by my swimming pool and dipped them in chlorine water to let them rust,&quot; he explained. &quot;They looked rusty and old, but were brand new guns.&quot; Such detail, including the nickel plating and ivory handles on Ellen&#x27;s Colt Peacemakers, was accurate to the time period.

The town of Redemption was designed by Patrizia von Brandenstein, known for her work on &quot;Amadeus&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1987). Raimi&#x27;s first choice as the visual effects supervisor was William Mesa, his collaborator on &quot;Darkman&quot; (1990) and &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; (1992). Instead, Sony chose The Computer Film Company to create the VFX sequences. Pick-up scenes took place through November - December 1994. This included an extended duel between Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman.

Stone had a love scene with Crowe removed from the final cut of &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; before the film&#x27;s release in the United States. The actress/co-producer thought the scene did not fit in with the picture&#x27;s established reality. It was included in overseas releases of the film, both theatrically and on home media.

===Soundtrack===
The original motion-picture soundtrack for &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; was released by the Varèse Sarabande music label on February 14, 1995. The score for the film was composed and conducted by Alan Silvestri and mixed by Dennis Sands. Kenneth Karman and Thomas Drescher edited the film&#x27;s music.

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; was released in the U.S. and Canada on February 10, 1995, in 2,158 theaters, earning $6,515,861 in its opening weekend, placing second at the US box office behind &quot;Billy Madison&quot; by $124,000. The film eventually grossed $18,636,537 at the US and Canadian box office. Writer Simon Moore noted that the film performed modestly in Europe. The movie grossed $28 million outside the United States and Canada, for a worldwide gross of $47 million.

Director Sam Raimi described &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; as a pivotal but challenging experience. In a May 2009 interview with Empire, he admitted, &quot;I had a tremendous amount to learn about directing actors,&quot; realizing he’d often treated them as &quot;props to move about.&quot; Working with stars like Gene Hackman and Sharon Stone pushed him to evolve. On his bold visual style, he reflected, &quot;I felt my style didn&#x27;t help make it into a great picture.&quot;
Previously, Raimi confessed feeling lost after the film: &quot;I was very confused. For a number of years, I thought, ‘I&#x27;m like a dinosaur.’ I couldn&#x27;t change with the material.&quot; 
 TriStar Pictures also showed &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; as an &quot;out-of-competition&quot; film at the May 1995 Cannes Film Festival. Additionally, Stone was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Actress, but lost to Angela Bassett in &quot;Strange Days&quot;. A novelization written by Jack Curtis was published by HarperCollins in September 1995. The Region 1 DVD release came in September 1998.

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; received mixed reviews from film critics. Based on 41 reviews, Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 56%, with an average rating of 6.00/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;&quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; isn&#x27;t quite the draw that its intriguing premise and pedigree suggest, but fans of nontraditional Westerns should have some rootin&#x27;, tootin&#x27; fun.&quot; Metacritic calculated an average score of 49/100, based on 21 reviews.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Stone&#x27;s performance and Raimi&#x27;s directing. &quot;Stone&#x27;s presence nicely underscores the genre-bending tactics of Raimi, the cult filmmaker now doing his best to reinvent the B movie in a spirit of self-referential glee.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; criticized the film for being overtly clichéd, but praised Raimi&#x27;s direction and Dante Spinotti&#x27;s cinematography. Critic and Raimi biographer Bill Warren wrote that the film &quot;is a very conscious (though not self-conscious) attempt to recreate some of the themes, style, and appeal of Sergio Leone&#x27;s majestically operatic spaghetti Westerns of the 1960s, especially the&quot; Man with No Name&quot; trilogy that starred Clint Eastwood. It&#x27;s brisker, more romantic, and somehow more American than Leone&#x27;s movies.&quot;

Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; observed, &quot;Raimi tries to do a Sergio Leone, and though &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; is highly enjoyable in spots, it doesn&#x27;t come across as very convincing, perhaps because nothing can turn Sharon Stone into Charles Bronson.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt that &quot;&quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; plays like a crazed compilation of highlights from famous Westerns. Raimi finds the right look, but misses the heartbeat. You leave the film dazed instead of dazzled, as if an expert marksman had drawn his gun, only to shoot himself in the foot.&quot;

===Critical reassessment===
Although having a mixed critical reception upon release, &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; has received praise from Sam Raimi fans. Tom Reimann of &quot; Collider&quot; considers the film as one of Raimi&#x27;s best movies: &quot;The movie is so unabashedly bonkers that it’s impossible not to have a good time.&quot; Scott Hallam of &quot;Dread Central&quot; praised Raimi&#x27;s directing and versatility in multiple genres of film and the cast. Jay Royston of WhatCulture.com praised the film and considered it one of Raimi&#x27;s finest movies by saying, &quot;...I have to put it in the top three Raimi movies, maybe because it is so unlike other Raimi films, yet combines all three of the best qualities of a director already mentioned; working with actors, innovating camera shots, and telling a good story visually.&quot; Bill Gibron of &quot;PopMatters&quot; said, &quot;This was the geek breaking point for many a certified Raimaniac. First off, it was a Western in the days when the genre was more or less struggling for life. In addition, it starred a yet to be hot Leonardo DiCaprio, a question mark named Russell Crowe, and the sexually inert Sharon Stone. About the only thing it had going for it was Raimi&#x27;s manic direction, and even that seemed...showy. Still, in retrospect, this is a good film, undermined by forces outside itself.&quot; Matt Schimkowitz of AVClub also praised the film: &quot;With a cast like that, it’s expected, but it’s never been this stylish, original, and fun. Ben Travis of Empire ranked it as the third best movie of Raimi: &quot;It’s a real sharp-shooter, an ultra-stylish shootout spectacular with a top cast, and some of his most creative camerawork.&quot;

Richard Schertzer of MovieWeb considered the film as one of Raimi&#x27;s best films: &quot;With its energy, a subversive female lead from Stone, and its surprising violence, The Quick and the Dead makes for a strong entry in his repertoire as a filmmaker and a wondrous first time western for him.&quot; Patrick Philips from &quot;Looper&quot; also praised the movie and considered it a &quot;cult classic&quot;: &quot;Of all the films on Sam Raimi&#x27;s delightfully left-of-center resume, this is the one that deserves to be rediscovered by the cinematic world — if only via midnight screenings.&quot; BJ Colangelo of &quot;/Film&quot; also praised the movie and considered it one of Raimi’s most underrated films: &quot;There are enough dutch angle dolly zooms in this film to make someone feel disoriented, but it works. &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; has the heart of a classic Western, but revamped for modern audiences with snappier taste.&quot; Film critic Adrian Martin remarked, &quot;Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; is a feminist Western starring a gun-toting Sharon Stone. [There is] a terrific scene where Lady goes berserk and challenges a guy who has just sexually abused the teenage daughter of the sad saloonkeeper. Raimi takes us straight from Stone’s split-second outburst of recognition to the sight of her racing forward in the pelting rain, both guns firing in righteous fury, screaming from the depths of her soul. Leone himself couldn’t have done that bit any better&quot;.

<text>Johannes Aal (c. 1500 – 28 May 1553) was a Swiss Roman Catholic theologian, composer and dramaturg.

Aal was born in Bremgarten, Switzerland, and was pastor there until 1529. Then, he became &quot;Leutpriester&quot; in Baden until 1536. At the collegiate church of Solothurn, he became preacher and choir leader in 1538. From 1544 to 1551, he was provost of the college of canons, where he died.

He is the author of the tragedy &quot;Johannes der Täufer (St. John Baptist)&quot; in which it was first performed in 1549 in Bern. The piece has a duration of two days with four acts each. It includes burlesques, romantic scenes, and satirical elements. Its satire derides all classes and the court as well as curiosity, passion for finery, loquacity and the art of seduction of women.

As a musician, he composed a tune in 16 verses on Saint Maurice and Saint Ursus of Solothurn.

==Plot==
Sixteen-year-old Guillermo (Israel Rodríguez) does not exactly hide his sexual orientation, even though his parents disapprove of it. He also seduces his English language tutor who introduces him to the pleasures of anal sex, and moves on to frequently cruise the toilets of the local mall for gay sex, getting caught once by mall security guards. As a consequence of that incident, his parents learn of his activities, and take him to a mental health therapist, who pronounces Guillermo to be mentally healthy and in no need of conversion therapy but recommends further sessions for his parents to help them accept their son&#x27;s sexual identity.

This short film was shown on British television network Channel 4. It is included in the gay and lesbian short film collection &quot;Boys Briefs 2&quot;.

==Awards==
The movie won two Caja de Madrid awards at the short film festival ALCINE (Festival de Cine de Alcalá de Henares) in Alcalá de Henares in 2000, one for Best Male Actor (Israel Rodríguez) and another for Social Values.
At the festival Madridimagen it won the prize for the best short in the same year.

<doc id="740837" wikidata="Q51112" url="?curid=740837" title="Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II">
<text>The Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II (; ) is Italy&#x27;s oldest active shopping gallery and a major landmark of Milan. Housed within a four-story double arcade in the centre of town, the &quot;Galleria&quot; is named after Victor Emmanuel II, the first king of the Kingdom of Italy. It was designed in 1861 and built by architect Giuseppe Mengoni between 1865 and 1877.

==Architecture==

The structure consists of two glass-vaulted arcades intersecting in an octagon covering the street connecting Piazza del Duomo to Piazza della Scala. The street is covered by an arching glass and cast iron roof, a popular design for 19th-century arcades, such as the Burlington Arcade in London, which was the prototype for larger glazed shopping arcades, beginning with the Saint-Hubert Gallery in Brussels (opened in 1847), the Passazh in St Petersburg (opened in 1848), the Galleria Umberto I in Naples (opened in 1890), and the Budapest Galleria.

The central octagonal space is topped with a glass dome. The Milanese &quot;Galleria&quot; was larger in scale than its predecessors and was an important step in the evolution of the modern glazed and enclosed shopping mall, of which it was the direct progenitor. It has inspired the use of the term &quot;galleria&quot; for many other shopping arcades and malls. 

On the ground of the central octagonal, there are four mosaics portraying the coat of arms of the three capitals of the Kingdom of Italy (Turin, Florence and Rome) plus Milan&#x27;s. Tradition says that if a person spins around three times with a heel on the testicles of the bull from Turin coat of arms this will bring good luck. This practice causes damage to the mosaic: a hole developed on the place of the bull&#x27;s genitals.

The Galleria connects two of Milan&#x27;s most famous landmarks: The Duomo and the Teatro Alla Scala, but the Galleria is a landmark in its own right.

== The iron-and-glass roof ==

The Milan gallery and its roof have been acknowledged as an important reference on 19th-century iron-and-glass architecture by Pevsner and Hitchcock. As one can still observe today, the roof consists of four barrel vaults (approximately 14.5 m in width and 8.5 m in height) that are crowned with a huge dome (around 37.5 m as internal diameter and 17.10 m in height). Jorini pointed out the accomplishments of this dome with special regard to the large dimensions. Each of the roof parts is topped with a lantern.
According to Geist, the Milan gallery and the roof were unprecedented in dimensions by previously built shopping arcades. Another difference with already existing passages, was the monumental character of the roof at Milan. Jodice, for example, appreciated the monumental spatial effect of the dome. In comparison to earlier emblematic arcades, such as Galerie d&#x27;Orléans (1828–1829) and Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert (1845–1847), the Milan arcade was also special because of the large spans of the vaults and the ethereal effect of the entire glass canopy. The construction of the whole Gallery was the result of international collaboration. This especially concerned the roof: the ironwork was produced, transported and installed by the French Atelier Henry Joret. The glass plates were made of flat ribbed glass by Saint-Gobain. The construction technology of the roof employs primary wrought-iron arches in order to support the glazing. By contrast, arcades that were built earlier were smaller and had simpler roofs: the same components were used for both load bearing and glazing purposes. In addition, the roof at Milan was equipped with invisible reinforcements in the supporting walls. This complicated roof is discussed as the unity of four systems that were skillfully combined through characteristic construction details. This construction technology was creative for avoiding visible tie-rods in the spans of the vaults and the dome, for a special effect of the glass plates and for the glazing bars.

The historical roof was heavily damaged during the aerial bombings of World War II. Before that the roof had undergone multiple maintenance interventions. Serious problems in the roof were reported in the 1970s, and some of them were solved in the 1980s. The roof that we see today has gone through different historic modifications and represents complicated conservation issues. In 2015, in preparation for Expo Milano 2015, the facades, statues, and mosaics underwent detailed cleaning and repair, using a giant moving crane scaffolding system. 

==Shops, restaurants and hotels==

The Galleria is often nicknamed &quot;&quot; (Milan&#x27;s drawing room), due to its numerous shops and importance as a common Milanese meeting and dining place.

As of 2013, the arcade principally contains luxury retailers selling haute couture, jewelry, books and paintings, as well as restaurants, cafés, bars, and a hotel, the Town House Galleria. The Galleria is famous for being home to some of the oldest shops and restaurants in Milan, such as Biffi Caffè (founded in 1867 by Paolo Biffi, pastry chef to the monarch), the Savini restaurant, Borsalino hat-shop (1883) and the Art Nouveau classic Camparino.

<text>Aneta Langerová (born 26 November 1986) is a Czech pop singer. Born in Benešov, Czech Republic and grew up in Říčany, she first rose to fame at age 17 as the first winner of &quot;Česko hledá SuperStar&quot;, the Czech version of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, in June 2004. Later that year she released her first album, &quot;Spousta andělů&quot;, which became a long-term bestseller in the Czech Republic. She has since released two further albums and is currently one of the most popular musical artists in the Czech Republic.

In 2005 and 2006, she ranked first in the category &#x27;Best Female Singer&#x27; in the Czech music poll Český slavík. In 2004, 2007 and 2012 she placed first in the same category of the Anděl Awards, organized by the &quot;Czech Academy of Popular Music&quot;.

She finished in second place in the Czech version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; - &quot;StarDance&quot; in 2010.

== Biography ==
Langerová grew up in Říčany, a town in the Central Bohemian Region. At age six, she began studying piano, and at age eight, she began taking guitar classes and singing in a choir with a local choir instructor. Langerová has credited her mother, who played piano and guitar around her house when she was growing up, with nurturing her musical talent.

In her teenage years, Langerová became more serious about music. At age 14, Langerová joined a local band called SPB in Sázava and then participated in and won several small TV talent contests (the Doremi TV competition and the Star Starters (in Czech: &quot;Rozjezdy pro hvězdy&quot;) contest) before participating in the first season of &quot;Česko hledá SuperStar,&quot; a popular Czech television show based on the &quot;Pop Idol&quot; format.

Langerová won the &quot;Česko hledá SuperStar&quot; competition with a 79 percent vote share in June 2004. In the course of the next three months, she quickly recorded her first album, &quot;Spousta andělů&quot; (Many Angels), composed of songs written by professional pop songwriters. The album enjoyed chart success in the Czech Republic, remaining at the top for 11 weeks in 2005. In 2005 and 2006, Langerová toured, released a live album and DVD and was closely involved with the Světluška Foundation, a charitable organization that works with blind children. Langerová played multiple benefit concerts for the organization and released a single, &quot;Píseň pro světlušku&quot; (Song for Světluška, &quot;firefly&quot; in Czech), to raise money for the group.

In 2007, Langerová released her second studio album, &quot;Dotyk&quot; (Contact), which showed her abilities beyond singing: she wrote or co-wrote all of the songs on the album and played guitar, piano, and bass on several tracks.

In 2017, she starred in a Czech Television film titled &quot;8 hlav sílenství&quot; (&quot;8 Heads of Madness&quot;), portraying Soviet poet and gulag survivor Anna Barkova. The film is mainly about her life in the camps and the women she loved.

== Personal life ==
Langerová is openly lesbian.

<text>The HP-10B (F1636A) is a student business calculator introduced in 1987. The model of this calculator proved to compete well with the higher end RPN HP-12C.

Two versions of the 10B were produced, the first version came with orange lettering around the keys and used an 1LU7 HP Saturn processor, the later model (in 2000) with teal-green labels. The functionality of the two versions appears to be identical.

The successor HP 10BII (F1902A), which was introduced in 2001, has both cosmetic and architectural changes from its predecessor. It uses a different CPU based on the Hitachi H8 architecture. The calculator&#x27;s firmware is not a perfect replica of the overall HP10B functionality. For instance, the keyboard layout is different, with two separate shift keys, and the available numbered-storage registers is reduced from 15 to 10. Early production runs were of poor quality; newer calculators have apparently solved this shortcoming.

The 10BII was released in two cosmetic variants. The first in 2001, branded as &quot;10BII&quot;, had a golden bezel and mauve statistical shift button and key labels. The second in 2007, branded as &quot;10bII&quot;, had a silver bezel and blue statistical shift button and key labels. As with the cosmetic variants of the original 10B, these two variants also appear to have identical functionality.

In 2011, the 10bII was replaced by the HP 10bII+ (NW239AA) model 1 (codenamed &quot;Bluestar&quot;) with expanded capabilities. This model offers two modes of input logic, chain input which evaluates operators strictly in the order in which they are entered, and algebraic input which observes PEMDAS operator precedence. Chain input is backwards compatible with the previous models of the series. It added new financial functions such as bonds, break-even, and deprecation functions. Several additional scientific functions were also added, such as trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, their inverses, and several additional statistical regression models. The 10bII+ uses a flashable Atmel AT91SAM7L128 processor with ARM7TDMI core.

In 2015, the internal hardware of the HP 10bII+ changed to use an Atmel ATSAM4LC2CA processor with ARM Cortex-M4 core. The part number and physical appearance of model 2 didn&#x27;t change except for a &quot;Rev 2&quot; plate on the bottom side. The serial numbers of the new model start with &quot;PHA&quot;. The 2×3-pin flash port now uses the USB protocol instead of a TTL serial protocol.

None of the five models supports RPN.

Starting off his career with Malmö FF in the late 1980s, he went on to play professionally in England, Germany, and Spain, and won the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League with Bayern Munich. He returned to Malmö in 2004, before retiring the following season.

A full international between 1992 and 2002, he won 96 caps for the Sweden national team and was a part of the Sweden team that finished third at the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He also played at the 1992 Summer Olympics, UEFA Euro 1992, UEFA Euro 2000, and was a squad player at the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

He was awarded Guldbollen as the Sweden&#x27;s best footballer of the year in 1995 and 2001.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in Bjärred, Andersson began his career with the local club, Bjärreds IF. In 1988, he moved on to Allsvenskan club Malmö FF.

===Blackburn Rovers===
In December 1992, Andersson went professional as he moved to Blackburn Rovers for a fee of £800,000, where he stayed for one year, making just 12 Premier League appearances. However, he is notable for being one of the first foreign signings by Blackburn Rovers, and one of the relatively small group of foreigners who appeared in the first season of the new Premier League in England. He scored once for Blackburn, in a 2–1 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday in the second leg of the 1992–93 Football League Cup semi-final.

===Borussia Mönchengladbach===
His next step was to go to Germany in October 1993 and play for Borussia Mönchengladbach. There, he won the DFB-Pokal with the team in 1995, but left the team, as its performance deteriorated, in 1999.

===Bayern Munich===
In June 1999, Andersson signed for Bayern Munich for approximately DM 6 million. He made his debut on 22 August 1999 in a 2–0 away defeat to Bayer Leverkusen. His time with Bayern resulted in two Bundesliga championships (in the 2000–01 championship season he scored the final and decisive goal against Hamburger SV in the last minute – his only goal for the club) as well as a DFB-Pokal and victory in the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League, despite missing his penalty in the final shootout.

===Barcelona===

Andersson moved to La Liga giants Barcelona in 2001 and spent three injury-plagued seasons there. Therefore, he played only 19 league matches for the &quot;Blaugrana&quot;.

===Return to Malmö===
For the 2004 season, Andersson came back to Malmö to play in the Swedish league again after ten years. That year, he captained Malmö, who won their first Swedish league (Allsvenskan) title in 15 years. He has twice been awarded Guldbollen as the Swedish footballer of the year, in 1995 and 2001. After suffering yet another knee injury during a Champions League qualifier against Swiss team Thun on 10 August 2005, Andersson announced his retirement from professional football on 12 August 2005.

==International career==
Andersson earned a total of 96 caps for the Sweden national team, scoring three goals. He won a bronze medal in the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Andersson also played in the team that reached the semi-finals at UEFA Euro 1992. He was on the Sweden national squad in Euro 2000, the 2002 FIFA World Cup and was a member of the Sweden squad at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. At Euro 2000, he received a red card for a hard foul on Belgium&#x27;s Bart Goor. At the 2002 World Cup, in Sweden&#x27;s last training session before their opening match against England, Andersson was injured and was not able to play in the tournament. He was replaced by Andreas Jakobsson.

== Post-playing career ==
He was appointed as Manchester United&#x27;s scout in Scandinavia in August 2010. He left the club after one year.

== Personal life ==
Andersson is the son of Roy Andersson, who played more than 300 games for Malmö and won 20 caps for the Sweden national team, representing them at the 1978 FIFA World Cup. His brother is Daniel Andersson, also a former professional footballer and Sweden international.

<text>The HP 38G (F1200A, F1892A) is a programmable graphing calculator by Hewlett-Packard (HP). It was introduced in 1995 with a suggested retail price of . HP credits a committee of eight high school, community college, and university teachers with assisting in the design of the calculator.

The calculator is derived from and the hardware is based on the more powerful science/engineering oriented HP 48 series of machines.

Unlike the HP 48 series, which offered both reverse Polish notation and algebraic entry logic, the HP 38G has only algebraic entry. The calculator is programmable, supporting small, interactive applications called &quot;aplets&quot;.

==Successors==
After a HP 38G+ prototype was cancelled in 1998, the 38G was replaced in 2000 by the HP 39G and (in Europe and some other markets) HP 40G. The two models were differentiated by the inclusion of a computer algebra system (CAS) in the HP 40G. An unofficial method of operating the 40G&#x27;s CAS on the 39G was addressed in the next follow-up device, the HP 39g+ introduced in 2003, for which there is no known CAS implementation.

Further successors have included the HP 39gs and HP 40gs (with and without CAS) introduced in 2006, and the HP 39gII in 2011.

Beginning with the 39g+, all of these successors have been built using an ARM architecture CPU with varying degrees of emulation to support software written for previous members of the series, and have gradually added more modern methods of connectivity such as USB to either replace or supplement the original RS-232 and IR.

<doc id="740869" wikidata="Q413498" url="?curid=740869" title="Acanthite">
<text>Acanthite is a form of silver sulfide with the chemical formula Ag2S. It crystallizes in the monoclinic system and is the stable form of silver sulfide below . Argentite is the stable form above that temperature. As argentite cools below that temperature its cubic form is distorted to the monoclinic form of acanthite. Below 173 °C acanthite forms directly. Acanthite is the only stable form in normal air temperature.

==Occurrence==
Acanthite is a common silver mineral in moderately low-temperature hydrothermal 
veins and in zones of supergene enrichment. It occurs in association with native silver, pyrargyrite, proustite, polybasite, stephanite, aguilarite, galena, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, calcite and quartz.

Acanthite was first described in 1855 for an occurrence in the Jáchymov (Joachimsthal) district, Ore Mountains, Bohemia (today Karlovy Vary Region, Czech Republic). The name is from the Greek &quot;akantha&quot; meaning thorn or arrow, in reference to its crystal shape.

<doc id="740870" wikidata="Q363989" url="?curid=740870" title="Paul Schrader">
<text>Paul Joseph Schrader (; born July 22, 1946) is an American screenwriter, film director, and film critic. He first became known for writing the screenplay of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976). He later continued his collaboration with Scorsese, writing or co-writing &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980), &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988), and &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; (1999). Schrader has also worked extensively as a director: his 23 films include &quot;Blue Collar&quot; (1978), &quot;Hardcore&quot; (1979), &quot;American Gigolo&quot; (1980), &quot;&quot; (1985), &quot;Light Sleeper&quot; (1992), &quot;Affliction&quot; (1997), and &quot;First Reformed&quot; (2017), with the last of these earning him his first Academy Award nomination. Schrader&#x27;s work frequently depicts &quot;man in a room&quot; stories which feature isolated, troubled men confronting an existential crisis.

Raised in a strict Calvinist family, Schrader attended Calvin College before pursuing film studies at UCLA on the encouragement of film critic Pauline Kael. He then worked as a film scholar and critic, publishing the book &quot;Transcendental Style in Film: Ozu, Bresson, Dreyer&quot; (1972) before transitioning to screenwriting in 1974. The success of &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; in 1976 brought greater attention to his work, and Schrader began directing his own films, beginning with &quot;Blue Collar&quot; (co-written with his brother, Leonard Schrader). Schrader has described three of his recent films as a loose trilogy: &quot;First Reformed&quot; (2017), &quot;The Card Counter&quot; (2021), and &quot;Master Gardener&quot; (2022).

==Early life and education==
Schrader was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the son of Joan (&quot;née&quot; Fisher) and Charles A. Schrader, an executive. Schrader&#x27;s family attended the Calvinist Christian Reformed Church. Schrader&#x27;s mother was of Dutch descent, the daughter of emigrants from Friesland, while Schrader&#x27;s paternal grandfather was from a German family that had come to the U.S. through Canada.

His early life was based upon the religion&#x27;s strict principles and parental education. He did not see a film until he was seventeen years old when he was able to sneak away from home. In an interview, he stated that &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot; was the first film he saw. In his own words, he was &quot;very unimpressed&quot; by it, while &quot;Wild in the Country&quot;, which he saw sometime later, had quite some effect on him. Schrader attributes his intellectual rather than emotional approach towards movies and movie-making to his having no adolescent movie memories.

Schrader earned his B.A. in philosophy with a minor in theology from Calvin College but decided against becoming a minister. He then earned an M.A. in film studies at the UCLA Film School upon the recommendation of Pauline Kael, who encouraged him to be a film critic.

Schrader first became a film critic, writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot; and later for &quot;Cinema&quot; magazine. His book &quot;Transcendental Style in Film: Ozu, Bresson, Dreyer&quot;, which examines the similarities between Robert Bresson, Yasujirō Ozu, and Carl Theodor Dreyer, was published in 1972. Other film-makers who made a lasting impression on Schrader are John Ford, Jean Renoir, Roberto Rossellini, Alfred Hitchcock, and Sam Peckinpah. Renoir&#x27;s &quot;The Rules of the Game&quot; he called the &quot;quintessential movie&quot; which represents &quot;all of the cinema&quot;.

==Film career==
In 1974, Schrader and his brother Leonard co-wrote &quot;The Yakuza&quot;, a film set in the Japanese crime world. The script became the subject of a bidding war, eventually selling for $325,000. The film was directed by Sydney Pollack and starred Robert Mitchum. Robert Towne, best known for &quot;Chinatown&quot;, also received a credit for his rewrite. Although &quot;The Yakuza&quot; failed commercially, it brought Schrader to the attention of the new generation of Hollywood directors. In 1975, he wrote the script for &quot;Obsession&quot; for Brian De Palma. Schrader wrote an early draft of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977), but Spielberg disliked the script, calling it &quot;terribly guilt-ridden&quot;, and opted for something lighter. He also wrote an early draft of &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; (1977), which the film&#x27;s producers had reworked without his participation. He disapproved of the final film. Schrader&#x27;s script about an obsessed New York City taxi driver became Martin Scorsese&#x27;s film &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, which was nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture and won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Besides &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), Scorsese also drew on scripts by Schrader for &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980), co-credited to Mardik Martin; &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988); and &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; (1999).

Thanks partly to critical acclaim for &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, Schrader was able to direct his first feature, &quot;Blue Collar&quot; (1978), co-written with his brother Leonard. &quot;Blue Collar&quot; features Richard Pryor, Harvey Keitel, and Yaphet Kotto as car factory workers attempting to escape their socio-economic rut through theft and blackmail. He has described the film as challenging to make, because of the artistic and personal tensions between him and the cast. During principal photography, he suffered an on-set mental collapse, which led him to reconsider his career seriously. John Milius acted as executive producer on the following year&#x27;s &quot;Hardcore,&quot; again written by Schrader, a film with many autobiographical parallels in his depiction of the Calvinist milieu of Grand Rapids, and in the character of George C. Scott, which was based on Schrader&#x27;s father. Among Paul Schrader&#x27;s films in the 1980s were &quot;American Gigolo&quot; starring Richard Gere (1980), his &quot;Cat People&quot; (1982) a remake of the 1942 film &quot;Cat People&quot;, and &quot;&quot; (1985). Inspired by Japanese writer Yukio Mishima, the film interweaves episodes from Mishima&#x27;s life with dramatizations of segments from his books. &quot;Mishima&quot; was nominated for the top prize (the Palme d&#x27;Or) at the Cannes Film Festival. Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas served as executive producers. Schrader also directed &quot;Patty Hearst&quot; (1988), about the kidnapping and transformation of the Hearst Corporation heiress. In 1987, he was a member of the jury at the 37th Berlin International Film Festival.

His 1990s work included the travelers-in-Venice tale &quot;The Comfort of Strangers&quot; (1990), adapted by Harold Pinter from the Ian McEwan novel, and &quot;Light Sleeper&quot; (1992), a sympathetic study of a drug dealer vying for a normal life. In 2005, Schrader described &quot;Light Sleeper&quot; as his &quot;most personal&quot; film. In 1997, he made &quot;Touch&quot; (1997), based on an Elmore Leonard novel about a young man seemingly able to cure the sick by the laying on of hands. In 1998, Schrader won critical acclaim for the drama &quot;Affliction&quot;. The film tells the story of a troubled small-town policeman (Nick Nolte) who becomes obsessed with solving the mystery behind a fatal hunting accident. Schrader&#x27;s script was based on the novel by Russell Banks. The film was nominated for multiple awards, including two Academy Awards for acting (for Nolte and James Coburn). Schrader received the Austin Film Festival&#x27;s Distinguished Screenwriter Award the same year. In 1999, Schrader received the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement from the Writers Guild of America.
In 2002, he directed the well received biopic &quot;Auto Focus&quot;, based on the life and murder of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; actor Bob Crane. In 2003, Schrader made entertainment headlines after being fired from &quot;The Exorcist: Dominion&quot;, a prequel film to the horror classic &quot;The Exorcist&quot; from 1973. The film&#x27;s production companies Morgan Creek Productions and Warner Bros. Pictures intensely disliked the film Schrader had made. Director Renny Harlin was hired to re-shoot nearly the entire movie, which was released as &quot;&quot; on August 20, 2004, to disastrously negative reviews and embarrassing box office receipts. Warner Bros. and Morgan Creek put over $80 million into the endeavor, and Harlin&#x27;s film only made back $41 million domestically. Schrader&#x27;s version of the film eventually premiered at the Brussels International Festival of Fantastic Film on March 18, 2005, as &quot;Exorcist: The Original Prequel&quot;. Due to extreme interest in Schrader&#x27;s version from critics and cinephiles alike, Warner Bros. agreed to give the film a limited theatrical release later that year under the title &quot;&quot;. The film was only shown on 110 screens around the United States and made just $251,000. The critics liked Schrader&#x27;s version much better than Harlin&#x27;s. However, Schrader&#x27;s film ultimately met with a generally negative reaction.

After that, Schrader filmed &quot;The Walker&quot; (2007), starring Woody Harrelson as a male escort caught up in a political murder enquiry, and the Israel-set &quot;Adam Resurrected&quot; (2008), which stars Jeff Goldblum and Willem Dafoe. Schrader headed the International Jury of the 2007 Berlin International Film Festival and in 2011 became a jury member for the ongoing Filmaka short film contest. On July 2, 2009, Schrader was awarded the inaugural Lifetime Achievement in Screenwriting award at the ScreenLit Festival in Nottingham, England. Several of his films were shown at the festival, including &quot;Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters&quot;, which followed the presentation of the award by director Shane Meadows.

After five years of trying and failing to find funding to make feature films, Schrader returned with &quot;The Canyons&quot; (2013), an erotic dramatic thriller written by Bret Easton Ellis and starring Lindsay Lohan and adult-film star James Deen. The film was one of the first films to use the website Kickstarter to crowd-source its funding. Schrader also used the website Let It Cast to have unknown actors submit their audition tapes over the internet. American Apparel provided some wardrobe for the film. The film was ultimately made for just $250,000 and had a limited theatrical release from IFC Films on August 2, 2013. The film was poorly received by general critics and audiences. The film only made $56,000 in theaters but found later success when released on various Video on Demand platforms.
In 2014, Schrader directed &quot;The Dying of the Light&quot;, an espionage thriller starring Nicolas Cage as a government agent suffering from a deadly disease, Anton Yelchin and Irène Jacob. In post-production Schrader was denied final cut by the film&#x27;s producers. The film was negatively received by many film critics and was a box-office bomb. Schrader later recut &quot;Dying of the Light&quot; into the separate, more experimental work &quot;Dark&quot;, which received more positive reviews. Schrader&#x27;s dramatic thriller &quot;First Reformed&quot;, starring Ethan Hawke, premiered at the 2017 Venice Film Festival and received critical acclaim. Schrader received his first Academy Award nomination for the film in the category Best Original Screenplay. In 2021, he directed the crime drama film &quot;The Card Counter&quot;, starring Oscar Isaac and Tiffany Haddish. The film also premiered at the 2021 Venice Film Festival and was widely lauded by critics. Schrader grouped these two films into a loose trilogy with another thriller, &quot;Master Gardener&quot;, starring Joel Edgerton and Sigourney Weaver. Like the rest of the trilogy, it premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2022, where Schrader was awarded the Golden Lion Honorary Award.

In 2023, it was confirmed Schrader would write and direct &quot;Oh, Canada&quot;, an adaptation of his friend Russell Banks&#x27; novel, &quot;Foregone&quot;, starring Richard Gere and Jacob Elordi.

=== Upcoming ===
Additionally, Schrader has written a western called &quot;Three Guns at Dawn,&quot; for Antoine Fuqua to direct; a drama about a trauma nurse called &quot;R.N&quot; for Elisabeth Moss to star in and direct; and an untitled script about a sex addict.

==Theatre career==
Schrader has written two stage plays, &quot;Berlinale&quot; and &quot;Cleopatra Club&quot;. The latter saw its premiere at the Powerhouse Theater in Poughkeepsie, New York, in 1995 and its foreign language debut in Vienna in 2011.

==Themes==
A recurring theme in Schrader&#x27;s films is the protagonist on a self-destructive path, or undertaking actions which work against himself, deliberately or subconsciously. The finale often bears an element of redemption, preceded by a painful sacrifice or cathartic act of violence.

Schrader has repeatedly referred to &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, &quot;American Gigolo&quot;, &quot;Light Sleeper&quot;, &quot;The Canyons&quot;, &quot;The Walker&quot;, &quot;First Reformed&quot;, and &quot;The Card Counter&quot; as &quot;a man in a room&quot; stories. The protagonist in each film changes from an angry, then narcissistic, later anxious character, to a person who hides behind a mask of superficiality.

Although many of his films or scripts are based on real-life biographies &quot;(Raging Bull&quot;, &quot;Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters&quot;, &quot;Patty Hearst&quot;, &quot;Auto Focus)&quot;, Schrader confessed having problems with biographical films due to their altering of actual events, which he tried to prevent by imposing structures and stylization.

==Personal life==
Schrader battled a cocaine addiction, which contributed to his divorce from his first wife, art director Jeannine Oppewall. He then moved from Los Angeles to Japan in hopes of getting his life on track, finally quitting drugs around 1990. His second marriage is to actress Mary Beth Hurt, who has appeared in smaller roles in a variety of his films. Together they have two children, a daughter and a son.

In September 2022, Schrader was hospitalized for &quot;breathing problems&quot;.

In January 2023, he and his wife moved from New York&#x27;s suburban Putnam County to a luxury assisted-living facility in Manhattan&#x27;s Hudson Yards area, where Hurt receives treatment for her worsening Alzheimer&#x27;s.

===Views===
Schrader is a Christian. Raised Calvinist, Schrader abandoned religion in his young adulthood, before returning to Christianity later in life. He became an Episcopalian after the birth of his children. As of 2018, he attends a Presbyterian church. His films frequently feature religious themes. However, Schrader has now emphasized that he considers himself to be just a Christian.

In December 2016, Schrader referred to the then-upcoming Trump presidency as &quot;a call to violence&quot; and said &quot;we should be willing to take arms. Like Old John Brown.&quot; He quickly deleted the post, but was visited by the New York City Police Department Counterterrorism Bureau for threatening violence. Schrader expressed some regret for his post (blaming it on him drinking alcohol and taking an Ambien), apologizing for his post&#x27;s violent rhetoric, but not for his comments critical of Trump.

In 2021, Schrader attacked cancel culture, describing it as &quot;infectious...like the Delta virus&quot;. In 2022, Schrader criticized that year&#x27;s &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; Greatest Films poll, describing it as a &quot;politically correct rejiggering&quot;, with its selection of &quot;Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles&quot; as the greatest film of all time being the product of &quot;distorted woke reappraisal&quot;. In 2023, he also criticized the politicization of the 95th Academy Awards, writing that the Oscars&#x27; &quot;scramble to be woke&quot; have made their ceremony &quot;mean less each year&quot;.

===Favorite films===
In 2012, Schrader participated in the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; film polls of that year. Held every ten years to select the greatest films of all time, contemporary directors were asked to select ten films of their choice. Schrader gave the following ten in alphabetical order.

<doc id="740871" wikidata="Q156526" url="?curid=740871" title="Anglesite">
<text>Anglesite is a lead sulfate mineral with the chemical formula PbSO4. It occurs as an oxidation product of primary lead sulfide ore, galena. Anglesite occurs as prismatic orthorhombic crystals and earthy masses, and is isomorphous with barite and celestine. It contains 74% of lead by mass and therefore has a high specific gravity of 6.3. Anglesite&#x27;s color is white or gray with pale yellow streaks. It may be dark gray if impure.

It was first recognized as a mineral species by William Withering in 1783, who discovered it in the Parys copper-mine in Anglesey; the name anglesite, from this locality, was given by F. S. Beudant in 1832. The crystals from Anglesey, which were formerly found abundantly on a matrix of dull limonite, are small in size and simple in form, being usually bounded by four faces of a prism and four faces of a dome; they are brownish-yellow in colour owing to a stain of limonite. Crystals from some other localities, notably from in Sardinia, are transparent and colourless, possessed of a brilliant adamantine lustre, and usually modified by numerous bright faces. The variety of combinations and habits presented by the crystals is very extensive, nearly two hundred distinct forms being figured by V. von Lang in his monograph of the species; without measurement of the angles the crystals are frequently difficult to decipher. There are distinct cleavages parallel to the faces of the prism (110) and the basal plane (001), but these are not so well developed as in the isomorphous minerals barite and celestite.

Anglesite is a mineral of secondary origin, having been formed by the oxidation of galena in the upper parts of mineral lodes where these have been affected by weathering processes. At Monteponi the crystals encrust cavities in glistening granular galena; and from Leadhills, in Scotland, pseudomorphs of anglesite after galena are known. At most localities it is found as isolated crystals in the lead-bearing lodes, but at some places, in Australia and Mexico, it occurs as large masses, and is then mined as an ore of lead.

Anglesite is sometimes used as a gemstone.

<doc id="740874" wikidata="Q309038" url="?curid=740874" title="Barium sulfate">
<text>Barium sulfate (or sulphate) is the inorganic compound with the chemical formula BaSO4. It is a white crystalline solid that is odorless and insoluble in water. It occurs in nature as the mineral barite, which is the main commercial source of barium and materials prepared from it. Its opaque white appearance and its high density are exploited in its main applications.

==Uses==

===Drilling fluids===
About 80% of the world&#x27;s barium sulfate production, mostly purified mineral, is consumed as a component of oil well drilling fluid. It increases the density of the fluid, increasing the hydrostatic pressure in the well and reducing the chance of a blowout.

===Radiocontrast agent===

Barium sulfate in suspension is often used medically as a radiocontrast agent for X-ray imaging and other diagnostic procedures. It is most often used in imaging of the GI tract during what is colloquially known as a &quot;barium meal&quot;. It is administered orally, or by enema, as a suspension of fine particles in a thick milk-like solution (often with sweetening and flavoring agents added). Although barium is a heavy metal, and its water-soluble compounds are often highly toxic, the low solubility of barium sulfate protects the patient from absorbing harmful amounts of the metal. Barium sulfate is also readily removed from the body, unlike Thorotrast, which it replaced. Due to the relatively high atomic number (&quot;Z&quot; = 56) of barium, its compounds absorb X-rays more strongly than compounds derived from lighter nuclei.

===Pigment===
The majority of synthetic barium sulfate is used as a component of white pigment for paints. In oil paint, barium sulfate is almost transparent, and is used as a filler or to modify consistency. One major manufacturer of artists&#x27; oil paint sells &quot;permanent white&quot; that contains a mixture of titanium white pigment (TiO2) and barium sulfate. The combination of barium sulfate and zinc sulfide (ZnS) is the inorganic pigment called lithopone. In photography it is used as a coating for certain photographic papers.
It is also used as a coating to diffuse light evenly.

===Light-reflecting paint for cooling===
Barium sulfate is highly reflective, of both visible and ultraviolet light. Researchers used it as an ingredient in paint that reflects 98.1% of solar radiation, allowing surfaces to which it has been applied to stay cooler in sunlit conditions. Commercially available white paints only reflect 80 - 90% of solar radiation. By using hexagonal nanoplatelet boron nitride, the thickness of a coat of this type of paint was reduced to 0.15 mm.

===Paper brightener===
A thin layer of barium sulfate called baryta is first coated on the base surface of most photographic paper to increase the reflectiveness of the image, with the first such paper introduced in 1884 in Germany. The light-sensitive silver halide emulsion is then coated over the baryta layer. The baryta coating limits the penetration of the emulsion into the fibers of the paper and makes the emulsion more even, resulting in more uniform blacks. Further coatings may then be present for fixing and protection of the image. Baryta has also been used to brighten papers intended for ink-jet printing.

===Plastics filler===
Barium sulfate is commonly used as a filler for plastics to increase the density of the polymer in vibrational mass damping applications. In polypropylene and polystyrene plastics, it is used as a filler in proportions up to 70%. It has an effect of increasing acid and alkali resistance and opacity. Such composites are also used as X-ray shielding materials due to their enhanced radio-opacity. In cases where machinability and weight are a concern, composites with high mass fraction (70–80%) of barium sulfate may be preferred to the more commonly used steel shields.

Barium sulfate can also be used to enhance the material properties of HDPE, although typically in relatively low concentrations, and often in combination with other fillers like calcium carbonate or titanium oxide.

===Niche uses===
Barium sulfate is used in soil testing. Tests for soil pH and other qualities of soil use colored indicators, and small particles (usually clay) from the soil can cloud the test mixture and make it hard to see the color of the indicator. Barium sulfate added to the mixture binds with these particles, making them heavier so they fall to the bottom, leaving a clearer solution.

In colorimetry, barium sulfate is used as a near-perfect diffuser when measuring light sources.

In metal casting, the moulds used are often coated with barium sulfate in order to prevent the molten metal from bonding with the mould.

It is also used in brake linings, anacoustic foams, powder coatings, and root canal filling.

Barium sulfate is an ingredient in the &quot;rubber&quot; pellets used by Chilean police. This together with silica helps the pellet attain a 96.5 Shore A hardness.

====Catalyst support====
Barium sulfate is used as a catalyst support when selectively hydrogenating functional groups that are sensitive to overreduction. With a low surface area, the contact time of the substrate with the catalyst is shorter and thus selectivity is achieved. Palladium on barium sulfate is also used as a catalyst in the Rosenmund reduction.

====Pyrotechnics====
As barium compounds emit a characteristic green light when heated at high temperature, barium salts are often used in green pyrotechnic formulas, although nitrate and chlorate salts are more common. Barium sulfate is commonly used as a component of &quot;strobe&quot; pyrotechnic compositions.

====Copper industry====
As barium sulfate has a high melting point and is insoluble in water, it is used as a release material in casting of copper anode plates. The anode plates are cast in copper molds, so to avoid the direct contact of the liquid copper with the solid copper mold, a suspension of fine barium sulfate powder in water is used as a coating on the mold surface. Thus, when the molten copper solidifies in form of an anode plate it can be easily released from its mold.

====Radiometric measurements====
Barium sulfate is sometimes used, besides polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), to coat the interior of integrating spheres due to the high reflectance of the material and near Lambertian characteristics.

====3D printing of firearms====
Barium sulfate is listed among the materials acceptable to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) for the manufacturing of firearms and/or components that are made of plastic, to achieve compliance with the U.S. federal requirement that an X-ray machine must be able to accurately depict the shape of the plastic firearm or component.

==Production==
Almost all of the barium consumed commercially is obtained from barite, which is often highly impure. Barite is processed by thermo-chemical sulfate reduction (TSR), also known as carbothermal reduction (heating with coke) to give barium sulfide:
: BaSO4 + 4 C → BaS + 4 CO

In contrast to barium sulfate, barium sulfide is soluble in water and readily converted to the oxide, carbonate, and halides. To produce highly pure barium sulfate, the sulfide or chloride is treated with sulfuric acid or sulfate salts:
: BaS + H2SO4 → BaSO4 + H2S

Barium sulfate produced in this way is often called , which is French for &quot;permanent white&quot;. Blanc fixe is the form of barium encountered in consumer products, such as paints.

In the laboratory barium sulfate is generated by combining solutions of barium ions and sulfate salts. Because barium sulfate is the least toxic salt of barium due to its insolubility, wastes containing barium salts are sometimes treated with sodium sulfate to immobilize (detoxify) the barium. Barium sulfate is one of the most insoluble salts of sulfate. Its low solubility is exploited in qualitative inorganic analysis as a test for Ba2+ ions, as well as for sulfate.

Untreated raw materials such as natural baryte formed under hydrothermal conditions may contain many impurities, a.o., quartz, or even amorphous silica.

==History==
Barium sulfate is reduced to barium sulfide by carbon. The accidental discovery of this conversion many centuries ago led to the discovery of the first synthetic phosphor. The sulfide, unlike the sulfate, is water-soluble.

During the early part of the 20th century, during the Japanese colonization period, hokutolite was found to exist naturally in the Beitou hot-springs area near Taipei City, Taiwan. Hokutolite is a radioactive mineral composed mostly of PbSO4 and BaSO4, but also containing traces of uranium, thorium and radium. The Japanese harvested these elements for industrial uses, and also developed dozens of “therapeutic hot-spring baths” in the area.

==Safety aspects==
Although soluble salts of barium are moderately toxic to humans, barium sulfate is nontoxic due to its insolubility. The most common means of inadvertent barium poisoning arises from the consumption of soluble barium salts mislabeled as BaSO4. In the Celobar incident (Brazil, 2003), nine patients died from improperly prepared radiocontrast agent. In regards to occupational exposures, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration set a permissible exposure limit at 15 mg/m3, while the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has a recommended exposure limit at 10 mg/m3. For respiratory exposures, both agencies have set an occupational exposure limit at 5 mg/m3.

<text>Barium oxide, also known as baria, is a white hygroscopic non-flammable compound with the formula BaO. It has a cubic structure and is used in cathode-ray tubes, crown glass, and catalysts. It is harmful to human skin and if swallowed in large quantity causes irritation. Excessive quantities of barium oxide may lead to death.

It is prepared by heating barium carbonate with coke, carbon black or tar or by thermal decomposition of barium nitrate.

==Uses==
Barium oxide is used as a coating for hot cathodes, for example, those in cathode-ray tubes. It replaced lead(II) oxide in the production of certain kinds of glass such as optical crown glass. While lead oxide raised the refractive index, it also raised the dispersive power, which barium oxide does not alter. Barium oxide also has use as an ethoxylation catalyst in the reaction of ethylene oxide and alcohols, which takes place between 150 and 200 °C.

It is most known for its use in the Brin process, named after its inventors, a reaction that was used as a large scale method to produce oxygen before air separation became the dominant method in the beginning of the 20th century, as BaO can be a source of pure oxygen through heat fluctuation.

BaO(s) + ½O2(g) ⇌ BaO2(s)

It oxidises to BaO2 by formation of a peroxide ion (, or ) — with the same charge of , and therefore keeping the electrochemical balance with the most stable . Using the Kröger-Vink notation, 

½(g) + O ⇌ [O]

where J is the species J in the oxygen position within the rock-salt lattice. The complete peroxidation of BaO to BaO2 occurs at moderate temperatures by oxygen uptake within the BaO rock-salt lattice:
Calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) suggest that the oxygen incorporation reaction is exothermic, and that the most energetically favoured occupation site is indeed the peroxide ion at the oxide lattice — other than interstitial positions, for instance. However, the increased entropy of the system is what leads BaO2 to decompose to BaO and release O2 between 800 and 1100 K (520 and 820 °C). The reaction was used as a large scale method to produce oxygen before air separation became the dominant method in the beginning of the 20th century. The method was named the Brin process, after its inventors.

==Preparation==
Barium oxide from metallic barium readily forms from its exothermic oxidation with dioxygen in air:

2 Ba(s) + O2(g) → 2 BaO(s).

It&#x27;s most commonly made by heating barium carbonate at temperatures of 1000–1450 °C.

BaCO3(s) → BaO(s) + CO2(g)

Likewise, it is often formed through the thermal decomposition of other barium salts, like barium nitrate.

==Safety issues==
Barium oxide is an irritant. If it contacts the skin or the eyes or is inhaled it causes pain and redness. However, it is more dangerous when ingested. It can cause nausea and diarrhea, muscle paralysis, cardiac arrhythmia, and can cause death. If ingested, medical attention should be sought immediately.

Barium oxide should not be released environmentally; it is harmful to aquatic organisms.

<text>Bischofite is a hydrous magnesium chloride mineral with formula MgCl2·6H2O. It belongs to halides and is a sea salt concentrate. It contains many macro- and micro-elements vital for human health, in much higher concentrations than can be found in sea or ocean salt. The main bischofite compound is magnesium chloride (up to 350 g/L), moreover, it contains about 70 other elements as impurities, including potassium, sodium, bromine, boron, calcium, silicon, molybdenum, silver, zinc, iron and copper.

==History==
Bischofite is named in honor of German geologist Gustav Bischof (1792–1870). Its discovery (1877) is attributed to Carl Christian Ochsenius.

At its type locality bischofite it an evaporite formed in an ancient seabed, which was deposited more than 200 million years ago, during the Permian Period. Its composition can be explained by high content of magnesium chloride in the primordial ocean.

In 1930–1950, vast bischofite deposits were discovered near the Volga River in Russia. The mineral is mined by dissolving an underground dry mineral stratum with artesian water. The resulting brine is pumped out.

==Deposits==
Bischofite deposits differ by their composition: some of them are salt basins where bischofite is mixed with other minerals such as carnallite, halite, kieserite and anhydrite. These are the so-called bischofite containing rocks which have pink-brown-yellow and orange-red colors. They contain 36–58% of bischofite. Carnallite deposits are known in Staßfurt, Germany – where bischofite was first discovered, and carnallite is one of the most important minerals in potassium salt deposits (Solykam deposit, Ural, Russia). Sub-surface bischofite layers were also discovered in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, China and the US.

There are bischofite-rich deposits with concentrations of 93–96% of the mineral. One of those rare deposits is located in the Volgograd region of Russia. Another one was found in 1990s in the Poltava region in Ukraine. This is one of the deepest () and oldest bischofite deposits.

==Applications==
Bischofite has many applications ranging from construction materials (tile, stone) to agriculture (preplant seeds, plant processing during vegetation period), oil extraction (for grouting and solidifying mortars), medical and chemical industry (production of magnesium metal). 

Bischofite is used in form of compresses to treat joint diseases such as arthritis, rheumatic fever osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, radiculitis, calcaneal spur and traumas, especially in rehabilitation centers in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and Lithuania. Bischofite is also applied in gel form. 

Bischofite is used in the production of the industrial Sorel cement and synthetic carnallite. Bischofite solution is applied to deice roads, similar to sodium chloride, but it is less corrosive. It is also used in agriculture, veterinary medicine and cattle breeding to increase the crop yield and treat animals.

<text>Diaspore ()also called diasporite, empholite, kayserite, or tanatariteis an aluminium hydroxide oxide mineral, α-AlO(OH), crystallizing in the orthorhombic system and isomorphous with goethite. It occurs sometimes as flattened crystals, but usually as lamellar or scaly masses, the flattened surface being a direction of perfect cleavage on which the lustre is markedly pearly in character. It is colorless or greyish-white, yellowish, sometimes violet in color, and varies from translucent to transparent. It may be readily distinguished from other colorless transparent minerals with a perfect cleavage and pearly luster (e.g. mica, talc, brucite, and gypsum) by its greater hardness of 6.5–7. Its specific gravity is 3.4. When heated before the blowpipe, it decrepitates violently, breaking up into white pearly scales.

The mineral occurs as an alteration product of corundum or emery and is found in granular limestone and other crystalline rocks. Well-developed crystals are found in the emery deposits of the Ural Mountains and at Chester, Massachusetts, and in kaolin at Schemnitz in Hungary. If obtainable in large quantity, it would be of economic importance as a source of aluminium.

Diaspore, along with gibbsite and boehmite, is a major component of the aluminium ore bauxite.

It was first described in 1801 for an occurrence in Mramorsk Zavod, Sverdlovskaya Oblast, Middle Urals, Russia. The name, which was coined by René Just Haüy, is from the Ancient Greek meaning &quot;to scatter&quot;, in allusion to its decrepitation on heating.

&quot;Csarite&quot;, &quot;ottomanite&quot;, &quot;Turkizite&quot; and &quot;zultanite&quot; are trade names for gem-quality diaspore (also known as Turkish diaspore) from the İlbir Mountains of southwest Turkey.

<doc id="740885" wikidata="Q413374" url="?curid=740885" title="Calcium fluoride">
<text>Calcium fluoride is the inorganic compound of the elements calcium and fluorine with the formula CaF2. It is a white solid that is practically insoluble in water. It occurs as the mineral fluorite (also called fluorspar), which is often deeply coloured owing to impurities.

==Chemical structure==

The compound crystallizes in a cubic motif called the fluorite structure.

Ca2+ centres are eight-coordinate, being centred in a cube of eight F− centres. Each F− centre is coordinated to four Ca2+ centres in the shape of a tetrahedron. Although perfectly packed crystalline samples are colorless, the mineral is often deeply colored due to the presence of F-centers.
The same crystal structure is found in numerous ionic compounds with formula AB2, such as CeO2, cubic ZrO2, UO2, ThO2, and PuO2. In the corresponding anti-structure, called the antifluorite structure, anions and cations are swapped, such as Be2C.

===Gas phase===
The gas phase is noteworthy for failing the predictions of VSEPR theory; the molecule is not linear like , but bent with a bond angle of approximately 145°; the strontium and barium dihalides also have a bent geometry. It has been proposed that this is due to the fluoride ligands interacting with the electron core or the d-subshell of the calcium atom.

==Preparation==
The mineral fluorite is abundant, widespread, and mainly of interest as a precursor to HF. Thus, little motivation exists for the industrial production of CaF2. High purity CaF2 is produced by treating calcium carbonate with hydrofluoric acid:
:CaCO3 + 2 HF → CaF2 + CO2 + H2O

==Applications==

Naturally occurring CaF2 is the principal source of hydrogen fluoride, a commodity chemical used to produce a wide range of materials.
Calcium fluoride in the fluorite state is of significant commercial importance as a fluoride source. Hydrogen fluoride is liberated from the mineral by the action of concentrated sulfuric acid:
:CaF2 + H2SO4 → CaSO4(solid) + 2 HF

===Others===
Calcium fluoride is used to manufacture optical components such as windows and lenses, used in thermal imaging systems, spectroscopy, telescopes, and excimer lasers (used for photolithography in the form of a fused lens). It is transparent over a broad range from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR) frequencies. Its low refractive index reduces the need for anti-reflection coatings. Its insolubility in water is convenient as well. It also allows much smaller wavelengths to pass through.

Doped calcium fluoride, like natural fluorite, exhibits thermoluminescence and is used in thermoluminescent dosimeters. It forms when fluorine combines with calcium.

==Safety==
CaF2 is classified as &quot;not dangerous&quot;, although reacting it with sulfuric acid produces hydrofluoric acid, which is highly corrosive and toxic. With regards to inhalation, the NIOSH-recommended concentration of fluorine-containing dusts is 2.5 mg/m3 in air.

<doc id="740887" wikidata="Q2706284" url="?curid=740887" title="Goslarite">
<text>Goslarite is a hydrated zinc sulfate mineral () which was first found in the Rammelsberg mine, Goslar, Harz, Germany. It was described in 1847. Goslarite belongs to the epsomite group which also includes epsomite () and morenosite (). Goslarite is an unstable mineral at the surface and will dehydrate to other minerals like bianchite (), boyleite () and gunningite ().

==Physical properties==
The composition of goslarite was determined by the US National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) in 1959 as follows: SO3 27.84 wt%, ZnO 28.30 wt% and 43.86 wt%.

Goslarite&#x27;s cleavage is perfect in {010}, as for epsomite and morenosite. The color of goslarite ranges from brownish to pinkish, blue, brown, colorless, green and green blue. The luster ranges from vitreous to nacreous and silky (if fibrous). Goslarite is soluble in water, has an astringent taste, and is strongly diamagnetic.

==Geologic occurrence==
Goslarite is formed from the oxidation of sphalerite ((Zn, Fe)S). It was first found in Rammelsberg mine, Goslar, Harz, Germany. It often occurs as an efflorescence on timbers and walls of mine passages. Goslarite is widespread as a post mining efflorescence in mines that contain sphalerite or any zinc minerals.

==Economical uses==
In the pharmaceutical industry it is used as a direct emetic, antiseptic and disinfectant.

<doc id="740892" wikidata="Q388053" url="?curid=740892" title="Kieserite">
<text>Kieserite, or magnesium sulfate monohydrate, is a hydrous magnesium sulfate mineral with formula (MgSO4·H2O).

It has a vitreous luster and it is colorless, grayish-white or yellowish. Its hardness is 3.5 and crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system. Gunningite is the zinc member of the kieserite group of minerals.

==Etymology==
It is named after Dietrich Georg von Kieser (Jena, Germany 1862).

==Occurrence==

Kieserite commonly occurs in marine evaporites and rarely in volcanic environments as a sublimate. It occurs in association with halite, carnallite, polyhalite, anhydrite, boracite, sulfoborite, leonite, epsomite and celestine.

===Mars===
In early 2005, Mars Express, a European Space Agency orbiter, discovered evidence of kieserite in patches of Valles Marineris (the largest canyon on Mars), along with gypsum and polyhydrated sulfates. This is direct evidence of Mars&#x27;s watery past and augments similar discoveries made by the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity in 2004.

=== Moons of Jupiter ===
Kieserite might also be a rock-forming mineral in the icy mantle of the outer three Galilean moons (Europa, Ganymede, Callisto). At pressures higher than 2.7 GPa, kieserite transforms to a triclinic crystal structure.

==Uses==

It is used in the production of Epsom salt and as a fertilizer, the overall global annual usage in agriculture in the mid 1970s was 2.3 million tons.
Kieserite is also used for cleaning hard water deposits from tiles, stones, and other pool and fountain lining materials. Due to its hardness, which is greater than hard water deposits but less than tiles and other water feature linings, it is blasted at the hard water deposits to remove them. 

When used as a fertilizer, response to kieserite is likely where:
* Soil Mg levels are low
* pH is high
* Intensive liming occurs to raise the pH
* Nitrogen is applied as ammonium, as this can lead to an antagonism between ammonium and magnesium
* Compacted soils exist
* There is a period of wet/cold weather
* Dry weather occurs, leading to low magnesium mobility in the soil profile.

<text>Nickel arsenide is a compound of nickel and arsenic and component of the ore nickeline. It is highly toxic and a known carcinogen in humans. Uncontrolled decomposition of nickel arsenide can give rise to further toxic nickel compounds.

== Toxicity ==
Nickel arsenide was one of the first compounds that revealed the toxicity of nickel. The damage to the miners&#x27; lungs was documented by Georgius Agricola in the 16th century: &quot;kupfer-nickel&quot; ores in the Schneeberg mines contained red-colored NiAs mineral originally mistaken for the copper ore, thus the (copper) in the name. The (demon) name was reflecting the damage it did to the health of the workers, in addition to them being unable to extract any copper from this ore.

The acute oral LD50 in rats is about 6000 mg/kg.

==Preparation of NiAs==
The main compound within nickeline, nickel arsenide (NiAs), can be prepared by direct combination of the elements:

<doc id="740900" wikidata="Q15799" url="?curid=740900" title="Club Atlético River Plate">
<text>Club Atlético River Plate, commonly known as River Plate and abbreviated as CARP, is an Argentine professional sports club based in the Belgrano neighborhood of Buenos Aires. Founded in 1901, the club is named after the English name for the city&#x27;s estuary, Río de la Plata. River&#x27;s home stadium, Estadio Monumental, is the largest in South America. River had the highest average home attendance of any association football club in the world in 2023 with 84,567. With more than 350,000 members at the end of 2023, River is one of the largest sports clubs by membership.

Although a multi-sport club, River Plate is best known for its professional association football department, which has won Argentina&#x27;s Primera División championship a record 38 times, most recently in 2023. River Plate have also won 16 national cups, making River Argentina&#x27;s most successful team in domestic competitions with 54 titles. At international level, River have won 18 titles, including four Copa Libertadores, one Intercontinental Cup, one Supercopa Sudamericana, one Copa Sudamericana, three Recopa Sudamericanas, one Copa Interamericana, one Suruga Bank Championship, a record five Copa Aldaos, and one Tie Cup. In addition, River Plate&#x27;s reserve team won the U-20 Copa Libertadores in 2012. After winning the 2014 Copa Sudamericana, 2015 Recopa Sudamericana and the 2015 Copa Libertadores, River Plate became the first team to simultaneously hold CONMEBOL&#x27;s three current major international competitions.

River Plate are ranked first in the all-time Argentine Primera División table, having gained the most points, having played the most matches, and having the highest win percentage. River are also ranked first in the historical table of the Copa Libertadores, being the South American team with most games won and the most points gained. The club were placed ninth in the FIFA Club of the Century poll in 2000. In a survey published by the Argentine Football Association in 2016, 6 out of 11 players of the all-time greatest Argentina national team had played for River Plate.

River have a fierce rivalry with Boca Juniors. Matches between them are known as Superclásico, and the rivalry is among the most heated in the sport, due to the fixture&#x27;s global popularity and both clubs having the most fans in Argentina. Notable players who have played for River include José Manuel Moreno, Adolfo Pedernera, Ángel Labruna, Amadeo Carrizo, Alfredo Di Stéfano, Omar Sívori, Daniel Passarella, Enzo Francescoli, Hernán Crespo, Javier Mascherano and Gonzalo Higuaín.

==History==
According with the club&#x27;s official history, River Plate was founded on 25 May 1901, close to the La Boca neighborhood (later the home of fierce rivals Boca Juniors). They were formed from the merger of two clubs, &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; and &quot;La Rosales&quot;, with Leopoldo Bard elected as the first president. The name River Plate was chosen because of an incident during the construction of Buenos Aires Port: one of the members had seen how the workers of Dique nº 3 left their duties for a while to play a football match. The boxes they were working with just said &quot;The River Plate&quot; (the name the English gave to the Río de la Plata) and that inscription was taken to name the new club.

River Plate affiliated to the Argentine Football Association in 1905, debuting in the third division against Facultad de Medicina. On 13 December 1908, the team was promoted to first division after beating Racing Club 2–1. However, the match was declared null due to River supporters jumping onto the field to celebrate with the players, so a new match had to be played. River again won, this time 7–0, to achieve promotion.

In 1914 River won its first domestic championship, the Copa de Competencia Jockey Club and its first international title, the Copa de Competencia Chevallier Boutell. The nickname &quot;Los Millonarios&quot; came after the acquisition of winger Carlos Peucelle in 1931 for $10,000 and Bernabé Ferreyra for $35,000 (Large sum of money for the period) in 1932.

In the following years, River Plate consolidated its place as one of the most popular teams of Argentina, and the 20th century brought much success. The club&#x27;s record of 28 official tournaments saw them dubbed &quot;El Campeón del Siglo&quot; (The Champions of the Century).

== Kit ==
===Kit evolution===

;Notes
=== Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors ===
Adidas has been River Plate&#x27;s uniform supplier since 1982, becoming one of the company&#x27;s largest sponsorship deals in the world, only behind German club Bayern Munich. The US$60 million partnership with the German sports company signed in 2015 (extending the deal to 2021) marked the most expensive kit agreement in the history of Argentine football.

==Badge==
As in many football shirts and sports in general, the team&#x27;s jersey has a badge on its front, as a symbol of the institution. When the River Plate jersey was created it did not have a badge, and its presence varied throughout the history, according to the designs of each era. Currently it is embroidered on the jersey, with three colors (red, white and black). Its format resembles that of the jersey, as it has a red stripe that crosses it, along with the acronym of the club (CARP) in black, and the background is white, in a stylized design.

When Hugo Santilli became chairman in 1984, he soon called to a competition where a new emblem would be chosen. The main objective of this new image was to eradicate the nickname &quot;Gallinas (Hens)&quot; that River&#x27;s rivals (Boca Juniors fans mainly) used to mock them. Artists from Argentina took part in that competition. The club finally chose a logo designed by the artist Caloi. This emblem showed the figure of a lion (wearing a River jersey) rising from the Monumental stadium. The lion logo was immediately added to the uniforms (on the field and training clothes) having River Plate won the Copa Libertadores de América and European/South American Cup using the lion logo. In 1989, when Santilli left the club so the lion went with him and has not been reestablished since.

In February 2022, River Plate launched its new corporate image, which included an update to the logo and a typography designed exclusively for the club. The corporate image was created and developed by &quot;Grupo Berro&quot;, a branding and design studio that had been working on the corporate image for over two years.

==Rivalry==
River Plate and Boca Juniors are the two largest football clubs in Argentina, with more than half the country&#x27;s football fans supporting the clubs. Due to the rivalry between them, the Boca Juniors vs River Plate &quot;Superclásico&quot; local derby match was listed by the BBC as one of the most famous derbies in the world. Attending the match was also acclaimed in 2004 as the number one of the &quot;Fifty sporting things you must do before you die&quot; by &quot;The Observer&quot;.

==Club nicknames==
The &quot;River Plate&quot; name was chosen in 1901, when the team was still located at the La Boca neighbourhood, next to the Río de la Plata (&quot;River Plate&quot; in some English sources). Proposed names as &quot;Club Atlético Forward&quot;, &quot;Juventud Boquense&quot; or &quot;La Rosales&quot; had been rejected. Pedro Martínez saw the name &quot;The River Plate&quot; written at ship containers, and proposed it as a name, which was finally accepted as the official name.

River fans and the press are fond of the nickname &quot;Los Millonarios&quot; (The Millionaires). This name derives from the 1930s after some expensive transfers of players from other clubs, including Carlos Peucelle from Sportivo Buenos Aires in 1931 and Bernabé Ferreyra from Tigre in 1932.

Due to the red band in their shirt, it is also common to refer to River as &quot;El Equipo de la Banda&quot; (the team with the band) or simply &quot;La Banda&quot; (which means &quot;the stripe&quot;, but can also mean &quot;the band&quot; -both as in &quot;gang&quot; and &quot;musical group&quot;). River Plate&#x27;s forwards between 1941 and 1946 were given the nickname &quot;La Máquina&quot; (The Machine), due to their synchronization and movements on the field.

There was also a River Plate team that was known as &quot;La Maquinita&quot; (The Little Machine, as tribute to its predecessor) in the 1950s. Managed by José María Minella, the team earned the nickname after winning five championships in six years (1952–57). Some notable players were Alfredo Di Stéfano, Santiago Vernazza, Walter Gómez, Enrique Omar Sívori, among others. Some members of the original &quot;Máquina&quot; of the 1940s such as Labruna and Loustau, were also part of the team.

==Stadiums==
The Estadio Antonio Liberti (nicknamed &quot;El Monumental&quot;) located in the Belgrano neighborhood of Buenos Aires is River Plate&#x27;s stadium. With a capacity of 86,000, it was inaugurated on 25 May 1938. Argentina national football team usually plays its home games at the stadium.

Since its establishment in 1901, River Plate&#x27;s stadiums have been:

<text>Matt Monro (born Terence Edward Parsons; 1 December 1930 – 7 February 1985) was an English singer. Known as &quot;The Man with the Golden Voice&quot;, he performed internationally during his 30-year career and sold a reported 23 million records. AllMusic has described Monro as &quot;one of the most underrated pop vocalists of the &#x27;60s&quot;, who &quot;possessed the easiest, most perfect baritone in the business&quot;. Frank Sinatra said of Monro after his death: “If I had to choose three of the finest male vocalists in the singing business, Matt would be one of them. His pitch was right on the nose; his word enunciations letter perfect; his understanding of a song thorough.” 

Monro&#x27;s recordings include the UK top 10 hits &quot;Portrait of My Love&quot;, &quot;My Kind of Girl&quot;, &quot;Softly As I Leave You&quot;, &quot;Walk Away&quot;, and a cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Yesterday&quot;. He also recorded several film themes such as &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; for the eponymous James Bond film, &quot;Born Free&quot; for the eponymous film, and &quot;On Days Like These&quot; for &quot;The Italian Job&quot;.

==Life and early career==
Monro was born Terence Edward Parsons on 1 December 1930 in Finsbury, northeast of the City of London, to Frederick and Alice Parsons. He had three brothers — Arthur, Reg and Harry — and a sister, Alice. He attended Duncombe School in Islington, and Elliott School, Putney. 

Monro had a difficult childhood. His father died when he was three and after his mother became ill, he was fostered out for two years. Leaving school at 14, he tried a succession of jobs without remaining in any of them for very long, before National Service beckoned in 1948. Monro became a tank driving instructor in the British armed forces and was posted to Hong Kong. He had sung in public from an early age, for example at the Tufnell Park Palais, and in Hong Kong he took to entering local talent contests, winning several. In fact, he became a regular guest (and frequent winner) of Radio Rediffusion&#x27;s &quot;Talent Time&quot; show in Hong Kong. He was invited by then-host Ray Cordeiro to perform in his own one-off show entitled &quot;Terry Parsons Sings&quot;, on the condition that he would bow out of future &quot;Talent Time&quot; episodes to make way for others. Agreeing to the deal, he performed his first on-air concert for Rediffusion on 27 June 1953.

Following his discharge from the Army after five years, he returned to London, to try to make a career out of singing. Initially he had little success and was obliged to take on a number of different jobs to supplement his meagre income from the occasional singing engagement. He also hung around the music publishers offices in Denmark Street and occasionally made demos of new songs for their ever-optimistic song-pluggers. Eventually, he became a bus driver for London Transport, driving Route 27 from Holloway (Garage code J) Bus Garage (now demolished: the present Holloway Garage (HT) is the former Holloway Trolleybus Depot). 

In 1956, he made a demo record, &quot;Polka Dots and Moonbeams&quot; which was heard by pianist Winifred Atwell, who was an important influence on his early career. She recommended him to her own recording company, Decca Records, who signed him. She became his mentor, providing him with his stage name, Matt Monro. Matt came from Matt White, a journalist friend; and Monro was Atwell&#x27;s father&#x27;s Christian name. His first record which was released in November 1956, was &quot;Ev&#x27;rybody Falls in Love with Someone&quot;, a song which had just won the BBC Festival of Popular Songs. Monro gained some radio exposure on Radio Luxembourg and, starting on 2 January 1957, became a featured vocalist with the BBC TV &quot;Show Band Parade&quot; show presented by Cyril Stapleton which ran until 28 June 1957. He also got a television spot on &quot;The Winifred Atwell Show&quot; in 1956. 

In 1957, Monro released &quot;Blue and Sentimental&quot;, an album of standards. Despite the album&#x27;s favourable reception, Monro languished among the young male singers trying to break through at the end of the 1950s, many of them emulating Frankie Vaughan by recording cover versions of American hits. Monro even recorded a version of Vaughan&#x27;s &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; during this period. A short recording contract with Fontana Records followed.

By the end of the 1950s, Monro&#x27;s mid-decade profile had declined, and he returned to relative obscurity. He and his wife Mickie lived from her wages as a song plugger and his royalties from a TV advertising jingle for Camay soap. In 1959, he recorded a country pastiche song, &quot;Bound for Texas&quot;, for &quot;The Chaplin Revue&quot;, a feature-length compilation of Charlie Chaplin shorts. It would be the first of many Monro soundtrack themes.

==International career==
Prior to producing the Peter Sellers album &quot;Songs for Swingin&#x27; Sellers&quot; in 1959, EMI producer George Martin asked Monro to record &quot;You Keep Me Swingin&#x27;&quot;, a satirical song to help the comedian imitate the song with a Frank Sinatra-type styling. When Sellers heard the recording he decided to use it to be the opening track on the record, rather than record his own version, which he realised he couldn&#x27;t improve on himself. However, Sellers billed Monro as &quot;Fred Flange&quot;, and though it was a demoralising experience at the time, the incident developed into a lifelong friendship with Martin, who subsequently asked Monro to begin recording with him for EMI&#x27;s Parlophone record label. Their second single and Monro&#x27;s highest UK chart success, &quot;Portrait of My Love&quot;, written by Cyril Ornadel and Norman Newell (using the pseudonym &quot;David West&quot;) and arranged/conducted by Johnnie Spence, reached number three on the UK Singles Chart.

By the following year, Monro had been named Top International Act by &quot;Billboard&quot;. In February 1961, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; reported that Monro had won ITV&#x27;s &quot;A Song for Britain&quot; with &quot;My Kind of Girl&quot;. His follow-up hits included that song, plus &quot;Softly as I Leave You&quot; (1962) and the title song from the James Bond film &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963). For the latter, his vocals were not used in the opening titles, as became the standard for the series; they were heard on a radio during the film and over the final credits.

At the 1964 Eurovision Song Contest, singing &quot;I Love the Little Things&quot;, Monro finished second behind Italy&#x27;s 16-year-old Gigliola Cinquetti, his rendition being described an &quot;excellent performance of the only English language song of the night&quot;. The Austrian entry &quot;Warum nur warum?&quot;, performed by songwriter Udo Jürgens, caught Monro&#x27;s ear, despite its sixth-place finish, and he recorded an English version titled &quot;Walk Away&quot;, earning him another hit single in late 1964. The song had lyrics by Monro&#x27;s manager and friend, Don Black, whom he had met during his Denmark Street days when Black was working for Toff Music. He also had a hit with the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Yesterday&quot; in 1965, the first cover version of the most recorded song, even predating the Beatles&#x27; own release. That year, he was voted top singer in England in a poll.

The following year, Monro sang the Oscar-winning title song for the film &quot;Born Free&quot;, which became his signature tune. It was also his second collaboration with John Barry, following &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. Monro went on to record two further songs from Barry film scores: &quot;Wednesday&#x27;s Child&quot; (from the film &quot;The Quiller Memorandum&quot;) and &quot;This Way Mary&quot; (from &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot;). Both &quot;Born Free&quot; and &quot;On Days Like These&quot; (from the film &quot;The Italian Job&quot;) had lyrics by Don Black.

In the late 1960s, he recorded another Udo Jürgens song with the name &quot;Was Ich Dir Sagen Will&quot;. It was adapted to English as &quot;The Music Played&quot;. Monro recorded a Spanish version of the song with the adapted title of &quot;Alguien Cantó&quot;. The Spanish version was a top sales hit (Superventas) in Spain in 1969. Additionally, Monro recorded an English version of Jürgens&#x27; 1966 Eurovision winner &quot;Merci, Chérie&quot;, but it failed to chart when released as a UK single.

Monro reached the United States charts when &quot;My Kind of Girl&quot; (1961) and &quot;Walk Away&quot; (1964) hit the top 40. In 1966, following the death of Nat King Cole, EMI moved Monro from Parlophone to Capitol. The new recording contract necessitated a move to the United States. This would be the beginning of a trend towards LPs, and he now worked with American arrangers such as Sid Feller and Billy May on recording albums which included &quot;This Is the Life&quot;, &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, &quot;Invitation to the Movies&quot; and &quot;Invitation to Broadway&quot;. However, unlike &quot;Born Free&quot;, his other Capitol singles in California were not particularly successful. 

After moving to California and recording several albums with American arrangers, Monro returned to the UK and stayed with George Martin. He later began to change labels within EMI to Columbia, where his final U.S. album &quot;Close to You&quot; was released in 1970. This LP contained &quot;We&#x27;re Gonna Change the World&quot;, a semi-satirical song originally used in a TV commercial for Kellogg&#x27;s Cornflakes. It was not a hit in either the US or the UK but was nevertheless widely played, and became enduringly popular on BBC Radio 2. A re-recording in 1995, in which Monro&#x27;s son duetted electronically with his late father, did however just scrape into the UK chart at No. 100.

On 31 December 1976, Monro performed Black&#x27;s &quot;Walk Away&quot; on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;A Jubilee of Music&quot;, celebrating British pop music for Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s impending Silver Jubilee.

Monro continued touring and recording until just before his death, releasing a single and promoting it throughout the UK and Australia in 1984. In one of his final appearances, Monro praised Boy George, observing the importance of quality recordings in all musical genres.

==Marriages==
Monro was married twice:
* Iris Jordan, married 15 January 1955–1959 (divorced). They had one son, Mitchell Terence Parsons (1955 – 2003)
* Renata &quot;Mickie&quot; Schuller (19 July 1933, Berlin – 25 February 2010, Middx, UK), married 1959–1985 (his death). Renata Schuller was a Kindertransport child refugee who came to London in 1938. They had a daughter, Michele (1959), and a son, Matt Monro Jnr (born Matthew Frederick Monro) (1964).She had an earlier marriage:(Giles – Schuller, Ealing, 1954)

==Death==
Monro was a heavy smoker and battled alcoholism from the 1960s until 1981. He was diagnosed with liver cancer and was due to have a liver transplant around Christmas 1984 but it was deemed that the cancer had spread too far. He died on 7 February 1985 at Cromwell Hospital, Kensington, London, aged 54, leaving a widow, Mickie, and three children: Mitchell, Michele, and Matthew. Matt Monro was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. The ashes were removed by the family. A memorial service was also held in Harrow.

==Legacy==
The 20th anniversary of Monro&#x27;s death spotlighted the continuing interest in his music, with a top 10 tribute compilation CD (UK), a No. 1 concert DVD (UK), and a BBC TV documentary all appearing in 2005. A 2007 compilation CD entitled &quot;From Matt with Love&quot; reached the top 40 of the UK Albums Chart during its first week of release. His songs were featured on &quot;Friday Night Is Music Night&quot; on 8 October 2010.

In late 2005, Matt Monro Jr. toured the United Kingdom with a tribute concert commemorating the anniversary. Also, EMI re-released &quot;Matt Sings Monro&quot;, a 1995 duet album that combined his voice with the senior Monro&#x27;s. Another posthumous Matt Monro duet, with Cliff Richard, appeared on Richard&#x27;s duets CD, &quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot;, in 2007.

Monro never recorded a &quot;live&quot; concert album, preferring the technical purity of the recording studio and wanting his public performances to retain an element of uniqueness. However, in the past few years, commercially released concert albums have emerged following remastering of radio and television shows, private recordings he commissioned. These include a 1967 cabaret performance from his first tour of Australia; a 1967 BBC concert with Nelson Riddle; a 1966 arena concert before 24,000 people in Manila; and one of his final concerts, recorded on the last night of his fifteenth and final Australian tour in 1984.

His daughter Michele has written a biography, &quot;The Singer&#x27;s Singer: The Life and Music of Matt Monro&quot; and has been instrumental, along with sound engineer Richard Moore, in releasing rare and unreleased material by Matt Monro in recent years.

Through the years, Monro&#x27;s recordings have been featured in radio and television commercials. In July 2020, the Unilever brand Axe began airing an American TV campaign for its deodorant line that spoofed the restrictions on dating during the COVID-19 pandemic, with Monro&#x27;s &quot;Born Free&quot; as the soundtrack theme.

In March 2020, Monro reached No. 8 on the UK Albums Chart with an album of performances with a quintet recorded in New York. These recordings, later overdubbed by Dave Cavenaugh in Hollywood, were released for the first time as Monro wanted them to be.

What would have been Monro&#x27;s 90th birthday in December 2020, was celebrated by his family with the creation of an official YouTube page, and the four part audio documentary, &quot;The Boy from Shoreditch&quot;.

Monro&#x27;s song, Walk Away, is featured in the 2023 television series Funny Woman, set in the mid-1960s.

==Discography==
Most of Monro&#x27;s recordings were produced or overseen by George Martin. Unlike his contemporaries, Monro recorded very few Tin Pan Alley standards during his career. (The exception was &quot;Matt Monro Sings Hoagy Carmichael&quot;, one of his most highly regarded albums.) Instead, he and Martin searched for material written by promising newcomers and commissioned English lyrics for dramatic melodies written by European composers.

Monro also covered many of the most popular stage and screen songs of the 1950s and 1960s. Over the years, his recordings featured arrangements by Sid Feller, Billy May, John Barry, Buddy Bregman, Kenny Clayton and Colin Keyes, and Martin himself. He also had a long and fruitful musical partnership with British arranger Johnnie Spence. Monro also teamed up with American star arrangers Nelson Riddle and Billy May and leading British bandleader Ted Heath, for concerts broadcast by the BBC.

In 1973, Monro released a vocal version of the popular &quot;Van der Valk&quot; TV-series theme titled &quot;And You Smiled&quot;, with lyrics written by Melvyn Taggart. It was his final hit. In 1977, he recorded the Don Black penned, &quot;If I Never Sing Another Song&quot;, which became a latter-day standard among his contemporaries, its lyrics referring to the &quot;heyday&quot; of fan mail, awards, and other trappings of celebrity that had faded for them.

In 1979, Monro recorded his final studio album, the third all-Spanish album produced by Leonardo Schultz and Gary Mason. Schultz and Mason hoped to capitalise on the success of the earlier hit song &quot;Alguien Cantó&quot;, which Leonardo Schultz had adapted to Spanish. The album, entitled &quot;Un Toque De Distinción&quot;, was recorded in George Martin&#x27;s Air London Studios, as well as in Miami, Los Angeles, and New York. The arranger was Kenny Woodman, and it was engineered by Tom Greto. The album was eventually released in 1982. The album was a critical success, and was a hit in various Latin American countries. The song &quot;Volveré Alguna Vez&quot; from the album made it on to the singles chart; the song was subsequently sung by José Feliciano and became a hit.

<doc id="740910" wikidata="Q7337149" url="?curid=740910" title="River Blackwater (River Loddon)">
<text>The River Blackwater is a tributary of the Loddon in England and sub-tributary of the Thames. It rises at two springs in Rowhill Nature Reserve between Aldershot, Hampshire and Farnham, Surrey. It curves a course north then west to join the Loddon in Swallowfield civil parish, central Berkshire. Part of the river splits Hampshire from Surrey; a smaller part does so as to Hampshire and Berkshire.

The source is locally rare heath within the Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area, due to the Farnborough/Aldershot Built-up Area.

After the Blackwater is joined by the Whitewater near Eversley. The river gives its name to the town of Blackwater, extending back from the bank facing Camberley, and the wider urban area including Aldershot, Farnborough, and Camberley is sometimes collectively referred to as the Blackwater Valley.

==Naming==
This article reverses the term found by Ordnance Survey mapmakers, old and continued there, Blackwater River.

A stretch west of Finchampstead is called Long Water in 1897 and on recent maps. The adjacent final section from the Whitewater to the Loddon is known by alternative names. In Ordnance Survey maps: the 1:50,000 calls it as in general; the 1:25,000 calls it (the) Broadwater; the 1:2500 calls it as in general at each end and Broadwater in the middle, reflecting local broadening. This last option was the convention in the 1899 (forerunner) map at that scale.

==Blackwater Valley==
The river runs along the centre of the Blackwater Valley, which is maintained as a largely tree-planted open space, with some bog, marsh and water-meadows. It runs for approximately from the source at Rowhill Nature Reserve near Aldershot in the south, northwards to Swallowfield where the river is joined by the &quot;Whitewater&quot; and then joins the River Loddon. The Loddon flows into the Thames on the southern borders of Wargrave.

For many miles banks of the lower half are semi-rural or rural. The upper half of the river for more than a mile each side is highly urbanised – the river passes Aldershot, Ash, Ash Vale, Frimley, Farnborough, Camberley, Blackwater, Sandhurst and Yateley; the continuous urbanisation extends to Fleet in the west and to Farnham in the south, with a combined population of over 300,000 people at the 2011 Census. Beneath the catchment are chalk, Bagshot Formation sand and greensand aquifers, covered by varying depths of London clay-based soil, mostly very weakly permeable. Some of the water flows from springs from the aquifers, but by far the largest component of the flow is the discharge from five major sewage treatment works on the upper reaches and two smaller ones on the lower reaches. The springs are quite acidic for natural, non-hydrothermal springs. After flowing over the London clay deposits, the underlying geology is more permeable near the mouth, the &quot;Bagshot and Bracklesham&quot; Sands. In 1992, the five works could discharge up to 74.4 Ml per day, and in summer months accounted for around 85% of flow above the confluence with the Whitewater.

The valley has large pockets of deep gravels, quarried since the 1950s. This explains the many lakes in the valley, as old workings (pits) fill with water. Many have been landscaped as park lakes and used for fishing and sailing. A number of them are designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), having rich and diverse ecology. The Blackwater Valley SSSI covers , comprising unimproved alluvial meadows, swamp, and wet woodland. Part of it is managed by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Naturalists Trust. The rest is managed by Bracknell Forest Council, Shepherd Meadows. The river is crossed by a small part of the Basingstoke Canal SSSI, which supports the widest variety of aquatic species in England.

The Valley is the key verdant buffer zone and park amenity for local residents. As well as the SSSIs, there are three nature reserves. Much of the rest of the drainage basin not built upon is ecologically important. Thirty-one &#x27;Wildlife Sites&#x27; have been designated by the local planning authorities and a riverside path has opened up much of the riverbank. A large running club in local ranks use the path regularly.

A cycle route runs alongside the river for most of its length.

==Route==

The Blackwater rises as a series of springs on Rowhill Copse, a nature reserve to the south-west of Aldershot. The site contains a range of habitats, its estate once produced timber and bricks. The river curves east-south-east, passing under the railway line to station, between two lakes, under Badshot Lea Road and past some more lakes, which form part of Tice&#x27;s Meadow nature reserve, a hop farm from 1851 until 1958, after which were quarried by Hanson Aggregates between 1998 and 2010. The site was adopted as a Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI) in 2009, and was restored after quarrying stopped. Beyond, the river sweeps a large curve to head northwards, and is joined by the A331, which follows the valley until past most of the conurbation. From its source up until the three-county tripoint east of Blackwater station, the river almost exactly marks the longstanding boundary between the counties of Surrey and Hampshire.
On the left bank is Aldershot sewage treatment works that in dry weather supplies more than half of the local flow opposite is Willow Park Fishery. The river passes under an aqueduct carrying the Basingstoke Canal, and is then bordered by Lakeside Nature Reserve to the east and Gold Valley Lakes fishery to the west. The A331 road makes the first of the crossings. Further north is Hollybush Park, an ex-sand quarry and deep-set landfill, now an attractive grassland with wild flowers. The lakes to the north were the subject of a Planning Enquiry in 2020, to build 21 floating holiday homes and an equestrian centre. The tree-lined river path is hemmed in by railways, roads, and small lakes and is crossed by the railway line to Farnborough station, continuing north close to the A331, until it reaches junction 4 on the M3 motorway.

After the M3 junction, the river is joined by Cove Brook, which starts as a series of streams near Farnborough Airport and flows northwards. For much of its route it is bordered by housing on both sides, but then passes beneath the North Downs railway line to reach the junction. The tree-lined section immediately afterwards was once a gas works and railway sidings, but is now known as Blackwater Park, as far as the A30 road bridge. The small town of Blackwater is on the left bank and Camberley sewage treatment works is on the right bank at York Town. This was the cause of a serious pollution incident in 2012, when a malfunction resulted in partially treated effluent released, contaminating the river for downstream. This resulted in fish in the Shepherds Meadow SSSI suffocating and dying. Thames Water upgraded the works after the incident.

To the north of the bridge, the river is joined by the Wish Stream demarcating Surrey and Berkshire. This rises at Wishmoor Cross, in a danger area with restricted access, and flows to the south west along Wishmoor Bottom, a pineferous wood-lined, boggy ravine. It is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) because of its populations of Dartford warbler, nightjar and woodlark, and is a nationally important habitat for dragonfly and damselfly. The stream then flows through the grounds of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, entering Bathing Pool, and then passing through a series of engineered ponds and weirs, which create a significant obstacle to the movement of fish, to reach the Lower Lake. This is also supplied with water from the Upper Lake, to the south of the stream. There is a large control structure at the outlet of the Lower Lake, impassable to fish, and then a series of high weirs of that status. Below the grounds of the Academy, the stream flows in a culvert under a car park for a retail outlet, and several more culverts under roads to reach the Blackwater. The confluence used to be the point at the three-county tripoint, but when the Blackwater Valley road was built in 1990, the stream was moved slightly north, for the roundabout that links the A30, A321 and A331 roads.

The river then flows through Shepherd Meadows, an SSSI noted for the Black Poplar tree, and a variety of wild flowers, including sneezewort, knapweed, betony, meadowsweet and great burnet. As the river curves to the west, it passes under the North Downs Line railway bridge, flows past Sandhurst sewage treatment works on the right bank and enters Trilakes Country Park. Former gravel pits flank the river on both sides, and as it passes the village of Finchampstead, the channel is briefly called Long Water. Soon it reaches New Mill, where there is a weir and sluice. The mill was a corn mill in 1871 and produced animal feed until the 1950s, when the building was sold. The watermill and mill house are grade II listed, with parts of the buildings dating from the 15th century. They were subsequently used as a restaurant, with the restored mill wheel, gears and machinery visible from the seating area, encased behind glass screens. The river follows the northern edge of Bramshill Plantation, of woodland managed by the Forestry Commission. It is a Special Protection Area in view of the number of bird species to be found there, and also has large populations of damselflies, dragonflies and silver studded blue butterflies. Notable flora includes marsh clubmoss and pillwort.

The river turns to the north-west, and is joined by the River Whitewater, flowing northwards from Greywell, near Greywell Tunnel, the present end of the Basingstoke Canal. As it approaches Swallowfield, the channel splits and there are weirs on both branches. They enter Swallowfield Park, a grade II listed park and gardens. The park was enclosed by King Edward III in 1354, and remained the property of the monarch until the late 16th century, after which it was privately owned until 1965. The large country house was built in the late 17th century, was altered in 1820, and restored in the 1970s. The house and adjoining stable block are grade II* listed. The main drive to the house crosses the river on a five-arched brick bridge, dating from the late 18th century. The river continues through the park until it reaches the River Loddon.

==Milling==
There is clear evidence for one watermill on the Blackwater, but when the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086 there were four mills in the locality. The manors of Little Bramshill and Great Bramshill had one each, while there were two in the manor of Eversley. By 1237, the manor of Eversley was owned by William de Wauton, who mentioned a mill pond in an agreement he made with a tenant called William Banastre. When a dower was assigned to Ella de Bradeston in 1374, to provide for her should she become widowed, there was only one mill, which was ruined by 1435. There is no subsequent mention of a mill in the records of the manor.

New Mill at Eversley dates in part from the 15th century, with 17th, 19th and 20th century alterations and additions. It is powered by an undershot water wheel, in the mill building. In 1948 it was bought by Squadron Leader Royston Albrecht, who restored it almost single-handedly between 1949 and 1976. He was a member of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, who used the restored mill to produce provender. Some of the machinery is believed to date from 1746, and the wheel drives two pairs of stones. The building was sold in 1995 to become a restaurant, and as part of the conversion process, a refurbished waterwheel was fitted while the machinery was shielded by a glass screen so that it could be seen from the restaurant area. The restaurant became insolvent in 2012 and closed down.

==Ash Aqueduct==
The Basingstoke Canal runs from the Greywell Tunnel at Greywell in the west to the River Wey in the east, and crosses the Blackwater Valley on an embankment in the village of Ash. Thk Blackwater used to flow through a brick culvert under the embankment, but major reconstruction took place over the winter of 1994-95 as part of a project to route the A331 road along the river valley. Because bats were known to roost in the culvert, a new home for them was built on a nearby island. The central section of the embankment was then removed and replaced with a three-span aqueduct, with a centre span of and two side spans of each. The structure was built of post-tensioned concrete, using four cables on each side of the navigation channel, which were jacked apart until each was exerting a force of 820 tonnes to keep the concrete in compression. In order to avoid the aqueduct piers, the river channel was diverted to run through the western side span, and a new course was constructed until the road had risen sufficiently for a box-section culvert to carry the river under the new road to rejoin its original route. The new Ash Aqueduct affords views of the surrounding countryside. In the distance to the south is the Hog&#x27;s Back, which runs between Farnham and Guildford, and is where the North Downs narrows.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measures water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish, and chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations. Chemical status is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the Blackwater system was as follows in 2019.

Reasons for the quality being less than good include discharge from sewage treatment works; drainage from roads and transport infrastructure; contaminated land adjacent to the river; physical barriers such as weirs and impounding of the water which prevent the free migration of fish and other species; and the presence of the North American signal crayfish, an invasive species.

<text>SIGSALY (also known as the X System, Project X, Ciphony I, and the Green Hornet) was a secure speech system used in World War II for the highest-level Allied communications. It pioneered a number of digital communications concepts, including the first transmission of speech using pulse-code modulation.

The name SIGSALY was not an acronym, but a cover name that resembled an acronym—the SIG part was common in Army Signal Corps names (e.g., SIGABA). The prototype was called the &quot;Green Hornet&quot; after the radio show &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, because it sounded like a buzzing hornet, resembling the show&#x27;s theme tune, to anyone trying to eavesdrop on the conversation.

==Development==
At the time of its inception, long-distance telephone communications used the &quot;A-3&quot; voice scrambler developed by Western Electric. It worked on the voice inversion principle. The Germans had a listening station on the Dutch coast which could intercept and break A-3 traffic.

Although telephone scramblers were used by both sides in World War II, they were known not to be very secure in general, and both sides often cracked the scrambled conversations of the other. Inspection of the audio spectrum using a spectrum analyzer often provided significant clues to the scrambling technique. The insecurity of most telephone scrambler schemes led to the development of a more secure scrambler, based on the one-time pad principle.

A prototype was developed at Bell Telephone Laboratories, under the direction of A. B. Clark, assisted by British mathematician Alan Turing, and demonstrated to the US Army. The Army was impressed and awarded Bell Labs a contract for two systems in 1942. SIGSALY went into service in 1943 and remained in service until 1946.

==Operation==
SIGSALY used a random noise mask to encrypt voice conversations which had been encoded by a vocoder. The latter was used to minimize the amount of redundancy (which is high in voice traffic), in order to reduce the amount of information to be encrypted.

The voice encoding used the fact that speech varies fairly slowly as the components of the throat move. The system extracts information about the voice signal 50 times a second (every 20 milliseconds).
* ten channels covering the telephone passband (250 Hz – 2,950 Hz); are rectified and filtered to extract how much energy is in each of these channels.
* another signal indicating whether the sound is voiced or unvoiced;
* if voiced, a signal indicating the pitch; this also varied at less than 25 Hz.

Next, each signal was sampled for its amplitude once every 20 milliseconds. For the band amplitude signals, the amplitude converted into one of six amplitude levels, with values from 0 through 5. The amplitude levels were on a nonlinear scale, with the steps between levels wide at high amplitudes and narrower at low amplitudes. This scheme, known as &quot;companding&quot; or &quot;compressing-expanding&quot;, exploits the fact that the fidelity of voice signals is more sensitive to low amplitudes than to high amplitudes. The pitch signal, which required greater sensitivity, was encoded by a pair of six-level values (one coarse, and one fine), giving thirty-six levels in all.

A cryptographic key, consisting of a series of random values from the same set of six levels, was subtracted from each sampled voice amplitude value to encrypt them before transmission. The subtraction was performed using modular arithmetic: a &quot;wraparound&quot; fashion, meaning that if there was a negative result, it was added to six to give a positive result. For example, if the voice amplitude value was 3 and the random value was 5, then the subtraction would work as follows:

:formula_1

— giving a value of 4.

The sampled value was then transmitted, with each sample level transmitted on one of six corresponding frequencies in a frequency band, a scheme known as &quot;frequency-shift keying (FSK)&quot;. The receiving SIGSALY read the frequency values, converted them into samples, and added the key values back to them to decrypt them. The addition was also performed in a &quot;modulo&quot; fashion, with six subtracted from any value over five. To match the example above, if the receiving SIGSALY got a sample value of 4 with a matching random value of 5, then the addition would be as follows:

:formula_2

— which gives the correct value of 3.

To convert the samples back into a voice waveform, they were first turned back into the dozen low-frequency vocoded signals. An inversion of the vocoder process was employed, which included:
* a white noise source (used for unvoiced sounds);
* a signal generator (used for voiced sounds) generating a set of harmonics, with the base frequency controlled by the pitch signal;
* a switch, controlled by the voiced/unvoiced signal, to select one of these two as a source;
* a set of filters (one for each band), all taking as input the same source (the source selected by the switch), along with amplifiers whose gain was controlled by the band amplitude signals.

The noise values used for the encryption key were originally produced by large mercury-vapor rectifying vacuum tubes and stored on a phonograph record. The record was then duplicated, with the records being distributed to SIGSALY systems on both ends of a conversation. The records served as the SIGSALY &quot;one-time pad&quot;, and distribution was very strictly controlled (although if one had been seized, it would have been of little importance, since only one pair of each was ever produced). For testing and setup purposes, a pseudo-random number generating system made out of relays, known as the &quot;threshing machine&quot;, was used.

The records were played on turntables, but since the timing – the clock synchronization – between the two SIGSALY terminals had to be precise, the turntables were by no means just ordinary record-players. The rotation rate of the turntables was carefully controlled, and the records were started at highly specific times, based on precision time-of-day clock standards. Since each record only provided 12 minutes of key, each SIGSALY had two turntables, with a second record &quot;queued up&quot; while the first was &quot;playing&quot;.

==Usage==
The SIGSALY terminal was massive, consisting of 40 racks of equipment. It weighed over 50 tons, and used about 30 kW of power, necessitating an air-conditioned room to hold it. Too big and cumbersome for general use, it was only used for the highest level of voice communications.

A dozen SIGSALY terminal installations were eventually set up all over the world. The first was installed in the Pentagon building rather than the White House, which had an extension line, as the US President Franklin Roosevelt knew of the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill&#x27;s insistence that he be able to call at any time of the day or night. The second was installed below street level in the basement of Selfridges department store on Oxford Street, London, close to the US Embassy on Grosvenor Square. The first conference took place on 15 July 1943, and it was used by both General Dwight D. Eisenhower as the commander of SHAEF, and Churchill, before extensions were installed to the Embassy, 10 Downing Street and the Cabinet War Rooms. One was installed in a ship and followed General Douglas MacArthur during his South Pacific campaigns. In total during WW2, the system supported about 3,000 high-level telephone conferences.

The installation and maintenance of all SIGSALY machines was undertaken by the specially formed and vetted members of the 805th Signal Service Company of the US Army Signal Corps. The system was cumbersome, but it worked very effectively. When the Allies invaded Germany, an investigative team discovered that the Germans had recorded significant amounts of traffic from the system, but had erroneously concluded that it was a complex telegraphic encoding system.

==Significance==
SIGSALY has been credited with a number of &quot;firsts&quot;; this list is taken from (Bennett, 1983):
# The first realization of enciphered telephony
# The first quantized speech transmission
# The first transmission of speech by pulse-code modulation (PCM)
# The first use of companded PCM
# The first examples of multilevel frequency-shift keying (FSK)
# The first useful realization of speech bandwidth compression
# The first use of FSK-FDM (Frequency Shift Keying-Frequency Division Multiplex) as a viable transmission method over a fading medium
# The first use of a multilevel &quot;eye pattern&quot; to adjust the sampling intervals (a new, and important, instrumentation technique)

<text>Zinc carbonate is the inorganic compound with the formula ZnCO3. It is a white solid that is insoluble in water. It exists in nature as the mineral smithsonite. It is prepared by treating cold solutions of zinc sulfate with potassium bicarbonate. Upon warming, it converts to basic zinc carbonate (Zn5(CO3)2(OH)6).

==Structure==
Zinc carbonate adopts the same structure as calcite (calcium carbonate). Zinc is octahedral and each carbonate is bonded to six Zn centers such that oxygen atoms are three-coordinate.

<text>Sylvite, or sylvine, is potassium chloride (KCl) in natural mineral form. It forms crystals in the isometric system very similar to normal rock salt, halite (NaCl). The two are, in fact, isomorphous. Sylvite is colorless to white with shades of yellow and red due to inclusions. It has a Mohs hardness of 2.5 and a specific gravity of 1.99. It has a refractive index of 1.4903. Sylvite has a salty taste with a distinct bitterness.

Sylvite is one of the last evaporite minerals to precipitate out of solution. As such, it is found only in very dry saline areas. Its principal use is as a potassium fertilizer.

Sylvite is found in many evaporite deposits worldwide. Massive bedded deposits occur in New Mexico and western Texas, and in Utah in the US, but the largest world source is in Saskatchewan, Canada. The vast deposits in Saskatchewan were formed by the evaporation of a Devonian seaway. Sylvite is the official mineral of Saskatchewan.

Sylvite was first described in 1832 at Mount Vesuvius near Napoli in Italy and named after historical KCl designations &quot;sal degistivum Sylvii&quot; and &quot;sal febrifugum Sylvii&quot;, which are named after the Dutch physician and chemist François Sylvius de le Boe (1614–1672).

Sylvite, along with quartz, fluorite and halite, is used for spectroscopic prisms and lenses.

<text>Melanterite is a mineral form of hydrous iron(II) sulfate: FeSO4·7H2O. It is the iron analogue of the copper sulfate chalcanthite. It alters to siderotil by loss of water. It is a secondary sulfate mineral which forms from the oxidation of primary sulfide minerals such as pyrite and marcasite in the near-surface environment. It often occurs as a &quot;post mine&quot; encrustation on old underground mine surfaces. It also occurs in coal and lignite seams exposed to humid air and as a rare sublimate phase around volcanic fumaroles. Associated minerals include pisanite, chalcanthite, epsomite, pickeringite, halotrichite and other sulfate minerals.

It was first described in 1850.

<doc id="740936" wikidata="Q1486590" url="?curid=740936" title="Red Book of Hergest">
<text>The Red Book of Hergest (), Oxford, Jesus College, MS 111, is a large vellum manuscript written shortly after 1382, which ranks as one of the most important medieval manuscripts written in the Welsh language. It preserves a collection of Welsh prose and poetry, notably the tales of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; and Gogynfeirdd poetry. The manuscript derives its name from the colour of its leather binding and from its association with Hergest Court between the late 15th and early 17th century.

== Compilation ==
The manuscript was written between about 1382 and 1410. One of the several copyists responsible for the manuscript has been identified as Hywel Fychan fab Hywel Goch of Buellt. He is known to have worked for ( 1330–1403) of Ynysforgan, Swansea, and it is possible that the manuscript was compiled for Hopcyn.

According to scholar Daniel Huws, it is &quot;by far the heaviest of the medieval books in Welsh, the largest in its dimensions...and the thickest&quot;.

== History ==
The manuscript appears to have been retained by Hopcyn&#x27;s family until the end of the 15th century, when Hopcyn&#x27;s grandson Hopcyn ap Rhys was held complicit in the rebellion against King Edward IV and consequently saw much of his property forfeited. The Vaughans of Tretower (), then in Breconshire, obtained it, probably in 1465 on receiving Hopcyn&#x27;s forfeited possessions. Ownership is suggested by two odes (&quot;awdlau&quot;), dedicated to Sir Thomas Vaughan ( 1483) and his sons, which were written into the manuscript by Welsh poet Lewys Glyn Cothi at Tretower. The &quot;Red Book&quot; soon passed into the possession of the Vaughans of Hergest Court, near Kington in the Welsh Marches. Sir John Price of Brecon reports to have seen the manuscript in 1550, presumably at Hergest. In the late 1560s, William Salesbury found the manuscript in the possession of Sir Henry Sidney at Ludlow, when Siancyn Gwyn of Llanidloes held it on loan from him.

By the early 17th century, the &quot;Red Book&quot; had passed to the Mansels of Margam, hence back in Glamorgan. It was possibly brought into the marriage between Henry&#x27;s granddaughter Catherine Sidney and Sir Lewis Mansel, who is reported to have owned it in 1634. The manuscript was later found in the collection of Thomas Wilkins (d. 1699), a Welsh clergyman and antiquarian, who may have borrowed it from the Mansels without ever returning it. In 1697, Wilkins was visited by Edward Lhuyd who spent some time copying a manuscript which might well have been the &quot;Red Book&quot;.

In 1701, two years after Wilkin&#x27;s death, his son Thomas Wilkins the Younger donated the manuscript to Jesus College, Oxford. Internal evidence, a note by the latter Wilkins, suggests that Edward Lhuyd then held the manuscript on loan, but that the college was able to retrieve it only 13 years later, after Lhuyd&#x27;s death. The book was given on 17 February 1701 to Jesus College by Reverend Thomas Wilkins the younger of Llanblethian. The college keeps the manuscript on deposit at the Bodleian Library.

== Content ==
The first part of the manuscript contains prose, including the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, for which this is one of the manuscript sources, other tales, historical texts (including a Welsh translation of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s ), and various other texts including a series of Triads. The rest of the manuscript contains poetry, especially from the period of court poetry known as Poetry of the Princes ( or ), including the cycles , , and . It contains also poems by Myrddin Wyllt. The Red Book is similar in content to the White Book of Rhydderch, of which it has at times been supposed to be a copy. Both are now thought, however, to descend from a lost common ancestor or ancestors.

The manuscript also contains a collection of herbal remedies associated with Rhiwallon Feddyg, founder of a medical dynasty that lasted over 500 years – &#x27;The Physicians of Myddfai&#x27; from the village of Myddfai just outside Llandovery.

== Influence ==
Some researchers believe that J. R. R. Tolkien borrowed the title for the &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot;, the imagined legendary source of Tolkien&#x27;s tales.

<doc id="740940" wikidata="Q5078543" url="?curid=740940" title="Charles H. Carroll">
<text>Charles Holker Carroll (May 4, 1794 – June 8, 1865) was an American farmer and politician from New York who was a descendant of the Carrolls of Carrollton and married into the Van Rensselaer family.

==Early life==
Carroll was born on May 4, 1794, in Hagerstown, Maryland. He was the son of Charles Carroll of Bellevue (1767–1823) and Anne Sprigg (1769–1837). His siblings included William Thomas Carroll and Elizabeth Barbara Carroll (1806–1866), who was married to Henry Fitzhugh (1801–1866), an Erie Canal Commissioner and member of the New York State Assembly and the sister of Ann Carroll Fitzhugh, wife of Gerrit Smith.

Carroll&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Charles Carroll of Duddington (1729–1773), himself the grandson of Charles Carroll (1661-1720), a native of Ireland who emigrated to Maryland in 1689. His grandfather was the nephew of Charles Carroll of Annapolis and a cousin of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, a signor of the Declaration of Independence.

Along with his parents, the Carroll family left Maryland for Genesee County, New York, in 1811. Carroll graduated from St. Mary&#x27;s College in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1813.

==Career==
He was a member of the New York State Senate (8th D.) from 1827 to 1828, sitting in the 50th and 51st New York State Legislatures. He resigned his seat in March 1828.

He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Livingston Co.) in 1836. He was Chairman of the Whig state convention of 1842. Carroll was known as an admirer of Henry Clay.

He was elected as a Whig to the 28th and 29th United States Congresses, holding office from March 4, 1843, to March 3, 1847. Caroll was not a candidate for renomination in 1846.

===Later life===
After retiring from Congress, Carroll returned to Groveland and managed his large landed estate, &quot;The Hermitage&quot;. He was presidential elector on the American Party ticket in 1856.

==Personal life==
Carroll was married to Alida Maria Van Rensselaer (1801–1832) the daughter of Jeremiah Van Rensselaer (1769–1829). Alida was the niece of Jacob Rutsen Van Rensselaer and the granddaughter of Robert Van Rensselaer (1740–1802). Her older sister, Cornelia Rutsen Van Rensselaer (b. 1798), was married to Rep. Francis Granger. They lived at a homestead known as &quot;The Hermitage&quot; in Groveland, New York. Together, they were the parents of six children, only two of which survived to maturity:

* Henry Carroll (1821–1828), who died young. 
* Charles Carroll (1823–1830), who died young. 
* Cornelia Granger Carroll (1826–1909), who married Edward Philo Fuller (1820–1866), son of Congressman Philo C. Fuller, in 1850.
* Anne Elizabeth Carroll (1828–1905), who married William Dana Fitzhugh (1824–1889), son of Dr. Daniel H. Fitzhugh and nephew of Henry Fitzhugh, in 1849.
* Adeline V. Carroll (1830–1860), who died unmarried.
* Alida Carroll (1831–1831), who died young.

After his wife&#x27;s early death in 1832, her sister, Catharine Schuyler Van Rensselaer (1802–1873), who never married, lived at &quot;The Hermitage&quot; and acted as a second mother to the Carroll girls.

Carroll died in Groveland on June 8, 1865. He was buried at the Williamsburg Cemetery in Groveland.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter Cornelia, he was the grandfather of Sophia Fuller (b. 1854) who married Edwin Forrest Sweet (1847–1935), a Congressman and Mayor of Grand Rapids, Michigan (from 1904 to 1905) and Philo Carroll Fuller (1857–1931), who also served as Mayor of Grand Rapids in 1917. The Sweets were the parents of Carroll Fuller Sweet (b. 1877), George Sweet (b. 1881), Sidney Edward Sweet (b. 1883), Cornelia Van Rensselaer Sweet (b. 1886), Sophia Fuller Sweet (b. 1892).

Through his daughter Anne, he was the grandfather of Anne Fitzhugh (b. 1850), Alida Catharine Fitzhugh, who died in Texas, Carroll Fitzhugh (d. 1880), Cornelia F. Fitzhugh, who married Richard Field Conover (1858–1930), Edward F. Fitzhugh, a chemist.

<doc id="740947" wikidata="Q1478303" url="?curid=740947" title="Phillumeny">
<text>Phillumeny (also known as phillumenism) is the hobby of collecting different match-related items: matchboxes, matchbox labels, matchbooks, matchcovers, matchsafes, etc.

==Matchbox==
A matchbox is a box made of cardboard or thin wood and designed to hold matches. It usually has a coarse striking surface on one edge for lighting the matches contained inside.

==Etymology==
A person who engages in phillumeny is a &quot;phillumenist&quot;. The words, derived from Greek phil- [loving] + Latin lumen- [light], were introduced by the British collector Marjorie S. Evans in 1943 (who later became president of the British Matchbox Label &amp; Booklet Society, now renamed the British Matchbox Label and Bookmatch Society). These two forms have been adopted by many other languages, e.g., &quot;philuméniste&quot;, &quot;fillumenista&quot;, &quot;Filumenist&quot; and филуменист.

==Phillumeny worldwide==

Collecting of matchbox labels emerged together with matches. In some collections it is possible to find labels from chemical matches, produced from 1810 to 1815—long before the modern matches arrived. Quite often people who went abroad brought back matchboxes as souvenirs from other countries. After World War II a lot of match factories worked in close contact with local phillumenists, issuing special non-advertising sets. The hobby became especially widespread from the 1960s through the 1980s. Widespread introduction of bulky (for collectors) cardboard matchboxes with less distinct images on them, much poorer quality of print and, also some social phenomena, made this hobby (like many others, not connected with commerce) much less engaged.

== Notable phillumenists ==
In Japan, Teiichi Yoshizawa was listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s top phillumenist. In Portugal, Jose Manuel Pereira published a series of albums to catalog and display matchbox collections called &quot;Phillalbum&quot;.

<doc id="740955" wikidata="Q13631059" url="?curid=740955" title="Calibration (statistics)">
<text>There are two main uses of the term calibration in statistics that denote special types of statistical inference problems. Calibration can mean
:*a reverse process to regression, where instead of a future dependent variable being predicted from known explanatory variables, a known observation of the dependent variables is used to predict a corresponding explanatory variable;
:*procedures in statistical classification to determine class membership probabilities which assess the uncertainty of a given new observation belonging to each of the already established classes.
In addition, calibration is used in statistics with the usual general meaning of calibration. For example, model calibration can be also used to refer to Bayesian inference about the value of a model&#x27;s parameters, given some data set, or more generally to any type of fitting of a statistical model. As Philip Dawid puts it, &quot;a forecaster is &quot;well calibrated&quot; if, for example, of those events to which he assigns a probability 30 percent, the long-run proportion that actually occurs turns out to be 30 percent.&quot;

==In classification==

Calibration in classification means transforming classifier scores into class membership probabilities. An overview of calibration methods for two-class and multi-class classification tasks is given by Gebel (2009). A classifier might separate the classes well, but be poorly calibrated, meaning that the estimated class probabilities are far from the true class probabilities. In this case, a calibration step may help improve the estimated probabilities. A variety of metrics exist that are aimed to measure the extent to which a classifier produces well-calibrated probabilities. Foundational work includes the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Into the 2020s, variants include the Adaptive Calibration Error (ACE) and the Test-based Calibration Error (TCE), which address limitations of the ECE metric that may arise when classifier scores concentrate on narrow subset of the [0,1] range.

A 2020s advancement in calibration assessment is the introduction of the Estimated Calibration Index (ECI). The ECI extends the concepts of the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to provide a more nuanced measure of a model&#x27;s calibration, particularly addressing overconfidence and underconfidence tendencies. Originally formulated for binary settings, the ECI has been adapted for multiclass settings, offering both local and global insights into model calibration. This framework aims to overcome some of the theoretical and interpretative limitations of existing calibration metrics. Through a series of experiments, Famiglini et al. demonstrate the framework&#x27;s effectiveness in delivering a more accurate understanding of model calibration levels and discuss strategies for mitigating biases in calibration assessment. An online tool has been proposed to compute both ECE and ECI. The following univariate calibration methods exist for transforming classifier scores into class membership probabilities in the two-class case:
* Assignment value approach, see Garczarek (2002)
* Bayes approach, see Bennett (2002)
* Isotonic regression, see Zadrozny and Elkan (2002)
* Platt scaling (a form of logistic regression), see Lewis and Gale (1994) and Platt (1999)
* Bayesian Binning into Quantiles (BBQ) calibration, see Naeini, Cooper, Hauskrecht (2015)
* Beta calibration, see Kull, Filho, Flach (2017)

===In probability prediction and forecasting===

In prediction and forecasting, a Brier score is sometimes used to assess prediction accuracy of a set of predictions, specifically that the magnitude of the assigned probabilities track the relative frequency of the observed outcomes. Philip E. Tetlock employs the term &quot;calibration&quot; in this sense in his 2015 book &quot;Superforecasting&quot;. This differs from accuracy and precision. For example, as expressed by Daniel Kahneman, &quot;if you give all events that happen a probability of .6 and all the events that don&#x27;t happen a probability of .4, your calibration is perfect but your discrimination is miserable&quot;. In meteorology, in particular, as concerns weather forecasting, a related mode of assessment is known as forecast skill.

==In regression==

The &quot;calibration problem&quot; in regression is the use of known data on the observed relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable to make estimates of other values of the independent variable from new observations of the dependent variable. This can be known as &quot;inverse regression&quot;; there is also sliced inverse regression. The following multivariate calibration methods exist for transforming classifier scores into class membership probabilities in the case with classes count greater than two:
* Reduction to binary tasks and subsequent pairwise coupling, see Hastie and Tibshirani (1998)
* Dirichlet calibration, see Gebel (2009)

=== Example ===
One example is that of dating objects, using observable evidence such as tree rings for dendrochronology or carbon-14 for radiometric dating. The observation is caused by the age of the object being dated, rather than the reverse, and the aim is to use the method for estimating dates based on new observations. The problem is whether the model used for relating known ages with observations should aim to minimise the error in the observation, or minimise the error in the date. The two approaches will produce different results, and the difference will increase if the model is then used for extrapolation at some distance from the known results.

<doc id="740957" wikidata="Q2376977" url="?curid=740957" title="Internet censorship in Tunisia">
<text>Internet censorship in Tunisia decreased in January 2011 following the ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The successor acting government removed filters on social networking sites, such as YouTube and Facebook.

The success of the Tunisian Revolution led to increased freedom of expression in Tunisia, a country previously subject to strict censorship, especially online. In March 2011, Reporters Without Borders removed Tunisia and Egypt from its &quot;Internet enemies&quot; list to its list of countries &quot;under surveillance&quot;. However, there are also warnings that Internet censorship in other countries might increase following the events of the Arab Spring.

==Censorship following the Tunisian revolution==
* In 2012 the OpenNet Initiative found no evidence of Internet filtering in the political, social, conflict/security, and Internet tools areas.
* In 2011 Reporters Without Borders listed Tunisia as &quot;Under Surveillance&quot;.

The provisional government of national unity succeeded the government of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. The national unity government immediately proclaimed complete freedom of information and expression as a fundamental principle. On January 17th 2011, Internet censorship was immediately lifted, as President Ben Ali promised in his January 13th address. Some online controls remained in early February.

In May, the Permanent Military Tribunal of Tunis ordered four Facebook pages blocked for attempting &quot;to damage the reputation of the military institution and its leaders&quot;. The Tribunal charged that publishing of video clips, the circulation of comments, and articles attempted to destabilize the trust of citizens in the national army, and to spread disorder and chaos in the country. Resurgence of Internet censorship lead to the resignation of blogger and political activist Slim Amamou from his post as Secretary of State for Youth and Sport on May 23rd.

On May 26th, a court order forced the Tunisian Internet Agency (ATI) to block porn sites on the grounds that they pose a threat to minors and Muslim values. The ATI filed in opposition to block the order. ATI&#x27;s application was rejected on June 13th. The ATI began compliance in stages on June 15th. On August 15th, a Tunisian appeals court upheld the previous decisions requiring the ATI to block access to pornographic websites. The ATI appeal is undergoing an appeals process at the country&#x27;s highest court, The ATI in opposition claimed that it cannot uphold the ruling because it lacks the financial and technical means to implement a sufficient filtering and censorship system.

Reporters Without Borders suggests that porn-site filtering could exacerbate reversals in recently lifted censorship policies. They contend that the provisional government&#x27;s generalized and unspecific filtering infringes the principles of Network neutrality and violate promises made by the Tunisian High Commission for the Realization of Revolutionary Goals, Political Reforms, and Democratic Transition after the Revolution. The ATI&#x27;s appeal is not yet complete.

Tunisia held elections on October 23rd 2011 to create a post-revolution Constituent Assembly. Mongi Marzouk was appointed as Tunisia&#x27;s Minister of Communication Technologies to the newly formed Jebali Cabinet on December 20th 2011. Marzouk&#x27;s early political career demonstrated his will to maintain the provisional government&#x27;s proclamation to freedom of information and expression. On September 4th 2012, at the National Forum on Internet Governance, Marzouk formally lifted Internet censorship in Tunisia and announced that Tunisia has seen the “end of Ammar 404,” a slang term referring to Tunisian Internet censorship at large. Two days later Tunisia attended the Freedom Online Conference in Nairobi, a platform for coalition members to further the agenda of Internet governance. During the conference, Tunisia officially became the third African member in the international coalition. Tunisia continued its promotion of uncensored Internet at the 2012 ICT4ALL Forum, September 17–20th in Hammamet. There, Marzouk declared that bilateral and multilateral discussions would resume in lieu of ICT4ALL&#x27;s Forum policy recommendations for Tunisia&#x27;s socio-economic development.

Cyber activists are skeptical of the new regime&#x27;s policies. Sleh Edine Kchouk, President of the Tunisian Pirate Party, believes that continuous Internet monitoring and Ben Ali-era practices are still present. Following Marzouk&#x27;s announcement to lift Internet censorship, Kchouk notes, “Tunisia has always embraced advanced technologies when it comes to the virtual world, in theory. But in practice, it’s completely different.” In September, the United Nations appealed to Tunisia to operationalize its freedom of expression and information policies with respect to the media. Despite the country&#x27;s latest Internet policy reforms, censorship is allegedly enacted upon media activists that fail to comply with Jebali Cabinet member&#x27;s ideals of Tunisian “tradition” and “culture.”

==Censorship during the Ben Ali regime==

Prior to the Tunisian revolution, Internet censorship in Tunisia was extensive. Tunisia was on Reporters Without Borders&#x27; &quot;Internet enemies&quot; list. The OpenNet Initiative classified Internet filtering as pervasive in the political, social, and Internet tools areas and as selective in the conflict/security area in August 2009.

Ben Ali promised, &quot;a removal of internet restrictions,&quot; among several other promises in a speech shortly before he was forced out.

In addition to filtering Web content, the government of Tunisia utilized laws, regulations, and surveillance to achieve strict control over the Internet. For example, journalists were prosecuted by Tunisia&#x27;s press code, which bans offending the president, disturbing order, and publishing what the government perceives as false news. The government also restricted the media by controlling the registration of print media and licensing of broadcasters, refusing permission to critical outlets, and controlling the distribution public sector advertisement. Journalists are also charged in courts with vague violations of the penal code.

Online dissidents faced severe punishment. For example, human rights lawyer Mohamed Abbou was sentenced to three and a half years in prison in 2005 publishing a report accusing the government of torturing Tunisian prisoners on a banned website.

In a landmark legal case that challenged the Web filtering regime in the country, journalist and blogger Ziad El Hendi filed a legal suit against the Tunisian Internet Agency (ATI) for censoring social networking site Facebook. Facebook was blocked on August 18, 2008, then unblocked on September 2 at the Tunisian President&#x27;s request. The Tunisian Union of Free Radio Stations and the Unionist Freedoms and Rights Observatory joined El Heni in the lawsuit and called Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to testify. The Third District Court of Tunisia, however, dismissed the case, in November 2008 without providing any explanation.

In addition to being blocked in Tunisia, many opposition and dissident Web sites and blogs were victims of hacking attempts and in some cases, successful content removal, and shutting down of servers. Even though it was not clear who was behind these cyber attacks, many Tunisian opposition leaders believed it to be the government. For example, the independent news sites Kalima was hacked into and shut down in October 2008. The eight-year Arabic and French archives were completely destroyed. The site had been blocked since it was launched in 2000. The administrator of the site accused the government of being behind the attack because, as she told the Committee to Protect Journalists, &quot;The only ones who benefit from this attack are the authorities.&quot; She also said, “I would not rule out the possibility that this act was committed by the secret services, with the aid of hackers or pirates based in Tunisia or abroad.&quot; The Web-based newsletter Tunis News and a blog run by a judge (TunisiaWatch) has been subject to similar attacks.

Tunisia did not have specific laws to regulate online broadcasting. As a result, a group of journalists exploited this and launched Tunisia&#x27;s first Internet radio station, Radio 6, on 10 December 2007 to mark the 59th anniversary of the World Declaration of Human Rights.

===Filtering during the Ben Ali regime===

Web filtering in Tunisia was achieved through the use of a commercial software program, SmartFilter, sold by U.S.-based company Secure Computing. Because all fixed-line Internet traffic passed through facilities controlled by ATI, the government was able to load the software onto its servers and filter content consistently across Tunisia&#x27;s eleven ISPs. Tunisia purposefully hid the filtering from Internet users by displaying the standard 404 “File Not Found” error message, which gives no hint that the requested site is being blocked.

A transparent proxy processed every HTTP request sent out and filtered out sites based on host names. Empirical evidence showed that NetApp hardware was used to implement the controls and NetCache.

The OpenNet Initiative carried out tests in Tunisia using the ISPs Planet Tunisie and TopNet. Similar to 2006-2007 test results, 2008-2009 testing revealed pervasive filtering of Web sites of political opposition groups such as:
*Democratic Forum for Labor and Liberty (www.fdtl.org)
*Al-Nadha Movement (www.nahdha.info)
*Tunisian Workers&#x27; Communist Party (www.albadil.org)
*Democratic Progressive Party (pdpinfo.org)

Also blocked were Web sites run by opposition figures such as activist Moncef Marzouki and Web sites that contain oppositional news and politics such as:
* www.nawaat.org
*www.perspectivestunisiennes.net
*www.tunisnews.com
*www.tunezine.com

Web sites that publish oppositional articles by Tunisian journalists were also blocked. For example, ONI verified the blocking of the French daily Libération Web site in February 2007 because of articles by Tunisian journalist Taoufik Ben Brik critical of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali appeared on the site.

Also blocked were Web sites that criticize Tunisia&#x27;s human rights record. These include the web sites of:
* Amnesty International (www.amnesty.org)
*Freedom House (www.freedomhouse.org)
*Reporters Without Borders (www.rsf.org and www.rsf.fr)
*International Freedom of Expression eXchange (www.ifex.org)
*the Islamic Human Rights Commission (www.ihrc.org)
*the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (www.hrinfo.org)

Although the home page of Human Rights Watch (HRW) was accessible, the Arabic and French versions of a Human Rights Watch report on Internet repression in Tunisia were blocked.

The prominent video sharing Web sites youtube.com and dailymotion.com were blocked, apparently because Tunisian activists used them to disseminate content critical of the regime&#x27;s human rights practices. The Web site of the OpenNet Initiative (opennet.net), which researches and documents state filtering and censorship practices, was blocked. Also blocked was the Web site of Global Voices (globalvoices.org), a non-profit global citizens’ media project. Most of the tested sites in the anonymizers and circumvention tools category were also blocked. These include:
* Psiphon (https://web.archive.org/web/20080101102040/http://psiphon.civisec.org/)
*TOR (https://www.torproject.org/)
*Anonymizer (www.anonymizer.com)
*email privacy service provider Steal the Message (www.stealthmessage.com)
*Guardster (www.guardster.com/)
*JAP (anon.inf.tu-dresden.de)

The filtering regime pervasively filtered pornographic content, several gay and lesbian information or dating pages, and several online translation services. Also blocked were a few Web sites that criticize the Quran (thequran.com) and Islam (www.islameyat.com), though the small number points to limited filtering of religious content in Tunisia.

Starting in May 2010, the popular Skype VOIP application that is heavily used by Tunisian expats to stay in touch with their families went offline in Tunisia due to ATI&#x27;s throttling of SIP traffic.

ATI&#x27;s blocking of SIP traffic has made life very difficult for call centers, whose main business is taking calls to/from French speaking Europe. Most (if not all) call centers serving Europe used SIP, often with minutes bought from European (mostly French) providers. Blocking SIP traffic resulted in many job losses in Tunisia.

===Surveillance during the Ben Ali regime===

The Tunisian authorities practiced different sorts of Internet surveillance and request that service providers such as Internet cafés be partners in controlling Internet use. For example, the authorities monitored Internet cafés, required Internet users to show IDs before they could use the Internet in some regions, and held Internet café operators responsible for their clients’ online activities. 

There was also technical surveillance where downloading or e-mail attachments went through a central server. In order to protect public order and national security, a 1998 post and telecommunications law allowed authorities to intercept and check the content of email messages. Filtering of e-mail messages of government opponents has been reported. Global Voices Advocacy Director and Tunisia Activist Sami Ben Gharbia conducted a test from the Netherlands with two Tunisia-based activists and confirmed by logging into their e-mail accounts from the Netherlands that what he saw was not what the activists saw when they logged in from Tunisia, and that they could not access all of the messages they received. In early 2011 there was increasing evidence that the private e-mail accounts of Tunisian citizens along with login details of their Facebook pages had been targeted by phishing scripts put in place by the government.
There were increasing incidences of censorship in this manner as many dissidents were blocked from using the internet.

<doc id="740966" wikidata="Q454958" url="?curid=740966" title="Carlos Lopes">
<text>Carlos Alberto de Sousa Lopes (, born 18 February 1947) is a Portuguese former long-distance runner and world-record holder in the marathon. He won the marathon at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, becoming Portugal&#x27;s first Olympic gold medalist, the oldest ever Olympic marathon winner at the age of 37, and setting an Olympic record for the event which stood for 24 years. On 20 April 1985, Lopes set the men&#x27;s marathon world record at 2:07:12 at the Rotterdam Marathon. At club level, he competed for Sporting CP.

Regarded as one of the greatest Portuguese athletes of all-time, Lopes is the last European to hold the men&#x27;s marathon world-record, between 1985 and 1988. He won two Olympic medals, three World Cross Country Championships (1976, 1984, 1985), two national 10,000 metres championships (1970, 1978), two national 5000 metres championships (1968, 1983) and one national 3000 metres steeplechase championship (1975).

==Early life==
Carlos Lopes was born on 18 February 1947 in Vildemoinhos, near Viseu, Portugal. He was the first child in a family with eight children. To help with the family&#x27;s financial struggles, he started working at age 13, taking several jobs such as stonemason&#x27;s assistant and metalworker.

Lopes wanted to play football at local club Lusitano, but his father opposed it, so he turned to other sports. In 1967, he was invited to join the athletics team of Sporting Clube de Portugal, where his coach was Mário Moniz Pereira, and remained there until the end of his career in 1985.

==Career==
Lopes won the World Cross Country Championships in Chepstow, Wales in 1976.

At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Lopes competed in the 10,000 metres. In the race, Lopes set the pace from the 4000 metres mark, and the only athlete to follow him was defending double Olympic champion Lasse Virén. Virén passed Lopes with a lap to go to win the gold medal, and Lopes finished a comfortable second.

During the race, Lopes ran the first 5,000 metres in 14:08.94, and the second 5,000 metres in 13:36.23, a remarkable proof of his ability to steadily accelerate his pace. What he generally lacked in the track races, however, was an ability to sharply increase his pace in the final lap or so.

In the following year, Lopes finished second to Leon Schots in World Cross Country Championships in Düsseldorf, Germany.

Afterward, Lopes had several injuries and did not qualify for 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.

In 1982, Lopes returned to top form, and in Oslo, Norway, he broke the 10,000 metres European record with a time of 27:24.39, which belonged to his teammate Fernando Mamede.

At the 1982 European Athletics Championships in Athens, Greece, Lopes finished fourth in the 10,000 metres with a time of 27:47.95, behind the winner Alberto Cova. During the race, he set the pace from 6,000 metres to 9,800 metres before being overtaken on the final lap.

Lopes attempted his first marathon at the 1982 New York City Marathon, but he did not finish due to an accident in which he ran into a spectator.

In 1983, he finished second at the World Cross Country Championships in Gateshead, England.

Lopes ran his second marathon at the Rotterdam Marathon in 1983. He finished second in a European record time of 2:08:39, two seconds behind the race winner, Robert de Castella. He then decided to run the 10,000 metres at the 1983 World Championships in Helsinki, Finland, where he finished sixth behind the winner Alberto Cova. After that he decided to concentrate on the marathon and cross country.

In 1984, Lopes won his second World Cross Country Championships in East Rutherford, United States. In Stockholm, Sweden, he paced teammate Fernando Mamede to break Henry Rono&#x27;s 10,000 metres world record of 27:22.50. Mamede won in 27:13.81 with Lopes finishing second in 27:17.48.

===Olympic champion===
An accident almost prevented Lopes from participating in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles when, a week before the Games, he was run over by a car in Lisbon but he was not hurt.

The Olympic marathon at Los Angeles was run in very warm conditions, and as the favorites gradually fell away, Lopes won the gold medal with a 200 metres advantage and in an Olympic record time of 2:09:21 at the age of 37. This victory established his reputation as a world class runner, because he ran the last at an average speed of 2:55 per km (4:42 per mile), a remarkably quick pace at the end of a marathon. Lopes&#x27; Olympic record stood until the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, when Kenyan Sammy Wanjiru won with a time of 2:06:32.

In 1985, Lopes won the World Cross Country Championships in Lisbon, Portugal for the third and final time in his career.

===Marathon world record===
In the last major competitive race of his career, the 1985 Rotterdam Marathon, Lopes took 53 seconds off the world&#x27;s best marathon time with a winning time of 2:07.12, and becoming the first man to run 42.195 km in less than 2:08.00.

==Honours==
* Knight of the Order of Prince Henry (23 December 1977)
* Officer of the Order of Prince Henry (4 July 1984)
* Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry (26 October 1984) 
* Grand Cross of the Order of Prince Henry (24 August 1985)

==Popular culture==
Lopes appears in the 14th episode of season 12 of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, where Homer learns in a documentary that Lopes is the oldest ever winner of the Olympic marathon, at 38, and inspires Homer, who claims to be almost his age, to enter the Springfield Marathon. Lopes was actually 37 when he won the 1984 Olympic marathon.

<doc id="740968" wikidata="Q229606" url="?curid=740968" title="Anna Vissi">
<text>Anna Vissi (, , ; born 20 December 1957) is a Greek Cypriot singer and songwriter. She studied music at conservatories and performed locally before moving to the professional scene in Athens, in 1973, where she signed with Minos and simultaneously collaborated with other musical artists and released promotional singles of her own while studying at the University of Athens. She has represented Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1980 and 2006, and Cyprus in 1982.

Vissi established herself in the recording industry by winning the Thessaloniki Song Festival in 1977 with the song &quot;As Kanoume Apopse Mian Arhi&quot; and releasing the eponymous debut album. Since the 1980s, Vissi began a nearly exclusive collaboration with songwriter Nikos Karvelas, to whom she was married from 1983 to 1992 and had one child with, resulting in one of the most successful music partnerships in the nation&#x27;s history. Together they created the label CarVi, which resulted in legal issues with EMI Greece, and they then moved to CBS Records Greece, which later became Sony Music Greece.

Over the course of her career she has released over two dozen albums, most of which have been certified at least gold in the two countries and has also starred in three theatrical productions and briefly ventured into television and radio. Vissi experimented with different styles of music; after becoming one of the first Greek artists to introduce Western pop and dance elements into Greek laïko and entehno, she became one of the most prominent portrayers of the laïko-pop hybrid genre and culture that was thriving from the mid-1990s into the mid-2000s. She landed her biggest commercial success with &quot;Fotia&quot; (1989), followed by the double &quot;Kravgi&quot; (2000), which became the eighth best-selling album of all time in terms of units, while five others – &quot;Kitrino Galazio&quot; (1979), &quot;I Epomeni Kinisi&quot; (1985), &quot;Klima Tropiko&quot; (1996), &quot;Travma&quot; (1997), and &quot;Antidoto&quot; (1998) – have also achieved six figure sales.

She has a large number of successful singles most of which have become classics, including &quot;Inai Kati Stigmes&quot;, &quot;Tha Borousa&quot;, &quot;Dodeka&quot;, &quot;Methismeni Politia&quot;, &quot;Oso Exo Foni&quot;, &quot;Pragmata&quot;, &quot;Agapi Ipervoliki&quot;, &quot;Psihedelia&quot;, &quot;Ta Mathitika Hronia&quot;, &quot;Treno&quot;, &quot;Stin Pira&quot;, &quot;Atmosfaira Ilektrismeni&quot; , &quot;Gkazi&quot; and many many more. Through the years she kept a strong fan base, sold-out tours
and shows (as was her latest shows in Rex in winter 2011–12 and Hotel Ermou 2015–2016 which was the most successful of the year).
Since the late 1990s, Vissi has also made attempts at establishing a career abroad, most of which fell through and have had some negative repercussions on her domestic career. However, she struck some success with her 2005 single &quot;Call Me&quot;, which made her the first Greek or Cypriot artist to top the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play Chart.

Vissi has won six Arion Music Awards, 15 Pop Corn Music Awards, and nine MAD Video Music Awards. Vissi has received 37 Platinum and 16 Gold certifications from IFPI Greece and has become one of the country&#x27;s best-selling artists of all time, having sold over 9 million records worldwide and is one of the country&#x27;s top earning artists. Alpha TV ranked Vissi as the second top-certified female artist in Greece in the phonographic era (since 1960), behind Haris Alexiou, while &quot;Forbes&quot; listed her as the 15th most powerful and influential celebrity in Greece and fourth highest ranked singer.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Anna Vissi was born on 20 December 1957 in Larnaca. She began singing from a very early age, starting her formal musical studies at the age of six at a local conservatory.

At the age of twelve she entered a talent competition and won first prize. Two years later, she was the main singer at Ayia Tilliria, which was also her first TV appearance. In 1973, her family moved to Athens, where she was able to pursue her studies at the National Conservatory. She would eventually appear with a number of well-known Greek singers, such as George Dalaras, Haris Alexiou, and Vasilis Papakonstantinou, in the famous nightclubs of Plaka, in Athens. During this time she also studied law at the University of Athens. Her first important collaboration, alongside George Dalaras, was with composer Stavros Koujioumtzis. Koujioumtzis composed two songs for Vissi, &quot;S&#x27; Agapo&quot; (&quot;I Love You&quot;) and &quot;Sta Hronia tis Ipomonis&quot; (&quot;In The Years of Patience&quot;). She also collaborated with many important Greek composers such as Mikis Theodorakis (1974/1975), Georgios Hadjinassios (1974), Doros Giorgiadis (1974), Nikos Karvelas (who later became her husband; 1975) and Mihalis Terzis (1976).

=== Career beginnings ===
In 1977, she went on tour with George Dalaras and Haris Alexiou, giving concerts with the most notable at the Rainbow, London (June). In the same year, she released her first studio album named &quot;As Kanoume Apopse Mian Arhi&quot; and won the prize for best singer and best song (&quot;As Kanoume Apopse Mian Arhi&quot;) of the year at the Annual Song Festival of Thessaloniki (Palais des Sports). In 1978 she was proposed by ERT (Greek National Television) to represent Greece at the 23rd Eurovision Song Contest. There were two candidate songs: &quot;Poso S&#x27; Agapo&quot; and &quot;O Kyrios Nobel&quot;. Finally, due to controversies between the composers of the songs, her participation was disqualified and Tania Tsanaklidou went to the contest. Her second album &quot;Kitrino Galazio&quot; was released in 1979 and produced the hit &quot;Aftos Pou Perimeno&quot; (&quot;The one I&#x27;m waiting for&quot;). The album reached platinum status and became the best-selling record of the year in Greece.

=== 1980–1982: Eurovision Song Contest and album releases ===
In 1980, Vissi participated in the 25th Eurovision Song Contest representing Greece with the song &quot;Autostop&quot; (&quot;Hitch-Hike&quot;), finishing 13th with 30 points. In the same year she released her third album &quot;Nai&quot; (&quot;Yes&quot;) reaching gold status with 50,000 units sold. The album produced the hits &quot;Oso Eho Foni&quot; (&quot;As long as I have my voice&quot;) and &quot;Methysmeni Politeia&quot; (&quot;Drunken state&quot;). One year later her fourth, self-titled album &quot;Anna Vissi&quot; was released, reaching gold status. In 1982, she represented her native Cyprus at the 27th Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;Mono i agapi&quot; (&quot;Only love&quot;), which ended fifth with 85 points scoring Cyprus its second highest position to date. The English version of &quot;Mono i agapi&quot;, released as a 7-inch single in 1982, titled &quot;Love Is A Lonely Weekend&quot; and its B-side &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be A Fool for You&quot; remain unreleased on CD. The same year in December she released her limited run fifth studio album &quot;Eimai To Simera Kai Eisai To Chthes&quot; by the short-lived record label Vissi and Nikos Karvelas formed for the release known as CarVi, whose name was a combination of their last names.

===1983–1989: Collaboration with Nikos Karvelas ===
In May 1983, she married Nikos Karvelas, a composer, with whom she collaborated in 1975 and in November she gave birth to her daughter Sofia. After their marriage, she started a close collaboration with Karvelas. Since 1975, all her releases have become gold or platinum and have included songs by Karvelas. In 1986, she participated at the Cypriot National Final for Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;Thelo Na Gino Star&quot; (&quot;I Want To Be A Star&quot;), taking second place.

In 1984, Vissi left EMI Greece and signed with CBS Records Greece, which later became Sony Music Greece, a collaboration that lasted until 2013. In March 1984, she released &quot;Na &#x27;Hes Kardia&quot; (&quot;If You Had a Heart&quot;). The album was certified gold. The following year her seventh album &quot;Kati Simveni&quot; (&quot;Something Is Happening&quot;) was released which included one of her most famous songs, titled &quot;Dodeka&quot; (&quot;Twelve (O&#x27;Clock)&quot;) and reached gold status selling 80.000 units. In 1986 &quot;I Epomeni Kinisi&quot; (&quot;The Next Move&quot;) was released. The album included the hit &quot;Pragmata&quot; (&quot;Things&quot;) and went platinum, becoming the best selling record of the year. In February 1988, she released her ninth album &quot;Tora&quot; (&quot;Now&quot;) and in December the album &quot;Empnefsi!&quot; (&quot;Inspiration!&quot;) which went gold.

In 1988, she made her debut as a radio producer on ANT1 Radio. Her radio program was titled after one of her songs &quot;Ta Koritsia Einai Atakta&quot; (&quot;Girls Are Naughty&quot;) and was aired every weekend. In the same year, she participated with the song &quot;Klaio&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Crying&quot;) at the Greek National Final for Eurovision Song Contest, finishing third. In 1989, she released the successful studio album &quot;Fotia&quot; (Fire), being one of the first albums to feature western sounds. The lead single &quot;Pseftika&quot; (&quot;Fake&quot;) became a hit and the album reached platinum status, selling 180.000 copies and becoming the second best selling record of 1990. She performed at Diogenis Palace in that same year, Athens&#x27;s biggest nightclub/music hall at the time.

=== 1990–1995: Theatrical work and television ===

In the early 1990s, she continued performing around Greece with Nikos Karvelas, with appearances at &quot;Diogenis Palace&quot; and then at &quot;Rex&quot;. In November 1991, Vissi and Karvelas starred in the first Greek rock opera, &quot;Daimones&quot; (&quot;Demons&quot;). Vissi described it as an &quot;artistic achievement&quot; in her career; however, the play received mostly negative reviews from professional critics and contributed to the relatively unsuccessful period Vissi faced in the early 1990s. A year later, in October 1993, Vissi landed the leading role of Aphrodite, in the one-act opera &quot;Ode to the Gods&quot; by Stavros Sideras. It was held only once in Limassol, Cyprus, during the celebrations for the Commonwealth Day. Over the following years, Karvelas and Vissi released the albums &quot;Lambo&quot; (1992), &quot;Emeis&quot; (1992), &quot;Live!&quot; (1993), &quot;Re!&quot; (1994), and &quot;O! Kypros&quot; (1995), an album with traditional Cypriot songs.

In 1994, she was the hostess on the ANT1 weekly TV show &quot;Me Agapi, Anna&quot;. The show was cancelled and in 2008 the production company filed a lawsuit against Vissi claiming &quot;unprofessional behavior of the singer&quot; because the agreement was for 40 episodes and Vissi dropped out after 10 episodes. The legal conflict between Vissi and the production company appeared to come to an end when the Court of Appeal of Athens led to the final compromise of the two sides to the sum of €400,000. A sum that the singer would supposed to pay in the company against the initial sum of 2.3 million Euros. Vissi was vindicated by the decision of Supreme Court that halved the €400,000 that Vissi was ultimately required to pay.

===1996–1998: &quot;Klima Tropiko&quot;, &quot;Travma&quot;, and &quot;Antidoto&quot;===
In February 1996, Vissi released the triple-platinum album &quot;Klima Tropiko&quot;. The album featured a new sound for Anna Vissi. It has sold 105 thousand copies as of 2009. After giving more than 40 concerts all over Greece, she started winter appearances at club &quot;Chaos&quot;. In February 1997, Vissi won three Greek Music Awards: Best Female Singer, Best Interpretation, and Biggest Airplay Song.

In April 1997, Vissi released &quot;Travma&quot; which went gold in twelve days and triple platinum in six months, eventually selling 170 thousand copies.

For the winter of 1997–1998, Vissi made appearances at club Gazi. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, by invitation of the Mayor of Athens, she performed in the Parliament Square in front of more than 20,000 people, an event which was broadcast on TV all over Greece and Cyprus. In March 1998, Vissi broke a record, winning seven Greek Music Awards for her album &quot;Travma&quot;.

A couple of months later, a new CD single was released with the songs &quot;Crush&quot;, &quot;Mavra Gyalia&quot; and &quot;Eleni&quot;, as well as a re-release of her multi-platinum album &quot;Travma&quot;, with a bonus CD containing songs from previous albums, only in Australia.
In April 1998, Vissi released her album titled &quot;Antidoto&quot;, which sold more than 80,000 copies in just a week, breaking all previous records to that point. The album eventually achieved triple platinum status, having sold 130 thousand copies as of 2009. During the summer of 1998, Vissi presented a show at club &quot;Asteria&quot;.

Later that year, Vissi gave a charity concert at the Presidential Palace in Cyprus, with the presidential orchestra of the Russian Confederacy (Telethon) and continued with two concerts in London, in February 1999 (Forum Music Theatre, Palladium Theatre). Shortly after, there was also a mini-tour in the US, giving concerts in Los Angeles, Atlantic City, Chicago, Boston and New York (Madison Square Garden).

In New York City, Vissi performed a mini-concert for her fans at the Virgin Megastore in Times Square. This performance was part of a series of events hosted by the Virgin Megastore, promoting some of the world&#x27;s biggest stars, with Vissi being the only Greek singer to receive this honour. The event was promoted throughout the tri-state area by KTU (radio station) and was part of &quot;Anna Vissi day&quot; at the biggest Virgin Megastore in the USA.

===2000–2001: Performances and &quot;Everything I Am&quot; and &quot;Kravgi&quot;===
Followed by a short break from music, in April 2000 Vissi performed at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, at the so-called &quot;millennium show,&quot; singing in front of people from Sony International, marketing managers from Europe, and fans from the United Kingdom.

On 13 May 2000, she performed as a special guest star in her native Cyprus, at the 49th annual Miss Universe Pageant which took place at the Eleftheria Stadium in Nicosia. She sang for the very first time her song &quot;On a Night Like This&quot;, a song who turned world famous at the version record by Kylie Minogue and included in Minogue&#x27;s album &quot;Light Years&quot;

Some months later, her first international single was released titled &quot;Everything I Am&quot;, containing the original version and three remixes of the song (Almighty Mix, Eiffel 65 RMX, Groove Brothers Remix), and a song with both Greek and English lyrics called &quot;Moro Mou, No Tomorrow&quot;. She also filmed her first music video of a song off that single, directed by Antti Jokinen (Solar films, Finland), that cost 80,000,000 drachmas (US$310,000).

Apart from the English-language single, she also released the Greek-language single &quot;Agapi Ipervoliki&quot; on an EP of the same name containing six new songs. It became triple platinum and finally settled at four-times platinum. To promote the single, she started appearances at &quot;Asteria&quot; club with Karvelas and the boy band ONE, with Shaun Fernandez as the choreographer.

In September 2000, she gave a charity concert at the GSP Stadium in Nicosia, in front of 12,000 people, with ONE and a group of dancers from Sony International. At the same year, she released her internationally distributed English-language album &quot;Everything I Am&quot;, which although started as ambition effort to launch an international career. A week after its release in Greece, the album reached gold status (20,000+ copies), while Australia, South Africa, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Turkey, Finland, Norway, and Asia started to promote it with little success.

In November 2000, &quot;Kravgi&quot; was released. It was a double album with 24 new songs and included a duet with Katy Garbi. It reached 3× platinum status in one month, setting a record, and eventually went seven-times platinum, having sold 175 thousand copies (350 thousand units) as of 2009, making it the best-selling album of the 2000s decade and the eighth best-selling of all time in terms of unit sales in Greece.

Some months later, she started appearances with Garbi and ONE at &quot;Fever&quot;, while she accepted the invitation of the Mayor of Athens to perform in the Parliament Square, at the celebrations of the 2001 New Year&#x27;s Eve.

On 6 June 2001, she was the main singer in a production in Bucharest (Unirii square, nearby river Dambovitei) along with the No Smoking band and the cinema director and producer Emir Kusturica. The concert (2001, Peace Odyssey) included a multimedia show, opening with a water screen. More than 150,000 people were present. Kusturica along with producer and director Angelos Hadjiandreou undertook the artistic direction of the event, marrying music with the most modern expression of art.

Three months later, on 5 September 2001, she gave a concert in Cyprus (GSP Stadium), singing in front of more than 18,000 viewers, for more than three hours where she was awarded for the seven-times platinum &quot;Kravgi&quot;.

===2002–2004: &quot;Mala&quot;, &quot;Chi&quot;, and &quot;Paraksenes Eikones&quot;===

In early 2002, Vissi starred in the musical &quot;Mala – I Mousiki Tou Anemou&quot;, based on a true love story that took place during World War II in Auschwitz, between Mala Zimetbaum and Edward Galiñski. The play, which was staged at Pallas Theatre in Athens, it was written by Karvelas, directed by Giannis Kakleas and was accompanied by a symphony orchestra conducted by Giorgos Niarhos. &quot;Mala&quot; premiered on 19 January. The production and Vissi&#x27;s performance was praised by critics, although some of them found it hard to accept that the biggest pop star of Greece was giving the audience such a well made artistic spectacle. Pallas Theatre was sold out through the play&#x27;s 3 month run.

The musical was shown on Mega Channel a year later. An album containing the songs performed at the play was also released and charted, reaching gold status in Greece and platinum in Cyprus.

In late 2002, Vissi released the album &quot;Chi&quot;, which was produced by George De Angelis. Shortly after, the album was featured on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Music Room&quot;, where they talked about how the album reached number one in Greece. The album quickly reached number one on the IFPI charts, and was certified 2× platinum. In the winter of 2002–2003, she was working at &quot;Fever&quot; club in Athens, performing with Yiannis Parios.

In May 2003, Vissi performed with Nikos Karvelas and Irini Merkouri at &quot;Boom&quot; in Thessaloniki. On 15 July 2003, Vissi gave a concert at &quot;A Plaz Voulas/Apollonies Aktes&quot;, with special guest star Nikos Karvelas. In September 2003, Vissi gave another concert in Cyprus, at the Tzirion Stadium in Limassol, to celebrate her 30-year-old career. At the same year, she was awarded with a prize for her whole contribution from the Cyprus Paralympic Organization, while a square in Larnaca was named after her. She also met and talked with the president of the Republic of Cyprus, in the Presidential Palace, in Nicosia.

Just before 2004, on 5 December 2003, Vissi released the double album &quot;Paraksenes Eikones&quot; which went 2× platinum in six months. This was Vissi&#x27;s first album since 1981&#x27;s &quot;Anna Vissi&quot; that included songs written by other composers besides Nikos Karvelas. The album produced many hits. To promote the album, she started appearing at &quot;Diogenis Studio&quot; for the winter season 2003–2004, with Konstantinos Christoforou, Nino and girl band Hi-5.

=== 2004–2005: &quot;Call Me&quot; and &quot;Nylon&quot; ===
On 31 March 2004, Vissi performed in the Liberty Square in Nicosia, at a concert part of the celebrations for Cyprus&#x27;s entry at the European Union, after an official invitation from the Republic of Cyprus. In May 2004, she went on a small tour in England and the United States, with Labis Livieratos (with whom she collaborated in the early 1990s), while in July, her album &quot;Paraksenes Eikones&quot; was re-released with a bonus CD single called &quot;Remixes 2004&quot;, which went gold.

On 29 August 2004, Vissi performed at the closing ceremony of the XXVIII Olympiad, in Athens. She then gave a concert in Cyprus on 3 September, at the GSP Stadium in Nicosia, where she sang for the first time her new English song called &quot;Call Me&quot;. 
On 20 December 2004, Vissi released a live album and DVD, which went platinum in its first week of release. It sold 40 thousand copies. After that concert, she moved to the United States, for the preparation and promotion of her single &quot;Call Me&quot;. In the United States, the single was released by Moda Records, which, during its collaboration with Vissi, was called Vanilla/Moda Records. It features twelve remixes, and went to number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Music Club Play chart and number two on the Billboard Hot Dance Airplay chart. Vissi then performed at the Copacabana in New York for the KTU PartyGras. During the winter and through to the summer of 2005, she went around to clubs as part of her Mini-USA Tour to promote &quot;Call Me&quot;. Some of the clubs included &quot;Central&quot;, &quot;Mirage&quot;, &quot;DNA&quot;, &quot;The Sound Garden&quot; and &quot;Studio 9&quot;.

In July 2005, Vissi returned to Greece and released &quot;Call Me&quot; as a CD single by Sony BMG, along with a new English-language song titled &quot;Lie&quot;. The single reached number one on the IFPI singles charts and achieved gold certification. In that same month, Vissi started recording her new Greek album. In August 2005, she took to the stage of the &quot;Coca-Cola Sound-Wave&quot;, which was held in Mykonos. There she sang her new English song &quot;Lie&quot; and surprised fans and media by appearing on stage with half her head shaved. This performance was considered by many to be her comeback to the Greek music scene after an absence of more than a year.

On 27 September 2005, Vissi released a new Greek album titled &quot;Nylon&quot;. The album went platinum within 24 hours of its release and peaked at number one on the IFPI Greek Top 50 albums chart, selling 40 thousand copies. Shortly after, in October 2005, the album was released as a dual disc, the first ever to be released in Greece. The dual disc version featured special footage from her and Nikos Karvelas in the studio. In the album, there is a song featuring the lead singer of the Greek hip-hop band Goin&#x27; Through called &quot;Erota I Polemo&quot; (&quot;Love or War&quot;). On 24 November 2005, Vissi started performances at &quot;Votanikos&quot; club in Athens, Greece with Goin&#x27; Through, Dimitris Korgialas and Despina Olympiou, which lasted until March 2006.

=== 2006–2007: Eurovision Song Contest and World Tour===
Greek national broadcaster ERT chose Vissi to represent Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. There were four candidate songs, which she sang during a song selection show on 14 March 2006 at &quot;Votanikos&quot; club. Greek viewers used televote and SMS messages along with a panel of judges to choose the song Vissi would sing in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006.

Two of the competing songs, were composed by Nikos Karvelas, namely &quot;Everything&quot; and &quot;Who Cares about Love&quot;, with Vissi herself penning the lyrics to &quot;Everything&quot;. The third song, &quot;A Beautiful Night&quot;, was written by composing group Pigassos, while the last song, &quot;Welcome to the Party&quot;, was written by Greek composer Dimitris Kontopoulos. &quot;Everything&quot; was selected as the entry song of Greece, winning 47.79% of the votes. The day after the final, Vissi filmed the song&#x27;s music video. Her previous record label, Minos EMI, released a CD single of her two prior Eurovision entries &quot;Autostop&quot; and &quot;Mono i agapi&quot;, shortly after.

After the filming of the song&#x27;s music video was completed, Vissi embarked on a promotional tour across Europe starting on 12 April 2006 with Russia. She also visited Malta, Cyprus, Albania, Serbia &amp; Montenegro, Romania, Spain, Netherlands, Sweden, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Belgium, and ended her tour on 10 May 2006 in Israel.

On 19 April 2006 she released a CD single for her Eurovision entry &quot;Everything&quot;. It featured the original version of &quot;Everything&quot; and a remix of it by DJ Valentino and Christodoulos Siganos.

=== 2008–2009: &quot;Apagorevmeno&quot; ===
On New Year&#x27;s Day, Vissi kicked off the new year by holding a large concert in Larnaca, Cyprus.

She spent a large portion of 2007 and 2008 recording her English album. In an interview with fans, she discussed the album, describing it as &quot;a rock album with unbelievably nice songs, that some of the biggest people in the USA music industry worked on. It is an album that could only be made in the USA, that represents who I am, and I believe that this album will be a big plus in my career so far.&quot; It was revealed that the album will be released in the first half of 2009.

In February 2008, Vissi signed to Maple Jam Music Group for the management of the release of her upcoming Greek and English albums. In April 2008, MAD TV hosted a competition for its &quot;Greek Week&quot;, in which visitors to their website were able to vote for their ten favourite Greek music videos, with the winners being showcased in a special &quot;Greek Top 30 Countdown&quot; on 20 April. Vissi was the most nominated artist with thirteen music videos, and managed to secure the number one position with &quot;Treno&quot;, while &quot;Agapi Ipervoliki&quot; came in at number four when the top 30 were announced.

On 28 June 2008, Vissi posted the song &quot;Diri Dakta&quot;, that had been recorded previously, on her official MySpace profile for her fans; the song did not appear on her new album. Later in the year, on 4 October 2008, Vissi held a charity gala at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London.

A bonus track from the Greek album was released on 29 October 2008, along with its music video. The song, titled &quot;To Parelthon Mou&quot; (&quot;My Past&quot;), is the title track to the Greek film &quot;Bank Bang&quot;, released in December 2008. The music video for the song was filmed on 22 October 2008, at The Mall Athens. With Cosmote sponsoring the album, three songs from the album were released on 26 November 2008, exclusively on the Cosmote online music store.

Vissi&#x27;s Greek album &quot;Apagorevmeno&quot; was released on 9 December 2008, including songs by Patrick Leonard, Adam Cohen, Kara DioGuardi, Glen Ballard, Dan Wilson, Yiannis Kefonedes and Vissi herself. The production of this album was done by Vissi herself, Greg Ladanyi, Patrick Leonard, CJ Vanston and Yiannis Kefonedes. It was the first album since 1983 not to include any songs and, generally, any input by Nikos Karvelas. The reason she gave for this in an interview with &quot;Down Town&quot; magazine was that the two had got tired of each other, but clarified that this did not rule out a collaboration in the future. The album was certified gold in the first week of release, and reached number one on its second week on the charts before settling at 2× platinum status. In August 2009, &quot;Apagorevmeno&quot; became the first album to have four top 10 singles on the official Greek download chart by Billboard since the launch of the chart. As of April 2009, the album has sold 27 thousand copies.

As it happened in many cases throughout Vissi&#x27;s career, she was criticized by some journalists. &quot;Eleftheros Typos&quot; cited the album as a relative commercial failure and furthered the commercial decline Vissi had faced in the 2000s. Although this was partially due to hardships faced by the Greek music industry including piracy, the 2007–2008 financial crisis, and changing musical tastes, leading to a general decline of the laiko-pop scene and image-based singers, in an article about the &quot;golden trio&quot; of Greek pop, consisting of Vissi, Despina Vandi, and Sakis Rouvas, Anna Vlavianou of &quot;To Vima&quot; noted Vissi as having &quot;the most vociferous&quot; decline of the group. She cited several reasons for this, such as Vissi&#x27;s unsuccessful result at Eurovision and long absences from Greece in pursuit of a career abroad at a relatively advanced age, leading to her losing a portion of her established Greek fanbase. Additionally, while in previous years the supposed rivalry between Vissi and Vandi drew heavy media attention, with the public curious as to who would come out on top, she cited Elena Paparizou as replacing both artists as top contemporary female in the latter half of the decade. Haris Simvoulidis of Avopolis also alleged that on &quot;Apagorevmeno&quot; Vissi appeared to be attempting to catch up to her contemporaries, Paparizou and Peggy Zina. Despite these comments, Apagorevmeno became the biggest selling album by a female artist in Greece for the year 2009.

On 24 February 2009, Vissi renewed her contract with Sony Music Greece.

Vissi had originally planned to start appearances at &quot;Athinon Arena&quot; in February 2009, as part of her comeback and for promotion of the new album, however, she decided to hold a concert in Athens during the summer, instead. The tour began in July 2009 and all appearances were sold out throughout Greece. The tour ended with a concert at GSP Stadium in Nicosia, Cyprus, on 25 September 2009; overall, the tour was a success for Vissi, who had not performed for the Greek audience in four years. On 16 November 2009, &quot;Apagorevmeno&quot; was re-released as &quot;Apagorevmeno+&quot; with three new songs and two remixes in special ecological packaging. 
Vissi started appearances at &quot;Athinon Arena&quot; on 6 November 2009 with Greek band Ble, Yiorgos Sambanis, Mario, Vera Boufi, Elissavet Spanou, Michalis Zeis and DJ Dim Trik. The show was named &quot;The Fabulous Show&quot;, after her then-latest single, &quot;Fabulous&quot;, which was included in &quot;Apagorevmeno+&quot;. The show marked the comeback of Anna Vissi in the nightlife of Athens after four years of absence and received good reviews. Vissi was on stage for almost 4 hours every Thursday, Friday and Saturday until closing night on 20 March 2010. The show proved to be a huge success both artistically and commercially.

<text>Kai Michael Hansen (born 17 January 1963) is a German musician who is the founder, lead guitarist and vocalist of power metal band Gamma Ray. He is also one of the co-founders of another power metal band Helloween, which he was a part of from 1983 to 1989 and rejoined in 2016. He is a prominent figure in power metal and has sold millions of albums worldwide. He is regarded as &quot;the godfather of power metal&quot;, having founded two seminal bands in the genre. In 2011, he joined the band Unisonic featuring former Helloween vocalist Michael Kiske. Hansen and Kiske reunited with Helloween in 2017 for a world tour with all current members, celebrating the 30-year anniversary of release of the albums &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys&quot; Parts I and II.

==Early life==
Kai Hansen was born in Hamburg in 1963. At the age of ten, Kai developed an interest in music and began to play wash-drums. His parents however, didn&#x27;t like the noise and bought him an acoustic guitar instead. He took a six-months course in classical guitar and following it, formed his first band with his classmates after he bought an electric guitar, a white Ibanez Les Paul.

==Career==
Hansen&#x27;s musical career started in 1978 in a band called Gentry, alongside Iron Savior&#x27;s co-founder and producer Piet Sielck. In 1983, he and Michael Weikath founded Helloween, where he was guitarist and singer until Michael Kiske took over the microphone for the albums &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I&quot; and &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II&quot;. Hansen left the band on 1 January 1989, citing exhaustion from touring, and then went on to form his own power metal band Gamma Ray. Hansen also joined Iron Savior as guitarist in 1997, but quit after a few years to focus his efforts on Gamma Ray. He then forged a successful career with Gamma Ray, releasing several albums and playing many tours worldwide.

Hansen participated in a large number of other projects. He appeared as a guest vocalist on Blind Guardian&#x27;s albums &quot;Follow the Blind&quot; and &quot;Tales from the Twilight World&quot;. Around the same time, he and fellow Gamma Ray bandmate Dirk Schlächter collaborated on Angra&#x27;s first full-length album &quot;Angels Cry&quot;, both playing guitar solos in the song &quot;Never Understand&quot;. He also collaborated on Angra&#x27;s album &quot;Temple of Shadows&quot; released in 2004 doing vocals for the song &quot;The Temple of Hate&quot;. He participated as a guest guitarist on Michael Kiske&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Instant Clarity&quot;. Together with HammerFall he recorded a cover version of Helloween&#x27;s &quot;I Want Out&quot;.

Hansen played the role of Regrin the dwarf in Avantasia&#x27;s Metal Opera albums by Tobias Sammet. Later he was featured in the album &quot;The Scarecrow&quot; playing guitar in the song &quot;Shelter from the Rain&quot;. He was also one of the guest musicians in Avantasia&#x27;s 2010 world tour, which have put him to play live together with fellow ex-bandmate Michael Kiske, after more than twenty years since he left Helloween. After this tour it was announced, via Michael Kiske&#x27;s official website, that Hansen would join his new band Unisonic, as they &quot;instantly felt the magic of Helloween years again and had a lot of fun together on and off stage&quot;.

In 2005, he toured with the young German power/Viking metal band Stormwarrior from his home town of Hamburg as lead singer, playing material from his classic Helloween debut album &quot;Walls of Jericho&quot; – the favorite album and greatest influence of Stormwarrior. &quot;Stormwarrior featuring Kai Hansen&quot; returned in 2007 to play at the Magic Circle Festival in Bad Arolsen and at the Wacken Open Air Festival.

In 2008, Hansen played with Stormwarrior at Sweden Rock Festival 2008.

In 2011, Hansen joined the hard-rock band Unisonic, as second guitarist and reunited with old friend and ex-Helloween vocalist Michael Kiske, who formed the band in 2009. The band released its debut album, &quot;Unisonic&quot; in 2012 and embarked on its first world tour. Hansen stated in an interview that despite being a member of Unisonic, he will not have less focus on Gamma Ray, and that the next Gamma Ray album should arrive in 2013. Unisonic&#x27;s second album, &quot;Light Of Dawn&quot;, was released in 2014 and a European and Japanese tour followed.

In 2015, following the Best of the Best Party Tour, Hansen hired Frank Beck as their second vocalist for the Gamma Ray.

In 2016, Hansen released his first solo album titled &quot;XXX – Three Decades in Metal&quot;. The album was released via earMUSIC on September 16 of the same year.

In 2017 Kai Hansen played minitour - four shows in Slovakia and Czech republic with the band Ravenclaw, with special set for Ravenclaw 15-Years Anniversary - Ravenclaw feat. Kai Hansen.

On November 14, 2016, was announced the Pumpkins United World Tour - a concert tour of the German power metal band Helloween. Former members Michael Kiske and Kai Hansen joined the current members for this tour for 2017, 2018 and 2019.

==Singing style==

During his earlier years Hansen&#x27;s singing style was reminiscent of many thrash metal vocalists. Rather than using a smooth and clear style (like his successor Kiske) Hansen sang with a raspy sound, interluded by high-pitched screams for dramatic effect. Kiske was brought in as a singer, originally because Hansen had trouble singing and playing the guitar simultaneously, though later in his career he seems to have overcome these problems.

Beginning from 1995 onward, Hansen has provided the vocals for his current band Gamma Ray. Around that time, Hansen&#x27;s vocal style became more melodic and slightly clearer, more in the traditional power metal sense, while still retaining the slight nasal tone and rasp of his early years.

==Equipment==
For almost 20 years, Hansen has played ESP Guitars. He first started using them during his days with Helloween after hearing testimonials of ESP from artists such as George Lynch and Kirk Hammett of Metallica. Before Helloween, he had owned a white Ibanez guitar, and a Gibson Les Paul, then saved up for a Marshall amplifier by delivering newspapers. His main ESPs are red and pink ESP Custom guitars based on Jackson&#x27;s Randy Rhoads model and two custom V models based on the classic Gibson Flying V shape.

During the early 1990s, Hansen had used Stratocaster models. On his autobiography on the Gamma Ray website, he claims his first electric guitar was a white Ibanez Les Paul copy On the recent tour with Gamma Ray he has been seen using a Korina Epiphone flying V with EMG pickups.

Hansen has used, and still uses, Engl amplifiers since the recording sessions of &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II&quot;.

<doc id="740980" wikidata="Q137446" url="?curid=740980" title="Bordetella bronchiseptica">
<text>Bordetella bronchiseptica is a small, gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium of the genus &quot;Bordetella&quot;. It can cause infectious bronchitis in dogs and other animals, but rarely infects humans. Closely related to &quot;B. pertussis&quot;—the obligate human pathogen that causes pertussis (whooping cough); &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; can persist in the environment for extended periods.

==Pathogenesis==
Humans are not natural carriers of &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot;, which typically infects the respiratory tracts of smaller mammals (cats, dogs, rabbits, etc.). People are more likely to be infected by &quot;B. pertussis&quot; or &quot;B. parapertussis&quot;. Unlike &quot;B. pertussis&quot;, &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; is generally resistant to macrolide antibiotics. It is also generally resistant to cephalosporins. Some human cases have been successfully treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones.

&quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; does not express pertussis toxin, which is one of the characteristic virulence factors of &quot;B. pertussis&quot;, but it has the genes to do so, highlighting the close evolutionary relationship between the two species.

===Veterinary pathogenesis===

In veterinary medicine, &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; leads to a range of pathologies in different hosts. It is a serious disease of dogs, pigs, and rabbits, and has been seen in cats, horses, and seals. A PCR test for the pathogen exists.

In pigs, &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; and &quot;Pasteurella multocida&quot; act synergistically to cause atrophic rhinitis, a disease resulting in arrested growth and distortion of the turbinates in the nasal terminus (snout).
In dogs, &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; causes acute tracheobronchitis, which typically has a harsh, honking cough. Kennel cough can also be caused by canine adenovirus-2 or canine parainfluenza virus or a combination of pathogens.

In rabbits, &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; is often found in the nasal tract. It is often assumed to cause a nearly asymptomatic infection known as snuffles, but the causative agent for that disease is &quot;Pasteurella multocida&quot;; &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; often co-infects the nasal passage at the same time.

Cats infected with &quot;B. bronchiseptica&quot; have been seen with tracheobronchitis, conjunctivitis, and rhinitis (upper respiratory tract infection - URI), mandibular lymphadenopathy, and pneumonia. However, URI in cats can also be caused by herpesvirus, calicivirus, &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species, or &quot;Chlamydia psittaci&quot;. An intranasal vaccine exists for cats.

==Outbreaks==

===2022 outbreak===
In late 2022, together with the H3N2 strain of canine influenza and other respiratory pathogens, Bordetella bronchiseptica experienced a surge in canine infections. This was partially due to increased human travel and reopened offices following the relaxation of COVID-19 pandemic public health measures, leading to large numbers of dogs being placed together in kennels and doggy day care centers. Changing pet ownership behaviors also led to overcrowded animal shelters,after the pandemic.

<text>Rolf Widerøe (11 July 1902 – 11 October 1996) was a Norwegian accelerator physicist who was the originator of many particle acceleration concepts, including the &quot;resonance accelerator&quot; and the betatron accelerator.

==Early life==

Widerøe was born in Kristiania (now Oslo) in 1902 as a son of the mercantile agent Theodor Widerøe (1868–1947) and Carla Johanne Launer (1875–1971). He was a brother of the aviator and entrepreneur Viggo Widerøe who became the founder of the Norwegian airline Widerøe. After his A-level exams (Examen artium) in the summer of 1920 at the Halling School in Oslo, Widerøe left for the university of Karlsruhe, Germany, to study electrical engineering.

===Betatron accelerator concept===
There he conceived the concept of electromagnetic induction to accelerate electrons, which became the basis of what would be known as betatron. This idea was to use a vortex field surrounding a magnetic field to accelerate electrons in a tube.

==Return to Germany==
In 1924, he returned to Norway for a short time period, working in a locomotive facility of the Norwegian State Railways, where he fulfilled his 72-day military service. He went back to Germany in 1925. There he studied at the Technical University at Aachen, where he proposed a thesis in 1927 for an experimental betatron accelerator, incorporating the work of Swedish scientist Gustav Ising of 1924, which was not successful at first. Thus, Widerøe instead built a linear accelerator prototype based on Isings proposal and made this the topic of his dissertation under Walter Rogowski. In 1928, he relocated to Berlin and started building protective relays during his work at AEG. In 1933 Hitler came to power in Germany and Widerøe decided to return to Norway.

===Resonance accelerator===
From his betatron experiment, he developed further ideas of particle acceleration without the necessity of high voltage. The method was resonating particles with a radio frequency electric field to add energy to each traversal of the field. This experiment was successful and published in 1928, and became the progenitor of all high-energy particle accelerators. Widerøe&#x27;s article was studied by Ernest Lawrence in the United States, and used as the basis for his creation of the cyclotron in 1929.

==War time==
In 1941 his younger brother Viggo Widerøe was arrested for resistance work. In 1943 the Germans &quot;invited&quot; Rolf Widerøe to Germany to continue to work on the Betatron. Inspired by the opportunity to continue his research and promises that his brother would have a better situation in his imprisonment, he agreed to go to Hamburg and start building a German Betatron. During this period, already in 1943, he introduced the theoretical concept of colliding particles head-on to increase interaction energy and a storage ring device. Several sources claims that his Norwegian citizenship was ultimately revoked for working with the Nazi government, but this is not correct. His Norwegian passport was confiscated for some time and he accepted a penalty notice of NOK 5000, loss of civil liberties and to forfeit NOK 120000 of the amount he was paid in licence fees for use of his patent rights during the betatron development. In the end, early in 1946, he received an intermediate passport and emigrated to Switzerland.

==Later years==
In 1946 he filed a patent in Norway for an accelerator based on synchronous acceleration. He would go on to publish over 180 papers in scientific and engineering journals, and filed over 200 patent applications over his lifetime. In his later life he devoted much time to medicinal technology, focusing on cancer treatment, including developing megavolt radiation therapy technologies. He would collaborate with CERN beginning in 1952 doing the preliminary studies for the Proton Synchrotron, lectured at ETH Zurich in 1953, and collaborated at DESY in 1959 in Hamburg.

Rolf Widerøe died on 11 October 1996 in Obersiggenthal, Switzerland.

Since 2011 the European Physical Society has awarded a prize in Widerøe&#x27;s memory every three years to individuals in recognition of outstanding work in the field of accelerator physics.

<doc id="740989" wikidata="Q727016" url="?curid=740989" title="Boys Town (film)">
<text>Boys Town is a 1938 American biographical drama film based on Father Edward J. Flanagan&#x27;s work with a group of underprivileged boys in a home/educational complex that he founded and named &quot;Boys Town&quot; in Nebraska. It stars Spencer Tracy as Father Edward J. Flanagan, and Mickey Rooney with Henry Hull, Leslie Fenton, and Gene Reynolds.

The film was written by Dore Schary, Eleanore Griffin, and John Meehan, and was directed by Norman Taurog. Tracy won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studio head Louis B. Mayer, who was a Belarusian-Canadian-American Jew known for his respect for the Catholic Church, later called this his favorite film of his long tenure at MGM.

Although the story is largely fictional, it is based upon a real man and a real place. Boys Town is a community outside Omaha, Nebraska. In 1941, MGM made a sequel, &quot;Men of Boys Town&quot;, with Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney reprising their roles from the earlier film.

==Plot==

A convicted murderer asks to make his confession on the day of his execution. He is visited by an old friend, Father Flanagan, who runs a home for indigent men in Omaha, Nebraska. When the prison officials suggest that the condemned man owes the state a debt, Father Flanagan witnesses the condemned man&#x27;s diatribe to prison officials and a reporter that describes his awful plight as a homeless and friendless boy who was a ward in state institutions. After the convicted man asks the officials to leave, Father Flanagan provides some comfort and wisdom. On the train back to Omaha, Father Flanagan is transformed in his humanitarian mission by revelations (echoed in the words) imparted by the condemned man&#x27;s litany of hardships suffered as a child, without friends or family, and a ward of the state.

Father Flanagan believes there is no such thing as a bad boy and spends his life attempting to prove it. He battles indifference, the legal system, and often even the boys, to build a sanctuary that he calls Boys Town. The boys have their own government, make their own rules, and dish out their own punishment. One boy, Whitey Marsh, is as much as anyone can handle. Whitey&#x27;s elder brother Joe, in prison for murder, asks Father Flanagan to take Whitey—a poolroom shark and tough-talking hoodlum—to Boys Town. Joe escapes custody during transfer to federal prison. Whitey stays, though, and runs for mayor of Boys Town, determined to win with his &quot;don&#x27;t be a sucker&quot; campaign slogan.

Winning the election for mayor is Tony Ponessa, a disabled boy. Whitey has an outburst after finding out the results. This nearly causes a fist fight between Whitey and outgoing mayor, Freddie Fuller. Since Whitey&#x27;s arrival at Boys Town, he and Freddie do not get along well. To settle their differences once and for all, a boxing match is held. Freddie defeats Whitey with Father Flanagan and all of the boys watching.

Whitey leaves Boys Town after being defeated in the boxing match. Pee Wee, the Boys Town mascot, catches up with him and pulls on his sleeve, pleading, &quot;We&#x27;re going to be pals, ain&#x27;t we?&quot; Whitey, nearly in tears, refuses and pushes the child to the ground and tells him to go back. He storms across the highway as Pee Wee, crying and wandering blindly in the road, is suddenly hit by a car. Whitey leaves, feeling guilty and hurt. During an aimless walk in downtown Omaha, Whitey runs into his brother Joe, who mistakenly shoots him in the leg. Joe takes Whitey to a church and calls Flanagan anonymously, after which Whitey is taken back to Boys Town. The sheriff comes to get Whitey, but Flanagan offers to take full responsibility for the boy.

Whitey refuses to tell Flanagan about the robbery, because he has promised Joe not to inform on him. But when he realizes that his silence could result in the end of Boys Town, he goes to Joe&#x27;s hideout. Joe, realizing with Whitey that Boys Town is more important than they, releases his brother from his promise. Joe protects him until Flanagan and some boys arrive at their hideout. The criminals are recaptured and Boys Town&#x27;s reward is a flood of donations. Whitey is elected the new mayor of Boys Town by acclamation and Dave Morris resigns himself to go into more debt as Flanagan tells him of his new ideas for expanding the facility.

==Reception==
&quot;Boys Town&quot; was a box office success, becoming the second highest-grossing film of 1938 and earning MGM over $2 million in profit. According to MGM records, the film earned $2,828,000 in the United States and Canada, and $1,230,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $2,112,000.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 90% based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 7.20/10.

==Awards and recognition==
In February 1939, when he accepted his Oscar for the role, Spencer Tracy talked about Father Flanagan in his acceptance speech. &quot;If you have seen him through me, then I thank you.&quot; An MGM publicity representative mistakenly announced that Tracy was donating his Oscar to Flanagan, not having confirmed it with Tracy. Tracy said: &quot;I earned the ... thing. I want it.&quot; The Academy hastily struck another inscription, Tracy kept his statuette, and Boys Town got one, too. It read: &quot;To Father Flanagan, whose great humanity, kindly simplicity, and inspiring courage were strong enough to shine through my humble effort. Spencer Tracy.&quot;

==Home media==

&quot;Boys Town&quot; was released on VHS by MGM on March 29, 1993, and re-released on VHS on March 7, 2000.

The DVD release also includes the 1941 sequel &quot;Men of Boys Town&quot; as an extra feature.

==Sequel==

Released in April 1941, &quot;Men of Boys Town&quot; takes a darker view of the issue of homeless and troubled youth. Tracy and Rooney reprise their characters as Father Flanagan and Whitey Marsh as they expose the conditions in a boys reform school. This film was released on VHS on December 23, 1993, but is now available only as an extra feature on &quot;Boys Town&quot; DVD.

==Popular culture==
In the &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; television series 1991 episode &quot;The Big Kiss&quot;, orphan Ed Chigliak watches &quot;Boys Town&quot; and is inspired to find out who his real parents are. He mentions the film reference to several other characters.

Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1994, referred to the film to argue that philanthropists would be able to help those people and organizations affected by government cuts.

<text>Severiano Ballesteros Sota (; 9 April 1957 – 7 May 2011) was a Spanish professional golfer, a World No. 1 who was one of the sport&#x27;s leading figures from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s. A member of a gifted golfing family, he won 90 international tournaments in his career, including five major championships between 1979 and 1988; The Open Championship three times and the Masters Tournament twice. He gained attention in the golfing world in 1976, when at the age of 19, he finished second at The Open. He played a leading role in the re-emergence of European golf, helping the European Ryder Cup team to five wins both as a player and captain.

Ballesteros won a record 50 European Tour titles. He won at least one European Tour title for 17 consecutive years between 1976 and 1992. His final victory was at the 1995 Peugeot Spanish Open. Largely because of back-related injuries, Ballesteros struggled with his form during the late 1990s. Despite this, he continued to be involved in golf, creating the Seve Trophy and running a golf course design business. In 2000, &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine ranked Ballesteros as the greatest Continental European golfer of all time.

In the 2000s, Ballesteros played sparingly due to continuing back problems and in 2007 he eventually retired from competitive professional golf. In 2008 he was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. Ballesteros was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award for the second time at the BBC Sports Personality Awards in 2009. He was presented with the award at his home in Spain by his compatriot and former Ryder Cup teammate José María Olazábal.

Ballesteros died of brain cancer in 2011, aged 54.

==Career outline==
===Early life and career===
Severiano Ballesteros Sota was born in the village of Pedreña, Cantabria, Spain, on 9 April 1957, the youngest of five sons of Baldomero Ballesteros Presmanes (1919–1987), who was a farm labourer, and Carmen Sota Ocejo (1919–2002). One died in childhood, while all the others became professional golfers. He learned the game while playing on the beaches near his home, during the hours he was supposed to be in school, mainly using a 3-iron given to him by his older brother Manuel when he was eight years old. His maternal uncle Ramón Sota was Spanish professional champion four times and finished sixth in the Masters Tournament in 1965. Ballesteros&#x27;s older brother Manuel finished in the top 100 on the European Tour Order of Merit every year from 1972 to 1983, and later became Ballesteros&#x27;s manager. His brothers Vicente and Baldomero, and nephews Raúl and Ivan are also professional golfers.

Ballesteros turned professional in March 1974 at the age of 16. He burst onto the international scene with a second-place finish in 1976 Open Championship at Royal Birkdale Golf Club. He led by two shots after the third round, but a final round 74 saw him tie for second with Jack Nicklaus, six shots behind the winner Johnny Miller. He went on to win the European Tour Order of Merit (money title) that year, a title that he would win the next two years, and six times total, a record at the time (since surpassed by Colin Montgomerie). Ballesteros won his first Open Championship in 1979 with a closing 70, a round in which he famously hit his tee shot into a car park on the 16th hole yet still made a birdie.

Ballesteros went on to win five major championships: the Masters Tournament in 1980 and 1983, and The Open Championship in 1979, 1984 and 1988. His 1980 Masters win was the first by a European player, and at the time he was the youngest winner of the tournament, at age 23 (though this record was broken by Tiger Woods in 1997, when he was 21 years old). His 1979 win at The Open Championship similarly made him the youngest winner of the tournament in the 20th century, and the first golfer from continental Europe to win a major since Frenchman Arnaud Massy won The Open in 1907. Ballesteros won the rain delayed Masters in 1983 by five shots. As of 2023, he is the last golfer to win the Masters on a Monday. Ballesteros described the putt he holed on the 18th green at St Andrews to win the 1984 Open Championship as &quot;the happiest moment of my whole sporting life.&quot;

On 30 September 1983, Ballesteros joined the PGA Tour. In 1984 he played in 15 tournaments, the minimal amount allowed for a golfer with membership. The following season he played in only 9 tournaments. He was subsequently suspended by the PGA Tour for failing to meet his commitment.

In 1988, Ballesteros won his fifth and last major title, The Open Championship at Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes. The final round was played on Monday after torrential rain had flooded the course and forced Saturday&#x27;s play to be abandoned. He described his final round of 65 which beat Nick Price by two shots as &quot;perhaps the best round of my entire career.&quot;

For much of the 1980s and 1990s, Ballesteros was a mainstay of the European Ryder Cup team. He scored 22½ points in 37 matches against the United States; his partnership with fellow Spaniard José María Olazábal was the most successful in the history of the competition, with 11 wins and two halved matches out of 15 pairs matches. While Ballesteros was a member of European sides that won the Ryder Cup in 1985, retained the Cup in 1987 and 1989, and regained the Cup in 1995, the pinnacle of his career in the competition came in 1997, when he captained the winning European side at Valderrama Golf Club in Sotogrande, Spain. This was the first Ryder Cup ever held in continental Europe.

Ballesteros led the Official World Golf Ranking for a total of 61 weeks in the period from their inauguration (in April 1986) to September 1989, including being world number one at the end of the 1988 season. He also led McCormack&#x27;s World Golf Rankings, published in McCormack&#x27;s &quot;World Of Professional Golf&quot; annuals (from which the official rankings were developed) in 1983, 1984 and 1985. He was ever-present in the end of season world&#x27;s top ten according to those rankings for fifteen years, from 1977 to 1991 inclusive.

===Late career and retirement===
In 1999, Ballesteros was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. He was instrumental in introducing the Seve Trophy in 2000, a team competition similar to the Ryder Cup pitting a team from Great Britain and Ireland against one from continental Europe. In 2000, Ballesteros was ranked as the 16th greatest golfer of all time by &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine; he was the top golfer from the continent of Europe.

Ballesteros had played sparingly since the late 1990s because of back problems, and made his first start in years at the 2005 Madrid Open. He stated a desire to play more tournaments in the 2006 season. He entered the 2006 Open Championship, having played just one other event on the European Tour, The Open de France Alstom, where he missed the cut. He ran a thriving golf course design business and had been eligible for the Champions Tour and European Seniors Tour upon turning 50 in 2007. Ballesteros had been the captain of the European team in the Royal Trophy since its inception in 2006. He was announced again as non-playing captain of the 2008 European team to defend the Royal Trophy against the Asian team at the Amata Spring Country Club in Bangkok.

After further recurrences of his back problems, which contributed to his finishing tied for last in his only Champions Tour start, Ballesteros announced his retirement from golf on 16 July 2007, bringing down the curtain on an illustrious career. During the news conference, he also addressed reports in European media that he had attempted suicide, saying that those reports &quot;were not even close to reality&quot;. He had been briefly hospitalized when he became concerned about the condition of his heart, but was released the same day after being given a clean bill of health.

Ballesteros was a member of the Laureus World Sports Academy. He had become involved in European golf course design in his later years, most famously altering the 17th hole at Valderrama before the 1997 Ryder Cup.

===Personal life===
Ballesteros was married to Carmen Botín O&#x27;Shea, daughter of Emilio Botín, from 1988 until their divorce in 2004, in the municipality of Marina de Cudeyo in Cantabria. The couple had three children, Javier, Miguel and Carmen. The marriage was said to have run into trouble when Ballesteros could not accept the fact his career was on the wane.

===Brain tumor and death===
At Madrid-Barajas Airport on 6 October 2008, Ballesteros lost consciousness and was admitted to hospital. Six days later, he confirmed that he had been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. On 15 October, Spanish news agency EFE reported that he had undergone a 12-hour operation to resect the tumour, the first of four operations he would have. A hospital spokeswoman stated that surgeons had removed a sizable part of the tumour. On 23 October, it was confirmed publicly that the tumour was classified as a cancerous oligoastrocytoma, and after a rapid deterioration of his health, further surgery took place on 24 October to stabilize him and try to remove the remainder of the tumour. On 24 October, it was confirmed that the tumour had been removed after a 6½-hour operation. On 3 November, it was confirmed by the hospital that he was starting his rehabilitation in the intensive care unit, and was breathing steadily. On 18 November, he was moved out of the intensive care unit and changed wards at Madrid&#x27;s La Paz Hospital to continue his rehabilitation.

Ballesteros was discharged from hospital on 9 December 2008. He then returned home to northern Spain and underwent chemotherapy treatment as an outpatient. In January 2009, a message on his website said he had responded well to one course of chemotherapy.

I am very motivated and working hard although I am aware that my recovery will be slow and therefore I need to be patient and have a lot of determination.
For these reasons I am following strictly all the instructions that the doctors are giving me.
Besides, the physiotherapists are doing a great job on me and I feel better every day.

Ballesteros completed a second course of chemotherapy at Madrid&#x27;s La Paz Hospital in February 2009. Speaking through his website he said, &quot;The results of the check-up were really positive, better even than the first ones.&quot; He finished a third round of treatment in March 2009, and completed his fourth and final course of chemotherapy a month later.

In June 2009, Ballesteros made his first public appearance after treatment for the brain tumour. He said it was a &quot;miracle&quot; to be alive and he thanked everyone who had been involved in his care and welfare.

At his first public appearance, Ballesteros announced the launch of the &quot;Seve Ballesteros Foundation&quot;. This foundation was set up to help those with cancer fight it. The foundation aims to research cancer, especially brain tumours, but it will also help financially challenged young golfers, so they might be as successful as he.

On 6 May 2011, Ballesteros&#x27;s family released a statement announcing that his neurological condition had &quot;suffered a severe deterioration&quot;. He died within hours of the announcement in the early hours of 7 May 2011 at the age of 54; his older brother Baldomero confirmed the precise time of death at 2:10 am CEST.

===Tributes===
The Open de España was underway when Ballesteros died. The European Tour marked his death with a moment of silence during the third round at the Real Club de Golf El Prat in Barcelona.

Tiger Woods described Ballesteros as &quot;one of the most talented and exciting golfers to ever play the game&quot;. Lee Westwood said of Ballesteros, &quot;Seve made European golf what it is today&quot;.

Phil Mickelson, who won the 2010 Masters Tournament, selected a Spanish-themed menu for the 2011 Masters Champions Dinner in honour of Ballesteros, who was too ill to attend. Entrees included seafood paella and manchego-topped filet mignon, with a salad course, asparagus, and tortillas as sides, plus ice cream-topped apple empanada for dessert.

At the Madrid Open tennis tournament, a moment of silence was held prior to the semi-final match between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. Nadal, a close friend of Ballesteros, was seen wiping away tears as he watched the video screen.

On 8 May, at 15:08 EST, the three major U.S. men&#x27;s tours stopped play and held a moment of silence.

On 10 May, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; said of him: &quot;He spoke many other languages too: the dialects of honour, of dignity, of sportsmanship, of decency, of fair play, of loyalty, of integrity, and in the end, of dauntless, unforgettable, astonishing courage. Quite simply, there has never been a finer ambassador for either his sport or his country.&quot;

A funeral service was held for Ballesteros, previously cremated, at the parish church of San Pedro, in his home village of Pedreña. Due to the number of those in attendance, several big screens were installed outside the 400-capacity church. His ashes were then to be scattered at his home estate.

The day of Ballesteros&#x27;s death, the Spanish flag was raised at the World Golf Hall of Fame in Florida, the United States flag was lowered to half-staff, a photo of Ballesteros was hung in the box office, and a black ribbon was hung on the outside of his locker. The next weekend, at nearby TPC Sawgrass, the Spanish flag was flown at half-staff during the 2011 Players Championship at the request of defending champion Tim Clark, in place of his native South African flag. Clark went on to state, &quot;Seve was a hero of mine growing up...In losing [him] last week, I think the whole golfing world is saddened by that. To have his flag up here is just a small little tribute to him. Obviously he deserves a whole lot more.&quot;

===Legacy===
The 2012 Ryder Cup, the first to be played after Ballesteros&#x27;s death, saw the European team wearing navy blue and white garments on the final day in memory of Seve, who traditionally wore navy blue on the last day of a tournament. Additionally, the team&#x27;s kit also bore the silhouette of Ballesteros after his win at the 1984 Open Championship. The Irish golfer Pádraig Harrington, Nick Faldo, and other European players proposed that the PGA replace the image of Harry Vardon on the European Tour&#x27;s official logo with one of Ballesteros (a silhouette of the iconic image of Ballesteros&#x27;s &quot;salute&quot;, following his win at the 1984 Open Championship).

The airport of Ballesteros&#x27;s homeland, Cantabria, has been named after him since the Spanish Government approved the change on 16 April 2015. The name was changed from Santander Airport to Seve Ballesteros – Santander Airport. This change was made after the regional parliament unanimously approved a petition in May 2014. The motivation behind this popular initiative was to honor Ballesteros for being one of the most universal of Cantabrians and an example in sports and life.

In 2017, the European Tour Players&#x27; Player of the Year award was renamed in his honour. The first recipient of The Seve Ballesteros Award was Henrik Stenson.

<text>Ludwig Otto Hesse (22 April 1811 – 4 August 1874) was a German mathematician. Hesse was born in Königsberg, Prussia, and died in Munich, Bavaria. He worked mainly on algebraic invariants, and geometry. The Hessian matrix, the Hesse normal form, the Hesse configuration, the Hessian group, Hessian pairs, Hesse&#x27;s theorem, Hesse pencil, and the Hesse transfer principle are named after him. Many of Hesse&#x27;s research findings were presented for the first time in &quot;Crelle&#x27;s Journal&quot; or Hesse&#x27;s textbooks.

==Life==
Hesse was born in Königsberg (today Kaliningrad) as the son of Johann Gottlieb Hesse, a businessman and brewery owner and his wife Anna Karoline Reiter (1788–1865). He studied in his hometown at the Albertina under Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. Among his teachers were count Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel and Friedrich Julius Richelot. He earned his doctorate in 1840 at the University of Königsberg with the dissertation &quot;De octo punctis intersectionis trium superficium secundi ordinis&quot;. In 1841, Hesse completed his habilitation thesis. In the same year he married Sophie Marie Emilie Dulk, the daughter of pharmacists and chemistry professor Friedrich Philipp Dulk (1788–1852). The couple had a son and five daughters. Hesse taught for some time physics and chemistry at the Vocational School in Königsberg and lectured at the Albertina. In 1845 he was appointed associate professor in Königsberg. In 1855 he moved to Halle and in 1856 to Heidelberg until 1868, when he finally moved to Munich to the newly established Polytechnic School. In 1869 he joined the Bavarian Academy of Sciences.

His doctoral students include Olaus Henrici, Gustav Kirchhoff, Jacob Lüroth, Adolph Mayer, Carl Neumann, Max Noether, Ernst Schröder, and Heinrich Martin Weber.

<text>The Kunsthaus Tacheles (English: &quot;Art House Tacheles&quot;) was an art center in Berlin, Germany, a large () building and sculpture park on Oranienburger Straße, in the sub-neighborhood of Spandauer Vorstadt in the Mitte district. Huge, colorful graffiti-style murals were painted on the exterior walls, and modern art sculptures were featured inside. The building housed an artist collective from 1990 until 2012.

Originally called Friedrichstraßenpassage, it was built in 1907–1908 as a department store opposite the synagogue. During World War II it served as a Nazi prison for a short while. Under GDR authorities it was later partially demolished. After the Berlin Wall had come down in 1989, it was taken over by artists, who called it &quot;Tacheles&quot;, Yiddish for &quot;straight talking&quot;. The building contained studios and workshops, a nightclub, and a cinema. Outside, the garden featured an open-air exhibition of metal sculptures as well as galleries and studios for sculptors and painters.

==History==
===Friedrichstraßenpassage===
The building was constructed over the course of 15 months in 1907 and 1908 under the watch of the imperial building consellor (&quot;kaiserlicher Baurat&quot;) Franz Ahrens. The building complex stretched from Friedrichstraße to Oranienburger Straße. The shopping arcade had entrances from both sides and served to connect the two main thoroughfares. The Friedrichstraßenpassage was the second largest of its kind in the city and the only remaining example in Europe of this type of architecture. The construction expenses totaled approximately 7 million German marks.

The five-story building was made of reinforced concrete with a colossal ribbed dome. The façade was built to be dependent upon this concrete frame. There were several small businesses on both sides of the large covered arcade. The building is typically treated as an example of early Modern architecture but exhibits aspects of both Classic and Gothic styles. The complex also housed its own pneumatic tube system for sending mail and materials within the building.

A group of individual shareholders hoped to establish a market advantage by capitalizing on a common location. The concept meant that stores would not be strictly separated from one another, but would instead be allowed to overlap. This was enabled by the existence of a central point-of-sale terminal, where all customers would pay for their goods. But a mere 6 months after its opening the passage had to file for bankruptcy in August 1908. The complex was then rented by Wolf Wertheim, who in 1909 opened a new department store, which operated until 1914. The building was auctioned off shortly before World War I.

It is unclear how the building was used between 1914 and 1924. In 1924, among other additions to the building, a deep cellar was built. This cellar still exists today and is also known as the &quot;Tresorraum&quot;. The height of the ceiling in the passage was lowered to that of the stores, which changed the appearance of the building completely.

===Haus der Technik===

After 1928 the building was used as a show room by the Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft (General Electric Company). It was renamed &quot;Haus der Technik&quot; by the proprietor, the &quot;Berliner Commerz- und Privatbank&quot;. The AEG used the space to display products and advise customers. The former AEG show room, located at Luisenstraße 35, had been destroyed by a fire on September 15, 1927. The new space covered over 113,000 sq ft (10,500 sq. meters) and used 20 large display cases. One of the first German television transmissions took place here during the 1930s.

===Use by the NSDAP===
In the early 1930s, the building was increasingly used by the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (Nazi) party members. In the mid-1930s, the German Workers Front established offices for Gau Kurmark and became owners of the building in 1941. At the same time it became the central office for the SS.

In 1943 the skylights were closed and the corresponding ridge turrets removed, so that French war prisoners could be held in the attic. During the Battle of Berlin the second cellar was flooded by the Nazis and remains underwater today. The building was heavily damaged during World War II, though a large portion of it survived intact.

===Use in the GDR===
In 1948 the building was taken over by the Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB) and deteriorated over the course of the next several years. Various retailers and craft businesses temporarily moved into the ruins, especially on the Friedrichstraße side. The German Travel Agency used the repaired passage section and several floors above ground. Among others, there was an artists&#x27; school, a technical school for foreign trade and economics, and office spaces for &quot;RFT&quot; (Rundfunk- und Fernmelde-Technik), a company dealing with radio and transmission technology. The cellar was used by the National People&#x27;s Army.

The movie theater &quot;Camera&quot; was located in the Friedrichstraße gateway area, but was forced to leave in 1958 due to the worsening condition of the building. The presentation hall was dismantled, but was later reopened under the name &quot;OTL&quot; (Oranienburger Tor Lichtspiele). During the reconstruction work the facade was partially changed and a lobby area was built to house cash registers and checkout aisles. The roof was also rebuilt. This created the current entryway. The movie theater is still used today as a theater area, and after further reconstruction in 1972, it was renamed &quot;Camera&quot;.

===Partial demolition===

The building was slated to be demolished as a result of two engineering opinions from 1969 and 1977; it had not once been renovated, despite relatively continuous and intensive use. A new street was planned on the site and would have created a shortcut between Oranienburger Straße and Friedrichstraße.

The demolition began in 1980. The dome was torn down and the movie theater closed. The remaining portions of the building were scheduled to be demolished in April 1990.

===Artists&#x27; Initiative Tacheles===
On February 13, 1990, two months before the planned demolition, the group &quot;Künstlerinitative Tacheles&quot; occupied the building. The group tried to prevent the demolition through discussions with the building management in Berlin-Mitte, which was legally responsible for the complex, by registering the building as a historic place. The planned demolition was not delayed however, until the group managed to get the Berlin Round Table to issue a last-minute injunction.

The artists&#x27; initiative had a new engineering survey done to evaluate the building&#x27;s structural integrity. The study found that the building was in surprisingly good shape, and it was named a historic landmark shortly thereafter. Its status was officially recognized after a second survey done in February 1992.

In the beginning the center was run by well-known curator Jochen Sandig who expanded the building considerably. In its early days, Tacheles provided both housing and work space for its artist residents. In 1991, the associated housing burnt down and there was considerable suspicion that the fire was started deliberately in order to pave the way for a new art center. Among the early exhibitors were artist Mark Divo, sculptors the Mutoid Waste Company, musicians Spiral Tribe, theater group DNTT, performance artist Lennie Lee, dancer/ choreographer Sasha Waltz, RA.M.M. Theater, and many others.

There was an appreciable amount of disagreement among the East German and West German artists due to their conflicting views and concepts for the space. In the meantime, however, Tacheles has become a central part of the art, activist, exhibition and communication scenes in Berlin, and is officially registered as &quot;Tacheles, e. V.&quot;. In 1996 and 1997, politicians, sociologists, architects, and artists discussed the preservation and future use of the complex at &quot;Metropolis Berlin, Hochgeschwindigkeitsarchitektur&quot; (English: Metropolis Berlin, High Speed Architecture).

===Use until 2011===
The building was painted in bright colors and a large courtyard behind the building holds several sculptures erected using rubble, debris, vehicles and other objects. It became an art center with a cafe, cinema, performance space, workshops and exhibition space.

Tacheles provided inspiration for a scene in the German film &quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot;, according to commentary by director Wolfgang Becker on the US DVD release.

A developer called the Fundus Group had bought the site from the Berlin government in the mid-1990s. Because it was in no hurry to do anything with the building, it gave the artists a 10-year lease in 1998 at a nominal rent of 1 DM (about 0.50 EUR). This contract was then extended but expired at the end of 2009, at which point the artists again became squatters. By this time, the Fundus Group had become insolvent, so the Hamburg-based HSH Nordbank, to which the Fundus Group owed money, decided to sell the property.

===End of Tacheles===
By 2010, a division inside the Tacheles cooperative developed. &quot;Upstairs&quot; lived the artists from the coterie around organizer Martin Reiter, chairman of Tacheles e.V., the association that was formed in 1994 but went bankrupt in 2010. &quot;Downstairs&quot; around 20 businesses including High End Kino 54 and Café Zapata, together with the Johannishof artists who were not represented by the e.V., formed Gruppe Tacheles.

On April 4, 2011, the owner HSH Nordbank scheduled an eviction, but it was not carried out. Instead, on the next day, the &quot;downstairs group&quot; left the building peacefully in return for a payment of EUR 1 million from an anonymous source. Eighty &quot;upstairs&quot; artists vowed to stay and continue to use their ateliers and metal workshops. One week later, the building&#x27;s owner ordered an almost 3m tall wall to be built, separating Oranienburger Straße from the building&#x27;s courtyard.

On September 4, 2012, the remaining 40-60 artists left peacefully, after pressure from HSH Nordbank. Tacheles Metallwerkstatt, the sculpture park, was open until March 2013, when the financial group Nordbank decided to make money out of it.

Several artists and programmers created a &quot;Tacheles 3D online art gallery&quot;, to open up new rooms for the Tacheles artists, and to continue the spirit of Tacheles online.
The association Artprotacheles aims at expanding the idea of Tacheles through Mobile Atelier Projects and has already realised the first one in Berlin Friedrichshain. A few of the Tacheles artists have moved to a property in Marzahn.

===Sale in 2014 and new development===
The property was sold to a New York firm in September 2014. Lead architects for the project development after 2015 were Herzog de Meuron. Construction began in September of 2019 for a mixed-use scheme that follows the trend of the 1990s to fill in vacant land in Berlin with perimeter block buildings, utilizing courtyards and mimicking the traditional urban structure of the city.

<text>Christian Ludwig Ideler (; ; 21 September 1766 – 10 August 1846) was a German chronologist and astronomer.

==Life==

He was born in Gross-Brese near Perleberg. His earliest work was the editing in 1794 of an astronomical almanac for the Prussian government. He taught mathematics and mechanics in the school of woods and forests, and also in the military school. In 1821, he became professor at the University of Berlin, and in 1829 became a foreign member of the Institute of France. From 1816 to 1822, he was tutor to the young princes William Frederick and Charles. He died in Berlin on 10 August 1846.

==Works==

He devoted his life chiefly to the examination of ancient systems of chronology. In 1825–1826 he published his great work, &quot;Handbuch der mathematischen und technischen Chronologie&quot; (&quot;Handbook of mathematical and technical chronology,&quot; 2 vols.; 2nd ed., 1883), re-edited as &quot;Lehrbuch der Chronologie&quot; (&quot;Textbook of chronology,&quot; 1831); a supplementary volume, &quot;Die Zeitrechnung der Chinesen&quot; (&quot;The reckoning of time by the Chinese&quot;), appeared in 1839 in Berlin.

He wrote also &quot;Historische Untersuchungen über die astronomischen Beobachtungen der Alten&quot; (&quot;Historical investigations on the astronomical observations of the ancients,&quot; Leipzig, 1806), &quot;Untersuchungen über den Ursprung und die Bedeutung der Sternnamen&quot; (&quot;Investigations on the origin and significance of the names of stars&quot;) and &quot;Über den Ursprung des Thierkreises&quot; (&quot;Origins of the zodiac,&quot; 1838). With Nolte, he published handbooks on English and French language and literature.

His son, Julius Ludwig Ideler (1809–1842), wrote &quot;Meteorologia veterum Graecorum et Romanorum&quot; — &quot;Prolegomena ad novam Meteorologicorum Aristotelis — Editionem adornandam&quot;. (PhD thesis, 1832).

<doc id="741005" wikidata="Q4118298" url="?curid=741005" title="The New Poetry">
<text>The New Poetry is a poetry anthology edited by Al Alvarez, published in 1962 and in a revised edition in 1966. It was greeted at the time as a significant review of the post-war scene in English poetry.

The introduction, written by Alvarez, is an essay called &quot;The New Poetry or Beyond the Gentility Principle&quot;. It originally appeared in a magazine called &quot;Commentary&quot; (not to be confused with the better-known New-York-based monthly of the same name) as a survey describing the state of modern poetry as Alvarez saw it. It made much play of contrasts between British/American poetry, old and then contemporary poetry, and for example British authors like Philip Larkin versus Ted Hughes.

The criteria for inclusion in &quot;The New Poetry&quot; were these: the poets had to be British (which excluded Sylvia Plath from the first edition); they needed to have been young enough to have made their reputations only after 1950 (this excluded the likes of W. H. Auden and Louis MacNeice); and they had to appeal to Alvarez himself. There were two exceptions to the first and second of these guidelines: Alvarez included long well-established Americans Robert Lowell and John Berryman at the start of the anthology. Alvarez concluded that Lowell and Berryman were the most influential figures on British poetry writing at that time, which justified their inclusion. Each poet was represented with a minimum of five poems. In the revised edition (1966) Alvarez relaxed these rules somewhat to allow Plath and yet another American poet, Anne Sexton, to be represented. In some senses the anthology can be seen as a reaction to Robert Conquest&#x27;s &quot;New Lines&quot; anthology, which appeared a decade before.

The anthology included a very brief biographical note on each of the poets. The revised edition included three poems by Sylvia Plath that were previously unpublished.

<text>Lai Chi Kok () is a rapid transit station on the of the Hong Kong MTR system, between and stations. It was opened on 17 May 1982.

The station is in an orange-red colour, and is a simple through station with an island platform. Platform screen doors have been retrofitted along both platforms in this station.

Although the station is called Lai Chi Kok, it is located in Cheung Sha Wan. Passengers can use this station to access the western and southern part of Cheung Sha Wan. Western Cheung Sha Wan used to be an industrial area, but in recent years, several residential developments have been built on the reclaimed land, namely Banyan Garden, Liberté, The Pacifica, Aqua Marine, and Hoi Lai Estate. There is a pedestrian subway to connect these developments.

In addition, industrial buildings are being demolished and being rebuilt into brand new commercial buildings. The re-purposing of industrial units into office and retail units has led to the station having a high stream of passengers during peak hours.

The Chinese name of the station does not use the commonly used character , but the character instead, which is the correct one according to the &quot;Kangxi dictionary&quot;. The same is true for Lai King station.

==History==
On 10 May 1982, Tsuen Wan line opened to the public, but Lai Chi Kok station did not open until 17 May, a week after. The station was built by Kumagai Gumi.

==Station layout==


==Colour==
The station&#x27;s colour is orange-red because of the bright red colour of the fruit after which the district is named.

<text>Alfred Jules Belpaire (25 September 1820 – 27 January 1893) was a Belgian locomotive engineer who invented the square-topped Belpaire firebox in 1864.

Belpaire was born in Ostend, and first studied at the Athenaeum School in Antwerp. He then became a student at the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures in Paris, France from 1837 to 1840 where he obtained a degree in mechanical engineering.

Belpaire was then employed at the Belgian State Railways, where he worked as a mechanical engineer for more than 50 years. He was first director of the railway workshops at Mechelen and then from 1850 put in charge of all materials and based in Brussels. He first developed a firebox to burn poor quality coals and then around 1860 generalised his invention into a robust thermally efficient design which bears his name. His firebox was used in locomotives in his native Belgium and also then extensively in Britain, North America and around the world. The Belpaire firebox had an improved transfer of heat and steam production due to its greater surface area at the top. While attaching it to a boiler was more difficult due to its oblong shape, it had simpler interior bracing as an advantage.

Alfred Belpaire was one of the founders of the Congrès International des Chemins de Fer, of which he was president in 1891.

He died in Schaerbeek, aged 72.

<doc id="741014" wikidata="Q2915262" url="?curid=741014" title="White Rose of York">
<text>The White Rose of York (Latinised as &quot;rosa alba&quot;, blazoned as &quot;a rose argent&quot;) is a white heraldic rose which was adopted in the 14th century as a heraldic badge of the royal House of York. In the modern era, it is used more broadly as a symbol of Yorkshire.

==History==
The symbolism of the white rose has religious connotations as it represents (like the white lily) the purity of the Virgin Mary, one of whose many titles in the Roman Catholic faith is the &quot;Mystical Rose of Heaven&quot;. In Christian liturgical iconography, white is the symbol of light, typifying innocence, purity, joy and glory.

The white rose was first adopted as a heraldic badge by Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York (1341–1402), the fourth surviving son of King Edward III of England. One of his elder brothers, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster (1340–1399) adopted a red rose as a heraldic badge, the red rose of Lancaster. Their respective descendants fought for control of the throne of England during several decades of civil warfare, which became known as the Wars of the Roses, after the badges of the two competing cadet royal houses. 
The Wars of the Roses were ended by King Henry VII of England who, upon marrying Elizabeth of York, symbolically but not politically, united the White and Red Roses to create the Tudor Rose, the symbol of the English Monarchy. In the late 17th century the Jacobites took up the White Rose of York as their emblem, celebrating &quot;White Rose Day&quot; on 10 June, the anniversary of the birth of James Francis Edward Stuart in 1688. 

At the Battle of Minden in Prussia on 1 August 1759, Yorkshiremen of the 51st Regiment (predecessor of the King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry) picked white roses from bushes near to the battlefields and stuck them in their coats as a tribute to their fallen comrades. Yorkshire Day is held on this date each year.

When the body of the last Yorkist King Richard III (killed by the forces of the future King Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485) was re-discovered buried in the City of Leicester in 2015, it was re-interred in Leicester Cathedral on 26 March 2015 with a white rose engraved on the new coffin. It was confirmed by the DNA of a woman who chose to remain private and by Michael Ibsen, both distant relatives of the king, whose DNA helped to prove his identity.

==Use in Yorkshire heraldry==

The flag of Yorkshire is a White Rose on a blue background. The flags of the three ridings also display it prominently.

More than 20 civic entities in Yorkshire have a coat of arms which includes the rose of York. Including but not limited to: East Riding of Yorkshire Council, North Yorkshire Council, Barnsley Metropolitan Borough, and Bradford City Council.

In heraldry The Rose of York is blazoned as &quot;A rose argent barbed and seeded proper&quot; (a white rose with sepals and seeds in their natural colours). According to the College of Heralds, the heraldic rose may be used with either a petal at the top or if slightly rotated with a sepal at the top. Traditionally the rose is displayed with a petal at the top in the North Riding and West Riding but with a sepal at the top in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

The Yorkshire Party, a devolutionist political party with elected representatives active in Yorkshire, uses a stylised White Rose of York as their emblem.

==International uses==
The Yorkist rose is used in the seal of the City of York, Pennsylvania, which is known as &quot;White Rose City&quot;. The town&#x27;s minor league baseball team, which played in different leagues for several decades, was called the York White Roses. The white rose appears on one of the hats for York&#x27;s current minor league baseball team, the York Revolution. The hats are worn during War of the Roses games versus the Red Rose City, the Lancaster Barnstormers. 

The York Rose features on the shield of Canada&#x27;s York University.

The York Rose also features in the emblem of Lenana School, a tier-one High School in Nairobi, Kenya. Lenana School was formerly known as Duke of York School.

Queens County, New York uses the Tudor rose on the county flag and was named after Catherine of Braganza, spouse of King Charles II who in 1664 sent a fleet to recapture New Amsterdam from the Dutch; the city was renamed &quot;New York&quot; after James, Duke of York, younger brother of King Charles II who succeeded him as King James II.

<text>Robin Friday (27 July 1952 – 22 December 1990) was an English footballer who played professionally as a forward for Reading and Cardiff City during a career that lasted four years in the mid-1970s. earning the nickname &quot;lower league George Best,&quot;. His on-field performances were regarded as excellent, and he won Reading&#x27;s player of the year award in both of his full seasons there, as well as being the leading goal scorer. However, his habit of unsettling opponents through physical intimidation contributed to a heavily tarnished disciplinary record, and his personal life was one of heavy smoking, drinking, womanising and drug abuse. Despite his short career, he remains prominent in the memory of Reading and Cardiff supporters, both as a player and a personality. He has been voted Reading&#x27;s best ever player three times. He entered the Reading FC &#x27;Hall of Fame&#x27; in 2022.

Born and raised in Acton, West London, Friday was scouted, but not retained, by four professional clubs during his teenage years. He appeared for local semi-professional sides in the Isthmian League until he joined Charlie Hurley&#x27;s Fourth Division Reading team in 1974; quickly becoming a key player, he helped Reading to win promotion to the Third Division during the 1975–76 season. As his drug habit intensified, Friday&#x27;s form began to dip in the first half of the 1976–77 season, leading Reading to sell him to Second Division side Cardiff City around the New Year. Friday travelled to join his new team by train without a valid ticket and had to be bailed by the Cardiff manager Jimmy Andrews before he signed for the club. He performed strongly on his debut, but afterwards his form declined and his personal life caused him to repeatedly miss matches altogether. Following a number of incidents, on and off the field—including kicking Mark Lawrenson in the face —Friday retired from football in December 1977, aged 25. He died in Acton in 1990, aged 38, after suffering a heart attack.

The strongest aspects of Friday&#x27;s game were his ball skills, footballing intelligence and physical and mental strength. Andrews labelled Friday &quot;the complete centre-forward&quot;, and, along with numerous contemporaries, retrospectively rated Friday as good enough for the England national team. In a 2004 BBC poll, Friday was voted the top &quot;all-time cult hero&quot; for both Reading and Cardiff City. The Cardiff-based band Super Furry Animals dedicated their 1996 single &quot;The Man Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck&quot; to his memory. Author, Stuart Kane penned two fact-based novels titled &quot;Man Friday: The First Half&quot; and &quot;Man Friday: The Second Half&quot; about Friday&#x27;s life on and off the pitch.

== Early life and non-League career ==

=== Childhood ===
Robin Friday and his twin brother, Tony, were born on 27 July 1952 in Acton, west London. Their parents, Alf Friday, a driver for a laundry firm, and his wife Sheila, were both born in Acton and had married a year before, both aged 20, having met three years earlier. Sheila&#x27;s father, Frederick Riding, had played professional football for Brentford before the Second World War. The Fridays lived with Sheila&#x27;s family until moving into a prefab of their own in Acton Green when Robin and Tony were aged two; they moved to a maisonette in South Acton in 1962 when it was found that the prefab was sinking. Robin and Tony were later described by their mother as having been remarkably close, rarely arguing or fighting. A noticeable difference in personality was that Robin was shy, whereas Tony was more confident. The twins attended their first professional match at the age of two, when their father took them to a Brentford match at Griffin Park. From the age of four Alf took both boys to play football at a local park every afternoon.

Around the age of ten, Friday possessed notable ball-skills, and according to his father could flick an orange up onto his neck, balance it and then let it roll it back down his body and catch it on his foot. As well as football, Robin played cricket to a high standard, boxed and played tennis. Despite their many similarities and common interest in sports and football in particular, the twins were wildly different in academic terms: while Tony did well at school, Friday was uninterested and according to his brother &quot;was always , having around the park&quot;.

Friday was scouted by numerous London sides during his teenage years, joining Crystal Palace&#x27;s school of excellence at 12 or 13, then moving on to Queens Park Rangers aged 13 and then to Chelsea, with whom he attended the 1967 FA Cup Final; as one of the club&#x27;s youth players, he was part of the team&#x27;s official party. However, Friday&#x27;s individual style of play and refusal to change his game resulted in each of these clubs losing patience with him. The twin brothers joined a men&#x27;s team, the Acton British Legion Reserves, aged 14, and in some matches would play alongside their father. Tony played in midfield, and Robin up front, but according to Tony his brother was better as a goalkeeper than a forward: &quot;He was a brilliant goalkeeper. He had no fear ... But he obviously preferred banging them in at the other end&quot;. Around this time Robin became interested in music, dancing and attending concerts; he also had a talent for drawing, but suddenly abandoned this interest at 15. Robin became more outgoing than his brother and started taking drugs in his mid-teens. He left school at 15, a year before Tony, and began training as a plasterer.

=== Borstal, first marriage and the Isthmian League ===

Friday lasted two months as a plasterer before moving on to become first a van driver for a grocery firm, then a window cleaner. His laid-back attitude and indifference was already clear: in his father&#x27;s words, &quot;he didn&#x27;t care&quot;. Friday regularly stole by this time, but despite numerous convictions, did not go to a detention centre until he was 16. Having been caught stealing what Tony recalled to be &quot;a car radio or something&quot;, he was released almost immediately because he suffered from asthma. However, after he re-offended three months later he was sent to Feltham Borstal where he served 14 months. During his time there, Friday became stronger and fitter and also starred for the Borstal football team. He was selected for the prison league&#x27;s all-star men&#x27;s team, still aged 16, and allowed out of Borstal to train and play with Reading&#x27;s youth team, for which he appeared three times in the South East Counties League during the 1968–69 season.

After his release, Friday returned to Acton, where he had a girlfriend called Maxine Doughan and a baby daughter called Nicola. Maxine was of mixed race. The local controversy surrounding the interracial relationship caused the couple and their circle of friends to be socially isolated, and led to a physical attack on the group one night in an Acton public house. Despite this, and the opposition by both sets of parents—Alf refused to even attend the wedding—they married, both aged 17 and had a daughter named Nicola. Friday did not take his marital commitments seriously and continued to womanise, drink heavily and take narcotics. A friend who played for Walthamstow Avenue, a semi-professional Isthmian League club from north-east London, took Friday along to training one day in early 1971. Friday played well enough for Walthamstow to sign him the same day on wages of £10 per week. Many of his new teammates were asphalters from east London, and Friday soon joined them in that trade.

Friday made his debut for Walthamstow on 27 March 1971, against Bromley, coming off the bench to set up Walthamstow&#x27;s equaliser. His first goal came on 17 April, when playing against Tooting &amp; Mitcham he once again appeared as a substitute and scored a header late in the game. He joined west London club Hayes in December 1971 after scoring twice against them in an Isthmian League match. Hayes offered £30 per week, and were also based closer to his home in Acton. A near-fatal accident at work in July 1972 caused Friday to undergo extensive surgery; while working on a roof in Lambeth, a hoist rope became stuck on the scaffold he was working on. The Hayes forward attempted to free the rope but fell and landed on a large spike: the spike went up through one of his buttocks, through his stomach and narrowly avoided a lung. Not only was Friday strong enough to pull himself off the spike, he recovered from his injuries within three months and returned to the Hayes team in October 1972.

Friday was known at Hayes for his excessive drinking, and on one occasion the team started a match a player short because Friday had not turned up. When he finally arrived, eighty minutes after kick-off, his intoxication was obvious, but he was still sent onto the pitch with the match still goalless. The opposition paid him little attention and Friday scored a late winning goal. Hayes were drawn to play Football League Fourth Division club Reading in the FA Cup&#x27;s second round on 9 December 1972; the team managed to draw 0–0 at Reading and earn the right to a replay at home, which they lost 1–0 three days later. Although Hayes had lost, the interest of Reading manager Charlie Hurley was piqued. Hurley travelled to Hayes more than once to watch Friday. Having researched the player&#x27;s background, he was cautious about signing him, but was impressed all the same by his on-field performances.

The 1972–73 season was Friday&#x27;s most prolific non-League year in terms of goals. He briefly joined Enfield early in the 1973–74 season and scored against Hayes in an FA Cup tie before returning to west London in December 1973. Having also been approached by Third Division side Watford, Friday signed for Hurley&#x27;s Reading side in January 1974 for £750. He had scored 46 goals in 67 appearances for Hayes over his two spells there, but during his three Isthmian League seasons had been sent off seven times. Friday signed as an amateur, meaning that although he would be contracted to Reading he would be able to continue appearing for Hayes and working as an asphalter in London; he would train part-time with Reading and play for their reserve team.

== Professional career ==

=== Reading ===

==== 1973–74 ====
In Hurley&#x27;s words, Friday &quot;trained like he played&quot;; &quot;he had no other way of playing&quot;. His new manager had to take him out of training on occasion because of the injuries he would inflict on his own teammates in his effort to win. By late January 1974, Reading were on a run of 14 games with only two victories, while Friday had performed strongly in three reserve matches. Hurley registered the amateur forward to play in the Football League on 23 January 1974 and gave him his first-team debut four days later. Friday turned in a performance away at Northampton Town that the &quot;Reading Evening Post&quot; called &quot;outstanding&quot; as Reading drew 3–3. The team then travelled to Barnsley on 3 February, having not won away from home in four months. After Barnsley led 2–0 at half-time, Friday scored his first League goal with a header just after the break to make the score 2–1. Reading immediately offered a professional contract, which Friday signed on 6 February 1974. His new salary was half what he had earned as an asphalter.

Friday&#x27;s technical ability made him very popular among Reading supporters and pressmen alike. The &quot;Reading Evening Post&quot; report of Reading&#x27;s 4–1 victory over Exeter City on 10 February 1974, Friday&#x27;s first match as a professional, described his performance as &quot;sheer magic&quot; as he scored twice. The report also called Friday&#x27;s first goal of the day &quot;glorious&quot;: he collected the ball wide on the left wing, took it past four Exeter defenders and then fired the ball low and hard into the opposite corner from the edge of the penalty area. Friday was conspicuous in the professional ranks for never wearing shin pads, and for his resistance to physical harm; no matter how badly he was hurt he would always get up and continue.

After sustaining a calf injury against Exeter, he returned for the team&#x27;s next game, away at Lincoln City on 17 February. Friday was repeatedly and cynically fouled by the opposing players and sustained injuries necessitating five minutes on the sideline late in the first half. However, he recovered, returned to the game and set up both Reading goals as his side prevailed by a score of two goals to nil. The team&#x27;s next game, on 24 February 1974, was at home against Doncaster Rovers, and with Friday playing a key role Reading won 5–0. In particular, Friday scored a goal after 17 minutes described by the &quot;Evening Post&quot; reporter as &quot;magical&quot;: with the score 1–0 to Reading, Friday received the ball near the edge of the penalty area, at a tight angle, and coolly kicked the ball with the outside of his boot low across goal, towards the far post. Although it appeared to be heading yards wide of the net, the ball suddenly curved in at the last possible moment—&quot;right around the goalie&quot;, in the phrase of Reading F.C. historian David Downs—and clipped the goalpost before nestling in the back of the net. &quot;The team that has been transformed by Robin Friday has now scored a remarkable 16 goals in five games,&quot; reported the &quot;Evening Post&quot;, &quot;and the highlight of this joyous afternoon was a goal by Friday that was worth anyone&#x27;s admission money on its own.&quot;

Despite his immediate impact on the pitch and the upturn in Reading&#x27;s form, Friday&#x27;s off-the-field activities unsettled some of his teammates. Most tolerated his lifestyle because of his importance to the team, but some, particularly defender Tommy Youlden, were sceptical. He drank extremely heavily, favouring American Colt 45 malt liquor, and his antics during his drinking sessions caused many landlords to lose patience with him. For example, Friday was barred from Caversham&#x27;s Crown public house after he ended a night there leaping between the tables and dancing on the bar. The Boar&#x27;s Head in Reading banned him on ten separate occasions. One night, after the pubs closed, Friday and a friend, Rod Lewington, went to an all-night club called Churchill&#x27;s where they could continue drinking. When they entered, Friday, wearing a long overcoat and hobnail boots, walked onto the dancefloor and removed the coat to reveal that he was wearing nothing underneath. He then began to dance, completely naked apart from the boots.

Although Churchill&#x27;s, described by Lewington as &quot;the worst club that has ever been in Reading&quot;, tolerated such behaviour, the town&#x27;s fashionable Sindlesham Mill nightclub did not, regularly barring Friday for his bizarre activities, including a dance he invented called &quot;the elephant&quot; which consisted of turning the pockets of his jeans inside out and undoing his flies to expose himself. He and his friends would regularly drink all day, though he was able to exert some self-control; according to his friend Syd Simmonds, Friday would obey Hurley&#x27;s instruction not to drink for 48 hours before each game. However, he would play his prized heavy metal records very loudly at any time of the day or night and take LSD with casual indifference. Hurley attempted to calm Friday down by moving him into an apartment above the football club&#x27;s elderly ex-groundsman, but to no avail: &quot;Even if it was three in the morning, the first thing would be to get the music playing&quot;, Simmonds later said. &quot;We had an old boy living below us ... the ex-groundsman at Reading. He was coming up to 80 and he had a dog&#x27;s life in the flat. Pounding music, people knocking on the door, girls throwing stones at the windows. Poor old sod.&quot;

==== 1974–75 ====
Reading finished the 1973–74 season in sixth position, one place higher than the previous year. Friday underwent an operation to have tattoos removed from his fingers during the summer break, and afterwards joined a hippie commune in Cornwall, neglecting to inform Reading of this latter decision. He was absent without explanation when training started for the 1974–75 season in July 1974, arriving only on the day of a closed-doors friendly against Watford. Despite his lack of training, he far out-performed the rest of the team. He continued to play well when the League programme began the following month. By September 1974 he was attracting the interest of First Division sides Sheffield United and Arsenal. The former had been following him since the game at Barnsley back in February, when he had still been an amateur. Arsenal manager Bertie Mee personally attended Reading&#x27;s 4–2 home win over Rotherham United on 12 September, but neither his team nor Sheffield United attempted to sign Friday.

After Reading despatched Newport County 3–0 on 14 September 1974, Friday and his forward partner Dick Habbin had scored six goals each and topped the Football League goalscoring charts. However, at the same time Friday&#x27;s disciplinary record was becoming so bad that even the &quot;Evening Post&quot;, usually favourable to him, criticised him on 30 September 1974, just after he had scored his first hat-trick for Reading in a 4–1 victory over Southport. He was the Football League&#x27;s joint top scorer by this time with nine goals, but he had also already been booked three times that season and the &quot;Post&quot; argued that by constantly risking suspension he was letting the team down. Under the system then used, the three bookings gave him an automatic two-match suspension. The article argued that missing games because of &quot;completely unnecessary&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; infractions amounted to selling the club short.

Friday&#x27;s behaviour on Reading away trips was unpredictable and erratic: in the words of teammate John Murray, &quot;Some of the things he did were funny but other times they were just mad&quot;. On the way back from one away match, the team bus pulled over and Friday noticed that they were beside a cemetery. Friday jumped over the wall and stole some stone angels from a grave, intending to place them beside the club chairman Frank Waller, who was sleeping on the coach. When he returned, Hurley sternly told him that &quot;you must never ever desecrate a graveyard&quot;—Friday dutifully returned the statues. On another occasion, Friday reacted to the news that a teammate had smuggled a girl into his hotel room by kicking the door in. Later on the same night he walked into the bar carrying a swan that he had found in the hotel grounds.

During an FA Cup tie away against Swindon Town on 23 November, Friday began to have trouble breathing and despite leaving the game for five minutes to recuperate with an inhaler was eventually forced to come off for good, coughing violently. After recovering from what was reported to be a chest infection, he returned to the team on 28 December, having missed four matches, and marked his return with his side&#x27;s only goal in a 3–1 home defeat to Stockport County. Reading dropped to 12th place on 6 January 1975, and were only three points above the re-election places; however, by the time they took on Workington at home on 3 February they had risen to 10th. Reading won 3–0, with Friday scoring the third goal with a spectacular header: &quot;Diving full length barely a foot off the ground, Friday risked life and limb to head home a truly memorable goal&quot;, wrote the &quot;Evening Post&quot; match reporter. &quot;True to form, he had to spoil things for himself by getting booked three minutes later&quot;.

This victory marked the beginning of a run of six wins out of seven games, after which the side was once again challenging for promotion to the third tier, hovering between sixth and eighth place for the rest of the season. By 11 April promotion looked improbable, but Friday was still overjoyed after scoring the last-minute winner in Reading&#x27;s 2–1 victory over Rochdale. In celebration he ran behind the net and kissed a policeman. &quot;The policeman looked so cold and fed up standing there&quot;, explained the Reading forward, publicly, &quot;that I decided to cheer him up a bit.&quot; In the dressing room after the game he said, privately, that he wished he hadn&#x27;t done it &quot;because I hate coppers so much&quot;. Reading eventually finished the 1974–75 season in seventh place, five points behind the promoted teams. Friday was the club&#x27;s top scorer for the season, with 18 league goals and 20 overall, and was voted its player of the year.

==== 1975–76 ====

Friday&#x27;s fine form continued into the 1975–76 season; after their 4–2 victory over Hartlepool United on 23 September 1975, Reading were top of the Fourth Division having just won four games in a row. Friday, meanwhile, was the club&#x27;s top scorer. The next game was against AFC Bournemouth on the 27th, and although Reading won 2–1 Friday was sent off after 79 minutes. By this time the forward was overwhelmingly popular among Reading&#x27;s fans, to whom he endeared himself by performing a lap of honour after each goal he scored. A month later, after two wins, two defeats and a draw during October, the team was fourth in the table.
Friday was arrested after the evening match away at Newport County on 20 October, accused of using obscene language outside a Newport nightclub. At his appearance before magistrates in Newport on 17 November, he pleaded not guilty, representing himself, and was acquitted. Performing strongly for Reading and scoring regularly, he began to attract serious interest from other clubs. &quot;Friday is, of course, much more than Reading&#x27;s top scorer and best striker&quot;, wrote the &quot;Evening Post&quot; on 3 November 1975. &quot;He is the most vital cog in the team, and last week I understand Reading turned down a £60,000 bid from Cardiff City involving Welsh international Derek Showers&quot;. By the new year, Reading were third in the table, on course for promotion and two points behind league leaders Lincoln City.

After Reading went four games without a win starting on 24 January 1976, a late goal from Friday ended this run on 25 February, in a home match against Hartlepool United; twelve minutes from time, he collected a pass from Stewart Henderson and neatly placed the ball past the goalkeeper from the edge of the penalty area. &quot;One is increasingly under the impression&quot;, the &quot;Evening Post&quot; reported, &quot;that if Friday was out for some time through injury the Reading team would fall to pieces&quot;. Led by the free-scoring Friday, the side continued its push for promotion; fourth or higher would be enough to go up. A vital fixture on 31 March 1976 pitted fourth-placed Reading at home against Tranmere Rovers, who occupied third spot; internationally experienced referee Clive Thomas took charge of the game. Friday, who had already scored 18 goals that season, rose to the occasion with an effort that has been described by many sources as one of the greatest ever scored.

With the score 2–0 to Reading, the goalkeeper Steve Death threw the ball to the right back Gary Peters, who spotted Friday standing near the left-hand corner of the opposing penalty area. Peters passed high and diagonally across the pitch towards his forward, who jumped into the air and used his chest to cushion the ball and knock it into the air with his back to goal, about 25–30 yards away from the net. As Friday landed, he ferociously powered the ball towards goal, kicking over his shoulder and turning after the ball had gone. The shot flew straight into the top-right-hand corner of the net, stunning the crowd, players and Thomas, the referee, who put his hands over his head in disbelief. &quot;I&#x27;ll never forget it&quot;, Thomas recalled. &quot;It was the sheer ferocity of the shot on the volley ... over his shoulder. ... If it hadn&#x27;t gone into the top corner of the net it would have broken the goalpost. Even up against the likes of Pelé and Cruyff, that rates as the best goal I have ever seen.&quot; Reading went on to win the game 5–0. When Thomas told Friday after the game that he had never seen a better goal, the Londoner replied, &quot;Really? You should come down here more often, I do that every week.&quot;

Reading moved to within one point of promotion on 19 April 1976 with a 1–0 home victory over Brentford. Friday set up the game&#x27;s only goal, beating three players before hitting the post with his shot; Ray Hiron scored from the rebound. Friday scored a powerful left-footed volley during the first half of a 2–2 draw away against Cambridge United two days later. The result secured Third Division football for Reading. At the celebratory dinner after the game, the Reading captain Gordon Cumming saw some fluted wine glasses, and voiced his admiration: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t mind a few of them for home&quot;, he said. &quot;Give us a few minutes and I&#x27;ll get them for you&quot;, replied Friday. Going around the dining room and picking them off the tables, he stole a whole boxful of the glasses, which he managed to sneak out of the hotel and onto the team coach, but much to Cumming&#x27;s annoyance he then decided to keep them for himself. With 22 goals for the year, 21 in the league, Friday was once more Reading&#x27;s top goalscorer and for the second consecutive season the team&#x27;s player of the year.

After Reading were promoted, Waller met with the players on 4 June 1976 to discuss their contracts for the 1976–77 season. The wages offered to the Reading players were far lower than they had been expecting, causing the team&#x27;s morale to fall drastically. &quot;We got screwed by the club&quot;, midfielder Eamon Dunphy later claimed. &quot;We didn&#x27;t get what we had been promised.&quot; Friday was so offended by the low salary offered that he handed in a transfer request, telling the &quot;Evening Post&quot; that the club&#x27;s directors clearly did not share his ambition. &quot;They would be happy to stroll along in the bottom half of the Third Division forever&quot;, he said. The row over the new contracts continued throughout the off-season, while Friday planned his second wedding; he had been formally divorced from Maxine after years of separation, and subsequently engaged to Liza Deimel, a Reading-born university graduate. After the pay dispute was settled on 5 August, the couple were married in Reading three days later. The wedding was filmed by Southern Television, before whose cameras Friday, wearing an open-necked tiger-skin-pattern shirt, brown velvet suit and snakeskin boots, sat on the steps of the church and rolled a joint. Friday had invited about two hundred people, mostly friends and relatives from London, who joined in the drinking and drug-taking and ending up fighting each other and stealing the couple&#x27;s wedding presents, one of which was a large quantity of cannabis. Liza later called the wedding &quot;the most hilarious thing ever&quot;. &quot;I have been to a few weddings&quot;, recalled Rod Lewington, &quot;but never one like that.&quot;

==== Later 1976 ====

&quot;He lost his way when we got promotion&quot;, Hurley later reflected. &quot;He really must have celebrated all through the summer&quot;. Friday reported back for pre-season training in bad condition, and although Hurley claimed that Friday was trying hard to regain fitness, the forward was having trouble with his asthma, had lost some of his pace and was obviously unfit. Although his performances during August quickly improved, they were still not up to his previous standard and the &quot;Evening Post&quot; revealed on the 30th that Reading were preparing to sell him &quot;to a First Division club&quot;. After scoring in two successive Reading home wins on 4 and 7 September, against Walsall and Wrexham respectively, Friday took part in a third consecutive victory on the 13th, away against Northampton Town. After this he missed two matches, according to the &quot;Post&quot; because he was suffering from flu, and when he returned to the team was far from his best; &quot;Suddenly he had lost a yard and his control of the ball was not as good&quot;, Hurley recalled.

Hurley was by now aware that his forward was using drugs, and attempted to keep his player&#x27;s habit a secret while he patiently worked to bring him back around. However, Friday began to regularly miss training and Hurley&#x27;s subtlety was misinterpreted as inaction by the other Reading players, who became unsettled and complained about Friday&#x27;s conduct. The club became increasingly minded to sell him, but although top-flight clubs Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United were interested, they were reluctant to buy because of Friday&#x27;s temperament; in Downs&#x27;s words, &quot;They weren&#x27;t sure they could handle him&quot;. By the end of October 1976, Hurley had given up on attempting to rehabilitate his player, believing that the only solution was to sell him to a bigger team. &quot;The squad needs you but I owe it to the club because I can&#x27;t have you using drugs,&quot; Hurley told Friday. &quot;If &quot;I&quot; know you&#x27;re using drugs it won&#x27;t take &quot;them&quot; [the major clubs] long to find out. You have got to get your act together.&quot; Friday was made available for transfer, at his own request, on 28 October.

Friday was watched by other clubs throughout November and December 1976, but although he performed well in some games, including a 1–1 draw away at Crystal Palace on 6 November in which he scored his team&#x27;s only goal, he was poor in others. After being marked out of the game during Reading&#x27;s 4–0 loss away against Mansfield Town on 8 November, he was substituted. &quot;Coincidence or not&quot;, wrote the &quot;Evening Post&quot;, &quot;when Friday left, so did half a dozen managers and scouts&quot;. Friday was so angry at his team&#x27;s performance that he broke into the Mansfield dressing room and defecated in the team bath. Reading&#x27;s asking price stood at £50,000, and the first transfer offer came from Second Division side Cardiff City around mid-December. Cardiff boss Jimmy Andrews bid £28,000, half of his offer a year before, which Reading&#x27;s directors accepted, wanting the troublesome player off their hands as quickly as possible. Friday was reluctant to go to the Welsh club, saying that it was too far from home, that he wanted to go to a First Division team and that he wanted more money than was being offered; however, when Hurley told him that unless he went to Cardiff he would be released, he agreed and travelled to Wales on 30 December 1976.

=== Cardiff City ===

==== 1977 ====
On arrival at Cardiff Central railway station, Friday was arrested by the British Transport Police for having travelled from Reading with only a platform ticket. Andrews bailed his new player out of police custody and took him to Ninian Park to sign the contract. Despite the manner of Friday&#x27;s arrival, and although he knew there &quot;had to be something wrong with him&quot;, the Cardiff manager was still happy with his purchase, describing the £28,000 transfer as &quot;an absolute steal&quot;. After a long night of drinking the night before his Cardiff debut, Friday lined up against Fulham on 1 January 1977. The Fulham defence included former England captain Bobby Moore, but Friday marked his first match for the Welsh club with two goals; he also squeezed Moore&#x27;s testicle during the game as Cardiff won 3–0. Andrews was so happy with Friday&#x27;s performance that he phoned Hurley two days later, on Monday morning. &quot;Oh, Charlie&quot;, Andrews gushed, &quot;he was magnificent. He tore them inside out. ... Moore was chasing him all over the place&quot;. The Cardiff manager continued to heap praise on his new acquisition until Hurley finally stopped him. &quot;Jimmy, you&#x27;ve only had him four days&quot;, he warned, sombrely: &quot;Give it a few months&quot;...

Friday&#x27;s form declined after his strong debut and his personal life remained troubled and chaotic, leading him to vanish regularly and miss Cardiff matches. He was supposed to be living in Bristol, but his manager would often find on visiting his house that he had been elsewhere for weeks. Leslie Hamilton, the Cardiff club doctor, later said that he had believed at the time that Andrews was being far too soft on Friday; indeed, according to teammate Paul Went, the forward would simply leave after each match and not be heard of until he returned for the next game. &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t even bother to have a shower&quot;, Went later said, in an interview. &quot;He&#x27;d just get dressed, take his carrier-bag with his dry martini and he&#x27;d go—no explanation&quot;.

While Hurley had been able to command Friday&#x27;s respect, it soon became clear that Andrews was unable to control him and that the Londoner disliked his new manager. Indeed, soon after moving to Cardiff, Friday appeared one day in Hurley&#x27;s office at Elm Park asking to come back to Reading. &quot;He still called me boss&quot;, Hurley recalled. &quot;I can&#x27;t play for that little bastard&quot;, Friday told Hurley, referring to Andrews. &quot;You&#x27;re the one who seems to be able to get me right. Can I come back to you?&quot; Hurley replied that although he would be happy to have Friday back on the team, the club could not afford to repay the £28,000 transfer fee to Cardiff, so he would have to go back and continue playing there. Unhappy living so far from home, Friday began to travel back to London at weekends; he avoided paying rail fares by knocking on locked toilet doors and shouting, &quot;Tickets, please!&quot;, pretending to be the ticket inspector. When the occupant passed his ticket under the door to be checked, Friday would pick it up, walk off and use it for himself. Paul Went also recalled an incident during training when he had thrown a ball out from goal and accidentally hit Friday on the back of the head. Steve Grapes, who was standing near the forward, started laughing, leading Friday to conclude that he had thrown the ball. Friday viciously punched Grapes in the jaw, striking him with such force that he wore a neck brace for two weeks afterwards.

Late in Friday&#x27;s first season in Wales, Cardiff took on Luton Town on 16 April 1977. Cardiff were in the relegation zone and had not won in seven games, while Luton were fifth in the table and challenging for promotion. After clashing repeatedly early in the match with Luton goalkeeper Milija Aleksic, Friday was lectured by the referee for a high tackle on the goalkeeper in the 36th minute. Friday held out a hand to apologise, but Aleksic reacted angrily. When the free kick was taken, Friday ran back, stole the ball from Luton defender John Faulkner, broke away, rounded Aleksic and slotted the ball past him into the net. In celebration, Friday jogged back past the goalkeeper while giving him the V-sign. Cardiff won the match 4–2 and at the end of the season avoided relegation to the third tier only on goal difference. Meanwhile, without Friday, Reading were relegated back to the Fourth Division by one point. Friday&#x27;s actions became even stranger during his time at Cardiff; after they lost the second leg of the Welsh Cup final 3–0 to Shrewsbury Town on 18 May 1977, the players and staff were awoken in the middle of the night by loud bangs coming from below their rooms. The cause was found to be Friday, standing on the hotel&#x27;s snooker table in his underpants and throwing the balls around the room in fury.

==== 1977–78 ====
After failing to turn up for pre-season training with Cardiff before the 1977–78 season, Friday was reported to be in a London hospital suffering from an unknown virus which had caused him to lose in weight. When he suddenly appeared in Cardiff for training in October, two months into the season, he claimed to have been suffering from hepatitis, but medical tests disproved this. However, it has since been discovered by Stuart Kane, author, that Friday had actually been arrested for impersonating a police officer and had been convicted at Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court on the 22 September 1977 where he was sent to HM Prison Pentonville but was bailed out shortly after before returning to Cardiff Andrews told the local press that on arrival Friday had looked &quot;like the fittest player in the world&quot;, and hoping to avoid further disappearances persuaded a reluctant Friday to move from Bristol to Cardiff. The Londoner returned to the team for the away match at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on 29 October 1977, with Cardiff once again in the relegation zone, in 20th place on goal difference.

Friday was marked during the game by Mark Lawrenson, who so frustrated the Cardiff forward with his close attention that Friday waited for Lawrenson to attempt a slide tackle and then kicked him in the face. After receiving a red card, Friday left the ground with the game still going on; according to legend, before leaving he broke into the Brighton dressing room and defecated in Lawrenson&#x27;s kit bag. Cardiff eventually lost 4–0. &quot;I am sick and tired of it&quot;, Andrews told the &quot;South Wales Echo&quot; on 1 November. &quot;To be sent off in his first game back is as much as a man can stand&quot;. Friday was transfer-listed and served a three-match suspension before making his final appearance on 10 December in Cardiff&#x27;s 6–3 away defeat against Bolton. Liza was by now the mother of Friday&#x27;s second daughter, Arabella, but around this time began divorce proceedings. Friday claimed that he had had enough of people telling him what to do, and walked into Andrews&#x27;s office on 20 December 1977 to announce that he was retiring from professional football. The club promptly released him and cancelled his contract.

== Post-retirement ==
After retiring, Friday moved back to London and returned to work as an asphalter and decorator. Soon after Friday left Cardiff, Reading manager Maurice Evans was presented with a petition, signed by 3,000 supporters, requesting that he attempt to re-sign Friday. Evans contacted Friday and told him: &quot;If you would just settle down for three or four years, you could play for England&quot;. Friday replied with the question &quot;How old are you?&quot;, and after Evans answered, continued: &quot;I&#x27;m half your age and I&#x27;ve lived twice your life&quot;. Evans reflected, &quot;You may well be right&quot;. Friday trained with Brentford during the 1978–79 pre-season, but after regaining his fitness suddenly changed his mind and stopped coming to training. He married for a third time in 1980, but was divorced again within three years. After a short time living back with his parents in Acton, Friday&#x27;s family secured him a housing association flat in the area. He served a prison sentence during the 1980s for impersonating a police officer and confiscating people&#x27;s drugs, and was found dead in his Acton flat on 22 December 1990 at the age of 38, having suffered a fatal heart attack. Biographer Paolo Hewitt claimed the incident to be the result of &quot;a suspected heroin overdose&quot;.

== Style of play and legacy ==
Friday is often cited as an unsung talent. His nickname while a player was &quot;Man Friday&quot; which was used as the title of two-fact based novels about him of the same name by author, Stuart Kane. A latterly applied nickname, &quot;the greatest footballer you never saw&quot;, was used as the title of his 1997 biography, co-written by Oasis bass player Paul McGuigan and Hewitt. Both as a player and a personality, Friday remains a major figure for both of his professional clubs. BBC Radio Berkshire Sports Editor Tim Dellor, speaking in 2010, emphasised the importance of Friday&#x27;s charisma to his contemporary and retrospective appeal, a point which was also highlighted by his second wife, Liza (and have one daughter together), who likened his personal charm to that of &quot;a pied piper&quot;. In terms of significance to Reading F.C., Dellor stated that Friday was the team&#x27;s &quot;very own George Best&quot;. Cardiff-based band Super Furry Animals used a photograph of him giving the V-sign to Aleksic in 1977 for the artwork of their 1996 single &quot;The Man Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck&quot;, which was dedicated to his memory &quot;and his stand against &#x27;the Man&#x27;.

After winning the title of &quot;Player of the Millennium&quot; from Reading in 1999, he was voted the top &quot;all-time cult hero&quot; for both Reading and Cardiff in a 2004 BBC poll; with similar polls taking place at each Premier League and Football League club, he was the only player to appear in the top three for two different sides. In 2007, a poll of fans run by Reading resulted in his once more being named the club&#x27;s best ever. Later that year, when the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association (PFA) canvassed Reading supporters for their all-time favourite, Friday won again. In a parallel PFA survey, Cardiff fans chose one of Friday&#x27;s former teammates, Wales international defender Phil Dwyer. Friday was ranked first in Channel 4&#x27;s list of football &quot;bad boys&quot; in August 2007, while &quot;Football365&quot; placed him at eighth place in a 2010 list of &quot;wasted talents&quot;.

Friday&#x27;s style of play was based around his exceptional ball skills, described by Cardiff doctor Leslie Hamilton as &quot;absolutely fabulous&quot;, and his instinctive footballing vision, which enabled him both to execute flamboyant individual moves and to create attacks for his teammates. Jimmy Andrews, his manager at Cardiff, later called Friday &quot;the complete centre-forward&quot; and placed him on a par with Alan Shearer, while Maurice Evans claimed that he could have played for England, and was at least on a level with international strikers he had worked with such as John Aldridge and Dean Saunders. This opinion was shared by Hamilton and Friday&#x27;s Reading teammate John Murray, both of whom firmly declared in separate interviews that Friday would have been good enough for the England team had he &quot;sorted his head out&quot;, in Hamilton&#x27;s words.

Friday was unselfish and would take just as much pleasure out of setting up a goal scored by a teammate as netting one himself. He possessed fine ball control and dribbling skills, and could also shoot with both great power and sharp accuracy. The strong physical aspect of his game and exceptionally competitive, combative spirit combined with all of this to create a formidable forward player: such was his ability that his arrival transformed Reading into one of the division&#x27;s best sides in a matter of weeks. Writing in 2010, Roger Titford stressed Friday&#x27;s immediate and profound impact on the Reading team as a key factor in his lasting popularity: &quot;It was like the comic-book stories that kids from Robin&#x27;s era would have read&quot;, he wrote. &quot;He was a ready-made star&quot;.

On top of his technical talent, Friday was physically very strong and able to withstand sustained blows or injuries. According to Hamilton, he was also uncommonly fit despite his lifestyle. He boasted an exceptional work-rate, which Dwyer recalled gave any side including him a strong boost: &quot;When he was in the line-up you&#x27;d have a centre-forward &quot;and&quot; a centre-half; not only would he be up there running them ragged, but when it broke down he&#x27;d be the first person to start tackling back&quot;. He was assisted in this by a smooth and effective sliding tackle which despite all of Friday&#x27;s attacking skills Hurley considered one of the strongest parts of his game. Reading F.C. historian David Downs described Friday&#x27;s style of play as &quot;really quite bizarre. It was more or less Robin standing in the middle and saying &#x27;Give me the ball and I&#x27;ll see what I can do with it&#x27;&quot;. On receiving the ball, he would then turn and either take on the opposing defence single-handed or run with it to the wing to cross for a teammate. &quot;We didn&#x27;t need anyone else up front&quot;, Hurley later said. &quot;They couldn&#x27;t get the ball off him. He was one of those guys who could beat five players easily&quot;. Andrews agreed: &quot;once he&#x27;d got the ball it was almost impossible to get it off him&quot;.

Friday was known for giving his all in any game in which he played, no matter the circumstances. Hurley later said that Friday would often become furious at his teammates for not trying their best, even in training. This strong drive to always win even extended to the use of physical intimidation to unsettle opposing players, leading contemporary critics to label him a &quot;villain&quot;. Friday also employed the use of psychological tactics; aiming to spook opposing players, Friday would kiss them or fondle their testicles. Cardiff teammate Paul Went recalled that these tricks would &quot;completely &quot; defenders and affect their concentration. Although he was often criticised for the number of bookings and sendings-off he received, Friday believed he was justified to chase victory by any means, explaining his attitude in a 1977 interview: &quot;On the pitch I hate all opponents. I don&#x27;t give a damn about anyone. People think I&#x27;m mad, a lunatic. I am a winner&quot;.

<text>Katerini (, &quot;Kateríni&quot;, ) is a city and municipality in northern Greece, the capital city of Regional Unit of Piera in Central Macedonia, Greece. It lies on the Pierian plain, between Mount Olympus and the Thermaikos Gulf, at an altitude of 14 m. The municipality of Katerini has a population of 82,892 (according to the 2021 census). It is the second most populous urban area in the region of Macedonia after Thessaloniki. The close distance between the two cities (68 km), has been beneficial for Katerini&#x27;s development over recent years. Katerini is accessible from the A1/E75 Athens–Thessaloniki motorway (with the Katerini&#x27;s South, East and North interchanges) and the A2 motorway to the north. It is served by Intercity, Proastiakos (suburban train) and local trains on the main Athens-Thessaloniki railway line and there is a comprehensive regional and national bus service with its hub in the city. 
A popular tourist destination in northern Greece, Katerini is close to the sea (7 km) and to several archaeological sites of great interest such as the ancient city of Dion (5th century BC, 17 km away), ancient Leivithra (27 km away), ancient Pydna (16 km away) and the Castle of Platamon. The beaches of Kallithea, Korinos, Olympiaki Akti (or &quot;Katerinoskala&quot;), Paralia (where the 3rd Port Authority Department of Skala Katerini is located), Peristasi are visited by both Greek and foreign tourists during the summer season. The base of Mount Olympus and the town of Litochoro, are at a distance of around 20 km from the center of Katerini. The ski center of Elatochori in Mount Pieria is at a distance of 33.4 km from the city&#x27;s center. 

==Name and history==
The origin of the name is obscure. Since the 13th century, travellers as well as maps record the existence of a settlement called Hatera (), which may have been the origin of the modern name. Thus Felix Beaujour recorded its name as &quot;Katheri&quot;, while François Pouqueville gives the name of the settlement as &quot;Kateri Hatera&quot;. According to another theory, the city derives its name from the small chapel dedicated to Saint Catherine (Greek: , Agia Aikaterini) to the east of the city, dating to at least the early 19th century. The latter hypothesis influenced official usage in Greek, where the city is found as &quot;Aikaterini&quot; (Greek: ) or &quot;Agia Aikaterini&quot; (Greek: ) until the early 20th century, when the vernacular name Katerini (Greek: ) prevailed. 
According to the reports of travellers, at the turn of the 19th century, the city had four to five thousand inhabitants, mostly Greeks. In 1806, William Martin Leake recorded 100 hearths, while four years later Daniel recorded 140. For the remainder of the 19th century, the number of homes remained steady at about 300, with a population in 1900 of 2,070 Orthodox Christians and 600 Muslims.

The city was liberated by the Greek 7th Infantry Division from the Ottoman rule and annexed to the Greece on 16 October 1912, during the First Balkan War. It has been part of Greece since then. Refugees from the Greek genocide settled in Katerini. With the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923 the city&#x27;s Muslims were expelled, while Greek refugees from Eastern Thrace and Greek Evangelicals from Asia Minor took their place, almost doubling the city&#x27;s population from 5,540 in 1920 to 10,138 in 1928. 

During Axis Occupation of Greece by the Axis Powers in World War II, Katerini went under Nazi German occupation on 14 April 1941, and was liberated on 26 October 1944.

<text>A rotary encoder, also called a shaft encoder, is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position or motion of a shaft or axle to analog or digital output signals.

There are two main types of rotary encoder: absolute and incremental. The output of an absolute encoder indicates the current shaft position, making it an angle transducer. The output of an incremental encoder provides information about the &quot;motion&quot; of the shaft, which typically is processed elsewhere into information such as position, speed and distance.

Rotary encoders are used in a wide range of applications that require monitoring or control, or both, of mechanical systems, including industrial controls, robotics, photographic lenses, computer input devices such as optomechanical mice and trackballs, controlled stress rheometers, and rotating radar platforms.

== Technologies ==

* Mechanical: Also known as conductive encoders. A series of circumferential copper tracks etched onto a PCB is used to encode the information via contact brushes sensing the conductive areas. Mechanical encoders are economical but susceptible to mechanical wear. They are common in human interfaces such as digital multimeters.
* Optical: This uses a light shining onto a photodiode through slits in a metal or glass disc. Reflective versions also exist. This is one of the most common technologies. Optical encoders are very sensitive to dust.
* On-Axis Magnetic: This technology typically uses a specially magnetized 2 pole neodymium magnet attached to the motor shaft. Because it can be fixed to the end of the shaft, it can work with motors that only have 1 shaft extending out of the motor body. The accuracy can vary from a few degrees to under 1 degree. Resolutions can be as low as 1 degree or as high as 0.09 degree (4000 CPR, Count per Revolution). Poorly designed internal interpolation can cause output jitter, but this can be overcome with internal sample averaging.
* Off-Axis Magnetic: This technology typically employs the use of rubber bonded ferrite magnets attached to a metal hub. This offers flexibility in design and low cost for custom applications. Due to the flexibility in many off axis encoder chips they can be programmed to accept any number of pole widths so the chip can be placed in any position required for the application. Magnetic encoders operate in harsh environments where optical encoders would fail to work.

==Basic types==
===Absolute===
An absolute encoder maintains position information when power is removed from the encoder. The position of the encoder is available immediately on applying power. The relationship between the encoder value and the physical position of the controlled machinery is set at assembly; the system does not need to return to a calibration point to maintain position accuracy.

An absolute encoder has multiple code rings with various binary weightings which provide a data word representing the absolute position of the encoder within one revolution. This type of encoder is often referred to as a parallel absolute encoder.

A multi-turn absolute rotary encoder includes additional code wheels and toothed wheels. A high-resolution wheel measures the fractional rotation, and lower-resolution geared code wheels record the number of whole revolutions of the shaft.

===Incremental===

An incremental encoder will immediately report changes in position, which is an essential capability in some applications. However, it does not report or keep track of absolute position. As a result, the mechanical system monitored by an incremental encoder may have to be homed (moved to a fixed reference point) to initialize absolute position measurements.

==Absolute encoder==
===Absolute rotary encoder===

====Construction====
Digital absolute encoders produce a unique digital code for each distinct angle of the shaft. They come in two basic types: optical and mechanical.

====Mechanical absolute encoders====
A metal disc containing a set of concentric rings of openings is fixed to an insulating disc, which is rigidly fixed to the shaft. A row of sliding contacts is fixed to a stationary object so that each contact wipes against the metal disc at a different distance from the shaft. As the disc rotates with the shaft, some of the contacts touch metal, while others fall in the gaps where the metal has been cut out. The metal sheet is connected to a source of electric current, and each contact is connected to a separate electrical sensor. The metal pattern is designed so that each possible position of the axle creates a unique binary code in which some of the contacts are connected to the current source (i.e. switched on) and others are not (i.e. switched off).

Brush-type contacts are susceptible to wear, and consequently mechanical encoders are typically found in low-speed applications such as manual volume or tuning controls in a radio receiver.

====Optical absolute encoders====
The optical encoder&#x27;s disc is made of glass or plastic with transparent and opaque areas. A light source and photo detector array reads the optical pattern that results from the disc&#x27;s position at any one time.
The Gray code is often used.
This code can be read by a controlling device, such as a microprocessor or microcontroller to determine the angle of the shaft.

The absolute analog type produces a unique dual analog code that can be translated into an absolute angle of the shaft.

====Magnetic absolute encoders====
The magnetic encoder uses a series of magnetic poles (2 or more) to represent the encoder position to a magnetic sensor (typically magneto-resistive or Hall Effect). The magnetic sensor reads the magnetic pole positions.

This code can be read by a controlling device, such as a microprocessor or microcontroller to determine the angle of the shaft, similar to an optical encoder.

The absolute analog type produces a unique dual analog code that can be translated into an absolute angle of the shaft (by using a special algorithm).

Due to the nature of recording magnetic effects, these encoders may be optimal to use in conditions where other types of encoders may fail due to dust or debris accumulation. Magnetic encoders are also relatively insensitive to vibrations, minor misalignment, or shocks.

;Brushless motor commutation
Built-in rotary encoders are used to indicate the angle of the motor shaft in permanent magnet brushless motors, which are commonly used on CNC machines, robots, and other industrial equipment. In such cases, the encoder serves as a feedback device that plays a vital role in proper equipment operation. Brushless motors require electronic commutation, which often is implemented in part by using rotor magnets as a low-resolution absolute encoder (typically six or twelve pulses per revolution). The resulting shaft angle information is conveyed to the servo drive to enable it to energize the proper stator winding at any moment in time.

====Capacitive absolute encoders====
An asymmetrical shaped disc is rotated within the encoder. This disc will change the capacitance between two electrodes which can be measured and calculated back to an angular value.

===Absolute multi-turn encoder===
A multi-turn encoder can detect and store more than one revolution. The term absolute multi-turn encoder is generally used if the encoder will detect movements of its shaft even if the encoder is not provided with external power.

====Battery-powered multi-turn encoder====
This type of encoder uses a battery for retaining the counts across power cycles. It uses energy conserving electrical design to detect the movements.

====Geared multi-turn encoder====
These encoders use a train of gears to mechanically store the number of revolutions. The position of the single gears is detected with one of the above-mentioned technologies.

====Self-powered multi-turn encoder====
These encoders use the principle of energy harvesting to generate energy from the moving shaft. This principle, introduced in 2007, uses a Wiegand sensor to produce electricity sufficient to power the encoder and write the turns count to non-volatile memory.

===Ways of encoding shaft position===

====Standard binary encoding====
An example of a binary code, in an extremely simplified encoder with only three contacts, is shown below.

In general, where there are &quot;n&quot; contacts, the number of distinct positions of the shaft is 2&quot;n&quot;. In this example, &quot;n&quot; is 3, so there are 2³ or 8 positions.

In the above example, the contacts produce a standard binary count as the disc rotates. However, this has the drawback that if the disc stops between two adjacent sectors, or the contacts are not perfectly aligned, it can be impossible to determine the angle of the shaft. To illustrate this problem, consider what happens when the shaft angle changes from 179.9° to 180.1° (from sector 3 to sector 4). At some instant, according to the above table, the contact pattern changes from off-on-on to on-off-off. However, this is not what happens in reality. In a practical device, the contacts are never perfectly aligned, so each switches at a different moment. If contact 1 switches first, followed by contact 3 and then contact 2, for example, the actual sequence of codes is:

:off-on-on (starting position)
:on-on-on (first, contact 1 switches on)
:on-on-off (next, contact 3 switches off)
:on-off-off (finally, contact 2 switches off)

Now look at the sectors corresponding to these codes in the table. In order, they are 3, 7, 6 and then 4. So, from the sequence of codes produced, the shaft appears to have jumped from sector 3 to sector 7, then gone backwards to sector 6, then backwards again to sector 4, which is where we expected to find it. In many situations, this behaviour is undesirable and could cause the system to fail. For example, if the encoder were used in a robot arm, the controller would think that the arm was in the wrong position, and try to correct the error by turning it through 180°, perhaps causing damage to the arm.

====Gray encoding====
To avoid the above problem, Gray coding is used. This is a system of binary counting in which any two adjacent codes differ by only one bit position. For the three-contact example given above, the Gray-coded version would be as follows.

In this example, the transition from sector 3 to sector 4, like all other transitions, involves only one of the contacts changing its state from on to off or vice versa. This means that the sequence of incorrect codes shown in the previous illustration cannot happen.

====Single-track Gray encoding====
If the designer moves a contact to a different angular position (but at the same distance from the center shaft), then the corresponding &quot;ring pattern&quot; needs to be rotated the same angle to give the same output. If the most significant bit (the inner ring in Figure 1) is rotated enough, it exactly matches the next ring out. Since both rings are then identical, the inner ring can be omitted, and the sensor for that ring moved to the remaining, identical ring (but offset at that angle from the other sensor on that ring). Those two sensors on a single ring make a quadrature encoder with a single ring.

It is possible to arrange several sensors around a single track (ring) so that consecutive positions differ at only a single sensor; the result is the single-track Gray code encoder.

===Data output methods===
Depending on the device and manufacturer, an absolute encoder may use any of several signal types and communication protocols to transmit data, including parallel binary, analog signals (current or voltage), and serial bus systems such as SSI, BiSS, Heidenhain EnDat, Sick-Stegmann Hiperface, DeviceNet, Modbus, Profibus, CANopen and EtherCAT, which typically employ Ethernet or RS-422/RS-485 physical layers.

==Incremental encoder==

The rotary incremental encoder is the most widely used of all rotary encoders due to its ability to provide real-time position information. The measurement resolution of an incremental encoder is not limited in any way by its two internal, incremental movement sensors; one can find in the market incremental encoders with up to 10,000 counts per revolution, or more.

Rotary incremental encoders report position changes without being prompted to do so, and they convey this information at data rates which are orders of magnitude faster than those of most types of absolute shaft encoders. Because of this, incremental encoders are commonly used in applications that require precise measurement of position and velocity.

A rotary incremental encoder may use mechanical, optical or magnetic sensors to detect rotational position changes. The mechanical type is commonly employed as a manually operated &quot;digital potentiometer&quot; control on electronic equipment. For example, modern home and car stereos typically use mechanical rotary encoders as volume controls. Encoders with mechanical sensors require switch debouncing and consequently are limited in the rotational speeds they can handle. The optical type is used when higher speeds are encountered or a higher degree of precision is required.

A rotary incremental encoder has two output signals, A and B, which issue a periodic digital waveform in quadrature when the encoder shaft rotates. This is similar to sine encoders, which output sinusoidal waveforms in quadrature (i.e., sine and cosine), thus combining the characteristics of an encoder and a resolver. The waveform frequency indicates the speed of shaft rotation and the number of pulses indicates the distance moved, whereas the A-B phase relationship indicates the direction of rotation.

Some rotary incremental encoders have an additional &quot;index&quot; output (typically labeled Z), which emits a pulse when the shaft passes through a particular angle. Once every rotation, the Z signal is asserted, typically always at the same angle, until the next AB state change. This is commonly used in radar systems and other applications that require a registration signal when the encoder shaft is located at a particular reference angle.

Unlike absolute encoders, an incremental encoder does not keep track of, nor do its outputs indicate the absolute position of the mechanical system to which it is attached. Consequently, to determine the absolute position at any particular moment, it is necessary to &quot;track&quot; the absolute position with an incremental encoder interface which typically includes a bidirectional electronic counter.

Inexpensive incremental encoders are used in mechanical computer mice. Typically, two encoders are used: one to sense left-right motion and another to sense forward-backward motion.

===Rotary (Angle) Pulse Encoder===

A Rotary (Angle) Pulse Encoder has a SPDT switch for each direction, with each one only operating in the direction of travel. Each turn indent in one direction causes the SPDT switch associated with that direction only to toggle. 

===Other pulse-output rotary encoders===
Rotary encoders with a single output (i.e. tachometers) cannot be used to sense direction of motion but are suitable for measuring speed and for measuring position when the direction of travel is constant. In certain applications they may be used to measure distance of motion (e.g. feet of movement).

<doc id="741028" wikidata="Q5054575" url="?curid=741028" title="Causal theory of reference">
<text>A causal theory of reference or historical chain theory of reference is a theory of how terms acquire specific referents based on evidence. Such theories have been used to describe many referring terms, particularly logical terms, proper names, and natural kind terms. In the case of names, for example, a causal theory of reference typically involves the following claims:

* a name&#x27;s referent is fixed by an original act of naming (also called a &quot;dubbing&quot; or, by Saul Kripke, an &quot;initial baptism&quot;), whereupon the name becomes a rigid designator of that object.
* later uses of the name succeed in referring to the referent by being linked to that original act via a causal chain.

Weaker versions of the position (perhaps not properly called &quot;causal theories&quot;) claim merely that, in many cases, events in the causal history of a speaker&#x27;s use of the term, including when the term was first acquired, must be considered to correctly assign references to the speaker&#x27;s words.

Causal theories of names became popular during the 1970s, under the influence of work by Saul Kripke and Keith Donnellan. Kripke and Hilary Putnam also defended an analogous causal account of natural kind terms.

== Kripke&#x27;s causal account of names ==
In lectures later published as &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot;, Kripke provided a rough outline of his causal theory of reference for names. Although he refused to explicitly endorse such a theory, he indicated that such an approach was far more promising than the then-popular descriptive theory of names introduced by Russell, according to which names are in fact disguised definite descriptions. Kripke argued that in order to use a name successfully to refer to something, you do not have to be acquainted with a uniquely identifying description of that thing. Rather, your use of the name need only be caused (in an appropriate way) by the naming of that thing.

Such a causal process might proceed as follows: the parents of a newborn baby name it, pointing to the child and saying &quot;we&#x27;ll call her &#x27;Jane&#x27;.&quot; Henceforth everyone calls her &#x27;Jane&#x27;. With that act, the parents give the girl her name. The assembled family and friends now know that &#x27;Jane&#x27; is a name which refers to Jane. This is referred to as Jane&#x27;s dubbing, naming, or initial baptism.

However, not everyone who knows Jane and uses the name &#x27;Jane&#x27; to refer to her was present at this naming. So how is it that when &quot;they&quot; use the name &#x27;Jane&#x27;, they are referring to Jane? The answer provided by causal theories is that there is a causal chain that passes from the original observers of Jane&#x27;s naming to everyone else who uses her name. For example, maybe Jill was not at the naming, but Jill learns about Jane, and learns that her name is &#x27;Jane&#x27;, from Jane&#x27;s mother, who &quot;was&quot; there. She then uses the name &#x27;Jane&#x27; with the intention of referring to the child Jane&#x27;s mother referred to. Jill can now use the name, and her use of it can in turn transmit the ability to refer to Jane to other speakers.

Philosophers such as Gareth Evans have insisted that the theory&#x27;s account of the dubbing process needs to be broadened to include what are called &#x27;multiple groundings&#x27;. After her initial baptism, uses of &#x27;Jane&#x27; in the presence of Jane may, under the right circumstances, be considered to further ground the name (&#x27;Jane&#x27;) in its referent (Jane). That is, if I am in direct contact with Jane, the reference for my utterance of the name &#x27;Jane&#x27; may be fixed not simply by a causal chain through people who had encountered her earlier (when she was first named); it may also be indexically fixed to Jane at the moment of my utterance. Thus our modern day use of a name such as &#x27;Christopher Columbus&#x27; can be thought of as referring to Columbus through a causal chain that terminates not simply in one instance of his naming, but rather in a series of grounding uses of the name that occurred throughout his life. Under certain circumstances of confusion, this can lead to the alteration of a name&#x27;s referent (for one example of how this might happen, see Twin Earth thought experiment).

== Motivation ==
Causal theories of reference were born partially in response to the widespread acceptance of Russellian descriptive theories. Russell found that certain logical contradictions could be avoided if names were considered disguised definite descriptions (a similar view is often attributed to Gottlob Frege, mostly on the strength of a footnoted comment in &quot;On Sense and Reference&quot;, although many Frege scholars consider this attribution misguided). On such an account, the name &#x27;Aristotle&#x27; might be seen as meaning &#x27;the student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great&#x27;. Later description theorists expanded upon this by suggesting that a name expressed not one particular description, but many (perhaps constituting all of one&#x27;s essential knowledge of the individual named), or a weighted average of these descriptions.

Kripke found this account to be deeply flawed, for a number of reasons. Notably:

* We can successfully refer to individuals for whom we have &quot;no&quot; uniquely identifying description. (For example, a speaker can talk about Phillie Sophik even if one only knows him as &#x27;some poet&#x27;.)
* We can successfully refer to individuals for whom the only identifying descriptions we have fail to refer as we believe them to. (Many speakers have no identifying beliefs about Christopher Columbus other than &#x27;the first European in North America&#x27; or &#x27;the first person to believe that the earth was round&#x27;. Both of these beliefs are incorrect. Nevertheless, when such a person says &#x27;Christopher Columbus&#x27;, we acknowledge that they are referring to Christopher Columbus, not to whatever individual satisfies one of those descriptions.)
* We use names to speak hypothetically about what &quot;could&quot; have happened to a person. A name functions as a rigid designator, while a definite description does not. (One could say &#x27;If Aristotle had died young, he would never have taught Alexander the Great.&#x27; But if &#x27;the teacher of Alexander the Great&#x27; were a component of the &quot;meaning&quot; of &#x27;Aristotle&#x27; then this would be nonsense.)

A causal theory avoids these difficulties. A name refers rigidly to the bearer to which it is causally connected, regardless of any particular facts about the bearer, and in all possible worlds where the bearer exists.

The same motivations apply to causal theories in regard to other sorts of terms. Putnam, for instance, attempted to establish that &#x27;water&#x27; refers rigidly to the stuff that we do in fact call &#x27;water&#x27;, to the exclusion of any possible identical water-like substance for which we have no causal connection. These considerations motivate semantic externalism. Because speakers interact with a natural kind such as water regularly, and because there is generally no naming ceremony through which their names are formalized, the multiple groundings described above are even more essential to a causal account of such terms. A speaker whose environment changes may thus observe that the referents of his terms shift, as described in the Twin Earth and Swampman thought experiments.

== Variations ==
Variations of the causal theory include:
* The causal-historical theory of reference is the original version of the causal theory. It was put forward by Keith Donnellan in 1972 and Saul Kripke in 1980. This view introduces the idea of reference-passing links in a causal-historical chain.
* The descriptive-causal theory of reference (also causal-descriptive theory of reference), a view put forward by David Lewis in 1984, introduces the idea that a minimal descriptive apparatus needs to be added to the causal relations between speaker and object.

== Criticism of the theory ==
Gareth Evans argued that the causal theory, or at least certain common and over-simple variants of it, have the consequence that, however remote or obscure the causal connection between someone&#x27;s use of a proper name and the object it originally referred to, they still refer to that object when they use the name. (Imagine a name briefly overheard in a train or café.) The theory effectively ignores context and makes reference into a magic trick. Evans describes it as a &quot;photograph&quot; theory of reference.

The links between different users of the name are particularly obscure. Each user must somehow pass the name on to the next, and must somehow &quot;mean&quot; the right individual as they do so (suppose &quot;Socrates&quot; is the name of a pet aardvark). Kripke himself notes the difficulty, John Searle makes much of it.

Mark Sainsbury argued for a causal theory similar to Kripke&#x27;s, except that the baptised object is eliminated. A &quot;baptism&quot; may be a baptism of nothing, he argues: a name can be intelligibly introduced even if it names nothing. The causal chain we associate with the use of proper names may begin merely with a &quot;journalistic&quot; source.

The causal theory has a difficult time explaining the phenomenon of reference change. Gareth Evans cites the example of when Marco Polo unknowingly referred to the African Island as &quot;Madagascar&quot; when the natives actually used the term to refer to a part of the mainland. Evans claims that Polo clearly intended to use the term as the natives do, but somehow changed the meaning of the term &quot;Madagascar&quot; to refer to the island as it is known today. Michael Devitt claims that repeated groundings in an object can account for reference change. However, such a response leaves open the problem of cognitive significance that originally intrigued Russell and Frege.

<text>Edward Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Fincke (born March 14, 1967) is an American astronaut and retired United States Air Force colonel. He formerly held the American record for the most time in space (381.6 days) until it was broken by Scott Kelly on October 16, 2015. Col. Fincke has logged nine spacewalks totaling 48 hours and 37 minutes of EVA time. He is unique in that six of those spacewalks were in the Russian Orlan spacesuit.

Mike Fincke was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but considers its suburb Emsworth to be his hometown. He is a retired United States Air Force officer and an active NASA astronaut. So far he served two tours aboard the International Space Station as a flight engineer and commander. He flew on one Space Shuttle mission, STS-134 as a mission specialist. Fincke is conversant in Japanese and Russian. He is married to Renita Saikia, and together, they have three children; son Chandra and daughters Tarali and Surya.

Fincke logged just under 382 days in space, placing him sixth among American astronauts for the most time in space and 40th overall. He completed nine spacewalks in Russian Orlan spacesuits and American EMUs. His total EVA time is 48 hours and 37 minutes, placing him 14th all time on the list of spacewalkers.

== Education ==
Fincke graduated from Sewickley Academy in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, in 1985. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on an Air Force ROTC scholarship and graduated in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautics and astronautics as well as a Bachelor of Science degree in Earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences. He then received a Master of Science degree in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford University in 1990, and a second Master of Science degree in planetary geology from the University of Houston–Clear Lake in 2001. He also attended El Camino College in Torrance, California, where he studied Japanese and geology.

== Career ==
Immediately after graduating from MIT in 1989, Fincke attended a summer exchange program with the Moscow Aviation Institute in the former Soviet Union, now Russia, where he studied Cosmonautics. After graduation from Stanford University in 1990, Fincke entered the United States Air Force where he was assigned to the Air Force Space and Missiles Systems Center, Los Angeles Air Force Base in California. There he served as a Space Systems Engineer and a Space Test Engineer. In 1994, upon completion of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School, Edwards Air Force Base in California, Fincke joined the 39th Flight Test Squadron, Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, where he served as a flight test engineer working on a variety of flight test programs, flying the F-16 and F-15 aircraft. In January 1996, he reported to the Gifu Test Center, Gifu Air Base in Japan, where he was the United States flight test liaison to the Japanese/United States XF-2 fighter program. By 2005, Fincke had accumulated over 800 flight hours in more than 30 different varieties of aircraft and held the rank of colonel. Fincke belongs to the Geological Society of America and the British Interplanetary Society.

== NASA career ==
Fincke was selected by NASA in April 1996 to be an astronaut. He reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. Having completed two years of training and evaluation, he was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Station Operations Branch serving as an International Space Station spacecraft communicator (ISS CAPCOM), a member of the Crew Test Support Team in Russia and as the ISS crew procedures team lead.

In July 1999, Fincke was assigned as backup crewmember for the International Space Station Expedition 4 crew. Additionally he served as a backup for the ISS Expedition 6 crew and is qualified to fly as a left-seat flight engineer (co-pilot) on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. He was the commander of the second NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO 2) mission, living and working underwater for 7 days in May 2002.

In 2013, Fincke served as cavenaut into the ESA CAVES training in Sardinia, alongside Soichi Noguchi, Andreas Mogensen, Nikolai Tikhonov, Andrew Feustel and David Saint-Jacques.

=== Expedition 9 ===

Fincke was the space station science officer and flight engineer for ISS Expedition 9 from April 18 through October 23, 2004. Expedition 9 was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan aboard the Soyuz TMA-4 spacecraft, and docked with the International Space Station on April 21, 2004. Fincke spent six months aboard the ISS continuing ISS science operations, maintaining station systems, and performing four spacewalks. The Expedition-9 mission concluded with undocking from the station and safe landing back in Kazakhstan on October 23, 2004. Fincke completed his first mission in 187 days, 21 hours and 17 minutes, and logged a total of 15 hours, 45 minutes and 22 seconds of EVA time in four spacewalks.

Fincke was the backup commander for Expedition 13 and Expedition 16.

=== Expedition 18 ===

Fincke was commander of Expedition 18. He arrived at the International Space Station aboard the Soyuz TMA-13 on October 14, 2008, with Cosmonaut Yuri Lonchakov and space flight participant Richard Garriott. While Richard Garriott was aboard, Fincke participated during his personal time (along with Yury Lonchakov, Gregory Chamitoff and Richard Garriott) in filming and starring in a science-fiction movie made in space, &quot;Apogee of Fear&quot;. On April 8, 2009, Fincke, Lonchakov and space tourist Charles Simonyi returned to Earth aboard the TMA-13.

Replacing Fincke as commander of the space station was Gennady Padalka, whom Fincke served with on Expedition 9.

=== STS-134 ===
Fincke was a mission specialist on STS-134, which was his first and only flight on a Space Shuttle. Fincke made three spacewalks during the mission. He has completed 26 hours and 12 minutes of spacewalking time, bringing his total EVA time to 48 hours and 37 minutes. This places him 11th all time on the list of spacewalkers.

=== Commercial Crew Program ===


Fincke has been deeply involved with NASA&#x27;s Commercial Crew Program for over a decade. In 2014, he served as the Astronaut Office Chief of the Commercial Crew Branch during the original Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contracts award. He has contributed significantly to the development of both the SpaceX Crew Dragon and Boeing CST-100 Starliner spacecraft.
In January 2019, NASA announced that Fincke would fly on Boeing CST-100 Starliner’s Crew Flight Test. . However, in June 2022, NASA revised the mission to a two-person flight test, with Fincke serving as the backup spacecraft test pilot. On September 30, 2022, NASA announced that Fincke would fly as the pilot on the Starliner&#x27;s first operational mission, Boeing Starliner-1 (PCM-1). 

Fincke has been certified as a co-pilot/flight engineer for the Soyuz spacecraft, a member of the Space Shuttle flight deck crew, and a pilot for Starliner. His extensive work in spacecraft development included significant contributions to Starliner&#x27;s development through his work in the Avionics and Software Integration Lab (ASIL), focusing on flight software refinement, systems integration, and human-spacecraft interfaces.
Throughout his career, Fincke has remained at the forefront of testing and developing human-rated spacecraft, leveraging his engineering, flight test, and astronaut experience to contribute to the next era of space exploration.

<text>Anotopterus nikparini is a species of fish in the family Anotopteridae, the daggertooths. It is native to the northern Pacific Ocean, where it occurs as far north as the Bering Sea and as far south as Japan and Baja California.

This fish can be found near the surface to depths below 2000 meters. Populations in colder regions are mainly larger, older adults.

This species feeds on molluscs, crustaceans, marine worms, salps, and fish. It is an important predator of Pacific salmon. In turn, it is a prey item for whales and large fish such as albacore, lancetfish, halibut, steelhead, pomfret, and blue shark.

<text>Monte Córdova is a civil parish in the Portuguese municipality of Santo Tirso, located 4 kilometres east of the municipal seat. The population in 2011 was 3,958, in an area of .

==History==

São Salvador de Monte Córdova is an ancient parish that was first mentioned in recorded documents in 959.

Roman forces occupied this region, in order to pacify its population, as part of its occupation from the Pyrenees to the Atlantic, Canterbury to the Mediterranean. They forced a restructuring of society, promoting the occupation of the open plains rather than the hilltops, which were typical at the time. The difficulty encountered by the Romans in this area, resulted in the Greek historian Strabo identifying the Lusitanian region and its peoples as the most powerful groups in the Iberian Peninsula.

On Monte Padrão existed the ruins of a castro. The Castro of Monte Padrão, until the end of the 16th century, existed as the parochial church, being under the primitive monastery of Celanova, in Galicia.

==Geography==
The civil parish of Monte Córdova is situated 30 kilometres from Porto, and accessible by the EN105 motorway to many of the local communities, including Braga, Famalicão and Guimarães.

For many centuries, the geomorphology of the terrain was responsible for the relative isolation of its populations. The parish is located at about 410–420 metres above sea level, in an area called the Agrela da Assunção escarpment. Alto de Cabanas is one of the best natural lookouts in the region, and the area of Valinhas, with its monumental oak forests and curious chapel, near the Fervença waterfalls (or the Leça River), are almost obligatory natural sites of the landscape.

==Economy==
For a long time Monte Córdova was considered the &quot;breadbasket&quot; of Santo Tirso (). However, primary activities have diminished considerably over time so that the totality of the lands cultivated today only provide subsistence resources for the local community, or to complement family income. The secondary economic activities are dominated by industries such as sawmilling, carpentry and associated services.

==Architecture==
The parish of Monte Córdova has many cultural monuments and buildings spread throughout its territory, but the following have been classified in the National Registry of Patrimony by IGESPAR:

===Civic===
* Castro of Monte Padrão ()
* Monte Córdova Primary School ()
* Pereiras&#x27; Sierra Hydraulic Building ()

===Religious===
* Chapel of São Gonçalo ()
* Church of Nossa Senhora da Assunção () - designed by the Italian architect Korrrodi, the basilica-like church houses the image of Nossa Senhora da Assunção (&quot;Our Lady of the Assumption&quot;), considered one of the best conserved sculptures from the late 19th century sculptor João da Fonseca Lapa.

==Culture==
Annually, there are pilgrimages in honour of São Salvador, in the area of Santa Luzia involving its 12th century chapel.

<doc id="741036" wikidata="Q1133606" url="?curid=741036" title="Newton scale">
<text>The Newton scale is a temperature scale devised by Isaac Newton in 1701. He called his device a &quot;thermometer&quot;, but he did not use the term &quot;temperature&quot;, speaking of &quot;degrees of heat&quot; () instead. Newton&#x27;s publication represents the first attempt to introduce an objective way of measuring (what would come to be called) temperature (alongside the Rømer scale published at nearly the same time). Newton likely developed his scale for practical use rather than for a theoretical interest in thermodynamics; he had been appointed Warden of the Mint in 1695, and Master of the Mint in 1699, and his interest in the melting points of metals was likely inspired by his duties in connection with the Royal Mint.

Newton used linseed oil as thermometric material and measured its change of volume against his reference points. He set as 0 on his scale &quot;the heat of air in winter at which water begins to freeze&quot; (), reminiscent of the standard of the modern Celsius scale (i.e. 0 °N = 0 °C), but he has no single second reference point; he does give the &quot;heat at which water begins to boil&quot; as 33, but this is not a defining reference; the values for body temperature and the freezing and boiling point of water suggest a conversion factor between the Newton and the Celsius scale of between about 3.08 (12 °N = 37 °C) and 3.03 (33 °N = 100 °C) but since the objectively verifiable reference points given result in irreconcilable data (especially for high temperatures), no unambiguous &quot;conversion&quot; between the scales is possible.

The linseed thermometer could be used up to the melting point of tin. For higher temperatures, Newton used a &quot;sufficiently thick piece of iron&quot; that was heated until red-hot and then exposed to the wind. On this piece of iron, samples of metals and alloys were placed, which melted and then again solidified on cooling. Newton then determined the &quot;degrees of heat&quot; of these samples based on the solidification times, and tied this scale to the linseed one by measuring the melting point of tin in both systems. This second system of measurement led Newton to derive his law of convective heat transfer, also known as Newton&#x27;s law of cooling.

In his publication, Newton gives 18 reference points (in addition to a range of meteorological air temperatures), which he labels by two systems, one in arithmetic progression and the other in geometric progression, as follows:

<text>Francis Hayman (1708 – 2 February 1776) was an English painter and illustrator who became one of the founding members of the Royal Academy in 1768, and later its first librarian.

==Life and works==
Born in Exeter, Devon, Hayman begun his artistic career as a scene painter in London&#x27;s Drury Lane theatre (where he also appeared in minor roles) before establishing a studio in St Martin&#x27;s Lane.

A versatile artist influenced by the French Rococo style, he achieved some note during the 1740s through decorative paintings executed for the supper boxes at Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens in London. Hayman was also a successful portraitist and history painter.

Combining some of these, he contributed 31 pictures to a 1744 edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays by Sir Thomas Hanmer, and later portrayed many leading contemporary actors in Shakespearean roles, including David Garrick as Richard III (1760). He also illustrated Pamela, a novel by Samuel Richardson, Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and &quot;Paradise Regained&quot;, Tobias Smollett&#x27;s translation of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, and other well-known works. In the 1760s Hayman was commissioned by Jonathan Tyers, proprietor of Vauxhall Gardens and the Denbies estate, to paint a series of large-scale history paintings depicting British victories in the Seven Years&#x27; War.

He was an able teacher. His pupils included Mason Chamberlin, Nathaniel Dance-Holland, Thomas Seton and Lemuel Francis Abbott, and he was also a strong influence on Thomas Gainsborough.

With Joshua Reynolds, Hayman was actively involved in the formation of the Society of Artists, a forerunner of the Royal Academy, during the early 1760s.

Hayman died in 1776 and was buried in an unmarked grave in St Anne&#x27;s Church, Soho.

<doc id="741046" wikidata="Q1994063" url="?curid=741046" title="Nits (band)">
<text>Nits (known until 1989 as The Nits) are a Dutch pop group founded in 1974. Their musical style has varied considerably over the years, as has their line-up with the core of Henk Hofstede (the group&#x27;s lead singer and lyricist), Rob Kloet, drummer, and Robert Jan Stips (Supersister, Gruppo Sportivo, Golden Earring), keyboards.

Their biggest hit in the Netherlands was &quot;Nescio&quot; (1983), a tribute to the Dutch author Jan Hendrik Frederik Grönloh. The major hit that brought the band to the attention of an international audience was &quot;In the Dutch Mountains&quot; (1987). Other well-known Nits songs include &quot;J.O.S. Days&quot;, &quot;Adieu, Sweet Bahnhof&quot; and &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot;. Top 10 albums include &quot;Omsk&quot; (1983), &quot;In the Dutch Mountains&quot; (1987), &quot;Urk&quot; (1989), &quot;Doing the Dishes&quot; (2008) and &quot;Hotel Europa&quot; (2015).

==Early history==

The Nits originally consisted of Henk Hofstede (vocals, guitar), Alex Roelofs (bass), Michiel Peters (guitar) and Rob Kloet (drums). Influenced by British pop music, especially the Beatles, they also incorporated influences from new wave music into their sound. They made their live debut in 1974, and released their self-financed, limited-run debut LP, &quot;The Nits&quot;, in 1978. This brought them to the attention of Columbia Records, for whom The Nits would continue to record for the next 22 years. Their major-label debut, &quot;Tent&quot; (1979), carried on the new wave style of &quot;The Nits&quot;, but was considerably more polished, partly due to the influence of producer Robert Jan Stips. On New Flat (1980) and Work (1981), which made increasing use of synthesisers, &quot;Hofstede reveals a growing aptitude for creating little emotional postcards.&quot;&quot;The obvious derivativeness on the Nits&#x27; early albums could have been written off as cut-rate local flirtation/reassembly of the real thing from Britain and America (Beatles, Talking Heads, etc.). In retrospect, however, those records could be seen as learning experiences of a world-class band now deserving international attention.&quot;

==Omsk &amp; Adieu, Sweet Bahnhof==
In the meantime, the group had been developing their sound on their numerous European tours. Many songs were radically reworked for live performance, a practice the group would continue throughout their career. Between the group&#x27;s experiments with different arrangements, and the addition of Stips to the line-up, The Nits gradually moved toward a more distinctive musical style, with Kloet playing a wide range of percussion, and Stips&#x27; keyboards used to produce a lusher sound. &quot;Omsk&quot; showcased the new Nits sound with songs like &quot;A Touch of Henry Moore&quot;, almost entirely based around Kloet&#x27;s percussion, and the dramatic hit single &quot;Nescio&quot;. The follow-up &quot;Adieu, Sweet Bahnhof&quot; was another hit, but tensions between the group and producer Jaap Eggermont led to the departure of Peters, and a change in the group&#x27;s working methods. In future, they would produce their own material and bring in guest musicians as required.

==Henk, In the Dutch Mountains &amp; Urk==
The album &quot;Henk&quot; - which included such classic songs as Bike In Head, Home Before Dark and Port Of Amsterdam - was recorded as a three-piece, after which new bassist Joke Geraets became the first female member of The Nits, completing the line-up that would go on to enjoy commercial success with single and album &quot;In the Dutch Mountains&quot; (1987). Its title track became a European hit and one of the band&#x27;s biggest. It was accompanied by a video with just the image of man in a rowing boat. Follow-up J.O.S. Days was a successful single as well. The group&#x27;s extensive tours during this period led to the accomplished live triple-LP &quot;Urk&quot; (1989) which became their best-selling album. The live version of Adieu Sweet Bahnhof was released as a single, again accompanied by a video. It became a Top 30 hit for the band in Holland. &quot;Urk&quot; also featured live versions of songs from &quot;Hat&quot;, the band&#x27;s 1988 6-song EP, including popular songs like The Dream, Bauhaus Chair and The Train.
==Giant Normal Dwarf, Ting &amp; Hjuvi==
When Geraets fell ill with a muscular disease, meaning that she was unable to play bass, the group (now using the shortened name &quot;Nits&quot;, often rendered in capitals to emphasise the absence of the definite article) continued as a trio. &quot;Giant Normal Dwarf&quot; (1990) was a kaleidoscopic affair which at first glance seemed like a return to the psychedelia of &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; and &quot;Glass Onion&quot; but was actually inspired by Hofstede&#x27;s desire to write musical fairy tales for his newborn child. The subsequent album &quot;Ting&quot; (1992) was a return to a much more minimalist approach, both with respect to the emphasis on the piano and the inspiration of Philip Glass on several songs. At the same time as working on &quot;Ting&quot;, the group were also preparing material for a TV special with the Netherlands Radio Symphony Orchestra. Mainly composed by Stips, this was later issued as the album &quot;Hjuvi - A Rhapsody In Time&quot;.

==dA dA dA, Nest &amp; Vest==
The 1994 album &quot;dA dA dA&quot; was something of a return to basics, with &quot;traditional&quot; songwriting largely replacing the quirkiness of recent Nits releases, and the group&#x27;s early influences once again to the fore. The album was the first Nits material to gain a release in the United States. Ironically for a group that had always performed in English, regarding it as a necessary evil for international success, recognition in the major English-speaking markets always eluded them. &quot;dA dA dA&quot;, despite critical acclaim in both the UK and USA, still failed to break the group in either market.

In 1995, the group released &quot;Nest&quot;, a 20-track retrospective album, and the accompanying tour ended on a high note with a concert broadcast live on television from the Uitmarkt festival. Stips then left to pursue a solo career.

A one-hour VHS video compilation &quot;Vest, 16 video clips, 1984–1995&quot; was also released, featuring short films to accompany the songs, filmed on a low budget by the band themselves, with a 16mm cine camera.

==Alankomaat, Wool &amp; 1974==
The group continued, releasing the introspective albums &quot;Alankomaat&quot; (1998) - which featured the singles Sister Rosa and Robinson, and fan favourite Three Sisters - and &quot;Wool&quot; (2000), followed by another retrospective, &quot;Hits&quot;.

The group continues to perform to this day following the return of keyboard player Robert Jan Stips in 2003 for the release of the album &quot;1974&quot;, commemorating the year of their formation.

==Les Nuits, Doing the Dishes &amp; Strawberry Wood==
A new album titled &quot;Les Nuits&quot; was released in October 2005. Three of the songs on the album - The Laundrette, The Key Shop and The Pizzeria - were about the murder of film director Theo Van Gogh, which happened in the street where Henk Hofstede lived. The title track of the album would pop up on the band&#x27;s setlists for many years to come. After an extensive tour and some solo activity, the band returned to the studio in mid-2007 to record the album &quot;Doing the Dishes&quot;, released in January 2008. The album went top 10 in the Netherlands (for the first time since &quot;URK&quot; in 1989), had an airplay hit in The Flowers and was once again followed by a tour. Many of the album&#x27;s songs were performed live. In 2009, the next album and tour, &quot;Strawberry Wood&quot;, a top 15 hit on the Dutch album chart, followed. It was preceded by the single Hawelka.

==Malpensa, NITS? &amp; Hotel Europa==
In early 2012, the Nits released the album &quot;Malpensa&quot;, to positive reviews and fan reactions. It contains a collaboration with Colin Benders of Kyteman on the track &quot;Bad Government&quot;. The songs &quot;Love-Locks&quot; and &quot;Man on a Wire&quot; were released as singles, as well as &quot;Bad Government&quot;, which was re-done with Perquisite and Dazzled Kid for the single remix. The song &quot;Schwebebahn&quot; finds the band singing in German for the first time. In 2013, the Nits composed and produced the music of the documentary &quot;The King of Mount Ventoux&quot; by director Fons Feyaerts. The 7-track soundtrack was released on iTunes and Spotify. 2014 and 2015 focused on the &#x27;40 years of NITS&#x27; anniversary. A 3CD compilation album spanning the band&#x27;s whole career was released in 2014, which contained three unreleased tracks. In March 2015, the band released &quot;Hotel Europa&quot;, a double live album with songs ranging from &quot;Giant Normal Dwarf&quot; (1990) to &quot;Malpensa&quot; (2012), with exception of a live version of &quot;In the Dutch Mountains&quot;. The album received rave reviews and entered the Dutch album charts at #5, making it their highest charting album since &quot;Urk&quot; (#3, 1989) and their first Top 10 album since &quot;Doing the Dishes&quot; (#8, 2008).

In November 2015, all Nits albums were released on digital platforms such as Spotify, Deezer and Apple Music.

==TING! with Scapino Ballet, trilogy angst, Knot &amp; NEON ==
In 2016 the band played 20 shows with Scapino Ballet Rotterdam. The show, entitled &quot;TING!&quot;, featured 20 NITS songs including &quot;Nescio&quot;, &quot;Five Fingers&quot;, &quot;The Long Song&quot;, &quot;The Swimmers&quot; and &quot;In the Dutch Mountains&quot;. More than 20,000 people saw the show in Rotterdam.

In August 2017 new album and tour &quot;angst&quot; were announced for September. Preceded by the songs &quot;Flowershop Forget-Me-Not&quot;, &quot;Yellow Socks &amp; Angst&quot; and &quot;Pockets Of Rain&quot;. On Friday September 15 &quot;Yellow Socks &amp; Angst&quot; was added to Spotify&#x27;s popular New Music Friday playlist. &quot;angst&quot; was released by the band&#x27;s own WERF Records and largely sold through the band&#x27;s own website. Despite this, on the back of very good reviews in OOR, Algemeen Dagblad and Lust For Life a.o., and promo shows on Dutch Radio, it entered the Dutch Album Top 100 at #40. The European 2017-2018 tour started in September 2017. Early November 2017 a 12-second promo for the tour was broadcast on Dutch TV, featuring &quot;Port Of Amsterdam&quot;, from the albums &quot;Henk&quot; (1986) and &quot;URK&quot; (1989, live). Late November the band played &quot;Radio Orange&quot; on Holland&#x27;s biggest TV show De Wereld Draait Door, after which &quot;angst&quot; returned to the iTunes Top 15. Early December NITS played the same song on Belgian TV show &quot;De Zevende Dag&quot;. In January 2018 Spotify released the playlist &quot;This is: NITS&quot; featuring 40 songs from &quot;Tent&quot; (1979) all the way up to &quot;angst&quot; (2017). From &quot;Tutti Ragazzi&quot; to &quot;In The Dutch Mountains&quot; and from &quot;Giant Normal Dwarf&quot; to &quot;Pockets Of Rain&quot;.

On November 22, 2019 &quot;Knot&quot; was released to favourable reviews in OOR, Parool and Written in Music a.o.

On Monday May 16, De Werf - the studio, archive and base of operations of the band for more than 40 years - tragically went up in flames. A big loss for the band and the music world in general. The new Nits album was completed just before the fire. In December 2021, the video for single &quot;Beromünster&quot; was still filmed there.

On September 30, 2022, the album &quot;NEON&quot; was released, the third in a trilogy with &quot;angst&quot; (2017) and &quot;Knot&quot; (2019). The album was preceded by the singles and videos &quot;Sunday Painter, The Ghost Ranch&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;Beromünster&quot;. On the day of release Spotify included the song &quot;Shadow Letter&quot; in its popular New Music Friday playlist, like the other singles before.

== Dial Nits, Tree House Fire and 50th Anniversary ==
After the international NEON Tour, the band worked on the mini-album &quot;Tree House Fire&quot; in Studio 150 in Amsterdam in 2023. The first single &quot;The Tree&quot; was released on January 12, 2024, which also kicked off the 50th anniversary year, including an international tour and anniversary shows in Carré, Amsterdam.

On Sunday, January 14, the band posted The Tree video to their Facebook and Instagram pages with the words: The Tree…Oosterpark…Amsterdam…Autumn and Winter 2023 2024… 

The album was released on January 19, with the song &quot;The Bird&quot; being placed in Spotify&#x27;s New Music Friday playlist. OOR Magazine wrote: &quot;Month Of May&quot; and &quot;Big Brown Building Burning&quot; describe the fire quite directly. Then their imagination runs wild with events. In &quot;The Bird&quot; we experience the fire from the perspective of the bird in the tree next to the studio. The result can easily be added to the list of Nits classics. You can only wish one thing for anyone who is still making such beautiful music after fifty years: on to a hundred!

In the meantime, a podcast series about the band&#x27;s 50-year career was also released. &quot;Dial Nits&quot; features core members Henk Hofstede, Rob Kloet and Robert Jan Stips in conversation, but also collaborators, friends and family from many different countries talking about the music and about the background stories to this unusual career of musicians from the Netherlands. The podcast can be heard on Spotify.

==Current and past members==

==Timeline==
==Lyrical themes==

The group travel widely, and Hofstede&#x27;s lyrics often concern his impressions of places he has been. The official Nits website includes a map showing the locations that the group has written songs about. Another common theme (to some extent overlapping the first) is songs inspired by works of art, literature and museum exhibits (e.g. &quot;A Touch of Henry Moore&quot;, &quot;Soap Bubble Box&quot;, &quot;Nescio&quot;). Many other songs are impressionistic, and many are concerned with the passing of time. Some albums include clusters of songs on a particular subject, for example &quot;In the Dutch Mountains&quot; contains several songs about Hofstede&#x27;s childhood memories, &quot;Giant Normal Dwarf&quot; includes several fantasy songs set in a folkloric version of the Netherlands called Fountainland, and the later albums, particularly &quot;Les Nuits&quot;, include numerous songs on the subject of human mortality.

In a 2017 interview, Hofstede indicated that their first recording would eventually be re-issued, however, &quot;the problem is it&#x27;s in somebody else&#x27;s hands so there are difficulties. Until now we didn&#x27;t feel it was that important but of course one day it will be there again. It&#x27;s old stuff but it is part of our history.&quot;

<text>122 Gerda is a fairly large outer main-belt asteroid that was discovered by German-American astronomer C. H. F. Peters on July 31, 1872, and named after Gerðr, the wife of the god Freyr in Norse mythology. Based upon its spectrum, this is classified as an S-type asteroid. It is listed as a member of the Hecuba group of asteroids that orbit near the 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter.

Photometric observations of this asteroid in 2007 were used to produce a light curve that showed that Gerda rotates every 10.687 ± 0.001 hours and varied in brightness by 0.16 in magnitude. In 2009, observations at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico generated a light curve with a period of 10.712 ± 0.01 hours with a brightness variation of 0.11 ± 0.01 magnitudes. This is compatible with previous studies.

<doc id="741063" wikidata="Q4384558" url="?curid=741063" title="USS Dogfish">
<text>USS &quot;Dogfish&quot; (SS-350), a , was the only vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the dogfish.

Her keel was laid down on 22 June 1944 by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 27 October 1945 sponsored by Mrs. A. M. Morgan, and commissioned on 29 April 1946.

&quot;Dogfish&quot; sailed out of New London, Connecticut, on local duties and cruised to the Caribbean Sea and Bermuda to conduct training. She was overhauled and extensively modernized at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard from August 1947 to April 1948, and then served in experimental projects as well as normal operations at New London. From 31 October to 19 November 1948 she took part in large-scale fleet exercises ranging from the waters off Florida to Davis Strait between Labrador and Greenland.

She cruised to Scotland, England, and France between 4 February and 3 April 1949 and joined in a convoy exercise off Cape Hatteras in February and March 1952, and operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean Sea during the next three years.

&quot;Dogfish&quot; sailed from New London on 1 March 1955 for her first tour with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, Dogfish entered the Mediterranean through the strait of Gibraltar. While in the Mediterranean, Dogfish made port calls in Gibraltar, Italy, France, and Spain before returning to her home port 6 June. The submarine called at Halifax, Nova Scotia, from 4 June to 14 June 1956 during NATO Operation New Broom. On 8 November, she stood by and fought the fires on the trawler &quot;Agda&quot; during local operations out of New London. She cruised to Faslane Bay in Scotland between 31 January and 12 April 1958 to evaluate new equipment, and from 23 May to 8 August 1959 served in the Mediterranean Sea. In October and November, she took part in NATO antisubmarine warfare exercises. After extensive overhaul, the vessel resumed local operations from New London through 1960.

==Transfer to Brazil==
&quot;Dogfish&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and sold to Brazil on 28 July 1972. She served the Brazilian Navy as &quot;Guanabara&quot; (S-10) until being deleted in 1983.

<text>The New British Poetry 1968-88 was a poetry anthology from 1988, jointly edited by Gillian Allnutt, Fred D&#x27;Aguiar, Ken Edwards and Eric Mottram, respectively concerned with feminist, Black British, younger experimental and British poetry revival poets. The book&#x27;s general editor was John Muckle, founder of the Paladin Poetry Series. He attempted to challenge what many saw as a narrowly defined &#x27;mainstream&#x27; by creating a book around different strands in radical poetry and four editors who might not otherwise have worked together: &quot;Their differences, both in the shape they have given their selections and in their introductory remarks, make this a many-sided, exciting, unpredictable - and no doubt contentious book.&quot; The anthology&#x27;s multicultural and counter-cultural stance gave it a strong anti-Thatcherite flavour. The book was widely if critically reviewed and went on to influence a number of subsequent anthologies of British poetry.

<text>Kwai Fong () is an elevated railway station on of Hong Kong&#x27;s MTR system. Opened on 10 May 1982, it is located between Lai King and Kwai Hing stations.

Named after Kwai Fong Estate, a large public housing estate to its northeast, Kwai Fong, the neighbourhood around the station, has become a transit interchange, business centre, as well as the landmark area of Kwai Chung. Since opening, all sorts of road transportation from various places in the Kwai Tsing District have converged here. A shopping centre (Metroplaza) was also built west of the station in the early 1990s. The station also serves those who work in the factories to its east.

The tracks north of the station are surrounded by concrete noise barriers to minimise noise pollution for residents living near the railway.

==History==
Kwai Fong station was built as part of the Tsuen Wan Extension project, the first extension of the MTR system following its 1979 opening. The new line served to link the Tsuen Wan New Town to Kowloon. It opened on 10 May 1982. The contract for the construction of this station, Kwai Hing station, and the viaducts was awarded and built by Dragages et Travaux Publics.

Automatic platform gates were installed at this station in August 2011.

==Station layout==
 The tracks of platform 1 and 2 are located next to each other in the middle of the station. Passengers have to ride different escalators up as according to the platform they want to go to.

Kwai Fong station is one of the three elevated stations of the Tsuen Wan line. (The others are Lai King and Kwai Hing stations.)

The structure of Kwai Fong station is very similar to Kwai Hing station.

Passengers can go to Exit E from Platform 1 without going down any escalators, but for Platform 2, passengers should take an escalator down to the concourse, and take an escalator back to Platform 1, and go to Exit E. From Exit E to the platform, it is the same as the above.

==Entrances/Exits==
*A: New Kwai Fong Gardens D-E, Kwai Fong Estate
*B: New Kwai Fong Gardens A-C
*C: Kwai Tsing Theatre 
*D: Kwai Chung Plaza, Metroplaza (ground level) 
*E: Metroplaza (via footbridge linking Platform 1)

Exits A through D are located at the ground floor of the station, while Exit E is located on Platform 1 (towards Tsuen Wan).

<doc id="741071" wikidata="Q82101" url="?curid=741071" title="Blockhouse">
<text>A blockhouse is a small fortification, usually consisting of one or more rooms with loopholes, allowing its defenders to fire in various directions. It is usually an isolated fort in the form of a single building, serving as a defensive strong point against any enemy that does not possess siege equipment or, in modern times, artillery, air force or cruise missiles. A fortification intended to resist these weapons is more likely to qualify as a fortress or a redoubt, or in modern times, be an underground bunker. However, a blockhouse may also refer to a room within a larger fortification, usually a battery or redoubt.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;&quot; is of uncertain origin, perhaps related to Middle Dutch &quot;blokhus&quot; and 18th-century French &quot;blocus&quot; (blockade).

== In ancient Greece ==
Blockhouses existed in ancient Greece, for example the one near Mycenae.

== Early blockhouses in England ==
Early blockhouses were designed solely to protect a particular area by the use of artillery, and they had accommodation only for the short-term use of the garrison. The first known example is the Cow Tower, Norwich, built in 1398, which was of brick and had three storeys with the upper storeys pierced for six guns each. The major period of construction was in the maritime defence programmes of Henry VIII between 1539 and 1545. They were built to protect important maritime approaches such as the Thames Estuary, the Solent, and Plymouth. Often sited in pairs, the blockhouses were not built to a common design, but usually consisted of a stone tower and bastion or gun platform, which could be semi-circular, rectangular or irregular in shape. The last blockhouse of this type was Cromwell&#x27;s Castle, built in Scilly in 1651.

== Coastal fortifications in Malta ==
Blockhouses were an ubiquitous feature in Malta&#x27;s coastal fortifications built in the 18th century by the Order of St. John. Between 1714 and 1716, dozens of batteries and redoubts were built around the coasts of the Maltese Islands, while a few others were built in the subsequent decades. Almost every battery and redoubt had a blockhouse, which served as gun crew accommodation and a place to store munitions.

Many of the batteries consisted of a semi-circular or polygonal gun platform, with one or two blockhouses at the rear. The blockhouses usually had musketry loopholes, and in some cases were linked together by redans. Surviving batteries include Mistra Battery and Ferretti Battery, which both have two blockhouses, and Saint Mary&#x27;s Battery and Saint Anthony&#x27;s Battery, which have a single blockhouse.

Many of the redoubts consisted of a pentagonal platform with a rectangular blockhouse at the rear, although a few had semi-circular or rectangular platforms. Surviving redoubts with blockhouses include Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq Redoubt and Briconet Redoubt, both of which have a pentagonal plan. A few of the redoubts consisted of a single tower-like blockhouse without a platform, and were known as &quot;tour-reduits&quot;. Of the four &quot;tour-reduits&quot; that were built, only the Vendôme Tower survives today.

== Age of exploration ==
Originally blockhouses were often constructed as part of a large plan, to &quot;block&quot; access to vital points in the scheme. But from the Age of Exploration to the nineteenth century standard patterns of blockhouses were constructed for defence in frontier areas, particularly South Africa, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States.

Blockhouses may be made of masonry where available, but were commonly made from very heavy timbers, sometimes even logs arranged in the manner of a log cabin. They were usually two or even three floors, with all storeys being provided with embrasures or loopholes, and the uppermost storey would be roofed. If the structure was of timber, usually the upper storey would project outward from the lower so the upper storey defenders could fire on enemies attacking the lower storey, or perhaps pour water on any fires. When the structure had only one storey, its loopholes were often placed close to the ceiling, with a bench lining the walls inside for defenders to stand on, so that attackers could not easily reach the loopholes.

Blockhouses were normally entered via a sturdy, barred door at ground level. Most blockhouses were roughly square in plan, but some of the more elaborate ones were hexagonal or octagonal, to provide better all-around fire. In some cases, blockhouses became the basis for complete forts, by building a palisade with the blockhouse at one corner, and possibly a second tower at the opposite corner. Many historical stone blockhouses have survived, and a few timber ones have been restored at historical sites. In New Zealand, the Cameron Blockhouse, near Whanganui, is one of the few blockhouses to survive from the New Zealand Wars.

== Second Boer War ==

During the Second Boer War the British forces built a large number of fortifications in South Africa. Around 441 were solid masonry blockhouses, many of which stand today. Different designs were used in the construction of these blockhouses, but most were either two or three story structures built using locally quarried stone.

However the vast scale of British strategy led the British to develop cheaper, double-skinned corrugated iron structures. These could be prefabricated, delivered to site by armoured train, and then have locally sourced rocks or rubble packed inside the double skin to provide improved protection.

A circular design developed by Major Rice in February 1901 had good all round visibility, and the lack of corners did away with the need for a substructure. Failure due to wood rot and splintering when hit by bullets or shrapnel were eliminated. The steel door to the blockhouse was sheltered by another piece of corrugated iron. The Major Rice blockhouse could be erected in six hours by six trained men. With the change from square gabled roofs to a circular design, they were given the nickname &quot;Pepperpot blockhouse&quot;. With mass production the cost to build a blockhouse dropped down to £16, compared to several hundred pounds for masonry ones.

These blockhouses played a vital role in the protection of the railway lines and bridges that were key to the British military supply lines.

== Concrete blockhouses ==
During World War I and World War II, many types of blockhouses were built, when time allowed usually constructed of reinforced concrete. The major difference between a modern blockhouse and a bunker is that a bunker is constructed mostly below ground level while a blockhouse is constructed mostly above ground level.

Some blockhouses like those constructed in England in 1940 were built in anticipation of a German invasion; they were often hexagonal in shape and were called &quot;pillboxes&quot;. About 28,000 pillboxes and other hardened field fortifications were constructed, of which about 6,500 still survive.

The Admiralty Citadel in London is one of the sturdiest above-ground structures built during World War II. It was constructed in 1940–1941 as a bomb-proof operations centre for the Admiralty, with foundations nine metres deep and a concrete roof six metres thick. It too was intended to serve as a strongpoint in defending against the feared invasion.

In Berlin and other cities during World War II some massive blockhouses were built as air-raid shelters and anti-aircraft artillery platforms. They were called &quot;Hochbunker&quot; (literally, &quot;high bunkers&quot;; better translated as &quot;above ground bunkers&quot;, to distinguish them from the usual deep i.e. underground air raid shelters) and those that functioned as anti-aircraft artillery platforms were also called Flak towers. Some were over six stories high; several survive to this day because of the high cost of demolition. The in Berlin-Schöneberg has a post-war block of flats built over it. During the Cold War the shelter was in use as a NATO foodstore.

In the guerrilla phase of the Irish Civil War (1922–1923), a network of blockhouses was constructed to protect the railways from guerrilla attacks.

Blockhouses and coordinated road systems were used in the encirclement campaigns of Chiang Kai-shek against the Chinese Communist Party.
