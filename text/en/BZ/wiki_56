<text>La fanciulla del West (&quot;The Girl of the West&quot;) is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Guelfo Civinini and Carlo Zangarini, based on the 1905 play &quot;The Girl of the Golden West&quot; by the American author David Belasco. &quot;Fanciulla&quot; followed &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, which was also based on a Belasco play. The opera has fewer of the show-stopping highlights that characterize Puccini&#x27;s other works, but is admired for its impressive orchestration and for a score that is more melodically integrated than is typical of his previous work. &quot;Fanciulla&quot; displays influences from composers Claude Debussy and Richard Strauss, without being in any way imitative. Similarities between the libretto and the work of Richard Wagner have also been found though some attribute this more to the original plot of the play, and have asserted that the opera remains quintessentially Italian.

At the time of its debut performance, Puccini declared &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; to be the greatest composition of his career as a composer. The work had a highly publicized premiere at the Metropolitan Opera, New York City, in 1910 that was immensely popular with audiences, but, to the disappointment of Puccini, received a less than positive reaction from American critics who felt the composer failed to effectively integrate an American aesthetic into the opera&#x27;s score. The opera was widely performed internationally in the three years following the premiere for performances in cities throughout the United States, Europe, and South America. However, critical reaction to the work was largely negative internationally with the exception of critics in Italy at this time in history.

After 1913, stagings of &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; during the early and mid 20th century were more infrequent; although the opera has never left the performance repertoire. While overall public reception of the work has remained mixed, critical assessment of the opera underwent a reversal among Puccini scholars beginning in the late 20th century. Despite the plot being a source of significant criticism, the majority of published writers on Puccini and his music in the late 20th century and 21 century agree in calling &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; Puccini&#x27;s magnum opus, particularly lauding its craftsmanship.

This critical reassessment of &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; coincided with an increase of performances of the opera at opera houses internationally during the late 20th and 21st centuries. Today performances of the opera are not rare, but the work is still not as frequently programmed as Puccini&#x27;s other mature operas, such as &quot;La bohème&quot; and &quot;Tosca&quot;.

In 2006 the philanthropist Bruce Kovner donated a large collection of original manuscripts to the Juilliard School, including Puccini&#x27;s manuscript for &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot;.

==Early performance history and critical assessment==

&quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; was commissioned by, and first performed at, the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 10 December 1910 with Met stars Enrico Caruso and Emmy Destinn for whom Puccini created the leading roles of Dick Johnson and Minnie. Also in the cast was Pasquale Amato as Jack Rance. The Met&#x27;s music director Arturo Toscanini conducted. Toscanini, called the opera a &quot;great symphonic poem&quot;. This was the first world premiere of an opera at the Met, and it was extremely well received by audiences in this initial production. At the premiere performance, the composer received fourteen curtain calls after the first act, nineteen curtain calls after the second act, and twenty after the finale.

Puccini himself was incredibly thrilled with the work and both he and his publisher, Ricordi, assumed that the opera&#x27;s enthusiastic response from New York audiences would translate into another popular success on the international stage. In some respects this was initially the case, as the opera enjoyed a large number of stagings in the two years after its premiere with many performances in major American cities, over 20 productions in German opera houses, and performances in theaters in London, Liverpool, Buenos Aires, Naples, Milan, Rome, and Budapest. Critical reaction to the opera, however, never matched Puccini&#x27;s own favorable view of his opera, and the work struggled to a find a place in the regularly performed opera repertoire after this initial flurry of performances.

American critics were lukewarm in their reception of the opera; largely criticizing the work for failing to successfully incorporate American idioms into the opera&#x27;s musical score. In analyzing the disparity between audience response and critical reaction to the work by Americans, musicologist Kathryn Fenton asserts that American critics were trying to wrestle with their conceptions of American identity stating,Marked by ambivalence, the reviews expose the New York City critics&#x27; struggle to reconcile the opera they expected to see with the one they actually saw. Their view of the opera&#x27;s place in Puccini&#x27;s repertoire and in the early 20th-century opera canon differed—in some cases drastically—with the composer&#x27;s own assessment. One of the strongest objections made concerned its local color, its attempt to portray a Californian mining camp during the 1849 Gold Rush through characters, dialect, body language, clothing, buildings, landscape, customs, situation, and—most importantly—music considered stereotypical of the region. Critics found the manner in which Puccini attempted to musically depict the American locale problematic.
Immediately following the Met premiere, &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; was programed by several American opera companies. American soprano Carolina White, who had previously established herself as a leading soprano in opera houses in Italy and Switzerland, made her United States opera debut as Minnie in the Chicago premiere of the opera on December 27, 1910, at the Chicago Auditorium by the Chicago Grand Opera Company. White performed the role again for the opera&#x27;s first stagings in Milwaukee (1910) and Boston (1911), the latter with the Boston Opera Company. The theatrical impresario Henry Wilson Savage staged the first English language production of the opera for the work&#x27;s Connecticut premiere at the Poll&#x27;s Theater in Bridgeport on October 27, 1911, with Luisa Villani as Minnie.

While American critics were less than enthusiastic in their reviews of &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot;, English critics were even more harsh in their initial assessment of the opera. The work was poorly reviewed when the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, staged the European and United Kingdom première of the work on 29 May 1911 under the baton of Cleofonte Campanini with largely the same cast as the Met premiere with the exception of Amedeo Bassi in the role of Johnson. Italian critics, however, were more positive in their assessment of the opera when the work premiered in Italy at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on June 12, 1911. This performance was attended by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and Queen Elena of Montenegro who reportedly warmly received the opera. However, while praised by Italian critics and the Italian monarchy, the opera did not achieve popularity with the Italian public and failed to gain a place among the regularly programmed opera repertoire in that nation.

Puccini himself conducted &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; for its first performance in Lucca at the Teatro del Giglio in 1911; with the theatre&#x27;s orchestra pit being redesigned by Puccini and rebuilt just prior to the performance of the opera. The work was first staged at La Scala on December 12, 1912, with Tina Poli Randaccio as Minnie and Tullio Serafin conducting where it ran thirteen performances.

As in the United States, the German premiere of &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; enjoyed a positive response from audiences but a negative reaction from critics when it was staged at the Deutsches Opernhaus in Berlin (now known as the Deutsche Oper) on 28 March 1913, under the musical direction of Ignatz Waghalter. Other premieres took place at the Teatro Colón, Buenos Aires on 25 July 1911; and in Melbourne on 11 June 1912 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. the world première in French took place in the Opéra de Monte-Carlo on 12 April 1912 in an adaptation by . The Zimin Opera presented the work&#x27;s Russian premiere on October 2, 1913, at the Solodovnikov Theatre in Moscow.

In spite of criticism, Puccini insisted that &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; was his greatest composition up to that point in his career. Yet the opera struggled to find a place in the standard opera repertory in the 20th century, even in the United States, enjoying only periodic performances. Critical reaction and public reception of the work has been divided, and the opera has never achieved the popularity enjoyed by many of Puccini&#x27;s other operas. Only late in the 20th century was the opera re-assessed as a work of quality, and Puccini scholars have acknowledged that the opera was an important departure in Puccini&#x27;s body of work from a predominant quality of feminine softness in his other works towards a decidedly masculine aesthetic. Likewise, the complexity of the opera&#x27;s harmonic language and its use of a wide range of instrumental colour has led some writers on music to label it as Puccini&#x27;s greatest opera.

&quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; has fewer of the show-stopping highlights that characterize Puccini&#x27;s other works, but is admired for its impressive orchestration and for a score that is more melodically integrated than is typical of his previous work. The work displays influences from composers Claude Debussy and Richard Strauss, without being in any way imitative. Similarities between the libretto and the work of Richard Wagner have also been found, though some attribute this more to the original plot of the play, and have asserted that the opera remains quintessentially Italian.

Yet, some critics of the opera, particularly in America, have deemed the opera as conceived &quot;silly&quot;; largely in relation to its American storyline being told through the vehicle of an Italian opera. For example, music critic Robert Levine stated the following in his review of a 2004 production at the Glimmerglass Opera: “The entire concept of an Italian opera taking place during the California Gold Rush of the 1850s is a mite silly.” Smith College musicology professor Ruth A. Solie has written about the hypocrisy of such criticisms, noting that Americans often have no trouble accepting Italian operas set in foreign locales like Egypt (&quot;Aida&quot;) and China (&quot;Turandot&quot;). In analyzing this general reaction among American reviews, Annie J. Randall observed in her book &quot;Puccini and the Girl: History and Reception of “The Girl of the Golden West&quot; (2005, University of Chicago Press) that European operas often feature the &quot;exotic&quot; and suggests that American critics have professed “annoyance that Americans had been made the object of the voyeuristic imperial gaze on the opera stage.”

Despite the plot being a source of significant criticism, the majority of academics and musicians today agree in calling it a magnum opus, particularly lauding its musical craftsmanship.

==Later performance history==
While &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; has failed to gain the popularity of some of Puccini&#x27;s other works, such as &quot;La bohème&quot; and &quot;Tosca&quot;, the work has never completely left the opera reportory. For periodic stretches of time in the 20th century performances of the opera occurred with less frequency, but the opera has had a resurge of interest on the opera stage internationally in the late 20th and early 21st century. Today the opera is not performed nearly as often as Puccini&#x27;s other mature operas, but stagings of the opera are not a rare occurrence.

In 1921 the opera was staged at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo where Puccini was particularly impressed by soprano Gilda dalla Rizza, remarking, &quot;At last I have seen my true Fanciulla.&quot; In 1922 the Chicago Civic Opera staged the opera with Rosa Raisa as Minnie; a production which the company toured to New York&#x27;s Manhattan Opera House. In 1927 the Vienna State Opera staged the work with a critically lauded performance by Maria Jeritza in the role of Minnie; with the soprano receiving fourteen curtain calls in her final performance of the production. In 1934 the opera was given its Swedish premiere in Stockholm at the Royal Swedish Opera with Jussi Björling as Dick Johnson and Helga Görlin as Minnie.

The Metropolitan Opera has revived &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; several times during the company&#x27;s history after the initial production of the opera left its repertoire in 1914. The first time was in 1929 with Jeritza as Minnie and Giovanni Martinelli as Dick Johnson; a production which remained in the Met&#x27;s performance repertoire through 1931. In 1930 the opera was presented for the first time on the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts for a live national broadcast with New Zealand soprano Frances Alda singing the role of Minnie.

After a 30-year absence from the Met stage, &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; was revived again at the Met in 1961 with a production directed by Henry Butler with an initial cast of Leontyne Price as Minnie and Richard Tucker as Dick Johnson. Butler&#x27;s staging of the work remained in the Met&#x27;s performance repertoire for periodic performances over the next nine years; with its final performances being in 1970 with soprano Renata Tebaldi as Minnie. The work as staged by Butler was notably the very first opera performance presented at the newly built Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center on April 11, 1966, with soprano Beverly Bower in the role of Minnie. More recently the Met revived the opera in 1991 with Barbara Daniels as Minnie; using a staging by Giancarlo del Monaco which has remained in the Met&#x27;s rotating repertoire for periodic performance; most recently in 2018 with Eva-Maria Westbroek as Minnie. The Met also presented this staging of the work in the 2010–2011 season with Deborah Voigt as Minnie to mark the 100th anniversary of the opera&#x27;s premiere in 1910.

The San Francisco Opera (SFO) staged the work for the first time on September 15, 1930, with Jeritza as Minnie, Frederick Jagel as Dick Johnson, and Gaetano Viviani as Jack Rance. The company has since presented the opera in five more of its opera seasons, including productions in 1943 with Florence Kirk as Minnie and Robert Weede as Jack Rance; in 1960 with Dorothy Kirsten as Minnie and Sandor Konya as Dick Johnson; in 1965 with Chester Ludgin as Jack Rance and Marie Collier as Minnie using a production staged by Lotfi Mansouri; in 1979 with Carol Neblett as Minnie and Giovanni Gibin as Dick Johnson; and in 2010 with Deborah Voigt as Minnie.

In 1949 the Festival Puccini in Torre del Lago, Italy staged a new production of &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Puccini&#x27;s death; and the opera has remained a part of the festival&#x27;s rotating repertoire into the 21st century. In 1950 the Teatro dell&#x27;Opera di Roma mounted the opera in a production starring Maria Caniglia as Minnie and Vasco Campagnano as Johnson. In 1954 soprano Eleanor Steber portrayed Minnie at a production at La Fenice. La Scala staged the opera in 1956 with tenor Franco Corelli as Johnson; a role he repeated at the Teatro di San Carlo in 1957. The opera remained in La Scala&#x27;s repertoire for several seasons with the role of Minnie being performed at the theatre by sopranos Gigliola Frazzoni (1956–1957) and Birgit Nilsson (1958). In 1958 soprano Anny Schlemm performed the role of Minnie at the Oper Frankfurt, and soprano Gerda Scheyrer sang the part at the Vienna State Opera.

In 1963 the opera was staged by the Fujiwara Opera in Tokyo with Antonietta Stella as Minnie. The Theatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro) mounted the work in 1964 with Magda Olivero as Minnie; a role the soprano repeated at the Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi in 1965. The Philadelphia Lyric Opera staged the work at the Academy of Music in 1964 under the music direction of Anton Guadagno.

The New York City Opera (NYCO) first presented the opera in 1977 in a production directed by Frank Corsaro with Maralin Niska as Minnie and Ermanno Mauro as Dick Johnson with Sergiu Comissiona conducting. The NYCO unveiled a new production of the opera staged by James De Blasis in 1990 starring Linda Roark-Strummer as Minnie and Stefano Algieri as Dick Johnson. The NYCO staged the opera a third time in 2005 with Stephanie Friede as Minnie, Renzo Zulian as Dick Johnson, and George Manahan conducting. Most recently the NYCO presented the opera in 2017 with Kristin Sampson as Minnie.

In 1979 the Teatro Colón performed &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; with Plácido Domingo as Dick Johnson. In 1982 the Deutsche Oper Berlin staged the opera with Ghena Dimitrova as Minnie. That same year the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden mounted a production of the opera starring Domingo and Carol Neblett which was filmed for television broadcast in the UK and the United States. In 1983 the Canadian Opera Company performed the work with Johanna Meier as Minnie. In 1985 the Spoleto Festival USA performed the opera with Belgian soprano Anne-Marie Antoine as Minnie. In 1991 the Santa Fe Opera presented the work during its 35th season with Mary Jane Johnson as Minnie and Craig Sirianni as Dick Johnson. That same year La Scala revived the opera with Mara Zampieri, Plácido Domingo, and Juan Pons singing under the baton of Lorin Maazel; a performance which was recorded live for commercial release.

An incomplete list of more recent stagings include performances at the Teatro Real (1983), the Liceu (1984), Arena di Verona (1986), Vienna State Opera (1988 and 2013), Lyric Opera of Chicago (1990 and 2011), Welsh National Opera (1991), the Teatro Regio Torino (1991), Tulsa Opera (1991), the Los Angeles Opera (1991 and 2002), Oper Frankfurt (1992), Opéra de Marseille (1993), the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (1994 and 2005), La Scala (1995), the Zürich Opera House (1998 and 2014), the Teatro del Giglio (2000), the Austin Lyric Opera (2002), Seattle Opera (2004), Glimmerglass Opera (2004), the Opera Orchestra of New York (2004), the Deutsche Oper Berlin (2006, 2015, and 2021), the New National Theatre Tokyo (2006), the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (2007), the Malmö Opera (2007), the Opéra de Montréal (2008), the Teatro dell&#x27;Opera di Roma (2008–2009), the Dutch National Opera (2009), the Adelaide Festival Theatre (2009), the Edinburgh International Festival (2010), Opera Australia (2010), the Mobile Opera (2013), the Castleton Festival (2013), the Minnesota Opera (2014) the Paris Opera (2014), Opera Holland Park (2014), the English National Opera (2014), Opera North (2014), the Virginia Opera (2017), the Michigan Opera Theatre (2017), the Hungarian State Opera (2018), the Bavarian State Opera (2019), the National Centre for the Performing Arts (China) (2019, Chinese premiere), the Mariinsky Theatre (2019 and 2022), the Berlin State Opera (2021), the Seoul Arts Center (2021, South Korea première), the Romanian National Opera, Cluj-Napoca (2022), the Teatro Sociale, Como (2022), the Teatro Fraschini (2022), and the Estonian National Opera (2022–2023).

==Roles==


==Synopsis==
:Time:1849 to 1850.
:Place: A mining camp at the foot of the Cloudy Mountains, California.

===Act 1===
&quot;Inside the Polka Saloon&quot;

A group of Gold Rush miners enter the &quot;Polka&quot; saloon after a day working at the mine (&quot;Hello! Hello! Alla &#x27;Polka&#x27;&quot;). After a song by traveling minstrel Jake Wallace (&quot;Che faranno i vecchi miei&quot;), one of the miners, Jim Larkens, is homesick and the miners collect enough money for his fare home (&quot;Jim, perché piangi?&quot;).

A group of miners playing cards discover that Sid is cheating and want to attack him. Sheriff Jack Rance quiets the fight and pins two cards to Sid&#x27;s jacket, as a sign of a cheat.

A Wells Fargo agent, Ashby, enters and announces that he is chasing the bandit Ramerrez and his gang of Mexicans. Rance toasts Minnie, the woman who owns the saloon, as his future wife, which makes Sonora jealous. The two men begin to fight. Rance draws his revolver but at that moment, a shot rings out and Minnie stands next to the bar with a rifle in her hands (&quot;Hello, Minnie!&quot;). She gives the miners a reading lesson from the Bible (&quot;Dove eravamo?&quot;).

The Pony Express rider arrives (&quot;La posta!&quot;) and delivers a telegram from Nina Micheltorena, offering to reveal Ramerrez&#x27;s hideout. The sheriff tells Minnie that he loves her, but Minnie puts him off as she is waiting for the right man (&quot;Ti voglio bene, Minnie&quot;).

A stranger enters the saloon and asks for a whisky and water. He introduces himself as Dick Johnson from Sacramento, whom Minnie had met earlier. Johnson invites Minnie to dance with him and she accepts. Angrily, Rance watches them.

Ashby returns with the captured Ramerrez gang member, Castro. Upon seeing his leader, Johnson, in the saloon, Castro agrees to lead Rance, Ashby and the miners in a search for Ramerrez, and the group then follows him on a false trail and in what turns out to be a wild goose chase. But before Castro leaves, he whispers to Johnson that somebody will whistle and Johnson must reply to confirm that the place is clear. A whistle is heard, but Johnson fails to reply.

Minnie shows Johnson the keg of gold that she and the miners take turns to guard at night and Johnson reassures her that the gold will be safe there. Before he leaves the saloon, he promises to visit her at her cabin. They confess their love for each other. Minnie begins to cry, and Johnson comforts her before he leaves.

===Act 2===
&quot;Minnie&#x27;s dwelling, later that evening&quot;

Wowkle, a Native American woman who is Minnie&#x27;s servant, her lover Billy Jackrabbit and their baby are present as Minnie enters, wanting to get ready for Johnson&#x27;s visit. Johnson enters Minnie&#x27;s cabin and she tells him all about her life. It begins to snow. They kiss and Minnie asks him to stay till morning. He denies knowing Nina Micheltorena. As Johnson hides, a posse enters looking for Ramerrez and reveal to Minnie that Johnson is the bandit Ramerrez himself. Angry, she orders Johnson to leave. After he leaves, Minnie hears a gunshot and she knows Johnson has been shot. Johnson staggers in and collapses, Minnie helps him by hiding him up in the loft. Rance enters Minnie&#x27;s cabin looking for the bandit and is about to give up searching for Johnson when drops of blood fall on his hand. Rance forces Johnson to climb down. Minnie desperately makes Rance an offer: if she beats him at poker, he must let Johnson go free; if Rance wins, she will marry him. Hiding some cards in her stockings, Minnie cheats and wins. Rance honors the deal and Minnie throws herself on the unconscious Johnson on the floor.

===Act 3===
&quot;In the Great Californian Forest at dawn, sometime later&quot;

Johnson is again on the run from Ashby and the miners. Nick and Rance are discussing Johnson and wonder what Minnie sees in him when Ashby arrives in triumph: Johnson has been captured. Rance and the miners all want Johnson to be hanged. Johnson accepts the sentence and only asks the miners not to tell Minnie about his capture and his fate (&quot;Ch&#x27;ella mi creda&quot;). Minnie arrives, armed with a pistol, just before the execution and throws herself in front of Johnson to protect him. While Rance tries to proceed, she convinces the miners that they owe her too much to kill the man she loves, and asks them to forgive him (&quot;Ah! Ah! È Minnie! ... Non vi fu mai chi disse &#x27;Basta!). One by one, the miners yield to her plea (&quot;E anche tu lo vorrai, Joe&quot;). Rance is not happy but finally he too gives in. Sonora unties Johnson and sets him free. The miners bid Minnie farewell (&quot;Le tue parole sono di Dio&quot;). Minnie and Johnson leave California to start a new life together.

==Instrumentation==
&quot;La fanciulla del West&quot; is scored for piccolo; three flutes; three oboes; one English horn; three clarinets in B-flat; one bass clarinet in B-flat; three bassoons; one contrabassoon; four French horns in F; three trumpets in F; three tenor trombones; one bass trombone; a percussion section with timpani, cymbals, one triangle, one snare drum, one bass drum, and one glockenspiel; three onstage fonicas; one celesta; two harps; and strings.

==Recordings==

==Other influences==
The melody for Jake Wallace&#x27;s song near the beginning of the first act is derived from two songs in a collection of Zuni melodies &quot;recorded and harmonized&quot; by ethnomusicologist Carlos Troyer, published in 1909. Puccini had obtained this publication in an effort to find authentic Native American music for the role of Wowkle, but he ended up using it for Jake Wallace instead. (Several books about Puccini repeat Mosco Carner&#x27;s claim that the song is based on Stephen Foster&#x27;s &quot;Old Dog Tray&quot;; it is not.)

A climactic phrase sung by Johnson, &quot;E provai una gioia strana&quot; (alternatively &quot;Ho provato una gioia strana&quot; in some versions of the libretto) from &quot;Quello che tacete&quot; near the end of the first act, is widely cited to resemble a similar phrase in the Phantom&#x27;s song &quot;The Music of the Night&quot; in Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s 1986 musical &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. The Puccini estate sued Lloyd Webber over copyright infringement and the matter was settled out of court.

The opera was first portrayed in film in 1915 by famed director Cecil B. DeMille, and subsequently by directors Edwin Carewe in 1923, and John Francis Dillon, whose 1930 film was lost. A 1938 film directed by Robert Z. Leonard was based not on the opera but on the original play by Belasco; Sigmund Romberg wrote songs for this film.

<text>Demron is a radiation-shielding fabric. For the same weight it has slightly lower radiation protection than lead shielding, but is flexible. The composition of Demron is proprietary information, but it has been described as a non-toxic polyethylene and non-PVC-based polymer fused between two layers of a woven fabric. The polymer molecule imitates the electronic traits of heavy metals, commonly employed for shielding against radiation. It has a significant electron cloud that either deflects or absorbs incoming radiation. It is roughly three to four times more expensive than a conventional lead apron, but can be treated like a normal fabric for cleaning, storage and disposal. More recent uses for Demron include certified first responder hazmat suits as well as tactical vests.

<text>Greencore Group plc is a food company in Ireland. It was established by the Irish government in 1991, when Irish Sugar was privatised, but today Greencore&#x27;s products are mainly convenience foods, not only in Ireland but also in the United Kingdom. A major supplier to British and Irish supermarkets, Greencore is the largest sandwich manufacturer in the world. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.

==History==
The company was established in 1926 in Carlow as a private enterprise known as the &quot;Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company, Limited&quot;. The Sugar Manufacture Act, 1933 was passed to promote self-sufficiency in sugar manufacture; this Act was brought on by a crisis in the industry and resulted in the nationalisation of sugar manufacture. Factories were built in Mallow, Thurles and Tuam, and the company became &quot;Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teoranta&quot;, the Irish for &quot;Irish Sugar Company, Limited&quot;. When run by Michael Joe Costello, Irish Sugar introduced the first electronic computer into Ireland in 1957, buying it from Dora Metcalf. The Thurles and Tuam factories were closed in the early 1980s after a rationalisation became necessary, and the company decided to concentrate manufacture at its Carlow and Mallow factories.

In February 1990, the then managing director, Chris Comerford, was found to have received £9 million when the company acquired the 49% shareholding in a subsidiary that it did not already own. Comerford resigned but four years of litigation between the company and Comerford followed.

The Sugar Act, 1991 privatised the entity and it became Greencore at that time. The Act was passed as the company had diversified beyond being a sugar-manufacturing company into other food products. That year 55% of the group was listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, and over the years since additional placements have led to almost 100% of the shares being in private hands. However, the Irish Government retains a special share, with a face value of EUR 1.26, in order to prevent the Irish sugar quota being sold without its consent.

In 2005 the company announced that it would close its factory in Carlow, ceasing production on 11 March. In March 2006 it was announced that the last remaining factory would close in Mallow, and this closure occurred on 12 May. The reason indicated for these closures has been the reform of European Union policies on sugar which reduced the quotas and subsidies available and therefore making its manufacture unprofitable in Ireland. The company took a charge of €9m to its profit in 2008 when it was alleged that the former financial controller of the Mineral Water business had concealed costs.

In October 2009 Nordzucker announced that it had bought Greencore&#x27;s 50% stake in its joint venture SugarPartners. As part of the deal, Nordzucker acquired the Siucra, McKinney and Castle brands from the company. On 10 November 2010, the European Court of Auditors found that the closure of the last Greencore sugar plant in Mallow in 2006 may not have been necessary.

The company was due to merge with Northern Foods in 2011 to form Essenta Foods, to be headquartered in Dublin but listed on the London Stock Exchange. The deal, however, fell through after businessman Ranjit Singh Boparan outbid Greencore to win the approval of Northern Foods shareholders, on 21 January 2011. On 12 July 2011, Greencore announced it intended to buy Uniq plc. The deal closed in November 2011, with Uniq resultantly delisting from the London Stock Exchange. On 25 July 2016, the company acquired The Sandwich Factory Holdings Ltd for £15m from Cranswick plc. On 14 November 2016, Greencore announced it would acquire US-based Peacock Foods for $747.5m, significantly expanding its presence in the country.

The health of Greencore&#x27;s U.S. business was questioned by investors as a result of a late August 2017 fear that Starbucks had backtracked on a contract at the coffee giant&#x27;s Jacksonville facility in Florida. Brokerage house Cantor Fitzgerald became the first firm to lower its investment rating of Greencore, stating that the stock&#x27;s fall was caused by &quot;some underlying event in the US.&quot;

In October 2018 Greencore announced that it would sell its U.S. business to Hearthside Food Solutions for £817 million.

In June 2021 Patrick Murray, a manager at Greencore in Dundee, Scotland, was found to have racially abused an English employee and the company was fined £13,000.

In September 2022, Dalton Philips became CEO of Greencore.

In June 2024, Greencore voluntarily and proactively recalled 45 of its products following an outbreak of Shigatoxigenic E. coli in the United Kingdom in major supermarket chains. Although no testing of their products has yet indicated the presence of &quot;E. coli&quot; in them, Greencore wanted to take precautionary steps to minimize harm to consumers and spread information about the outbreak.

<text>Pierre Macherey (; born 17 February 1938) is a French Marxist philosopher and literary critic at the University of Lille Nord de France. A former student of Louis Althusser and collaborator on the influential volume &quot;Reading Capital&quot;, Macherey is a central figure in the development of French post-structuralism and Marxism. His work is influential in literary theory and Continental philosophy in Europe (including Britain) though it is generally little read in the United States.

== Scholarly work ==
Macherey is known for his contribution to &quot;Reading Capital&quot; and his influential work in Marxist literary criticism. Since October 2000, he has been engaged in a group project entitled &quot;La &quot;Philosophie au sens large&quot;&quot; (Philosophy in the grand sense), which has been hosted on the academic web platform Hypotheses.org since 2009. The project collects essays, presentations, and longer form studies that highlight the interrelation between philosophy and the literary, political, artistic, and social scientific thought that conditions it. The project is described as an attempt to reformulate the problematic of practice. In this context, Macherey has described philosophy in the &#x27;grand sense&#x27; as &quot; a conjunctural practice, which has no other means of surpassing the limits imposed by the conjunctures with which it is confronted other than to reflect on them and to elucidate their conditions in such a way as to eventually be able to intervene with regard to them and, therefore, to contribute to the transformation or evolution of these conjunctures.&quot;

<doc id="741870" wikidata="Q5137402" url="?curid=741870" title="Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus (Honolulu, Hawaii)">
<text>The Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus is a co-cathedral of the Roman Catholic Church and its Diocese of Honolulu, located in Kalihi-Palama in the outskirts of downtown Honolulu, Hawaii. The principal cathedral of the diocese remains the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace. It was named in honor of the Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus. 

The original church was established in 1931 by Msgr. Stephen Alencastre, Vicar Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. Construction was completed only a year later, in September 1932. Reflecting the growth of Catholicism in the immediate community, then pastor and diocesan vicar general Msgr. Benedict Vierra led a major fundraising effort to replace the church&#x27;s wooden structure, showing signs of deterioration in 1956. Vierra&#x27;s efforts were successful and the renovated church was dedicated on August 15, 1963.

Having found a need to have a larger space for pontifical liturgies - since the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace had become too small to accommodate the increased population since the vicariate apostolic was elevated to a diocese - Bishop Joseph Ferrario petitioned Pope John Paul II in 1984 to elevate Saint Theresa church to the dignity of a co-cathedral, as it is larger in physical size. A papal decree elevating Saint Theresa Catholic Church to co-cathedral was issued and the church was consecrated on July 28, 1985. Its interior was reconfigured and a second cathedra for the bishop was placed in the church.

The Co-Cathedral of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus is most often used for pontifical liturgies such as the annual Mass of the Chrism during which the holy oils (oil of the sick, oil of catechumens, and the holy Chrism) used in several of the sacraments are consecrated by the bishop before being distributed to the parishes of the diocese. Ordinations and episcopal installations are sometimes celebrated at the co-cathedral.

<text>SSE Airtricity (previously Eirtricity) is an energy company founded in Ireland in 1997, and now a subsidiary SSE plc. SSE Airtricity supplies and distributes electricity and gas to Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

== History ==
The company was founded as &quot;Eirtricity&quot; (derived from the word &quot;Éire&quot;, Irish for &quot;Ireland&quot;) in 1997 by Eddie O&#x27;Connor, developed generation capacity in Ireland based in counties Cavan, Donegal, Sligo and Wexford construction, though only 7 of a planned 200 turbines were actually built. The company changed its name to Airtricity in 2002. It rebranded as SSE Airtricity in February 2014.

In 2007 Airtricity was named &#x27;The No.1 Best Company to Work For in Ireland&#x27; by the Great Place To Work Institute.

The company sold its North American assets in October 2007 to the German Group E.ON for approximately $1.4bn.
The company was sold to SSE plc in January 2008 for approximately €1.1b.

On 15 January 2009, Airtricity obtained consent from the Dutch Ministry of Transport, Public Works, and Water Management for construction of the West Rhine (Dutch: West-Rijn) wind farm 40 kilometres off the Dutch North Sea coast. The wind farm will consist of up to 72 wind turbines with a total potential power capacity of around 260 MW.

Eddie O&#x27;Connor left Airtricity in 2008 and founded Mainstream Renewable Power.

In October 2009 SSE announced that the renewable energy division of Airtricity would be rebranded as SSE Renewables from 1 January 2010.

In May 2010 Airtricity announced that it would be entering the domestic gas market in the Republic of Ireland. Airtricity came under fire in 2010 for an alleged lack of compassion in disconnecting customers with a good bill-paying record.

== Description ==

SSE Airtricity is owned by Scottish and Southern Energy as of 15 February 2008 and now describes itself as &quot;the renewable arm of Scottish and Southern Energy Group&quot;.

As of May 2008, the company had 24 wind farms in operation throughout Ireland and the UK, with a total nameplate capacity of over 600 MW. A further 7 wind farms totalling over 100 MW are under construction. Construction of the Greater Gabbard offshore wind farm with a peak capacity of 500 MW using 140 x 3.6 MW Siemens turbines. These included:
*Ardrossan Wind Farm, Scotland – now sold to Infinis
*Arklow Bank Wind Park, Ireland
*Braes of Doune Wind Farm, Scotland
*Bindoo wind farm, Ireland
*Meentycat wind farm, Ireland
*West Kilbride wind farm, Scotland

SSE Airtricity supplies electricity in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland to industrial and residential customers. In the Republic of Ireland it competes with ESB Electric Ireland and Bord Gáis Energy, while in Northern Ireland it competes with Viridian, Phoenix Natural Gas, Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) and ESB Electric Ireland.

== Sponsorship ==

In 2010, SSE Airtricity signed a three-year deal to become the primary sponsor of the League of Ireland. In January 2021 a two-year renewal of the existing deal with the (men&#x27;s) League of Ireland was extended to also cover the Women&#x27;s National League.

SSE Airtricity currently sponsors the Dublin Marathon and the Great Wall Marathon in Northern Ireland.

SSE Airtricity is also a principal sponsor of the Eco Schools programme.

<text>Guadalupe Rivera Saavedra (born January 30, 1972) is a Mexican-American singer and songwriter. In 2010, Rivera was awarded a Grammy Award for his album, &quot;Tu Esclavo y Amo&quot;. His older sister was the late singer and actress Jenni Rivera. In 2019, he was one of the coaches for the first season of the Mexican singing competition show, La Voz on TV Azteca after being acquired from Televisa after 7 season.

==Early life==
Rivera was born in Long Beach, California to Rosa Saavedra and Pedro Rivera. Prior to Lupillo being born, Pedro Jr., Gustavo, his mother and his father moved to Long Beach, California, where Lupillo graduated from Long Beach Polytechnic High School in 1990.

==Career==
&quot;Lupillo Rivera&#x27;s&quot; journey into music was shaped by his early exposure to his father&#x27;s record company, Cintas Acuario. Initially interested in becoming a restaurateur, he was instead drawn to the music industry. He worked at his father&#x27;s studio, where his responsibilities included scouting and hiring local talent, providing him with invaluable real-world experience. Over time, Lupillo developed a deep passion for music.

Early in his career, he performed under the name &quot;El Torito,&quot; but as his popularity grew, he changed it to &quot;El Toro del Corrido&quot; in homage to his uncle, the famous professional boxer El Toro Rivera. By 1999, he had settled on the stage name &quot;Lupillo Rivera.&quot;

His career truly took off when he signed with Sony Discos. In 2001, his album &quot;Despreciado&quot; garnered him a &quot;Premio lo Nuestro&quot; and topped the Billboard Latin Albums chart. The following year, the album earned him two Billboard Latin Music Awards, and he made an appearance on the TV show &quot;Amorcito Corazón&quot;.

In 2004, Lupillo released &quot;Con Mis Propias Manos&quot;, which went on to become another chart-topping success. However, his 2009 album &quot;Tu Esclavo y Amo&quot; became his biggest hit, winning a Grammy Award for Best Banda Album in 2010. This album followed nominations for his previous works, &quot;Entre Copas y Botellas&quot; (2008) and &quot;El Tiro de Gracia&quot; (2009).

Since the release of his album &quot;24 Horas&quot; in 2010, Lupillo has not dropped any new studio albums.

<doc id="741875" wikidata="Q3402784" url="?curid=741875" title="Combinatorial proof">
<text>In mathematics, the term combinatorial proof is often used to mean either of two types of mathematical proof:
* A proof by double counting. A combinatorial identity is proven by counting the number of elements of some carefully chosen set in two different ways to obtain the different expressions in the identity. Since those expressions count the same objects, they must be equal to each other and thus the identity is established.
* A bijective proof. Two sets are shown to have the same number of members by exhibiting a bijection, i.e. a one-to-one correspondence, between them.

The term &quot;combinatorial proof&quot; may also be used more broadly to refer to any kind of elementary proof in combinatorics. However, as writes in his review of (a book about combinatorial proofs), these two simple techniques are enough to prove many theorems in combinatorics and number theory.

==Example==
An archetypal double counting proof is for the well known formula for the number formula_1 of &quot;k&quot;-combinations (i.e., subsets of size &quot;k&quot;) of an &quot;n&quot;-element set:
:formula_2
Here a direct bijective proof is not possible: because the right-hand side of the identity is a fraction, there is no set &quot;obviously&quot; counted by it (it even takes some thought to see that the denominator always evenly divides the numerator). However its numerator counts the Cartesian product of &quot;k&quot; finite sets of sizes &quot;n&quot;, , ..., , while its denominator counts the permutations of a &quot;k&quot;-element set (the set most obviously counted by the denominator would be another Cartesian product &quot;k&quot; finite sets; if desired one could map permutations to that set by an explicit bijection). Now take &quot;S&quot; to be the set of sequences of &quot;k&quot; elements selected from our &quot;n&quot;-element set without repetition. On one hand, there is an easy bijection of &quot;S&quot; with the Cartesian product corresponding to the numerator formula_3, and on the other hand there is a bijection from the set &quot;C&quot; of pairs of a &quot;k&quot;-combination and a permutation &quot;σ&quot; of &quot;k&quot; to &quot;S&quot;, by taking the elements of &quot;C&quot; in increasing order, and then permuting this sequence by &quot;σ&quot; to obtain an element of &quot;S&quot;. The two ways of counting give the equation
:formula_4
and after division by &quot;k&quot;! this leads to the stated formula for formula_1. In general, if the counting formula involves a division, a similar double counting argument (if it exists) gives the most straightforward combinatorial proof of the identity, but double counting arguments are not limited to situations where the formula is of this form.

Here is a simpler, more informal combinatorial proof of the same identity:
:formula_6
Suppose that n people would like to enter a museum, but the museum only has room for &quot;k&quot; people. First choose which &quot;k&quot; people from among the &quot;n&quot; people will be allowed in. There are formula_1 ways to do this by definition. Now order the &quot;k&quot; people into a single-file line so that they may pay one at a time. There are &quot;k&quot;! ways to permute this set of size &quot;k&quot;. Next, order the &quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot; people who must remain outside into a single-file line so that later they can enter one at a time, as the others leave. There are (&quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot;)! ways to do this. But now we have ordered the entire group of n people, something which can be done in &quot;n&quot;! ways. So both sides count the number of ways to order the &quot;n&quot; people. Division yields the well-known formula for formula_1.

== The benefit of a combinatorial proof == 

 gives an example of a combinatorial enumeration problem (counting the number of sequences of &quot;k&quot; subsets &quot;S&quot;1, &quot;S&quot;2, ... &quot;S&quot;&quot;k&quot;, that can be formed from a set of &quot;n&quot; items such that the intersection of all the subsets is empty) with two different proofs for its solution. The first proof, which is not combinatorial, uses mathematical induction and generating functions to find that the number of sequences of this type is (2&quot;k&quot; −1)&quot;n&quot;. The second proof is based on the observation that there are 2&quot;k&quot; −1 proper subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., &quot;k&quot;}, and (2&quot;k&quot; −1)&quot;n&quot; functions from the set {1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;} to the family of proper subsets of {1, 2, ..., &quot;k&quot;}. The sequences to be counted can be placed in one-to-one correspondence with these functions, where the function formed from a given sequence of subsets maps each element &quot;i&quot; to the set {&quot;j&quot; | &quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot;&quot;j&quot;}.

Stanley writes, “Not only is the above combinatorial proof much shorter than our previous proof, but also it makes the reason for the simple answer completely transparent. It is often the case, as occurred here, that the first proof to come to mind turns out to be laborious and inelegant, but that the final answer suggests a simple combinatorial proof.” Due both to their frequent greater elegance than non-combinatorial proofs and the greater insight they provide into the structures they describe, Stanley formulates a general principle that combinatorial proofs are to be preferred over other proofs, and lists as exercises many problems of finding combinatorial proofs for mathematical facts known to be true through other means.

==The difference between bijective and double counting proofs==
Stanley does not clearly distinguish between bijective and double counting proofs, and gives examples of both kinds, but the difference between the two types of combinatorial proof can be seen in an example provided by , of proofs for Cayley&#x27;s formula stating that there are &quot;n&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 2 different trees that can be formed from a given set of &quot;n&quot; nodes. Aigner and Ziegler list four proofs of this theorem, the first of which is bijective and the last of which is a double counting argument. They also mention but do not describe the details of a fifth bijective proof.

The most natural way to find a bijective proof of this formula would be to find a bijection between &quot;n&quot;-node trees and some collection of objects that has &quot;n&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 2 members, such as the sequences of &quot;n&quot; − 2 values each in the range from 1 to &quot;n&quot;. Such a bijection can be obtained using the Prüfer sequence of each tree. Any tree can be uniquely encoded into a Prüfer sequence, and any Prüfer sequence can be uniquely decoded into a tree; these two results together provide a bijective proof of Cayley&#x27;s formula.

An alternative bijective proof, given by Aigner and Ziegler and credited by them to André Joyal, involves a bijection between, on the one hand, &quot;n&quot;-node trees with two designated nodes (that may be the same as each other), and on the other hand, &quot;n&quot;-node directed pseudoforests. If there are &quot;Tn&quot; &quot;n&quot;-node trees, then there are &quot;n&quot;2&quot;Tn&quot; trees with two designated nodes. And a pseudoforest may be determined by specifying, for each of its nodes, the endpoint of the edge extending outwards from that node; there are &quot;n&quot; possible choices for the endpoint of a single edge (allowing self-loops) and therefore &quot;nn&quot; possible pseudoforests. By finding a bijection between trees with two labeled nodes and pseudoforests, Joyal&#x27;s proof shows that &quot;Tn&quot; = &quot;n&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 2.

Finally, the fourth proof of Cayley&#x27;s formula presented by Aigner and Ziegler is a double counting proof due to Jim Pitman. In this proof, Pitman considers the sequences of directed edges that may be added to an &quot;n&quot;-node empty graph to form from it a single rooted tree, and counts the number of such sequences in two different ways. By showing how to derive a sequence of this type by choosing a tree, a root for the tree, and an ordering for the edges in the tree, he shows that there are &quot;Tnn&quot;! possible sequences of this type. And by counting the number of ways in which a partial sequence can be extended by a single edge, he shows that there are &quot;n&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 2&quot;n&quot;! possible sequences. Equating these two different formulas for the size of the same set of edge sequences and cancelling the common factor of &quot;n&quot;! leads to Cayley&#x27;s formula.

<doc id="741881" wikidata="Q5760196" url="?curid=741881" title="Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada">
<text>Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada, 542 U.S. 177 (2004), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a statute requiring suspects to disclose their names during a valid Terry stop does not violate the Fourth Amendment if the statute first requires reasonable suspicion of criminal involvement, and does not violate the Fifth Amendment if there is no allegation that their names could have caused an incrimination.

Under the rubric of &quot;Terry v. Ohio&quot;, , the minimal intrusion on a suspect&#x27;s privacy, and the legitimate need of law enforcement officers to quickly dispel suspicion that an individual is engaged in criminal activity, justified requiring a suspect to disclose his or her name. The Court also held that the identification requirement did not violate Hiibel&#x27;s Fifth Amendment rights since he did not articulate a reasonable belief that his name would be used to incriminate him; however, the Court left open the possibility that Fifth Amendment privilege might apply in a situation where there &quot;was&quot; an articulated reasonable belief that giving a name could be incriminating.

The &quot;Hiibel&quot; decision was narrow in that it applied only to states that have stop and identify statutes. Consequently, individuals in states without such statutes cannot be lawfully arrested solely for refusing to identify themselves during a Terry stop.

== Background of the case ==
Nevada has a &quot;stop-and-identify&quot; law that allows police officers to detain any person they encounter &quot;under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the person has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime&quot;; the person may be detained only to &quot;ascertain his identity and the suspicious circumstances surrounding his presence abroad.&quot; In turn, the law requires the person detained to &quot;identify himself&quot;, but does not compel the person to answer any other questions put to him by the officer. The Nevada Supreme Court has interpreted that &quot;identify himself&quot; to mean to merely state his name. As of April 2008, 23 other states have similar laws.

On the evening of May 21, 2000, the sheriff&#x27;s department in Humboldt County, Nevada received a report that a man had assaulted a woman in a red and silver GMC truck on Grass Valley Road. The responding deputy found a truck parked on the side of the road. A man was smoking a cigarette beside the truck, and a young woman was sitting inside it. The deputy observed skid marks in the gravel behind the vehicle, leading him to believe the vehicle had come to a sudden stop.

The deputy explained to the man that there had been a report of a fight between the man and the young woman, and asked the man if he had any identification on him. The man protested that he had no reason to provide identification, and became ill-tempered when the deputy continued to press him for his identification. The man then asked the deputy what crime he was being accused of, as the deputy continued his requests for identification, stating that he was &quot;conducting an investigation&quot;. The man persisted in his refusal to provide identification, asking instead to be handcuffed and taken to jail. The deputy continued to ask for the man&#x27;s identification, stating that the man would face arrest if he did not cooperate and provide identification.
In response, the man declared he would not cooperate because he had not committed any crime. He then turned around and was arrested by the deputy.

That man was Larry Dudley Hiibel, the petitioner in this case, and the young woman was his daughter Mimi Hiibel. Larry Hiibel was charged with &quot;willfully resist[ing], delay[ing], or obstruct[ing] a public officer in discharging or attempting to discharge any legal duty of his office.&quot; In the Justice Court for Union Township, Nevada, Hiibel was convicted of this charge and fined $250. He appealed to the Sixth Judicial District Court, which affirmed the conviction. He then appealed to the Nevada Supreme Court, arguing that the requirement that he identify himself to any police officer upon request violated the Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures and his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. The Nevada Supreme Court rejected these arguments, and Hiibel asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.

== Majority opinion ==
Stop-and-identify laws have their roots in early English vagrancy laws under which suspected vagrants were subject to arrest unless they gave a &quot;good account&quot; of themselves; this practice, in turn, derived from the common-law power of any person to arrest suspicious persons and detain them until they gave &quot;a good account&quot; of themselves. Modern stop-and-identify laws combine aspects of the old vagrancy laws with a guide for police officers conducting investigatory stops, such as those authorized under &quot;Terry v. Ohio&quot;, .

However, the Court has identified a constitutional difficulty with many modern vagrancy laws. In &quot;Papachristou v. Jacksonville&quot;, , the Court held that a traditional vagrancy law was void for vagueness because its &quot;broad scope and imprecise terms denied proper notice to potential offenders and permitted police officers to exercise unfettered discretion in the enforcement of the law.&quot; In &quot;Brown v. Texas&quot;, , the Court struck down the application of Texas&#x27;s stop-and-identify statute against Brown. They held that the Fourth Amendment requires reasonable suspicion to believe that an individual had committed, was committing, or was going to commit a crime before an individual can be required to identify himself, and that the presence of an individual in a known drug area cannot establish reasonable suspicion without more. And in &quot;Kolender v. Lawson&quot;, , the Court struck down a California stop-and-identify law that required a suspect to provide &quot;credible and reliable identification&quot; upon request. The words &quot;credible and reliable&quot; were vague because they &quot;provided no standard for determining what a suspect must do to comply with [the law], resulting in virtually unrestrained power to arrest and charge persons with a violation.&quot;

&quot;The present case begins where our prior cases left off. Here there is no question that the initial stop was based on reasonable suspicion, satisfying the Fourth Amendment requirements noted in &quot;Brown&quot;. Further, the petitioner has not alleged that the statute is unconstitutionally vague, as in &quot;Kolender&quot;. Here the Nevada statute is narrower and precise.&quot; The Nevada Supreme Court had held that the Nevada statute required only that the suspect divulge his name; presumably, he could do so without handing over any documents whatsoever. As long as the suspect tells the officer his name, he has satisfied the dictates of the Nevada stop-and-identify law.

The narrow requirements of Nevada&#x27;s stop-and-identify law meant that it did not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment. &quot;In the ordinary course a police officer is free to ask a person for identification without implicating the Fourth Amendment.&quot; Since &quot;Terry&quot;, it has been clear that a police officer who reasonably suspects that a person is involved in criminal activity may detain a person long enough to dispel that suspicion. Questions related to a person&#x27;s identity are a &quot;routine and accepted part of many &quot;Terry&quot; stops.&quot; Knowing a person&#x27;s identity may, of course, help to clear a suspect and divert the attention of the police to another suspect. On the other hand, knowing the suspect&#x27;s name may just as quickly confirm to the officer that the person is wanted for another, unrelated crime. In cases such as this, where the police are investigating a domestic dispute, officers &quot;need to know whom they are dealing with in order to assess the situation, the threat to their own safety, and possible danger to the potential victim.&quot; &quot;The request for identity has an immediate relation to the purpose, rationale, and practical demands of a &quot;Terry&quot; stop. The threat of criminal sanction helps ensure that the request for identity does not become a legal nullity.&quot; Balancing the intrusion into the individual&#x27;s privacy against the extent to which the stop-and-identify law promotes legitimate government interests, the Court concluded that the Fourth Amendment did not prohibit Nevada from making it a crime for a person detained under conditions of &quot;Terry&quot; to refuse to disclose his name to a police officer upon request.

Furthermore, the officer&#x27;s request that Hiibel identify himself did not implicate Hiibel&#x27;s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. There was no &quot;articulated real and appreciable fear that [Hiibel&#x27;s] name would be used to incriminate him, or that it &#x27;would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute&#x27; him.&quot; Because Hiibel did not articulate reasonable belief that his name could be used as an incriminating piece of evidence, he could not invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege in refusing to disclose it.

== Dissenting opinions ==
Justice Stevens opined that the Court&#x27;s precedent required it to strike down Nevada&#x27;s stop-and-identify law. Under the Court&#x27;s &quot;Terry&quot; jurisprudence, a suspect has always had the right to refuse to answer questions put to him by police officers during a &quot;Terry&quot; stop. And the Fifth Amendment privilege had always attached during custodial interrogations because information extorted by the police during such interrogations is unavoidably testimonial. Why else would the police ask for a person&#x27;s name, if not to determine whether that person was either wanted for committing a crime or directly suspected of committing a crime? &quot;The officer in this case told [Hiibel] that he was conducting an investigation and needed to see some identification. As the target of that investigation, [Hiibel], in my view, acted well within his rights when he opted to stand mute. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.&quot;

Justice Breyer noted that 
the Court wrote that an &#x27;officer may ask the [&quot;Terry&quot;] detainee a moderate number of questions to determine his identity and to try to obtain information confirming or dispelling the officer&#x27;s suspicions. &quot;But the detainee is not obliged to respond&quot;.&#x27; &quot;Berkemer v. McCarty&quot;, (emphasis added)... the Court&#x27;s statement in &quot;Berkemer&quot;, while technically dicta, is the kind of strong dicta that the legal community typically takes as a statement of the law. And that law has remained undisturbed for more than 20 years. There is no good reason now to reject this generation-old statement of the law.

Justice Breyer also expressed a &quot;slippery-slope&quot; concern that the majority&#x27;s opinion would lead to allowing the police to ask follow-up questions, such as what the person&#x27;s license number is, or where a person lives, without running afoul of constitutional protections.

<doc id="741885" wikidata="Q7776325" url="?curid=741885" title="The Writer's Almanac">
<text>The Writer&#x27;s Almanac is a daily podcast and newsletter of poetry and historical interest pieces, usually of literary significance. Begun as a radio program in 1993, it is hosted by Garrison Keillor and was produced and distributed by American Public Media through November 2017. It is also available as a podcast. Past program sponsors include The Poetry Foundation (using funds from a large bequest from philanthropist Ruth Lilly), publisher of &quot;Poetry Magazine&quot; and The Mosaic Foundation of Rita and Peter Heydon.

Each program is at least five minutes long and begins with the phrase &quot;And here is the Writer&#x27;s Almanac for [insert date here]&quot;. Each program includes vignettes about authors and other noteworthy people whose birthdays or significant events coincide with the program&#x27;s date, as well as excerpts of important events in history. The program continues with one or more poems chosen by Keillor, and ends with Keillor&#x27;s traditional sign-off, &quot;Be well, do good work, and keep in touch.&quot; The program&#x27;s theme music is a version of the Swedish song &quot;Ge mig en dag&quot;, performed by Richard Dworsky on the piano. The original theme music was from Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s Slavonic Dance, Op. 72, No. 8.

Written by Betsy Allister, Joy Biles, Priscilla Kinter, Robert McGinley Myers, Heather McPherson, and Holly Vanderhaar, the program was engineered and edited by Thomas Scheuzger, Noah Smith, and Sam Hudson. Production assistance was by Kathy Roach and Katrina Cicala.

In 2005 the program was briefly canceled by Kentucky public radio station WUKY due to concerns about purportedly indecent content in some of the poems. The station reinstated the program after receiving an &quot;outpouring of support&quot; for it. The program was distributed in APM&#x27;s &quot;Classical 24&quot; stream and many stations that carry it air all or mostly Classical music during other times.

In November 2017, after allegations of inappropriate behavior by Keillor toward someone who worked for him on a freelance basis, Minnesota Public Radio terminated its contracts with him and his private media companies. This effectively ended the distribution and broadcast of &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Almanac&quot; on public radio, as well as rebroadcasts of Keillor&#x27;s &quot;A Prairie Home Companion.&quot;

In the spring 2018, Keillor restarted &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Almanac&quot; on his website. In summer 2018, he added the option of subscribing to the newsletter version.

In April 2018, Minnesota Public Radio posted a message stating its intent to re-establish the online archives of &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Almanac&quot; and &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;: .

<doc id="741886" wikidata="Q55174" url="?curid=741886" title="Meg Whitman">
<text>Margaret Cushing Whitman (born August 4, 1956) is an American business executive, diplomat, and politician who had served as the United States ambassador to Kenya since 2022 until her resignation on November 13, 2024. Whitman was president and chief executive officer (CEO) of eBay from 1998 to 2008. Afterwards, she became president and CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise from 2011 to 2015, during the company&#x27;s major split. She then served as the CEO of Quibi from its launch in 2018 until its closure in 2020. A member of the Republican Party, she ran for governor of California in 2010 and was lost to former California Governor Jerry Brown. Whitman was a senior presidential campaign official for Republican Mitt Romney in both 2008 and 2012, although she supported Democrats Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in the 2016 presidential election and the 2020 presidential election, respectively.

Whitman was an executive at The Walt Disney Company, where she was vice president of Strategic Planning throughout the 1980s. In the 1990s, she was an executive for DreamWorks, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Hasbro. During Whitman&#x27;s 10 years with eBay, she oversaw its expansion from 30 employees and $4 million in annual revenue, to more than 15,000 employees and $8 billion in annual revenue. In 2014, Whitman was named 20th in &quot;Forbes&quot; List of the 100 Most Powerful Women in the World.

In 2008, Whitman was cited by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as among the women most likely to become the first female president of the United States. She ran for governor of California in 2010, winning the Republican primary. The fifth-wealthiest woman in California with a net worth of $1.3 billion in 2010, she spent, at the time, more of her own money on a single election than any other political candidate in American history. The $144 million of her own fortune she used for the race (the campaign spent $178.5 million in total, including money from donors) was surpassed only by Michael Bloomberg in the 2020 presidential election. Whitman was defeated by Democratic former Governor Jerry Brown in the 2010 California gubernatorial election, 54% to 41%.

In December 2021, Whitman was nominated by President Joe Biden to serve as the United States Ambassador to Kenya. She was confirmed in July 2022 and took office the following month. In November 2024, she presented her resignation as US Ambassador to Kenya.

==Early life and education==
Whitman was born in Cold Spring Harbor, New York, the daughter of Margaret Cushing (née Goodhue) and Hendricks Hallett Whitman Jr. Her patrilineal great-great-great-grandfather, Elnathan Whitman, was a member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. Through her father, Whitman is also a great-great-granddaughter of U.S. Senator Charles B. Farwell, of Illinois. On her mother&#x27;s side, she is a great-granddaughter of historian and jurist Munroe Smith and a great-great-granddaughter of General Henry S. Huidekoper. Her paternal grandmother, born Adelaide Chatfield-Taylor, was the daughter of writer Hobart Chatfield-Taylor and his wife, Rose Farwell Chatfield-Taylor, and the sister of economist Wayne Chatfield-Taylor.

Whitman attended Cold Spring Harbor High School in Cold Spring Harbor, New York, graduating after three years in 1974. In her memoirs, she says she was in the top 10 of her class. She wanted to be a doctor, so she studied math and science at Princeton University. However, after spending a summer selling advertisements for the magazine &quot;Business Today&quot;, she changed over to the study of economics. She graduated with an A.B. in economics with honors from Princeton University in 1977 after completing an 83-page-long senior thesis titled &quot;The Marketing of American Consumer Products in Western Europe.&quot; Whitman then obtained an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School in 1979.

Whitman is married to Griffith Harsh IV, Chair of Neurosurgery at the University of California, Davis, previously at Stanford University Medical Center. They have two sons, Griffith Harsh V and William Harsh, both of whom had college careers marred by violent behavior. Whitman has lived in Atherton, California, since March 1998. Whitman College, a residential college completed in 2007 at Princeton University, was named for Meg Whitman following her $30 million donation.

==Career==
===Early work===
Whitman began her career in 1979 as a brand manager at Procter &amp; Gamble in Cincinnati, Ohio. Whitman later moved on to work as a consultant at Bain &amp; Company. She rose through the ranks to achieve the position of senior vice president.

Whitman became vice president of strategic planning at the Walt Disney Company in 1989. Two years later, she joined the Stride Rite Corporation before becoming president and CEO of Florists&#x27; Transworld Delivery in 1995.

As Hasbro&#x27;s Playskool Division general manager, starting in January 1997, she oversaw global management and marketing of two children&#x27;s brands, Playskool and Mr. Potato Head. She also imported the UK&#x27;s children&#x27;s television show Teletubbies into the U.S.

===eBay===

Whitman joined eBay in March 1998, when it had 30 employees and annual revenues of approximately $4 million. Despite initially not wanting to take on the role, during her time as CEO, through 2008, the company grew to approximately 15,000 employees and $8 billion in annual revenue. Originally, when Whitman joined eBay, she found the website as a simple black and white webpage using the Courier typeface. On her first day, the site crashed for eight hours. She believed the site to be confusing and began by building a new executive team. Whitman organized the company by splitting it into 23 business categories. She then assigned executives to each, including some 35,000 subcategories. In 2002, soon after its initial public offering, PayPal became a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay valued at $1.5 billion. In 2004, Whitman made several key changes in her management team. Jeff Jordan took over PayPal, Matt Bannick took over international operations, and Bill Cobb took over U.S. operations, which has the colorful U.S. logo, while each international site has unique branding.

Whitman picked John J. Donahoe for eBay in March 2005 as president of eBay Marketplaces, responsible for all elements of eBay&#x27;s global ecommerce businesses.

During Whitman&#x27;s tenure as CEO, eBay completed the purchase of Skype for $4.1B in cash and stock in September 2005. eBay later admitted that it had overpaid and, in 2009, eBay sold Skype to a group of investors led by Silver Lake Partners at a valuation of $2.75B. In 2011, after the first papers were filed for a possible IPO, Microsoft purchased Skype for US$8.5B.

In June 2007, while preparing for an interview with Reuters, Whitman allegedly shoved her subordinate, communications employee Young Mi Kim. Of the incident, Whitman related, &quot;In any high-pressure working environment, tensions can surface.&quot; Kim also stated, &quot;Yes, we had an unfortunate incident, but we resolved it in a way that speaks well for her and for eBay.&quot; The matter was resolved after a $200,000 settlement.

Whitman resigned as CEO of eBay in November 2007, but remained on the board and served as an advisor to new CEO John Donahoe until late 2008. She was inducted into the U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 2008. &quot;I&#x27;ve said for some time that 10 years is roughly the right time to stay at the helm at a company like ours&quot;, she said in an interview with the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, adding that &quot;it&#x27;s time for new leadership, a new perspective and a new vision.&quot;

Whitman has received numerous awards and accolades for her work at eBay. On more than one occasion, she was named among the top five most powerful women by &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine. &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; named her the eighth-best-performing CEO of the past decade and the &quot;Financial Times&quot; named her as one of the 50 faces that shaped the decade.

===Hewlett-Packard===

In January 2011, Whitman joined Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s (HP) board of directors. She was named CEO on September 22, 2011. As well as renewing focus on HP&#x27;s Research &amp; Development division, Whitman&#x27;s major decision during her first year as CEO was to retain and recommit the firm to the PC business that her predecessor announced he was considering discarding.

In 2012, Whitman announced that HP would write down $8.8 billion of the value of Autonomy, the British software company it had purchased the previous year. The announcement eventually led to a civil case in the UK in 2019 at which Whitman testified to having not carried out &quot;proper calculations of the write-down.&quot;

In May 2013, Bloomberg L.P. named Whitman &quot;Most Underachieving CEO&quot; – along with Apple&#x27;s CEO Tim Cook (ranked 12th) and IBM&#x27;s Virginia Rometty (ranked 10th) – whose stocks had all turned in the worst numbers relative to the broader market since the beginning of each CEO&#x27;s tenure. HP&#x27;s stock led the list by underperforming by 30.7 percentage points since Whitman took the job.

On July 26, 2017, Whitman stepped down as chair of HP Inc.&#x27;s board of directors, while remaining as CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). Whitman fought off further rumours around her position at HPE, where she was quoted by &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;So let me make this as clear as I can. I am fully committed to HPE and plan to remain the company&#x27;s C.E.O. We have a lot of work still to do at HPE and I am not going anywhere&quot; 

On November 21, 2017, it was announced Whitman was stepping down as the CEO of HPE, effective February 1, 2018, with HPE president Antonio Neri taking over as CEO.

===Quibi===
Whitman was CEO of Quibi, a short-form media content app designed for smartphones. In September 2020, just 5 months after its launch, Quibi was considering sale or acquisition with a valuation of $500 million, despite its $1.75 billion initial investment, having failed to meet subscriber targets. Coverage and analysis has blamed this failure on the concept itself, and failures of leadership from Whitman due to her lack of “experience in the industry of the company she is running.” The failure of the app was predicted by many in the Silicon Valley tech ecosystem, with one critic, Rob Enderle listing this as the most recent in Whitman&#x27;s “repetitive failures” due to her “inability to take responsibility for mistakes, an inability to support subordinates, a focus on shifting blame, and a lack of subject matter expertise.”

===Boards===
Whitman also served on the board of directors of the eBay Foundation, Summit Public Schools, Procter &amp; Gamble and DreamWorks SKG, until early 2009. She was appointed to the board of Goldman Sachs in October 2001 and then resigned in December 2002, amidst controversy that she had received shares in several public offerings managed by Goldman Sachs, although she denied any wrongdoing. (see Ties to Goldman Sachs for further detail). In March 2011, she was appointed to a part-time special adviser at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins.

She has also joined the boards of Zipcar and Teach for America, and re-joined the board of Procter &amp; Gamble. Whitman has also been a member of the board at SurveyMonkey.

===Sports investments===

====IGC====
In 2018, Meg Whitman invested in and joined the board of the eSports organization Immortals Gaming Club.

====FC Cincinnati====
In November 2019, Meg Whitman purchased a minority stake in FC Cincinnati. Whitman will serve as the club&#x27;s Alternate Governor on the MLS Board of Governors.

=== Biden administration ===

On December 8, 2021, President Joe Biden nominated Whitman to serve as United States ambassador to Kenya. Hearings on her nomination were held before the Senate&#x27;s Foreign Relations Committee on May 24, 2022. The committee favorably reported her nomination on June 9, 2022. On July 14, 2022, her nomination was confirmed in the Senate by voice vote. She presented her credentials to President Uhuru Kenyatta on August 5, 2022.
In November 2024, following the election of Donald Trump, Whitman presented her resignation as US Ambassador to Kenya.

==Philanthropy==

Whitman founded a charitable foundation with husband Harsh on December 21, 2006, by donating to it 300,000 shares of eBay stock worth $9.4 million. By the end of its first year of operation, the Griffith R. Harsh IV and Margaret C Whitman Charitable Foundation had $46 million in assets and has disbursed $125,000 to charitable causes. Most of the money disbursed went to the Environmental Defense Fund.

In 2010, Warren Buffett asked Whitman to join the Giving Pledge in which billionaires would commit to donating half of their money to charity, and Whitman declined. In 2011, the foundation donated $2.5 million to Summit Public Schools, which operates several charter schools in the San Jose area.

As of 2020, Meg Whitman is the national board chair of Teach for America.

==Political career==
===Presidential endorsements and fundraising===

Whitman was a supporter of the Mitt Romney 2008 presidential campaign and was a member of his national finance team. She was also listed as finance co-chair of Romney&#x27;s exploratory committee. After Romney stepped out of the race and endorsed John McCain, Whitman joined McCain&#x27;s presidential campaign as a national co-chair. McCain mentioned Whitman as a possible secretary of the treasury during the second presidential debate in 2008, but lost the election to Barack Obama.

During the 2012 Republican primaries, Whitman endorsed Mitt Romney, who praised her. Whitman&#x27;s name was mentioned as a possible cabinet member in a Romney administration before he lost to Obama.

During the 2016 Republican primaries, Whitman was finance co-chair of the Chris Christie 2016 presidential campaign. After Christie withdrew from the race and subsequently endorsed Donald Trump, Whitman criticized it as &quot;an astonishing display of political opportunism&quot; and called on other Christie donors to reject Trump, whom she compared to Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. In August, Whitman endorsed the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign, stating that to vote for Trump &quot;out of party loyalty alone would be to endorse a candidacy that I believe has exploited anger, grievance, xenophobia and racial division&quot;. Acknowledging policy differences with Clinton, Whitman nonetheless praised her &quot;temperament, global experience and commitment to America&#x27;s bedrock national values&quot;. She called on all Republicans &quot;to put country first before party&quot; and added that she would support the campaign financially.

Whitman spoke at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in support of the party&#x27;s presidential nominee Joe Biden.

===2010 gubernatorial campaign===

On February 10, 2009, Whitman announced she would run for governor of California in the 2010 election. On June 8, 2010, Whitman won the Republican primary, becoming the first female to run on the Republican ticket and the third female overall to run for Governor of California after Dianne Feinstein in 1990 and Kathleen Brown in 1994. Her campaign was largely self-funded. She ultimately lost to Jerry Brown.

According to final reports, Whitman spent $144 million from her own personal funds. As of 2010, this was more than any other self-funded political candidate in U.S. history.

In June 2010, Whitman released a political ad, &quot;A Lifetime in Politics A Legacy of Failure&quot;, which seemingly contained one image of the FAIL Blog website, making it appear in the ad as if Jerry Brown had been the subject of one of the website&#x27;s namesake &quot;fails&quot;. Ben Huh, founder of the Cheezburger Network, of which failblog.org is a part, demanded an apology and the removal of the video, stating that the image was faked, and that the website is non-partisan and has never endorsed a particular political candidate or party.

On November 2, 2010, at 11:35 pm, Whitman conceded the election to Brown, stating, &quot;We&#x27;ve come up a little short.&quot;

====Voting record====
In 2010, &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; reported that Whitman did not vote for 28 years, after reviewing her voting records in California. Whitman has described her voting record as &quot;inexcusable&quot;, apologized for it, and stated that she is happy to discuss the matter. Whitman answered questions about her record in September, replying, &quot;And I think the reason for many years, I wasn&#x27;t as engaged in the political process and should have been.&quot;

====Housekeeper controversy====
In September 2010, Nicky Diaz Santillan revealed that she was employed in the Whitman household as a housekeeper and nanny from 2000 to 2009 despite her status as an illegal worker. Whitman&#x27;s campaign released documents which she said Santillan provided prior to her employment including a driver&#x27;s license, social security ID, and application. Santillan said Whitman knew she was undocumented, producing a 2003 letter from the Social Security Administration stating that her Social Security number did not match her name. Whitman initially stated that they &quot;never received those letters&quot;, however, after a hand-written note on the document was shown, believed to be from Whitman&#x27;s husband, they acknowledged they may have received it, but forgot. Santillan&#x27;s attorney, Gloria Allred, states that Santillan was fired for the sake of the campaign. Whitman&#x27;s campaign maintained that this was a political attack, stating that Allred is a Jerry Brown supporter. Brown, Allred and Santillan all denied this.

Crystal Williams, director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, stated, &quot;Not only is accepting the documents all the law required [Whitman] to do, but there&#x27;s a counterbalancing anti-discrimination law that keeps her from probing further or demanding different documents.&quot; Others disagreed; immigration lawyer Greg Siskind stated Whitman was the employer, and the documents by law needed to be signed by her but were not, nor did they have a Social Security number on them. The &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; noted that Whitman &quot;hired her, paid her and had direct contact with her for nine years&quot;, so should have known her legal status. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that Latino voters were more likely interested that Whitman treated Santillan &quot;like a piece of garbage&quot; when the maid asked for help finding an immigration attorney, and Whitman allegedly stated &quot;you don&#x27;t know me and I don&#x27;t know you&quot;.

====Ties to Goldman Sachs====
Goldman Sachs, whose executives donated $100,000 to the Whitman campaign, manages a part of Whitman&#x27;s fortune. As CEO of eBay, Whitman earned approximately $1.78 million resulting from a practice known as spinning whereby executives who did business with Goldman Sachs could reap profits by getting early deals before the public on hot IPOs offered by the bank. Whitman later resigned from the Goldman Sachs board after some expressed concern over her receiving shares from Goldman Sachs. In commenting on Whitman&#x27;s resignation from the Goldman Sachs board, eBay spokesman Henry Gomez told &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; at the time that, &quot;If we wanted to use Goldman&#x27;s services, she doesn&#x27;t want there to be even the slightest perception of any conflict. She&#x27;s doing this because she thinks quite highly of the firm.&quot; While Whitman was on Goldman Sachs&#x27; board, she served on the compensation committee, which approved multimillion-dollar bonus packages for then-CEO Henry Paulson and his top aides. Public domain documents reveal that Whitman has a multimillion-dollar stake in 21 investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs. Given Goldman Sachs&#x27; major investments in California state finances, all these ties to Goldman Sachs led to considerable controversy during the gubernatorial campaign. In response, Whitman vowed to eliminate any potential conflicts of interest, and publicly stated that she would immediately sell her Goldman Sachs stock and put her Goldman Sachs-managed investments in a blind trust if elected governor.

===United States Ambassador to Kenya Tenure===
In August 2022 Whitman attracted criticism and public outcry from opposition figures in Kenya for perceived partisan political remarks claiming the 2022 election was the freest and fairest in kenya&#x27;s election history despite numerous reports of electoral malpractises in kenya.Raila Odinga described whitman as a rogue ambassador calling for her to shut up on political partisan comments while claiming that kenya is not a US colony to warrant her perceived political partisan activities. Raila told the media he would demand her recall for her participation in partisan local politics.
With perceived political partisan positions, Whitman was repeatedly thought to support reported human rights abuses by the Ruto administration including a specific case where other western diplomats in Kenya signed a statement admonishing abductions and killings during the 25th June 2024 Gen Z protests in Kenya which Whitman did not sign.
According to Whitman it was not appropriate for her to participate in the signing that included congratulatory messages as well as messages admonishing the extra judicial abductions and extra judicial killings by the Ruto administration.
In November 2024 Whitman announced her resignation as ambassador following Trump&#x27;s win. Her resignation reportedly attracted celebrations from many including various kenyan politicians celebrating an end to a Democrat&#x27;s ambassadorial tenure perceived to be complicit in the numerous reported human rights abuses of the Ruto administration.

==Political positions==

While running for governor, Whitman emphasized three major areas: job creation, reduced state government spending, and reform of the state&#x27;s K-12 educational system. She argued that it is best to start only a few things and finish them, instead of starting a lot of things and finishing few of them.

===Environment===
Whitman said that if elected, on her first day she would have suspended AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, for a year to study its potential economic implications. AB 32 requires the state to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2020. At the state Republican Convention in March 2010, Whitman described California Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s climate change bill as a &quot;job-killer&quot;. Whitman opposed Proposition 23, which would delay the global warming law AB 32 until California&#x27;s unemployment falls to 5.5 percent and stays there for a year, stating that the proposition did not reasonably balance the need to protect jobs with the need to preserve environment.

On water issues, Whitman opposed further restrictions on water supply in the Central Valley, and she suggested that President Obama should overturn a federal judge&#x27;s ruling under provisions in the Endangered Species Act which reduced water supplies another 5% to 7%.

===Illegal immigration===
Whitman said that Arizona&#x27;s approach to illegal immigration with Arizona SB 1070 is wrong and that there are better ways to solve the problem. She said that, if she had lived in California in 1994, she would have voted against Proposition 187 concerning illegal immigrants. In an op-ed during her gubernatorial campaign, Whitman wrote, &quot;Clearly, when examining our positions on immigration, there is very little over which Jerry Brown and I disagree&quot;.

She stated that illegal immigrant students should be prohibited from attending state-funded institutions of higher education. Currently, California state law permits this. In 2009, Whitman called for &quot;a path to legalization&quot; of illegal immigrants. In a 2010 interview on television station KTLA, Whitman said, &quot;I want to hold employers accountable for hiring only documented workers.&quot;

===Marriage===
During the 2010 California gubernatorial election, Whitman supported California&#x27;s Proposition 8, which reversed &quot;In re Marriage Cases&quot; and defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman in the state. Whitman also criticized Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Attorney General Jerry Brown for not defending Proposition 8 in the federal judicial system. However, on February 26, 2013, Whitman confirmed that she had reversed that opinion. Whitman stated, &quot;At the time, I believed the people of California had weighed in on this question and that overturning the will of the people was the wrong approach,&quot; and &quot;The facts and arguments presented during the legal process since then have had a profound impact on my thinking.&quot; Whitman also believes that gay and lesbian couples should be permitted to adopt children.

===Abortion===
Whitman supports abortion rights.

===Marijuana===
Whitman has said that the legalization of marijuana is not what any law enforcement person would suggest for any reason and that &quot;this is the worst idea [she has] ever seen.&quot;

===Infrastructure===
Whitman does not support the California High-Speed Rail project. In a 2010 letter to the &quot;Sacramento Bee&quot; Whitman&#x27;s spokeswoman Sarah Pompei said, &quot;Meg believes the state cannot afford the costs associated with high-speed rail due to our current fiscal crisis.&quot; Her opponent Jerry Brown was in favor of the project.

Whitman has made monetary donations to various candidates and political action committees (PAC). While these have gone to both Republicans and Democrats, the donations are weighted to Republicans. Though Whitman has contributed to a few Democrats, including Senator Barbara Boxer; donating $4,000 to her campaign and serving on the &quot;Friends of Boxer&quot; committee in 2004, she donated more than $225,000 during the same period to Republicans, eBay&#x27;s PAC and to Americans for a Republican Majority, the PAC of former Congressman Tom DeLay.

== Awards ==
In 2017, Whitman was the Commencement speaker for Carnegie Mellon University and was awarded an honorary doctorate degree.

<text>The Altai Republic (; ; , ; ), also known as Gorno-Altai Republic, and colloquially, and primarily referred to in Russian to distinguish from the neighbouring Altai Krai as the Gornyi Altai (), is a republic of Russia located in southern Siberia. The republic borders the Russian federal subjects of Kemerovo Oblast to the north, Khakassia to the northeast, Tuva to the east, Altai Krai to the west, as well it borders three countries: Mongolia to the southeast, China to the south and Kazakhstan to the southwest. It is a part of the Siberian Federal District, and covers an area of , with a population of 210,924 residents. It is the least-populous republic of Russia and least-populous federal subject in the Siberian Federal District. Gorno-Altaysk is the capital and the largest town of the republic with 65,342 inhabitants and in urban areas, making it the least urbanized federal subject.

The Altai Republic is one of Russia&#x27;s ethnic republics, primarily representing the indigenous Altai people, a Turkic ethnic group that form 37% of the republic&#x27;s population, while ethnic Russians form a majority at 54%. Other minority populations include Kazakhs, other Central Asian ethnicities, and Germans. The official languages of the Altai Republic are Russian and Altai. Kazakh is official in areas of compact settlement of its speakers.

== History ==
The Xiongnu Empire (209 BC – AD 93) governed the territory of the modern Altai Republic. The area was part of the First Turkic Khaganate, the Uyghur Empire, and the Yeniseian Kyrgyzs. It was during this time that the local population became fully Turkicized culturally and linguistically.

The southern part of the Altai Republic came under the Naiman Khanate. The territory of the modern Altai Republic has been ruled by the Mongolic Xianbei state (93–234), Rouran Khaganate (330–555), Mongol Empire (1206–1368), Golden Horde (1240–1502), Zunghar Khanate (1634–1758) and Qing Empire (1757–1864).

The Qing period is a semi-autonomous period with the supervision of two Altan Nuur Uriankhai Governor Banners and part of the seven Altai Uriankhai banners. During the Qing administration, the General of Siberia Fedor Ivanovich Soimonov launched a non-military expedition into the Altan Nuur region in 1760 and began fort building. This was subsequently removed by Heseri Jalafungga of the Qing. Since the 1820s, the routine border check was less frequent and the Chuy drainage basin has been occupied by Russians.

The entire Altan Nuur Uriankhai voluntarily became part of Russian Empire in 1864-1865 by the Treaty of Tarbagatai. During the Russian Civil War, the Confederated Republic of Altai (Karakorum-Altai Region) was established in 1918, and declared as the first step to rebuilding Genghis Khan&#x27;s Mongol Empire. But it never became a competing force in the Russian Civil War, and stayed neutral from 1918 until January 1920, when it was annexed back into Russia. A second Altai Republic was formed in 1921 and lasted until 1922 when they were annexed by the Bolsheviks.

On June 1, 1922, the Altaians regained autonomy with the creation of the Oyrot Autonomous Oblast (), part of Altai Krai. The original name for this region was Bazla. On January 7, 1948, it was renamed Gorno-Altai Autonomous Oblast (). In 1991 it was reorganized into the Gorno-Altai Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR). In 1992 it was renamed as the Altai Republic.

==Geography==
The Altai Republic is situated in the Altai Mountains in the very center of Asia at the junction of the Siberian taiga, the steppes of Kazakhstan and the semi-deserts of Mongolia. Forests cover about 25% of the republic&#x27;s territory.

*&quot;Area&quot;: 
*&quot;Borders&quot;:
**&quot;internal&quot;: Kemerovo Oblast (N), Republic of Khakassia (NE), Tuva Republic (E), and Altai Krai (W/NW).
**&quot;international&quot;: Mongolia (Bayan-Ölgii Province) (SE), China (Altay Prefecture, Xinjiang) (S), and Kazakhstan (East Kazakhstan Province) (S/SW)
*&quot;Highest point&quot;: Mount Belukha (4,506 m)
*&quot;Maximum N–S distance&quot;: 360 km
*&quot;Maximum E–W distance&quot;: 380 km
===Rivers and lakes===
More than 20,000 tributaries sprawl throughout the mountainous Republic, making for a total of more than worth of waterways. The republic&#x27;s largest rivers are the Katun and the Biya, both of which originate in the mountains and flow northwards. The junction of the two rivers eventually forms the Ob River, one of the longest rivers in Siberia, which flows northward to the Arctic Ocean.

The source of the black Biya River is Lake Teletskoye, the region&#x27;s largest lake located in an isolated area far south in the mountains. The emerald-colored Katun River has its source at the Gebler glacier, which is situated on the Republic&#x27;s highest point, Mount Belukha. The Katun River, in particular, holds a religious significance for native Altaians, as well as for many Russians who live in the area, as Mount Belukha is known in Altai folklore to be the gateway to the mystical kingdom of Shambhala.

The hydrographic network of the Republic also includes approximately 7,000 lakes, adding up to a total area of more than . The largest lake is Lake Teletskoye, which is long and wide, has an area of , and has a maximum depth of . The mountain lakes of Altai contain enormous freshwater reserves of a very pure quality as a result of their distance from civilization. Lake Teletskoye alone contains more than of very clear water.

Potential groundwater storage is evaluated at per day, while the present use constitutes about per day.

===Mountains===
The most striking geographical aspect of the Republic of Altai is its mountainous terrain. The Republic is situated within the Russian part of the Altai Mountains system, which covers a large part of the Republic and continues into neighboring Kazakhstan, Mongolia and China. The region continues to experience periodic notable seismic activity, which is visually made apparent through the mountains&#x27; characteristically high and rugged mountain ridges, separated by narrow and deep river valleys. The Republic&#x27;s highest peak, Mount Belukha (4,506 m), is the highest point in Siberia.

===Natural resources===
Various bodies of water are among the most important natural resources of the Republic. Mineral and hot springs are popular destinations for tourists and locals, sought for their therapeutic effects. Additionally, Altai glaciers contain a great amount of fresh water. The general volume of ice for registered Altai glaciers comes to a total of 57 km3, 52 km3 of which is water. The total water stock of the glaciers exceeds the average annual effluence of all Altai rivers, which are equal to 43 km3 per year. The largest glaciers are Bolshoy Taldurinsky (35 km2), Mensu (21 km2), Sofiysky (17 km2), and Bolshoy Maashey (16 km2).

Mineral resources in the region primarily include gold, silver, iron ores, and lithium, in addition to other smaller amounts of minerals. The large city of Barnaul in neighboring Altai Krai was founded as a processing center for minerals from the Altai region, although the mineral extraction industry today is much smaller than in the past.

===Climate===
The republic has a temperate continental climate with relatively short and mild summers (June–August); and long, cold, and often quite frosty winters (November–March).

In general, the republic&#x27;s climate of the southeastern areas, such as the (Ulagansky and Kosh-Agachsky Districts), is harsher than the climate of the less elevated northern areas.
*&quot;Average annual temperature&quot;: +1 °C to −6.7 °C.
*&quot;January temperature range&quot;: -9.2 °C to −31 °C.
*&quot;July temperature range&quot;: +11 °C to +19 °C.

*&quot;Average annual precipitation&quot;: 100–1000 mm.

Tourism has also begun to be a large part of the economy, and a significant number of new hotels and resorts have appeared.

=== Mining ===
* Alakhinskoye mine (lithium reserve)

=== Transportation ===
The Altai Republic is one of the few Russian political divisions without rail access. The main paved road is the Chuysky Tract, which spans the republic from the capital Gorno-Altaisk in the north to the Mongolian border in the south. The republic&#x27;s main paved road threads its way through the rugged Altai Mountains. A system of taxis and buses transports people between settlements. Within the settlements, people generally walk or ride horses.

Helicopters are used for emergency transportation, to supply remote government outposts, and by wealthy tourists. In 2012, runway capacity at the Gorno-Altaysk Airport near the republic&#x27;s capital, was doubled. In June that same year, S7 Airlines started direct flights from Moscow. Prior to this, passengers used to fly through Barnaul in Altai Krai or Novosibirsk.

=== Tourism ===


With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Altai Republic&#x27;s tourism industry has greatly expanded. Although wealthy Russians from neighboring Russian regions are the most common sort of tourist in Altai, foreign interest has also grown in the area, especially due to the area&#x27;s spiritual significance.

Popular tourist destinations tend to be concentrated in the north, where the roads are more accessible. They are also almost entirely located along the Chuiskiy highway, which is the main road from the north into the mountains, although it is currently (2006) only two lanes wide. The north is also significantly warmer than the elevated southern areas, which tend to be chilly even in the summer.

Some of the more well-known tourist spots in the Altai Republic include Lake Aiya, a popular bathing spot, and the picturesque Chemal region. More adventurous travelers sometimes visit the more remote Lake Teletskoye or Mount Belukha in the south.

== Education ==
There is one university (Gorno-Altaysk State University), 12 colleges, and 205 secondary schools in the republic.

== Religion ==
Different religions are present in Altai. According to a 2012 survey, 27.6% of the population adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church. The second most popular religions are ethnic and nature religions, namely Rodnovery (Slavic native faith), Tengrism (Central Asians&#x27; native faith) and Burkhanism, constituting altogether 13% of the population. 6% of the population follows Islam, 2% Hinduism (including Slavic-Vedic, Krishnaite, and Tantric movements), 1% are Old Believers and 1% Protestants. 25% of the population is &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, 14% is atheist and 7.4% follows other religions or did not answer the question.

The traditional religion of the native Altaians is Tengrist shamanism, revived by modern Tengrist movements and Burkhanism. Ethnic Russians primarily practice Russian Orthodox Christianity and Rodnovery (Slavic native faith), while Kazakhs are traditionally Muslims. Tibetan Buddhism has also recently begun making some inroads by way of neighboring Mongolia and Tuva.

It is unknown when Buddhism came into Altai but in various periods of history, the territory of the Altai and its population found themselves in full or partial subjection to neighboring states, where Buddhism was the official or one of the official religions: the state of the Khitans (tenth-twelfth centuries), the Mongol Empire (thirteenth-fourteenth centuries), and the Dzhungar Khanate (seventeenth-eighteenth centuries).

From 1904 until the 1930s, a new religious movement called Burkhanism (or &quot;Ak Jang&quot;, the &quot;white faith&quot;) was popularized among native Altaians. The religion originated in Altai and emphasized the &quot;white&quot; aspect of shamanistic practice. Burkhanism remains an important component of Altai national consciousness and is currently being revived in several forms along with indigenous Altai culture in general.

Russian Pagan followers often go on pilgrimages to Mount Belukha, which is considered to be the location of Shambhala both by some Pagans and locals of Altai. One can often find manifestations of shamanistic spirituality in the region; for example, at points along the Katun River, local believers in shamanic religions are known to tie white ribbons to nearby trees and leave offerings of coins or food to the spirits. Although shamanism is much less widely practiced today, it is regaining popularity as a result of new religious freedom following the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
== Culture ==
The indigenous Altai culture holds the lands of Altai to be sacred. The indigenous (Turkic) languages are focused on the stewardship of the lands. The Altai oral history is transmitted by throat-singers. The Altai culture was repressed during Soviet times and has been rebounding since then. The clans of all ten regions gather in the village of Yelo for a biennial cultural celebration.

There is also a large contingent of &quot;Old Believers&quot; who fled to Altai when they split from the Russian Orthodox Church over 300 years ago.

The UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Golden Mountains&quot; protects the Ukok Plateau, on which there are many standing stones and kurgans. Although archaeologists consider kurgans to be burial sites, the indigenous people believe that they are highly refined magnetic instruments for directing the flow of cosmic energy into the Earth. Thus, there is great local indignation about the excavation and removal of the Siberian Ice Maiden, an extraordinary 2,500-year-old mummy that had been preserved in permafrost.

Gorno-Altaisk is the location of the National Museum of the Altai Republic, which houses the mummy, the &quot;Altai Princess&quot;, the National Library of the Republic of Altai, the National Theatre of the Republic of Altai and the Municipal House of Culture.

Regularly held national holiday Maslenitsa, Nowruz, Chaga – Bayram, received in February 2013 with the official status of the Republican celebration.

In 2013, the Altai Republic participated in the Turkvision Song Contest. The Altai Republic&#x27;s entry was the song &quot;Altayym Menin&quot; performed by Artur Marlujokov. The Altai Republic placed fifth in the contest.

<text>Count Nikolay Pavlovich Ignatyev (historical spelling: &quot;Nicolai Ignatieff&quot;; ;  – ), a Russian statesman and diplomat, became best known for his aggressive expansionism in support of Russian imperialism. In dealing with China, he secured a large slice of Chinese territory by the multi-lateral Treaty of Peking in 1860. As the Russian ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1864 to 1877, he worked to stir up pan-Slavic feeling and nationalism against the Ottomans, and had some responsibility for the Bulgarian rebellion of April 1876. He encouraged his government to declare war on Turkey in 1877, and after the decisive Russian victory he negotiated the Treaty of San Stefano in 1878. It heralded greatly strengthened Russian influence in the Balkans. However Britain and Austria-Hungary intervened and forced the retraction of the treaty. As Minister of the Interior (in office: 1881-1882), Count Ignatyev promoted ultraconservative and Slavic-nationalist policies.

==Early life and military career==

Nikolay Ignatyev was born in St Petersburg, to Maria Ivanovna Maltsova and Captain Pavel Nikolayevich Ignatyev. His father had been taken into favour by Tsar Nicholas I, owing to his fidelity on the occasion of the Decembrist revolt in 1825, and Grand Duke Alexander (later Tsar Alexander II) stood sponsor at the boy&#x27;s baptism. After graduating from the Corps of Pages, at the age of seventeen he became an officer of the Russian Imperial Guard, serving with the Hussar Life Guards Regiment. Ignatyev was then appointed to the General Staff and become adjutant to the general commanding in the Estonian military district. He was promoted to major in 1856. During Ignatyev&#x27;s subsequent career he was at odds with Count Pyotr Shuvalov: another Corps of Pages alumnus.

==Diplomatic career==

Ignatyev&#x27;s diplomatic career began at the Congress of Paris in 1856, after the Crimean War, where he participated in the negotiations regarding the demarcation of the Russo-Ottoman frontier on the lower Danube. He was then appointed as military attaché at the Russian Embassy in London. This assignment was a short one. According to the memoirs &quot;Fifty Years of Service&quot; written by his nephew Alexei Alexeyevich Count Ignatiev, Nikolay Ignatyev &quot;inadvertently&quot; pocketed a newly developed cartridge while inspecting the ordnance works of the British Army. In order to avoid diplomatic embarrassment he returned to Russia. 

Two years later he was sent with a small escort on a dangerous mission to the Central Asian states of Khiva and Bukhara. The khan of Khiva laid a plan for detaining him as a hostage, but he eluded the danger and returned safely, after concluding a treaty of friendship with the emir of Bukhara.

Ignatyev&#x27;s next diplomatic exploit was in the Far East, as plenipotentiary to the court of Peking. When the Chinese government was terrified by the advance of the Anglo-French expedition of 1860 and the burning of the Old Summer Palace in the Second Opium War, he worked on their fears so dexterously that, in the Convention of Peking, he obtained for Russia Outer Manchuria – not only the left bank of the Amur river, the original object of the mission, but also a large extent of territory and seacoast south of that river that would become the Russian &quot;Maritime Province,&quot; the region of Primorsky Krai. 

==The Balkans==
Ignatyev&#x27;s success was supposed to prove his capacity for dealing with &quot;Orientals&quot; and paved his way to the post of ambassador at Constantinople, which he occupied from 1864 to 1877. Here his chief aim was to liberate the Christian nationalities in general and the Bulgarians in particular from Ottoman domination and bring them under the influence of Russia (&quot;See also Bulgarian Exarchate&quot; and &quot;Constantinople Conference&quot;). His restless activity in this field, mostly of a semiofficial and secret character, culminated in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, at the close of which he negotiated with the Ottoman plenipotentiaries the Treaty of San Stefano. The terms of this treaty were aimed at creating an enlarged &quot;Big Bulgaria&quot;, foreseen by Austria-Hungary and Britain as being under Russian domination. Ignatyev&#x27;s &quot;brilliant but reckless&quot; initiatives proved to be a major diplomatic miscalculation for Russia. 

As the war which he had done so much to bring about did not eventually secure for Russia advantages commensurate with the sacrifices involved, he fell into disfavour with Alexander II in part due to efforts of Count Pyotr Shuvalov, and retired from active service. Soon thereafter the Treaty of San Stefano was revised through the Treaty of Berlin, 1878, signed on Russia&#x27;s behalf by Count Pyotr Shuvalov.

Although Count Ignatyev remained widely popular in Bulgaria and was even considered by some for the Bulgarian throne, the throne was eventually granted to Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg, his personal enemy.

==Later life==
In the meantime Count Ignatyev served as Governor of Nizhny Novgorod, where he was credited with the expansion of the Makaryev Fair. Shortly after the accession of Alexander III in 1881, he was appointed Minister of the Interior on the understanding that he would carry out a nationalist, reactionary policy. In regards to the constitutional movement, he had personally told Alexander III that &quot;the revolutionary movement could easily be crushed.&quot; After a period of intense, violent, destructive antisemitic rioting, known as pogroms, which some accused Ignatyev of fomenting, he issued the infamous &quot;May Laws&quot; in May 1882. Other sources suggest he in fact followed a government policy (not always enforced by local authorities) of strict suppression of rioters and protection of the Jewish population:
Nikolai Ignatiev, installed as Minister of the Interior in May 1881,
decided on a policy of firm repression, although it was made difficult
by the unforeseeable character of the outbreaks and his limited forces.
Nevertheless, he ordered his men to fire upon rioters. In the towns of
Borisov and Nezhin this resulted in fatalities. In Kiev, 1400 arrests
were made. Many in the government felt this was still inadequate. The
police chief of Kiev wrote apologetically to the Tsar that the local military tribunals had been too lenient with the rioters; Alexander III
wrote in the margin: “This is inexcusable!”
He retired from office in June 1882. Explanations include that he was suspected of dishonesty or extortion, or that the Tsar feared he intended to introduce constitutional government by reviving the Zemsky Sobor (parliament). He had been referred to as &quot;Lord Liar&quot;, and Simon Sebag Montefiore has suggested he may have suffered from Munchausen Syndrome. When Lord Salisbury, as Secretary of State for India, met Ignatyev he recalled that &quot;he [Ignatyev] had the reputation, in a heavily contested field, of being the most accomplished liar in the Bosphorus.&quot; After that time he exercised no important influence in public affairs. He died in 1908.

==Honours==

* Graf Ignatiev Street, a busy trade street in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, is named after Nikolay Ignatiev.

* The elite Count Ignatiev Primary School, one of the oldest in Sofia, carries his name.

* The Bulgarian villages of Graf Ignatievo in Plovdiv Province and Ignatievo in Varna Province are named in his honour.

* Mount Ignatiev on Graham Land in Antarctica is also named after him.

==Personal life==
Count Nikolay Ignatiev was married to Yekaterina Leonidovna Galitzina (1842-1917), daughter of Prince Leonid Mikhailovich Galitzine and Anna Matveyevna Tolstaïa.

Their eight children included Ignatiev&#x27;s son, Count Pavel Ignatiev, who served as the last Minister of Education under Tsar Nicholas II and later moved to Canada. His grandson, George Ignatieff, was born in Russia and became a Canadian diplomat, and his great-grandson, Michael Ignatieff, is an academic and was the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada from 2008 to 2011.

Other sons of Count Ignatiev included:
- General Nikolai Nikolaevich Ignatiev (1872-1962), commander of the Preobrazhensky Regiment of the Imperial Guard;
- Alexey Nikolaevich Ignatiev (1874-1948), last governor of Kiev under Tsarist rule.

==In fiction==

In the novel &quot;Flashman at the Charge&quot; (1973) by George MacDonald Fraser, Ignatyev appears as a Russian military staff officer, who in 1854 presents a proposal to the Tsar of a Russian invasion of British-held India. He reappears in the 1975 novel &quot;Flashman in the Great Game&quot; as a fomenter of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. In both novels he is a villain: Fraser portrays him as intelligent and refined, but also ruthless, cruel, savage and dangerous.

<text>Joseph Anthony Ferrario (March 3, 1926 – December 12, 2003) was the third bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu and served from 1982 to 1993.

==Early life and priestly ministry==
Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Ferrario was ordained to the priesthood on May 19, 1951, at the age of 25. Part of a religious order of educators, the Sulpicians, Ferrario taught at various schools and seminaries.

==Auxiliary bishop==
On staff at the Saint Stephen Diocesan Seminary, Honolulu on the island of O`ahu, Ferrario was appointed auxiliary bishop of Honolulu on November 8, 1977. On January 13, 1978, he was consecrated titular bishop of Cusae and auxiliary to the Bishop of Honolulu.

Msgr. Charles Kekumano, Hawai‘i&#x27;s first native-born priest named a domestic prelate by Pope John XXIII, left the diocese to work in the Diocese of Juneau in Alaska when Ferrario was elevated to the episcopate.

==Bishop of Honolulu ==
With his predecessor&#x27;s retirement, Bishop Ferrario was appointed Bishop of Honolulu on May 13, 1982. One of his first actions as the ordinary of Honolulu was the removal of Msgr. Francis A. Marzen as editor of the diocesan newspaper, the Hawai‘i Catholic Herald. Msgr. Marzen had served as editor of the newspaper for approximately twenty years under the two previous bishops and publicly complained of his dismissal in an acerbic parting editorial published in the Hawai‘i Catholic Herald.

Bishop Ferrario revamped major diocesan offices and appointed pastors to parishes that were supportive of his vision of implementing the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council. Ferrario&#x27;s work in renewing the Honolulu diocese earned him the respect of many people in the Church in Hawai‘i.

==Decree of excommunication==
Bishop Ferrario&#x27;s harshest critics were the conservative followers of the Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre&#x27;s Priestly Society of Saint Pius X. Bishop Ferrario, through his judicial vicar, Father Joseph Bukoski, J.C.L., issued a canonical decree of excommunication to six individuals in 1991. Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith later reversed Bishop Ferrario&#x27;s action.

==Retirement ==
In 1993, Bishop Ferrario retired from active ministry. The Vatican appointed Bishop Francis Xavier DiLorenzo, S.T.D., Titular Bishop of Tigia and Auxiliary of Scranton, as Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Honolulu, after accepting Msgr. Ferrario&#x27;s resignation from the See of Honolulu, for health reasons.

The simultaneous notice of the Vatican&#x27;s acceptance of the retirement of Bishop Ferrario for health reasons and the appointment of Bishop DiLorenzo as Apostolic Administrator was read at solemn vespers at the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace, on October 12, 1993. Bishop DiLorenzo would serve as Apostolic Administrator until his appointment as Bishop of Honolulu in 1994.

After retirement, Msgr. Ferrario resided near Saint Anthony of Padua Church in Kailua and continued his charitable work with the Augustine Educational Foundation. He kept a vigorous schedule to raise money for Catholic education in the Hawaiian Islands through the Augustine Educational Foundation.

==Death==
He died of cardiac arrest on December 12, 2003, aged 77, and was buried at Hawaiian Memorial Park in Kane‘ohe. He was remembered for his compassion for the poor children in the Diocese of Honolulu.

<text>Q is a novel by Luther Blissett first published in Italian in 1999. The novel is set in Europe during the 16th century, and deals with Protestant reformation movements.

&quot;Luther Blissett&quot; was a &quot;nom de plume&quot; for four Italian authors (Roberto Bui, Giovanni Cattabriga, Federico Guglielmi and Luca Di Meo) who were part of the &quot;Luther Blissett Project&quot;, which ended in 1999. They now write under the name Wu Ming.

The novel has been translated into Danish, Dutch, English (British and American), French, German, Greek, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Turkish, Basque, Czech, Portuguese, Spanish, Serbian, and Chinese. All of the editions keep the original copyright statement, which allows the non-commercial reproduction of the book.

==Plot==
The book follows the journey of an Anabaptist radical across Europe in the first half of the 16th century as he joins in various movements and uprisings that come as a result of the Protestant reformation. The book spans 30 years as he is pursued by &#x27;Q&#x27; (short for &quot;Qoèlet&quot;), a spy for the Roman Catholic Church cardinal Giovanni Pietro Carafa. The main character, who changes his name many times during the story, first fights in the German Peasants&#x27; War beside Thomas Müntzer, during which time he takes part in negotiations which are eventually formalised as the Twelve Articles. Following this, he battles in Münster&#x27;s siege, during the Münster Rebellion, and some years later, in Venice.

==Interpretations and controversy==
Throughout Europe, several critics have read &quot;Q&quot; from a political point of view, and maintain that the novel is an allegory of European society after the decline of the 1960s and 1970s protest movements. As in the 16th century, the Counter-Reformation repressed any alternative theological current or radical social movement, and the Peace of Augsburg sanctioned the partition of the continent among Catholic and Protestant powers, so the last twenty years of the 20th century were marked by a vengeful rebirth of conservative ideologies, and the International Monetary Fund-driven corporate globalization of the economy seemed to rout any resistance.

This interpretation stems from the authors describing &quot;Q&quot; as a &quot;handbook of survival skills&quot;, which might cast a revealing light on the book&#x27;s ending. But, this is just one of the many interpretations that have emerged following publication.

According to other readers and critics, &quot;Q&quot; is a thinly disguised autobiography of Luther Blissett as a subversive, identity-shifting collective phantom. The protagonist has no name (the authors later renamed themselves Wu Ming, which is Chinese for &quot;no name&quot;), is involved in every tumult of the age, incites the people to rebellion, and organizes hoaxes, swindles and mischievous acts.

Both British novelist Stewart Home and American novelist David Liss have interpreted &quot;Q&quot; as an &quot;anti-novel&quot;, although their respective analyses come to different conclusions. While Home&#x27;s review emphasized the social, political and subcultural references embedded in the plot, Liss&#x27; review dismissed the book as unnecessary and self-referential.

Other readers have suggested that &quot;Q&quot; — apart from radicalism, post-modernism, and allegories — is above all an adventure novel, a swashbuckler in the very Italian tradition of Emilio Salgari and other popular feuilleton authors.

In 2018, a reporter for BuzzFeed News suggested that the right-wing &quot;QAnon&quot; conspiracy theory shared many similarities to plot points in the novel.

==Reception==
&quot;Q&quot; was generally well-received among British press. Globally, &quot;Complete Review&quot; saying on the consensus &quot;Moderately enthusiastic&quot;.

==Film adaptation==
Rumours about a potential film adaptation of &quot;Q&quot; have circulated since the mid-2000s. On December 9 2007, the British newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot; published a lengthy interview with Radiohead in which Thom Yorke stated: 
&quot;Oh it&#x27;s fucking ace! But my missus, that&#x27;s her specialist field, so she&#x27;s been explaining it to me all the way through. Medieval church carnage. It&#x27;s mental. I want to get it made into a film. That&#x27;s my next mission.&quot; The interviewer asked: &quot;Using the &quot;In Rainbows&quot; profits?&quot;, to which Yorke replied: &quot;I doubt it. That would cover basically the catering.&quot;

On January 21, 2011, the Italian producer Domenico Procacci optioned &quot;Q&quot; to make a movie and commissioned the screenplay for the film to Giaime Alonge and Alessandro Scippa. Procacci&#x27;s production company, Fandango, was planning a co-production with other countries.

==&quot;Altai&quot;: a &quot;return to &quot;Q&quot; &quot;==

In May 2009 Wu Ming announced that they had almost finished writing a new book, set &quot;in [their debut novel] Q&#x27;s world and historical continuum&quot;. They announced it would be published in Italy in the Fall of 2009. Later on, they revealed that the title would be &quot;Altai&quot; and explained:

<text>Intel Ireland is the Irish subsidiary of the U.S.-based semiconductor giant, Intel. Founded in 1989, the company is one of the largest employers in Ireland.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In the late 1980s, Intel was in talks with IDA Ireland about potentially setting up its European manufacturing operations in Ireland, with other possibilities being Scotland and the Netherlands. By September 1989, Intel had reached an agreement with IDA worth £87 million in grants to set up in Ireland. The subsidiary was registered on as Intel Ireland Limited.

=== Leixlip campus ===
Intel founder Gordon Moore came to Dublin to announce the 2,200 job project setting up in Ireland on . SIPTU were also in talks with the company regarding finalising an exclusive union membership deal. On , Intel submitted an application to Kildare County Council for full planning permission for the development of an “Electrical Systems Manufacturing and Assembly Industry” at the Collinstown Industrial Park in Leixlip, County Kildare.

Intel began hiring employees in early November and officially began operations on at their temporary premises in Palmerstown.

In January 1990, Intel were certain that they were going to go ahead with its $250 million plan of creating a manufacturing plant, including a fabrication plant, at the planned industrial park site in Leixlip. The foundation stone ceremony was held on at the nearby Castletown House. 

By June 1990, they were going forward with the second phase of the construction following the acceptance of its newest computer products in the European market. Construction on the Fab 10 fabrication plant later began in 1991.

Jacobs International Limited, the Irish subsidiary of U.S.-based Jacobs Solutions, were awarded a £100 million contract with Intel to provide architectural, engineering, procurement and construction services at the Leixlip site in April 1991.

On , Intel signed a deal with Amstrad in Hanover to manufacture a range of Amstrad&#x27;s machines due to financial difficulties Amstrad experienced due to the recession. It was felt that this deal would be another boost for Intel&#x27;s facility in Leixlip. 

The manufacturing plant manufactured its first chip in 1993. By October 1993, the company had a total of 1,000 employees and 2,000 by November 1994.

=== Intel Shannon ===
In 2000, Intel opened Intel Shannon, a research facility in Shannon, County Clare, which employs approximately 250 people.

== Fabrication plants ==
The campus at Leixlip is Intel&#x27;s largest manufacturing plant outside of the United States and initially consisted of two semi-conductor wafer fabrication facilities: Fab 10 Ireland Fab Operations (IFO) and also the Fab 24 manufacturing plant which includes Fab 24-2. IFO was a 200mm wafer facility whilst Fab 24 processes 300mm wafers using 65-nanometer and 90-nanometer process technologies. IFO ceased operations and Fab 10 is now classed as Fab 24, along with Fab 14.

=== Fab 10 (IFO) ===
Fab 10 began construction in 1991, and was opened in February 1994 following a total investment of £500 million since commencing operations in 1989. By August 2010, Intel Fab Operations (IFO) had become the first Intel plant to ship 2 billion die. It is also notable as the only Intel facility to achieve the ISO 14001 safety standard for its management of the local environment.

=== Fab 14 ===
Construction for Fab 14 began in October 1995 with the construction contract being won by Joseph Murphy Structural Engineers Ltd (JMSE). In June 1997, Intel sought planning permission for “a two-storey over basement wafer fabrication production extension with roof mounted equipment to existing Fab 14 complex”. In April 1998, Intel received the Forbairt Construction Linkage Award for its extensive use of Irish suppliers as 65% of all goods and services used to design, build and furnish Fab 14 were Irish. Fab 14 officially opened on .

=== Fab 24 and 24-2 ===
Fab 24 was officially opened in June 2004 by then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, and the new facility represented an investment of $2 billion. In April 2005, Intel announced that the one-billionth microchip had been manufactured by the Leixlip-based operation after 12 years in business. Fab 24-2 was opened in June 2006 and was Intel&#x27;s first plant in Europe to use the then advanced 65nm process technology.

=== Fab 34 ===
In 2019, work began on Fab 34 which was key to doubling the company&#x27;s manufacturing space in Ireland and making the way for the production of Intel&#x27;s 4 process technology. Fab 34 officially opened on at a total cost of €17 billion. In June 2024, Intel announced the €10.1 billion sale of a 49% stake in a joint venture related to Fab 34 with Apollo Global Management.

The removal of salmon culverts on the Middle Fork of the Newaukum River were completed in 2019. Part of a $46.2 million statewide project overseen by the Brian Abbott Fish Barrier Removal Board, the elimination of the barriers provides the opportunity for the return of Coho salmon.

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) monitors the river via calibrated &quot;base flow&quot; gauges. Due to reduced waterflow in summer 2023, the USGS could not use its gauge system to compare against historic lows of the water levels of the Newaukum.

==Course==

===Mainstem===
Formed by the confluence of the North and South Forks in Newaukum Prairie, the mainstem Newaukum River flows generally west and north. After , near the city of Chehalis, the Newaukum River empties into the Chehalis River, at Chehalis river mile 75.2.

===Middle Fork===
The Middle Fork Newaukum River, the shortest of the three forks, originates at . It flows southwest into Alpha Prairie. It turns west and flows through hillier terrain before entering the Newaukum Prairie and emptying into the North Fork Newaukum River.

===North Fork===
The North Fork Newaukum River originates in the Cascade Range at . It flows generally west for approximately , entering a broad valley near its confluence with Mitchell Creek, after which it flows south and southwest. In Newaukum Prairie it is joined by the Middle Fork Newaukum River. Shortly below the Middle Fork confluence the North Fork joins the South Fork to form the mainstem Newaukum River.

The cities of Chehalis and Centralia divert part of the North Fork&#x27;s waters for municipal use at river mile 12.5

===South Fork===
The South Fork Newaukum River originates at Newaukum Lake in the Cascade Range, at . It flows generally west. It exits the mountains and enters broad valleys and prairie lands, flowing by the community of Onalaska. The river turns north in Newaukum Prairie and joins the North Fork to form the mainstem Newaukum River.

==Wildlife and biology==
The mainstem river and some of its forks and tributaries support both spring and fall Chinook salmon, Coho salmon, and other fish. The mainstem portion of the river is assigned as a &quot;core summer salmonid habitat&quot;, which grants protections to migratory salmon from human activities on the river when water temperatures rise above .

<text>Benjamin Gratz Brown (May 28, 1826December 13, 1885) was an American politician. He was a U.S. Senator, the 20th Governor of Missouri, and the Liberal Republican and Democratic Party vice presidential candidate in the presidential election of 1872.

Born in Frankfort, Kentucky, Brown established a legal practice in St. Louis, Missouri. Both of his grandfathers, John Brown and Jesse Bledsoe, represented Kentucky in the Senate. After settling in St. Louis, Brown won election to the Missouri House of Representatives. He became an ally of Thomas Hart Benton and Francis Preston Blair Jr. in the struggle for control of the state Democratic Party against pro-slavery forces. As the 1850s progressed, Brown continued to speak against slavery, and he helped found the Missouri Republican Party.

During the Civil War, Brown worked to keep Missouri in the Union. In 1863, he was elected to the Senate as a member of the Radical Union Party. In the Senate, he aligned with the Radical Republicans and opposed many of President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s policies. He was part of a movement that unsuccessfully sought to replace Lincoln as the 1864 Republican nominee. After the war, Brown strongly opposed President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s Reconstruction policies and supported the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau bills.

Brown resigned from the Senate in 1867 but helped found the Liberal Republican Party in 1870. The party chose Brown as its nominee for governor, and he defeated incumbent Republican Governor Joseph W. McClurg. Brown sought the new party&#x27;s 1872 presidential nomination but was defeated by Horace Greeley. After the nomination of Greeley, the 1872 Liberal Republican convention chose Brown as the party&#x27;s vice presidential nominee. Seeking to avoid splitting the vote of opponents to President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s re-election, the 1872 Democratic National Convention subsequently nominated the Liberal Republican ticket. The Republican ticket nonetheless triumphed in the election, as Grant won 55.6% of the popular vote and a majority of the electoral vote. Greeley died after the election but before the electors officially cast their votes, and Brown received some of Greeley&#x27;s electoral votes. After the election, Gratz returned to his law practice and affiliated with the Democratic Party.

==Early life==

Brown was born in 1826 in Frankfort, Kentucky, the son of Judith Ann (Bledsoe) and Mason Brown. He was the grandson of Senators John Brown and Jesse Bledsoe of Kentucky. He graduated from Transylvania University in Lexington in 1845 where he was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity, and from Yale College in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1847.

He studied law, and later settled in St. Louis, Missouri. There he joined his cousin, Francis P. Blair Jr., and Senator Thomas Hart Benton in a struggle against the pro-slavery faction for control of Missouri&#x27;s Democratic Party. He was a correspondent for the Missouri Republican at the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851) and served as the secretary at the treaty negotiations. He married Mary Gunn (1842–1888) in 1858, and together they had six children.

==Political career==

Brown became a member of the Missouri House of Representatives and served there between 1852 and 1858. An able lawyer in St. Louis, Brown made a speech in 1857 against a joint resolution opposing emancipation. The speech marked the beginning of the Free Soil movement in Missouri. He was a leader of the movement. After that, he edited the &quot;Missouri Democrat&quot; between 1854 and 1859. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Missouri in 1857.

On August 26, 1856, he fought a duel on Bloody Island (Mississippi River) with Thomas C. Reynolds (then the St. Louis District Attorney) over the slavery issue. Reynolds was not hurt but Brown was shot in the leg and limped for the rest of his life.

Brown became a founding member of the Republican Party in Missouri. Throughout the 1860s, he and Blair contested control of the state&#x27;s Republican party. He worked to prevent Missouri from seceding from the Union in 1861. After that, he served as an officer in the Union Army during the first half of the Civil War, raising a regiment (the 4th U.S. Reserves) and serving as its colonel. He recruited over 1,100 soldiers for his regiment, many of whom were St. Louis-area German-Americans, a key constituency that Brown courted for his political advantage.

Brown resigned from the Army after he was elected in late 1863 as a Radical Unionist to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the expulsion of Waldo P. Johnson. Brown opposed Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s moderation and objected to the Emancipation Proclamation because it did not free slaves in Missouri and other loyal border states. He was a key figure in the move to replace Lincoln with John C. Frémont in the presidential election of 1864. In the Senate, Brown was chairman of the Public Buildings and Grounds committee and of the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expense. Following Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, Brown was vehemently opposed to new President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s moderate plan of Reconstruction. He also supported the Radical-sponsored Civil Rights Bill and Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau Bill. Brown left the Senate in 1867 because of ill health.

In 1870, dissatisfied with the Missouri Republicans, he joined the new Liberal Republican Party. The party nominated Brown for governor, and he defeated Republican incumbent Joseph W. McClurg. Brown served as the Governor between 1871 and 1873.

==Presidential election of 1872==

Brown was one of the contenders for the Liberal Republican presidential nomination, but lost to newspaper editor Horace Greeley. Brown was the vice presidential candidate under Greeley in the presidential election of 1872 for the Liberal Republican and Democratic parties. Greeley died on November 29 of illness, before the electoral college could vote, and the electoral votes (63 of 66) that were to have been for Greeley were split among four others, including Brown, who received eighteen of those electoral votes. The Republicans, incumbent president Ulysses S. Grant and the vice presidential candidate, U.S. Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, won the election anyway.

Brown returned to his law practice, quit the Republican Party and resumed his ties to the Democrats. He died in Kirkwood, Missouri and is interred there at Oak Hill Cemetery.

<text>BWG Foods UC is an Irish wholesaler and retail grocery franchise operator.

BWG is the second largest wholesaler in Ireland in terms of sales, after Musgrave Group, with sales of over €1.7 billion annually. It used to be owned by a consortium run by Leo Crawford, John O&#x27;Donnell and John Clohessy. In 2015, SPAR&#x27;s franchise in South Africa acquired an 80% stake in BWG for €55 million, in 2021 they gained full ownership of BWG. The company head office is based in Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland.

== History ==
EDL, a wholesale buying group applied to SPAR to operate the symbol in the Republic of Ireland. SPAR rejected this offer citing inadequate warehousing facilities and that the group had too many members in order to operate the symbol efficiently.

In 1963 a group of wholesalers broke from EDL and formed a consortium, P. Barrett and Sons Ltd, D. Tyndall and Sons Ltd of Dublin and McNulty and O&#x27;Reilly Ltd of Bray merged to form Amalgamated Wholesalers Ltd (AWL), Maurice P. Daly Ltd and The Jamaica Banana of Cork merged to form Munster United Merchants Ltd (MUM), and Messrs Looney and Co. Ltd of Limerick, these firms organised the Spar franchise based on the provinces of Leinster, Munster &amp; Connaught. In 1966, a fourth wholesaler, Western Wholesale, joined the consortium securing a National spread for the Spar business.

in 1973, the Brooks-Watson Group (BWG) was formed through the later merger of the 4 SPAR wholesalers in the Republic of Ireland. In 1984 BWG was sold to Irish Distillers. 

In 2000, BWG purchased the Mace franchise area in Munster owned by Vantage Wholesale, merging it with its existing franchise area in Leinster.

As of 2002, BWG was owned by Pernod Ricard who had acquired the business as part of Irish Distillers, but offered it for sale as it was not core to their business. BWG was sold via a management buyout financed by Electra Partners Europe for 220m euro. The current owners bought out Electra in 2006 through a vehicle called Triode, with a value of 390m euro placed on the firm.

BWG bought Tolan&#x27;s Foodservice based in Galway in July 2003, and renamed it &quot;BWG Foodservice&quot;. Also in 2003, BWG sold its Bellevue cash &amp; carry&#x27;s in Edinburgh and Stirling, Scotland in October, 5 years after buying it. The Northern Ireland subsidiary J&amp;J Haslett, which held the franchise for Mace was sold in December 2003 via a management buy out. (Musgrave Group subsequently bought J&amp;J Haslett). The Bargain Booze off-licence chain in the United Kingdom was sold in 2004.

In 2008, BWG bought Mangan Bros Ltd a wholesaler based in Ennis, County Clare. With this purchase BWG took control of Mace franchise throughout Ireland. The business consisted of 8 cash and carries in the West of Ireland, and a distribution centre in Collooney in County Sligo supplying Mace stores. BWG promptly closed the Collooney centre and integrated it into their Ballyshannon facility. Seven Cash &amp; Carry closures follow due to location overlaps and duplication, and all sites are now branded Value Centre.

As of September 2010, the company announced the closure of their warehouse in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, with the business transferring into the centre at Walkinstown, Dublin.

In May 2012 BWG acquired Morris Bros of Convoy Donegal. Morris Bros operate a Distribution Centre that supply Gala stores and independent retailers in the north west of Ireland. In June 2012 a new ambient Distribution Centre opened in Kilcarberry, Dublin with the aim of consolidating distribution of ambient goods to all Spar and Mace stores under one roof, including its Bonded warehouse. The new 240,000 sq ft centre resulted in the closure of the existing centres in Limerick and Walkinstown, and was expected to handle 26 million cases per year. BWG announced a partnership with Donnellys Fruit &amp; Veg in August 2012. This saw a new separate distribution centre for chilled foods set up in Kilshane Cross, Dublin. The centre distributed fruit &amp; veg, meats and other chilled products to all BWG&#x27;s franchise stores nationwide. It affected BWG&#x27;s Central billing business as a result.

in 2018 BWG Bought Midlands Wholesaler, 4 Aces Wholesale, with cash &amp; carry outlets located in Portlaoise, Clonmel &amp; Navan. a condition of sale was that BWG Foods was to become a member of the Gala Retail Wholesale Network. The sale was subject to approval by the Competition &amp; Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), with a number of binding conditions, resulting to the 4 Aces Cash &amp; Carry Network being run separately to BWG&#x27;s Existing Value Centre Business.

This acquisition was followed by further acquisitions of Gala Wholesale Members, Cox&#x27;s Cash &amp; Carry &amp; Mccarricks Bros in 2022 and Tuffys Wholesale in 2023.

== Notable Operations ==

=== Spar ===
It is the master franchise operator for the SPAR, Spar Express and EuroSpar brands in Ireland, with approximately 450 Spar stores. Spar Ireland reported €1.67 billion in retail sales in 2007.
In Ireland Spar operates in-store franchises for Tim Hortons coffee, Insomnia Coffee Company, Kitsu noodles and Treehouse smoothies among others.

In the south-west of England BWG also own Appleby Westward Foods. This is a small regional SPAR wholesaler based in Saltash, Cornwall.

=== Mace ===
BWG holds the master franchise for the Mace chain of 230 stores in Ireland. Maxol and Mace also have an exclusive deal that sees most Maxol owned forecourt shops branded Mace.

===Other operations===
Newhill, BWG&#x27;s retail subsidiary owns over 100 stores which are leased/rented to operators for an agreed percentage of turnover. The stores trade as Spar and Mace.

=== BWG Foodservice ===
BWG Foodservice is a division which offers a full frozen/chill/ambient range aimed at the foodservice channel. The business was born from the purchase of Tolan foodservice and the main depot is still at the same site in Galway. A new site was opened at North Road, Dublin in 2007, and later a third in Cork. These sites are also Value Centres.

=== Value Centre ===
BWG owns Ireland&#x27;s largest Cash &amp; Carry chain, Value Centre, which has 22 branches nationwide.

Value Centre offer XL to its Value Centre customers as a franchise option. It is a more cost-effective way for retailers who are not suited to a full brand offering, like Spar, to get the benefits of franchise membership. They still receive the benefit of Central billing without the expense or requirements of larger franchises. Competitors include Gala Express operated by Stonehouse Wholesale, and Daytoday operated by Musgrave.

=== 4 Aces Wholesale/Better Deal ===
Acquired by BWG Foods in 2018, the business forms part of the BWG Wholesale Division, and roughly 40 Gala in the Midlands, as well as independent retailers, food service, and bar trade customers

<doc id="741914" wikidata="Q918520" url="?curid=741914" title="Harry Dexter White">
<text>Harry Dexter White (October 29, 1892 – August 16, 1948) was a senior U.S. Treasury department official. Working closely with the Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr., he helped set American financial policy toward the Allies of World War II. He was later accused of espionage by passing information to the Soviet Union, an allegation which was confirmed after his death.

He was a senior American official at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference that established the postwar economic order. He dominated the conference, and his vision of post-war financial institutions mostly prevailed over those of John Maynard Keynes, the British representative who was the other main founder. Through Bretton Woods, White was a major architect of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.

White was accused in 1948 of spying for the Soviet Union, which he adamantly denied. He was never a Communist party member, but he had frequent contacts with Soviet officials as part of his duties at the Treasury. That he passed sensitive and classified documents on to people he knew were agents of the Soviet Union has been confirmed, although hard evidence only came over time via the decoded and finally declassified Soviet cables intercepted in the Venona Project, plus the opening of the Soviet archives in the 1990s.

==Background==

Harry Dexter White was born on October 29, 1892, in Boston, Massachusetts, the seventh and youngest child of Jewish Lithuanian immigrants, Jacob Weissnovitz (or Weit) and Sarah Magilewski, who had settled in the US in the 1880s. In 1917, he enlisted in the U.S. Army, and was commissioned as a First Lieutenant and served in France as head of Company H of the 302nd Infantry until the end of World War I. Aside from one term at Massachusetts Agricultural College (1911–12), he did not begin his university studies until age 29, first at Columbia University where he studied government starting from 1922; then, after three terms there, at Stanford University, where he earned bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in economics; and finally at Harvard University, where he taught for four years while studying for his Ph.D., which he completed in 1932 at 40 years of age. White then taught for two years at Lawrence College in Appleton, Wisconsin. His PhD dissertation won the David A. Wells Prize granted annually by the Harvard University Department of Economics. Harvard University Press published his Ph.D. thesis in 1933, as &quot;The French International Accounts, 1880–1913&quot;.

==Treasury Department==

In 1934, Jacob Viner, an economist working at the Treasury Department, offered White a position at the Treasury, which he accepted. Viner would receive an honorary degree from Lawrence University, where White taught before joining the Treasury, in 1941. White became increasingly important in monetary matters, and was a top advisor to Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr., especially on international financial affairs dealing with China, France, Great Britain, Japan, Latin America, and the Soviet Union. In 1938, Morgenthau created a new division—the Division of Monetary Research—and promoted White to be its director. When the United States entered World War II in 1941, Morgenthau promoted White again, naming him Assistant to the Secretary. The post of Assistant Secretary, the most senior economist position in the Treasury, finally opened up in 1945, and Morgenthau promptly nominated White to fill it. White left the Treasury in 1946 to become the U.S. Executive Director at the newly established International Monetary Fund.

===Japan policy===

In November 1941, White sent a memorandum to Morgenthau that was widely circulated and influenced State Department planning. White called for a comprehensive peaceful solution of rapidly escalating tensions between the United States and Japan, calling for major concessions on both sides. Langer and Gleason report that White&#x27;s proposals were totally rewritten by the State Department and that the American key demand had been formulated long before White. It was an insistence on Japanese withdrawal from China, which Japan totally refused to consider. The complex negotiations at the top ranks of the US government, and its key allies of Britain and China, took place in late November 1941 with no further input from White or Morgenthau. White&#x27;s proposals were never presented to Japan. Some historians have argued, however, that White manipulated Morgenthau and Roosevelt to provoke war with Japan in order to protect Stalin&#x27;s Far Eastern front.

After the U.S. entered the war in December 1941, Secretary Morgenthau appointed White to act as liaison between the Treasury and the State Department on all matters bearing on foreign relations. He was also made responsible for the Exchange Stabilization Fund. White eventually came to be in charge of wartime international matters for the Treasury, with access to extensive confidential information about the economic situation of the US and its wartime allies. He passed numerous secret documents to men he knew were Soviet spies.

White was a dedicated internationalist, and his energies were directed at continuing the Grand Alliance with the USSR and maintaining peace through trade. He believed that powerful, multilateral institutions could avoid the mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles and prevent another worldwide depression. As head of the independently funded Office of Monetary Research, White was able to hire staff without the normal civil service regulations or background enquiries. He probably was unaware that several of his hires were spies for the USSR.

===Morgenthau Plan===

According to Henry Morgenthau&#x27;s son, White was the principal architect behind the Morgenthau Plan, designed to permanently weaken Germany&#x27;s military capabilities. The Morgenthau postwar plan, as authored by White, was to take all industry out of Germany, eliminate its armed forces, and convert the country into an agricultural community, in the process eliminating most of Germany&#x27;s economy and its ability to start another war.
A version of the plan, limited to turning Germany into &quot;a country primarily agricultural and pastoral in its character&quot;, was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill at the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944. However, someone in White&#x27;s department with access to details of the plan leaked it to the press, and White himself provided an advance copy to Soviet intelligence. Public protests forced Roosevelt to publicly and partially pull back. The Nazis and Joseph Goebbels used the Morgenthau Plan as a propaganda coup to encourage their troops and citizens to fight on. General Omar Bradley, among others, noticed &quot;a near-miraculous revitalization of the German army.&quot; In the end Morgenthau still did manage to influence the resulting occupation policy.

===Bretton Woods Conference===

White was the senior American official at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference, and reportedly dominated the conference and imposed his vision over the objections of John Maynard Keynes, the British representative. Numerous economic historians have concluded that White and the powerful U.S. delegation were wrong in dismissing Keynes&#x27;s innovative proposal for a new international unit of currency (the &quot;Bancor&quot;) made up of foreign exchange reserves held by central banks. Benn Steil, in 2013, argued that since 1971, experts have been disillusioned with the 1944 framework. Eric Helleiner, in 2014, argued that the main goal of the United States was to promote international development as an investment in peace, to open the world for cheap imports, and to create new markets for American exports. He argues that policy-makers and analysts from the Southern hemisphere increasingly denounced the Bretton Woods system as &quot;a Northern-dominated arrangement that was ill-suited to their state-led development strategies.&quot; After the war, White was closely involved with setting up what were called the Bretton Woods institutions—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. These institutions were intended to prevent some of the economic problems that had occurred after World War I. As late as November 1945, White continued to argue for improved relations with the Soviet Union. White later became a director and U.S. representative of the IMF. On June 19, 1947, White abruptly resigned from the International Monetary Fund, vacating his office the same day.

==Accusations of espionage==

===Chambers accusations 1939, 1945, 1948===
On September 2, 1939, Assistant Secretary of State and Roosevelt&#x27;s adviser on internal security Adolf Berle had a meeting, arranged by journalist Isaac Don Levine, with defecting Soviet agent Whittaker Chambers. In his notes of that meeting, written later that night, Levine listed a series of names, including a &quot;Mr. White&quot;. Berle&#x27;s notes of the meeting contain no mention of White. Berle drafted a 4-page memorandum on the information which he then passed to the President, who dismissed the idea of espionage rings in his administration as &#x27;absurd&#x27;. The director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, as late as 1942, also dismissed Chambers&#x27; revelations as &#x27;history, hypothesis, or deduction.&#x27;

On March 20, 1945, State Department security officer Raymond Murphy interviewed Chambers. His notes record that Chambers identified White as &quot;a member at large but rather timid&quot;, who had brought various members of the American communist underground into the Treasury.

In Spring 1948, Truman aide Stephen J. Spingarn questioned Whittaker Chambers, an admitted former Soviet espionage agent, about Harry Dexter White: &quot;Chambers ... told me that he didn&#x27;t believe Harry White was a Communist; he believed that he was a man who thought he was smarter than the Communists, and he could use them, but really they used him.&quot; Chambers subsequently testified on August 3, 1948, to his association with White in the Communist underground secret apparatus up to 1938. Chambers produced documents he had saved from his days as a courier for the Soviets&#x27; American spy-ring. Among these was a handwritten memorandum that he testified White had given him. The Treasury Department identified this document as containing highly confidential material from the State Department, while the FBI Laboratory established that it was written in White&#x27;s handwriting. Chambers stated, however, that White was the least productive of his contacts. Chambers said of White, &quot;His motives always baffled me&quot; (a point later underscored by grandson David Chambers).

===Bentley accusations 1945, 1948, 1953===

On November 7, 1945, defecting Soviet espionage courier Elizabeth Bentley told investigators of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that in late 1942 or early 1943 she learned from Soviet spies Nathan Gregory Silvermaster and Ludwig Ullmann that one source of the government documents they were photographing and passing on to her and NKVD spymaster Jacob Golos was Harry Dexter White.

The next day, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover sent a hand-delivered letter to Truman&#x27;s Military Aide, Gen. Harry Vaughan, at the White House, reporting information that &quot;a number of persons employed by the government of the United States have been furnishing data and information to persons outside the Federal Government, who are in turn transmitting this information to espionage agents of the Soviet government.&quot; The letter listed a dozen Bentley suspects, the second of whom was Harry Dexter White.

The FBI summarized the Bentley information and in its follow-up investigation on the suspects she named, again including White, in a report entitled &#x27;Soviet Espionage in the United States&#x27;, which was sent to the White House, the Attorney General and the State Department on December 4, 1945. Six weeks later, on January 23, 1946, Truman nominated White as U.S. Director of the International Monetary Fund. The FBI responded with a 28-page memo specifically on White and his contacts, received by the White House on February 4, 1946. White&#x27;s nomination was approved by the Senate, acting in ignorance of the allegations against White, on February 6, 1946.

(Six years later, Truman would testify that White had been &quot;separated from the Government service promptly&quot; upon receipt of this information—first from the Treasury, and then from the IMF. In fact, White was still at the IMF on June 19, 1947—more than two years after the FBI had alerted the White House about him—when he abruptly resigned (vacating his office the same day), after Attorney General Tom Clark ordered a Federal grand jury investigation of the Bentley charges.)

On July 31, 1948, Bentley told the House Committee on Un-American Activities that White had been involved in espionage activities on behalf of the Soviet Union during World War II, and had passed sensitive Treasury documents to Soviet agents. Bentley said White&#x27;s colleagues passed information to her from him. In her 1953 testimony Bentley said that White was responsible for passing Treasury plates for printing Allied military marks in occupied Germany to the Soviets, who thereupon printed currency with abandon, sparking a black market and serious inflation throughout the occupied country, costing the U.S. a quarter of a billion dollars. However the alternative explanation is that Treasury officials feared that denying Soviet use of the plates in their occupation sector would endanger postwar cooperation.

Bentley wrote in her 1951 autobiography that she had been &quot;able through Harry Dexter White to arrange that the United States Treasury Department turn the actual printing plates over to the Russians&quot;. Bentley had not previously mentioned this to the FBI or to any of the committees, grand juries or prosecutors before whom she had testified earlier, and there was no evidence at the time that Bentley had any role in this transfer. Some questioned Harry Dexter White&#x27;s role in it. In her 1953 testimony before Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s Senate subcommittee, she elaborated, testifying that she was following instructions from NKVD New York &quot;rezident&quot; Iskhak Abdulovich Akhmerov (who operated under the cover name &quot;Bill&quot;) to pass word through Ludwig Ullmann and Nathan Gregory Silvermaster for White to &quot;put the pressure on for the delivery of the plates to Russia&quot;. This is the only case in which Bentley biographer Kathryn Olmsted concluded that Bentley was lying about her role, citing historian Bruce Craig&#x27;s conclusion that &quot;the whole &#x27;scheme&#x27; was a complete fabrication&quot;. However, Bentley&#x27;s testimony would later be corroborated in dramatic fashion by a memorandum found in Soviet archives after half a century. In it, Gaik Ovakimian, head of the American desk of the NKVD (for which Bentley worked), cites a report from New York (where Bentley was based) from April 14, 1944 (when Bentley was running the Silvermaster group) reporting that, &quot;following our instructions&quot; via Silvermaster, White had obtained &quot;the positive decision of the Treasury Department to provide the Soviet side with the plates for engraving German occupation marks&quot;.

==Personal life ==

In 1918, White married Anne Terry. They had two daughters, Ruth (May 11, 1926 - December 28, 2009) and Joan (March 12, 1929 - September 9, 2012).

On August 13, 1948, White testified before HUAC and denied being a communist. After he finished testifying, he had a heart attack. He left Washington for a rest on his Fitzwilliam, New Hampshire farm. He had just arrived when he had another heart attack. Two days later, on August 16, 1948, he died, age 55. Spurious allegations later made it look as if an overdose of digoxin was the cause of death.

===Accusations by Jenner and McCarthy 1953===

Senator William Jenner&#x27;s Interlocking Subversion in Government Departments Investigation by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS) looked extensively into the problem of unauthorized and uncontrolled powers exercised by non-elected officials, specifically White. Part of its report looked into the implementation of Roosevelt administration policy in China and was published as the &quot;Morgenthau Diary (China).&quot; The report stated: The committee also heard testimony by Henry Morgenthau&#x27;s speechwriter, Jonathan Mitchell, that White had tried to persuade him that the Soviets had developed a system that would supplant capitalism and Christianity.

In 1953, Senator Joseph McCarthy and Eisenhower administration Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. revealed that the FBI had warned the Truman administration about White before the President appointed him to the IMF. Brownell made public the FBI&#x27;s November 8, 1945, letter to the White House warning about White and others, and revealed that the White House had received the FBI report on &quot;Soviet Espionage in the United States,&quot; including the White case, six weeks before Truman nominated White to the IMF.

Although he does not dispute that the FBI sent these and other warnings to Truman, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote in his introduction to the 1997 Moynihan Commission report on government secrecy that Truman was never informed of Venona. In support of this, he cited a statement from the official NSA/CIA history of Venona that &quot;no definitive evidence has emerged to show&quot; that Truman was informed of Venona.

===Venona project===

NSA cryptographers identified Harry Dexter White as the source denoted in the Venona decrypts at various times under the code names &quot;Lawyer&quot;, &quot;Richard&quot;, and &quot;Jurist&quot;. Two years after his death, in a memorandum dated October 15, 1950, White was positively identified by the FBI, through evidence gathered by the Venona project, as a Soviet source, code named &quot;Jurist&quot;.
Years later, the Justice Department publicly disclosed the existence of the Venona project which deciphered Soviet cable traffic naming White as &quot;Jurist&quot;, a Soviet intelligence source. As reported in the FBI Memorandum on White: You have previously been advised of information obtained from [Venona] regarding Jurist, who was active during 1944. According to the previous information received from [Venona] regarding Jurist, during April, 1944, he had reported on conversations between the then Secretary of State Hull and Vice President Wallace. He also reported on Wallace&#x27;s proposed trip to China. On August 5, 1944, he reported to the Soviets that he was confident of President Roosevelt&#x27;s victory in the coming elections unless there was a huge military failure. He also reported that Truman&#x27;s nomination as Vice President was calculated to secure the vote of the conservative wing of the Democratic Party. It was also reported that Jurist was willing for any self-sacrifice in behalf of the KGB but was afraid that his activities, if exposed, might lead to a political scandal and have an effect on the elections. This codename was confirmed by the notes of KGB archivist Vasili Nikitich Mitrokhin, in which six key Soviet agents are named. Harry Dexter White is listed as being first &quot;KASSIR&quot; and later &quot;JURIST&quot;.

Another example of White acting as an agent of influence for the Soviet Union was his obstruction of a proposed $200 million loan to Nationalist China in 1943, which he had been officially instructed to execute, at a time when inflation was spiraling out of control.

Other Venona decrypts revealed further damaging evidence against White, including White&#x27;s suggestions on how to meet and pass information on to his Soviet handler. Venona Document #71 contains decryptions of White&#x27;s discussions on being paid for his work for the Soviet Union.

In 1997, the bipartisan Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy, chaired by Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, stated in its findings, &quot;The complicity of Alger Hiss of the State Department seems settled. As does that of Harry Dexter White of the Treasury Department.&quot;

Further evidence of White&#x27;s complicity as a Soviet agent was gleaned from Soviet archives and former KGB operative Alexander Vassiliev. In a book by Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev, &quot;The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America — the Stalin Era&quot;, Vassiliev, a former Soviet journalist and KGB operative, reviewed Soviet archives dealing with White&#x27;s actions on behalf of the Soviet Union. White assisted Harold Glasser, a Treasury executive and NKVD spy, &quot;in obtaining posts and promotions at Treasury while aware of his Communist ties&quot;. Because of White&#x27;s backing, Glasser survived an FBI background check. In December 1941 the Secret Service forwarded a report to Harry White indicating that it had evidence Glasser was involved in Communist activities. White never acted on the report. Glasser continued to serve in the Treasury Department, and soon began recruiting other agents and preparing briefing reports on Treasury personnel and other potential espionage agents for the NKVD. After America became involved in World War II, Glasser received appointments to several higher-level positions in the government on White&#x27;s approval.

According to Soviet archives, White&#x27;s other KGB code names were &quot;Richard&quot;, and &quot;Reed&quot;. In order to protect their source, Soviet intelligence repeatedly changed White&#x27;s code name.

===Assessments of Soviet involvement===

In 2000, Robert Skidelsky, in reviewing the evidence, concludes: A combination of naivety, superficiality and supreme confidence in his own judgment — together with his background — explains the course of action White took. There is no question of treachery, in the accepted sense of betraying one&#x27;s country&#x27;s secrets to an enemy. But there can be no doubt that, in passing classified information to the Soviets, White knew he was betraying his trust, even if he did not thereby think he was betraying his country. In 2004, Stephen Schlesinger wrote, &quot;Among historians, the verdict about White is still unresolved, but many incline toward the view that he wanted to help the Russians but did not regard the actions he took as constituting espionage.&quot;

In 2012, Bruce Craig wrote: Taken individually, one could argue that some of the documents indicate that White may have not always have been aware that his information was being passed on to Moscow, but taken collectively, [Andrew] Vassiliev&#x27;s documentation leaves little wiggle room for White&#x27;s defenders to continue to assert that he was not involved in an activity that, at least by present day legal standards, constitute espionage.

In 2012, David Chambers wrote, &quot;Perhaps White had ends of his own, too... Perhaps he used his position to foster the Soviet Union — then a new, budding American ally, recognized only in 1933 — beyond New Deal policy.&quot;

In 2013, Benn Steil wrote: White almost certainly, and over many years, gave confidential and classified U.S. government information–in original, transcribed, and oral form–to individuals whom he knew would ultimately transmit it to the Soviet government ... Yet the economics White advocated were hardly Marxist. They were by this time what would be described as thoroughly Keynesian ... As for White&#x27;s domestic politics, these were mainstream New Deal progressive, and there is no evidence that he admired communism as a political ideology. It is this chasm between what is known publicly of White&#x27;s economic and political views, on the one hand, and his clandestine behavior on behalf of the Soviets, on the other, that accounts for the plethora of unpersuasive profiles of the man that have emerged. White&#x27;s daughters steadfastly maintained his innocence. In 1990, they stated, &quot;Despite years of close surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which included shadowing and wiretaps, the evidence produced against White never consisted of anything more than the unsubstantiated allegations of two F.B.I. informers unknown to the accused (including Time magazine&#x27;s own Whittaker Chambers).&quot; In 1998, daughter Joan White Pinkham wrote on behalf of her sister Ruth White Levitan and herself, &quot;Nevertheless, as the daughters of a brilliant economist who served his country loyally and with distinction, my sister and I remain confident that, in the words of Coventry Patmore, &#x27;The truth is great, and shall prevail, / When none cares whether it prevail or not&#x27;.&quot; In 2012, Joan White Pinkam wrote, &quot;I write to protest that in Benn Steil’s April 9 Op-Ed article, &quot;Banker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,&quot; old allegations of espionage against my father, Harry Dexter White, are once again repeated as fact. In response to the 2012 statement, Whittaker Chambers&#x27; grandson, David Chambers, wrote: Ms. Pinkham does well to stand by her father. Full proof of White&#x27;s doings may never surface. Even if they should, one cannot deny that he helped better the financial system, towards a better world. His achievements remain standing at the U.S. Treasury, Bretton Woods, and the IMF. So does his American creed before HUAC. In contrast, Whittaker Chambers tried at best to neutralize dupes of Stalin-ized communism—long after Stalin had started liquidating every conceivable enemy. (But that does not cancel out Chambers&#x27;s insight into White.)

<text>Calaveras Big Trees State Park is a state park of California, United States, preserving two groves of giant sequoia trees. Located 4 miles (6.4 km) northeast of Arnold, California in the middle elevations of the Sierra Nevada, it has been a major tourist attraction since 1852, when the existence of the trees was first widely reported. Two famous exhibition trees, the Discovery Tree and the Mother of the Forest, were felled for display. It is also considered the longest continuously operated tourist attraction in California.

==History==
===Early history===

The giant sequoia was well known to Native American tribes living in its area. Native American names for the species include &quot;Wawona&quot;, &quot;toos-pung-ish&quot; and &quot;hea-mi-within&quot;, the latter two in the language of the Tule River Tribe.

The first reference to the giant sequoias of Calaveras Big Trees by Europeans is in 1833, in the diary of the explorer J. K. Leonard; the reference does not mention any specific locality, but his route would have taken him through the Calaveras Grove. This discovery was not publicized. The next European to see the trees was John M. Wooster, who carved his initials in the bark of the &#x27;Hercules&#x27; tree in the Calaveras Grove in 1850; again, this received no publicity. Much more publicity was given to Augustus T. Dowd at the North Grove in 1852, and this is commonly cited as the discovery of both the grove and the species as a whole.

The &quot;Discovery Tree&quot; was noted by Augustus T. Dowd in 1852 and felled in 1853, leaving a giant stump and a section of trunk showing the holes made by the augers used to fell it. It measured in diameter at its base and was determined by ring count to be 1,244 years old when felled. A section of the trunk was toured with little fanfare while the stump was later turned into a dance floor. John Muir wrote an essay titled &quot;The Vandals Then Danced Upon the Stump!&quot; to criticize the felling of the tree.
In 1854, a second tree named the &quot;Mother of the Forest&quot; was stripped of its bark in 1854, to be reassembled at exhibitions. This mortally wounded the tree, since outer layer of protective bark was removed. The tree didn&#x27;t survive long after, having shed its entire canopy by 1861. In 1908, with the tree unprotected by its fire resistant bark, a fire swept through the area and burned away much of what was left of the tree, leaving a fire-blackened snag.
The forest is also home to what remains of the &quot;Father of the Forest&quot;, an ancient and exceedingly enormous giant sequoia which fell centuries ago, and its remains are still present in the park. Reportedly, the tree was 435 ft high with a 110 ft circumference- a &quot;giant of giants&quot;.

In early 1880s, a tunnel was cut through the compartments by a private land owner at the request of James Sperry, founder of the Murphys Hotel, so that tourists could pass through it. The tree was chosen in part because of the large forest fire scar. The Pioneer Cabin Tree, as it was soon called, emulated the tunnel carved into Yosemite&#x27;s Wawona Tree, and was intended to compete with it for tourists.

===Preservation===
Along with the 1850s exhibitions, the destruction of the big trees was met with public outcry. In 1864, on introducing the bill that would become the Yosemite Grant, senator John Conness opined that even after people had seen the physical evidence of the Discovery Tree and the Mother of the Forest, they still did not believe the trees were genuine, and that the areas they were from should be protected. This did not guarantee any legal protection for the trees of Calaveras Grove.

By the turn of the century the land was owned by several lumber companies, with plans to cut the remaining trees down, as sequoia and giant sequoia with their thick trunks were seen as great sources of lumber at the time. This again caused a chorus of public outcry by locals and conservationists, and the area continued to be treated as a tourist attraction. Parcels of land that would later become the state park and nearby national park were optioned by lumberman Robert P. Whiteside in January 1900, with the intention of logging. A protracted battle to preserve the trees was launched by Laura Lyon White and the California Club. Legislation in 1900 and 1909 authorized the federal government to purchase the property, but Whiteside refused to sell the land at the offered price, preferring its higher valuation as parkland. It was not until 1931 that Whiteside&#x27;s family began to divest the property, beginning with the North Grove.

The Yosemite protection was gradually extended to most sequoias, and Calaveras Grove was joined to California State Parks in 1931. According to John Muir the forest protected by the park is: &quot;A flowering glade in the very heart of the woods, forming a fine center for the student, and a delicious resting place for the weary.&quot;
Over the years other parcels of mixed conifer forests, including the much larger South Calaveras Grove of Giant Sequoias (purchased in 1954 for US$2.8 million, equivalent to US $ in dollars), have been added to the park to bring the total area to over . The North Grove contains about 100 mature giant sequoias; the South Grove, about 1,000. The state park now encompasses in Calaveras and Tuolumne counties.

===Fire management===
The importance of fire to giant sequoias cannot be overstated. Other than the change of seasons, fire is the most recurrent and critical process in determining the life history of this species. Tree ring records from giant sequoias show that frequent surface fires were the typical pattern of fire occurrence over the past 2,000 years. But this pattern changed after about 1860, when fire frequency declined sharply. This decline in regional fire was probably a result of decrease in fires set by Native Americans, followed by fire suppression by government agencies.

The state provided $7 million in 2022 from the Wildfire and Forest Resiliency Program to spend over five years, &quot;to make our forest resilient when a big fire comes through&quot;. A prescribed burn was conducted by park crews on about of the North Grove in late October through early November.

==Attractions==
The North Grove includes several noteworthy giant sequoias:
*Discovery Tree: the stump of what was once the largest tree of the park.
*Mother of the Forest: a fire-blackened snag is all that remains of the second largest tree of the park.
*Pioneer Cabin Tree: a giant sequoia tree that collapsed during a storm on January 8, 2017; it was one of only two living giant sequoia tunnel trees still standing (the other being the California Tunnel Tree of Mariposa Grove).
*Empire State: the largest tree of the North Grove, which measures at ground level and at above ground.

The South Grove also included several noteworthy giant sequoias:
*Louis Agassiz: the largest living tree of the Calaveras groves measuring tall and more than in diameter above ground. It is the 37th largest giant sequoia in the world, and could be considered either the 36th or 35th largest depending on how badly Ishi Giant and Black Mountain Beauty have atrophied following devastating wildfires in 2015 and 2017, respectively.
*Palace Hotel Tree: the second largest living tree of the Calaveras groves; features a large deep burn scar at its base that one can walk into. This tree has nails burned into its inner trunk by past travelers.

Other attractions of Calaveras Big Trees include the Stanislaus River, Beaver Creek, the Lava Bluff Trail, and Bradley Trail.

==Activities==
The park houses two main campgrounds with a total of 129 campsites, six picnic areas and hundreds of miles of established trails.

Other activities include cross-country skiing, evening ranger talks, numerous interpretive programs, environmental educational programs, junior ranger programs, hiking, mountain biking, bird watching and summer school activities for school children. Dogs are allowed on leash in developed areas like picnic sites, campgrounds, roads and fire roads (dirt). Dogs are not allowed on the designated trails, nor in the woods in general.

==Access==

The park is open year-round. The main road through the park is closed during the winter season. The North Grove Area is easily accessible during the winter season. There are no public transportation options to the park. The closest bus stop is the Arnold Public Library in Arnold, California. The park is accessible via Upper Moran road at gate 15. There is no public parking so the access is used by foot, bicycle, snowshoe or cross-country ski.

<text>Peter Lawrence Buck (born December 6, 1956) is an American musician and songwriter. He was a co-founder and the lead guitarist of the alternative rock band R.E.M. He also plays the banjo and mandolin on several R.E.M. songs. Throughout his career with R.E.M. (1980–2011), as well as during his subsequent solo career, Buck has also been at various times an official member of numerous &#x27;side project&#x27; groups. These groups included Arthur Buck (with Joseph Arthur), Hindu Love Gods, The Minus 5, Tuatara, The Baseball Project, Robyn Hitchcock and the Venus 3, Tired Pony, The No-Ones, and Filthy Friends, each of which have released at least one full-length studio album. Additionally, the experimental combo Slow Music (which also features Fred Chalenor, Hector Zazou, Matt Chamberlain, Robert Fripp, and Bill Rieflin) have released an official live concert CD. Another side project group called Full Time Men released an EP while Buck was a member. As well, ad hoc &quot;supergroups&quot; Bingo Hand Job (Billy Bragg and R.E.M.), Musical Kings (Michelle Malone, Peter Buck, John Keane) and Nigel &amp; The Crosses (Robyn Hitchcock, Peter Buck, Glenn Tilbrook and others) have each commercially released one track.

Richard M. Nixon, a band Buck founded in 2012 to support the release of his solo album with live gigs, has never issued an official recording. Richard M. Nixon consisted of Buck, Scott McCaughey and Bill Rieflin, the same three musicians who comprise The Venus 3.

Buck also has a career as a record producer including releases by Uncle Tupelo, Vigilantes of Love, Dreams So Real, The Fleshtones, The Feelies, and The Jayhawks, as well as a session musician (for the likes of The Replacements, Billy Bragg, Decemberists and Eels).

==Early life==
Peter Lawrence Buck was born on December 6, 1956, in Berkeley, California, to Peter and Violet Buck. After spending time in Los Angeles and San Francisco, the Buck family moved, via Roswell, Georgia, to Atlanta. After graduating with honors from Crestwood High School in 1975, Buck attended Emory University and joined Delta Tau Delta fraternity. He eventually dropped out of Emory. Buck moved to Athens, Georgia, and attended the University of Georgia as well. While in Athens, Buck worked at the Wuxtry Records store, where he met future bandmate Michael Stipe as well as R.E.M.&#x27;s future manager, Bertis Downs.

==Music==

Buck&#x27;s style of guitar playing is simple and yet distinctive. He makes wide use of open strings while chording to create chiming and memorable pop melodies. His sound, especially on mid-period R.E.M. albums that saw the band break through to international popularity, has been associated with Rickenbacker guitars, particularly a Jetglo (black) model 360. He has also used a wide variety of other instruments as the group continued to experiment and develop. On some more recent R.E.M. releases prior to &quot;Accelerate&quot; (2008), his guitar parts have been less prominent.

&quot;When Peter plays guitar, there&#x27;s a strong sense of &quot;fuck off&quot; that comes from his side of the stage. And you feel that he wants to be in a band because he likes what they do... but that&#x27;s all,&quot; explained U2&#x27;s lead singer Bono in 2003. &quot;And it&#x27;s almost like performing and having to deal with all of that is a bit of a compromise for him, so just fuck off. And I like that energy a little bit, and that gives them their aggression.&quot;

Buck has produced many bands, including Uncle Tupelo, Dreams So Real, Drivin N Cryin, The Fleshtones, Charlie Pickett, and The Feelies. Buck also has made contributions on many other musicians&#x27; albums, including The Replacements, Billy Bragg, The Decemberists, Robyn Hitchcock, and several Eels albums.

Peter, Mike Mills, Bill Berry and Warren Zevon recorded an album under the band name Hindu Love Gods, while the R.E.M. bandmates and Zevon were recording tracks for Zevon&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Sentimental Hygiene&quot;. Hindu Love Gods is one of many names the members of R.E.M. have used performing around the Athens area. Buck also continued to play live locally with the Normaltown Flyers, performing country and rock standards in local bars. 

The three instrumentalists from R.E.M. all performed on Nikki Sudden&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;The Jewel Thief&quot;, including the single &quot;I Belong to You&quot;.

Buck also coproduced the 1992 Vigilantes of Love album, &quot;Killing Floor&quot;, with songwriter Mark Heard. He co-wrote, produced, and performed on Mark Eitzel&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;West&quot;. He recorded an EP with Keith Streng of The Fleshtones as Full Time Men in 1985, and along with R.E.M. sideman Scott McCaughey has been a partner in The Minus 5 and a member of the instrumental band Tuatara. Additionally, In October 2005, he joined R.E.M. studio drummer Bill Rieflin, King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp and three others in forming an improvisational performance band called Slow Music. His voice can be heard on one R.E.M. song: &quot;I Walked with a Zombie&quot; from the Roky Erickson tribute album &quot;Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye&quot;. In 2006, Buck toured with Robyn Hitchcock, McCaughey, and Rieflin as lead guitarist for Robyn Hitchcock and the Venus 3 in the wake of the band&#x27;s first release, &quot;Olé! Tarantula&quot;. In 2008, after McCaughey and Steve Wynn decided to work together, the duo asked Buck to be the bass player in their new band, The Baseball Project, along with drummer Linda Pitmon.

Buck has contributed liner notes to compilations, reissues, and special editions, both of R.E.M.&#x27;s own material (the best-of compilations &quot;Eponymous&quot; and &quot;In Time&quot;, the rarities, B-sides and out-takes collection &quot;Dead Letter Office&quot;, and the special edition of &quot;New Adventures in Hi-Fi&quot;) and of other artists&#x27; work (such as The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Love You&quot;).
On September 9, 2008, immediately following the band&#x27;s concert in Helsinki, Buck&#x27;s signature Rickenbacker guitar, used live and in the studio since &quot;Chronic Town&quot; in 1982, was stolen from the stage. It was returned on September 18, 2008, by an anonymous source.

In March 2012, six months after R.E.M.&#x27;s September 2011 dissolution, Buck, now signed to Mississippi Records, announced intentions of working on a solo album, backed by singer-songwriter Joseph Arthur. The first track from the self-titled solo album, &quot;10 Million BC,&quot; was released via SoundCloud on June 21, 2012. His eponymous first album was released later that same year.

In the final days of 2013, Buck announced he would be releasing his second solo album soon. The new project, titled &quot;I Am Back to Blow Your Mind Once Again&quot;, was released on February 18, 2014, again on vinyl only.

In 2015, Buck released his third solo album, &quot;Warzone Earth&quot;, under Little Axe Records.

In April 2017, Buck released the first single &quot;Any Kind of Crowd&quot; from his latest collaborative project with Filthy Friends, a super group with long time associates Scott McCaughey, Bill Rieflin, Kurt Bloch and Corin Tucker of Sleater-Kinney. The same month also saw another new release with Buck and McCaughey teaming up with Frode Strømstad and Arne Kjelsrud Mathisen of Norwegian band I Was A King to form the group The No Ones. The first song from their Sun Station EP was released, with the EP set to follow later in the year.

Arthur Buck, a side project with singer-songwriter Joseph Arthur in which Buck and Arthur share songwriting duties, released their eponymous debut album in June 2018. The following year, the Luke Haines collaboration &quot;Beat Poetry for Survivalists&quot; was released.

==Personal life==
Buck has been married three times and is twice divorced. He was first married to Barrie Greene, the owner of Athens&#x27; 40 Watt Club. He and Greene married in 1987 and divorced in 1994. 

He has twin daughters, born in May 1994, with Stephanie Dorgan, the owner of Seattle&#x27;s Crocodile Cafe music club. Buck and Dorgan married in January 1995 while in Perth, Australia, during R.E.M.&#x27;s Monster World Tour. The couple separated in 2006, and Dorgan sued Buck for divorce in 2007. During his marriage to Dorgan, Buck became a partner in Crocodile Cafe and often played there with his other band, The Minus 5. 

Buck married his third wife, Chloe Johnson, on June 1, 2013, in Portland, Oregon. The three other original bandmates of R.E.M. were all in attendance and performed at the ceremony. 

He is known for his encyclopedic knowledge of music, as well as his extensive personal record collection. Buck estimated his record collection to be around 25,000 in the late 1990s (he estimated he had 10,000 vinyl singles, 6,000 LPs and 4,000 CDs).

Buck is an atheist.

In the 1990s, Buck relocated to the Pacific Northwest and divided time between Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington. He has also lived in Todos Santos, Baja California Sur, Mexico.

===Airline incident===
On April 21, 2001, Buck was aboard a transatlantic flight (British Airways #48) from Seattle to London to play a concert at Trafalgar Square. Witnesses alleged that Buck exhibited various bizarre behaviors on the flight, including shoving a compact disc into a drinks trolley thinking it was a CD player, tearing up the &quot;yellow card&quot; warning notice handed to him by the flight crew, claiming &quot;I am R.E.M.&quot; and being involved in a struggle over a yogurt cup with two flight attendants, which resulted in the cup exploding. Buck&#x27;s actions led to two charges of common assault on the flight attendants, one charge of being drunk on a plane and one charge of damaging British Airways cutlery and crockery.

At the ensuing trial in London, Buck&#x27;s defense claimed that the moderate amount of wine he had drunk had reacted adversely with the brand of sleeping pill he was taking and rendered him unable to control his actions. The prosecution argued that he was simply intoxicated from supposedly consuming 15 glasses of wine. After the trial, which included testimony from Bono, the lead singer of the Irish rock band U2, Buck was cleared on the grounds of non-insane automatism.

<text>The King Edward VII Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to three-year-old colts and geldings. It is run at Ascot over a distance of 1 mile 3 furlongs and 211 yards (2,406 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in June.

The event was established in 1834, and it was originally known as the Ascot Derby. In the early part of its history it was also open to fillies. The race was renamed in memory of King Edward VII in 1926.

The King Edward VII Stakes is currently held about two weeks after The Derby, and it usually features horses which were entered for that race. It is contested on the fourth day of the five-day Royal Ascot meeting.

<text>The Hardwicke Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged four years or older. It is run at Ascot over a distance of 1 mile 3 furlongs and 211 yards (2,406 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in June.

==History==
The event is named in honour of the 5th Earl of Hardwicke, who served as the Master of the Buckhounds in the 19th century. It was established in 1879, and it was originally open to horses aged three or older. The last three-year-old to win was Helioscope in 1949.

The Hardwicke Stakes is now held on the final day of the five-day Royal Ascot meeting. The leading horses often return to the venue to compete in the following month&#x27;s King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. The first to win both races in the same year was Aureole in 1954, and the most recent was Harbinger in 2010.

<text>Benjamin Richard Civiletti (July 17, 1935October 16, 2022) was an American lawyer who served as the United States Attorney General during the Carter administration, from 1979 to 1981. The first Italian American to lead the U.S. Department of Justice, he previously served as the Deputy Attorney General and Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division. Later he was a senior partner in the Baltimore-based law firm of Venable LLP (known until 2003 as Venable, Baetjer &amp; Howard). He specialized in commercial litigation and internal investigations working at Venable LLP.

Beginning in 2001, Civiletti was one of the three members of the Independent Review Board, a board that the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union must answer to when allegations of corruption or organized crime infiltration surface under the terms of a consent decree issued in 1989 by a federal district court judgment.

== Early life and career ==
Civiletti was born in Peekskill, New York. His father, Benjamin, worked as a grocery store manager; his mother was Virginia (Muller). Civiletti was raised in nearby Lake Mahopac and Shrub Oak and attended the Washington Irving High School which was in Tarrytown. He graduated from Johns Hopkins University receiving a Bachelor of Arts in psychology in 1957. He attended Columbia Law School and earned a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Maryland School of Law in Baltimore.

Civiletti was a law clerk for W. Calvin Chesnut, a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. He then became an assistant United States Attorney in Baltimore a year after graduating from law school, serving in that capacity until 1964.

==Career==
Griffin Bell noticed Civiletti&#x27;s accomplishments while Bell was forming the Justice Department leadership team for the presidency of Jimmy Carter by his confidant, Charles Kirbo, a law partner of Bell&#x27;s who had once been involved in a case with Civiletti. In February 1977, Carter nominated Civletti to succeed Richard Thornburgh as United States Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division. In 1978, he was nominated to become the Deputy Attorney General.

Civiletti was serving as the Deputy Attorney General when Griffin Bell resigned as Attorney General of the United States. He was appointed to the Justice Department&#x27;s top position on July 19, 1979, becoming the first Italian American to assume the role of attorney general. Although Bell voluntarily resigned, his resignation happened during a major cabinet shakeup in the Carter administration. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph A. Califano, Jr. and Secretary of the Treasury W. Michael Blumenthal also resigned on the same day. Transportation Secretary Brock Adams resigned soon afterwards.

As the US Attorney General, Civiletti argued several important cases on behalf of the U.S. government. Notably he argued before the International Court of Justice on behalf of Americans being held captive in Iran during the Iran hostage crisis, in the &quot;Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran&quot;. He also argued before the Supreme Court in support of the government&#x27;s right to denaturalize Nazi war criminals in &quot;Fedorenko v. United States&quot;.

Opinions which were written by Civiletti while he was attorney general, interpreted the United States Constitution and U.S. federal law to say that government cannot operate until Congress agrees on a spending bill. They set the stage for partial government shutdowns in later years.

While serving as Attorney General, Civiletti recommended, and President Carter agreed to a commutation of sentences to time served for four unrepentant Puerto Rican nationalists convicted of shooting five U.S. Congressmen at the U.S. Capitol. The commutations happened in spite of public opposition from Puerto Rico&#x27;s governor who believed it would encourage more terrorism. 

On July 10, 2008, Maryland Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley announced that Civiletti would serve as the chairman of the Maryland Commission on Capital Punishment which was set up to study the application of capital punishment in Maryland and make a recommendation on the abolition of the death penalty in Maryland. On November 12, 2008, the commission voted 13–7 with Civiletti voting with the majority, to recommend that the Maryland General Assembly abolish capital punishment in the state.

==Personal life==
Civiletti married Gaile L. Lundgren in 1958. They had three children: Benjamin H., Andrew S., and Lynne T. Civiletti.

Civiletti died on October 16, 2022, at home in Lutherville, Maryland. He was 87 and suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease prior to his death.

==Recognition==
*1980, Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement
*2009, American Lawyer&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award
*2012, Lifetime Achievement Award by the Equal Justice Council

<doc id="741949" wikidata="Q16995862" url="?curid=741949" title="Lancashire Oaks">
<text>The Lancashire Oaks is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to fillies and mares aged three years or older. It is run at Haydock Park over a distance of 1 mile, 3 furlongs and 175 yards (2,373 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in early July.

==History==
The earliest recorded version of the race was run at Liverpool in the nineteenth century and was won in 1857 by The Derby winner Blink Bonny. The event was re-established in 1939, and it was run at Manchester Racecourse over 1 mile and 3 furlongs. It was abandoned throughout World War II, with no running from 1940 to 1946. In the early part of its history it was restricted to three-year-old fillies.

The original venue of the Lancashire Oaks closed in November 1963, and the race resumed at Haydock Park in 1965. The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the event was subsequently given Group 3 status.

The Lancashire Oaks was opened to older fillies and mares in 1991. It was promoted to Group 2 level in 2004.

<doc id="741950" wikidata="Q11681149" url="?curid=741950" title="Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu">
<text>The Diocese of Honolulu () is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory or diocese for the state of Hawaii in the United States. It is a suffragan diocese in the ecclesiastical province of the metropolitan Archdiocese of San Francisco.

The mother church of the Diocese of Honolulu is the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Honolulu. As of 2023, the bishop of Honolulu is Clarence Silva.

== Description ==
The patron saint of the Diocese of Honolulu is the Blessed Virgin Mary, under the title of &quot;Malia O Ka Malu&quot; or Our Lady Queen of Peace. Other saints associated with the diocese include Damien De Veuster and Marianne Cope.

The diocese ministers to Hawaiian, English, Ilokano, Tagalog, Samoan, Tongan, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Vietnamese congregants.

==History==
===1825 to 1831===

In 1825, Pope Leo XII established the Prefecture Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands, a part of the Vicariate Apostolic of Oriental Oceania. He tasked the Picpus Order with evangelizing the Kingdom of Hawaii (then known as the Sandwich Islands). Leo XII appointed the missionary Reverend Alexis Bachelot as its prefect.

Bachelot and two other Picpus priests, Reverend Abraham Armand and Reverend Patrick Short, arrived in Honolulu in the summer of 1825. However, the Hawaiian royalty had converted to Protestantism four years earlier. Queen Kaʻahumanu ordered the priests deported, but the ship captain refused to take them because he had received no payment for their passage. After a two-day standoff, Kaʻahumanu allowed the three priests to remain in Hawaii.

When the three priests finally disembarked, they were joined by six lay brothers. They performed the first baptism in November 1825. The priests began their missionary work, but encountered suspicion from most chiefs. The priests had problems communicating their intentions as none of them was fluent in English or Hawaiian. However, the priests received support from the high chief Boki, the royal governor of Oahu, and his wife Kuini Liliha.

The Picpus priests learned the local language, went into the Native Hawaiian community and began preaching to them. They distributed Hawaiian language Bibles. Hundreds of Native Hawaiians were baptised. The first converts included Kalanimoku, chief minister of the kingdom, Boki and Liliha.

=== 1831 to 1840 ===
The American Congregationalist missionaries in Hawaii were alarmed at the growth of Catholicism in the islands. They influenced Kaʻahumanu to persuade King Kamehameha III to enact repressive policies against Catholics. The king expelled Bachelot and Short in 1831 and banned other priests from entering the Kingdom. After the priests&#x27; departure, many Native Hawaiian converts complained of being imprisoned, beaten and tortured. Commodore John Downes of the United States Navy intervened on the converts&#x27; behalf with Kamehameha III, stopping the mistreatment.

In 1835, Vicar Apostolic Étienne Rouchouze and Bachelot dispatched Columba Murphy, a Picpus religious brother, to Hawaii to evaluate the situation. Kamehameha II allowed Murphy to enter the kingdom since he was not a priest. After several months, Murphy left to report to his superiors.

In 1836, Bachelot sent Arsenius Walsh to Honolulu to continue Murphy&#x27;s work. Kamehameha III initially refused Walsh&#x27;s entry, but a French naval officer persuaded the king to let him stay. Kamehameha III also agreed to permit the Picpus Fathers to work freely in Hawaii so long as they only ministered to foreigners.

In April 1837, Bachelot and Short sailed into Honolulu, thinking that they were now allowed back. However, two weeks later, the Hawaiian government forced them back on their ship. The American and British consuls, with the assistance of the Royal Navy and the French Navy, forced Kamehameha III to allow Bachelot and Short to disembark. In July 1839, the French Navy frigate &quot;Artemise&quot; sailed into Honolulu Harbor. Captain Cyrille Laplace had been ordered by his government to:&quot;...to make it well understood that it would be to the advantage of the chiefs of those islands of the Ocean to conduct themselves in such a manner as not to incur the wrath of France.&quot;Fearing a French assault, Kamehameha III issued the Edict of Toleration in July 1839, granting religious freedom to all Catholics in Hawaii.

===1840 to 1847===
Shortly after the Edict of Toleration was issued, Rouchouze arrived in Honolulu with three Picpus priests, including the previously exiled Louis Maigret. The priests broke ground on Our Lady of Peace in Honolulu, the first permanent church in Hawaii, in 1840. As an act of reconciliation, Kamehameha III had donated land for the church.

During the groundbreaking mass, 280 Native Hawaiian catechumens received the sacraments of baptism and confirmation. For the rest of 1840, devotees harvested large blocks of coral off the Oahu coastline to build the future Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace.

Rouchouze commissioned the construction of mission churches and schools. He imported a printing press to Honolulu to produce missals and hymnals in the Hawaiian language. St. Raphael&#x27;s Parish was established on the Island of Kauai in 1841, the first Catholic church there

In January 1842, Rouchouze set sail to France to recruit more Picpus priests and brothers to serve in Hawaii. However, his ship was lost at sea. In 1846, the first Catholic priest arrived on the island of Maui.

=== 1847 to 1892 ===

Five years after Rouchouze&#x27;s disappearance, the Vatican decided in 1847 to elevate the prefecture of the Sandwich Islands to the Vicariate Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands.
Pope Pius IX appointed Maigret in 1847 as the first vicar apostolic of the Sandwich Islands. The next year, the vicariate was renamed the Vicariate Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands.

The first Catholic church in Hilo on the Island of Hawaii, Saint Martin of Tours, was completed in 1848. Maigret completed the construction of the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace. He also invited the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary and priests and religious brothers of the Society of Mary (Marianists) to open schools in the kingdom. The first permanent church on Maui, Maria Lanakila, was dedicated in 1858. Maigret died in 1882.

Pope Leo XIII named Bernard Koeckemann as the second vicar apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. During his episcopate, over 16,000 Catholic Portuguese workers arrived in Hawaii to work on the sugarcane plantations. Given the simultaneous decline in the Native Hawaiian population, Koeckemann focused his evangelism efforts on the new immigrants. He made Catholic education a priority and built many schools.

Koeckemann also saw the rise of leprosy cases throughout the kingdom. Kamehameha III ordered all leprosy patients to confine themselves to the Kalaupapa Leper Colony on the island of Molokai. In 1873, Reverend Damien De Veuster went to Kalaupapa to minister to these people. Sister Marianne Cope and six sisters of St Francis arrived in Hawaii in 1883 from Syracuse, New York, to operated the leper colony. Koeckemann died in 1892.

=== 1892 to 1961 ===

In 1892, Leo XIII named Gulstan Ropert as third vicar apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. One year later, a group of American businessmen, aided by a contingent of United States Marines, overthrew Queen Liliʻuokalani and established a Republic of Hawaii. Many Native Hawaiian Catholics urged Ropert to speak out against Liliʻuokalani being tried for treason, but he remained silent.

Ropert provided support to the Hawaiian families of men who fought in the Spanish–American War of 1898 and the Philippine–American War of 1899 to 1902. In 1900, the Republic of Hawaii was admitted to the United States as the Territory of Hawaiʻi. Ropert died in 1903.
The next vicar apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands was Monsignor Libert Boeynaems, appointed by Leo XIII in 1903. With the establishment of Naval Station Pearl Harbor in 1900, Fort Shafter in 1907, and Schofield Barracks in 1908 Boeynaems started ministering to many Catholics in the US Armed Forces. To assist Boeynaems, Pope Pius XI appointed Stephen Alencastre in 1924 as coadjutor vicar apostolic.

After Boeynaems died in 1926, Alencastre automatically became the next vicar apostolic. He also oversaw the renovation of the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace, modernizing it in time for the centennial celebration of the Catholic Church in Hawaii in 1927. Alencastre died in 1940.

=== 1961 to 1982 ===

Pope Pius XII in 1941 suppressed the Vicariate Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands, replacing it with the Diocese of Honolulu. He appointed Monsignor James Joseph Sweeney of San Francisco as the first bishop of Honolulu. The diocese established the Saint Stephen Diocesan Seminary in Kalihi Valley in 1946.

Motivated by the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960s, Sweeney renovated the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in keeping with the newly promulgated Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy. Soon all the parishes offered Mass primarily in the vernacular in place of Latin and altars were built facing the congregation instead of the sanctuary wall. Other languages were incorporated into the mass including the Hawaiian language. Sweeney also invited the Marist Fathers and Brothers to staff several parishes on Oahu and Kauai. In 1959, Hawaii was admitted as a state. Sweeney died in 1968.

Pope Paul VI in 1954 appointed Auxiliary Bishop John Scanlan of Honolulu as the second bishop of Honolulu. Scanlan invited the Society of Jesus, the Christian Brothers of Ireland, the Religious of the Virgin Mary, and the Dominican Sisters of Iloilo to enter the diocese. The Jesuits primarily ministered to the students of the University of Hawaii at Mānoa. Five Marianist priests established St. Louis Junior College in Honolulu in 1955, which later became Chaminade University of Honolulu. Scanlan retired in 1981.

=== 1982 to 2005 ===
The next bishop of Honolulu was Auxiliary Bishop Joseph Ferrario of Honolulu, selected by Pope John Paul II in 1982. Ferrario revamped major diocesan offices and appointed pastors to parishes that were supportive of his vision of implementing the Second Vatican Council. Ferrario&#x27;s harshest critics were the conservative followers of the Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre&#x27;s Society of Saint Pius X. Ferrario, through his judicial vicar, Joseph Bukoski, issued a canonical decree of excommunication to six individuals in that group in 1991. Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, reversed the excommunications. Ferrario retired in 1993.

In 1994, John Paul II, appointed Auxiliary Bishop Francis DiLorenzo from the Diocese of Scranton as the fourth Bishop of Honolulu. He served in Honolulu until his appointed as bishop of the Diocese of Richmond in 2004.

=== 2005 to present ===

Monsignor Clarence Silva of San Francisco became the first native-born bishop of Honolulu, named by Pope Benedict XVI in 2005. Over 3,500 attended his consecration, making it one of the largest events ever held by the diocese.

Silva was a principal promoter for the causes of sainthood for Damien De Veuster and Marianne Cope. Silva travelled to Kalaupapa in 2005 to pay homage to them. Damien was canonized in 2009 and Cope in 2012.

As of 2023, Silva is the bishop of Honolulu.

===Sex abuse ===
In 1989, David Figueroa anonymously accused Bishop Ferrario of sexually abusing him when he was a young child in Kailua. Figueroa said that the abuse continued after Ferrario became bishop. Ferrario denied the accusations and noted that the Vatican had previously investigated them, deciding that they were not valid. Figueroa revealed himself as the accuser in an appearance in 1990 on the &quot;Geraldo&quot; TV show. He sued the diocese in 1991. By 2013, two more men had filed lawsuits, accusing Ferrario of sexual abuse when they were children.

In 2003, Bishop DiLorenzo removed Reverend Roberto Batoon as pastoral administrator of Molokai Catholic Community, a cluster of parishes on the Island of Molokai. Batoon had been accused of sexual abuse by several individuals when he was a priest in the Philippines.

In April 2020, Bishop Silva announced during a Sunday mass that the diocese was paying millions to settle prior sex abuse cases. Silva also acknowledged that the diocese was still facing a large of number of sex abuse lawsuits as well.

<text>The Duchess of Cambridge Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to two-year-old fillies. It is run on the July Course at Newmarket over a distance of 6 furlongs (1,207 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in July.

==History==
The event was established in 1947 as the Cherry Hinton Stakes, and the inaugural running was won by Great Fun.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and for a period the Cherry Hinton Stakes was classed at Group 3 level. It was promoted to Group 2 status in 1996.

The Duchess of Cambridge Stakes is currently held on the second day of Newmarket&#x27;s three-day July Festival meeting. The equivalent race for male horses is the July Stakes.

Several winners have gone on to achieve victory in the following season&#x27;s 1,000 Guineas Stakes. The first was Sweet Solera in 1961, and the most recent was Mawj in 2023.

In 2013 the race was renamed the Duchess of Cambridge Stakes in honour of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. In the same year the Windsor Forest Stakes at Royal Ascot was renamed the Duke of Cambridge Stakes.

<text>James Joseph Sweeney (June 19, 1898 – June 19, 1968) was an American prelate of the Catholic Church. He was the first Bishop of Honolulu, serving from 1941 until his death in 1968.

==Biography==
Sweeney was born in San Francisco, California, to John Joseph and Catherine (née McCarrick) Sweeney. He received his early education at St. James Boys School from 1907 to 1913. He later attended Saint Patrick Seminary in Menlo Park.

He was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of San Francisco on June 24, 1925, by Archbishop Edward Hanna at the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption in San Francisco. He served as assistant pastor until 1931 when he was appointed the archdiocesan director of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith. On November 22, 1929, Pope Pius XI conferred the title of &quot;Right Reverend Monsignor&quot; on Father Sweeney.

On May 20, 1941, he was appointed the first bishop of the newly erected Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu. He was consecrated on July 25 of that year. Bishop Sweeney saw the Honolulu see through World War II, and statehood.

He died on his 70th birthday in 1968 in San Francisco. His funeral liturgy was held at his home parish of Saint Paul in San Francisco. At his request, he was buried with his parents in a family crypt in Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California.

<text>Joseph Washington McClurg (February 22, 1818December 2, 1900) was the 19th Governor of Missouri in the decade following the American Civil War. His stepfather was William Murphy.

==Biography==
Born near St. Louis, Missouri, McClurg was orphaned at seven and raised by grandparents in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where his grandfather owned the city&#x27;s first iron foundry. Educated at Xenia Academy and Oxford College in Ohio, he taught school briefly in Louisiana and Mississippi in the 1830s before returning to St. Louis to serve as deputy for his uncle, Sheriff Marshall Brotherton. At 19, he studied law and was admitted to the bar in Texas, although he never practiced. In 1841, he returned to Missouri to marry Mary Catherine Johnson. He was involved in lead mining and merchandising and created McClurg&#x27;s Old Salt Road through rural Missouri to assure a supply of salt for his customers. In 1844, he would operate a store in Hazelwood (the first county seat of Webster County), Missouri with his stepfather.

In 1850, McClurg left Missouri for the gold rush in California, where he opened a miner&#x27;s store in Georgetown (12 miles from Sutter&#x27;s Mill). After two years, he returned to Missouri, this time to Linn Creek (now under the Lake of the Ozarks), where he established a thriving business supplying settlers and merchants in Missouri, Arkansas, Texas and the Indian Territory.

An avid unionist, he was a delegate to the historic Gamble Convention in March 1861, in which Missouri agreed to stay in the Union. Although he was later to sign the 13th Amendment as a Missouri Representative, Joseph McClurg was a slaveowner until shortly before the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. During the Civil War, McClurg was a colonel of the 8th Missouri State Militia Cavalry, until elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1862, 1864 and 1866.

He resigned his last term to run for Missouri governor as a Radical Republican, a party against the re-enfranchisement of ex-Confederates. He served a two-year term and with Radical Republicanism falling from favor, lost his bid for re-election. In 1886, he accompanied his son, Joseph, and his daughter, Fannie along with her six children, to homestead in the Dakota Territory. It was an entrepreneurial venture made promising on the basis of several years of mild weather; however, the winter of 1886-87 was a famously cruel one that convinced the family to return to Missouri. He was appointed Registrar of Lands at Springfield before returning to Lebanon, Missouri, where he died in 1900.

<doc id="741966" wikidata="Q477324" url="?curid=741966" title="Suppression of the Society of Jesus">
<text>The suppression of the Society of Jesus was the removal of all members of the Jesuits from most of Western Europe and their respective colonies beginning in 1759 along with the abolition of the order by the Holy See in 1773; the papacy acceded to anti-Jesuit demands without much resistance. The Jesuits were serially expelled from the Portuguese Empire (1759), France (1764), the Two Sicilies, Malta, Parma, the Spanish Empire (1767) and in Austria and Hungary (1782).

Historians identify multiple factors causing the suppression. The Jesuits, who were not above getting involved in politics, were distrusted for their closeness to the pope and his power in independent nations&#x27; religious and political affairs. In France, it was a combination of many influences, from Jansenism to free-thought, to the then-prevailing impatience with the Ancien Régime. Monarchies attempting to centralise and secularise political power viewed the Jesuits as supranational, too strongly allied to the papacy, and too autonomous from the monarchs in whose territory they operated.

With his papal brief, &quot;Dominus ac Redemptor&quot; (21 July 1773), Pope Clement XIV suppressed the Society as a &quot;fait accompli&quot;. However, the order did not disappear. It continued underground operations in China, Russia, Prussia, and the United States. In Russia, Catherine the Great allowed the founding of a new novitiate. In 1814, a subsequent pope, Pius VII, acted to restore the Society of Jesus to its previous provinces, and the Jesuits began to resume their work in those countries.

==Background to suppression==
Before the eighteenth-century suppression of the Jesuits in many countries, there had been earlier bans, such as in territories of the Venetian Republic between 1606 and 1656–1657, begun and ended as part of disputes between the Republic and the papacy, beginning with the Venetian Interdict.

By the mid-18th century, the Society had acquired a European reputation for political maneuvering and economic success. Monarchs in many European states grew increasingly wary of what they saw as undue interference from a foreign entity. The expulsion of Jesuits from their states had the added benefit of allowing governments to impound the Society&#x27;s accumulated wealth and possessions. However, historian Gibson (1966) cautions, &quot;[h]ow far this served as a motive for the expulsion we do not know.&quot;

Various states took advantage of different events to take action. The series of political struggles between various monarchs, particularly France and Portugal, began with disputes over territory in 1750 and culminated in the suspension of diplomatic relations and the dissolution of the Society by the pope over most of Europe, and even some executions. The Portuguese Empire, France, the Two Sicilies, Parma, and the Spanish Empire were involved to a different extent.

The conflicts began with trade disputes in 1750 in Portugal, 1755 in France, and the late 1750s in the Two Sicilies. In 1758 the government of Joseph I of Portugal took advantage of the waning powers of Pope Benedict XIV and deported Jesuits from South America after relocating them with their native workers and then fighting a brief conflict (Guaraní War), formally suppressing the order in 1759. In 1762 the (a court, not a legislature) ruled against the Society in a huge bankruptcy case under pressure from a host of groups – from within the Church but also secular notables such as Madame de Pompadour, the king&#x27;s mistress. Austria and the Two Sicilies suppressed the order by decree in 1767.

==Lead-up to suppression==
===First national suppression: Portugal and its empire in 1759===

There were long-standing tensions between the Portuguese crown and the Jesuits, which increased when the Count of Oeiras (later the Marquis of Pombal) became the monarch&#x27;s minister of state, culminating in the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1759. The Távora affair in 1758 could be considered a pretext for the expulsion and crown confiscation of Jesuit assets. According to historians James Lockhart and Stuart B. Schwartz, the Jesuits&#x27; &quot;independence, power, wealth, control of education, and ties to Rome made the Jesuits obvious targets for Pombal&#x27;s brand of extreme regalism.&quot;

Portugal&#x27;s quarrel with the Jesuits began over an exchange of South American colonial territory with Spain. By a secret treaty of 1750, Portugal relinquished to Spain the contested Colonia del Sacramento at the mouth of the Rio de la Plata in exchange for the Seven Reductions of Paraguay. These autonomous Jesuit missions had been nominal Spanish colonial territory. The native Guaraní, who lived in the mission territories, were ordered to quit their country and move to Uruguay. The Guaraní rose in arms against the transfer due to the harsh conditions, and the so-called Guaraní War ensued. It was a disaster for the Guaraní. In Portugal, a battle escalated, with inflammatory pamphlets denouncing or defending the Jesuits, who, for over a century, had protected the Guarani from enslavement by way of the Reductions. The Portuguese colonizers secured the expulsion of the Jesuits.

On 1 April 1758, Pombal persuaded the aged Pope Benedict XIV to appoint the Portuguese cardinal Francisco de Saldanha da Gama to investigate allegations against the Jesuits. Benedict was skeptical about the gravity of the alleged abuses. He ordered a &quot;minute inquiry&quot;, but to safeguard the Society&#x27;s reputation, all serious matters were to be referred back to him. Benedict died the following month, on May 3. On May 15, Saldanha, having received the papal brief only a fortnight before, declared that the Jesuits were guilty of having exercised &quot;illicit, public, and scandalous commerce&quot; in Portugal and its colonies. He had not visited Jesuit houses as ordered and pronounced on the issues the pope had reserved for himself.

Pombal implicated the Jesuits in the Távora affair, an attempted assassination of the king on 3 September 1758, on the grounds of their friendship with some of the supposed conspirators. On 19 January 1759, he issued a decree sequestering the property of the Society in the Portuguese dominions. The following September, he deported the Portuguese fathers, about one thousand in number, to the Pontifical States, keeping the foreigners in prison. Among those arrested and executed was the then denounced Gabriel Malagrida, the Jesuit confessor of Leonor of Távora, for &quot;crimes against the faith&quot;. After Malagrida&#x27;s execution in 1759, the Portuguese crown suppressed the Society. The Portuguese ambassador was recalled from Rome, and the papal nuncio was expelled. Diplomatic relations between Portugal and Rome were broken off until 1770.
===Suppression in France in 1764===
The suppression of the Jesuits in France began in the French island colony of Martinique, where the Society of Jesus had a commercial stake in sugar plantations worked by black slaves and free labor. Their large mission plantations included large local populations that worked under the usual conditions of tropical colonial agriculture of the 18th century. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; in 1908 said that the practice of the missionaries occupying themselves personally in selling off the goods produced (an anomaly for a religious order) &quot;was allowed partly to provide for the current expenses of the mission, partly to protect the simple, childlike natives from the common plague of dishonest intermediaries.&quot;

Father Antoine Lavalette, superior of the Martinique missions, became one of the largest land and slave owners on the island. But on the outbreak of war with Great Britain, ships carrying goods of an estimated value of 2,000,000 &quot;livres&quot; were captured, and Lavalette was unable to pay his very large debts and went bankrupt. His creditors turned to the Jesuit procurator in Paris to demand payment. Still, he refused responsibility for the debts of an independent mission – though he offered to negotiate for a settlement. The creditors went to the courts and received a favorable decision in 1760, obliging the Society to pay and giving leave to in the case of non-payment.

On the advice of their lawyers, the Jesuits appealed to the Parlement of Paris. This turned out to be an imprudent step for their interests. Not only did the Parlement support the lower court on 8 May 1761, but having once gotten the case into its hands, the Jesuits&#x27; opponents in that assembly determined to strike a blow at the order. Under fire for currency speculation and accused of torturing and killing four slaves, Lavalette resigned from the Jesuit order in 1762.

The Jesuits had many who opposed them. The Jansenists were numerous among the enemies of the orthodox party. The Sorbonne, an educational rival, joined the Gallicans, the &quot;Philosophes&quot;, and the Encyclopédistes. Louis XV was weak; his wife and children were in favor of the Jesuits; his able first minister, the Duc de Choiseul, played into the hands of the Parlement and the royal mistress, Madame de Pompadour, to whom the Jesuits had refused absolution since she was living in sin with the King of France, was a determined opponent. The determination of the Parlement of Paris in time bore down all opposition.

The attack on the Jesuits was opened on 17 April 1762 by the Jansenist sympathizer Abbé Henri Chauvelin, who denounced the Constitution of the Society of Jesus, which was publicly examined and discussed in a hostile press. The Parlement issued its &quot;Extraits des assertions&quot;, assembled from passages from Jesuit theologians and canonists, alleging then to have taught every sort of immorality and error. On 6 August 1762, the final &quot;arrêt&quot; was proposed to the Parlement by the Advocate General Joly de Fleury, condemning the Society to extinction. Still, the king&#x27;s intervention brought eight months delay, and in the meantime, a compromise was suggested by the Court. If the French Jesuits separated from the Society headed by the Jesuit General directly under the pope&#x27;s authority and came under a French vicar, with French customs, as with the Gallican Church, the Crown would still protect them. The French Jesuits, rejecting Gallicanism, refused to consent. On 1 April 1763, the colleges were closed, and by a further &quot;arrêt&quot; of March 9, 1764, the Jesuits were required to renounce their vows under pain of banishment.

At the end of November 1764, the king signed an edict dissolving the Society throughout his dominions, though some provincial parlements still protected them, such as Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Artois. In the draft of the edict, he canceled numerous clauses that implied that the Society was guilty, and writing to Étienne François de Choiseul, Duke of Choiseul, he concluded: &quot;If I adopt the advice of others for the peace of my realm, you must make the changes I propose, or I will do nothing. I say no more, lest I should say too much.&quot;

====Decline of the Jesuits in New France====
Following the British 1759 victory against the French in Quebec, France lost its North American territory of New France, where Jesuit missionaries in the seventeenth century had been active among indigenous peoples. British rule had implications for Jesuits in New France, but their numbers and sites were already in decline. As early as 1700, the Jesuits had adopted a policy of merely maintaining their existing posts instead of trying to establish new ones beyond Quebec, Montreal, and Ottawa.

Once New France was under British control, the British barred the immigration of any further Jesuits. By 1763, only twenty-one Jesuits were still stationed in what was now the British colony of Quebec. By 1773, only eleven Jesuits remained. The British crown claimed Jesuit property in Canada in the same year and declared that the Society of Jesus in New France was dissolved.

===Spanish Empire suppression of 1767===
====Events leading to the Spanish suppression====

The Suppression in Spain and the Spanish colonies, and in its dependency the Kingdom of Naples, was the last of the expulsions, with Portugal (1759) and France (1764) having already set the pattern. The Spanish crown had already begun a series of administrative and other changes in their overseas empire, such as reorganizing the viceroyalties, rethinking economic policies, and establishing a military, so the expulsion of the Jesuits is seen as part of this general trend known generally as the Bourbon Reforms. The reforms aimed to curb American-born Spaniards&#x27; increasing autonomy and self-confidence, reassert crown control, and increase revenues. Some historians doubt that the Jesuits were guilty of intrigues against the Spanish crown that were used as the immediate cause for the expulsion.

Contemporaries in Spain attributed the suppression of the Jesuits to the Esquilache Riots, named after the Italian advisor to Bourbon King Charles III, that erupted after a sumptuary law was enacted. The law, which placed restrictions on men&#x27;s wearing of voluminous capes and limiting the breadth of sombreros men could wear, was seen as an &quot;insult to Castilian pride.&quot;
King Charles fled to the countryside when an angry crowd of those resisters converged on the royal palace. The crowd shouted, &quot;Long Live Spain! Death to Esquilache!&quot; His Flemish palace guard fired warning shots over the people&#x27;s heads. An account says that a group of Jesuit priests appeared on the scene, soothed the protesters with speeches, and sent them home. Charles decided to rescind the tax hike and hat-trimming edict and fire his finance minister.

The monarch and his advisers were alarmed by the uprising, which challenged royal authority. The Jesuits were accused of inciting the mob and publicly accusing the monarch of religious crimes. Pedro Rodríguez de Campomanes, attorney for the Council of Castile, the body overseeing central Spain, articulated this view in a report the king read. Charles ordered convening a special royal commission to draw up a master plan to expel the Jesuits. The commission first met in January 1767. It modeled its plan on the tactics deployed by France&#x27;s Philip IV against the Knights Templar in 1307 – emphasizing the element of surprise. Charles&#x27; adviser Campomanes had written a treatise on the Templars in 1747, which may have informed the implementation of the Jesuit suppression. One historian states, &quot;[Charles] never would have dared to expel the Jesuits had he not been assured of the support of an influential party within the Spanish Church.&quot; Jansenists and mendicant orders had long opposed the Jesuits and sought to curtail their power.

====Secret plan of expulsion====

King Charles&#x27; ministers kept their deliberations to themselves, as did the king, who acted upon &quot;urgent, just, and necessary reasons, which I reserve in my royal mind.&quot; The correspondence of Bernardo Tanucci, Charles&#x27; anti-clerical minister in Naples, contains the ideas that, from time to time, guided Spanish policy. Charles conducted his government through the Count of Aranda, a reader of Voltaire, and other liberals.

The commission&#x27;s meeting on 29 January 1767 planned the expulsion of the Jesuits. Secret orders, to be opened at sunrise on April 2, were sent to all provincial viceroys and district military commanders in Spain. Each sealed envelope contained two documents. One was a copy of the original order expelling &quot;all members of the Society of Jesus&quot; from Charles&#x27; Spanish domains and confiscating all their goods. The other instructed local officials to surround the Jesuit colleges and residences on the night of April 2, arrest the Jesuits, and arrange their passage to ships awaiting them at various ports. King Charles&#x27; closing sentence read: &quot;If a single Jesuit, even though sick or dying, is still to be found in the area under your command after the embarkation, prepare yourself to face summary execution.&quot;

Pope Clement XIII, presented with a similar ultimatum by the Spanish ambassador to the Vatican a few days before the decree would take effect, asked King Charles, &quot;by what authority?&quot; and threatened him with eternal damnation. Pope Clement could not enforce his protest, and the expulsion occurred as planned.

====Jesuits expelled from Mexico (New Spain)====

In New Spain, the Jesuits had actively evangelized the Indians on the northern frontier. But their main activity involved educating elite &quot;criollo&quot; (American-born Spanish) men, many of whom themselves became Jesuits. Of the 678 Jesuits expelled from Mexico, 75% were Mexican-born. In late June 1767, Spanish soldiers removed the Jesuits from their 16 missions and 32 stations in Mexico. No Jesuit could be excepted from the king&#x27;s decree, no matter how old or ill. Many died on the trek along the cactus-studded trail to the Gulf Coast port of Veracruz, where ships awaited them to transport them to Italian exile.

There were protests in Mexico at the exile of so many Jesuit members of elite families. But the Jesuits themselves obeyed the order. Since the Jesuits had owned extensive landed estates in Mexico – which supported their evangelization of indigenous peoples and their education mission to criollo elites – the properties became a source of wealth for the crown. The crown auctioned them off, benefiting the treasury, and their criollo purchasers gained productive well-run properties. Many criollo families felt outraged at the crown&#x27;s actions, regarding it as a &quot;despotic act.&quot; One well-known Mexican Jesuit, Francisco Javier Clavijero, during his Italian exile, wrote an important history of Mexico, with emphasis on the indigenous peoples. Alexander von Humboldt, the famous German scientist who spent a year in Mexico in 1803–04, praised Clavijero&#x27;s work on the history of Mexico&#x27;s indigenous peoples.
Due to the isolation of the Spanish missions on the Baja California peninsula, the expulsion decree did not arrive there until the new governor, Gaspar de Portolá, arrived on November 30. By 3 February 1768, Portolá&#x27;s soldiers had removed the peninsula&#x27;s 16 Jesuit missionaries from their posts and gathered them in Loreto, whence they sailed to the Mexican mainland and thence to Europe. Showing sympathy for the Jesuits, Portolá treated them kindly, even as he ended their 70 years of mission-building in Baja, California. The Jesuit missions in Baja California were turned over to the Franciscans and subsequently to the Dominicans, and the future missions in Alta California were founded by Franciscans.

The change in the Spanish colonies in the New World was particularly great, as missions often dominated the far-flung settlements. Almost overnight, in the mission towns of Sonora and Arizona, the &quot;black robes&quot; (Jesuits) disappeared, and the &quot;gray robes&quot; (Franciscans) replaced them.

====Expulsion from the Philippines====
The Jesuits were soon dislodged from the Philippines which they had converted from Animism, Hinduism, and Islam, to Christianity. The royal decree expelling the Society of Jesus from Spain and its dominions reached Manila, Philippines, on 17 May 1768. Between 1769 and 1771, the Jesuits were transported from the Spanish East Indies to Spain and deported to Italy.

====Exile of Spanish Jesuits to Italy====

Spanish soldiers rounded up the Jesuits in Mexico, marched them to the coasts, and placed them below the decks of Spanish warships headed for the Italian port of Civitavecchia in the Papal States. When they arrived, Pope Clement XIII refused to allow the ships to unload their prisoners onto papal territory. Fired upon by batteries of artillery from the shore of Civitavecchia, the Spanish warships had to look for an anchorage off the island of Corsica, then a dependency of Genoa. But since a rebellion had erupted on Corsica, it took five months for some of the Jesuits to set foot on land.

Several historians have estimated the number of Jesuits deported at 6,000. But it is unclear whether this figure encompasses Spain alone or extends to Spain&#x27;s overseas colonies (notably Mexico and the Philippines). Jesuit historian Hubert Becher claims that about 600 Jesuits died during their voyage and waiting ordeal.

In Naples, King Charles&#x27; minister Bernardo Tanucci pursued a similar policy: On November 3, the Jesuits, without accusation or trial, were marched across the border into the Papal States and threatened with death if they returned.

Historian Charles Gibson calls the Spanish crown&#x27;s expulsion of the Jesuits a &quot;sudden and devastating move&quot; to assert royal control. However, the Jesuits became a vulnerable target for the crown&#x27;s moves to assert more control over the church; also, some religious and diocesan clergy and civil authorities were hostile to them, and they did not protest their expulsion.

In addition to 1767, the Jesuits were suppressed and banned twice more in Spain, in 1834 and 1932. Spanish ruler Francisco Franco rescinded the last suppression in 1938.

====Economic impact on the Spanish Empire====
The suppression of the order had longstanding economic effects in the Americas, particularly those areas where they had their missions or reductions – outlying areas dominated by indigenous peoples such as Paraguay and Chiloé Archipelago. In Misiones, in modern-day Argentina, their suppression led to the scattering and enslavement of indigenous Guaranís living in the reductions and a long-term decline in the yerba mate industry, from which it only recovered in the 20th century.

In Ocoa, Valparaíso Region, Chile, folklore says Jesuits left behind a large entierro following their suppression.

With the suppression of the Society of Jesus in Spanish America, Jesuit vineyards in Peru were auctioned, but new owners did not have the same expertise as the Jesuits, contributing to a decline in production of wine and pisco.

===Suppression in Malta===
Hospitaller Malta was at the time a vassal of the Kingdom of Sicily, and Grandmaster Manuel Pinto da Fonseca, himself a Portuguese, followed suit, expelling the Jesuits from the island and seizing their assets. These assets were used in establishing the University of Malta by a decree signed by Pinto on 22 November 1769, with a lasting effect on Malta&#x27;s social and cultural life. The Church of the Jesuits (in Maltese ), one of the oldest churches in Valletta, retains this name up to the present.

===Expulsion from the Duchy of Parma===
The independent Duchy of Parma was the smallest Bourbon court. So aggressive in its anti-clericalism was the Parmesan reaction to the news of the expulsion of the Jesuits from Naples, that Pope Clement XIII addressed a public warning against it on 30 January 1768, threatening the Duchy with ecclesiastical censures. At this, all the Bourbon courts turned against the Holy See, demanding the entire dissolution of the Jesuits. Parma expelled the Jesuits from its territories, confiscating their possessions.

===Dissolution in Poland and Lithuania===
The Jesuit order was disbanded in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1773. However, in the territories occupied by the Russian Empire in the First Partition of Poland the Society was not disbanded, as Russian Empress Catherine the Great dismissed the papal decree. In the Commonwealth, many of the Society&#x27;s possessions were taken over by the Commission of National Education, the world&#x27;s first Ministry of Education. Lithuania complied with the suppression.

==Papal suppression of 1773==
After the suppression of the Jesuits in many European countries and their overseas empires, Pope Clement XIV issued a papal brief on 21 July 1773 in Rome titled &quot;Dominus ac Redemptor Noster&quot;. That decree included the following statement.

===Resistance in Belgium===
After papal suppression in 1773, the scholarly Jesuit Society of Bollandists moved from Antwerp to Brussels, where they continued their work in the monastery of the Coudenberg; in 1788, the Bollandist Society was suppressed by the Austrian government of the Low Countries.

===Continued Jesuit work in Prussia===
Frederick the Great of Prussia refused to allow the papal document of suppression to be distributed in his country. The order continued in Prussia for several years after the suppression, although it had dissolved before the 1814 restoration.

===Continued work in North America===
Many individual Jesuits continued their work as Jesuits in Quebec, although the last one died in 1800. The 21 Jesuits living in North America signed a document offering their submission to Rome in 1774. In the United States, schools and colleges continued to be run and founded by Jesuits.

===Russian resistance to suppression===
In Imperial Russia, Catherine the Great refused to allow the papal document of suppression to be distributed and even openly defended the Jesuits from dissolution. The Jesuit chapter in Belarus received her patronage. It ordained priests, operated schools, and opened housing for novitiates and tertianships. Catherine&#x27;s successor, Paul I, successfully asked Pope Pius VII in 1801 for formal approval of the Jesuit operation in Russia. The Jesuits, led first by Franciszek Kareu, a Polish Welshman, followed by the Austrian Slovene, Gabriel Gruber and after his death by Tadeusz Brzozowski, continued to expand in Russia under Alexander I, adding missions and schools in Astrakhan, Moscow, Riga, Saratov, and St. Petersburg and throughout the Caucasus and Siberia. Many former Jesuits throughout Europe traveled to Russia to join the sanctioned order there.

Alexander I withdrew his patronage of the Jesuits in 1812, but with the restoration of the Society in 1814, that only temporarily affected the order. Alexander eventually expelled all Jesuits from Imperial Russia in March 1820.

===Russian patronage of restoration in Europe and North America===
Under the patronage of the &quot;Russian Society&quot;, Jesuit provinces were effectively reconstituted in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1803 (having been prohibited in England by the Jesuits, etc. Act 1584), the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1803, and the United States in 1805. &quot;Russian&quot; chapters were also formed in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

===Acquiescence in Austria and Hungary===
The Secularization Decree of Joseph II (Holy Roman Emperor from 1765 to 1790 and ruler of the Habsburg lands from 1780 to 1790) issued on 12 January 1782 for Austria and Hungary banned several monastic orders not involved in teaching or healing. It liquidated 140 monasteries (home to 1484 monks and 190 nuns). The banned monastic orders included Jesuits, Camaldolese, Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, Carmelites, Carthusians, Poor Clares, Order of Saint Benedict, Cistercians, Dominican Order (Order of Preachers), Franciscans, Pauline Fathers and Premonstratensians, and their wealth was taken over by the Religious Fund.

His anti-clerical and liberal innovations induced Pope Pius VI to visit Joseph II in March 1782. He received the Pope politely and presented himself as a good Catholic but refused to be influenced.

==Restoration of the Jesuits==
As the Napoleonic Wars were approaching their end in 1814, the old political order of Europe was to a considerable extent restored at the Congress of Vienna after years of fighting and revolution, during which the Church had been persecuted as an agent of the old order and abused under the rule of Napoleon. With the political climate of Europe changed, and with the powerful monarchs who had called for the suppression of the Society no longer in power, Pope Pius VII issued an order restoring the Society of Jesus in the Catholic countries of Europe. For its part, the Society of Jesus decided at the first General Congregation held after the restoration to keep the organization of the Society as it had been before the suppression was ordered in 1773.

After 1815, with the Restoration, the Catholic Church again began to play a more welcome role in European political life. Nation by nation, the Jesuits became re-established.

== Assessment ==
The modern view is that the order&#x27;s suppression resulted from political and economic conflicts rather than a theological controversy and the assertion of nation-state independence against the Catholic Church. The expulsion of the Society of Jesus from the Catholic nations of Europe and their colonial empires is also seen as one of the early manifestations of the new secularist &quot;zeitgeist&quot; of the Enlightenment. It peaked with the anti-clericalism of the French Revolution. The suppression was also seen as an attempt by monarchs to gain control of revenues and trade that the Society of Jesus previously dominated. Catholic historians often point to a personal conflict between Pope Clement XIII (1758–1769) and his supporters within the church and the crown cardinals backed by France.

<text>The July Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to two-year-old colts and geldings. It is run on the July Course at Newmarket over a distance of 6 furlongs (1,207 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in July.

==History==
The July Stakes is the oldest surviving event for two-year-olds in the British flat racing calendar. It was established in 1786, and it was originally open to horses of either gender. The conditions initially stipulated that those horses sired by Eclipse or Highflyer should carry an additional weight of three pounds.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and for a period the July Stakes was classed at Group 3 level. The event was restricted to colts and geldings in 1977, and it was promoted to Group 2 status in 2003.

The July Stakes is currently held on the opening day of Newmarket&#x27;s three-day July Festival meeting. The equivalent race for fillies is the Duchess of Cambridge Stakes.

<doc id="741970" wikidata="Q390522" url="?curid=741970" title="Mojave Air and Space Port">
<text>The Mojave Air and Space Port at Rutan Field is in Mojave, California, United States, at an elevation of . It is the first facility to be licensed in the United States for horizontal launches of reusable spacecraft, being certified as a spaceport by the Federal Aviation Administration on June 17, 2004. The facility covers 2,998 acres (1,213 ha) and has three runways.

==History==
In 1935, Kern County opened the Mojave Airport east of Mojave, California to serve the gold and silver mining industry in the area. The airport had two dirt runways, one oiled, but no fueling or servicing facilities. In 1941, the Civil Aeronautics Board began improvements to the airport for national defense purposes that included two asphalt runways and a taxiway. Kern County agreed the airport could be taken over by the military in the event of war.

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the United States Marine Corps took over the airport and expanded it into Marine Corps Auxiliary Air Station (MCAAS) Mojave. The two runways were extended and a third one added. Barracks were constructed to house 2,734 male and 376 female military personnel. The expansion of MCAAS Mojave was done by Vinson &amp; Pringle and Del E. Webb Construction Company out of Phoenix, Arizona. Civilian employment at the base would peak at 176. The Marines would eventually spend more than $7 million on the base, which totaled .

Many of the Corps&#x27; World War II aces received their gunnery training at Mojave. During World War II, Mojave hosted 29 aircraft squadrons, four Carrier Aircraft Service Detachments, and three Air Warning Squadrons. At its peak, the air station had 145 training and other aircraft. Mojave also had a 75 x 156 foot swimming pool that was used to train aviators in emergency water egress and for recreation. The base&#x27;s 900-seat auditorium hosted several USO shows that featured Bob Hope, Frances Langford and Marilyn Maxwell.

With the end of World War II, MCAAS was disestablished on February 7, 1946; a United States Navy Air Station (NAS) was established the same day. The Navy used the airport for drone operations for less than a year, closing it on January 1, 1947. The base remained closed for four years until the outbreak of the Korean War. Mojave was reactivated as an auxiliary landing field to MCAS El Toro.

In 1951, scenes from the movie &quot;The Las Vegas Story&quot; were filmed at the deserted airport. A helicopter chased a car around the base, at several points flying at speed through an open-ended hangar. The control tower shown on the RHS of this article was featured at the climax of the chase. According to the American Film Institute (AFI), the &quot;location shooting took place ..., at the Moroc Naval Air Base near Mojave, CA, ...&quot;.

On 22 August 1951, the 11th Naval District announced the award to R. R. Hensler, of Sun Valley, of a $1.307 million contract for the extension and strengthening of the runway at the Marine Corps auxiliary airfield.

The airport was recommissioned as a MCAAS on December 31, 1953. Squadrons used Mojave for ordnance training when El Toro had bad weather. Marine Corps reserve units were temporarily deployed to Mojave for two-week periods. MCAAS Mojave personnel peaked at 400 military and 200 civilians during this period.

In 1961, after the Marine Corps transferred operations to MCAS El Centro, Kern County obtained title to the airport. In February 1972, the East Kern Airport District (EKAD) was formed to administer the airport; EKAD maintains the airport to this day. To a great extent EKAD was the brainchild of Kern County rancher and aviator Dan Sabovich, who heavily lobbied the state for the airport district&#x27;s creation and ran EKAD until 2002.

From 1974 to 1979, Golden West Airlines scheduled flights on de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters direct to Los Angeles (LAX).

On November 20, 2012, the EKAD Board of Directors voted to change the name of the district to the Mojave Air and Space Port. Officials said that the spaceport name is well known around the world, but EKAD is not. The change took effect on January 1, 2013.

In 2022, &quot;Rutan Field&quot; was added to the airport&#x27;s name in honor of the Rutan brothers (Burt and Dick), its board stating that the Rutans&#x27; aviation achievements &quot;have played a key role in the evolution of the aerospace industry and the success of the Mojave Air &amp; Space Port organization.&quot;

==Activities==
Besides being a general-use public airport, Mojave has three main areas of activity: flight testing, space industry development, and aircraft heavy maintenance and storage.

===Air racing===
The airport has a rich history in air racing. In 1970, a 1,000-mile (1,600 km) Unlimited race was held—the first closed-course pylon race to include pit stops. The race was notable in that it featured a DC-7 that flew non-stop and finished sixth out of twenty aircraft. The race was won by Sherm Cooper in a highly modified Hawker Sea Fury which also flew non-stop. The following year the race was shortened to , and was again won by a Hawker Sea Fury, this time flown by Frank Sanders. From 1973 to 1979 Air Race Management (run by famed race pilots Clay Lacy and Lyle Shelton) organized a series of Reno-syle races at Mojave featuring Unlimiteds, T-6&#x27;s, Formula-1&#x27;s, and Biplanes. In 1973 and &#x27;74, the program also included jet races. Unlimited winners at Mojave included Lyle Shelton in 1973, Mac McClain in 1974 and 1976, Dr. Cliff Cummins in 1975, and Steve Hinton in 1978 and &#x27;79. The races at Mojave were hampered by constant winds, and extreme temperatures. In the 2000s, California HWY 58 was extended to bypass the town of Mojave, which cut directly across the race course—thus precluding any future racing events on the site. In 1983, Frank Taylor set the 15 kilometer (9.3 mile) closed-course speed record at at Mojave in the P-51 Dago Red. Over the years, several notable teams have been based out of Mojave.

In 1990 Scaled Composites rolled out the radical Pond Racer, built and tested on-site. In the mid-1990s, the Museum of Flying based its two racers Dago Red and Stiletto out of Mojave as well. Since the early 1980s, the Wildfire (a custom-built Unlimited based around a T-6 airframe designed by William H. Statler) has slowly been developed in a Mojave hangar. Ralph Wise&#x27;s many air racing projects, including the Sport Class Legal GT400 and his V-8 powered unlimited, the GT500, both were designed and built at Mojave (the GT500 spent its early life at Camarillo). The GT 400 Quicksilver ultralight program is also based out of Mojave.

===Flight testing===
Flight testing activities have been centered at Mojave since the early 1970s, due to the lack of populated areas surrounding the airport. It is also favored for this purpose due to its proximity to Edwards Air Force Base, where the airspace is restricted from ground level to an unlimited height, and where there is a supersonic corridor. Mojave is also the home of the National Test Pilot School, Scaled Composites and Virgin Galactic/The Spaceship Company.

===Space industry development===
Beginning with the Rotary Rocket program, Mojave became a focus for small companies seeking a place to develop space access technologies. Mojave Spaceport has been a test site for several teams in the Ansari X Prize, most notably the Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne, which conducted the first privately funded human sub-orbital flight on June 21, 2004. Other groups based at the Mojave Spaceport include or have included XCOR Aerospace, Masten Space Systems, Virgin Galactic, The Spaceship Company, Stratolaunch Systems, and Firestar Technologies.
Other companies with operations at Mojave include or have included Orbital Sciences Corporation, Vector Launch and Interorbital Systems.

The East Kern Airport District was given spaceport status by the Federal Aviation Administration for the Mojave Air and Spaceport through June 16, 2019.

===Aircraft heavy maintenance, storage, and event center===
The Mojave airport is also known as a storage location for commercial airliners, due to the vast area and dry desert conditions. Numerous Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed, and Airbus jetliners, including wide-body aircraft previously or currently owned by major domestic and international airlines, are stored at Mojave. Some aircraft reach the end of their useful lifetime and are scrapped at the Mojave aircraft boneyard, while others are refurbished and returned to active service.

The airport refurbished an old United States Marine Corps hangar from the World War II era into a modern event center. It was previously used for water survival training then transformed into the Stuart O. Witt Event Center with over of multi-use space.

<text>The Princess of Wales&#x27;s Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run on the July Course at Newmarket over a distance of 1 mile and 4 furlongs (2,414 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in July.

==History==
The event is named in honour of Alexandra of Denmark, who became the Princess of Wales in 1863. It was established in 1894, and the inaugural running was won by Isinglass. In its early history, the race was one of the British season&#x27;s most valuable and prestigious all-aged races. It was initially contested over a mile, and it was extended to its current distance in 1902.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and for a period the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Stakes was classed at Group 3 level. It was promoted to Group 2 status in 1978. It is now held on the opening day of Newmarket&#x27;s three-day July Festival meeting.

<text>The Southern Highlands, also locally referred to as the Highlands, is a geographical region and district in New South Wales, Australia and is 110 km south-west of Sydney. The region comprises the local government area of the Wingecarribee Shire and also towns of the Mulwaree Shire. The region is also considered a wine region.

The region specifically is the area centred on the commercial towns of Mittagong, Bowral, Moss Vale, Bundanoon and Robertson as well as the historic town of Berrima. Smaller villages like Burradoo, Sutton Forest, Colo Vale, Avoca, Yerrinbool, Exeter, Welby and many more that make up the Wingecarribee Shire are spread in between and around these main centres and serve mostly as residential areas.

The Highlands geographically sits between 500 m and 900 m above sea level on the Great Dividing Range. Like other regions along this plateau such as the Blue Mountains to the north and the Australian Alps to the south, the Southern Highlands is known for its cool temperate climate. The Southern Highlands Shale Forest and Woodland and Blue Mountains and Southern Highlands Basalt Forests vegetation communities lie primarily within the region.

The Southern Highlands as a region is part of the larger Capital Country Region with the Highlands forming the northern part of the region and the Southern Tablelands forming the southern part of the region.

==Demographics==

The Southern Highland&#x27;s council, Wingecarribee Shire, is home to about 44,379 (2006) residents and is growing at a rate of 2.1% per annum. The majority of the residents (84.5%) are Australian-born with the minority of the population being (15%) born overseas, primarily Europe. The population density of the Highlands is 16.5 persons/km2.

==Local attractions==

The facility is a 500m long and 25m high walk facility that opened in mid-2008. The project is similar to the Otway Fly Tree Top Walk in Victoria, Australia. The project consists of a 1500m walk.

Other views include Wollongong, Lake Illawarra, Tasman Sea, Shellharbour, Kiama and other localities of the South Coast, as well as various localities of the Southern Highlands, the Illawarra Escarpment and Budderoo National Park.

===Joadja===

Joadja is a historic abandoned ghost town about 32 km west of Mittagong. The town was established in the 1870s by the Australian Kerosene Oil and Mineral Company as Joadja valley&#x27;s walls contained a vast reserve of shale. Notably, the town back in its time was one of the most populous towns in the Highlands. However, at the turn of the century when the shale ran out, the town&#x27;s population began to dwindle and the town would be eventually abandoned by the early 1900s.

Joadja at its height had a post office, theatre, general store, bakery, school of arts, refinery, railway line, miner&#x27;s cottages and many other buildings. Notably, it was one of the first rural towns in New South Wales to be connected to the telephone.

Joadja&#x27;s legacy still remains with many of the historical buildings remaining in ruin such as some of the miners&#x27; cottages, a school house, church, cemetery and refinery devices such as shale ovens. These ovens are protected and is World Heritage listed. 
Today, the Joadja Distillery produces Single Malt Whisky in honour of the Scottish mining families who worked the rich coal and shale seams in the late 1800s.

<text>The Scottish Derby was a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to thoroughbreds aged three years or older. It was run at Ayr over a distance of 1 mile and 2 furlongs (2,012 metres), and it was scheduled to take place each year in July.

==History==
The event was established in 1979, and it was initially restricted to three-year-olds. The first edition was contested over 1 mile and 5 furlongs. It was shortened by two furlongs in 1980. It was cut by another furlong and opened to older horses in 1987.

The race was originally known as the Scottish Derby, but it was renamed the Scottish Classic in 1988. For a period it held Group 3 status. It reverted to its former title and was promoted to Group 2 level in 2003.

The Scottish Derby was last run in 2005. It was replaced the following year by a similar race, the York Stakes at York.

Over the course of twenty-seven runnings the event had several different sponsors. These included Mecca Bookmakers, Tennent&#x27;s and the Daily Record.

<doc id="741982" wikidata="Q2389533" url="?curid=741982" title="Pucikwar">
<text>The Pucikwar were one of the indigenous peoples of the Andaman Islands, one of the ten or so Great Andamanese tribes identified by British colonials in the 1860s. They spoke the Opucikwar dialect (also &#x27;A-Pucikwar&#x27;) which was closely related to the Okol dialect. The tribe disappeared as a distinct group sometime after 1931.

As the numbers of Great Andamanese progressively declined over the succeeding decades, the various Great Andamanese tribes either disappeared altogether or became amalgamated through intermarriage. By the 1901 census, the Pucikwar were reduced to 50, but distinctions between tribal groups and subgroups had become considerably blurred (and some intermarriage had also occurred with Indian and Karen (Burmese) settlers). By 1994, the 38 remaining Great Andamanese who could trace their ancestry and culture back to the original tribes belonged to only three of them (Jeru, Bo, and Cari).

<text>The Lennox Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at Goodwood over a distance of 7 furlongs (1,408 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late July or early August.

==History==
The event is named after the Duke of Lennox, one of the dukedoms held by the Duke of Richmond, the owner of Goodwood Racecourse. It was established in 2000, and the inaugural running was won by Observatory. It replaced the Beeswing Stakes, a discontinued race at Newcastle.

The Lennox Stakes was initially classed at Group 3 level, and it was promoted to Group 2 status in 2003. It was sponsored by Betfair from 2004 to 2010, and during this period it was known as the Betfair Cup. It was sponsored by Bet365 from 2011 to 2014.

The race is currently held on the opening day of the five-day Glorious Goodwood meeting.

<text>The Richmond Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to two-year-old colts and geldings. It is run at Goodwood over a distance of 6 furlongs (1,207 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late July or early August.

==History==
The event is named after the Duke of Richmond, one of the dukedoms held by the owner of Goodwood Racecourse. It was established in 1877, and it was originally open to horses of either gender. Six of the first eight winners were ridden by the jockey Fred Archer.

Several winners of the Richmond Stakes have gone on to win one or more of the following year&#x27;s Classics. The most recent was Palestine, the winner of the 2000 Guineas in 1950.

The Richmond Stakes was restricted to male horses in 1989. It was sponsored by Diageo in promotion of the Tanqueray brand from 2010 and 2011, by Audi in 2012 and 2013, and by Qatar Bloodstock since 2014.

The race is currently held on the third day of the five-day Glorious Goodwood meeting.

<doc id="741991" wikidata="Q4631586" url="?curid=741991" title="23 skidoo (phrase)">
<text>23 skidoo (sometimes 23 skiddoo) is an American slang phrase generally referring to leaving quickly, being forced to leave quickly by someone else, or taking advantage of a propitious opportunity to leave. Popularized during the early 20th century, the exact origin of the phrase is uncertain.

&quot;23 skidoo&quot; has been described as &quot;perhaps the first truly national fad expression and one of the most popular fad expressions to appear in the U.S&quot;, to the extent that &quot;Pennants and arm-bands at shore resorts, parks, and county fairs bore either [23] or the word &#x27;Skiddoo&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;23 skidoo&quot; combines two earlier expressions, &quot;twenty-three&quot; (1899) and &quot;skidoo&quot; (1901), both of which, independently and separately, referred to leaving, being kicked out, or the end of something. &quot;23 skidoo&quot; quickly became a popular catchphrase after its appearance in early 1906.

==Origin==
Although there are a number of stories suggesting the possible origin of the phrase, none has been universally accepted.

===Flatiron Building===
Perhaps the most widely known story of the origin of the expression concerns the area around the triangular-shaped Flatiron Building at Madison Square in New York City. The building is located on 23rd Street at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and Broadway, the latter two of which intersect at an acute angle. Because of the shape of the building, winds swirl around it. During the early 1900s, groups of men reportedly gathered to watch women walking by have their skirts blown up, revealing legs, which were seldom seen publicly at that time. Local constables, when sometimes telling such groups of men to leave the area, were said to be &quot;giving them the 23 Skidoo&quot;. An early nickelodeon film, &quot;What Happened on Twenty-third Street&quot;, which dates from 1901, shows a woman&#x27;s skirt being lifted by the updraft from a ventilation grate, exposing her knees.

Some consider the Flatiron Building origin claim dubious because the slang expressions &quot;23&quot; and &quot;skidoo&quot; were already in use before 1902, the year in which the Flatiron Building was built.

===&quot;23&quot; (or &quot;Twenty-Three&quot;)===
The earliest-known report of the slang expression &quot;23&quot; (or &quot;twenty-three&quot;) as a code word for asking someone to leave is a newspaper reference on March 17, 1899:
At the time, a stage version of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, &quot;The Only Way&quot;, was playing in London. The production moved to New York City later that year; it opened at the Herald Square Theatre on September 16, 1899. Less than two months later, popular slang author George Ade described having heard a new slang expression, &quot;twenty-three&quot;:
In the same interview, Ade described two purported origin stories he had heard: that it was &quot;from the English race tracks, twenty-three being the limit on the number of horses allowed to start in one race&quot; or that it had been a signal used in a plot to free a Mexican embezzler from custody in New Orleans.

===Skidoo===
&quot;Webster&#x27;s New World Dictionary&quot; derives &quot;skiddoo&quot; (with two d&#x27;s) as probably from &quot;skedaddle&quot;, meaning &quot;to leave&quot;, with an imperative sense.

The word &quot;Skidoo&quot; was the name of a &quot;Lark&quot;-class racing sailboat that competed in races on Long Island Sound during the 1901 racing season. The &quot;Skidoo&quot; competed every summer through at least 1904.

&quot;Skidoo&quot; is attested, in its conventional, slang sense, by 1904. &quot;Skidoo-wagon&quot; (as well as &quot;skidoodle wagon&quot; and &quot;skedaddle wagon&quot;) was a short-lived euphemism for automobiles during 1904–1905.

The word &quot;skidoo&quot;, used by itself as a noun denoting a supposed bringer of bad luck, is attested in the early 1910s, in P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s &quot;Psmith, Journalist&quot;. It appeared in newspapers as early as 1906.

===Twenty-three, skidoo!===
Both of the slang expressions, &quot;23&quot; and &quot;skidoo&quot;, were used in George M. Cohan&#x27;s 1904 musical play &quot;Little Johnny Jones&quot;. Numerous news items from the period credited either Cohan or Tom Lewis (the actor performing the role that spoke those lines in the play) with creating or popularizing one or both of the expressions. Even before the expression &quot;23, skidoo!&quot; became popular in its own right, &quot;23&quot; (or &quot;twenty-three&quot;) and &quot;skidoo&quot; were frequently used in conjunction with, or near, one another in the same sentence or paragraph; &quot;23&quot; often as part of the phrase &quot;23 for you [or yours].&quot; For example, &quot;Skiddoo! Git! Twenty-three for yours!&quot;, or &quot;Twenty-three for his! Skidoo.&quot;

The earliest known use of the expression, in the familiar &quot;23, skidoo!&quot; form, is an advertisement for Billy B. Van&#x27;s show &quot;The Errand Boy&quot;: The phrase quickly became a ubiquitous catchphrase, and Google Books has many examples of commercial advertisements using &quot;23-Skidoo&quot; that begin in 1906. For example, the edition of &quot;The Shoe Retailer&quot; for August 4, 1906, volume 59, No. 5 (Boston, MA), has a full-page ad for a &quot;23-Skidoo&quot; sale, with blurbs such as &quot;23-Skidoo/Says Low Price to the Shoe/Now It&#x27;s Up to You&quot;.

On the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; there was a watertight door on E Deck numbered 23 which was informally called the &quot;skidoo door&quot; according to the testimony of the Chief Baker Charles John Joughin.

===Other explanations===
* Cartoonist &quot;TAD&quot; (Thomas A. Dorgan) was credited in his 1929 obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as being the &quot;First to say &#x27;Twenty-three, Skidoo.&#x27;&quot; 
* Baseball player Mike Donlin and comedian Tom Lewis may have created the expression as part of their vaudeville act.
* An article in the June 26, 1906 &quot;New York American&quot; credits the phrase to one Patsey Marlson, then a former jockey hauled into court on a misdemeanor charge. At his hearing, Marlson is asked by the judge how the expression came about. He explains that when he was a jockey, he worked at a track which only had room for 22 horses to start in a line. If a 23rd horse was added, the long shot would be lined up behind the 22 horses on the front line. Apparently, &quot;23 skidoo&quot; implied that if the horse in the back was to have any chance of winning, it would really have to run very fast. Marlson also says in the article that the expression was originally &quot;23, skidoo for you.&quot;
* A parody of Henry Miller&#x27;s well-regarded stage presentation of Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; may have also been the beginning of the phrase. Miller&#x27;s 1899 production, entitled &quot;The Only Way&quot;, was staged at the Herald Square Theatre. The final scene of the play portrays a series of executions at a guillotine. As each person is beheaded, an old woman counts. When Sydney Carton, the protagonist of the story, is beheaded, the old woman calls out &quot;Twenty-three!&quot; The grisly scene was remarkable for its time, but it soon became the subject for parody, and the phrase &quot;Twenty-three, skidoo!&quot; was used by Broadway comedians to parody this moment. This seems likely to be an instance of comedians using an already-popular slang juxtaposed against a well-known dramatic moment for the resulting comic effect, and not an indication of invention, although the theatrical usage may have popularized the expression, or made it more widely known.
* It is said that &quot;23&quot; was an old Morse code signal used by telegraph operators to mean &quot;away with you.&quot; (The same story accounts for &quot;30&quot; as &quot;end of transmission&quot;, a code still used by modern journalists in North America, who place &quot;-30-&quot; at the end of articles as a sign to editors. However, the Western Union &quot;92 Code&quot;, which is the source of &quot;30&quot; and other numbers like &quot;73&quot; and &quot;88&quot; still used in amateur radio, lists &quot;23&quot; as &quot;all stations copy&quot;.)
* An early 1900s Death Valley town had 23 saloons (many basically tents). A visit to all, &quot;going 23 skidoo&quot;, meant having a very good time.
* Death Valley National Park interpreters have sometimes given as an explanation that the early 1900s mining town of Skidoo, California required that a water line be run from the source of water on Telescope Peak to the town – a distance of 23 miles. Most thought it would be easy, but the immensely hard rock along the course made it very difficult; it was eventually accomplished by a determined engineer. The term &quot;23 Skidoo&quot; was then used as a statement of irony, something like &quot;duck soup&quot;: a reference to something apparently easy, but actually very difficult. Other interpreters simply say the 23 mile pipeline and the popular slang phrase is what gave the town its name.
* A jump rope rhyme that ended up &quot;butterfly, butterfly, twenty three to do&quot; dates to 1909 and may be the origin of this phrase.
* In &quot;The Literature of Slang&quot; (p. 38), W.J. Burke claims that the term &quot;skidoo&quot; was coined in 1906 by the musical comedy star Billy B. Van, citing an article in the &quot;Indianapolis Morning Star&quot;, March 31, 1906.
* In the book &quot;The Age of Uncertainty&quot; by John Kenneth Galbraith (Houghton Mifflin, 1977), Skidoo 23 refers to the abandonment of a town, Skidoo, in the Panamint Mountains of Death Valley National Park in California in the early 1900s. The number 23 apparently refers to the number of miles water had to be piped to the town and its sole reason for being: the mining of gold. After the mines were depleted, the town ceased to exist.
* In the book &quot;The Confessions of a Con Man as Told to Will Irwin&quot; by Will Irwin (B. W. Huebsch (New York) 1913), 23 relates to a rigged dice game called a &quot;cloth&quot; that travelled with small American circuses and carnivals in the latter part of the 19th century. It referred to a square marked &quot;23 You Lose&quot; on the cloth which had 48 printed squares but only the one &quot;You Lose&quot; square. After making a big bet, the sucker was at some point persuaded that he had rolled a 23, had thereby lost his money and should stop squawking and beat it. This became, by a logical extension, an in-crowd, underworld expression indicating that for whatever reason the person addressed would not get what he was seeking and should clear out.

<text>The Vintage Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to two-year-old horses. It is run at Goodwood over a distance of 7 furlongs (1,408 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late July or early August.

==History==
The event was established in 1975, and it was originally classed at Listed level. During the early part of its history it was sponsored by Lanson and known as the Lanson Champagne Vintage Stakes. It was given Group 3 status in 1986.

The Vintage Stakes was promoted to Group 2 level in 2003, and from this point it was sponsored by Veuve Clicquot. It is currently held on the opening day of the five-day Glorious Goodwood meeting.

Several winners of the Vintage Stakes have gone on to achieve victory in one of the following year&#x27;s Classics. The most recent was Galileo Gold, the winner of the 2000 Guineas in 2016.

<text>John Joseph Scanlan (May 24, 1906 – January 31, 1997) was an American Prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as the second bishop of the Diocese of Honolulu in Hawaii from 1968 to 1981. He previously served as an auxiliary bishop of the same diocese from 1954 to 1968.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
John Scanlan was born on May 24, 1906, in Iniscarra in County Cork, Ireland. He trained at All Hallows College in Dublin. Scanlan was ordained by Bishop John Francis Norton for the Archdiocese of San Francisco on June 22, 1930, in Dublin. After his ordination, Scanlan served in pastoral positions at parishes in Oakland, Berkeley and San Jose. He directed the Archdiocesan Council of Catholic Men and taught religion in high school.

<doc id="741997" wikidata="Q4812547" url="?curid=741997" title="At the Movies (1986 TV program)">
<text>At the Movies (originally Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies, and later At the Movies with Ebert and Roeper) was an American movie review television program produced by Disney–ABC Domestic Television in which two film critics share their opinions of newly released films. Its original hosts were Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, the former hosts of &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; on PBS (1975–1982) and a similarly titled syndicated series (1982–1986). After Siskel died in 1999, Ebert worked with various guest critics until choosing &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; colleague Richard Roeper as his regular partner in 2000.

Ebert suspended his appearances in 2006 for treatment of thyroid cancer, with various guest hosts substituting for him. From April to August 2008 Michael Phillips, a successor of Siskel at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, co-hosted with Roeper. Starting on September 6, 2008, Ben Lyons and Ben Mankiewicz took over as hosts; their partnership lasted only one season. On August 5, 2009, it was announced that Phillips would return to the show as a permanent co-host, teaming with A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; for what would be the program&#x27;s final season.

During its run with Siskel and Ebert as hosts, the series was nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards seven times and also for Outstanding Information Series, the last nomination occurring in 1997. It was widely known for the &quot;thumbs up/thumbs down&quot; review summaries given during Siskel&#x27;s and Ebert&#x27;s tenures (this was dropped after Ebert ended his association with the program, as the phrase &quot;Two Thumbs Up&quot; is a trademark held by the Siskel and Ebert families). The show aired in syndication in the United States and on CTV in Canada; it also aired throughout the week on the cable network ReelzChannel.

The show&#x27;s cancellation was announced on March 24, 2010, and the last episode was aired during the weekend of August 14–15, 2010. The next month, Ebert announced a new version of &quot;At the Movies&quot;, which launched on public television on January 21, 2011. The series went on permanent hiatus at the end of 2011 due to lack of financial underwriting and then Ebert&#x27;s death on April 4, 2013.

==Broadcast history==

===Predecessors===
The show&#x27;s origins and format trace back to &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; (1975), a PBS series produced by WTTW that originally featured Ebert and Siskel, and &quot;At the Movies&quot;, a follow-up show that the two created with Tribune Entertainment.

===&quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot; (1986–1987)===
The series itself began in September 1986 as &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot;, when Siskel and Ebert signed with Buena Vista Entertainment, the television division of the Walt Disney Company.

===&quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot; (1987–1999)===
The show&#x27;s title was shortened to simply &quot;Siskel and Ebert&quot; in mid-1987. The program was originally recorded in the studios of WBBM-TV, Chicago&#x27;s CBS owned-and-operated station. In August 2001, a few years after Disney&#x27;s 1996 purchase of Capital Cities/ABC, the show&#x27;s tapings were moved to ABC&#x27;s Chicago station, WLS-TV, where it remained for its duration.

Siskel and Ebert often had notably divergent tastes, and as a result, heated arguments and spats that added to the series&#x27;s popularity. Many viewers considered such &quot;fights&quot; the highlight of the program. In joint appearances on the talk show circuit, especially David Letterman&#x27;s NBC and CBS shows, the two critics indicated a mutual respect and friendship off screen. Widely circulated outtakes from promo-recording sessions show the two both bickering and joking off-air.

In 1998, Siskel was hospitalized for treatment of a brain tumor. For a few weeks, the show was taped with Siskel on the telephone (from his hospital bed) and Ebert in the studio. Siskel eventually returned to the studio, but he seemed noticeably more lethargic and mellow. In February 1999, he announced he was taking a leave of absence for further treatment of the tumor, hoping to return. Less than three weeks later, Siskel died from complications of the surgery. The weekend after Siskel&#x27;s death, Ebert devoted the entire half-hour to a tribute to him. On the show were various clips from shows past as well as their history together as journalists and then on television. Ebert also appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; in a tribute to Siskel along with Diane Sawyer, Charles Gibson, Peter Jennings, and Joel Siegel, fellow critic and friend of Siskel.

The last show that Siskel and Ebert hosted together aired during the weekend of January 23–24, 1999. On that show, they reviewed &quot;At First Sight&quot;, &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot;, &quot;The Hi-Lo Country&quot;, &quot;Playing by Heart&quot;, and &quot;The Theory of Flight&quot;.

===&quot;Roger Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot; (1999–2000)===

Ebert continued the show with a series of guest critics. Originally retaining the &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot; title, the program was renamed &quot;Roger Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot; on the weekend of September 4–5, 1999, after Siskel&#x27;s death. The guests matched wits with Ebert and tested their chemistry. Ebert and film director Martin Scorsese co-hosted one noteworthy episode about the best films of the 1990s. This format continued through the end of the 1998–99 season and into 2000 before Ebert named fellow &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; columnist Richard Roeper as his permanent co-host.

====Critics substituting for Gene Siskel after his death====

* Kenneth Turan

* Michael Wilmington
===&quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper and the Movies&quot; (2000–2001)===

The addition of Roeper as permanent co-host led to the show&#x27;s name change on September 9–10, 2000 to &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper and the Movies&quot;. The show&#x27;s name was shortened to &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot; in September 2001.

===&quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot; (2001–2007)===
With the rebranding to &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot; in 2001, the series gained a new set, replacing the one that had been used since its 1986 debut.

In 2002, Ebert was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and underwent radiation treatments for tumors on his thyroid and a salivary gland while continuing to work. Complications led to an emergency operation in 2006, which interrupted his reviewing schedule. (A few reviews written or taped in advance were released shortly afterward.) For the remainder of the 2006–07 season, the show continued with guest hosts during his recuperation.

By October 2006, Ebert had recovered sufficiently to resume writing published reviews on a limited basis and later he was able to make a few public appearances, but due to his difficulty speaking, he did not return to the show. As Ebert&#x27;s doctors attempted to reconstruct his jawbone, his face and neck became increasingly malformed with each surgery. Television being a distinctly visual medium, this put the producers on edge. They worried that Ebert&#x27;s disfigurement would produce a decline in viewership and lower ratings. The show became available online toward the end of 2006, with access to movie reviews on demand. In June 2007, the online program updated its archive, making available all movie reviews since 1986. After the show&#x27;s cancellation in 2010, the archive and site were shut down.

===&quot;At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot; (2007–2008)===

Over the summer of 2007, the show&#x27;s official name was changed again to At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper, although the show&#x27;s main title graphics continued to use the shortened name.

As Ebert&#x27;s absence from the show continued, a handful of critics became frequent guests. Robert Wilonsky of the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; and HDnet.com, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Michael Phillips, and A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; appeared repeatedly. On April 13, 2008, Scott wrote that his &quot;experiences [as guest critic]... ended when Michael Phillips of &quot;The Tribune&quot; was made Mr. Roeper&#x27;s permanent foil&quot;. Phillips remained Roeper&#x27;s cohost until Roeper and Ebert ended their relationship with the series in August 2008. The pair&#x27;s final appearance together occurred in an episode of &quot;Entourage&quot; that aired on September 6, 2008 (during the weekend the new version of &quot;At the Movies&quot; debuted), in which they played themselves using their show (filmed on the old sets) to lambast the fictional film &quot;Medellin&quot;.

The iconic balcony sets, which existed for decades, were dismantled and destroyed. Ebert had been under the impression that they would be donated to the Smithsonian.

===&quot;At the Movies&quot; (2008–2010)===
====Lyons and Mankiewicz (2008–2009)====
On July 21, 2008, Roeper announced that he was leaving the show after he and Disney-ABC Domestic Television did not reach an agreement on a new contract. His last show aired on the weekend of August 16. The same day, Ebert announced on his website that Disney had &quot;decided to take the program... in a new direction&quot; and that he would therefore no longer be associated with the show. Both Ebert and Roeper hinted at returning for a new show that would continue the format Ebert and Siskel devised. The next day, Disney announced that Ben Lyons (whose father, Jeffrey Lyons succeeded Ebert and Siskel on &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;) and Ben Mankiewicz would take over as the new hosts of &quot;At the Movies&quot; beginning on September 6–7, 2008. The intention was that Lyons and Mankiewicz would take the show in a new direction, hoping to widen the viewership and appeal to younger audiences. The show generally maintained the same format, with one of the two critics presenting a film, leading to a discussion of its merits.

The &quot;See It/Skip It/Rent It&quot; review thumbnails, the DVD recommendations, and the &quot;3 to See&quot; segment were retained. For some films, the show used a new &quot;Critics Roundup&quot; segment (see below). In addition, instead of the traditional &quot;The balcony is closed&quot; sign-off, one of the hosts said, &quot;We&#x27;ll be at the movies,&quot; which echoed the &quot;We&#x27;ll see you at the movies&quot; sign-off from the first seven seasons of &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; and the Tribune Entertainment-produced &quot;At the Movies&quot;. The show also featured a new upbeat theme arrangement and brighter color scheme. An attempt to enliven film clips during reviews by filling clip letterboxes with coloring was discontinued after the first two episodes due to viewer complaints.

During Lyons&#x27;s tenure on &quot;At the Movies&quot;, he was criticized for his perceived lack of understanding of films and film history and use of positively phrased quotes (sound bites) that appeared tailored for use in ads (and increasing his media profile), and for conflicts of interest in posing for photographs with actors whose movies he later reviewed. Without mentioning Ben Lyons by name, Ebert wrote a general commentary on ethical standards for film critics that other commentators interpreted as critical of Lyons and responding to comparisons of Ebert and Lyons. Ebert later acknowledged that Lyons was the subject of the commentary.

During the first two months of Lyons &amp; Mankiewicz&#x27;s first and only season, ratings for the show slumped 23% to 1.7 total million viewers, compared with same period during Roeper&#x27;s final season as host, according to figures from Nielsen Media Research, with the program off 25% among the crucial category of adults 25 to 34 (from a 0.8 rating to a 0.6).

====Scott and Phillips (2009–2010)====
On August 5, 2009, ABC announced that Lyons and Mankiewicz had been dropped from the series due to low ratings, with A. O. Scott and Michael Phillips returning to the series as the program&#x27;s new permanent critics. After rerunning the &quot;Two Bens&#x27;&quot; final programs for two weeks, the first program with Scott and Phillips premiered on September 5–6, 2009. The program returned to most of its former structure in the &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot; era (reviews, the DVD roundup, and &quot;Three to See&quot;), and the &quot;Critics Roundup&quot; segment was fully discontinued. The recap segment moved to within the closing credits sequence; the &quot;we&#x27;ll be at the movies&quot; sign-off remained. The theme music was changed to resemble to the &quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot; theme more (originally, this theme was used after Siskel died, during the period when Ebert was using different co-hosts).

====Cancellation and replacement====
On March 24, 2010, Disney announced that &quot;At the Movies&quot; was being canceled, ending 24 seasons of national syndication on August 14–15, 2010. The final episode included reviews of &quot;Eat Pray Love&quot;, &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;, and &quot;The Expendables&quot;.

The same day the cancellation was announced, Ebert announced he was &quot;deeply involved&quot; in talks to produce a new film review program called &quot;Ebert Presents: At the Movies&quot;, which would make use of the &quot;Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down&quot; formula he and Siskel introduced. WTTW in Chicago, where Siskel and Ebert had their start, picked up the show, and began to nationally syndicate it on public television on January 21, 2011. The show also aired worldwide on the Armed Forces Network. Its principal co-hosts were originally announced as Christy Lemire of the &quot;Associated Press&quot; and Elvis Mitchell of &quot;National Public Radio&quot;. Mitchell was dropped before the new series entered regular production; his replacement was Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of &quot;Mubi&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;. Also, Ebert announced that regular contributors and occasional co-hosts would be Kim Morgan and Omar Moore, both respected and popular film bloggers. Ebert himself hosted a segment called &quot;Roger&#x27;s Office&quot;, in which he used a computer voice or guest narrator to review movies or to talk about the industry; he did not debate the hosts or use the &quot;Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down&quot; method himself for the same film in the same episode as Lemire and Vishnevetsky: &quot;They&#x27;ll be awarding the Thumbs, and you can&#x27;t have three Thumbs.&quot; As it became more common for Ebert to give solo reviews for films that did not screen in time for the main critics to discuss, he started ending his positive reviews with a thumbs-up. For a time, negative Ebert reviews still received no thumb but later began receiving a thumbs-down. The last show of that program aired on December 30, 2011.

==Review style==
The hosts reviewed a number of recently released and soon-to-be-released movies per episode, taking turns providing a narrative critique interspersed with studio-supplied clips, moving into a back-and-forth debate over the merits. Siskel and Ebert were especially known for sharp criticism that veered close to personally attacking each other, although they insisted this was largely a television act rather than a feud.

The show also recommended films coming on the home video market, including comments on DVD special features.

Reviews from the week&#x27;s show were posted on the website, atthemoviestv.com, usually on the Tuesday following the show&#x27;s airing. The site&#x27;s archives had reviews as far back as the latter half of the 1980s. However, only the reviews for theatrical movies got posted on the web site; the weekly DVD feature and &quot;3 to See&quot; segments did not.

==Review trademarks==

===Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down===
Since 1981 (as a test run, used permanently since the Tribune &quot;At The Movies&quot; incarnation in 1982), show reviewers would approve/disapprove the films they reviewed with a &quot;thumbs up&quot; or &quot;thumbs down&quot; as a bottom-line recommendation on whether to see a reviewed movie or not. This system departed from the longstanding tradition of ratings with a number of stars or other symbols. As the show became more influential, studios would proudly advertise when their movie got &quot;two thumbs up&quot;. In response, the phrase was trademarked in 1995 to ensure against fraudulent use that would endanger its credibility. The critics frequently qualify their recommendations (e.g., &quot;a mild thumbs up&quot; or &quot;two thumbs way down&quot;) in their remarks, but the official rating remains simply positive or negative. Prior to their 1982 move to Tribune, the critics approved/disapproved the films they reviewed with a yes/no verdict.

Following the death of Gene Siskel, Disney considered not permitting guest critics to use the &quot;thumb&quot; rating in their movie review. However, this was quickly rescinded, enabling the show to continue with its signature (a picture of the guest critic&#x27;s own hand giving a &quot;thumbs up&quot; or &quot;thumbs down&quot; was used in the show&#x27;s graphics presenting his or her review).

On August 20, 2007, Disney pulled the thumbs system from the program during contractual negotiations with Ebert over his involvement with the program. Disney stated that Ebert forced the program to do so. In a statement to Poynter Online, Ebert said that Disney ordered the thumbs removed from the show. He says he had not expected this after an association of over 22 years: &quot;I had made it clear the THUMBS could remain during good-faith negotiations.&quot;

Upon being informed in mid-2009 of the most recent change in co-hosts to Scott and Phillips, Ebert indicated to Phillips that he would be prepared to return his endorsement and the &quot;Thumbs&quot; system to the series. However, Disney turned down the offer, saying that the show had &quot;moved on&quot;.

===See It/Skip It/Rent It===
On the show airing the weekend of May 24, 2008, the hosts began using the terms &quot;See It&quot; [green] and &quot;Skip It&quot; [red] (which appeared in on-screen graphics) when summarizing their reviews. &quot;Rent It&quot; [yellow] has been used to indicate a weakly positive verdict, suggesting that the viewer wait until the movie is available on home video.

===Wagging Finger of Shame===
From 2005 to 2006, the show experimented with a &quot;Wagging Finger of Shame&quot; feature, denoting films that were not made available for a standard advance screening and therefore could not be given either a &quot;thumbs up&quot; or &quot;thumbs down&quot;. Failure to prescreen a film for reviewers is generally considered an indicator of low confidence by the distributor, apparently believing that negative reviews would harm opening-weekend box office sales. Films so spotlighted included &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot;, &quot;The Fog&quot;, &quot;In the Mix&quot;, &quot;Æon Flux&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Date Movie&quot;. This public rebuke was discontinued when Ebert decided the studios were not taking it seriously. Roeper asserted that too many films (eleven in 2006 by April, compared to two by that date in 2005) were being withheld from critics.

===3 to See===
Introduced during the Roeper/Phillips era in 2008, &quot;3 to See&quot; was a segment appearing at the end of each show, in which the reviewers listed their top three favorites of the movies currently in theaters.

===Critics Roundup===
Introduced during the Lyons/Mankiewicz era in 2008, &quot;Critics Roundup&quot; was a variation of the traditional format in which one of the hosts presented a film, reviewed it, and then spoke with three other critics who appeared via satellite. Each critic provided their own See It/Skip It/Rent It rating, as did the other host, leading to a panel discussion. The votes of the whole panel were then tallied to provide the show&#x27;s recommendation. Guest critics on the September 6, 2008, debut of the segment included Wesley Morris of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Tory Shulman of ReelzChannel, and Matt Singer of IFC.

===Over/Under===
Introduced during the Phillips/Scott era in 2010, The &quot;Over/Under&quot; was a segment where the reviewers pick films of a certain genre that they think are overrated and underrated.

==Special programming==

Occasionally, special shows were produced that focus on particular aspects of film or home video. The show gives the hosts a convenient soapbox to feature their opinions on such issues as film colorization, letterboxing, the MPAA film rating system, product placement, independent filmmaking, and social issues. For instance, one episode, called &quot;Hail, Hail Black and White&quot;, was shot in black and white with the pair in tuxedos as part of their focus on the virtues of black and white film. Regular episodes sometimes devoted a few minutes for the hosts to give their opinions of a current issue related to the motion picture industry or to pay tribute to something. Another recurring feature was their &quot;Memo To The Academy&quot; episode, where they offered award nominee recommendations to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

At the end of every year, the two hosts would run down their choices of the top ten &quot;best&quot; films from that year, followed the week later by their rundown of their choices of the top ten &quot;worst&quot; films from that year. Another year-end tradition was Siskel &amp; Ebert&#x27;s Holiday Video Gift Guide, a special episode where the hosts spotlighted, tried out, and recommended various gifts, toys, and movies for the Christmas season. These aired as an hour-long special from 1987 to 1992, with the final installment in 1993 running for a half hour.

===Best films of the year===
From 1986 to 2009, the show compiled &quot;best of the year&quot; film lists which helped to provide an overview of the critics&#x27; critical preferences. Their top choices were:

====&quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot; (1986-1998)====
====&quot;Ebert &amp; Maslin&quot; (1999)====
====&quot;Ebert &amp; Roeper&quot; (2000-2005)====
====&quot;Roeper &amp; Scott&quot; (2006-2007)====
====&quot;Lyons &amp; Mankiewicz&quot; (2008)====
====&quot;Phillips &amp; Scott&quot; (2009)====
===Best films of the decade===
From the 1980s to the 2000s, the show complied &quot;best of the decade&quot; movie lists, thereby helping provide and overview of the critics&#x27; critical preferences. Only two films for this listing were named by the critics as the best film of the year, &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; (1994) for Roger Ebert in the 1990s, and &quot;Wall-E&quot; (2008) for A.O. Scott in the 2000s.

====&quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot; (1980s)====
====&quot;Ebert &amp; Scorsese&quot; (1990s)====
====&quot;Phillips &amp; Scott&quot; (2000s)====

<doc id="742000" wikidata="Q5583715" url="?curid=742000" title="Goodwood Cup">
<text>The Goodwood Cup is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at Goodwood over a distance of 2 miles (3,219 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late July or early August.

==History==
The first version of the Goodwood Cup was established in 1808, and it was won on three separate occasions by Bucephalus. Its trophy, a silver cup, was awarded permanently to the horse&#x27;s owner after the third victory. The replacement trophy was a gold cup, and the inaugural running for this took place in 1812. The race was originally contested over 3 miles, but it was later cut to 2 miles and 5 furlongs. Since 1991 the race has been run over 2 miles.

A number of foreign-bred horses won the Goodwood Cup in the mid-19th century. Early winners for France included Jouvence, Monarque and Flageolet, and the United States was represented by Starke. A notable overseas victory came from Kincsem, a Hungarian filly undefeated in a career of fifty-four races.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the Goodwood Cup was initially classed at Group 2 level. It was relegated to Group 3 status in 1985. It was shortened by a furlong in 1990, and reduced to its current length the following year. It regained Group 2 status in 1995. In 2017 the status was raised again to Group 1 and the purse was increased from £300,000 to £500,000.

The Goodwood Cup is one of Britain&#x27;s leading events for stayers – horses that specialise in racing over long distances. It is the second leg of the &quot;Stayers&#x27; Triple Crown&quot;, preceded by the Gold Cup and followed by the Doncaster Cup.

The race is now held on the opening day of the five-day Glorious Goodwood meeting.

<text>|}
















The Geoffrey Freer Stakes is a Group 3 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at Newbury over a distance of 1 mile, 5 furlongs and 61 yards (2,671 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in August.

==History==
The event was established in 1949, and it was originally called the Oxfordshire Stakes. It was founded by Geoffrey Freer, a Jockey Club handicapper who served as the manager of Newbury Racecourse. The venue had been used as an American military supply depot during World War II, and Freer restored the course in the post-war period. The race was renamed in his honour in 1969, the year after his death.

For a period the Geoffrey Freer Stakes was classed at Group 2 level. It was relegated to its current status, Group 3, in 2006.

The leading three-year-olds from the race sometimes go on to compete in the following month&#x27;s St. Leger Stakes.

<text>Gene Siskel (January 26, 1946 – February 20, 1999) and Roger Ebert (June 18, 1942 – April 4, 2013), collectively known as Siskel &amp; Ebert, were American film critics known for their partnership on television lasting from 1975 to Siskel&#x27;s death in 1999.

At the time two of the most well-known film critics writing for Chicago newspapers (Siskel for the &quot;Tribune,&quot; Ebert for the rival &quot;Sun-Times&quot;), the two were first paired up as the hosts of a monthly show called &quot;Opening Soon at a Theatre Near You,&quot; airing locally on PBS member station WTTW. In 1978, the show — renamed &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; — was expanded to weekly episodes and aired on PBS affiliates all around the United States. In 1982, the pair left &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; to create the syndicated show &quot;At the Movies.&quot; Following a contract dispute with Tribune Media in 1986, Siskel and Ebert signed with Buena Vista Television, creating &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot; (later renamed &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;, and renamed again several times after Siskel&#x27;s death).

Known for their sharp and biting wit, intense professional rivalry, heated arguments, and their binary &quot;Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down&quot; summations, the duo became a sensation in American popular culture. Siskel and Ebert remained partners until Siskel&#x27;s death from a brain tumor in 1999.

==Early careers==
Siskel started writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1969, becoming its film critic soon after. Ebert joined the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; in 1966, and started writing about film for the paper in 1967. In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for criticism.

== Partnership ==

Siskel and Ebert started their professional collaboration on the local Chicago PBS station WTTW with a show entitled &quot;Opening Soon at a Theatre Near You&quot; (1975–1977), before it was renamed two years later when the show was syndicated nationally to &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; (1977–1982). The show was later distributed by Tribune Broadcasting and changed to &quot;At the Movies&quot; (1982–1986), and final iteration of the show was when it was produced by The Walt Disney Company with &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot; (1986–1999). During its successful run with Siskel and Ebert as hosts, the series was nominated for various awards including for Daytime Emmy Awards as well as seven Primetime Emmy Awards including for Outstanding Information Series. Siskel died of a terminal brain cancer in 1999. Ebert continued with the series with rotating guest hosts which included Martin Scorsese, Janet Maslin, Peter Bogdanovich, Todd McCarthy, Lisa Schwarzbaum, Kenneth Turan, Elvis Mitchell, and the eventual replacement for Siskel, Richard Roeper.

== Review style and trademarks ==
Siskel and Ebert&#x27;s reviewing style has been described as a form of midwestern populist criticism rather than the one formed through essays which other critics including Pauline Kael felt undermined and undervalued the profession of film criticism. They were criticized for their ability to sensationalize film criticism in an easygoing, relatable way. Together, they are credited with forming contemporary film criticism. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Ebert&#x27;s reviews as a &quot;critic for the common man&quot;.

The pair were also known for their intense debate, often drawing sharp criticisms at each other. After Siskel&#x27;s death, Ebert reminisced about their close relationship saying:
Siskel and Ebert&#x27;s professional rivalry was noted in Matt Singer&#x27;s 2023 book &quot;Opposable Thumbs&quot;. According to a &quot;Tribune&quot; editor quoted in the book, when Siskel would scoop his rival in print, he&#x27;d exult: &quot;Take that, Tubby, I got him again.&quot;

In 1983, the two critics defended the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films against critic John Simon in an episode of &quot;ABC News&quot; &quot;Nightline&quot;. The film &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) had hit theaters that summer and Simon was criticizing the film for &quot;making children dumber than they need to be&quot;. Ebert responded saying:
==Preferences==
===Best films of the year===
As critics, Siskel&#x27;s first top ten list was in 1969; Ebert&#x27;s had debuted in 1967. Over the life of their partnership, these were the two critics&#x27; #1 selections.

Previously, Siskel and Ebert had separately agreed on &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;The Godfather&quot; before sharing the same opinion on &quot;Nashville&quot;, &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;, &quot;GoodFellas&quot;, &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Fargo&quot;.

Seven times, Siskel&#x27;s #1 choice did not appear on Ebert&#x27;s top ten list at all: &quot;Straight Time&quot;, &quot;Ragtime&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;, &quot;Shoah&quot;, &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;, &quot;Hearts of Darkness&quot;, and &quot;The Ice Storm&quot;. Eight times, Ebert&#x27;s top selection did not appear on Siskel&#x27;s; these films were &quot;Small Change&quot;, &quot;3 Women&quot;, &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot;, &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot;, &quot;Eve&#x27;s Bayou&quot;, and &quot;Dark City&quot;. In 1985, Ebert declined to rank the Holocaust documentary &quot;Shoah&quot; as 1985&#x27;s best film because he felt it was inappropriate to compare it to the rest of the year&#x27;s candidates.

While &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; appeared as Ebert&#x27;s choice for best film of 1979 but not anywhere on Siskel&#x27;s list, the documentary of the making of the film, &quot;Hearts of Darkness&quot;, was Siskel&#x27;s choice for the best film of 1991 while not appearing on Ebert&#x27;s list.

In addition, neither critic&#x27;s choice for the best film of 1988 (&quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; for Siskel and &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; for Ebert) appeared anywhere on the other critic&#x27;s list, but both starred Willem Dafoe.

== Advocacy ==
The pair also advocated for up-and-coming filmmakers including Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee, Steve James, Quentin Tarantino, Jane Campion, Michael Moore and Werner Herzog. For example, in 1981, Siskel and Ebert had viewed Errol Morris&#x27; &quot;Gates of Heaven&quot; (1978) and reviewed the film twice on separate episodes on &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;. They later placed the film on their lists for the best films of 1981.

In 1990, they interviewed Scorsese, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg on a special titled &quot;The Future of the Movies&quot;, highlighting the importance of film preservation. They later transcribed their interviews into a companion book of the same title, becoming the only book jointly written by them. 

They especially decried the lack of an Academy Award for Best Picture for Lee&#x27;s &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; (1989), and James&#x27; &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; (1994).

== Appearances ==
Siskel and Ebert were known for their many appearances on late-night talk shows including appearing on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; sixteen times and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; fifteen times. They also appeared together on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, &quot;Howard Stern&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

Normally, Siskel and Ebert would refuse to guest-star in movies or television series, as they felt it would undermine their &quot;responsibility to the public.&quot; However, they both &quot;could not resist&quot; appearing on an episode of the animated television series &quot;The Critic&quot;, the title character of which was a film-critic who hosted a television show. In the episode, entitled &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; Jay &amp; Alice&quot; (which aired in 1995), Siskel and Ebert split and each wants Jay Sherman, the eponymous film critic, as his new partner. The episode is a parody of the film &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;.

They also appeared as themselves on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; three times, 1982, 1983, and 1985. They appeared in the episode &quot;Chevy Chase/Queen&quot; (1982) where they reviewed sketches from the night&#x27;s telecast.

==In popular culture==
A reference to Siskel &amp; Ebert can be heard in the 1989 film, &quot;Police Academy 6: City Under Siege&quot;. At one point during a high speed chase, Captain Harris shouts: &quot;Look out for Gene and Roger&#x27;s fruit stand!&quot; This was because Siskel and Ebert hated both the cliché of fruit stands being destroyed in movie car chases and the &quot;Police Academy&quot; film series.

In 1993, Siskel and Ebert were satirized on the popular Nickelodeon series &quot;Doug&quot; in the episode &quot;Doug&#x27;s Monster Movie&quot; in which they appear in a dream sequence and vote two thumbs down on Doug&#x27;s home movie.

The 1993 episode of &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, &quot;Critical Condition&quot;, featured a parody of Siskel &amp; Ebert, with their names parodied as Lean Hisskill &amp; Codger Eggbert. The characters were voiced by Maurice LaMarche and Chuck McCann (later Billy West), respectively.

The 1998 film, &quot;Godzilla&quot;, featured characters based on the duo. The Mayor of New York City, Mayor Ebert, is portrayed by Michael Lerner, and Gene, the mayor&#x27;s aide, is played by Lorry Goldman. During the film, Gene resigns from working for Mayor Ebert by giving him a &#x27;thumbs down&#x27; gesture. Of the characters, Ebert pointed out in his review that the characters were producer Dean Devlin and director Roland Emmerich&#x27;s jabs at his and Gene Siskel&#x27;s negative reviews of &quot;Stargate&quot; and &quot;Independence Day&quot;. Gene Siskel particularly singled out this aspect, saying, &quot;If you&#x27;re going to go through the trouble of putting us in a monster movie, why don&#x27;t you at least take the advantage of having the monster either eat or squash us?&quot; Ebert gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four. Siskel placed the film on his list of the worst films of 1998.

==Awards and nominations==
Siskel and Ebert received a Chicago Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Program in 1979. They also received seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Informational Series. They also received three Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class Series from 1989 to 1991.

<text>|}






















The Great Voltigeur Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to three-year-old colts and geldings. It is run at York over a distance of 1 mile 3 furlongs and 188 yards (2,385 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in August.

==History==
The event is named after Voltigeur, the Yorkshire-trained winner of the Derby and St Leger in 1850. It was established in 1950, and it was initially called the Voltigeur Stakes. The word &quot;Great&quot; was added to the title in 1957.

The Great Voltigeur Stakes serves as a trial for the following month&#x27;s St Leger, and fifteen horses have achieved victory in both races. The first was Premonition in 1953, and the most recent was Continuous in 2023.

The event is currently held on the opening day of York&#x27;s four-day Ebor Festival meeting.

<text>The Gimcrack Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to two-year-old colts and geldings.

It is run at York over a distance of 6 furlongs (1,207 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in August.

==History==
The event is named after Gimcrack, a successful racehorse in the 18th century. Gimcrack won twenty-seven times in a career of thirty-six races, but none of his victories were achieved at York.

The Gimcrack Stakes was established in 1846, and it was originally open to horses of either gender. It was restricted to male horses in 1987.

The race is currently staged on the third day of York&#x27;s four-day Ebor Festival meeting.

The owner of the winning horse is traditionally invited to give a speech at the annual Gimcrack Dinner, which is held at the racecourse in December.

<doc id="742016" wikidata="Q99702" url="?curid=742016" title="U3 (Berlin U-Bahn)">
<text>U3 is a line on the Berlin U-Bahn created in its current version on 7 May 2018.

The routing is largely the same as the previous U2 until 1993, but it runs from Krumme Lanke to Wittenbergplatz. The route was renumbered to U1 from 1993 to 2004. It was extended one station further east to Nollendorfplatz to enable trains to be reversed and to allow one-stop transfer to the U4 in 2003. On 7 May 2018, the U3 was extended to run with the U1 all the way to Warschauer Straße.

==Changing routes and designations ==
The line to Krumme Lanke station has changed several times in the course of its existence. Initially, line A connected Krumme Lanke in the southwest of Berlin with Pankow in the north and was marked in red on the network maps. From 1957 two lines served the southwestern section of the line: the red route AII to Pankow as before, and a green route BII to Warschauer Brücke. After the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the small profile network was completely redesigned in 1966. The route to Dahlem received the line designation 2, running initially to Gleisdreieck via Bülowstraße, and from 1972 only to Wittenbergplatz. Line 3—with a dark green colour code—was assigned to the Uhlandstraße–Wittenbergplatz stub track. This changed again in 1993 as the line was marked green again and received the line number U1, which ran to Warschauer Straße. The designation U3 for the route to Uhlandstraße, however, disappeared, as this was now served by line U15, also running to Warschauer Straße. Finally, the line was redesignated from the network timetable change in December 2004 to the turquoise U3. Since 2005, the line has also operated as a late night service. From 4 to 7 March 2013, the trains were designated again as U1 between Krumme Lanke and Warschauer Straße due to construction work on the section between Uhlandstraße and Kurfürstendamm. Unlike in analogous cases (U12), no corresponding line designation (U13) was introduced here. From 2004 to 2018, line U3 was limited to the Krumme Lanke–Nollendorfplatz section.

==Current route==


 
The U3 currently starts at Warschauer Straße. From there it runs together with the U1 on its line to Wittenbergplatz. Under Tauentzienstraße it turns in a tight right-angle curve to the southwest and follows the streets of Nürnberger Straße and Spichernstraße to Spichernstraße station (interchange station to the U9) at the intersection with Bundesallee. It then follows Hohenzollerndamm to Fehrbelliner Platz, which provides interchange with the U7, and continues south under Barstrasse. Below street level, the U3 crosses the Fennsee (lake) in Volkspark Wilmersdorf (park) on a two-level bridge. Beyond the A 100 and after passing under the Ringbahn at Heidelberger Platz it follows the streets of Aßmannshauser Straße, Rüdesheimer Straße and Schorlemerallee and leaves the tunnel immediately before Podbielskiallee station. From there, the U3 continues in a cutting next to Archivstrasse and later Brümmerstrasse. Passing behind Freie Universität (Thielplatz), it turns due west. The last section runs south of the streets of Saargemünder Straße and Argentinische Allee. The U3 terminates at Krumme Lanke station, named after a nearby lake, at the intersection of Fischerhüttenstraße and Argentinische Allee.

== History==
In the summer of 1907, the &quot;Hochbahngesellschaft&quot; (&quot;Elevated Railway Company&quot;) of the new town of Wilmersdorf proposed the construction of an underground railway through the area. A route was envisaged running to Nürnberger Platz and, if Wilmersdorf would pay for it, on to Rastatter Platz, now Breitenbachplatz. Since Wilmersdorf had poor transport links, this suggestion was readily accepted. The commission for the development of the lands of Dahlem Manor, which were further south and were still largely undeveloped, was very interested in a rail connection. It wanted the proposed line to continue from Breitenbachplatz to Thielplatz.
Now, however, a big problem arose. The proposed line would run partly through Charlottenburg, but the municipality of Charlottenburg saw Wilmersdorf as a major competitor when it came to attracting wealthy taxpayers. Long negotiations were conducted until the following agreement was finalised in the summer of 1910: in addition to the line already planned, another one would be built in Charlottenburg under Kurfürstendamm, with the provisional terminus at Uhlandstraße.
According to one source, the then Prussian Minister of Public Works, Paul von Breitenbach, is said to have directed the city of Charlottenburg to allow the construction of the Wilmersdorf U-Bahn. As a result Rastatter Platz station and the square it was named after before the opening of the U-Bahn was renamed Breitenbachplatz by the grateful city of Wilmersdorf.
Construction work began in the summer of 1910. The following stations had to be built or converted:
* Wittenbergplatz (conversion)
* Nürnberger Platz (now closed)
* Hohenzollernplatz
* Fehrbelliner Platz
* Heidelberger Platz
* Rüdesheimer Platz
* Breitenbachplatz (originally planned as &quot;Rastatter Platz&quot;)
* Podbielskiallee
* Dahlem-Dorf
* Thielplatz (temporary terminus, then having a small waiting room)
as well as on the Charlottenburg line:
* Uhlandstraße
The previously double-track Wittenbergplatz station, which was only equipped with two side platforms, had to be completely rebuilt. A junction station was built with five platform faces, a sixth was prepared and a vestibule was built. The cities of Wilmersdorf and Charlottenburg presented various proposals; Finally, however, the chief of police recommended building it according to the plans of Alfred Grenander, the in-house architect of the Elevated Railway Company.
The stations in the Wilmersdorf area were elaborately designed, because the city was prosperous and wanted to show it. Today this can still be seen at the Hohenzollernplatz, Fehrbelliner Platz, Heidelberger Platz, Rüdesheimer Platz and Breitenbachplatz stations.
Heidelberger Platz represented an additional special feature, because the line of the Ringbahn is very low at this point in a cutting, so the U-Bahn had to be tunnelled even deeper. Therefore, beyond the underpass of the Ringbahn, there was the possibility to use the large space between the top of the carriages and ground level and design the station even more magnificently than the others on this line, that is like a cathedral with a hall vault and hanging illuminated candelabras (it is sometimes compared with the magnificent underground stations of the Moscow Metro from the 1930s). In addition, outside the station, the tunnels in both directions were built with a tunnel-like profile as far as the depth below the surface permitted (the purpose of this subway tunnel construction, which was rare in Berlin at the time, was to save large amounts of steel girders, which were required everywhere with cut and cover construction).
Beyond Breitenbachplatz, the line reached the Dahlem Manor lands. Due to the sparse development, the route could be built in an open cutting. Since the platforms could not be further decorated, the architects focused primarily on the individual design of the entrance buildings.
The additional route to Uhlandstraße, which Charlottenburg had won in the &quot;negotiation poker&quot;, only received one more station. The route branches off at Wittenbergplatz, runs parallel to the tracks of today&#x27;s U1 as far as Breitscheidplatz and continues under Kurfürstendamm to Uhlandstraße station. An extension to Halensee was planned. At the intersection with the newly built large profile route G (now: line U9), another station was added in 1961 with the Kurfürstendamm station, which received side platforms.
The lines to Thielplatz and to Uhlandstrasse both opened on 12 October 1913. Together they were about long. This was the last U-Bahn construction in Berlin before the First World War, which began on 1 August 1914. No more U-Bahn lines were completed until ten years later.
=== A gift U-Bahn line ===
The southern end of the Wilmersdorf-Dahlemer U-Bahn did not hold good prospects for an extension. The Dahlem line had been unprofitable since it opened and only a single car was operated from Breitenbachplatz to Thielplatz as a so-called &quot;solo car&quot;.
Greater Berlin, which was united in 1920, demanded that the Prussian government or the Dahlem Commission (&quot;Dahlemkommission&quot;) take over the line (including the operating cost grants) and took legal action in the Reichsgericht (supreme court) to this end. However, in the years that followed, the financial situation of the line improved considerably with increasing development. The Prussian government was finally able to hand over the line to the city free of charge and debt-free on 1 January 1928.
At the same time, the Sommerfeld group, which owned large areas in the southwest of Berlin that were still undeveloped, offered free land and the assumption of construction costs for an extension of the line to Krumme Lanke. In fact, the city was gifted of U-Bahn.
The line would have the following stations, which are all located in a cutting:
* Oskar-Helene-Heim
* Onkel Toms Hütte
* Krumme Lanke (terminus with a four-track workshop and storage hall in front)
This section went into service on 22 December 1929. The &quot;Onkel Toms Hütte&quot; (&quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;) station and housing estate were named after a nearby restaurant of the same name. The Krumme Lanke station received a New Objectivity style entrance building, which was one of Alfred Grenander&#x27;s late works. The station forecourt was named after him on 6 June 2009. Since the building had become dilapidated, it had to be demolished in 1988. A good replica was built in 1989. The terminus of today&#x27;s U3 line is named after a nearby lake.
A workshop consisting of a carriage shed with a workshop building was built at Krumme Lanke station. However, due to a lack of capacity, the workshop was closed in 1968 and necessary repairs were outsourced to the Grunewald workshop. In the years that followed, the carriage shed was primarily used as a storage facility, where minor repairs such as changing lamps were only occasionally carried out. Years of not investing in the maintenance of the carriage shed finally led to its closure due to dilapidation in 2014. The hall is heritage-listed.

=== Modifications===
During the construction of line G, now U9, an interchange station was to be built at the intersection of the two lines. However, since there was no station at the Spichernstraße/ Bundesallee intersection on the U3—then line 2—the Spichernstraße station was built. The nearby Nürnberger Platz station was closed and completely gutted on 1 July 1959. The area of the former central platform was converted into a double-track siding, which is accessed from Spichernstraße. However, the distance of between the Wittenbergplatz and Spichernstraße stations was considered unacceptable for the City West area, so the new Augsburger Straße station was built. It was considered necessary to minimise the impact on the existing structure at both new small-profile stations, so both were built with side platforms. They were opened on 2 June 1959 (Spichernstraße) and 8 May 1961 (Augsburger Straße). The architecture is strongly based on Grenander&#x27;s model. The buildings were designed in a functional style based on designs by the then subway architect Bruno Grimmek. Augsburger Straße station was decorated with red-brown tiles and Spichernstraße with light blue tiles.
In 1981, a second entrance building was built at Thielplatz station, which also houses a substation. This shortened the way to the campus of the Free University of Berlin.

=== Extension to Warschauer Straße ===
On 7 May 2018. the U3 was &quot;extended&quot; eastwards on the existing line used by the U1 to the terminus at Warschauer Straße. In other words, the route that existed until 2004 as the then U1 line was restored. This facilitates the movement of students and others from there to the Free University and extended the denser service from Nollendorfplatz eastwards. The extension of the line was facilitated by the new four-car class IK18 sets becoming available in April 2018.

=== Opening dates===
* 12 October 1913: Wittenbergplatz – Thielplatz
* 24 October 1926: Wittenbergplatz – Nollendorfplatz (underground)
* 22 December 1929: Thielplatz – Krumme Lanke
* 2 June 1959: Spichernstraße station opened; simultaneous closure of Nürnberger Platz station
* 8 May 1961: Augsburger Straße station

==Extension==
In the south, there are plans to extend the U3 towards the Berlin Mexikoplatz station, running via Lindenthaler Allee. Even though this would only take of new tracks, the budgetary constraints of the Berlin Senate hinders completion.

==Frequency==
Train run every 5 minutes on weekdays, every 10 minutes on weekends and since 2006 every 15-minute early mornings on Saturday and Sunday. On the other nights the &quot;N3&quot; bus service operates.

==Former U3==
Until 1993 U3 referred to the section of line between Wittenbergplatz and Uhlandstraße, it was formerly numbered BII (until 1957), BIV (from 1957 to 1966) and Line 3 (from 1966 to 1984), before being renamed U3. In 1993, this section was renumbered to U15 and became a branch of the U1.

With the change of line numbers in December 2004, there were some confusion as the planned final phase of the U3 line from Theodor-Heuss-Platz via Westkreuz, Adenauerplatz, Kurfürstendamm, Wittenbergplatz, Lutzowplatz, Potsdamer Platz, and Leipziger Straße to Alexanderplatz, and from there on to Weißensee and Karow-Ost, which would overlap with the present course of the U3 and the unbuilt U10, as well as the provisional future rolling stock which was intended to be driverless Alstom Metropolis trains for the U3. However, these plans were scrapped.

<text>|}
















The Lowther Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to two-year-old fillies. It is run at York over a distance of 6 furlongs (1,207 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in August. Up until 1975 the race was run over a distance of 5 furlongs.

==History==
A different event called the Lowther Stakes, a middle-distance race open to horses aged three or older, used to be contested at Newmarket. Its winners included Bay Ronald (1896), Bayardo (1909) and Gay Crusader (1917).

The present version is named in memory of Hugh Lowther (1857–1944), the 5th Earl of Lonsdale. It was established in 1946, and the inaugural running was won by Southernwood.

The Lowther Stakes is currently held on the second day of York&#x27;s four-day Ebor Festival meeting. The leading horses from the race sometimes go on to compete in the Cheveley Park Stakes and the most recent filly to win both races was Fairyland in 2018.

<doc id="742024" wikidata="Q1090266" url="?curid=742024" title="William Gascoigne (scientist)">
<text>William Gascoigne (1612 – 2 July 1644) was an English astronomer, mathematician and maker of scientific instruments from Middleton, Leeds who invented the micrometer and the telescopic sight. He was one of a group of astronomers in the north of England who followed the astronomy of Johannes Kepler, which included Jeremiah Horrocks and William Crabtree.

== Life and work ==

Gascoigne was born in Middleton, Leeds in 1612, the son of a minor country gentleman. His father was Henry Gascoigne, Esq., of Thorpe-on-the-Hill in the parish of Rothwell, near Leeds, Yorkshire. His mother was Margaret Jane, daughter of William Cartwright. Little is known of his early life. He claimed he was educated at the University of Oxford, although no record of this has been found.

In the late 1630s, Gascoigne, was working on a Keplerian optical arrangement when a thread from a spider&#x27;s web happened to become caught at exactly the combined optical focal points of the two lenses. When he looked through the arrangement Gascoigne saw the web bright and sharp within the field of view. He realized that he could more accurately point the telescope using the line as a guide, and went on to invent the telescopic sight by placing crossed wires at the focal point to define the centre of the field of view. He then added this arrangement to a sextant modelled on the instrument used by Tycho Brahe, although Tycho&#x27;s sextant was only a naked-eye instrument. Gascoigne&#x27;s sextant was five feet in radius, and measured the distance between astronomical bodies to an unprecedented degree of accuracy. Gascoigne then realised that by introducing two points, whose separation could be adjusted using a screw, he could measure the size of the image enclosed by them. Using the known pitch of the screw, and knowing the focal length of the lens producing the image, he could work out the size of the object, such as the Moon or the planets, to a hitherto unattainable degree of accuracy.

Gascoigne met the Lancashire astronomer William Crabtree, probably in 1640. After making observations at Gascoigne&#x27;s home, Crabtree was much taken with these inventions and immediately saw their significance. On his return to his home in Broughton, just outside Manchester, he wrote to Gascoigne asking if he might obtain such instruments and also wrote to his friend Jeremiah Horrocks about them. He wrote again to Gascoigne on 28 December 1640 saying, 
My friend Mr. Horrox professeth that little touch which I gave him hath ravished his mind quite from itself and left him in an Exstasie between Admiration and Amazement. I beseech you Sir, slack not your Intentions for the Perfection of your begun Wonders.
 Sadly, Horrocks died before he could try out the instruments, but Crabtree and Gascoigne did use them to try to corroborate Horrocks&#x27;s theories about the elliptical orbit of the Moon.

This invention was later taken up and improved by the scientist and astronomer Richard Towneley who was the nephew of Gascoigne&#x27;s friend Christopher Towneley. Towneley later brought the instrument to the attention of Robert Hooke, who used it to calculate the size of comets and other celestial bodies. The micrometer, as it became known, was to lie at the heart of astronomical measurement down to the twentieth century.

In 1642, civil war broke out in England, and Gascoigne received a commission as Providore for Yorkshire in the army of King Charles I. Crabtree lived in Broughton, just outside Manchester which was on the parliamentary side and all correspondence between the two ceased.

Gascoigne died at the Battle of Marston Moor, Yorkshire, on 2 July 1644 as did Charles Towneley, the father of his friend Richard Towneley.

After Gascoigne&#x27;s death some of his papers and fragments of correspondence between Crabtree and Gascoigne came into the possession of Christopher and Richard Towneley. They brought them to the attention of John Flamsteed, the first Astronomer Royal, who came to see Horrocks, Crabtree, and Gascoigne as the founding fathers of British research astronomy and the intellectual heirs of Galileo and Kepler. He began his massive three-folio volume &quot;Historia Coelestis Britannica&quot; (1725) by printing five pages of their surviving letters and observations, made between 1638 and 1643.

Many of Gascoigne&#x27;s papers and correspondence were lost during the English Civil War and later in the Great Fire of London, but most of what is known to remain is kept in the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford.

==Legacy==
In March 2018 Leeds Civic Trust unveiled a blue plaque in the city honouring Gascoigne. It was unveiled by David Sellers, who has written a biography of Gascoigne, who said:

Although his name is known by astronomers, his role as a pioneer in precision astronomy deserves wider public recognition. I hope that this plaque will help to achieve this and will encourage young people to follow his lead and inspire an interest in the natural world.

Local MP Hilary Benn was also present.

<text>|}
















The Park Hill Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to fillies and mares aged three years or older. It is run at Doncaster over a distance of 1 mile, 6 furlongs and 115 yards (2,922 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.

==History==
The event is named after Park Hill, an estate formerly owned by Anthony St. Leger, the founder of Doncaster&#x27;s most famous race, the St. Leger Stakes. The Park Hill Stakes was established in 1839, and it was originally restricted to three-year-old fillies.

The victory of Blink Bonny in 1857 provoked a riot among spectators who believed she had been dishonestly prevented from winning the previous day&#x27;s St. Leger by her jockey John &quot;Jack&quot; Charlton. The incident came to be known as the &quot;Blink Bonny riot&quot;.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the Park Hill Stakes was initially given Group 2 status. It was opened to fillies and mares aged four years or older and relegated to Group 3 level in 1991. It was promoted back to Group 2 in 2004.

The Park Hill Stakes is currently held on the second day of Doncaster&#x27;s four-day St. Leger Festival. It is sometimes referred to as the Fillies&#x27; St. Leger.

<doc id="742028" wikidata="Q302393" url="?curid=742028" title="Johan Vonlanthen">
<text>Johan Vonlanthen Benavídez (born 1 February 1986) is a former professional footballer who played as a winger. Born in Colombia, he opted to play for Switzerland, for whom he became eligible through his Swiss-born stepfather.

Having made his Swiss Super League debut BSC Young Boys at the age of 16, he moved to PSV in 2003.

He initially announced the end of his active career in May 2012. He came back out of retirement in May 2013 and signed for Grasshoppers in June. He retired in August 2018 after two years with FC Wil.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Vonlanthen played as a junior for BSC Young Boys in Switzerland. In the 2001–02 season, he made his debut as a 16-year-old in the Swiss Super League starting eight games and appearing once as a substitute. In the summer of 2003, he was transferred to the Dutch Eredivisie club PSV Eindhoven. On 21 June 2004, Vonlanthen became the youngest goalscorer when he scored for the Switzerland national team against France in Coimbra, Portugal at the age of 18 years and 141 days old. He made a good initial impression and helped PSV qualify for the UEFA Champions League. After a good first season, he began to lose form and as a consequence was loaned out to Italian side Brescia Calcio for the last six months of the 2004–05 season. He was again loaned out to NAC Breda for the 2005–06 season.

===Red Bull Salzburg===
At the start of the 2006–07 season, Vonlanthen transferred to Red Bull Salzburg in the Austrian Bundesliga.

On 13 July 2009, FC Zürich signed the Swiss forward on a season long loan deal. The move was not made permanent, and Vonlanthen returned to Salzburg for the start of the 2010–11 season.

===Itagüí, Wohlen and initial retirement===
Vonlanthen moved to Colombian Primera División side Itagüí in August 2011.

On 30 May 2012, Vonlanthen announced his retirement at age 26. According to him, he &#x27;could not face the prospect of undergoing a knee operation&#x27;.

===Return===
On 13 June 2013, Vonlanthen came out of retirement to join Grasshoppers, signing a one-year deal with an option for a further two years.

On 27 December 2013, Vonlanthen was loaned out to Swiss second division side Schaffhausen, due to a lack of playing time at Grasshoppers.

He retired in August 2018 after two years with FC Wil.

==International career==
Vonlanthen&#x27;s stepfather is a Swiss national, giving him the right to play for that country.

On 6 June 2004, Vonlanthen made his senior debut for the Switzerland national team against Liechtenstein. He came on as a substitute in the 81st minute to replace Alexander Frei. Switzerland went on to beat Liechtenstein 1–0.

At UEFA Euro 2004, Vonlanthen became the second youngest player to play in the tournament when he came on as a substitute against England. On 21 June 2004, Vonlanthen became the youngest scorer ever in the European Championships when he equalised against France, beating Wayne Rooney&#x27;s record – which had only been set four days before – by three months. However his record was beaten by Lamine Yamal on 9 July 2024 during UEFA Euro 2024 semifinals against France.

Since the European Championships in Portugal, Vonlanthen managed to maintain a regular position in the national team and as well as playing frequently in the under 21s side. He was part of the squad that very narrowly lost out to Spain on a place in the 2009 European Championships. He had scored the equaliser in the first leg in a 2–1 win but the Spanish came back to win 3–1 in the second leg and 4–3 on aggregate.

Vonlanthen was called up to the Swiss squad to play in 2006 FIFA World Cup, but was unable to participate due to a hamstring injury. He was also called up for UEFA Euro 2008.

==Personal life==
Vonlanthen is an adherent of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, a strict evangelical denomination.

<text>|}

















The Doncaster Cup is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at Doncaster over a distance of 2 miles 1 furlong and 197 yards (3,600 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.

== History ==
The event was established in 1766, and it was originally called the Doncaster Gold Cup. It pre-dates Doncaster&#x27;s St. Leger Stakes by ten years, and is the venue&#x27;s oldest surviving race. It was initially held at Cantley Common, and moved to its present location in 1776.

During the early part of its history the race was contested over 4 miles. It was shortened to 2 miles and 5 furlongs in 1825, and reduced to 2 miles and 2 furlongs in 1891. It was cut by another furlong in 1908, and restored to its previous length in 1927.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and for a period the Doncaster Cup was classed at Group 3 level. It was promoted to Group 2 in 2003.

The Doncaster Cup is one of Britain&#x27;s leading events for &quot;stayers&quot; – horses which specialise in racing over long distances. It is the final leg of the &quot;Stayers&#x27; Triple Crown&quot;, preceded by the Gold Cup and the Goodwood Cup. The Doncaster Cup is the only British race where the winner has ballot-exempt entry to the Melbourne Cup.

The race is currently held on the third day of Doncaster&#x27;s four-day St. Leger Festival.

<text>The Kallikak Family: A Study in the Heredity of Feeble-Mindedness was a 1912 book by the American psychologist and eugenicist Henry H. Goddard, dedicated to his patron Samuel Simeon Fels. Supposedly an extended case study of Goddard’s for the inheritance of &quot;feeble-mindedness&quot;, a general category referring to a variety of mental disabilities including intellectual disability, learning disabilities, and mental illness, the book is noted for factual inaccuracies that render its conclusions invalid. Goddard believed that a variety of mental traits were hereditary and that society should limit reproduction by people possessing these traits.

The name Kallikak is a pseudonym used as a family name throughout the book. Goddard coined the name from the Greek words καλός (&quot;kalos&quot;) meaning good and κακός (&quot;kakos&quot;) meaning bad. 
== Summary ==

The book begins by discussing the case of &quot;Deborah Kallikak&quot; (real name Emma Wolverton, 1889–1978), a woman in Goddard&#x27;s institution, the New Jersey Home for the Education and Care of Feebleminded Children (now Vineland Training School). In the course of investigating her genealogy, Goddard claims to have discovered that her family tree bore a curious and surprising moral tale.

The book follows the genealogy of Martin Kallikak, Deborah&#x27;s great-great-great grandfather, a Revolutionary War hero married to a Quaker woman. On his way back from battle the normally morally upright Martin dallied one time with a &quot;feeble-minded&quot; barmaid. He impregnated her and then abandoned her. The young Martin soon reformed and went on with his upright life, becoming a respected New England citizen and father of a large family of prosperous individuals. All of the children that came from this relationship were &quot;wholesome&quot; and had no signs of developmental disabilities.

But according to Goddard, a child was born by the dalliance with &quot;the nameless feeble-minded girl&quot;. This single child, a male, called Martin Kallikak Jr. in the book (real name John Wolverton, 1776–1861), went on to father more children, who fathered their own children, and on and on down the generations. And so with the Kallikaks, Goddard claims to have discovered, one has as close as one could imagine an experiment in the hereditability of intelligence, moral ability, and criminality.

On the &quot;feeble-minded&quot; side of the Kallikak family, descended from the abandoned single-parent barmaid, the children wound up poor, mentally ill, delinquent, and intellectually disabled. Deborah was, in Goddard&#x27;s assessment, &quot;feeble-minded&quot;: a catch-all early 20th century term to describe various forms of intellectual or learning disabilities. Goddard was interested in the heritability of &quot;feeble-mindedness&quot;—and often wrote of the invisible threat of recessive &quot;feeble-minded&quot; genes carried by otherwise healthy and intelligent looking members of the population (Mendel&#x27;s laws had only been rediscovered a decade before; Goddard&#x27;s genetic shorthand was, in its day, considered to be on par with cutting-edge science). It was in tracing the family history of Deborah that Goddard and his assistants discovered that Deborah&#x27;s family of drunks and criminals was related—through Martin Kallikak—to another family tree of economy and prosperity.

On the &quot;normal&quot; side of the Kallikak family tree, the children Martin had with his wife and their descendants all ended up prosperous, intelligent, and morally upstanding. They were lawyers, ministers, and doctors. None were &quot;feeble-minded&quot;. Goddard concluded from this that intelligence, sanity, and morality were hereditary, and every effort should be undertaken to keep the &#x27;feeble-minded&#x27; from procreating, with the overall goal of potentially ending &#x27;feeble-mindedness&#x27; and its accompanying traits. The damage from even one dalliance between a young man and a &quot;feeble-minded&quot; woman could create generations and generations worth of crime and poverty, with its members eventually living off the generosity of the state (and consequently taxpayers), Goddard argued. His work contains intricately constructed family trees, showing near-perfect Mendelian ratios in the inheritance of negative and positive traits.

Goddard recommended segregating them in institutions, where they would be taught how to work various forms of menial labor.

== Present-day evaluation ==

In its day, &quot;The Kallikak Family&quot; was a tremendous success and went through multiple printings. It helped propel Goddard to the status of one of the nation&#x27;s top experts in using psychology in policy, and along with the work of Charles B. Davenport and Madison Grant is considered one of the canonical works of early 20th-century American eugenics.

Research published in 2001 by David MacDonald and Nancy McAdams revealed that Goddard&#x27;s account of the division of the Kallikak family into a &quot;good&quot; lineage—descended from Martin Kallikak Sr. and his wife—and a &quot;bad&quot; lineage—descended from Martin Kallikak Sr. and an unnamed feeble-minded barmaid—was fictitious. Martin Kallikak Jr., the supposedly illegitimate offspring of Martin Kallikak Sr. and the barmaid, was in fact the son of Gabriel Wolverton and his wife Catherine Murray. His real name was John Wolverton (1776–1861), and he was a landowner prosperous enough to buy two tracts of land for cash in 1809. Census records of 1850 show that all the adults in his household (which included Wolverton, one daughter, and several grandchildren) were able to read. The &quot;bad&quot; side of the Kallikak family included poor farmers but also school teachers, an Army Air Corps pilot, and a bank treasurer.

It has been argued that the effects of malnutrition were overlooked in the Kallikak family. Goddard&#x27;s peer, Davenport, even identified various forms of diseases now known to be caused by diet deficiencies as being hereditary.

Another perspective has been offered that the Kallikaks almost certainly had undiagnosed fetal alcohol syndrome. In addition to poverty and malnourishment, prenatal alcohol exposure can create craniofacial and other physical anomalies that could account for their peculiar facial features. Furthermore, prenatal alcohol exposure may also damage the central nervous system, which can result in impaired cognitive and behavioral functioning similar to that described by Goddard.

=== Alteration of photographs ===
The paleontologist and science writer Stephen Jay Gould advanced the view that Goddard—or someone working with him—had retouched the photographs used in his book in order to make the &quot;bad&quot; Kallikaks appear more menacing. In older editions of the books, Gould said, it has become clearly evident that someone had drawn in darker, &quot;crazier&quot; looking eyes and menacing faces on the children and adults in the pictures. Gould argues that photographic reproduction in books was still then a very new art, and that audiences would not have been as keenly aware of photographic retouching, even on such a crude level. The 14 photos were subsequently studied further to show the nature of the retouching and subsequent use to help make Goddard&#x27;s points.

=== Influence ===

The overall effect of &quot;The Kallikak Family&quot; was to temporarily increase funding to institutions such as Goddard&#x27;s, but these were not seen to be worthwhile solutions of the problem of &quot;feeble-mindedness&quot; (much less &quot;rogue&quot; &quot;feeble-mindedness&quot;—the threat of idiocy as a recessive trait), and more stringent methods, such as compulsory sterilization of people with intellectual disabilities, were undertaken.

The term &quot;Kallikak&quot; became, along with &quot;Jukes&quot; and &quot;Nams&quot; (other case studies of similar natures), a cultural shorthand for the rural poor in the Southern and Northeastern United States.

In August 1977, NBC premiered a situation comedy called &quot;The Kallikaks&quot;, which depicted the comic misadventures of an Appalachian family that moved to California and feuded with another family named the Jukes; the series lasted only five episodes. A June 8, 1987, cartoon in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; provided a further update to the concept, depicting &quot;The Jukes and Kallikaks Today&quot;.

In the book &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, Richard Condon makes an adjective of the Kallikak name in describing a country music song in the 1950s: &quot;... a loudly lovable old standard out of Memphis, Tennessee, in which the rhyme of the proper name Betty Lou and the plural noun &quot;shoes&quot; were repeated, in a Kallikakian couplet, over and over again...&quot;

<text>Hans Krebs (26 April 1888 – 15 February 1947) was an ethnic German born in Moravia who was an ardent German nationalist who emigrated to Nazi Germany. He joined the Nazi Party, was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; and was appointed a &quot;Regierungspräsident&quot; (district president) in the Sudetenland. He was also a member of the SS, rising to the rank of SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot;. In 1947, Krebs was executed in Prague for high treason by the Czechoslovak Republic.

== Early life ==
Krebs was born the son of an innkeeper and clothmaker in Iglau (today, Jihlava) in Moravia when it was part of Austria-Hungary. He attended the German-language &quot;Volksschule&quot; and &quot;Oberrealschule&quot; in Iglau through 1906. He was involved with German nationalism from his youth, joining the German Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Deutsche Arbeiterpartei&quot;, DAP) in 1907. The party&#x27;s program included elements of pan-Germanism and antisemitism. He became the secretary of the &quot;Deutschen Volkswehr&quot; (German militia) in Iglau the following year. In 1910, he was made editor of the DAP news organ, the &quot;Deutsche Arbiterpresse&quot;, and publisher of the parliamentary correspondence paper, the &quot;Deutsche Arbiterkorrespondenz&quot;, both in Vienna. The same year, he rose to become general secretary of the central commission of the German Employees Association of Austria. In 1912 he became the general manager of the DAP in Vienna.

Upon the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Krebs volunteered for service in the Austro-Hungarian Army and was assigned to the 4th Infantry Regiment. From July 1915 he served on the front lines in Serbia and in Italy. As a &quot;Leutnant&quot;, he was a machine-gun platoon commander from August to December 1916, when he was declared unfit for further front-line service. He received several decorations, including the Medal for Bravery in two classes, and was promoted to the rank of &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; before being discharged in October 1918.

== Political activities in Czechoslovakia ==
Returning to civilian life in the newly-formed nation of Czechoslovakia, Krebs joined the DAP successor organization, the German National Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (DNSAP) with the membership number of 86, and became the editor of the &quot;Iglauer Volkswehr&quot; newspaper. Iglau had become the second largest German-speaking enclave inside Czechoslovakia and there was great political dissatisfaction among the Germans in Czechoslovakia. Also in 1918, Krebs was named the general manager of the DNSAP in the Sudetenland and the editor-in-chief of the &quot;Nationalsozialistischen Korrespondenz&quot; in Bohemia, positions which he would continue to hold until 1931. From 1918 to 1919, Krebs sat in the Bohemian &quot;Landtag&quot; and, from 1920 to 1931, he was the leader of the party secretariat for the Sudetenland. He first met Adolf Hitler in 1920. In 1925, he was elected a member of the City Council of Aussig (today, Ústí nad Labem) and a member of the Czechoslovak Chamber of Deputies, positions that he would retain until 1933. In addition, from 1927 to 1933 Krebs was the DNSAP &quot;Landesleiter&quot; (state leader) in Bohemia. He was also, between 1928 and 1930, the acting &quot;Landesleiter&quot; in Austria but largely was an absentee leader and left this post to concentrate his energies in Czechoslovakia.

On 15 May 1929, Krebs became a co-founder and &quot;Landesleiter&quot; of a DNSAP paramilitary organization under the guise of a sporting organization, the &quot;Volkssport Verband&quot; (People&#x27;s Sport Association). Based on the model of the Nazi Party &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) in Germany, its members wore brown uniforms like those of the SA and staged large rallies and marches agitating for unification with Germany. They held joint exercises with the SA and in one of these, in January 1931, SA troops crossed the border into Czech territory. The Czechoslovak government first banned the wearing of the brown uniform and, on 1 March 1932, outlawed the organization entirely. Several &quot;Volkssport Verband&quot; members were indicted and put on trial for high treason in Brno between 8 August and 24 September 1932. During the trial, Krebs was implicated but was protected by parliamentary immunity. In November, prosecutors sought permission from the parliament to proceed against him and, on 28 February 1933, Krebs was indicted, then arrested and imprisoned for several months. Released on parole on the condition that he not engage in further unlawful activities, he broke parole by fleeing to Germany in July.

== Career in Nazi Germany ==
In Germany, Krebs became an advisor to Hitler on Czechoslovak issues. He joined the Nazi Party and was granted an effective date of 1 April 1925 along with his old DNSAP party membership number of 86. He joined the SA as an SA-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; and, on 30 January 1934, was employed as a press advisor in the Reich Interior Ministry, under &quot;Reichsminister&quot; Wilhelm Frick. In November 1934, he was made head of the Professional Publications Library in the ministry, and was appointed a &quot;Regierungsrat&quot; (Government Councilor) in February 1935. On 29 March 1936, he was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; from electoral constituency 3 (Berlin-East) and would retain this seat until the fall of the Nazi regime. In the mid-1930s he wrote two books arguing the Sudeten German case: &quot;Kampf in Böhmen&quot; (Berlin, 1936) and &quot;Wir Sudetendeutsche&quot; (Berlin, 1937). Krebs was advanced to &quot;Oberregierungsrat&quot; (Senior Government Councilor) on 30 January 1937 and also was promoted to SA-&quot;Standartenführer&quot;. In October 1937, Franz von Papen was rumored to be leaving his post as German ambassador to Austria and Krebs was the preferred choice as his replacement among Austrian Nazis. In the end, no replacement was named, as Papen stayed on until just before the Austrian &quot;Anschluss&quot; in March 1938. Krebs left the SA and transferred to the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) on 1 April 1938 (SS number 292,802) and was assigned to the SS Main Office. He would subsequently be promoted to SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; (16 October 1938) and to SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; (9 November 1940) when he was assigned to the staff of the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;. On the occasion of Krebs&#x27; 50th birthday on 26 April 1938, Hitler awarded him the title of Honorary &quot;Gauleiter&quot;. He was also later awarded the Golden Party Badge.

From August to October 1938, Krebs headed the Sudeten German Refugee Relief Program in Berlin, receiving a promotion to &quot;Ministerialrat&quot; (Ministerial Councilor) in the Interior Ministry on 27 September. Between the Munich agreement of 29 September 1938 when the Sudetenland was ceded to Germany and the end of the year, over 150,000 inhabitants fled the area, including Czechs and Germans who were defined as Jews under the Nuremberg Laws. Those who remained were subjected to the persecution and violence that followed, including the looting and destruction of the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; pogrom of 9–10 November. Krebs was charged on 15 November 1938 with conducting the government affairs of the , one of the three administrative regions established within the &quot;Reichsgau Sudetenland&quot;. He was named Acting &quot;Regierungspräsident&quot; on 15 December and the appointment was made permanent on 31 March 1939. During his tenure, Jews living in Aussig were systematically persecuted and, on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1938, the was attacked and burned down. A butcher shop was later established on the site. At the end of 1941 and early 1942, Jewish residents were rounded up and deported to the Theresienstadt Ghetto and ultimately the extermination camps. Of the approximately 1,250 members of the Jewish community in Aussig, it is estimated that only about 200 people survived the war by emigrating. Just a few of the survivors returned to the city after the war.

In 1942, Krebs was considered for the post of &quot;Gauleiter&quot; in the planned but never established &quot;Reichsgau Flandern&quot;. On 20 May 1943, Konrad Henlein the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; in the &quot;Reichsgau&quot; Sudetenland, nominated Krebs to be his deputy but this was vetoed by Martin Bormann, the chief of the Party Chancellery, and the post went to in the fall of that year. Krebs then served on the staff of the SS-&quot;Oberabschnitt Elbe&quot; in Dresden and, on 1 May 1944, was transferred to the staff of the SS-&quot;Oberabschnitt Böhmen-Mähren&quot; headquartered in Prague.

==Post-war==
After the end of World War II in Europe, Krebs was arrested by Czechoslovak authorities in May 1945 and incarcerated at Pankrác Prison. He was put on trial by the Czechoslovak Republic, convicted of high treason and executed by hanging in Prague in February 1947.

The May Hill Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to two-year-old fillies. It is run at Doncaster over a distance of 1 mile (1,609 metres), and takes place each year in September.

==History==
The event is named after May Hill, a successful filly whose victories included Doncaster&#x27;s Park Hill Stakes in 1975. It was established in 1976, and was originally classed at Group 3 level. It was promoted to Group 2 status in 2003.

The May Hill Stakes is currently held on the second day of the four-day St. Leger Festival.

The leading horses from the race often go on to compete in the Fillies&#x27; Mile. The last to win both was Inspiral in 2021, when she was unbeaten in four races.

==Records==

Leading jockey (6 wins):
* Frankie Dettori – &quot;Calando (1998), Teggiano (1999), White Moonstone (2010), Lyric of Light (2011), Indigo Girl (2020), Inspiral (2021)&quot;

Leading trainer (12 wins):

<doc id="742038" wikidata="Q4406785" url="?curid=742038" title="Liquid scintillation counting">
<text>Liquid scintillation counting is the measurement of radioactive activity of a sample material which uses the technique of mixing the active material with a liquid scintillator (e.g. zinc sulfide), and counting the resultant photon emissions. The purpose is to allow more efficient counting due to the intimate contact of the activity with the scintillator. It is generally used for alpha particle or beta particle detection.

==Technique==

Samples are dissolved or suspended in a &quot;cocktail&quot; containing a solvent (historically aromatic organics such as xylene or toluene, but more recently less hazardous solvents are used), typically some form of a surfactant, and &quot;fluors&quot; or scintillators which produce the light measured by the detector. Scintillators can be divided into primary and secondary phosphors, differing in their luminescence properties.

Beta particles emitted from the isotopic sample transfer energy to the solvent molecules: the π cloud of the aromatic ring absorbs the energy of the emitted particle. The energized solvent molecules typically transfer the captured energy back and forth with other solvent molecules until the energy is finally transferred to a primary scintillator. The primary phosphor will emit photons following absorption of the transferred energy. Because that light emission may be at a wavelength that does not allow efficient detection, many cocktails contain secondary phosphors that absorb the fluorescence energy of the primary phosphor and re-emit at a longer wavelength. Two widely used primary and secondary
fluors are 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO) with an emission maximum of 380 nm and 1,4-bis-2-(5-phenyloxazolyl)benzene (POPOP) with an emission maximum of 420 nm.

The radioactive samples and cocktail are placed in small transparent or translucent (often glass or plastic) vials that are loaded into an instrument known as a liquid scintillation counter. Newer machines may use 96-well plates with individual filters in each well. Many counters have two photo multiplier tubes connected in a coincidence circuit. The coincidence circuit assures that genuine light pulses, which reach both photomultiplier tubes, are counted, while spurious pulses (due to line noise, for example), which would only affect one of the tubes, are ignored.

Counting efficiencies under ideal conditions range from about 30% for tritium (a low-energy beta emitter) to nearly 100% for phosphorus-32, a high-energy beta emitter. Some chemical compounds (notably chlorine compounds) and highly colored samples can interfere with the counting process. This interference, known as &quot;quenching&quot;, can be overcome through data correction or through careful sample preparation.

== Cherenkov counting ==
High-energy beta emitters, such as phosphorus-32 and yttrium-90 can also be counted in a scintillation counter without the cocktail, instead using an aqueous solution containing no scintillators. This technique, known as Cherenkov counting, relies on Cherenkov radiation being detected directly by the photomultiplier tubes. Cherenkov counting benefits from the use of plastic vials which scatter the emitted light, increasing the potential for light to reach the photomultiplier tube.

<text>The Champagne Stakes is an Australian Turf Club Group 1 horse race for two-year-old Thoroughbreds at set weights run at Randwick Racecourse, Sydney, Australia over a distance of 1,600 metres during the Sydney Autumn Carnival. Prize money is A$1,000,000.

==History==

The inaugural running of the race was on the second day of the Australian Jockey Club Autumn Meet in 1861 as the fourth race on the six race card. The winner was Exeter trained by the famous trainer of the time Etienne de Mestre. 
The race became the premier AJC sprint race for two-year-olds for nearly 80 years. With the introduction of the richer Golden Slipper Stakes in 1957, the AJC decided on extending the distance of the race to 1 mile (1972) and as such creating a natural progression for elite two year old races that is now known as the Juvenile Triple Crown – Golden Slipper Stakes, Sires Produce Stakes (ATC) and Champagne Stakes.

Six two-year-olds have won the Triple Crown: 
Baguette (1970), Luskin Star (1977), Tierce (1991), Burst (1992), Dance Hero (2004), Pierro (2012)
===1914 racebook===

===Records===

The record time for the race when the distance was 6 furlongs was by Vain in 1969 when he won by 10 lengths in a time of 1:09.40. At the time Vain became the richest money earning two year old in Australia.

The record time for the current 1600 metres distance is 1:33.31 set by Castelvecchio in 2019.

===Distance===
* 1861 - 5 furlongs (~1000m)
*1862–1864 - 1 mile (~1600m)
*1865–1866 - 7 furlongs (~1400m)
*1867–1880 - 5 furlongs (~1000m)
* 1881 - 6 furlongs (~1200m)
* 1882 - 5 furlongs (~1000m)
*1883–1971 - 6 furlongs (~1200m)

The Flying Childers Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to two-year-old horses. It is run at Doncaster over a distance of 5 furlongs and 3 yards (1,008 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.

==History==
The event is named after Flying Childers, a famous 18th-century racehorse bred at Carr House near Doncaster. It was established in 1967, and it was originally called the Norfolk Stakes. It was renamed when a different race became known as the Norfolk Stakes in 1973, and from this point it held Group 1 status. It was downgraded to Group 2 in 1979.

The Flying Childers Stakes is currently run on the third day of Doncaster&#x27;s four-day St Leger Festival, the day before the St Leger Stakes.

<text>The Royal Lodge Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to two-year-old colts and geldings. It is run on the Rowley Mile at Newmarket over a distance of 1 mile (1,609 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late September.

==History==
The event was established in 1946, and it was originally held at Ascot. It is named after Royal Lodge, a royal residence located in Windsor Great Park. It was initially contested over 5 furlongs and open to horses of either gender. It was extended to a mile in 1948, and restricted to colts and geldings in 1987.

The race was first staged at Newmarket in 2005, when Ascot was closed for redevelopment. It was transferred more permanently in 2011.

The Royal Lodge Stakes is sometimes included in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Challenge series, with the winner earning an automatic invitation to compete in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile Turf. Its latest period of inclusion began in 2012.

The race is currently held on the final day of Newmarket&#x27;s three-day Cambridgeshire Meeting, the same day as the Cambridgeshire Handicap.

<text>John Gordon &quot;Jack&quot; McClelland CC (July 30, 1922 – June 14, 2004) was a Canadian publisher. He was known for promoting Canadian writers as president of the McClelland and Stewart publishing house.
==Education and military service==
Born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, he attended the University of Toronto Schools, St. Andrew&#x27;s College (1937–1940), and then the University of Toronto, where he was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, interrupting his studies to serve in the Royal Canadian Navy in the Battle of the Atlantic. 
==Career==
McClelland began working for McClelland and Stewart, his father&#x27;s company, in 1946, becoming president in 1961. Under his control, the company promoted Canadian literature and encouraged Canadian authors such as Margaret Atwood, Pierre Berton, Leonard Cohen, Marian Engel, Farley Mowat and Mordecai Richler. He introduced a popular series of Canadian authors in paperback, making Canadian writing more accessible to the general public. &quot;I decided that I didn&#x27;t want to be dependent on foreign agencies,&quot; he would recall. &quot;I saw that a logical decision in London or New York could cut our volume in half. A Canadian nationalist was born overnight.&quot; In 1985, he sold the company.

Many subsequent heads of Canadian publishing companies got their start at McClelland and Stewart while Jack McClelland was running the company.

==Legacy and death==
In 1976 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 2000.

He had been in poor health for some time when he died in Toronto in 2004 at the age of 81.

Leonard Cohen expressed his gratitude to McClelland by dedicating his 2004 album &quot;Dear Heather&quot; to him. The liner notes read &quot;In memory of Jack McClelland, 1922–2004&quot;

<text>The Challenge Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run on the Rowley Mile at Newmarket over a distance of 7 furlongs (1,408 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in October.

==History==
The event was established in 1878, and the inaugural edition was titled the First Great Challenge Stakes. It was originally contested over six furlongs and open to horses aged two or older.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and for a period the Challenge Stakes held Group 3 status. It was extended to seven furlongs in 1977, and closed to two-year-olds in 1985. It was promoted to Group 2 level in 1987.

The race was formerly staged during Newmarket&#x27;s Champions&#x27; Day meeting in mid-October. It became part of a new fixture called Future Champions Day in 2011.

<doc id="742062" wikidata="Q7355216" url="?curid=742062" title="Rockfel Stakes">
<text>The Rockfel Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to two-year-old fillies. It is run on the Rowley Mile at Newmarket over a distance of 7 furlongs (1,408 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.

==History==
The event is named after Rockfel, a successful filly whose victories included two Classics in 1938. It was established in 1981, and its first winner was Top Hope.

The Rockfel Stakes attained Listed status in 1985, and it was promoted to Group 3 level in 1986. It was upgraded to Group 2 in 1998.

The race was formerly staged during Newmarket&#x27;s Champions&#x27; Day meeting in mid-October. It became part of a new fixture called Future Champions Day in 2011 and was moved to a September date from 2014, switching places in the calendar with the Fillies&#x27; Mile. The race is currently part of the Breeders&#x27; Cup Challenge and the winner earns an automatic place in the Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf race.

The leading horses from the Rockfel Stakes sometimes go on to compete in the following season&#x27;s 1000 Guineas. Four fillies have won both events, the most recent being Finsceal Beo (2006–07).

<doc id="742063" wikidata="Q241788" url="?curid=742063" title="Jodi Rell">
<text>Mary Carolyn Rell (née Reavis; June 16, 1946 – November 20, 2024) was an American politician who served as the 87th governor of Connecticut from 2004 to 2011. Rell also had served as the state&#x27;s 105th lieutenant governor of Connecticut from 1995 to 2004 under Governor John G. Rowland, and became governor after Rowland resigned from office. To date, Rell is the last Republican and last woman to serve as Governor of Connecticut.

Rell was Connecticut&#x27;s second female governor, after Ella Grasso. She did not seek re-election in 2010 and left office in January 2011.

==Early life==
Rell was born Mary Carolyn Reavis in Norfolk, Virginia, the daughter of Foy and Benjamin Reavis. She attended Old Dominion University, but left in 1967 to marry Lou Rell, a U.S. Navy pilot. The couple first moved to New Jersey, where Lou Rell took a position as a commercial airline pilot with Trans World Airlines. The family then moved to a 19th-century farmhouse in Brookfield, Connecticut, in 1969. Jodi Rell later attended, but did not graduate from, Western Connecticut State University. She received honorary law doctorates from the University of Hartford in 2001 and the University of New Haven in 2004. In 2015, she received an honorary doctorate degree of humane letters from Western Connecticut State University. In her early career, she tutored and did substitute work for the Hartford Public Schools.

==Early career==
Jodi Rell&#x27;s political career began as a campaign worker for Connecticut state Rep. David Smith during several of his campaigns. Smith, a pilot for Eastern Airlines, declined to seek re-election to a 5th term in the Connecticut House of Representatives in the 1984 election. He encouraged Rell to enter the race to succeed him. Rell was elected in 1984, representing the 107th District in northwestern Fairfield County, centered on Brookfield. She served from 1985 to 1995.

She became lieutenant governor after the 1994 election as John Rowland&#x27;s running mate and won re-election in 1998 and 2002, becoming governor in 2004 after Rowland resigned due to corruption.

==Governor of Connecticut (2004–2011)==
===Tenure===
In her first months in office, Rell had high approval ratings, with a December 2004 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll showing her at 80 percent, the highest rating ever measured by that poll for a governor in Connecticut. She announced in October 2005 she would seek a four-year term in 2006, and was nominated by the Republican Party in May 2006 to seek a full term of her own. Stamford businessman and former state representative Michael Fedele was nominated as her running mate as lieutenant governor.

Rell defeated her Democratic opponent, New Haven Mayor John DeStefano, Jr. in the 2006 Connecticut gubernatorial election. She received approximately 710,000 votes, the highest total for any gubernatorial candidate in Connecticut history. She carried all but seven towns.

Governor Rell was one of many Republicans mentioned as a potential candidate for vice president in the 2008 presidential election. The presidential nominee John McCain chose Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate instead.

In April 2008, Rell&#x27;s Lt. Governor, Michael Fedele told the media he expected Rell to run for re-election in 2010. In August 2008 she told reporters she would file an exploratory committee for a 2010 reelection bid. She announced on November 9, 2009, that she would not seek re-election. Democrat Dan Malloy succeeded Rell in office on January 5, 2011.
==== Abortion and embryonic stem-cell research ====
Governor Rell supported abortion rights, and she was supported by the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition and The WISH List, an abortion-rights Republican PAC. She supported abortion rights embryonic stem-cell research during her tenure as Governor.

====Education policy====
Rell supported a lawsuit in response to the federal No Child Left Behind Act. Connecticut&#x27;s Attorney General Richard Blumenthal filed the lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education to force Congress and President George W. Bush to amend the act because, Rell contended, it would compel Connecticut to spend tens of millions to meet impossibly high standards, even as the state&#x27;s schools perform at one of the highest levels in the nation. The act required states to pay for standardized testing every school year, instead of every two years. Rell&#x27;s State Department of Education said the extra testing would provide little new information about students&#x27; academic progress.

Rell delivered the 2008 commencement address at Central Connecticut State University.

====Government spending====
Rell supported the state&#x27;s constitutional spending cap resisting pressure from groups favoring expanded state government spending which would bypass the cap. As a result, in late June 2006 the state reported a $910 million surplus for the prior year and the state&#x27;s Rainy Day Fund exceeded $1 billion in deposits for the first time. In 2007 she shocked many of her supporters by proposing additional spending for education that would cause the state budget to significantly exceed the spending cap. Paying for the increased spending would require raising the state income tax. Republican legislators and a few Democrats, including (at least initially) House Speaker James Amann, as well as many others, were skeptical when Rell claimed her plan would reduce property taxes. And as public opinion polls showed steadfast opposition to an income tax hike, she changed her mind and withdrew her support for increased educational spending. Rell originally had the support of the Connecticut Education Association for her proposal, but they later switched to the Democratic plan favoring even higher state taxes and no limits on property tax increases. On May 9, 2007, Rell announced increased state revenues might make a tax hike unnecessary in 2007. On June 1, 2007, Rell vetoed a Democratic plan that increased the income tax. A compromise education plan passed both houses of the legislature in late June that did not increase the income tax, but raised the cigarette tax and did not limit property taxes. It nonetheless exceeded the state spending cap.
In 2005, Rell agreed to a plan to revive the Connecticut estate tax, applying to estates worth $2 million or more. Critics said the tax would encourage wealthy citizens to leave and take their money with them.
In 2005, Rell signed into law a campaign finance bill that banned contributions from lobbyists and would provide public financing for future campaigns. The law received support from Arizona Senator John McCain, who campaigned for Rell in Hartford on March 17, 2006.

In June 2006, Rell intervened with New London city officials, proposing that homeowners displaced by the Kelo v. New London court decision be deeded property so they may retain homes in the neighborhood. A settlement was reached with the homeowners on June 30, 2006.

In 2007, Rell clashed with Democratic lawmakers over state bonding issues. Explaining that she felt the Democratic proposal spent too much money which the state could not afford, she called on them to renegotiate a new package with less spending. In October an agreement was reached that reduced the bond package by $400 million and the Governor signed it into law.

In September 2010, Rell was one of seven governors to receive a grade of F in the Cato Institute&#x27;s fiscal-policy report card.

====Health care====
In July 2009, the Connecticut legislature overrode a veto by Rell to pass SustiNet, the first significant public-option health care reform legislation in the nation.

====Law and order====
One of Rell&#x27;s first major decisions as governor was, on August 25, 2004, to end the system put into place by the previous administration of housing prisoners in out-of-state corrections facilities. &quot;Instead of sending inmates and tax dollars out of state, we can now more fully utilize correctional facilities and personnel in Connecticut,&quot; Governor Rell said. &quot;It makes good policy and good fiscal sense.&quot; She continued, &quot;This approach is in the best interests of the inmates, their families and our correction system. It will keep offenders closer to their families, their communities and to the support that is so critical for their successful reintegration into society.&quot;

During Rell&#x27;s administration, Connecticut carried out the first execution in New England since 1960 when serial killer Michael Bruce Ross was put to death on May 13, 2005. Rell, who supports the death penalty, declined a request by Ross&#x27;s lawyers to delay the execution in order for the state legislature to debate eliminating the death penalty. Legally, the Governor of Connecticut cannot commute a death sentence.

Rell faced another criminal justice issue in July 2007, when two paroled convicts were charged with the home invasion murders of the Petit family in Cheshire. Rell announced a panel would review the state&#x27;s parole policies and create a study on the topic. She also reiterated her support of capital punishment. On July 31, 2007, she announced tighter parole policies and asked the legislature to define burglary of an occupied dwelling as a violent crime. In September 2007, she announced a moratorium on the parole of violent offenders. State Senator Sam Caligiuri had called for a full moratorium in July. Ironically, the man Rell appointed to chair the parole board, Robert Farr, wrote an op-ed for the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; defending the state&#x27;s parole system. Rell announced in September that she does not believe Connecticut needs to build new prisons, send inmates out of state or expand any of the corrections facilities.

In January 2008, Rell reached agreement with legislative leaders on a number of criminal justice reforms which were responsive to the systemic failures that occurred before the Cheshire home invasion. A special session in late January passed laws to toughen penalties for home invasion and to tighten parole procedures, but did not pass a Three Strikes Law which Rell, Caligiuri, and Senate Minority Leader John McKinney had favored.

Rell reiterated her call for a Three Strikes law on March 31, 2008, following the kidnapping and murder of an elderly New Britain woman, crimes committed by a convicted sex offender recently released from a Connecticut prison.

====LGBT policy====

On April 20, 2005, Rell signed into law a bill that made Connecticut the first state to adopt civil unions for same-sex couples without being directed to do so by a court. The law gives same-sex couples all of the 300+ rights, responsibilities, and privileges that the state gives to heterosexual couples, including the right to adopt children, awarding state income tax credits, inheritance rights, and allowing same-sex partners to be considered next-of-kin when it comes to making medical decisions for incapacitated partners, yet does not require employers to give equal insurance benefits as they would to heterosexual couples. The bill was amended to define marriage as &quot;between a man and a woman&quot; after Rell threatened a veto. Rell signed the bill despite some Republican opposition to it, including from the Chairman of the State Republicans at the time.

Rell had announced that were the legislature to pass a bill establishing gay marriage in Connecticut, that she would veto the bill.

On October 10, 2008, Connecticut courts ruled that the ban of gay marriage violated citizens rights guaranteed to them by the constitution. Governor Jodi Rell responded by saying she would not fight the decision. &quot;The Supreme Court has spoken,&quot; she stated &quot;I do not believe their voice reflects the majority of the people of Connecticut. However, I am also firmly convinced that attempts to reverse this decision, either legislatively or by amending the state Constitution, will not meet with success.&quot; However, on April 23, 2009, Rell signed a bill into law providing for a gender neutral marriage statute. It also provided for civil unions to be automatically transformed into marriages on October 1, 2010.

====Minimum wage====
In May 2008, Rell vetoed a bill to raise the minimum wage in the state of Connecticut. The legislature successfully voted to override Rell&#x27;s veto in June 2008. The legislation raised Connecticut&#x27;s minimum wage at the time, $7.65 an hour to $8.00 an hour beginning in January 2009, and to $8.25 an hour in 2010.

==Electoral history==

<text>Peter Gammons (born April 9, 1945) is an American media personality and recipient of the J. G. Taylor Spink Award for outstanding baseball writing, given by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America.

==Early life==
Gammons was born in Boston and raised in Groton, Massachusetts, where he graduated from Groton School. After graduating from Groton in 1965, he attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a member of St. Anthony Hall. He worked for the university&#x27;s student-run newspaper, &quot;The Daily Tar Heel,&quot; and the student-run radio station, WXYC.

== Career ==

=== Print ===
After graduating in 1969, he began his journalism career at &quot;The Boston Globe.&quot; Gammons was a featured writer at &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; for many years as the main journalist covering the Boston Red Sox. (1969–1975, 1978–1986), or as a national baseball columnist. For many years he was a colleague of other legendary Globe sports writers Will McDonough, Bob Ryan and Leigh Montville. Between his two stints as a baseball columnist with the &quot;Globe&quot;, he was lead baseball columnist for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; (1976–78, 1986–90), where he covered baseball, hockey, and college basketball. Gammons also wrote a column for &quot;The Sporting News&quot; in the 1980s.

Gammons has also authored numerous baseball books, including &quot;Beyond the Sixth Game&quot;.

=== TV work ===
In 1988, he joined ESPN, where he served primarily as an in-studio analyst. During the baseball season, he appeared nightly on &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; and had regular spots on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, &quot;ESPNEWS&quot; and ESPN Radio. He wrote an Insider column for ESPN.com and also wrote for &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot;. The Globe reprinted some of his ESPN columns well into the 1990s. In 2006, Gammons was named as one of two field-level reporters for ESPN&#x27;s Sunday Night Baseball, joining Bonnie Bernstein. He held that position through the 2008 season, when he moved exclusively to baseball.

After being out for illness, Gammons returned to ESPN on Wednesday, September 20, 2006. He reported from Fenway Park on the 6 P.M. edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and the 7 P.M. edition of Baseball Tonight. Gammons resumed his regular reporting coverage during the 2007 baseball season.

After 20 years with ESPN, on December 8, 2009, Gammons announced that he would leave ESPN to pursue &quot;new challenges&quot; and a &quot;less demanding schedule&quot;. Gammons joined the MLB Network and MLB.com as on-air and online analyst. He also works for NESN.

At this event, Theo Epstein, Vice President and General Manager of the Boston Red Sox, announced a new scholarship in Gammons&#x27; name.

== Music ==

Gammons has a penchant for indie rock and the blues, and is active in the Boston indie rock scene when his other commitments allow him time; he has been sighted at several Midnight Oil shows and has mentioned the band in several columns. He is also a fan of Pearl Jam and has talked about experiences at concerts as well as previous albums (as heard on various ESPN Radio shows). With the assistance of a band of Boston musicians and former Boston Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein, Gammons plays a Fender Stratocaster and sings at the annual Hot Stove, Cool Music concert event to benefit Theo and Paul Epstein&#x27;s Foundation To Be Named Later, a charity that raises funds and awareness for non-profit agencies serving disadvantaged youth in the Greater Boston area.

Gammons&#x27; debut album, &quot;Never Slow Down, Never Grow Old&quot;, was released on July 4, 2006. Gammons sang and played guitar on this collection of originals and covers that includes The Clash&#x27;s &quot;Death or Glory&quot; and Warren Zevon&#x27;s &quot;Model Citizen&quot;. Proceeds again went to Epstein&#x27;s charity.

Gammons founded the Hot Stove Cool Music benefit concert series with sportswriter Jeff Horrigan, Casey Riddles, Debbi Wrobleski, Mindy d&#x27;Arbeloff and singer Kay Hanley in December 2000. The fundraiser now takes place twice each year with one show in January and another in July or August.

Gammons is tightly connected to the Boston rock scene. He even served as minister at the November 2007 marriage of bassist Ed Valauskas (Gravel Pit, the Gentlemen) and singer Jennifer D&#x27;Angora (Downbeat 5, the Dents, Jenny Dee and the Deelinquents).

==Personal life==
He lives in Boston, Massachusetts and Cape Cod, Massachusetts with his wife, Gloria.

On June 27, 2006, Gammons was stricken with the rupture of a brain aneurysm in the morning near his home on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. He was initially rushed to Falmouth Hospital before being airlifted to Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital in Boston. At Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital, Gammons&#x27; operation was performed by neurosurgeon Dr. Arthur Day, who was a friend to late Red Sox hitter Ted Williams. Sportswriter Bob Ryan of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that Gammons was expected to be in intensive care for 10 to 12 days. He was resting in intensive care following the operation, and doctors listed him in &quot;good&quot; condition the following day.

On July 17, he was released from the hospital and entered the Rehabilitation Hospital of the Cape and Islands.

On August 19, Gammons made his first public appearance since the aneurysm rupture at Fenway Park when the Red Sox played the Yankees.

<doc id="742067" wikidata="Q1057118" url="?curid=742067" title="Chenla">
<text>Chenla or Zhenla (; , ; ) is the Chinese designation for the vassal of the kingdom of Funan preceding the Khmer Empire that existed from around the late 6th to the early 9th century in Indochina. The name was still used in the 13th century by the Chinese envoy Zhou Daguan, author of &quot;The Customs of Cambodia&quot;. It appears on the Mao Kun map. However, modern historiography applies the name exclusively to the period from the late 6th to the early 9th century. This period of Cambodian history is known by historians as the Pre-Angkor period. It is doubted whether Chenla ever existed as a unitary kingdom, or if this is a misconception by Chinese chroniclers. Most modern historians assert that &quot;Chenla&quot; was in fact just a series of loose and temporary confederations of principalities in the pre-Angkor period.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Chenla&quot; or &quot;Zhenla&quot; was the name given in Chinese accounts of an entity that sent tributes to Chinese emperors. The word &quot;Chenla&quot; or &quot;Zhenla&quot; and likewise &quot;Funan&quot; are unknown in the Old Khmer language. Folk etymology attempts to link Chenla (真臘) to a translation of its Chinese name as &quot;Pure Beeswax&quot;, which was one of its regional commodities mentioned in Chinese annals. It has been suggested that the name means &quot;Defeated Siam&quot; as Zhenla has been reconstructed to &quot;Tsienliäp&quot; in Tang dynasty pronunciation, which is similar in sound to the Cambodian town Siem Reap whose name is often taken to mean &quot;Flattened Siam&quot;. However, it has been pointed out that this derivation is problematic as conflicts between Siam and Cambodia occurred centuries after the name was first used. Therefore, although the names Chenla and Siem Reap could perhaps be related, Michael Vickery argued that the original meanings of both names are unknown.

Similar explanation however may apply to a later variant form Zhanla (占臘); according to author Peter Harris: &quot;It very likely means &#x27;Defeated Chams&#x27; since Zhan is the word in Chinese for Cham.&quot; He also noted the explanation given in &quot;Mingshi&quot;: &quot;During the &quot;qingyuan&quot; reign period (1195–1200) of the Song dynasty, Cambodia wiped out Champa and took over its land. Because of this, the country changed its name to Zhanla. But during the Yuan dynasty it went on being called Zhenla.&quot;

Chen La may have been known through several other names such as &quot;Wen Dan&quot; (文單 reconstructed as &quot;Muntal&quot;, maybe mandala) or according to Tatsuo Hoshino Po-Lou, Wen Dan being its capital.

Following Hindu god king (devaraja) tradition the king chose the Sanskrit name of a patron deity or an avatar, followed by the suffix –varman, meaning &#x27;protected by&#x27;, obeying the code of conduct Manusmṛti, the &quot;Laws of Manu&quot; for the Kshatriya warrior caste.

==History==
=== Origins ===
Most of the Chinese recordings on Chenla, including that of Chenla conquering Funan have been contested since the 1970s as they are generally based on single remarks in the Chinese annals. The History of the Chinese Sui dynasty contains entries of a state called Chenla, a vassal of the Kingdom of Funan, which had sent an embassy to China in 616 or 617, yet under its ruler, Citrasena Mahendravarman, conquered Funan after Chenla had gained independence.

Like its superior Funan, Chenla occupied a strategic position where the maritime trade routes of the Indosphere and the East Asian cultural sphere converged, resulting in prolonged socio-economic and cultural influence and the adoption of the epigraphic system of the south Indian Pallava dynasty and Chalukya dynasty.

The origins of Chenla&#x27;s aristocracy, whom author Michael Vickery called the &quot;Dângrêk Chieftains&quot;, are obscure. These were local principalities north and south of the Dângrêk Mountains, who left behind the oldest known stone epigraphs in the region, bearing genealogical records that suggest increasing political dominance. The first known princes are mentioned in some early inscriptions. The Sanskrit inscription of Vãl Kantél, Stung Treng province names a ruler Vīravarman, who as his name suggests (his father&#x27;s name was Sārvabhauma) had adopted the idea of divine kingship and deployed the concept of Harihara, a Hindu &quot;god that embodied multiple conceptions of power&quot;. His successors continued this tradition, thus conveying the idea of a correlation between political and religious authority.

The &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; asserts that shortly after 706, the country was split into and . The names signify a northern and a southern half, which may conveniently be referred to as Upper (northern) and Lower (southern) Chenla. By the late 8th century Water Chenla had become dependent on the thalassocratic Shailendra dynasty on Java and the Srivijaya city-state on Sumatra. The last of Water Chenla&#x27;s kings seems to have been killed and the polity incorporated into the Javanese monarchy around the year 790. Land Chenla maintained its integrity under Jayavarman II, who proclaimed the Khmer Empire in 802.

Originally one of the regional centers of Funan with an unknown degree of sovereignty, Chenla was recognized by a foreign power as a separate political entity at the end of the sixth century, Bhavavarman I its independent ruler. Considerable scholarly discord prevails regarding the exact geographic origin, the extent, dynamic and chronology of territorial expansion and in particular, the religious and political center of Chenla and whether or not it consisted of a unified people under a single leader.

Late 20th century scholars &quot;began cautiously to move away from the established historiographical framework&quot; which had been laid out mainly by George Cœdès, who relies on external sources, specifically the Chinese annals, for its reconstruction. Michael Vickery suggests that ancient authors allocated the name &quot;Chenla&quot; to numerous small principalities and bundled them up as one singular entity in order to classify a larger number of people under the same characteristics, omitting distinctions between individual states. This approach explains why there was a noticeable increase in stone inscriptions during the seventh century. Multiple independent territories would produce their own recordings and written regulations, whereas in one polity only a tiny elite would be allowed access to such tasks.

Before historians had begun to analyse and use epigraphic sources in great numbers, all available evidence supported the idea that the center of the Chenla principality must be located at Mount Phu Kao - Lingaparvata (the mountain of the linga) in Champasak Province, Laos once belonging to the Khmer civilization. The local Vat Phou stele mentions the name of King Devanika (Fan Chen-ch&#x27;eng), king of kings - yet researchers do not relate the monarch to the &quot;Dangrek Chieftains&quot;. Contrary to the academic conclusions, Cambodian legend tells that &quot;the origin of the kings of Cambodia goes back to the union of the hermit Kambu Svayambhuva, an eponymic ancestor of the Kambujas, with the celestial nymph Mera, who was given to him by Siva.&quot; The king Srutavarman was born of this couple, who was followed by his son, king Sreshthavarman. This king gave his name to Sreshthapura - believed to be Vat Phou. At the end of the sixth century, Bhavavarman and Chitrasena (royal title: Mahendravarman) attacked Funan together and subdued it around 627–649.

The obvious fact that Funan and Chenla are &quot;vague concepts&quot; that do not apply to a tribe, a nation or a people is at odds with the Cambodian legends of origin. Folklore follows an unflinching narrative like that of a single ruler such as King Devanika - the reconsecrated &quot;maharajadhiraja&quot; (king of kings) of Mount Phu Kao where &quot;the people that lived in the region along with the people who came with Devanika, became the forerunners of the prosperous Khmer people&quot;.

=== Water and Land Chenla ===

The Tang histories mentioned that after the end of the reign of shénlóng (神龍) (i.e. after 6 February 707) Zhēnlà came to be divided in two realms, Lùzhēnlà (陸真臘) (&quot;, also called Wèndān (文單) or Pólòu (婆鏤)) and Shuīzhēnlà (水真臘) (&quot;) returned to the anarchic state that had existed before it was unified under the kings of Funan and the first kings of Chenla. On the other hand, Water Chenla was associated with the Mekong Delta and had access to the river and its benefits, but this advantage had its downfalls as it made Water Chenla more susceptible to attacks.

Late in the 8th century AD, it faced war from Javanese pirates that ultimately took over the Mekong Delta and then later took over the entire Chenla Empire. However author Michael Vickery asserts that these categories of Water and Land Chenla created by the Chinese are misleading and meaningless because the best evidence shows that until 802 AD, there was no single, great state in the land of ancient Cambodia, but a number of smaller ones.

In the view of the historian Sujit Wongthes, Land Chenla is located in Isan (northeast Thailand), while Water Chenla is situated on the Tonlé Sap area in Cambodia.

=== Decline ===

The number of inscriptions declined sharply during the eighth century. However, some theorists, who have examined the Chinese transcripts, claim that Chenla started falling during the 700s as a result of both internal divisions and external attacks by the Shailendra dynasty of Java, who eventually took over and joined under the Angkor kingdom of Jayavarman II. According to the Sdok Kak Thom inscription (1053), Jayavarman II and his son Indrayudha defeated a Cham army in 790, then moved to north of the Tonle Sap, established the city of Hariharalaya, 15 kilometers south of Angkor.

Individually, historians reject a classical decline scenario, arguing there was no Chenla to begin with, rather a geographic region had been subject to prolonged periods of contested rule, with turbulent successions and an obvious incapability to establish a lasting centre of gravity. Historiography ends this era of nameless upheaval only in the year 802, when Jayavarman II established the appropriately named Khmer Empire.

== Society ==

=== Capital ===
According to George Cœdès, Champasak was the origin of the ruling dynasty of Chenla and Vat Phou its spiritual center. Coedès and contemporary scholars refer to the historical annals of the Sui dynasty, which mention Chenla and identify its royal residence to be near a mountain named Ling-jia-bo-po or Lingaparvata, a temple was constructed on its summit. Vat Phou is an enormously impressive Khmer Hindu temple located at the base of Mount Phu Kao in Laos, which leads theorists to speculate that Phu Kao is the mountain that is referenced in the passage and that Wat Phou could be the temple mentioned; however this view is not accepted by modern scholarship.

Authors Claude Jacques and Michael Vickery question the identification of Phu Kao as &quot;Lingjiabopo&quot;/Lingaparvata because there are a number of hills in Cambodia that apply to the vague descriptions. Thus, the debate remains and the existence of Chenla as a unitary state or a capital at Vat Phou is questionable. Since there is not much evidence or writings from the time period, not much can be said about the region. The Chinese annals are one of the very few sources scholars can analyze and derive information from.

The people of Chenla, whose base was Champassak in about 550, established their capital city at Isanapura (Sambhupura) by about 600.

According to Paul Pelliot, Sambhupura was the capital of (Upper Chenla) and Vyadhapura was the capital of (Lower Chenla).

=== Rulers ===

Traditionally leaders were chosen based on their merit in battle and their ability to attract a large following; however, as rulers gained more power moving away from the commoners horizon, a shift from measure of capability towards patrilineal descent occurred. Adoption of the idea of the Hindu state with its consecrated military leader, the &quot;Varman&quot;—protector king was the ideological basis for control and supremacy.

All essential elements of Bhavavarman&#x27;s life and most of his descendants are known only through epigraphy. Interpreted as to be Vīravarman&#x27;s successor and after gaining independence (&quot;he has conquered his throne at the tip of his sword&quot;) ruler of the eastern portions of his father&#x27;s realm, he &quot;built a temple in 598 during his reign in [...] the center of the kingdom of Bhavapura&quot;. Mahendravarman is, according to epigraphy, also Vīravarman&#x27;s son and attributed as to be the conqueror of Funan.

Succession is unclear, because &quot;this at the same time eliminates his son Bhavavarman I of the royal function&quot; Historian Michael Vickery resolves: &quot;Bhavavarman and...Citrasena [Mahendravarman&#x27;s given name] attacked Funan&quot; [together]. Isanavarman is the founder of a new capital - Isanapura north of the Tonlé Sap (the archaeological site of Sambor Prei Kuk). His son Bhavavarman II - is mentioned only once in an inscription in the year 644. Jayavarman I is the last ruler of a united Chenla. He is the son and successor of the obscure Candravarman.

=== Religion ===
==== Funan legacy ====
During the reign of the Funan empire, residents were still burying their dead with grave goods, but also practicing cremation, according to archaeological finds. Both Hinduism and Buddhism arrived in Southeast Asia through the Funan trade networks. A few surviving inscriptions with verses in Sanskrit and some small statuary and other relics are physical indications of both Buddhist and Hindu belief systems present in Funan culture. The transition from Funan to Chenla is not clearly understood, but by the 6th century CE, the Kingdom of Chenla was established, with Chinese sources suggesting a people speaking the Khmer language conquered Funan and founded Chenla.

==== Royal Hindu and Buddhist cults ====
Archaeological evidence indicates Sambor Prei Kuk (Isanapura) was a major Chenla settlement and possibly the royal capital. The city was divided into three areas, each of which had a brick large sanctuary or temple, apparently centred around a &quot;lingus&quot; similar to Hindu phallic representations of Shiva. Kings of Chenla mentioned in inscriptions generally carry the name of a local Hindu deity with the affix &quot;-varman&quot; (Sanskrit for &quot;protected by&quot;), such as &quot;Bhavavarman&quot; and &quot;Isanavarman&quot;. The kings seem to have undergone a process of Indianization to consolidate and magnify their rule.

A sculpture called Harihara, a combined form of Vishnu and Shiva, is also frequently depicted in religious establishments. This could portray a Chenla belief that there is an equal balance between creation and destruction in the universe and that when one substance is terminated, another is produced to replace it. Other Hindu gods Brahma and Indra along with deities such as Krishna Govardhana, Lakshmi, etc. were also worshipped. An epigraph from Siem Reap Province testified that during the late 8th century, it was evidently that Buddhists in Cambodia worshipped bodhisattvas.

Also originating from India, Buddhism, although not as preeminent as Hinduism, peacefully coexisted with Hinduism in Chenla; two schools of Buddhism were identified from a sculpture found that depicted twelve images of Buddha. This shows that the kings did not seem to enforce their religious views on their people and that influences of all kinds were creating a diverse community in Chenla. According to the Indian historian Himanchu Prabha Ray, Buddhism was an effective motivating factor in the expansion of maritime trading networks from India to eastern lands while Brahmanic Hinduism revolved more around an agrarian economy.

==== Local indigenous deity cults ====
Despite Hinduism and Buddhism apparently playing an important role in royal cults, textual evidence suggests they were only widely practiced by the Chenla elite. Farmers outside the urban centres generally had Khmer names rather than Sanskrit names, and paid tribute to regional landowners carrying the Khmer title &quot;poñ&quot;, who constructed temples dedicated to both Hindu and local deities. Wealth and power in these outlying agricultural regions was transmitted through the female line of inheritance, indicating matrilineal succession was probably the original norm in Southeast Asia. The local deities worshipped were usually female, and there is also evidence of ancestor worship. Although most of these local temples were built out of wood, and were thus lost, written documents make clear they were the norm in the Kingdom of Chenla. No doubt some locals converted to the new Indian religions, but the vast majority of the population probably venerated the local goddesses and gods and their ancestors in their own villages, while acknowledging the public Hindu and Buddhist cults, such as with occasional sacrifices and attending public ceremonies in Hindu temples in the cities. It&#x27;s also possible that some local deities were absorbed into the Hindu pantheon. The Chenla kings maintained a liberal religious policy, allowing their subjects to practice their traditional local religions, until the Khmer Empire was established in the early 9th century.

=== Religious structures ===
By the close of the century, the Chenla region was dotted with temples and shrines to the Hindu Gods. Many commoners were involved in the upkeep of these religious complexes and citizens of Chenla were expected to donate land, goods, and slaves to them. The great temple foundations consisted of their own holdings of land and people, functioning as powerful corporations; even minor temples had establishments and collected taxes. While kings had established these temples as a means to increase their power, in reality, these structures might have been taking away valuable land and citizens from the empire; the taxes collected by the temples could have meant more wealth for the leader.

However, these structures may also be factor that stabilized the kingdom and allowed the king to expand and attract more civilians who followed Hindu beliefs as Hinduism served as a reason for people to follow the king&#x27;s rule. Also, incorporation of these establishments could appeal to foreigners who would bring their trade, business, and goods to the area, making it more economically efficient.

==== Architecture ====
The design of the temples and shrines was greatly influenced by the prosperous Gupta state of northern and central India. The temple complexes were brick and stone based with a protruding statue representing a Hindu God or Buddha as the central focus of the building. Sandstone was the prominent material utilized for more important temples and was derived from the Kulen Mountains. Because of its heavy weight, it required a lot of manpower, which usually involved slaves.

Cremation burials lined with bricks were also discovered. These structures are supposed to be devoted to the veneration of members of the Brahmin caste since the burials had been carried out according to Hindu practice.

=== Social hierarchy ===
Social status was determined based on one&#x27;s knowledge of language, primarily Khmer or Sanskrit. Sanskrit was the language of the Gods, thus it was considered more valuable; the division between who worked the fields and who completed more worthy tasks was based on how well they knew Sanskrit. People who succeeded in educating themselves earned higher ranks such as being an official or even royal servant. However the majority of residents who lacked the ability to gain Sanskrit names spent their lives producing a surplus for the benefit of temples and ancestral Gods.

This depicts the impact Hinduism had on early Cambodian societies. Sanskrit, the language associated with Hinduism, was considered more valuable than the native Khmer language. This may show that the society before Indianization occurred in early South East Asia was unstable and that people latched onto teachings from foreigners because they had no permanent religious or social structures themselves.

Although a social hierarchy existed, there was no discrimination between genders. Women were not considered second class citizens rather many women played central roles in rituals, specialized in crafts, and were given ranks as high officials. This may because until recently, families followed matrilineal heritages instead of a patriarchal society, thus some aspects of the earlier society were retained.

==== Slavery ====
Many commoners were assigned to serve as workers that cleaned, cooked, and built temples and shrines without any compensation. From analyzing ancient inscriptions, Judith Jacob has discovered that there were fourteen categories of slaves in Chenla distinguished by different origins and kinds of duties. These groups of people could be bought, sold, and given away, having no freedom to escape because their parents were in need of money or they had to pay off debts that they contracted or were passed on in their family.

=== Economy ===
The wealth of Chenla and its surrounding territories was derived from wet-rice agriculture and from the mobilization of manpower rather than from subsistence farming such as in the past. Productive lands were donated to temples where slaves worked the fields and helped the temples generate revenue. The kingdom sustained an extensive irrigation system which manufactured rice surpluses that formed the bulk of their trade. International trade is believed to have been essential to the kingdom. But by the time of early 7th century, Cambodian society was in an economic shift from trading orientation to more an agrarian focusing. Trading centers near the coast of Funan period were collapsing, while inland agrarian centers emerged.

In the remains of the main port, Oc Eo, (now in Vietnam) materials from Rome, Greece and Persia have been found, as well as artifacts from India and neighboring states. Indian influences might have been so alluring because Indian merchants who traded with early Cambodians had wealth and were prosperous, qualities to strive for, therefore there was little to no hesitance in adopting the religion of another culture.

==Historiography and Chinese sources==

It was Īśānavarman I who managed to absorb the ancient territories of Funan which led the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot; compiled by Ouyang Xiu and Song Qi in 1060 to attribute the effective conquest of the country to him. The earliest known date of the reign of Īśānavarman, a date that must not have been long after his accession, is that of his first embassy to the court of Suí China in 616–17. This king is also known from his own inscriptions, one incised at Īśānapura, dated 13 September 627 AD (K. 604), the other one at Khău Nôy (Thailand), dated 7 May 637 (K. 506).

After Īśānavarman, who ceased to reign around 637, the inscriptions tell us of a king named Bhavavarman (II). The only dated inscriptions we have from him, are that of Tà Kev (K. 79), dated 5 January 644 and of Poñā Hòr south of Tà Kev (K. 21). dated Wednesday, 25 March 655. Then seemingly follows a certain king Candravarman, known from the undated inscription K. 1142 of unknown origin who hailed from the family of Īśānavarman. The son of Candravarman was the famous king Jayavarman I whose earliest inscriptions are from Tûol Kôk Práḥ, province Prei Vêṅ (K. 493) and from Bàsêt, province Bằttaṃbaṅ (K. 447), both dated 14 June 657.

Some 19 or 20 inscriptions dating from his reign have been found in an area extending from Vat Phu&#x27;u in the north to the Gulf of Siam in the south. According to the &quot;Xīn Táng shū&quot; the kingdom of Zhēnlà had conquered different principalities in Northwestern Cambodia after the end of the Chinese era name &quot;yǒnghuī&quot; (永徽) (i. e. after 31 January 656), which previously (in 638/39) paid tribute to China. The reign of Jayavarman I lasted about thirty years and ended perhaps after 690. It seems that after the death of Jayavarman I (his last known inscription K. 561 is dated 681/82), turmoil came upon the kingdom and at the start of the 8th century, the kingdom broke up into many principalities.

The region of Angkor was ruled by his daughter, Queen Jayadevī who complained in her Western Bàrày inscription K. 904, dated Wednesday, 5 April 713, of &quot;bad times&quot;. The Táng histories tell us that after the end of the &quot;shénlóng&quot; (神龍) era (after 6 February 707) Zhēnlà came to be divided in two realms, Lùzhēnlà (陸真臘) (&quot;Land Zhēnlà&quot;, also called Wèndān (文單) or Pólòu (婆鏤)) and Shuīzhēnlà (水真臘) (&quot;Water Zhēnlà&quot;) and returned to the anarchic state that had existed before it was unified under the kings of Funan and the first kings of Zhēnlà.

Kings like Śrutavarman and Śreṣṭhavarman or Puṣkarākṣa are only attested very much later in Angkorian inscriptions; their historicity is doubtful. Land Zhēnlà sent an embassy to China in 717, aided Mai Thúc Loan&#x27;s rebellion against the Chinese (722–723). Another embassy visiting China in 750 came probably from Water Zhēnlà. According to the Chinese Annals a son of the king of Wèndān had visited Chinas in 753 and joined a Chinese army during a campaign against Nanzhao () in the following year.

After the Wèndān embassy in the year 771 the heir-apparent Pómí () came to the imperial court and, on 13 December 771, he received there the title &quot;Kaifu Yitong Sansi&quot; (), one of the highest honorific titles. In 799 an envoy from Wèndān called Lītóují () received a Chinese title, too. As rulers of Śambhupura are attested by the inscription K. 124, dated 803/04 a king Indraloka and three successive queens, Nṛpatendradevī, Jayendrabhā and Jyeṣṭhāryā.
Two inscriptions refer to a ruler named Jayavarman: the first one, K. 103, hails from Práḥ Thãt Práḥ Srĕi south of Kompoṅ Čàṃ, dated 20 April 770, the second one from Lobŏ&#x27;k Srót in the vicinity of Kračèḥ near Śambhupura (K. 134), dated 781.

Cœdès called him Jayavarman Ibis, but probably he is identical with Jayavarman II, the founding father of the Angkorian kingdom, as Vickery has pointed out: &quot;Not only was Jayavarman II from the South; more than any other known king, he had particularly close links with Vyādhapura. This place is recorded in only one pre-Angkor inscription, K. 109/655 [exactly: 10th February 656], but in 16 Angkor-period texts, the last dated 1069 [K. 449 from Pàlhàl, dated Sunday, 3rd May 1069] ... Two of them, K. 425/968 and K. 449/1069, are explicit records of Jayavarman II taking people from Vyādhapura to settle in Battambang.&quot;

== Conflicting records ==
According to the inscription from Čăn Năk&#x27;ôn in Basăk/Laos (K. 363) Vīravarman was the father of Citrasena (royal title Mahendravarman) who was the younger brother of Bhavavarman. Obviously both princes had the same mother, but different fathers, which was corroborated by the Si Tep inscription (in present-day Thailand) giving the information that Bhavavarman was the son of a Prathivīndravarman and grandson of a Cakravartin whereas the inscription from Pak Mun in Ubon/Thailand informs us that the name of the father of Vīravarman was called Sārvabhauma.

All these inscriptions refer to a large territory ruled by these kings. It is recorded in the inscription from Robaṅ Romãs at Īśānapura (the archaeological site of Sambor Prei Kuk) that a certain Narasiṃhagupta, who was vassal (&quot;samāntanṛpa&quot;) of the successive kings Bhavavarman, Mahendravarman (the ruling name of Citrasena) and Īśānavarman erected on 13 April 598 during the reign of Bhavavarman a figure of Kalpavāsudeva (Vishnu).

This coincides with the oldest Chinese text that mentions Chenla, the &quot;Suí shū&quot; (Annals of the Suí Dynasty), compiled by Wèi Zhēng (580–643) in AD 636, which gives the information that at the beginning of the 7th century Chenla was ruled by Citrasena and Īśānavarman. The capital of the latter was Īśānapura, while his predecessor Bhavavarman I still resided at Bhavapura, a place which probably is located in the vicinity of the modern town of Thala Barivat (13°33′ N, 105°57′ E). An inscription dating from the reign of Isanarvarman I asserts that he was &quot;the King of Kings, who rules over Suvarnabhumi as far as the sea&quot; [&quot;Samudra-paryanta Suvarṇabhūmi&quot;], thus identifying Chenla with Suvarnabhumi.

<doc id="742072" wikidata="Q1846505" url="?curid=742072" title="Animal (Muppet)">
<text>Animal is a Muppet character from the sketch comedy television series &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, and the wild and frenzied drummer of the fictional band Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem. The character was performed originally by Frank Oz and currently by Eric Jacobson. His original concept sketches, which show him as a very hairy human, were drawn by Bonnie Erickson and Jim Henson.

==Characteristics==
Original performer Frank Oz has stated that Animal&#x27;s character can be summed up in five words: sex, sleep, food, drums, and pain. Animal&#x27;s vocabulary is generally monosyllabic and limited to guttural shouts and grunts, often repeating a few simple phrases, as well as his trademark gravelly laugh. During performances, Animal is usually chained to the drum set by a collar around his neck, as his musical outbursts are extremely violent. In some episodes, he has been summoned to chase off performers who are &#x27;being annoying&#x27;.

From &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; (1979), as the members of Electric Mayhem introduce themselves:
Unique among characters on the show, Floyd Pepper has trained his fellow musician to obey a few simple off-drum commands correctly, suggesting dog training.

Animal&#x27;s bushy eyebrows and hair, outrageous behavior, and wild drumming has sometimes been compared to several classical hard-partying Id-worshipping rock drummers, such as The Who&#x27;s Keith Moon, Led Zeppelin&#x27;s John Bonham, and Cream&#x27;s Ginger Baker. Animal is a savant, versatile session drummer, to back Muppet tunes, capable even of finishing a slow song, if the singer is a nice lady. He can match both Buddy Rich and Harry Belafonte in drum-offs on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, Questlove on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; in 2011, and Dave Grohl on &quot;The Muppets&quot; in 2015.

Animal shows a talent for jazz in a television advert for the Renault Clio car with French footballer Thierry Henry.

Animal has sometimes run afoul of &quot;Muppet Show&quot; guests. In 1981, the aforementioned scene with Buddy Rich ends with the seasoned pro learning Animal&#x27;s gonzo style, and performing it with twice the speed and proficiency. Animal throws a drum onto the irascible entertainer&#x27;s head, who later quipped &quot;I&#x27;m just glad it wasn&#x27;t a piano contest.&quot; When he repeatedly interrupted Rita Moreno&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Fever&quot; with loud drumming outbursts, she became annoyed and slammed his head between a pair of cymbals (to which Animal responded by saying &quot;Uh, that&#x27;s my kinda woman!&quot;, before passing out). In another episode, he chased Mark Hamill and Angus McGonagle the Argyle Gargoyle offstage at Kermit&#x27;s request after they snuck onstage. In another episode, Animal became hostile toward Dudley Moore when Moore tried to replace the band with a programmable, music-playing robot. On another occasion, however, Animal is starstruck by James Coburn after the movie tough-guy demonstrates his own violent streak in a parodic manner:

A common gag involves someone imparting a figure of speech to Animal: Animal turns to the audience, his eyes go wide and he goes berserk, taking the figure of speech literally. For example, Jim Nabors once spoke the traditional theatrical good luck wish &quot;Break a leg&quot;, whereupon Animal indulged him by trying to break Nabors&#x27;s leg. Another gag would occasionally occur when the band plays a slow song: Animal will get about halfway through and then after announcing &quot;Too slow!&quot; launch into a faster-paced version of the song. The band would usually comment that Animal lasted much longer than they thought he would.

Animal is a literal skirt-chaser. In &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; (1984), he chases a female student out of the auditorium, chanting &quot;Woo-maaaan!&quot; after her. He also chases cars. While some Animal gags involve a role reversal, or a moment of intellectualism, others are still more subtle, such as in this piece of dialog from &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; (1981), where it is revealed that Animal has a passion for the impressionist paintings of Pierre-Auguste Renoir:

In the film &quot;Muppets from Space&quot; (1999), Animal meets his match in the form of a security guard played by Kathy Griffin—after chasing her down a hallway with his &quot;Woo-man&quot; call, he later comes running back around the corner, yelling &quot;HELP HELP!&quot; with Griffin calling after him about how they&#x27;ll settle down, buy a house, and have children.

Ty Pennington commented about the possibility of Animal having ADHD when the character appeared on an episode of &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;.

Animal&#x27;s lack of social grace is on display at the very end of &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;. After the credits, his face fills the screen as he admonishes the audience: &quot;Go home! Go home!&quot;

== Performers ==
Animal was performed by Frank Oz from his first appearance in the pilot for &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; until his 2000 appearance in the video game &quot;Muppet RaceMania&quot;. He has been performed regularly by Eric Jacobson since his 2002 appearance in &quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot;.

On &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, Animal&#x27;s drumming was performed by Ronnie Verrell up until his death in 2002.

Animal has had roles in all Muppet movies, and was the only member of The Electric Mayhem to be included regularly on the &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; cartoons.

Animal was voiced by Howie Mandel in the first two seasons of &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;, followed by Dave Coulier in subsequent seasons. Animal was performed by Rob Mills in the series finale of &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot;, and he was occasionally performed by Kevin Clash on &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; in the absence of Frank Oz. John Kennedy also briefly performed Animal in a 2002 commercial for MasterCard, as well as for the 2003 video game &quot;Muppets Party Cruise&quot;. Drew Massey performed Animal in &quot;Statler and Waldorf: From the Balcony&quot;. In &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Little Muppet Monsters&quot;, Animal was voiced by Hal Rayle (who also voiced Gonzo and Miss Piggy).

==Appearances in other media==

In 1993, Animal performed The Surfaris&#x27; song &quot;Wipe Out&quot; on the &quot;Muppet Beach Party&quot; album. Animal&#x27;s track was also released as a single in the UK where it reached number 38 in the charts.

Animal was the official mascot of the U.S. Ski Team during the 1998 Winter Olympics. He was also featured in one of eleven commemorative stamps issued by the U.S. Postal Service.

In 2010, Animal was featured in a viral video alongside power-pop band OK Go, where he challenged the band&#x27;s drummer, Dan Konopka, to a staring contest. Animal ultimately wins and forces Konopka to be his roadie for a year.

Animal and his fellow Muppets made a guest appearance on the Halloween 2011 episode of the wrestling TV show &quot;WWE Raw&quot;, where he was a guest timekeeper. Animal is present in the 2011 film &quot;The Muppets&quot;, having gone into anger management therapy since the Muppets disbanded. He also made a special appearance on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; as a guest drummer with The Roots house band, and on the eighth UK series of &quot;The X Factor&quot; in 2011, where he drummed for Olly Murs on his song &quot;Dance with Me Tonight&quot;.

In 2022, Animal was featured in the Game Awards prior to the &quot;Best Sound/Music&quot; award. His skit prominently centers around his jokes towards video games, such as &quot;Elden Ring&quot;&#x27;s infamous Malenia boss battle, &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, and &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, and haste towards the next award&#x27;s winner, on which he also participates with.

On July 28, 2023, Animal made a surprise appearance with My Morning Jacket to close out their headlining set at the Newport Folk Festival.

<text>The Mattapan Line (alternatively the Mattapan Trolley and historically the Ashmont–Mattapan High-Speed Line) is a partially grade-separated light rail line which forms part of the MBTA&#x27;s Red Line rapid transit line. The line, which runs through Boston and Milton, Massachusetts, opened on August 26, 1929, as a conversion of a former commuter rail line. It exclusively uses PCC streetcars built in the 1940s. Passengers must transfer at Ashmont to access the rest of the Red Line, which uses heavy rail metro rolling stock.

The trolley&#x27;s route is used only by streetcars and has just two public grade crossings. All stations have low platforms, but all except Valley Road have been retrofitted with wheelchair lifts or wooden ramps for accessibility. Unlike most heritage streetcar lines, it is an integral part of the modern MBTA transit system rather than a tourist attraction. A rebuild of the line for modern light rail vehicles is planned.

==History==
===Commuter rail lines===

The Dorchester and Milton Branch Railroad opened in December 1847 from Neponset on the Old Colony Railroad main line to Mattapan station in Dorchester via Milton Mills (later Milton Lower Mills, then simply Milton). The line was immediately leased by the Old Colony as its Milton branch. The Old Colony built the Shawmut Branch Railroad from Harrison Square on the main line to Milton Lower Mills via Peabody Square in 1872. Most Mattapan passenger service switched to use the new branch east of Milton, as it ran through dense urban neighborhoods rather than swamps. The Old Colony Railroad and its branches were acquired by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1893.

When the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) was first constructing its rapid transit Cambridge–Dorchester line in the early 1910s, plans called for the line to be extended south from Andrew to Codman Square via Edward Everett Square, Columbia Square, and Mount Bowdoin. The route would have paralleled the New Haven&#x27;s Shawmut branch and Midland Division. By the end of that decade, however, passenger traffic on both New Haven-owned lines had been decimated by the BERy&#x27;s network of electrified streetcar lines, which connected to rapid transit trains at , , , and . Around 1920, BERy reached an agreement with the New Haven and the Boston Transit Commission to pursue the Dorchester Circuit Plan. Under that plan, a bidirectional rapid transit loop would run south from Andrew along the Old Colony main line, take over the Shawmut Branch and Milton branch to Mattapan, cut over to the Midland Division on a tunnel, and return to Andrew via the Midland Division right-of-way and another tunnel segment.

===Rapid transit conversion===

Although the Midland Branch served more populated areas, real estate deals along the Shawmut branch stood to benefit key state politicians. Construction of a rapid transit extension to Mattapan via the Shawmut branch was approved on March 23, 1923.

Steam trains were discontinued in 1927 and the line was closed for two years while it was modified for streetcars. There was a debate at that time whether or not to continue subway trains from Boston to Ashmont onwards to Mattapan, but the cost of full-scale subway service was apparently too high for the Boston Elevated Railway which then operated it. The line opened from Ashmont to Milton on August 26, 1929, and from Milton to Mattapan on December 21, 1929. Infill stations were opened at Capen Street in September 1930 and Butler on October 7, 1931. 

In 1966, the Red Line designation was also applied to the line, which had been known as 28 Mattapan–Ashmont. On March 18, 1968, the Neponset River flooded the line at . Restoration work began at 6:00 am on March 21 as the waters receded; service was resumed by 4:30 pm. In January 1981, the MBTA proposed to close the Mattapan Line at all times beginning that March due to severe budget issues. The closure was cancelled, though the Mattapan line and the Ashmont branch were closed from June 20, 1981, to January 16, 1982, for track replacement and tunnel repairs.

The line&#x27;s longest shutdown took place from June 24, 2006, to December 22, 2007, with shuttle buses replacing streetcar service. A new elevated loop was built at Ashmont – part of a major reconstruction of the station – and the aging canopy at Mattapan was replaced. The intermediate stations were also rebuilt; all stations except Valley Road were made accessible. Buses again replaced service on the line from October 14–29, 2023, to allow for track work.

The MBTA launched the Mattapan Line Transformation project in 2019, though it was largely inactive until 2022. The project aims to replace the PCC trolleys with light rail vehicles as the Green Line fleet turns over, restore the line&#x27;s ability to operate during snowstorms, rebuild all eight stations, replace track and signals, and repair bridges. Rehabilitation of the existing fleet is happening at the same time, to extend trolley life a few more years until LRVs arrive. By 2023, work was underway on 15% design. The 2007-built loop at Ashmont station will be removed as part of the project.

==Route==

The line begins and ends within the city of Boston, but most of the southern half of its route is in the northern part of the neighboring town of Milton. It follows the right-of-way of two former Old Colony Railroad branches which had commuter rail service until the 1920s. Much of the route parallels the Neponset River, crossing it twice. The right-of-way is owned by the MBTA and has only two at-grade crossings on its route. Between Cedar Grove and Butler stations, the line runs through the center of the Cedar Grove Cemetery.

, the line operates on 6 minute headways at weekday peak hours and 12–13 minute headways at other times.

==Accidents==

On March 20, 1979, three trolleys collided between Central Avenue and Valley Road stations. The first two trolleys had stopped to avoid a police car, which had become stuck on the tracks while the officer was investigating teenagers drinking near the line. A third trolley was unable to stop in time while approaching around a blind curve; it slammed into the first two trolleys, causing injuries, but no deaths.

Using funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the MBTA conducted a pilot test of technology similar to a collision avoidance system in an automobile, using radar and increasingly fast beeping to warn train operators of obstacles ahead. Like positive train control, it would stop the train if the driver did not take action to avoid an impending collision. If successful, the system would be considered for deployment on the Green Line, where multiple collisions had occurred in recent years.

On November 26, 2014, an out-of-service streetcar collided with an in-service streetcar near Cedar Grove. Seven people were injured.

On December 29, 2017, a collision between two in-service streetcars caused 17 injuries. The accident, caused by operator error, reduced the line to five operable streetcars.
==Rolling stock==

The rolling stock consists of rebuilt PCC streetcars, which were formerly part of a fleet shared with the Green Line. The historic rolling stock is retained largely because the line, built for 1920s streetcars, would have to be substantially rebuilt to accommodate the heavier modern cars used on the Green Line. In order to clear the line of snow, the MBTA maintains a jet engine-powered snowblower, officially the Portec RMC Hurricane Jet Snow Blower, model RP-3, dubbed &quot;Snowzilla&quot;. Snowzilla weighs , measures 8 by 12 by 27 feet, and is powered by a Westinghouse J34 turbojet engine. It uses approximately of jet fuel per line clearing run. Other T lines simply run regular trains to clear the tracks of snow, but the PCC cars&#x27; traction motors would short out if they were used for that purpose.

The current set of PCC cars are &quot;Wartime&quot; PCCs, built by Pullman-Standard in 1945–46. They have been in continuous revenue service in Boston since their construction, although PCC cars were not assigned to the Mattapan Line until 1955. The current fleet was rebuilt as part of a systemwide PCC rebuild program in 1978–83, and again in 1999–2005. During the latter rebuild, the cars were repainted from their former Green Line paint scheme to a brighter orange and cream design, similar to their original coloring. The cars also carry a unique geographic MBTA logo, reminiscent of the old Metropolitan Transit Authority map logo found on the cars between 1948 and 1955. Air-conditioning was added to the PCC cars in 2008.
On several occasions, the MBTA has proposed to replace the PCC streetcars either with newer trolleys or with buses, and has met with substantial community opposition on each occasion. The FY2017-FY2021 Capital Investment Plan, approved by the MassDOT board in June 2016, allocated $9 million to the line including $3.7 million for maintaining the PCC cars. The plan also allocated $5 million for &quot;PCC Car Replacement-Alternative Service&quot; which was to be used for future funding should an alternate form of transportation be decided upon. In 2017, MBTA began a $7.9 million project to overhaul the trolleys and update the propulsion systems, but further problems such as fluctuations in power damaged the four operating trains in early 2018. On February 5, 2018, it was reported that eight more trolleys were going to re-enter service in 2019, the fixes will prolong the lifespan of the trains by another 7 to 8 years. After several delays, the first rebuilt trolley entered service in March 2022.

The MBTA also announced in 2018 that it was studying alternatives again to running trolleys. Alternatives that were being considered were further repairs of the existing PCC cars, procurement of new replicas of historic cars, and turning the line into a busway. Local politicians and citizens who live along the line have voiced their concerns over the potential conversion of the line into a busway and prefer that the route be maintained as using rail technology. In January 2019, eventual conversion for use of new light rail vehicles (or Type 9 LRVs transferred from the Green Line) was reported to be the most viable option. , the MBTA plans to have Type 9 LRVs replace the PCC streetcars.

===Fleet===
The Mattapan Line fleet of PCC streetcars consist of ten units, of which 6 are in service. Of the six in service, 3 have been rebuilt.

<text>The flags of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Socialist Republic]]s were all defaced versions of the flag of the Soviet Union, which featured a golden hammer and sickle and a gold-bordered red star (the only exception being the Georgian SSR, which used a red hammer and sickle and a fully red star) on a red field.

== History ==
When Byelorussia and Ukraine were the founding members of the United Nations in 1945, all of their flags were red with only small markings in upper left corners and needed distinct flags for each other.

In February 1947, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR issued a resolution calling for the Soviet republics to adopt new flags, which each of its republics were recommended to develop and adopt new national flags. So they expressed the idea of a union state, asked to use the symbols of the State flag of the Soviet Union, such as the gold hammer and sickle and the red star, as well as maintain the predominance of red color on the flag of the Union republics. National, historical and cultural features of each republic was instructed to express the other colors and the order of their location, as well as the location based on the national emblem or coat of arms. After competitions for the best projects from 1949 to 1954 the new flags of the 16 republics were developed and adopted. The authorities in Ukraine and Byelorussia were the first to adopt the flags on 5 July 1950, and 25 December 1951, respectively. All others followed suit between 1952 and 1953 with the last republic, the Russian SFSR, adopted the flag on 9 January 1954.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991, only Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan (without hammer and sickle), Turkmenistan and Ukraine retained their Soviet republic flags as independent states until the new official flags were adopted in 1992. Since 1995 (current version adopted in 2012) Belarus retains its old Soviet flag with only minor changes.

Their final versions prior to re-adoption of the non-Soviet national flags were as follows:
==Flags of other republics==
Other Union Republics and autonomous republics existed within the Soviet Union, mostly using flags on a similar pattern, or the flag of their &quot;parent&quot; Union Republic, further defaced. Today, the only former Soviet Union territories that use modified versions of their original Soviet flag are the republic of Transnistria (a state of limited recognition, formerly part of the Moldavian SSR) and Belarus (since 1995).

The official flags of the ASSRs were seldom used, and were generally the flag of the republic to which the ASSR belonged, defaced with the ASSR name in its own language(s) and the official language of the SSR; flags matching this pattern are not displayed in the gallery below:

<doc id="742084" wikidata="Q441783" url="?curid=742084" title="Eben Sumner Draper">
<text>Eben (sometimes incorrectly Ebenezer) Sumner Draper (June 17, 1858 – April 9, 1914) was an American businessman and politician from Massachusetts. He was for many years a leading figure in what later became the Draper Corporation, the dominant manufacturer of cotton textile process machinery in the world during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He served as the 44th governor of Massachusetts from 1909 to 1911.

==Early life and career==
Eben Sumner Draper was born in Hopedale, Massachusetts on June 17, 1858, the third and youngest son of George and Hannah B. (Thwing) Draper. His brothers were William F. Draper, who would become a general and a U.S. representative, and George A. Draper, with whom he would control the family business. He was educated in the public schools of Hopedale, in Allen&#x27;s School at West Newton, and in the class of 1880 of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The Drapers were one of the leading families of Hopedale, a community that had been established as an experiment in Christian communal living. At the center of the community were a collection of factories principally engaged in the production of textile manufacturing equipment. Eben&#x27;s father, a major shareholder of the community, capitalized on financial difficulties in the businesses and the informal means by which they were organized to gain complete control of them in the 1850s. He then took advantage of patents developed by his brother Ebenezer and protectionist tariffs to build a dominant monopoly position in the production of cotton textile processing machinery, and expanded his business interests to include a variety of other industrial manufacturing in Hopedale. All three of his sons were eventually drafted into the business. By the time Eben Draper graduated, his father controlled the largest plant for manufacturing cotton machinery in the world. Draper spent three years in apprenticeship in various cotton mills learning all he could about cotton manufacturing before being made a partner in his father&#x27;s firm.

When the Hopedale companies organized into one, Draper was given charge of the selling department. Following the elder Draper&#x27;s death in 1887 control (and majority ownership) of the business passed to William. He incorporated the Draper Company (later the Draper Corporation), which introduced the innovative Northrop Loom to great success.

William Draper, however, was a largely absentee owner, serving first in the United States Congress and then as United States Ambassador to Italy. The family business was reorganized (historian William Tucker describes it as a &quot;coup&quot; by Eben and his brother George) in the 1890s, at which time Eben Draper became its president.

Hopedale as at the time seen as a model company town. The Drapers owned most of the housing in the town, but did not charge excessive rents to the factory workers, and offered services such as medical care to their employees. The company was, however, a nonunion shop that did not pay very high wages, and the Drapers also moved some of their production to lower-wage areas of the southern United States during his administration of the business.

==Entry into politics==
Draper served as a private in the Massachusetts First Corps of Cadets before and during the 1898 Spanish–American War, serving as president of the Massachusetts Volunteer Association.

Draper was a leading figure of the &quot;Young Republican Club&quot; (later just the &quot;Republican Club&quot;), whose members dominated the state Republican Party establishment in the early 20th century. Like his father and brothers, he was also a strong supporter of protectionist tariffs. He assisted his father in founding the Home Market Club of Boston, a protectionist organization in New England. He served as chairman of the Congressional campaign committee which waged a successful campaign to send his brother William as a protectionist to the US House of Representatives. He was then elected as chairman of the Republican State Committee, serving on several victorious campaigns. In 1896 he was elected chairman of the Massachusetts Republican delegation to the St. Louis Convention, which nominated William McKinley for president. During the convention, he was instrumental in assisting Henry Cabot Lodge to secure a plank in the party platform favoring the gold standard. He also served in the presidential election of 1900 as a Presidential elector, again supporting McKinley.

==Governorship==
In 1905, Draper was nominated and elected as Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, considered by the party to be a stepping stone in an &quot;escalator&quot; of statewide offices culminating in the governorship. Draper served for three terms under Governor Curtis Guild Jr., acting as governor for a significant part of 1908, when Guild was ill with pneumonia and appendicitis. Draper and Guild were emblematic of growing divisions in the party: Guild was progressive and reform-oriented, supporting tariff reform, while Draper was conservative, pro-business, and anti-reform. While acting as governor, Draper rejected a pro-labor nominee chosen by Guild for the state&#x27;s bureau of labor statistics.

In 1908, Draper was elected Governor, standing against Democrat James H. Vahey. Vahey attacked the Republican ticket, which included another pro-business conservative in Louis A. Frothingham, as demonstrative of the influence of money in politics. The Democrats were otherwise poorly organized, with Vahey, an Irish American from Watertown failing to get support from old-line Democrats and the Boston political machine, and Draper won a comfortable (60,000-vote) victory in a fairly listless campaign.

Draper&#x27;s two terms as governor deepened the divisions in the Republican party. He vetoed pro-labor bills, including one that would have closed a contractor loophole allowing extended work hours, and the party-controlled legislature refused to enact a bill lowering the maximum weekly work time from 56 to 54 hours. These positions led to a loss of support in the state&#x27;s urban centers, but did not prevent him from winning reelection over Vahey in 1909, albeit by a reduced margin. Draper also signed a bill legalizing the &quot;de facto&quot; merger of the Boston and Maine Railroad with the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, signaling approval of what were seen then as monopolistic business practices.

In 1910, Governor Draper drove with President William Howard Taft, in the state on an official visit, to pay respects to Taft&#x27;s ancestral family homes in Mendon and Uxbridge, just west of Hopedale.

==Later years==
The 1910 election saw the party divisions lead to a fracture. Eugene Noble Foss, a Boston businessman, bolted the Republican Party, and ran for election as a Democrat, effectively self-financing his campaign. He ran as an essentially single-issue candidate, seeking tariff reform, in particular reciprocity in trade with Canada. Draper, running for a third term, upset local dairy farmers by allowing the railroads to raise rates on milk shipments. This led to protests and a brief embargo of deliveries to the Boston area, which Draper countered weakly by criticising railroad management for its pricing tactics. Foss won the governor&#x27;s race by a 32,000-vote margin, but his win was not reflected in Democratic gains anywhere else.

Draper continued to serve as the managing head of the family business. He was considered a candidate for the United States Senate seat of fellow Republican Murray Crane in 1913. The party, then under the control of its hardline conservative faction (and in control of the legislature, which then elected senators), chose John W. Weeks. His company became the focus of labor organization by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, or &quot;Wobblies&quot;), who engineered a strike in 1912. Although they nominally sought higher wages and a shorter work week, there was a political dimension to the strike: the IWW specifically targeted Draper because of his protectionist and anti-labor actions taken while governor. Both Nicola Sacco, a former employee of The Draper Company, and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were very active in this strike and several others that affected The Draper Company.

==Personal life and death==
Draper married Nannie Bristow, the daughter of United States Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin Bristow, in 1883. The couple had three children:
*Benjamin Helm Bristow Draper
*Eben Sumner Draper Jr.
*Dorothy Draper

Draper was active in the Unitarian church. His wife died in 1913. Draper died on April 9, 1914, in Greenville, South Carolina, following what was described in his obituary as &quot;a shock of paralysis&quot; suffered as he was making &quot;a visit to the far South in search of health.&quot; His funeral in Boston was attended by then Governor David I. Walsh, among others. Burial was in the family mausoleum in the Hopedale Village Cemetery.
