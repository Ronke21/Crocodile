<text>Charles Ferdinand d&#x27;Artois, Duke of Berry (24 January 1778 – 14 February 1820), was the third child and younger son of Charles, Count of Artois (later King Charles X of France), and Maria Theresa of Savoy. In 1820 he was assassinated at the Paris Opera by Louis Pierre Louvel, a Bonapartist. In June 1832, two years after the overthrow of Charles X, an unsuccessful royalist insurrection in the Vendée was led by Charles Ferdinand&#x27;s widow, Marie-Caroline, in an attempt to restore their son Henri, Comte de Chambord, to the French throne.

==Biography==


Charles Ferdinand d&#x27;Artois, Duke of Berry, was born at Versailles. As a son of a &quot;fils de France&quot; not being heir apparent, he was himself only a &quot;petit-fils de France&quot;, and thus bore his father&#x27;s appanage title as surname in emigration. However, during the Restoration, as his father was heir presumptive to the crown, he was allowed the higher rank of a &quot;fils de France&quot; (used in his marriage contract, his death certificate, etc.). His maternal grandparents were Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia and Maria Antonietta of Spain. She was the youngest daughter of Philip V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnese. Since he was already dead when his father became king, he and his surviving daughter always had &quot;Artois&quot; as surname.

At the start of the French Revolution he left France with his father, then Count of Artois, and served in the counter-revolutionary Army of Condé of his cousin, Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé, from 1792 to 1797. As a member of Conde&#x27;s emigre army, he fought in the Rhine Campaign of 1796, and achieved particular distinction at the Battle of Emmendingen and the Battle of Schliengen. 
He afterwards joined the Russian army, and in 1801 took up his residence in England, where he remained for thirteen years. During that time he had a relationship with an Englishwoman, Amy Brown Freeman. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition (1911) described her as his wife, but that is highly unlikely.

In 1814, the duke set out for France. His frank, open manners gained him some favour with his countrymen, and Louis XVIII named him commander-in-chief of the army at Paris on the return of Napoleon from Elba. He was, however, unable to retain the loyalty of his troops, and retired to Ghent during the Hundred Days war. On 17 June 1816, following negotiations by the French ambassador, the Duke of Blacas, he married Princess Maria-Carolina of Naples (1798–1870), oldest daughter of then hereditary Prince Francis of Naples.
Three children were born before the duke&#x27;s death, with one surviving infancy. His daughter, Louise d&#x27;Artois, born in 1819, married Charles III of Parma.

On 13 February 1820, the Duke of Berry was stabbed and mortally wounded when leaving the opera house in Paris with his wife, and died the next day. The assassin was a saddle maker named Louis Pierre Louvel, a Bonapartist opposed to the monarchy. Seven months after his death, the Duke&#x27;s wife gave birth to their fourth child, Henri, who received the title of Duke of Bordeaux, but is better known in history as the Count of Chambord, and who in the view of Legitimists, was (from 1844 to 1883) King of France, as Henry V. His grandson Athanase-Charles-Marie Charette de la Contrie would later become a prominent military commander for France and other nations.

==Issue==
With his wife, Maria Carolina of Bourbon-Sicily, the Duke of Berry had four children, of whom only two survived for more than a day:
#Louise Élisabeth d&#x27;Artois (13 July 1817 – 14 July 1817).
#Louis d&#x27;Artois (born and died 13 September 1818).
#Louise Marie Thérèse d&#x27;Artois (21 September 1819 – 1 February 1864); married Charles III, Duke of Parma. 
#Henri d&#x27;Artois, Duke of Bordeaux and Count of Chambord (29 September 1820 – 24 August 1883); married Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este.

In addition, the Duke had several illegitimate offspring:

*With Mary Bullhorn, a Scottish actress:
#Marie de la Boulaye (1807 – ?), married Henri-Louis Bérard. No issue.
*With Amy Brown Freeman (whose daughters are the only illegitimate issue whom Berry recognized, on his deathbed):
#Charlotte Marie Augustine de Bourbon, &quot;comtesse d&#x27;Issoudun&quot; (13 July 1808 – 13 July 1886), married in 1823 to Ferdinand de Faucigny-Lucinge, Prince de Lucinge.
#Louise Marie Charlotte de Bourbon, &quot;comtesse de Vierzon&quot; (29 December 1809 – 26 December 1891), married in 1827 to Charles-Athanase de Charette, Baron de la Contrie. Her son Athanase-Charles-Marie Charette de la Contrie was a military commander and became a general for France and other nations. He married Antoinette Van Leer Polk, a great-niece of James Knox Polk, the 11th President of the United States.

*With Eugénie Virginie Oreille (1795 – 1875):
#Charles Louis Auguste Oreille de Carrière (4 March 1815 – 30 August 1858), married in 1846 to Elisabeth Jugan, with whom he had a son Charles, a lyric artist, married but without surviving issue.
#Ferdinand Oreille de Carrière (10 October 1820 – 27 December 1876), married in 1860 to Louise Eugénie Ancelle, with whom he had a daughter, Léonie, who married and left several children.

*With Marie Sophie de La Roche (1795 – 1883):
#Ferdinand de La Roche (24 August 1817 – 24 December 1908), married in 1849 to Claudine Gabrielle Claire de Bachet de Méziriac. No issue.
#Charles de La Roche (30 March 1820 – 12 January 1901), married in 1840 to Julie Dolé, with whom he had four children.

*With Louise Melanie Thiryfoq (? – 1887):
#Louise Charlotte Antoinette Aglaé Thiryfoq (15 October 1819 – 25 May 1843), married in 1839 to Gaston du Charron, Comte du Portail.

*With Lucie Cosnefroy de Saint-Ange (1797 – 1870):
#Alix Mélanie Cosnefroy de Saint-Ange (16 September 1820 – 11 June 1892).

Four of his children – the Count of Chambord, Ferdinand Oreille de Carrière, Charles de La Roche and Mélanie Cosnefroy de Saint-Ange – were born after his death.

<text>For fluid power, a working fluid is a gas or liquid that primarily transfers force, motion, or mechanical energy. In hydraulics, water or hydraulic fluid transfers force between hydraulic components such as hydraulic pumps, hydraulic cylinders, and hydraulic motors that are assembled into hydraulic machinery, hydraulic drive systems, etc. In pneumatics, the working fluid is air or another gas which transfers force between pneumatic components such as compressors, vacuum pumps, pneumatic cylinders, and pneumatic motors. In pneumatic systems, the working gas also stores energy because it is compressible. (Gases also heat up as they are compressed and cool as they expand. Some gases also condense into liquids as they are compressed and boil as pressure is reduced.)

For passive heat transfer, a working fluid is a gas or liquid, usually called a coolant or heat transfer fluid, that primarily transfers heat into or out of a region of interest by conduction, convection, and/or forced convection (pumped liquid cooling, air cooling, etc.).

The working fluid of a heat engine or heat pump is a gas or liquid, usually called a refrigerant, coolant, or working gas, that primarily converts thermal energy (temperature change) into mechanical energy (or vice versa) by phase change and/or heat of compression and expansion. Examples using phase change include water↔steam in steam engines, and refrigerants in vapor-compression refrigeration and air conditioning systems. Examples without phase change include air or hydrogen in hot air engines such as the Stirling engine, air or gases in gas-cycle heat pumps, etc. (Some heat pumps and heat engines use &quot;working solids&quot;, such as rubber bands, for elastocaloric refrigeration or thermoelastic cooling and nickel titanium in a prototype heat engine.)

Working fluids other than air or water are necessarily recirculated in a loop. Some hydraulic and passive heat-transfer systems are open to the water supply and/or atmosphere, sometimes through breather filters. Heat engines, heat pumps, and systems using volatile liquids or special gases are usually sealed behind relief valves.

==Properties and states==

The working fluid&#x27;s properties are essential for the full description of thermodynamic systems. Although working fluids have many physical properties which can be defined, the thermodynamic properties which are often required in engineering design and analysis are few. Pressure, temperature, enthalpy, entropy, specific volume, and internal energy are the most common.

If at least two thermodynamic properties are known, the state of the working fluid can be defined. This is usually done on a property diagram which is simply a plot of one property versus another.

When the working fluid passes through engineering components such as turbines and compressors, the point on a property diagram moves due to the possible changes of certain properties. In theory therefore it is possible to draw a line/curve which fully describes the thermodynamic properties of the fluid. In reality however this can only be done if the process is reversible. If not, the changes in property are represented as a dotted line on a property diagram. This issue does not really affect thermodynamic analysis since in most cases it is the end states of a process which are sought after.
==Work==
The working fluid can be used to output useful work if used in a turbine. Also, in thermodynamic cycles energy may be input to the working fluid by means of a compressor. The mathematical formulation for this may be quite simple if we consider a cylinder in which a working fluid resides. A piston is used to input useful work to the fluid. From mechanics, the work done from state 1 to state 2 of the process is given by:
:formula_1

where &quot;ds&quot; is the incremental distance from one state to the next and &quot;F&quot; is the force applied. The negative sign is introduced since in this case a decrease in volume is being considered. The situation is shown in the following figure:

The force is given by the product of the pressure in the cylinder and its cross sectional area such that
:formula_2

Where &quot;A⋅ds = dV&quot; is the elemental change of cylinder volume. If from state 1 to 2 the volume increases then the working fluid actually does work on its surroundings and this is commonly denoted by a negative work. If the volume decreases the work is positive. By the definition given with the above integral the work done is represented by the area under a pressure–volume diagram. If we consider the case where we have a constant pressure process then the work is simply given by
:formula_3

==Selection==

Depending on the application, various types of working fluids are used. In a thermodynamic cycle it may be the case that the working fluid changes state from gas to liquid or vice versa. Certain gases such as helium can be treated as ideal gases. This is not generally the case for superheated steam and the ideal gas equation does not really hold. At much higher temperatures however it still yields relatively accurate results. The physical and chemical properties of the working fluid are extremely important when designing thermodynamic systems. For instance, in a refrigeration unit, the working fluid is called the refrigerant. Ammonia is a typical refrigerant and may be used as the primary working fluid. Compared with water (which can also be used as a refrigerant), ammonia makes use of relatively high pressures requiring more robust and expensive equipment.

In air standard cycles as in gas turbine cycles, the working fluid is air. In the open cycle gas turbine, air enters a compressor where its pressure is increased. The compressor therefore inputs work to the working fluid (positive work). The fluid is then transferred to a combustion chamber where this time heat energy is input by means of the burning of a fuel. The air then expands in a turbine thus doing work against the surroundings (negative work).

Different working fluids have different properties and in choosing one in particular the designer must identify the major requirements. In refrigeration units, high latent heats are required to provide large refrigeration capacities.

<text>Hugh Alan &quot;Buddy&quot; MacMaster (October 18, 1924 – August 20, 2014) was a Canadian fiddler. He performed and recorded both locally and internationally, and was regarded as an expert on the tradition and lore of Cape Breton fiddle music.

==Early life==
MacMaster was born in 1924 into a Gaelic-speaking home in Timmins, Ontario to John Duncan MacMaster and Sarah Agnes MacDonald MacMaster. The family was originally from Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, and in 1928 they returned to Cape Breton to settle in the town of Judique. MacMaster&#x27;s father played the fiddle, but his mother sang to him from birth, lilting with a Gaelic inflection peculiar to the area. At an early age, MacMaster began to play the fiddle. At age 12, he had his first public performance at an amateur hour in Port Hood, Nova Scotia, and at age 14 he played his first professional gig at a square dance in the nearby town of Troy.

==Career==
MacMaster continued to play nights at square dances across Nova Scotia, while taking on a career as a station agent and telegrapher for the Canadian National Railway to support himself and his family. In 1943, he made his first radio broadcast from the town of Antigonish, Nova Scotia in 1948. In the 1970s, he played regularly on CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Ceilidh&quot; show. After his retirement from the railroad in 1988, he went on to play full-time as a professional musician, often accompanied by piano. He continued to play music of mainly Scottish origin, supplemented with traditional Cape Breton and Nova Scotia tunes, and gained an international reputation, touring in Europe and the United States. He was one of the first Cape Breton fiddlers to be asked to teach in Scotland.

In 2005 he recorded an album with his niece, fiddler Natalie MacMaster.

==Awards==
MacMaster was awarded an honorary doctorate from St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish in 1995, and in 2000 he was awarded the Order of Canada for his contributions to Canadian culture. &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; states that the citation for the Order of Canada read &quot;as ambassador of Canadian music and a mentor to many, he is leading a Gaelic renaissance in Canada and abroad.&quot; He has appeared through Nova Scotia, Canada, the US and the UK for dances, in concert and in festivals such as the Atlantic Fiddlers&#x27; Festival, Cape Breton Fiddlers&#x27; Festival, Celtic Colours International Festival, Nova Scotia Highland Village Day, Cape Breton Fiddlers&#x27; Festival, the Nova Scotia International Tattoo, and the Celtic Sundance Festival, Utah. He also received the Order of Nova Scotia in 2003 for outstanding achievement benefiting the province and its residents. In October 2006, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Cape Breton University in a special ceremony held in Judique.
In 2023, he was inducted into the Canadian Fiddle Hall of Honour at the 2023 Canadian Grand Masters event in Truro, Nova Scotia.

==Personal life==
MacMaster married Marie Beaton in 1968. They have two children, Mary Elizabeth MacMaster MacInnis (also a musician) and Allan Gerard MacMaster. MacMaster&#x27;s youngest sister, Betty Lou Beaton, is one of Cape Breton&#x27;s finest pianists and is married to well-known fiddler and composer Kinnon Beaton. He is also the uncle of Natalie MacMaster, another Cape Breton fiddler who has toured extensively and gained an international following. His son, Allan, was elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in October 2009, representing the electoral district of Inverness as a Progressive Conservative.

==Death==
MacMaster died at his home in Judique, Nova Scotia on August 20, 2014. He was 89.

<text>A private pilot licence (PPL) or private pilot certificate is a type of pilot licence that allows the holder to act as pilot in command of an aircraft privately (not for remuneration). The basic licence requirements are determined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), but implementation varies from country to country. According to ICAO, an applicant must be at least 17 years old, demonstrate appropriate knowledge and skill, and hold at least a Class 3 medical certificate. Different PPLs are available for different categories of aircraft, such as aeroplane, helicopter, airship, etc., and are not interchangeable, although experience from a PPL in one category may be credited towards the issue of another.

== Issuing authorities ==
Private pilot licences are issued by the civil aviation authority of each country. Standards vary, and PPLs are not automatically recognised by other countries, but in some countries the holder of a foreign PPL may obtain permission to fly on a temporary basis.

In the United States the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) has the authority to issue a PPL or another pilot license.

In Europe, civil aviation authorities issue licences based on common EASA standards.

== Categories ==

The aircraft categories described by ICAO for the purposes of the PPL are aeroplane, airship, helicopter and powered lift. Many countries issue PPLs in additional categories such as sailplane (glider), balloon, powered parachute, and weight-shift control.

===Aeroplanes===

The aeroplane PPL is the most popular category of PPL. In the United States in 2022, of 164,000 people with PPLs, 158,000 were for aeroplanes only. In the United Kingdom in 2021, there were 22,500 holders of the PPL(A), and 2,200 holders of the PPL(H).

According to ICAO, the applicant for a PPL(A) must have at least 40 hours experience as a pilot of aeroplanes (35 hours on an integrated course), of that no more than 5 hours in a flight simulator. Credit may be given for flight time in other aircraft categories. The applicant must have at least 10 hours of solo flight time, including at least 5 hours of solo cross-country flight time with at least one cross-country flight of at least 270 km (150 NM) including two full-stop landings at different aerodromes.

In EASA states, the minimum experience for a PPL(A) is 45 hours. In practice, most students take about 50–70 hours to complete the course.

Applicants for the PPL(A) must be at least 17 years old. There is no minimum age to begin flight lessons, however, students must be 16 to fly solo. In the United States, a student pilot certificate is required to fly solo.

In addition to the licence, PPL(A) holders must gain class ratings or type ratings appropriate to the aircraft they wish to fly. Typically a PPL(A) holder would first be issued a &quot;single-engine piston land&quot; class rating, which permits him/her to fly aircraft with a single piston engine. To fly seaplanes or multi-engine aircraft requires further training, and more complex aircraft require a type-specific rating.

Other ratings include the instrument rating to fly in Instrument Meteorological Conditions, the night rating to fly at night, and various levels of instructor rating.

==== Additional endorsements ====
A number of endorsements are available for specific skills. Endorsements only require instruction and a flight instructor&#x27;s signature in the pilot&#x27;s logbook; they do not require any flight test or submission of documents to the national civil aviation authority.

Endorsements available in the United States include:
* Tailwheel (pilots who have logged pilot-in-command time on tailwheel aircraft prior to 15 April 1991 are exempt from this requirement) – Tailwheel endorsement not applicable in Canada
* Complex airplane (aircraft with a variable-pitch propeller, flaps, and retractable landing gear)
* High-performance (more than 200 horsepower per engine)
* Pressurized aircraft endorsement for aircraft that have a service ceiling or maximum operating altitude, whichever is lower, above 25,000 feet MSL (mean sea level). 
* Night vision goggle operations

Other aircraft operations for which the FAA does not require an endorsement that typically require additional training are glider towing and aerobatics. The FAA also does not require an endorsement for some commercial activities like banner towing. Aerial application (crop seeding, spraying and dusting), whether conducted by a commercial certificate holder operating for hire or by a private pilot treating a crop in which he is the owner of a substantial share, requires an Authorization under Part 137 of the Federal Aviation Regulations.

===Helicopters===

According to ICAO, the requirements for a PPL(H) are similar to the PPL(A). The qualifying cross-country flight must be at least 180 km (100 NM), and the applicant must have received at least 20 hours instruction in helicopters.

In the United States, the legal aircraft category is known as rotorcraft, which is subdivided into helicopters and gyroplanes.

===Airships===

According to ICAO, applicants for a PPL(As) must have at least 25 hours flight time as pilot of airships, including &quot;3 hours of cross-country flight training in an airship with a cross-country flight totalling not less than 45 km (25 NM); 5 take-offs and 5 landings to a full stop at an aerodrome with each landing involving a flight in the traffic pattern at an aerodrome; 3 hours of instrument time; and 5 hours as pilot assuming the duties of the pilot-in-command under the supervision of the pilot-in-command.&quot;

===Balloons===

In the United Kingdom, the balloon equivalent of the private pilot licence is known as the Balloon Pilot Licence (BPL). Classes are:

* Hot-air balloon class (divided into four groups)
* Gas balloon class
* Mixed balloon class
* Hot-air airship class

In the United States, the minimum age for a balloon private pilot certificate is 16.

In the United States, some limitations may be placed on the certificate, such as &quot;limited to hot air balloons with airborne heater&quot; or &quot;limited to gas balloons&quot;, unless the pilot has had appropriate flight training in the other type of balloon and received a logbook endorsement.

===Sailplanes===

For gliders (sailplanes), the licence is known as a Sailplane Pilot Licence (SPL), and has lower requirements than an aeroplane PPL.

In the United States and Europe, the minimum age for a sailplane private pilot certificate is 16.

<doc id="755284" wikidata="Q7142816" url="?curid=755284" title="Passive obedience">
<text>Passive obedience is a religious and political doctrine, which states that people have a moral duty to obey the law, in particular accepting punishment as part of this obedience.

==George Berkeley==

The most notable publication describing this doctrine was Bishop George Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;A Discourse on Passive Obedience&quot; (1712). The tract is considered Berkeley&#x27;s major contribution to moral and political philosophy.

In &quot;A Discourse on Passive Obedience&quot;, Berkeley defends the thesis that people have &quot;a moral duty to observe the negative precepts (prohibitions) of the law, including the duty not to resist the execution of punishment.&quot; However, Berkeley does make exceptions to this sweeping moral statement, stating that we need not observe precepts of &quot;usurpers or even madmen&quot; and that people can obey different supreme authorities if there are more than one claims to the highest authority (§52). On the other hand, Berkeley also insists that disobedience to a tyrant remains wrong, even when the tyrant&#x27;s violation of moral law is a worse violation than rebellion would be; when such immoral tyranny becomes insufferable, rebellion is predictable, and violates no rights of the tyrant, yet may still violate moral law (§44). In some places, Berkeley&#x27;s argument for blind obedience to a &quot;de facto&quot; authority resembles Thomas Hobbes&#x27;s argument in &quot;Leviathan&quot;, on the grounds that rebellion can lead to anarchic violence and chaos which is worse than the worst tyranny (§§16, 47, 51), although Berkeley disagrees with Hobbes&#x27;s idea that moral and political obligation ultimately rests on the law of self-preservation (§33).

==Other uses==

In Calvinism, salvation depends on Christ&#x27;s active obedience, obeying the laws and commands of God the Father, and passive obedience, enduring the punishment of the crucifixion suffering all the just penalties due to men for their sins. The two are seen as distinct but inseparable; passive obedience on its own only takes men back to the state of Adam before the Fall. Reformed theologian, Louis Berkhof helpfully wrote: &quot;His active obedience consists in all that He did to observe the law in behalf of sinners, as a condition for obtaining eternal life; and His passive obedience in all that He suffered in paying the penalty of sin and thus discharging the debt of all his people.&quot;(Manual of Christian Doctrine 215)

The Scottish theologian John Cameron&#x27;s support for passive obedience at the start of the 17th century meant that he was principal of the University of Glasgow for less than a year in 1622.

At a human level a similar contrast distinguished between actively obeying the &quot;de facto&quot; power and law even when it conflicted with God&#x27;s law or laws of nature, and passively obeying (not resisting) when it came to punishment for not actively obeying.

It was usually associated with the seventeenth-century Church of England and the Scottish Episcopal Church of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and was central to the ideology of the Tory Party and the Jacobites. It is most generally seen in reference to Tory opposition to the Glorious Revolution, which saw Parliamentary determination of the succession of the English crown against primogeniture and the wishes of James II.

Passive obedience appears twice in Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, first as a scene heading &quot;The Heroism of Passive Obedience&quot; when the bishop entertains Valjean, and later in the text on the impact of armies when describing French intervention in Spain in 1823.

During his coup d&#x27;état of 2 December 1851, the then French president Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte reminded officers and soldiers of their pledge and duty of passive obedience to his orders as chief of the government, since he individually was responsible to the French people and posterity.

<text>Louis François Armand de Vignerot du Plessis, 3rd [[Duke of Richelieu]] (; 13 March 1696 – 8 August 1788), was a French soldier, diplomat and statesman. He joined the army and participated in three major wars. He eventually rose to the rank of Marshal of France.

He was the son of Armand Jean de Vignerot du Plessis, duc de Richelieu, who in turn was a great-nephew of Cardinal Richelieu, the prominent French statesman who had dominated France in the early 17th century.

==Early years==

Louis François Armand de Vignerot du Plessis was born in Paris, and Louis XIV of France was his godfather. In his early days, he was thrice imprisoned in the Bastille: in 1711 at the instance of his stepfather, in 1716 in consequence of a duel, and in 1719 for his share in the Cellamare Conspiracy of Giulio Alberoni against Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, the regent for Louis XV of France.

Apart from his reputation as a man of exceptionally loose morals, he attained, in spite of a limited education, distinction as a diplomat and general. He was the French ambassador to the court of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles VI, in Vienna from 1725 to 1729.

==Military career==

In 1733–1734, he served in a Rhine campaign during the War of the Polish Succession. The following decade during the War of the Austrian Succession he fought with distinction at Dettingen and Fontenoy, where he directed the grapeshot upon the British columns, and three years afterwards he made a brilliant defence of Genoa.

===Seven Years War===
====Siege of Menorca====

In 1756 during the Siege of Menorca he expelled the British from Menorca by the capture of the stronghold of San Felipe. On his return to France he was hailed by Madame de Pompadour who told him &quot;your star has risen and it shall never be dimmed&quot;.

While waiting for suitable employment, the Duc took command of the French forces on the southern coast around Toulon. In 1757 following Frederick the Great&#x27;s sudden invasion of Bohemia, he was given command of a relief force that was to relieve the Siege of Prague. However this was cancelled when an Austrian army defeated Frederick at Kolin forcing him to break off the siege and withdraw from Bohemia.

====Invasion of Hanover====

The French ministers were deeply unhappy with d&#x27;Estrees the commander of the Army of Westphalia which had orders to invade Hanover but was moving extremely slowly. It was decided to replace him with Richelieu. Arriving shortly after the Battle of Hastenbeck with the Anglo-German Army of Observation retreating rapidly from him, the Duc lead his army in pursuit.

His army now occupied most of Hanover, capturing the capital in the autumn. His orders were to smash the Army of Observation and occupy all of Hanover, before turning east and launching an attack on the Prussian fortress of Magdeburg. Instead Richelieu, fearing that his army was not in a condition to face battle, concluded the Convention of Klosterzeven which allowed the enemy to escape destruction. He was heavily criticised for this in Paris, where the terms were considered far too lenient.

The Duc then led his army into winter quarters at Halberstadt postponing the attack on Magdeburg. Early in the new year he suddenly resigned his command, and retired to France - handing over to the Comte d&#x27;Clermont. He was widely accused of corruption during his six months as commander in Hanover. He and his officers were suspected of having stolen three-quarters of the money he was supposed to raise in taxes from the occupied territories, as well as stealing the pay of his soldiers.

His pillaging campaigns in Hanover procured him the sobriquet of the &quot;petit père de la maraude&quot;.

==Political career and intrigue==

His real public career began ten years after his service in the Rhine campaign. After the wars, he plunged again into court intrigue. Initially, he was the best friend of King Louis XV of France, whom he had known since the King was a child. The relationship later cooled a little, however, when he opposed Louis&#x27;s mistress, Madame de Pompadour.

After Pompadour&#x27;s death in 1764, his position in court was restored and he developed an amiable friendship with the King&#x27;s last mistress, Madame du Barry. However, he was again not welcome at court when Louis&#x27; grandson, Louis XVI, succeeded to the throne in 1774. This was because the new Queen, Marie Antoinette, disliked both Madame du Barry and Richelieu&#x27;s nephew, the overly ambitious Duke of Aiguillon.

==Private life==

The duke was such a renowned womanizer that it is said Choderlos de Laclos based the character Valmont in &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot; on him.

He was married three times. At the age of fourteen, against his will, he was forced to marry Anne Catherine de Noailles. In 1734, as a result of the intrigues of Voltaire, he married Élisabeth Sophie of Lorraine, the daughter of Anne Marie Joseph, Count of Harcourt. She became the mother of his heir, Louis Antoine Sophie de Vignerot du Plessis. When he was eighty-four years old, he married as his third wife an Irish lady.

In 1721, Mme de Polignac and the Marquise de Nesle fought a famous duel over him. In 1729, he began an affair with Émilie du Châtelet, and although it ended, they continued to be frequent correspondents for over a decade.

He was also the lover of the famous courtesan and novelist Claudine Guérin de Tencin, and of Marie Louise Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans, Duchess of Berry, elder daughter of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, a very ambitious and powerful young widow who was infamous at the time for her alleged large sexual appetite. He then had an affair with Berry&#x27;s younger sister Charlotte Aglaé d&#x27;Orléans, and with her first cousin Louise Anne de Bourbon. Another mistress was Marie Sophie de Courcillon, wife of Charles François d&#x27;Albert d&#x27;Ailly, Duke of Picquigny and later of Hercule Mériadec de Rohan, Duke of Rohan-Rohan.

==Children==

# Louis &quot;Antoine&quot; Sophie de Vignerot du Plessis (4 February 1736 – 1791), married Adélaide Gabrielle de Hautefort in 1765 and had issue; married Marie Antoinette de Gallifet and had issue;
# &quot;Jeanne Sophie&quot; Elisabeth Septimanie de Vignerot du Plessis (1 March 1740 – 14 October 1773), married Don Casimir Pignatelli, Count of Egmont, Duke of Bisaccia; no issue.

<doc id="755290" wikidata="Q424294" url="?curid=755290" title="Ipratropium bromide">
<text>Ipratropium bromide, sold under the brand name Atrovent among others, is a type of anticholinergic medication which is applied by different routes: inhaler, nebulizer, or nasal spray, for different reasons. 

The inhalant opens up the medium and large airways in the lungs. It is used to treat the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. It is used by inhaler or nebulizer. Onset of action is typically within 15 to 30 minutes and lasts for three to five hours. 

The nasal spray prevents the glands in the nose from producing large amounts of fluid. It is used to treat rhinorrhea (runny nose) caused by allergic rhinitis, nonallergic rhinitis, and the common cold. It is used by metered-dose manual pump spray. Onset of action is within an hour. 
Common side effects of inhalant use include dry mouth, cough, inflammation of the airways, and shortness of breath. Potentially serious side effects include urinary retention, worsening spasms of the airways, and a severe allergic reaction. It appears to be safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Ipratropium is a short-acting muscarinic antagonist, which works by causing smooth muscles to relax.

Common side effects of nasal spray may include headache, dry nose, dry mouth or throat, nasal or throat irritation, nosebleeds, bad taste in mouth, nausea, dizziness, or constipation. Potentially serious side effects are unusual, but include severe allergic reaction, eye pain or change in vision, or urinary retention. It is considered safe during pregnancy, but it can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. 
Ipratropium bromide was patented in 1966, and approved for medical use in 1974. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines, the most important medicines needed in a health system. Ipratropium is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 219th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
Ipratropium as an inhalant can be used for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma exacerbation. It is supplied in a canister for use in an inhaler or in single dose vials for use in a nebulizer.

It is also used to treat and prevent minor and moderate bronchial asthma, especially asthma that is accompanied by cardiovascular system diseases, as it has been shown to produce fewer cardiovascular side effects.

Combination with beta-adrenergic agonists increases the dilating effect on the bronchi, as when ipratropium is combined with salbutamol (albuterol — USAN) under the trade names Combivent (a non-aerosol metered-dose inhaler or MDI) and Duoneb (nebulizer) for the management of COPD and asthma, and with fenoterol (trade names Duovent and Berodual N) for the management of asthma.

Ipratropium as a nasal solution sprayed into the nostrils can reduce rhinorrhea (runny nose) but will not help nasal congestion. It is supplied in a metered-dose manual pump spray.

== Contraindications ==
The main contraindication for ipratropium in any form is hypersensitivity to atropine and related substances. 

Conditions such as narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, or bladder neck obstruction are not necessarily contraindicators, but should be taken into account, particularly if the patient is receiving an anticholinergic by another route.

=== Peanut allergy ===
Previously, Atrovent inhalers used chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) as a propellant and contained soy lecithin in the propellant ingredients. In 2008 all CFC inhalers were phased out and hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) inhalers replaced them. Allergy to peanuts was noted for the inhaler as a contraindication but now is not. It has never been a contraindication when administered as a nebulized solution.

== Side effects ==
If ipratropium is inhaled, side effects resembling those of other anticholinergics are minimal. However, dry mouth and sedation have been reported. Also, effects such as skin flushing, tachycardia, acute angle-closure glaucoma, nausea, palpitations, and headache have been observed. Inhaled ipratropium does not decrease mucociliary clearance. The inhalation itself can cause headache and irritation of the throat in a few percent of patients.

Urinary retention has been reported in patients receiving doses by nebulizer. As a result, caution may be warranted, especially by men with prostatic hypertrophy.

Common side effects of nasal spray are experienced at a rate of 1-6% (versus the control group of 0-3%), and may include headache, dry nose, dry mouth or throat, nasal or throat irritation, nosebleeds, bad taste in mouth, nausea, dizziness, or constipation. Potentially serious side effects from nasal spray are rare, but include severe allergic reaction, eye pain or change in vision, or difficulty urinating. 

Accidental contact with the eye should be avoided. 
== Interactions ==
Interactions with other anticholinergics like tricyclic antidepressants, anti-Parkinson drugs and quinidine, which theoretically increase side effects, are clinically irrelevant when ipratropium is administered as an inhalant. 

Ipratropium nasal spray may interact with certain medications for depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions, certain medications for Parkinson&#x27;s disease such as benztropine and trihexyphenidyl, atropine, certain antihistamines for allergy, cough, and cold, certain medications for bladder problems such as oxybutynin and tolterodine, certain medications for stomach problems such as dicyclomine and hyoscyamine, and certain medications for motion sickness such as scopolamine.

== Pharmacology ==
Chemically, ipratropium bromide is a quaternary ammonium compound (which is indicated by the -ium per the BAN and the USAN) obtained by treating atropine with isopropyl bromide, thus the name: isopropyl + atropine. It is chemically related to components of the plant &quot;Datura stramonium&quot;, which was used in ancient India for asthma.

Ipratropium exhibits broncholytic action by reducing cholinergic influence on the bronchial musculature. It blocks muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, without specificity for subtypes, and therefore promotes the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), resulting in a decreased intracellular concentration of cGMP. Most likely due to actions of cGMP on intracellular calcium, this results in decreased contractility of smooth muscle in the lung, inhibiting bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion. It is a nonselective muscarinic antagonist, and does not diffuse into the blood, which prevents systemic side effects. Ipratropium is a derivative of atropine but is a quaternary amine and therefore does not cross the blood–brain barrier, which prevents central side effects. Ipratropium should never be used in place of salbutamol (albuterol) as a rescue medication.

<doc id="755291" wikidata="Q3835994" url="?curid=755291" title="Lock ring">
<text>A lock ring, also spelled lock-ring, is a late Bronze Age penannular (incomplete ring) hair ornament. Typically in gold, the intricate, decorative jewellery is recognized for its highly skilled workmanship. The name is derived from its suggested use as a hair fastener. Lock rings most likely originated in Ireland in the mid-eighth century B.C. They continued to be manufactured in Ireland, primarily in the River Shannon area into the seventh century B.C. Lock rings from the late Bronze Age have also been found in Great Britain and France.

==Description==
A lock ring is a hollow, penannular metal ornament with a central opening. The ring consists of a triangular cross-section, closed with a binding-strip. The ring was typically constructed from four pieces: a split metal tube, two gapped triangular shaped face-plates and a circular binding strip. Most lock rings are made in gold, although some rings are crafted in bronze or composite materials. Bronze lock rings are primarily found in France, and were generally manufactured locally.
The face-plates are plain or decorated with concentric lines, hatching or triangles. Many of the face-plates are made from sheet gold, a small number have been made from individual gold wires soldered together. The outer edge of the face-plates are typically held together by a binding strip made of the same material as the face-plate. The diameter of the ornament varies from 18mm to 100mm.

==History== 
The late Bronze Age gold ornaments known as &#x27;lock rings&#x27; were first recognized by archaeologists in the mid-19th century. They were described in scholarly publications as &#x27;objects of unknown use&#x27;, &#x27;bullae&#x27;, &#x27;hair pendants&#x27;, &#x27;double-conical beads&#x27;, &#x27;hair-rings&#x27; and &#x27;lock-rings&#x27;. The lock ring most likely originated in Ireland by the middle of the eighth century B.C. and continued to be produced in Ireland into the seventh century B.C. Several lock rings, along with other highly crafted gold objects, have been found in the River Shannon area in Ireland, in north Munster. The distribution of lock rings is divided into four major geographical groups: Ireland, North Britain, South Britain and France. Distribution of lock-rings outside of Ireland occurred by two different routes: northwards to Wales and northeast England and Scotland, and south-eastwards to southeast England. The lock rings found in Europe were concentrated in northwestern France.

During the late Bronze Age, finely made gold objects were important items of status and wealth.
They are of particular interest to scholars because of the intricacy and skilled workmanship used by Bronze Age goldsmiths. According to archaeologist, George Eogan, &quot;Like the gold bar torcs of an earlier phase, the lock-rings demonstrate the innovating tendency of the goldsmith, and the strength of the insular, especially the Irish, late Bronze age industry during its mature and final phase.&quot;

<text>[[Curvilinear coordinates|Curvilinear]] (top), [[Affine coordinate system|[[Curvilinear coordinates|affine]]]] (right), and [[Cartesian coordinate system|[[Curvilinear coordinates|Cartesian]]]] (left) coordinates in two-dimensional space

In geometry, curvilinear coordinates are a coordinate system for Euclidean space in which the coordinate lines may be curved. These coordinates may be derived from a set of Cartesian coordinates by using a transformation that is locally invertible (a one-to-one map) at each point. This means that one can convert a point given in a Cartesian coordinate system to its curvilinear coordinates and back. The name &quot;curvilinear coordinates&quot;, coined by the French mathematician Lamé, derives from the fact that the coordinate surfaces of the curvilinear systems are curved.

Well-known examples of curvilinear coordinate systems in three-dimensional Euclidean space (R3) are cylindrical and spherical coordinates. A Cartesian coordinate surface in this space is a coordinate plane; for example &quot;z&quot; = 0 defines the &quot;x&quot;-&quot;y&quot; plane. In the same space, the coordinate surface &quot;r&quot; = 1 in spherical coordinates is the surface of a unit sphere, which is curved. The formalism of curvilinear coordinates provides a unified and general description of the standard coordinate systems.

Curvilinear coordinates are often used to define the location or distribution of physical quantities which may be, for example, scalars, vectors, or tensors. Mathematical expressions involving these quantities in vector calculus and tensor analysis (such as the gradient, divergence, curl, and Laplacian) can be transformed from one coordinate system to another, according to transformation rules for scalars, vectors, and tensors. Such expressions then become valid for any curvilinear coordinate system.

A curvilinear coordinate system may be simpler to use than the Cartesian coordinate system for some applications. The motion of particles under the influence of central forces is usually easier to solve in spherical coordinates than in Cartesian coordinates; this is true of many physical problems with spherical symmetry defined in R3. Equations with boundary conditions that follow coordinate surfaces for a particular curvilinear coordinate system may be easier to solve in that system. While one might describe the motion of a particle in a rectangular box using Cartesian coordinates, it is easier to describe the motion in a sphere with spherical coordinates. Spherical coordinates are the most common curvilinear coordinate systems and are used in Earth sciences, cartography, quantum mechanics, relativity, and engineering.

==Orthogonal curvilinear coordinates in 3 dimensions==

=== Coordinates, basis, and vectors ===

For now, consider 3-D space. A point &quot;P&quot; in 3-D space (or its position vector r) can be defined using Cartesian coordinates (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) [equivalently written (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, &quot;x&quot;3)], by formula_1, where e&quot;x&quot;, e&quot;y&quot;, e&quot;z&quot; are the &quot;standard basis vectors&quot;.

It can also be defined by its curvilinear coordinates (&quot;q&quot;1, &quot;q&quot;2, &quot;q&quot;3) if this triplet of numbers defines a single point in an unambiguous way. The relation between the coordinates is then given by the invertible transformation functions:

:formula_2
:formula_3

The surfaces &quot;q&quot;1 = constant, &quot;q&quot;2 = constant, &quot;q&quot;3 = constant are called the coordinate surfaces; and the space curves formed by their intersection in pairs are called the coordinate curves. The coordinate axes are determined by the tangents to the coordinate curves at the intersection of three surfaces. They are not in general fixed directions in space, which happens to be the case for simple Cartesian coordinates, and thus there is generally no natural global basis for curvilinear coordinates.

In the Cartesian system, the standard basis vectors can be derived from the derivative of the location of point &quot;P&quot; with respect to the local coordinate

:formula_4

Applying the same derivatives to the curvilinear system locally at point &quot;P&quot; defines the natural basis vectors:

:formula_5

Such a basis, whose vectors change their direction and/or magnitude from point to point is called a local basis. All bases associated with curvilinear coordinates are necessarily local. Basis vectors that are the same at all points are global bases, and can be associated only with linear or affine coordinate systems.

For this article e is reserved for the standard basis (Cartesian) and h or b is for the curvilinear basis.

These may not have unit length, and may also not be orthogonal. In the case that they &quot;are&quot; orthogonal at all points where the derivatives are well-defined, we define the Lamé coefficients (after Gabriel Lamé) by

:formula_6

and the curvilinear orthonormal basis vectors by

:formula_7

These basis vectors may well depend upon the position of &quot;P&quot;; it is therefore necessary that they are not assumed to be constant over a region. (They technically form a basis for the tangent bundle of formula_8 at &quot;P&quot;, and so are local to &quot;P&quot;.)

In general, curvilinear coordinates allow the natural basis vectors hi not all mutually perpendicular to each other, and not required to be of unit length: they can be of arbitrary magnitude and direction. The use of an orthogonal basis makes vector manipulations simpler than for non-orthogonal. However, some areas of physics and engineering, particularly fluid mechanics and continuum mechanics, require non-orthogonal bases to describe deformations and fluid transport to account for complicated directional dependences of physical quantities. A discussion of the general case appears later on this page.

==Vector calculus==
===Differential elements===

In orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, since the total differential change in r is

:formula_9

so scale factors are formula_10

In non-orthogonal coordinates the length of formula_11 is the positive square root of formula_12 (with Einstein summation convention). The six independent scalar products &quot;gij&quot;=h&quot;i&quot;.h&quot;j&quot; of the natural basis vectors generalize the three scale factors defined above for orthogonal coordinates. The nine &quot;gij&quot; are the components of the metric tensor, which has only three non zero components in orthogonal coordinates: &quot;g&quot;11=&quot;h&quot;1&quot;h&quot;1, &quot;g&quot;22=&quot;h&quot;2&quot;h&quot;2, &quot;g&quot;33=&quot;h&quot;3&quot;h&quot;3.

==Covariant and contravariant bases==

Spatial gradients, distances, time derivatives and scale factors are interrelated within a coordinate system by two groups of basis vectors:

# basis vectors that are locally tangent to their associated coordinate pathline: formula_13 are contravariant vectors (denoted by lowered indices), and
# basis vectors that are locally normal to the isosurface created by the other coordinates: formula_14 are covariant vectors (denoted by raised indices), ∇ is the del operator.

Note that, because of Einstein&#x27;s summation convention, the position of the indices of the vectors is the opposite of that of the coordinates.

Consequently, a general curvilinear coordinate system has two sets of basis vectors for every point: {b1, b2, b3} is the contravariant basis, and {b1, b2, b3} is the covariant (a.k.a. reciprocal) basis. The covariant and contravariant basis vectors types have identical direction for orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems, but as usual have inverted units with respect to each other.

Note the following important equality:
formula_15
wherein formula_16 denotes the generalized Kronecker delta.

{\partial q^j} dq^j = \mathbf{b}^i \cdot \mathbf{b}_j dq^j&lt;/math&gt;

and the Einstein summation convention is implied.

A vector v can be specified in terms of either basis, i.e.,

:formula_17

Using the Einstein summation convention, the basis vectors relate to the components by
:formula_18
:formula_19
and
:formula_20
:formula_21
where &quot;g&quot; is the metric tensor (see below).

A vector can be specified with covariant coordinates (lowered indices, written &quot;vk&quot;) or contravariant coordinates (raised indices, written &quot;vk&quot;). From the above vector sums, it can be seen that contravariant coordinates are associated with covariant basis vectors, and covariant coordinates are associated with contravariant basis vectors.

A key feature of the representation of vectors and tensors in terms of indexed components and basis vectors is &quot;invariance&quot; in the sense that vector components which transform in a covariant manner (or contravariant manner) are paired with basis vectors that transform in a contravariant manner (or covariant manner).

==Integration==
===Constructing a covariant basis in one dimension===

Consider the one-dimensional curve shown in Fig. 3. At point &quot;P&quot;, taken as an origin, &quot;x&quot; is one of the Cartesian coordinates, and &quot;q&quot;1 is one of the curvilinear coordinates. The local (non-unit) basis vector is b1 (notated h1 above, with b reserved for unit vectors) and it is built on the &quot;q&quot;1 axis which is a tangent to that coordinate line at the point &quot;P&quot;. The axis &quot;q&quot;1 and thus the vector b1 form an angle formula_22 with the Cartesian &quot;x&quot; axis and the Cartesian basis vector e1.

It can be seen from triangle &quot;PAB&quot; that
:formula_23
where |e1|, |b1| are the magnitudes of the two basis vectors, i.e., the scalar intercepts &quot;PB&quot; and &quot;PA&quot;. &quot;PA&quot; is also the projection of b1 on the &quot;x&quot; axis.

However, this method for basis vector transformations using &quot;directional cosines&quot; is inapplicable to curvilinear coordinates for the following reasons:
#By increasing the distance from &quot;P&quot;, the angle between the curved line &quot;q&quot;1 and Cartesian axis &quot;x&quot; increasingly deviates from formula_22.
#At the distance &quot;PB&quot; the true angle is that which the tangent at point C forms with the &quot;x&quot; axis and the latter angle is clearly different from formula_22.

The angles that the &quot;q&quot;1 line and that axis form with the &quot;x&quot; axis become closer in value the closer one moves towards point &quot;P&quot; and become exactly equal at &quot;P&quot;.

Let point &quot;E&quot; be located very close to &quot;P&quot;, so close that the distance &quot;PE&quot; is infinitesimally small. Then &quot;PE&quot; measured on the &quot;q&quot;1 axis almost coincides with &quot;PE&quot; measured on the &quot;q&quot;1 line. At the same time, the ratio &quot;PD/PE&quot; (&quot;PD&quot; being the projection of &quot;PE&quot; on the &quot;x&quot; axis) becomes almost exactly equal to formula_26.

Let the infinitesimally small intercepts &quot;PD&quot; and &quot;PE&quot; be labelled, respectively, as &quot;dx&quot; and d&quot;q&quot;1. Then
:formula_27.

Thus, the directional cosines can be substituted in transformations with the more exact ratios between infinitesimally small coordinate intercepts. It follows that the component (projection) of b1 on the &quot;x&quot; axis is

:formula_28.

If &quot;qi&quot; = &quot;qi&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, &quot;x&quot;3) and &quot;xi&quot; = &quot;xi&quot;(&quot;q&quot;1, &quot;q&quot;2, &quot;q&quot;3) are smooth (continuously differentiable) functions the transformation ratios can be written as formula_29 and formula_30. That is, those ratios are partial derivatives of coordinates belonging to one system with respect to coordinates belonging to the other system.

===Constructing a covariant basis in three dimensions===

Doing the same for the coordinates in the other 2 dimensions, b1 can be expressed as:
:formula_31
Similar equations hold for b2 and b3 so that the standard basis {e1, e2, e3} is transformed to a local (ordered and normalised) basis {b1, b2, b3} by the following system of equations:

:formula_32

By analogous reasoning, one can obtain the inverse transformation from local basis to standard basis:
:formula_33

===Jacobian of the transformation===

The above systems of linear equations can be written in matrix form using the Einstein summation convention as
:formula_34.

This coefficient matrix of the linear system is the Jacobian matrix (and its inverse) of the transformation. These are the equations that can be used to transform a Cartesian basis into a curvilinear basis, and vice versa.

In three dimensions, the expanded forms of these matrices are
:formula_35

In the inverse transformation (second equation system), the unknowns are the curvilinear basis vectors. For any specific location there can only exist one and only one set of basis vectors (else the basis is not well defined at that point). This condition is satisfied if and only if the equation system has a single solution. In linear algebra, a linear equation system has a single solution (non-trivial) only if the determinant of its system matrix is non-zero:
:formula_36
which shows the rationale behind the above requirement concerning the inverse Jacobian determinant.

==Generalization to &quot;n&quot; dimensions==

The formalism extends to any finite dimension as follows.

Consider the real Euclidean &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space, that is R&quot;n&quot; = R × R × ... × R (&quot;n&quot; times) where R is the set of real numbers and × denotes the Cartesian product, which is a vector space.

The coordinates of this space can be denoted by: x = (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2...,&quot;xn&quot;). Since this is a vector (an element of the vector space), it can be written as:

:formula_37

where e1 = (1,0,0...,0), e2 = (0,1,0...,0), e3 = (0,0,1...,0)...,e&quot;n&quot; = (0,0,0...,1) is the &quot;standard basis set of vectors&quot; for the space R&quot;n&quot;, and &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2...&quot;n&quot; is an index labelling components. Each vector has exactly one component in each dimension (or &quot;axis&quot;) and they are mutually orthogonal (perpendicular) and normalized (has unit magnitude).

More generally, we can define basis vectors b&quot;i&quot; so that they depend on q = (&quot;q&quot;1, &quot;q&quot;2...,&quot;qn&quot;), i.e. they change from point to point: b&quot;i&quot; = b&quot;i&quot;(q). In which case to define the same point x in terms of this alternative basis: the &quot;coordinates&quot; with respect to this basis &quot;vi&quot; also necessarily depend on x also, that is &quot;vi&quot; = &quot;vi&quot;(x). Then a vector v in this space, with respect to these alternative coordinates and basis vectors, can be expanded as a linear combination in this basis (which simply means to multiply each basis vector e&quot;i&quot; by a number &quot;v&quot;&quot;i&quot; – scalar multiplication):

:formula_38

The vector sum that describes v in the new basis is composed of different vectors, although the sum itself remains the same.

==Transformation of coordinates==

From a more general and abstract perspective, a curvilinear coordinate system is simply a coordinate patch on the differentiable manifold En (n-dimensional Euclidean space) that is diffeomorphic to the Cartesian coordinate patch on the manifold. Two diffeomorphic coordinate patches on a differential manifold need not overlap differentiably. With this simple definition of a curvilinear coordinate system, all the results that follow below are simply applications of standard theorems in differential topology.

The transformation functions are such that there&#x27;s a one-to-one relationship between points in the &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; coordinates, that is, those functions are bijections, and fulfil the following requirements within their domains:
==Vector and tensor algebra in three-dimensional curvilinear coordinates==

Elementary vector and tensor algebra in curvilinear coordinates is used in some of the older scientific literature in mechanics and physics and can be indispensable to understanding work from the early and mid-1900s, for example the text by Green and Zerna. Some useful relations in the algebra of vectors and second-order tensors in curvilinear coordinates are given in this section. The notation and contents are primarily from Ogden, Naghdi, Simmonds, Green and Zerna, Basar and Weichert, and Ciarlet.

==Tensors in curvilinear coordinates==

A second-order tensor can be expressed as
:formula_39
where formula_40 denotes the tensor product. The components &quot;Sij&quot; are called the contravariant components, &quot;Si j&quot; the mixed right-covariant components, &quot;Si j&quot; the mixed left-covariant components, and &quot;Sij&quot; the covariant components of the second-order tensor. The components of the second-order tensor are related by

:formula_41

===The metric tensor in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates===
At each point, one can construct a small line element , so the square of the length of the line element is the scalar product dx • dx and is called the metric of the space, given by:

:formula_42.

The following portion of the above equation
:formula_43
is a &quot;symmetric&quot; tensor called the fundamental (or metric) tensor of the Euclidean space in curvilinear coordinates.

Indices can be raised and lowered by the metric:
:formula_44

====Relation to Lamé coefficients====

Defining the scale factors &quot;hi&quot; by

:formula_45

gives a relation between the metric tensor and the Lamé coefficients, and

:formula_46

where &quot;hij&quot; are the Lamé coefficients. For an orthogonal basis we also have:

:formula_47

====Example: Polar coordinates====

If we consider polar coordinates for R2,
:formula_48
(r, θ) are the curvilinear coordinates, and the Jacobian determinant of the transformation (&quot;r&quot;,θ) → (&quot;r&quot; cos θ, &quot;r&quot; sin θ) is &quot;r&quot;.

The orthogonal basis vectors are b&quot;r&quot; = (cos θ, sin θ), bθ = (−r sin θ, r cos θ). The scale factors are &quot;h&quot;&quot;r&quot; = 1 and &quot;h&quot;θ= &quot;r&quot;. The fundamental tensor is &quot;g&quot;11 =1, &quot;g&quot;22 =&quot;r&quot;2, &quot;g&quot;12 = &quot;g&quot;21 =0.

===The alternating tensor===

In an orthonormal right-handed basis, the third-order alternating tensor is defined as

:formula_49

In a general curvilinear basis the same tensor may be expressed as

:formula_50

It can also be shown that
:formula_51

===Christoffel symbols===

;Christoffel symbols of the first kind formula_52:

:formula_53

where the comma denotes a partial derivative (see Ricci calculus). To express Γ&quot;kij&quot; in terms of &quot;gij&quot;,

:formula_54

Since
:formula_55
using these to rearrange the above relations gives

:formula_56

;Christoffel symbols of the second kind formula_57:

:formula_58

This implies that
:formula_59 since formula_60.

Other relations that follow are
:formula_61

===Vector operations===
==Vector and tensor calculus in three-dimensional curvilinear coordinates==
Adjustments need to be made in the calculation of line, surface and volume integrals. For simplicity, the following restricts to three dimensions and orthogonal curvilinear coordinates. However, the same arguments apply for &quot;n&quot;-dimensional spaces. When the coordinate system is not orthogonal, there are some additional terms in the expressions.

Simmonds, in his book on tensor analysis, quotes Albert Einstein saying

The magic of this theory will hardly fail to impose itself on anybody who has truly understood it; it represents a genuine triumph of the method of absolute differential calculus, founded by Gauss, Riemann, Ricci, and Levi-Civita.

Vector and tensor calculus in general curvilinear coordinates is used in tensor analysis on four-dimensional curvilinear manifolds in general relativity, in the mechanics of curved shells, in examining the invariance properties of Maxwell&#x27;s equations which has been of interest in metamaterials and in many other fields.

Some useful relations in the calculus of vectors and second-order tensors in curvilinear coordinates are given in this section. The notation and contents are primarily from Ogden, Simmonds, Green and Zerna, Basar and Weichert, and Ciarlet.

Let φ = φ(x) be a well defined scalar field and v = v(x) a well-defined vector field, and &quot;λ&quot;1, &quot;λ&quot;2... be parameters of the coordinates

===Geometric elements===

 = \sqrt{ g_{ij}\cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial \lambda}\cfrac{\partial q^j}{\partial \lambda}} = \sqrt{h_{i}^2\left(\cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial \lambda}\right)^2} &lt;/math&gt;
|2= Tangent plane element: If x(&quot;λ&quot;1, &quot;λ&quot;2) parametrizes a surface &quot;S&quot; in Cartesian coordinates, then the following cross product of tangent vectors is a normal vector to &quot;S&quot; with the magnitude of infinitesimal plane element, in curvilinear coordinates. Using the above result,

:formula_62

where formula_63 is the permutation symbol. In determinant form:

:formula_64

===Integration===

===Differentiation===

The expressions for the gradient, divergence, and Laplacian can be directly extended to &quot;n&quot;-dimensions, however the curl is only defined in 3D.

The vector field b&quot;i&quot; is tangent to the &quot;qi&quot; coordinate curve and forms a natural basis at each point on the curve. This basis, as discussed at the beginning of this article, is also called the covariant curvilinear basis. We can also define a reciprocal basis, or contravariant curvilinear basis, b&quot;i&quot;. All the algebraic relations between the basis vectors, as discussed in the section on tensor algebra, apply for the natural basis and its reciprocal at each point x.

==Fictitious forces in general curvilinear coordinates==
By definition, if a particle with no forces acting on it has its position expressed in an inertial coordinate system, (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, &quot;x&quot;3, &quot;t&quot;), then there it will have no acceleration (d2&quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot;/d&quot;t&quot;2 = 0). In this context, a coordinate system can fail to be &quot;inertial&quot; either due to non-straight time axis or non-straight space axes (or both). In other words, the basis vectors of the coordinates may vary in time at fixed positions, or they may vary with position at fixed times, or both. When equations of motion are expressed in terms of any non-inertial coordinate system (in this sense), extra terms appear, called Christoffel symbols. Strictly speaking, these terms represent components of the absolute acceleration (in classical mechanics), but we may also choose to continue to regard d2&quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot;/d&quot;t&quot;2 as the acceleration (as if the coordinates were inertial) and treat the extra terms as if they were forces, in which case they are called fictitious forces. The component of any such fictitious force normal to the path of the particle and in the plane of the path&#x27;s curvature is then called centrifugal force.

This more general context makes clear the correspondence between the concepts of centrifugal force in rotating coordinate systems and in stationary curvilinear coordinate systems. (Both of these concepts appear frequently in the literature.) For a simple example, consider a particle of mass &quot;m&quot; moving in a circle of radius &quot;r&quot; with angular speed &quot;w&quot; relative to a system of polar coordinates rotating with angular speed &quot;W&quot;. The radial equation of motion is &quot;mr&quot;” = &quot;F&quot;&quot;r&quot; + &quot;mr&quot;(&quot;w&quot; + &quot;W&quot;)2. Thus the centrifugal force is &quot;mr&quot; times the square of the absolute rotational speed &quot;A&quot; = &quot;w&quot; + &quot;W&quot; of the particle. If we choose a coordinate system rotating at the speed of the particle, then &quot;W&quot; = &quot;A&quot; and &quot;w&quot; = 0, in which case the centrifugal force is &quot;mrA&quot;2, whereas if we choose a stationary coordinate system we have &quot;W&quot; = 0 and &quot;w&quot; = &quot;A&quot;, in which case the centrifugal force is again &quot;mrA&quot;2. The reason for this equality of results is that in both cases the basis vectors at the particle&#x27;s location are changing in time in exactly the same way. Hence these are really just two different ways of describing exactly the same thing, one description being in terms of rotating coordinates and the other being in terms of stationary curvilinear coordinates, both of which are non-inertial according to the more abstract meaning of that term.

When describing general motion, the actual forces acting on a particle are often referred to the instantaneous osculating circle tangent to the path of motion, and this circle in the general case is not centered at a fixed location, and so the decomposition into centrifugal and Coriolis components is constantly changing. This is true regardless of whether the motion is described in terms of stationary or rotating coordinates.

<doc id="755306" wikidata="Q7075674" url="?curid=755306" title="Occasional Conformity Act 1711">
<text>The Occasional Conformity Act (10 Ann. c. 6), also known as the Occasional Conformity Act 1711 or the Toleration Act 1711, was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain which passed on 20 December 1711. Previous Occasional Conformity bills had been debated in 1702 and 1704, the latter causing the &#x27;Tackers&#x27; controversy. It was passed by the Tories to undermine the Whig party, and to ensure that elections to Parliament were under the control of Tories, with non-conformists locked out. It applied to any national or local official in England or Wales who was required to attend Church of England services and take the Lord&#x27;s Supper. If such a person attended &quot;any conventicle, assembly or meeting&quot; of any other religion, they would be subject to a penalty of £40 and permanently barred from government employment. (The Act did not extend to Scotland, the independence of whose Presbyterian state church (&quot;kirk&quot;) was guaranteed by the Acts of Union.)

A notable occasional conformist had been the Queen&#x27;s husband, Prince George, a practising Lutheran; despite this, he had voted for the earlier failed bill in the House of Lords at his wife&#x27;s request, but died in 1708 before the passage of the act.

Its purpose was to prevent Nonconformists and Roman Catholics from taking &quot;occasional&quot; communion in the Church of England in order to become eligible for public office under the Corporation Act 1661 and the Test Act. Under these acts only members of the Church of England were allowed to hold any office of public trust. The 1711 Act was repealed in 1719. When it was in effect it had little impact. Non-conformist officials were either protected by powerful patrons, or attended private services that were not covered.

Hypocrisy became a major topic in English political history in the early 18th century. The Toleration Act 1688 allowed for certain rights, but it left Protestant Nonconformists (such as Congregationalists and Baptists) deprived of important rights, including that of office-holding. Nonconformists who wanted office ostentatiously took the Anglican sacrament once a year in order to avoid the restrictions. High Church Anglicans were outraged and outlawed what they called &quot;occasional conformity&quot; in 1711 with the Occasional Conformity Act. In the political controversies using sermons, speeches, and pamphlet wars, both high churchmen and Nonconformists attacked their opponents as insincere and hypocritical, as well as dangerously zealous, in contrast to their own moderation. This campaign of moderation versus zealotry peaked in 1709 during the impeachment trial of high church preacher Henry Sacheverell. By its very ferocity, the debate may have contributed subsequently to more temperate and less charged political discourse. Occasional conformity was restored by the Whigs when they returned to power in 1719.

<doc id="755311" wikidata="Q641620" url="?curid=755311" title="Seventh Son of a Seventh Son">
<text>Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is the seventh studio album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It was released on 11 April 1988 in the United Kingdom by EMI Records and in the United States by Capitol Records. Like &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; (1982) and later &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; (1992), &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Book of Souls&quot; (2015), the album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. The lead single &quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot; was also a commercial success, peaking at No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart.

A concept album inspired by the novel &quot;Seventh Son&quot; by Orson Scott Card, the record incorporates elements of progressive rock, seen in the length and complex structure of the title track. It was also the first Iron Maiden album to feature keyboards, after the band had introduced non-keyboard synth effects on their previous LP, &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (1986). 

After his contributions were rejected for &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;, &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot; features several songs co-written by lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson, who states that his enthusiasm for the band was renewed during the album&#x27;s production stages. It was Iron Maiden&#x27;s last studio record to feature the &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;-era lineup until the 2000 album &quot;Brave New World&quot;, with guitarist Adrian Smith leaving the band in January 1990 after he did not approve of the direction the band were aiming for on their next album &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot;. 

Following the album&#x27;s release, the band embarked on the Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour in which Derek Riggs&#x27; cover artwork was recreated on stage. The band played over 100 shows, including the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park, and recorded the &quot;Maiden England&quot; video at Birmingham&#x27;s NEC. From 2012 to 2014, the band revisited the &quot;Seventh Son&quot; era on their Maiden England World Tour.

==Background, writing and concept==
The idea to base the album around the folklore concept of the seventh son of a seventh son came to bassist Steve Harris after he read Orson Scott Card&#x27;s &quot;Seventh Son&quot;. Harris stated, &quot;It was our seventh studio album and I didn&#x27;t have a title for it or any ideas at all. Then I read the story of the seventh son, this mystical figure that was supposed to have all these paranormal gifts, like second sight and what have you, and it was more, at first, that it was just a good title for the seventh album, you know? But then I rang Bruce Dickinson and started talking about it and the idea just grew.&quot;

After his songwriting contributions were rejected from the band&#x27;s previous album, 1986&#x27;s &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;, Dickinson felt that his role within the band had diminished, as he &quot;just became the singer&quot;, but felt renewed enthusiasm when Harris explained the concept to him; &quot;I thought, &#x27;What a great idea! Brilliant!&#x27; And of course I was really chuffed, too, because he&#x27;d actually rung me to talk about it and ask me if I had any songs that might fit that sort of theme. I was like, &#x27;Well, no, but give me a minute and I&#x27;ll see what I can do. Speaking about the record in later years, however, Dickinson remarked that &quot;we almost did [something great]&quot;, explaining that, &quot;it was only half a concept album. There was no attempt to see it all the way through, like we really should have done. &quot;Seventh Son...&quot; has no story. It&#x27;s about good and evil, heaven and hell, but isn&#x27;t every Iron Maiden record?&quot;

In addition to Dickinson&#x27;s return to writing, the album was also notable for its number of co-written pieces, in contrast to its predecessor, with five of the eight tracks being collaborative efforts. According to Harris, this was probably because they &quot;spent more time checking up on each other to see what everybody else was up to, just to make sure the story fitted properly and went somewhere&quot;. To make sure each song fit with the record&#x27;s concept, the band drew up a basic outline for the story, which Harris states &quot;didn&#x27;t make the actual writing any easier ... I probably took longer over the writing I&#x27;ve done on this album than any I&#x27;ve done before. But the stuff we all started coming up with, once we&#x27;d agreed that we were definitely going for a fully fledged &#x27;concept&#x27; album, really startled me. It was so much better than anything we&#x27;d done in ages&quot;.

Stylistically, &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot; developed the sounds first heard on &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;, although, on this occasion, the synth effects were created by keyboards rather than bass or guitar synthesisers. According to Dickinson, the band decided not to hire a keyboard player, with the parts being &quot;mainly one-finger stuff from Adrian [Smith, guitarist], Steve, the engineer or whoever had a finger free at the time&quot;. Harris was fond of the development, in spite of the fact that the record did not sell as well as its predecessor in the United States; &quot;I thought it was the best album we did since &quot;Piece of Mind&quot;. I loved it because it was more progressive—I thought the keyboards really fitted in brilliantly—&#x27;cause that&#x27;s the influences I grew up with, and I was so pissed off with the Americans, because they didn&#x27;t really seem to accept it. Everyone said afterwards that it was a European-sounding album. I&#x27;m not so sure about that. What&#x27;s a European-sounding album? To me, it&#x27;s just a Maiden-sounding album.&quot;

&quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot; and its supporting tour marked the last appearance of Adrian Smith until he returned to the band in 1999. The guitarist left during the pre-production stages of the band&#x27;s following album, 1990&#x27;s &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot;, as he was unhappy with the more &quot;street-level&quot; direction the group were taking, professing that he &quot;thought we were heading in the right direction with the last two albums&quot; and that he &quot;thought we needed to keep going forward, and it just didn&#x27;t feel like that to me&quot;.

==Songs==
&quot;The Clairvoyant&quot; was the first track written for the album. According to Steve Harris, the song&#x27;s lyrics were inspired by the death of psychic Doris Stokes, after which he wondered to himself whether &quot;she could foresee her own death&quot;. Harris then began to write the song &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;, which gave him the idea of turning the full album into a concept record given that the main character would also have the power of clairvoyance.

According to Smith, the song &quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot; &quot;actually started life as a ballad I had been working on called &#x27;On the Wings of Eagles&#x27;. Then Bruce had a verse for it but wanted to change the title to &#x27;Can I Play with Madness&#x27;. I must admit, it did sound better that way. So we took that one and Steve liked it, too. It was Steve who came up with the time change in the middle and the instrumental passage, which again gave it that lift it needed.&quot; According to Dickinson, however, Harris&#x27; addition resulted in &quot;a big row ... Adrian absolutely hated it.&quot;

Of the album&#x27;s remaining songs, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; states that &quot;Moonchild&quot; is loosely based on the Aleister Crowley novel of the same name, while &quot;Infinite Dreams&quot; is about a character who &quot;implores a spiritualist to unlock the meaning behind his tortured dreams&quot;, although Sputnikmusic state that the song also explores &quot;themes of reality, life after death, and the meaning of life&quot;. The final track, &quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot;, closes the storyline and was later featured in an episode of the 1980s&#x27; TV series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. The record opens and closes with an identical brief acoustic piece accompanied by two verses of lyrics, written by Dickinson, which, according to Sputnikmusic, &quot;foreshadows doom and failure for the protagonist&quot; and &quot;wraps up the album&quot;.

&quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot;, &quot;The Clairvoyant&quot; and &quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot; have been played live the most frequently following the Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour.

==Promotion==
To promote the album, the band hosted an evening of television, radio and press interviews at Castle Schnellenberg in Attendorn, Germany prior to the record&#x27;s release, before holding a small number of &quot;secret&quot; club shows, under the name &quot;Charlotte and the Harlots&quot;, at Empire, Cologne and L&#x27;Amour, New York. In May, the group set out on a supporting tour which saw them perform to more than two million people worldwide over seven months. In August, the band headlined the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park for the first time before a crowd of 107,000, the largest in Donington&#x27;s history, and recorded a concert video, entitled &quot;Maiden England&quot; at the NEC, Birmingham in November. To recreate the album&#x27;s keyboards onstage, the group recruited Michael Kenney, Steve Harris&#x27; bass technician, to play the keys throughout the tour, during which he would perform the song &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot; on a forklift truck under the alias of &quot;The Count&quot; (for which he would wear a black cape and mask). Iron Maiden was apparently included in the Guinness Book Of World Records Museum in Las Vegas, NV. According to The Guinness book of Records (1990 ed. p. 155): &quot;Largest PA system: On Aug 20th 1988 at the Castle Donington &#x27;Monsters of Rock&#x27; Festival a total of 360 Turbosound cabinets offering a potential 523kW of programme power, formed the largest front-of-house PA. The average Sound Pressure Level at the mixing tower was 118dB, peaking at a maximum of 124dB during Iron Maiden&#x27;s set. It took five days to set up the system.&quot;

==Cover artwork==
According to Rod Smallwood, the band&#x27;s manager, the brief given to Derek Riggs (the group&#x27;s then regular artist) was, unlike with previous albums, to create &quot;simply something surreal and bloody weird&quot;. Riggs confirms that &quot;they said they wanted one of my surreal things. &#x27;It&#x27;s about prophecy and seeing into the future, and we want one of your surreal things.&#x27; That was the brief ... I had a limited time to do the picture, and I thought it was pretty weird their concept, so I just went with that.&quot;

According to Dickinson, his revitalised enthusiasm, brought about by Harris&#x27;s idea to make a concept album, carried forward into the cover artwork, saying, &quot;I was probably responsible in a large part for the cover, with Derek.&quot; Dickinson states that the idea to set the painting in a polar landscape may have originated from when he showed Riggs a Gustave Doré piece, depicting traitors frozen in a lake of ice in the ninth circle of Dante&#x27;s Inferno. In contradiction of this, Riggs states that the setting was because he &quot;might have just seen a documentary about the North Pole or something ... I wanted something that was a departure from all the cityscapes and things. It was about prophecy and seeing the future, and so I just wanted something distant. And then they said, on the back, &#x27;Could you stick all the other Eddies in the ice?&#x27; So I did.&quot;

Speaking about the depiction of the band&#x27;s mascot, Eddie, Riggs states that &quot;I thought, you know, I don&#x27;t feel like painting all of Eddie, so I&#x27;ll get rid of him. I&#x27;ll chop him off, and make it look kind of non-pleasant.&quot; In addition to the lobotomy and cyborg enhancements, left over from the &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; and &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; album covers respectively, this incarnation also comes with an in utero baby in his left hand and an apple, inspired by the Garden of Eden and featuring a red and green yin and yang. On top of this, Eddie&#x27;s head is on fire, which Riggs states is &quot;a symbol for inspiration&quot;, an idea which he &quot;stole&quot; from Arthur Brown.

==Critical reception==

The album has received consistent critical praise since its release, with AllMusic rating it 4.5 out of 5, saying that the addition of keyboards &quot;restores the crunch that was sometimes lacking in the shinier production of the previous album&quot; and that it &quot;ranks among their best work&quot;. Sputnikmusic scored the album 4 out of 5, and, while they state that &quot;the band has better releases, such as &quot;Powerslave&quot; and &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;&quot;, they argue that it is &quot;lyrically ... one of Maiden&#x27;s finest efforts&quot;. In 2005, the album was ranked No. 305 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In his biography of the band, Paul Stenning stated, &quot;this line-up of the group hit its peak in 1988&quot;. It also ranked No. 11 in &quot;Loudwire&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;Top 25 Progressive Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

Although Geoff Barton states that contemporary reviews contained &quot;a definite reaction against Maiden emphasising their prog-rock pretensions&quot;, and that &quot;one critic ... slammed Maiden for &quot;Seventh Son...&quot; and accused them of having regressed into Genesis-style prog rockers from the 70s&quot;, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; were extremely positive upon the album&#x27;s release, awarding full marks and stating that &quot;[with &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;] Iron Maiden have given rock music back its direction and its pride&quot; and that the record &quot;will eventually be hailed alongside such past milestones as &quot;Tommy&quot;, &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; and &quot;[The] Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.&quot; In 2024, Jeff Giles wrote that &quot;Seventh Son&quot; found Iron Maiden sounding like &quot;a more aggressive version of Yes or Kansas.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted at No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart (their first since &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;) as well as No. 12 in the US, while the singles &quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot;, &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot; and &quot;The Clairvoyant (live)&quot; reached No. 3, No. 5 and No. 6 positions respectively in the UK Singles Chart. Smith highlights &quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot; as &quot;our first proper hit single.&quot;

==Track listing==

* The US version of the 1995 reissue bonus disc features a somewhat different track order, with &quot;Infinite Dreams&quot; playing after &quot;The Prisoner&quot;.

<doc id="755312" wikidata="Q1597639" url="?curid=755312" title="Buena Vista Social Club (album)">
<text>Buena Vista Social Club is a studio album by Buena Vista Social Club, an ensemble of Cuban musicians directed by Juan de Marcos González and American guitarist Ry Cooder. Produced by Cooder, it was recorded at Havana&#x27;s EGREM studios in March 1996 and released on September 16, 1997, through World Circuit internationally and Nonesuch Records in the United States. It is the only standard studio album exclusively credited to the Buena Vista Social Club.

&quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; was recorded in parallel with &quot;A toda Cuba le gusta&quot; by the Afro-Cuban All Stars, a similar project also promoted by World Circuit executive Nick Gold and featuring largely the same lineup. In contrast to &quot;A toda Cuba le gusta&quot;, which was conceived as a revival of the son &quot;conjunto&quot;, &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; was meant to bring back the traditional trova and filin, a mellower take on the Cuban son and bolero, as well as the danzón.

The album was a critical and commercial success. Its release was followed by a short concert tour in Amsterdam and New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall in 1998. Footage from these dates, as well as from the recording sessions in Havana, was shown in the 1999 documentary &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; directed by Wim Wenders. In 2022, the album was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. In the same year it was recognized by the Guinness World Records as the best-selling world music album.

==Background==
In 1996, American guitarist Ry Cooder was invited to Havana by British world music producer Nick Gold of World Circuit Records to record a session in which two African highlife musicians from Mali were to collaborate with Cuban musicians. When Cooder arrived (via Mexico to avoid the ongoing U.S. trade and travel embargo against Cuba), it was found that the musicians from Africa had not received their visas and were unable to come. Cooder and Gold changed their plans and decided to record an album of Cuban &quot;son&quot; music with local musicians instead. Cuban musicians already involved in the African collaboration project included bassist Orlando &quot;Cachaito&quot; López, guitarist Eliades Ochoa and musical director Juan de Marcos González, who had himself been organizing a similar project for the Afro-Cuban All Stars. A search for additional musicians led the team to singer Manuel &quot;Puntillita&quot; Licea, pianist Rubén González, trumpeter Manuel &quot;Guajiro&quot; Mirabal and octogenarian singer Compay Segundo, who all agreed to record for the project.

Cooder, Gold and de Marcos organized a large group of performers (twenty are credited) and arranged recording sessions at Havana&#x27;s EGREM Studios, formerly owned by RCA records, where the equipment and atmosphere had remained unchanged since the 1950s. Communication between the Spanish and English speakers at the studio was conducted via an interpreter, although Cooder reflected that &quot;musicians understand each other through means other than speaking&quot;.
==Recording==
The album contained fourteen tracks and was recorded in six days. It opened with &quot;Chan Chan&quot; written by Compay Segundo, a four-chord &quot;son&quot; (Dm, F, Gm, A7) that was to become what Cooder described as &quot;the Buena Vista&#x27;s calling card&quot;; and ending with a rendition of &quot;La bayamesa&quot;, a traditional Cuban patriotic song (not to be confused with the Cuban national anthem of the same name). The sessions also produced material for the subsequent release &quot;Introducing...Rubén González&quot; which showcased the work of the Cuban pianist. Among the songs left off the album were the classic bolero-son &quot;Lágrimas negras&quot;, which was deemed too popular for inclusion, and Compay Segundo&#x27;s &quot;Macusa&quot;. Both songs were later released on the compilation &quot;Lost and Found&quot;.

===Songs===

The majority of the album comprised standards of the trova and filin repertoire, namely sones, guajiras and boleros typically played by small guitar-led ensembles. A foremost example of the son tradition on the album was &quot;Chan Chan&quot;, the group&#x27;s signature tune and the album opener. Written in the 1980s, it was one of Compay Segundo&#x27;s most famous songs and one he had recorded several times, most notably with Eliades Ochoa and his Cuarteto Patria. The same formula was followed in this recording, with Ochoa singing lead and Segundo on second voice (as his artist name indicated). The song&#x27;s lyrics depicted a rural scene with two characters, Juanita and Chan Chan. &quot;Chan Chan&quot; was followed by &quot;De camino a la vereda&quot;, another son, written and sung by Ibrahim Ferrer.

Another example of the &quot;son cubano&quot; was Sergio González Siaba&#x27;s &quot;El cuarto de Tula&quot;, sung by Eliades Ochoa, with Ibrahim Ferrer and Manuel &quot;Puntillita&quot; Licea joining Ochoa in an extended descarga (jam) section improvising lyrics. Barbarito Torres played a frenetic laúd solo towards the end of the track. Timbales were played by 13-year-old Yulién Oviedo Sánchez. The song was featured in the 2001 film &quot;Training Day&quot;. &quot;Candela&quot; was another classic son, composed by Faustino Oramas &quot;El Guayabero&quot;. Its lyrics, rich with sexual innuendo, were sung by Ibrahim Ferrer, who improvised vocal lines throughout the track, and the whole ensemble performed an extended descarga.

Of the many boleros featured in the album, Isolina Carrillo&#x27;s &quot;Dos gardenias&quot; was perhaps the most famous, sung here by Ibrahim Ferrer. Carrillo wrote the song in 1945 and it became a huge success in Cuba and abroad. The song was chosen for the album after Cooder heard Ferrer and Rubén González improvising the melody before a recording session. Ferrer had learned the song while playing with Cuban bandleader Beny Moré. Another bolero, &quot;¿Y tú qué has hecho?&quot; was written by Eusebio Delfín in the 1920s and featured Compay Segundo on tres and vocals. Segundo was traditionally a &quot;second voice&quot; singer providing a baritone counterpoint harmony. On this recording he multitracked both voices. The song also featured a duet between Segundo on tres and Ry Cooder on guitar. &quot;Veinte años&quot;, also a bolero, was sung by the only female vocalist in the ensemble, Omara Portuondo, with Segundo on second vocals. It was recorded in one take after Omara had finished her own recording sessions at EGREM studios and was preparing to fly to Vietnam. Other boleros included were Rafael Ortiz&#x27;s &quot;Amor de loca juventud&quot;, Eliseo Silveira&#x27;s &quot;Orgullecida&quot; (both sung by Compay Segundo) and Electo Rosell&#x27;s &quot;Murmullo&quot; (sung by Ibrahim Ferrer, who used to be the lead vocalist in Rosell&#x27;s ensemble Orquesta Chepín-Chovén).

&quot;El carretero&quot;, a guajira (country lament), was sung by Eliades Ochoa with the full ensemble providing additional instruments and backing vocals. &quot;La bayamesa&quot;, a famous criolla by Sindo Garay, was the album closer with Puntillita, Compay Segundo and Ibrahim Ferrer on vocals.

Two tracks were included from the Cuban danzón repertoire, &quot;Pueblo Nuevo&quot; and &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;, both dedicated to locations in Havana. They were originally recorded by Arcaño y sus Maravillas and were composed by bass player Cachao (although &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; has been wrongly attributed to his brother Orestes López in the liner notes and by Cooder). The title track, highlighting the piano work of Rubén González, was recorded after Cooder heard González improvising around the tune&#x27;s musical theme before a day&#x27;s recording session. After playing the tune, González explained to Cooder the history of the social club and that the song was the club&#x27;s &quot;mascot tune&quot;. When searching for a name for the overall project, manager Nick Gold chose the song&#x27;s title. According to Cooder,It should be the thing that sets it apart. It was a kind of club by then. Everybody was hanging out and we had rum and coffee around two in the afternoon. It felt like a club, so let&#x27;s call it that. That&#x27;s what gave it a handle.

==Reception==

&quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; earned considerable critical praise from music writers and publications. In 2003, the album was ranked number 260 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, one of only two albums on the list to be produced in a non-English speaking country. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. 

The album was awarded the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album and Tropical/Salsa Album of the Year by a Group at the 1998 Billboard Latin Music Awards.

In 2022, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry.

In 2024, it was ranked in eleventh position on the “Los 600 de Latinoamérica” list compiled by a collective of music journalists from several countries of the Americas, curating the top 600 Latin American albums from 1920-2022.

<doc id="755314" wikidata="Q1789596" url="?curid=755314" title="Croatia in personal union with Hungary">
<text>The Kingdom of Croatia (; ; ), also known with full diplomatic name Kingdom of Croatia and Dalmatia (), entered a personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary in 1102, after a period of rule of kings from the Trpimirović and Svetoslavić dynasties and a succession crisis following the death of king Demetrius Zvonimir. With the coronation of King Coloman of Hungary as &quot;King of Croatia and Dalmatia&quot; in 1102 in Biograd, the realm passed to the Árpád dynasty until 1301, when the (male) line of the dynasty died out. Then, kings from the Capetian House of Anjou, who were also cognatic descendants of the Árpád kings, ruled the kingdoms. Later centuries were characterized by conflicts with the Mongols, who sacked Zagreb in 1242, competition with Venice for control over Dalmatian coastal cities, and internal warfare among Croatian nobility. Various individuals emerged during the period, such as Paul I Šubić of Bribir, who was representing the most powerful Croatian dynasty at the time, the Šubić noble family. These powerful individuals were on occasion able to de facto secure great deal of independence for their fiefdoms. The Ottoman incursion into Europe in the 16th century significantly reduced Croatian territories and left the country weak and divided. After the death of Louis II in 1526 during the Battle of Mohács and a brief period of dynastic dispute, both crowns passed to the Austrian House of Habsburg, and the realms became part of the Habsburg monarchy.

Some of the terms of Coloman&#x27;s coronation and the later status of the Croatian nobles are detailed in the Pacta Conventa, a document preserved only in transcript from the 14th century. The precise terms of this relationship became a matter of dispute in the 19th century; nonetheless, even in dynastic union with Hungary, institutions of separate Croatian statehood were maintained through the Sabor (an assembly of Croatian nobles) and the Ban (viceroy). In addition, the Croatian nobles retained their lands and titles.

==Name==
The diplomatic name of the kingdom was &quot;Kingdom of Croatia and Dalmatia&quot; () until 1359 when a plural form &quot;kingdoms&quot; () came into use. The change was a consequence of the victory of Louis I against the Republic of Venice and the Treaty of Zadar, by which the Venetian Republic lost its influence over Dalmatian coastal cities. However, the kingdom was still mostly referred to as the Kingdom of Croatia and Dalmatia until Venice regained the Dalmatian coast in 1409. A common synonym were &quot;Sclavonia&quot; (&quot;Slavonija&quot; and &quot;Slovinje&quot;) and &quot;tota Sclauonia&quot; (&quot;Whole&quot; Slavonia). The most common Croatian language form of the name was &quot;Hrvatska zemlja&quot; (&quot;Croatian country&quot; or &quot;Croatian land&quot;).

==Background==
===Succession crisis===

Demetrius Zvonimir was the King of Croatia of the Svetoslavić branch of the House of Trpimirović. He began as a Ban of Croatia in the service of Peter Krešimir IV. Peter probably declared him his heir and, in 1075, Demetrius Zvonimir succeeded to the Croatian throne. Zvonimir married Helen of Hungary from the Árpád dynasty in 1063. Helen was a Hungarian princess, daughter of Béla I, and sister to King Ladislaus I of Hungary. They had a son, Radovan, who died in his late teens or early twenties. After Zvonimir&#x27;s death in 1089, he was succeeded by Stephen II, last of the House of Trpimirović. Stephen&#x27;s rule was relatively ineffectual and lasted less than two years. He spent most of this time in the tranquility of the monastery of St. Stephen beneath the Pines () near Split. Stephen II died peacefully at the beginning of 1091, without leaving an heir. Since there was no living male member of the House of Trpimirović, civil war and unrest broke out in Croatia shortly afterward.

The widow of late King Zvonimir, Helen, tried to keep her power in Croatia during the succession crisis. Some Croatian nobles around Helen, possibly the Gusić family and/or Viniha from Lapčan family, contesting the succession after the death of Zvonimir, asked King Ladislaus I to help Helen and offered him the Croatian throne, which was seen as rightfully his by inheritance rights. According to some sources, several Dalmatian cities also asked King Ladislaus for assistance, and Petar Gusić with Petar &quot;de genere Cacautonem&quot; presented themselves as &quot;White Croats&quot; (&quot;Creates Albi&quot;), on his court. Thus the campaign launched by Ladislaus was not purely a foreign aggression nor did he appear on the Croatian throne as a conqueror, but rather as a successor by hereditary rights. In 1091 Ladislaus crossed the Drava river and conquered the entire province of Slavonia without encountering opposition, but his campaign was halted near the &quot;Iron Mountains&quot; (Mount Gvozd). Since the Croatian nobles were divided, Ladislaus had success in his campaign, yet he was not able to establish his control over entire Croatia, although the exact extent of his conquest is not known. At this time the Kingdom of Hungary was attacked by the Cumans, who were likely sent by Byzantium, so Ladislaus was forced to retreat from his campaign in Croatia. Ladislaus appointed his nephew Prince Álmos to administer the controlled area of Croatia, established the Diocese of Zagreb as a symbol of his new authority and went back to Hungary. In the midst of the war, Petar Snačić was elected king by Croatian feudal lords in 1093. Petar&#x27;s seat of power was based in Knin. His rule was marked by a struggle for control of the country with Álmos, who was not able to establish his rule and was forced to withdraw to Hungary in 1095.
Ladislaus died in 1095, leaving his nephew Coloman to continue the campaign. Coloman, as was the case with Ladislaus before him, was not seen as a conqueror but rather as a pretender to the Croatian throne. Coloman assembled a large army to press his claim on the throne and in 1097 defeated King Petar&#x27;s troops in the Battle of Gvozd Mountain, who was killed in battle. Since the Croatians did not have a leader any more and Dalmatia had numerous fortified towns that would be difficult to defeat, negotiations started between Coloman and the Croatian feudal lords. It took several more years before the Croatian nobility recognised Coloman as the king. Coloman was crowned in Biograd in 1102 and the title now claimed by Coloman was &quot;King of Hungary, Dalmatia, and Croatia&quot;. Some of the terms of his coronation are summarized in Pacta Conventa by which the representatives of the noble institution of twelve noble tribes of Croatia agreed to recognise Coloman as king. In return, the 12 Croatian nobles that signed the agreement retained their lands and properties and were granted exemption from tax or tributes. The nobles were to send at least ten armed horsemen each beyond the Drava River at the kings expense if his borders were attacked. Despite that Pacta Conventa is not an authentic document from 1102, there was almost certainly some kind of contract or agreement between the Croatian nobles and Coloman which regulated the relations in the same way.

===Historical and legal context===

In 1102, after a succession crisis, the crown passed into the hands of the Árpád dynasty, with the crowning of King Coloman of Hungary as &quot;King of Croatia and Dalmatia&quot; in Biograd. The precise terms of the union between the two realms became a matter of dispute in the 19th century. The two kingdoms were united under the Árpád dynasty either by the choice of the Croatian nobility or by Hungarian force. Croatian historians hold that the union was a personal one in the form of a shared king, a view also accepted by a number of Hungarian historians, while Serbian and Hungarian nationalist historians preferred to see it as a form of annexation. The claim of a Hungarian occupation was made in the 19th century during the Hungarian national reawakening. Thus in older Hungarian historiography Coloman&#x27;s coronation in Biograd was a subject of dispute and their stance was that Croatia was conquered. Although claims of this kind can also be found today, since the Croatian-Hungarian tensions are gone, it has generally been accepted that Coloman was crowned in Biograd for king. Today, Hungarian legal historians hold that the relationship of Hungary with the area of Croatia and Dalmatia in the period till 1526 and the death of Louis II was most similar to a personal union, resembling the relationship of Scotland to England.

According to the Worldmark Encyclopedia of Nations and the Grand Larousse encyclopédique, Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in 1102, which remained the basis of the Hungarian-Croatian relationship until 1918, while Encyclopædia Britannica specified the union as a dynastic one. According to the research of the Library of Congress, Coloman crushed opposition after the death of Ladislaus I and won the crown of Dalmatia and Croatia in 1102, thus forging a link between the Croatian and Hungarian crowns that lasted until the end of World War I. Hungarian culture permeated northern Croatia, the Croatian-Hungarian border shifted often, and at times Hungary treated Croatia as a vassal state. Croatia had its own local governor, or Ban; a privileged landowning nobility; and an assembly of nobles, the Sabor. According to some historians, Croatia became part of Hungary in the late 11th and early 12th century, yet the actual nature of the relationship is difficult to define. Sometimes Croatia acted as an independent agent and at other times as a vassal of Hungary. However, Croatia retained a large degree of internal independence. The degree of Croatian autonomy fluctuated throughout the centuries as did its borders.

The alleged agreement called &quot;Pacta conventa&quot; () or &quot;Qualiter&quot; (first word of the text) is today viewed as a 14th-century forgery by most modern Croatian historians. According to the document King Coloman and the twelve heads of the Croatian nobles made an agreement, in which Coloman recognised their autonomy and specific privileges. Although it is not an authentic document from 1102, nonetheless there was at least a non-written agreement that regulated the relations between Hungary and Croatia in approximately the same way, while the content of the alleged agreement is concordant with the reality of rule in Croatia in more than one respect.

In the Kingdom of Croatia also existed own &quot;consuetudines antiquae Croatorum&quot;, a customary law unique to the Croatian legal tradition compared to the Hungarian one (&quot;consuetudo Hungaricalis&quot;). Presumably the earliest mention of the term &quot;consuetudo Croatorum&quot; is from 1348 when Ivan of Stipko of Bribir (i.e. Šubić) in his will left part of his estate to the Franciscan monastery of St. Mary in Bribir &quot;despite the contrary Croatian custom, which forbids it&quot; (&quot;nec obstante consuetudine aliqua Chroatorum, qua prohibetur, ne quis suum Patrimonium aliis quam suis consaguineis vei propinquis alicui valeat dare&quot;). In 1361 the ban Nicholas Szécsi was ordered by king Louis I of Hungary &quot;to litigate according to the Hungarian customs and not the customs of the Croats and Dalmatians&quot; (&quot;non more aut secundum consuetudinem Croatorum an Dalmaticorum, sed iuxta legem et consuetudinem Hungaricalem iudicare deberemus&quot;). In 1376 gathered in Knin the &quot;antiqui homines parcium Crohacie&quot; (Croatian elders) to interpret the &quot;iura Crohatorum&quot; (Croat rights), and in the 15th century was legally used in the district of Šibenik (&quot;Sesubiecerat iurisdictioni Sibenicensi cum hoc quod gubernaretur secundum leges Croatiae&quot;). The Croatian legal customs were preserved by Venetian Republic in Dalmatia (since 1409), and were codified in the Vinodol Statute (13th century), Poljica Statute (14-15th century), Novigrad Statute (15th century), and Vrana Statute (15th century) among others. In the Kingdom of Croatia continued to be used both Croatian and Hungarian customary law until the early 16th century when was written &quot;Tripartitum&quot; (1514) by István Werbőczy, who also noted that the &quot;laws and legal customs (...) of the kingdoms of Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia and Transylvania differ in some provisions and articles from the laws and legal customs of our homeland i.e. this Kingdom of Hungary ... the Dalmatians, Croats, Slavonians and Transylvanians (...) in many legal customs use legal customs that differ greatly from ours&quot;.

The all aforementioned Croatian legal and noble institutions and privileges, and continous mention of the Kingdom of Croatia (and Dalmatia) and Croats in official documents, preserved and consolidated the existence of a separate pre-modern Croatian nation.

==Geography and administrative organization==

The Kingdom of Croatia was bounded to the west by the Dalmatian coast (from the headland of the Kvarner Gulf in the north to the mouth of the Neretva in the south), bounded to the east by the courses of the Vrbas and Neretva, to the south by the lower Neretva, and to the north by the Gvozd Mountain and river Kupa. The territory between Dalmatia and the Neretva, western Hum, was not always in Croatia&#x27;s possession. The term &quot;Dalmatia&quot; referred to several coastal cities and islands, at times used as a synonym of Croatia, and was to spread further inland only with the expansion of Venice in the 15th century. In the second half of the 15th and early 16th century borders of Croatia spread north and included the territory of the Zagreb county and its surroundings, that have already been under the same administration.

Croatia was ruled by a deputy for the king, a governor called a ban. After the succession of Emeric in 1196, his younger brother Andrew II became Duke of Croatia and Dalmatia in 1198, following a brief skirmish between them. Thus from 1198 Croatia and Slavonia were under the Dukes of Croatia, who ran their duchy, still known as the Kingdom of Croatia, as semi-independent rulers. Under the duke there also stood a ban who was usually a major nobleman, sometimes of Croatian origin and sometimes of Hungarian. A single ban governed all Croatian provinces until 1225 when the territory under ban&#x27;s rule was divided between two bans: the Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia and the Ban of Slavonia. The positions were intermittently held by the same person after 1345, and officially merged back into one by 1476. The territory of Croatia was divided into counties (), each under a count (&quot;župan&quot;). The Croatian counts were local nobles in hereditary succession ruling as they had before 1102, under the customary law of Croatia. In Church affairs, Croatia south of the Gvozd mountain was under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Split, while Slavonia was under the Archbishop of Kalocsa.

==History==

===Struggle with Venice and Byzantium===
By 1107 King Coloman controlled most of former Byzantine coastal cities in Dalmatia. Since those cities were important, Hungarians and Croats often fought with Venice and the Byzantines for the region. In 1116, after the death of Coloman, Venice attacked the Dalmatian coast, defeated the army of Croatian Ban Cledin and seized Biograd, Split, Trogir, Šibenik, Zadar and several islands. King Stephen II, Coloman&#x27;s successor, unsuccessfully tried to regain the lost cities in 1117, although the Doge of Venice Ordelafo Faliero was killed in a battle near Zadar. A five-year truce was signed, confirming the status quo. In 1124 Stephen II again attacked the Venetian holdings and regained Biograd, Split, Šibenik and Trogir, but Zadar and the islands remained under Venetian control. However, in 1125 Doge Domenico Michele reconquered those cities and razed Biograd. In 1131 Béla II succeeded to the throne and in 1133 won back the lost cities except Zadar. In 1167 a part of Croatia south of Krka River, as well as Bosnia, was conquered by the Byzantines and remained under their control until the death of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos in 1180, when the Byzantine Empire relinquished the acquired lands. After 1180 area under the administration of ban increased, but his domain and scope of activities were not yet fully formulated.

Following the death of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos the Byzantine Empire was no longer able to maintain its power consistently in Dalmatia. Soon Zadar rebelled against Venice and became a constant battleground until 1202 when, during the Fourth Crusade, the Venetians under Doge Enrico Dandolo and the Crusaders sacked Zadar (Zara), despite the fact that King Emeric pledged himself to join the Crusade. It was the first attack against a Catholic city by the Crusaders. Venice demanded this as a compensation for their transport further east towards Constantinople, where they later founded the Latin Empire. Hostilities with Venice continued until 1216 during the reign of King Andrew II, who used the Venetian fleet to join the Fifth Crusade.

===Feudalisation and relations between nobles===

In the 12th century, under the influence of the feudal system that flourished in medieval Europe and prevailed in Hungary and Croatia, a layer of powerful noble families was formed in Croatia. Those families were mostly descendants of the original twelve noble Croatian tribes. Nobility created by the monarchs or based upon royal service never existed in Croatia. Those nobles held and administered whole counties, presided over local courts and enforced their decisions, therefore local population was entirely separated from any state organisation. Most prominent Croatian noble families of the 12th and early 13th century were the Šubić (or Princes of Bribir), divided among various branches of the family and ruling over inland Dalmatia with their seat in Bribir; the Babonić in western Slavonia and along the right bank of the Kupa River; the Kačić between the Cetina and Neretva rivers with their seat in Omiš, known for practicing piracy; and the Frankopan (then known as the Princes of Krk), ruling over the island of Krk, Kvarner and the County of Modruš in northern Lika. Besides these main noble families, there were other less powerful ones, such as the families of Gusić (later with prominent branch Kurjaković), Kukar, Lapčan and Karinjan, Mogorović, and Tugomirić.
During this period and as result of the Second Crusade (1145–1149), the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller gained considerable property and assets in Croatia. The first grants in favor of the Christian orders were given by Bosnian Ban Borić. By the end of the 12th century the Templars had possessions in Vrana, Senj, Nova Ves near Zagreb, etc.

In 1221 a war broke out between Domald, who was then Prince of Split and Count of Cetina, and the Šubić family over the ownership of Split. Domald&#x27;s family ties are unknown, but he was probably from the Snačić or the Kačić family. Domald also held Šibenik and Klis fortress and briefly took Zadar from Venice in 1209. The citizens of Split expelled Domald in 1221 and elected Višan Šubić from Zvonigrad near Knin as their prince. Although the Šubić family was victorious, another war started among its members, Gregory III Šubić of Bribir and Višan. Gregory Šubić won, executed Višan and took his lands, thus securing supremacy in the Šubić family. Domald was still in possession of Klis and had ambitions to retake Split. In the course of the war Domald lost Klis and then allied himself with the Kačić family. In 1229 Domald managed to defeat Gregory&#x27;s deputy in Split and was re-elected as the prince of Split. However, by 1231 Gregory returned to his position in Split. After Gregory died Domald took advantage of the new situation and for the second time reclaimed Split in 1235, but lost it 2 years after to Gregory&#x27;s son Marko I Šubić of Bribir. War with Domald was finally over when Stjepko Šubić defeated and captured him in Klis.

Croatia and Slavonia remained decentralized under local nobles throughout the 13th century, unlike the Hungarian nobles that rebelled against King Andrew II. The King was forced to issue a golden bull in 1222 defining the rights of the Hungarian nobility and granting them privileges such as tax exemption and the right to disobey the King. The Croatian nobles already enjoyed most of the privileges that Andrew II granted.

===Mongol invasion===

During the rule of Béla IV the Mongols (or Tatars), having conquered Kyiv and south Rus, invaded Hungary in 1241. In the Battle of Mohi on the Sajó River on 11 April 1241 the Mongols wiped out the Hungarian army. Coloman, brother of King Béla, was severely wounded and was taken south to Croatia, where he died of his wounds. Batu Khan sent his cousin Kadan with an army of 10,000–20,000 to pursue King Béla, who fled to Croatia.

In 1242 the Mongols crossed the Drava river and started plundering the Slavonian counties of Požega and Križevci. They sacked the towns of Čazma and Zagreb, whose cathedral was burned. The nobility, together with King Béla, moved south to the fortress of Klis, Split, Trogir and the surrounding islands. In March 1242 the Mongols were near Split and started attacking Klis, since they thought King Béla, who was at the time in Trogir, was hiding there, but failed to capture its fortress.

Soon came the news of the death of Ögedei Khan in Karakorum. To be in on the action of electing a new khan, the Mongols turned back. One group returned east through Zeta, Serbia, and Bulgaria, all of which were looted as they passed through, while the second one plundered the area of Dubrovnik and burned the town of Kotor.

After the Mongols left Croatia its land were devastated and a huge famine broke out. The invasion of Mongols showed that only fortified cities could provide protection against them. Since the Mongols still held much of Eastern Europe, work began on the construction of defence systems, making new fortifications and reinforcing or repairing existing ones. The fortified town of Medvedgrad was built on the Medvednica mountain above Zagreb, as well as Garić, Lipovac, Okić, Kalnik, etc. On 16 November 1242 the king issued a Golden Bull to the citizens of Gradec (today part of Zagreb), by which it was proclaimed a free royal city. Nobles were allowed to build castles on their lands and increase the size of their armies, making them even more independent.

===13th century civil war===
The Mongol invasion temporarily stopped internal warfare among the nobles, but right after they left in the early 1240s a civil war broke out in Croatia. The cause of the war was the possession of Ostrog village, that both Split and Trogir claimed as theirs and which was in 1242 confirmed by King Béla IV to Trogir with a special charter. Trogir had the support of the King and the Šubić family, with Stjepko Šubić its leader, while Split found allies among the Kačić family, Andrew of Hum and Bosnian Ban Matej Ninoslav. In 1244 Split elected Ninoslav as its prince, and in the same year Ninoslav launched an attack on Trogir, but failed to take the city. After Ninoslav returned to Bosnia, a large army commanded by Slavonian Ban Denis Türje, Stjepko Šubić and Daniel Šubić was sent against Split, which immediately surrendered. Peace was signed on 19 July 1244. A second army led by King Béla IV breached into Bosnia and forced Ban Matej Ninoslav to sign a peace treaty on 20 July 1244. To prevent further wars among the Dalmatian coastal cities, King Béla IV transferred the election of their governors, that were previously done by cities themselves, to the Ban of Croatia. The Šubić family was dissatisfied with this decision, as they had previously governed most of the coastal cities.

The later kings sought to restore their influence by giving certain privileges to the towns, making them free royal cities, thus separating them from the authority of the local nobles. Varaždin acquired the status of a free city in 1220, Vukovar in 1231 and Virovitica in 1234 from King Andrew II. Petrinja gained that status in 1240, Gradec (excluding Kaptol, where the bishop of Zagreb resided, that was under its own administration) in 1242, Samobor in 1242, Križevci in 1252, and Jastrebarsko in 1257. Free cities elected their own councils, had their own administration and courts, collected their own taxes and managed their economies and trade.

However, local nobles continued to strengthen. The weakening of royal authority allowed the Šubić family to restore their former role in the coastal cities. In the 1270s they regained Trogir, Split and Šibenik. In 1274 Paul I Šubić of Bribir () became the head of the family and was soon named the Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia, while his brothers were princes of the leading Dalmatian cities, Mladen I Šubić of Split, and George I Šubić of Trogir and Šibenik. In 1280 Venice attacked the coastal holdings of the Kačić family and captured Omiš. Paul Šubić used the decline of the Kačići and seized the mainland holdings between the Neretva and Cetina rivers.

===Dynastic struggles and the Šubić family===

In 1290 King Ladislaus IV died, leaving no sons, and a war of succession broke out between Andrew III from the Árpád dynasty and Charles Martel of Anjou from the House of Anjou. Croatian Ban Paul Šubić and most of the Croatian nobility supported Charles Martel, while most of the Hungarian nobles supported Andrew III. The Babonić family was initially on the Anjou side, but soon came out for Andrew III. To retain Croatian support, father of Charles Martel, Charles II of Naples, awarded in the name of his son all lands from the Gvozd Mountain to the Neretva River hereditarily to Paul Šubić. The position of the ban was thus made hereditary for the Šubić family, while the local Croatian nobles became vassals of Paul and his descendants. In response Andrew III also issued a charter naming Paul a hereditary Croatian ban. As a result of this bidding for support and the absence of central power in the midst of a civil war, the Šubić family became the most powerful family in Croatia.

In Zagreb, the bishop&#x27;s town, Kaptol, supported Charles Martel, while Gradec supported Andrew, which led to bitter fighting in the area. After Charles Martel died in 1295 his rights to the throne passed to his son, Charles I (also known as Charles Robert). Croatian and Hungarian nobles eventually accepted Andrew III as King, but a new revolt started when in 1299 Andrew named his uncle, Albertino Morosini as heir, since he had no sons. Paul sent his brother, George I Šubić, to Rome to gain papal approval for their requests and bring Charles I to Croatia, where he arrived in August 1300. Andrew III died in January 1301 and brought the Árpád dynasty to an end. Ban Paul Šubić accompanied Charles I to Zagreb, where he was recognized as king. In March 1301 the Archbishop crowned him with a provisional crown King of Hungary and Croatia in Esztergom. So the act was not performed with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Székesfehérvár as it was required by custom.
The privileges that Paul Šubić gained during the succession crisis were confirmed and his family gained hereditary banship. Although the Croatian nobles recognized Charles I, a part of the Hungarian nobles refused to do so and opted for Wenceslaus, the son of Wenceslaus II, King of Bohemia, who was in 1301 crowned King of Hungary in Székesfehérvár. Civil war followed in Hungary, but it did not affect Croatia, which was under the firm authority of Paul Šubić. Earlier in 1299 Paul gained control over Bosnia, so his title was from then &quot;Ban of the Croats and Lord of Bosnia&quot; (). He gave his brother Mladen I Šubić the title of Ban of Bosnia. At that time the power of Paul extended from Gvozd to the Neretva, and from the Adriatic coast to the Bosna River, and only the city of Zadar remained outside his realm and under the rule of Venice. In 1304 Ban Mladen I was killed in Bosnia. Paul carried out a campaign against Bosnia to reaffirm his authority, bringing more of its lands under his rule, as Paul referred to himself from 1305 as &quot;lord of all Bosnia&quot; (). He appointed his second son, Mladen II, Ban of Bosnia, and in 1305 his third son, Paul II, became the Prince of Split.

Paul issued his own money and was for all practical purposes an independent ruler. In 1311 Paul triggered a successful rebellion in Zadar against Venetian rule. War with Venice continued after Paul&#x27;s death on 1 May 1312, who was succeeded by his son Mladen II. With Paul&#x27;s death began a gradual decline of the Bribir Princes. Venice eventually restored their rule in Zadar in 1313. In 1322 another civil war in Croatia started, culminating in the Battle of Bliska when Mladen II and his allies were defeated by a coalition of Croatian noblemen, including his brother Paul II, and coastal towns under the command of John Babonić, the Ban of Slavonia. A council in Knin was convened by the King where John Babonić was named Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia, ending the hereditary banship of the Šubić family. Their holdings were reduced and split between Mladen&#x27;s brothers. Paul II held Bribir and Ostrovica, while George II held Klis, Skradin and Omiš.
After the decline of the Šubić family, Ivan Nelipić had risen to become the dominant figure in Croatia. He seized the royal city of Knin, which led to the removal of John Babonić from his banship and the appointment of Nicholas Felsőlendvai and later Mikcs Ákos, whose army was defeated in 1326 by Ivan Nelipić. Thus all of Croatia from Lika and Krbava to the Cetina River was in fact outside the king&#x27;s authority. Nelipić had tense relations with the Šubići and had frequent conflicts with them. During these conflicts Venice took control over Split in 1327 and Nin in 1329, gaining most of the coast from Zrmanja River to the mouth of the Cetina. At the same time, Stephen II Kotromanić, Ban of Bosnia, annexed the territory between Cetina and Neretva, as well as Imotski, Duvno, Livno i Glamoč. Over the remainder of Croatia Ivan Nelipić ruled independently from Knin until his death in 1344. Following that Louis I restored royal power in Croatia and pacified the country by the end of 1345. Nicholas Hahót was the first appointed royal official in decades, who styled himself Ban of Slavonia, Croatia and Dalmatia, merging the two positions and extending his influence to the Croatian territories as well to represent the royal authority.

===Territorial changes in Dalmatia===

In 1345 Zadar again rebelled against Venice, but after a lengthy siege in late 1346 the Venetians regained the city. In retaliation for the rebellion Venice destroyed Zadar&#x27;s sea walls, confiscated weapons from its citizens and sent a Venetian to be the town&#x27;s governor. King Louis I signed an eight-year peace treaty with Venice in 1348. In 1356, after the end of the peace treaty, King Louis invaded Venetian territories without a former declaration of war. The Croatian army was led by Ban John Csúz of Ludbreg. Split, Trogir, and Šibenik soon got rid of the Venetian governors, while Zadar fell after a short siege. As Louis at the same time fought successfully in northern Italy, Venice was forced to sign the Treaty of Zadar on 18 February 1358.

With the Treaty King Louis gained power over the entire area of Dalmatia, from the island of Cres to Durrës in Albania, including Dubrovnik (Ragusa), which acted as an independent unit. The Doge of Venice had to renounce its title &quot;Duke of Croatia and Dalmatia&quot;. After this the entire Croatian territory was integrated under one administration and under the authority of the Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia. As a result, the economy of Croatia flourished in the late 14th century, especially in cities on the eastern Adriatic coast. New royal towns were established on trade routes, richer merchants&#x27; increased dominance over towns, and new conditions marked the beginning of cultural integration between coastal and continental Croatia.

===Anti-court movement===
Following the death of Louis I in 1382 his wife Elizabeth of Bosnia acted as regent of the eleven-year-old Queen Mary. Her accession was denied by some noblemen who considered that King Charles III of Naples was the lawful heir to the throne. In Croatia John of Palisna, prior of Vrana, was the first to rise against Elizabeth. He was mainly opposed to the centralizing policy which Elizabeth&#x27;s husband had enforced. He was accompanied by Tvrtko I of Bosnia, who was crowned as King of Bosnia in 1371. John was ultimately defeated by Elizabeth&#x27;s army that seized his town of Varna and forced him to flee to Bosnia. After a brief period of peace a new movement against Queen Mary and Elizabeth emerged in 1385 that was led by John Horvat, Ban of Macsó, and his brother Paul Horvat, Bishop of Zagreb.
The two brothers were joined by John of Palisna, who had been named Ban of Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia in 1385 by Charles III. They assisted Charles in deposing Queen Mary who renounced the crown without resistance in late 1385, but Elizabeth soon had him murdered in February 1386. The Horvat brothers rose up in open rebellion on behalf of the murdered king&#x27;s son, Ladislaus of Naples. On 25 July 1386 they attacked Queen Mary, Elizabeth and their retinue at Gorjani and captured the queens. Mary and her mother were imprisoned and held in captivity at the bishop of Zagreb&#x27;s castle of Gomnec.
Elizabeth and Mary were soon sent to Novigrad Castle, with John of Palisna as their new jailer. Elizabeth was tried and found guilty of inciting Charles&#x27; murder. In January 1387 Sigismund of Luxemburg, husband of Queen Mary, marched towards Novigrad to rescue the queens. When news of Sigismund&#x27;s approach reached Novigrad, Elizabeth was strangled in her prison in Mary&#x27;s presence. As the throne could no longer be left vacant, Sigismund was crowned king on 31 March 1387 at Székesfehérvár.

Sigismund&#x27;s ally Ivan V Frankopan laid siege to Novigrad Castle with the assistance of a Venetian fleet. They captured the castle on 4 June 1387 and released Mary from captivity. She remained Sigismund&#x27;s co-ruler until the end of her life, but her influence was minimal. In the meantime King Tvrtko I of Bosnia, an ally of the Horvat brothers, made them governors of Usora. The Horvat brothers were also aided by Grand Duke of Bosnia, Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić. Tvrtko and his allies managed to acquire most of Croatia and Dalmatia between 1387 and 1390, and all efforts of Sigismund to take these back ended in failure. In 1390 Tvrtko began to call himself &quot;King of Croatia and Dalmatia&quot; and awarded Hrvoje with acquired Dalmatian possessions. Tvrtko died in March 1391 and John of Palisna died a few weeks later. Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić was left the strongest nobleman in Bosnia after the death of King Tvrtko. Same year, Ladislaus appointed him as his deputy in Dalmatia, and also granted him a title of &quot;Duke of Split&quot;, later &quot;Herzog of Split&quot;, affirming his possessions on the islands of Brač, Hvar and Korčula. At the peak of his power Hrvoje was styled &quot;Grand Duke of Bosnia, Knyaz of Donji Kraji, Hezog of Split&quot;.
The situation changed in 1393, when Tvrtko&#x27;s successor, Stephen Dabiša, made peace with Sigismund. He returned Tvrtko&#x27;s recent acquisitions, but was allowed to keep the territories in
western Bosnia that had been conquered in 1385. Hrvoje Vukčić also submitted in 1393. In July 1394 Sigismund took Dobor in Bosnia and captured John Horvat, thus ending the uprising of the Horvats. On Queen Mary&#x27;s orders, as a revenge of her mother&#x27;s death, John was tortured to death in Pécs.

After the death of Stephen Dabiša his widow Jelena Gruba was elected as queen. Hrvoje Vukčić again actively opposed to Sigismund and proclaimed his support for Ladislaus of Naples. In an attempt to reconcile with the rebellious nobility, Sigismund summoned a council at Križevci in Croatia on 27 February 1397 to which Stephen II Lackfi, who was appointed by Ladislaus as his deputy for Croatia, was invited on a safe-conduct. At the gathering Lackfi, his nephew Andrew and the supporting nobility were murdered, which set off a new uprising in the name of Ladislaus. This uprising was led by Hrvoje Vukčić, who took a very active role and was able to extend his own authority. The council of Križevci later became known as the &quot;Bloody Sabor of Križevci&quot;.

Sigismund had an unsuccessful campaign against the Kingdom of Bosnia in 1398, after which new Bosnian King Stephen Ostoja and Hrvoje moved onto the offensive. Zadar submitted to Hrvoje in 1401 and with the help of Ivaniš Nelipčić, who controlled most of the Cetina county, Hrvoje gained control over Split in 1403. During these years Sigismund lost support from the Frankopans, but retained the loyalty of Kurjakovići (branch of Gusić&#x27;s), the Berislavići and the princes of Zrin. However, Ladislaus&#x27; passivity and hesitation to move towards Buda distressed his followers, so Sigismund offered an amnesty to all those who had opposed him. Many Hungarian and Croatian nobles, including the Frankopans, accepted it and sided with Sigismund.

Due to a conflict with Hrvoje Vukčić, Bosnian nobility ousted Stephen Ostoja in 1404 and put on the throne Tvrtko II who reigned as Hrvoje&#x27;s puppet king. Ostoja fled to Hungary and sided with Sigismund. Hrvoje was able to withstand several Sigismund&#x27;s military interventions until 1408 when the Bosnian nobility was severely defeated in the Battle of Dobor. In January 1409 it was announced that Hrvoje had submitted to Sigismund and that Ostoja was restored to the Bosnian throne. By this Sigismund had put an end to the unrest in Hungary, Bosnia and Croatia. Eventually in 1409 Ladislaus sold his rights in Dalmatia to Venice for 100,000 ducats in an attempt to gain allies in the upcoming war against the Republic of Florence.

===Ottoman wars===


After the conquest of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 the Ottomans quickly expanded westward and also threatened the Kingdom of Croatia. Following the fall of the Kingdom of Bosnia in 1463, King Matthias Corvinus strengthened the defense system by establishing the Banate of Jajce and Banate of Srebrenik. Although the Ottomans had trouble in breaching the defense lines, they regularly conducted plundering raids into Croatia and southern Hungary. During one such raid in 1463 Croatian Ban Pavao Špirančić was captured in Senj. The Ottoman Empire quickly expanded to the southern areas, where they conquered large parts of Herzegovina in 1482 and Croatian strongholds in the Neretva valley.

First major Croatian victory over the Ottomans was achieved by Count Petar Zrinski in 1478 near Glina. In 1483 an army led by Croatian Ban Matthias Geréb and the Frankopans defeated a force of around 7,000 Ottoman cavalry (known as the Akıncı) at the Battle of Una River crossing near modern-day Novi Grad. The same year a peace treaty was signed that spared Croatia from larger Ottoman raids. Local conflicts on the border did continue, but with lesser intensity.

The truce ended with the death of Matthias Corvinus in 1490. 10,000 Ottoman light cavalrymen crossed the Una River in 1491 and advanced into Carniola. On their way back they were defeated in the Battle of Vrpile. 2 years later a war started between the new Ban of Croatia, Emerik Derenčin, and the Frankopan family. The Frankopans were initially more successful and started to besiege the town of Senj, but the siege was lifted after an army led by Ban Derenčin was sent against them. However, the incoming Ottoman army led by Hadim Yakup Pasha (bey of the Sanjak of Bosnia), that was returning from a raid in Carniola through Croatia, forced them to make peace. Croatian nobles gathered around 10,000 men and decided to face them in an open battle, although some insisted that an ambush would be a better option. on 9 September 1493 the Croatian army intercepted Ottoman forces near Udbina in Lika and suffered a huge defeat in the Battle of Krbava Field. Although the defeat was heavy, the Ottoman Empire had no territorial gains as a result of it. Croatian population from the war-affected areas gradually started to move into safer parts of the country, while some refugees fled outside Croatia to Burgenland, Southern Hungary and the Italian coast.

On 16 August 1513 Ban Petar Berislavić defeated an Ottoman army of 7,000 men at the battle of Dubica on the Una river. In February 1514 the Ottomans besieged Knin with 10,000 men, burned the town&#x27;s outskirts, but failed to capture it and lost 500 troops. Pope Leo X called Croatia the &quot;forefront of Christianity (Antemurale Christianitatis)&quot; in 1519, given that several Croatian soldiers made significant contributions to the struggle against the Ottoman Empire. Petar Berislavić spent 7 years in constant fighting with the Ottomans, faced with continuous money shortages and an insufficient number of troops, until he was killed in an ambush during the battle of Plješevica on 20 May 1520. After two failed attempts in 1513 and 1514, Ottoman forces led by Gazi Husrev-beg laid the final siege of Knin and captured it on 29 May 1522. They also besieged Klis on several occasions, but the captain of Senj and prince of Klis Petar Kružić defended the Klis Fortress for almost 25 years.

On 23 April 1526 Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent left Istanbul with 80,000 regular troops and a crowd of irregular auxiliaries, beginning his invasion of Hungary. He reached the Sava on 2 July, took Petrovaradin on 27 July after a two-week siege, and Ilok on 8 August. By 23 August his troops had crossed the Drava at Osijek without meeting resistance. On the same day King Louis II arrived at Mohács with about 25,000. Count Christopher Frankopan&#x27;s 5,000 men-strong army did not arrive to the battlefield in time. The Hungarian army waited for the Ottomans on the plain south of Mohács on 29 August and was routed in less than two hours. The 1526 Battle of Mohács was a crucial event in which the rule of the Jagiellon dynasty was shattered by the death of King Louis II. The defeat emphasized the overall inability of the Christian feudal military to halt the Ottomans, who would remain a major threat for centuries.

==1527 Parliament of Cetin==
Louis II had held the crown of Croatia among other titles, but left no heir. At the session on 10 November 1526, the majority of the Hungarian Diet chose John Zápolya to be the king, while a separate Hungarian assembly elected Archduke Ferdinand I in the rump diet in Pozsony on 16 December 1526. The Austrian Archduke was interested in the Croatian election in order to oppose Zápolya, promising at the same time to protect Croatia in turbulent period of Ottoman expansion to the west. The Croatian nobles met on 31 December 1526 to discuss their strategy and choose a new leader. The assembly occurred in the Franciscan monastery below the Cetin Castle in the settlement of Cetingrad. The Croatian parliament unanimously elected Ferdinand of the House of Habsburg as King of Croatia at their assembly in Cetin on 1 January 1527. The charter electing Ferdinand was confirmed with the seals of six Croatian nobles and four representatives of the Archduke. On 6 January 1527 the nobility from Slavonia sided with John Zápolya.

The Croatian historical narrative insists that the decision to join the Habsburg Empire was the result of a free choice made by the Sabor. Austrian historians align with this view and there appears to be little reason to doubt Croatian claims about the events of 1526. The political situation after the battle of Mohács – the king&#x27;s death, two elected rulers, Ottoman conquests and, consequently, the splitting of Hungary into three parts, changed the entire medieval relation system. Civil war broke out between the supporters of Ferdinand and Zápolya that ended soon in an agreement to Ferdinand&#x27;s benefit and both crowns would again be united in Habsburgs&#x27; hands. While this technically meant the restoration of a Croatian-Hungarian union, the relationship between two countries was changed permanently.

==Coat of arms==

Since the 13th century the modern-day coat of arms of Dalmatia, three crowned lion heads on blue shield (originally on red shield), was used to represent the Kingdom of Croatia, as mentioned in numerous armorials of the time (Gelre Armorial, Constance Council Armorial or Wernigerode Armorial). It was also located on coins and seals of the kings, like the great seal of Matthias Corvinus and on the great coat of arms of King Louis I. The &quot;checkerboard&quot; coat or arms came to, initially decorative, in use in the late 15th century by the Habsburg dynasty, and since the 1527 election in Cetin became the official coat of arms of Croatia. It mostly consisted of five rows of five interlocking silver and red squares.

<text>Apéritifs (; ) and digestifs () are drinks, typically alcoholic, that are normally served respectively before and after a meal.

==Apéritif==

An apéritif is an alcoholic beverage usually served before a meal to stimulate the appetite, and is usually dry rather than sweet. Common choices for an apéritif are vermouth; champagne; pastis; gin; ouzo; fino; amontillado or other styles of dry sherry (but not usually cream or oloroso blended sherry, which is very sweet and rich). 

An apéritif may be served with an hors d&#x27;oeuvre or amuse-bouche, such as crackers, cheese, pâté, quiche or olives.

Apéritif is a French word derived from the Latin verb , which means &quot;to open&quot;. The French colloquial word for apéritif is &quot;&quot;.

===History===
Apéritifs have existed since at least the fifth century as evidenced by the statement in Philokalia &quot;People who wish to discipline the sexual organs should avoid drinking those artificial concoctions which are called &#x27;aperitifs&#x27;—presumably because they open a way to the stomach for the vast meal which is to follow.&quot;

In 1796, Turin distiller Antonio Carpano invented modern vermouth. 

Apéritifs became widespread in 19th century Italy, where they were being served in fashionable cafés in Turin (where modern vermouth was created), Rome, Genoa, Florence, Milan and Venice. 

An apéritif known as Dubonnet was introduced in France in 1846, created by chemist Joseph Dubonnet as a means of delivering malaria-fighting quinine. The medicine was a bitter brew, so he developed a formula of herbs and spices to mask quinine&#x27;s sharp flavor, and it worked so well that the recipe has remained well-guarded ever since. French Foreign Legion soldiers made use of it in mosquito-infested Northern Africa. Dubonnet&#x27;s wife was so fond of the drink that she had all her friends try it, and its popularity spread.

Apéritifs became very popular in Europe, an appeal that crossed the Atlantic; by 1900 they were also commonly served in the United States.

In Spain and in some countries of Latin America apéritifs have been a staple of tapas for centuries.. The custom of having appetizers with an apéritif crossed the Atlantic in the opposite direction in the 1970s, where the habit of a substantial food offering being paired with the purchase of a drink during happy hour in the United States pushed the development of a more food-heavy aperitivo course in Italy as well.

===Types===
There is no single alcoholic drink that is always served as an apéritif. Fortified wine, liqueur, and dry champagne are probably the most common choices. Because it is served before dining, the emphasis is usually on dry rather than sweet, as a general guideline.
* In France, the apéritif varies from region to region: pastis is popular in the south of France, Calvados brandy in the Normandy region, Crémant d&#x27;Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne wine or cognac may also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and very popular apéritif-cocktail made with a measure of crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine like bourgogne aligoté. The word &quot;Kir Royal&quot; is used when white wine is replaced with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches.
* In Italy, vermouth or wine may be served as the apéritif (called &quot;aperitivo&quot;). Martini, Aperol Spritz and Campari with soda are also popular aperitivo drinks of choice.
* In the Eastern Mediterranean, arak is served with &quot;meze&quot;.
* In Britain and Ireland sherry and dry Madeira are traditional apéritifs.

==Digestif==

A digestif is an alcoholic beverage served after a meal, traditionally believed to aid digestion even though there is not strong evidence to support this. When served after a coffee course, it may be called &quot;pousse-café&quot;. Digestifs are usually taken neat.

Common kinds of digestif include: 
* Brandy (cognac, Armagnac, alembic-made) 
** Chacha
** &quot;Eau de vie&quot; (fruit brandies, schnapps, Calvados)
** Pomace brandy (grappa)
** Tsikoudia
** Orujo
* Fortified wines (sweet sherry (usually cream or oloroso sherry), Vermouth, port, Madeira, and ratafia)
* Liqueurs bitter or sweet (Drambuie, amaretto, Bénédictine, amari (such as fernet), herbal liqueur, sambuca, Chartreuse, Galliano, Grand Marnier, Jägermeister, Irish Mist, Kahlúa, limoncello, Herbs de Majorca, Beirão, pelinkovac, Unicum, Underberg, Fernet-Branca, mirto, Jeppson&#x27;s Malört)
* Distilled liquors (ouzo, schnapps, tequila or akvavit)
* Liquor cocktails (Black Russian, Rusty nail, etc.)

Bitter digestifs typically contain carminative herbs, with the intention of aiding digestion.

In many countries, people drink alcoholic beverages at lunch and dinner. Studies have found that when food is eaten before drinking alcohol, alcohol absorption is reduced and the rate at which alcohol is eliminated from the blood is increased. The mechanism for the faster alcohol elimination appears to be unrelated to the type of food. The mechanism is likely food-induced, which increases alcohol-metabolizing enzymes and liver blood flow.

<doc id="755329" wikidata="Q6918890" url="?curid=755329" title="Moufang loop">
<text>In mathematics, a Moufang loop is a special kind of algebraic structure. It is similar to a group in many ways but need not be associative. Moufang loops were introduced by . Smooth Moufang loops have an associated algebra, the Malcev algebra, similar in some ways to how a Lie group has an associated Lie algebra.

==Definition==
A Moufang loop is a loop formula_1 that satisfies the four following equivalent identities for all formula_2, formula_3, formula_4 in formula_1 (the binary operation in formula_1 is denoted by juxtaposition):
#formula_7
#formula_8
#formula_9
#formula_10

These identities are known as Moufang identities.

==Examples==
* Any group is an associative loop and therefore a Moufang loop.
* The nonzero octonions form a nonassociative Moufang loop under octonion multiplication.
* The subset of unit norm octonions (forming a 7-sphere in O) is closed under multiplication and therefore forms a Moufang loop.
* The subset of unit norm integral octonions is a finite Moufang loop of order 240.
* The basis octonions and their additive inverses form a finite Moufang loop of order 16.
* The set of invertible split-octonions forms a nonassociative Moufang loop, as does the set of unit norm split-octonions. More generally, the set of invertible elements in any octonion algebra over a field &quot;F&quot; forms a Moufang loop, as does the subset of unit norm elements.
* The set of all invertible elements in an alternative ring &quot;R&quot; forms a Moufang loop called the loop of units in &quot;R&quot;.
* For any field &quot;F&quot; let &quot;M&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) denote the Moufang loop of unit norm elements in the (unique) split-octonion algebra over &quot;F&quot;. Let &quot;Z&quot; denote the center of &quot;M&quot;(&quot;F&quot;). If the characteristic of &quot;F&quot; is 2 then &quot;Z&quot; = {&quot;e&quot;}, otherwise &quot;Z&quot; = {±&quot;e&quot;}. The Paige loop over &quot;F&quot; is the loop &quot;M&quot;*(&quot;F&quot;) = &quot;M&quot;(&quot;F&quot;)/&quot;Z&quot;. Paige loops are nonassociative simple Moufang loops. All &quot;finite&quot; nonassociative simple Moufang loops are Paige loops over finite fields. The smallest Paige loop &quot;M&quot;*(2) has order 120.
*A large class of nonassociative Moufang loops can be constructed as follows. Let be an arbitrary group. Define a new element not in and let . The product in is given by the usual product of elements in together with:formula_11formula_12formula_13formula_14It follows that formula_15 and formula_16. With the above product is a Moufang loop. It is associative if and only if is abelian.
*The smallest nonassociative Moufang loop is &quot;M&quot;(&quot;S&quot;3, 2) which has order 12.
*Richard A. Parker constructed a Moufang loop of order 213, which was used by Conway in his construction of the monster group. Parker&#x27;s loop has a center of order 2 with elements denoted by 1, −1, and the quotient by the center is an elementary abelian group of order 212, identified with the binary Golay code. The loop is then defined up to isomorphism by the equations
*:&quot;A&quot;2 = (−1)|&quot;A&quot;|/4
*:&quot;BA&quot; = (−1)|&quot;A&quot;∩&quot;B&quot;|/2&quot;AB&quot;
*:&quot;A&quot;(&quot;BC&quot;)= (−1)|&quot;A&quot;∩&quot;B&quot;∩&quot;C&quot;|(&quot;AB&quot;)&quot;C&quot;
:where |&quot;A&quot;| is the number of elements of the code word &quot;A&quot;, and so on. For more details see Conway, J. H.; Curtis, R. T.; Norton, S. P.; Parker, R. A.; and Wilson, R. A.: &quot;Atlas of Finite Groups: Maximal Subgroups and Ordinary Characters for Simple Groups.&quot; Oxford, England.

==Properties==
===Associativity===
Moufang loops differ from groups in that they need not be associative. A Moufang loop that is associative is a group. The Moufang identities may be viewed as weaker forms of associativity.

By setting various elements to the identity, the Moufang identities imply
*&quot;x&quot;(&quot;xy&quot;) = (&quot;xx&quot;)&quot;y&quot; left alternative identity
*(&quot;xy&quot;)&quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot;(&quot;yy&quot;) right alternative identity
*&quot;x&quot;(&quot;yx&quot;) = (&quot;xy&quot;)&quot;x&quot; flexible identity (see flexible algebra and alternative algebra).

Moufang&#x27;s theorem states that when three elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; in a Moufang loop obey the associative law: (&quot;xy&quot;)&quot;z&quot; = &quot;x&quot;(&quot;yz&quot;) then they generate an associative subloop; that is, a group. A corollary of this is that all Moufang loops are &quot;di-associative&quot; (i.e. the subloop generated by any two elements of a Moufang loop is associative and therefore a group). In particular, Moufang loops are power associative, so that powers &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; are well-defined. When working with Moufang loops, it is common to drop the parenthesis in expressions with only two distinct elements. For example, the Moufang identities may be written unambiguously as
#&quot;z&quot;(&quot;x&quot;(&quot;zy&quot;)) = (&quot;zxz&quot;)&quot;y&quot;
#((&quot;xz&quot;)&quot;y&quot;)&quot;z&quot; = &quot;x&quot;(&quot;zyz&quot;)
#(&quot;zx&quot;)(&quot;yz&quot;) = &quot;z&quot;(&quot;xy&quot;)&quot;z&quot;.

===Left and right multiplication===

The Moufang identities can be written in terms of the left and right multiplication operators on &quot;Q&quot;. The first two identities state that
*formula_17
*formula_18
while the third identity says
*formula_19
for all formula_20 in formula_1. Here formula_22 is bimultiplication by formula_4. The third Moufang identity is therefore equivalent to the statement that the triple formula_24 is an autotopy of formula_1 for all formula_4 in formula_1.

===Inverse properties===
All Moufang loops have the inverse property, which means that each element &quot;x&quot; has a two-sided inverse &quot;x&quot;−1 that satisfies the identities:
:formula_28
for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. It follows that formula_29 and formula_30 if and only if formula_31.

Moufang loops are universal among inverse property loops; that is, a loop &quot;Q&quot; is a Moufang loop if and only if every loop isotope of &quot;Q&quot; has the inverse property. It follows that every loop isotope of a Moufang loop is a Moufang loop.

One can use inverses to rewrite the left and right Moufang identities in a more useful form:
*formula_32
*formula_33

===Lagrange property===

A finite loop &quot;Q&quot; is said to have the &quot;Lagrange property&quot; if the order of every subloop of &quot;Q&quot; divides the order of &quot;Q&quot;. Lagrange&#x27;s theorem in group theory states that every finite group has the Lagrange property. It was an open question for many years whether or not finite Moufang loops had Lagrange property. The question was finally resolved by Alexander Grishkov and Andrei Zavarnitsine, and independently by Stephen Gagola III and Jonathan Hall, in 2003: Every finite Moufang loop does have the Lagrange property. More results for the theory of finite groups have been generalized to Moufang loops by Stephen Gagola III in recent years.

===Moufang quasigroups===

Any quasigroup satisfying one of the Moufang identities must, in fact, have an identity element and therefore be a Moufang loop. We give a proof here for the third identity:
:Let &quot;a&quot; be any element of &quot;Q&quot;, and let &quot;e&quot; be the unique element such that &quot;ae&quot; = &quot;a&quot;.
:Then for any &quot;x&quot; in &quot;Q&quot;, (&quot;xa&quot;)&quot;x&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;(&quot;ae&quot;))&quot;x&quot; = (&quot;xa&quot;)(&quot;ex&quot;).
:Cancelling &quot;xa&quot; on the left gives &quot;x&quot; = &quot;ex&quot; so that &quot;e&quot; is a left identity element.
:Now for any &quot;y&quot; in &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;ye&quot; = (&quot;ey&quot;)(&quot;ee&quot;) =(&quot;e&quot;(&quot;ye&quot;))&quot;e&quot; = (&quot;ye&quot;)&quot;e&quot;.
:Cancelling &quot;e&quot; on the right gives &quot;y&quot; = &quot;ye&quot;, so &quot;e&quot; is also a right identity element.
:Therefore, &quot;e&quot; is a two-sided identity element.

The proofs for the first two identities are somewhat more difficult (Kunen 1996).

==Open problems==

Phillips&#x27; problem is an open problem in the theory presented by J. D. Phillips at Loops &#x27;03 in Prague. It asks whether there exists a finite Moufang loop of odd order with a trivial nucleus.

Recall that the nucleus of a loop (or more generally a quasigroup) is the set of formula_2 such that formula_35, formula_36 and formula_37 hold for all formula_38 in the loop.

<doc id="755336" wikidata="Q360802" url="?curid=755336" title="Waltham Watch Company">
<text>The Waltham Watch Company, also known as the American Waltham Watch Co. and the American Watch Co., was a company that produced about 40 million watches, clocks, speedometers, compasses, time delay fuses, and other precision instruments in the United States of America between 1850 and 1957. The company&#x27;s historic 19th-century manufacturing facilities in Waltham, Massachusetts have been preserved as the American Waltham Watch Company Historic District.

The company went through a series of bankruptcies and restarts under new ownership, with watches and clocks bearing the Waltham name still being made and marketed today.

==History==
===The early years, 1849 to 1857===

Prior to 1850, watches in America were generally supplied either from England or Switzerland. The idea for the Waltham Watch Company came from watchmaker Aaron Lufkin Dennison. Dennison was the son of a shoemaker, born in Maine in 1812. He served as an apprentice to a jeweler for three years as a youth and had come to Boston in 1833. In 1833 he became a journeyman watchmaker with the firm of Currier &amp; Trott in Boston, leaving in 1839 to go into business for himself.

Mass production of clocks had come on line during the first quarter of the 19th century in the United States, moving from a handicraft to a factory basis; the forward-thinking Dennison hoped to apply the same principles and techniques to the making of pocket watches. This would not be his first venture, however. In 1844 Dennison started the firm that would later emerge as the Dennison Manufacturing Company, a paper box business. He found this enterprise distracted him from his dream of industrial production of watches and turned the company over to brother Eliphalet Dennison in 1849 so that he could turn his full attention to horology.

In 1849, Dennison approached Edward Howard, a clock and scale maker from Boston. Howard initially wanted to build locomotives but instead went into business with Dennison making watches. Joining Dennison and Howard in establishment of the company were fellow Bostonians David P. Davis, experienced in manufacturing, and financial angel Samuel Curtis. Initial funding of $20,000 was raised and the American Horologe Company was born. The name was quickly changed to Warren Manufacturing

Dennison, paid $1,200 a year to head the project, was sent to Great Britain by his partners to learn trade secrets and purchase supplies for the American effort. Dennison observed that the watch industry in England was not highly mechanized and believed the new American firm by he and his partners could make an impact in the watch industry.

The company began with construction of a 100-foot long brick building on land in Roxbury, Massachusetts already owned by partners Howard and Davis. Specialized machinery was designed and the flow of daily operations perfected. &quot;The firm attracted an able staff well versed in the field of watchmaking and willing to experiment with new methods,&quot; one historian of the firm later observed. Both Swiss and American watchmakers were employed.

The company&#x27;s first offering, an innovative model which ran for eight days without winding, was a commercial failure, being too expensive to make economically, with about 19 pieces produced. A second, more conventional model with a 36-hour power reserve was put into production and met with success in the marketplace.

In 1853 the name of the company was changed to the Boston Watch Company.

The Roxbury factory was soon deemed to be too small for efficient mass production. Dennison sought a rural locale for the new facility and the town of Waltham, Massachusetts was chosen. Local residents contributed funds for land and improvements through a development company established by Dennison, the Waltham Improvement Company. One hundred acres of land were purchased and a building constructed, with operations commencing in 1854. There were 90 workers at the factory at the time of its inception, with total output of 30 watches per week.

The economics of production on this scale proved untenable. To cover the deficit in watch company operations in 1856 $6,000 in notes guaranteed by the Waltham Improvement Company were issued. The situation further deteriorated with the coming of an economic crisis in the third quarter of 1856. As the economy stalled, Waltham&#x27;s watch sales plummeted. The partners contributed their personal savings in an effort to save the company, with an additional $20,000 raised by selling exclusive selling rights to Waltham watches to a large wholesale jeweler in New York City. This effort was insufficient and at the end of February 1857 the Waltham Improvement Company foreclosed on the mortgage it held for the Waltham factory. Assets were distributed in a sheriff&#x27;s auction, with the Waltham property purchased by Royal E. Robbins for $56,000.

Although founder Dennison remained as superintendent of the Waltham facility until 1862, the initial phase of the Waltham Watch Company had come to an end.

===The Civil War period, 1857 to 1865===

New owner Royal Robbins was an experienced New York watch importer who worked a partnership with his brother Henry Asher Robbins and Daniel F. Appleton in an effort to make the Waltham Watch operation a success. All three members of this troika had extensive experience in the watch sales and the jewelry trade. Administration of the company was measured and prudent and the economic crisis of 1857 was survived.

With the coming of the American Civil War in 1861, the demand for watches expanded markedly, with soldiers in particular eager to obtain a reasonably-priced timepiece for their personal use. To meet this demand, Waltham Watch unveiled a comparatively inexpensive $13 model called the &quot;William Ellery.&quot; This watch was a &quot;fad&quot; among Union soldiers and sales blossomed. By the end of the Civil War the Ellery represented fully 45 percent of Waltham&#x27;s annual sales.

===The Period of Growth, 1866 to 1906===
After the Civil War, the company became the main supplier of railroad chronometers to various railroads in North America and other countries. In 1876, the company showed off the first automatic screw making machinery and was awarded the first gold medal in a watch precision contest at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition.

In 1885, the company name changed to the American Waltham Watch Company (AWWCo).

===Decline, diversification, and restructuring, 1907 to 1922===
Waltham&#x27;s profitability was greatly impacted by the Panic of 1907, which brought a rapid fall of sales and earnings. This downturn not only did not abate but actually accelerated in 1908 and 1909, leading the sons of Royal Robbins to liquidate their holdings in the company as quietly as possible, with the brothers selling nearly all of the Waltham stock which they had inherited from their father. Stockholders became aggrieved by the company&#x27;s flagging fortunes and voted to terminate an existing sales relationship with the company Robbins &amp; Appleton, an independently owned wholesale arm which contracted to dispose of the entire output of Waltham on a 6% commission. Four longtime members of the company&#x27;s board of directors resigned and new directors appointed.

Board member Augustus P. Loring became the effective leader of Waltham&#x27;s majority shareholders in 1910. In an economizing measure a vice-presidential position was cut and executive pay generally reduced by the new board majority. A further effort was made to infuse new blood into Waltham&#x27;s management corps in an effort to break up a privileged and lethargic executive bureaucracy, although this change was met with only limited success.

The company attempted to diversify its output. Seeing a great demand in Europe as a result of the outbreak of World War I, Waltham introduced production of mechanized time fuses to control the burst of artillery shells in 1915, as well as automobile speedometers in 1916 and blood pressure gauges in 1917. Wholesale sales were taken in-house rather than being contracted out.

Waltham found itself pouring time and effort into the task of developing and improving a timing device which could absorb the shock of being fired from heavy artillery and its ability to design and manufacture conventional timepieces consequently suffered. By 1917 the American economy was booming, demand for watches was high, but Waltham was operating at full capacity, with the United States War Department calling for increased production of artillery fuses. Other American watchmakers were content limiting themselves to production of ordinary chronometers; with no experience making artillery fuses, contracts and production fell overwhelming upon Waltham&#x27;s shoulders.

In the short term, Waltham prospered through its emphasis on military contracts, with sales nearly doubling between 1915 and 1918 and earnings soaring by 156%. However the easy money of military contracts papered over what one historian has characterized as an era of &quot;wanton extravagance, gross inefficiency, and a marked lack of business foresight.&quot; With the end of the war came the Depression of 1920–1921, drying up military and consumer sales alike.

Waltham was a bloated behemoth, divided into watertight departments operated with a minimal eye to coordination and cooperation. A panel of consultants employed by management were shocked to discover 25 rival departments within the company, with &quot;each foreman operating his department as though it were a plant in itself,&quot; determining its own production and hiring its own personnel. The company was massively overstaffed, with the consulting engineers indicating that 4,000 people were currently employed to do the work that 2,000 efficiently used workers were capable of achieving. Unsold inventory ballooned to $11 million, while the company racked up $8 million in debt, while being forced to pay dividends on a substantial quantity of stock.

With the coming of price deflation in 1921, banks tightened their credit policies. Lending banks came to realize that Waltham&#x27;s loans were not adequately covered by current assets. Information about Waltham&#x27;s inefficient model of organization also undermined lender confidence. Waltham&#x27;s external financiers worried that shutting off credit entirely might force Waltham into liquidation and default upon their original loans. A period of negotiation was begun, in which lenders successfully demanded that Waltham&#x27;s management be brought under their own direct control.

Regarding Waltham&#x27;s management as incompetent, the First National Bank of Boston and other creditors took effective control of the company late in 1921, selecting one of their own directors, Gifford K. Simonds of Fitchburg, Massachusetts as new chief executive officer. The manager of a mid-sized family-owned sawmill for a decade, Simonds threw himself into learning the watch business, visiting every part of the plant and working three months behind a retail counter to learn about consumer preferences and expectations.

Fighting for freedom of action against entrenched interest groups, including bankers, stockholders, managers, and workers, Simonds sought to instill discipline, speed up the production process, and lay off superfluous workers, cutting payroll by 1,000. He believed that unsold inventory was severely overvalued on the company&#x27;s books, leading to a write-down assets by $3 million and a dumping unsold inventory on the market. Cutting benefits and speeding up production norms, Simonds managed to reduce the production cost by 25% and to eliminate $800,000 of the company&#x27;s debt by January 1923. This proved insufficient for troubled lenders, however, and in February 1923 creditors had found a new underwriter and Simonds&#x27; brief tenure drew to a close.

===The wristwatch era, 1923 to 1940===

Waltham was reorganized in 1923 by a syndicate headed by the investment firm of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. Kidder, Peabody drove a hard bargain, forcing through a two-tiered financial overhaul in which large investors able to contribute new money for the purchase of preferred stock were able to convert old common stock for newly issued common stock at the rate of 10 shares for 9. These monied investors were also able to convert their old interest-bearing preferred stock to new at the rate of 10 shares for 8. Small investors unable to contribute new money were treated far less favorably, however, being forced to accept an exchange of old stock for new at the rate of 10 shares for 2.5 — thereby losing 75% of their equity in one fell swoop. Financial institutions and large investors thus saw their stake in the reorganized firm protected, while small investors absorbed the brunt of the inevitable write-down of company value.

Kidder-Peabody benefited handsomely as underwriter of securities and investor in preferred stock, realizing nearly $2.5 million in profit, dividends, and capital gain from the sale of stock over the 1923–28 period.

A charismatic new chief executive came in as part of the restructuring, Frederic Dumaine, who arrived at Waltham to lead the new regime in February 1923. The former &quot;gargantuan collection of small workshops&quot; was integrated, and production steered towards more marketable products. Company debt was paid down. This restructuring proved profitable, and the price of Waltham stock subsequently advanced impressively, easing the company&#x27;s credit burden.

The restructured company of 1923 began its run on the precipice of disaster. A fairly vast part of unsold inventory took the form of partially completed timepieces, a substantial part of which could not be readily disposed of except as scrap. Foremen had kept their departments running at full capacity regardless of actual demand for the components produced, resulting in gluts of jewels, lubricating oil, steel, and brass, while other components remained in short supply. Some items were overproduced to such great extent that available stocks were projected to last for 20 years or more.

Moreover, Waltham was slow to adapt to the desires of a changing marketplace, with postwar consumers demanding an overwhelming proportion of small wristwatches, for which Waltham lacked stylistic prowess or physical machinery. The company remained geared towards the production of high-grade pocket watches. Competition had made itself felt, with rivals Elgin and Hamilton increasing their capitalization and modernizing their plant, while imports from Switzerland increased nearly 500% between 1913 and 1920. Economic recovery in 1922 had left Waltham behind, with fully two-thirds of the plant left idle.

Dumaine&#x27;s efforts at rationalization of Waltham began with a reduction of executive salaries, which had topped $100,000 a year for top level executives in the previous period. Private secretaries were eliminated and a smaller secretarial office pool established instead. No general reduction of salaries was attempted for office and factory workers but total payroll was nonetheless reduced through layoffs and reorganization, with an eye to streamlining the company&#x27;s inefficient planning and billing bureaucracy.

In the words of one study of the company&#x27;s business management practices:

:&quot;The saving in money — about a thousand dollars a day — was important, but the effect on methods and morale was of greater consequence. This initial campaign demonstrated at once, and for all time, that direct and simple methods would be used; also that every employee must earn his wages, not merely in effort expended, but also in results accomplished.

Most importantly, Dumaine changed the company&#x27;s course from the production of the elegantly-crafted pocket watches for which it was known — a form increasingly out of favor with post-war consumers — towards the manufacture of smaller and fresher wristwatches designed for a mass market at a lower price-point. This change had come with significant risk, as Waltham had dominated the market for luxury pocket watches and faced a serious shortage of the designers and toolmakers needed to revamp and modernize its product line. There was even doubt whether American factory production could be adapted to take on the finely-detailed and well crafted product produced by the Swiss at a lower average wage rate.

Dumaine also took aim at Waltham&#x27;s pricing policy, which had previously varied with market conditions to achieve as high a price as possible. Waltham&#x27;s products were consequently priced for between 15 and 25% more than equivalent products of rival companies when the new company regime took the helm in 1923. Still seeking the cachet of a top shelf price, Dumaine nevertheless immediately lowered the selling prices of the company&#x27;s products to a point just 5% higher than the comparable goods of its domestic competitors. This proved to be a first step to true parity with the prices of the company&#x27;s main American competitors, Elgin and Hamilton.

====Watchmakers&#x27; Strike of 1924====

The company turned to a general wage cut of 10 to 40% to bolster profitability in 1924. This, unsurprisingly, proved unpopular with Waltham workers, 75 of whom in the Finishing department put down tools on August 11, 1924, over news of a forthcoming 10% wage cut. The spirit of militance spread and the next day, slated to be the first of the new wage scale, fully 200 workers from the Finishing and Setting-Up departments stayed home. Within three days the entire Waltham plant was embroiled in a company-wide work stoppage, the first in the more than 70-year history of the company.

As part of the strike, former department-level worker organization within Waltham was abandoned and a new organization called the Watchmakers Protective Association established. Affiliation of this new company-wide union with the American Federation of Labor was anticipated.

Plant superintendent I.E. Boucher refused to meet with organized workers in connection with the strike, only individuals, further exacerbating the conflict. Moreover, Boucher declared that striking workers would be no longer considered employees of Waltham and that each must individually apply for reemployment through the company&#x27;s employment office. On the third day, other departments shut down over the company&#x27;s unilateral wage cut, with 2,000 of Waltham&#x27;s 2,900 total employees hitting the street over the reduction. A parade estimated at 2,000 people, including some workers with 50 years of company service, marked through the streets of Waltham to a rally held at the city park. The only department which remained in operation after the third day was the Machine department, whose employees were members of a separate AF of L-affiliated union and who were awaiting approval of their national organization to join the work stoppage. Packing clerks and stenographers joined the strike in sympathy during the second week, effectively halting operations of the Waltham plant.

As August ended the two sides remained deadlocked over the wage scale. More mobile workers began to leave the city, going to Elgin, Illinois or Lancaster, Pennsylvania to seek employment with Waltham&#x27;s chief domestic competitors.

In September a union proposal accepting wage reductions for men making more than $40 a week or women making more than $20 — thereby exempting the lowest paid workers from the cutback. Company acceptance was expected and a celebratory was held on Saturday, September 27. When news came of the company&#x27;s rejection of the compromise proposal, in favor of a counteroffer of a general 7.5% wage cut, the party turned into a riot, with a mob of thousands storming the company&#x27;s gates. Police intervention broke up the melee in the wee hours of Sunday morning.

The rejection of the compromise proposal marked a turning point in the strike, as strikers became more aggressive towards strikebreakers who crossed their picket lines, hurling abuse and stones and waving yellow handkerchiefs at the defectors. Vacations were canceled for the Waltham police force and police presence was increased in the aftermath of the threatened violence.

The strike continued into October, when the Massachusetts State Board of Conciliation, after a lengthy fact-finding process, proposed a 5% wage cut as justified for all workers earning more than $18 a week. This proposal satisfied no one, with Waltham management politely refusing to move off their proposal for a general reduction of 10% and strikers holding a mass meeting which lent no support to the board&#x27;s report.

The company was able to maintain operations through the use of strikebreakers, primarily new hires and the strike continued through the end of 1924.

===World War II and after, 1941–1955===


During World War II Waltham was an important contractor for the American military, producing timepieces for service personnel and timing devices for military ordinance, such as bombs and torpedoes, with the company&#x27;s Waltham, Massachusetts factory wholly converted to military production.

The post-war years were not kind to Waltham, however. A $211,200 net profit in 1945 flipped into a massive $411,400 loss in 1946, ushering in a series of years in which the company generated red ink. A flood on the American market of inexpensive Swiss-produced timepieces was blamed for the company&#x27;s dire economic straits.

The company closed its factory doors and declared bankruptcy in 1949, a crisis was triggered when the final $2 million installment of a promised $6 million loan by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was denied by the lender. Waltham&#x27;s historic Massachusetts facility was shuttered on February 3, 1950, putting 1,200 workers out of a job.

Through the aid of bankruptcy court, in September 1950 a trustee was named to oversee the limited restart of the Waltham facility to complete the manufacture of 242,000 watches for the Christmas selling season. About 250 employees were brought back to the factory for the finishing, regulation, and shipping of these partially-completed timepieces. This partial restart for completion and sale of partially completed inventory proved successful, enabling the company&#x27;s trustees to repay $2 million — half of the $4 million borrowed in the fall of 1949 — to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.

Another $250,000 was repaid toward the company&#x27;s indebtedness by the first of May 1951. In addition, company trustees managed to negotiate several contracts for defense work with prospects for more, leading federal bankruptcy judge George C. Sweeney to approve the company&#x27;s reorganization plan.

&quot;An examination of the balance sheet satisfies me that with careful management the company will be able to function safely and satisfactorily,&quot; Judge Sweeney noted.

Sweeney&#x27;s assessment proved correct, with the Waltham Watch Company squeaking out a profit of $11,728 in 1951 — the first financially positive year since the end of World War II. This compared most positively with the company&#x27;s performance in 1950, in which a loss of $430,000 was declared. This trend continued in 1952, with sales of $2.3 million generating a profit of nearly $73,000 during the first six months of that year. Not coincidentally, these were years of the Korean War, marked by expanded American military spending, which included both contracts for precision timing devices and wristwatches for soldiers.

The reorganized Waltham relaunched watch manufacturing, with some 700 people employed by the firm as of January 1, 1952, and 800 by that summer. In an effort to better balance supply and demand, the company terminated direct sales to stores on that date, returning to the pre-war policy of sales to authorized wholesalers. The challenges of the marketplace remained, however, with low cost watches from Switzerland flooding the market.

In March 1952 the reorganized Waltham surrendered to European manufacturing prowess, announcing that the company would itself begin the importation of complete watch movements from Switzerland. Trustees announced that it would be cheaper to import Swiss movements and pay the tariff on them than to produce the same mechanisms domestically. Waltham would subsequently merely apply dials to these mechanisms and insert the works into cases, it was stated. This decision was slammed by Walter Cenerazzo, head of the American Watch Union, who called for establishment of a &quot;scientific tariff&quot; offsetting the price differential between foreign and domestic manufacture.

Waltham&#x27;s decision to begin importing and casing finished Swiss movements was not unique, with its chief American watch manufacturing competitors, Elgin and Hamilton, making the same business decision.

Waltham Watch continued to prosper in the changing market, with sales up 35% in the first half of 1953 compared to the previous year and employment at the Waltham facility back up to 1,000 people. This growth was not strictly limited to precision timing devices for the military; the company&#x27;s main product, watches, had a sales increase of 30% over 1952.

By 1954, the American watch industry had seen its domestically produced wares fall from a 52% market share in 1940 to just 18%. A steep increase in the tariff on imported jeweled watches, increasing the rate to 50%, was passed. In addition to employment considerations, the steep 50% tax was justified on national security grounds, since the production of timing mechanisms for modern armaments made use of skills and techniques utilized in the vanishing watchmaking craft.

The hike of the tariff on imported jeweled watches did not ultimately shield Waltham from market forces, however. Amidst declining sales of watches to the military and a consumer market saturated with imported timepieces, Waltham saw its 1954 sales plummet by more than 35% from 1953&#x27;s levels, with the company reporting a net loss of $210,000 to shareholders — reversing three years of profitable operations.

=== Interregnum, 1955 to 1957 ===

By now freed from court-controlled reorganization and seeing the writing on the wall, in July 1955 controlling interest in the Waltham Watch Company was reportedly sold to the Bellanca Aircraft Corporation of Los Angeles. The new suitor was attracted by Waltham&#x27;s speedometer and instrument division and immediately declared their intention to dispose of the company&#x27;s existing watch inventory and to spin off the watch manufacturing division.

Bellanca, a maker of airplanes from the 1920s, had subsequently evolved into a manufacturer of precision instruments, engine mounts, radar equipment, and plastic parts. The company had itself been the object of a takeover in February 1955 by S.L. Albert &amp; Son, an Akron-based manufacturer of machinery used primarily in the rubber industry owned by financier Sydney Albert. This had been followed in May by Albert&#x27;s acquisition of National Electronics Laboratories, Inc., of Washington, DC — a maker of aviation communications equipment. Albert also owned the Pierce Governor Company of Anderson, Indiana, manufacturer of automobile engine governors.

Boston newspaper columnist John Harriman was enthusiastic about the change, writing: &quot;Waltham had become the marginal producer in the highly competitive watch field. It will now be thrown over entirely to electronics and precision instruments, our fastest growing industry in these parts, under management which has no apologies to make for its record.&quot;

Albert&#x27;s acquisitions binge began to unravel in mid-1956, when the price of Bellanca stock dropped significantly. Albert had used stock in his various companies as collateral for loans to acquire new companies; federal regulations required that the value of stock held in collateral should equal 30% of the value of the loan, forcing the sale of stock when the value no longer met that benchmark. This put Waltham shares previously held by Albert back into circulation, making possible a new takeover.

Meanwhile, in May 1956 Waltham management named the Hallmark Watch Corporation of Chicago as the company&#x27;s exclusive wholesale distributor to the trade. This arrangement would prove important in coming months as Waltham&#x27;s precision instruments and watch divisions moved their separate ways.

In the Fall of 1956 a new management group headed by dynamic watch wholesaler Joseph Axler succeeded in obtaining 322,700 Waltham shares from a prominent broker, thereby gaining working control of the company. Signaling a move away from precision electronics products, the new managers promised to return Waltham &quot;to its rightful place of leadership in the watch industry.&quot; Effective the first of 1957, Axler moved Waltham&#x27;s executive offices to New York City, leaving the company&#x27;s Massachusetts factory in operation making aircraft clocks, gyroscopes, and other electronic devices.

In July 1957 a move to splitting the company&#x27;s electronics and watchmaking components was formalized when stockholders approved renaming as the Waltham Precision Instruments Company, with a subsidiary to be known as Waltham Watch Company of Delaware.

===Waltham of Chicago, 1958 to 1967===

In January 1958 an agreement was finalized between the Axler-led Waltham Watch Co. and the Chicago-based Hallmark Watch Co. authorizing the latter to assemble watches from imported components under the Waltham name. This agreement was framed by Waltham as a &quot;multi-million dollar royalty agreement.&quot; Waltham President Axler indicated that the company&#x27;s Massachusetts facility would be used for the development and production of other products. The Waltham name was sold outright to Harold B. &quot;Harry&quot; Aronson, president of the Hallmark Watch Company, in the spring of the following year.

The officers of Hallmark took over similar positions in the newly reborn Waltham. The board consisted of Harold B. &quot;Harry&quot; Aronson (president), Ben Cole, and Morris Draft, all formerly officers of Hallmark. Chicago attorney Seymour Rady was a vice president and the company&#x27;s chief counsel from 1957 until his death in December 1966. At the end of 1959 Aaron Thorne, a former Western regional sales manager for Benrus Watch Company was added as a vice president, working from an office in Los Angeles. Thorne supervised sales to the Western United States and Asia.

The new company moved its base of operations from Massachusetts to Chicago. An important change was made in the company&#x27;s business model, with a move to franchised distributors who would pay about $1200 up front to the company in exchange for display cases and inventory to be placed in local drug stores, hardware stores, and appliance stores. Hundreds of newspaper ads were placed around the country to publicize the venture, which was headquartered in New York under the name Time Industries. Franchisees were to maintain inventory in these cases, splitting proceeds with the business owners in which the cases were placed. This change signified a new emphasis upon lower-end, more popularly priced products.

The new company also moved to license its well-known and respected name to others. In the fall of 1963 Waltham signed a licensing agreement with the Samson Company of Chicago to manufacture transistor radios and tape recorders bearing the Waltham logo.

Production of the complicated inner watch movements was moved out of the United States. Waltham opened a new factory in Neuchatel, Switzerland in the summer of 1962 designed to produce up to 100,000 watch movements per month.

The company came under much scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission throughout the 1960s, accused of misrepresenting the number of jewels within its watches, pre-tagging merchandise with inflated prices bearing no connection to actual prices charged, and misrepresenting country of origin and connection of the new company to the previous Waltham Watch Co. It was forced to change its advertising and branding policies in response to these complaints.

Waltham was a very successful enterprise throughout its Chicago period with total sales jumping from about $10.5 Million in 1962 to $12.1 Million in 1963, and net income increasing by 70%. Improvement in efficiency and higher gross margins were credited for the up-tick in profitability. Sales and profits increased again in 1964, with total sales hitting the $13.3 Million mark and net income up another 35%.

Waltham emerged as a leading maker of dive watches, a segment which sold over 200,000 pieces in the United States in 1967. The company made a 5 bar hand-winding model priced at $50 and a deluxe version good to 300 feet for serious divers retailing for $120.

===Sale to new Swiss ownership, 1968 to 1980===

In March 1968, Waltham President Harry Aronson announced that a Swiss group headed by the Invicta Watch Co. had agreed to in principle purchase Waltham, still a publicly-held company whose shares were sold over the counter. A formal offer to buy shares of Waltham common stock at $16 per share was announced in September 1968. Purchaser was a Delaware-registered entity called Iseca, headed by Invicta Watch Company of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, but also including H. Sandoz &amp; Co. of La Chaux-de-Fonds, and Degoumois &amp; Co. of Neuchatel, Switzerland. Iseca&#x27;s purchase was of 283,976 shares, of which 151,819 were held by a group headed by company president Harry B. Aronson. Aronson was retained under terms of the deal as a consultant for six years at $30,000 per year. A total of just over $6.5 million cash were to be used in the acquisition, financed by sale of Iseca capital stock and a $3.9 million loan from the Union Bank of Switzerland. According to the published Sept. offer, &quot;Iseca does not presently have any plan to liquidate Waltham, or to sell its assets to, or merge it with, any other persons, or to make any other major change in Waltham&#x27;s business or corporate structure.&quot;

Management was changed with the purchase of Waltham by Invicta, with Georges Didisheim, president of Invicta Watch Co., named chairman and Morris Draft executive vice president in August 1968. The company remained headquartered in Chicago.

There are also some Waltham watch models that have been brought to Invicta. In those years Waltham started to produce a watch line, especially for Invicta. This was called “Invicta by Waltham”. In some cases, both Invicta and Waltham were on the dial. Other cases will only show a “W” to indicate that this watch was manufactured by Waltham for Invicta.

Later in the 1970s, Waltham was merged into a federation with other Swiss makers of inexpensive watches, the Société des Garde-Temps SA (SGT). Georges Didisheim remained chairman of the board of Waltham following this merger.

Concentrating on manufacturing watches for lower retail prices, sales blossomed, with quantity of watches sold doubling between 1968 and 1975, to a total of more than one million pieces annually. This made Waltham the third largest watchmaker in America by 1975, behind Timex and Bulova. Sales were sufficient to move to a new larger facility in Chicago, a 100,000 square foot building formerly owned by the American Can Company.

In January 1974, Société des Garde-Temps purchased rights to the name of the Elgin Watch Company, another storied American brand.

===Waltham in the Quartz era, 1981 to date===

As a result of the quartz crisis, SGT terminated operations in 1981. The rights to the names of the various SGT brands were sold individually.

The Waltham brand name was purchased by the Japanese firm Heiwado &amp; Co. and soon emerged as one of the most popular brands in Japan.

In 2011 a majority stake in Waltham International SA was sold to Italian-American entrepreneur Antonio DiBenedetto.

==Legacy==

Before the Waltham Watch Company went out of business in 1957, it founded a subsidiary in Switzerland in 1954, Waltham International SA. Waltham International SA retains the right to the Waltham trade name outside of North America, and continues to produce mechanical wrist watches and mechanical pocket watches under the &quot;Waltham&quot; brand.

During their restructuring efforts in the 1950s, Waltham opened an office in New York for the purposes of importing Swiss watch movements and cases. Due to restrictions placed on the company by its main creditor, the Restructuring Finance Corporation, they could not sell these watches directly, so they were sold through an independent company, the Hallmark Watch Company.

Specialized clocks and chronographs for use in aircraft control panels continued to be made in the Waltham factory by the Waltham Precision Instruments Company. In February 1994, Prime Time Clocks purchased the last remaining product line, the mechanical aircraft clock. Waltham Precision Instruments was moved to Ozark, Alabama and changed its name to Waltham Aircraft Clock Corporation.

==Historical resources==

Every watch movement that the company produced through the early 1950s was engraved with an individual serial number. That number can be used to estimate the date of production. Volunteers have created a database of Waltham serial numbers, models and grades, and descriptions of observed watches.

The archive of the Waltham Watch Company is housed by Baker Library Special Collections department of the library of Harvard Business School, Harvard University. The material, which includes company books primarily from 1854 to 1929, is contained in 52 archival boxes, totaling 111 linear feet.

<text>In Ancient Egyptian religion, Taweret (, also spelled Taurt, Tuat, Tuart, Ta-weret, Tawaret, Twert and Taueret, and in , Thoeris, Taouris and Toeris) is the protective goddess of childbirth and fertility. The name &quot;Taweret&quot; means &quot;she who is great&quot; or simply &quot;great one&quot;, a common pacificatory address to dangerous deities. The deity is typically depicted as a bipedal female hippopotamus with feline attributes, pendulous female human breasts, the limbs and paws of a lion, and the back and tail of a Nile crocodile. She commonly bears the epithets &quot;Lady of Heaven&quot;, &quot;Mistress of the Horizon&quot;, &quot;She Who Removes Water&quot;, &quot;Mistress of Pure Water&quot;, and &quot;Lady of the Birth House&quot;.

==History and development==
Archaeological evidence demonstrates that hippopotamuses inhabited the Nile well before the dawn of Early Dynastic Period (before 3000 BCE). The violent and aggressive behavior of these creatures intrigued the people that inhabited the region, leading the ancient Egyptians both to persecute and to venerate them. From a very early age, male hippopotamuses were thought to be manifestations of chaos; consequently, they were overcome in royal hunting campaigns, intended to demonstrate the divine power of the king. However, female hippopotamuses were revered as manifestations of apotropaic deities, as they assiduously protect their young from harm. Protective amulets bearing the likenesses of female hippopotamuses have been found dating as far back as the Predynastic period (c. 3000–2686 BCE). The tradition of making and wearing these amulets continued throughout the history of Egypt into the Ptolemaic Kingdom and the Roman period (c. 332 BCE – 390 CE).

From her ideological conception, Taweret was closely grouped with (and is often indistinguishable from) several other protective hippopotamus goddesses: Ipet, Reret, and Hedjet. Some scholars even interpret these goddesses as aspects of the same deity, considering their universally shared role as protective household goddesses. The other hippopotamus goddesses have names that bear very specific meanings, much like Taweret (whose name is formed as a pacificatory address intended to calm the ferocity of the goddess): Ipet&#x27;s name (&quot;the Nurse&quot;) demonstrates her connection to birth, child rearing, and general caretaking, and Reret&#x27;s name (&quot;the Sow&quot;) is derived from the Egyptians&#x27; classification of hippopotami as water pigs. However, the origin of Hedjet&#x27;s name (&quot;the White One&quot;) is not as clear and could justly be debated. Evidence for the cult of hippopotamus goddesses exists from the time of the Old Kingdom (c. 2686 – 2181 BCE) in the corpus of ancient Egyptian funerary texts entitled the Pyramid Texts. Spell 269 in the &quot;Pyramid Texts&quot; mentions Ipet and succinctly demonstrates her nurturing role; the spell announces that the deceased king will suck on the goddess&#x27;s &quot;white, dazzling, sweet milk&quot; when he ascends to the heavens. As maternal deities, these goddesses served to nurture and protect the Egyptian people, both royal (as seen in the Pyramid Texts) and non-royal.

It was not until the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 2055–1650 BCE) that Taweret became featured more prominently as a figure of religious devotion. Her image adorns magical objects, the most notable of which being a common type of &quot;wand&quot; or &quot;knife&quot; carved from hippopotamus ivory that was likely used in rituals associated with birth and the protection of infants. Similar images appear also on children&#x27;s feeding cups, once again demonstrating Taweret&#x27;s integral role as the patron goddess of child rearing. Quite contrarily, she also took on the role of a funerary deity in this period, evidenced by the commonplace practice of placing hippopotami decorated with marsh flora in tombs and temples. Some scholars believe that this practice demonstrates that hippopotamus goddesses facilitated the process of rebirth after death, just as they aided in earthly births. These statues, then, assisted the deceased&#x27;s passing into the afterlife.

With the rise of popular piety in the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1069 BCE), household deities like Taweret gained even more importance. Taweret&#x27;s image has been found on an array of household objects, demonstrating her central role in the home. In fact, such objects were even found at Amarna from the reign of Akhenaten (c. 1352–1336 BCE), a pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty who reorganized ancient Egyptian religion into a monotheistic religion focused on the worship of the sun disc, called the Aten. The worship of many traditional gods was proscribed during this period, so Taweret&#x27;s survival in the artistic corpus found at the Aten&#x27;s capital demonstrates her overwhelming significance in daily life. In this time period, her role as a funerary deity was strengthened, as her powers became considered not only life-giving, but regenerative as well. Various myths demonstrate her role in facilitating the afterlives of the deceased as the nurturing and purifying &quot;Mistress of Pure Water&quot;. However, Taweret and her fellow hippopotamus goddesses of fertility should not be confused with Ammit, another composite hippopotamus goddess who gained prominence in the New Kingdom. Ammit was responsible for devouring the unjust before passing into the afterlife. Unlike Ammit, the other hippopotamus goddesses were responsible for nourishment and aid, not destruction.

In the Ptolemaic and Roman periods (c. 332 BCE – 390 CE), Taweret maintained a central role in daily Egyptian life. In either the latter half of the Late Period (c. 664–332 BCE) or the early Ptolemaic period, a temple dedicated to Ipet was built at Karnak. This enigmatic temple was thought to witness the daily birth of the sun god from the hippopotamus goddesses that dwelled there. The sun god (Amun-Re) was conceived of as having multiple divine mothers, and by this later period in Egyptian history, Taweret and the other hippopotamus goddesses were included in this body of solar mothers. Taweret&#x27;s image also appeared on the outside of temples dedicated to other deities due to her apotropaic ability to ward off malevolent forces. Outside of temple settings, the household cult of the goddesses remained strong, and amulets bearing their likenesses peaked in popularity during these years.

===Outside of Egypt===
Taweret developed a significant cult outside of Egypt as well. In the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE), economic and minimal political contact with the Asiatic cultures of the Levant led to the exchange of ideologies. Taweret was adopted into Levantine religions, serving the same maternal role in these foreign pantheons.

====Ancient Crete====
Due to communication between Levantine coastal towns and Mediterranean localities, Taweret also became an integral part of Minoan religion in Crete, where it is known as the Minoan Genius.

Like in Egypt, her image was featured most prominently on protective amulets. However, this image was altered slightly from the Egyptian one, as she was folded into the corpus of Minoan iconography in an artistic style that was congruent with other Minoan images. From Crete, this image spread to mainland Greece, where the goddess was featured in palatine art in Mycenae.

====In Nubia====

The goddess was also adopted by the Nubians, the empire that lay directly south of Egypt in what is now Sudan. Like her Minoan counterpart, the Nubian Taweret became a part of the Nubian pantheon in the late Middle Kingdom of Egypt. She was evidently featured in royal rituals at Kerma, the capital of the empire.

====Phoenicia====

There is a connection to the Phoenician goddess of pregnancy Dea Gravida.

==In mythology==
Although Ipet (aka Apet or Aptet) is mentioned in the Old Kingdom Pyramid Texts, and Taweret is seen frequently on Middle Kingdom ritual objects, hippopotamus goddesses did not gain a significant role in Egyptian mythology until the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1069 BCE). Taweret is featured in some versions of a popular and widespread myth in which the Eye of Ra becomes angry with her father and retreats to Nubia in the form of a lioness. Upon the Eye of Ra&#x27;s eventual return to Egypt, she assumes the form of a hippopotamus (presumably Taweret) and consequently brings the flooding of the Nile. This myth demonstrates Taweret&#x27;s primary function as a goddess of fertility and rejuvenation. Some scholars feel that her role in the Nile inundation is one of the reasons she was given the epithet &quot;Mistress of Pure Water&quot;. However, her similar role in the rejuvenation of the dead also cannot be overlooked with regards to this epithet – just as she provided life for the living through physical birth and the inundation, she also cleansed and purified the dead so they could pass safely into the afterlife.
In the New Kingdom Taweret&#x27;s image was frequently used to represent a northern constellation in zodiacs. This image is attested in several astronomical tomb paintings, including the Theban tombs of Tharwas (tomb 353), Hatshepsut&#x27;s famed advisor Senenmut (tomb 232), and the pharaoh Seti I (KV17) in the Valley of the Kings. The image of this astral Taweret appears almost exclusively next to the Setian foreleg of a bull. The latter image represents the Big Dipper and is associated with the Egyptian god of chaos, Seth. The relationship between the two images is discussed in the &quot;Book of Day and Night&quot; (a cosmically focused mythological text from the Twentieth Dynasty, c. 1186–1069 BCE) as follows: &quot;As to this foreleg of Seth, it is in the northern sky, tied down to two mooring posts of flint by a chain of gold. It is entrusted to Isis as a hippopotamus guarding it.&quot; Although the hippopotamus goddess is identified in this text as Isis, not Taweret, this phenomenon is not uncommon in later periods of Egyptian history. When assuming a protective role, powerful goddesses like Isis, Hathor, and Mut assumed the form of Taweret, effectively becoming a manifestation of this goddess. Likewise, Taweret gradually absorbed qualities of these goddesses and is commonly seen wearing the Hathoric sun disc that is iconographically associated with both Hathor and Isis.

This cosmic image continues to be seen in later periods, although the tendency was to show such divine astral bodies more abstractly. One example can be found in the late Ptolemaic or early Roman &quot;Book of the Faiyum&quot;, a local monograph dedicated to the Faiyum and its patron gods, namely Sobek-Re. Taweret is depicted in her standard form with a crocodile on her back and a small upright crocodile in her right hand. She is shown in the section of the papyrus that is meant to depict the Faiyum&#x27;s central Lake Moeris. The papyrus depicts the solar journey of Re with Lake Moeris as the place into which the sun god descends for his nightly journey, traditionally thought of as the underworldly realm of the Amduat. Taweret appears here as a well known constellation to demonstrate the celestial and otherworldly properties of Lake Moeris. She also serves as a fine protective divine mother to Sobek-Re during his precarious journey. In this respect, she fulfills the role of Neith, the primary divine mother of Sobek. This Taweret figure is labeled as &quot;Neith the Great, who protects her son&quot;, demonstrating the malleability of the hippopotamus goddess form. When in the role of a protective mother, it is not uncommon that other goddesses would appear in the form of Taweret.

Taweret was featured in other myths as well during these later periods. In the famed Metternich Stela, Isis tells Horus that he was reared by a &quot;sow and a dwarf&quot;, almost certainly referring to Taweret and her fellow apotropaic demon-god Bes, respectively. Although the date of this stela is relatively late, the central role of Taweret in the successful raising of children is still being stressed, showing the continuity of her character. She is also mentioned in Plutarch&#x27;s notes on the central myth of Isis and Osiris. She joined the forces of order and helped Horus to defeat Set.

==In art==
Taweret bears physical aspects of both a fertility goddess and a fearsome protective deity. She takes the form of a female hippopotamus, a highly deadly creature. She is also often seen with features from other predatory creatures, most notably being the tail of a Nile crocodile and the paws of a lioness. These features directly parallel those of other ferocious protective ancient Egyptian deities, most notably the crocodile god Sobek and the lioness goddess Sekhmet. These violent theriomorphic deities take on some of the aspects of the animals that they represent – both to the benefit and detriment of humans. Taweret&#x27;s predatory form allows her to ward away evil from the innocent. Likewise, Taweret&#x27;s nurturing aspects are also reinforced in her iconography, as she frequently is shown with a pregnant belly, and pendulous human breasts. These breasts are shared by the god of the Nile inundation, Hapi, and signify regenerative powers. Taweret&#x27;s riverine form allows her to participate in that which annually revives the Nile Valley: the inundation personified by Hapi. It is partly due to her role in this event that may share this iconographic feature with Hapi. She frequently is seen holding the &quot;sa&quot; hieroglyphic sign (Gardiner V17), which literally means &quot;protection&quot;.
Taweret&#x27;s image served a functional purpose on a variety of objects. The most notable of these objects are amulets, which protected mothers and children from harm. Such amulets, appearing before 3000 BCE, were popular for most of ancient Egyptian history. She also consistently appeared on household furniture throughout history, including chairs, stools, and headrests. Apotropaic objects became popular in the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BCE) and are thought to have been used in rituals related to pregnancy and birth. As is aforementioned, ivory wands and knives showing long processions of deities became widely used in this period. These objects have been shown on tomb paintings in the hands of nurses and wear patterns on the tips indicate that these nurses likely used them to draw protective patterns in the sand. Taweret is featured on almost all known wands, as her powers were invoked particularly to protect children and their mothers. The other deities are almost exclusively deities that accompany the mature sun god in his nightly journey through the dangerous Amduat (underworld). Taweret&#x27;s inclusion among this company suggests a protective solar role. This is supported by later Ptolemaic (c. 332–30 BCE) conceptions of the goddess, which state that she reared – and in some traditions, birthed – the young sun god (cf. Metternich Stela).
Ritual objects bearing Taweret&#x27;s image were popular in Egyptian households for the remainder of Egyptian history. Vessels bearing Taweret&#x27;s shape became popular in the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1069 BCE). These vessels presumably purified the liquid that was poured from it, as Taweret was considered to be &quot;She of the Pure Water&quot;. Often these vessels had openings through the nipples, emphasizing Taweret&#x27;s maternal aspects.

== In popular culture ==
A giant statue of Taweret appears in the science-fiction television series &quot;Lost&quot; and plays an important role in the backstory of the show&#x27;s mysterious island. 

Antonia Salib portrays Taweret in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) television series &quot;Moon Knight&quot; (2022). In the show Taweret is the protector of the weights of the heart to the quil and helps people get to the afterlife through the field of reeds.

<text>The State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs became merged with the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Montenegro to form the nation of Yugoslavia in 1918. The formation of Yugoslavia began with the formation of the Yugoslav Committee, a collection of mostly Croats, then Serbs and later Slovenes, whose goal was to form a single south Slavic state. In October 1918 the Croatian Parliament declared the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia as an independent state, which, in December that same year, incorporated into the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, merged with Kingdom of Serbia and Kingdom of Montenegro and created the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The kingdom would be renamed to Yugoslavia in 1929, and ruled by Serbian Karađorđević dynasty till Second World War. After the formation of Yugoslavia, Serbia attempted to create a &quot;Greater Serbia&quot; by using police intimidation and vote rigging to establish a Serbian controlled Yugoslavia. From 1929-1941 Serbian controlled Yugoslavia established control over Croatia through Royal Yugoslav police force brutality and assassinations of important Croatians.

==The Yugoslav Committee==

The basis of State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and Kingdom of Serbia forming a union in 1918 is to be found in the complex history of the Yugoslav Committee. The Yugoslav Committee was formed by Croatian exiles living outside the Austro-Hungarian homeland during World War I. The Committee was led by Frano Supilo and Ante Trumbić and included the famous Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović. Each repudiated the Committee within a few years of the founding of Yugoslavia. &quot;Yugoslavs&quot; were Serbian, Croatian and Slovene people who identified themselves with the movement toward a single South Slavic state. Exiled Yugoslavs living in North America and Britain were the primary supporters of the Yugoslav Committee. Having established offices in London and Paris as early as 1915, the Yugoslav Committee became an active lobby for the cause of a united South Slav state during World War I.

The concept of a unified South Slavic state had been discussed by Croatian and Slovene intellectuals since the mid-nineteenth century. However, the &quot;Yugoslav Idea&quot; did not mature from the conceptual to practical state of planning. Few of those promoting such an entity had given any serious consideration to what form the new state should take. Nevertheless, the Yugoslav Committee issued a manifesto calling for the formation of such a South Slavic state on May 12, 1915. The document, like the rhetoric of those who produced it, was vague concerning the form and system of government. It received little official recognition.

As the War dragged on, the Allies began to think of the concept of Yugoslavia as a blocking force in the Balkans to counter future German expansionism. Although no formal agreement was announced until July 1917, the Yugoslav Committee and the Serbian Government-in-Exile worked hand-in-hand from November 1916 onward. On July 20, 1917 the Serbian government and the Yugoslav Committee issued the text of an agreement known as the Corfu Declaration which called for the formation of a multi-national state. The vast majority of the Serbian, Croatian and Slovene people had no knowledge of the declaration made by a small group of exiled intellectuals and the Serbian Government-in-Exile. Nonetheless, the signers claimed to speak for all South Slavic peoples and the Corfu Declaration became the justification claimed by Serbia for the forced unification of Croatians and Slovenes under the Serbian crown.

==Formation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes==
As the War drew to a close, the Austro-Hungarian Empire began to disintegrate. The Croatian Parliament (&quot;Sabor&quot;) met in Zagreb on October 29, 1918 to declare &quot;the Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia&quot; to be a free and independent state. All major parties from the Croatian Parliament had named representatives into the new National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs that had been formed in early October 1918, and which in turn took control over most of the Austro-Hungarian possessions inhabited by South Slavs.

On November 24, the National Council declared the new state&#x27;s unification with Kingdom of Serbia (who had already absorbed Kingdom of Montenegro), and its members started negotiating the terms with the Serbian Regent Alexander.

Stjepan Radić&#x27;s Croatian Peasant Party participated in the National Council, but after it decided to merge with Serbia, they started to back off, calling the move foolish, and disputing the decision based on the fact that the Croatian Parliament never explicitly approved it.

Zagreb&#x27;s brief jubilation quickly changed to the sober realization that Croatia would again be ruled from a foreign capital as Italian, French and French African forces invaded from the west and Serbian troops invaded from the east.

On December 1, 1918, Serbian Prince Alexander announced the formation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, with a Serbian King ruling from the Serbian capital of Belgrade. Despite the neutral-sounding name, the country was called Yugoslavia by the diplomatic community almost from the beginning.

==Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (1918–1929)==

The greatest promoters of creating a state of the Southern Slavs, i.e. the idea of Yugoslavia, were the Croats (Josip Juraj Strossmayer on the first place), but they did not conceive of it as a centralized, Serb-dominated state. Their aim was to preserve the Croatian national identity and the sovereignty of Croatia and to organize the new state of South Slavs on a confederative basis.

That is why the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, established in 1918, did not obtain the confirmation and permission of the Croatian Parliament. This state, created in 1918 from Austro-Hungarian part, (Koruška, Štajerska, Kranjska, Istra, Dalmatia, Croatia - Slavonia, Vojvodina, Bosnia and Herzegovina) and Serbia and Montenegro, which were opposing sides during the First World War (1914–1918), contained a germ of numerous future conflicts. It was composed of different traditions, religions, nations, languages and scripts.

Following the Vidovdan Constitution of 1921, in 1922 the region of Syrmia (the territory between rivers Sava and Danube), that was part of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia before 1918, became part of the Syrmia Oblast. In 1929, most of Syrmia became part of Danube Banovina. In 1939, most of that in turn was left out of Banovina of Croatia.

In 1918 Croatia and Vojvodina had much better economic situation than Central Serbia. In 1920 only 20% of adults in Central Serbia were literate compared to 88%, 52% and 36% in Slovenia, Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia respectively. Their rate of literacy has been 2.5 times higher. Croatia had double more elementary schools than Serbia. Croatian and Vojvodina had 4910 km of railway track compared to 1187 km in Central Serbia.

Persecutions of the Muslims by the Serbs resulted in their massive emigration to Turkey soon after the foundation of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, where Serbia was the leading and privileged nation. The same happened to several hundred thousand Muslims soon after the Second World War.

On November 28, 1920 elections to the Constitutional Assembly were held. The Assembly was to be charged with adopting a constitution for the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The Croatian People&#x27;s Peasant Party emerged as the largest Croatian party in the assembly, with 50 seats. The party subsequently held a congress in Zagreb on December 8 where it was renamed to the Croatian Republican Peasant Party, and a republican platform for the new constitution was adopted. In response to this, King Peter removed Matko Laginja from the position of ban on December 11. In turn, the Croatian Republican Peasant Party boycotted the assembly.

The concept of &quot;Greater Serbia&quot; in Yugoslavia was put in practice during the early 1920s, under the Yugoslav premiership of Nikola Pašić. Using tactics of police intimidation and vote rigging, he diminished the role of the oppositions (mainly those loyal to his Croatian rival, Stjepan Radić) to his government in parliament, creating an environment to centralization of power in the hands of the Serbs in general and Serbian politicians in particular.

Stjepan Radić was one of the most significant personalities in the Croatian political history, who strived to renew the Croatian sovereignty and the economic and cultural emancipation of Croatia. He wanted the state of the Southern Slavs to be reorganized on confederative basis, without Serbian hegemony.

In 1928, Radić was assassinated in the Yugoslav parliament in Belgrade on 20 June 1928 together with his colleagues.

==Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1929–1941)==

The assassination of Stjepan Radić caused a major political crisis and the latter half of 1928 was marked with demonstrations and recriminations, with the Croats and prečani Serbs united in demands for federalization.
Nevertheless, the January 6 Dictatorship, the personal dictatorship of King Aleksandar emerged in 1929, and the King banned national political parties – a regime met by opposition from Croatia.

The culmination of the Serbian police terror took place during this period. One of the historical documents from that period, showing &quot;methods&quot; of the Serbian police and administration, is a bill on 13 dinars and 15 paras charged to a Croatian family in 1934 for five bullets fired at the father, who was sentenced to death. The families were persuaded even to pay the &quot;expenses&quot; of the execution within eight days, under the threat of confiscation of their property. Croatian archbishop Alojzije Stepinac reported about this event to the French diplomat Ernest Pezet in 1935.

Belgrade also made use of the world economic crises in 1929 to destroy the Croatian banking system, which had been the strongest in Yugoslavia.

In 1931, Milan Šufflay, Croatian historian of international reputation known esp. for his contributions in the field of albanology, was assassinated in Zagreb. Because of this, Albert Einstein and Heinrich Mann sent an appeal to the International League of Human Rights in Paris to &quot;protect Croats from the terror and persecutions of the Serbian police&quot;. The appeal was also published in the New York Times on 6 May 1931, saying that the newspapers in Zagreb were not allowed to report about Sufflay&#x27;s activity; it was not allowed to attach a half-mast flag on the main building of the University of Zagreb in his honour; the time of the funeral could not be announced publicly, and even condolence messages were not allowed to be telegraphed. In their letter Einstein and Mann held the Yugoslav king Aleksandar explicitly responsible for the state terror over the Croats.

The king himself was assassinated by Vlado Chernozemski in Marseille in 1934, in a collaboration of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) with the Ustasha organization.

An extremely valuable account on the terrorist methods of the Pan-Serbs in Yugoslavia between the two World Wars has been written by Henri Pozzi, a French diplomat and a close witness, in his book &quot;Black Hand over Europe&quot;, London, 1935, referring in the title to the &quot;Black Hand&quot;, the Pan-Serbian secret terrorist organization, very close to the Royal court in Belgrade.

The tendency of administrative parcellization of Croatia that started in 1922 was revised by the establishment of the autonomous Croatia - Banovina of Croatia - in 1939. It also included Dalmatia and parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Aftermath==
These aspects partly contributed to the rise of the Croatian nationalist movement called Ustasha, which gathered around Ante Pavelić (1889–1959). After the invasion and dismemberment of Yugoslavia in World War 2 due to Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, Croatia would go on to become a puppet state of the Axis powers, known as the Independent State of Croatia (NDH, Nezavisna država Hrvatska, 1941–1945).

The actions of King Alexander Karadjordjevic and the state terror in the First Yugoslavia has also contributed to the Ustasa&#x27;s method of revenge of genocide against the Serbs in World War Two-era puppet state of the Independent State of Croatia.

<doc id="755354" wikidata="Q357792" url="?curid=755354" title="Edward John Eyre">
<text>Edward John Eyre (5 August 181530 November 1901) was an English land explorer of the Australian continent, colonial administrator, Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand&#x27;s New Munster province, and Governor of Jamaica.

==Early life==
Eyre was born in Whipsnade, Bedfordshire, shortly before his family moved to Hornsea, Yorkshire, where he was christened. His parents were Rev. Anthony William Eyre and Sarah (née Mapleton). After completing grammar school at Louth and Sedbergh, he moved to the colonial settlement of Sydney, Australia, rather than join the army or go to university. He gained experience in the new land by boarding with and forming friendships with prominent gentlemen and became a flock owner when he bought 400 lambs a month before his 18th birthday.

==In South Australia==

In December 1837, Eyre started droving 1,000 sheep and 600 cattle overland from Monaro, New South Wales, to Adelaide, South Australia. Eyre, with his livestock and eight stockmen, arrived in Adelaide in July 1838. In Adelaide, Eyre sold the livestock for a large profit.

With the money from the sale, Eyre set out to explore the interior of South Australia. In 1839, Eyre went on two separate expeditions: north to the Flinders Ranges and west to beyond Ceduna. The northernmost point of the first expedition was Mount Eyre; it was named by Governor Gawler on 11 July 1839. On the second expedition, he spotted what was later named Lake Torrens.

In 1840, Eyre went on a third expedition, reaching a lake that was later named Lake Eyre, in his honour.

==Overland to Albany==
Eyre, together with his aboriginal companion Wylie, was the first European to traverse the coastline of the Great Australian Bight and the Nullarbor Plain by land in 1840–1841, on an almost trip to Albany, Western Australia. He had originally led the expedition with John Baxter and three aboriginal people.

On 29 April 1841, two of the aboriginal people killed Baxter and left with most of the supplies. Eyre and Wylie survived only because they chanced to encounter at a bay near Esperance, Western Australia, the French whaling ship &quot;Mississippi&quot;, under the command of an Englishman, Captain Thomas Rossiter, for whom Eyre named the location Rossiter Bay. In 1845, he returned to England on board the &quot;Symmetry&quot;, leaving Port Adelaide on 16 December 1844, and sailing via Cape Town, under Captain Elder. Upon reaching England, the &quot;Symmetry&quot; called first at Deal, Kent on 11 May 1845, before anchoring at London on 12 May. He brought with him two aboriginal boys, one of whom was Warrulan.

Once in England, he published a narrative of his travels.

==Colonial Governor in New Zealand==
From 1848 to 1853, he served as Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand&#x27;s New Munster Province (Wellington and the South Island) under Sir George Grey. He married Adelaide Ormond in 1850. She was the sister of the politician John Davies Ormond.

==Colonial Governor in Jamaica==
From 1854 Eyre was Governor of several Caribbean island colonies, including Saint Vincent and Antigua.

As Governor of Jamaica, Eyre passed bills to provide punishment on the treadmill for certain offences, and flogging as the penalty for stealing food. George William Gordon, a mixed-race member of the Assembly of Jamaica, criticised Eyre&#x27;s draconian measures, warning that &quot;If we are to be governed by such a Governor much longer, the people will have to fly to arms and become self-governing.&quot;

Baptist preacher and rebel leader Paul Bogle encouraged and led a rebellion, and occasioned the death of 18 militia or officials. Fearful of an island-wide uprising, Eyre suppressed the Morant Bay rebellion of 1865. Up to 439 black peasants were killed in the reprisals, some 600 flogged, and about 1000 houses burnt down. General Luke Smythe O&#x27;Connor was directly responsible for those who inflicted excessive punishment.

Erroneously convinced that he was one of the leaders of the rebellion, Eyre authorised the execution of Gordon, who was tried for high treason by Lieutenant Herbert Brand in a court-martial. On 23 October, Gordon was hanged two days after his hastily-arranged trial, and Bogle followed him on to the gallows two days later, when he was hanged along with 14 others.

The controlling European element of the Jamaican population, those who had the most to lose, regarded Eyre as the hero who had saved Jamaica from disaster. Eyre&#x27;s influence on the white planters was so strong that he convinced the House of Assembly to pass constitutional reforms that brought the old form of government to an end and allowed Jamaica to become a Crown Colony, with an appointed, rather than an elected, legislature on the basis that stronger legislative control would ward off another act of rebellion. That move ended the growing influence of the elected free people of colour Eyre distrusted, such as Gordon, Edward Jordon and Robert Osborn. Before dissolving itself, the legislature passed legislation to deal with the recent emergency, including an Act that sanctioned martial law and, all importantly for the litigation in &quot;Phillips v Eyre&quot;, an Act of Indemnity covering all acts done in good faith to suppress the rebellion after the proclamation of martial law.

Those events created great controversy in England and resulted in demands for Eyre to be arrested and tried for murdering Gordon. John Stuart Mill organised the Jamaica Committee, which demanded his prosecution and included some well-known English liberal intellectuals such as John Bright, Charles Darwin, Frederic Harrison, Thomas Hughes, Thomas Henry Huxley, Herbert Spencer and A. V. Dicey. Other notable members of the committee included Charles Buxton, Edmond Beales, Leslie Stephen, James Fitzjames Stephen, Edward Frankland, Thomas Hill Green, Frederick Chesson, Goldwin Smith, Charles Lyell and Henry Fawcett.

The Governor Eyre Defence and Aid Committee was set up by Thomas Carlyle in September 1866 to argue that Eyre had acted decisively to restore order. The committee secretary was Hamilton Hume, a member of the Royal Geographical Society with whom Eyre had explored in New South Wales. His supporters included John Ruskin, Charles Kingsley, Charles Dickens, Lord Cardigan, Alfred Tennyson and John Tyndall.

Cases against Lieutenant Brand and Brigadier Alexander Nelson were presented to the Central Criminal Court but the grand jury declined to certify either case. Eyre resided in Market Drayton in Shropshire, which was outside the jurisdiction of the court, so the indictment failed on that count. Barrister James Fitzjames Stephen travelled to Market Drayton but failed to convince the Justices to endorse his case against Eyre. The Jamaica Committee next asked the Attorney-General to certify the criminal information against Eyre but was rebuffed. Eyre then moved to London so that he might bring matters to a head and offer himself up to justice. The magistrate at Bow Street Police Court declined to arrest him, due to the failure of the cases against the soldiers, whereupon the imagined prosecutors applied to the Queen&#x27;s Bench for a writ of mandamus justified by the Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1802 and succeeded. The Queen&#x27;s Bench grand jury, upon presentation of the case against Eyre, declined to find a true bill of indictment, and Eyre was freed of criminal pursuit.

The case went next to the civil courts. Alexander Phillips charged Eyre with six counts of assault and false imprisonment, in addition to conversion of Phillips&#x27;s &quot;goods and chattels&quot;, and the case was eventually brought to the UK Court of Exchequer as Phillips v Eyre (1870) LR 6 QB 1, Exchequer Chamber. The case was influential in setting a precedent in English and Australian law over the conflict of laws, and choice of law to be applied in international torts cases. Eyre was exonerated in the Queen&#x27;s Bench, a writ of error was submitted to the Exchequer, whose judgment affirmed the one below, and an important precedent was thus set by Willes J.

==Later life==

Eyre&#x27;s legal expenses were covered by the British government in 1872, and in 1874 he was granted the pension of a retired colonial governor. He lived out the remainder of his life at Walreddon Manor in the parish of Whitchurch near Tavistock, Devon, where he died on 30 November 1901. He is buried in the Whitchurch churchyard.

==Recognition and legacy==
A statue of Eyre is in Victoria Square in Adelaide as well as Rumbalara Reserve in Springfield NSW on the Mouat Walk. In 1970, an Australia Post (then Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department) postage stamp bore his portrait.

South Australia&#x27;s Lake Eyre, Eyre Peninsula, Eyre Creek, Eyre Highway (the main highway from South Australia to Western Australia), Edward John Eyre High School, the Eyre Hotel in Whyalla, and the electoral district of Eyre in Western Australia, are named in his honour. So too are the villages of Eyreton and West Eyreton, and Eyrewell Forest, in Canterbury and the Eyre Mountains and Eyre Creek in Southland, New Zealand.

Eyre Road, Linton, Palmerston North also is thought to be named after him as well as a few streets in Canterbury, New Zealand. Closer to the Monaro, New South Wales, Eyre Street, in Kingston, Australian Capital Territory, and Eyre Street in Bungendore, New South Wales, are named for him.

Eyre&#x27;s 1840 expedition was dramatised in the 1962 Australian radio play &quot;Edward John Eyre&quot; by Colin Thiele.

In 1971, the Australian composer Barry Conyngham wrote the opera &quot;Edward John Eyre&quot; using poems by Meredith Oakes and extracts from Eyre&#x27;s &quot;Journals of Expeditions of Discovery&quot;.

<doc id="755359" wikidata="Q617389" url="?curid=755359" title="Rhomboid major muscle">
<text>The rhomboid major is a skeletal muscle of the back that connects the scapula with the vertebrae of the spinal column. It originates from the spinous processes of the thoracic vertebrae T2–T5 and supraspinous ligament; it inserts onto the lower portion of the medial border of the scapula. It acts together with the rhomboid minor to keep the scapula pressed against thoracic wall and to retract the scapula toward the vertebral column.

As the word &quot;rhomboid&quot; suggests, the rhomboid major is diamond-shaped. The &quot;major&quot; in its name indicates that it is the larger of the two rhomboids.

==Structure==

=== Origin ===
The rhomboid major arises from the spinous processes of the thoracic vertebrae T2–T5 as well as the supraspinous ligament.

=== Insertion ===
It inserts on the medial border of the scapula, from about the level of the scapular spine to the scapula&#x27;s inferior angle.
=== Innervation ===

The rhomboid major, like the rhomboid minor, is innervated by the ventral primary ramus via the dorsal scapular nerve (C5).

===Blood supply===
Both rhomboid muscles also derive their arterial blood supply from the dorsal scapular artery.

=== Relations ===
The rhomboid major is considered a superficial back muscle. It is deep to the trapezius, and situated directly inferior to the rhomboid minor.

===Variation===
The two rhomboids are sometimes fused into a single muscle.

==Function==
The rhomboid major helps to hold the scapula (and thus the upper limb) onto the ribcage. Other muscles that perform this function include the serratus anterior and pectoralis minor.

Both rhomboids (major and minor) also act to retract the scapula, pulling it towards the vertebral column.

The rhomboids work collectively with the levator scapulae muscles to elevate the medial border of the scapula, downwardly rotating the scapula with respect to the glenohumeral joint. Antagonists to this function (upward rotators of the scapulae) are the serratus anterior and lower fibers of the trapezius. If the lower fibers are inactive, the serratus anterior and upper trapezius work in tandem with rhomboids and levators to elevate the entire scapula.

==Clinical significance==
If the rhomboid major is torn, wasted, or unable to contract, scapular instability may result. The implications of scapular instability caused by the rhomboid major include scapular winging during scapular protraction, excessive lateral rotation and depression of the scapula, as the antagonistic action by the rhomboid major is absent. With scapular instability, movement in the upper extremity is limited as the scapula cannot guide the desired movement of the arm and shoulders. Pain, discomfort, and limited range of motion of the shoulder are possible implications of scapular instability.

Treatment for scapular instability may include surgery followed by physical therapy or occupational therapy. Physical therapy may consist of stretching and endurance exercises of the shoulder. Pilates and yoga have been also suggested as potential treatment and prevention of scapular instability.

==Other animals==
The muscles of the shoulder can be categorized into three topographic units: the scapulohumeral, axiohumeral, and axioscapular groups. Stretching from the spine to the scapula, rhomboid major forms part of the latter group together with rhomboid minor, serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and trapezius. The trapezius has evolved separately, but the other muscles in this group evolved from the first eight or ten ribs and the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae (homologous to the ribs). Functional demands have resulted in the evolution of individual muscles from the basal unit formed by the serratus anterior.

In early life forms, the main function of the axioscapular group is to control the movements of the vertebral border of the scapula: fibers concerned with the dorsal movement of scapula evolved into the rhomboids, those with ventral motion into serratus anterior, and those with cranial movements into levator scapulae.

<text>In human anatomy, the rhomboid minor is a small skeletal muscle of the back that connects the scapula to the vertebrae of the spinal column. It arises from the nuchal ligament, and the 7th cervical and 1st thoracic vertebrae and intervening supraspinous ligaments; it inserts onto the medial border of the scapula. It is innervated by the dorsal scapular nerve.

It acts together with the rhomboid major to keep the scapula pressed against the thoracic wall.

== Anatomy ==

=== Origin ===
The rhomboid minor arises from the inferior border of the nuchal ligament, from the spinous processes of the vertebrae C7–T1, and from the intervening supraspinous ligaments.

=== Insertion ===
It inserts onto a small area of the medial border of the scapula at the level of the scapular spine.

=== Innervation ===
It is innervated by the dorsal scapular nerve (a branch of the brachial plexus), with most of its fibers derived from the C5 nerve root and only minor contribution from C4 or C6.

=== Blood supply ===
The rhomboid minor receives arterial blood supply from the dorsal scapular artery.

=== Relations ===
It is located inferior to levator scapulae, and superior to rhomboid major.

It lies deep to trapezius, and superficial to the long spinal muscles.

=== Variation ===
It is usually separated from the rhomboid major by a slight interval, but the adjacent margins of the two muscles are occasionally united.

=== Actions/movements ===
Together with the rhomboid major, the rhomboid minor retracts the scapula when trapezius is contracted. Acting as a synergist to the trapezius, the rhomboid major and minor elevate the medial border of the scapula medially and upward, working in tandem with the levator scapulae muscle to rotate the scapulae downward. While other shoulder muscles are active, the rhomboid major and minor stabilize the scapula.

<text>Ion Mihai Pacepa (; 28 October 1928 – 14 February 2021) was a Romanian lieutenant general in the Securitate, the secret police of the Socialist Republic of Romania, who defected to the United States in July 1978 following President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s approval of his request for political asylum. He was the highest-ranking defector from the former Eastern Bloc, and wrote books and articles on the inner workings of communist intelligence services. His best-known works are the books &quot;Disinformation&quot; and &quot;Red Horizons&quot;.

At the time of his defection, Pacepa simultaneously had the rank of advisor to President Nicolae Ceaușescu, acting chief of his foreign intelligence service, and a parliamentary undersecretary at Romania&#x27;s Ministry of Interior.

Subsequently, he worked with the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in operations against the former Eastern Bloc. The CIA described his cooperation as &quot;an important and unique contribution to the United States&quot;.

==Activity in Romanian intelligence==
Ion Mihai Pacepa&#x27;s father (born in 1893) was raised in Alba Iulia, in the Transylvania region in the north west of Romania, where he worked in his father&#x27;s small kitchenware factory. On 1 December 1918, Transylvania united with Romania, and in 1920, Pacepa&#x27;s father moved to Bucharest and worked for the local branch of the American car company General Motors.

Born in Bucharest in 1928, Ion Mihai Pacepa studied industrial chemistry at the Politehnica University of Bucharest between 1947 and 1951, but just months before graduation, he was drafted by the Securitate and gained his engineering degree only four years later. He was assigned to the Directorate of Counter-sabotage of the Securitate. In 1955, he was transferred to the Directorate of Foreign Intelligence.

In 1957, Pacepa was appointed head of the Romanian intelligence station in Frankfurt, West Germany, where he served for two years. In October 1959, Minister of the Interior Alexandru Drăghici appointed him as head of Romania&#x27;s new industrial espionage department, the S&amp;T (short for &quot;Știință și Tehnologie&quot;, meaning &quot;science and technology&quot; in Romanian) of Directorate I. He was the head of Romanian industrial espionage, which he managed until he defected in 1978. Pacepa claimed he was involved with the establishment of Romania&#x27;s automobile industry, and with the development of its microelectronic, polymer, and antibiotic industries.

From 1972 to 1978, Pacepa was also President Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s adviser for industrial and technological development and the deputy chief of the Romanian foreign intelligence service.

==Defection==
Pacepa defected in July 1978 by walking into the US Embassy in Bonn, West Germany, where he had been sent by Ceaușescu with a message to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. He was flown secretly to Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, D.C., in a United States military aircraft.

In a letter to his daughter, Dana, published in the French newspaper in 1980 and broadcast over and over by Radio Free Europe, Pacepa explained the reason for defecting: &quot;In 1978 I got the order to organize the killing of Noël Bernard, the director of Radio Free Europe&#x27;s Romanian program who had infuriated Ceaușescu with his commentaries. It was late July when I got this order, and when I ultimately had to decide between being a good father and being a political criminal. Knowing you, Dana, I was firmly convinced that you would prefer no father to one who was an assassin.&quot;

Noël Bernard died in 1981 of cancer; his wife, , suggested he had been irradiated by the Securitate. She also linked Bernard&#x27;s death to those of RFE journalists such as Cornel Chiriac (stabbed to death), as well as Emil Georgescu and Vlad Georgescu, both of whom also died of cancer. According to Bernard&#x27;s wife, Noël&#x27;s Securitate file had attached an article from a magazine which talks about Noël undergoing surgery, with a note which argues that the article confirms &quot;the measures undertaken by us are starting to have an effect&quot;. Pacepa later claimed a supposed radiological weapon named Radu was used against dissenters and critics by the Securitate. According to Pacepa, &quot;Radu&quot; was a Romanian name used as a reference to &quot;radiation&quot;, with the intention to lead the target to cancer which would result in death within months after the exposure.

Pacepa&#x27;s defection destroyed the intelligence network of communist Romania, and through the revelations of Ceaușescu&#x27;s activity, it affected Ceaușescu&#x27;s international credibility and respectability. An article published by &quot;The American Spectator&quot; in 1988 summed up the devastation caused by Pacepa&#x27;s &quot;spectacular&quot; defection: &quot;His passage from East to West was a historic event, for so carefully had he prepared, and so thorough was his knowledge of the structure, the methods, the objectives, and the operations of Ceaușescu&#x27;s secret service, that within three years the entire organization had been eliminated. Not a single top official was left, not a single major operation was still running. Ceaușescu had a nervous breakdown, and gave orders for Pacepa&#x27;s assassination. At least two squads of murderers have come to the United States to try to find him, and just recently one of Pacepa&#x27;s former agents — a man who had performed minor miracles in stealing Western technology in Europe at Romanian behest — spent several months on the East Coast, trying to track him down. They didn&#x27;t succeed.&quot;

During September 1978, Pacepa received two death sentences from Communist Romania, and Ceaușescu decreed a bounty of US$2 million for his death. Yasser Arafat and Muammar Gaddafi set a further $1 million each. In the 1980s, Romania&#x27;s Securitate enlisted Carlos the Jackal to assassinate Pacepa in the United States in exchange for $1 million. Documents found in the Romanian intelligence archives show that the Securitate had given Carlos a whole arsenal to use in &quot;Operation 363&quot; to assassinate Pacepa in the United States. Included were 37 kg plastic explosive EPP/88, seven submachine guns, one Walther PP pistol serial #249460 with 1306 cartridges, eight Stechkin pistols with 1049 cartridges, and five hand grenades UZRG-M.

Carlos was unable to find Pacepa, but on 21 February 1981, he bombed a part of Radio Free Europe&#x27;s headquarters in Munich, which was broadcasting news of Pacepa&#x27;s defection. Five Romanian diplomats in West Germany, who had helped Carlos the Jackal in this operation, were expelled from the country.

On 7 July 1999, Romania&#x27;s Supreme Court Decision No. 41/1999 cancelled Pacepa&#x27;s death sentences and ordered for his properties, confiscated by Ceaușescu&#x27;s orders, to be returned to him. Romania&#x27;s government refused to comply. In December 2004, the new government of Romania restored Pacepa&#x27;s rank of general.

According to Michael Ledeen in 2016, the two death sentences remained in effect, and Pacepa &quot;has lived in secret&quot; since his defection. Pacepa died in 2021.

==Writings and political views==
Pacepa was a columnist for the Internet conservative blog site &quot;PJ Media&quot;. He also wrote articles for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and American conservative publications, such as &quot;National Review Online&quot;, &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, the online newspaper &quot;FrontPage Magazine&quot;, and &quot;World Net Daily&quot;.

===&quot;Red Horizons&quot;===
In 1987, Pacepa wrote a book published in the United States by Regnery Gateway, &quot;Red Horizons: Chronicles of a Communist Spy Chief&quot;. A Romanian translation of &quot;Red Horizons&quot; printed in the U.S. was infiltrated into Communist Romania, and a Mao-style pocketbook of &quot;Red Horizons&quot; was illegally printed in Communist Hungary (now a valuable collector’s item). In 1988, &quot;Red Horizons&quot; was serialized on Radio Free Europe, arousing &quot;huge interest among Romanians&quot;. According to Radio Romania, &quot;the streets of Romania&#x27;s towns were empty&quot; during the RFE serialization of &quot;Red Horizons&quot;. On 25 December 1989, during the last part of the Romanian Revolution, Ceaușescu and his wife, Elena, were sentenced to death. Pacepa claimed that at the trial most of the accusations came almost word-for-word out of &quot;Red Horizons&quot; (a second edition, published in March 1990, contained the transcript of Ceauşescu&#x27;s trial, which was based on facts presented in &quot;Red Horizons&quot;). President Ronald Reagan reportedly called “Red Horizons” his “Bible” for dealing with dictators.

On 1 January 1990, the book began being serialized in the new official Romanian newspaper &quot;Adevărul&quot; (&quot;The Truth&quot;), which on that day replaced the Communist &quot;Scînteia&quot; (&quot;The Spark&quot;). In its lead, &quot;Adevărul&quot; explained that the book&#x27;s serialization by Radio Free Europe had &quot;played an incontestable role&quot; in overthrowing Ceaușescu, according to the text on the back cover of the book&#x27;s second edition, published during 1990. &quot;Red Horizons&quot; was subsequently republished in 29 countries, and it was made into a documentary movie by the Hungarian TV.

During 1993, Pacepa published &quot;The Kremlin&#x27;s Legacy&quot;. During 1999, he authored the trilogy &quot;The Black Book of the Securitate&quot;, which has become a bestseller in Romania.

===&quot;Looming Disaster&quot;===
The book &quot;Looming Disaster&quot; was written by Pacepa together with Ronald Rychlak. Far-right propaganda website WND introduced it in August 2016, as follows: &quot;This November&#x27;s election spells &#x27;LOOMING DISASTER,&#x27; warns former communist spymaster and disinformation expert, Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa.&quot;

===Alleged assassinations by the KGB===
In a 2006 article, Pacepa describes a conversation he had with Ceaușescu, who told him about &quot;ten international leaders the Kremlin killed or tried to kill&quot;: László Rajk and Imre Nagy from Hungary; Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu and Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej from Romania; Rudolf Slánský and Jan Masaryk from Czechoslovakia; Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran; Palmiro Togliatti from Italy; US President John F. Kennedy; and CCP Chairman Mao Zedong. Pacepa provides some additional details, such as an alleged plot to kill Mao Zedong with the help of Lin Biao organized by the KGB.

===&quot;Programmed to Kill&quot;===

In 2007, Ivan R. Dee published Pacepa&#x27;s book &quot;Programmed to Kill: Lee Harvey Oswald, the Soviet KGB, and the Kennedy Assassination&quot; that argues Lee Harvey Oswald was recruited as a KGB agent. According to Pacepa, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev ordered the assassination of John F. Kennedy, then changed his mind but was unable to stop Oswald. Pacepa wrote that Jack Ruby was subsequently instructed to kill Oswald in order to silence him. The work was said to rely heavily on the work of the Warren Commission, the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and Edward Jay Epstein.

In a review of Pacepa&#x27;s book published in Human Events, Michael Ledeen, former adviser for terrorism to President Ronald Reagan, writes: &quot;A new book from General Ion Mihai Pacepa is cause for celebration, because he is among a tiny handful of people who know a lot about the intelligence services of the Soviet Empire, and because he writes about it with rare lucidity, always with an eye to helping us understand our world. His first book, &#x27;Red Horizons,&#x27; is indubitably the most brilliant portrait of a Communist regime I&#x27;ve ever read. &#x27;Programmed to Kill&#x27; is equally fascinating. Pacepa painstakingly takes us through the documentary evidence, including invaluable material on Soviet bloc cyphers that throws new light on Oswald&#x27;s letters to KGB officers in Washington and Mexico City. … No novelist could have written a more exciting story, made all the more compelling because of Pacepa&#x27;s first-hand involvement in the Russians&#x27; efforts to hide their Oswald connection.&quot; In &quot;H-Net Reviews&quot;, Stan Weeber called &quot;Programmed to Kill&quot; &quot;a superb new paradigmatic work on the death of President Kennedy&quot; and &quot;a &#x27;must read&#x27; for everyone interested in the assassination of President Kennedy.&quot;

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; stated &quot;those inclined to suspect a conspiracy was behind JFK&#x27;s murder will likely remain unpersuaded by Pacepa&#x27;s circumstantial, speculative case&quot; and that &quot;Programmed to Kill&quot; offered &quot;no convincing Soviet motive for the assassination.&quot; According to author Joseph Goulden in &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, Pacepa&#x27;s belated account &quot;rests rather flimsily on circumstantial evidence and supposition.&quot; In a review for &quot;Studies in Intelligence&quot;, Hayden B. Peake called Pacepa&#x27;s theory an &quot;imaginative story&quot; and &quot;implausible&quot;.

===Alleged Soviet role in supporting terrorism in the Middle East===
In a 2006 article written during the Second Lebanon War, Pacepa wrote that the Soviet Union spread anti-Semitic propaganda across the Middle East to increase hatred for Jews, and by extension Israel and America. Pacepa writes that Soviet propagandists set up large party state organizations to infiltrate thousands of agents of change into the Arab and Muslim world to instill the idea of America as a &quot;Jewish fiefdom&quot; and spread the idea that Israel planned to make the Islamic Middle East into a &quot;Jewish colony.&quot; Furthermore, he describes the Soviet Union&#x27;s alleged role in propagating and funding terrorist groups in the Middle East. He published a book outlining these operations with its name taken from the program itself: Operation SIG. 

===Alleged Soviet campaign against the Vatican===
Pacepa alleged that the Soviet Union tried to discredit the Papacy. In a 2007 article, he stated: &quot;In my other life, when I was at the center of Moscow&#x27;s foreign-intelligence wars, I myself was caught up in a deliberate Kremlin effort to smear the Vatican, by portraying Pope Pius XII as a coldhearted Nazi sympathizer.&quot;

In 2012, Pacepa revealed he was writing a book called &quot;Disinformation&quot; that gives details of the Seat 12 plot and the Soviet &quot;science&quot; of framing. It is co-authored by Pius XII expert and professor of law at the University of Mississippi, Ronald J. Rychlak. In an interview, Pacepa claimed that the original idea to blacken the Pontiff&#x27;s reputation came from Joseph Stalin in 1945, who wanted the Church out of Ukraine. On 3 June 1945, his Radio Moscow proclaimed that Pius XII had been &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Pope.&quot; But the insinuation fell flat as it came the day after Pius XII had condemned the &quot;Satanic spectre of Nazism&quot; on Vatican Radio. Moreover, Pius was being lauded for his wartime efforts to protect religious minorities by, among others, President Roosevelt, Winston Churchill (who described him as &quot;the greatest man of our time&quot;), and Albert Einstein. Stalin&#x27;s disinformation efforts were rejected by that contemporary generation &quot;that had lived through the real history and knew who Pope Pius XII really was,&quot; Pacepa explained. He said the KGB tried again, promoting Rolf Hochhuth&#x27;s 1963 play &quot;The Deputy&quot;. As that generation &quot;had not lived through that history and did not know better, [this] time it worked.&quot;

===&quot;Disinformation&quot;===
In 2013, Pacepa published &quot;Disinformation: Former Spy Chief Reveals Secret Strategies for Undermining Freedom, Attacking Religion, and Promoting Terrorism&quot; co-authored with law professor Ronald J. Rychlak, who studies the history of religion, and which would become his most recognizable work.

===Iraq and WMD===

Pacepa supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In opposition, large anti-war demonstrations were held in cities across the world. Pacepa contends that these protests were contrived and anti-American, which Russia assisted. Pacepa wrote during October 2003 that it was &quot;perfectly obvious to me&quot; that the Russian GRU agency helped Saddam Hussein to destroy, hide, or transfer his chemical weapons prior to the American invasion of Iraq during 2003. He claimed that an operation for the removal of chemical weapons (&quot;Operation Sarindar&quot;) had been prepared by the Soviet Union for Libya and that such a plan was being implemented in Iraq.

==In popular culture==
In May 2023 HBO launched a TV series titled Spy/Master inspired by the story of Pacepa&#x27;s defection in the late 1970s. The events are heavily dramatized and many character names have been changed, including Pacepa, who is represented by a character named Victor Godeanu. The series has a multi-national cast, with dialogue recorded in Romanian as well as English, German, Russian, and Egyptian Arabic, with subtitles. There is also a version completely overdubbed in English.

==Death==
Pacepa died from COVID-19 on 14 February 2021, at age 92, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. His life was discussed on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s obituary programme &quot;Last Word&quot; .

<doc id="755375" wikidata="Q532798" url="?curid=755375" title="Pectoralis major">
<text>The pectoralis major () is a thick, fan-shaped or triangular convergent muscle of the human chest. It makes up the bulk of the chest muscles and lies under the breast. Beneath the pectoralis major is the pectoralis minor muscle.

The pectoralis major arises from parts of the clavicle and sternum, costal cartilages of the true ribs, and the aponeurosis of the abdominal external oblique muscle; it inserts onto the lateral lip of the bicipital groove. It receives double motor innervation from the medial pectoral nerve and the lateral pectoral nerve. The pectoralis major&#x27;s primary functions are flexion, adduction, and internal rotation of the humerus. The pectoral major may colloquially be referred to as &quot;pecs&quot;, &quot;pectoral muscle&quot;, or &quot;chest muscle&quot;, because it is the largest and most superficial muscle in the chest area.

==Structure==

=== Origin ===
It arises from the anterior surface of the sternal half of the clavicle from breadth of the half of the anterior surface of the sternum, as low down as the attachment of the cartilage of the sixth or seventh rib; from the cartilages of all the true ribs, with the exception, frequently, of the first or seventh, and from the aponeurosis of the abdominal external oblique muscle.

=== Insertion ===
From this extensive origin the fibers converge toward their insertion; those arising from the clavicle pass obliquely downward and outwards (laterally), and are usually separated from the rest by a slight interval; those from the lower part of the sternum, and the cartilages of the lower true ribs, run upward and laterally, while the middle fibers pass horizontally.

They all end in a flat tendon, about 5 cm in breadth, which is inserted into the lateral lip of the bicipital groove (intertubercular sulcus) of the humerus.

This tendon consists of two laminae, placed one in front of the other, and usually blended together below:
* The anterior lamina, which is thicker, receives the clavicular and the uppermost sternal fibers. They are inserted in the same order as that in which they arise: the most lateral of the clavicular fibers are inserted at the upper part of the anterior lamina; the uppermost sternal fibers pass down to the lower part of the lamina which extends as low as the tendon of the Deltoid and joins with it.
* The posterior lamina of the tendon receives the attachment of the greater part of the sternal portion and the deep fibers, i.e., those from the costal cartilages.

These deep fibers, particularly those from the lower costal cartilages, ascend the humerus insertion higher, turning backward successively behind the superficial and upper ones, so that the tendon appears to be twisted. The posterior lamina reaches higher on the humerus than the anterior one, and it gives an expansion which covers the intertubercular groove of the humerus and blends with the capsule of the shoulder-joint.

From the deepest fibers of this lamina at its insertion, an expansion is given off which lines the intertubercular groove, while from the lower border of the tendon, a third expansion passes downward to the fascia of the arm.

===Nerve supply===
The pectoralis major receives dual motor innervation by the medial pectoral nerve and the lateral pectoral nerve, also known as the lateral anterior thoracic nerve. The sternal head receives innervation from the C7, C8 and T1 nerve roots, via the lower trunk of the brachial plexus and the medial pectoral nerve. The clavicular head receives innervation from the C5 and C6 nerve roots via the upper trunk and lateral cord of the brachial plexus, which gives off the lateral pectoral nerve. The lateral pectoral nerve is distributed over the deep surface of the pectoralis major.

The sensory feedback from the pectoralis major follows the reverse path, returning via first-order neurons to the spinal nerves at C5, C6, C8, and T1 through the posterior rami. After the synapse in the posterior horn of the spinal cord, sensory information concerning movement of the muscle, proprioception, and pressure then travels through a second-order neuron in the dorsal column medial lemniscus tract to the medulla. There, the fibers decussate to form the medial lemniscus which carries the sensory information the rest of the way to the thalamus, the &quot;gateway to the cortex&quot;. The thalamus diverts some sensory information to the cerebellum and the basal nuclei to complete the motor feedback loop while some sensory information ascends directly to the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe of the brain via third-order neurons. Sensory information for the pectoralis major is processed in the superior portion of the sensory homunculus, adjacent to the longitudinal fissure which divides the two hemispheres of the brain.

Electromyography suggests that it consists of at least six groups of muscle fibres that can be independently coordinated by the central nervous system.

===Variation===
The more frequent variations include greater or less extent of attachment to the ribs and sternum, varying size of the abdominal part or its absence, greater or less extent of separation of sternocostal and clavicular parts, fusion of clavicular part with deltoid, and decussation in front of the sternum. Deficiency or absence of the sternocostal part is not uncommon and more frequent than absence of the clavicular part. 

Poland syndrome is a rare congenital condition in which the whole muscle is missing, most commonly on one side of the body. This may accompany absence of the breast in females. The sternalis muscle may be a variant form of the pectoralis major or the rectus abdominis. [Submuscular and intramuscular surgical implants (similar to breast augmentation implants) may be available from plastic surgeons to modify aesthetic contours, mass, and asymmetry or variation in both males and females.]

==Function==
The pectoralis major has four actions which are primarily responsible for movement of the shoulder joint. 

# The first action is flexion of the humerus, as in throwing a ball underhand, and in lifting a child. 
# Secondly, it adducts the humerus, as when flapping the arms. 
# Thirdly, it rotates the humerus medially, as occurs when arm-wrestling. 
# Fourthly the pectoralis major is also responsible for keeping the arm attached to the trunk of the body. 

It has two different parts which are responsible for different actions. 

* The clavicular part is close to the deltoid muscle and contributes to flexion, horizontal adduction, and inward rotation of the humerus. When at an approximately 110-degree angle, it contributes to adduction of the humerus. 
* The sternocostal part is antagonistic to the clavicular part contributing to downward and forward movement of the arm and inward rotation when accompanied by adduction. The sternal fibers can also contribute to extension, but not beyond anatomical position.

Hypertrophy of the pectoralis major increases functionality. Maximal activation of the pectoralis major occurs in the transverse plane through pressing motions. Both multi-joint and single-joint exercises induce pectoralis major hypertrophy. A combination of both single-joint and multi-joint exercises will result in a maximum hypertrophic response. [Aesthetic contours of regions in the muscle may be specifically addressed (“targeted”) by specific exercises; for instance, “plating” or “stitching” of the pectoralis major —towards the center of the sternum —-may be targeted by a wider hand position.] The pectoralis major can be targeted from numerous training angles along the sternum and clavicle. Exercises that include horizontal adduction and elbow extensions such as the barbell bench press, dumbbell bench press, and machine bench press induce high activation of the pectoralis major in the sternocostal region. Heavy loads are strongly correlated with pectoralis major activation.

==Clinical significance==

===Injuries and imaging===

Tears of the pectoralis major are rare and typically affect otherwise healthy individuals. This type of injury is known to affect the athletic population, namely in high-impact contact sports such as powerlifting, and may result in pain, weakness, and disability. Most lesions are located at the musculotendinous junction and result from violent, eccentric contraction of the muscle, such as during bench press. A less frequent rupture site is the muscle belly, usually as a result of a direct blow. In developed countries, most lesions occur in male athletes, especially those practicing contact sports and weight-lifting (particularly during a bench press maneuver). Women are less susceptible to these tears because of larger tendon-to-muscle diameter, greater muscular elasticity, and less energetic injuries. The injury is characterized by sudden and acute pain in the chest wall and shoulder area, bruising and loss of strength of the muscle. High grade partial or full thickness tears warrant surgical repair as the preferred treatment if function is to be preserved, particularly in the athletic population.

Acting fast, obtaining the correct diagnoses, and getting the surgical repair as soon as possible is a key to successful recovery. Waiting can cause the acute injury to become chronic and chances of success is greatly diminished as a result. After surgery, the impacted arm is then immobilized with a sling for about six to eight weeks to minimize and avoid movement of the arm and potentially re-rupturing the surgery site. About two months after the surgery, physical therapy is typically introduced for about six months, after which point strengthening of the muscle is needed to achieve good results. Most patients are able to return to activity after six months to a year following surgery with high patient satisfaction and slightly reduced strength compared to pre-injury. Both US and MRI are useful to confirm the diagnosis, location and extent of a tear, though the first may be more cost-effective in experienced hands.

===Poland syndrome===
Poland syndrome is a congenital anomaly in which there is a malformation of the chest causing the pectoralis major on one side of the body to be absent. Other characteristics of this disease are &quot;unilateral shortening of the index, long, and ring fingers, syndactyly of the affected digits, hypoplasia of the hand, and the absence of the sternocostal portion of the ipsilateral pectoralis major muscle&quot;. Although the absence of a pectoralis major is not life-threatening, it will have an effect on the person with Poland&#x27;s syndrome. Adduction and medial rotation of the arm will be much harder to accomplish without the pectoralis major. The latissimus dorsi and teres major also aid in adduction and medial rotation of the arm, so they may be able to compensate for the lack of extra muscle. However, some patients with Poland&#x27;s syndrome may also be lacking these muscles, which make these actions nearly impossible.

Researchers from the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at the Yonsei University College of Medicine in Seoul, Korea reported a case of congenital absence of pectoralis major in 1990. According to Kakulas and Adams, pectoralis major is the most frequently congenitally absent muscle. The case involved a 22-year-old marine who had asymmetrical configuration of chest wall who had never experienced difficulties performing daily activities, but who experienced difficulties in the military camp. He had difficulty in some training activities especially those such as throwing a grenade or rope climbing. During a surgery performed to correct the sternal depression, it was found that the right pectoralis major was totally absent. However, previous physical exams did not show deficiencies in muscle strength as the right shoulder was good for flexion, adduction, horizontal adduction and internal rotation. Moreover, his pain and touch sensation were normal. X-rays were also performed and showed normal pictures of the chest&#x27;s bones. The fact that the absence of pectoralis major did not cause functional loss in ordinary activities in this case of congenital absence showed that other surrounding muscles played a compensatory role.

===Other diseases===
Pectoralis major muscle in rare occasions may develop intramuscular lipomas. Such rare tumors may mimic malignant breast tumors as they look like enlargements of the breasts. They are well-encapsulated radiolucent tumours of fat density. Their location can be accurately identified through computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The treatment in these cases involves complete surgical excision because of the risk of liposarcoma they post especially large intramuscular liposomas. Partial excision is risky because recurrence may occur.

<doc id="755386" wikidata="Q57777" url="?curid=755386" title="Levin August von Bennigsen">
<text>Levin August Gottlieb Theophil, Graf von Bennigsen (, as well in ; 10 February 1745 – 3 December 1826) was a German general in the service of the Russian Empire. Bennigsen made a name for himself in Russian history as the man who fought Napoleon Bonaparte with distinction at the Battle of Eylau; but, suffering from ill-health, he was then defeated at Friedland several months later. Bennigsen also played a pivotal role in decisively defeating Napoleon in the War of the Sixth Coalition.

==Biography==
===Early service===
Bennigsen was born on 10 February 1745 into a Hanoverian noble family in Braunschweig (English toponym: Brunswick). His family owned several estates at Banteln in Hanover. Bennigsen served successively as a page at the Hanoverian court and as an officer of foot-guards, and four years later, in 1763, as captain, he participated in the final campaign of the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1764, after the death of his father and his marriage to Baroness Steinberg, he retired from the Hanoverian Army, and settled at the estates he owned in Banteln. In 1773, shortly after reentering Hanoverian service for a brief period, he entered the Russian service as a field officer, and was subsequently accepted into the Vyatka musketeer regiment in the same year. He fought against the Turks in 1774 and in 1778, becoming lieutenant-colonel in the latter year. In 1787 his conduct at the storming of Ochakov won him promotion to the rank of brigadier, and he distinguished himself repeatedly in smashing the Kościuszko Uprising (battles of Lipniszki, Soły) and in the Persian War of 1796 where he fought at Derbent. On 9 July 1794, he was promoted to major general for his accomplishments in the former campaign, and on 26 September 1794 he was awarded the Order of St. George of the Third Degree and an estate in Minsk Governorate.

In 1798, Bennigsen was fired from military service by Tsar Paul I allegedly because of his connections with Platon Zubov. It is known that he took an active part in the planning phase of the conspiracy to assassinate Paul I, but his role in the actual killing remains a matter of conjecture. Tsar Alexander I made him governor-general of Lithuania in 1801, and in 1802 a general of cavalry.

===Napoleonic Wars===
In 1806, Bennigsen was in command of one of the Russian armies operating against Napoleon, when he fought the Battle of Pultusk and met the emperor in person in the bloody battle of Eylau (8 February 1807). In the Battle of Pultusk he resisted French troops under Jean Lannes before retreating. This brought him the Order of St. George of the Second Degree while after the battle of Eylau he was awarded Order of St. Andrew — the highest order in the Russian empire. Here he could claim to have inflicted the first reverse suffered by Napoleon, but six months later Bennigsen met with the crushing defeat of Friedland (14 June 1807) the direct consequence of which was the treaty of Tilsit.

Bennigsen was heavily criticised for the Battle of Friedland and for the decline of discipline in the army and now retired for some years, but in the campaign of 1812 he reappeared in the army in various responsible positions. He was present at Borodino, and defeated Murat in the engagement of Tarutino where he was wounded in the leg, but on account of a quarrel with Marshal Kutuzov, the Russian commander-in-chief, he was compelled to retire from active military employment on 15 November.


After the death of Kutuzov, Bennigsen was recalled and placed at the head of an army. Bennigsen participated in the battles of Bautzen and Lützen, leading one of the columns that made the decisive attack on the last day of the Battle of Leipzig (16–19 October 1813). On the same evening he was made a count by the emperor Alexander I, and he afterwards commanded the forces which operated against Marshal Davout in North Germany, most notably in the year-long Siege of Hamburg (1813–14). After the Treaty of Fontainebleau, he was awarded the St. George order of the First Degree — the highest Russian military order – for his actions in the Napoleonic wars in general.

===Later life===
After the general peace Bennigsen held a command from 1815 to 1818, when he retired from active service and settled on his Hanoverian estate of Banteln near Hildesheim. By the end of his life he completely lost his sight. He died on 3 December 1826, in Banteln, eight years after he had retired. His son, Count &quot;Alexander Levin von Bennigsen&quot; (1809-1893) was a distinguished Hanoverian statesman.

Bennigsen wrote the three-volume &quot;Mémoires du général Bennigsen&quot;, which was published in Paris in 1907-1908. Though they contain &quot;fascinating&quot; details regarding the Russian wars and battles between 1806 and 1813, the work often beautifies historical facts. English edition of Bennigsen&#x27;s memoirs of 1806-1807 campaign appeared in 2023.

<doc id="755393" wikidata="Q3774177" url="?curid=755393" title="Adrenarche">
<text>Adrenarche is an early stage in sexual maturation that happens in some higher primates (including humans), typically peaks at around 20 years of age, and is involved in the development of pubic hair, body odor, skin oiliness, axillary hair, sexual attraction/sexual desire/increased libido and mild acne. During adrenarche the adrenal glands secrete increased levels of weak adrenal androgens, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (A4), but without increased cortisol levels. Adrenarche is the result of the development of a new zone of the adrenal cortex, the zona reticularis. Adrenarche is a process related to puberty, but distinct from hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) maturation and function.

==Occurrence==
Adrenarche occurs starting at the age of 6 years. After the first year of life, the adrenal glands secrete very low levels of adrenal androgens. Adrenarche begins on average between age 5 to 8 in girls and between 7 and 11 in boys, and precedes puberty by about 2 years. Unlike the physical changes that occur during puberty, adrenarche is primarily an emotional and psychological stage of development. It continues throughout puberty, with adrenal androgen levels progressively increasing until reaching maximal levels in young adulthood, around the age of 20 years. Circulating DHEA-S levels specifically peak in humans at about age 19 or 20 years in females and around age 20 to 24 years in males. Levels of corticosteroids like cortisol do not change with adrenarche. Biological messengers during the onset of adrenarche are thought to signal in preparation for puberty.

==Role in puberty==
An initiator of adrenarche has not yet been identified. Researchers have unsuccessfully tried to identify a new pituitary peptide, to be called &quot;adrenal androgen stimulating hormone&quot;. Others have proposed that adrenarchal maturation is a gradual process intrinsic to the adrenal glands that has no distinct trigger. A third avenue of research is pursuing a possible relationship with either fetal or childhood body mass and related signals such as insulin and leptin. Many children born small for gestational age (SGA) because of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) have an earlier onset of adrenarche, which raises the possibility that timing of adrenarche may be affected by physiological programming in infancy. Adrenarche also occurs prematurely in many children who are overweight, suggesting a possible relationship with body mass or adiposity signals.

The principal physical consequences of adrenarche are androgen effects, especially pubic hair (in which Tanner stage 2 becomes Tanner stage 3) and the change of sweat composition that produces adult body odor. Increased oiliness of the skin and hair and mild acne may occur. Pubic hair caused by adrenarche is usually transient and will disappear right before the onset of puberty. In most boys, these changes are indistinguishable from early testicular testosterone effects occurring at the beginning of gonadal puberty. In girls, the adrenal androgens of adrenarche produce most of the early androgenic changes of puberty: pubic hair, body odor, skin oiliness, and acne. In most girls the early androgen effects coincide with, or are a few months following, the earliest estrogenic effects of gonadal puberty (breast development and growth acceleration). As female puberty progresses, the ovaries and peripheral tissues become more important sources of androgens.

Parents and many physicians often infer (incorrectly) the onset of puberty from the first appearance of pubic hair (termed pubarche). However, the independence of adrenarche and gonadal puberty is apparent in children with atypical or abnormal development, when one process may occur without the other. For instance, adrenarche does not occur in many girls with Addison&#x27;s disease, who will continue to have minimal pubic hair as puberty progresses. Conversely, girls with Turner syndrome will have normal adrenarche and normal pubic hair development, but true gonadal puberty never occurs because their ovaries are abnormal.

==Premature adrenarche==
Premature adrenarche is the most common cause of the early appearance of pubic hair (&quot;premature pubarche&quot;) in childhood. In a large proportion of children it seems to be a variation of normal development requiring no treatment. However, there are three clinical issues related to premature adrenarche.

First, when pubic hair appears at an unusually early age in a child, premature adrenarche should be distinguished from true central precocious puberty, from congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and from androgen-producing tumors of the adrenals or gonads. Pediatric endocrinologists do this by demonstrating pubertal levels of DHEA-S and other adrenal androgens, with prepubertal levels of gonadotropins and gonadal sex steroids.

Second, there is some evidence that premature adrenarche may indicate that there was an abnormality of the intrauterine energy environment and of intrauterine growth. As mentioned above, premature adrenarche occurs more often in children with intrauterine growth retardation and in overweight children. Some of these same studies have demonstrated that some girls who display premature adrenarche may continue to have excessive androgen levels in adolescence. This can result in hirsutism or menstrual irregularities due to anovulation, referred to as polycystic ovary syndrome.

Third, at least one report from 2008 found an increased incidence of behavior and school problems in a group of children with premature adrenarche compared with an otherwise similar control group. To date, such a relationship has neither been confirmed nor explained and there are no obvious management implications.

==Other primates==
Adrenarche occurs in only a small number of primates, and only chimpanzees and gorillas show a pattern of adrenarche development similar to humans.

<doc id="755400" wikidata="Q3306808" url="?curid=755400" title="Orthogonal basis">
<text>In mathematics, particularly linear algebra, an orthogonal basis for an inner product space formula_1 is a basis for formula_1 whose vectors are mutually orthogonal. If the vectors of an orthogonal basis are normalized, the resulting basis is an &quot;orthonormal basis&quot;.

== As coordinates ==
Any orthogonal basis can be used to define a system of orthogonal coordinates formula_3 Orthogonal (not necessarily orthonormal) bases are important due to their appearance from curvilinear orthogonal coordinates in Euclidean spaces, as well as in Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.

== In functional analysis ==
In functional analysis, an orthogonal basis is any basis obtained from an orthonormal basis (or Hilbert basis) using multiplication by nonzero scalars.

== Extensions ==

=== Symmetric bilinear form ===
The concept of an orthogonal basis is applicable to a vector space formula_1 (over any field) equipped with a symmetric bilinear form , where &quot;orthogonality&quot; of two vectors formula_5 and formula_6 means . For an orthogonal basis :
formula_7
where formula_8 is a quadratic form associated with formula_9 formula_10 (in an inner product space, ).

Hence for an orthogonal basis , 
formula_11
where formula_12 and formula_13 are components of formula_5 and formula_6 in the basis.

=== Quadratic form ===
The concept of orthogonality may be extended to a vector space over any field of characteristic not 2 equipped with a quadratic form . Starting from the observation that, when the characteristic of the underlying field is not 2, the associated symmetric bilinear form formula_16 allows vectors formula_5 and formula_6 to be defined as being orthogonal with respect to formula_8 when .

<text>This is the history of Croatia since the end of the Croatian War of Independence.

== Tuđman: peacetime presidency (1995–1999) ==
In November 1995 the war in Croatia ended. Around 20,000 people were killed in the war, while official figures on wartime damage published in Croatia in 1996 specify 180,000 destroyed housing units, 25% of the Croatian economy destroyed, and US$27 billion of material damage. &quot;Europe Review 2003/04&quot; estimated the war damage at US$37 billion in damaged infrastructure, lost economic output, and refugee-related costs, while GDP dropped 21% in the period. 15 percent of housing units and 2,423 cultural heritage structures, including 495 sacral structures, were destroyed or damaged. The war imposed an additional economic burden of very high military expenditures. By 1994, as Croatia rapidly developed into a de facto war economy, the military consumed as much as 60 percent of total government spending.

Following the end of the war, parliamentary elections were held in 1995, which resulted in a victory of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union. Zlatko Mateša became the new prime minister of Croatia, replacing Nikica Valentić, and formed the first peacetime government of independent Croatia. Elections for the Zagreb Assembly were held at the same time, which were won by the opposition. This led to the Zagreb crisis since the president refused to provide formal confirmation to the opposition parties proposed Mayor of Zagreb. On Halloween 1995 under the pretext of alleged &quot;drug addicts causing riots&quot; in the city, Tuđman&#x27;s police brutally dispersed Halloween punk concert in town of Samobor. The police severely beat and fired weapons at mostly young concert attendees, and in some cases even brutally beat accidental bystanders. In 1996 mass demonstrations were held in Zagreb in response to revoking broadcasting license to Radio 101, a radio station that was critical towards the ruling party.

As a result of the macro-stabilization programs, the negative growth of GDP during the early 1990s stopped and turned into a positive trend. Post-war reconstruction activity provided another impetus to growth. Consumer spending and private sector investments, both of which were postponed during the war, contributed to the growth in 1995-97 and improved economic conditions. Real GDP growth in 1995 was 6,8%, in 1996 5,9% and in 1997 6,6%.

In 1995 a Ministry of Privatization was established with Ivan Penić as its first minister. Privatization in Croatia had barely begun when war broke out in 1991 and its transformation from a planned economy to a market economy was thus slow and unsteady. The ruling party was criticised for transferring enterprises to a group of privileged owners connected to the party.

Croatia became a member of the Council of Europe on 6 November 1996. President of Croatia Franjo Tuđman won the 1997 presidential elections with 61.4% of the votes and was re-elected to a second five-year term. Marina Matulović-Dropulić became the Mayor of Zagreb having won the 1997 local elections, which formally ended the Zagreb crisis.

The remaining part of former Republic of Serbian Krajina, areas adjacent to FR Yugoslavia, negotiated a peaceful reintegration process with the Croatian Government. The so-called Erdut Agreement made the area a temporary protectorate of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium. The area was formally re-integrated into Croatia on 15 January 1998. On 3 October 1998 Pope John Paul II beatified Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac.

Value-added tax was introduced in 1998 and the central government budget was in surplus that year. At the end of 1998 Croatia went into a recession and GDP growth slowed down to 1,9%. The recession continued throughout 1999 when GDP fell by 0,9%. Unemployment increased from around 10% in 1996 and 1997 to 11,4% in 1998. By the end of 1999 it reached 13,6%. The country emerged from the recession in the 4th quarter of 1999.

== Račan government (2000–2003) ==
Tuđman died in 1999 and in the early 2000 parliamentary elections, the nationalist Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) government was replaced by a center-left coalition, with Ivica Račan as prime minister. At the same time, presidential elections were held which were won by a moderate, Stjepan Mesić.The new Račan government amended the Constitution, changing the political system from a semi-presidential system to a parliamentary system, transferring most executive presidential powers from the president onto the institutions of the Parliament and the Prime Minister. Nevertheless, the President remained the Commander-in-Chief, and notably used this power in response to the Twelve Generals&#x27; Letter.

Economic growth picked up in 2000 following the recession. The new government started several large building projects, including state-sponsored housing and the building of the vital Zagreb-Split Highway, today&#x27;s A1. Economic growth in the 2000s was stimulated by a credit boom led by newly privatized banks, capital investment, especially in road construction, a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer spending. Inflation remained tame and the currency, the kuna, stable.
The country rebounded from a mild recession in 1998/1999 and achieved notable economic growth during the following years. The unemployment rate would continue to rise until 2001 when it finally started falling. Return of refugees accelerated as many homes were rebuilt by the government; most Croats had already returned (except for some in Vukovar), whereas only a third of the Serbs had done so, impeded by unfavorable property laws as well as ethnic and economic issues.

The Račan government is often credited with bringing Croatia out of semi-isolation of the Tuđman era. Croatia became a World Trade Organization (WTO) member on 30 November 2000. The country signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Union in October 2001, and applied for membership in February/March 2003. Račan&#x27;s government was undermined by right wing HDZ who organized mass opposition rallies against Croatian collaboration with ICTY. In one such rally in Split HDZ&#x27;s leader Ivo Sanader accused prime minister Račan and Mesić for treason for wanting to extradite Croatian officers, while they, in turn accused the rallyists for preparing coup d&#x27;etat.

== Sanader government (2003–2009) ==
In late 2003, new parliamentary elections were held and a reformed HDZ party won under leadership of Ivo Sanader, who became prime minister. After winning elections Sanader chose to form the new government in coalition with Serb minority, rather than with far right nationalist parties. Sanader also took his government on a strong pro-European course. After some delay caused by controversy over extradition of army generals to the ICTY, in 2004 the European Commission finally issued a recommendation that the accession negotiations with Croatia should begin. Its report on Croatia described it as a modern democratic society with a competent economy and the ability to take on further obligations, provided it continued the reform process.

The country was given EU applicant status on 18 June 2004 and a negotiations framework was set up in March 2005. Actual negotiations began after the capture of general Ante Gotovina in December 2005, which resolved outstanding issues with the ICTY in the Hague. Despite Sanader&#x27;s earlier rhetoric against extradiction of Croatian generals to the ICTY it was, in fact, his government that extradited Gotovina to ICTY. Numerous other complications also stalled the negotiating process, most notably during Slovenia&#x27;s blockade of Croatia&#x27;s EU accession from December 2008 until September 2009.

In August 2007, Croatia experienced a tragedy when during the fires that ravaged its coast, 12 firemen died as a result of a fire on Kornat island.

Sanader was reelected in the closely contested 2007 parliamentary election.

The October 2008 assassination of Ivo Pukanić was one of several prominent murders in Croatia at the time which were attributed to organized crime and associated by the media with an increased occurrence of crime in Zagreb in 2008. In March 2008, an 18-year-old Bad Blue Boys football fan was killed in the Ribnjak Park, followed by a retaliation by other BBB members. A mob beating at a bus stop in the high-traffic Većeslav Holjevac Avenue ensued, with deadly consequences for 18-year-old Luka Ritz. The October 2008 murder of Ivana Hodak, the daughter of Zvonimir Hodak, the lawyer who defended alleged war profiteer general Vladimir Zagorec, caused the Prime Minister Ivo Sanader to fire Marijan Benko, chief of Zagreb Police Department, Berislav Rončević, Minister of Internal Affairs and Ana Lovrin, Minister of Justice. Rončević was replaced by Tomislav Karamarko and Lovrin by Ivan Šimonović. In February 2009, the Hodak murder was attributed by the police to a homeless unemployed man blaming Zvonimir Hodak for his problems in life.

In June 2009, Sanader abruptly resigned his post, leaving scarce explanation for his actions. As written by Florian Bieber, the explanation came in 2010 when Sanader fled to Austria due to fear of being charged for corruption. He was eventually extradited back to Croatia. In the ensuing court hearing, it was discovered that Sanadar possessed the collection of luxurious watches, luxurious villa and collection of arts, none of which could be afforded legally from salaries of Croatian public sector. In November 2012, he was sentenced to ten years in prison, which was later reduced to eight and half years. In 2015, this sentence was annulled for procedural errors, but before his re-trial could begin, he was sentenced to four and half years in prison for another corruption case. Therefore, Bieber concludes, it turned out that pro-European reforms which Sanader had initiated created institutions such as USKOK which eventually sentenced him and played a prominent role in his downfall. Bieber claims that HDZ&#x27;s orientation towards pro-European course became key for Croatia&#x27;s successful transition towards consolidated democracy, while one of its key actors Ivo Sanader became &quot;a victim&quot; of democratic institutions he had helped to create.

== Kosor government (2009–2011) == 
Jadranka Kosor assumed the head of the government following Sanader&#x27;s resignation. Kosor continued with her predecessor&#x27;s policy of integration into European Union She also had to introduce austerity measures to counter the consequences of 2008 economic crisis and launched the anti-corruption campaign aimed at public officials.

Jadranka Kosor signed an agreement with Borut Pahor, the premier of Slovenia, in November 2009, that ended Slovenia&#x27;s blockade of Croatia&#x27;s EU accession and allowed Croatian EU entry negotiations to proceed.

In the first round of the 2010 presidential election the HDZ candidate Andrija Hebrang achieved an embarrassing 12% claiming third place, the lowest result for an HDZ presidential candidate ever. Ivo Josipović, the candidate of the largest opposition party, the Social Democratic Party of Croatia, won a landslide victory in the resulting runoff on 10 January.

Ivo Sanader tried to come back in HDZ in early 2010, but was then ejected, charged for corruption by authorities, and later arrested in Austria.

In June 2010, Kosor proposed loosening the labor law and making it more business friendly, in order to foster economic growth. The proposed new labour law would have set a six-month deadline for hammering out a new collective agreement after the existing one expires. After that, the workers&#x27; rights would be subject to separate agreements with individual employers instead. The changing of the labour law was greatly opposed by five trade unions: a petition demanding a referendum gathered 813,016 signatures, far more than the required 449,506 signatures (10 percent of all voters in Croatia), in the first successful popular referendum attempt.

Opinion polling was done for the prospective referendum: an Ipsos Puls for Nova TV poll of 8 July 2010 at a sample of 646 indicated 64% would support the referendum, 15% would be against, and 21% were undecided.
CRO Demoskop also polled on the matter on 1 and 2 July at a sample of 1300, and found 88.6% of the polled would support it.

After the Ministry of Administration completed its examination of the signatures, the Croatian Government first hinted that of all submitted signatures, no more than 330 thousand are valid, which would be insufficient for starting a referendum. After a public backlash, they nevertheless passed the signatures on to the Parliament. The government then decided to withdraw the reform proposals on 3 September 2010. The Croatian Parliament could not decide conclusively whether this rendered the referendum proposal moot or not, and instead passed the judgement on to the Constitutional Court of Croatia. The court decided on 20 October 2010 that there was no longer any need to hold the referendum. It ordered the government not to subject any changes to the labor law in the following year.

The government and labour unions later agreed that there would be a different referendum instead, asking the question &quot;Do you agree that a referendum must be called if so requested by 200,000 registered voters, and that the time for the collection of the required number of voters&#x27; signatures should be 30 days?&quot;. It was planned to be held at the same time as the EU accession referendum, but did not happen.

The 2011 Croatian protests were anti-government street protests in Croatia started on 22 February 2011, after a call to protest over the Internet, and continued almost daily. The protests brought together diverse political persuasions in response to recent government corruption scandals and worries regarding upcoming EU accession, and called for the resignation of Kosor and early elections. They were met by a violent police reaction and a ban on assembly in front of the Croatian Parliament in Zagreb. On 26 February, tens of thousands of protesters met in the Croatian capital Zagreb&#x27;s Ban Jelačić Square to express their support for indicted Croatian War of Independence veterans and demand for Kosor&#x27;s government to resign. Several dozen people were injured and arrested as anti-government protests degenerated into clashes with police.
In the following few weeks the number of protesters rose to some 10,000 people, but later the protests gradually stopped.

On 30 June 2011 the EU accession agreement was concluded, giving Croatia the all-clear to join, with a projected accession date of 1 July 2013.

== Milanović government (2011–2016) == 

The 2011 Croatian parliamentary election was held on 4 December 2011, and the Kukuriku coalition won. Zoran Milanović became the prime minister of the coalition government.

In January 2012, the new government organized a referendum for EU membership that passed with 66.27%. After the referendum, the Sabor ratified the accession treaty, the Treaty of Accession 2011.

The Milanović cabinet endured a major change when the first deputy prime minister Radimir Čačić resigned in November 2012, having been convicted of vehicular manslaughter in Hungary.

In the Trial of Gotovina et al, following an initial guilty verdict in April 2011, Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač were ultimately acquitted in November 2012. Mirjan Damaška, a law professor at the University of Yale stated for the occasion that the theory about the &quot;joint criminal enterprise&quot; would have caused historical, political and law complications for Croatia, but that, as a result of the appeal, Croatia&#x27;s founding has been internationally recognized as legal via its Operation Storm offensive.

Following the successful ratification of its accession treaty in all existing EU member states, Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013.

Shortly after joining the European union a question of extradition of Josip Perković arose. A member of Yugoslavian secret service UDBA, Germany accused Perković of murder of a Croat citizen Stjepan Đureković ( who is suspected to have stolen 200 million dollars from INA petrol company and has subsequently fled to Germany).
At first Croatia was unwilling to extradite Perković under the justification that its constitution prohibited it ( all political crimes fall barred after 2002 ). However, when threatened with sanctions in case of non compliance, the parliament quickly voted to change the constitution to allow the extradition. Finally, the law is to come into effect on January the first 2014.

On December the first 2013, Croatia held its third referendum since becoming independent. The referendum question was &quot;Do you define marriage as a union between a man and a woman&quot;, 65% of Croats voted yes, however, with a significantly low turnout of only 38% of eligible voters. The referendum was organized by the ultra-conservative group &quot;In the name of family&quot;&#x27;. The Catholic Church urged people to vote yes, while the government, 88 civil society organizations and local celebrities advised citizens to vote no. The referendum has raised much controversy and increase of violence against LGBT people in Croatian for this and following years. Same-sex registered partnership was introduced the following year, granting same-sex couples equal rights to marriage, except the LGBT adoption.

The sixth presidential election since independence took place in 2014 and 2015, with a first round held on 28 December 2014 between four candidates: the incumbent Ivo Josipović in office since 2010 and supported by the ruling coalition, former foreign minister and NATO official Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović nominated by the opposition HDZ, Živi zid activist Ivan Sinčić and right-wing populist Milan Kujundžić. Josipović and Grabar-Kitarović won the most votes, but fell short of the required 50% + 1 vote needed to win outright and proceeded to the second round held on 11 January 2015. In the second round Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović was elected the first female president of Croatia, winning with 50,74% of the vote and receiving 32.509 votes more than Josipović, thus making the latter the first Croatian president not to succeed in being reelected to office and also resulting in the narrowest margin of victory in any presidential election to date in Croatia.

Late 2014 and first half of 2015 was also marked by prolonged Croatian War Veterans protest in Savska street, Zagreb, which reached its climax in May 2015 when veterans took the protest to St. Mark&#x27;s Square. The protest had the impact on both 2014–15 presidential election, and 2016 Croatian parliamentary election, when Milanović&#x27;s attempted dialogue with the protest leaders resulted in leaking of tapes that revealed him using foul language to describe the neighboring countries. This ultimately cost Milanović of losing the 2016 elections.

In 2015, after Hungary built a fence along its border with Serbia, over 17000 refugees crossed the border into Croatia. They are seeking an alternative route into the Schengen area, as part of the refugee crisis, with most refugees fleeing the Syrian and Iraqi civil wars. As the Croatian prime minister Zoran Milanović stated that Croatia could not become a &quot;refugee camp&quot; and that it had become overwhelmed by the number of refugees entering the country, it was decided that Croatia would stop registering them and that a certain number of refugees be let into Hungary and Slovenia, attempts were made, however, by the authorities of those countries to obstruct the passage of refugees. The refugee crisis and immigration also, for the first time in Croatia&#x27;s history, became a subject of political debate during the next Croatian parliamentary election in 2015.

In November 2015, the centre-right coalition, led by the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), won 59 seats while the ruling alliance, led by the Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic and his Social Democrats (SDP), won 56 seats in the parliamentary election. However, neither the ruling alliance nor the opposition got the parliamentary majority.

== Orešković government (2016) ==

In January 2016, Tihomir Orešković, a Canadian-educated economist and technocrat, became Croatian new prime minister. Five months after taking the office, Prime Minister Orešković lost a parliamentary confidence vote, meaning his government fell.

== Plenković government (2016-) ==

In September 2016, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) won the early parliamentary election. However, they were still short of a majority in the 151-seat parliament.
In October 2016, Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) leader Andrej Plenković became new prime minister succeeding Tihomir Orešković. He formed a coalition with populist Most (Bridge of Independent Lists) and other small minority groups. In 2017 Agrokor - a largest Croatian private company fell into crisis with possibility of going bankrupt, so Croatian government intervened with a special law dubbed &quot;Lex Agrokor&quot; in order to salvage the company. In July 2018 Croatia national football team reached 2018 FIFA World Cup finals. In March 2020, Croatian capital Zagreb was rocked by 5.3 magnitude earthquake which caused significant damage to the city. In July 2020, the ruling centre-right party HDZ won the parliamentary election. On 12 October 2020 right wing extremist Danijel Bezuk attempted an attack on a Croatian government building and wounded a police officer in the process, after which he committed suicide.

In January 2020, former prime minister Zoran Milanović of the Social Democrats (SDP) won the presidential election. He defeated the first female President of Croatia, center-right incumbent Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).

The centre-right governing party HDZ won the parliamentary election in July 2020, meaning incumbent Prime Minister Andrej Plenković would serve a second term. On 12 October 2020 right wing extremist Danijel Bezuk attempted an attack on building of Croatian government and wounded a police officer in the process, after which he committed suicide. In December 2020. Banovina, one of the less developed regions of Croatia was shaken by 6.4 M earthquake which killed several people and completely destroyed the town of Petrinja. Throughout two and half years of global COVID-19 pandemic, 16,103 Croatian citizens died from the disease. In March 2022, a Soviet made Tu-141 drone crashed in Zagreb, most likely due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 26 July 2022, Croatian authorities officially opened Pelješac Bridge, thus connecting southernmost part of Croatia with the rest of the country. In September 2022, Croatian Bureau of Statistics published the official results of 2021 population census, which showed that the number of people living in Croatia fell to 3,871,833 people, which is 9,64 percent decrease in comparison with previous 2011 census. In late 2022 Croatia national football team competed on 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, where they ended up third. Upon their return to Croatia, they were again met by crowds of jubilant supporters in capital Zagreb and elsewhere. On 1 January 2023 Croatia officially became a Eurozone member and entered the Schengen Area.

<text>Pectoralis minor muscle () is a thin, triangular muscle, situated at the upper part of the chest, beneath the pectoralis major in the human body. It arises from ribs III-V; it inserts onto the coracoid process of the scapula. It is innervated by the medial pectoral nerve. Its function is to stabilise the scapula by holding it fast in position against the chest wall.

== Structure ==

=== Attachments ===
From the muscle&#x27;s origin, the muscle&#x27;s fibers pass superiorly and laterally, converging to form a flat tendon.

==== Origin ====
Pectoralis minor muscle arises from the upper margins and outer surfaces of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th ribs near their costal cartilages, and from the aponeuroses covering the intercostalis.

==== Insertion ====
Its tendon inserts onto the medial border and upper surface of the coracoid process of the scapula.

=== Innervation ===
The muscle receives motor innervation from the medial pectoral nerve.

=== Relations ===

Pectoralis minor muscle forms part of the anterior wall of the axilla. It is covered anteriorly (superficially) by the clavipectoral fascia. The medial pectoral nerve pierces the pectoralis minor and the clavipectoral fascia. In attaching to the coracoid process, the pectoralis minor forms a &#x27;bridge&#x27; - structures passing into the upper limb from the thorax will pass directly underneath.

Axillary nodes are classified according to their positions relative to the pectoralis minor muscle. Level 1 are lateral, Level 2 are deep, Level 3 are medial. The pectoralis minor divides the axillary artery into three parts (in contrary sequence compared to the nodes) - first part medial, second part deep/posterior, third part lateral in relation to the pectoralis minor.

=== Variations ===

The origin is from the second, third and fourth or fifth ribs. The tendon of insertion may extend over the coracoid process to the greater tubercle. It may be split into several parts. Absence of this muscle is rare but happens with certain uncommon diseases, such as the Poland syndrome.

== Function ==
Pectoralis minor muscle depresses the point of the shoulder, drawing the scapula superior, towards the thorax, and throwing its inferior angle posteriorly.

<doc id="755405" wikidata="Q3592503" url="?curid=755405" title="Crescent and star (symbol)">
<text>The conjoined representation of a crescent and a star is used in various historical contexts, including as a prominent symbol of the Ottoman Empire, and in contemporary times, as a national symbol by some countries, and by some Muslims as a symbol of Islam, while other Muslims reject it as an Islamic symbol. It was developed in the Greek colony of Byzantium ca. 300 BC, though it became more widely used as the royal emblem of Pontic king Mithridates VI Eupator after he incorporated Byzantium into his kingdom for a short period. During the 5th century, it was present in coins minted by the Persian Sassanian Empire; the symbol was represented in the coins minted across the empire throughout the Middle East for more than 400 years from the 3rd century until the fall of the Sassanians after the Muslim conquest of Persia in the 7th century. The conquering Muslim rulers kept the symbol in their coinage during the early years of the caliphate, as the coins were exact replicas of the Sassanian coins.

Both elements of the symbol have a long history in the iconography of the Ancient Near East as representing either the Sun and Moon or the Moon and Venus (Morning Star) (or their divine personifications). It has been suggested that the crescent actually represents Venus, or the Sun during an eclipse. Coins with crescent and star symbols represented separately have a longer history, with possible ties to older Mesopotamian iconography. The star, or Sun, is often shown within the arc of the crescent (also called star in crescent, or star within crescent, for disambiguation of depictions of a star and a crescent side by side). In numismatics in particular, the term crescent and pellet is used in cases where the star is simplified to a single dot.

The combination is found comparatively rarely in late medieval and early modern heraldry. It rose to prominence with its adoption as the flag and national symbol of the Ottoman Empire and some of its administrative divisions (eyalets and vilayets) and later in the 19th-century Westernizing &quot;tanzimat&quot; (reforms). The Ottoman flag of 1844, with a white &quot;ay-yıldız&quot; (Turkish for &quot;crescent-star&quot;) on a red background, continues in use as the flag of the Republic of Turkey, with minor modifications. Other states formerly part of the Ottoman Empire also used the symbol, including Libya (1951–1969 and after 2011), Tunisia (1831) and Algeria (1958). The same symbol was used in other national flags introduced during the 20th century, including the flags of Kazakhstan (1917), Azerbaijan (1918), Pakistan (1947), Malaysia (1948), Singapore (1959), Mauritania (1959), Azad Kashmir (1974), Uzbekistan (1991), Turkmenistan (1991) and Comoros (2001). In the latter 20th century, the star and crescent have acquired a popular interpretation as a &quot;symbol of Islam&quot;, occasionally embraced by Arab nationalism or Islamism in the 1970s to 1980s but often rejected as erroneous or unfounded by Muslim commentators in more recent times. Unlike the cross, which is a symbol of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion in Christianity, there is no solid link that connects the star and crescent symbol with the concept of Islam. The connotation is widely believed to have come from the flag of the Ottoman Empire, whose prestige as an Islamic empire and caliphate led to the adoption of its state emblem as a symbol of Islam by association.

Unicode introduced a &quot;crescent and star&quot; character in its Miscellaneous Symbols block, at U+262A (☪).

==History==
===Origins and predecessors===

Crescents appearing together with a star or stars are a common feature of Sumerian iconography, the crescent usually being associated with the moon god Sin (Nanna) and the star with Ishtar (Inanna, i.e. Venus), often placed alongside the sun disk of Shamash. 
In Late Bronze Age Canaan, star and crescent moon motifs are also found on Moabite name seals. The Egyptian hieroglyphs representing &quot;moon&quot; (N11 N11) and &quot;star&quot; (N14 N14) appear in ligature, forming a star-and-crescent shape N11:N14 , as a determiner for the word for &quot;month&quot;, &quot;&quot;.

The depiction of the crescent-and-star or &quot;star inside crescent&quot; as it would later develop in Bosporan Kingdom is difficult to trace to Mesopotamian art.
Exceptionally, a combination of the crescent of Sin with the five-pointed star of Ishtar, with the star placed &quot;inside&quot; the crescent as in the later Hellenistic-era symbol, placed among numerous other symbols, is found in a boundary stone of Nebuchadnezzar I (12th century BC; found in Nippur by John Henry Haynes in 1896). An example of such an arrangement is also found in the (highly speculative) reconstruction of a fragmentary stele of Ur-Nammu (Third Dynasty of Ur) discovered in the 1920s.

A very early depiction of the symbol (crescent moon, stars and sun disc) is found on the Nebra sky disc, dating from (Nebra, Germany). A gold signet ring from Mycenae dating from the 15th century BC also shows the symbol. The star and crescent (or &#x27;crescent and pellet&#x27;) symbol appears 19 times on the Berlin Gold Hat, dating from c. 1000 BC.

===Classical antiquity===

====Greeks and Romans====
Many ancient Greek (classical and hellenistic) and Roman amulets which depict stars and crescent have been found.

Mithradates VI Eupator of Pontus (r. 120–63 BC) used an eight rayed star with a crescent moon as his emblem. 
McGing (1986) notes the association of the star and crescent with Mithradates VI, discussing its appearance on his coins, and its survival in the coins of the Bosporan Kingdom where &quot;[t]he star and crescent appear on Pontic royal coins from the time of Mithradates III and seem to have had oriental significance as a dynastic badge of the Mithridatic family, or the arms of the country of Pontus.&quot;
Several possible interpretations of the emblem have been proposed. In most of these, the &quot;star&quot; is taken to represent the Sun. The combination of the two symbols has been taken as representing Sun and Moon (and by extension Day and Night), the Zoroastrian &quot;Mah&quot; and &quot;Mithra&quot;, or deities arising from Greek-Anatolian-Iranian syncretism, the crescent representing &quot;Mēn Pharnakou&quot; (, the local moon god) and the &quot;star&quot; (Sun) representing Ahuramazda (in &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot; called &quot;Zeus Stratios&quot;)

By the late Hellenistic or early Roman period, the star and crescent motif had been associated to some degree with Byzantium. If any goddess had a connection with the walls in Constantinople, it was Hecate. Hecate had a cult in Byzantium from the time of its founding. Like Byzas in one legend, she had her origins in Thrace. Hecate was considered the patron goddess of Byzantium because she was said to have saved the city from an attack by Philip of Macedon in 340 BC by the appearance of a bright light in the sky. To commemorate the event the Byzantines erected a statue of the goddess known as the &quot;Lampadephoros&quot; (&quot;torch-bearer&quot; or &quot;torch-bringer&quot;).

Some Byzantine coins of the 1st century BC and later show the head of Artemis with bow and quiver, and feature a crescent with what appears to be a six-rayed star on the reverse.

The moon-goddess Selene is commonly depicted with a crescent moon, often accompanied by two stars (the stars represent Phosphorus, the morning star, and Hesperus, the evening star); sometimes, instead of a crescent, a lunar disc is used. Often a crescent moon rests on her brow, or the cusps of a crescent moon protrude, horn-like, from her head, or from behind her head or shoulders.
In the 2nd century, the star-within-crescent is found on the obverse side of Roman coins minted during the rule of Hadrian, Geta, Caracalla and Septimius Severus, in some cases as part of an arrangement of a crescent and seven stars, one or several of which were placed inside the crescent.

==== Iran (Persia) ====
The crescent and star symbol appears on some coins of the Parthian vassal kingdom of Elymais in the late 1st century AD.
The same symbol is present in coins that are possibly associated with Orodes I of Parthia (1st century BC). In the 2nd century AD, some Parthian coins show a simplified &quot;pellet within crescent&quot; symbol.

The crescent and star motif appears on the margin of Sassanid coins in the 5th century.
Sassanid rulers also appear to have used crowns featuring a crescent, sphere and crescent, or star and crescent.

Use of the crescent-and-star combination apparently goes back to the earlier appearance of a star and a crescent on Parthian coins, first under King Orodes II (1st century BC). In these coins, the two symbols occur separately, on either side of the king&#x27;s head, and not yet in their combined star-and-crescent form.
Such coins are also found further afield in Greater Persia, by the end of the 1st century AD in a coin issued by the Western Satraps ruler Chashtana. 
This arrangement is likely inherited from its Ancient Near Eastern predecessors; the star and crescent symbols are not frequently found in Achaemenid iconography, but they are present in some cylinder seals of the Achaemenid era.

Ayatollahi (2003) attempts to connect the modern adoption as an &quot;Islamic symbol&quot; to Sassanid coins remaining in circulation after the Islamic conquest
 which is an analysis that stands in stark contrast to established consensus that there is no evidence for any connection of the symbol with Islam or the Ottomans prior to its adoption in Ottoman flags in the late 18th century.

====Western Turkic Khaganate====
Coins from the Western Turkic Khaganate had a crescent moon and a star, which held an important place in the worldview of ancient Turks and other peoples of Central Asia.

===Medieval and early modern===
====Christian and classical heraldric usage====

The crescent on its own is used in western heraldry from at least the 13th century, while the star and crescent (or &quot;Sun and Moon&quot;) emblem is in use in medieval seals at least from the late 12th century.
The crescent in pellet symbol is used in Crusader coins of the 12th century, in some cases duplicated in the four corners of a cross, as a variant of the cross-and-crosslets (&quot;Jerusalem cross&quot;).
Many Crusader seals and coins show the crescent and the star (or blazing Sun) on either side of the ruler&#x27;s head (as in the Sassanid tradition), e.g. Bohemond III of Antioch, Richard I of England, Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse. At the same time, the star in crescent is found on the obverse of Crusader coins, e.g. in coins of the County of Tripoli minted under Raymond II or III c. 1140s–1160s show an &quot;eight-rayed star with pellets above crescent&quot;.

The star and crescent combination appears in attributed arms from the early 14th century, possibly in a coat of arms of c. 1330, possibly attributed to John Chrysostom,
and in the &quot;Wernigeroder Wappenbuch&quot; (late 15th century) attributed to one of the three Magi, named &quot;Balthasar of Tarsus&quot;.

Crescents (without the star) increase in popularity in early modern heraldry in Europe. &quot;Siebmachers Wappenbuch&quot; (1605) records 48 coats of arms of German families which include one or several crescents.

A star and crescent symbolizing Croatia was commonly found on 13th-century &quot;banovac&quot; coins in the Kingdom of Slavonia, with a two-barred cross symbolizing the Kingdom of Hungary.

St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral in Vienna used to have at the top of its highest tower a golden crescent with a star; it came to be seen as a symbol of Islam and the Ottoman enemy, which is why it was replaced with a cross in 1686.

In the late 16th century, the Korenić-Neorić Armorial shows a white star and crescent on a red field as the coat of arms of &quot;Illyria&quot;.

The star and crescent combination remains rare prior to its adoption by the Ottoman Empire in the second half of the 18th century.

====Muslim usage====

While the crescent on its own is depicted as an emblem used on Islamic war flags from the medieval period, at least from the 13th century although it does not seem to have been in frequent use until the 14th or 15th century, the star and crescent in an Islamic context is more rare in the medieval period, but may occasionally be found in depictions of flags from the 14th century onward.

Some Mughal era (17th century) round shields were decorated with a crescent or star and crescent.

====Use in the Ottoman Empire====


The adoption of crescent and star as the Ottoman state symbol started during the reign of Mustafa III (1757–1774) and its use became well-established during the periods of Abdul Hamid I (1774–1789) and Selim III (1789–1807).
A decree (&quot;&quot;) from 1793 states that the ships in the Ottoman navy fly that flag, and various other documents from earlier and later years mention its use. 
The ultimate source of the emblem is unclear. It is mostly derived from the star-and-crescent symbol used by the city of Constantinople in antiquity, possibly by association with the crescent design (without the star) used in Turkish flags since before 1453.

With the Tanzimat reforms in the 19th century, flags were redesigned in the style of the European armies of the day. The flag of the Ottoman Navy was made red, as red was to be the flag of secular institutions and green of religious ones. As the reforms abolished all the various flags (standards) of the Ottoman pashaliks, beyliks and emirates, a single new Ottoman national flag was designed to replace them. The result was the red flag with the white crescent moon and star, which is the precursor to the modern flag of Turkey. A plain red flag was introduced as the civil ensign for all Ottoman subjects.
The white crescent with an eight-pointed star on a red field is depicted as the flag of a &quot;Turkish Man of War&quot; in Colton&#x27;s &quot;Delineation of Flags of All Nations&quot; (1862). Steenbergen&#x27;s &quot;&quot; of the same year shows a six-pointed star. A plate in &quot;Webster&#x27;s Unabridged&quot; of 1882 shows the flag with an eight-pointed star labelled &quot;Turkey, Man of war&quot;. The five-pointed star seems to have been present alongside these variants from at least 1857.

In addition to Ottoman imperial insignia, symbols appear on the flag of Bosnia Eyalet (1580–1867) and Bosnia Vilayet (1867–1908), as well as the flag of 1831 Bosnian revolt, while the symbols appeared on some representations of medieval Bosnian coat of arms too.

In the late 19th century, &quot;Star and Crescent&quot; came to be used as a metaphor for Ottoman rule in British literature. The increasingly ubiquitous fashion of using the star and crescent symbol in the ornamentation of Ottoman mosques and minarets led to a gradual association of the symbol with Islam in general in western Orientalism. The &quot;Red Crescent&quot; emblem was used by volunteers of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) as early as 1877 during the Russo-Turkish War; it was officially adopted in 1929.

After the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the new Turkish state maintained the last flag of the Ottoman Empire. Proportional standardisations were introduced in the Turkish Flag Law () of May 29, 1936.
Besides the most prominent example of Turkey (see Flag of Turkey), a number of other Ottoman successor states adopted the design during the 20th century, including the Emirate of Cyrenaica and the Kingdom of Libya, Algeria, Tunisia, and the proposed Arab Islamic Republic.

==Contemporary use==
===National flags===
The flag of Tunisia (1831) is the first to use the star and crescent design in 1831. This continues to be the Tunisian national flag post-independence. A decade later, the Ottoman flag of 1844 with a white &quot;ay-yıldız&quot; (Turkish for &quot;crescent-star&quot;) on a red background continues to be in use as the flag of the Republic of Turkey with minor modifications.

Other states in the Ottoman sphere of influence using the star and crescent design in their flats such as Libya (1951, re-introduced 2011) and Algeria (1958).
The modern emblem of Turkey shows the star outside the arc of the crescent, as it were a &quot;realistic&quot; depiction of a conjunction of Moon and Venus, while in the 19th century, the Ottoman star and crescent was occasionally still drawn as the star-within-crescent.
By contrast, the designs of both the flags of Algeria and Tunisia (as well as Mauritania and Pakistan) place the star within the crescent.

The same symbol was used in other national flags introduced during the 20th century, including the flags of Kazakhstan (1917), Azerbaijan (1918, re-introduced 1991), the Rif Republic (1921), Pakistan (1947), Malaysia (1948), Mauritania (1959), 
Kashmir (1974) and the partially recognized states of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (1976) and Northern Cyprus (1983). The symbol also may represent flag of cities or emirates such as the emirate of Umm Al-Quwain.

===Symbol of Islam===
By the mid-20th century, the symbol came to be re-interpreted as a symbol of Islam or the Muslim community.
This symbolism was embraced by movements of Arab nationalism or Islamism in the 1970s too, such as the proposed Arab Islamic Republic (1974) and the American Nation of Islam (1973).

Cyril Glassé in his &quot;The New Encyclopedia of Islam&quot; (2001 edition, s.v. &quot;Moon&quot;) states that &quot;in the language of conventional symbols, the crescent and star have become the symbols of Islam as much as the cross is the symbol of Christianity.&quot;

By contrast, &quot;Crescent&quot; magazine — a religious Islamic publication — quoted without giving names that &quot;Many Muslim scholars reject using the crescent moon as a symbol of Islam&quot;.

On February 28, 2017, it was announced by the Qira County government in Hotan Prefecture, Xinjiang, China that those who reported others for stitching the &#x27;star and crescent moon&#x27; insignia on their clothing or personal items or having the words &#x27;East Turkestan&#x27; on their mobile phone case, purse or other jewelry, would be eligible for cash payments.

===Municipal coats of arms===
The crescent and star as a traditional heraldic charge is in continued use in numerous municipal coats of arms (notably the based on the Leliwa (Tarnowski) coat of arms in the case of Polish municipalities).

===Sports Club Emblems===
In rugby union, Saracens F.C. incorporates the crescent and star in its crest. Drogheda United F.C., Portsmouth F.C., and S.U. Sintrense all borrow the crescent and star from their respective towns&#x27; coats of arms. Mohammedan SC in Kolkata, India also incorporates the symbol in its crest.

<text>Sir Richard Church (; 23 February 1784 – 20 March 1873) was an Anglo-Irish military officer in the British Army and commander of the Greek forces during the last stages of the Greek War of Independence after 1827. After Greek independence, he became a general in the Hellenic Army and a member of the Greek Senate.

== Early life and career ==

He was the second son of Matthew Church, a Quaker merchant in the North Mall area of Cork, Ireland, and Anne Dearman, originally from Braithwaith, Yorkshire, England. At the age of 16, he ran away from home and enlisted in the British Army. For this violation of its principles he was disowned by the Society of Friends, but his father bought him a commission, dated 3 July 1800, in the 13th (Somersetshire) Light Infantry. He served in the demonstration against Ferrol, and in the expedition to Egypt under Sir Ralph Abercromby in 1801, where he took part in the Battle of Abukir and the taking of Alexandria. After the expulsion of the French from Egypt he returned home, but went back to the Mediterranean in 1805 among the troops sent to defend the island of Sicily. He accompanied the expedition which landed in Calabria, and fought a successful battle against the French at the Battle of Maida on 4 July 1806. Church was present on this occasion as captain of a recently raised company of Royal Corsican Rangers. His zeal attracted the notice of his superiors, and he had begun to show his capacity for managing and drilling foreign levies. His Corsicans formed part of the garrison of Capri from October 1806 till the island was taken by an expedition directed against it by Joachim Murat, in September 1808, at the very beginning of his reign as king of Naples. Church, who had distinguished himself in the defence, returned to Malta after the capitulation.

In the summer of 1809 he sailed with the expedition sent to occupy the French-occupied Ionian Islands. Here he increased the reputation he had already gained by forming a Greek regiment in British pay. On 9 September 1809 he took the position of Major in the 1st Regiment Greek Light Infantry. On 19 November 1812 he became Lieutenant-Colonel of the unit, by then renamed The Duke of York&#x27;s Greek Light Infantry Regiment (1811 – 24 February 1816). Having got the experience of managing foreign troops, he commanded the regiments made up from Greeks he recruited himself in 1813, when he formed a second regiment composed of 454 Greeks (2nd Regiment Greek Light Infantry) to occupy Paxoi islands. These regiments included many of the men who were afterwards among the leaders of the Greeks in the War of Independence including Theodoros Kolokotronis, with whom he kept a friendship and correspondence. Church commanded this regiment at the taking of the island of Santa Maura (Lefkada), on which occasion his left arm was shattered by a bullet.

During his slow recovery he travelled in northern Greece, in Macedonia, and to Constantinople. In the years of the fall of Napoleon (1813 and 1814) he was present as British military representative with the Austrian troops until the campaign which terminated in the expulsion of Murat from Naples. He drew up a report on the Ionian Islands for the congress of Vienna, in which he argued in support, not only of the retention of the islands under the British flag, but of the permanent occupation by Britain of Parga and of other formerly Venetian coastal towns on the mainland, then in the possession of Ali Pasha of Yanina. The peace and the disbanding of his Greek regiment left him without employment, though his reputation was high at the war office, and his services were recognized by the grant of a Companion of the Order of the Bath.

In 1817, he entered the service of King Ferdinand of Naples as lieutenant-general, with a commission to suppress the brigandage then rampant in Apulia. Ample powers were given him, and he attained a full measure of success. In 1820 he was appointed governor of Palermo and commander-in-chief of the troops in Sicily. The revolution which broke out in that year led to the termination of his services in Naples. He escaped from violence in Sicily with some difficulty. At Naples he was imprisoned and put on his trial by the government, but was acquitted and released in January 1821; and King George IV conferred on him a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1822. He was further promoted to Knight Grand Cross by William IV in 1837.

== Role in the Greek War of Independence ==
The rising of the Greeks against the Turks, which began at this time, had his full sympathy from the first. But for some years he had to act only as the friend of the insurgents in England. In 1827 he took the honourable but unfortunate step of accepting the commandership-in-chief of the Greek army. At the point of anarchy and indiscipline to which they had now fallen, the Greeks could no longer form an efficient army, and could look for salvation only to foreign intervention. Sir Richard Church, who landed in March, was sworn &quot;archistrategos&quot; on 15 April 1827. But he could not secure loyal co-operation or obedience. The rout of his army in an attempt to relieve the acropolis of Athens, then besieged by the Ottomans, proved that it was incapable of conducting regular operations. The acropolis capitulated, and Sir Richard turned to partisan warfare in western Greece.

After the Battle of Navarino, and during the Kapodistrias period, he was placed commander-in-chief of the Greek regular forces in Central Greece, together with Demetrios Ypsilantis.

Church, however, surrendered his commission, as a protest against the unfriendly government of Capodistrias, on 25 August 1829. He lived for the rest of his life in Greece.

== Role in independent Greece ==

His activity had beneficial results and led to a rectification in 1832, in a sense favourable to Greece, of the frontier drawn by the Great Powers in the London Protocol (1830) (see his &quot;Observations on an Eligible Line of Frontier for Greece&quot;, London, 1830).

Under King Otto, he occupied senior military positions. On 3 October 1833, he was promoted to lieutenant general in the Hellenic Army, and in January 1835 became commander of the forces in Continental Greece. On 10 June 1835 he was appointed head of the Secretariat of State for Military Affairs (Army Minister), becoming Inspector-General of the Army on 28 October 1836. In 1844–45 he was a senator. He was promoted to full general—the grade being established for the first time for this purpose in the Hellenic Army—in February 1854, and died at Athens in 1873.

==Family==

Sir Richard Church married Marie-Anne, daughter of Sir Robert Wilmot, 2nd Baronet of Osmaston in Worthing, on 17 Aug 1826
He was the uncle of English churchman and writer Richard William Church.

==Death==

He died after an illness on Thursday, and he was buried at the First Cemetery of Athens at public expense on . The funeral took place after a delay in waiting for his nephew, who was expected to come from England.

The funeral service took place in the Anglican Church in Filellinon Street in the presence of King George I and a large numbers of official guests. The funeral monument is at the First Cemetery of Athens, opposite the Church of St. Lazarus, and it has an inscription in English on the front (&quot;Richard Church, General, who having given himself and all he had, to rescue a Christian race from oppression, and to make Greece a nation, lived for her service, and died among her people, rests here in peace and faith&quot;) and Greek on the back. On 15 March, the Minister of Justice, Panagiotis Chalkiopoulos, gave the funeral speech in Greek, while gave a speech in English.

<text>The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) is an American independent, 501(c)(3) nonprofit, non-governmental organization based in New York City, with correspondents around the world. CPJ promotes press freedom and defends the rights of journalists. The &quot;American Journalism Review&quot; has called the organization &quot;Journalism&#x27;s Red Cross.&quot; Since the late 1980s, CPJ has been publishing an annual census of journalists killed or imprisoned in relation to their work.

==History and programs==
The Committee to Protect Journalists was founded in 1981 in response to the harassment of Paraguayan journalist Alcibiades González Delvalle. Its founding honorary chairman was Walter Cronkite. Since 1991, it has held the annual CPJ International Press Freedom Awards Dinner, during which awards are given to journalists and press freedom advocates who have endured beatings, threats, intimidation, and prison for reporting the news.

Since 1987, it has published an annual worldwide survey of press freedom called &quot;Attacks on the Press&quot;.

Since 1992, the organization has compiled an annual list of all journalists killed in the line of duty around the world. For 2017, it reported that 46 journalists had been killed in connection with their work, as compared to 48 in 2016, and 72 in 2015, and that of those journalists killed, 18 had been murdered. A running total of journalists killed over the entire period from 1992 is available on the group&#x27;s website, as well as the statistics for any given year; the total was 1285. The organization&#x27;s figures are typically lower than similar ongoing counts by Reporters Without Borders or the International Federation of Journalists because of CPJ&#x27;s established parameters and confirmation process. It also publishes an annual census of imprisoned journalists.

In 2008, the organization launched an annual &quot;Impunity Index&quot; of countries in which journalists are murdered and the killers are not prosecuted.

The organization is a founding member of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX), a global network of more than seventy non-governmental organizations that monitors free-expression violations around the world and defends journalists, writers, and others persecuted for exercising their right to freedom of expression. In May 2016, A United Nations committee voted to deny consultative status to CPJ, primarily led by countries with poor press freedom like China, Sudan and Russia. The ban was overturned and CPJ was granted consultative status in July 2016.

In October 2016, the Committee broke with its tradition of staying out of politics and warned about the danger Donald Trump posed to press freedom in the United States and around the world.

In June 2017, US Representative Greg Gianforte was convicted of criminal assault in state court stemming from his assault of &quot;The Guardian&quot; political reporter Ben Jacobs in May 2017. As a stipulation of his settlement with Jacobs, Gianforte donated $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which said it would use the funds to support the new U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.

<doc id="755413" wikidata="Q490608" url="?curid=755413" title="Pubarche">
<text>Pubarche () refers to the first appearance of pubic hair at puberty. It is one of the earliest physical changes of puberty and can occur independently of complete puberty. It is usually the second sign of puberty, after thelarche in females and gonadarche in males (though in females, it can also happen before thelarche, but this is less common).

The early stage of sexual maturation, also known as adrenarche, is marked by characteristics including the development of pubic hair, axillary hair, adult apocrine body odor, acne, and increased oiliness of hair and skin. The Encyclopedia of Child and Adolescent Health corresponds SMR2 (sexual maturity rating) with pubarche, defining it as the development of pubic hair that occurs at a mean age of 11.6 years in females (range 9.3–13.9 years) and 12.6 years in males (range 10.7–14.5 years). It further describes that pubarche&#x27;s physical manifestation is vellus hair over the labia or the base of the penis. See Table 1 for the entirety of the sexual maturity rating description.

A study researched whether thelarche pathway, beginning puberty with breast development alone, or the pubarche pathway, beginning puberty with pubic hair development alone, represents the true pubertal development. The study is an observational, longitudinal cohort study. The study cohort is limited to a group of black and white girls who were seen annually for ten years. It is concluded in the research that pubarche may represent true pubertal maturation.

== Assessment ==
The Tanner scale remains the gold standard for determining pubarche. In clinical settings, this scale is primarily used by physicians, nurses, or other trained healthcare providers as part of a physical examination to assess the stage of puberty in children and adolescents, though in some cases the stage of puberty can be self-assessed.
==Average age==
The average beginning of pubarche varies due to many factors, including environmental exposures, nourishment, weight, race and ethnicity, and geographical location. First (and often transient) pubic hair resulting from adrenarche may appear between ages of 10 and 12 at the beginning of puberty.

=== Environmental exposures ===
Chemical toxins in the environment are one of many factors influencing adolescent development. In the early 1970s, more than 4000 people were accidentally exposed to polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs). A study was conducted in the child-bearing women exposed to the toxin, with their baby girls reaching menarche by the age of 11.6 years, compared to girls who had low exposure reaching menarche by the age of 12.2–12.6 years. In everyday life, people are exposed to a various number of pesticides, with a large amount found to be disruptive to the endocrine system. Although dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and the metabolite dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethane (DDE) were banned in the United States in the 1970s, countries around the world are still using these pesticides.

=== Geographical location and nutritional needs ===
Geographical location and zones also plays a part in the timing of pubarche. A study was done in different zones in Nigeria and found that males in the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest had an earlier timing of pubarche compared to the males in the Southeast, whereas females had delayed pubarche in the Southeast regions of Nigeria. Within these regions, socio-economic classes were also taken into consideration. They found that households with a higher economic status posed an increased risk of premature, or an early onset of pubarche, possibly related to food being easily accessible. Nutrition is vital in adolescent development. Failure to meet average nutritional needs, such as calcium and vitamin D for bone growth, may result in growth stunting. Over-nourishment and/or living a sedentary lifestyle can lead to obesity which can also affect adolescent pubarche. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010 declared that females between the ages of 9 and 13 year should meet a caloric intake of 1400 to 2200, while females between the ages of 14 and 18 years should meet a caloric intake of 1800 to 2400 calories a day.

== Premature pubarche ==
Premature pubarche, or &quot;precocious pubarche&quot;, refers to the appearance of pubic hair before the age of 8 in females or before the age of 9 in males. Premature pubarche is one marker of &quot;incomplete, partial, or dissociated precocious puberty&quot;, where incomplete puberty refers to the premature development of one secondary sexual characteristic, such as premature thelarche or premature pubarche. Premature adrenarche, as indicated by elevated levels of steroids that are naturally produced by the body (e.g., DHEAS), is the most common cause of premature pubarche. Premature pubarche is linked to adrenarcheal androgen levels with dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) of 40–130 ųg/dL.

However, premature pubarche may also arise independently of adrenarche. Premature pubarche is a subset of precocious puberty which divide into 1) true precocious puberty that includes complete and central precocious puberty and 2) incomplete puberty which has 3 subsets: premature thelacrche, premature pubarche and isolated menarche. When adrenarche, an increase in adrenal androgen production, central puberty, and all disease-causing conditions have been excluded, the term &quot;isolated premature pubarche&quot; is used to describe the unexplained development of pubic hair at an early age in people without other hormonal or physical changes of puberty. Other potential indicators of premature puberty should also be considered when diagonosing premature pubarche, such as hyperandrogenemia (high levels of androgen in the blood) and virilization.

Premature pubarche is also a symptom of other hormone- and puberty-related medical conditions, including polycystic ovary syndrome, and classic and non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

=== Clinical Examination ===
When premature pubarche has been identified, the clinical examination primarily involves the assessment of signs indicating an elevation of androgens in the body, as well as overall body growth and bone age. If these factors appear normal, it is considered &quot;simple premature pubarche&quot;, and it is recommended to monitor its progression to distinguish between central precious puberty or adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome. If these factors, especially body growth and bone age, appear to increase faster than usual, tests for various hormones may be ordered. These tests may include testosterone, 17-OH, DHEAS, and Synacthen test.

=== Treatment ===
Scientists have traditionally thought that premature pubarche has no significant effect to the body, and this is reflected in the lack of a scientific consensus with respect to treatment of premature pubarche. However, it has now been shown clinically that it could be a forerunner of the metabolic syndrome, a cause clinical ovarian androgen excess and hyperinsulinemia in adolescence. Studies have shown that females with premature pubarche and lower birth weight obtained reduced height as adults because of early onset of puberty and a shorter duration of puberty. There is ongoing study on metformin therapy in these females with the goal to improve final height. The use of metformin has been shown clinically to prevent ovarian hyperandrogenism development in females with premature pubarche. A randomized control trial studied the effect of metformin 850 mg daily for 12 months compared to placebo. The results show that all abnormalities regarding insulini sensitivity, serum androgens, lipids, total and truncal fat mass, and lean body mass were reversed within 6 months. The untreated group had data that continued to deviate from the normal range. Later on, a cohort study replicated these results.

== Delayed pubarche ==
Delayed pubarche can be caused by numerous aspects. This can include insufficient hormones, medical or genetic conditions (i.e., Turner syndrome, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), and chemicals that interfere with the hormones in the body. In young males, genetic differences that impacts the function of enzymes can affect how steroids are eliminated in urine. This can influence the development of pubic hair and can impact the physical appearance from person to person. In young females, the development of breasts and pubic hair can occur at different times. Some may experience breast development before the start of pubic hair growth, and vice versa. Therefore, in order to determine if delayed pubarche is a health issue or not, looking for the signs of puberty happening and the specific timing of it is important to note. The determination of the underlying cause of delayed pubarche can be done so with specific tests of antibodies, karyotype, and hormone levels (i.e., cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone).

=== Adrenal Insufficiency ===

Adrenal insufficiency is a life-threatening medical condition in which the adrenal gland is damaged. This leads to not enough hormones being produced, which include glucocorticoids and mineralcorticoids. These types of hormones are crucial for the regulation of many functions in the body and with not enough levels of these hormones that are produced by the adrenal glands, it can lead to primary adrenal insufficiency. Delayed pubarche can be expected in young individuals with this medical condition due to the lack of hormones that aid for pubic hair growth. Therefore, if signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency are present such as fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, or any history an autoimmune disease, adrenal insufficiency should be taken into consideration as an underlying cause for delayed pubarche.

=== Turner Syndrome ===
Turner syndrome is a genetic condition that affects the nerves and brain, which can lead to certain physical and clinical features such as a greater chance for certain diseases, shortness in height, or abnormal heartbeat sounds. For some individuals with Turner syndrome, the sign and growth of pubic hair can sometimes be delayed or even be absent. This is especially in females with Turner syndrome who have premature ovarian failure. One possible explanation for this is that ovaries are important for the adrenal gland regulation of dehydropiandrosterone (DHEA). The role of DHEA is to be transformed into various androgens, which play a crucial role during pubarche. Therefore, much high levels of androgens may be required in order to meet the levels of androgens in comparison to ovaries that work properly.

=== Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism ===
Another cause of delayed puberty in both males and females is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is a condition in which the male and female genitalia produce little to none of the sex hormones. This is a temporary condition in adolescents, usually caused by various stresses, including disease states such as asthma, ulcerative colitis, and sickle cell anemia. Specifically in males, this condition will result in low testosterone levels. Low levels of testosterone can cause levels of other hormones to rise, such as the luteinizing hormone (LH), the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is more prevalent in females, which usually develops under conditions such as anorexia nervosa or if the female individual participates in an abundant amount of exercise. With these situations decreasing body fat, both estrogen production and secretion will also decrease resulting in delayed puberty, and with it, delayed pubarche. Other health conditions that can cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism include ovarian failure and autoimmune diseases of the ovaries. Regardless of whether hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is acquired or congenital in males and females, it is always important for providers to conduct detailed family and social histories.

=== Treatment ===
With a lack of secondary sources to provide standardized procedures or guidelines to follow in treating delayed pubarche, many studies have been used to find formulations that work best in both males and females. In males diagnosed with constitutional delay in puberty and growth (CDPG), a short-course of testosterone in low doses is used to initiate puberty. In females diagnosed with CDPG, a short-course of estrogen in low doses is used to initiate puberty. Testosterone is available via oral route or intramuscular injection (IM), with IM being the preferred method of administration because oral testosterone has been shown to have liver toxicity side effects. Estrogen is available via oral route and IM; however, oral estrogen is the preferred method of administration. Upon initiation of treatment and thereafter, the adolescent must be monitored for pubertal development, which includes breast development in females and enlargement of the testicles in males. A provider can make a clinical judgment to stop treatment and monitor development while an adolescent is off therapy.

There seems to be no guideline or standard treatment for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; however, the table below (Table 2) shows different formulations of the treatments available as well as the initial doses and adult doses. The estrogen and progesterone formulation, also known as an oral contraceptive or hormonal birth control, should not be used to induce puberty. The transdermal and oral formulation of testosterone is also not preferred to induce puberty in males. 

In patients with Turner syndrome (TS), treatment formulations differ. The initiation dose is a fraction of the adult dose in most cases but this can also differ between different formulations available. In females, doses are started low and slowly titrated up over years. Oral formulations are not preferred because they pose for the risk of first-pass metabolism, affecting the normal function of the liver. The preferred administration of estrogen is transdermal, such as a patch. A study found that the females with TS using the transdermal estrogen formulation had an improved bone mineral content and uterine development.

<text>Andreas Vokos, better known by his nickname Miaoulis (; 1765 – 24 June 1835), was a Greek revolutionary, admiral, and politician who commanded Greek naval forces during the Greek War of Independence (1821–1829).

==Biography==
Miaoulis was born on the island of Hydra to an Arvanite family of Euboean origin, namely from the town of Fylla. He was known among his fellow islanders as a trader in corn who had gained wealth and made a popular use of his money. He had been a merchant captain, and was chosen to lead the naval forces of the islands when they rose against the government of the Sultan. Miaoulis contributed in every way possible to the cause of the resistance against the Turks. He expended the money he had made from his wheat-shipping business during the Napoleonic Wars. Between May 1825 and January 1826, Miaoulis led the Greeks to victory over the Turks in skirmishes off Modon, Cape Matapan, Suda, and Cape Papas.

==Role in the Greek War of Independence==
The islanders had enjoyed some measure of exemption from the worst excesses of the Turkish officials, but suffered severely from the conscription raised to man the Turkish ships; and though they seemed to be peculiarly open to attack by the Sultan&#x27;s forces from the sea, they took an early and active part in the rising. As early as 1822 Miaoulis was appointed &quot;navarch&quot;, () or admiral, of the swarm of small vessels which formed the insurgent fleet. He commanded the expedition sent to take revenge for the massacre of Chios in the same year. He was victorious at the Battle of Nauplia in September.In 1824, after the conquest of Psara by the Turks, he commanded the Greek forces which prevented the further progress of the Sultan&#x27;s fleet, though at the cost of the loss of many fire ships and men. But in the same year he was unable to prevent the Egyptian forces from occupying Navarino, though he harassed them with some success. In 1825 he succeeded in carrying stores and reinforcements into Missolonghi, when it was besieged for the third time, though he could not avert its fall. In order to save Missolonghi, he attempted to disrupt the sea communications of the Egyptian forces. In this he failed owing to the enormous disproportion of the two squadrons in the siege and strength of the ships.

As the war went on, the naval power of the Greeks diminished, partly owing to the penury of their treasury and partly to the growth of piracy in the anarchy of the Eastern Mediterranean. He continued to be the naval chief of the Greeks until the former Royal Navy officer Thomas Cochrane entered their service in 1827. Miaoulis then retired in order to leave the British officer free to act as commander.

When Miaoulis retired to make room for Cochrane, the conduct of the struggle had really passed into the hands of the Great Powers. When independence had been obtained, Miaoulis in his old age was entangled in the civil conflicts of his country, as an opponent of Kapodistrias and the Russian Party, he seized some of the principal ships of the Greek fleet at Poros in August 1831, including the &quot;Hellas&quot;, and destroyed them during the counter-attack of the Russian fleet.

He was one of the deputation sent to invite King Otto to accept the crown of Greece, and was made rear-admiral and then vice-admiral by him. Otto also awarded him with the Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer.

== Death and legacy ==
Miaoulis died on 24 June 1835 at Athens.

He was buried in Piraeus near the tomb of Themistocles, the founder of the ancient Athenian Navy. His heart rests in an urn at the Ministry of Commercial Navy.

The Hellenic Navy named a cruiser, the &quot;Navarchos Miaoulis&quot;, after him in 1879.

His son, Athanasios, was a high-ranking military officer who served as Prime Minister of Greece between 1857 and 1862.

A big festival, called Miaoulute, takes place in Hydra every year the weekend closest to 21 June, to honor Admiral Miaoulis, a most important man of the Greek Revolution in 1821.

<text>Gallinago is a genus of birds in the wader family Scolopacidae, containing 18 species.

==Taxonomy==
The name &quot;Gallinago&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 as a subdivision of the genus &quot;Scolopax&quot;. Brisson did not use Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s binomial system of nomenclature and although many of Brisson&#x27;s genera had been adopted by ornithologists, his subdivision of genera were generally ignored. Instead, the erection of the genus &quot;Gallinago&quot; for the snipes was credited to the German zoologist Carl Ludwig Koch in a book published in 1816. But in 1920 it was discovered that the German naturalist Johann Samuel Traugott Frenzel had erected the genus &quot;Capella&quot; for the snipes in 1801. As his publication predated Koch&#x27;s use of &quot;Gallinago&quot; it took precedence. The American Ornithologists&#x27; Union switched to &quot;Capella&quot; in 1921 and in 1934 the American ornithologist James L. Peters used &quot;Capella&quot; for the woodcocks in his influential &quot;Check-list of Birds of the World&quot;. This all changed in 1956 when the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled that &quot;Gallinago&quot; Brisson 1760 should have priority for the genus with the common snipe as the type species. The scientific name &quot;gallinago&quot; is Neo-Latin for a woodcock or snipe from Latin &quot;gallina&quot;, &quot;hen&quot; and the suffix &quot;-ago&quot;, &quot;resembling&quot;.

The genus contains 18 species:
* Solitary snipe, &quot;Gallinago solitaria&quot;
* Latham&#x27;s snipe, &quot;Gallinago hardwickii&quot;
* Wood snipe, &quot;Gallinago nemoricola&quot;
* Pin-tailed snipe, &quot;Gallinago stenura&quot;
* Swinhoe&#x27;s snipe, &quot;Gallinago megala&quot;
* African snipe, &quot;Gallinago nigripennis&quot;
* Madagascar snipe, &quot;Gallinago macrodactyla&quot;
*Magellanic snipe, &quot;Gallinago magellanica&quot;
* Great snipe, &quot;Gallinago media&quot;
* Common snipe, &quot;Gallinago gallinago&quot;
* Wilson&#x27;s snipe, &quot;Gallinago delicata&quot;
* Pantanal snipe, &quot;Gallinago paraguaiae&quot;
* Puna snipe, &quot;Gallinago andina&quot;
* Noble snipe, &quot;Gallinago nobilis&quot;
* Giant snipe, &quot;Gallinago undulata&quot;
* Fuegian snipe, &quot;Gallinago stricklandii&quot;
* Jameson&#x27;s snipe, &quot;Gallinago jamesoni&quot;
* Imperial snipe, &quot;Gallinago imperialis&quot;

This genus contains the majority of the world&#x27;s snipe species, the other two extant genera being &quot;Coenocorypha&quot;, with three species, and &quot;Lymnocryptes&quot;, the jack snipe. Morphologically, they are all similar, with a very long slender bill and cryptic plumage. Most have distinctive displays, usually given at dawn or dusk. They search for invertebrates in the mud with a &quot;sewing-machine&quot; action of their long bills.

Fossil bones of some undescribed &quot;Gallinago&quot; species most similar to the great snipe have been recovered in Late Miocene or Early Pliocene deposits (c. 5 mya) of Lee Creek Mine, USA. The large West Indian species &quot;Gallinago kakuki&quot; went extinct during the late Quaternary period, and despite its distribution may actually be more closely related to Old World snipe species than New World ones.

<text>Marshall Street, or &quot;M&quot; Street, is a street in the University Hill neighborhood in Syracuse, New York, adjacent to Syracuse University. Marshall Street often refer to the commercial area including and surrounding the 100 Block of Marshall Street. This area primarily functions as an off-campus commercial area for college students.

== History ==

Marshall Street is believed to be named for Louis Marshall (1856–1929), a Syracuse native, corporate and constitutional lawyer, and Trustee of Syracuse University, who helped reestablish the New York State College of Forestry (now SUNY-ESF) at Syracuse University. The 100 block of Marshall Street received the honorary name Louis Marshall Way in 2006. Historians are unsure if the street originally honored Louis Marshall, who only reached prominence after the turn of the twentieth century. The Marshall Square Mall is also located adjacent to Marshall Street. The area is promoted by the Crouse-Marshall Business Association. Marshall Street has been renovated many times over the years.

<doc id="755424" wikidata="Q328753" url="?curid=755424" title="Gary Barlow">
<text>Gary Barlow (born 20 January 1971) is an English singer, songwriter, record producer, and television personality. He is the lead singer of the pop group Take That.

Barlow is one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s most successful songwriters, having written fifteen number-one singles (twelve with Take That, two solo, one with the Robbie Williams song &quot;Candy&quot;) and twenty-four top-ten hits. As a solo artist, he has had three number-one singles, six top-ten singles and three number-one albums, and has additionally had seventeen top-five hits, twelve number-one singles and eight number-one albums with Take That. Barlow has also served as a judge on the television talent shows &quot;The X Factor UK&quot; (2011–2013), &quot;Let It Shine&quot; (2017) and &quot;Walk the Line&quot; (2021).

Barlow has received six Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, including the award for Outstanding Services to British Music. Barlow was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) at the 2012 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for his services to the entertainment industry and charity. He has sold over 50 million records worldwide. According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Barlow as a solo artist has been certified for 1.1 million albums and 1.8 million singles in the UK.

==Early life and influences==
Gary Barlow was born on 20 January 1971 in Frodsham, Cheshire, the second son of Colin (died 15 October 2009) and Marjorie Barlow (&quot;née&quot; Cowan). He attended Weaver Vale Primary School, and moved on to Frodsham High School in 1982. In Barlow&#x27;s autobiography, he relates that his love of music began at an early age, and calls himself &quot;one of those kids that&#x27;s forever dancing in front of the TV looking at [his] reflection&quot;. He was heavily influenced by late 1970s and 1980s pop music. At age 10, after watching Depeche Mode perform on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, Barlow acquired his first keyboard; he practiced constantly thereafter. Barlow has also cited Trevor Horn, and future collaborators Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), as important early influences. He has credited Elton John with inspiring him to play the piano. The first CD he bought was by the Pet Shop Boys, who later supported Take That on the Progress Live tour in 2011.

In 1986, when Barlow was 15 years old, he entered a BBC &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot; Christmas song competition with &quot;Let&#x27;s Pray for Christmas&quot;. After reaching the semi-finals, he was invited to London&#x27;s West Heath Studios to record his song. This inspired him to perform on the northern club circuit, singing cover versions and his own songs.

In 1989, Barlow appointed Wigan show business agent Barry Woolley to be his manager and recorded a single (&quot;Love Is in the Air&quot;) under the name Kurtis Rush. Barlow was eventually put in touch with casting agent Nigel Martin-Smith, by celebrity photographer Doc Braham, who took Barlow&#x27;s first professional head-shots. Martin-Smith eventually decided to use Barlow as the lead singer after being impressed by his self-written material, including an early demo tape of Barlow&#x27;s &quot;A Million Love Songs&quot;, concluding that the band should be built around Barlow&#x27;s vocals and songwriting skills.

==History==
===1989–1996: Take That===

Barlow, who wrote the majority of the group&#x27;s songs, is widely recognised as the lead singer of Take That. After selecting Barlow as the group&#x27;s lead singer, Nigel Martin-Smith introduced Howard Donald, Jason Orange, Mark Owen and finally Robbie Williams to the fold. The group were signed to RCA Records, and after a number of top-40 hits, eventually secured their first number-one with Barlow&#x27;s &quot;Pray&quot;. Previous hits included &quot;A Million Love Songs&quot;, &quot;It Only Takes a Minute&quot; and &quot;Could It Be Magic&quot;. The debut album &quot;Take That &amp; Party&quot; was released on 17 August 1992 and reached number two in the UK Album Chart. The following year saw the release of their second album, &quot;Everything Changes&quot; based on Barlow&#x27;s own material. It went straight in at number one in the UK Albums Chart and spawned four number-one singles, as well as &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I Wake Up with You&quot; and &quot;Love Ain&#x27;t Here Anymore&quot; hitting numbers two and three respectively.

Barlow received an Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song in 1994 for the number-one hit song &quot;Pray&quot; included on the album. In 1994, alongside Rick Astley, Barlow did backing vocals for Elton John&#x27;s version of &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight&quot; from &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Take That&#x27;s third album &quot;Nobody Else&quot;, again based on Barlow&#x27;s own material, went straight to number one and was to be their last studio album of the 1990s. The album had three number-one singles, including Barlow&#x27;s &quot;Back for Good&quot; which peaked at number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was brought forward an unprecedented six weeks before its official release such was the demand for the single. A &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection followed again reaching number one. The album featured the band&#x27;s eighth number-one single &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot;. This was to be the first single released by Take That as a four-piece (without Robbie Williams) and it was their last single until they reformed in 2005.

===1996–1998: Solo career and &quot;Open Road&quot;===

Barlow&#x27;s solo career was predicted to be very successful, being described as &quot;the next George Michael&quot;. His first two solo singles, &quot;Forever Love&quot; (released July 1996) and &quot;Love Won&#x27;t Wait&quot; (composed by Madonna and Shep Pettibone), both leapt to the number one spot in his home country. &quot;Forever Love&quot; was also used as the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Leading Man&quot;. His debut album &quot;Open Road&quot; reached number one in the UK Albums Chart and went on to sell 2 million copies worldwide. Barlow&#x27;s first single to be released in the United States as a solo artist was &quot;So Help Me Girl&quot;, which reached number 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart and number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. He then achieved another top-ten hit in the UK with &quot;Open Road&quot; peaking at number seven.

===1999–2004: &quot;Twelve Months, Eleven Days,&quot; and producing career===
After the success of his first solo album, Barlow released his second LP &quot;Twelve Months, Eleven Days&quot; in 1999. Barlow released &quot;Stronger&quot; as the lead single preceding the album. The single peaked at number 16. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;For All That You Want&quot;, also received minimal radio play and peaked at number 24; however, it nearly reached the top five in Finland. &quot;Twelve Months, Eleven Days&quot; received little promotion and peaked at number 35, which led to Sony recalling the album&#x27;s scheduled third single, &quot;Lie to Me&quot;. This decision resulted in Barlow and BMG parting company.

In late 1999, Barlow quit his career as a singer, with his final single remaining unreleased. From 2000 to 2004, he was a producer for other artists, including bandmate Mark Owen&#x27;s solo projects. In 2005, he resumed his singing career after a six-year hiatus.

===2005–2011: Take That reunion and &quot;Shame&quot;===

Barlow returned to the spotlight in a successful TV documentary, &quot;Take That: For the Record&quot; in 2005. Following this success and renewed interest, Take That experienced a career renaissance in 2005 when the post-Williams line-up reformed for a sell-out arena/stadium tour. The band released their comeback single &quot;Patience&quot; which went to number one for four weeks while also topping the charts across Europe. Patience was also voted the Record of the Year in 2006 and won a Brit Award for single of the year. This was followed with &quot;Shine&quot; which became the band&#x27;s tenth number-one single. Take That&#x27;s first album of new material in over ten years, &quot;Beautiful World&quot; was released on 24 November 2006. The album peaked at number one in the UK Album Chart selling over 2.8 million copies in the UK alone as of 2012. It was re-released as a tour edition with hit single &quot;Rule the World&quot; in 2007 and peaked again at number one.

In 2008, the band were nominated for four Brit Awards (Best British Group, Best British Album, Best British Single and Best British Live Act). They won Best British Single and Best British Live Act. After great success in 2006, Take That released the single &quot;Greatest Day&quot; which went straight to number one and became their eleventh number-one single in the UK. The week after they released their second album since their reunion in 2006, &quot;The Circus&quot;. &quot;The Circus&quot; album was also a great success for Take That going straight to the top of the UK album chart and selling over 2.2 million copies in the country, going multi-platinum within four days of its release. In June and July 2009, Take That performed a record-breaking tour named &quot;Take That Present: The Circus Live&quot; throughout the United Kingdom and it sold over one million tickets in just five hours.

Barlow&#x27;s first solo release since 1999 was a duet with reconciled Take That bandmate Robbie Williams on a single entitled &quot;Shame&quot;. The single was written by both Barlow and Williams after they began to work together in Los Angeles on new material for a new Take That album following Williams&#x27; return to the band. On the first day of the song being released to the radio and the media, &quot;Shame&quot; received an unprecedented 694 plays on the radio and 153 plays on TV. The single peaked at number 2 in the UK, selling 224,000 copies and being certified as Silver by the BPI, while also charting in 21 countries worldwide.

It was announced that Barlow was in the process of writing Take That&#x27;s much-anticipated sixth studio album, set for release in late 2010. The album, &quot;Progress&quot;, was the first to feature the original line-up since their 1995 album, &quot;Nobody Else&quot;. The band also announced a stadium tour entitled Progress Live which took place in 2011. The tickets for the tour went on sale on 29 October 2010. Due to unprecedented high public demand for tickets, Ticketmaster websites across the UK and Ireland crashed and all initial tour dates sold out in under 15 minutes. It was reported that a record breaking one million tickets were sold on the first day of sale, resulting in Take That beating the previous box office record of tickets sold which was set in 2008 by Take That Present: The Circus Live. Due to unprecedented demand Take That added more dates to their tour, finishing in the UK with a record breaking eight consecutive nights at Wembley Stadium after which the tour would then commence throughout Europe with an estimated 1.75 million people expected to attend the shows.

The lead single from &quot;Progress&quot; was announced as &quot;The Flood&quot;. The single debuted at number two, selling over 500,000 copies. On the first day of the release of &quot;Progress&quot;, the album sold over 235,000 copies across the UK, making it the fastest-selling record of the century. On 21 November 2010, &quot;Progress&quot; debuted at number one in the United Kingdom, becoming the band&#x27;s seventh number-one album. By the end of its first week on sale the album sold over 520,000, making it the second fastest-selling album of all-time in UK chart history. To date &quot;Progress&quot; has sold 2.4 million copies in the UK and has achieved similar chart success across Europe. In June 2011, Take That released their first extended play collection entitled &quot;Progressed&quot; which returned the band to number one in the UK on its first week of release as well as charting across Europe.

===2012–2014: Return to solo projects, &quot;Sing&quot; and &quot;Since I Saw You Last&quot;===

In April 2012, Barlow recorded a cover of &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; that was used in the 2012 summer promotion advertisement for Marks and Spencer with him appearing in the advert at the end performing the song. In November 2012, Barlow appeared on Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds – The New Generation, a re-working of his 1978 album of the same name. He portrayed the sung thoughts of the journalist and appeared in the songs “The Eve of the War”, “Forever Autumn”, and “Dead London (Part 2)”, replacing Justin Hayward from the original.

Barlow was featured in a duet with Agnetha Fältskog (from ABBA) on her 2013 album &quot;A&quot;, released in May 2013. Barlow co-wrote the song, &quot;I Should&#x27;ve Followed You Home&quot; with album producer Jörgen Elofsson. Early press reports tagged the song as a likely single with strong chart potential leading to Universal Music scheduling it to be released as the third single from the album in November 2013. The single became a top 5 hit in Sweden on the week of its release as well as charting in the UK.

It was announced in January 2012 that Barlow and Andrew Lloyd Webber would be working together to write the official Diamond Jubilee single. Barlow and Lord Lloyd Webber composed the music to the song; with Barlow then taking this music to musicians and singers around the Commonwealth with the aim to incorporate sounds from around the world onto the single. The song entitled &quot;Sing&quot; was released as the lead single from the album of the same name, &quot;Sing&quot;. It debuted in the UK Singles Chart at number 11 with the album released on the same day entering the UK Album Chart at number one, becoming Barlow&#x27;s second solo number-one album and his first in 15 years. After the airing of Gary Barlow&#x27;s documentary &quot;Gary Barlow: On Her Majesty&#x27;s Service&quot; which told the story of how &quot;Sing&quot; was written; the single climbed up to number one in the iTunes chart. The following week &quot;Sing&quot; rose to number one in the UK Singles Chart selling 142,000 copies and becoming among the highest selling singles of 2012. The album of the same name remained at number one, making Barlow the first artist in 2012 to have the number-one album and number-one single in the same week.

Barlow announced on 15 October 2012 that he was to embark on his first full solo tour in thirteen years around the UK and Ireland.

The tickets to Barlow&#x27;s solo concerts sold out &quot;instantly&quot; after going on sale on 19 October, with tickets selling faster than those of the Rolling Stones for their comeback dates. Demand was so high for tickets that Barlow added more dates, which also sold out instantly. It was also revealed by ticket marketplace SeatWave, that Barlow&#x27;s solo shows had sold six times more tickets than Robbie Williams&#x27; solo concerts, despite being on sale for a week less.
In September 2013, Barlow announced via his Twitter account that he would be releasing his first full-length solo album in 14 years, on 25 November 2013. On 4 October 2013, Barlow revealed his new album would be called &quot;Since I Saw You Last&quot;, and would be preceded by his first single from the LP, titled &quot;Let Me Go&quot;, released worldwide on 17 November 2013.

The week after the release of &quot;Let Me Go&quot;, the album debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart, behind One Direction&#x27;s third album &quot;Midnight Memories&quot;. The album sold 116,000 copies, becoming the fastest selling album of 2013 to miss out on the top spot, whilst also selling more copies in his first week than his Take That bandmate Robbie Williams, whose album &quot;Swings Both Ways&quot; sold 109,000 copies the previous week to claim the top spot. The album was certified Platinum by the BPI less than a month after being released, becoming Barlow&#x27;s second solo album to reach Platinum certification.

On 4 June 2012, the Diamond Jubilee concert was held outside Buckingham Palace with it acting as a backdrop to a stage built upon the Victoria Memorial featuring various worldwide artists. The concert included music stemming from the 1950s to the 2000s with each decade of her reign reflected in the music performed.

In August 2013, the headline act to turn on the Blackpool illuminations pulled out due to unforeseen circumstances leaving the event with no one to turn on the lights or play to the 5,000 in attendance. Upon hearing this, Barlow tweeted that he would step in if the organisers would write a cheque to Children In Need. Bosses quickly made contact with him and made a donation to the charity, with Barlow turning on the lights and performing a number of his hits during the 45-minute set.

In October 2013, Barlow travelled directly from the X Factor live results shows to Afghanistan to meet the Armed Forces and experience their day-to-day lives in Camp Bastion. Barlow listened to the soldiers&#x27; stories, went for a five-kilometre run with the troops and played a morale-boosting concert for them as a thank-you for their work.

On 12 November 2013, Barlow sang with Agnetha Fältskog (from ABBA) who was singing live on stage. It was at the BBC Children in Need Rocks 2013 concert in London which Barlow organised.

In November 2016, Barlow became a Patron for Child Bereavement.

==Personal life==

===Family===
In 2000, Barlow married Dawn Andrews, who was a dancer on Take That&#x27;s 1995 Nobody Else Tour. They have three children, born in 2000, 2002, and 2009. On 4 August 2012, he revealed that their daughter, Poppy, was stillborn. He released a short statement reading, &quot;Dawn and I are devastated to announce that we&#x27;ve lost our baby. Our focus now is giving [Poppy] a beautiful funeral and loving our three children with all our hearts. We&#x27;d ask at this painful time that our privacy be respected.&quot; Later in 2022 he said: &quot;I needed to accept this wasn&#x27;t a scar that was going to heal with time, this was a scar I was going to die with&quot;. 

Despite the loss of his daughter one week previously, Barlow performed at the London 2012 Olympic Games Closing Ceremony singing the hit &quot;Rule the World&quot;, which drew praise internationally for the strength and determination of Barlow to take to the stage so soon after his tragedy. Owing to the bereavement, it was announced that Barlow would not attend the &quot;X Factor&quot; press launch.

In his autobiography &quot;My Take&quot;, Barlow revealed that he is a supporter of Liverpool F.C., with their anthem being one of the first songs he learned to play on the piano. He is also a supporter of the Warrington Wolves and the New York Knicks.

In 2009, Barlow named &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;, the 1986 duet between Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush, as the song that had most inspired him. He said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think you can listen to this song without feeling inspired, it could save anybody. The lyrics are so inspirational. Specifically I was having a very low moment in the 1990s and the song came on the radio. There have only been a very few times when I&#x27;ve had to pull the car over to listen to a song; this was one of them.&quot;

===Politics===
During the 2010 general election campaign, the Conservative Party announced their intention to encourage musical achievement among young people in schools with a competition called &quot;School Stars&quot;. Barlow appeared at a school-staged campaign event to endorse the introduction of the programme by the then Conservative leader David Cameron. Barlow also sang &quot;Greatest Day&quot; at the event. When asked if he was supporting the Conservatives at the election, Barlow responded: &quot;I would not be here if I was not.&quot;

===Tax avoidance controversy===
In June 2012, it was revealed that along with Take That bandmates Howard Donald and Mark Owen (and over 1,100 other people), Barlow had invested £26 million in music industry investment schemes. The news attracted controversy when it was understood that the schemes could serve as tax shelters for wealthy people. Barlow was accused of tax avoidance rather than tax evasion, as the scheme itself was not illegal at the time Barlow invested in it. Barlow&#x27;s lawyer responded to the claims, stating that the singer &quot;paid significant tax, and that they believed the schemes were not for tax avoidance purposes but were legitimate commercial enterprises&quot;. In May 2014 a judge ruled that the scheme was set up for the purpose of avoiding tax, with the scheme generating losses of £336 million to enable Barlow and others to offset those losses against taxes they were liable to pay from other earnings. In June 2016, Barlow (and Donald and Owen plus their manager Jonathon Wild) announced they would not appeal against a ruling that they are liable to re-pay the tax. Barlow apologised on Twitter &quot;to anyone who was offended by the tax stories&quot;.

<doc id="755427" wikidata="Q1544412" url="?curid=755427" title="Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority">
<text>The Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (officially the GCRTA, but historically and locally referred to as the RTA) is the public transit agency for Cleveland, Ohio, United States and the surrounding suburbs of Cuyahoga County. RTA is the largest transit agency in Ohio, with a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

RTA owns and operates the RTA Rapid Transit rail system (called &quot;The Rapid&quot; by area residents), which consists of one heavy rail line (the Red Line) and three light rail lines (Blue, Green, Waterfront). The bulk of RTA&#x27;s service consists of buses, including regular routes, express or &quot;flyer&quot; buses, loop and paratransit buses. In December 2004, RTA adopted a revised master plan, Transit 2025, in which several rail extensions, bus line improvements and transit oriented developments are discussed.

RTA&#x27;s major predecessor, the Cleveland Transit System, was the first transit system in the western hemisphere to provide direct rapid transit service from a city&#x27;s downtown to its major airport.

In 2007, RTA was named the best public transit system in North America by the American Public Transportation Association, for &quot;demonstrating achievement in efficiency and effectiveness.&quot;

== History ==

The GCRTA was established on December 30, 1974, and on September 5, 1975 assumed control of the Cleveland Transit System, which operated the heavy rail line from Windermere to Cleveland Hopkins Airport and the local bus systems, and Shaker Heights Rapid Transit (the descendant of a separate streetcar system formed by the Van Sweringen brothers to serve their Shaker Heights development), which operated the two interurban light rail lines from downtown to Shaker Heights. CTS had been formed in 1942, when the city of Cleveland took over the old Cleveland Railway Company. However, with Cleveland&#x27;s dwindling population over the previous two decades, its revenue dwindled significantly. The problem really manifested itself with a 17-day strike in July 1970. City and county leaders concluded that a regional approach was the only way to save it.

A month after its formation, RTA assumed control over the suburban bus systems operated by Maple Heights, North Olmsted, Brecksville, Garfield Heights and Euclid.

The RTA had to undertake a number of renovations to the rail system, as the Shaker Heights lines (renamed the Blue and Green lines) had not been significantly renovated since their creation in 1920. They were largely rebuilt by 1981 and the downtown station at Cleveland Union Terminal, later renamed Tower City Center, was heavily rebuilt by 1987. In 1994, a walkway and skyway was added from the Tower City station to the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex and the Blue and Green lines were extended to the North Coast Harbor area by 1996.

Seventy-five Cleveland Transit System PCC streetcars were sold in 1952 to Toronto to be used by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The last of the Cleveland PCC models operated for 30 years in Toronto, until 1982. Cleveland Transit also sold eight Marmon-Herrington TC44 trolleybuses in 1963 to the TTC.
In 2005, RTA began building a bus rapid transit line along Euclid Avenue from Public Square to University Circle and then to East Cleveland. This was originally to be a subway line running under Euclid Avenue, but the high cost of such a project caused it to be reduced in scope, resulting in the current bus rapid transit project. Vehicles operate in an exclusive center median busway from Public Square to Stokes Blvd. and transition to curbside running through University Circle to the Windermere Rapid Transit Station in East Cleveland. The vehicles are low-floor, articulated buses.

Naming rights for the line were purchased by the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals for twenty-five years. The BRT route, originally named the &quot;Silver Line&quot;, which serves the two major health industry employers in Cleveland, is named the HealthLine.

As sections were completed, they were opened to traffic; the entire stretch within the project area was open by October 24, 2008 as part of its grand opening October 24–26, 2008.

In January 2023, the GCRTA announced the acquisition of sixty Siemens S200 light rail vehicles to replace the system&#x27;s entire existing rail fleet. Twenty-four such cars will replace the Tokyu heavy rail trains used on the Red Line, with an option to acquire 36 additional units to replace the Breda light rail vehicles used on the Blue, Green, and Waterfront lines. GCRTA&#x27;s S200s will include steps at the front right door for boarding at street-level stations on the Blue, Green, and Waterfront. Once the acquisition is approved by the GCRTA&#x27;s board, S200s are expected to begin service in Cleveland in 2026.
=== Active Bus Fleet ===

== List of bus routes ==
In , the GCRTA bus system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

 = 15-minute midday frequency
 = 30-minute midday frequency
 = 45-minute midday frequency
 = 60-minute or less midday frequency
Other colors denote special routes

=== Cleveland State Line ===

In December 2014, RTA opened a second bus rapid transit to serve the western suburbs of Cleveland as well as a larger portion of downtown, including Cleveland State University. Cleveland State purchased naming rights to the route. The line carries a &quot;55&quot; designation, the same bus route number used by the BRT&#x27;s predecessor.

All passengers must pay or swipe/dip their farecards on board the bus.

Only a portion of the line along Clifton Boulevard–from the western terminus of Cleveland Memorial Shoreway to Webb Road in Lakewood– includes a dedicated bus-only lane. However, the bus-only designation only applies during rush hours: with the eastbound bus-only lane active during the morning rush, and with the westbound bus-only lane active during the evening rush.

All outbound trips originate from the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Transit Center near Cleveland State and travel through downtown to Public Square before entering the west shoreway. Shortly after reaching the Lakewood border, the line divides into three sub-routes:

* 55: Travels down Clifton and continues to follow U.S. Route 20 to Detroit Road until reaching Wagar Road where it travels south to Lorain Rd in Fairview Park, continues to North Olmsted via Great Northern Mall before terminating near the Lorain County line. Rush hour trips travel into the North Olmsted park-n-ride.
* 55B: Travels down Clifton and continues to follow Lake Road into Bay Village where it follows Wolf, West Oviatt, and Osborn Roads west to Bradley Road before returning to Lake Road to travel east to its terminus at Wolf and Cahoon Roads.
* 55C: Travels down Clifton and continues to follow U.S. Route 20 to Detroit Road until reaching Crocker Road in Westlake where it terminates at Crocker Park.

The 55 base route runs 7 days a week from early A.M. though the evening. The 55B and 55C routes run Monday through Friday during the morning and evening rush hours only. B and C also travel to the Westlake Park-n-Ride.

=== MetroHealth Line ===
On September 21, 2017, RTA announced a partnership with MetroHealth to sponsor routes 51, 51A, 53 and 53A under the brand MetroHealth Line. On December 3, 2017, the rebranded MetroHealth Line began service with 20 new vehicles, fully branded with the MetroHealth logo. More than 400 bus-stop signs and 37 shelters also display the new logo along the routes. Unlike the other named lines, it features no BRT features.

== Bicycles ==
RTA has equipped all of its mainline buses with bicycle carriers. Each bus can carry two to three bicycles. Bicycles are also allowed on rapid transit trains (with a maximum limit of two per car) at all times, although operators have discretion to refuse bicycles if a train is overcrowded. Bicycles are not allowed access to/from the Public Square/Tower City Station through the shopping areas of Tower City Center. However, an elevator connection is permitted between the station lobby and street level, at Prospect Avenue via the south-side doors. Bicycles are also allowed to transfer between trains at Tower City Station. There is no additional charge for taking bicycles on RTA.

== Funding ==
When RTA was formed, Cuyahoga County voters approved a 1% county-wide sales tax, which constitutes about 70% of its operating revenue. This funding source has helped RTA maintain a higher level of service than other transit agencies in comparable cities and it also helps RTA retain some degree of political autonomy. However, it also makes RTA unusually susceptible to economic downturns.

In recent years, RTA has undertaken great efforts to improve efficiency and eliminate unnecessary costs. These efforts have included mergers with the two remaining autonomous transit agencies in Cuyahoga County, the North Olmsted Municipal Bus Line and Maple Heights Transit, and the redesigning of its routes in the suburban areas southeast, west, and south of Cuyahoga County.

== CTS fleet ==
* 1946 Pullman PCC A11 (50) and 1946 St. Louis Car Company A12 (25) – all sold to Toronto in 1952 and all retired by TTC.
* Marmon-Herrington TC48-T5 and TC44-T7 trolleybus – ordered 49 in 1951 and 1952 and retired in 1960s (sold to Mexico City&#x27;s Servicio de Transportes Eléctricos and since retired)

<text>Into the Electric Castle – A Space Opera is the third album of the progressive metal project Ayreon by Dutch singer, songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist Arjen Anthony Lucassen. Released in 1998, it was the band&#x27;s first double album.

Like most Ayreon albums, it is a concept album, taking place in the same fictional universe as Ayreon&#x27;s first album &quot;The Final Experiment&quot;. &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot; follows eight characters from different locations and time periods, who inexplicably find themselves in a strange place where they follow a mysterious voice to reach the Electric Castle to survive. Each character, made bombastically flamboyant with influence from B movies, is voiced by a different singer. &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot; is the first collaboration between Lucassen and Ed Warby, who has since become Lucassen&#x27;s most regular collaborator, playing drums on every following Ayreon album except &quot;Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer&quot; and &quot;Transitus&quot; and on most of his other projects.

The album was a commercial success and received overwhelmingly positive reviews from music critics. Lucassen released a remixed version of the album in 2018, followed by a live album featuring a full live performance of the album, titled &quot;Electric Castle Live and Other Tales&quot;, in 2020.

== Background ==
After the previous Ayreon album, &quot;Actual Fantasy&quot;, sold below expectations, Lucassen sought to deliver a top-quality recording with &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot;. If the album had not been a success, he said that he would have no longer have continued the Ayreon project. It remains his highest selling album to date, with &quot;The Human Equation&quot; being a close second.

== Plot ==
The story begins with a strange voice (Peter Daltrey) calling out to the eight characters that are taken from various planes of time. The mysterious voice tells them they are in a place of &quot;no-time and no space&quot;. Urging them to continue, the voice gives them a task: to reach The Electric Castle and find out what&#x27;s inside.

After various steps, they come to the Decision Tree where the voice tells them one of them must die. They must then go through the Tunnel of Light, but the Highlander (Fish) refuses to reach the light, stays behind, accepts his death slowly, and lays himself down to die while the others continue. Then in the Garden of Emotions, the Egyptian (Anneke van Giersbergen), overwhelmed by her emotions, becomes convinced that Amon-Ra is coming to seal her fate. She loses her will to continue and wanders alone until she lays herself down and dies as well.

The surviving characters finally reach the Electric Castle, penetrating the Castle Hall. On the Tower of Hope a breeze draws the attention of the Indian (Sharon den Adel), luring her away towards the sun despite the warning of the Knight (Damian Wilson) and the Futureman (Edward Reekers). On the breeze, she encounters Death itself (George Oosthoek and Robert Westerholt) who takes her while she screams.

The characters then come to their final test: the voice tells them that beyond them stand two gates, with one of them leading to oblivion and the second to the desired time of the heroes. One of the gates is old, deteriorated, and ugly, and the other made of gold and appears at first glance to be paradise. The Barbarian (Jay van Feggelen), in his arrogance and pride, walks through the golden gate in spite of his companion&#x27;s choice, and falls into oblivion forever.

Finally, the Knight, the Roman (Edwin Balogh), the Hippie (Arjen Anthony Lucassen) and the Futureman, who had chosen the right gate, discover the true nature of the voice: it is called &quot;Forever of the Stars&quot;, and claims that its kind is an alien race who lost all emotions. It also claims its kind caused the emergence of humanity on Earth, and that the eight heroes were in an experiment in understanding and/or rediscovering emotions. Feeling tired, the voice tells them to go on ahead and open the door, and that they won&#x27;t remember what has happened.

Back in their real time, the heroes all wonder what has happened, with the Hippie asking himself if this journey was the result of his drug abuse, the Futureman wondering if his memory has been erased, the Roman feeling stronger and the Knight thinking he found the Grail in a magic dream. The voice of the Forever of the Stars is then heard, asking them all to remember Forever.

==Reception==

&quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot; received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, who praised Lucassen&#x27;s writing and composition abilities and the performances of the singers. A Sputnikmusic reviewer stated &quot;if you’re a fan of progressive metal, or even progressive music in general, your collection will not be complete without &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot;&quot;. AllMusic reviewer Robert Taylor praised the album, saying that &quot;The massive coordination of such a large project is admirable, but to pull it off with such impressive results is stunning.&quot;

<text>James Harvey Logan (December 8, 1841 – July 16, 1928) was a judge in Santa Cruz, California, and an amateur botanist credited with the 1881 creation of the loganberry, a cross between the raspberry and the blackberry.

He was District Attorney in the 1870s and a Superior Court Judge during the 1880s and 1890s.

==Biography==
He was born on December 8, 1841, in Rockville, Indiana. After moving to Santa Cruz, Logan was elected District Attorney on 1 September 1875. He had been endorsed by both the Democrats and the Independent ticket. He had previously served as District Attorney in 1872 and 1873. Logan was subsequently elected to the Superior Court and served several terms as judge, from 1880 to 1884 and from 1893 to 1897.

Logan built the Brookdale Lodge on the site of the Grover Lumber Mill in the 1890s, purchased the Brookdale Town Site in 1902, put in a wagon road and had a cottage built in 1905, and had lots laid out in 1907. His wife, Catherine, died at Brookdale on 13 July 1909. He sold the land to John DuBois for a subdivision by 1911.

Logan married Mary E. Couson on 1 August 1910; they had a daughter—Gladys C. Logan—on 14 August 1911. Although Logan moved to Oakland, California in 1913, he continued business activity in the Santa Cruz area, building a new store in 1915.

He died on July 16, 1928, in Oakland, California.

<text>Jane Herbert Wilkinson Long (July 23, 1798 – December 30, 1880) was a Texas pioneer. She owned boarding houses and a plantation in Texas. She is best known as the &quot;Mother of Texas.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Jane Herbert Wilkinson Long was born on July 23, 1798, in Charles County, Maryland. She was a niece of General James Wilkinson; her father was James&#x27; eldest brother, William Mackall Wilkinson (c.1751–1799).

About 1811, her family moved from Maryland to the small town of Washington, Mississippi, the capital of the Mississippi Territory.

===Adult life===
She moved to Texas with her husband in the 1820s. In 1822, her husband died after being captured by Spanish/Mexican forces and she became a widow. Stephen F. Austin gave Jane grants of land in Fort Bend and Waller counties; but instead of farming, she opened a boarding house in San Felipe, Texas.

She sold part of her land in Fort Bend County, on which the town of Richmond was built. She later moved to Richmond, where she opened a boarding house and started a plantation nearby.

===Personal life===
Jane was married in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1815 to James Long, a doctor and a native of Virginia. He had led a filibuster expedition attempting to take control of Spanish Texas in 1819, and in a second attempt in April 1820 he brought his pregnant wife and 300 troops to join refugees from the first expedition on the Bolivar Peninsula near present-day Galveston. Forced to surrender along with his troops at Presidio La Bahía in October 1821, he was killed by a guard on April 8, 1822, during imprisonment in Mexico City.

Meanwhile, left behind at Bolivar Point (now Port Bolivar), Jane gave birth on December 21, 1821, to her third child, Mary James Long, with her only slave, Kian, helping. Throughout a long winter, they and her children struggled as she waited for her husband&#x27;s return. At one point, several Karankawa Indians appeared, but she fired a cannon each day to make them think there was an army stationed there. Together Jane and Kian fought starvation for weeks, hunting their own game, fishing and gathering oysters, until the news of her husband&#x27;s death finally reached her during the spring, whereupon they headed out. She then left Texas but returned in the later 1820s as a bona fide colonist.

Jane Long claimed to be the first woman of English descent to settle in Texas, and her daughter Mary is often said to be the first child born in Texas to an English-speaking woman, but this has been disproved by census records from 1807 to 1826 which show a number of Anglo-American births. 

Nevertheless because of this, she became known as the &quot;Mother of Texas.&quot; Sam Houston later gave the same title to Margaret Theresa Wright during a gubernatorial speech on August 1, 1857, in Wright&#x27;s hometown of Victoria for Wright&#x27;s heroic support of Texas troops during the Texas Revolution.

Her sister, Barbara Mackall Wilkinson, married Alexander Calvit, a sugar planter.

===Death===
She died on December 30, 1880, in Fort Bend County, Texas.

==Legacy==
A number of schools within Texas have been named after the &quot;Mother of Texas.&quot; Among them are the following: 
*Jane Long Elementary School located in Freeport in the Brazosport Independent School District
*Jane Long Elementary School located in Richmond, in the Lamar Consolidated Independent School District
*Jane Long Intermediate School located in Bryan, in the Bryan Independent School District
*Jane Long Middle School located in Houston in the Houston Independent School District
*Long Early Learning Center located in Abilene, in the Abilene Independent School District
*A marker in Fort Bend County, Texas was erected in her honor in 1936.
*Jane W Long Elementary located in Harlingen, in the Harlingen Consolidated Independent School District
*Jane Long Elementary School located in Midland, Texas, in the Midland Independent School District

<text>Terminal Tower is a 52-story, , landmark skyscraper located on Public Square in the downtown core of Cleveland, Ohio, United States. Built during the skyscraper boom of the 1920s and 1930s, it was the second-tallest building in the world when it was completed. Terminal Tower stood as the tallest building in North America outside of New York City from its completion in 1927 until 1964. It was the tallest building in the state of Ohio until the completion of Key Tower in 1991, and remains the second-tallest building in the state. The building is part of the Tower City Center mixed-use development, and its major tenants include Forest City Enterprises, which maintained its corporate headquarters there until 2018, and Riverside Company.

==Ownership==
The tower, owned by Forest City Realty Trust since 1983, was purchased by Cleveland&#x27;s K&amp;D Group on September 15, 2016 for $38.5 million (equivalent to $ in ). K&amp;D added a mixed-use element to the building, converting 11 of the lower, larger floors to residential use, with 293 one- and two-bedroom apartments. Many other historic downtown buildings are undergoing similar conversions. K&amp;D is the largest privately held owner/manager of apartment buildings in the area and maintains the tower&#x27;s upper floors as office spaces.

==Architecture==
Built for $179 million by the Van Sweringen brothers, the tower was to serve as an office building atop the city&#x27;s new rail station, the Cleveland Union Terminal. Originally planned to be 14 stories, the structure was expanded to 52 floors with a height of . It rests on caissons. Designed by the firm of Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White, the tower was modeled after the Beaux-Arts New York Municipal Building by McKim, Mead, and White. The Terminal Tower was completed in 1927 and opened for tenants in 1928, though the Union Terminal complex was not dedicated until 1930.

It remained the tallest building in the world outside of New York City until the completion of the main building of Moscow State University in Moscow in 1953; it was the tallest building in North America outside of New York until the Prudential Center in Boston was completed in 1964.

In the late 1960s through 1980s, radio station WCLV-FM (Cleveland&#x27;s fine arts station) maintained studios on the 15th floor. The transmitter was on the 43rd floor with transmission line running up the outside of the building to the antenna assembly attached to the flagpole atop the building. In the tiny cupola, which is technically the 52nd floor, there was equipment for the antenna heaters and a small telephone.

Radio station WHK placed antennas on the building to increase the range of its 1420 kHz signal.

In the 1980s, developers sought approval to make their proposed BP Building taller than the Terminal Tower, but city officials forced them to scale it down. The Terminal Tower remained the tallest building in Ohio until the 1991 completion of Society Center, now Key Tower.

===Observation deck===
On a clear day, visitors on the observation deck can see from downtown Cleveland.

After a 1976 incident involving a man with a gun, direct access to the floor was removed. The observation deck reopened after Chessie left the building.

After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the observation deck was again closed to the public. In 2007, a proposal was brought to Forest City to reopen the deck. The proposal included a renovation of the deck and the addition of an express elevator to take visitors to it. This was to be done after the upper floors were renovated and the scaffolding removed. In 2010, Forest City Enterprises finished renovating the complex&#x27;s elevators, upper floors, and spire. The observation deck reopened on July 10, 2010 for a limited period, with plans to expand public access.

To reach the observation deck, visitors take the elevator to the 32nd floor and then transfer to another elevator to reach the 42nd floor. Before its original closure, the deck was open only on weekends to prevent disruption to the law firm that has offices on the 32nd floor.

In 2018, the Observation Deck was open on weekends from noon to 4 pm, with reservations. It had been renovated to its look in the 1930s. in 2024, the Observation Deck is open on weekends in the afternoon, closed in winter except for the holidays, and tickets are reserved online.

==External lighting==

The Terminal Tower was lit when dedicated in 1930. A strobe light on top of the tower rotated 360 degrees. It helped ships in Cleveland&#x27;s port and airplane pilots landing at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.

The external spotlights that lit the tower at night were turned off as a safety measure at the beginning of World War II. They were not turned on again until September 22, 1974. They were relit on the same day that the annual Greater Cleveland United Torch Drive (a precursor to the United Way) began. Lights were installed on the 44th, 48th, and 52nd floors. In the 1960s, the strobe was retired and replaced with conventional aircraft warning lights. The tower only once went dark, during the 2003 blackout.

Today, the tower&#x27;s external lights include 508 LEDs that can be configured into various color schemes, such as red and green during the Christmas season and red, white, and blue for various federal holidays.

Many Cleveland social and medical groups light Terminal Tower for their causes. In February, Terminal Tower is red for the American Heart Association Go Red for Women campaign, and pink for Breast Cancer Awareness month in October. Some of Cleveland&#x27;s ethnic groups have had the Terminal Tower lit in their traditional colors, such as green on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. On Polish Constitution Day, usually May 3, Cleveland&#x27;s Pol-Am community lights the tower in white and red (Polish flag colors), and the tower goes red, green, and white (Italian flag colors) for Columbus Day.

Terminal Tower also sports the colors of the various sports teams in town, such as red, white, and blue for the Cleveland Guardians, orange and brown for the Cleveland Browns, and wine and gold for the Cleveland Cavaliers. During the 2014 Gay Games, the tower was lit in a rainbow pattern (representing the gay pride flag). In January 2015, Terminal Tower was lit in scarlet and gray in support of the Ohio State Buckeyes during the football team&#x27;s National Championship run as Cleveland has a large OSU fan and alumni base.

Terminal Tower was lit in teal blue on Friday, May 15, in honor of the Class of 2020 Cuyahoga Community College graduates. The Tower was lit with blue and yellow in support of Ukraine during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<text>John Davis Long (October 27, 1838 – August 28, 1915) was an American lawyer, politician, and writer from Massachusetts. He was the 32nd governor of Massachusetts, serving from 1880 to 1883. He later served as the Secretary of the Navy from 1897 to 1902, a period that included the primarily naval Spanish–American War.

Born in Buckfield, Maine, Long was educated as a lawyer at Harvard University, later settling in Hingham, Massachusetts. He became active in Republican Party politics in the 1870s, winning election for the state legislature in 1874. He rose rapidly in prominence, and was elected lieutenant governor in 1879 and governor in 1880. He advocated modest reforms during his three years as governor, which were relatively uneventful.

After returning to private practice he was offered a cabinet post by his friend, President William McKinley, in 1896. He chose to become Secretary of the Navy despite lacking detailed knowledge of naval matters. He clashed with his Under-Secretary, Theodore Roosevelt, over expansion of the Navy when the Spanish–American War broke out in 1898. He resigned the post after Roosevelt became president, and resumed his law practice. He died at his home in 1915; his publications include a lifelong journal, a history of the Spanish–American War, and a verse translation of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

==Early years==
John Davis Long was born in Buckfield, Maine on October 27, 1838, to Zadoc Long and Julia Temple (Davis) Long. He was named for Massachusetts Governor John Davis, a cousin of his maternal grandfather. He received his primary education at Hebron Academy until attending Harvard University where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1857. At Harvard he was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity&#x27;s Alpha chapter. Long wrote both prose and verse for a student magazine, and was chosen to write an ode for his class&#x27;s graduation. He also began a private journal some time before his arrival at Harvard, which he maintained throughout his life.

After two years as headmaster of Westford Academy in Westford, Massachusetts, Long began attending Harvard Law School, becoming a member of the Massachusetts bar in 1861. He practiced law, first without success in Buckfield, and then in Boston, and was active in the state militia during the American Civil War. He moved to Hingham, Massachusetts in 1869, and the following year married Mary Woodford Glover of Hingham. The couple had two daughters (and one stillborn birth) before her death in 1882.

==Massachusetts politics==
Long began his involvement in politics at the local level in Hingham in 1870. Temperance was a major issue which dominated his political beliefs. His early politics was somewhat independent: he supported the reformist Republican Benjamin Butler for governor in 1871, but received an unsolicited Democratic nomination later that year for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He did not campaign, and lost the election. Nominated by both Democrats and reformist Republicans in 1872, he lost again. He thereafter became more of a Republican stalwart, convinced that reform would be best accomplished from within the party organization.

In 1874 Long chaired the state Republican convention, and finally won election to the state legislature. He formed a close relationship with Speaker John E. Sanford, and in what historian James Hess describes as a probable move of political calculation, supported the successful gubernatorial candidate in 1875, Alexander H. Rice, even though Rice supported liberal legislation on alcohol sales that Long opposed. He was able to parlay this support into his own election to the speakership in 1876. He widened his reform views to the national stage by supporting Benjamin Bristow in his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination.

===Lieutenant Governor (1879–80)===
In 1877, Long unsuccessfully challenged the incumbent Rice for the gubernatorial nomination. When Rice announced his retirement the following year, Long again sought the nomination. It went to former Lieutenant Governor Thomas Talbot, but Long won the lieutenant governor nomination by acclamation. The Democratic opposition was divided by Benjamin Butler&#x27;s return to that party, and the Republican ticket won the general election. Long capitalized on Talbot&#x27;s avoidance of public ceremonies to maintain a high profile despite his post&#x27;s relative unimportance.

===Governor (1880–83)===
In 1879, Long was easily nominated for governor when Talbot announced he would not run for reelection, despite a lack of support from the party leadership. The election was highly divisive, pitting Long against Butler and the divided Democrats. Long was criticized for his lack of Civil War service and attacked for his diversions from the party line, but won a comfortable victory. He was reelected by comfortable margins the two following years.

Long&#x27;s time as governor was described by historian P.A.M. Tayler as relatively uneventful. He proposed a number of modest reforms, including a measured expansion of women&#x27;s voting rights (then restricted to voting for school committees), and allowing women to sit on state boards. Most of these reforms were not implemented during his tenure, although some were later enacted into law by his successors. He kept a busy schedule, attending all manner of civic events across the state.

Gov. Long re-organized the state government, disputed a statewide law regarding the death penalty, and cut taxes on mortgages in addition to local shipping. Viewing his administration as efficient, Long wrote in his journal that he &quot;filled [the governorship] well and honestly and not without grace and brilliancy.&quot;

In one of his last acts as governor, he appointed Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The lame duck appointment was occasioned by the sudden resignation of Otis Lord, a Republican who may have resigned in order to deny the appointment opportunity to the incoming Democratic Governor, Benjamin Butler. The appointment was made on December 8, 1882, the last day of Long&#x27;s term when the Governor&#x27;s Council (which had to approve the appointment) was scheduled to meet.

===Strategist for &quot;Half-Breed&quot; Republicans===
Long&#x27;s support for civil service reform aligned him with the congressional &quot;Half-Breed&quot; faction. Along with Massachusetts senators Henry L. Dawes and George F. Hoar, he formulated a strategy for the Half-Breeds in the 1880 United States presidential election.

Ultimately, the devised strategy was to push for staunch Half-Breed Vermont senator George F. Edmunds at the Republican National Convention to avoid nominating either Ulysses S. Grant, a favorite of the opposing congressional Stalwarts, or Blaine faction leader James G. Blaine, both of whom opposed civil service reform. Two factors contributed to caution surrounding the strategy of the Edmunds supporters, one being an abundance of carefulness not to reveal their plans too soon and the other pertaining to Edmunds&#x27; lack of enthusiasm for becoming president.

In early April 1880, Sen. Hoar instructed political followers of Half-Breeds that the state needed to send men to the party convention with &quot;no labels about their necks&quot; while also sending at-large delegates to be labeled conspicuously as supporters of Edmunds. The Massachusetts state convention later that month endorsed Edmunds for president. Edmunds ultimately was unable to garner enough votes to be nominated, though the Half-Breeds managed to block Grant from being selected. A last-minute maneuvering between the Half-Breeds and supporters of Blaine led to the nomination of dark horse candidate James A. Garfield, who went on to win the general election.

===U.S. Representative (1883–89)===
Long was elected to the United States Congress in the 1882 election, and served until 1889, declining to run for reelection in the 1888 election. In 1886, he was encouraged to stand for the Senate by Henry Cabot Lodge, although Lodge&#x27;s support was apparently part of a ruse to test the strength of the state party leadership. Lodge withdrew his support at the last minute, throwing it instead to the incumbent Henry L. Dawes, and the legislature reelected Dawes to the seat. The incident cooled relations between Lodge and Long. In the wheeling and dealing that preceded the Senate election, Long was offered Democratic support by Butler, but refused, believing that such votes would be seen as tainted by an unsavory political deal.

Long&#x27;s tenure in Congress was uneventful, since the Congress was under Democratic Party control for the six years he served. In addition to lobbying the administration for patronage appointments, he sat on a joint committee examining interests of shipbuilding and shipowners, as well as on conference committees dealing with pensions and Navy financing. In 1886 Long married again, to Agnes Pierce, a teacher and daughter of a Universalist minister; they had one son, born in 1887.

===Return to private practice===
Long decided in 1888 not to run for another term in Congress, and spent the next eight years in private practice. His clients were typically corporate interests, and he appeared on their behalf in court as well as in legislative committee hearings. He was sought after as a public speaker, something he engaged in for many years. He remained somewhat active in Republican Party circles, supporting Roger Wolcott&#x27;s Young Men&#x27;s Republican Club, which sought to bring new blood into the party. When offered the opportunity to challenge longtime Republican Senator George Frisbie Hoar, he refused. In 1889 he was appointed to the committee overseeing the enlargement of the Massachusetts State House, a post he held until 1897.

==Secretary of the Navy==
As a Congressman, Long had become a close friend of William McKinley, who was elected President in 1896. McKinley offered Long his choice of several cabinet posts; he chose Secretary of the Navy. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 2, 1897. The appointment brought on a storm of criticism from Henry Cabot Lodge. Lodge had been elected to the Senate, dominated the Republican Party in Massachusetts, and had expected to have a say in choosing a cabinet nominee in return for his support of McKinley. One of Lodge&#x27;s supporters complained that Long was in poor health, and that he would not give the administration &quot;back-bone and vigor&quot;. (Long had back from his law practice after a nervous breakdown.)
Lodge compensated for the setback by helping secure the position of Assistant Secretary for Theodore Roosevelt, a brash and aggressive New Yorker. Long and Roosevelt did not get along: in addition to personality differences, Roosevelt pushed a view to aggressively modernize and expand the Navy against Long&#x27;s more studied and conservative approach. He preferred to expand the Navy gradually. As the nation&#x27;s global interests grew, Long committed himself to the nation&#x27;s peaceful growth in line with McKinley&#x27;s policies. As a result of his disagreements with Roosevelt, Long took steps to control his subordinate. Roosevelt, on the other hand, sought ways to spur Long into action, writing &quot;I only wish that I could poison his mind so as to make him a shade more truculent in international matters&quot;. He also chafed against Long&#x27;s policy of deferring much of the department&#x27;s work to its permanent bureau chiefs, which resulted in constraints on the flow of information the administration received. Long was somewhat proud of the fact that he knew little of the detail of naval affairs, commenting that he was &quot;a civilian who does not know the stem from the stern of a ship&quot;.

Long believed that ongoing tensions between Spain were unlikely to lead to war, and should it, that the war would be easily won. He consequently did not take significant steps to prepare the Navy for that contingency. In January 1898, he ordered the USS &quot;Maine&quot; to Havana, Cuba, as a matter of &quot;customary relations&quot;. He and McKinley were concerned for the safety of Americans in Cuba due to the ongoing Cuban War of Independence. By early February 1898, tensions had reached crisis proportions, and Long was compelled to begin drawing up plans for war. The explosion and sinking of the &quot;Maine&quot; at Havana on February 15 was the spark that ignited the Spanish–American War. The administration was opposed to war, but the public outcry over the sinking could not be ignored. Ten days after the sinking, Long took a day off, and Roosevelt used his authority in Long&#x27;s absence to issue a number of orders designed to increase the Navy&#x27;s readiness for war, including famously ordering Commodore George Dewey into an aggressive offensive posture in the Spanish Philippines. Long countermanded some of Roosevelt&#x27;s orders afterward, but began stepping up naval war preparations.

The loss of the &quot;Maine&quot; highlighted to the administration the nation&#x27;s shortage of modern warships, setting off a scramble for the acquisition of more ships. One significant order given by Long was to transfer the USS &quot;Oregon&quot; (one of the Navy&#x27;s most powerful ships) from the west coast to the Caribbean; the ship made the journey around Cape Horn from San Francisco to Key West, Florida, in 66 days. War was declared in April 1898. Roosevelt resigned his post the next month, a move Long thought foolhardy but later acknowledged was significant in advancing Roosevelt&#x27;s career.

Long directed the Navy&#x27;s activities throughout the war, significantly increasing its size in the process. He ordered Dewey to neutralize the Spanish fleet in the Philippines, ordered the seizure of Spanish Guam, and worked to support a blockade and offensive operations against Cuba. He also directed naval resources into threatening postures against mainland Spain to encourage the Spanish recall of a fleet destined for the Philippines.

In response to increasing pressure from Navy leaders, Long created a permanent advisory staff after the war. The board, created in March 1900, was designed to unify the work of the Office of Naval Intelligence, the Naval War College, and the fleet leadership for the production of war plans and the proper preparation, planning, and deployment of naval resources in pursuit of objectives defined in those plans. After the war, Long pushed forward plans to establish a naval base in the Philippines, however, the funding for plans was held up in Congress, which repeatedly sought review of potential base locations in the islands. The matter was also caught up in branch rivalry with the War Department, which objected to the Navy&#x27;s establishment of a permanent base there that was not under its authority. Construction of the Subic Bay Naval Base did not begin until after Long left office.

Long was promoted as a potential vice presidential candidate by the Massachusetts delegation to the 1900 Republican National Convention, and was a personal favorite of McKinley&#x27;s for the position. However, party leaders objected to him on geographic grounds, and Lodge (with whom Long continued to feud) disingenuously wore a Long banner, even though he supported Roosevelt, who easily won the nomination. The McKinley–Roosevelt ticket won the election, and Long decided to stay on for McKinley&#x27;s second term.

==Later years==
After McKinley was assassinated in September 1901, Long had a change of heart, and tendered his resignation to President Roosevelt on May 1, 1902. The exact reasons for this are unclear, but several factors probably contributed. First, Roosevelt had a close relationship with Long&#x27;s political rival Lodge, was known to disagree with Long on naval matters, and was not welcoming of his presence at the White House. Second, an inquiry into the actions of Admiral Winfield Scott Schley around the July 1898 Battle of Santiago de Cuba had resulted in a significant amount of criticism of Long&#x27;s role in the war. Third, one of his daughters died in October 1901, less than a month after McKinley&#x27;s assassination. These matters drove Long into a depression, and the situation was further exacerbated when Roosevelt squabbled with him over the beginning of the war, and then made newsworthy overrides of some of his decisions. Historian Wendell Garrett notes that Roosevelt took a great personal interest in the Navy, and had difficulty working with subsequent secretaries.

Long returned to Massachusetts, where he resumed his law practice and remained interested in party politics. He sat on a few corporate boards and served as president of the Puritan Trust Company. He was in 1914 a member of Harvard&#x27;s Board of Overseers. He continued to advocate for women&#x27;s suffrage, and served on the boards of several private schools, include his alma mater, Hebron Academy. He regularly spent time in Maine (having in 1882 repurchased the family home in Buckfield), and fell ill there in August 1915. He returned home to Hingham, where he died on August 28.

==Writings and legacy==
In addition to Long&#x27;s extensive journal, he wrote on a variety of other subjects. During his unsuccessful attempt to start a law practice in Buckfield he produced a paper on Congressional power and slavery. While in Boston in the early 1860s he had a play produced locally. In 1878 he produced a verse translation of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. In 1903 he published &quot;The New American Navy&quot;, a history of the Spanish–American War and the development of the Navy during that time.

Among Long&#x27;s charitable works was funding the establishment of a public library in Buckfield in 1900, which is now known as the Zadoc Long Free Library. USS &quot;Long&quot; (DD-209) was named in his honor.

<text>Fatal Frame, titled in Japan and Project Zero in Europe and Australia, is a Japanese survival horror video game series that was created, published and developed by Koei Tecmo (originally Tecmo). Debuting in 2001 with the first entry in the series for the PlayStation 2, the series consists of five main entries. The series is set in 1980s Japan, with each entry focusing on a location beset by hostile supernatural events. In each scenario, the characters involved in the present investigation use Camera Obscura, objects created by Dr. Kunihiko Asou that can capture and pacify spirits. The series draws on staple elements of Japanese horror, and is noted for its frequent use of female protagonists.

The series was conceived by Makoto Shibata and Keisuke Kikuchi. After being introduced to the PlayStation 2 hardware and after the success of the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series, the pair decided to develop a horror series inspired by Shibata&#x27;s own spiritual experiences and popular Japanese horror films of the time. Their main goal was to make the most frightening game experience possible. Later installments have refined the gameplay mechanics while also adding more complex narrative elements.

The series is recognized as one of the best-known horror video game franchises, and the second game in the series, &quot;Crimson Butterfly&quot;, is considered one of the scariest horror games ever made. While the sales of individual games have never been high, the series as a whole has sold over one million copies worldwide as of April 2014. Multiple Japanese adaptations have been made, including manga and a 2014 live-action feature film.

==Titles==
As of 2014, the series consists of five main-line video games, not counting remakes, rereleases and spin-offs. &quot;Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse&quot; was originally only released in Japan. While a European release was planned, it was eventually cancelled, and no North American release was planned. A fan translation of the fourth game was released in 2010, which enabled the game to be played on any Wii system. Outside their international releases, the &quot;Fatal Frame&quot; games are not numbered. This was due to the series&#x27; creators considering each entry to be a standalone game, with minimal connections to previous titles. Since the fourth game, new &quot;Fatal Frame&quot; titles have been funded and co-developed by Nintendo, resulting in new series titles since the fourth game originally only appearing on Nintendo consoles. Koei Tecmo would later purchase Nintendo&#x27;s publishing rights for multi platform rereleases of &quot;Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse&quot; and &quot;Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water&quot;.

A mobile title, &quot;Real Zero&quot;, was released in 2004 for FOMA and DoCoMo mobile devices. The game involves users taking pictures of their environments and superimposing ghost images somewhere in the frame. Seventy different ghosts were available to collect, with each new ghost triggering the sending of an email to provide clues for finding the next ghost or other messages. The game&#x27;s service was terminated in 2011. A spin-off for the Nintendo 3DS, &quot;Spirit Camera&quot;, was released in all regions in 2012. The story follows a girl named Maya, who is trapped in a haunted house controlled by a mysterious woman in black, and seeks to escape the woman&#x27;s control.

=== Pachinko ===
In May 2020, a pachislot machine simply titled &quot;Pachislot Zero&quot; was announced by Yamasa Group. Set to be released in Japan for pachinko parlors in July 2020, the game recreates scenes from the first game in the series with updated graphics, along with additions like new characters and a third ending.

===Related media===
To commemorate the release of &quot;Crimson Butterfly&quot;, a special interactive attraction titled &quot;Zero4D&quot; opened in 2004. It featured movie scenes designed by the same team behind the CGI movies for &quot;Crimson Butterfly&quot;. A manga based on the series written by Shin Kibayashi, &quot;Fatal Frame: Shadow Priestess&quot;, was released in both Japanese and English through DeNA&#x27;s website in July 2014. A Japanese live-action movie directed by Mari Asato for Kadokawa Pictures was released in cinemas in 2014. The novel it was based on, &quot;Fatal Frame: A Curse Affecting Only Girls&quot; by Eiji Ohtsuka, was released a few months prior to the movie.

A Hollywood film adaptation of the first game was announced in 2003. Robert Fyvolent and Mark R. Brinker were hired as the project&#x27;s writers, and John Rogers was hired as its producer. The title was being produced by DreamWorks. Later that year, Steven Spielberg was helping Rogers to polish the game&#x27;s script, and that sessions to find a director and cast the movie would follow. In 2014 alongside the formal announcement of &quot;Maiden of Black Water&quot;, it was confirmed that the Hollywood film was still planned. Now produced by Samuel Hadida, it was set to begin production after the completion and release of the game. Christophe Gans said in an interview that the movie will take place in Japan in an attempt to capture its Japanese haunted house setting.

==Common elements==
===Series gameplay===

The gameplay has remained consistent through the series&#x27; lifetime. Each environment is filled with ghosts, with separate games having different attack behaviors for them. While navigating these environments, the main character&#x27;s only means of defense is the Camera Obscura, which can be used to damage ghosts, capturing them on film and pacifying them. When using the camera, the view switches from a third-person to a first-person perspective. The camera locks onto a ghost, with the amount of damage dealt depending on how much of a focus the Camera Obscura has on the ghost, but ghosts fade in and out of existence, making focusing more challenging. Shots of varying closeness and angles also affect how much damage the ghost takes. The most damaging is a &quot;Fatal Frame&quot;, which is performed by taking a photo just before a ghost&#x27;s attack lands, dealing massive damage and allowing a combo if subsequent shots are timed correctly. A ghost&#x27;s captured spirit energy is converted into points, which can be used to buy items to upgrade the Camera Obscura and obtain more powerful film.

In addition to hostile ghosts, there are passive ghosts encountered in parts of the environment: if they are not caught on film at once, they vanish from the rest of the game. Ghosts captured on film are added to a list, which reveals a ghost&#x27;s past. For the first three games, navigation is done using semi-fixed third-person view of environments, with characters moving at a slow pace through them. For &quot;Mask of the Lunar Eclipse&quot; and later entries, the camera perspective was altered to a third-person over-the-shoulder view and character movement was increased a little to speed up gameplay. The ability to either dodge or break free from a ghost&#x27;s grip was added in &quot;Maiden of Black Water&quot;.

===Setting===
The &quot;Fatal Frame / Project Zero&quot; series is set in the 1980s, before mobile phones were commonly used in Japan. Aside from a few recurring characters, each game has a self-contained story focusing on a different supernatural threat. The main unifying factor is navigating through haunted locations struck by a supernatural catastrophe, with a recurring setting being abandoned Japanese mansions. Recurring characters include Dr. Kunihiko Asou, an occultist who lived in the 1800s and created objects such as the Camera Obscura; and Miku Hinasaki, the protagonist of &quot;Fatal Frame&quot; and one of three protagonists in &quot;The Tormented&quot;, who also appears in &quot;Maiden of Black Water&quot; as one of the main characters&#x27; missing mother. A second recurring feature is the exclusive or frequent use of female characters in the leading role. This was explained as being due to the overall tone of the series: since traditional violence was not used, it was better to use a female character to convey this. It was also felt that women were more spiritually aware than men. Another recurring concept is a pseudo-physical location bridging the physical and spiritual worlds, inspired by a tanka written by Japanese poet Taeko Kuzuhara: these were represented by the Hellish Abyss in &quot;Crimson Butterfly&quot; and the lake in &quot;Maiden of Black Water&quot;.

The first chronological entry in the series, &quot;Mask of the Lunar Eclipse&quot;, takes place in 1980. The story revolves around three girls who travel back to the fictional Rougetsu Island to recover memories of being kidnapped while they lived there ten years before. On the island, they must investigate the secrets behind a local ritual dance and an ancient mask related to the ritual. &quot;Fatal Frame&quot; is set in 1986, with &quot;Crimson Butterfly&quot; being set in 1988 &quot;The Tormented&quot; is set two months after the second game&#x27;s events. &quot;Maiden of Black Water&quot; is set at an unspecified date after the third game. It takes place around the fictional Mount Hikami, a site infamous for suicides and rituals associated with local bodies of water. The main protagonists are each drawn to the mountain intent on rescuing someone, confronting hostile ghosts along the way.

==History and development==
The concept for &quot;Fatal Frame / Project Zero&quot; first occurred by Makoto Shibata. The idea occurred after the development of &quot;Tecmo&#x27;s Deception: Invitation to Darkness&quot;. Inspired by his own experiences of supernatural events, and heartened by the success of the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series, Shibata and Keisuke Kikuchi set to work on creating the basics for the game. Shibata was in charge of the majority of game and scenario development, while Kikuchi was in charge of general oversight. When creating the atmosphere, the team watched both high and low-budget Japanese horror films, and war films. One of their goals was to make the game as scary as possible. The Camera Obscura was not in the initial discussions between Shibata and Kikuchi, with the original idea being that ghosts would be avoided and repelled by light. Ultimately, they decided to have a type of offensive power, which resulted in the Camera&#x27;s creation. Kikuchi was initially opposed to the idea, but saw that it fit very well into the game&#x27;s context as development progressed. The first game was marketed in the West as being based on a true story, and while this was not accurate, the story of &quot;Fatal Frame&quot; was inspired by both real locations noted for alleged haunting and local ghost-related folklore.

For &quot;Crimson Butterfly&quot;, the team toned down the frightening aspects so players would be willing to complete a playthrough, alongside creating a stronger story. The story was inspired by a dream Shibata had, with the interpretive nature of the game&#x27;s events being inspired by his feelings about the dream. For &quot;The Tormented&quot;, they decided to focus on horror elements emerging out of everyday life, focusing on the effects of dreams upon reality. &quot;Mask of the Lunar Eclipse&quot; was co-produced by Koei Tecmo, Nintendo and Grasshopper Manufacture, with Grasshopper Manufacture&#x27;s Goichi Suda acting as a co-director with Shibata. The gameplay was constructed around the Wii hardware, with the main concept being for players to feel the fear physically. The entire concept occurred by Kikuchi when he saw the specifications for the Wii. &quot;Maiden of Black Water&quot; originated when Kikuchi saw the Wii U hardware, and was co-produced by Koei Tecmo and Nintendo. As they wanted to bring more people into the series, they included a stronger narrative and new gameplay elements to make the experience easier for newcomers.

Since &quot;Crimson Butterfly&quot;, theme songs have been created for each title, primarily performed by Japanese singer Tsuki Amano. The development team wanted an image song for &quot;Crimson Butterfly&quot;, and Shibata found the then-newly debuted Amano in the Japanese independent community. Amano created the song using documents on the game&#x27;s story, themes and setting. Amano returned multiple times to create theme songs for &quot;The Tormented&quot;, &quot;Mask of the Lunar Eclipse&quot;, and a new theme song for the Wii remake of &quot;Crimson Butterfly&quot;. She again returned for &quot;Maiden of Black Water&quot;, and a second new singer AnJu contributed a second theme song to the title.

==Reception==
In Japan, each title in the &quot;Fatal Frame / Project Zero&quot; series has seen modest success: the first game&#x27;s lifetime sales are the lowest in the series, while &quot;Mask of the Lunar Eclipse&quot; currently stands as the best-selling title in the series to date. Since its debut in 2001, the &quot;Fatal Frame&quot; series has sold 1.3 million copies worldwide.

Multiple video game journalists have singled out the series. IGN&#x27;s Clara Barraza, in an article on the evolution of the survival horror genre, said that the first game &quot;broke away from the use of weapons like guns and planks of wood to switch it up and try something completely different&quot;, praising the use of the Camera Obscura in evoking a sense of fear and calling the game &quot;[a] unique spin on the genre&quot;. In a different article for IGN on the history of survival horror, editor Travis Fahs stated that the series gave a much-needed boost to the genre during a period of decline in the early 2000s, highlighting the Japanese horror aesthetic as a selling point that attracted players in tandem with the popularity of &quot;The Ring&quot;. As part of an interview with the series&#x27; creators in 2006, GameSpy writer Christian Nutt referred to it as one of the three best-known horror video game series alongside &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;Silent Hill&quot;. Similarly, as part of a review of &quot;Maiden of Black Water&quot;, Dennis Scimeca of &quot;The Daily Dot&quot; ranked the &quot;Fatal Frame&quot; series alongside &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;Silent Hill&quot;. In an article on the series, Kotaku writer Richard Eisenbeis said that &quot;Fatal Frame&quot; succeeded in drawing his attention when most other horror games did not, generally praising the settings and the &quot;master stroke&quot; of the Camera Obscura in gameplay. In an interview, &quot;F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin&quot; art leader Dave Matthews stated that the gameplay of &quot;F.E.A.R. 2&quot; was influenced by the &quot;Fatal Frame&quot; series. In multiple articles, &quot;Crimson Butterfly&quot; has been singled out by video game publications and industry developers as one of the scariest games of the horror genre in general.

<doc id="755469" wikidata="Q319700" url="?curid=755469" title="Alexander Ypsilantis">
<text>Alexandros Ypsilantis (12 December 1792 – 31 January 1828) was a Greek nationalist politician who was member of a prominent Phanariot Greek family, a prince of the Danubian Principalities, a senior officer of the Imperial Russian cavalry during the Napoleonic Wars, and a leader of the Filiki Etaireia, a secret organization that coordinated the beginning of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire.

==Early life==
The Ypsilantis family hailed from the Pontic Greek population of Trabzon. He was born on 12 December 1792 in Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, as the eldest of five brothers (the others being Demetrios, Nicholas, Georgios and Grigorios). His father Constantine Ypsilantis and grandfather Alexander were active in the Ottoman administration and highly educated, each with their own share of service as a dragoman in the Sultan&#x27;s court and as hospodars of the Danubian Principalities. His mother, Elisabeta Văcărescu was member of the Văcărescu family of Wallachia.

==Russian military service==

With the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War in 1805, his father fled with family to Imperial Russia. The young Alexander had received a thorough education, becoming fluent in Russian, French, German and Romanian. At the age of 15, he was presented to the Russian Court, where he came under the patronage of Empress Maria Feodorovna.

On 12 April 1808, he entered a commission in the prestigious Chevalier Guard Regiment with the rank of cornet. Moving rapidly up the ranks, he was promoted to lieutenant on 27 September 1810 and to Stabs-Rittmeister on 18 October of the same year. During the French invasion of Russia, he fought in the battles of Klyastitsy and Polotsk. Promoted to full Rittmeister (captain) on 20 February 1813, he went on to participate in the Battle of Bautzen. On 6 July, he was transferred to the Grodno Hussar Regiment as lieutenant colonel, and participated with his new unit in the Battle of Dresden, where his right arm was torn off by a shell.

Although he was immediately promoted to full colonel, it meant that Ypsilantis would not be able to see action again. However, he attended the Congress of Vienna, where he was a popular figure in society (see Auguste Louis Charles La Garde de Chambonas, &quot;Souvenirs&quot;), and earned the sympathy of Tsar Alexander I, who appointed him his aide-de-camp on 1 January 1816. In late 1817, at the age of 25, he became a major general and commander of the 1st Brigade of Hussars of the 1st Hussar Division.

==Preparations for the Greek insurrection==
In 1820, on the refusal of Count Ioannis Kapodistrias, the Russian foreign minister, to accept the post of leader of the Filiki Eteria, the post was offered to Ypsilantis, who was then elected as the leader of the secret society. Following that, he processed and approved the general plan of the Greek war of Independence, which was revised during May 1820 at Bucharest, with the participation of rebel captains from mainland Greece.

The main points of the plan were:
* to aid the simultaneous revolt of Serbs and Montenegrins.
* to provoke a revolt in Wallachia, by also enlisting rebels from the Serbian lands, battle-hardened from the first and second Serbian uprisings.
* to provoke civil unrest in Constantinople through the use of agents, and burn the Ottoman fleet at the city&#x27;s port.
* to start the revolution in Greece in the Peloponnese, after Ypsilantis&#x27; arrival there.

Ypsilantis issued a declaration on 8 October 1820, announcing that he would soon be starting a revolt against the Ottoman Empire. Ypsilantis began his declaration by praising ancient Greece, writing: &quot;Cast your eyes toward the seas, which are covered by our seafaring cousins, ready to follow the example of Salamis. Look to the land, and everywhere you will see Leonidas at the head of the patriotic Spartans&quot;. Ypsilantis went on to say that the Greeks did not need foreign help as they could defeat the Turks on their own before going on to say that Russian support was assured.

==Campaign in Moldavia and Wallachia==
Because information regarding the existence and the activities of the &quot;Filiki Eteria&quot; had leaked to the Ottoman authorities, Ypsilantis hastened the outbreak of the revolt in Wallachia and participated personally in it. Beginning the revolution in the Danubian Principalities had the added benefit that they, being autonomous under the joint suzerainty of Russia and the Ottoman Empire, did not have Ottoman garrisons, while in turn the local leaders were entitled to maintain small armed retinues for their own protection. Legally, the Ottomans could not move their forces into Wallachia or Moldavia without Russia&#x27;s permission, and if the Ottomans sent their forces in unilaterally, Russia might go to war. The Prince of Moldavia, Michael Soutsos was a Phanariot Greek who was secretly a member of the Philiki Eteria, but at the same time however, Soutsos was an opportunist who hedged his bets by secretly informing the Sublime Porte of the planned invasion. Therefore, on 22 February 1821 (O.S.), accompanied by several other Greek officers in Russian service, Ypsilantis crossed the Prut river at Sculeni into the Principalities. Two days later, at Iaşi he issued a proclamation, announcing that he had &quot;the support of a great power&quot; (meaning Russia).

Ypsilantis hoped that a revolt would ultimately lead to a Russian intervention: since the Ottomans would have to invade and quell the rebellion, the Orthodox Russians would certainly intervene in favour of their fellow Orthodox. In this hope he was justified, since eventually, the Greek rebellion led to the Russo-Turkish War of 1828 in which Russian troops marched to the outskirts of Constantinople and forced the Sultan to recognize the autonomy of the new Greek state. In 1821 however, Tsar Alexander was still a committed member of the Holy Alliance, and acted swiftly to disassociate himself from Ypsilantis: Count Capodistria denounced Ypsilantis for having misused the Tsar&#x27;s trust, stripped him of his rank and commanded him to lay down arms. Soon after, Capodistria himself had to take an &quot;indefinite leave of absence&quot; from his post.

These moves emboldened the Turks, who began assembling a large number of troops to quell the insurrection in Wallachia. Ypsilantis marched from Iaşi to Bucharest, trying to enlist volunteers. Ypsilantis was constantly short of money and his men turned to plundering the region. At Galați, one of Ypsilantis&#x27; officers, Vasilios Karavias murdered the local Turkish merchants to raise funds while in Iași the local Ottoman guard of 50 men were killed after surrendering and received promises that their lives would be spared. It was then that the Sacred Band was formed, comprising young Greek volunteers from all over Europe. Ypsilantis advanced slowly, not entering Wallachia until early April, by which time Tudor Vladimirescu had seized Bucharest. A further problem arose when the Patriarch Grigorios placed an anathema on Ypsilantis as an enemy of the Orthodox faith, called on true believers to remain loyal to the Sultan, and denounced Ypsilantis for &quot;a foul, impious and foolish work&quot;.

In Bucharest, where he had arrived after some weeks&#x27; delay, it became plain that he could not rely on the Wallachian Pandurs to continue their Oltenian-based revolt for assistance to the Greek cause; Ypsilantis was met with mistrust by the Pandur leader Tudor Vladimirescu, who, as a nominal ally to the Eteria, had started the rebellion as a move to prevent Scarlat Callimachi from reaching the throne in Bucharest, while trying to maintain relations with both Russia and the Ottomans. More fundamentally, Ypsilantis and other Greek leaders relied on the support of the Romanians, on the base of their common Christian Orthodox faith, and underestimated the increasing resentment of Greek influence in the Principalities during the Phanariote era and the first stirrings of what would become Romanian nationalism.

Further, Vladimirescu regarded the Russian renunciation of Ypsilantis as absolving him from any further commitment to the Filiki Eteria. As a result, a conflict erupted inside Vladimirescu&#x27;s camp. In the end, Vladimirescu was summarily tried and put to death by the pro-Greek faction and the Eteria.
In the meantime, the Ottomans crossed the Danube river with 30,000 tactical troops, and Ypsilantis, instead of advancing on Brăila, where he arguably could have prevented the Ottoman armies entering the Principalities and might have forced Russia to accept a &quot;fait accompli&quot;, retreated and organized his defense at a semi-mountainous area close to Iaşi. There followed a series of major battles that led to the defeat of the Eteria&#x27;s forces, culminating in the final defeat at Drăgăşani on 7 June. After a long march in the rain, Ypsilantis&#x27;s army was exhausted, but Karavias, who was drunk, led the Sacred Band into a charge against the Ottomans. As the inexperienced and ill-trained men of the Sacred Band did not form squares, which would have allowed them to pack enough firepower together, the Ottoman cavalry had no difficulty in cutting down the rebels.

After the defeat, Ypsilantis fled north. Ypsilantis, in his final declaration to his men, refused to accept responsibility for his failure and blamed his men for all his failures, writing: &quot;Soldiers! No! I will no longer pollute that sacred and honourable name by applying it to you. You are a cowardly rabble!...You have broken your oaths, you have betrayed God and your country, you have betrayed me too at the moment when I hoped either to conquer or to die with honor among you...Run off to the Turks, who alone are worthy of your support...run off to the Turks, and kiss their hands from which still drips the blood of those they have inhumanely slaughtered. Yes! Run off to them, buy slavery with your lives and with the honor of your wives and children!&quot; Ypsilantis&#x27;s army booed him when he read out this declaration.

==Refuge==
Ypsilantis, accompanied by what remained of his followers, retreated to Râmnic, where he spent some days in negotiating with the Austrian authorities for permission to cross the frontier. Fearing that his defeated followers might surrender him to the Turks, he gave out that Austria had declared war on Turkey, caused a &quot;Te Deum&quot; to be sung in the church of Cozia, and, on pretext of arranging measures with the Austrian commander-in-chief, crossed the frontier. But the reactionary policies of the Holy Alliance were enforced by Francis I and Klemens Metternich, and the country refused to give asylum for leaders of revolts in neighboring countries. Ypsilantis was kept in close confinement for seven years (1823 to 1827 in Terezín), until he was released at the insistence of the emperor Nicholas I of Russia.

==Death==

After his release, he retired to Vienna, where he died in extreme poverty and misery on 29 January 1828. His last wish that his heart be removed from his body and sent to Greece was fulfilled by Georgios Lassanis, and it is now located at the Amalieion in Athens. His appearance in likenesses and the accounts of his life suggest he had dystrophia myotonica, a congenital multi-system disorder.

His body was originally buried on St. Marx cemetery. Much later, on 18 February 1903, his remains were transferred by members of his family to the Ypsilanti-Sina estate, Schloss Rappoltenkirchen, Sieghartskirchen, Austria. His last transfer occurred in August 1964, when he was finally relocated to the Taxiarches Church in Pedion tou Areos, Athens, Greece, 136 years after his death.

==Cultural references==
Alexander Ypsilantis is mentioned in Russian literature by Alexander Pushkin in his short story &quot;The Shot&quot;. The hero of Pushkin&#x27;s story, Silvio, dies in a campaign under command of Ypsilantis.

<text>Stephen Harriman Long (December 30, 1784 – September 4, 1864) was an American army civil engineer, explorer, and inventor. As an inventor, he is noted for his developments in the design of steam locomotives. He was also one of the most prolific explorers of the early 1800s, although his career as an explorer was relatively short-lived. He covered over 26,000 miles in five expeditions, including a scientific expedition in the Great Plains area, which he famously confirmed as a &quot;Great Desert&quot; (leading to the term &quot;the Great American Desert&quot;).

==Biography==
Long was born in Hopkinton, New Hampshire, the son of Moses and Lucy (Harriman) Long. Long&#x27;s Puritan ancestors came from England during the Puritan migration to New England. He received an A.B. from Dartmouth College in 1809 and an A.M. from Dartmouth in 1812. In 1814, he was commissioned a lieutenant of engineers in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Upon the reorganization of the Army in 1816, he was appointed a Major on 16 April and assigned to the Southern Division under Maj. Gen. Andrew Jackson as a topographical engineer.

In 1817, Major Long headed a military excursion up the Mississippi River to the Falls of St. Anthony near the confluence with the Minnesota River. As a result of his recommendations, the Army established Fort Snelling to guard against Native American incursions against settlers in the Upper Mississippi Valley. Long recorded his experiences of the expedition in a journal, which was first published as &quot;Voyage in a Six-oared Skiff to the Falls of St. Anthony&quot;, by the Minnesota Historical Society in 1860.

In March 1819 he married Martha Hodgkiss of Philadelphia, the sister of Isabella Hodgkiss Norvell, wife of US Senator John Norvell. Soon afterwards he led the scientific contingent of the 1819 Yellowstone Expedition to explore the Missouri River. In 1820 he was appointed to lead an alternative expedition through the American West, exploring areas acquired in the Louisiana Purchase. The specific purpose of the voyage was to find the sources of the Platte, Arkansas, and Red rivers.

Later, in 1823 he led additional military expeditions into the United States borderlands with Canada, exploring the Upper Mississippi Valley, the Minnesota River, the Red River of the North and across the southern part of Canada. During this time he determined the northern boundary at the 49th parallel at Pembina. In that same year, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

Following his official military expeditions, Major Long spent several years on detached duty as a consulting engineer with various railroads. Initially he helped to survey and build the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. In 1826, he received his first patent for his work on railroad steam locomotives. Long received many more patents for locomotive design and worked with other Army engineers in planning and building the railroad. Long also received patents in 1830 and 1839 for pre-stressing the trusses used in wooden covered bridges.

In 1832, along with William Norris and several other business partners, he formed the American Steam Carriage Company. The business was dissolved in 1834 due to the difficulties in placing Long&#x27;s locomotive designs into production. From June to November, 1836, Long led two parties of about 15 each to conduct a survey of a route inland from the shores of the Penobscot Bay at Belfast, Maine to Quebec for the proposed Belfast &amp; Quebec Railroad which had been chartered by the State of Maine on March 6, 1836. In his report to Governor Robert P. Dunlap of Maine, Col. Long recommended a route into Quebec of 227 miles from &quot;Belfast to the Forks of the Kennebec, and by a line of levels thence to the Canadian line.&quot; However a then provision in the Maine Constitution which prohibited public loans for purposes such as building railroads as well as the financial panic of 1837 intervened to kill the project.

Colonel Long received a leave of absence to work on the newly incorporated Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad in Georgia. His yearly salary was established at $5,000, the contract was signed May 12, 1837, and he served as the chief engineer for the W&amp;A until November 3, 1840. He arrived in north Georgia in late May and his surveying began in July and by November he had submitted an initial report which the construction followed almost exactly.

In 1838 he was appointed to a position in the newly separated U.S. Corps of Topographical Engineers. Like most of their officers Major Long remained loyal to the Federal government during the Civil War, and he became Colonel of the Corps in 1861 until its merger back into the U.S. Corps of Engineers in 1863. He died in Alton, Illinois in 1864.

==Expeditions==
===Great Plains (1820)===

Like most engineers, Long was college-trained, interested in searching for order in the natural world, and willing to work with the modern technology of the time. Topographical engineers had basically two unique points of view that set them apart from the other pioneers — geographical and technological.

In 1818 he was appointed to organize a scientific contingent to accompany soldiers of Col. Henry Atkinson&#x27;s command on the Yellowstone Expedition (sometimes called the Atkinson-Long Expedition). This was planned to explore the upper Missouri, and Long spent the autumn designing the construction of an experimental steamboat for the venture, &quot;Western Engineer&quot;. Departing from St. Louis in June 1819, it was the first steamboat to travel up the Missouri River into the Louisiana Purchase, and the first steamboat to have a stern paddle wheel. On September 17, Long&#x27;s party arrived at Fort Lisa, a trading fort belonging to William Clark&#x27;s Missouri Fur Company. It was about five miles south of Council Bluffs, Iowa. Long&#x27;s group built their winter quarters nearby and called it &quot;Engineer Cantonment.&quot;

Within a month, Long returned to the east coast, and by the following May, his orders had changed. The Yellowstone Expedition had become a costly failure and so instead of exploring the Missouri River, President James Monroe decided to have Long lead an expedition up the Platte River to the Rocky mountains and back along the border with the Spanish colonies. Exploring that border was vital, since John Quincy Adams had just concluded the treaty with Spain, which drew a new U.S. border to the Pacific.

Major Long was the leader of the first scientific exploration up the Platte, which planned to study the geography and natural resources of the area. His party of 19 men included landscape painter Samuel Seymour, naturalist painter Titian Peale, zoologist Thomas Say and Edwin James, a physician knowledgeable in both geology and botany. James led the first recorded ascent of Pikes Peak during this expedition. On June 6, 1820, they traveled up the north bank of the Platte and met Pawnee and Otoe people. On October 14, 1820, 400 Omaha assembled at a meeting with Long, where Chief Big Elk made the following speech:

:&quot;Here I am, my Father; all these young people you see around here are yours; although they are poor and little, yet they are your children. All my nation loves the whites and always have loved them. Some think, my Father, that you have brought all these soldiers here to take our land from us but I do not believe it. For although I am a poor simple Indian, I know that this land will not suit your farmers. If I even thought your hearts bad enough to take this land, I would not fear it, as I know there is not wood enough on it for the use of the white.&quot;

Long wrote that the Pawnee people were &quot;respectable.&quot; After finding and naming Longs Peak and the Rocky Mountains, they journeyed up the South Platte River to the Arkansas River watershed. The expedition was then split, and Long led his group towards the Red River. They missed it, ran into hostile Native Americans and had to eventually eat their own horses to survive before they finally met the other part of the expedition at Fort Smith (now a city on the western border of the state of Arkansas).

====Report====
In his report of the 1820 expedition, Long wrote that the Plains from Nebraska to Oklahoma were &quot;unfit for cultivation and of course uninhabitable by a people depending upon agriculture.&quot; On the map he made of his explorations, he called the area a &quot;Great Desert.&quot; Long felt the area labeled the &quot;Great Desert&quot; would be better suited as a buffer against the Spanish, British, and Russians, who shared the continent with the United States. He also commented that the eastern wooded portion of the country should be filled up before the republic attempted any further extension westward. He commented that sending settlers to that area was out of the question. Given the technology of the 1820s, Long was right. There was little timber for houses or fuel, minimal surface water, sandy soil, hard winters, vast herds of bison, resident Native Americans, and no easy means of communication. However, it is ironic that the Native tribes had been living there for centuries and that, by the end of the 19th century, the &quot;Great Desert&quot; had become the nation&#x27;s breadbasket.

There were two key results of this expedition—a very accurate description of Native American customs and life as they existed among the Omaha, Otoes, and Pawnees and his description of the land west of the Missouri River as a &quot;desert&quot;.

===Red River of the North (1823)===

Major Long&#x27;s 1823 expedition up the Minnesota River (then known as St. Peter&#x27;s River), to the headwaters of the Red River of the North, down that river to Pembina and Fort Garry, and thence by canoe across British Canada to Lake Huron is sometimes confused with his initial expedition to the Red River in modern-day Texas and Oklahoma. The expedition to the Red River of the North was a separate, later appointment which completed a series of explorations conceived of by Lewis Cass and implemented by David Bates Douglass, Henry Schoolcraft, and others besides Major Long. The 1823 expedition was denoted primarily as a scientific reconnaissance (one of its members was geologist William H. Keating) and an evaluation of trade possibilities, but probably had undisclosed military objectives as well, and certainly was viewed with suspicion by British authorities in Canada. This expedition for a time was joined by the Italian adventurer Giacomo Beltrami, who argued with Long and left the expedition near Fort Garry. The 1823 expedition encouraged American traders to push into the fur trade in Northern Minnesota and Dakota, and fostered the development of the Red River Trails and a colorful chapter of ox cart trade between the Red River Colony and Fort Garry via Pembina and the newly developing towns of Mendota and St. Paul.

==Marine Hospitals and Napoleon, Arkansas==
In 1837 Congress authorized the building of seven Marine Hospitals. Long was commissioned to build the first hospital for the Treasury Department at Louisville, Kentucky. Long had been commissioned to build the hospital along with his other duties but construction would be delayed until the Mexican War was over. It wasn&#x27;t until the end of 1845 that work finally began. During the completion of the Louisville Marine Hospital, Long would also start work on building similar Marine Hospitals in Paducah, Kentucky; Natchez, Louisiana and Napoleon, Arkansas. These Marine Hospitals were based upon plans provided by Robert Mills, the architect of the Washington Monument.

Long was commissioned to build the Marine Hospital at Napoleon, Arkansas in 1849. Napoleon, Arkansas was situated at the southern mouth of the Arkansas River. After a completing a survey Long had objections to building at Napoleon because of the tendency for flooding and likelihood that the town would face destruction in the future thanks to the unwieldy Mississippi and Arkansas Rivers. He had petitioned for Helena, Arkansas to be a suitable alternative. In early 1850 Long&#x27;s objections to the location were rebuffed. Senator Solon Borland, ignoring Long&#x27;s objections to the location of Napoleon, reported to the Corps of Topographical Engineers that the situation at Napoleon had been discussed before the bill which would create the Marine Hospital at Napoleon was passed. The erection of the hospital at Napoleon without delay was then ordered. In the Spring of 1850 Long requested $10,250 in order to begin construction at Napoleon but it wasn&#x27;t until August that construction finally started thanks to flooding which hampered building the foundation and cellar. Delays continued to dog the construction and by the Spring of 1851 the supervisor wrote Long suggesting suspension of the work as contracts were expiring due to delays and sickness had been rampant thanks to Spring floods. Work resumed in October 1851 and the slow pace continued over the next three years. By August 1854 the hospital was finally finished but apparently the hospital did not accept its first patients until 1855. The city of Napoleon would be burned in 1862 by General Sherman, but the hospital survived. Federal Forces did not use the hospital for its intended purpose, instead patients were sent elsewhere. While the hospital did survive the war it wouldn&#x27;t last long.

Long&#x27;s observations and objections had been accurate. By March 11, 1868, the river had eroded the land to 52 feet from the hospital&#x27;s doors. Less than a month later, and nearly four years after Long&#x27;s death, a corner of the hospital fell into the Mississippi River. The entire town of Napoleon was swallowed twenty-eight years after Long first objected to building the hospital at Napoleon.
Of the Marine Hospitals that Long oversaw, the hospital at Louisville, Kentucky, remains today.

<text>James Michael Aloysius Bradford (born 16 March 1954), known as Jimmy Nail, is an English singer-songwriter, actor, film producer, and television writer. He played the role of Leonard &quot;Oz&quot; Osborne in the television show &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot; (1983-1986), the title role in &quot;Spender&quot; (1991-1993) and Jed Shepperd in &quot;Crocodile Shoes&quot; (1994-1996). He also recorded a 1992 number one single, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Doubt&quot;. His role as Agustín Magaldi, the oily crooner in the 1996 film &quot;Evita&quot;, gave him international recognition.

==Early life==
James Michael Aloysius Bradford was born in Newcastle upon Tyne to father Jimmy and mother Laura. His father was an Irish Catholic shipyard worker, amateur boxer, and professional footballer. Nail describes himself as an angry child who was expelled from secondary school for setting fire to curtains. When he was 13, his sister, Shelagh, died at a party from an overdose of alcohol and antidepressant drugs aged 20. He later spent time drinking, fighting, and generally rebelling against authority. He was involved in a fight after a Newcastle United F.C. match during the 1970s and served a short prison sentence for grievous bodily harm.

After being released, he worked in a glass factory. While opening a crate of glass he stood on a six-inch spike that went through his foot and thereafter was called &quot;Nail&quot;, a name he later adopted professionally. Also at that time he sang in a rock band called the King Crabs. His sister Val McLane is an actress who co-founded the Live Theatre Company in Newcastle in 1973 and later became Head of Drama at Sunderland University.

==Career==
Nail has enjoyed a wide and varied career since his big break in 1983, not only has he appeared in multiple television shows, he has appeared in several movies, released a number of albums and also acted on stage in various theatre productions.
===Television===
In 1982 Nail&#x27;s partner, Miriam, encouraged him to audition for a television show, and although he had no experience as an actor, he won the role of &quot;Oz&quot; Osborne in the BAFTA-nominated &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot;, an ITV comedy drama about UK construction workers working abroad. After a slow beginning in 1983, ratings reached 17 million. He also appeared in the second series, which aired for 13 weeks in 1986.

In 1989 Nail and Ian la Frenais began work on an idea which became the BBC television drama series &quot;Spender&quot;. &quot;Spender&quot; ran for three series, totalling 22 hours, airing from 1990-92, and included a 2-hour Christmas special in 1993. Ratings stayed around 14 million throughout the series&#x27; run. 

In 1994 Nail created, executive produced, wrote and starred in the BBC television drama series &quot;Crocodile Shoes&quot;. Originally conceived as a single film for BBC2, the series ran on BBC1 for two series over 13 hours. The series averaged around 9 million viewers per episode. The show&#x27;s eponymous album went on to sell over one million copies.

In 2000, he began work on reviving the &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot; series, this time for the BBC. It was filmed in Middlesbrough and Arizona in 2001 and aired in 2002, with audience figures of 12.9 million. The series was BAFTA-nominated. Another series saw the brickies holed up in Havana, and the final two-hour instalment, set in Laos, broadcast over Christmas 2004 attracting over seven million viewers.

In 2008, Nail created and starred as Phil Parker in &quot;Parents of the Band&quot;, a six-episode series on BBC1, broadcast between November 2008 and January 2009. The series revolved around a group of teenagers who formed a band just for their own enjoyment, and their parents, who fully expected them to be the next Led Zeppelin. Ratings were disappointing, around three million viewers.

===Music===
Before becoming an actor, Nail had been a musician for many years on the local scene in Newcastle and was most notably the lead singer in the King Crabs, known locally as The Crabs. He was renowned for performing in his girlfriend&#x27;s dress and a pair of Doc Marten boots.

Following his success in &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot;, record companies became interested in Nail releasing a record. In 1985, he recorded the album, &quot;Take It Or Leave It&quot;, which included the single, &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;, a cover of the Rose Royce hit. It was a hit for Nail, peaking at No. 3 in the charts and leading to his first appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. After that success, his music career took a back seat. 

After seven years away, Nail re-emerged in 1992 with the pop hit &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Doubt&quot;, co-written by Nail, Danny Schogger, Guy Pratt and Charlie Dore. It peaked at No. 1 and spent three weeks at the top of the charts, leading to multiple appearances on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The album, &quot;Growing Up In Public&quot;, was also a success and peaked at No. 2 in the UK Album Charts. The album featured guests such as Gary Moore, David Gilmour, Elliot Randall and George Harrison.

Nail&#x27;s music career took off, and his third album, &quot;Crocodile Shoes&quot;, was released in conjunction with the television programme, &quot;Crocodile Shoes&quot;, which began airing on BBC1 in November 1994. Not only was the title track a hit, peaking at No. 4, further singles, &quot;Cowboy Dreams&quot; and &quot;Calling Out Your Name&quot; also hit the charts, with the album itself peaking at No. 2, selling over a million copies.

In 1995, his fourth release hit the shelves, &quot;Big River&quot;, which hit No. 8, scoring yet another Top 10 album. The title track, which was a tribute to his hometown of Newcastle, was also a success, peaking at No. 18 and saw Nail perform it on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Mark Knopfler also featured on the track as guest guitarist. &quot;Big River&quot; is often played prior to kick-off at Newcastle United&#x27;s home, St James&#x27; Park. A version of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Love&quot; was also released as a single and hit No. 33 in the charts towards the end of 1995.

In 1996, &quot;Crocodile Shoes II&quot; was released, once again in conjunction with the television series. While it did not hit the heights of the first release, the album still performed well, peaking at No. 10. The lead single, &quot;Country Boy&quot;, peaked at No. 25.

In 1997, Nail&#x27;s back catalogue was deemed good enough to release a compilation, &quot;The Nail File: The Best of Jimmy Nail&quot;, which also had an accompanying VHS which included all the music videos for the tracks. While it included all the hits from his career, it included a new track, a cover of &quot;Black and White&quot;, where he duetted with Ranking Roger. It was released as a single and peaked at No. 76. 

In 1999, &quot;Tadpoles In A Jar&quot; was released and hit No. 79 in the charts. &quot;Ten Great Songs and an OK Voice&quot; (Papillon, 2001) was an album comprising many of his favourite songs by other writers. Nail sang on the film soundtrack for &quot;Evita&quot; and received a double-platinum disk in recognition of 600,000-plus sales of the eponymous album. 

With Tim Healy, Nail co-founded the Sammy Johnson Memorial Fund, established in 1999 in memory of their friend and colleague Sammy Johnson, to help young talent in North East England. He has participated in the &quot;Sunday for Sammy&quot; benefit concerts. To date the fund has given out over £600,000 in bursaries and support. Nail performed at the 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006 shows before he resigned from the board due to work commitments.

After some time away from the limelight, Nail joined Sting on stage during a show at Sage, Gateshead on 5 February 2012 to sing on &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;.

===Theatre and film===

Nail worked as an extra on the British gangster film &quot;Get Carter&quot; (1971). Although this has been disputed in some quarters, in his 2004 autobiography &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; (paperback edition pp. 69-70, 133, 175-176) he confirms his involvement in the movie, albeit momentarily, and how he got to joke about that &quot;moment&quot; some years later with &quot;Get Carter&quot; director Mike Hodges when the two worked together on &quot;Morons From Outer Space&quot; (1985). 

Nail played gamekeeper &quot;Rabbetts&quot; in &quot;Danny, the Champion of the World&quot;, a 1989 television film based on the novel of the same name by Roald Dahl, and had a lead singing role in the 1996 film adaptation of &quot;Evita&quot;.

In 1998 Nail played Les Wickes in the Columbia Pictures film &quot;Still Crazy&quot;. The film&#x27;s main theme, &quot;The Flame Still Burns&quot;, performed by Nail, was nominated for a Golden Globe award.

In 2014 Nail came out of retirement to act and sing in &quot;The Last Ship&quot;, a musical by Sting about the shipbuilders of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, the hometown of both Nail and Sting. Sting grew up in Wallsend, down the street from the shipyards. Nail worked in the shipyards and is the son of a shipyard foreman. The show opened in Chicago. On Broadway, when ticket sales began to drop, Sting replaced Nail to try to save the musical, but it ended after a short run. Nail sang on the Original Broadway Cast Recording and on Sting&#x27;s album, &quot;The Last Ship&quot;.

Nail played Parson Nathaniel in a twelve week run of the Bill Kenwright production of &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; alongside David Essex and Michael Praed at the Dominion Theatre, London in 2016.

Nail had been due to reprise his role in the UK production of &quot;The Last Ship&quot; at Northern Stage on 12 March 2018. The show&#x27;s producer Karl Sydow stated: &quot;After protracted negotiations carried out in good faith, we regret to announce the production&#x27;s offer of employment to Jimmy Nail has been withdrawn. Joe McGann will replace him when the show opens in Newcastle in March.&quot; Nail said &quot;I was very much looking forward to appearing in Sting&#x27;s &quot;The Last Ship&quot;, particularly here in my home city, sadly that&#x27;s not to be.&quot; 

In 2019 Nail began working on &quot;Seconds Away!&quot;, a play with music, for the Newcastle-based Live Theatre Company. This culminated in a two-week run of a staged reading of the play, which commenced on 6 February 2024. Nail has written the songs in the show and also plays the main character, Frankie Tanner.

==Defamation lawsuit==
In 2004, Nail successfully sued News Group Newspapers and Harper Collins Publishers. The lawsuit concerned false and defamatory allegations made two years before in an article in &quot;News of the World&quot; and &quot;Nailed&quot;, a biography which was the newspaper&#x27;s source for the claims. He described reading the article as one of the worst experiences of his life. He reportedly received damages of £30,000.

==Personal life==
Nail has two children and lives in Newcastle. He is a Newcastle United fan. He has been a patron of FACT, a North-East based cancer charity, since 2017.

<doc id="755477" wikidata="Q2272090" url="?curid=755477" title="Constantine Ypsilantis">
<text>Constantine Ypsilantis ( &quot;Konstantinos Ypsilantis&quot;; ; 1760 – 24 June 1816) was the son of Alexander Ypsilantis, a key member of an important Phanariote family, Grand Dragoman of the Porte (1796–1799), hospodar of Moldavia (1799–1802) and Walachia (1802–1806), and a Prince through marriage to the daughter of Alexandru Callimachi.

==In Ottoman service==
Constantine Ypsilantis served as Grand Dragoman of the Ottoman government in 1796–1799, in conjunction with his father&#x27;s appointment as Prince of Moldavia. He played a role in turning the Ottoman Empire against Revolutionary France, culminating in its joining the Second Coalition, and sponsored the occupation of the French-ruled Ionian Islands and the creation of the Septinsular Republic. In this post, he also translated three French military manuals for the reformed Nizam-i Djedid Army then being created by Sultan Selim III. 

==Resistance against the Ottoman Empire==

Ypsilantis had joined in a conspiracy to liberate Greece and, on its discovery, fled to Vienna, had been pardoned by the sultan and in 1799 appointed by him hospodar of Moldavia. Deposed in 1805, he escaped to St Petersburg, and in 1806, at the head of some 20,000 Russians, returned to Bucharest, where he set to work on a fresh attempt to liberate Greece.

==Union of Moldavia and Wallachia==
From 1806, during Russian occupation of the Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, Russia encouraged their provisional union under Prince Constantine Ypsilanti. Russia preferred their union for improved relations with the Principalities and their formal union was planned for 1830.

Ypsilantis&#x27; plans were ruined by the Peace of Tilsit and in 1807 he emigrated with his family to Russia.

==Legacy==
Ypsilantis died, in Kyiv, where he had served as commandant of the Pechersk Fortress since 1807. He left five sons, of whom two played a conspicuous part in the Greek War of Independence: Alexander and Demetrios.

<text>Cassius Longinus (; ; c. 213 – 273 AD) was a Greek rhetorician and philosophical critic. Born in either Emesa or Athens, he studied at Alexandria under Ammonius Saccas and Origen the Pagan, and taught for thirty years in Athens, one of his pupils being Porphyry. Longinus did not embrace the Neoplatonism then being developed by Plotinus, but continued as a Platonist of the old type and his reputation as a literary critic was immense. During a visit to the east, he became a teacher, and subsequently chief counsellor to Zenobia, queen of Palmyra. It was by his advice that she endeavoured to regain her independence from Rome. Emperor Aurelian, however, crushed the revolt, and Longinus was executed.

==Life==
The origin of his gentile name Cassius is unknown; it can only be conjectured that he was the client to some Cassius Longinus, or that his ancestors had received the Roman franchise through the influence of some Cassius Longinus. He was born about 213, and was killed in 273, at the age of sixty. The suggestion that his original name was Dionysius arose only because the 1st century rhetorical treatise &quot;On the Sublime&quot; was ascribed to a &quot;Dionysius or Longinus&quot; in the medieval period.

His native place is uncertain; some say that Longinus was a born in Emesa, while others say he was born in Athens. The &quot;Suda&quot; states that Fronto of Emesa, the uncle of Longinus, taught rhetoric at Athens, and on his death in Athens left behind him Longinus, the son of his sister Frontonis.

It would seem that Fronto took special care of the education of his nephew, and on his death-bed he made him his heir. In the preface to his work &quot;On Ends&quot;, which is preserved in Porphyry&#x27;s &quot;Life of Plotinus&quot;, Longinus himself relates that from his early age he made many journeys with his parents, that he visited many countries and became acquainted with all those who at the time enjoyed a great reputation as philosophers, among whom the most illustrious were Ammonius Saccas, Origen the Pagan, Plotinus, and Amelius. Of the first two Longinus was a pupil for a long time, but Longinus did not embrace the Neoplatonism then being developed by Ammonius and Plotinus, rather he continued as a Platonist of the old type.

Longinus in his study of philosophy made himself thoroughly familiar with Plato&#x27;s works; and that he himself was a genuine Platonist is evident from the fragments still extant, as well as from the commentaries he wrote on several of Plato&#x27;s dialogues. The few fragments of his commentaries which have come down to us show that he was free from the allegorical notions by which his contemporaries claimed to have discovered the wisdom of the ancients. His commentaries not only explained the subject-matter discussed by Plato, but also his style and diction. In opposition to Plotinus, Longinus upheld the doctrine that the Platonic ideas existed outside the divine &quot;Nous&quot;. Plotinus, after reading his treatise &quot;On First Principles&quot;, remarked that Longinus might be a scholar, but that he was no philosopher.

After Longinus had learnt all he could from Ammonius at Alexandria and the other philosophers whom he met in his travels, he returned to Athens. He there devoted himself with so much zeal to the instruction of his many pupils that he scarcely had any time left for writing. The most distinguished of his pupils was Porphyry. At Athens, Longinus seems to have lectured on philosophy and criticism, as well as on rhetoric and grammar, and the extent of his knowledge was so great, that Eunapius calls him &quot;a living library&quot; and &quot;a walking museum;&quot;. The power for which Longinus was most celebrated was his critical skill, which was indeed so great that the expression &quot;to judge like Longinus&quot; became synonymous with &quot;to judge correctly&quot;.

After having spent much of his life at Athens composing the best of his works, he went to the East, either to see his friends at Emesa or to settle some family affairs. It seems to have been on that occasion that he became known to queen Zenobia of Palmyra, who, being a woman of great talent, and fond of the arts and literature, made him her teacher of Greek literature. As Longinus had no extensive library at his command at Palmyra, he was obliged almost entirely to abandon his literary pursuits. He soon discovered another use for his talents, for when king Odaenathus died Queen Zenobia undertook the government of the empire. She availed herself of the advice of Longinus; it was he who advised and encouraged her to shake off Roman rule and become an independent sovereign. As a result, Zenobia wrote a spirited letter to the Roman emperor Aurelian. In 273, when Aurelian took and destroyed Palmyra, Longinus had to pay with his life for the advice which he had given to Zenobia. Longinus must have been especially pained by this catastrophe, as the queen asserted her own innocence after having fallen into the hands of the Romans, and threw all the blame upon her advisers, particularly Longinus. He bore his execution with a firmness and cheerfulness worthy of Socrates.

In his private life Longinus seems to have been amiable; for although his pupil Porphyry left him, declaring that he would seek a better philosophy in the school of Plotinus, Longinus did not show him any ill-will, but continued to treat him as a friend, and invited him to come to Palmyra. He had an ardent love of liberty, and a great frankness both in expressing his own opinions and exposing the faults and errors of others.

==Writings==
Notwithstanding his many avocations, Longinus composed a great number of works, which appear to have been held in the highest estimation, all of which have perished. It was once thought that the extant rhetorical treatise &quot;On the Sublime&quot; was written by him, but it is now thought to have been written by an unknown 1st century writer. Among the works listed by the &quot;Suda&quot; there are &quot;Homeric Questions&quot;, &quot;Homeric Problems and Solutions&quot;, &quot;Whether Homer is a Philosopher&quot;, and &quot;two publications on Attic diction&quot;. The most important of his philological works, &quot;Philological Discourses&quot;, consisting of at least 21 books, is omitted. A considerable fragment of his &quot;On the Chief End&quot; is preserved by Porphyry. Under his name there are also extant Prolegomena to the &quot;Handbook of Hephaestion&quot; on metre, and the fragment of a treatise on rhetoric, inserted in the middle of a similar treatise by Apsines. It gives brief practical hints on invention, arrangement, style, memory and other things useful to the student.

<doc id="755480" wikidata="Q701205" url="?curid=755480" title="Luigi Longo">
<text>Luigi Longo (15 March 1900 – 16 October 1980), also known as Gallo, was an Italian communist politician and general secretary of the Italian Communist Party from 1964 to 1972. He was also the first foreigner to be awarded an Order of Lenin.

==Early life==
Longo was born in Fubine, in the province of Alessandria, Piedmont. As a student at the Politecnico di Torino, he became active in the youth wing of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), and engaged in political propaganda from a Marxist perspective. He was a regular visitor to the offices of &quot;L&#x27;Ordine Nuovo&quot;, the newspaper founded by Antonio Gramsci, and became acquainted with Gramsci and Palmiro Togliatti. In 1921, at the Livorno Congress of the PSI, he was one of the instigators of the split in the party, when supporters of Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Bolshevik line left to form the Italian Communist Party (PCI). He became a leading figure in the new PCI along with Togliatti, Gramsci and others.
Longo was a fervent anti-fascist, and, when Benito Mussolini established his Fascist regime in Italy in 1922, he emigrated to France where he became one of the principal leaders of the PCI. In the same year, he was a member of a delegation to the Comintern Congress in Moscow, where he met Lenin. He would return to Moscow several times in the years to come, with a specific expertise in political ideology, and was to meet Joseph Stalin and other members of the Soviet Union leadership. In 1933 he became a member of the Comintern&#x27;s political commission. In 1934 he signed a joint action agreement between the PCI and the PSI.

==Spanish Civil War and Resistance==
Longo took part in the Spanish Civil War as an inspector of the Republican troops in the International Brigades under the leadership of Randolfo Pacciardi, and took the nom de guerre &quot;Gallo&quot;. After the defeat of the Second Spanish Republic by General Franco, he returned to France.
Following the 1940 invasion of France, the Vichy-based collaborationist government was established under Philippe Pétain. Longo was arrested and detained in an internment camp at Vernet from 1939 to 1941. There he made the acquaintance of Leo Valiani, among other left-wing radicals. In 1941 he was handed over to the Italian fascist authorities and interned at Ventotene. When Mussolini fell from power on 25 July 1943, Longo was released. After Mussolini regained control of Northern Italy (which he led as the Italian Social Republic), Longo took command of the Garibaldi Brigades, the communist forces in the Italian partisan resistance. Longo became deputy commander of the &quot;Gruppo volontari per la liberta&quot; (&quot;Group of Volunteers for Freedom&quot;), and a close collaborator of Ferruccio Parri; in April 1945 Longo was one of the leading figures of the uprising in northern Italy. It was at Dongo on Lake Como on 28 April 1945 and whilst being escorted by the Garibaldi Brigade partisans that Mussolini and his mistress Claretta Petacci were executed; the extent to which Longo took part in the killings has been the subject of dispute by historians.

==Post-war==
After the war, he was a member of the National Congress and in 1946 was elected to the Constituent Assembly. Also in 1946, Teresa Mattei chose the mimosa as the symbol of International Women&#x27;s Day at the request of Longo. He was subsequently elected, and repeatedly re-elected, to the Italian Chamber of Deputies on the PCI list and was a member of the party leadership. In 1964, after the death of Palmiro Togliatti, he became secretary of the PCI, declaring that he was &quot;a secretary, not a boss&quot;. In this role, he continued Togliatti&#x27;s line, known as the &quot;Italian road to Socialism&quot;, playing down the alliance between the Italian Communist Party and the Soviet Union. He reacted without hostility to the new left movements that sprang up in 1968 and, among the leaders of the PCI, was one of those most disposed to engage with the new activists, although he did not condone their excesses.
In late 1968 Longo suffered a stroke; although he partially recovered in the subsequent months, from February 1969 he was assisted in most decisions by Enrico Berlinguer acting as vice-secretary. In 1972 Longo resigned from the position of party secretary, supporting the choice of Berlinguer as his successor. From that year until his death, eight years later in Rome, he was honorary president of the PCI. In that capacity, he expressed his opposition to the &quot;national solidarity&quot; line the PCI was later to espouse.

Longo was also a prolific writer. He was the founder of &quot;Vie Nuove&quot;, a popular magazine of the Communist Party.

<doc id="755485" wikidata="Q1394172" url="?curid=755485" title="Hospodar">
<text>Gospodar or hospodar, also gospodin for short version, is a term of Slavic origin, meaning &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;master&quot;. The compound (, , , , ) is a derivative of &quot;gospod&quot; / &quot;gospodin&quot;, , or when spelled with a capital G (&quot;Gospod&quot; / &quot;Gospodin&quot;) it translates as Lord for God.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the word can be traced back to the connotation of the Indo-European patron-client and guest-host relationship.

=== Patron-client ===
Rich patrons sponsored feasts as a way for them to promote and secure a political hierarchy built on the unequal mobilization of labor and resources, by displaying their generosity towards the rest of the community. Rivals competed publicly through the size and complexity of their feasts, and alliances were confirmed by gift-giving and promises made during those public gatherings. The host of the feast was called the *&quot;ghosti-potis&quot;, the &#x27;lord of the guests&#x27;, who honored the immortal gods and his mortal guests with gifts of food, drink, and poetry.

=== Guest-host ===
In Proto-Indo-European, the term *&quot;ghós-ti&quot;-, whose original meaning must have been &quot;table companion&quot;, could either mean a &quot;host&quot; or a &quot;guest.&quot; The connotation of an obligatory reciprocity between both guests and hosts has persisted in descendant cognates, such as Latin &quot;hospēs&quot; (&quot;foreigner, guest; host&quot;), Old English &quot;ġiest&quot; (&quot;stranger, guest&quot;), or Old Church Slavonic &quot;gostĭ&quot; (&quot;guest&quot;) and &quot;gospodĭ&quot; (&quot;master&quot;).

The &quot;*potis&quot; compound is rare as a Slavic lexeme. It might have arisen as an additional calque of the Greek &#x27;&quot;despótēs&#x27; (-πότης),&quot; yet the presence of &quot;*potis&quot; in Iranic languages e.g Avestani &quot;dəng&quot; &quot;paitiš&quot; “master of the house”, might indicate an older and universal usage of the compound. The word &quot;*batь&quot; (attested in Bulgarian and Ukrainian and meaning bigger brother and later additionally transforming into &quot;&#x27;bashta&quot;&#x27; or father in Bulgarian) is shared among Uralic, Turkic and Iranic languages, with the p- &gt; b- transformation likely indicating a transition through a Turkic language of an originally Indo-European word. Another view is that it is a baby-talk modification of &quot;*bratrъ&quot; (“brother”), since it morphologically resembles kin terms ending in &quot;*-tь&quot;, including &quot;*zętь&quot; (“son-in-law”), &quot;*tьstь&quot; (“father-in-law”), &quot;*netь(jь)&quot; (“nephew”). The Proto-Slavic word &quot; (“watchman, guard”)&quot; is also notable in its relation to the word and is a later loanword in Hungarian.

==&quot;Gospodar&quot; v. &quot;hospodar&quot;==
The pronunciation &quot;&quot;hospodar&quot; (i.e. with a fricative) of a word written as &quot;господар&quot;&quot; in some Slavic languages, which retains the Cyrillic script, could be due to the influence of either Ukrainian, where the first letter is pronounced as [ɦ], or that of Belarusian and Church Slavonic, where it is pronounced as [ɣ].

==Slavic usage==

In the Slavic language family, compound &quot;&quot;gospodar&quot; / &quot;hospodar&quot; is usually applied to the master/owner of a house/household or other property and also the head of a family or clan. In some languages the &quot;hospodar&quot;s house or household is called &quot;hospóda&quot;&quot;, however, in other, such as in South Slavic, &quot;(&quot;g)ospoda&quot; translates as &quot;gentry&quot; as just a plural derived from &quot;gospodin&quot; and/or &quot;gospodar&quot;. There is also an alternative form for the head of the household, &quot;gazda&quot;, &quot;gazdarica&quot; as a feminine, and &quot;gazdinstvo&quot;&quot; as a household and/or property. &quot;Gazda&quot; form is also common in Hungary.

In Slovene, Macedonian, Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian, &quot;gospodar&quot; (&quot;господар&quot;) means a &quot;master&quot;, &quot;lord&quot;, or &quot;sovereign lord&quot;. 
Other derivatives of the word include &quot;gospodarstvo&quot;, which means ownership, household and property, and economy, &quot;gospodin&quot; (господин), which translates as &quot;Sir&quot;, &quot;gentleman&quot; and/or &quot;Mister&quot; (in Bulgarian, Russian, Macedonian, and Serbo-Croatian), and &quot;&quot;gospodstvo&quot; (in Serbo-Croatian). Meanwhile, &quot;Gospod&quot; and &quot;Gospodin&quot;&quot; refers to God and is identical to Russian &quot;gospod`&quot; (господь, &quot;the Lord&quot;) and &quot;gosudar&quot;&#x27; (&quot;&quot;).

In Slovene &quot;gospod&quot; (&quot;Mister&quot;, &quot;gentleman&quot;), the Polish &quot;gospodarz&quot; (&quot;host&quot;, &quot;owner&quot;, &quot;presenter&quot;) usually used to describe a peasant/farmer (formal name for a peasant/farmer is &quot;rolnik,&quot; and common is &quot;chłop&quot; which also means &quot;guy&quot;), and the Czech &quot;hospodář&quot; (archaic term for &quot;master&quot;). All forms stem from the Proto-Slavic word &quot;gospodü&quot; (господъ). 
In Slovak and Czech, the word &quot;Hospodin&quot; (capitalized) is an older and rare address of God. Related to it is &quot;hospodár&quot;, in a stricter sense an owner or manager of a farm or similar establishment (&quot;poľnohospodárstvo&quot;) or agriculture is composed of &quot;field&quot; and &quot;hospodár&quot;. In a broader sense, a manager of any resource. The verb &quot;hospodáriť&quot; is translated as &quot;to manage&quot;, esp. money and property. In Czech, the word &quot;Hospodin&quot; (capitalized) is another address to God. Related to it is &quot;hospodář&quot; referring to a person, that manages some property (e.g. steward, major-domo, bailiff, manciple or bursar), especially in agriculture (e.g. husbandman, farmer, landowner).

===Medieval usage examples===
The title was used briefly towards the end of the Second Bulgarian Empire. In 1394–95, Ivan Shishman of Bulgaria referred to himself not as a Tsar (as traditionally), but as a &quot;gospodin&quot; of Tarnovo, and in foreign sources was styled herzog or merely called an &quot;infidel bey&quot;. This was possibly to indicate vassalage to Bayezid I or the yielding of the imperial title to Ivan Sratsimir.

In Bosnia and Serbia all male persons of noble status were referred to as &quot;gospodin&quot; regardless of their hereditary title, even monarchs.

After his conquest of the Principality of Galicia, Casimir III was styled &quot;Gospodar of the Rusian Land&quot; in the Ruthenian language. When the region was ceded to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, &quot;gospodar&quot; subsequently became a title of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania. In that sense it is also used in official documents (e.g. the granting of privileges to the Kiev Voivodeship), as Chancery Slavonic was an official language in the eastern parts of the Grand Duchy. The Ruthenian-language Book of Inscriptions No. 8 in the Lithuanian Metrica also attests to the regular use of the style &quot;hospodar&quot; by subjects when addressing the Grand Duke of Lithuania.

===In popular culture===
As a term denoting authority the word &quot;gospodar&quot; has also been the subject of ironic derision. A good example is the song &quot;Gospodar&quot; from the early 1980s by the Slovene punk rock band Pankrti.

== Non-Slavic usage ==

The rulers of Wallachia and Moldavia were styled &quot;hospodars&quot; in Slavic writings from the 14th century to 1866; the English equivalent of this title is Lord (with the meaning of autonomous ruler). &quot;Hospodar&quot; was used in addition to the title &quot;voivod&quot;. When writing in Romanian, the term Domn (from the Latin &quot;dominus&quot;) was used. At the end of this period, as the title had been held by many vassals of the Ottoman Sultan, its retention was considered inconsistent with the independence of the United Principalities&#x27; (formalized from Romania only in 1878 — replacing the tributary status).

The term made its way into the Romanian language after many centuries, but under a different meaning &quot;gospodar&quot; (female: &quot;gospodină&quot;) means a good manager of a household or a property (&quot;gospodărie&quot;).

Hungarian word &quot;gazda&quot; = &quot;potentate&quot;, &quot;rich landowner&quot; is borrowed from the language of Southern Slavs who inhabited today&#x27;s Hungary before the arrival of the Hungarians, aka Magyars, to Europe.
