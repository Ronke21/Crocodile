<text>123 Brunhild is a stony S-type main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by German-American astronomer C. H. F. Peters on July 31, 1872, and named after Brünnehilde, a Valkyrie in Norse mythology. Brunhild has been mistaken for the non-existent variable star KN Gem.

In 1983, 123 Brunhild was observed photometrically from the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, producing an irregular light curve that showed eight extremes, including two minima and two maxima that were more accentuated than the others. This curve indicates an irregular shape or possibly areas with higher albedo, with a rotation period of 10.04 ± 0.02 hours and a brightness variation of 0.16 ± 0.01 in magnitude.

Based upon IRAS observations, the estimated diameter of this asteroid is 47.97 ± 2.6 km with a geometric albedo of 0.2134 ± 0.026. A smaller diameter value of 41.33 ± 1.73 km is obtained from the Midcourse Space Experiment observations, with an accordingly higher albedo of 0.2886 ± 0.0247.

<text>The NSU Ro 80 is a four-door, front-engine executive sedan manufactured and marketed by the West German firm NSU from 1967 until 1977.

Noted for innovative, aerodynamic styling by Claus Luthe and a technologically advanced powertrain, the Ro 80 featured a , twin-rotor Wankel engine driving the front wheels through a semi-automatic transmission with an innovative vacuum-operated clutch system. Engine dimensions (Comotor units): length ; width , height , weight . Power at 6,500 rpm; torque at 3,000 rpm (all figures approximate).

The Ro 80 was voted Car of the Year for 1968 and 37,398 units were manufactured over a ten-year production run, all in a single generation.

== Running gear ==
Other technological features of the Ro 80, aside from the powertrain, were the four-wheel ATE Dunlop disc brakes, which were generally only featured on expensive sports or luxury saloon cars. The front brakes were mounted inboard, reducing the unsprung weight. The suspension was independent on all four wheels, with MacPherson struts at the front and semi-trailing arm suspension at the rear, both of which are space-saving designs commonly used today. Power-assisted ZF rack and pinion steering was used, again foreshadowing more recent designs.

== Transmission ==
The car featured an automatic clutch which was commonly described as a three-speed semi-automatic gearbox: there was no clutch pedal, but instead, touching the gear lever knob operated an internal electric switch that operated a vacuum system which disengaged the clutch. The gear lever itself then could be moved through a standard &quot;H-pattern&quot; gate.

== Styling ==
The styling, by Claus Luthe who was head of design at NSU and later BMW, was considered very modern at the time; the Ro 80 has been part of many gallery exhibits of modern industrial design. The large glass area foreshadowed the 1970s designs such as Citroën&#x27;s. The shape was also slippery, with a drag coefficient of 0.355 (very low for the era). This allowed for a top speed of . Indeed, comparisons have been drawn between the design of the Ro 80 and the aerodynamic 1982 Audi 100 built in the same factory some 15 years later.


== Interior ==
Interior trim combined cloth-covered seats with PVC headlining and a carpeted floor. Leather seats were a factory option, although rarely specified.

== Evolution ==
The company&#x27;s limited resources focused on improving the reliability of the rotary engine, with much attention given to the material used for the three rotor tips (apex seals) for the oval-like epitrochoid-shaped rotor housing that sealed the combustion chambers. A feature of the engine was its willingness to rev quickly and quietly to very high engine speeds, but it was precisely at these high speeds that damage to key engine components occurred: all Ro 80s came with a rev counter, but cars produced after 1971 also came with an &quot;acoustical signal&quot; that warned the driver when the engine was rotating too fast.

The Ro 80 remained largely unchanged over its ten-year production. From September 1969 the rectangular headlights were replaced with twin halogen units, and air extractor vents appeared on the C-pillar behind the doors. In August 1970 a slightly reshaped plastic grill replaced the metal grill of the early cars, and a minimal facelift in May 1975 saw the final cars getting enlarged rear lights and rubber inserts in the bumpers which increased the car&#x27;s overall length by 15 mm to 4,795 mm. The placement of the rear license plate was also changed from below the bumper to above it. This resulted in the boot lid lock being repositioned to the rear lip of the boot lid itself, instead of just below it.

== Unreliability ==

The car developed an early reputation for unreliability. The Ro 80 engine in particular suffered from construction faults, among many other problems, and some early cars required a rebuilt engine before , with problems arising as early as . Originally, the rotor tip seals were made in three pieces, out of the same material. The motor&#x27;s design caused the centre section to wear more quickly at cold starts compared to the other pieces; the worn centrepieces allowed the two other parts of the seal to move, which in turn allowed combustion products to escape the seals. The tip seal centrepiece was then redesigned using ferrotic material, and the problem was entirely resolved. The fact that the rotary engine design had inherently poor fuel economy (typically 13-16 L/100 km) and a poor understanding of the Wankel engine by dealers and mechanics did not help this situation. By the 1970 model year, most of the reliability issues had been resolved, but a necessarily generous warranty policy and damage to the car&#x27;s reputation had undermined NSU&#x27;s financial situation irreparably. NSU was acquired by Volkswagen in 1969 and merged with Auto Union to create the modern-day Audi company.

== Production ==
Series production began in October 1967 and the last examples came off the production line in April 1977.

During 1968, the first full year of production, 5,986 cars were produced, increasing to 7,811 in 1969 and falling slightly to 7,200 in 1970. After this output declined, to about 3,000 - 4,000 per year for the next three years. The relatively high fuel consumption of the rotary engine worked against the car after the dramatic fuel price rises accompanying the oil crisis of 1973, and between 1974 and 1976 annual production came in well below 2,000 units. In total 37,398 Ro80s were produced during the ten-year production run. Ultimately, it was the contrasting success of the similarly sized Audi 100 that sealed both the fate of the Ro 80, and the NSU brand as a whole within the Auto Union-NSU combine, as parent company Volkswagen began nurturing Audi as its performance-luxury brand in the late 1970s. After the discontinuation of the Ro 80 in 1977, the Neckarsulm plant was switched over entirely to producing Audi&#x27;s C- and D- platform vehicles (the 100/200, and later the Audi A6 and A8), and the NSU brand disappeared from the public eye.

<text>124 Alkeste is a main-belt asteroid, and it is an S-type (siliceous) in composition. C.H.F. Peters discovered the asteroid on August 23, 1872, from the observatory at Hamilton College, New York State. The name was chosen by Adelinde Weiss, wife of the astronomer Edmund Weiss, and refers to Alcestis, a woman in Greek mythology.

A 20 chord stellar occultation by Alkeste was observed when the asteroid passed in front of the third magnitude star Beta Virginis on June 24, 2003. The event was visible from Australia and New Zealand.

The asteroid has been observed in 3 more stellar occultation events.

Photometric observations of this asteroid in 2016 produced lightcurves indicating a rotation period of 9.9 hours with an amplitude variation of 0.18 in magnitude. This result matched previous determinations of the spin rate. The lightcurve was found to vary over the observation period as the viewing angle changed, suggesting the shadowing of topographic features.

<text>Intelligent control is a class of control techniques that use various artificial intelligence computing approaches like neural networks, Bayesian probability, fuzzy logic, machine learning, reinforcement learning, evolutionary computation and genetic algorithms.

== Overview ==
Intelligent control can be divided into the following major sub-domains:
* Neural network control
* Machine learning control
* Reinforcement learning
* Bayesian control
* Fuzzy control
* Neuro-fuzzy control
* Expert Systems
* Genetic control

New control techniques are created continuously as new models of intelligent behavior are created and computational methods developed to support them.

=== Neural network controller ===
Neural networks have been used to solve problems in almost all spheres of science and technology. Neural network control basically involves two steps:

* System identification
* Control

It has been shown that a feedforward network with nonlinear, continuous and differentiable activation functions have universal approximation capability. Recurrent networks have also been used for system identification. Given, a set of input-output data pairs, system identification aims to form a mapping among these data pairs. Such a network is supposed to capture the dynamics of a system. For the control part, deep reinforcement learning has shown its ability to control complex systems.

=== Bayesian controllers ===
Bayesian probability has produced a number of algorithms that are in common use in many advanced control systems, serving as state space estimators of some variables that are used in the controller.

The Kalman filter and the Particle filter are two examples of popular Bayesian control components. The Bayesian approach to controller design often requires an important effort in deriving the so-called system model and measurement model, which are the mathematical relationships linking the state variables to the sensor measurements available in the controlled system. In this respect, it is very closely linked to the
system-theoretic approach to control design.

<doc id="741107" wikidata="Q1413495" url="?curid=741107" title="Ozias Humphry">
<text>Ozias Humphry (or Humphrey) (8 September 1742 – 9 March 1810) was a leading English painter of portrait miniatures, later oils and pastels, of the 18th century. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1791, and in 1792 he was appointed &quot;Portrait Painter in Crayons to the King&quot; (i.e. pastels).

==Name==
&quot;Humphry&quot; is the spelling Ozias himself used in his signature on the backing card of his miniature of &quot;Charlotte, Princess Royal&quot; (1769; Windsor Castle). This is also the spelling given in the catalogues of the annual exhibitions of the Royal Academy from 1779 to 1795. 
The different spelling in the far more common form of &quot;Humphrey&quot; may originally well be due to a mistake but was already in use during his own lifetime. It appears thus in the Royal Academy catalogues for the years 1796 and 1797 as well as in the writings of Horace Walpole and John Thomas Smith. Humphry is the generally used spelling today.

==Education==
Born and schooled in Honiton, Devon, Humphry was attracted by the gallery of casts opened by the Duke of Richmond and came to London to study art at Shipley&#x27;s school. He also studied art in Bath (under Samuel Collins, taking over his practice in 1762); in Bath, he lodged with Thomas Linley. As a young artist, he found his talent encouraged by Thomas Gainsborough and Sir Joshua Reynolds, among others. His problems with his sight, which ultimately led to blindness, began in the early 1770s and forced him to paint larger works in oils and pastel.
==Italy==
He traveled to Italy in 1773 with his great friend George Romney, stopping en route at Knole, near Sevenoaks in Kent, where the Duke of Dorset commissioned several works from him. His stay in Italy lasted until 1777.

On his return, his numerous subjects included George Stubbs (1777), fellow academician Dominic Serres, the chemist Joseph Priestley, and allegedly a portrait claimed to be of the teenage Jane Austen, from perhaps as early as 1790 (clothing styles suggest a later date), known as the &quot;Rice&quot; portrait after a later owner, though this has always been a controversial attribution of the sitter. This failed to reach its minimum estimate in a Christie&#x27;s auction in April 2007, and was withdrawn from sale. His pupils included John Opie. He compiled a fifty-page manuscript &quot;A Memoir of George Stubbs&quot;, based on what Stubbs had related to him; it is the only contemporary biography. This was edited and privately published in the 1870s and republished in 2005. He also knew William Blake and commissioned copies of some of his illustrated books. At least one of Blake&#x27;s letters to him is a significant document for Blake&#x27;s biographers.

==India==

From 1785 to 1787, he travelled to India, producing many miniatures and sketches. He was elected a member of the Royal Academy in 1791. In 1792 he was appointed &quot;Portrait Painter in Crayons to the King&quot;. Most of his many portraits of the Royal Family are still in the Royal Collection.

His sight finally failed in 1797, and he died in 1810 in Hampstead, north London.

The bulk of his possessions came into the hands of his natural son, William Upcott, the book collector. From him the British Museum acquired a large number of papers relating to Humphry. He is alluded to in some lines by Hayley.

<text>Dalton (named after John Dalton) is an ab initio quantum chemistry computer program suite, consisting of the Dalton and LSDalton programs. The Dalton suite is capable of calculating various molecular properties using the Hartree–Fock, MP2, MCSCF and coupled cluster theories. Version 2.0 of DALTON added support for density functional theory calculations. There are many authors, including Trygve Helgaker, Poul Jørgensen and Kenneth Ruud.

Dalton switched to the open source GNU LGPL licence in August 2017.

<doc id="741119" wikidata="Q7868521" url="?curid=741119" title="USS Conger">
<text>USS &quot;Conger&quot; (SS/AGSS-477), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the conger, an eel found in warm seas at moderate depths, common to both coasts of the Atlantic Ocean.

==Construction and design==
Her keel was laid down on 11 July 1944 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. She was launched on 17 October 1944 sponsored by Mrs. W. C. Ploeser, and commissioned on 14 February 1945.

==Service history==
&quot;Conger&quot; tested new submarine equipment at New London, Connecticut, until she cleared 21 July 1945 for Pacific service. At sea between Balboa, Panama, and Pearl Harbor upon the end of hostilities, she was ordered back to the Panama Canal Zone, and on 4 September arrived at Key West, Florida, to provide services to the Fleet Sonar School until 6 December. She sailed then for New London and Tompkinsville, New York, where she lay until sailing 10 January 1946 for her assigned home port at Cristobal, Canal Zone. 
&quot;Conger&quot; operated in the Caribbean Sea, calling at Memphis, Tennessee, and Vicksburg, Mississippi, in May 1947, until 23 August, when she sailed for a complete circuit of the South American continent on special hydrographic work, passing through the Straits of Magellan. She returned to the Canal Zone 5 October to resume her Caribbean operations, and on 11 January 1948, she made her base at Key West, Florida. On 3 June 1949 her home port became Norfolk, Virginia, and she operated along the East Coast and in the Caribbean assisting in the training of surface ships, taking part in fleet exercises, and perfecting her own readiness for action. She was again transferred in 1952, arriving at New London, Connecticut, her new home port, 12 December. From that time through 1960, she continued her East Coast operations, and frequently went to sea with student submariners on board.

&quot;Conger&quot; was fitted with Bottom Reflection Active Sonar System II (BRASS II) sonar equipment in 1961. BRASS II led to the sonar sphere used on the &quot;Thresher&quot; class and all subsequent US attack submarines. &quot;Conger&quot; was reclassified as an auxiliary submarine and given the hull classification symbol AGSS-477 in 1962. She was decommissioned on 29 July 1963, struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 August 1963, and sold for scrapping in May 1964. Her name plate is on display at Freedom Park.

<doc id="741123" wikidata="Q137321" url="?curid=741123" title="125 Liberatrix">
<text>125 Liberatrix is a main-belt asteroid. It has a relatively reflective surface and an M-type spectrum. Liberatrix is a member of an asteroid family bearing its own name.

It was discovered by Prosper Henry on 11 September 1872, from Paris. Some sources give Paul Henry sole credit for its discovery. The asteroid&#x27;s name is a feminine version of the word &quot;liberator&quot;. Henry may have chosen the name to mark the liberation of France from Prussia during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. More specifically, it may honor Adolphe Thiers, the first President of the French Republic, who arranged a loan that enabled the Prussian troops to be removed from France.

In the late 1990s, a network of astronomers worldwide gathered lightcurve data to derive the spin states and shape models of 10 asteroids, including Liberatrix. Liberatrix&#x27;s lightcurve has a large amplitude of 0.4 in magnitude, indicating an elongated or irregular shape.

The spectrum of this asteroid matches a M-type asteroid. It may be the remnant of an asteroid that had undergone differentiation, with orthopyroxene minerals scattered evenly across the surface. There is no indication of hydration.

To date, there have been at least two observed occultations by Liberatrix. Early on 11 December 2014, Liberatrix occulted a 9th magnitude star and will be visible over the majority of Southern California and a swath of Mexico.

<text>Yefim Alekseyevich Cherepanov (; 1774 – 1842), and his son Miron Yefimovich Cherepanov (; 1803 – 1849) were Russian inventors and industrial engineers. They were serfs of the Demidovs – a famous family of factory owners.

In 1810s Yefim built a progressive machine-building plant, equipped with a full range of innovative metal-cutting lathes (such as screw-cutters, gear-cutting serrating machines and others). From 1822 until his death, Yefim was chief mechanic for all the factories in the town of Nizhny Tagil. Miron was his apprentice and in 1819 was appointed his deputy. Miron became chief mechanic after his father&#x27;s death.

==Innovations==

===Industrial machinery===
The Cherepanovs significantly improved the machinery that had been used in blast-furnace and gold-mining industries, iron and copper works, sawmills, and flourmills.

===Steam engines===
The most interesting aspect of the Cherepanovs&#x27; work were steam engines which they tried to introduce into industrial production. From 1820, the Cherepanovs built about 20 steam engines that ranged from 2 to 60 hp.

===Railroad===

In 1833-34 they built the first Russian steam locomotive. They also built a cast-iron railroad from one of their factories to a copper mine. Track gauge was 5 ft 6 in (1670 mm). In 1835, they built a second locomotive that they sent to Saint Petersburg. Despite the successful performance and operation of their locomotives, the Cherepanovs&#x27; invention found no support outside the factory and, subsequently, horse traction replaced their steam locomotives.

<doc id="741127" wikidata="Q810026" url="?curid=741127" title="Basil D'Oliveira">
<text>Basil Lewis D&#x27;Oliveira CBE OIS (4 October 1931 – 19 November 2011) was an England international cricketer of South African Cape Coloured background, whose potential selection by England for the scheduled 1968–69 tour of apartheid-era South Africa caused the D&#x27;Oliveira affair.

Nicknamed &quot;Dolly&quot;, D&#x27;Oliveira played county cricket for Worcestershire from 1964 to 1980, and appeared for England in 44 Test matches and four One Day Internationals between 1966 and 1972.

==Early life==

D&#x27;Oliveira was born into a religious Catholic family in Signal Hill, Cape Town; he believed that his family probably came from Madeira, not Malaya or Indonesia like most of his community and this explained his Portuguese surname. As a boy he visited the Newlands Cricket Ground in Cape Town and climbed the trees outside to watch the games.

He captained South Africa&#x27;s national non-white cricket team, and also played football for the non-white national side.

==Career==

With the support of John Arlott, and the members and supporters of St Augustine&#x27;s Cricket Club in Cape Town, he emigrated to England in 1960, where the journalist John Kay found him a place in the Central Lancashire League team of Middleton. D&#x27;Oliveira noted his surprise at seeing white people doing menial work, and waiting on him in restaurants. He toured Pakistan with a Commonwealth XI in 1963–64, scoring his first century in first-class cricket. He joined the first-class county team Worcestershire County Cricket Club in 1964, and became a British citizen.

In 1966, he was selected for the England cricket team as an all-rounder to face the West Indians in the second Test. He made a solid debut, scoring 27 before being run out, and returning bowling figures of 1 for 24 and 1 for 46 in 39 overs. In the third Test he scored 76 and 54, while capturing 2 wickets for 51 and 2 for 77 at Trent Bridge; though the West Indies cantered to a 139-run victory. He contributed a fighting 88 in the fourth Test at Headingley, although England once again lost, by an innings and 55 runs. D&#x27;Oliveira was quietly efficient in the final Test as England turned the tables on the West Indies, winning by an innings and 34 runs to lose the series 3–1. Against India he hit 109 in the first Test where England won by six wickets and went on to win the series 3–0. Facing Pakistan he hit fifties in both innings of the first Test, in a series that England won 2–0. He was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1967.

In the away series against the West Indies, early in 1968, D&#x27;Oliveira was not at his best in the five matches. He scored only 137 runs at an average of 27.4. He bowled extensively, but picked up only three wickets, even though he was economical. Once back in England, it was time for a five-Test Ashes series. The Aussies crushed England by 159 runs in the first Test as England crumbled in their second innings, despite D&#x27;Oliveira&#x27;s top scoring effort of 87 not out. He was then dropped for the subsequent three Tests. He was recalled for the final Test at the Oval, and 158 runs in the first innings against Australia seemed to have guaranteed his place in the side to play the 1968–69 Test series in South Africa. He was left out of the touring party under the pretext that his bowling would not be effective in his native country. However, he was later called up as a replacement and the tour was cancelled.

He was selected in June 1969 to face the West Indies, this time in a three-Test series. He followed that with a three-match series against New Zealand and then a seven-Test Ashes series in Australia, in which he scored 369 runs at an average of 36.9, including 117 in the fifth Test at the MCG.

England then went to New Zealand for two Tests, with D&#x27;Oliveira scoring 100 in the first one and 58 and five in the second. Pakistan next visited England in 1971, and D&#x27;Oliveira enjoyed a fine series with the bat, making 241 runs at an average of 60.25. He was below par in the three-Test series against India that followed, but was in better form for the visit of Australia in June 1972.

D&#x27;Oliveira completed his playing career having played 41 Tests. He scored 2484 runs at an average of 40.06, with five centuries and 15 fifties. He also captured 47 wickets at 39.55. After his retirement from first-class cricket D’Oliveira was the Worcestershire coach from 1980 to 1990.

==Playing style and personality==

D&#x27;Oliveira was a successful batsman with a low backlift and powerful strokes. He was also a tough competitor. When he toured Australia in 1970–71 on the night after they won the series 2–0 he pushed his forefinger into the chest of every Australian he met, saying &quot;We stuffed you.&quot;

Wanting to play international cricket, D&#x27;Oliveira was somewhat cagey about his date of birth. After his death, journalist Pat Murphy with whom he collaborated on his autobiography stated:
==The D&#x27;Oliveira Affair==

South African cricket officials in 1968 realised that the inclusion of D&#x27;Oliveira in the England squad would lead to the cancellation of the tour, and probable exclusion of South Africa from Test cricket. This exerted pressure on the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) hierarchy leading to the decision not to pick him, which was felt by opponents of apartheid to be a way of keeping cricket links with South Africa open. There was dissent in the press to this course of events and when Warwickshire&#x27;s Tom Cartwright was ruled out because of injury, D&#x27;Oliveira was called up into the squad. Prime Minister of South Africa B. J. Vorster had already made it clear that D&#x27;Oliveira&#x27;s inclusion was not acceptable, and despite many negotiations the tour was cancelled; South Africa was excluded from Test cricket for 22 years. This was seen as a in the sporting boycott of apartheid South Africa.

The D&#x27;Oliveira Affair had a massive impact in turning international opinion against the apartheid regime in South Africa. It prompted changes in South African sport and eventually in society. The events of 1968 were dramatized on BBC Radio 4 in April 2009 in a play by Christopher Douglas entitled &quot;Dolly&quot;.

==Legacy==

In 2000, he was nominated as one of 10 South African cricketers of the century, despite not having played for South Africa. In 2004, a perpetual trophy was struck for the Test series between England and South Africa, and named the Basil D&#x27;Oliveira Trophy. In 2005, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2005 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. In the same year, a stand at New Road, Worcester, was named in his honour.

In 1980, after the end of his playing career, he wrote an autobiography with the BBC&#x27;s Pat Murphy, titled &quot;Time to Declare&quot;. In it, he stated for the first time that he was glad that the proposed South African cricket tour to England in 1970 was called off, for fear of public disturbances. In 2004, journalist Peter Oborne wrote a biography entitled &quot;Basil D&#x27;Oliveira: Cricket and Conspiracy&quot; (), which was awarded the William Hill Sports Book of the Year and was accompanied by Paul Yule&#x27;s RTS award-winning documentary &quot;Not Cricket—The Basil D&#x27;Oliveira Conspiracy.&quot;

He was namechecked in the first episode of the BBC comedy &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; (aired in September 1975) with the character of The Major exclaiming that &quot;D&#x27;Oliveira made a hundred!&quot;.

==Personal life==

He was married to Naomi, and their son Damian D&#x27;Oliveira also played first-class cricket for Worcestershire CCC and joined the coaching staff after his retirement from playing. His grandson, Brett D&#x27;Oliveira, is currently captain of Worcestershire CCC, having made his debut for the county in 2011. There has been a D&#x27;Oliveira on the staff at Worcestershire CCC, as either player or coach, ever since Basil first joined the County in 1964.

==Death==

D&#x27;Oliveira had Parkinson&#x27;s disease in later life. He died aged 80 (or possibly 83) in England, on 19 November 2011.

A farewell for D&#x27;Oliveira was written on the last 2011 issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine by Trevor Manuel, South Africa&#x27;s Minister in the Presidency for National Planning. It highlights the personal successes of the cricket player, together with the impact he had on South African sport and society. A memorial service was held in Worcester Cathedral on 27 January 2012; Sir Michael Parkinson gave one of the eulogies.

In September 2018, he was posthumously awarded the Freedom of the City of Worcester in recognition of his contribution to the city. The award was accepted by his son Shaun at a ceremony in the Guildhall in Worcester on 14 September 2018.

<doc id="741128" wikidata="Q424630" url="?curid=741128" title="Accident (philosophy)">
<text>An accident (Greek ), in metaphysics and philosophy, is a property that the entity or substance has contingently, without which the substance can still retain its identity. An accident does not affect its essence, according to many philosophers. It does not mean an &quot;accident&quot; as used in common speech, a chance incident, normally harmful. Examples of accidents are color, taste, movement, and stagnation. Accident is contrasted with essence: a designation for the property or set of properties that make an entity or substance what it fundamentally is, and which it has by necessity, and without which it loses its identity.

Aristotle made a distinction between the essential and accidental properties of a thing. Thomas Aquinas and other Catholic theologians have employed the Aristotelian concepts of substance and accident in articulating the theology of the Eucharist, particularly the transubstantiation of bread and wine into body and blood.

In modern philosophy, an accident (or accidental property) is the union of two concepts: property and contingency. Non-essentialism argues that every property is an accident. Modal necessitarianism argues that all properties are essential and no property is an accident.

==Aristotle ==

Aristotle made a distinction between the essential and accidental properties of a thing. For example, a chair can be made of wood or metal, but this is accidental to its being a chair: that is, it is still a chair regardless of the material from which it is made. To put this in technical terms, an accident is a property which has no necessary connection to the essence of the thing being described.

To take another example, all bachelors are unmarried: this is the necessary or essential property of what it means to be a bachelor. A particular bachelor may have brown hair, but this would be a property particular to that individual, and with respect to his bachelorhood it would be an accidental property. And this distinction is independent of experimental verification: even if for some reason all the unmarried men with non-brown hair were killed, and every single existent bachelor had brown hair, the property of having brown hair would still be accidental since it would still be logically possible for a bachelor to have hair of another color.

The nine kinds of accidents, according to Aristotle, are quantity, quality, relation, habitus, time, location, situation (or position), action, and passion (&quot;being acted on&quot;). Together with &quot;substance&quot;, these nine kinds of accidents constitute the ten fundamental categories of Aristotle&#x27;s ontology.

==Theological application==
Catholic theologians such as Thomas Aquinas have employed the Aristotelian concepts of substance and accident in articulating the theology of the Eucharist, particularly the transubstantiation of bread and wine into body and blood. According to this tradition, the accidents (or &quot;species&quot;) of the appearance of bread and wine do not change, but the substance changes from bread and wine to the Body and Blood of Christ.

== Modern philosophy ==

In modern philosophy, an accident (or accidental property) is the union of two concepts: property and contingency. In relation to the first, an accidental property (Greek &quot;symbebekos&quot;) is at its most basic level a &quot;property&quot;. The color &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;high value&quot;, &quot;Atomic Number 79&quot; are all properties, and are therefore candidates for being accidental. On the other hand, &quot;gold&quot;, &quot;platinum&quot;, and &quot;electrum&quot; are not properties, and are therefore not classified as accidents.

There are two opposed philosophical positions that also impact the meaning of this term:
*Anti-essentialism (associated with Willard Van Orman Quine) argues that there are no essential properties at all, and therefore every property is an accident.
*Modal necessitarianism (associated with Saul Kripke), argues for the veracity of the modal system &quot;Triv&quot; (If P is true, then P must be true). The consequence of this theory is that all properties are essential (and no property is an accident).

<doc id="741134" wikidata="Q311244" url="?curid=741134" title="Young Buck">
<text>David Darnell Brown (born March 15, 1981), better known by his stage name Young Buck, is an American rapper. He signed with Birdman&#x27;s Cash Money Records in 1997, formed the hip hop collective UTP with Juvenile and Soulja Slim in 2000, and joined 50 Cent&#x27;s group, G-Unit by 2003. He signed with the latter&#x27;s parent label, G-Unit Records, an imprint of Interscope Records to release his debut studio album &quot;Straight Outta Cashville&quot; (2004) and its follow-up &quot;Buck the World&quot; (2007), both of which peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and were met with critical praise.

Initially launched in 2005 as &quot;G-Unit South&quot;, Brown&#x27;s record label, Cashville Records, has released his subsequent projects following personal disputes with 50 Cent and his 2010 departure from G-Unit Records. Cashville has also signed hip hop acts including The Outlawz and C-Bo.

==Early life==
Brown was born in Nashville, Tennessee and grew up in North Nashville. Around the age of 12, he began rapping. A few years later, he performed for Brian &quot;Baby&quot; Williams, co-founder of Cash Money.

==Career==
Young Buck joined Cash Money in 1997 but left for Juvenile&#x27;s UTP in 2000. He released two albums with UTP, &quot;Born to Be a Thug&quot; and &quot;The Compilation&quot;, before leaving the label in 2003 to join 50 Cent&#x27;s record label G-Unit.

His first recording with G-Unit Records was on the 2002 recorded song &quot;Blood Hound&quot; for 50 Cent&#x27;s February 2003 debut studio album Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;. That same year, Young Buck became a member of G-Unit. He also appeared heavily on rap group G-Unit&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Beg for Mercy&quot;. He replaced G-Unit member Tony Yayo who had been jailed on gun possession charges after recording only two songs for the album.

His G-Unit Records debut album &quot;Straight Outta Cashville&quot; was released on August 24, 2004. The album&#x27;s title alludes to the N.W.A album &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; and is a neologism for Nashville (his hometown). The album produced three singles: &quot;Let Me In&quot;, &quot;Shorty Wanna Ride&quot;, and &quot;Look at Me Now&quot;. The album received little promotion after November. Young Buck was arrested for assault after the VIBE award incident and wasn&#x27;t able to promote the album for four months until the case was dropped. The album debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has since been certified Platinum by the RIAA. His second solo album &quot;Buck The World&quot; followed in 2007.

He joined the rest of the label&#x27;s roster on the 2005 collaboration album &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot;.

In April 2008 he was expelled from the rap group G Unit, remaining with G Unit Records as a solo artist. 50 Cent faulted him for making provocative public statements he would later retract in private, for missing recording sessions, and for drug abuse. Young Buck released a &quot;diss&quot; track insulting 50 Cent and G Unit, 50 Cent responded by releasing a taped phone call in which an emotional Buck was heard crying and asking 50 Cent for help and advice, Buck replied with another &quot;diss&quot; track.

In October he wished to leave G Unit Records but still owed the label two albums and his third album &quot;The Rehab&quot; was still unreleased. In 2009 he said he still owed one album, &quot;The Rehab&quot; was released independently in 2010.

In December 2011 he was still under contract to G-Unit Records and about to lose his assets including his stage name in bankruptcy court, having been unable to record since 2008. He claimed he was close to signing with Cash Money; The Tennessean confirmed a proposed deal that would release him from his G-Unit contract and leave him signed to Cash Money. Cash Money Records CEO Birdman though denied that any deal was in the works.

In August 2012, Buck stated in an interview with XXL he was no longer signed to G-Unit Records and he would be a free agent when he is released from prison.

On June 1, 2014, Young Buck was seen at the Summer Jam Concert with 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, and Tony Yayo. It was confirmed later that the group had reformed, adding Kidd Kidd as a new member. The group released their debut EP &quot;The Beauty of Independence&quot; on August 25, 2014. Young Buck is again making new music with G-Unit and released his mixtape &quot;Before The Beast&quot; which contains seven songs featuring Kidd Kidd, Lil Boosie, Tony Yayo, Lloyd Banks and additional artists. After releasing the mixtape, he released G-unit&#x27;s second EP &quot;The Beast Is G-Unit,&quot; which sold approximately 20,000 copies in its first week.

==Personal life==
===Shooting===
In 2000, Young Buck was shot multiple times during a home invasion at his home in Nashville. The assailants were in search of narcotics. Buck required a blood transfusion at Vanderbilt hospital as a result of the life-threatening injuries.

===Financial problems===
Brown filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in August, 2010 shortly after an IRS raid on his home. His bankruptcy lawyer later told &quot;The City Paper&quot; that he was planning to sue Curtis Jackson (50 Cent) and other parties over the record contract dispute.

The IRS made plans to auction off Young Buck&#x27;s seized property on October 28, 2010, but his legal counsel filed suit to halt the sale, while simultaneously re-filing a revised bankruptcy petition that no longer referenced a $5 million legal claim against 50 Cent and other parties associated with G Unit.

In the lawsuit, Young Buck said the studio equipment taken in the raid was &quot;directly tied to&quot; his &quot;ability to generate income in order to reorganize the estate.&quot; He stated that the seizure of property that belonged to his children had &quot;created great stress in the home&quot; and &quot;within the common law marriage of the debtor plaintiff.&quot; He told the court he needed to get back the property belonging to the family.

Young Buck&#x27;s attorney was able to convince the court that he would be selling real estate worth $638,500 to begin paying the back taxes due. At a hearing on October 26, 2010, plans for the IRS auction were at least temporarily stopped. Young Buck announced the outcome with a tweet.

Young Buck was under Chapter 7, Young Buck&#x27;s assets were to be sold and distributed among his creditors.

On July 25 and 26, a public auction was held at the estate that Young Buck owns. Property to be sold includes watches, a 50 Cent plaque, artwork, a soda machine, his studio equipment, and more.

===Drive-by shooting===
Early Sunday morning on March 4, 2012, Young Buck was targeted in a drive-by shooting. According to Nashville police, via WSMV-TV Channel 4, at approximately 3:30 am, a white Chevrolet Tahoe crept past the rapper&#x27;s SUV and opened fire, hitting the vehicle 11 times, including a female passenger. Buck, who was back in his hometown to work on new music, was not injured.

After a couple of days of silence, Buck took to his Twitter to address the situation. &quot;We all go through things in life&quot;, he tweeted. &quot;The things I&#x27;m experiencing are Truly making me a Better and Stronger man. #GodisGood.&quot;

===Legal issues===
After an IRS raid on Buck&#x27;s Nashville home in 2010, authorities found a .40 caliber Glock 22 as well as ammunition. The raid followed reports that the rapper had an outstanding $300,000 tax debt, and because he&#x27;s a convicted felon, Buck is prohibited from possessing any firearms. Back in 2005, he pleaded no contest to assault with a chance to produce bodily injury after he stabbed a man while trying to defend Dr. Dre at the 2004 Vibe Awards.

On July 13, 2012, Buck was sentenced to 18 months in prison on weapon charges, a sentence that he began on August 6, 2012. Until then, Buck had remained at his Nashville home on house arrest with a monitoring bracelet strapped around his ankle. He served his 18 months in Yazoo City Low Security Federal Prison in Southern Mississippi and was released on October 1, 2013.

On July 20, 2016, he sent a threatening text to his ex-girlfriend and showed up and kicked down her door. Buck was arrested on July 21, 2016, for threatening to burn down the ex-girlfriend&#x27;s apartment. He was released on a $5,000 bond.

==Controversy==

===VIBE Awards stabbing===
On November 15, 2004, Jimmy James Johnson approached Dr. Dre at the VIBE Awards and reportedly asked for an autograph before Dr. Dre was about to go on stage. After Dr. Dre declined, Johnson punched him on the back of the head before running towards the nearest exit. A brawl ensued with several uniformed police officers attempting to break up the fight. Chairs were thrown, and it was alleged that Young Buck stabbed Johnson in the chest with a knife. After video evidence was uncovered from the awards ceremony, the Santa Monica Police Department issued an arrest warrant for him. In a preliminary hearing, it was ruled that there was enough evidence to proceed with a jury trial. However, in December 2005, a deal was reportedly struck that would see Young Buck avoid trial.

===The Game===
After The Game was kicked out of G-Unit allegedly for being disloyal, Young Buck as well as new West Coast G-Unit rapper Spider Loc who had signed to G-Unit Records in September 2004, called him to task for dissing the group and label. The Game then released a track entitled &quot;300 Bars&quot; which insulted both Spider Loc and Young Buck. Young Buck then released a track called &quot;The Real Bitch Boy&quot;, which featured Spider Loc and used a beat from The Game&#x27;s track, &quot;Where I&#x27;m From&quot;. In the song, Young Buck talks about how he did not even know The Game when he mentions The Game&#x27;s name on &quot;Poppin&#x27; Them Thangs&quot;. Also, Young Buck talks about The Game being a male stripper and also how 50 Cent helped The Game to be successful with his album &quot;The Documentary&quot;.

The feud has continued to escalate, with there being an exchange of many tracks. In February 2007, The Game and Young Buck got into a non-physical altercation at a club, during the NBA All-Star Weekend in Las Vegas. The last time that they were seen together was when The Game was part of G-Unit.

After being dismissed from G-Unit, Young Buck appeared on a remix to The Game&#x27;s song &quot;Game&#x27;s Pain&quot;, as well as appearing in the music video to the song &quot;My Life&quot;, which featured another former rival, Lil Wayne. A mixtape by The Game and Young Buck was also confirmed, called &quot;Worth More Than 50 Cents&quot;.

==Albums==

===&quot;Straight Outta Cashville&quot;===
After being with G-Unit for a little over a year, Young Buck released his debut album, &quot;Straight Outta Cashville&quot;, a portmanteau reflecting the name of Young Buck&#x27;s home city, Nashville, Tennessee.

&quot;Straight Outta Cashville&quot; has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America with over 2 million sales in the U.S. and 3.3 million Worldwide.

===&quot;Buck the World&quot;===
Young Buck&#x27;s second album, &quot;Buck the World&quot; was released worldwide on March 27, 2007.

&quot;Buck the World&quot; debuted at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 1 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart with sales of 141,083 in the first week.

===&quot;The Rehab&quot;===
&quot;The Rehab&quot; was released on September 7, 2010. It was Buck&#x27;s third studio album, released independently by Real Talk Entertainment. Buck had made an earlier claim in which he said that &quot;The Rehab&quot; would sell a million copies in his first week, though he was still signed to G-Unit/Interscope Records at that time.

<text>Wilbur Lucius Cross (April 10, 1862 – October 5, 1948) was an American literary critic who served as the 71st governor of Connecticut from 1931 to 1939.

==Biography==
Born in 1862 in Mansfield, Cross attended Natchaug School in Willimantic. He graduated from Yale College with a B.A. in 1885 and served as principal of Staples High School in Westport for a short time before returning to Yale as a graduate student, earning a PhD in English literature in 1889. Cross spent several years as a high school principal and schoolteacher at Staples High School in Westport before being offered a job as a professor of English at Yale in 1894. Over the next 36 years, he taught at Yale, became editor of the Yale Review, Sterling Professor of English in 1922, and Dean of the Yale Graduate School from 1916 to 1930. On July 17, 1889, he was married to Helen Baldwin Avery, and they had four children; Wilbur Lucius Cross, Jr., Avery Cross, Elizabeth Cross, and Arthur Cross.

Cross became a well-known literary critic. Along with C. F. Tucker Brooke, Cross was the editor of the Yale Shakespeare; he also edited the &quot;Yale Review&quot; for almost 30 years. He wrote several books, including &quot;Life and Times of Laurence Sterne&quot; (1909) and &quot;The History of Henry Fielding&quot; (1918), and several books on the English novel.

After retiring from Yale, Cross was elected governor of Connecticut as a Democrat in 1930 and served as Governor for four two-year terms, from January 7, 1931, to January 4, 1939. He was a Delegate to the Democratic National Convention from Connecticut in 1936. He was defeated in 1938 in his attempt to gain re-election for a fifth term. He is credited with passage of several items of reform legislation during his tenure of governor, which included measures related to the abolition of child labor, and instituted a minimum wage rate. Also there was legislation that authorized governmental reorganization, and improved factory laws. He also endorsed legislation that authorized funding for the rebuilding of the Connecticut State College, which included the construction of the first campus library, named the Cross Library.

During his tenure, eugenicist Harry H. Laughlin served on a commission proposing radical eugenic policies; these policies were never implemented.

Cross was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1934.

After retiring from public service, he continued to stay active in his writing and research projects.

==Death and legacy==
Cross died on October 5, 1948, in New Haven at the age of 86. He is interred at Evergreen Cemetery.

Wilbur Cross High School in New Haven, Wilbur Cross School in Bridgeport, and Connecticut&#x27;s Wilbur Cross Parkway and Wilbur Cross Highway were named in his honor, as was Yale&#x27;s Wilbur L. Cross Medal, awarded for outstanding achievement in professional life. The first campus library at the University of Connecticut (then Connecticut State College), built with bond revenues authorized during Cross&#x27;s governorship and opened in 1939, was named for Cross in 1942.

Wilbur Cross&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Connecticut Yankee&quot;, was published in 1943.

<doc id="741144" wikidata="Q7855965" url="?curid=741144" title="Turner Tomorrow Fellowship Award">
<text>The Turner Tomorrow Fellowship Award was created in 1989 by Ted Turner, to be awarded to an unpublished work of fiction offering creative and positive solutions to global problems. &quot;Ishmael&quot; by Daniel Quinn won the award in 1991, which will not be awarded again, and was selected out of 2500 entries by a celebrity panel including famous sci-fi writer Ray Bradbury. The award was worth $500,000, the largest single sum ever awarded to a single work of literature.

Turner created the prize in hopes of combining literary merit with potential solutions to near-term environmental concerns. While unveiling the award he said, &quot;The great minds of today need to focus on the problems of global significance if humanity is to see new tomorrows&quot; adding, &quot;These awards are designed to encourage writing by authors throughout the world and in all languages that creates positive solutions to global problems.&quot;

In addition to a $500,000 award, the fellowship included a hardcover publishing contract with Turner Broadcasting&#x27;s publishing unit and $50,000 to market the book and a film option. Three awards of merit were also presented, which included $50,000, a publishing contract and film option, to Sara Cameron for her novel &quot;Natural Enemies&quot;, Janet Keller for &quot;Necessary Risks&quot; and Andy Goldblatt for &quot;The Bully Pulpit.&quot;

In addition to Ray Bradbury, the judges included: Nobel Laureate for Literature Nadine Gordimer, novelists Wallace Stegner, Peter Matthiessen, William Styron and Rodney Hall as well as Betty and Ian Ballantine, founders of Ballantine Books. Thomas H. Guinzburg, former president of Viking Press and one of the founders of the &quot;Paris Review&quot;, was the managing director.

== Controversy ==
Some of the judges, including novelists William Styron, Peter Matthiessen and Wallace Stegner, felt while &quot;Ishmael&quot; was the best of the 12 manuscripts, &quot;we didn&#x27;t feel it was worth anything remotely like $500,000.&quot; They felt that Michael Reagan, of Turner Publishing, had handled their grievances dishonestly. Ray Bradbury disagreed with his fellow judges: &quot;This is a fine piece of work... If Kitty Kelley can make $5-million-to-$6 million, why not half-a-million for a real book?&quot; $10,000 was paid to each of the nine judges.

<text>William Crotch (5 July 177529 December 1847) was an English composer and organist. According to the British musicologist Nicholas Temperley, Crotch was &quot;a child prodigy without parallel in the history of music&quot;, and was certainly the most distinguished English musician in his day.

==Life==
===Childhood===

William Crotch was born in Norwich, Norfolk, to a master carpenter. Like Mozart, he was a child prodigy, playing the organ his father had built. At the age of two he became a local celebrity by performing for visitors, among them the musician Charles Burney, who wrote an account of his visits for the Royal Society. The three-year-old Crotch was taken to London by his ambitious mother, where he not only played on the organ of the Chapel Royal in St James&#x27;s Palace, but performed for King George III. &quot;The London Magazine&quot; of April 1779 recorded:
He appears to be fondest of solemn tunes and church musick, particularly the 104th Psalm. As soon as he has finished a regular tune, or part of a tune, or played some little fancy notes of his own, he stops, and has some of the pranks of a wanton boy; some of the company then generally give him a cake, an apple, or an orange, to induce him to play again...

Crotch was later to observe that this experience led him to become a rather spoiled child, excessively indulged so that he would perform.

===Adult life===
Crotch was for a time organist at Christ Church, Oxford, from which he was later to graduate with a Bachelor of Music degree. His first attempt at an oratorio, &quot;The Captivity of Judah&quot;, was played at Trinity Hall, Cambridge on 4 June 1789 when he was 14. His most successful—and largest scale—composition was the oratorio &quot;Palestine&quot; (1812), after which he mainly returned to smaller scale works. He may have composed the &quot;Westminster Chimes&quot; in 1793, which are played by Big Ben each time it strikes the hour.

In 1797, Crotch became Heather Professor of Music at Oxford University, and in 1799 he acquired a doctorate in music. While at Oxford, he became acquainted with the musician and artist John Malchair, and took up sketching. He followed Malchair&#x27;s style in recording the exact time and date of each of his pictures, and when he met the artist John Constable in London in 1805, he passed the habit along to the more famous artist.

In 1822 he was appointed to the Royal Academy of Music as its first principal, but resigned ten years later. Among his notable pupils were William Sterndale Bennett, Lucy Anderson, Stephen Codman, George Job Elvey, Cipriani Potter, and Charles Kensington Salaman. In 1834, to commemorate the installation of the Duke of Wellington as chancellor of the University of Oxford. Crotch composed his oratorio &quot;The Captivity of Judah&quot;. This 1834 work bears little resemblance to the oratorio of the same title he wrote as a child, in 1789. It was set to the same text as the earlier version, but is otherwise completely different. It received two complete performances during the composer&#x27;s lifetime and was never published. 

Crotch spent his last years at his son&#x27;s house in Taunton, Somerset, where he died in 1847. He was buried in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul in Bishop&#x27;s Hull, just outside Taunton.

Two grandsons of William Crotch became eminent entomologists: George Robert Crotch and his brother William Duppa Crotch.

==Selected compositions==
* &quot;Captivity of Judah&quot; (1789), oratorio. 
* Three piano sonatas, published on subscription in 1793. 
* Overture in A (1795), the first of three orchestral &quot;sinfonias&quot;. No 2 in Eb was composed in 1808 and revised in 1817; No 3 in F was composed in 1814-15. 
* &quot;Ten Anthems&quot; (1798, revised 1804). Among them are &#x27;Sing we merrily&#x27;, &#x27;How Dear are Thy Counsels&#x27;, &#x27;Oh Lord God of hosts&#x27;, and &#x27;Be merciful unto me&#x27;.
* &quot;Ode to Fancy&quot; (1799, text Joseph Wharton), for two four-part choruses, three soloists and small orchestra, written as an exercise for his Mus.Doc degree.
* Three organ concertos (circa 1804), played often in concerts during Crotch&#x27;s time in Oxford. In a similar style to near-contemporary organ concertos by Charles Wesley, Samuel Wesley and William Felton, all influenced by Handel.
* &quot;12 Fugues, the subjects taken from chants&quot; (1835-7) for organ or piano (this instruction presumably written in an effort to increase sales)
* &quot;Palestine&quot;, oratorio (1812), text Reginald Heber. First performed at the Hanover Square Rooms on 21 April 1812 and repeated due to popular demand on 26 May. Two and a half hours of music, by far his most popular work, and typically judged his best. The Epiphany anthem &#x27;Lo! star-led chiefs&#x27; still receives independent performances and recordings today.
* Symphony in F major (1814)
* Symphony in Eb (1817, unfinished)
* &quot;Ode on the King&#x27;s Accession&quot; (1820) for chorus and orchestra. George IV became king in January 1820. First performed in Oxford, 1821. 
* &quot;The Joy of our Heart is Ceased&quot; (1827), choral anthem, written on the death of the Duke of York. 
* &quot;Captivity of Judah&quot; (1834), oratorio. 
* &quot;The Lord is King&quot; (1838), choral anthem, his last large-scale work, first performed in 1843.

<text>Russel Crouse (20 February 1893 – 3 April 1966) was an American playwright and librettist, best known for his work in the Broadway writing partnership of Lindsay and Crouse.

==Life and career==
Born in Findlay, Ohio, Crouse was the son of Sarah (née Schumacher) and Hiram Powers Crouse, a newspaperman. He began his Broadway career in 1928 as an actor in the play &quot;Gentlemen of the Press&quot;, in which he played Bellflower. By 1931, however, he had turned his attention to writing, penning the book for the musical &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here,&quot; collaborating with Frank McCoy, Morrie Ryskind and Oscar Hammerstein II.

His first work with his long-time partner Howard Lindsay came in 1934, when the two men revised the P. G. Wodehouse/Guy Bolton book for the Cole Porter musical &quot;Anything Goes.&quot; They then went on to adapt Clarence Day&#x27;s &quot;Life with Father&quot;, which became one of the longest running Broadway plays.

Lindsay and Crouse later became Broadway producers, often acting in that capacity for their own work. They also owned and operated the Hudson Theatre on 44th Street in New York City.

Perhaps their best-known collaboration was on the book for the 1960 Tony Award-winning musical &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; which featured music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Crouse&#x27;s old collaborator Oscar Hammerstein II. Their 1946 play &quot;State of the Union&quot; won that year&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize for Drama. They also collaborated on &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;, &quot;Happy Hunting&quot;, &quot;Mr. President&quot;, and &quot;The Great Sebastians&quot; (1955). Crouse joined The Lambs social club in 1941 and remained a member until his death.

Crouse is the father of writer Timothy Crouse, and named his actress daughter Lindsay Ann Crouse in an intentional tribute to his collaboration with Howard Lindsay.

<text>127 Johanna is a large, dark main-belt asteroid that was discovered by French astronomers Paul Henry and Prosper Henry on 5 November 1872, and is believed to be named after Joan of Arc. It is classified as a CX-type asteroid, indicating the spectrum shows properties of both a carbonaceous C-type asteroid and a metallic X-type asteroid.

A photoelectric study was performed of this minor planet in 1991 at the Konkoly Observatory in Hungary. The resulting light curve showed a synodic rotation period of 6.94 ± 0.29 hours with a brightness variation of 0.2 in magnitude. It was estimated to have an absolute magnitude of 8.459 ± 0.013 with a diameter of and an albedo of 0.06–0.04.

Infrared observations made in 1982 at Konkoly showed a rapid variation that seemed to suggest a shorter rotation period of 1.5 hours; one of the fastest known at the time. However, an irregular shape was suggested as an alternative cause of the rapid variation. The present day established rotation period of this object is 12.7988 hours.

During 2001, 127 Johanna was observed by radar from the Arecibo Observatory. The return signal matched an effective diameter of 117 ± 21 km. A larger diameter value of 123.41 ± 4.07 km was obtained from the Midcourse Space Experiment observations, with an albedo of 0.0557 ± 0.0039. A 2012 study gave a refined diameter estimate of 116.14 ± 3.93 km.

<doc id="741153" wikidata="Q7572206" url="?curid=741153" title="SpaceShipOne flight 15P">
<text>Flight 15P of SpaceShipOne (X0) was the first privately funded human spaceflight. It took place on June 21, 2004. It was the fourth powered test flight of the Tier One program, with the previous three test flights reaching much lower altitudes. The flight carried only its pilot, Mike Melvill, who thus became the first non-governmental astronaut.

This flight was a full-altitude test, but not itself a competitive flight for the Ansari X Prize, the prize for the first non-governmental reusable crewed spacecraft. Problems were encountered during the flight but later corrected, paving the way for SpaceShipOne to make competitive flights later in 2004.

==Crew==
==Flight profile==
All times are in PDT, which is seven hours behind UTC. This was the local civil time at the spaceport on the day of the flight. All measurements are first stated in the U.S. customary units in which they were originally reported, with conversions to SI units also given.

Taxiing for takeoff from Mojave Spaceport was originally planned for 06:30, because the wind conditions in that area are most favorable in the early morning. Taxiing actually started at 06:37, and the flight took off at 06:47. After an ascent to 47,000 feet (14.3 km) coupled with the White Knight airplane, the SpaceShipOne craft separated at 07:50 and immediately ignited its rocket.


Shortly after ignition, at about 60,000 feet (18 km), the craft unexpectedly rolled 90 degrees to the left, due to wind shear. When the pilot attempted to correct it, it rolled 90 degrees to the right. The pilot leveled the craft out and proceeded with the climb. The correction of the roll excursion, using full trim, caused a pitch trim tab to run up against a stop. This caused the trim actuator, as designed, to stop operating for a 3 s timeout. Not realizing what had happened, the pilot and controllers interpreted this as a failure of the trim actuator, and they switched to a backup system. Spacecraft attitude was problematic during the entire climb, and not corrected until the start of re-entry.

During the burn, a new aerodynamic fairing installed around the rocket nozzle overheated, became too soft, and crumpled inwards. This caused a loud bang, which the pilot reported, but did not cause a flight problem.

The rocket burn lasted for 76 seconds. At burn-out the altitude was 180,000 feet (54.9 km), the Mach number was 2.9, and the speed was 2150 mph (3460 km/h; 961 m/s).

The planned apogee altitude was 360,000 feet (110  km), but due to the attitude problem encountered during the climb, the craft actually attained only 328,491 feet (100,124 m). In doing so, it passed the boundary to space at 100 km, making the flight, as planned, officially a spaceflight. It can be calculated that the altitude exceeded 100 km for approximately 10.23 s.

Around apogee the craft experienced about 3 minutes of weightlessness. Pilot Mike Melvill opened a bag of M&amp;M&#x27;s and watched them float around the capsule in free fall.

The craft re-entered the atmosphere 22 miles (35 km) south of its planned 5 by 5-mile (8 by 8 km) re-entry zone. The pilot finally corrected the spacecraft&#x27;s attitude at this point, using a backup trim system. The craft reached Mach 2.9 and experienced deceleration of 5.0 &quot;&#x27;g&quot; (49 m/s²) during descent. The craft switched to gliding configuration at an altitude of 57,000 feet (17.4 km), then returned to the spaceport and landed safely at 08:14.

==Spectacle==
Scaled Composites, the makers of SpaceShipOne, announced the planned spaceflight on June 2, 2004, and invited the public to watch. An estimated 11,000 people went to Mojave Spaceport to watch the flight, and millions more watched on television. Distinguished attendees included former astronaut Buzz Aldrin and the Commanding officer of Edwards Air Force Base.

Because SpaceShipOne launches to the east of Mojave Spaceport early in the morning, the crowd at the spaceport found themselves looking into the sun when watching the aircraft. Nevertheless, the crowd was exuberant, cheering every milestone in the flight, including the double sonic boom following the thrust phase. After SpaceShipOne landed, White Knight and the chase planes made celebratory passes over the runway. Mike Melvill displayed great excitement, waving to the crowd while standing on top of SpaceShipOne. He also held up a sign reading &quot;SpaceShipOne, GovernmentZero,&quot; given to him by a spectator - an apparent reference to the then-ongoing suspension of Space Shuttle flight operations following the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia during STS-107. Melvill was greeted by Buzz Aldrin, the second person to have walked on the Moon.

==Reactions==
NASA administrator Sean O&#x27;Keefe issued a statement about the flight, saying:

The X Prize Foundation issued a press release about the flight:

The Federal Aviation Administration presented Melvill with astronaut wings in a ceremony at 10:22, two hours after landing.

==Relation to the Ansari X Prize==
As intended, the flight exceeded the 100 km threshold required for the X PRIZE. However, the flight was not intended as an X PRIZE competitive flight and was not registered as such.

The flight did not carry any passengers, or equivalent ballast, as required for an X PRIZE flight, and so could not qualify as a competitive flight. Furthermore, the X PRIZE rules require a repeat flight within two weeks, which the Scaled Composites team had no intention of making.

Flight 15P was intended to be the final test flight before making the two X PRIZE flights later in 2004. Due to the problems encountered on this flight, an additional test flight might be needed. However, by July 7, 2004, Burt Rutan reported that the faults had been resolved and the next flights would be competitive.

<text>Richard Mountford Deeley (24 October 1855 – 19 June 1944) was an English engineer, chiefly noted for his five years as Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the Midland Railway. Richard Deeley is recorded as being born in Derby His father had been an accountant with the Midland Railway and Richard attended grammar school in Chester.

==Career==
In 1873 he became a pupil of B. Ellington at the Hydraulic Engineering Co in Chester, and two years later he became a pupil of Samuel Waite Johnson at Derby Works. In March 1890 he became chief of the testing department at Derby, then progressed to the position of Inspector of Boilers, Engines and Machinery (March 1893), and to Derby Works Manager in January 1902, adding the post of Electrical Engineer a year later. In July 1903 he also became Assistant Locomotive Superintendent, subsequently replacing Johnson as Locomotive Superintendent on 1 January 1904.

==Compound locomotives==
He made significant contributions to compounding, adopting Smith&#x27;s system for his Midland Compound 4-4-0 locomotives. However, the refusal of the company&#x27;s board to sanction development of larger locomotives, and friction with the new senior managers, led him to resign his post at the end of 1909. After this he continued to work and publish on engineering problems in both railway and non-railway applications.

<doc id="741159" wikidata="Q817746" url="?curid=741159" title="Benjamin Williams Crowninshield">
<text>Benjamin Williams Crowninshield (December 27, 1772 – February 3, 1851) served as the United States Secretary of the Navy between 1815 and 1818, during the administrations of Presidents James Madison and James Monroe.

==Early life==

Crowninshield was born in Salem in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, the son of George Crowninshield (1734–1815) and Mary (née Derby) Crowninshield (1737–1813) who married in 1757. His father was a sea captain and merchant of the Boston Brahmin Crowninshield family. His family owned the lands near Mineral Spring, where the first Crowninshield family was cradled in the country.

His brothers included Congressman Jacob Crowninshield and George Crowninshield Jr., who owned &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Barge&quot;, the first yacht to cross the Atlantic. His sister Mary Crowninshield was the wife of Congressman Nathaniel Silsbee.

==Career==
Crowninshield worked in the family shipping business, Geo. Crowninshield &amp; Sons, serving at sea.

In 1811, Crowninshield was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives as a prominent benefactor of the first gerrymander. The redistricting of Essex county into two separate State House districts had led to the term &quot;gerrymander&quot;, with Crowninshield, who had lost the previous year&#x27;s Senate seat in a combined Essex County, being placed in the new district specifically designed to favor Republicans over Federalists. Crowninshield would win his Senate seat by only 8 votes, over 100 votes less than the other Republican candidates.

However, Crowninshield lost his seat in the State House the next year, with the &quot;Newburyport Herald&quot; printing an editorial cartoon of a dead gerrymander and listing &quot;B.W.C.&quot; as a &quot;chief mourner&quot;. He was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate in 1812.

===Secretary of the Navy===
Crowninshield became Secretary of the Navy in January 1815, a position almost held by his brother Jacob Crowninshield ten years earlier, and managed the transition to a peacetime force in the years following the War of 1812. This included implementation of the new Board of Commissioners administrative system and the building of several ships of the line, the backbone of a much enhanced Navy. He also oversaw strategy and naval policy for the Second Barbary War in 1815.

===United States House of Representatives===
After leaving Navy office in 1818, Crowninshield returned to business and political affairs in Massachusetts, prospering in both. In addition to serving two more terms in the Massachusetts House, he was also elected to four terms the United States Congress from 1823 to 1831.

==Personal life==
On January 1, 1804, Crowninshield was married to Mary Boardman (1778–1840), the daughter of Francis Boardman and Mary (née Hodges) Boardman. Together, they were the parents of:

* Elizabeth Boardman Crowninshield (1804–1884), who married William Mountford (1816–1885)
* Mary C. Crowninshield (1806–1893), who married Charles Mifflin (1805–1875)
* Francis Boardman Crowninshield (1809–1877), who married Sarah Putnam (1810–1880)
* George Casper Crowninshield (1812–1857), who married Harriet Sears Crowninshield (1809–1873); they were the parents of Frances &quot;Fanny&quot; Cadwalader Crowninshield (1839–1911), the wife of John Quincy Adams II.
* Annie G. Crowninshield (1815–1905), who married Jonathan Mason Warren (1811–1867)
* Edward Augustus Crowninshield (1817–1859), who married Caroline Maria Welch (1820–1897). After his death, his widow married Howard Payson Arnold (1831–1910).

On his death in Boston 1851, Benjamin Williams Crowninshield was interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

===Residence===
In 1810, Crowninshield, with Salem&#x27;s premier architect Samuel McIntire, built a mansion at 180 Derby Street on the Salem Waterfront. Robert Brookhouse purchased the house and in 1861 deeded it to the Association for the Relief of Aged Women. Located next to the Salem Maritime National Historic Site, the house is now called the Brookhouse Home for Aged Women.

===Descendants===
Through his son Francis, he was the grandfather of Benjamin Williams Crowninshield (1837–1892), a soldier in the Civil War and merchant, and the great-grandfather of Bowdoin Bradlee Crowninshield (1867–1948), a naval architect who specialized in the design of racing yachts, and Francis Boardman Crowninshield (1869–1950), who married heiress Louise Evelina du Pont (1877–1958).

Through his son Edward, Crowninshield was the grandfather of Frederic Crowninshield (1845–1918), the artist and author, and the great-grandfather of Francis Welch Crowninshield (1872–1947), the journalist, critic, and editor of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.

Crowninshield was also the great-great-grandfather of Charles Francis Adams III, also Secretary of the Navy from 1929 to 1933.

He was the great-great-great-grandfather of famed &quot;Washington Post&quot; newspaper editor Ben Bradlee (1921–2014).

==Namesake==
The destroyer USS &quot;Crowninshield&quot; (DD-134) was named in his honor.

<doc id="741165" wikidata="Q5538727" url="?curid=741165" title="George E. Cryer">
<text>George Edward Cryer (May 13, 1875 – May 24, 1961) was an American lawyer and politician. A Republican, Cryer served as the 32nd Mayor of Los Angeles from 1921 to 1929, a period of rapid growth in the city&#x27;s population. During his administration, the Los Angeles City Hall and Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum were built, and the city&#x27;s population surpassed 1,000,000. Prior and subsequent to serving as mayor, he was a lawyer. Between 1929 and 1931, Cryer became engaged in a widely publicized libel court case with the Reverend Robert P. Shuler, a radio evangelist who accused Cryer of being a &quot;grafter&quot; who had entered office a poor man and left office a millionaire.

==Early years==
Born on a farm in Waterloo, Douglas County, Nebraska, Cryer moved to southern California with his family in 1885. He was educated in the Redlands and Pasadena public schools and graduated from Los Angeles High School. When the Spanish–American War was declared in 1898, Cryer volunteered and served as a private in Company G, Seventh California Infantry. He was mustered out with rank of sergeant.

After his military service, Cryer enrolled at the University of Michigan Law School where he was the assistant editor of the &quot;Michigan Law Review&quot;. He graduated with honors and began the practice of law in Los Angeles in 1903. In September 1906, Cryer married Isabel Grace Gay. Mrs. Cryer was also a graduate of the University of Michigan, though the two did not meet until they were both residents of Los Angeles. Cryer and his wife had a son, Edward Gay Cryer (born. c. 1912) and a daughter, Catherine Christine Cryer (born c. 1915).

Cryer&#x27;s first public office was as first assistant United States Attorney, a position he held from approximately 1910–1912. He then served as the chief assistant Los Angeles City Attorney (1912–1913) and the chief deputy Los Angeles County District Attorney (1915–1919). He gained fame for prosecution of public corruption. In 1917, he was the prosecutor in the corruption case brought against Los Angeles County Supervisor Richard H. Norton.

==Mayor of Los Angeles==
Cryer was elected mayor of the City of Los Angeles in 1921 in a close election against the incumbent Meredith P. Snyder. Cryer&#x27;s campaign promised to close the &quot;dens of vice,&quot; and attacked Snyder as being corrupt and unfit to be mayor. The Los Angeles Police Commissioner sent a telegram to the newspapers before the election asking, &quot;Shall crime and protected vice continue, or will the voters and taxpayers elect George E. Cryer mayor?&quot; Cryer billed himself as a non-politician: &quot;I know nothing about politics, and I shall never be a politician. I have an idea that the business of the City of Los Angeles can be conducted like any other business ... quietly, effectively, efficiently.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; backed Cryer, noting, &quot;To talk with George E. Cryer is to know instinctively that he is not a politician clutching at straws for a &#x27;platform,&#x27; but that he is a quiet, effective man who does things.&quot;

Cryer was re-elected mayor in 1923 and again in 1925—the latter election was for the first four-year mayoral term. His eight-year administration was a period of explosive population growth, as the city passed 1,000,000 in population, and suburban sprawl began as businesses and residents moved west from the city&#x27;s historic core. During his administration, large public works projects were launched, including the construction of the Los Angeles City Hall, the Central Library (built at a cost of $2.3 million), the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and the Mulholland Highway. Cryer delivered the opening address and welcome the opening ceremony for the Coliseum on Armistice Day in 1923, and he led a parade of floats from the countries of the world as part of a ceremony marking the dedication of City Hall. The city also expanded its municipal-owned public utility system (the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power), and Cryer was instrumental in the passage of the legislation that provided for the construction of the Hoover Dam and All-American Canal, providing water and electricity to Los Angeles. The disappearance of Christine Collins&#x27; son, Walter, on March 10, 1928, also occurred during Cryer&#x27;s mayoralty. The disappearance brought publicity about the LAPD&#x27;s lack of eagerness, incompetence and corruption concerning this case; for example, committing Christine to the local psychiatric ward when she publicly said a boy they claimed to have brought from DeKalb, Illinois (the boy was actually from Iowa) was not her son.

After the St. Francis Dam disaster in 1928, Cryer won national prominence and commendation for promptly accepting the city&#x27;s responsibility for the disaster and agreeing to pay damages without the necessity of legal proceedings.

Cryer was also a leader in the successful effort to bring the 1932 Summer Olympic Games to Los Angeles. In May 1924, he declared a citywide half-day holiday and urged city residents to fill the new Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to capacity for Olympic try-outs. By filling the Coliseum, Cryer sought to demonstrate the city&#x27;s desire to host the Olympic games. Cryer led a parade of athletes into the Coliseum for an event that included a boxing exhibition by Jack Dempsey.

Cryer was also an opponent of communism and the activities of the Industrial Workers of the World. On taking office in 1921, Cryer declared: &quot;In this day of &#x27;isms&#x27; and I.W.W. agitation, every enemy of our flag and country and institutions is carrying on this insidious propaganda of destruction, and it is, therefore, very necessary and proper that the forces of law and order should be alive, awake, and on guard.&quot;

==Allegations of corruption==

Though Cryer had been elected to office as a reformer who would eliminate public corruption, Cryer&#x27;s administration became the target of corruption claims. Cryer defended his integrity against such charges and asserted when he left office that &quot;Los Angeles is now the cleanest large city in the country, far superior to any city anywhere comparable in size.&quot;

Some historical accounts indicate that Cryer was controlled by the city&#x27;s political boss, Kent Kane Parrot, and a coterie of bootleggers and criminals, including &quot;vice kingpin&quot; Charles H. Crawford (a model for some of Raymond Chandler&#x27;s villains). Indeed, the loosely organized crime syndicate operating within the city government became known as &quot;the City Hall Gang&quot; during the 1920s. Some have written that Cryer was a mere figurehead and that Parrot was the &quot;de facto mayor&quot; who ran the Harbor Commission and the Los Angeles Police Department, even transferring personnel without consulting with the city&#x27;s police chief.

Cryer&#x27;s opponent in 1925 focused attention on Parrot&#x27;s role in city government: &quot;I ask, as I shall continue to ask through this campaign: &#x27;Mr. Cryer, how much longer is Kent Parrot going to be the de-facto Mayor of Los Angeles&#x27;?&quot;

By 1927, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was openly critical of the relationship between Parrot and Cryer, referring to Cryer as Parrot&#x27;s &quot;personal mayor&quot;. Though the &quot;Times&quot; had been a strong backer of Cryer, the paper in 1927 published an editorial referring to the city government as &quot;Our Local Tammany&quot;, a reference to Boss Tweed&#x27;s Tammany Hall machine that controlled New York politics in the 19th century. The article ignored Cryer and focused its attack on the &quot;clumsy&quot; corruption of the political machine run by &quot;Boss Parrot&quot;:&quot;Evidently Boss Parrot&#x27;s subordinates are not well trained. Give him a few more years in control and he will, perhaps, do better. He must learn to think up plausible reasons for the actions of the organization and not let the purely political motive stick out like a sore thumb. Perhaps he thinks the voters of Los Angeles are so lacking in intelligence that this is unnecessary; if so, he is mistaken. It does not pay to be so raw anywhere.&quot;
A campaign to recall Cryer in 1927 was led by the City Planning Commissioner, Estelle Holman, and rumors spread that Cryer was &quot;tired&quot; and &quot;weary&quot; of the job, and that an &quot;Unknown Committee of Twenty-Five&quot; had formed to tell &quot;the Parrot-Cryer lame-duck city &#x27;administration&#x27; to ease the Mayor out of the side door of the City Hall.&quot;

By 1929, relations between the two principals of &quot;the so-called Parrot-Cryer political machine&quot; had been severed. Parrot leaked a report to the &quot;Los Angeles Record&quot; that Cryer would not seek re-election, and those close to Cryer openly charged Parrot with betraying the mayor. Cryer himself announced in late February 1929 that he would not run for re-election as mayor.

==Shuler libel trial==
In the late 1920s, a popular radio evangelist, the Rev. Robert P. &quot;Fighting Bob&quot; Shuler, repeatedly branded Cryer as a &quot;grafter&quot; and the &quot;chief exploiter,&quot; called his administration &quot;one of the must corrupt the city ever saw,&quot; linked him to vice king Charlie Crawford, and asserted that Cryer went into office as a poor man and came out as a millionaire. Shuler&#x27;s charges, made both on his radio station, KGEF, and in his magazine, led to a widely publicized libel lawsuit by Cryer against Shuler. The details of the Shuler libel suit were front-page news at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; for much of 1929.

At the trial in November 1929, Shuler&#x27;s lawyer cross-examined Cryer about allegations that he &quot;pitched dice at in Farmer Page&#x27;s place,&quot; and about his accumulation of wealth during his eight years as mayor. Cryer testified that he had a personal fortune of $160,000 when he took office in 1921 and left office in 1929 with a personal wealth of $450,000 which Cryer credited to &quot;realty deals absolutely uninfluenced by his political position.&quot; Asked if he had ever taken a bribe, Cryer replied: &quot;No, sir; never at any time, directly or indirectly. I never profited by my office. In fact, I considered it a financial detriment. It was the darndest job I ever had. It took practically all of my time, Sundays and every other day, and most of the night. I had to take the telephone out of my house so I could get a little sleep. I used to come home at nights from a banquet or something and people would call me sometimes at 3 o&#x27;clock in the morning -- some of them apparently insane.&quot;

The jury found Shuler not guilty on one count and failed to reach a verdict on a second count. When Shuler continued his attacks on Cryer, Shuler brought further proceedings in 1931, this time an administrative action before the Federal Radio Commission (&quot;FRC&quot;) seeking revocation of the broadcast license for Shuler&#x27;s radio station, KGEF. Shuler&#x27;s controversial broadcasts also included attacks on Catholics, African Americans, the YWCA (for sponsoring dances that extended into the early hours of Sunday morning), and Rufus B. von KleinSmid, the President of the University of Southern California for permitting evolution to be taught. In November 1931, Cryer succeeded in winning an order from the FRC revoking KGEF&#x27;s broadcast license.

==Later years and death==
After leaving office in 1929, Cryer went into the private practice of law. He ran for mayor again in 1933, but was defeated in the primary election. Cryer also served for a time as the president of Mutual Oil Company.

Cryer died at age 86 following surgery for a broken hip suffered when he tripped over a garden hose at his house in Los Angeles. As part of the city&#x27;s memorial service, Cryer&#x27;s body was carried into the rotunda of City Hall by an honor guard of policemen, a wreath placed on his casket by Mayor Norris Poulson, and his body lay in state in the rotunda. Cryer was entombed at Forest Lawn Mausoleum.

In the 2008 motion picture &quot;Changeling&quot;, the part of Mayor George Cryer was played by Reed Birney.

<text>128 Nemesis is a large 180 km main-belt asteroid, of carbonaceous composition. It rotates rather slowly, taking about 78 hours to complete one rotation. Nemesis is the largest member of the Nemesian asteroid family bearing its name. It was discovered by J. C. Watson on 25 November 1872, and named after Nemesis, the goddess of retribution in Greek mythology.
This object is orbiting the Sun with a period of and an eccentricity (ovalness) of 0.13. The orbital plane is inclined by 6.2° to the plane of the ecliptic. It is categorized as a C-type asteroid, indicating a primitive carbonaceous composition. Based on IRAS data Nemesis is about 188 km in diameter and is around the 33rd largest main-belt asteroid, while WISE measurements yield a size of ~163 km. The 77.81‑hour rotation period is the second longest for an asteroid more than 150 km in diameter.

Between 2005 and 2021, 128 Nemesis has been observed to occult eight stars.

<doc id="741168" wikidata="Q7994948" url="?curid=741168" title="White Knight (chocolate bar)">
<text>White Knight is a brand of chocolate-coated, chewy, mint-flavoured confectionery bar sold in Australia. Originally produced by Hoadley&#x27;s Chocolates it was later manufactured by Nestlé Australia. The packaging is blue and white and features a picture of a knight on a horse. Its slogan is &#x27;Mighty Mint Chew&#x27;. The product was discontinued in 2016.

==Description==
The 25 gram bar is composed of a white, mint flavoured chewy centre coated in compound chocolate.

In the 1980s the bar used to lie on top of a piece of cardboard within the wrapper. On the reverse of the card was a picture of a fictional knight which could be bent at the base to stand up. Children would aim to trade and collect the set of these knights. This part of the packaging was discontinued years later, presumably as a cost-cutting measure.

It was once sold across all major Australian supermarkets as well as some discount department stores (e.g. Kmart) and milk bars/convenience stores but as of 2014 was stocked only at Woolworths and Coles supermarkets and some specialty confectionery stores. The 25g bar was sold at a cheaper price point reflecting its smaller size (e.g. 75c in 2008) but in early 2010 its price was raised similar to the larger (50–60 g) sized chocolate bars (90c at Coles/Woolworths/Kmart). 

The production of White Knight was discontinued by Nestlé Australia around 2016.

<doc id="741170" wikidata="Q6823137" url="?curid=741170" title="Metaphysical necessity">
<text>In philosophy, metaphysical necessity, sometimes called broad logical necessity, is one of many different kinds of , which sits between logical necessity and nomological (or physical) necessity, in the sense that logical necessity entails metaphysical necessity, but not vice versa, and metaphysical necessity entails physical necessity, but not vice versa. A proposition is said to be &quot;necessary&quot; if it could not have failed to be the case. Nomological necessity is necessity according to the laws of physics and logical necessity is necessity according to the laws of logic, while metaphysical necessities are necessary in the sense that the world could not possibly have been otherwise. What facts are metaphysically necessary, and on what basis we might view certain facts as metaphysically but not logically necessary are subjects of substantial discussion in contemporary philosophy.

The concept of a metaphysically necessary being plays an important role in certain arguments for the existence of God, especially the ontological argument, but metaphysical necessity is also one of the central concepts in late 20th century analytic philosophy. Metaphysical necessity has proved a controversial concept, and criticized by David Hume, Immanuel Kant, J. L. Mackie, and Richard Swinburne, among others.

== Types of necessity ==
Metaphysical necessity is contrasted with other types of necessity. For example, the philosophers of religion John Hick and William L. Rowe distinguished the following three:
# factual necessity (existential necessity): a factually necessary being is not causally dependent on any other being, while any other being is causally dependent on it.
# causal necessity (subsumed by Hick under the former type): a causally necessary being is such that it is logically impossible for it to be causally dependent on any other being, and it is logically impossible for any other being to be causally independent of it.
# logical necessity: a logically necessary being is a being whose non-existence is a logical impossibility, and which therefore exists either timeless or eternally in all possible worlds.

== Hume&#x27;s dictum ==
Hume&#x27;s dictum is a thesis about necessary connections between distinct entities. Its original formulation can be found in David Hume&#x27;s A Treatise of Human Nature: &quot;There is no object, which implies the existence of any other if we consider these objects in themselves&quot;. Hume&#x27;s intuition motivating this thesis is that while experience presents us with certain ideas of various objects, it might as well have presented us with very different ideas. So when I perceive a bird on a tree, I might as well have perceived a bird without a tree or a tree without a bird. This is so because their essences do not depend upon another. David Lewis follows this line of thought in formulating his &quot;principle of recombination&quot;: &quot;anything can coexist with anything else, at least provided they occupy distinct spatiotemporal positions. Likewise, anything can fail to coexist with anything else&quot;.

Hume&#x27;s dictum has been employed in various arguments in contemporary metaphysics. It can be used, for example, as an argument against nomological necessitarianism, the view that the laws of nature are necessary, i.e. are the same in all possible worlds. To see how this might work, consider the case of salt being thrown into a cup of water and subsequently dissolving. This can be described as a series of two events, a throwing-event and a dissolving-event. Necessitarians hold that all possible worlds with the throwing-event also contain a subsequent dissolving-event. But the two events are distinct entities, so according to Hume&#x27;s dictum, it is possible to have one event without the other. An even wider application is to use Hume&#x27;s dictum as an axiom of modality to determine which propositions or worlds are possible based on the notion of recombination.

Ludwig Wittgenstein likewise critiqued the notion of &#x27;metaphysical neccessity&#x27; writing that &quot;the sun will rise to-morrow, is an hypothesis; and that means that we do not know whether it will rise. A necessity for one thing to happen because another has happened does not exist. There is only logical necessity&quot;.

== &quot;A posteriori&quot; and necessary truths ==
In &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot;, Saul Kripke argued that there were &quot;a posteriori&quot; truths, such as &quot;Hesperus is Phosphoros&quot;, or &quot;Water is H2O&quot;, that were nonetheless metaphysically necessary.

== Necessity in theology ==
While many theologians (e.g. Anselm of Canterbury, René Descartes, and Gottfried Leibniz) considered God to be a logically or metaphysically necessary being, Richard Swinburne argued for factual necessity, and Alvin Plantinga argues that God is a causally necessary being. Because a factually or causally necessary being does not exist by logical necessity, it does not exist in all logically possible worlds. Therefore, Swinburne used the term &quot;ultimate brute fact&quot; for the existence of God.

<doc id="741182" wikidata="Q477807" url="?curid=741182" title="Charles A. Culberson">
<text>Charles Allen Culberson (June 10, 1855 – March 19, 1925) was an American political figure and Democrat who served as the 21st Governor of Texas from 1895 to 1899, and as a United States senator from Texas from 1899 to 1923.

== Early life and education ==
Charles Allen Culberson was born on June 10, 1855, in Dadeville, Alabama, to Eugenia (née Kimbal) and David Browning Culberson. His father was a Democratic politician. Culberson&#x27;s family moved to Texas in 1856, settling first in Gilmer and later in Jefferson.

Culberson attended Virginia Military Institute, graduating in 1874, and subsequently studied law under his father and then at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville in 1876 and 1877. In 1877 he was admitted to the bar in Daingerfield, Texas, and commenced practice in Jefferson, later moving to Dallas in 1887. He was a member of the Jefferson Literacy Society and the Moot Court at the University of Virginia.

==Law career==
Culberson started practicing law in Marion County in 1877. He was known for overturning a verdict for a man convicted of murder under the Ku Klux Law of Texas, and causing the law to be labeled as unconstitutional.

==Political career==
===Texas state politics===
Culberson&#x27;s political career began with his election as Attorney General of Texas in 1890, a position he held until 1895, after campaigning for and winning the governor&#x27;s race in November 1894. After two terms as governor, he was elected to the U.S. Senate as a Democrat on January 25, 1899.

===Senate tenure===

Early during his tenure, he served on the Lodge Committee investigating war crimes in the Philippine–American War. Later, he chaired several senate committees, including the judiciary committee, which he chaired from 1913 to 1919. Culberson was opposed to demands for racial equality, stating that efforts to do so would lead to the &quot;consequent debasement, degradation or destruction of the white race&quot;.

Culberson was reelected in 1905, 1911, and, again, by popular vote in 1916, when health problems and alcoholism prevented him from campaigning in Texas but did not prevent his reelection. However, his health and opposition to the Ku Klux Klan finally led to the loss of his seat in the Democratic primary in 1922.

He was succeeded by fellow Democrat Earle Bradford Mayfield, the outgoing member of the Texas Railroad Commission.
==Personal life==
Culberson married Sallie Harrison on December 7, 1882. They had one daughter, Mary Harrison.

Culberson lived in retirement until his death from pneumonia in Washington, D.C., on March 19, 1925. He is buried in East Oakwood Cemetery in Fort Worth, Texas.

Culberson was a distant cousin of John Culberson, who represented between 2001 and 2019.

<doc id="741183" wikidata="Q798455" url="?curid=741183" title="Backlash (sociology)">
<text>A backlash is a strong adverse reaction to an idea, action, or object. It is usually a reflection of a normative resentment rather than a denial of its existence. In Western identitarian political discourse, the term is commonly applied to instances of bias and discrimination against marginalized groups. In this form of discourse, backlash can be explained as the response- or counter reaction- to efforts of social change made by a group to gain access to rights or power.

== Historical Western examples ==
* 13th Amendment — Jim Crow Laws were racial backlash in response to the amendment to the United States constitution.
* Civil rights — Voting restrictions implemented.
* Women&#x27;s Movement — Backlash centered on infertility issues, women&#x27;s &quot;biological clock&quot; and shortage of men.

== Contemporary Western examples ==
* Me Too Movement — Impacted women in the workforce. Men were more reluctant to hire women deemed attractive, more reluctant to have one-on-one meetings with women, and had greater fears of being unfairly accused. In addition to this, 56% of women surveyed predicted that men would continue to harass them but would be more cautious to avoid being caught. Backlash of date-rape prevalent with misleading language used in media. In 1987 it was called an &quot;epidemic&quot; and in 1993, &quot;rape hype&quot;; terms that were exaggerated and victim oriented.
* Abortion — Defund Planned Parenthood Act 
** &quot;This bill temporarily restricts federal funding for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. Specifically, the bill prohibits, for a one-year period, the availability of federal funds for any purpose to this entity, or any of its affiliates or clinics, unless they certify that the affiliates and clinics will not perform, and will not provide any funds to any other entity that performs, an abortion during such period. This restriction does not apply in cases of rape or incest or where a physical condition endangers a woman&#x27;s life unless an abortion is performed.

* LGBT backlash — Bathroom bills and medical bans are proposed to restrict the rights of transgender youth and adults. Arguments center around fair play in sports and sexual harassment in bathrooms. 
* Black Lives Matter — Blue Lives Matter and All Lives Matter campaigns created in response.
* Bikelash - A colloquial term about the social and political resistance to the creation of urban infrastructure intended to accommodate safer cycling, seemingly at the expense of the use of automobiles.

<text>Strøget () is a pedestrian, car-free shopping area in Copenhagen, Denmark. This popular tourist attraction in the centre of town is one of the longest pedestrian shopping streets in Europe at 1.1 km. Located at the centre of the old city of Copenhagen, it has long been one of the most high-profile streets in the city. 

==Geography==

The main street is bound on the west by City Hall Square (), the central town square by Copenhagen City Hall, and on the east by Kongens Nytorv (&quot;The King&#x27;s New Square&quot;), another large square at the other end. But the Strøget area is actually a collection of streets that spread out from this central thoroughfare. Components of the pedestrianised network are:
* Frederiksberggade
* Gammel Torv / Nytorv
* Nygade

==History==

Strøget was known as &quot;Ruten&quot; until the late 19th century. This collection of streets has been at the heart of the city, and amongst the most fashionable in the city for much of its history. The layout of the streets comprising Strøget has been in place since 1728 when Frederiksberggade was laid out after a fire. Most of the buildings along the street date to the late 19th or early 20th centuries, with the oldest building dating to 1616.

Strøget was converted to a pedestrian zone on 17 November 1962 when cars were beginning to dominate Copenhagen&#x27;s old central streets. Inspired by a number of new pedestrian streets created in Germany after the war, during the 1950s the street had closed to traffic for some of days at Christmas. The 1962 closure was initially a temporary trial, but the change was made permanent in 1964, and the road has remained closed since. The idea was controversial, some people believing that the Danes did not have the mentality for &quot;public life&quot; envisioned by such a street, and many local merchants believed the move would scare away business. The &#x27;father&#x27; of a car free Strøget, Alfred Wassard, Copenhagen&#x27;s &#x27;mayor for town planning&#x27; from 1962 to 1978, even faced death threats. On the opening day, police officers were present to protect against assassination threats, and unhappy car drivers honked their horns on side streets to mark their displeasure although the event was well attended and marked by dancing and music. The posher shops on the east end of the street were particularly opposed to the change, and they tried to have the project restricted to its western portion which was dominated by bars and cinemas at the time.

However the project quickly proved a success, and the area soon boasted more shoppers, cafes, and a renewed street life. Building on Strøget&#x27;s success, the network expanded piecemeal – another street and a few more squares were emptied of cars in 1968, and further closures took place in 1973, and 1992. From the initial 15,800 square metres of the Strøget, Copenhagen&#x27;s central pedestrian network has expanded to about 100,000 square metres. In 1993 Amagertorv (Amager square) was re-surfaced in a pattern made of granite, designed by artist Bjørn Nørgaard. Nearby areas were also pedestrianised over the years, for example Nyhavn in 1980 and the town hall square (semi-pedestrianised) in 1996 on the occasion of Copenhagen being the European Capital of Culture (the through road was removed although bus traffic remained, and the square is still bounded by traffic).

==Influence==

Architect Jan Gehl studied the new pedestrian area starting in 1962 and his influential reports and findings on the subject formed the basis of Copenhagen&#x27;s subsequent broader policy shift toward emphasising pedestrians and bicycles. Gehl and Copenhagen&#x27;s policies have later become influential around the world, encouraging cities such as Melbourne and New York to pedestrianise.

==Today==
The street is often credited as the oldest and longest pedestrian street in the world; in fact neither claim is true, although it was the longest pedestrian street at the time of its conversion in 1962. Rue Sainte-Catherine in Bordeaux is longer, while Lijnbaan in Rotterdam was pedestrianised in 1953. And Laisvės Alėja in Kaunas, Lithuania is longer– stretching to 1.6 km. More recently, George Street in Sydney, extends to 2 km.

About 80,000 people use Strøget every day at the height of tourist season in summer, and about 48,000 do so on a winter&#x27;s day. On the last Sunday before Christmas as many as 120,000 may use Strøget. Jan Gehl believes that Strøget is now roughly at its handling capacity on a summer&#x27;s day, given its width at 10–12 metres and space for roughly 145 people/minute.

Many of the city&#x27;s most famous and expensive stores are located along the strip, as well as some of the most famous and expensive luxury brand chain stores in the world. It also features a multitude of souvenir shops and fast food outlets.

The Lonely Planet travel guide noted as of 2014 that although Strøget is &quot;a fun place to stroll,&quot; bustling with musicians and people, it seemed to be stagnating, &quot;offering the same old international brand names&quot; and &quot;a scrappy mix of budget clothing stores, tourist shops and kebab houses.&quot; They advised that visitors should, &quot;walk down it once, but after that you&#x27;ll find the side streets far more productive in terms of independent shops and more interesting design.&quot;

==Transport==
Many bus lines have stops close to the Strøget area, and at Kongens Nytorv is a Metro station. Also the S-train stations Vesterport and Nørreport are located nearby. (Nørreport is located very close to a pedestrian commercial street which leads to the &quot;real&quot; Strøget). Two metro stations opened on 29 September 2019 at City Hall Square and Gammel Strand. The latter one is located close to the middle of Strøget.

<doc id="741187" wikidata="Q3115617" url="?curid=741187" title="Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene">
<text>Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) is an oligomer of butadiene terminated at each end with a hydroxyl functional group. It reacts with isocyanates to form polyurethane polymers.

HTPB is a translucent liquid with a color similar to wax paper and a viscosity similar to corn syrup. The properties vary because HTPB is a mixture rather than a pure compound, and it is manufactured to meet customers&#x27; specific requirements. A typical HTPB is R-45HTLO. This product consists of oligomeric units typically containing 40–50 butadiene molecules bonded together, with each end of the chain terminated with a hydroxyl [OH] group: 

R-45HTLO has a functionality of 2.4-2.6, which means that there is (approximately) one additional hydroxyl group located along the chain for every two oligomeric units. This provides side-to-side linkage for a stronger cured product. HTPB is usually cured by an addition reaction with di- or poly-isocyanate compounds.

==Uses==

===Materials production===
Polyurethanes prepared from HTPB can be engineered for specific physical properties; polyurethanes may be highly elastic or tough and rigid. Some products include: rigid foam insulation panels; durable elastomeric wheels and tires (used for roller coasters, escalators, skateboards, etc.); automotive suspension bushings; electrical potting compounds; high-performance adhesives; surface coatings and surface sealants; synthetic fibers (e.g., Spandex); carpet underlay; hard-plastic parts (e.g., for electronic instruments).

===Rocket propellant===

An important application of HTPB is in solid rocket propellant. It binds the oxidizing agent, fuel and other ingredients into a solid but elastic mass in most composite propellant systems. The cured polyurethane acts as a fuel in such mixtures. For example, HTPB is used in all 3/4 stages of the Japanese M-5 launch vehicles and in 1/3 stages of Indian PSLV launch vehicle. JAXA describes the propellant as &quot;HTPB/AP/Al=12/68/20&quot;, which means, proportioned by mass, HTPB plus curative 12% (binder and fuel), ammonium perchlorate 68% (oxidizer), and aluminum powder 20% (fuel).

Similar propellants, often referred to as APCP (ammonium perchlorate composite propellant) are used in larger model rockets. A typical APCP propellant mixture produces 2–3 times the specific impulse of the black powder propellant used in most smaller rocket motors.

HTPB is also used as a hybrid rocket fuel. With N2O (nitrous oxide, or &quot;laughing gas&quot;) as the oxidizer, it is used to power the SpaceShipTwo hybrid rocket motor developed by SpaceDev. The land speed record attempt Bloodhound SSC was to have used HTPB with a high-test peroxide oxidizer, but that plan was altered in 2017.

<doc id="741198" wikidata="Q1850312" url="?curid=741198" title="Prime Minister of Zambia">
<text>The prime minister of Zambia was the head of government of Zambia. From 1973 to 1975, Mainza Chona was the first person to hold the position following independence from the United Kingdom (Kenneth Kaunda was the only prime minister of Northern Rhodesia in 1964, before it became independent as Zambia).

The position of the prime minister of Zambia was abolished in 1991, in the last months of Kaunda&#x27;s presidential term. Since then, the President of Zambia serves as both the head of state and the head of government.

==History==

===Northern Rhodesia===
When the country was founded as the British colony of Northern Rhodesia separate from British South Africa Company rule in the Rhodesias, the elected Legislative Council was created. At the time, the office of prime minister did not exist, with all executive power being vested in the governor of Northern Rhodesia. However, the leader of the largest elected party on the council was considered as the &quot;unofficial&quot; prime minister. When Northern Rhodesia united with Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland to form the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the office of prime minister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was created, with Northern Rhodesia&#x27;s Roy Welensky becoming the second and final holder of the office. Following the breakup of the federation due to the withdrawal of Northern Rhodesia, the office of prime minister was created for the colony. The first and only prime minister of Northern Rhodesia was the United National Independence Party&#x27;s (UNIP) Kenneth Kaunda after winning the 1964 general election ahead of independence.

===Zambia===
Upon independence and the renaming of the country as Zambia, Kaunda became the new president of Zambia after being elected unopposed. The office of prime minister was abolished accordingly. In 1973, following an amendment to the Constitution of Zambia, the office of prime minister was re-established as the titular head of the government but the holder would be subordinate to the Secretary-General of UNIP in governing Zambia. This was because the Central Committee of UNIP had precedence over the Parliament of Zambia under the Constitution. President Kaunda appointed his former vice-president, Mainza Chona, as prime minister. In 1975, Chona resigned and was replaced by Elijah Mudenda. In 1977, Chona became prime minister again for a year before the role was taken over by Daniel Lisulo. Kebby Musokotwane took the role over from Nalumino Mundia in 1985, becoming the youngest prime minister and also the first that was not a member of UNIP&#x27;s Central Committee. He was removed in 1989 and given an overseas diplomatic post due to President Kaunda believing he was aiming to become the next president.

In 1991, the office was abolished again following a new constitution being created to allow for multi-party democratic elections following UNIP negotiations with the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD). The powers the prime minister had were subsumed back into the office of president. The constitution allowed for the final prime minister, Malimba Masheke, to remain in office until the 1991 Zambian general election. According to Masheke, at the time of abolition the prime minister was being paid less than his private secretary.

<doc id="741203" wikidata="Q434797" url="?curid=741203" title="Józef Cyrankiewicz">
<text>Józef Adam Zygmunt Cyrankiewicz (; 23 April 1911 – 20 January 1989) was a Polish Socialist (PPS) and after 1948 Communist politician. He served as premier of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic between 1947 and 1952, and again for 16 years between 1954 and 1970. He also served as Chairman of the Polish Council of State from 1970 to 1972.

== Early life ==
Cyrankiewicz was born in Tarnów in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to father Józef (1881–1939) and mother Regina &quot;née&quot; Szpak (1879–1967). His father was a local activist of the National Democracy as well as lieutenant in the Polish Armed Forces while his mother was an owner of several sawmills. Cyrankiewicz attended the Jagiellonian University. He became secretary of the Kraków branch of the Polish Socialist Party in 1935.

==World War II==
Active in the Union of Armed Struggle (Związek Walki Zbrojnej, later renamed to Armia Krajowa), the Polish resistance organisation, from the beginning of Poland&#x27;s 1939 defeat at the start of World War II, Cyrankiewicz was captured by the Gestapo in the spring of 1941 and after imprisonment at Montelupich was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. He arrived on 4 September 1942, and received registration number 62,933.

He, along with other Auschwitz prisoners, was eventually transferred to Mauthausen as the Soviet front line approached Auschwitz late in the war. He was eventually liberated by the US Army.

=== The Auschwitz controversy ===
According to post-war communist era-propaganda, while in Auschwitz, Cyrankiewicz attempted to organize a resistance movement among the other imprisoned socialists and also worked on bringing the various international prisoners&#x27; groups together; those claims, used to build up his reputation in post-war Poland, are considered exaggerated by modern historians. Instead, modern historians note that Cyrankiewicz controversially not only refused an appeal of a death sentence by Witold Pilecki, a Home Army resistance fighter who infiltrated Auschwitz and is considered to be the main creator of the resistance there, but suggested that he be treated &quot;harshly, as an enemy of the state&quot;.

==Rise to power==

=== First period in office ===

Following the end of the war, he became secretary-general of the Polish Socialist Party&#x27;s central executive committee in 1946. However, factional infighting split the Party into two camps: one led by Cyrankiewicz, the other by Edward Osóbka-Morawski, who was also prime minister.

Osóbka-Morawski thought the PPS should join with the other non-communist party in Poland, the Polish Peasant Party, to form a united front against communism. Cyrankiewicz argued that the PPS should support the communists (who held most of the posts in the government) in carrying through a socialist programme, while opposing the imposition of one party rule. The Communist Polish Workers&#x27; Party (PPR) played on this division within the PPS, dismissing Osóbka-Morawski and making Cyrankiewicz prime minister.

The PPS merged with the PPR in 1948 to form the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR). Although the PZPR was the PPR under a new name, Cyrankiewicz remained as prime minister. He was also named a secretary of the PZPR Central Committee.

Cyrankiewicz gave up the prime minister&#x27;s post in 1952 because party boss Bolesław Bierut wanted the post for himself. He did, however, become a deputy premier under Bierut.

=== Second period in office ===
However, in 1954, after Poland returned to &quot;collective leadership,&quot; Cyrankiewicz returned to the premiership, a post he would hold until 1970. By this time, there was little left of Cyrankiewicz the socialist, as evidenced during the 1956 upheaval following Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s &quot;secret speech.&quot; He tried to repress the rioting that erupted across the country at first, threatening that &quot;any provocateur or lunatic who raises his hand against the people&#x27;s government may be sure that this hand will be chopped off.&quot;

Cyrankiewicz was also responsible for the order to fire on the protesters during the 1970 demonstrations on the coast in which 42 people were killed and more than a 1,000 wounded. A few months after these demonstrations, Cyrankiewicz turned over the premiership to his longtime deputy, Piotr Jaroszewicz, and was named chairman of the Council of State—a post equivalent to that of president. Although it was nominally the highest state post in Poland, Cyrankiewicz had gone into semi-retirement. He held this post until he formally retired in 1972.

Cyrankiewicz died in 1989, a few months before the collapse of the communist regime. However, Cyrankiewicz (with others involved in the 1948 show trial) was posthumously charged in 2003 with complicity in Witold Pilecki&#x27;s judicial murder.

<text>Dragiša Cvetković (; 15 January 1893 – 18 February 1969) was a Yugoslav politician active in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He served as the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 1939 to 1941. He developed the federalization of Yugoslavia through the creation of the Banovina of Croatia via the Cvetković–Maček Agreement with Croat leader Vladko Maček. He signed the Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. Two days later, on 27 March, a group of officers carried out a military coup, and arrested Dragiša Cvetković and other ministers. German authorities arrested him on two occasions and took him to Banjica concentration camp. He fled on 4 September 1944 for Bulgaria. He spent the rest of his life in Paris.

He previously served as mayor of Niš. On 25 September 2009, the regional court in Cvetković&#x27;s hometown of Niš rehabilitated him from charges laid against him by the Yugoslav government in 1945.

<text>Francesca Cuzzoni (2 April 1696 – 19 June 1778) was an Italian operatic soprano of the Baroque era.

==Early career==

Cuzzoni was born in Parma. Her father, Angelo, was a professional violinist, and her singing teacher was Francesco Lanzi. She made her debut in her home city in 1714, singing in &quot;La virtù coronata, o Il Fernando&quot; by an unknown composer. In 1716–17 she sang at Bologna in operas by Bassani, Buini, Gasparini and Giuseppe Maria Orlandini. By the 1717–18 season she had been appointed (&quot;chamber soloist&quot;) to Violante Beatrice, Grand Princess of Tuscany, performing at Florence, Siena, Genoa, Mantua, and Reggio nell&#x27;Emilia in operas by Orlandini and Carlo Francesco Pollarolo, and in Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;Scanderbeg&quot; . She also made her Venetian debut in 1718, singing the role of Dalinda in Pollarolo&#x27;s &quot;Ariodante&quot;, in which, for the first time, she appeared on the same stage as Faustina Bordoni, later her great rival. They also sang together in Venice the following year in Michelangelo Gasparini&#x27;s &quot;Il Lamano&quot;, and in &quot;Il pentimento generoso&quot; by Stefano Andrea Fiorè, in which the redoubtable duo were joined by the famous castrato Antonio Maria Bernacchi. Having appeared at Florence and Milan (1719), Bologna, Florence and Turin (1720), and Padua (1721), she returned to Venice for the season of 1721–22, singing in five operas, including Orlandini&#x27;s &quot;Nerone&quot;: she sang Poppea, Faustina Octavia, while the fine contralto Diana Vico was Agrippina.

==Cuzzoni&#x27;s first visit to London==

Cuzzoni&#x27;s arrival in the English capital was keenly anticipated in the press. Though the &quot;London Journal&quot; for 27 October 1722 reported that &quot;Mrs. Cotsona [sic], an extraordinary Italian Lady, ... is expected daily&quot;, she apparently found time to marry Pietro Giuseppe Sandoni during her journey, and did not make her debut in London until 12 January 1723, creating the role of Teofane in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Ottone&quot; at the King&#x27;s Theatre, Haymarket. To an aria in her role, &quot;Falsa immagine&quot;, there is attached a famous story, vividly illustrating both her character and that of the composer. The part not having been originally intended for her (but perhaps for Maddalena Salvai), at rehearsal she refused to sing this, her first aria. According to the historian John Mainwaring, Handel replied: &quot;Oh! Madame I know well that you are a real she-devil, but I hereby give you notice, me, that I am Beelzebub, the Chief of Devils.&quot; Mainwaring continued: &quot;With this, he took her up by the waist, and, if she made any more words, swore that he would fling her out of the window.&quot; According to Burney, her singing of this aria &quot;fixed her reputation as an expressive and pathetic singer&quot;, and her success was such that the price of half-guinea opera tickets reportedly shot up to four guineas. By the time of her benefit concert only two months later, some noblemen were believed to be giving her fifty guineas a ticket. Her salary was also large: £2000 a season. Her appearance was no recommendation: Burney described her as &quot;short and squat, with a doughy cross face, but fine complexion; ... not a good actress; dressed ill; and was silly and fantastical.&quot;

Cuzzoni was a member of Handel&#x27;s Royal Academy of Music (1719) for its remaining five years. He created nine roles for her, the most famous today being Cleopatra in &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; and the title-role in &quot;Rodelinda&quot;. In the latter, she wore a brown silk dress trimmed with silver, &quot;with the vulgarity and indecorum of which all the old ladies were much scandalized, the young adopted it as a fashion, so universally, that it seemed a national uniform for youth and beauty&quot; (Burney). For this company she also sang in seven operas by Attilio Ariosti, four by Giovanni Bononcini and two pasticcios. The enthusiasm of her supporters led to quarrels with the fans of Senesino, and later with those of Faustina Bordoni, whose London debut was in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Alessandro&quot; (1726). In this opera the importance of the two ladies&#x27; roles had to be very carefully balanced, which at one point in the opera&#x27;s plot made Senesino, playing the name part, look a complete fool. Her rivalry with Faustina, fanned by the press, eventually became scandalous when, in a performance of Bononcini&#x27;s &quot;Astianatte&quot; (6 June 1727), attended by princess Caroline, &quot;Hissing on one Side, and Clapping on the other&quot; gave rise to &quot;Catcalls, and other great indecencies&quot;. Such was the rumpus that the performance, and the rest of that opera season, were abandoned. The satirical pamphleteers had a field day, depicting the two exchanging insults and pulling at one another&#x27;s head-dresses, though recent research has revealed that it was the ladies&#x27; rival supporters, rather than the singers themselves, who were the cause of the disturbance. They were further lampooned in John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, which was premiered on 29 January 1728. In spite of such fracas they continued to sing together for Handel until his company&#x27;s demise in June of that year.

==A continental interlude==

Cuzzoni spent the winter of 1728-29 in Vienna at the invitation of Count Kinsky (Imperial Ambasasador to London), but, in spite of her great success there was not engaged by the opera because she demanded too high a salary. Later in 1729 she sang at Modena and Venice, and in the autumn of that year, Handel&#x27;s impresario Heidegger wished to engage both her and Faustina for the new &quot;Second Royal Academy&quot;. Handel had had enough of both of them, however, and so Cuzzoni went instead to Bologna, Naples, Piacenza and Venice during 1730-31, and Bologna and Florence again during the following season, when, amongst others, she sang in operas by her husband (she never performed under his name). Their association continued during the carnival seasons of 1733 and 1734, when she appeared at Genoa.

==In London again==

In 1733, a group of English aristocrats wished to set up an opera company to rival Handel&#x27;s, and Cuzzoni was one of the first singers they approached. She returned in April 1734, joining the cast of Porpora&#x27;s &quot;Arianna a Nasso&quot;. For this company, known as the &quot;Opera of the Nobility&quot;, she sang in four more operas by Porpora, and others by Sandoni, Hasse, Orlandini, Veracini, Ciampi, the pasticcio &quot;Orfeo&quot; and even a version of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Ottone&quot;. It would seem that she made less of an impression during this visit, not least due to the presence of the incomparably famous Farinelli in the same company.

==Later career==

Nonetheless, Cuzzoni was still a force to be reckoned with. After the collapse of the Nobility Opera, she returned to the continent, singing in Florence in 1737-38, and at Turin the following year, when, for one carnival season, she received the huge fee of 8,000 lire. Later that year she sang at Vienna, and seems to have made her last operatic appearances in Hamburg in 1740. On 17 September 1741 the &quot;London Daily Post&quot; reported that Cuzzoni was to be beheaded for poisoning her husband, but, though they had separated by 1742, he did not die until 1748. She sang concerts in Amsterdam in 1742, and by December 1745 had become a court singer in Stuttgart. In debt, a condition she frequently suffered in her later life, she absconded from there to Bologna in 1748. Still needing to perform to pay her creditors, she was again in London in 1750, where Burney heard her &quot;thin cracked voice&quot; in a concert on 18 May. On 2 August of that year Horace Walpole wrote that &quot;old Cuzzoni&quot; had been arrested for a debt of £30, and bailed by the Prince of Wales. On 20 May 1751, the &quot;General Advertiser&quot; gave notice of a final benefit concert for Cuzzoni, accompanied by a letter from the singer in which she wrote: &quot;I am so extremely sensible of the many Obligations I have already received from the Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdom ... that nothing but extreme necessity and a desire of doing justice, could induce me to trouble them again, but being unhappily involved in a few Debts, am extremely desirous of attempting every Thing in my Power to pay them, before I quit England ...&quot;

Of her last years, little is known, save that she returned once more to the continent, and lived a poverty-stricken existence, eking out a living, it is said, making buttons. She died in Bologna. Of the two children she seems to have had by Sandoni, nothing is known - they may have died in infancy.

==Cuzzoni as an artist==

Clearly, in her prime, Cuzzoni was a singer and artist of the first class. The well-known writer on singing, Giovanni Battista Mancini, gave a glowing testament to her art:

&quot;It is difficult to decide whether she excels more in slow or in rapid airs. A &quot;native warble&quot; enabled her to execute divisions with such facility as to conceal their difficulty. So grateful and touching was her natural tone that she rendered pathetic whatever she sang, when she had the opportunity to unfold the whole volume of her voice. Her power of conducting, sustaining, increasing, and diminishing her notes by minute degrees acquired for her the credit of being a complete mistress of her art. Her trill was perfect: she had a creative fancy, and a command of tempo rubato. Her high notes were unrivaled in clearness and sweetness, and her intonation was so absolutely true that she seemed incapable of singing out of tune. She had a compass of two octaves, C to C in alt. Her style was unaffected, simple, and sympathetic.&quot;

Quantz wrote that &quot;her style of singing was innocent and affecting&quot; and that her ornaments &quot;took possession of the soul of every auditor, by her tender and touching expression&quot;.

<text>Taizé () is a commune in the Saône-et-Loire department in the region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté in eastern France. The commune lies northwest of Mâcon, the capital of Saône-et-Loire, and north of the town of Cluny.

==Pilgrimage site==

The commune contains two churches; the small Parish church and the much larger &quot;Church of Reconciliation&quot;. The latter church can hold over 6,000 people. Both churches are run by the &quot;Taizé Community&quot;, an ecumenical monastic community founded in 1940 by Brother Roger. It is composed of more than one hundred brothers, from Protestant and Catholic traditions, who originate from about thirty countries across the world.

Taizé is today known as a place of pilgrimage, primarily for young adults: every week, hundreds and thousands of visitors, generally between the ages of 17 and 30, visit Taizé for an experience of prayer and communal life.

==Geography==
The commune has an area of . The river Grosne forms all of the commune&#x27;s western border.

==Miscellaneous==
The asteroid 100033 Taizé was discovered by Freimut Börngen on April 9, 1990. It is named in honour of Taizé.

<doc id="741214" wikidata="Q7807133" url="?curid=741214" title="Timothy Cutler">
<text>Timothy Cutler (May 31, 1684 – August 17, 1765) was an American Episcopal clergyman and rector of Yale College.

==Family background==
Cutler was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, a descendant of Robert Cutler who settled there prior to October 28, 1636. His father was Major John Cutler, an anchorsmith, and his mother, Martha Wiswall. Both his father and grandfather opposed the government formed after the overthrow of Edmund Andros, an early colonial governor in North America, and head of the short-lived Dominion of New England in 1689. Although severely penalized, they refused to subscribe to the government until it had received royal sanction. His ancestors&#x27; tendency to conform to the established order suggests a reason for Timothy&#x27;s subsequent conversion to the Church of England.

==Early life==
When seventeen years old, Cutler graduated from Harvard College, and on January 11, 1709/10, having come from Massachusetts to Connecticut with the recommendation of being &quot;one of the best preachers both colonies afforded&quot;, he was ordained pastor of the Congregational church in Stratford.

On March 21, 1710/11, he married Elizabeth, daughter of Rev. Samuel Andrew of Milford, Connecticut, then acting rector of Yale College. Cutler served his parish acceptably until March 1718/19 when, conditions at Yale College calling imperatively for a resident rector, he undertook that office at the request of the trustees, his appointment being formally approved in September. Although his father-in-law was doubtless instrumental in securing his appointment, Cutler was in general well-fitted for the position, being &quot;an excellent Linguist&quot;, a &quot;good Logician, Geographer, and Rhetorician&quot;, while &quot;in the Philosophy &amp; Metaphysics &amp; Ethics of his Day or juvenile Education he was great. . . . He was of an high, lofty, &amp; despotic mien. He made a grand figure as the Head of a College&quot;. Cutler continued to teach the Enlightenment Curriculum first instituted by Tutor Samuel Johnson in 1716, with courses on algebra, calculus, and moral philosophy.

The new rectorship &quot;opened auspiciously and an era of prosperity seemed at hand when, on September 13, 1722, the rector, with Tutor Daniel Browne and several Congregational clergymen, met with the trustees, declared themselves doubtful of the validity of their ordination, and asked advice with regard to entering the Church of England.&quot; Upon request they made a written statement of their position, and the meeting was adjourned for a month. In the meantime Governor Saltonstall arranged a public debate on the matter, held October 16, as a result of which, on the following day, at a special meeting of the trustees, it was voted to &quot;excuse the Rev. Mr. Cutler from all further services as Rector of Yale College&quot;, and it was provided that all future rectors and tutors should declare to the trustees their assent to the Saybrook Confession of Faith, and give satisfaction as to their opposition to &quot;Arminian and prelatical corruptions.&quot; They returned Yale to its previous orthodoxy, what the former Yale Tutor, the American Dr. Samuel Johnson in 1770 described as &quot;the scholastic cobwebs of a few little English and Dutch systems that would hardly now be taken up in the street.”

Several nineteenth century Harvard and Yale commentators, citing Cutler&#x27;s Puritan opponents, suggest that Cutler was never wholeheartedly a Dissenter, that he had been converted to Episcopalianism when at Stratford by John Checkley, and that in spite of this fact had accepted the rectorship of a Congregational college, publicly declaring what he had privately believed only when a desirable place in the Established Church was assured him. With the 1929 publication of American Dr. Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography&quot;, we find that Cutler, Yale Tutor Daniel Brown, and seven other local clergy formed a study group in 1719. Assigning Johnson to translate, and meeting in secret at each other&#x27;s homes, they carefully studied the source texts in Yale&#x27;s library in the original languages over a three-year period. They only reluctantly decided that their Presbyterian ordination was questionable, and that an Episcopal ordination was to be preferred. Despite great pressure from Governor Saltenstall, their family, friends and the Puritan community (so fierce, that five of the nine recanted), Cutler, along with three others, determined to become ministers of the Church of England.

==Later life==
During a yearlong visit to London, Cutler was ordained by the Bishop of Norwich in March 1723. He also received the degree of D.D. from both Oxford University and the University of Cambridge, the first American-born clergyman to receive a Doctorate. Cutler became rector of the newly formed Christ Church, Boston, where he served until his death. Cutler became one of the leading Episcopal clergymen of New England, venerated for his learning, but perhaps too haughty in manner to be popular. He founded the church at Dedham and took care of Christ Church, Braintree.

Puritans, however, dominated Boston. Massachusetts leaned toward a theocracy under Cotton Mather, who defended the conviction of witches on spectral evidence, and Harvard taught a pre-Enlightenment curriculum over 100 years old. While Cutler was away on his ordination trip, Boston&#x27;s elite had jailed printer James Franklin of the &quot;New England Currant&quot; for political attacks, and fined his publisher John Checkley for printing Episcopal books. As the leading Anglican in Massachusetts, Cutler defended the rights of his fellow believers, standing against the Church, State, College theocracy of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He pushed for the emancipation of his church members from the church tax imposed by the Puritan theocracy. He started a library of Anglican books in his church. With Rev. Samuel Myles of King&#x27;s Chapel he laid claim to a seat on the Board of Overseers of Harvard, as a minister of the Episcopal Church in Boston, maintaining that he was a &quot;teaching elder&quot; as required by the college charter. Unsurprisingly, both the Overseers and General Court decided against him. Cutler urged a bishop be appointed for the American colonies. He published four sermons, two preached before the Connecticut General Assembly (on May 9, 1717, and October 18, 1719) - a singular honor in the Standing Order of the Puritan Connecticut government - and two while he was Rector of Christ Church, Boston.

==Theology==
In 1723 Timothy Cutler and others shocked the community of the Yale College by leaving Congregationalism for Anglicanism. The theological issues in dispute related principally to church governance. Besides, the move into Anglicanism involved an embrace of Arminian teachings on salvation as well.

<doc id="741215" wikidata="Q3778295" url="?curid=741215" title="Gerard Brennan">
<text>Sir Francis Gerard Brennan (22 May 1928 – 1 June 2022) was an Australian lawyer and jurist who served as the 10th Chief Justice of Australia. As a judge in the High Court of Australia, he wrote the lead judgement on the Mabo decision, which gave rise to the Native Title Act.

==Early life and education==
Brennan was born on 22 May 1928, in Rockhampton, Queensland. He was the son of Frank Tenison Brennan, a Labor Party politician, lawyer and judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland. He was raised as, and continued to be, a Catholic and has said: &quot;Egalitarianism, tolerance and the respect for conscience are the practical manifestations of faith, hope and charity.&quot;

==Career==
Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser appointed Brennan to the court in 1981. As a High Court judge, Brennan wrote the lead judgement on the Mabo decision, which overturned the doctrine of &quot;terra nullius&quot; used to justify the Crown&#x27;s sovereignty over Australia, replacing it with the doctrine of native title, and thus protecting Aboriginal people&#x27;s claims to land. This decision eventually gave rise to the Native Title Act. Brennan is also notable for his landmark judgement in &quot;Waltons v Maher&quot;, which established equitable estoppel as a cause of action in itself.

He was appointed by prime minister Paul Keating to become the 10th Chief Justice of Australia in 1995.

==After retirement==
Following his retirement from the High Court, Brennan was a non-permanent judge of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (2000-2012) and an external judge of the Supreme Court of Fiji (1999–2000), chancellor of the University of Technology Sydney (1998–2004) and Foundation Scientia Professor of Law at the University of New South Wales (1998). He was an honorary visiting professor of law at the University of New South Wales.

In a 2001 exchange of letters with Archbishop George Pell, he defended the primacy of conscience over obedience to authority.

In June 2021, Brennan intervened in a public debate over a family of asylum seekers, supporting the family with a letter in major newspapers. It begins:
:Are other Australians ashamed, as I am? How can Australia, proud of our freedoms, respectful of all our peoples, and insistent on human dignity, inflict cruelty on Australian children as a means of achieving a goal of government policy?

==Personal life and death==
In 1953, Brennan married Patricia O&#x27;Hara. Lady Brennan died on 3 September 2019. Their first child, Frank Brennan, born in 1954, became a Jesuit priest, a human rights lawyer and an advocate for the rights of Aboriginal peoples. He is known for his involvement in the Wik debate when Paul Keating referred to him as &quot;the meddling priest&quot;. Their second child, Madeline Brennan KC, is a barrister in Brisbane and has served as a director of a number of Catholic health and education providers. Their third child Dr Anne Brennan is a psychiatrist who came to prominence in the Barrett Adolescent Centre Commission of Inquiry. Their fourth child Tom Brennan SC is a barrister in Sydney. A son Paul was CEO of Polynovo Ltd an ASX listed biotechnology manufacturer until his resignation in 2021. A daughter, Bernadette, is the author of renowned literary biographies &quot;This Writing Life: Helen Garner and her Work&quot;; and &quot;Leaping into Waterfalls: The Enigmatic Gillian Mears.&quot;

Brennan died on 1 June 2022 in Sydney, aged 94, two days before Mabo Day and the 30th anniversary of the Mabo decision.

==Honours==
In 1981, Brennan was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire and, in 1988, appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in recognition of his service to the law.

Brennan was awarded honorary degrees by the University of Melbourne (Hon. LL.D.), the University of Technology, Sydney (Hon. LL.D.), the University of Queensland (Hon. LL.D.), Griffith University (Hon. D.Univ.), Central Queensland University (Hon. D.Litt.), Trinity College Dublin (Hon. LL.D.) and the Australian Catholic University (Hon LL.D). He was a life fellow of the Australian Academy of Law. He served as chancellor of the University of Technology, Sydney, from 1998 to 2004.

In 2013, Brennan was awarded the Gold Bauhinia Star by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong.

<text>Robert Cutler (June 12, 1895 – May 8, 1974) was an American government official who was the first person appointed as the president&#x27;s National Security Advisor. He served US President Dwight Eisenhower in that role between 1953 and 1955 and from 1957 to 1958.

==Early life==
He was born on June 12, 1895, in Brookline, Massachusetts. He was the youngest of five sons born to George C. and Mary F. Wilson Cutler. His brothers were Elliott Carr Cutler, a professor at the Harvard Medical School and a surgeon, Harvard quarterback Johnny Cutler, Roger W. Cutler, a US Navy officer and the husband of Leslie Bradley Cutler, and George C. Cutler Jr.

Cutler attended Harvard College and planned on becoming an English teacher and writer. He was class poet, wrote the baccalaureate hymn, and graduated second in his class in 1916. After graduating, he taught at Harvard and Radcliffe College and authored two novels: &quot;Louisburg Square&quot; (1917) and &quot;The Speckled Bird&quot; (1923).

During World War I, he volunteered with the American Expeditionary Forces. He served in France as a first lieutenant with the 76th Division. After the war, he spent eight, months as an adjutant of the 3rd Army Military Police with the Army of Occupation. In 1922, he graduated from Harvard Law School.

==Early career==
After graduating from Harvard Law School, Cutler went to work for the firm of Herrick, Smith, Donald &amp; Farley. He also served as treasurer of Peter Bent Brigham Hospital and as president of Community Chests and Councils, Inc., chairman of the 1937 Greater Boston Community Fund Drive and was a director of the Saco-Lowell Shops and the Old Colony Trust Company.

On October 25, 1940, Cutler was appointed corporation counsel for the city of Boston by Mayor Maurice J. Tobin.

==World War II==
On July 28, 1942, Cutler resigned as corporation counsel to join the US Army. US President Franklin Roosevelt nominated Cutler for the position of head occupational analyst of the Army Specialist Corps (ASC) with the rank of colonel. After the ASC had been disbanded, Cutler served as chief of the Procurement Division. During the 1944 presidential election, he served as executive officer of the War Ballot Commission. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal in December 1944.

In 1945, he worked on special assignments for US Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and the US Army Chief of Staff George Marshall. In October, he was promoted to brigadier general and was awarded the Legion of Merit for &quot;his foresight and careful planning, consummate tact, unusual ability and vigor&quot; during his service with the Legislative and Liaison Division of the War Department Special Staff. He received his discharge on December 9, 1945.

==Postwar career==
On January 9, 1946, Cutler succeeded Channing H. Cox as president of the Old Colony Trust Company. He was later elected president of Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. From 1947 to 1949, he headed the largest survey of hospital, health, and welfare facilities in New England.

==1952 presidential campaign==
In 1952, Cutler served as Eisenhower&#x27;s personal secretary on the campaign train, a position that had him perform a number of tasks, including speechwriting and advising. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; described Cutler as &quot;emerging as the right-hand man of the General&quot; and &quot;probably closer to the candidate in a personal sense than Gov. Sherman Adams, who is generally regard as top man.&quot;

==National Security Advisor==
On December 29, 1952, President-elect Eisenhower appointed Cutler as assistant to the president for national security affairs. In that position, Cutler played a major role in turning the National Security Council into a top policy making body. He tendered his resignation on March 8, 1955, and was succeeded by Dillon Anderson on April 1. On March 31, 1955, he received the Medal of Freedom for his &quot;outstanding contribution to the security and defense of our nation.

Cutler oversaw the drafting of Eisenhower&#x27;s Executive Order 10450, signed on April 27, 1953, contributing language that identified &quot;sexual perversion&quot; as grounds for exclusion from employment by the federal government. It represented an attempt to fulfill Eisenhower&#x27;s campaign promise, made in response to charges made by Senator Joseph McCarthy, to remove &quot;subversives&quot; from the federal government. The order initiated the years-long purge of gays and lesbians from employment by the federal government, the Lavender Scare component of the Red Scare witch hunts of the 1950s.

Cutler resigned his post in 1955 apparently for fear that the disclosure of his secret homosexuality might harm the Eisenhower administration. His homosexuality was known to some Washington insiders, including the prominent columnist Joseph Alsop, a closet gay himself, and Charles Bohlen, whose nomination as ambassador to Moscow had been threatened by McCarthy&#x27;s innuendo about his sexuality.

In May 1955, Cutler returned to the National Security Council as a part-time consultant and took its leadership position, then called the Special Assistant for National Security Affairs, on January 6, 1957. He was succeeded by Gordon Gray on June 24, 1958.

==Later life==
In 1958, Cutler was nominated for a seat on the Massachusetts Board of Regional Community Colleges by Governor Foster Furcolo. His nomination was rejected by the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council by a 4–3 vote on the grounds that the position should go to a Democrat. Furcolo submitted Cutler&#x27;s nomination again, and on December 30, the Council approved his appointment by a 6–2 vote.

On October 14, 1959, Eisenhower announced that he would nominate Cutler to serve a three-year term as an executive director of the new Inter-American Development Bank. He was sworn in by Eisenhower on February 2, 1960. He resigned effective July 15, 1962.

He published his memoirs, &quot;No Time for Rest&quot;, in 1966.

He died on May 8, 1974, in Concord, Massachusetts. Never married and predeceased by all of his brothers, Cutler left no immediate survivors but was survived by several nieces and nephews, including Elliott C. Cutler Jr., Robert B. Cutler and Roger W. Cutler Jr.

<text>129 Antigone is a large main-belt asteroid. Radar observations indicate that it is composed of almost pure nickel-iron. It and other similar asteroids probably originate from the core of a shattered Vesta-like planetesimal which had a differentiated interior. It was discovered by German-American astronomer C. H. F. Peters on February 5, 1873, and named after Antigone, the Theban princess in Greek mythology.

In 1979 a possible satellite of Antigone was suggested based on lightcurve data. A model constructed from these shows Antigone itself to be quite regularly shaped. In 1990, the asteroid was observed from the Collurania-Teramo Observatory, allowing a composite light curve to be produced that showed a rotation period of 4.9572 ± 0.0001 hours and a brightness variation of 0.34 ± 0.01 in magnitude. The ratio of the lengths of the major to minor axes for this asteroid were found to be 1.45 ±0.02.

10μ radiometric data collected from Kitt Peak in 1975 gave a diameter estimate of 114 km. Since 1985, a total of three stellar occultations by Antigone have been observed. A favorable occultation of a star on April 11, 1985, was observed from sites near Pueblo, Colorado, allowing a diameter estimate of 113.0 ± 4.2 km to be calculated.

<doc id="741225" wikidata="Q1277424" url="?curid=741225" title="Earl of Tyrone">
<text>The Earl of Tyrone is a title created three times in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created for the final time in 1746 for Marcus Beresford, 1st Viscount Tyrone, son-in-law of the last de Poer earls. His son was created Marquess of Waterford in 1789, and the title has since been a subsidiary title of the Waterford title.

It was first created as part of the Tudor attempt to establish a uniform social structure in Ireland by converting the Gaelic kings and chiefs into hereditary nobles of the Kingdom of Ireland. Under brehon law, clans were effectively independent, and chose their chiefs from the members of a bloodline – normally, but not always, a close relative of the previous chief; the clan as a whole generally had a voice in the chief&#x27;s decisions. Also, acknowledged sons of a clan member were members of the bloodline, even when not begotten in lawful marriage. The holder of a title, on the other hand, was subject to the Crown, but held his lands by hereditary right, which the Crown would help to enforce; the rest of the clan were usually now his tenants. Illegitimate sons had no right of succession under the new system unless expressly granted.

The title in the Peerage of Ireland was created again in 1673 for Richard Power, 6th Baron Power, the Anglo-Norman peer and Restoration politician, along with a large grant of land in County Waterford, at the other end of Ireland. He was also given the subordinate title of Viscount Decies; both titles became extinct upon the death of his younger son, the third earl, in 1704; he left an only daughter, Lady Katherine Power, but both titles descended by patent to male heirs only.

==Earls of Tyrone, first creation (1542)==
The king and chief of the O&#x27;Neills of Tyrone, Conn Bacach O&#x27;Neill, went to Greenwich and submitted to Henry VIII of England and of Ireland in 1542; he renounced the style of &quot;The O&#x27;Neill&quot; and his independent rule. In exchange, he was created Earl of Tyrone, which was by the charter to descend to his illegitimate son Matthew or Ferdoragh O&#x27;Neill, who was also created Baron of Dungannon, which was always to be held by the heir to the Earldom; this was a substantive title, which gave Ferdoragh a seat in the Irish House of Lords, not a courtesy title. This adaptive process, known as &quot;surrender and regrant&quot;, was taken up by other Irish clan chiefs.

This passed over Conn&#x27;s legitimate sons; the eldest, Shane O&#x27;Neill, was only about twelve at the time. When he grew up, Shane (who is remembered as , or &quot;Shane the Proud&quot;) drove his father out of Ulster, and was inaugurated The O&#x27;Neill (in Irish: &quot;Uí Neíll&quot;). There was civil strife among the Cenell Eoghain; Shane was victorious, Ferdoragh was killed, Conn was permanently driven out of Tyrone, and died in the Irish Pale in 1559, the area of Ireland directly governed by the English.

In English law, Ferdoragh&#x27;s eldest son, Brian O&#x27;Neill, then succeeded to the Earldom; in practice he continued to be called Lord Dungannon. Queen Elizabeth I, newly come to the throne, proposed to recognize Shane as Earl, since he actually ruled Tyrone and was the eldest legitimate son; but the negotiations collapsed. Brian was killed in 1562, while still young and unmarried, by his cousin Turlough O&#x27;Neill, the tanist of his uncle Shane (and a grandson of the brother of Conn Bacagh, the first Earl). Shane died in June 1567, whereupon the English generally supported Brian&#x27;s younger brother Hugh O&#x27;Neill against Turlough Linneach O&#x27;Neill. But Turlough was inaugurated The O&#x27;Neill Mor and as leader of the clan, was perceived to be the greater threat to English control of Ireland. In 1585, Hugh was recognized as Earl of Tyrone. In 1593, Turlough surrendered to him the position of &quot;The O&#x27;Neill&quot; to the Earl and retired.

Hugh O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s career as unquestioned leader of the O&#x27;Neills became a series of quarrels with the English government: like many great feudal lords, he rebelled in the Nine Years&#x27; War, was proclaimed a traitor, and ultimately submitted to the Crown at the Treaty of Mellifont in 1603. Despite the Anglo-Spanish peace treaty of 1604, in 1607 O&#x27;Neill, his brother-in-law the Earl of Tyrconnell, and several of their followers fled to Europe, expecting the Spanish to invade Ireland with an army. He was found guilty of treason the year after this Flight of the Earls. The attainder was confirmed by the Parliament of Ireland in 1614; at which point the Earldom became forfeit under the common law.

Notwithstanding this attaintment, Earl Hugh, followed by his sons, continued to claim to be Earl of Tyrone, through its recognition by the Pope and the King of Spain, until the last legitimate grandson died unmarried, in 1692. Irish marriage practices at the time allowed for a political divorce, but all children were considered legitimate by the Irish: Hugh was married four times. Historians have stated that at this point the Irish title became extinct, as well as forfeit; however, that is by English law of descent. Gaelic law allowed for chiefships and property to descend through tanistry, and thus the descendants of Earl Hugh&#x27;s brothers acted as The O&#x27;Neills of Tyrone, and called themselves Earl of Tyrone by Spanish grant, for the rest of the century. At that point, the chiefship and property transferred to the O&#x27;Neill of Tyrone existent back in Ireland through the descendants of Prince Shane O&#x27;Neill.

:&quot;Heirs who did not live to succeed are indented.&quot;
*Conn O&#x27;Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone(–1559)
**Matthew O&#x27;Neill, 1st Baron Dungannon (–1550)
*Brian O&#x27;Neill, Baron Dungannon, 2nd Baron Dungannon (–1562)
*Hugh O&#x27;Neill 3rd Baron Dungannon, 2nd or 3rd Earl of Tyrone. (–1616) attainted 1608, attainder confirmed by Irish Parliament 1614.
**Hugh O&#x27;Neill, 4th Baron Dungannon (–1609) attainted 1608.

===Baron Dungannon===

The Barony of Dungannon created for Matthew or Ferdoragh O&#x27;Neill was limited, by the terms of the patent, to his descendants who were heirs apparent to the Earldom of Tyrone. This provision would have meant that it acted like a courtesy title: when an Earl of Tyrone had an eldest son, or an eldest grandson by a deceased eldest son, that heir would be Baron Dungannon; when there was no heir apparent, the Barony of Dungannon lapsed until there was.

So when Matthew died, his son Brian became Baron Dungannon. However, when Conn Bacach died the next year, Brien was not recognized as Earl of Tyrone, but continued to be called Baron Dungannon until he was killed by Turlough Luineach O&#x27;Neill, Shane O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s tanist.

His younger brother Hugh O&#x27;Neill was called Baron of Dungannon until 1585, when he received a charter confirming him as Earl of Tyrone. The same charter confirmed his son Hugh, the eldest son of his second wife, as Baron Dungannon; Earl Hugh&#x27;s first marriage was invalid, and his children by that marriage illegitimate.

The following men were known as Baron Dungannon:
*Matthew O&#x27;Neill, 1st Baron Dungannon, (before 16241558), cr. 1542.
*Brian O&#x27;Neill, Baron Dungannon (died 1562), &quot;de jure&quot; Baron Dungannon 1558–9, styled Dungannon 1558–1562.
*Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, (died 1616) styled Baron Dungannon 1562–1585, never &quot;de jure&quot;: before his brother&#x27;s death, he was not heir apparent, for his brother could have married and had sons; after his brother&#x27;s death, he was &quot;de jure&quot; Earl of Tyrone, but not Baron Dugannon by the limitation.
*Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Baron Dungannon, (1609), styled Baron Dungannon, 1587–1608, &quot;de jure&quot; from birth. Title forfeit 1608.

Since the younger Hugh O&#x27;Neill was attainted with father in 1608, the title is forfeit, and is now extinct. Young Hugh went to Rome with his father, and died there in the summer of 1609.

===Exiles===
Earl Hugh and his family continued to lead the O&#x27;Neills of Tyrone from abroad; they also had the title of Earl of Tyrone recognized in Spain in the form of Conde de Tyrone. &quot;Though no longer recognized in England, it was granted by Spanish kings to a line of O&#x27;Neills in rightful succession to the end of the seventeenth century&quot;.

*Hugh O&#x27;Neill (–1616), the attainted Earl.
*Henry O&#x27;Neill (–1610) Earl Hugh&#x27;s son by Joan O&#x27;Donnell, his second wife; Colonel of the Irish regiment in the Spanish service in Flanders; Knight of Santiago. Accompanied his father in his flight, and was attainted 1608, confirmed 1614. He is omitted from an account of his father&#x27;s family in 1617; he is noted as dead in 1621
*Shane O&#x27;Neill (&quot;Juan&quot;, &quot;John&quot;, &quot;Sean&quot;: 18 October 159927 Jan 1641), Earl Hugh&#x27;s son by Catherine Magenis, his fourth wife. Succeeded his father as Earl of Tyrone, his brother as Colonel; Knight of Calatrava; Major Domo at Madrid, 1638; died in the siege of Barcelona. He was created the Viscount of Montjuich by the King of Spain upon his death. 
**His younger brothers died young: Conn (–1627) was left behind in the flight, went to Eton, and died in the Tower of London; Brian (1604–1617) went to school in Brussels and was killed there, being found hanged with his hands bound.
* Hugo Eugenio O&#x27;Neill, his son, was legitimated at Shane&#x27;s death by Philip IV of Spain but died young. Shane&#x27;s will provided that Hugo Eugenio be taught Irish, so he could be an effective leader of the O&#x27;Neills; it also provided an elaborate system of succession if Hugo Eugenio died childless, as did happen.
**Conn O&#x27;Neill (&quot;Con&quot;, &quot;Constantino&quot;, died before 1660), son of Cormac O&#x27;Neill, the younger brother of Earl Hugh who died in the Tower of London, was named as second heir in Shane O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s will, if Hugo Eugenio died childless; by the law of the Kingdom of Ireland, he would be the next heir to the Earldom, if restored. Since he died before Hugo Eugenio, he does not appear to have called himself Earl, but Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill, Earl Hugh&#x27;s half-nephew and a general in the War of the Three Kingdoms, acknowledged &quot;that all the immediate right to the earldom of Tyrone belongs to Don Constantino, who is in Spain&quot; and that while he lived, Owen Roe himself &quot;could claim nothing&quot;.

By 1660, therefore, the Earldom of Tyrone was forfeit by English standards. Nonetheless, by Spanish and Irish standards the collateral O&#x27;Neill descendants of Mathew &quot;Ferdocha&quot; O&#x27;Neill, were allowed to use the title in Spain until 1692. At that point, it went to the senior member of the descendants of Prince Shane O&#x27;Neill, the half brother of Mathew &quot;Ferdocha&quot; O&#x27;Neill. 
*Hugh Dubh O&#x27;Neill, (), nephew of Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill (by his brother Art Oge) and so grandnephew of Earl Hugh, and commander under his uncle in Ireland, where he held Limerick against Henry Ireton during a long siege. Petitioned Charles II in October 1660, after the English Restoration, to be restored to the Earldom of Tyrone.
*Hugh O&#x27;Neill (after 1644), grandson of Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill by his son Henry Roe O&#x27;Neill. Knight of Calatrava 1667.
*Owen O&#x27;Neill, grandnephew of Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill, whose younger brother Con had a son Brian, father of this Owen. Educated at Rome; executor of a will 1679, died after 1689. After Owen, no-one claimed the Earldom of Tyrone until the 19th century.
*Don Bernardo O&#x27;Neill, (1681), colonel of the Irish regiment of Tyrone, nephew of General Eoghan Roe. Born in Armagh, served as a captain in Flanders starting in 1636. Fought in the War of the Confederacy, returned to Flanders and was given permission to raise and Irish regiment in 1663. In 1673, &quot;became Earl of Tyrone after the death of Hugo, son of Henry mac Eoghain Rua&quot;. Died 1681 in Barcelona.
*Eugenio O&#x27;Neill, after the death of Don Bernardo in 1681, &quot;the titular colonel was the eighth Earl, a young boy also called Eugenio O&#x27;Neill&quot;, he was claimed as a grandson of General Eoghan Rua through a son named Brian. He was still a minor and titulary colonel of the Regiment of Tyrone on 18 April 1689.

===Later claimants===
By this point, the claim to the Earldom of Tyrone became intertwined both with the position of the O&#x27;Neill of Tyrone and the wider position of chief of all the O&#x27;Neills of Ulster. Not all the claimants to the Gaelic offices claimed the Earldom: the descendants of Shane the Proud were inaugurated as the O&#x27;Neill by the ancient ritual, by which the O&#x27;Hagan put golden shoes on their feet on May Eve, without calling themselves Earls. In fact, Don Constantino or Conn McShane O&#x27;Neill went to Spain in 1681 to claim the chiefship and regiment from the King of Spain, upon the death of his cousin, Don Bernardo. He carried proofs of his senior descent from Prince Shane O&#x27;Neill, but was late to arrive. In the meantime, the King granted the estates to the minor Eugene O&#x27;Neill. This Conn went back to Ireland and was a senior member of the Jacobite O&#x27;Neills in the Williamite War.

The leadership of the O&#x27;Neills as a whole had usually been held by the O&#x27;Neills of Tyrone; but their distant cousins the O&#x27;Neills of Clanaboy or Clandeboye in Antrim had also sometimes held it, most recently Art mac Aodha O&#x27;Neill, from 1509 to 1514, when the first Earl was young. They, like the O&#x27;Neills of Tyrone, spent much of the seventeenth century fighting for the Catholic powers; in 1740 they relocated permanently to Portugal.

Don Jorge O&#x27;Neill of Clanaboy and Lisbon submitted his pedigree to the Ulster office of Heralds; in 1895 the genealogy and arms were confirmed. 1903 he received a patent from Sir Henry Farnham Burke, Somerset Herald, acknowledging that he had proved his royal descent from the Kings of Ireland, and his collateral descent from Hugh O&#x27;Neill, and thus was the representative of the Earldom and the senior member of the Royal family of O&#x27;Neill of Ulster. Although collateral descent from the grantee does not confer a peerage, he assumed the style of Conde de Tyrone, but his descendants use the title Prince of Clandeboye. Queen Victoria&#x27;s recognition was followed by those of the Pope, the kings of Spain and Portugal, and the Republic of Ireland in 1945 as the Prince of Clandeboye.

<text>The Rivals is a comedy of manners by Richard Brinsley Sheridan in five acts which was first performed at Covent Garden Theatre on 17 January 1775. The story has been updated frequently, including a 1935 musical and a 1958 episode of the TV series &quot;Maverick&quot; (see below) starring James Garner and Roger Moore, with attribution.

== History ==
=== Production ===
&quot;The Rivals&quot; was Sheridan&#x27;s first play. At the time, he was a young newlywed living in Bath. At Sheridan&#x27;s insistence, upon marriage his wife Eliza (born Elizabeth Linley) had given up her career as a singer. This was proper for a gentleman&#x27;s wife, but it was difficult because Eliza would have earned a substantial income as a performer. Instead, the Sheridans lived beyond their means as they entertained the gentry and nobility with Eliza&#x27;s singing (in private parties) and Richard&#x27;s wit. Finally, in need of funds, Richard turned to the only craft that could gain him the remuneration he desired in a short time: he began writing a play. Over the years, he had written and published essays and poems, and among his papers were numerous unfinished plays, essays and political tracts, but never had he undertaken such an ambitious project as this. In a short time, however, he completed &quot;The Rivals&quot;.

=== Reception ===
&quot;The Rivals&quot; was first performed at Covent Garden, London, on 17 January 1775, with comedian Mary Bulkley as Julia Melville. It was roundly vilified by both the public and the critics for its length, for its bawdiness and for the character of Sir Lucius O&#x27;Trigger being a meanly written role played very badly. The actor, John Lee, after being hit with an apple during the performance, stopped and addressed the audience, asking &quot;By the pow&#x27;rs, is it &quot;personal&quot;? — is it me, or the matter?&quot; Apparently, it was both. Sheridan immediately withdrew the play and in the next 11 days, rewrote the original (the Larpent manuscript) extensively, including a new preface in which he allowed:
For my own part, I see no reason why the author of a play should not regard a first night&#x27;s audience as a candid and judicious friend attending, in behalf of the public, at his last rehearsal. If he can dispense with flattery, he is sure at least of sincerity, and even though the annotation be rude, he may rely upon the justness of the comment.
Sheridan also apologised for any impression that O&#x27;Trigger was intended as an insult to Ireland. Rewritten and with a new actor, Laurence Clinch, in the role of O&#x27;Trigger, the play reopened on 28 January to significant acclaim. Indeed, it became a favourite of the royal family, receiving five command performances in ten years, and also in the Colonies (it was George Washington&#x27;s favourite play). It became a standard show in the repertoires of 19th-century companies in England and the US.

The play is now considered to be one of Sheridan&#x27;s masterpieces, and the term was coined in reference to one of the characters in the play. She was first played by Jane Green.

==Characters==

* Sir Anthony Absolute, a wealthy baronet
* Captain Jack Absolute, his son, disguised as Ensign Beverley
* Faulkland, friend of Jack Absolute
* Bob Acres, friend of Jack Absolute
* Sir Lucius O&#x27;Trigger, an Irish baronet
* Fag, Captain Absolute&#x27;s servant
* David, Bob Acres&#x27; servant
* Thomas, Sir Anthony&#x27;s servant
* Lydia Languish, a wealthy teenaged heiress, in love with &quot;Ensign Beverley&quot;
* Mrs. Malaprop, Lydia&#x27;s middle-aged guardian
* Julia Melville, a young relation of the Absolutes, in love with Faulkland
* Lucy, Lydia&#x27;s conniving maid

== Plot ==
The play is set in 18th-century Bath, a town that was legendary for conspicuous consumption and fashion at the time. Wealthy, fashionable people went there to &quot;take the waters&quot;, which were believed to have healing properties. Bath society was much less exclusive than London, and hence it provides an ideal setting for the characters.

The plot centres on the two young lovers, Lydia and Jack. Lydia, who reads a lot of popular novels of the time, wants a purely romantic love affair. To court her, Jack pretends to be &quot;Ensign Beverley&quot;, a poor army officer. Lydia is enthralled with the idea of eloping with a poor soldier in spite of the objections of her guardian, Mrs. Malaprop, a moralistic widow. Mrs. Malaprop is the chief comic figure of the play, thanks to her continual misuse of words that &quot;sound&quot; like the words she intends to use, but &quot;mean&quot; something completely different (the term &quot;&quot; was coined in reference to the character).

Lydia has two other suitors: Bob Acres (a somewhat buffoonish country gentleman), and Sir Lucius O&#x27;Trigger, an impoverished and combative Irish gentleman. Sir Lucius pays Lucy to carry love notes between him and Lydia (who uses the name &quot;Delia&quot;), but Lucy is swindling him: &quot;Delia&quot; is actually Mrs. Malaprop.

As the play opens, Sir Anthony arrives suddenly in Bath. He has arranged a marriage for Jack, but Jack demurs, saying he is in love already. They quarrel violently. But Jack soon learns through the gossip of Lucy and Fag that the marriage arranged by Sir Anthony is, in fact, with Lydia. He makes a great show of submission to his father, and is presented to Lydia with Mrs. Malaprop&#x27;s blessing. Jack confides to Lydia that he is only posing as Sir Anthony&#x27;s son. She annoys Mrs. Malaprop by loudly professing her eternal devotion to &quot;Beverley&quot; while rejecting &quot;Jack Absolute&quot;.

Jack&#x27;s friend Faulkland is in love with Julia, but he suffers from jealous suspicion. He is constantly fretting himself about her fidelity. Faulkland and Julia quarrel foolishly, making elaborate and high-flown speeches about true love that satirise the romantic dramas of the period.

Bob Acres tells Sir Lucius that another man (&quot;Beverley&quot;) is courting the lady of Acres&#x27; choice (Lydia, though Sir Lucius does not know this). Sir Lucius immediately declares that Acres must challenge &quot;Beverley&quot; to a duel and kill him. Acres goes along, and writes out a challenge note – despite his own rather more pacifist feelings, and the profound misgivings of his servant David. Sir Lucius leaves, Jack arrives, and Acres tells him of his intent. Jack agrees to deliver the note to &quot;Beverley&quot;, but declines to be Acres&#x27; second.

Mrs. Malaprop again presents Jack to Lydia, but this time with Sir Anthony present, exposing Jack&#x27;s pose as &quot;Beverley&quot;. Lydia is enraged by the puncturing of her romantic dreams, and spurns Jack contemptuously.

Sir Lucius has also learned of the proposed marriage of Jack and Lydia, and determines to challenge Jack. He meets Jack, who, smarting from Lydia&#x27;s rejection, agrees to fight him without even knowing the reason. They will meet at the same time as Acres is scheduled to fight &quot;Beverley&quot;.

At the duelling ground, Acres is very reluctant to fight, but Sir Lucius will have no shirking. Jack and Faulkland arrive. Acres learns that &quot;Beverley&quot; is actually his friend Jack, and begs off from their duel. However, Jack is quite willing to fight Sir Lucius, and they cross swords.

David informs Mrs. Malaprop, Lydia, Julia, and Sir Anthony of the duel, and they all rush off to stop it. Sir Lucius explains the cause of his challenge, but Lydia denies any connection to him, and admits her love for Jack. Mrs. Malaprop announces that &quot;she&quot; is Delia, but Sir Lucius recoils in horror, realising that he has been hoaxed. Sir Anthony consoles Mrs. Malaprop, Julia is reconciled to Faulkland, and Acres invites everyone to a party.

== Adaptations ==

=== Musical (1935) ===

A successful musical production - titled &quot;Rivals!&quot;, with songs by Herbert Hughes and lyrics by John Robert Monsell - was staged by Vladimir Rosing at London&#x27;s Kingsway Theatre in October 1935. The musical ran for 86 performances.Queen Mary attended one of the performances.

=== &quot;Maverick&quot; television adaptation (1958) ===
The play was rewritten as a 1958 episode of the comedic Western television series &quot;Maverick&quot;, starring the remarkably similar-looking James Garner and Roger Moore, and was the only episode of the series in which Garner and Moore appeared together (Moore did not portray &quot;Beau Maverick,&quot; Bret Maverick&#x27;s cousin, until after Garner had left the series two seasons later). The Absolutes were renamed &quot;Vandergelt&quot; with Neil Hamilton as the wealthy father. Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; Crowley plays the leading lady, whose name is changed from the original play&#x27;s &quot;Lydia Languish&quot; to &quot;Lydia Lynley.&quot; The episode, telecast midway through the series&#x27; second season, was called &quot;The Rivals&quot; and the playwright Sheridan was given due credit.

===Radio productions===
In 1962, a radio production by R. D. Smith for the BBC Third Programme featured Fay Compton as Mrs Malaprop, Baliol Holloway as Sir Anthony Absolute, Fenella Fielding as Lydia Languish, Hugh Burden as Captain Absolute and John Hollis as Thomas. It was repeated on 23 December 1963 on the Home Service as part of the &quot;National Theatre of the Air&quot; series.

In 1968, a radio production with Flora Robson as Mrs Malaprop was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 as part of a &quot;Flora Robson Festival&quot;.

=== Additional television productions ===
The play was adapted for Australian television in 1961.

The BBC produced a version which was broadcast in 1970 as part of their &quot;Play of the Month&quot; series, starring Jeremy Brett as Captain Jack Absolute. Another BBC production was broadcast in 1989 as part of their &quot;Theatre Night&quot; series, starring Donald Sinden as Sir Anthony Absolute.

=== Jack Absolute novels (2003–2006) ===
The leading character of the play was taken to be the identity of the hero of a series of historic fictional adventure books by actor/novelist Chris Humphreys. These take place in Cornwall, London, Quebec, the American colonies during both the Seven Years&#x27; War and the American Revolution, and Portugal.

=== &quot;Jack Absolute Flies Again&quot; ===

A new adaptation written by Richard Bean and Oliver Chris titled &quot;Jack Absolute Flies Again&quot; was due to premiere at the National Theatre, London in April 2020, however due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the production eventually opened on 15 July 2022. The play has been updated to July 1940 to coincide with the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.

<doc id="741232" wikidata="Q427464" url="?curid=741232" title="Jack Sharkey">
<text>Jack Sharkey (born Joseph Paul Zukauskas, , October 26, 1902 – August 17, 1994) was a Lithuanian-American boxer who held the NYSAC, NBA, and &quot;The Ring&quot; heavyweight titles from 1932 to 1933.

==Boxing career==
He took his ring name from his two idols, heavyweight contender Tom Sharkey and heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, to gain acceptance in the Irish-dominated boxing world of Boston. He won an important fight in 1926 over black heavyweight contender Harry Wills, but his first big year was 1927, when he defeated former light heavyweight champ Mike McTigue in twelve rounds and Boston rival Jim Maloney in five. That put him in the ring on July 21, 1927, with his idol Dempsey, the winner to meet heavyweight champion Gene Tunney for the title. For six rounds Sharkey engaged in fierce infighting with Dempsey who had a slight lead on the scorecards. In the seventh round, Sharkey turned his head to complain to the referee about an alleged low punch and Dempsey landed a classic left hook that knocked Sharkey out.

In 1928 Sharkey fought heavyweight contender Tom Heeney to a draw and defeated former light-heavyweight champion Jack Delaney. Early in 1929, he signed in a Tex Rickard promotion to fight Young Stribling in Miami, Sharkey and all involved suffered a scare when Rickard died unexpectedly. All preparations ceased as Rickard was laid to rest in New York. Unhappy with the uncertainty of it all, Jack complained to sportswriter Dan Parker, &quot;That man isn&#x27;t in his grave yet, and already they&#x27;re trying to break my contract.&quot; In fact Bill Carey, president of Madison Square Garden saved the day by appointing Jack Dempsey himself to the task. Dempsey, a close personal friend of Rickard, had never handled a promotion before, but did so now with what might be called &quot;large and largesse&quot;. Between leasing the Carl Fisher mansion on Miami Beach as well as the George Washington Hotel, the latter of which was equipped for the press with a 24-hour bar, the Sharkey-Stribling fight at the old Flamingo Park drew 40,000 fans, including 423 writers, and did $405,000 at the box office, an amount unsurpassed in the South until television receipts for Clay vs. Liston in 1964 managed a richer gate.

A fight held in Yankee Stadium later that year gave Sharkey the United States heavyweight title when he knocked out former light heavyweight champion Tommy Loughran. This victory earned him the opportunity to fight for the vacant world title against the German contender Max Schmeling on June 12, 1930. Sharkey was disqualified in the fourth round after delivering a punch that landed below Schmeling&#x27;s belt. This was the first time in boxing history that the heavyweight championship was won on a foul since Joe Goss in 1876.

In October 1931, Sharkey defeated Italian heavyweight, Primo Carnera and was then given another chance to fight for the title. On June 21, 1932, at the Madison Square Garden Bowl in Long Island City, New York, Sharkey defeated Schmeling in a controversial split decision to win the championship. Sharkey lost the title on June 29, 1933, in his second fight with Primo Carnera. This meant that Sharkey was the first heavyweight champion in history to both win and lose the championship against a European fighter. Floyd Patterson repeated this feat when regaining the title against Ingemar Johansson, having lost it to the Swede in their first fight. Oliver McCall then became the third such heavyweight champion when he beat Lennox Lewis for the WBC title in 1994 before losing it to Lewis&#x27;s countryman Frank Bruno the following year. In recent years, with the proliferation of European-born world heavyweight champions, fighters such as Chris Byrd and Hasim Rahman have also won and lost their championships against European opposition. Sharkey&#x27;s distinction is noteworthy, however, as Schmeling and Carnera were, respectively, only the third and fourth Europeans to win the world heavyweight championship.

Later in life, Sharkey would allege that his second fights with both Schmeling and Carnera were fixed. He took a year off, fought four mediocre fights, and then fought Joe Louis on August 18, 1936, losing by knockout in the third round. This made him the only man to fight both Dempsey and Louis.

Sharkey then retired with a record of 38-14-3 with 13 knockouts. As the Cyber Boxing Zone website describes him, &quot;Sharkey had good skills, could hit with power, box well and take punishment when he set his mind to fight; But, he was an erratic, &#x27;up-and-down&#x27; boxer who never seemed to put all his skills together consistently; when he was good, he was very good but when he was bad, he was awful.&quot;

==Notable bouts refereed==
Ex-world heavyweight champion Jack Sharkey refereed the world light heavyweight title defense by Archie Moore against Yvon Durelle on December 10, 1958, at The Forum, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, one of boxing&#x27;s first championship televised bouts. Moore came off the canvas three times in the first round, and again in the fifth round, to knock out Durelle in the eleventh round. Sharkey also refereed the rematch at The Forum, in which Moore knocked down Durelle four times in the third round before knocking him out on August 12, 1959. Both bouts were world televised in black and white from Canada, with commentary and post-fight interviews.

<doc id="741238" wikidata="Q455494" url="?curid=741238" title="James J. Corbett">
<text>James John Corbett (September 1, 1866 – February 18, 1933) was an American professional boxer and a World Heavyweight Champion, best known as the only man who ever defeated John L. Sullivan (hence the &quot;man who beat the man&quot; concept of the championship boxing lineage). Despite a career spanning only 20 bouts, Corbett faced the best competition his era had to offer, squaring off with a total of nine fighters who would later be enshrined alongside him in the International Boxing Hall of Fame. 

Corbett introduced a scientific approach to boxing, in which technique and his innovative methods triumphed over brute force. He pioneered the daily boxing training routine and regimen, which was adopted by other boxers elsewhere and has survived to modern days almost intact. A &quot;big-money fighter,&quot; Corbett was one of the first athletes whose showmanship in and out of the ring was just as good as his boxing abilities. He also arguably became the first modern sports sex symbol after the film of his championship prizefight against Robert Fitzsimmons was aired worldwide, popularizing boxing immensely among the female audience. He did so in an era in which prizefighting was illegal in 21 states and was still considered among the most infamous crimes against morality.

He also pursued a career in acting, both before and after his boxing career.

==Early life==
He was a son of Patrick Corbett, who emigrated from Ballycusheen, Ballinrobe, County Mayo, Ireland in 1854. His mother was of Scottish ancestry. James Corbett graduated from Sacred Heart High School in San Francisco, California and was rumored to have a college education. He pursued a career in acting, performing at a variety of theatres, before becoming a boxer. He was also a boxing trainer. His brother, Joe Corbett, would become a Major League Baseball pitcher.

==Boxing career==
Dubbed Gentleman Jim Corbett by the media, he has been called the &quot;Father of Modern Boxing&quot; for his scientific approach and technical innovations.

===Corbett–Jackson fight – 1891===
On May 21, 1891, Corbett fought Peter &quot;Black Prince&quot; Jackson, a much-heralded bout between crosstown rivals, since they were both boxing instructors at San Francisco&#x27;s two most prestigious athletic clubs. They fought to a no-contest after 61 rounds.

The fight vaulted Corbett to national prominence and the public clamored for a contest between him and champion John L. Sullivan. Sullivan reluctantly agreed, and a fight date was set. 

===Corbett–Sullivan fight – 1892===
Corbett went into rigorous training and was confident of his chances after he sparred with Sullivan in a short exhibition match on a San Francisco stage. On September 7, 1892, at the Olympic Club in New Orleans, Louisiana, Corbett won the World Heavyweight Championship by knocking out John L. Sullivan in the 21st round. Corbett&#x27;s new scientific boxing technique enabled him to dodge Sullivan&#x27;s rushing attacks and wear him down with jabs.

Corbett did not prove to be a &quot;Fighting Champion&quot; in today&#x27;s terms, meaning he defended the title very rarely. It was an era before boxing commissions, and regulation of the sport was minimal at best. Boxing was outlawed in most states, so arranging a time and place for a bout was largely a hit-and-miss proposition. Corbett treasured his title and viewed it as the ultimate promotional tool for his two main sources of income, theatrical performances and boxing exhibitions.
In his only successful title defense on January 25, 1894, Corbett knocked out Charley Mitchell of Great Britain in three rounds. 

James Corbett also returned to his father&#x27;s native Ballinrobe in 1894, and among the highlights of his visit were the boxing demonstrations he gave in Ballinrobe Town Hall. The proceeds from the event&#x27;s entrance fees were donated for the upkeep of the parish church in Ballyovey (now Partry), County Mayo, where his uncle, Rev. James Corbett, was then parish priest. He also donated a stained glass window to the church. He coached boxing at the Olympic Club in San Francisco.

On September 7, 1894, he took part in the production of one of the first recorded boxing events, a fight with Peter Courtney. It was filmed at the Black Maria studio at West Orange, New Jersey, and was produced by William K.L. Dickson. It was only the second boxing match to be recorded.

===Fitzsimmons–Corbett fight – 1897===
in 1897 Corbett lost his Heavyweight Championship to the Cornish British boxer Bob &quot;Ruby Robert&quot; Fitzsimmons in Carson City, Nevada. Corbett was dominant for most of the fight and knocked Fitzsimmons to the canvas in the sixth round. Fitzsimmons recovered and, though badly cut, rallied from that point on. When Mrs. Fitzsimmons called out, &quot;Hit him in the slats, Bob!&quot;, where &quot;slats&quot; meant the abdominal area, her husband followed her advice. The body blows took their toll, and though Corbett continued to outbox his opponent masterfully, ringsiders could see the champion slowing down. Fitzsimmons put Corbett down in the 14th round with a withering body blow to the solar plexus, and Corbett, despite his best efforts, could not regain his feet by the end of the ten-count. The fight, lasting over an hour and a half, was released to cinemas later that year as &quot;The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight&quot;, the longest film ever released at the time.

Devastated by the loss of his title, Corbett did everything he could to lure Fitzsimmons back into the ring. He was sure Fitzsimmons&#x27;s victory was a fluke, believing he (Corbett) had over-trained, leaving him short on stamina in the later rounds. Perhaps Fitzsimmons felt the same way, for not even a $30,000 guaranteed purse posted by Corbett&#x27;s manager, William A. Brady, could get Ruby Robert back into the ring with Gentleman Jim. It may also have been Fitzsimmons&#x27;s intense personal dislike of Corbett, who had often publicly insulted him, which ruled out any chance of another fight.
This set the stage for what most boxing experts and ring historians consider to be Corbett&#x27;s finest fight. Refusing to face Corbett, Ruby Robert chose the hulking James J. Jeffries, a former sparring partner of Corbett&#x27;s and a big heavyweight even by modern standards, for his title defense.
===Corbett–Jeffries fight – 1900===
Jeffries had learned much of his trade training with Corbett and was now handled by Corbett&#x27;s old manager, William Brady. After Jeffries beat Fitzsimmons, Corbett, who had been sidelined during Fitzsimmons reign, suggested a title fight between the new champion and himself. Brady, liking Corbett and reflecting after a recent poor showing against Tom Sharkey that his old fighter had little left in the tank at age 34, agreed to the match, which was set for the Seaside Arena in Coney Island, New York.

While Jeffries went through the motions in training, Corbett prepared like a Spartan for battle. He knew, with his speed, he could out-box his larger and stronger opponent, but he was giving up size, strength, almost 30 lb. in weight and a seven-year age difference. The key, he felt, was stamina and the ability to last the 25-round fight limit.

The early rounds saw Corbett moving quickly while &quot;Big Jeff&quot; attempted body shots. However, Jeffries could not lay a glove on the &quot;Dancing Master&quot;. Round after round, Corbett had his way, darting in to land punches, then dancing away to avoid retaliation. By the 20th round, Jeffries&#x27; corner was in a panic. Manager Brady dismissed trainer Tommy Ryan from the corner and took charge himself with the simple but direct order, &quot;Knock him out or lose your title!&quot; Corbett only had to stay upright for the last five rounds to be heavyweight champion once again. Jeffries stalked Corbett around the ring, looking for an opening. Corbett danced away from any threat through the 22nd round.

Midway through the 23rd round, Corbett leaned back to avoid a blow from Jeffries, bounced off the ropes and was put on the canvas by a short right hand. He was counted out. Corbett found himself embraced by the public after this gallant effort. The adoration was short-lived, as his next fight, a five-round knockout over Kid McCoy, was widely believed to be a fix.

===Later career and life after boxing===
Corbett managed to contest for the heavyweight title one last time when he met Jeffries for a second match in San Francisco in 1903. Now 37, and with his reflexes slowing, Corbett survived a withering body blow in the second round and used every trick he knew to hang on until he was knocked out in the tenth.
Following his retirement from boxing, Corbett returned to acting, appearing in low-budget films and giving talks about pugilism. He also performed a minstrel show in skits with Cornelius J. O&#x27;Brien.

Corbett was married to Mary Olive Morris Higgins from 1886 until their divorce in 1895. He later married the actress Jessie Taylor, also known by her stage name, Vera. She survived Corbett by more than a quarter century. From 1903 until his death, Corbett lived at 221-04 Corbett Road in a three-story home in the Bayside neighborhood of the borough of Queens in New York City.

In 1924, he had a friendly sparring match with the future champion Gene Tunney, an admirer of Corbett&#x27;s scientific style. Tunney was amazed at the ability of Corbett to spar, even at the age of about 60, and claimed that Corbett had better defense than Benny Leonard.

==Death==
Corbett died of liver cancer on February 18, 1933, aged 66. His body was interred in the Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. 

==Legacy==
On its creation in 1990, he was elected posthumously to the International Boxing Hall of Fame. There is also a street named for him in Bayside, Queens where he resided from 1902–1933.

Corbett&#x27;s great-great-great-nephew, Dan Corbett, was a professional heavyweight boxer from San Antonio, Texas, who won the United States Boxing Federation and International Boxing Organization Intercontinental Heavyweight titles before retiring.

James J. Corbett is not related to fellow boxing Hall of Famer Young Corbett II.

==Cultural references==
In 1892, the Spalding company, under their own publishing company Spalding Athletic Library, issued “Life and Battles of James J. Corbett”, Volume 1, Number 1. The book includes stories of Corbett&#x27;s past opponents. The editor Richard K Fox refers to Corbett as the California Wonder and a professor (of boxing).

In 1894, Corbett authored his autobiography under the title &quot;The Roar of the Crowd&quot;; the story was serialized by &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in six weekly installments during October/November 1894. The following year, G.P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons published it in book form, marketing it as the &quot;True Tale of the Rise and Fall of a Champion.&quot; In 1942, the story was made into a Hollywood motion picture titled &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot;, starring Errol Flynn as Corbett.

==Films==

Thomas Edison wrote &quot;I remember Jim Corbett very well, for he was a very important part of the first motion picture that we made for public exhibition. Yes, he can justly claim the distinction of being the oldest living film star, and I extend him my hearty congratulations,&quot; from a letter in 1930.

<doc id="741240" wikidata="Q448890" url="?curid=741240" title="Charlotte Cushman">
<text>Charlotte Saunders Cushman (July 23, 1816 – February 18, 1876) was an American stage actress. Her voice was noted for its full contralto register, and she was able to play both male and female parts. She lived intermittently in Rome, in an expatriate colony of prominent artists and sculptors, some of whom became part of her tempestuous private life.

==Early life==

She was a descendant in the eighth generation from Pilgrim Robert Cushman, who helped organize the &quot;Mayflower&quot; voyage and brought the family name to the United States on the &quot;Fortune&quot; in 1621. Robert Cushman was a leader and a great advocate for emigration to America. He became a preacher in the colonies and was known for giving the first sermon in America. Charlotte&#x27;s father, Elkanah, rose from poverty to be a successful West Indian merchant. Charlotte was a remarkably bright, sportive child, excelling over her schoolmates and developing a voice of remarkable compass and richness, with a full contralto register. Two friends of her father, one of them John Mackay, in whose piano factory Jonas Chickering was then foreman, provided her with musical instruction. Cushman was forced to take on serious responsibilities at a very young age. When she was thirteen, her father was beset by serious financial troubles and shortly thereafter died, leaving his family with nearly nothing. This caused Charlotte to seek some way to bring income to her family. Although she was an outstanding student and achieved much academically, she left school to pursue a career in the opera.

When Mrs. Joseph Wood visited Boston in 1834, Capt. Mackay introduced Cushman, who sang with her in two of her concerts. Through Mrs. Wood&#x27;s influence she became a pupil of James G. Maeder, a ladies&#x27; musical director, and under his instruction made her first appearance in opera in the Tremont Theatre as the Countess Almaviva in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, with great success, and her second as Lucy Bertram in &quot;Guy Mannering&quot;. She went with his company to New Orleans, where her voice, which had been strained by the soprano parts assigned to her, suddenly failed. Seeking the counsel of James H. Caldwell, manager of the principal theatre of New Orleans, she was advised by him and by Barton, the tragedian, to become an actress and was given the part of Lady Macbeth to study. She made her dramatic debut in it, with complete success, in 1835.

==Theatrical career==
Cushman made her initial professional appearance at age eighteen on April 8, 1835, at Boston&#x27;s Tremont Theatre. She then went to New Orleans where she performed successfully for one season, after which she returned to New York City to act under contract with the Bowery Theatre. She scored rave reviews in Albany, New York for her portrayal of Lady Macbeth.

By 1839, her younger sister Susan Webb Cushman became an actress, and at the age of 14 had married Nelson Merriman. Her husband abandoned her when she was pregnant and Charlotte cared for her sister. The two sisters became famous for playing &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; together, with Charlotte playing Romeo and Susan playing Juliet.

In 1843, Cushman became involved romantically with Rosalie Sully, daughter of artist Thomas Sully. By 1844, the romance had ended. She began traveling abroad, acting in theater, and Sully died shortly thereafter. She was also very close to the writer Anne Hampton Brewster around 1844 but social pressure from Brewster&#x27;s brother meant that they had to part. Brewster reminisced about their idyllic time together in letters in 1849. She eventually left a portrait of Cushman by Thomas Sully as a bequest to the Library of Philadelphia.

In 1848, Cushman met journalist, writer and part-time actress Matilda Hays. The two women became close friends, and after a short amount of time and some correspondence, they became involved in an affair. For the next ten years the two would be together almost constantly. They became known for dressing alike, and in Europe were publicly known as &quot;a couple&quot;.

In 1849, Cushman returned to the United States and by 1852 had decided to retire from the stage. She took up residence with Hays in Rome, Italy. They began living in an American expatriate community there, made up mostly of the many lesbian artists and sculptors of the time. Cushman used her notoriety to promote the works of African American/Native American sculptor Edmonia Lewis, who had become a close friend and whose work Cushman greatly admired.

In 1854, Hays left Cushman for sculptor Harriet Hosmer, which launched a series of jealous interactions among the three women. Hays eventually returned to live with Cushman, but the tensions between her and Cushman would never be repaired. By late 1857, Cushman was secretly involved with sculptor Emma Stebbins. One night while Cushman was writing a note, Hays walked in on her. Suspecting that the note was to Stebbins, Hays demanded to see it. Although Cushman maintained that the note was not to Stebbins, she refused to show it to Hays. The altercation that followed was explosive. Hays became enraged and began chasing Cushman around the house, pounding her with her fists at every opportunity. The relationship ended immediately and Hays moved out. She then sued Cushman, stating in her claim that she had sacrificed her own career to support Cushman&#x27;s career and therefore was due a certain payment. Cushman paid her an unknown sum and the two women parted company forever.
Emma Stebbins moved in with Cushman shortly after the break-up. Cushman traveled to America for a short tour a couple of months later. Although Cushman maintained that she was devoted to Stebbins, she became involved with another woman not long after her relationship with Stebbins began. Cushman met an 18-year-old actress, Emma Crow, the daughter of Wayman Crow, and fell for her. The two women began an affair, and Cushman often called her &quot;my little lover&quot;.
Before her departure to Italy, Cushman offered a farewell performance at the Washington Theater in the title role of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The poster advertising her appearance describes her as &quot;a lady universally acknowledged as the greatest living tragic actress&quot;.

When Cushman returned to Italy, Crow followed. Not long after arriving in Italy, Crow attracted the attention of Cushman&#x27;s nephew, Ned Cushman. In April 1861, Ned Cushman and Emma Crow married.

Cushman was friends with artists, writers and politicians; when she came to Washington, D.C. in the 1860s, she often stayed at the home of Secretary of State William Seward, with whom she was very close friends. In July 1861, Seward introduced her to President Abraham Lincoln, who told her that &quot;Macbeth&quot; was his favorite Shakespearean play and that he hoped someday to see her in the role of Lady Macbeth. In 1863 she again returned to the United States, appearing on several occasions for the benefit of the Sanitary Commission. Lincoln saw her perform in &quot;Macbeth&quot; in October at Grover&#x27;s Theatre with his family. During the last six years of her life Cushman developed a remarkable ability as a dramatic reader, giving scenes from Shakespeare, ballad poetry, dialect poems and humorous pieces with a success not less decided than her earlier dramatic triumphs. In 1871, after a residence in Europe, she resumed her career in the United States as a reader, besides fulfilling several dramatic engagements.

Her farewell appearance was announced at least seven times in as many different years. Her final performance in New York was at Booth&#x27;s theatre, where she played the part of Lady Macbeth. She took a similar demonstrative farewell in the same character in Philadelphia and other cities and her career closed in Boston, at the Globe Theatre, on 15 May 1875. After a reading tour to Rochester, Buffalo, and Syracuse, she retired with a large fortune to her villa at Newport, where she was seized with her final illness. In October she went to Boston and placed herself under medical treatment.

==Death==
Charlotte Cushman died of pneumonia in her hotel room on the third floor at the Parker House Hotel in Boston in 1876, aged 59, and was interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

In 1915 she was elected to the Hall of Fame for Great Americans.

==Legacy==
She made England her home for several years, becoming friends with the author Geraldine Jewsbury, who is said to have based a character on Cushman in her 1848 novel &quot;The Half Sisters&quot;. There is a one-woman play about her titled &quot;The Last Reading of Charlotte Cushman&quot; written by Carolyn Gage.

Emma Stebbins&#x27; statue &quot;The Angel of the Waters&quot;, the angel above the fountain in Central Park&#x27;s Bethesda Terrace, is said to be inspired by Cushman.

In 1907, the Charlotte Cushman Club was founded and named in her honor. In 2000, it became the Charlotte Cushman Foundation.

Her Charlestown home is a site on the Boston Women&#x27;s Heritage Trail.

<doc id="741252" wikidata="Q2748489" url="?curid=741252" title="Alan Embree">
<text>Alan Duane Embree (born January 23, 1970) is an American former Major League Baseball relief pitcher. Embree played for the Cleveland Indians (1992–1996), Atlanta Braves (1997–1998), Arizona Diamondbacks (1998), San Francisco Giants (1999–2001), Chicago White Sox (2001), San Diego Padres (2002 &amp; 2006), Boston Red Sox (2002–2005), New York Yankees (2005), Oakland Athletics (2007–2008), and the Colorado Rockies (2009). He batted and threw left-handed, and was used as a left-handed specialist. He won the 2004 World Series with the Red Sox.

==High school==
Embree attended Prairie High School in Brush Prairie, Washington and was a letterman in football, basketball, baseball. In baseball, he won All-Conference honors. Embree won a state championship in baseball at Prairie High School. Due to a shoulder injury, he did not pitch during his senior season. Over the final three seasons of his high school career, he hit .400.

==Professional career==
From 1992 through 2004, Embree had posted a 28–28 record with a 4.38 ERA and seven saves in 568 games.

In 2004, Embree recorded the final out against the New York Yankees in Game 7 of the 2004 ALCS, and shut down the Cardinals in the eighth inning of Game 4 of the 2004 World Series, and an inning later, the Red Sox won the World Series and Embree received his World Series ring on Opening Day, 2005.

In 2005, with the Boston Red Sox, Embree&#x27;s record was 1–4 with a 7.65 ERA in 43 outings. As a result of these sub-par numbers, Embree was designated for assignment on July 19. He was signed by the New York Yankees on July 30 to replace Buddy Groom who was designated for assignment.

On December 6, 2006, it was announced that Embree agreed to a two-year deal with the Oakland Athletics including an option for the 2009 season. Embree spent the bulk of his time serving as the team&#x27;s closer while Huston Street was injured for a prolonged period.

On December 13, 2008, it was announced that Embree had agreed to a one-year deal with the Colorado Rockies for the 2009 season and an option for the 2010 season.

On July 7, 2009, Embree became only the second pitcher since 1990 to be awarded a win without throwing a single pitch. This is because he was able to pick Austin Kearns of the Washington Nationals off at first base.

On July 10, 2009, Embree&#x27;s right tibia was broken after he was struck in the leg by a line drive off the bat of the Atlanta Braves&#x27; Martín Prado. The injury required surgery and caused Embree to miss the rest of the 2009 season.

On March 20, 2010, the Boston Red Sox signed Embree to a Minor League contract with a Major League Spring Training invitation. Embree had a clause in his contract that would grant him a release by April 15, if he was not on the major league roster. He opted to remain with the Boston organization and was called up on April 28. However, he was designated for assignment on May 1 without appearing in a game.

On May 11, 2010, the Chicago White Sox signed Embree and assigned him to the Triple-A Charlotte Knights.

==Pitching style==
Embree relied primarily on two pitches: a 90–95 MPH four-seam fastball and a sharp slider. In his younger days, Embree&#x27;s fastball was clocked as high as 96–98 mph. During his time with the Red Sox, he began to throw his fastball at slightly lower velocity in order to avoid injuring his arm. He also refined his slider into an effective pitch, whereas before, he had relied almost exclusively on his blazing fastball.

==Post-playing career==
On November 8, 2012, Embree was named the pitching coach for the Bend Elks Baseball Club in Bend, Oregon. The Bend Elks are an amateur baseball team from Bend, Oregon. The team is a founding member of the wooden-bat West Coast League, a collegiate summer baseball league in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia that began play in 2005. He resides in The Dalles, Oregon and Melbourne Aus with his wife Semira Embree.

In 2022, Embree was named the manager of the Cowlitz Black Bears, also a West Coast League team.
In 2023, Embree was named pitching coach of the Springfield Drifters, also a West Coast League team.
The 2023-2024 season is also his first as the pitching coach for the Bushnell University (NAIA) baseball team located in Eugene, OR.

<text>Marvin Hart (September 16, 1876 – September 17, 1931) was the World Heavyweight Boxing Champion from July 3, 1905, to February 23, 1906.

== Boxing career ==
Hart, nicknamed &quot;the Louisville Plumber&quot; because of his former trade, gained considerable prominence after a 1905 win over future champion Jack Johnson. That year, the heavyweight title was left vacant as a result of the retirement of champion James J. Jeffries and Hart&#x27;s record earned him a chance to fight for the championship against top-ranked Jack Root (1876–1963), a much more experienced boxer, who had already beaten Hart in November, 1902.

Jeffries, the retiring champ, refereed the championship fight on July 3, 1905, in Reno, Nevada. Hart knocked out Jack Root in the 12th round to win the vacant championship. After one successful exhibition match, Hart lost his championship to Canadian Tommy Burns on February 23, 1906, in Los Angeles. Burns won the 20-round fight by decision.

== Death ==
Hart died the day after his 55th birthday of an enlarged liver and high blood pressure. He was interred in the Resthaven Memorial Park, in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky.

<doc id="741258" wikidata="Q1627590" url="?curid=741258" title="Peter Pevensie">
<text>Peter Pevensie is a fictional character in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; book series. Peter appears in three of the seven books; as a child and a principal character in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; and &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, and as an adult in &quot;The Last Battle&quot;. He is mentioned in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, in which he is away on the northern frontier fighting giants, and in &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, in which he is studying under the tutelage of Professor Kirke.

Peter is the eldest of the four Pevensie children and shares his adventures in Narnia with his sisters Susan and Lucy and with his brother Edmund.

Peter&#x27;s reign in Narnia was a tetrarchy (Greek: &quot;leadership of four&quot;), and as [[High King]] Peter the Magnificent, he had supreme authority over all subsequent Narnian monarchs. Peter is illustrated by Pauline Baynes in the original novels with dark hair, but there are no specific descriptions of his hair or eye colour or complexion by Lewis.

==Name==
An early draft of &quot;The Lion&quot; begins, &quot;This book is about four children whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose, and Peter. But it is most about Peter who was the youngest.&quot; Peter is the only name that makes it into the final work, but as the oldest child instead of the youngest. 
Pevensey, on the southeast coast of England, is the site of a medieval castle that figures importantly in British history at several points. In Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Puck of Pook&#x27;s Hill&quot; (1907) at least one of the characters refers to Pevensey as &quot;England&#x27;s Gate&quot;, which the celebrated wardrobe in Lewis&#x27;s books quite literally becomes. The surname &quot;Pevensie&quot; does not actually appear in the Chronicles until the third published book, &quot;The Voyage of the &quot;Dawn Treader.

==Biography==
===Prior story===
Peter was born in 1927 and is 13 years old when he appears in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. As a monarch of Narnia&#x27;s Golden Age, he rules with his brother and sisters for 15 years, reaching the approximate age of 28 before returning to the age of 13 in England at the end of &quot;Wardrobe&quot;. By &quot;The Last Battle&quot; he is a 22-year-old university student with his heart still in Narnia, though he had not been there since &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, when he was 14 years old.

===In &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;===
A loyal and devoted big brother figure, Peter is the eldest of the four siblings. He tries his best to protect his siblings and to act like a responsible young adult. In the book, it is implied that he is more mature than his siblings because after their father was called out to fight in the war, Peter&#x27;s mother told him to support his three siblings through the ordeal of their father going away. He is evacuated to the countryside with his siblings by train because of the air-raids during World War II. In the countryside, they stay at the old mansion of Professor Digory Kirke.

When Lucy first stumbles on the wardrobe, Peter does not believe her, thinking it is just her imagination until he and the other Pevensies enter the wardrobe themselves; &quot;A jolly good hoax, Lu&quot;. He later apologizes to Lucy for not believing her and is quite angry with Edmund for earlier denying Narnia&#x27;s existence (Lucy had seen Edmund in Narnia before, but he had lied that they were just &quot;pretending&quot;); &quot;Well, of all the poisonous little beasts&quot;. This is caused by Edmund&#x27;s revelation of his deceit when, upon entering Narnia, he says; &quot;I say ... oughtn&#x27;t we to be bearing a bit more to the left, that is, if we are aiming for the lamp-post?&quot; Peter had already been angry with Edmund for &quot;encouraging&quot; Lucy before he knew that Edmund was telling lies; while not believing that Lucy had been in Narnia, he did believe that Edmund was not doing Lucy any good by jeering at her and encouraging her about her claim to have found a country in the wardrobe. During the period between Lucy claiming to have got into Narnia through the wardrobe a second time and all four siblings finally making it into Narnia together, Peter negotiates a truce between Edmund and Lucy, although his annoyance with Edmund is still visible.

Edmund later strays to the White Witch (having met her when he first came into Narnia and been seduced by her promises of power) and Peter later confesses to Aslan that his anger towards Edmund (for trying to make out that Lucy was a liar) probably helped him to go wrong. Peter and his siblings had been under the protection of Mr and Mrs. Beaver after arriving in Narnia, and Mr. Beaver had suspected Edmund was a traitor from the moment he set eyes on him, but did not mention anything to the others about it until his absence was noticed and Mr Beaver figured out that Edmund had gone to the White Witch. Edmund is eventually rescued on Aslan&#x27;s orders. Meanwhile, the others all make their way to the Stone Table to meet Aslan.
Peter received his sword (Rhindon) and shield from Father Christmas after meeting him on the journey to find Aslan, and is later knighted &quot;Sir Peter Wolf&#x27;s-Bane&quot; by Aslan after he kills Maugrim the wolf, chief of the White Witch&#x27;s secret police, who was trying to kill Susan and Lucy. In the American editions of the books on which the 1979 animated film was based, Lewis changed the chief wolf&#x27;s name to Fenris-Ulf, after a figure from Norse mythology. In those versions, Peter is given the epithet &quot;Fenris-bane&quot;.

While the great battle is being planned, he is appointed head General of Aslan&#x27;s army. After the defeat of the White Witch Jadis, self-styled Queen of Narnia, and her evil allies in the Battle of Beruna Ford, he is crowned to the Clear Northern Sky by Aslan as His Majesty King Peter the Magnificent, High King of Narnia, Emperor of the Lone Islands, Lord of Cair Paravel, Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Lion. The ancient prophecy of two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve coming to sit on the four thrones at Cair Paravel then comes to fruition. This marks the end of the hundred years of winter and the reign of the White Witch, and is the beginning of Narnia&#x27;s Golden Age.

He and his siblings finally return to their own world (where they find themselves as children once again) 15 years later, to find that no time had passed by there.

====In &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;====
Peter does not appear in this installment, but is mentioned. While Susan and Edmund are in Calormen escaping from Prince Rabadash, he is fighting giants in the north. (Lucy is the only one left at Cair Paravel).

===In &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;===
After the Pevensies arrive in the ruins of Cair Paravel, they find the castle&#x27;s treasure chamber, where Peter, Susan and Lucy find the gifts they were given by Father Christmas. Peter takes his sword, Rhindon, and his shield, and again serves as the leader of the group. They eventually meet Trumpkin, a dwarf who helped protect Prince Caspian X from his uncle&#x27;s Telmarine army, who accompanies them on their journey to meet Aslan.

When the children are forced to make a decision, Peter, as High King, has the final word. In order to stall the war long enough for Lucy to find Aslan and awaken the Narnians, Peter claims the right to a one-on-one duel with the Telmarine king, Miraz. After the Pevensie children help defeat the Telmarines, Peter formally gives Caspian the authority to rule a free Narnia. Aslan gives Caspian the authority to &quot;rule under Us and under the High King&quot;. However, Peter later confides to Lucy and Edmund that he was told by Aslan that he and Susan will never return to Narnia, as they are now too old, and have learned all that they can from that world.

The four children returned to their world, in which they were waiting for their trains to go to their respective boarding schools.

It is learned in this book that Lucy is his favorite sister, a fact that was fairly obvious throughout the series.

===In &quot;Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;===
While not physically present in the book, it was mentioned that Peter was under the tutelage of Professor Kirke in preparation for exams, but the other three children were unable to stay with him because he had moved out of the large house with the wardrobe and was now living in a much smaller house. In the film &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, Peter makes a cameo appearance at a party. When Lucy transforms herself into Susan, neither Peter nor Edmund know of Lucy or Narnia.

===In &quot;The Last Battle&quot;===
Peter has a minor role in the story. He was the only one to address Tirian, the king of Narnia at the time, in Tirian&#x27;s vision of the Seven Friends of Narnia.

After attending a dinner with the other Friends, Peter and Edmund went to London to retrieve the magic rings that Professor Digory Kirke buried in the Ketterleys&#x27; yard, hoping to use them to get Eustace and Jill to Narnia. Both were waiting for Lucy, Eustace, Jill, Digory, and Polly at the station platform when the train crashed and killed them all, temporarily transporting Jill and Eustace to Narnia until the end of the world, upon which they make their way to the real Narnia, or heaven, and are reunited with Peter, Edmund, Lucy, Digory, and Polly.

Peter is described by Tirian as having the face of a king and a warrior. After Tirian passed through the stable door and saw Tash for the first time, Peter calmly ordered the demon to leave with his prey. After passing judgement on all the inhabitants of Narnia, Aslan orders Peter to shut the door, ending the world. Peter is one of many others allowed to stay in Aslan&#x27;s Country including the parents of Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy.

==Christian elements==

Lewis, himself an expert on allegory, did not consider &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; allegory. He saw them as &quot;suppositional&quot; answering the question, &quot;What might Christ become like, if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours? This is not allegory at all.&quot; While not allegorical, Narnia does present significant parallels with elements from Christianity.

There are similarities between Peter Pevensie and St. Peter, who was one of Jesus&#x27;s original twelve disciples. Like St. Peter, who was given that name from Christ, Peter Pevensie is given the name Sir Peter Wolfsbane by Aslan. As the traditional first Bishop of Rome, St. Peter and his successors, are &quot;primus inter pares&quot;, or first-among-equals with the other leaders of the church. Similarly, Peter Pevensie is given the title of High King. Lastly the biblical St. Peter, according to Catholic tradition, was given the &quot;keys to the kingdom of heaven&quot; and Peter Pevensie shut the door, locking it with a golden key, sealing the destroyed Narnia after the judgment in &quot;The Last Battle&quot;.

<doc id="741267" wikidata="Q471845" url="?curid=741267" title="Jess Willard">
<text>Jess Myron Willard (December 29, 1881 – December 15, 1968) was an American world heavyweight boxing champion billed as the Pottawatomie Giant. He won the world heavyweight title in 1915 by knocking out Jack Johnson. 

Willard was known for size rather than skill, and though he held the championship for more than four years, he rarely defended it. In 1919, when he was 37 years old, he lost the title in an extremely one-sided loss by declining to come out for the fourth round against Jack Dempsey, who became a more celebrated champion. Soon after the bout, Willard began accusing Dempsey of using something with the effect of a knuckle duster. Dempsey did not grant Willard a return match, and at 42 years old he was KO&#x27;d, following which he retired from boxing, although for the rest of his life he continued to claim Dempsey had cheated. Ferdie Pacheco expressed the opinion in a book that the surviving photographs of Willard&#x27;s face during the Dempsey fight indicate fractures to Willard&#x27;s facial bones suggesting a metal implement, and show he was bleeding heavily. The matter has never been resolved, with contemporaneous ringside sports journalist reporting in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Willard spat out at least one tooth and was &quot;a fountain of blood&quot; increasingly discounted in favor of a view that he had only a cut lip and a little bruising.

==Early life==
Jess Myron Willard was born on 29 December 1881 in Saint Clere, Kansas. In his teenage years and twenties he worked as a cowboy. He was of mostly English ancestry, which had been in North America since the colonial era. The first member of the Willard family arrived in Virginia in the 1630s.

==Boxing career==
A powerfully built and , Willard did not begin boxing until the age of 27, but proved successful, defeating top-ranked opponents to earn a chance to fight for the Championship. He said he started boxing because he did not have much of an education, but thought his size and strength could earn him a good living. He was a gentle and friendly person and did not enjoy boxing or hurting people, so often waited until his opponent attacked him before punching back, which made him feel at ease as if he were defending himself. He was often maligned as an uncoordinated oaf rather than a skilled boxer, but his counter-punching style, coupled with his enormous strength and stamina, proved successful against top fighters. His physical strength was so great that he was reputed to be able to kill a man with a single punch. In a fight with Jack &quot;Bull&quot; Young in 1913, during the ninth round Young collapsed and died from a punch to the head. Willard was charged with second-degree murder, but was successfully defended by lawyer Earl Rogers.

===Jack Johnson fight===
On April 5, 1915, in front of a huge crowd at the new Oriental Park Racetrack in Havana, Cuba, he knocked out champion Jack Johnson in the 26th round to win the world heavyweight boxing championship. Johnson later said he had intentionally lost the fight, despite the fact there is evidence of Willard winning fairly, which can be seen clearly in the recorded footage, as well as the comments Johnson made to his cornermen between rounds and immediately after the fight, and that he bet $2500 on himself to win. Willard said, &quot;If he was going to throw the fight, I wish he&#x27;d done it sooner. It was hotter than hell out there.&quot; Johnson later acknowledged lying about throwing the fight after footage of the fight was made widely available in the United States. Shortly after the fight, Jack Johnson had actually accepted defeat gracefully saying, &quot;Willard was too much for me, I just didn&#x27;t have it.&quot;

Johnson found that he could not knock out the giant Willard, who fought as a counterpuncher, making Johnson do all the leading. Johnson began to tire after the 20th round, and was visibly hurt by heavy body punches from Willard in rounds preceding the 26th-round knockout. Johnson&#x27;s claim of a &quot;dive&quot; gained momentum because most fans only saw a still photo of Johnson lying on the canvas shading his eyes from the broiling Cuban sun. No films of the fight were allowed to be shown in the United States because of an inter-state ban on the trafficking of fight films that was in effect at the time. Most boxing fans saw the film of the Johnson–Willard fight only when a copy was found in 1967.

Willard fought several times over the next four years, but made only one official title defense prior to 1919, defeating Frank Moran on March 25, 1916, at Madison Square Garden.
===Jack Dempsey fight===

At age 37, Willard lost his title to Dempsey on July 4, 1919, in Toledo. Dempsey knocked Willard down for the first time in his career with a left hook in the first round. Dempsey knocked Willard down seven times in the first round—although it should be remembered that rules at the time permitted standing almost over a knocked-down opponent and hitting him again as soon as both gloves had left the canvas. At one point Dempsey left the ring mistakenly thinking the fight was over, and under the rules could have been disqualified, but Willard had economised by not employing professional cornermen and they failed to insist on application of the regulations. Dempsey won the title when Willard was unable to continue after the third round. In the fight, Willard was later reputed to have suffered a broken jaw, cheekbone, and ribs, as well as losing several teeth. His attempt to fight to the finish, ending when he was unable to come out for the fourth round, is considered one of the most courageous performances in boxing history. However, the extent of Willard&#x27;s injuries has been highly disputed and is now unclear since multiple independent reports only a few days after the fight said that there were no traces of any damage other than a couple of bruises:

To take only one representative account, according to a reporter for the &quot;Topeka Daily Capital&quot;, July 16, 1919, p. 8, who interviewed Jess when he got back to Lawrence, &quot;The ex-champion didn&#x27;t have any black eye, nor any signs that he was injured in any way.&quot;
;Concealed metal object theory
When interviewed by Harry Carpenter of the &quot;BBC Sport&quot; in the 1960s at his house in California, Willard said to the reporter, &quot;I&#x27;ll show you, how I was beaten.&quot; He then drew a metal bolt from a cardbox, saying that Dempsey held the bolt in his hand, not &quot;within&quot; the glove but at the palm of it, attached to the thumb sideways, and used the bolt rather for cutting-and-slicing-like moves to inflict blood-spilling cuts and pain, relinquishing it just as the bout was stopped, and according to Willard, the bolt was found on the floor of the ring at the end of the fight and he kept it. Mike Tyson, who studied the case in-depth and very thoroughly, later joined Carpenter to discuss the subject. Tyson, a great admirer of Dempsey&#x27;s, admitted that &quot;he just did whatever Jack Kearns told him to do&quot; and &quot;in those days anything could have happened&quot;, for that there was no agency or other legal authority at the time that was officially empowered to oversee and protect fighters from violations of such kind. However, footage before the fight shows Dempsey putting on his gloves with no additional objects and in full view of Willard, his team and the crowd.

===Comeback===
After losing his title fight with Dempsey, Willard went into semiretirement from the ring, fighting only exhibition bouts for the next four years. On May 12, 1923, promoter Tex Rickard arranged for Willard to make a comeback, fighting Floyd Johnson as part of the first line-up of boxing matches at the newly opened Yankee Stadium in New York City. 63,000 spectators attended the match, which the 41-year-old Willard was widely expected to lose. However, after Willard took a beating for several rounds, he came back to knock down Johnson in the 9th and 11th rounds, and Willard earned a TKO victory. Damon Runyon wrote afterward: &quot;Youth, take off your hat and bow low and respectfully to age. For days and days, the sole topic of conversation in the world of sport will be Willard&#x27;s astonishing comeback.&quot;

Willard followed up this victory by facing contender Luis Ángel Firpo on July 12, 1923. The fight was held at Boyle&#x27;s Thirty Acres in New Jersey, in front of more than 75,000 spectators. Willard was knocked out in the eighth round, and then permanently retired from boxing.

==Later life==

Willard parlayed his boxing fame into an acting career of a sort. He acted in a vaudeville show, had a role in &quot;Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West&quot; show, and starred in a 1919 feature film &quot;The Challenge of Chance&quot;. In 1933, he appeared in a bit part in a boxing movie, &quot;The Prizefighter and the Lady&quot;, with Max Baer and Myrna Loy.

==Death==
Willard died on 15 December 1968, in Los Angeles, California, from congestive heart failure. He had been admitted to a hospital a week earlier for a heart condition, but left against a doctor&#x27;s advice. He returned again after suffering a stroke and died 12 hours later.

Having died at age 86, Willard was the longest-lived heavyweight champion in history until he was surpassed by his old foe Jack Dempsey (who died in 1983, aged 87), then by Jack Sharkey (who died in 1994, aged 91), and finally by Max Schmeling (who died in 2005 at the age of 99. 

Willard&#x27;s body was buried at Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery, in Los Angeles.

==Tributes==
In 2003 he was inducted posthumously into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Cultural references==
Willard and a dispute he had with Harry Houdini is the topic of Andy Duncan&#x27;s Nebula Award nominated novella &quot;The Pottawatomie Giant&quot;. In 2020, a television program &quot;Antiques Roadshow – Crocker Art Museum&quot; (Season 24, Episode 8, Part 2), showed a photograph from his 5 April 1915 championship winning match, and the commemorative pocket watch Willard carried which was valued at between $15,000 and $50,000.

<text>George Ticknor Curtis (November 28, 1812 – March 28, 1894) was an American historian, lawyer, and writer.

==Biography==
Curtis was born in Watertown, Massachusetts, and graduated from Harvard University in 1832 and then Harvard Law School. After admittance to the Massachusetts bar in 1836, he practiced first in Boston and then in New York City. Curtis was very successful as a patent attorney, working for (among others) Samuel F. B. Morse, Charles Goodyear and Cyrus McCormick.

From 1840 to 1843, Curtis was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives as a Whig. A political ally of Daniel Webster, he was one of the &quot;Cotton Whigs&quot; who joined the Democratic Party when the Whig party dissolved in 1856.

Later, as a U.S. commissioner at Boston, Curtis was compelled to send a former slave, Thomas Sims, back to slavery in compliance with the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. He served as co-counsel for Dred Scott when his case reached the United States Supreme Court in 1857. His brother, Benjamin Robbins Curtis, was notable as one of the two dissenters in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;.

Curtis wrote biographies of Daniel Webster (1870) and James Buchanan (1883) as well as a number of legal treatises, including his oft-cited &quot;A Treatise on the Law of Patents for Useful Inventions in the United States of America&quot; (Curtis on Patents). Among these, his &quot;Constitutional History of the United States [...] to the Close of the Civil War&quot; (2 vols., 1889 and 1896) has been called the classic Federalist interpretation of the Constitution. Another notable work is &quot;History of the Origin, Formation and Adoption of the Constitution&quot;.

Curtis was a creationist; he attacked evolution in his book &quot;Creation or Evolution? A Philosophical Inquiry&quot; (1887).

While not a Mormon himself (he was a member of the Federal Street Church, a Unitarian congregation), Curtis was also a defender of Mormonism, writing pro-Mormon articles for New York newspapers and magazines, most notably the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; (July 14, 1887) and &quot;The Forum&quot; (November 1887).

He died in New York City on March 28, 1894.

<text>Brooke Kinsella (born 17 July 1983) is a British actress. A graduate of the Anna Scher Theatre School, Kinsella has been acting since childhood. She has had various roles on television and in film. Her most notable role is that of Kelly Taylor, who featured in BBC&#x27;s long-running soap opera, &quot;EastEnders&quot;, between 2001 and 2004. She has her own drama school called True Stars Academy.

Kinsella&#x27;s family made headlines in the British press in 2008 following the murder of her half-brother, Ben, who was stabbed to death in June 2008. After his death, hundreds of people protested along with Kinsella over knife fatalities in London.

==Career==
Kinsella attended the Maria Fidelis RC Convent School in Camden. Prompted by her mother, who wanted to encourage her to take up a hobby she enjoyed, Kinsella attended the Anna Scher Theatre School at the age of 6, and stayed there until she was 16.

She made her television debut at the age of 7 in the BBC children&#x27;s series &quot;Mud&quot; and has appeared in a variety of other TV productions, including &quot;Coming Home&quot;. As well as appearing in an episode of the BBC series &quot;Sunburn&quot; in 2000, she has also appeared in the entirely unrelated music video &quot;Sunburn&quot; by British rock band, Muse.

Film credits include the Channel 4 film &quot;Kid In The Corner&quot; (1999), about a child with ADHD, and the controversial ITV film &quot;No Child of Mine&quot; (1997), in which she played a young girl subjected to systematic sexual abuse.

In 2002, Kinsella appeared as Liz Chambers in ITV1&#x27;s cop show &quot;The Bill&quot;, playing a teenage runaway. Her character is later the first victim of the original Sun Hill Serial Killer.

Her stage credits include &quot;School Play&quot; at Soho Theatre (2001) and a rehearsed reading of &quot;Skyvers&quot; by Barry Reckord at the Royal Court Theatre in 2006.

Before securing the role of Kelly Taylor in &quot;EastEnders&quot;, Kinsella had auditioned for the parts of Zoe Slater, Janine Butcher and Sonia Jackson, but was unsuccessful. Kinsella completed the first year of a degree in English, Media and Drama at Buckinghamshire New University before joining the cast of &quot;EastEnders&quot;. She joined the show for a brief stint in 2001, before returning as a full-time cast member from 2002 to 2004. During her time on the soap opera, Brooke&#x27;s character weathered prostitution, relationship break-ups and confusion over her sexual identity prompted by a lesbian kiss with Michelle Ryan&#x27;s character, Zoe Slater. The kiss was criticised in the British media as cheap sensationalism and branded as a ratings-stunt. Louise Berridge, the one-time executive producer of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, made the decision to axe Kinsella&#x27;s character in 2004 to allow further character development of her on-screen best friend, Zoe Slater; however, Kinsella maintains it was a mutual decision between herself and Berridge. In March 2008, Brooke said in an interview with &quot;Woman&quot; magazine that she would love to return to &quot;EastEnders&quot; at some point. In 2018, she helped the writers of &quot;EastEnders&quot; with a stabbing storyline involving the characters, Shakil Kazemi and Keegan Taylor.

Kinsella and her real-life partner Ray Panthaki (who played Ronny Ferreira in &quot;EastEnders&quot;) played a heroin-taking couple in director Andrew Jones&#x27;s film &quot;The Feral Generation&quot;, which was shot during the period of December 2006 and January 2007 and premiered at the 2007 Portobello Film Festival. Her debut novel, &quot;Friendship Is A Funny Thing&quot; is awaiting publication. She was made an MBE for her work on knife crime in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours 2011.

==Personal life==
Kinsella&#x27;s father left the family when she was four years old and she was subsequently raised by her mother Debbie and stepfather George, who Kinsella has described as her &quot;real dad&quot;. She lives in Islington, north London and is the eldest of five children; she has two sisters, a half-sister and had a half-brother.

Kinsella married her long-term partner Simon Boardley on 28 December 2017. On 22 September 2020, Kinsella gave birth to their first child, a daughter. On 29 June 2022, Kinsella gave birth to their second child, a boy. 

===Murder of brother===

On 29 June 2008 at 02:00 BST, Kinsella&#x27;s 16-year-old brother, Ben Kinsella was stabbed to death by a gang of three youths in a London street. Ben, the seventeenth teenager killed in London in 2008, died in hospital a few hours later. Kinsella said she was &quot;devastated&quot;.

Following his death, Kinsella and her family led hundreds of people in a march to protest against London&#x27;s knife and gun crime. On 3 July 2008, three people were charged with Ben&#x27;s murder, for which they were later tried and convicted. The Kinsella family launched the Ben Kinsella Trust in Ben&#x27;s memory, in a bid to end knife crime. In the run up to the 2010 general election, Kinsella announced her support for the Conservative Party and revealed she would head a panel deciding how grants were distributed to voluntary groups tackling youth crime.

On 23 and 25 February 2011, an anti-knife campaign, funded by the Kinsella trust was run in Birmingham&#x27;s New Street Station, in conjunction with the British Transport Police and Great Barr School&#x27;s drama department from its Sixth Form centre. A play was performed to the public throughout each of these days in the station&#x27;s concourse, to raise awareness of the effects of knife crime.

Kinsella was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to the prevention of knife crime.

In December 2018, Kinsella appeared in an episode of the BBC One series &quot;Defenders UK&quot; to talk about the murder of her brother, Ben.

There is one state run central system of examination boards in Poland called &quot;Centralna Komisja Egzaminacyjna&quot; (&quot;Central Examination Board&quot;) established within the new legislation on education issued by Polish parliament in 1998. The central board has eight regional branches called &quot;Okręgowa Komisja Egzaminacyjna&quot; (OKE) – &quot;Regional Examination Board&quot;. All primary and secondary schools and other education institutions in a region are served by the regional OKE. Universities are not part of that system. It is allowed by law to sit an exam in other regional board than the home one, but practically it does not happen. 

Each OKE is responsible for the content and administration of the entrance tests to primary schools, Gymnasiums and secondary schools in accordance to the Ministry of Education annual guidelines. Final secondary school examination called Matura (analogous to A Levels) is prepared each year by the Ministry of Education and administered by regional examiners, who are recruited, trained and paid by regional OKE boards. Each regional OKE has an authority to issue an official certificate of an examination.

<doc id="741282" wikidata="Q5201104" url="?curid=741282" title="Cyrus H. K. Curtis">
<text>Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis (June 18, 1850June 7, 1933) was an American publisher of magazines and newspapers, including the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; and &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Curtis was born in Portland, Maine. He was forced to leave high school after his first year to start working after his family lost their home in the Great Fire of Portland.

==Career==
Curtis held a variety of newspaper and advertising jobs in Portland and Boston before starting his first publication, a weekly called the &quot;People&#x27;s Ledger&quot;, in Boston in 1872.

In 1876, he moved to Philadelphia, then a major publishing center, to reduce his printing costs.

Curtis&#x27;s first wife was Louisa Knapp. In 1883, Knapp contributed a one-page supplement to the &quot;Tribune and Farmer&quot;, a magazine published by Curtis. The following year, the supplement was expanded as an independent publication with Louisa as the editor. Its original name was &quot;The Ladies Home Journal and Practical Housekeeper&quot;, but Knapp dropped the last three words in 1886, and it became &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;. &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; rapidly became the leading magazine of its type, reaching a circulation of one million subscriptions within ten years. It was the first American magazine to do so.

Louisa Knapp continued as editor until 1889 when she was succeeded by Edward William Bok. Several years later Bok married Mary Louise Curtis in 1896, becoming the Curtises&#x27; son-in-law. Bok retired from the magazine in 1919, but the changes he made had vastly increased circulation. Bok introduced business practices such as: low subscription rates, inclusion of advertising to off-set costs, and reliance on popular content. This operating structure was adopted by men&#x27;s magazines such as &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Munsey&#x27;s&quot; roughly a decade after it had become the standard practice of American women&#x27;s magazines. Scholars argue that women&#x27;s magazines, like the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, pioneered these strategies &quot;magazine revolution&quot;.

Curtis founded the Curtis Publishing Company in 1891; it would eventually publish &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;, and others. A separate company founded by Curtis, Curtis-Martin Newspapers, controlled several newspapers, including for a time the &quot;Philadelphia Public Ledger&quot;, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, and the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;. Management mistakes at the newspapers led to poor financial returns, and eventually, they were sold.

While Curtis was alive, his businesses, excepting the newspapers, were successful. &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot; was for decades the most widely circulating women&#x27;s magazine in the U.S., and &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; enjoyed the highest circulation of any weekly magazine in the world. In 1929, the &quot;Post&quot; and the &quot;Journal&quot; together ran fully forty percent of all US magazine advertising. One source lists Curtis as the 51st richest person ever, with a fortune of $43.2 billion adjusted for inflation (to 2008 dollars), which according to this source made him richer than J. P. Morgan.

Curtis built &quot;Lyndon&quot;, a Renaissance revival estate in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, with landscaping designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. Two of Curtis&#x27;s yachts, built 1907 and 1920, were named &quot;Lyndonia&quot;.

Curtis was more than an occasional sailor, however, noting in a 1922 &quot;New York Times&quot; interview, &quot;Yachting is not a hobby with me. It is a necessity. I spend half my time on this ship,&quot; and further noting that most of his meetings with staff or board members were held in the second &quot;Lyndonia&#x27;s&quot; dining room. Curtis had three large yachts built at Charles L. Seabury Co.: the 115-foot &quot;Machigonne&quot; in 1904; the 163-foot &quot;Lyndonia&quot; in 1907; and the 228-foot &quot;Lyndonia&quot; in 1920. Curtis was a founding member of the Camden Yacht Club in Camden, Maine, and its Commodore from 1909 to 1933, later donating the club&#x27;s facilities to the town.

In the summer of 1932, Curtis suffered a heart attack while aboard his yacht, the second &quot;Lyndonia&quot;. While he was recuperating at Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia, his second wife, Kate Stanwood Cutter Pillsbury Curtis, died suddenly. Curtis then remained in frail health until his death on June 7, 1933, at age 82, and he was interred at West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

Soon after his death, most of the buildings on Curtis&#x27;s estate were demolished, and his daughter founded the Curtis Arboretum on the site. After the Curtis Publishing Company moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1982, the company&#x27;s former headquarters on Independence Square in downtown Philadelphia became the &quot;Curtis Center&quot;, home to a conference center, offices, a health club, retail shops, and restaurants.

Before his death, Curtis was elected to the American Philosophical Society (1933). He was among the first ten inductees in the American Advertising Federation&#x27;s Advertising Hall of Fame (1999).

==Philanthropy==
Cyrus Curtis remains #20 on the list of the richest Americans ever. He was known for his philanthropy to hospitals, museums, universities, and schools. He donated $2 million to the Franklin Institute, for example; $1.25 million to the Drexel Institute of Technology for the construction of Curtis Hall; and $1 million to the University of Pennsylvania. He also purchased a pipe organ manufactured by the Austin Organ Company that had been displayed at the Philadelphia Sesquicentennial Exposition of 1926 and donated it to the University of Pennsylvania. It was incorporated into Irvine Auditorium when the building was constructed and is known to this day as the Curtis Organ, one of the largest pipe organs in the world. (The largest working organ resides in Philadelphia&#x27;s John Wanamaker Building, only twenty blocks east of Irvine Auditorium, and the largest in the world, though it isn&#x27;t currently working, is in the Atlantic City Convention Center, some 60 miles east.) Curtis donated pipe organs to many institutions in Philadelphia and on the day of his funeral, all of those organs were played in his honor.

In memory of his boyhood music teacher, Hermann Kotzschmar, for whom he had been named, Curtis in 1912 donated the Kotzschmar Memorial Organ to Maine&#x27;s Portland City Hall Auditorium. In Thomaston, Maine, he funded the 1927–29 recreation of &quot;Montpelier&quot;, the demolished 1795 mansion of Revolutionary War general Henry Knox.

Curtis was a major organizer and backer of the Philadelphia Orchestra, founded in 1900. In its early years, he paid off its debts anonymously. Curtis&#x27;s daughter, Mary Louise Curtis Bok, founded Philadelphia&#x27;s Curtis Institute of Music in 1924 and dedicated it to her father.

<text>Fortaleza Esporte Clube is a Brazilian multi-sport club based in Fortaleza, capital of the state of Ceará. Founded in 18 October 1918, primarily a football club, is active in other sports such as futsal, handball and basketball. The club&#x27;s colors are red, blue and white.

Fortaleza is one of the most successful football clubs in the Brazilian Northeast, having won 46 state league titles and 3 Copa do Nordeste titles. It is placed by surveys as the second biggest fan base in the Northeast, behind only EC Bahia. Its biggest rival is Ceará SC, and clashes between them are called Clássico-Rei (Classic of Kings).

== History ==
On 23 February 1912, Alcides Santos founded a club called Fortaleza, and participated shortly after in the founding of the Stella Foot-Ball Club. Finally, on 18 October 1918, Fortaleza Sporting Club was born, the first denomination of the Fortaleza Esporte Clube. Its colors represent the colors of the French flag, since the founder spent time in France and decided to put the colors of the European country in the Brazilian club.

In 1920, they participated in the foundation of the Associação Cearense de Desportos. That same year they got their first Cearense Championship title.

In 1951, the Municipality of Fortaleza decided to renovate the Presidente Vargas Stadium. The idea of having a private stadium was reborn in the board since it had its own stadium during the 1920s.

In 1957, the club acquired from the land in Bairro do Pici from Mrs. Hedwing, which during the Second World War was where the American military base was in Fortaleza, called &quot;Post Command&quot; (&quot;Command&quot; Post), hence the name Pici, transfers it to the Club of Gentilândia in exchange for the new neighborhood. It changed its name to Leão do Pici, a reference to the neighborhood where the Parque dos Campeonatos is located.

The Alcides Santos Stadium opened its doors in June 1962, beating Usina Ceará in the inaugural match.

After finishing in 4th place in the 2021 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, the club qualified for the Copa Libertadores for the first time in history. In 2023 they finished 2nd place in the Copa Sudamericana, losing to L.D.U. Quito.

<doc id="741288" wikidata="Q504966" url="?curid=741288" title="Andrew Gregg Curtin">
<text>Andrew Gregg Curtin (April 22, 1815October 7, 1894) was an American lawyer and politician. He served as the 15th governor of Pennsylvania during the American Civil War, helped defend his state during the Gettysburg Campaign, and oversaw the creation of the National Cemetery and the ceremony in which Abraham Lincoln delivered his famous Gettysburg Address.

==Early life and education==
Curtin was born in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. Sources vary as to his birth date. Some list April 22, 1815; others list April 22, 1817. Curtin&#x27;s gravestone uses the 1815 date. His parents were Roland Curtin Sr., a wealthy Irish-born iron manufacturer from County Clare, and Jane (née Gregg) Curtin, the daughter of U.S. Senator Andrew Gregg. Along with Miles Boggs, Curtin&#x27;s father established Eagle Ironworks at Curtin Village in 1810.

Curtin&#x27;s family was prominent in Pennsylvania politics and in the American Civil War. He was the great-grandson of James Potter, the vice president of Pennsylvania, and was the grandson of Andrew Gregg, a prominent Pennsylvania politician. He was the uncle of John I. Gregg and cousin of David McMurtrie Gregg, both Union generals in the Civil War. His cousin was Colonel John I. Curtin.

Curtin attended Bellefonte Academy, Dickinson College, and Dickinson School of Law.

==Career==
After law school, Curtin began practicing law. He first entered politics during the 1840 election, campaigning for Whig presidential candidate William Henry Harrison.

In 1855, Pennsylvania governor James Pollock appointed Curtin Superintendent of Public Schools.

===Governor of Pennsylvania===
With the collapse of the Whig Party, Curtin switched to the newly formed Republican Party and successfully ran for governor of Pennsylvania in 1860. At the same time, he helped Abraham Lincoln win the Republican nomination for president. A large crowd attended Curtin&#x27;s inaugural ceremonies on January 15, 1861.

Curtin was a strong supporter of President Lincoln&#x27;s policies in the Civil War, and Curtin committed Pennsylvania to the war effort. Curtin organized the Pennsylvania Reserves into combat units, and oversaw the construction of the first Union military camp for training militia. It opened in an agricultural school nearby Harrisburg as Camp Curtin on April 18, 1861, and more than 300,000 men were drilled there during 4 years. In the years that followed, Curtin became a close friend and confidant of Abraham Lincoln, visiting the White House several times in order to converse about the status of the war effort.

Curtin was very active during the Gettysburg Campaign, working with Major General Darius N. Couch and Major Granville O. Haller to delay Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia and prevent it from crossing the Susquehanna River. Major General George G. Meade, a Pennsylvania officer whom Curtin had recommended for brigadier general and command of one of the Pennsylvania reserve brigades in 1861, defeated Lee in the Battle of Gettysburg.

Following the Battle of Gettysburg, Governor Curtin was the principal force behind the establishment of the National Cemetery there. Through his agent, David Wills, Curtin persuaded President Abraham Lincoln to attend the dedication of the cemetery. Governor Curtin was sitting with Lincoln on the platform on November 19, 1863, when Lincoln delivered his famed Gettysburg Address.

In his first term, Governor Curtin suffered a severe breakdown from the stresses of war. Secretary of State Eli Slifer handled governmental affairs during the increasingly frequent periods when Curtin was incapacitated. President Lincoln offered the governor a diplomatic position abroad, but he chose to run for reelection in 1863.

To coordinate Union war efforts, Curtin convened the Loyal War Governors&#x27; Conference on September 24 and 25, 1862, in Altoona. This event was one of his most significant contributions to the Union war effort. He formed the Pennsylvania State Agency in Washington, and another branch in Nashville, Tennessee, to provide support for wounded soldiers on the battlefield and returned home. He also founded the state-funded Orphan&#x27;s School to aid and educate children of military men who had died for the Union cause.

Soon after the war, Curtin was elected to the honorary position of a 3rd Class Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States in recognition of his support for the Union during the war.

As governor, from 1858 to 1860, Curtin also served as president of the Tyrone and Clearfield Railroad.

===Ambassador to Russia===
After the Civil War, Curtin lost his party&#x27;s Senate nomination to Simon Cameron, and was appointed Ambassador to Russia by President Ulysses S. Grant.

===U.S. Representative===
Curtin later switched to the Democratic Party, and served as a U.S. Representative from 1881 until 1887.

==Personal life==
On May 30, 1844, Curtin was married to Katharine Irvine Wilson (1821–1903), a daughter of Dr. William Irvine Wilson and Mary (née Potter) Wilson. Together, they were the parents of:

* Mary Curtin (1845–1927), who married George Fairlamb Harris.
* Martha Irvin Curtin (1848–1935), who married Captain Kidder Randolph Breese.
* Myron Stanley Curtin (1854–1857), who died young.
* Katherine Irvine Wilson Curtin (1859–1930), who married Moses Dewitt Burnet.
* Bessie Elliott Curtin (1865–1866), who died young.

==Death==
Curtin died at his birthplace on October 7, 1894, in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, and is buried there in Union Cemetery.

<text>Nathaniel Currier (March 27, 1813 – November 20, 1888) was an American lithographer. He headed the company Currier &amp; Ives with James Ives.

==Early life and education==
Currier was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, to Nathaniel and Hannah Currier. He attended public school until age fifteen, when he was apprenticed to the Boston printing firm of William and John Pendleton. 

==Career==
The Pendletons were the first successful lithographers in the United States, lithography having only recently been invented in Europe. Currier learned the process in their shop. In 1833, he subsequently went to work for M. E. D. Brown in Philadelphia, in 1833. The following year, in 1834, Currier moved to New York City, where he intended to start a new business with John Pendleton but Pendleton backed out, and the new firm became Currier &amp; Stodart and lasted only one year.

===Currier &amp; Ives===
In 1835, Currier started his own lithographic business as an eponymous sole proprietorship, initially engaged in standard lithographic business of printing sheet music, letterheads, handbills, and other publishing-related products. 

However, he soon took his work in a new direction, creating pictures of current events. In late 1835, he issued a print illustrating a recent fire in New York City, &quot;Ruins of the Merchant&#x27;s Exchange N.Y. after the Destructive Conflagration of Decbr 16 &amp; 17, 1835&quot; was published by the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, just four days after the fire, and was an early example of illustrated news. In 1840, Currier began to move away from job printing and into independent print publishing. In that year, &quot;The Sun&quot; published his print &quot;Awful Conflagration of the Steam Boat &#x27;Lexington&#x27; in Long Island Sound on Monday Eveg Jany 13th 1840, by Which Melancholy Occurrence Over 100 Persons Perished&quot;, another documentation of a news event, three days after the disaster; the print sold thousands of copies.

In 1850, James Ives went to work for Currier&#x27;s firm as bookkeeper. Ives&#x27; skills as a businessman and marketer contributed significantly to the growth of the company; in 1857 he was made a full partner, and the company became known as Currier &amp; Ives. 

Currier &amp; Ives are best known as creators of popular art prints, such as Christmas scenes, landscapes, or depictions of Victorian urban sophistication; however, the firm also produced political cartoons and banners, significant historical scenes, and further illustrations of current events. Over the decades, the firm created roughly 7,500 images.

Currier retired from his firm in 1880, and turned the business over to his son Edward.

==Personal life and death==
Currier married Eliza West Farnsworth in 1840. The couple had one child, Edward West Currier, the next year. Eliza died in 1843. In 1847, Currier married Lura Ormsbee.

In addition to being a lithographer, he was also a New York City volunteer fireman in the 1850s. 

He was a Unitarian.

Currier was a friend of P.T. Barnum of Barnum and Bailey fame.

Currier was fond of fast horses and kept several at a barn in his Massachusetts residence, which he purchased, ordered dismantled, and had delivered by horse to his estate.

Currier died eight years after retiring, on November 20, 1888, at his home on Lion&#x27;s Mouth Road in Amesbury, Massachusetts and is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

<doc id="741293" wikidata="Q44728" url="?curid=741293" title="Francis Arinze">
<text>Francis Arinze (born 1 November 1932) is a Nigerian cardinal of the Catholic Church. He was Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments from 2002 to 2008 and before that led the Secretariat for Non-Christians (later renamed the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue) from 1984 to 2002.

He has been a cardinal since 1985 and the Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni since 2005. Arinze was one of the principal advisors to Pope John Paul II and was considered &quot;papabile&quot; at the papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI in 2005.

==Early life==
Arinze was born in the tiny village of Eziowelle, Anambra, Nigeria, to a family of peasant farmers who practiced a local indigenous religion. He followed a brother in converting to Catholicism and he was baptized on 1 November 1941, his ninth birthday, by Father Michael Tansi, who was beatified by John Paul II in 1998. His parents later converted to Catholicism as well. At age 15, he entered All Hallows Seminary, Onitsha, and graduated with a philosophy degree in 1950. His father initially opposed his entering the seminary, but encouraged him when he saw how he enjoyed it. Arinze stayed at All Hallows until 1953 to teach. In 1955, he went to Rome to study theology at the Pontifical Urban University, where he earned a doctorate in sacred theology &quot;summa cum laude&quot;.

==Priest==
On 23 November 1958, at the chapel of the university, Arinze was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Gregorio Pietro Agagianian, pro-prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith.

After ordination, Arinze remained in Rome, earning a master&#x27;s in theology in 1959 and doctorate in 1960. His doctoral thesis on &quot;Ibo Sacrifice as an Introduction to the Catechesis of Holy Mass&quot; was the basis for his reference work, &quot;Sacrifice in Ibo Religion&quot;, published in 1970. From 1961 to 1962, Arinze was professor of liturgy, logic, and basic philosophy at Bigard Memorial Seminary in Enugu. He was then appointed regional secretary for Catholic education for the eastern part of Nigeria. He was then transferred to London, where he attended the Institute of Education and graduated in 1964.

== Bishop and archbishop ==
On 6 July 1965, Pope Paul VI appointed him titular bishop of Fissiana and coadjutor to Charles Heerey, archbishop of Onitsha, Nigeria. Arinze became the youngest Roman Catholic bishop in the world when Heerey consecrated him on 29 August 1965, at the age of 32. He attended the final session of the Second Vatican Council in 1965. Heerey died on 6 February 1967, and Pope Paul appointed Arinze to succeed him as archbishop on 26 June 1967. He was the first native African to head this archdiocese.

The Nigeria-Biafra War broke out just days after Arinze was named archbishop. The entire archdiocese was located in the secessionist Biafran territory. Arinze fled to Adazi and then Amichi until the war ended in 1970. Arinze spent these years aiding refugees and with the help of foreign missionaries supervised what one international relief worker called one of &quot;the most effective and efficient distributions of relief materials&quot; in history. He kept the Church independent of the warring factions. 

At the end of the war, the Nigerian government deported all foreign missionaries stationed in the archdiocese, leaving only the native clergy and religious, who were few in number. The government also confiscated the Catholic schools, most of which also served as churches or parish halls.

In 1985, he was awarded the chieftaincy title of the Ochudouwa of Eziowelle.

On 9 March 1985, Arinze resigned from his post in Onitsha.

==Cardinal==
Pope John Paul II named Arinze Cardinal-Deacon of San Giovanni della Pigna in the consistory held on 25 May 1985. After ten years he exercised his option to be raised to the rank of cardinal-priest, which Pope John Paul approved on 29 January 1996. Two days after he became a cardinal, Arinze was appointed president of the Secretariat for Non-Christians, which was renamed the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue in 1988.

He served in various related capacities including as the president of the Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops. He also received honours in this capacity: On 24 October 1999 he received a gold medallion from the International Council of Christians and Jews for his outstanding achievements in inter-faith relations. He traveled extensively and became a popular speaker in the United States.

Arinze was a member of the Committee of the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000. In that capacity, he worked closely with individual bishops and priests throughout the world in preparation for the rare celebration of the Church. On 1 October 2002, Pope John Paul II named him prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments.

When Pope John Paul II died on 2 April 2005, all major Vatican officials – including Arinze – automatically lost their positions. He was considered &quot;papabile&quot;, that is, a candidate for election to the papacy, at the papal conclave that followed, in which he was a cardinal elector. He returned to his post as prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship when confirmed by Pope Benedict XVI on 21 April 2005, and on 25 April Benedict XVI named him Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni, a post which Benedict himself had held until his election as Pope.

On 9 December 2008 Benedict accepted Arinze&#x27;s resignation as prefect of the Congregation of Divine Worship.

==In retirement==
Arinze remains active and in 2009 gave the commencement address at the Augustine Institute in Denver. He actively catechises via Familyland TV to the Americas, the Philippines, Africa, and Europe. He has produced over 1,700 television programs with the Apostolate for Family Consecration. The programs cover almost all of Pope John Paul II&#x27;s encyclicals and apostolic letters, the teachings of the Second Vatican Council, and many other topics. In July 2009, he delivered a major speech promoting interreligious dialogue at The City Club of Cleveland. He is also the author of several books, along with a complete &quot;Consecration and Truth Catechetical Program&quot; for children and adults.

In May 2018, he addressed the ongoing controversies about granting access to the Eucharist. He objected to any interpretation of Pope Francis&#x27; &quot;Amoris Laetitia&quot; that would allow a Catholic remarried without an annulment to receive communion as an act of mercy saying that Christ saw that condition as adultery and &quot;We cannot be more merciful than Christ.&quot; With respect to the proposal endorsed by many German bishops to allow the Protestant spouses of Catholics to receive communion, he said that it was not a question of &quot;hospitality&quot; and the celebration of Mass is &quot;not an ecumenical service&quot;. He would say to such a Protestant: &quot;Come, be received into the Church, and then you can receive Holy Communion seven times a week. Otherwise no.&quot;

==Honors==
He has received honorary degrees from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, in 1986, the Catholic University of America in 1998, Wake Forest University in 1999, the Catholic University of Manila in 2001, Notre Dame University in 2003, the University of St. Mary of the Lake in 2003, and Seton Hall University in 2005.

On 5 October 2021, a center for peace and reconciliation was established in Arinze&#x27;s name in Nigeria.

<text>Francis Earl Curran (December 19, 1912 – October 18, 1992) was an American Democratic politician from California.

==Biography==
Frank Curran was born in 1912 in Cleveland, Ohio. His father was a boxer under the name &quot;Red Kenney&quot; and operated a wallpaper-hanging business. The family moved to Oceanside, California, in 1919. Curran met his wife Florance on the Oceanside Pier and they were married in 1936. She was born 1913 in Denver.

Curran was elected to the San Diego City Council and served from 1955–1963. He was elected mayor of San Diego in 1962, and served between 1963 and 1971. During his term, the Civic Center was built and a ballot issue passed to build a new stadium in Mission Valley as well as a metropolitan sewer system. He said &quot;If we hadn&#x27;t built that, we couldn&#x27;t have done anything else.&quot; At the end of his term Curran was embroiled in the &quot;Yellow Cab&quot; bribery scandal. It was alleged he raised taxi rates for campaign contributions. He and seven city council members were indicted. Curran was cleared by a jury, but could not escape the charge politically. He did not resign, but his hopes of running again for any office were lost. After Curran left as mayor he continued to be active in civic affairs. He was director for the Central City Association.

Curran died in 1992 after suffering from a broken vertebra and is buried at Eternal Hills Memorial Park. His wife Florance died January 4, 2000. Curran&#x27;s brother Richard was a Municipal Court judge.

<doc id="741319" wikidata="Q1459674" url="?curid=741319" title="Michael Joseph Curley">
<text>Michael Joseph Curley (October 12, 1879 – May 16, 1947) was an Irish-born American Catholic prelate who served as the first Archbishop of Washington from 1939 to 1947. He previously served as Archbishop of Baltimore (1921–1947) and as Bishop of St. Augustine (1914–1921).

Curley was known for his militancy in protecting the rights of Catholics and of his dioceses against perceived and real attacks from outside forces. As Bishop of St. Augustine, he fought anti-Catholic efforts by the State of Florida and the Jesuits to claim what he felt was his rightful authority. 

As Archbishop of Baltimore and later Washington, he denounced the oppression of Catholic clergy in Mexico and Spain and of Jews in Germany. Curley is also known for his strong program of school construction in the Archdiocese of Baltimore.

==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===
One of eleven children, Michael Curley was born on October 12, 1879, in Athlone, County Westmeath, Ireland to Michael and Maria (née Ward) Curley. He attended a primary school in Athlone that was run by the Marist Brothers. At age 16, Curley entered Mungret College in Limerick, Ireland. While at Mungret, Curley wanted to eventually become a missionary to the Fiji Islands. However, after speaking with Bishop John Moore during a school visit, Curley decided instead to go to the Diocese of St. Augustine in the United States after he finished his education.

After graduating from Mungret, Curley entered the Royal University of Ireland, earning a Bachelor of Arts in 1900. He then travelled to Rome to study at the Urban College of the Propaganda, receiving a Licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1903. His ordination was postponed until 1904 due to stress.

=== Priesthood ===
On March 19, 1904, Curley was ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of Saint Augustine by Cardinal Pietro Respighi in the Basilica of St. John Lateran in Rome. He arrived in Florida in 1904, and was named pastor of St. Peter&#x27;s Parish in DeLand, Florida. He lived in a rented room above a store and ate in a local diner.

In 1914, Bishop William Kenny appointed Curley as chancellor of the diocese and as his personal secretary. 

=== Bishop of Saint Augustine ===

On April 3, 1914, Pope Pius X appointed Curley as the fourth bishop of St. Augustine. He received his episcopal consecration at the Cathedral of Saint Augustine on June 30, 1914, from Bishop Benjamin Keiley, with Bishops Patrick Donahue and Owen Corrigan serving as co-consecrators. At age 34, Curley was the youngest bishop in the country. He spent eight months out of every year on journeys throughout the diocese.

In 1913, the Florida Legislature passed legislation prohibiting white women from teaching African-American children in schools. At that time, the diocese had white nuns teaching in four schools for African-Americans in St. Augustine, Fernandina, Jacksonville, and Ybor City. Considering the law unconstitutional, the bishop at the time, William Kenny, told the sisters to ignore it. In a 1915 letter to the parishes in the diocese, Curley wrote:We Catholics of the United States are victims of organized vilification and the government itself [through the mails] takes a hand by the distribution of lewd and lascivious anti-Catholic filth. It is high time for the sixteen million Catholics of the United States to assert their rights and claim that protection which their citizenship and demonstrated loyalty should guarantee them.”On April 24, 1916, Florida Governor Park Trammell ordered the arrest of three Sisters of St. Joseph for violating the law. When one of the sisters refused to post bond, she was put under house arrest at her convent. Curley vigorously attacked the sisters&#x27; arrests, portraying them as a state-sponsored campaign against Catholic schools in Florida. He gained strong support from other Catholic prelates in the United States. Curley attracted national attention in 1917 by battling a bill in the Florida Legislature mandating state inspections of convents. Curley refused to comply with it. He led a successful legal campaign to have the law declared unconstitutional. He also sought to educate Floridians about Catholicism and demonstrate the bigotry of the Ku Klux Klan.

During World War I, Curley was a strong supporter of the American war effort. In 1917, he established the diocesan Catholic War Council, a group that gave spiritual guidance to Florida&#x27;s Catholic soldiers. He spoke at Liberty Bond rallies. At the end of the war, Curley celebrated a large memorial mass for soldiers who died in the war at Battery Park in New York City. By the end of his tenure as bishop of St. Augustine, the Catholic population in the diocese had grown from 39,000 to 41,000, with 40 new churches built.

In 1919, Curley appealed to Bishop Giovanni Bonzano, apostolic delegate to the United States, to end an agreement between the diocese and the Society of Jesus. In 1889, Bishop John Moore had asked the Jesuits to build Catholic missions and churches in Southwest Florida from Tampa Bay to Key West. Curley wanted them to surrender control of the area, along with Jesuit property, to the diocese. In 1921, the Vatican approved an agreement that gave the diocese jurisdiction over the region, but allowed the Jesuits to keep their property.

===Archbishop of Baltimore===

On August 10, 1921, Pope Benedict XV named Curley as the tenth archbishop of Baltimore. His installation took place on November 30, 1921. His arrival in his new city was described as &quot;one of the greatest welcomes ever tendered a new citizen of Baltimore.&quot; During his tenure in Baltimore, Curley spent $30 million building 66 schools in 18 years, placing the importance of constructing schools over churches. In 1926, he declared, 
&quot;I defy any system of grammar school education in the United States to prove itself superior to the system that is being maintained in the Archdiocese of Baltimore.&quot; 
Curley also established archdiocesan offices for Catholic Charities (1923) and for the Society for the Propagation of the Faith (1925). In 1922, in an article in the &quot;Gaelic American&quot; during the Irish Civil War, Curley criticized the Irish politician Éamon de Valera for causing violence in Ireland, comparing him to the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa. In March 1926, Curley criticized the expropriation of Catholic Church property by the Mexican Government and the expulsion of foreign priests and nuns from Mexico:In order to preach the doctrine of Jesus Christ in Mexico, one must be a Mexican by birth. If the Savior of the world came back to Mexico, he would be exiled forthwith...because he is not a born Mexican.In the mid-1920s, many clergy became concerned about the spiritual well-being of the large number of Catholic students attending non-Catholic colleges. This prompted the establishment of the Newman Club movement, Catholic centers at these institutions. However, Curley denounced the movement, believing that Catholic youth belonged in Catholic universities only. He made these remarks in 1925: The men backing the so-called Catholic Foundation Plan are waging a secret hypocritical warfare against the best interests of the Church in America. They are honest. They remind us of the Modernists who were bent on destroying the Church from within. The latter attacked the Church&#x27;s teachings. The Foundationists attack the Church&#x27;s right to educate. In fact, they pose as friends of the Church when they tell her to throw her millions of children into an atmosphere of destructive secularism in order that they may be educated.In 1931, Pope Pius XI appointed Curley as an assistant to the papal throne; he was later named a member of the College of Patriarchs and Bishops. Curley celebrated the mass at the end of the 1932 Eucharistic Congress in Dublin. Combative by nature, Curley exemplified the militancy of many American bishops and archbishops during the 1920s and 1930s:
* Condemning the foreign policy of US President Franklin Roosevelt
* Protesting the anti-Semitic policies of Nazi Germany in 1933
* Criticizing the American film industry in 1934 for producing what he called filthy films. He vigorously fought efforts in Baltimore to open movie theaters on Sunday.
* Calling upon American bishops to conduct a study of the influences of communism in the United States. 
* Terming policies of the Second Spanish Republic in 1939 as anti-clerical, blaming it for the deaths of hundreds of Spanish priests and nuns. 
In 1934, an article in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; compared the ruthlessness of Adolf Hitler to the Catholic theologian Ignatius of Loyola. After receiving complaints from several Jesuit priests, the &quot;Sun&quot; printed an apology. Unhappy over what he perceived as slights by the newspaper, Curley demanded a fuller apology and threatened a subscriber boycott. While Curley was visiting Ireland, the &quot;Sun&quot; worked out a quiet settlement with the archdiocese.

=== Archbishop of Baltimore and Washington ===

On July 22, 1939, Pope Pius XII separated Washington, D.C., from the Archdiocese of Baltimore to form the new Archdiocese of Washington. While allowing Curley to retain his position as archbishop of Baltimore, the pope appointed him as the first archbishop of Washington. He governed the two archdioceses as a single unit.

In March 1941, Curley sued Loyola College in Baltimore and its president, Reverend Edward Bunn, over a bequest in a will. In 1937, Frances Stuart, a Catholic philanthropist, had written a will naming the archdiocese as a beneficiary. When Bunn arrived in Baltimore in 1938, he became a spiritual counselor to Stuart. In January 1940, in declining health, she revised her will, using a lawyer suggested by Bunn. In the new will, Stuart added Loyola College as a beneficiary and dropped the archdiocese. She died a few days later. In early 1940, Bunn tried to negotiate a lawsuit settlement with Curley, but he refused it. In February 1941, Curley demanded Bunn&#x27;s firing as part of a settlement. In May 1941, a jury ruled that Stuart&#x27;s second will was valid.

In December 1941, Curley made an inappropriate remark to a reporter about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th. His opponents in the Catholic hierarchy persuaded the apostolic delegate to the United States, Bishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, to reprimand him. From then on, Curley avoided any political comments.

Although his predecessor in Baltimore, Archbishop James Gibbons, was appointed cardinal, Curley never received the same distinction.

=== Death and legacy ===
By 1943, after an operation for a detached retina, Curley had given up his public appearances. Curley suffered from sinusitis, shingles, and high blood pressure. A series of strokes caused him to have partial paralysis and blindness. 

Curley died at Bon Secours Hospital in Baltimore from a stroke on May 16, 1947, at age 67. He is interred in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Baltimore. After Curley&#x27;s death, Pius XII appointed separate archbishops for Baltimore (Bishop Francis Keough) and Washington (Bishop Patrick O&#x27;Boyle).

Archbishop Curley High School in Baltimore, founded in 1960, was named after Curley.

<text>Ève Denise Curie Labouisse (; December 6, 1904 – October 22, 2007) was a French and American writer, journalist and pianist. Ève Curie was the younger daughter of Marie Skłodowska-Curie and Pierre Curie. Her sister was Irène Joliot-Curie and her brother-in-law Frédéric Joliot-Curie. She worked as a journalist and authored her mother&#x27;s biography &quot;Madame Curie&quot; and a book of war reportage, &quot;Journey Among Warriors&quot;. From the 1960s she committed herself to work for UNICEF, providing help to children and mothers in developing countries. Ève was the only member of her family who did not choose a career as a scientist and did not win a Nobel Prize, although her husband, Henry Richardson Labouisse Jr., did collect the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965 on behalf of UNICEF, completing the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prize winners.

== Childhood ==

Ève Denise Curie was born in Paris, France, on December 6, 1904. She was the younger daughter of the scientists Marie and Pierre Curie, who also had another daughter Irène (born 1897). Ève did not know her father, who died in 1906 in an accident, run over by a horse cart. After this accident, Marie Curie accepted her husband&#x27;s teaching position at La Sorbonne. Her father-in-law, Dr. Eugène Curie, had moved in with the family when his wife died, and he took care of the children while Pierre and Marie, and then Marie only, went to work. When he died in 1910, Marie Curie remained alone to bring up her daughters with the help of governesses. Even though Ève confessed later that as a child she had suffered from a lack of sufficient attention of her mother and that only later, in her teens, she developed a stronger emotional bond to her, Marie took great care for the education and development of interests of both her daughters. Whereas Irène followed in her mother&#x27;s footsteps and became an eminent scientist (she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with her husband Frédéric Joliot-Curie in 1935), Ève showed more artistic and literary interests. Even as a child she displayed a particular talent for music.

Whatever the weather, they went on long walks and rode on bikes. They went swimming in summer, and Marie had gymnastics equipment installed in the garden of their house in Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine. Ève and Irène also learned sewing, gardening and cooking.

Although the girls were French nationals (Ève later became an American citizen), and their first language was French, they were familiar with their Polish origin and spoke Polish. In 1911 they visited Poland (the southern part, which was then under Austrian rule). During their visit to Poland, they also rode horses and hiked in the mountains.

== Youth ==
In 1921, Ève set off on her first journey across the Atlantic Ocean: that spring, she sailed with her sister and mother on board the ship RMS &quot;Olympic&quot; to New York City. Marie Curie, as a two-time laureate of the Nobel Prize, the discoverer of radium and polonium, was welcomed there with all due ceremony; her daughters were also very popular with American high society. Radiant at parties and joyous, Ève was dubbed by the press &quot;the girl with radium eyes&quot;. During the trip Ève and Irène also acted as their mother&#x27;s &quot;bodyguards&quot; – Marie, usually focused on research work and preferring a simple life, did not always feel comfortable facing the homage paid to her. While in the United States, Marie, Irène and Ève met President Warren G. Harding in Washington, D.C., saw Niagara Falls and went by train to see the Grand Canyon. They returned to Paris in June 1921.

Ève, like her sister Irène, graduated from the Collège Sévigné, a non denominational private high school in Paris, where she obtained her baccalaureate in 1925. Meanwhile, she also improved her piano skills and gave her first concert in Paris in 1925. Later, she performed on stage many times, giving concerts in the French capital, in the provinces and in Belgium.

After Irène married Frédéric Joliot in 1926, Ève stayed with her mother in Paris, taking care of her and accompanying her on trips throughout France, Italy, Belgium, and Switzerland. In 1932, they also accompanied the President of Czechoslovakia, Tomáš Masaryk, on his trip to Spain.

Although she loved her mother, Ève had a quite different personality from her (and from her sister Irène). She was not interested in science, preferring the humanities. Unlike her mother, she was always attracted by refined life. Whereas Marie usually wore simple, black dresses, Ève always cared about smart clothes, wore high-heeled shoes and make-up, and loved shining at parties. However, both Ève and Irène nursed their mother with devotion until her death. Marie, ill with aplastic anemia, probably caused by her long-term exposure to ionizing radiation, died on July 4, 1934.

==After mother&#x27;s death==
After Marie Curie&#x27;s death, Ève decided to express her love by writing a biography. To this end, she temporarily withdrew from social life and moved to a small flat in Auteuil, Yvelines, where she gathered and sorted documents and letters left by Marie. In Autumn 1935, she visited her family in Poland, looking for information about her mother&#x27;s childhood and youth. The fruit of this work was the biography &quot;Madame Curie&quot;, simultaneously published in France, Britain, Italy, Spain, the United States and other countries in 1937.

&quot;Madame Curie&quot; was instantly popular; in many countries including the United States, it was a bestseller. In the U.S. it won the third annual National Book Award for Non-Fiction
voted by the American Booksellers Association.
There was a film adaptation in 1943 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, with Greer Garson in the title role.

Ève became more and more engaged in literary and journalistic work. Apart from her mother&#x27;s biography, she published musical reviews in the &quot;Candide&quot; weekly and articles on theater, music, and film in other Paris newspapers.

== Second World War ==
After the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the novelist and playwright Jean Giraudoux, who had become the French Information Commissioner (&quot;Commissaire général à l&#x27;information&quot;) in the same year, appointed Ève Curie head of the feminine division in his office. After Germany invaded France, Ève left Paris on June 11, 1940, and after the surrender of France, fled with other refugees to England on board an overcrowded ship, which was strafed by German aircraft. There she joined the Free French Forces of General Charles de Gaulle and started her active fight against Nazism, which resulted in the Vichy government&#x27;s depriving her of French nationality and confiscating her property in 1941.

Ève Curie spent most of the war years in Britain, where she met Winston Churchill, and the United States, where she gave lectures and wrote articles to American newspapers (mostly the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;). In 1940 she met Eleanor Roosevelt at the White House. Inspired by this visit, she later gave a series of lectures on &quot;French Women and the War&quot;; in May 1940 &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; published her essay under the same title.

From November 1941 to April 1942, Ève Curie traveled as a war correspondent to Africa, the Soviet Union and Asia, where she witnessed the British offensive in Egypt and Libya in December 1941 and the Soviet counter-offensive at Moscow in January 1942. During this journey she met the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the leader of Free China, Chiang Kai-shek, fighting the Japanese, and Mahatma Gandhi. Several times she had the opportunity to meet her half-compatriots, Polish soldiers, who fought on the side of the British or organized the Polish Army in the Soviet Union.

Curie&#x27;s reports from this journey were published in American newspapers, and in 1943 they were gathered in the book &quot;Journey Among Warriors&quot;, which was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence in 1944 (eventually losing to Ernie Pyle). An article in the autumn 1943 issue of &quot;The Russian Review&quot; critiqued Curie&#x27;s book. The reviewer, Michael Karpovich, complimented her enthusiastic and sympathetic style of writing about people she met and interviewed in the Soviet Union. However, Karpovich felt that Curie did
not characterize believably the Russians she described. In &quot;Journey Among Warriors&quot; she wrote about her conversations with a Greek Orthodox bishop, a noted ballerina, a Red Army general, factory workers, local communist leaders, and scientists. Karpovich thought that Curie&#x27;s exuberance distorted both her judgment and her vision, in her book.

After her return to Europe, Ève Curie served as a volunteer in the women&#x27;s medical corps of the Free French during the Italian Campaign, where she was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in the French 1st Armored Division. In August 1944 she took part in landing with her troops in Provence in southern France. She was decorated with the Croix de guerre for her services.

== After the war ==
After the liberation of France, Ève Curie first worked as a co-editor of the daily newspaper &quot;Paris-Presse&quot; from 1944 to 1949, but was also active in the political sphere. For example, she was responsible for women&#x27;s affairs in de Gaulle&#x27;s government, and in 1948 along with other prominent European intellectuals, she appealed to the United Nations for recognition of the state of Israel. In the years 1952–1954, she was a special advisor to Hastings Lionel Ismay, the first Secretary General of NATO. On 19 November 1954 she married the American politician and diplomat Henry Richardson Labouisse Jr., who served as the United States Ambassador to Greece from 1962 to 1965. Ève Curie became an American citizen in 1958.

== Work for UNICEF ==
In 1965, Ève&#x27;s husband gave up his job in the U.S. government when the Secretary General of the United Nations U Thant offered him the position of the executive director of the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund UNICEF. Labouisse held this office until 1979, actively supported by his wife, who also worked for the organization and was often called &quot;the First Lady of UNICEF&quot;. Together, they visited more than 100 countries, mostly in the Third World, which were beneficiaries of UNICEF&#x27;s help. In 1965, Labouisse, accompanied by his wife, accepted the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to his organization.

== Last years of life ==
After her husband&#x27;s death in 1987, Ève lived in New York City. She had no children from her marriage to Henry Labouisse, but she had a stepdaughter, Anne Peretz (Labouisse&#x27;s only daughter, born of his first marriage), and all of Anne Peretz&#x27; children considered her their grandmother and their children considered her their great-grandmother.

In December 2004, Ève Curie celebrated her one-hundredth birthday. On this occasion, she was visited in her New York flat by the Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan. She also received congratulatory letters from the Presidents of the United States – George W. Bush – and France – Jacques Chirac.

In July 2005, Ève Curie Labouisse was promoted for her work in UNICEF to the rank of &#x27;Officier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur&#x27; of the Republic of France – the country&#x27;s highest decoration. She expressed thanks for the decoration, saying:

She sometimes joked that she brought shame on her family. &quot;There were five Nobel Prizes in my family&quot;, she joked, &quot;two for my mother, one for my father, one for [my] sister and brother-in-law and one for my husband. Only I was not successful...&quot;.

Ève Curie died in her sleep on 22 October 2007 in her residence on Sutton Place in Manhattan. She was 102 years old.
Ann Veneman, the executive director of UNICEF, said after her death:

<doc id="741333" wikidata="Q137756" url="?curid=741333" title="130 Elektra">
<text>130 Elektra is a large outer main-belt asteroid and quadruple system with three minor-planet moons. It was discovered on 17 February 1873, by astronomer Christian Peters at Litchfield Observatory, New York, and named after Electra, an avenger in Greek mythology.

== Description ==
(130) Elektra has the spectrum of a G-type asteroid; hence it probably has a Ceres-like surface. Spectral signatures of organic compounds have been seen on Elektra&#x27;s surface and it displays evidence of aqueous alteration.

In the late 1990s, a network of astronomers worldwide gathered lightcurve data that was ultimately used to derive the spin states and shape models of 10 new asteroids, including (130) Elektra. The light curve of (130) Elektra forms a double sinusoid while the shape model is elongated and the derived rotation axis is perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic.

Optical observations have found three satellites of this asteroid. Once the orbits are known, Elektra&#x27;s mass can be reliably found. The value of 6.6 ×  kg indicates a density of . Optical observations have also determined that Elektra&#x27;s shape is quite irregular, as well as giving indications of albedo differences of 5–15% on its surface.

== Occultations ==

Elektra has been observed to pass in front of a dozen stars since 2007, most notably on 21 April 2018 when over 30 mostly citizen astronomers spread across five European countries recorded the sudden drop in light of an 11th magnitude star. The sky-plane plot of the chords reveals a peanut-shaped body, possibly the result of a two-body merger early in the history of the Solar System.
== Satellites ==

Elektra has three orbiting natural satellites, all of which are unnamed and measure a few kilometres across. Together with the primary body Elektra, they comprise a quadruple system. Given their similar spectra, these satellites are thought to be fragments of Elektra that were created from a disruptive impact. , Elektra has the most satellites of any main-belt asteroid, and is the only known quadruple asteroid system in the Solar System. All three satellites are faint and orbit closely to Elektra, which makes them difficult to observe due to Elektra&#x27;s bright glare obscuring them. The largest telescopes with adaptive optics systems and advanced image processing techniques are required for detailed study of the satellites&#x27; properties.

=== S/2003 (130) 1 ===
 is the largest and outermost satellite of Elektra, around in diameter, assuming the same albedo as the primary. It was discovered on 15 August 2003, by a team of astronomers led by W. J. Merline using the Keck II telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii. The discovery images showed that the satellite had an apparent magnitude difference of 8.5 in the near-infrared K-band. The team confirmed the existence of the satellite after reobserving it with the Keck II telescope on 17 August 2003. The discovery was announced on that same day and the satellite was given the provisional designation .

 orbits from Elektra with a period of 5.3 days. Its orbit has a moderate eccentricity of 0.08 and an inclination of 160° with respect to the celestial equator. Preliminary simulations of the Elektra system show that &#x27;s semi-major axis oscillates less than over 20 years. Near-infrared observations from December 2014 show that along with display a similar spectrum to Elektra, supporting the hypothesis that they are fragments from a disruptive collision.

=== S/2014 (130) 1 ===

 is the second satellite of Elektra by distance and order of discovery. It was discovered on 6 December 2014, by a team of astronomers led by B. Yang using the SPHERE adaptive optics system on the Very Large Telescope&#x27;s Melipal (UT3) telescope at Cerro Paranal, Chile. Discovery observations showed that the satellite had a near-infrared magnitude difference of 10, corresponding to a diameter of about if it has the same albedo as the primary. The discovery was announced on 16 December 2014, but the satellite was mistakenly designated before being immediately corrected to .

 orbits from Elektra with a period of 1.2 days—about two and a half times closer and four times quicker than the outer satellite Its roughly-circular orbit is inclined 156° with respect to the celestial equator. Preliminary simulations of the Elektra system show that &#x27;s semi-major axis oscillates less than over 20 years. Near-infrared observations from December 2014 show that along with display a similar spectrum to Elektra.

=== Third satellite ===
On 6 November 2021, astronomers A. Berdeu, M. Langlois, and F. Vachier reported the discovery of a third, closer-in satellite in archival VLT-SPHERE images taken between 9 and 31 December 2014, making Elektra the first quadruple system discovered and imaged in the main asteroid belt. This third satellite, which remains undesignated, had eluded discovery when the images were taken, due to its faintness and close proximity to Elektra&#x27;s bright glare. For these reasons, it had to be measured through image subtraction of Elektra&#x27;s bright glare. The satellite measures roughly in diameter, based on a near-infrared magnitude difference of 10.5. The satellite has been identified in later VLT images from February 2016 and July–August 2019.

With a semi-major axis of and an orbital period of , it is the innermost companion of the Elektra system. In contrast to the two outer satellites, its orbit is remarkably eccentric and inclined; it has a high eccentricity of 0.33 and an inclination about 38° with respect to Elektra&#x27;s spin axis (129° with respect to the celestial equator). The satellite&#x27;s close proximity to Elektra makes its orbit subject to perturbations by shape-induced irregularities in Elektra&#x27;s gravitational field (see geopotential model), which may account for most of the uncertainties in its Keplerian orbit.

<text>Randall Wade Cunningham Sr. (born March 27, 1963) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 16 seasons. He spent the majority of his career with the Philadelphia Eagles and is also known for his Minnesota Vikings tenure. A four-time Pro Bowl selection, Cunningham is fourth in NFL quarterback rushing yards, which he led at the time of his retirement.

Cunningham played college football for the UNLV Rebels, earning first-team All-American honors in 1983 and 1984 as a punter. He was selected in the second round of the 1985 NFL draft by the Eagles, where he spent his first 11 seasons. He retired after the 1995 season, but returned a year later to join the Vikings. In 1998, he enjoyed the strongest season of his career and helped the team set the NFL record for the most regular season points scored en route to the 1998 NFC Championship Game appearance. Cunningham lost his starting position during the 1999 season due to a performance decline and was released afterwards. In his final two seasons, he held a backup role with the Dallas Cowboys and Baltimore Ravens.

Upon retiring a second and final time, Cunningham became an ordained Protestant minister and served as the team chaplain for the Las Vegas Raiders from 2020 to 2022. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2016.

==Early life and college==
Cunningham was born in Santa Barbara, California, in 1963. His older brother Sam would also become a future NFL player. He attended Santa Barbara High School, and was a graduate of the class of 1981. As a senior, he led his team to a League title and the CIF Finals. He also competed in track and field at SBHS in the high jump; his elder brother Frank was the state champion in the shot put.

He then went on to attend the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). He was a 1983 and 1984 College Football All-America Team selection as a punter. In 1984, his senior year, he led the UNLV Rebels to an 11–2 season—however this was adjusted to 0–13 when it was found out several players were ineligible.

==Professional career==
===Philadelphia Eagles===
Cunningham was the Eagles&#x27; second-round pick, and the first quarterback selected in the 1985 NFL draft. Cunningham was also sought by the United States Football League&#x27;s Tampa Bay Bandits that same year. Eagles owner Norman Braman refused to negotiate with Cunningham if he accepted offers from the Bandits. Ultimately, the USFL folded, thus ending that issue. In his rookie season he played sparingly as a backup to veteran Ron Jaworski but made a big splash with his uncanny scrambling ability, though he completed just 34 percent of his passes and threw just one touchdown against eight interceptions. In 1986, new head coach Buddy Ryan arrived in Philadelphia and made wholesale changes, many of them unorthodox, mostly due to his defensive-minded philosophy. At the quarterback position, Ryan designated 35-year-old Ron Jaworski the starter but would replace the veteran with the fleet-footed Cunningham in third-and-long situations where the latter&#x27;s scrambling would presumably put the defense on its heels. After a hand injury to Jaworski in week 10, Cunningham would replace him as the Eagles&#x27; starter. Despite his limited service and speed, the Eagles&#x27; porous offensive line allowed him to be sacked a franchise record (and NFL record at the time) 72 times that season. Cunningham was permanently handed the Eagles&#x27; starting job for the 1987 season. Cunningham was said to have reached &quot;elite&quot; status during the 1988 season, as he was elected by league players as the NFC starting quarterback for the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl (the first black quarterback to ever be elected a starter). That same year, he combined with fellow Eagle Pro Bowler Reggie White to lead the Eagles to the NFC Eastern Division Championship. In the 1988 Divisional Playoffs, Cunningham threw 54 passes for 407 yards during the &quot;Fog Bowl&quot; 20–12 loss against the Chicago Bears, both of which remain playoff franchise records. He also shares the franchise record with 3 interceptions in that same game. In the subsequent Pro Bowl a few weeks later, Cunningham was named game MVP as the NFC defeated the AFC, 28–3.

In 1989, on October 2 Cunningham also set the regular season franchise record with 62 pass attempts (now shared with Nick Foles), also against the Chicago Bears. He had been an all-conference quarterback and punter while at UNLV, and unleashed a 91-yard punt against the Giants on December 3, the longest in Eagles history (and the fourth-longest ever). He had 20 punts during his career, with an average of 44.7 yards per punt.

In a 1990 game against the Buffalo Bills, Cunningham, throwing from his end zone, was about to be sacked by Bruce Smith from his blind side. Cunningham ducked and threw a pass 60 yards to wide receiver Fred Barnett, resulting in a 95-yard touchdown. That same year, Cunningham finished with 942 rushing yards, the 2nd most ever for a quarterback at the time(Just 26yds short of the all-time record, set by Bobby Douglass in 1972) and 10th best in the league. He averaged 8.0 yards per rush, the most ever by an Eagle of any position with 100 attempts on the season, and third most in NFL history.

In 1991, Cunningham&#x27;s season came to an abrupt end when he was tackled by Bryce Paup of the Green Bay Packers and tore his anterior cruciate ligament in the first game of the season. He would return to the Eagles completely healed the following season, and led the team to its first playoff victory in 12 years. However, it was evident that the injury he suffered took away much of his speed and athleticism. The 1993 and 1994 seasons would be riddled by a series of nagging injuries and a transition to the West Coast Offense that eventually led to his benching in favor of veteran Rodney Peete. Feeling as if the fans and organization did not fully appreciate his contributions to the team&#x27;s success, as well as being unhappy with his role as a back-up, Cunningham retired from football after the 1995 season.

He left Philadelphia with the third-most rushing yards in Eagles history (4,482), trailing Hall of Famer Steve Van Buren and Wilbert Montgomery, but has since fallen to sixth after Duce Staley, Brian Westbrook, and LeSean McCoy all surpassed him. He also left second only to Ron Jaworski in passing yards, with 22,877, though both were later surpassed by Donovan McNabb. He still holds the Eagles record with 6.62 yards per rush attempt, 422 sacks taken, and 6.5 yards per pass attempt in playoff games.

===Minnesota Vikings===
Cunningham joined the Vikings in 1997 after being out of football in 1996. Vikings&#x27; coach Dennis Green called him when he was on a job site for his granite business. There he reunited with former Eagles wide receiver Cris Carter. In his first year with the Vikings, he orchestrated two late scoring drives to bring them back from a 9-point deficit to defeat the New York Giants in an NFC Wild Card game at Giants Stadium, 23–22. However, the Vikings lost in the Divisional Round to Steve Young and the San Francisco 49ers.

Cunningham enjoyed the greatest season of his career in Minnesota during the 1998 campaign when he guided the Vikings to a 15–1 regular season record with 34 touchdown passes, only 10 interceptions, and 3,704 passing yards. Cunningham had a good supporting cast that year with Cris Carter, rookie Randy Moss, and Jake Reed at wide receiver and Robert Smith and Leroy Hoard at running back. Cunningham led the league with a 106.0 passer rating while the Vikings scored a then-NFL record 556 points during the 1998 season, making him the first black quarterback to lead the league in that category. Cunningham claimed the Vikings&#x27; Monday night 37–24 victory over the Green Bay Packers was &quot;the greatest night of my football career&quot;. He threw for 442 yards and four touchdowns. However, the Vikings ended up being the first 15–1 team to fall short of the Super Bowl, losing to the underdog Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship Game by a field goal in overtime.

During the early stages of the 1999 season, after throwing nine interceptions in just six games, Cunningham was benched again, this time in favor of Jeff George. After the team announced that second-year quarterback Daunte Culpepper would be the starter prior to the 2000 season, Cunningham was released.

===Dallas Cowboys===
Shortly before the 2000 season, Cunningham signed with the Dallas Cowboys to serve as backup to Troy Aikman. After a series of concussions ended Aikman&#x27;s season, and ultimately his career, Cunningham again took the helm at quarterback. Despite posting a 1–2 record as a starter, he put up respectable numbers (849 yards passing with 6 touchdowns and 4 interceptions). One notable occurrence during his time with the Cowboys was a return to Philadelphia. Cunningham started the game and dueled the new Eagles quarterback, Donovan McNabb. The game was decided in overtime, with an Eagles field goal giving them the 16–13 victory. He received a mixed reception of cheers and boos upon his return to Philadelphia. A 5–11 subpar year for the Cowboys led to major roster changes, and Cunningham was one of the many changes. At the end of the season, he reached incentive clauses that voided his contract and made him an unrestricted free agent. He was not re-signed, after the Cowboys signed quarterback Tony Banks instead.

===Baltimore Ravens===
On May 29, 2001, he was signed by the Baltimore Ravens, reuniting with head coach Brian Billick, who was his offensive coordinator with the Minnesota Vikings. Cunningham was originally intended to serve as the third-string quarterback, but he was named the backup behind Elvis Grbac after performing better than Chris Redman. He went 2–0 as a starter. He was not re-signed, after the Ravens signed quarterback Jeff Blake instead. On August 15, 2002, Cunningham signed a one-day contract with the Philadelphia Eagles to officially announce his retirement.

In his final 10 NFL seasons, Cunningham played in only 80 games, but finished his 16-year career completing 2,429 of his 4,289 attempts for 29,979 yards and 207 touchdowns, with 134 interceptions. He was sacked 484 times, third-most all time behind (2nd) John Elway with 516 sacks, and (1st) Brett Favre with 525 sacks. Cunningham also rushed for 4,928 yards on 775 carries and 35 touchdowns. He retired after the 2001 season as the NFL&#x27;s all-time leader in rushing yards and carries for the quarterback position, (a record broken in 2011 by Michael Vick), and tied for fourth with Steve Grogan in rushing touchdowns by a quarterback. Cunningham also averaged 30.6 rushing yards per game during his career—second most all-time for quarterbacks, behind Michael Vick.

==After retiring==
After retiring from football, Cunningham returned to UNLV to finish his college degree in Leisure Studies. Cunningham has also been active in the Gospel music business since his retirement from the NFL by opening a recording studio and producing Christian worship music. Cunningham, a born again Christian, became an ordained Protestant minister and founded a church called Remnant Ministries in Las Vegas in 2004. In 2020, Cunningham became the team chaplain for the Las Vegas Raiders, replacing former team chaplain Napoleon Kaufman, who stayed in Oakland when the team moved to Las Vegas.

In December 2009, Cunningham was hired by Silverado High School in Henderson, Nevada as the offensive coordinator of the school&#x27;s varsity and junior varsity football team. His son, Randall Cunningham II, was a freshman quarterback for the Skyhawks.

On June 29, 2010, one of Cunningham&#x27;s children, two-year-old son Christian, drowned in a hot tub while unattended at the family home in Las Vegas.

In August 2011, following a rumored spat with Silverado&#x27;s head coach, Cunningham resigned his coaching position at SHS. His son, Randall Jr, withdrew from SHS and registered the same day at Bishop Gorman High School, a private Roman Catholic school in Las Vegas.

In July 2012, Cunningham was named the 23rd greatest quarterback of the NFL&#x27;s post-merger era, according to Football Nation.

In March 2013, Cunningham authored &quot;Lay It Down: How Letting Go Brings Out Your Best&quot; (Worthy Publishing, ). The book shows readers how to work out the “lay it down” principle in all phases of life.

In December 2014, Cunningham was named head coach at Silverado High School. In his rookie season as head coach, he and his staff turned the football program around from a previous record of 3–7 to a 2015 record of 7–4. The team recorded its first playoff victory since the year 2007. He helped coach two National All-Americans who were chosen to participate in the Blue-Grey All-American Bowl games. Cunningham was not retained as coach at Silverado High School after two seasons in April 2017.

Cunningham&#x27;s #12 Eagles jersey is part of the costume for the Always Teste character of YouTube comedian Ed Bassmaster.

His daughter, Vashti Cunningham, is a track and field athlete who competed in the high jump at the 2020 Summer Olympics, placing sixth overall.

<doc id="741358" wikidata="Q883491" url="?curid=741358" title="Shelby M. Cullom">
<text>Shelby Moore Cullom (November 22, 1829 – January 28, 1914) was a U.S. political figure, serving in various offices, including the United States House of Representatives, the United States Senate and the 17th Governor of Illinois. He was Illinois&#x27;s longest serving senator.

==Life and career==
Cullom was born in 1829 in Monticello, Kentucky, a son of Richard Northcraft Cullom and Elizabeth G. &quot;Betsey&quot; (Coffey) Cullom. He moved with his family a year later to Tazewell County, Illinois. During his youth, Cullom assisted his father with farm labor. Cullom attended the Mount Morris Seminary for two years and became a teacher. Cullom&#x27;s father served as a Whig member of the state legislature, so Cullom became interested in politics. He moved to Springfield, Illinois in 1853, where he studied law with Stuart &amp; Edwards and was admitted to the bar in 1855. He practiced law in Springfield with Charles S. Zane, and was elected city attorney in 1855.

Cullom was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives as a Whig in 1856, serving one term. With the disintegration of the Whig party, Cullom identified with both the Republican and the American parties. He was a candidate for elector on the American party ticket during the 1856 election. In 1860, he was re-elected to the Illinois House as a Republican, and served as Speaker.
In 1855, he married Hannah Fisher. She died in 1861, and in 1863 he married her sister Julia. They were married until her death in 1909. With first wife, Cullom was the father of an infant who died at birth in 1861 and was not named, as well as daughters Ella Cullom Ridgely (1856–1902) and Catherine Cullom Hardie (1859–1894).

He was elected in 1864 to the Thirty-ninth, and reelected to the Fortieth and Forty-first Congresses (March 4, 1865 – March 3, 1871). In 1870, he lost renomination, falling one vote short at a party convention that lasted 186 ballots over five days. Cullom returned to the Illinois House from 1873 to 1874, serving again as Speaker. In 1876, he was elected Governor of Illinois, defeating Lewis Steward by 6,834 votes. He was re-elected in 1880, becoming the first Illinois governor to be re-elected after a four-year term. Under Cullom&#x27;s governorship, the Southern Illinois Penitentiary was commissioned, the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 was quelled, the Illinois Appellate Court was founded, and the Illinois State Board of Health was established. He resigned in 1883 to take office as a US senator; Lieutenant Governor John Marshall Hamilton assumed the governorship in his place. Cullom was elected to the United States Senate in 1882, and reelected in 1888, 1894, 1900 and 1906, serving from March 4, 1883, to March 3, 1913. As a Senator, Cullom oversaw the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887. He believed that only the federal government had the power to force railroads to provide fair treatment to all of its customers, large and small. This was because corporations, such as Standard Oil, had corrupted many of the railroads&#x27; officials into providing them with rebates, and as a whole, the companies in question were more powerful than any state government.

Cullom had an interest in the territories of the United States of the time. Together with Congressman Isaac S. Struble, Cullom pushed the &quot;Cullom-Struble Bill&quot;, whose sanctions against polygamy included exclusion of the Utah Territory from statehood. The bill was on the verge of passing Congress in 1890, but the legislation was preempted when the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) formally disavowed polygamous marriages with the 1890 Manifesto. Cullom was appointed by President William McKinley in July 1898 to the commission created by the Newlands Resolution to establish government in the Territory of Hawaii.

He died in 1914 in Washington, D.C., and is buried in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield. Cullom was a close personal friend and associate of Jacob Bunn and John Whitfield Bunn, the Illinois industrialist brothers who contributed to the building of hundreds of millions of dollars of business enterprises by 1900. The village of Cullom, Illinois, is named in his honor.

<text>Hugh Franklin Culverhouse Sr. (February 20, 1919 – August 25, 1994) was an American businessman, attorney, and sports franchise owner. Culverhouse is best known for having been the longtime owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). He was a successful tax lawyer, and his real estate investments made him wealthy. His work brought him into contact with National Football League team owners, and his failed purchase of the Los Angeles Rams placed him in line to become the owner of the fledgling Buccaneer franchise. He owned the team from its inception until his death.

Culverhouse became one of the most influential team owners in the NFL. Although his teams were rarely competitive on the field, he was credited with modernizing the league. He oversaw the league&#x27;s course of direction through two player strikes, and the modern league&#x27;s financial stability is in great part due to his leadership. He held influence for over a decade, before stepping back due to criticism of what other owners saw as his overly-secretive ways.

Culverhouse was initially lauded for bringing professional football to the Tampa Bay area, but eventually came to be blamed for the team&#x27;s struggles. His refusal to pay Doug Williams at a salary level comparable to that of the league&#x27;s top quarterbacks stirred resentment among fans, and marked the beginning of the team&#x27;s decline during the 1980s. It further led to the belief that Culverhouse was more concerned with fielding a profitable team than a winning one. The Buccaneers&#x27; NFL-record streak of 14 consecutive losing seasons contributed to this perception, although Culverhouse did make several notable attempts to improve the team.

Culverhouse was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1992, and died in 1994. His apparent attempt to exclude his wife from his inheritance led to posthumous revelations of extramarital affairs. Ensuing lawsuits caused an ownership crisis that almost required the team to relocate to another city, before the Glazer family stepped forward with a purchase offer.

==Early life==
A native of Birmingham, Alabama, Culverhouse attended the University of Alabama, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Psi chapter). On the University of Alabama boxing team, he competed together with future governor George Wallace, an experience to which he attributed his confidence in later life. He graduated in 1941. After serving in the Army Air Corps in World War II, he earned a law degree from his alma mater in 1947. He immediately took a job as an assistant state attorney general, serving there for two years. After serving in the Korean War, he became legal counsel for the Internal Revenue Service, where he prosecuted many of the cases resulting from the organized crime investigations of Senator Estes Kefauver. He resigned from the IRS in 1962 after a decade of service, and moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where he entered private practice, specializing in tax law. Although he was considered to be one of the nation&#x27;s top tax lawyers, one whose cases were sometimes cited by the Supreme Court of the United States, his fortune was built on real estate investments. Listed by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine as one of the 250 wealthiest people in the United States, he eventually had investments in 37 companies and was worth over $380 million at his death. He served as a personal representative of President Gerald Ford, bearing the title of U.S. Ambassador, at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria. The University of Alabama&#x27;s Culverhouse College of Commerce and Business Administration is named for him.

Culverhouse&#x27;s investments included several banks, Provincetown-Boston Airlines, the Palmer Ranch real estate development near Sarasota, Florida, and movie productions including &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; and &quot;The Emerald Forest&quot;. He was criticized over a planned extension of Interstate 75 into South Florida, as its route went directly past land owned by numerous powerful investors, including Culverhouse, Governor Bob Graham, State Attorney General Jim Smith, and the Arvida Corporation.

==Ownership of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers==
In 1972, Culverhouse had a handshake deal to buy the Los Angeles Rams from owner Dan Reeves for $17 million ($127 million in 2024, only to learn that Reeves later sold the team to Robert Irsay for $19 million ($142 million in 2024). When Irsay then traded teams with Baltimore Colts owner Carroll Rosenbloom, Culverhouse sued, claiming that the others had conspired to prevent his purchase of the team. An out-of-court settlement guaranteed Rosenbloom&#x27;s aid in getting an expansion franchise for Culverhouse. The opportunity came two years later, when the league expanded to Seattle and Tampa. Culverhouse was offered the Seattle expansion franchise, but declined it due to his residence in Jacksonville. Philadelphia construction company owner Thomas McCloskey was originally awarded the Tampa franchise, but soon found the business arrangement to be different than what he had expected, and backed out of the deal. Culverhouse was then awarded the franchise by the Art Rooney-chaired NFL Expansion Committee, ahead of Fort Lauderdale furniture chain (and future Boston Celtics) owner Harry T. Mangurian, Jr. The name &quot;Tampa Bay Buccaneers&quot; was chosen as a nod to the team representing not only the city of Tampa, but the entire Florida Suncoast area; and to the pirates who once inhabited the area.

Culverhouse quickly became one of the most influential NFL owners; he served as a member of the Player Club Relations Committee that handled player grievances, and of the NFL Congressional Committee. He was a member of the executive committee that handled negotiations during the 1982 NFL strike, an experience that earned him great praise from NFL negotiator Jack Donlan. Donlan praised Culverhouse&#x27;s logic, analytical, and problem-solving skills, and his effectiveness &quot;at getting his way&quot;. Culverhouse was credited with having a big hand in the owners&#x27; course of direction during the strike, and was responsible for recruiting Donlan as negotiator. He repeated the role during the 1987 players&#x27; strike, after which NFLPA President Gene Upshaw described him as &quot;formidable&quot;, and said that &quot;at times, the whole league seemed to flow from this one guy&quot;. He was chairman of the NFL Finance Committee and the Management Council Executive Committee. His efforts were instrumental in bringing Super Bowl XVIII to Tampa, despite a lack of adequate hotel space in the city. Culverhouse was also a pioneer in using computers to handle team finances and scouting reports. He was a member of the four-man committee that stripped ownership of the New England Patriots from the Sullivan family when their debt became too great. Patriots founder Billy Sullivan later accused Culverhouse of blocking his effort to propose a stock sale that would have eased the debt. Culverhouse distanced himself from the NFL power core in later years, stung by other owners&#x27; criticisms of the Management Council. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue credited Culverhouse for building much of the strength and unity of the modern NFL.

===General criticism===
Culverhouse was criticized by other team owners as the team prepared for its debut season, who said that his involvement in day-to-day team operations was reminiscent of the owners of the expansion Falcons and Saints, teams which had yet to qualify for the playoffs after a decade of play. Buccaneer employees were described as living in an &quot;atmosphere of fear&quot;, especially after the firings during the 1977 offseason of executives who had been involved with unpopular decisions that Culverhouse had supported at the time. In one case, marketing director Bill Marcum was fired due to public backlash over the team&#x27;s $12 ticket prices (about $62 in 2024) for an exhibition in Jacksonville, even though Culverhouse had set the ticket prices, and Marcum had opposed them.

===Conflict of interest accusations===
Culverhouse was named one of the executors of Los Angeles Rams owner Carroll Rosenbloom&#x27;s estate, and after Rosenbloom&#x27;s death, Culverhouse continued a business relationship with his widow, Georgia. Georgia&#x27;s marriage to composer Dominic Frontiere took place at Culverhouse&#x27;s home, with Culverhouse himself, a notary public, performing the ceremony. The relationship, in which Culverhouse served as an advisor to the Rams while maintaining ownership of the Buccaneers, was criticized as a conflict of interest. The Los Angeles Coliseum Council accused the Rams of seeking Culverhouse&#x27;s counsel when several players held out during the 1980 preseason; the Buccaneers won a 10–9 victory over that same unprepared Rams team early that season. Culverhouse also oversaw a reorganization of the Rams&#x27; front office; the relationship earned him the nickname of &quot;Godfather&quot; of the Rams. Culverhouse and Frontiere were two of the owners named in a lawsuit brought by Al Davis, who alleged that their campaign contributions to Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia were an attempt to buy his support in helping to prevent Davis&#x27; planned move of the Oakland Raiders to Los Angeles.

Culverhouse&#x27;s relationships with other NFL owners were occasionally, as in his relationship with the Rams, alleged to constitute conflicts of interest. His $3 million loan to help Philadelphia Eagles owner Leonard Tose with his gambling debts was one example, as it violated the NFL constitution and bylaws. On other occasions, he was criticized for his overly-secretive ways as NFL Finance Committee Chairman, as other league owners found it difficult to obtain information on how league finances were being spent. In particular, owners were upset about not being informed about money given to NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle in a 5-year extension of his contract. The extension was awarded to him by the Finance Committee as a reward for negotiation of the league television contract in 1982, even though Rozelle had five years remaining on his current contract.

===Loss of popular support===
Culverhouse was described as late as 1982 as a rare owner who was popular with players, coaches, and fans. He was commended for allowing his staff to handle football operations without interference, and for having the patience to allow John McKay to follow through with his building plan despite the franchise&#x27;s 0–26 start. This changed after events surrounding the 1982 players&#x27; strike. A report issued by the National Football League Players Association prior to the start of negotiations revealed that the Buccaneers had the fifth-highest gross income of all NFL teams, while their average salary was only the 21st-highest. This directly contradicted statements made by Culverhouse in 1980, in which he told players that they were on one of the three highest-paid teams. The NFLPA figures showed that the Buccaneers were actually the third &quot;lowest&quot;-paying team, based on total salaries as a percentage of gross income. Culverhouse was then accused of trying to divide the players during the strike, when some of the team&#x27;s assistant coaches contacted players to ask whether they would be willing to return to the team.

Culverhouse was considered to have drawn a closer friendship than an owner should to his coach, having guaranteed John McKay employment for life. When the team began to lose, area fans blamed McKay, and felt that there was no hope for any change. He was, however, credited with recognizing the need for a change in leadership, as he went outside of the organization in seeking a replacement when McKay retired. He then upset fans by broadcasting advertisements thanking fans for their support, while simultaneously raising ticket prices.

However, while Culverhouse&#x27;s relationship with Tampa had been problematic for years, the Bo Jackson 1986 draft debacle permanently ruined the owner&#x27;s reputation in his home city. Jackson, the Heisman Trophy-winning running back from Auburn, was the consensus #1 player headed into the draft. Jackson had never forgiven Culverhouse or the Bucs when they flew him to Tampa for a physical and a visit at the team&#x27;s expense during his senior year, leading him to believe that the NCAA and Southeastern Conference had approved the trip. In truth, they had not done so. Since the Bucs paid for the trip, it violated an SEC rule that barred athletes from being professional in one sport and amateur in another. As a result, the trip cost Jackson his eligibility during his senior baseball season. Jackson believed the Bucs had deliberately tried to sabotage his baseball career, and told Culverhouse that &quot;you&#x27;re going to be wasting a draft pick&quot; if they selected him. Jackson announced he would play major league baseball instead, signing a contract with the Kansas City Royals and leaving the Bucs as the NFL&#x27;s laughingstock.

===Doug Williams===
Even before the Jackson incident, Culverhouse&#x27;s reputation in Tampa had taken a hit due to his treatment of quarterback Doug Williams. Williams led the Buccaneers to the playoffs in three of his five years with the team, and was considered to be their single most important player. However, he was only paid $120,000 a year, which ranked 42nd among NFL quarterbacks, was less than what some teams&#x27; third-string quarterbacks made, and was lower than the salary of Terdell Middleton, a running back who had two total carries in his two years in Tampa Bay. After the 1982 season, Williams asked for a $600,000 contract that would pay him among the league&#x27;s top quarterbacks. Culverhouse refused to budge from his initial offer of $400,000, which he said would make Williams one of the five highest-paid quarterbacks in the league. Williams&#x27; agent disputed this, saying that Culverhouse&#x27;s offer was substantially less than what several other quarterbacks made. With negotiations at a standstill, the Buccaneers traded the following season&#x27;s first-round draft pick to the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for Jack Thompson, a backup quarterback who had been unable to unseat Ken Anderson, as an insurance policy should Williams prove impossible to sign, or have trouble recovering from offseason knee surgery. Williams interpreted this as a sign that the team did not want him, and sat out the 1983 season before signing a contract with the Oklahoma Outlaws of the springtime United States Football League. Adding injury to that insult, Williams later made an NFL comeback and signed with the Washington Redskins in 1986, and led the Redskins to a Super Bowl win in 1987, winning Super Bowl XXII and winning the Super Bowl MVP award.

Culverhouse&#x27;s hard line with Williams created the perception that he was more concerned with profits than with putting a winning team on the field. It aroused suspicions that Culverhouse&#x27;s main concern was the Buccaneers&#x27; salary structure, and that this was related to the frequency with which the team traded away its first-round draft choices. Williams&#x27; comments that he would have been treated differently had he been white resonated with the Bay Area African American community, who saw the Buccaneers&#x27; ensuing on-field woes as retribution, boycotted Buccaneer games by the thousands, and commented that Culverhouse threw parties that cost more than what Williams was asking for. The Buccaneers missed Williams&#x27; confidence and ability to make big plays at key times, and lost their first nine games in 1983, when they had been expected to contend for the playoffs. They finished 2–14, the first of what would be 14 consecutive losing seasons—the longest since the merger between the NFL and the All-America Football Conference in 1950—and would not have another winning season in Culverhouse&#x27;s lifetime. They would lose 10 or more games in 13 of those years, including 12 in a row from 1983 to 1994—an NFL record. The timing of the situation coincided with the ascendance of the Tampa Bay Bandits, who led the USFL in attendance with a wide-open, crowd-pleasing offense led by local hero Steve Spurrier, while the Buccaneers were losing games with a conservative offense that fans found boring. Attendance having dropped sharply, Culverhouse then further alienated fans by berating them, accusing them of apathy.

===Attendance and television availability===
The long losing streak further penalized fans, as the NFL blackout policy usually prevented poorly attended Buccaneer home games from being shown on local television. No Buccaneer home games were televised on local stations for several years following November 29, 1982 (a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game vs. the Dolphins), including a game on January 2, 1983, that sold out, but not in time to lift the blackout. In total, the Buccaneers had a streak of 32 consecutive blackouts before a November 9, 1986 game against the then-reigning Super Bowl champion Chicago Bears sold out in time to allow for local television. At one point, the CBS television network, which had the rights to NFC television broadcasts at the time, correctly anticipated poor seasons from all of the Southern (Buccaneers, Falcons, and Saints) teams, and reorganized their viewing markets in such a way that Buccaneers games were not broadcast anywhere in the state of Florida. Culverhouse went so far as to dictate that Miami Dolphins games also be blacked out, sometimes even when Buccaneer games were sellouts. He further inflamed fans in 1989 by proposing to move some of the team&#x27;s games to Orlando, due to poor attendance. Several local radio stations responded with billboards saying &quot;Hugh gotta go!&quot;, and with a picture of a screw next to Culverhouse&#x27;s name. The Tampa Chamber of Commerce countered with a billboard thanking Culverhouse for bringing Super Bowl XXV to Tampa.

===Profitability===
Although enjoyment factored into Culverhouse&#x27;s purchase of the Buccaneers, it was first and foremost a business decision which he expected to be profitable. He admitted to being known for his frugality, due to moves such as wearing outdated clothing, and having the One Buc Place walls painted white to avoid having to spend money on projection screens. This was not initially a problem for the franchise, even though the budget airplane that Culverhouse chartered for the team almost crashed after their very first game; original coach John McKay reported in 1978 that Culverhouse had never blocked any deals, even those involving a great amount of money. Later, however, the team let go or traded away many of its players who were highly paid and/or demanded more money, including Dave Pear, Doug Williams, Ricky Reynolds, Reggie Cobb, Mark Carrier, and Jeris White. First-round draft choices were frequently traded for players who were not considered to be of equal value, as when the team traded for often-injured defensive end Wally Chambers without requiring that he first pass a physical examination. Frustration over being beaten by players he had pleaded with Culverhouse to sign contributed to the resignation of McKay. He also fired well-regarded personnel director Ken Herock, when Herock demanded to be paid in line with his value around the league.

Despite the losing and the poor attendance, the Buccaneers were one of the NFL&#x27;s most profitable teams for most of Culverhouse&#x27;s ownership. In 1989, only the Chicago Bears had higher profits than the 5–11 Buccaneers, who profited $6.3 million with the league&#x27;s second-lowest payroll, while the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers lost $16.2 million. The team attributed their low salaries to the players&#x27; youth, stating that it was the coaches who had made the decision to use younger players, who drew lower salaries than veterans. This contributed to the perception that Culverhouse was not committed to fielding a quality team, although the rookie contracts he gave to Vinny Testaverde and Paul Gruber were so high as to upset other team owners, while he made Ray Perkins one of the five highest-paid NFL head coaches. He also offered Bill Parcells $6.5 million to coach the team, offered draft pick Bo Jackson a five-year, $7 million contract that was at the time the highest in NFL history for a rookie, paid Keith McCants an NFL-record $2.5 million signing bonus, and paid Steve Young $6 million in salary, plus another $1 million for the buyout of his USFL contract.

==Death and aftermath==
Culverhouse was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1992. After a successful operation to remove a tumor and part of his lung, he began chemotherapy a few months later, when a routine exam revealed a recurrence of the cancer. Despite his health problems, he even went hunting in Tanzania only four days after having part of his lung removed. An experimental procedure failed to stop the cancer, and he died on August 25, 1994, at the Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans. He was survived by wife Joy, daughter Gay, and son Hugh, Jr.

===Sale of the Buccaneers===
Several investors stepped forward with offers to buy the Buccaneers after Culverhouse&#x27;s death, including Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, New York Yankees owner (and Tampa resident) George Steinbrenner, and Massachusetts developer Socrates Babacas. In response to the ensuing publicity, the trust administering Culverhouse&#x27;s estate then issued a statement that the team was not for sale. They reversed their position two months later, as a poor early-season record led to declining fan support and revenues. The decision to sell the franchise came on the same day that Joy filed a $25 million claim against Hugh&#x27;s estate. Hugh had paid $16 million for the franchise, which was now valued at $142 million. With Barnett Bank filing claims for $20.8 million against the Culverhouse estate, the trustees came very close to accepting Angelos&#x27; $200 million offer, which would have involved relocating the team to Baltimore, Maryland. Fearful of losing the team, civic leaders presented a proposal guaranteeing ticket sales of at least 55,000 for all home games for the next two years. The team was eventually sold to Palm Beach, Florida businessman Malcolm Glazer for $192 million, at that moment the largest price ever paid for a professional sports franchise.

===Lawsuits over the Culverhouse estate===
Before Culverhouse&#x27;s death, his wife, Joy, had signed a post-nuptial agreement to surrender her half of the estate. This was done on the advice of lawyer Fred F. Cone, Jr., who would later become one of the three trustees handling the Culverhouse estate. Joy charged that the trustees were mishandling the estate, and not paying her share. She filed a malpractice suit against Cone for advising her to give up her marital rights, and a second suit asking for accounting of the estate and removal of the trustees. She said that Hugh and Cone advised her to sign the agreement for tax reasons, and falsely claimed that Culverhouse was on the brink of bankruptcy. She charged that the three trustees, Cone, Jack Donlan, and Stephen F. Story, paid themselves $4.35 million in bonuses for arranging the Buccaneers&#x27; sale, sums far in excess of what Culverhouse himself had specified, and that they paid Story a sum that was comparable to the salary of a Fortune 500 executive for managing the estate and included a 10-year golden parachute clause. She also alleged that the value of Culverhouse&#x27;s estate had been misrepresented to her at the time that she signed the agreement. The lawsuits made the details of the Culverhouse estate public. When it was discovered that the trust had paid hush money to a mistress of Hugh&#x27;s, Joy&#x27;s lawyer alleged that Hugh had planned to divorce Joy, and that the trust was created to deprive her of her rightful assets. Court depositions revealed three extramarital affairs, including Susan Brinkley, wife of broadcaster David Brinkley. The suits were eventually settled, with each of the three trustees being paid $3 million to remove themselves from the handling of his estate, and Joy being allowed to appoint her own trustees. Joy then said of Hugh, &quot;I&#x27;d like to pull him out of the grave and shoot him with every bullet I could get&quot;.

==Philanthropy==
In contrast with his frugal ways in business, Culverhouse frequently contributed to the community. Some of his notable donations include:

* A $4.6 million gift to the University of South Florida, which established the Culverhouse Chair in Education at the University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee and was the largest donation in school history;
* $600,000 to the University of Florida, for the establishment of the Hugh F. Culverhouse Eminent Scholars Chair in Federal Taxation;
* $500,000 to the Stetson University College of Law, for a visiting-professor chair;
* $10 million to the University of Alabama, the 3rd largest gift in school history;
* of vacant Tarpon Springs, Florida land to Habitat for Humanity; and
* The first $1 million pledged for the construction of the Straz Center for the Performing Arts.

Culverhouse was also a member of the board of trustees who administered the annual Florida Prize award for outstanding work in the visual or performing arts.

==Awards==
* 1975 Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement
*1993 Florida Sports Hall of Fame

==Family==
Culverhouse had at least one son, who maintains his tradition of philanthropy and is a former assistant U.S. attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice. The name of Hugh Jr&#x27;s wife is Eliza. Together they support the University of Alabama, the University of Miami, the Episcopalian Church of the Redeemer in Sarasota, Florida.

<text>Guðrún Katrín Þorbergsdóttir (; 14 August 1934 – 12 October 1998) was the First Lady of Iceland from 1996 to 1998. She was the first wife of Icelandic president Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson.

Guðrún Katrín studied archaeology and sociology. She was the General Manager of the Postal Workers Union for nearly 20 years, and managed a clothing store in downtown Reykjavík. She was also active in politics and held a city council post in the town of Seltjarnarnes for 16 years. She married Ólafur in 1974 and the following year gave birth to twin daughters, Guðrún Tinna and Svanhildur Dalla.

Guðrún Katrín was very popular in Iceland, and her charm and charisma are considered by many as one of the main reasons her husband was elected president of Iceland in June 1996. Guðrún Katrín was diagnosed with leukemia in September 1997. She spent the last few months of her life under the care of specialists in Seattle, Washington, with her family by her side, until her death in October 1998. Her death after a long and difficult struggle, at the age of 64, was a shock to her family and the Icelandic nation.

<text>Marquette University () is a private Jesuit research university in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States. It was established as Marquette College on August 28, 1881, by John Henni, the first Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee. Initially an all-male institution, Marquette became the first coeducational Catholic university in the world in 1909.

Marquette is part of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities. The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and had an enrollment of about 11,000 students in 2023. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. Marquette is one of the largest Jesuit universities in the United States and the largest private university in Wisconsin.

Marquette is organized into 11 schools and colleges at its main Milwaukee campus, offering programs in the liberal arts, business, communication, education, engineering, law, and health sciences disciplines. The university also administers classes in suburbs around the Milwaukee area and in Washington, D.C. While most students are pursuing undergraduate degrees, the university has over 68 doctoral and master&#x27;s degree programs, a law school, a dental school (the only such school in the state of Wisconsin), and 22 graduate certificate programs.

The university&#x27;s varsity athletic teams, known as the Golden Eagles, are members of the Big East Conference and compete in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I in all sports. Among its current and past faculty and alumni are 43 Fulbright Scholars, 6 Truman Scholars, 6 state governors, and 3 U.S. Senators.

==History==
===Marquette College===
Marquette University was founded on August 28, 1881, as Marquette College by John Martin Henni, the first Catholic bishop of the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, with the assistance of funding from Belgian businessman Guillaume Joseph DeBuey. The university was named after 17th-century missionary and explorer Father Jacques Marquette. The highest priority of the newly established college was to provide an affordable Catholic education to the area&#x27;s emerging German immigrant population. The first five graduates of Marquette College received their Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1887. Between 1891 and 1906, the college employed one full-time lay professor, with many classes being taught by master&#x27;s students. By 1906, Marquette had awarded 186 students the Bachelor of Arts, 38 the Master of Arts, and one student Bachelor of Science.

===Marquette University===
Marquette College officially became a university in 1907, after it became affiliated with a local medical school and moved to its present location. Johnston Hall, which now houses the university&#x27;s College of Communication, was the first building erected on the new campus grounds. Marquette University High School, formerly the preparatory department of the university, became a separate institution the same year. In 1908, Marquette opened an engineering college and purchased two law schools, which would ultimately become the foundation of its current law program. Initially an all-male institution, Marquette University became the first coed Catholic university in the world, when it admitted its first female students in 1909. By 1916 its female students had increased to 375; many other Catholic institutions began adopting similar approaches in their enrollments during the 1910s and 1920s.

Marquette acquired the Wisconsin College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1913, leading to the formation of the Marquette University School of Medicine. During the 1920s and again during the post-World War II years, Marquette rapidly expanded, opening a new library, athletics facilities, classroom buildings, and residence halls. The student population increased markedly as well, met by the construction of buildings for the schools of law, business, dentistry, and the liberal arts. Marquette is credited with offering the first degree program specializing in hospital administration in the United States, and graduated the first two students in 1927. Despite the promising growth of the university, financial constraints led to the School of Medicine separating from Marquette in 1967 to become the Medical College of Wisconsin. Marquette&#x27;s Golden Avalanche football team was disbanded in December 1960, and basketball became the leading spectator sport at the university.

In the 1960s an early fifteenth century French chapel, St. Martin de Seysseul, which was reputedly connected to St. Joan of Arc and which had been transported to the US in the 1920s, was transferred to the campus. It is, unsurprisingly, the oldest building in Wisconsin.

===1970s–present===

Graduate programs in the liberal arts and sciences, for which planning had begun in the preceding decade, were officially opened in the 1970s. In 1977, the university celebrated the victory of their men&#x27;s basketball team over the University of North Carolina to win the NCAA Championship title.

In 1994, then-president Albert J. DiUlio made a controversial decision to discontinue the use of the &quot;Warriors&quot; nickname for the university&#x27;s sports teams, citing growing pressure on schools to end the use of Native American mascots. Backlash from alumni, donors, and students ensued, though the administration and Marquette community eventually settled on the nickname &quot;Golden Eagles&quot;. The mascot controversy again boiled over in 2005 when the university&#x27;s leadership briefly changed the nickname to &quot;the Gold&quot;, only to return to the &quot;Golden Eagles&quot; a week later.

During the 1990s, the university invested heavily in the neighborhood surrounding Marquette with its $50 million Campus Circle Project. It also opened a Washington, D.C.–based study center called the Les Aspin Center for Government, named after the former Secretary of Defense. MBA programs and the College of Professional Studies, with programs aimed at adult education, were also founded during the mid-1990s. In 1996, Robert A. Wild was installed as the university&#x27;s 22nd president and shortly thereafter began a fundraising campaign that culminated in a major campus beautification effort and the construction of several major buildings, including a new space for the School of Dentistry. The university&#x27;s growth was also marked by increases in overall enrollment and the highest test scores for incoming freshmen to date.

In the early 2000s, Marquette continued to grow, with new residence halls, a library, a School of Dentistry building, and athletics facilities. In 2003 the men&#x27;s basketball team reached the Final Four, boosting the university&#x27;s exposure on a national level. Fundraising efforts in the subsequent years helped the university complete its largest-ever capital campaign, the Magis Campaign, which raised over $357 million by 2006.

The two largest donations to Marquette University came within the same academic year. The second-largest gift was given by an anonymous couple who have, over time, donated over $50 million to the university. On December 18, 2006, President Wild announced that the couple donated $25 million to the College of Engineering. Less than five months later, on May 4, 2007, Marquette announced a $51 million gift from Raymond and Kathryn Eckstein that would directly benefit the Marquette University School of Law. The gift was the largest amount ever given to a Wisconsin university.

During the Fall 2013 semester, former Marquette president Robert A. Wild returned to Marquette University as interim president following the resignation of his successor and 22nd president of Marquette, Scott Pilarz. Michael Lovell, the former chancellor of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, took over as president on July 1, 2014, following Wild&#x27;s interim term. Lovell was the first layperson to serve as Marquette&#x27;s president, as all previous presidents of the university were Catholic clergymen.

On February 28, 2022, the Marquette board of trustees approved an updated university seal and motto. The change was aimed to &quot;reflect Marquette&#x27;s history, tradition, and catholic, Jesuit mission, and more accurately depict the role of the Indigenous nations that guided Father Marquette on his journey&quot;. The updated seal removes an image depicting Fr. Marquette in a canoe pointing the way forward for a Native American guide and replaces it with an image of a river splitting into three, representing the Milwaukee, the Menomonee, and the Kinnickinnic rivers, and three stalks of wild rice in the foreground, to represent the Potawatomi, Menominee, and Ho-Chunk nations, who remain in the Milwaukee area today. With the seal change also came a change to the university&#x27;s motto. The motto changed from &quot;Numen Flumenque&quot;, meaning &quot;God and the (Mississippi) River&quot; to the Jesuit motto &quot;Ad majorem Dei gloriam&quot;, meaning &quot;For the greater glory of God&quot;.

On June 9, 2024, Marquette&#x27;s most recent President Michael Lovell died at the age of 57 from sarcoma cancer.

===Controversies===
On May 16, 1968, African-American students withdrew from Marquette University in a protest against what they called its &quot;institutional racism&quot;. The students demanded the immediate hiring of an African-American administrator. A rally at the student union culminated in the arrest of seven people who refused to leave the building after closing. On May 17, Marquette moved toward the hiring of an African-American administrator to end the campus protest.

In April 2010, Marquette University offered a position as dean of the College of Arts and Sciences to Jodi O&#x27;Brien, an openly lesbian professor at another Jesuit university, Seattle University. On May 2, Marquette rescinded the offer over concerns about her scholarly writing as it related to Catholic teaching. O&#x27;Brien had published works on lesbian sex and same-sex marriage. Several faculty members at Marquette said the decision raised concerns about academic freedom. Faculty and students from both universities protested Marquette&#x27;s decision.

On June 21, 2011, a 19-year-old Marquette student reported being raped by an athlete. No report was taken by university officers and the city police were not notified. Marquette University acknowledged that failing to notify police was a violation of state law and that the university had ignored its reporting obligations for 10 years. In at least two cases, the lapse played a role in prosecutors declining to press charges. Marquette had held an administrative hearing on another sexual assault allegation in January 2011. However, by the time the report was filed with police, too much time had elapsed to conduct a proper investigation. In 2016, independent research from The State of Education deemed Marquette University as the least sexually healthy college in the nation.

In the fall of 2014, an undergraduate student disagreed with how a course instructor dealt with the topic of gay rights. After class, the student recorded a conversation with the course instructor in which the course instructor stated that she would not tolerate homophobic, racist, or sexist comments in class. After taking the issue to the university, the student claimed to be shut out and told his academic professor, John McAdams, who posted about it on his personal blog. McAdams was put on suspension for refusing to apologize for his blog post, earning MU a spot on the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education&#x27;s 2016 &quot;10 Worst Colleges for Free Speech&quot;.

==Campus==

Marquette is located on a campus in the near downtown Milwaukee neighborhood of University Hill, on the former Wisconsin State Fairgrounds. Lake Michigan is roughly one mile east of the edge of campus. The campus stretches 12 blocks east to west and 5 blocks north to south. Wisconsin Avenue, a major thoroughfare in Milwaukee, bisects the campus, placing academic buildings on the south side, and residence halls and other offices and buildings on the north side. Named after the university, the Marquette Interchange, where Interstate Highways 43 and 94 intersect, is also close to campus.

Outside of the main campus, Marquette also operates an athletics facility called Valley Fields, which is home to stadiums for track and field, lacrosse, and soccer teams. Located in the Menomonee Valley, the facility sits along the banks of the Menomonee River, about one mile south of the main Marquette University campus. The university also owns property in Washington, D.C., which houses its Les Aspin Center for Government, a program designed for students interested in careers in public service. The Marquette College of Business Administration hosts off-campus graduate classes in Waukesha and Kohler, Wisconsin, though it does not own these classroom properties.

In 2016, Marquette University&#x27;s College of Nursing opened a satellite campus in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, for the blended Direct Entry MSN program, where students complete coursework online and spend time on campus learning skills and participating in simulation labs.

In January 2017, the university revealed plans for a $600m project to transform the Milwaukee campus including a BioDiscovery District, Innovation Alley, a recreational and wellness facility, residence hall, and sports research facility.

==Academics==
The university includes 11 schools and colleges: the Helen Way Klingler College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business Administration, the J. William and Mary Diederich College of Communication, the College of Education, the College of Engineering, the College of Health Sciences, the College of Nursing, the College of Professional Studies, the Graduate School, the Marquette University School of Dentistry, and the Marquette University Law School. Marquette&#x27;s largest college by enrollment is the Helen Way Klingler College of Arts and Sciences.

==Student life==

===Demographics===
Marquette&#x27;s 11,749 students come from all 50 states, various U.S. territories, and represent more than 65 countries. Of these, 8,293 are undergraduates and 3,456 are graduate and professional students. Twenty-nine percent of undergraduate students are from Wisconsin and thirty-seven percent come from Illinois. Marquette University also has a moderate number of law students and dental students.

The student body is fifty-three percent female and sixty-eight percent identify themselves as Catholic. The retention rate for Marquette is high, with about ninety percent of students returning for their year.

Marquette administers an Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) – a federally funded TRIO program that is intended to motivate and enable low-income and first-generation students whose parents do not have baccalaureate degrees, to enter and succeed in higher education. Eligible students, who have potential for success and enrolling at Marquette, are provided with a pre-enrollment summer program, a network of supportive services, financial aid assistance, academic counseling, specialized courses, seminars, tutoring, and educational and career counseling.

===Residence halls===

Marquette has absorbed many existing buildings in the area, especially for use as residence halls. Some examples of absorbed buildings include Charles Cobeen Hall, a former hotel, and M. Carpenter Tower, an Art Deco building, both constructed in the 1920s on 11th Street that have been converted into undergraduate residence halls. Glenn Humphrey Hall, a student residence hall that prior to the 2015–16 school year served as a university apartment building, was once the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Wisconsin. David Straz Tower, formerly the Downtown Milwaukee YMCA, is now a residence hall, recreation center, and administrative office building. Mashuda Hall, a sophomore dorm, was once the Coach House Motor Inn, where The Beatles stayed during their tour in 1964. Abbottsford Hall served as The Abbottsford Hotel until the university purchased it for use as graduate apartments. It was converted into a freshman residence hall prior to the 2005–2006 academic year. The university also purchased the Marquette Apartments complex in 2008, which was remodeled as a sophomore residence hall prior to the 2009–2010 academic year and renamed McCabe Hall. As of the 2015–16 academic year, McCabe Hall is now university apartments. Additionally, the university purchased The Marq, an apartment complex on the west side of campus, in 2017.

Of the nine current student residence halls, only three (O&#x27;Donnell Hall, Schroeder Hall, and McCormick Hall) were built by the university. McCormick Hall was razed following the 2018–19 academic year and replaced by Wild Commons, a residence hall for freshman and sophomore students named after former university president Robert Wild. A few weeks after opening for the 2018–19 academic year, Wild requested his name be removed from the building due to his mishandling of accusations of sexual abuse of minors against three Jesuits under his jurisdiction during his time as Provincial Superior of the Chicago Province of the Society of Jesus from 1985 to 1991. It has since been renamed The Commons. Dr. E. J. And Margaret O&#x27;Brien Hall has since been erected at the previous site of the McCormick Hall.

===Clubs and organizations===
The university has more than 230 student organizations.

===Greek life===

Marquette University is host to 23 Greek organizations and, as of 2009, 10% of the total undergraduate student body is active in Greek life. Sororities are slightly more popular than fraternities, with 11.7% of the female student population involved in Greek life, compared to 7.45% of men. The international engineering sorority Alpha Omega Epsilon was founded at Marquette on November 13, 1983.

===Performing arts===
Among the various stage performance groups at Marquette are the Studio 013 Refugees, a student improv comedy group. The Refugees perform free shows throughout the year, including a 12-hour outdoor show on campus, and they provide workshops on improv comedy. The Marquette University Players Society (MUPS) performs in a traditional theater setting.

The Marquette University Chorus, the longest standing choral organization on campus, is a mixed choir of fifty to sixty men and women. There are Men&#x27;s Choir, Women&#x27;s Choir, and Chamber Choir. Marquette also has a Gospel Choir and a Liturgical Choir which sings weekly at Mass at Gesu. There are three selective a cappella groups that interested students may try out for: the coed Gold &#x27;n Blues, the all-male Naturals, and the all-female Meladies.

Pure Dance is a lyrical and jazz performance group that helps members pursue their interests in dance and choreography in a collegial setting. Dance, Inc. is a group that allows its members to perform in semester showcases, and styles of dance vary. Hype Dance company is primarily a hip-hop organization that helps to cultivate an interest in hip-hop, contemporary, and jazz style dance.

The Marquette University Symphony Orchestra provides members with an opportunity to develop and share musical talents through participation in a large-group setting. There are several band ensembles that students may join. The Symphonic Band is a group designed for students who wish to continue to make music at the collegiate level, but in a relaxed setting. The newly established Wind Ensemble performs high-level wind band repertoire. There are also two jazz bands. Students who are registered and participate actively in the Symphonic Band and Wind Ensemble have the opportunity to participate in the MU Pep Band.

===Student media===

The student newspaper, &quot;The Marquette Tribune,&quot; founded in 1916, is the official campus newspaper. It is published in print on Tuesdays and Thursdays during the school year. The paper has won regional and national awards for excellence from the Society of Professional Journalists. While most of the 40-person staff are journalism majors, students from varying fields of study write for the paper. A quarterly student-produced magazine, the &quot;Marquette Journal&quot;, focuses on student life, though formerly the &quot;Journal&quot; was the school&#x27;s student literary magazine. Like &quot;The Marquette Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Journal&quot; has won awards from the Society of Professional Journalists.

Marquette Radio and MUTV, the student radio and television stations, were launched in the late 1960s to mid-1970s. MUTV airs student-produced programs, including newscasts, sports shows, and entertainment shows. Marquette Radio also airs student-produced shows with focuses on music, sports, news, and talk.

&quot;Hilltop&quot; was Marquette&#x27;s university-wide yearbook from 1915 to 1999. The publication, in its 84 years of existence, totaled over 30,000 pages in 82 volumes. Students&#x27; color-plate sketches were often highly detailed, humorous or dramatic, and were appropriate examples of contemporary artwork. In April 2006, Marquette&#x27;s librarians completed a digitally-archived collection of &quot;Hilltop&quot;.

===School songs===
The school songs, &quot;The Marquette University Anthem&quot; and the &quot;Marquette University Fight Song,&quot; are generally sung by students and alumni during basketball games, accompanied by the pep band. The former is also often played using the carillon bells of the Marquette Hall bell tower. &quot;The Marquette University Anthem,&quot; as it was originally known, is now referred to almost exclusively as &quot;Hail Alma Mater&quot;/ The tune was written by Liborius Semmann, a music teacher from Wisconsin.

==Athletics==
The Golden Eagle is Marquette&#x27;s mascot and the school colors are Marquette blue and Marquette gold, with powder blue incorporated in the 1970s and late 2000s. Marquette is a Division I member of the NCAA and competes in the Big East Conference. The university has 11 varsity teams: basketball, cross-country, men&#x27;s golf, soccer, track &amp; field, tennis, and women&#x27;s volleyball. In 2013, Marquette began competition in varsity men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse as a member of the Big East. Football was discontinued by the university after the 1960 season for financial reasons. Since joining the Big East in 2005, the Golden Eagles have won conference championships in men&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s golf, women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track &amp; field, and men&#x27;s lacrosse. Marquette&#x27;s athletic rivals include Syracuse, Cincinnati, DePaul, Louisville, Notre Dame, and Wisconsin. In 2009, because of Marquette, Milwaukee was named by CNN as one of America&#x27;s great college basketball towns.

===Mascot and nickname===
Marquette&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic teams were the &quot;Warriors&quot; from May 1954 to July 1994, when the nickname was changed to the &quot;Golden Eagles,&quot; on the grounds that previous logos had been disrespectful to Native Americans. The football team was known as &quot;Golden Avalanche&quot; through its final season in 1960, and other teams were known as &quot;Warriors,&quot; &quot;Blue and Gold,&quot; and &quot;Hilltoppers&quot;. The Marquette Warriors (the nickname that preceded Golden Eagles) won the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship in 1977. In 2004, Marquette began to consider changing the name back to Warriors, but instead the Board of Trustees changed the nickname to simply &quot;Gold&quot;. An intensely negative reaction by students, faculty, alumni, and fans led to yet another series of votes, which eventually pitted &quot;Golden Eagles&quot; against &quot;Hilltoppers&quot;. Respondents were told in advance that write-in votes for &quot;Warriors&quot; would not be tabulated, although those results were later released, and &quot;Golden Eagles&quot; was restored in June 2005. In July 2020, Marquette Athletics announced &quot;Iggy&quot; as the name of the Golden Eagle Mascot—named after St. Ignatius of Loyola.

<text>Albert Baird Cummins (February 15, 1850July 30, 1926) was an American lawyer and politician. He was the 18th governor of Iowa, elected to three consecutive terms and U.S. Senator for Iowa, serving for 18 years. Cummins was a leader of the Progressive movement in Washington and Iowa. He fought to break up monopolies. Cummins&#x27; successes included establishing the direct primary to allow voters to select candidates instead of bosses; outlawing free railroad passes for politicians; imposing a two-cent street railway maximum fare; and abolishing corporate campaign contributions. He tried, with less success, to lower the high protective tariff in Washington.

==Early life==
Cummins was born in a log house in Carmichaels, Pennsylvania, the son of Sarah Baird (Flenniken) and Thomas L. Cummins, a carpenter who also farmed. He attended different schools including the Greene Academy at Carmichaels, and was matriculated at Waynesburg College.

He completed required classes at Waynesburg College, but was not graduated because of a dispute with the college&#x27;s president regarding Darwinism. After leaving college, he initially became a tutor and taught at a country school. At age nineteen, Cummins came with his maternal uncle to Elkader, Iowa, finding employment in the Clayton County recorder&#x27;s office and also worked as a carpenter. In 1871, he relocated to Allen County, Indiana, where he labored as a railway clerk, carpenter, construction engineer, express company manager, and deputy county surveyor.

==Lawyer==
Cummins moved to Chicago where he studied law while clerking in an attorney&#x27;s office; he was admitted to the Illinois Bar in 1875. After practicing law in Chicago for three years, he set up a practice in Des Moines, Iowa. At first, Cummins mainly represented businessmen in court, thus improving his finances and achieving prominence in Des Moines&#x27; high society. However, in his most famous case as an attorney he represented a group of Iowa farmers from the Grange movement against Washburn and Moen, a barbed wire trust, as farmers tried to break an eastern syndicate&#x27;s monopoly of the production of barbed wire by running their own factory. However, historians consider his representation of farmers in the barbed wire case to be an anomaly because more often he represented corporations or businessmen.

==Political career==
After identifying with the Republican Party, Cummins became active first in state and later in national politics. He attended every state and national Republican convention between 1880 and 1924, he served as an Iowa state legislator in 1888 to 1890, he was a presidential elector in 1892, and he was elected to the Republican National Committee in 1896 to 1900. Cummins found political support in the Progressive faction of the Iowa&#x27;s GOP and challenged Iowa&#x27;s Republican establishment represented by Senator William B. Allison, Congressman David B. Henderson and Representative William P. Hepburn.

In 1887, Cummins was elected to a single term in the Iowa State Senate representing Des Moines. He was asked to serve as temporary chair of the 1892 State Republican Convention. He unsuccessfully pursued a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1894. In 1896 he was active in the William McKinley campaign, and was appointed as Iowa&#x27;s representative on the Republican National Committee.

===Running for U.S. Senate===
In 1900, Cummins was passed over twice for the U.S. Senate. In early 1900, when the Iowa General Assembly exercised its former power to choose a U.S. senator for the Class 2 seat, to serve from 1901 to 1907, Cummins was the opponent of incumbent Republican John H. Gear, but withdrew when it appeared he lacked the votes to win. After Gear suffered a fatal heart attack in July 1900, Governor Leslie M. Shaw rejected numerous appeals to appoint Cummins to the vacancy, and instead appointed Jonathan P. Dolliver. Cummins initially vowed to seek the seat again in the 1901 legislative session, but instead focused on winning the 1901 election for governor of Iowa.

===Governor of Iowa===
Cummins served as governor of Iowa between 1902 and 1908, becoming the first Iowa governor elected to three successive terms. In the third election he won tight races for the Republican nomination against George D. Perkins, editor of the &quot;Sioux City Journal&quot;, and in the general election against Democrat Claude R. Porter. While governor he led efforts to establish compulsory education, a state department of agriculture, and a system of primary elections.

Cummins became identified with an approach to tariff-setting known as &quot;the Iowa idea&quot;. The &quot;Iowa idea&quot;, as stated in the Iowa Republican Party&#x27;s 1902 platform, favored &quot;such amendments of the Interstate Commerce Act as will more fully carry out its prohibition of discrimination in ratemaking, and [such] modifications of the tariff schedules [as] may be required to prevent their affording a shelter to monopoly.&quot; The &quot;Iowa idea&quot; embodied the principle that tariff rates should accurately measure the difference between the cost of production here and abroad, but not set rates higher than necessary to protect home industries.

===U.S. senator===

In June 1908, Governor Cummins ran in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate seat held by William B. Allison, who was seeking a record seventh term. Cummins was accused of breaking an earlier promise not to challenge Allison, and lost by over 12,000 votes. However, Senator Allison died on August 4, 1908, two months after the primary and before the Iowa General Assembly chose among the primary winners. In November 1908, a second Republican primary was held, which Cummins won decisively. Later that month and again two months later, in January 1909, Cummins was appointed by the Iowa General Assembly over Democratic rival Claude R. Porter. He served as U.S. senator from Iowa for 18 years, from 1908 until his death in 1926. He served as president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate between 1919 and 1925. He also chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Committee on Interstate Commerce.

Cummins generally supported President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s initiatives to regulate business, and authored a clause of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Although Cummins voted in favor of the 1917 United States declaration of war on Germany when Wilson requested it, he sided most often with his party than with Wilson on other foreign policy issues, opposing the arming of merchant ships in early 1917 and U.S. membership in a League of Nations in 1919 and 1920.

It was as Interstate Commerce Commission chair that Cummins sponsored the Esch-Cummins Act of 1920, establishing the conditions for the return of the railroads to private control after their government operation during World War I. Labor activists complained that the bill perpetuated harsh limits on collective bargaining, including provisions making it a crime to encourage a railroad strike, in the absence of a wartime emergency. It symbolized Cummins&#x27; postwar break with the progressive movement, which would ultimately contribute to his defeat.

===Pursuit of the presidency===

In January 1912, Cummins announced his intention to run for the Republican presidential nomination. He was considered as a candidate at the 1912 Republican National Convention. However, during the turmoil following the walkout of Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s supporters, Cummins&#x27;s name was not placed in the presidential ballot. In the national election, Cummins supported Roosevelt rather than Taft, even though he opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s creation of a third party.

In 1916, Cummins again ran for the Republican presidential nomination at the 1916 Republican National Convention. This time, with no incumbent president of his own party, delegates were split among over a dozen candidates on the first ballot on which Cummins finished fifth. After Cummins again finished fifth on the second ballot, he released his delegates, contributing to the third-ballot victory of Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes.

===Defeat and death===
In June 1926, insurgent Smith W. Brookhart defeated Cummins in the Republican primary for Cummins&#x27; Senate seat. Two months earlier, Brookhart had been removed from Iowa&#x27;s other U.S. Senate seat when a majority of his colleagues in the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate voted in favor of Democrat Dan Steck&#x27;s challenge to the outcome of the 1924 Brookhart-Steck race. Cummins had refused to take a position on the election contest, knowing that if Brookhart were unseated he would likely run for Cummins&#x27;s seat. The month after his primary defeat, Cummins died in Des Moines. He is buried at the Woodland Cemetery there.

===Political legacy===

Apart from being the Iowa governor and U.S. senator, Cummins is remembered for serving as president pro tempore of the Senate from 1919 to 1925. In addition, two times he declared his intentions to run for the Republican presidential nomination but did not succeed. Cummins was perhaps the most influential and charismatic Progressive leader in Iowa politics in the first quarter of the 20th century. However, he gradually turned more conservative moving from La Follette&#x27;s Progressivism to the New Era Republicanism of Warren G. Harding. In the 1890s, he led the Iowa Republican Party&#x27;s progressive wing, or the so-called &quot;insurgents&quot;, to power at the expense of its &quot;old guard&quot; of standpatters, who had controlled the party almost since its inception. After his postwar withdrawal from the progressive movement and shortly before his death, Cummins was defeated by a progressive contender within his own party.

==Family==
On June 24, 1874, Cummins married Ida Lucette Gallery; they had one child, a daughter. His wife, Ida L. Cummins, was an activist in the suffrage movement and very influential in the development of Iowa child labor laws.

<doc id="741383" wikidata="Q1375718" url="?curid=741383" title="Homer Stille Cummings">
<text>Homer Stille Cummings (April 30, 1870 – September 10, 1956) was an American lawyer and politician who was the United States attorney general from 1933 to 1939. He also was elected mayor of Stamford, Connecticut, three times before founding the legal firm of Cummings &amp; Lockwood in 1909. He served as chairman of Democratic National Committee between 1919 and 1920.

==Early life and career==
Cummings was born in Chicago, Illinois, on April 30, 1870, and graduated from the Heathcote School in Buffalo, New York. He earned a Bachelor of Philosophy degree from the Sheffield School of Yale University in 1891, and completed his degree at Yale Law School two years later. Practicing law in Stamford, he joined with Charles D. Lockwood in 1909 to form Cummings &amp; Lockwood, remaining a partner in the firm until 1933.

Three years after entering private practice, Cummings supported William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s 1896 presidential bid. Connecticut (Silver) Democrats nominated him for Secretary of State. As a Progressive whose oratorical skills made him a dramatic trial lawyer, Cummings seemed a natural for the political arena.

In 1900, 1901, and 1904, Cummings was elected mayor of Stamford. His two tenures as mayor were served from 1900 to 1902 and again from 1904 to 1906. At the time of his first election, he began a quarter-century of service as a committeeman from Connecticut with the national Democratic party. As mayor, he helped construct and improve streets and sewers, reorganized the police and fire departments, and secured a shorefront park that later was named for him.

Nominated for Congressman-at-large in 1902 and for U.S. Senator in 1910 and 1916, Cummings lost all three races by narrow margins. During the 1912 campaign, he directed the Democratic speaker&#x27;s bureau from Washington, D.C., then served as vice-chairman of the national committee from 1913 to 1919. He served as chairman for the next two years.

During the period from 1914 to 1924, Cummings served as the state attorney for Connecticut in Fairfield County. During his last year as county prosecutor, a vagrant and discharged army soldier, Harold Israel, was indicted for the murder in Bridgeport of Father Hubert Dahme, a popular parish priest. Despite police evidence that included a confession and a .32 revolver, which the suspect had and which produced a fired cartridge consistent with the bullet in the deceased, Cummings conducted a thorough investigation of the crime. He eventually found Israel innocent and dropped the indictment. In 1931, the National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement (the Wickersham Commission) praised this act. A 1947 film &quot;Boomerang!&quot; was based on the case, directed by Elia Kazan, with Dana Andrews as Cummings.

During the bitterly divided 1924 Democratic National Convention, Cummings tried to calm the delegates by formulating a compromise plank on the controversial issue of the Ku Klux Klan, which had been revived in the previous decade. Unlike most Northeastern Democrats, he supported William G. McAdoo over Alfred E. Smith for the presidential nomination.

==Marriage and family==
Cummings was married four times, the first two ending in divorce. In 1897, he wed Helen W. Smith, a union that lasted 10 years. The couple had one son, Dickinson Schuyler Cummings, before their divorce. His 1909 marriage to Marguerite T. Owings ended in divorce in 1928.

The following year, he married Mary Cecilia Waterbury, and it lasted until her death in 1939. He had a memoir, &quot;The Tired Sea&quot; (1939), published as a tribute to her. In 1942, he married Julia Alter, who died in 1955.

==Later political career==
After nearly a decade out of the spotlight, Cummings reentered politics. In 1932, he helped persuade 24 senators and numerous congressmen to announce their support for Franklin D. Roosevelt. At the Chicago convention, he planned strategy, operated as floor manager, and delivered a resounding seconding speech.

Following the election, Roosevelt chose Cummings as governor-general of the Philippines. Two days before the inauguration, Thomas J. Walsh, who had been designated attorney general, died. Upon taking office on March 4, 1933, Roosevelt named Cummings to lead the Justice Department. Cummings served almost six years as attorney general. Only William Wirt (1817–1829), Janet Reno (1993–2001), and Eric Holder (2009–2015) have had longer tenures in the position.

Cummings transformed the Department of Justice by establishing uniform rules of practice and procedure in federal courts. He secured the passage of twelve laws that buttressed the &quot;Lindbergh Law&quot; on kidnapping, made bank robbery a federal crime, cracked down on interstate transportation of stolen property, and extended federal regulations over firearms. He strengthened the Federal Bureau of Investigation, called a national crime conference, supported the establishment of Alcatraz as a model prison for hardened offenders, and reorganized the internal administration of the department. In 1937, Cummings published &quot;We Can Prevent Crime&quot;, and, with Carl McFarland, an assistant attorney general, &quot;Federal Justice&quot;, a departmental history. &quot;The Selected Papers of Homer Cummings&quot; (1939), edited by Carl B. Swisher, supplemented the history.

Cummings served as the chief protector of New Deal programs. During his first week as attorney general, he advised Roosevelt that the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 permitted the president to close banks and regulate gold hoarding and export. Cummings personally argued the right of the government to ban gold payments before the U.S. Supreme Court and won the &quot;gold clause&quot; cases. But, during 1935–1936, the Court overthrew eight key New Deal statutes, including the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) and the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA).

Frustration over the conservative nature of the Court, coupled with outrage over the proliferation of lawsuits and injunctions against the government, made Cummings eager to expand the judiciary. After the 1936 presidential election, Roosevelt instructed him to draft legislation for court reform. Neither man wanted to attempt to amend the Constitution.

Conservative Justice James McReynolds had proposed to add a judge for every judge who refused to retire at age seventy at full pay. Such a measure might give the president the opportunity to appoint fifty new judges, including six to the Supreme Court. Roosevelt launched the proposal, prepared secretly by Cummings, on February 5, 1937. The ensuing uproar over the &quot;court-packing plan&quot; helped kill the bill after 168 days; the Senate returned it to committee. (Of the so-called &quot;four horsemen&quot; of the US Supreme Court who consistently opposed the New Deal: Van Devanter resigned May 18, 1937; Sutherland resigned January 17, 1938; Butler died November 16, 1939; and McReynolds resigned January 31, 1941.)

Cummings retired on January 2, 1939, entering private law practice in Washington. He helped develop a spring golf tournament that annually brought executives, lawyers, and politicians together. He also retained his interest in the Connecticut Democratic party, along with a residence in Greenwich, Connecticut. He served on the Greenwich Town Committee until 1951.

Cummings&#x27;s papers are held at the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia.

==In pop culture==
In 1961, character actor Robert F. Simon appeared as Cummings in an episode of ABC&#x27;s crime drama, &quot;The Untouchables.&quot;

<doc id="741395" wikidata="Q6904644" url="?curid=741395" title="Monte Attell">
<text>Monte Attell (July 28, 1885 – November 11, 1960), born in the Nob Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California, United States, was an American boxer.

In his career he faced world bantamweight champion Jimmy Reagan and the lesser-known Danny Webster in title defenses, and after losing his title, Frankie Britt, champions Johnny Kilbane, and Joe Lynch. He took the vacant World Bantamweight title on June 19, 1909, by defeating the 1904 bantamweight title holder Frankie Neil. He held the title until February 22, 1910.

==Early life and career==
Attell was born on July 18, 1885, to a struggling Jewish family that, by one account, eventually had eighteen children. As a poor Jewish kid of diminutive stature raised in a tough Irish neighborhood, Attell began his career as a fighter from a very early age. As his older brother Abe Attell (1884–1970) was the Featherweight Champion of the World during the same period, Monte and Abe became the first brothers to simultaneously hold world boxing titles. Their brother, Caesar, also fought and was called &quot;Two and a Half,&quot; for always giving that amount whenever the hat was passed for charity at boxing events. Like his brother Abe, Monte spent some of his youth and likely some of his later life selling newspapers for a living. At the age of 14, Attell was treated for burns to the face and hands from a childhood accident with a toy cannon which may have contributed to his decline as a boxer as he aged.

From fighting for survival in the streets, Monte Attell turned professional by 1902, winning his first five bouts. He lost several of his early bouts, but between February 1906 and May 1909, he won ten continuous matches. His performance earned him a chance to fight for the vacant Bantamweight championship in 1909.

Before his world Bantamweight championship bout, Attell defeated Dusty Miller on November 5, 1904, in a six-round points decision at the Chicago Athletic Club. Two weeks later, Attell defeated Miller again at the West End Athletic Club in St. Louis, in a ten-round points decision. In their bout in St. Louis, Attell had the lead throughout, boring in constantly, and defending with skill. Miller fought back gamely, but Attell clearly held the better hand. In the fifth to the ninth rounds, Miller stalled, and though he rallied in the tenth, the round finished even. Attell received the decision for his ability to penetrate Miller&#x27;s defenses with stronger, if at times less frequent blows.

Attell knocked out Johnny Reagan on December 22, 1904, in seventeen rounds in St. Louis. Though the first nine rounds were close, and Reagan knocked down Attell in the sixth, from the thirteenth through the seventeenth, Attell took the advantage. In the seventeenth, a left and right to the jaw, preceded by a single blow to the chin sent Reagan to the canvas for the full count. In two previous meetings at St. Louis&#x27;s West End Club, Attell had won in a close fifteen round points decision in St. Louis on December 15, 1904, and in an eighth round points decision the previous month.

===Loss to flyweight champ Owen Moran, 1905===

Attell lost to accomplished British boxer Owen Moran on May 15, 1905, in a twenty-round points decision at the Pallisades in New York before a private, affluent crowd of around 150, who paid as much as $10 to see the fight, a princely sum in that era. Moran held the BBBC Flyweight Championship of Great Britain in 1903 and would compete several times for the Bantamweight Championship of his native land. Moran fought with more telling blows which won him the decision. By the sixth, both fighters were fatigued, and in the seventh, Moran hooked a strong left to the jaw of Attell staggering him and causing him to fall against the ropes as the round ended. Moran tried to finish Attell through the final ten rounds, but was unable, as his opponent would retreat or clinch to save himself. The bout caused a serious eye injury to Attell which became permanent and eventually led to blindness.

On March 29, 1905, Attell fought Jimmy Walsh in Philadelphia in what many sources considered a World Bantamweight Title match that ended when the referee called a disqualification against Walsh in the sixth round for a low blow. One source noted that Walsh, &quot;had the better of the bout from the start&quot;, and that the blow which occurred two minutes into the sixth round was accidental. Attell claimed to have been injured, and a foul was called by the referee, but Walsh was recognized as the Bantamweight Champion, by the National Boxing Association.

In an early loss against a known competitor, Attell lost to Freddie Weeks on September 3, 1906, in a fifth-round knockout at the Grand Opera House at Victor, Colorado. Weeks was a quick and scrappy competitor who fought some of the best, including Monte&#x27;s brother Abe in October 1907 and January 1909 in unsuccessful title matches for the World Featherweight Championship. 

Attell defeated Mike Kutchos on November 25, 1908, for the Pacific Coast Bantamweight Title, winning in a fifteen-round points decision. 

Attell drew with Jimmy Walsh at the Colliseum in San Francisco in a fifteen-round points decision on December 21, 1908. Walsh claimed to hold the World Bantamweight Title at the time, and the bout was billed as a World Bantamweight Title match for the limit of 116 pounds, but no title officially changed hands, as Walsh was overweight. As was typically the case with Attell, he was superior in the infighting, but Walsh lead and was more aggressive in the bout, and he may have landed the more telling blows, accounting for the draw decision. In the fifteenth, Walsh battered Attell badly making up any lead Attell enjoyed, and Attell&#x27;s face appeared far more battered at the end of the bout.

==World bantamweight champion, 1909==

On June 19, 1909, Monte Attell won the World Bantamweight title defeating former champion Frankie Neil at Coffroth&#x27;s Arena, in an eighteenth-round knockout in Colma, California. The bout was billed as a championship for the world bantamweight title. According to W. W. Naughton writing for the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot;, Attell won every round of the eighteen round bout, which was ended by a full left handed blow to the chin of Frankie Neil. Neil reportedly &quot;took a terrible mauling without flinching. From the very first it was apparent that the only chance Neil had was to outgame Attell and wear him down by persistent rushing for he was being outpunched at least two to one and the blows of the Hebrew fighter (Attell) were not the easiest either.&quot; Though Neil was the aggressor through much of the bout, Attell &quot;peppered Neil with straight lefts&quot;, brought crushing rights to the jaw, and delivered solid rights to the midsection that eventually took their toll on his opponent. In the fifteenth, Neil was down from a left to the stomach, and twice he stumbled to his hands and knees in the clinches. He was nearly finished at the end of the round from lefts and rights but was saved by the fifteenth&#x27;s closing bell. Though Attell could not finish Neil in the next two rounds, but in the eighteenth, as Neil first approached, Attell finished him with a straight left to the jaw that put him down for the count. Neil had last held the title in 1904, before losing it to British bantamweight Joe Bowker.

In the seven months following his winning the title on June 19, 1909, Attell successfully defended it seven times.

===Title matches with Jimmy Reagan, 1909===

He fought Jimmy Reagan on February 22, 1909, in a World Bantamweight Title match that resulted in a twenty-round points decision at the Mission Street Arena in San Francisco, California. In this match, Attell was down four times in the early rounds, though he came back quickly. The &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; had Attell winning every round after the seventh. On August 11, 1909, he successfully and more decisively defended his title once again against Jimmy Reagan in a fourth-round knockout in Oakland, California. Attell stood toe to toe with Reagan and &quot;outfoxed, outboxed, and outgeneralled him&quot;. Attell was noted to have fought excellently in close, while maintaining an excellent defense, ducking, dodging, and blocking with great effect. He had fought Reagan earlier in a non-title match in Oakland, California, on November 30, 1908, that resulted in a fifteen-round points decision.

===World bantam title defenses===
====Percy Cove====
On August 20, 1909, Attell defeated Percy Cove in a title bout and retained the world bantamweight championship in a tenth-round technical knockout before a packed house at the Mission Athletic Club in San Francisco. A left drive to the jaw in the tenth round put Cove against the ropes and nearly helpless in the tenth, though he had fought valiantly in the early rounds. By the third round, Attell was connecting hooks to the stomach of Cove and getting under his attempts to block, though Cove&#x27;s considerable advantage in reach and height served him well in the first two rounds. In the remaining rounds, Attell used blows to the stomach, followed by lefts to the face to even the match and take a lead in points. Cove&#x27;s left knocked down Attell once in the second, but Attell&#x27;s advantage in the remaining rounds took the starch out of Cove&#x27;s blows.

====Daniel Webster====
Attell drew with Daniel Webster on October 12, 1909, in another bantamweight title match. In this no decision bout, a win required agreement by two of three newspapers as to who had won the match, and since two Los Angeles newspapers called the fight even, it was officially declared a draw. Attell drew with Webster twice more in bantamweight title matches, once in a ten-round match in Los Angeles in November, 1909 and once in a twenty-round match in San Francisco in December of that year.

====Phil McGovern====
In a bout billed as a world bantamweight title match on January 30, 1911, Attell won a ten-round newspaper decision to retain his title against Phil McGovern, brother to champion Terry McGovern, at the Athletic Club in Brooklyn. In a close and brutal bout, McGovern sent Attell to the floor three times in the first round. The &quot;New York Tribune&quot; wrote that Attell traded punches with McGovern at three to one, and used his advantage in height and reach as well as a hard, straight punch that crossed inside to win their newspaper decision. Attell was down in the second as well from a swing to the jaw, though he rose quickly after his trip to the mat. McGovern sensed a quick victory, but Attell stood him off with straight lefts. McGovern&#x27;s aggressiveness made the bout look like a contest, and his ability to take his time with his opponent and effectively use lefts to the face, won him the decision of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;. Newspapers were divided on who had won the bout, but the local papers, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; favored Attell as the winner. The &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; wrote that Attell used stabbing lefts to counter McGovern&#x27;s advances in the fourth and fifth. After the fifth, Attell&#x27;s left to the face and right cross to the jaw dominated the bout, and took the steam from McGovern. In the ninth and tenth, McGovern staged an ineffective rally, and was stopped by Attell&#x27;s counterpunches.

====Johnny Daly====
Attell defeated Johnny Daly in a world bantamweight title match on October 2, 1911, in a close ten round points decision in New Orleans, Louisiana. The decision was not popular with the crowd, and the police stepped into the ring to protect the boxers. Attell, having a longer reach, used his left to shove back Daly&#x27;s face to gain an opening, and then connected with his right to the chin or chest on multiple occasions. Daly&#x27;s strong left failed often to reach its target against the rapid maneuvers of Attell, who showed better defensive ringcraft. By the tenth round, Attell&#x27;s right eye was a frequent object of Daly&#x27;s who connected with two lefts.

===Bouts with Jimmy Carroll===
Attell defeated Jimmy Carroll in a ten-round newspaper decision on October 26, 1909, at Piedmont Pavilion in Oakland. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;from the tap of the bell in the first round, he (Attell) took the aggressive and never once allowed Carroll the upper hand.&quot; Attell, who had been training and taking fights in the months preceding the contest, unlike Carroll, showed greater endurance and by the fifth this showed most strongly as he began to throw the most telling punches against Carroll. Carroll was down for a count of seven in the fifth. In the tenth round, Carroll tried to score enough points to gain a draw decision, but Attell was too far ahead on points and won the decision of most newspapers. Attell came in close with both hands, fighting a successful bout from the first to the final rounds. In their first meeting on January 12, 1904, Attell knocked out Carroll, only 1:59 seconds into the first round at Colma, California. In a subsequent meeting with Carroll on February 15, 1907, he fought a four-round draw in a points decision in San Francisco. Only two months later, on April 5, 1907, he lost to Carroll in a four-round points decision at Dreamland Pavilion in San Francisco. 

A year later on March 14, 1908, in one of their more well publicized bouts, Attell drew with Carroll in a fifteen-round points decision at Coffroth&#x27;s Arena in San Francisco. Carroll, who was outweighed by Attell, fought on the aggressive and evened the points scoring as Attell fought more defensively in the later rounds of the bout. Carroll, who was much slimmer than Attell, scored repeatedly with straight lefts, but did more poorly in the infighting, where Attell excelled. In the only knockdown of the fight, Attell sent Carroll to the canvas with a hard right to the chin, but was unable to score knockdowns in the subsequent rounds, where Carroll defended well, except in the infighting, making a draw decision a reasonable choice.

==Loss of Bantam title, 1910==

Attell lost the world bantamweight championship to Frankie Conley on February 22, 1910, at the Pacific Athletic Club in Vernon, a suburb of Los Angeles, by a knockout in the 42nd round.

Conley&#x27;s knockout win was something of a surprise to the audience, as he was only 20, and Attell was a well established champion. Conley staggered Attell with a right to the jaw in the thirteenth, but the first twenty rounds seemed rather even. By the 33rd round Attell seemed physically diminished from a blow to the chest from Conley. Astonishingly, neither men were down in the grueling bout until Attell took his final dive in the 42nd round. Attell&#x27;s left eye was closed, and he appeared to have taken worse injuries than his opponent. The grueling three hour spectacle ended when Conley knocked out Attell with a strong right. Some sources may give an earlier date as to when Attell first relinquished the World Bantamweight Title.

Attell fought a six-round draw with Jewish boxer Louisiana, on February 11, 1911, in Old City Hall in Pittsburgh. Joe Biderberg, known as Louisiana, was put to the canvas by Attell two minutes into the first round, but the battle resumed at as fast a pace as it had begun. Louisiana held frequently in clinches, likely tired and wary of the blows of Attell. Louisiana had the better of the outside boxing, showing great defense and ducking, but Attell excelled at the infighting, as was typical of his style. Louisiana showed better speed and was more illusive but Attell&#x27;s superior infighting, though brutal at times, made the decision of most newspapers a draw.

Attell defeated Patsy Brannigan on December 14, 1911, in a close six-round newspaper decision at Duquesne Gardens in Pittsburgh. Typical of Attell&#x27;s style, he had the best of the infighting. He was reviewed by the &quot;Pittsburgh Post&quot; as having cleaner, more telling blows, and though he allowed Brannigan to do most of the leading in the bout, he countered effectively and the blows he landed were harder than his opponents. The &quot;Post&quot; also noted that, as was typical of his style of fighting, he &quot;worked best in the clinches&quot;, and excelled in the infighting, and since it was the local paper, was used for the decision. Other newspapers noted that Brannigan&#x27;s aggressive display in the fifth and sixth rounds should have turned the decision in his favor.

==Boxing decline, eye injury==
Attell first fought Johnny Kilbane, future world featherweight champion from 1912 to 1923, on March 24, 1911, drawing in ten rounds in Cleveland, Ohio. One reporter noted that Kilbane injured his right hand in the first round and could only push it into Attell&#x27;s face when he half clinched, though he did damage with his strong right throughout the bout. Kilbane landed a storm of punches in the second round. Attell fought very aggressively and got in left slams to the body as well as stiff counterpunches to Kilbane&#x27;s face. On December 3, 1912, losing to Kilbane in a ninth-round technical knockout in Cleveland, Ohio, Attell was down more than six times before the police ordered the bout stopped to prevent a knockout. Kilbane became the aggressor in the second round and for much of the remainder of the bout, Attell had to cover up to save himself from Kibane&#x27;s fierce attack.

In a well publicized match, Attell lost to Al Delmont on April 12, 1911, in a twelve-round points decision in Boston. In the first two rounds, Delmont gained a considerable lead with lefts and rights to the face, but in the next seven rounds, Delmont clinched often, while Attell shot his left to the face and body and his right to the ribs. Delmont occasionally got his right to Attell&#x27;s face and landed right counters. With jabs and right crosses to the face and jaw, Delmont, showing his old form, earned a sufficient points margin in the eleventh and twelfth, to gain the popular decision. 

In a close bout, Attell again lost to Delmont in a twelve-round points decision on April 18, 1911, in the Arena in Boston. In a very close and hard-fought bout, Delmont did considerable jabbing, and Attell went to the body often with both hands. The eleventh round saw Delmont taking the lead, and in the twelfth his more aggressive fighting won him the very close decision.

Sometime in 1914, Attell incurred an eye injury that became infected, and eventually resulted in a loss of sight in the eye. 

Future world bantamweight champion, Joe Lynch knocked out Attell in the seventh round of a scheduled ten round bout at the Pioneer Sporting Club on September 5, 1916, in East Liverpool, Ohio. Lynch would hold the world bantamweight championship in the early 1920s. Attell was down in the first round.

Attell lost to Young Zulu Kid on June 24, 1916, in a ten-round newspaper decision of the &quot;New York Evening Telegram&quot; at the Fairmont Athletic Club in The Bronx. Despite a significant reach advantage over the diminutive Italian boxer, Attell lost the bout to the Kid who fought several quality competitors but lacked a winning record against them. The Kid had contended for the world flyweight title unsuccessfully on December 16, 1916, and would later contend for the American flyweight title. 

Attell fought top-rated boxer Frankie Britt near the end of his career on September 15, 1916, losing in a third-round knockout in Boston. The final blow was a short right to the jaw, delivered by Britt. Attell was reported in less than peak condition. Tellingly, though not unusual for an aging boxer in the era, particularly one with vision problems, Attell lost nineteen of twenty-four bouts between February 7, 1912, and October 30, 1916, near the end of his boxing career.

==Retirement, and death==
Attell initially retired from boxing in 1916, largely as the result of an eye infection that eventually led to his going blind in the eye. He had lost most of his vision in the other eye as a result of injuries sustained during his fight with Owen Moran in May 1905. One of his last bouts was a seven-round knockout loss on October 30, 1916, to Marty Taylor, known as Kid Taylor, a featherweight who had fought but not beaten several quality boxers. In his youth, he had knocked out Taylor on April 21, 1905, in New York.

In a final return to boxing on January 19, 1917, Attell lost to Manchester boxer Joe Morgan in Boston. Attell received a terrific lacing in the fifth, and appeared to be behind on points in every round, before he was put down for the count in the sixth by his opponent. Although he had fought some quality opposition, Attell did not win a single fight in 1916.

In time, a failed business and the Great Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s wiped out his savings. By February 1923, according to one source, Attell was short on funds, blind, and residing at the Alameda County Hospital. While blind, he was forced at one point to sell peanuts and cigarettes at fights to raise money, while a young man led him to his customers. Hearing of his plight, Jack Dempsey later financed a cigar stand in San Francisco that supplied Attell a decent living for many years. He was married to wife Mary, formerly Mary Forman, but had no children of their own. In 1957, he suffered a heart attack and retired to Palo Alto for a period. He died in 1960 at his home on South Court in Palo Alto.

<doc id="741396" wikidata="Q1639626" url="?curid=741396" title="Susan Pevensie">
<text>Susan Pevensie is a fictional character in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; series. Susan is the elder sister and the second eldest Pevensie child. She appears in three of the seven books—as a child in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; and &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, and as an adult in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;. She is also mentioned in &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; and &quot;The Last Battle&quot;. During her reign at the Narnian capital of Cair Paravel, she is known as Queen Susan the Gentle or Queen Susan of the Horn. She was the only Pevensie that survived the train crash (because she was not on the train or at the station) on Earth which sent the others to Narnia after &quot;The Last Battle&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
Susan was born in 1928 and is 12 years old when she appears in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. By &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, she is 21 years old, as the final novel takes place in 1949.

In &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, Susan and her brother Peter only discover Narnia after their younger siblings have already been there. Father Christmas gives Susan a bow with arrows that never miss their target, and a magical horn that brings aid when blown. Susan is advised to stay out of the battle. After the battle, she is crowned as Queen of Narnia by Aslan, and becomes known as Queen Susan the Gentle.

In &quot;Prince Caspian,&quot; Susan and the other Pevensies are magically transferred to Narnia from a railway station in England. She is described as being gentle and tender-hearted and she immerses herself in their adventures as deeply as in the first book. 

In &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, Susan accompanies her parents on a trip to America, while Peter is being tutored by Professor Digory Kirke.

In &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, set during the Pevensie siblings&#x27; reign in Narnia, Susan plays a minor part. She is asked to make a diplomatic marriage to the Calormene Prince Rabadash. She finds him gallant at tournaments in Narnia, but tyrannical and repellant on his home ground.

In &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, Susan is conspicuous by her absence. Peter says that she is &quot;no longer a friend of Narnia&quot;, and (in Jill Pole&#x27;s words) &quot;she&#x27;s interested in nothing now-a-days except nylons and lipstick and invitations.&quot; Thus, Susan does not enter the real Narnia with the others at the end of the series. It is left ambiguous whether Susan&#x27;s absence is permanent.

== Character development ==

In his &quot;Companion to Narnia&quot;, Paul F. Ford writes at the end of the entry for &quot;Susan Pevensie&quot; that &quot;Susan&#x27;s is one of the most important Unfinished Tales of The Chronicles of Narnia.&quot;

Lewis himself stated that:
Lewis further elaborated on Susan&#x27;s fate in a 19 February 1960 letter to Pauline Bannister, who wrote to Lewis, upset that Susan was excluded from her brothers and sister from Aslan&#x27;s country. He stated:

==Criticism==
Fantasy author Neil Gaiman&#x27;s 2004 short story &quot;The Problem of Susan&quot; depicts its protagonist, Professor Hastings (who strongly resembles an adult version of Susan), dealing with the grief and trauma of her entire family&#x27;s death in a train crash, as she is interviewed by a college literature student regarding her opinion on Susan&#x27;s place in the Narnia books. Since the publication of Gaiman&#x27;s story, &quot;the problem of Susan&quot; has become used more widely as a catchphrase for the literary and feminist investigation into Susan&#x27;s treatment.

Authors J. K. Rowling and Philip Pullman, both of whom were influenced by Lewis, have also commented on the issue:

<text>Dave Hilton Sr. (August 29, 1940 – July 2023) was a Canadian professional boxer. He won the Canadian championship in three different weight divisions. Hilton was the father of former super middleweight world champion, Dave Hilton Jr., and light middleweight world champion of boxing, Matthew Hilton.

Hilton fought between 1958 and 1976, winning 65 of his 81 fights. As a teenager, he fought as a Featherweight, winning the national championship in 1959. From 1958 onward, Hilton was a close friend of the gangster Frank Cotroni. In 1959, Cotroni drove Hilton from Montreal to Quebec City, where he won the Featherweight national championship. Cotroni told Hilton he liked to do a &quot;little rassling&quot; himself and noted that his nickname in Montreal was &quot;the Cyclone&quot; as he considered to be one of the toughest fighters in the Cotroni family. Hilton had a &quot;savage fighting style&quot;, but was only paid $500 per fight. During this time, Hilton started to abuse alcohol and often showed up drunk at his fights. Hilton came to be dependent on Cotroni to motivate him. Likewise, Cotroni paid Hilton&#x27;s rent and for his groceries, making him and his family very much dependent on Cotroni. In 1990, Hilton stated that allegation that he and his sons lost matches for Cotroni were &quot;lies&quot; and called Cotroni his best friend, saying: &quot;I have no regrets whatsoever. He&#x27;s still my friend&quot;.

As Hilton&#x27;s career progressed, he saw an increase in weight and moved up to the Welterweight division, where he competed for over a decade. In 1971, he secured the Canadian Light Middleweight championship, and within the same year, he added a third title to his name by claiming the Canadian Middleweight championship.

Although Dave Hilton Sr. garnered recognition during his boxing career, his role as a manager and trainer for his three sons brought him the most attention. All three of his sons achieved Canadian championships, with two of them even becoming world champions.

Throughout their journey, the Hilton family has faced legal issues and tragic events. Hilton Sr. was barred from entering the United States temporarily after past crimes were revealed.

Dave Hilton Sr. died in July 2023, at the age of 83.

<doc id="741426" wikidata="Q283102" url="?curid=741426" title="Afternoon">
<text>Afternoon is the time between noon and sunset or evening. It is the time when the sun is descending from its peak in the sky to somewhat before its terminus at the horizon in the west. In human life, it occupies roughly the latter half of the standard work and school day. In literal terms, it refers to a time specifically after noon.

== Terminology ==
Afternoon is often defined as the period between noon and sunset. If this definition is adopted, the specific range of time varies in one direction: noon is defined as the time when the sun reaching its highest point in the sky, but the boundary between afternoon and evening has no standard definition. However, before a period of transition from the 12th to 14th centuries, &quot;noon&quot; instead referred to 3:00 pm. Possible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along which one concept of &quot;noon&quot; was defined—and so &quot;afternoon&quot; would have referred to a narrower timeframe.

The word &quot;afternoon&quot;, which derives from &quot;after&quot; and &quot;noon&quot;, has been attested from about the year 1300; Middle English contained both &quot;afternoon&quot; and the synonym &quot;aftermete&quot;. The standard phrasing was &quot;at afternoon&quot; in the 15th and 16th centuries, but has shifted to &quot;in the afternoon&quot; since then. In American English dialects, the word &quot;evening&quot; is sometimes used to encompass all times between noon and midnight. The Irish language contains four different words to mark time intervals from late afternoon to nightfall; this period is considered mystical. Metaphorically, the word &quot;afternoon&quot; refers to a relatively late period in the expanse of time or in one&#x27;s life.

The equivalent of Earth&#x27;s afternoon on another planet would refer to the time the principal star of that planetary system would be in descent from its prime meridian, as seen from the planet&#x27;s surface.

== Events ==
Afternoon is a time when the sun is descending from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or early evening — archetypally, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm — so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let their students out around 3:00 pm during the mid afternoon. In Denmark, afternoon is considered between 1:00 and 5:00 pm.

== Effects on life ==
=== Hormones ===
In diurnal animals, it is typical for blood levels of the hormone cortisol—which is used to increase blood sugar, aid metabolism and is also produced in response to stress—to be most stable in the afternoon after decreasing throughout the morning. However, cortisol levels are also the most reactive to environmental changes unrelated to sleep and daylight during the afternoon. As a result, this time of day is considered optimal for researchers studying stress and hormone levels. Plants generally have their highest photosynthetic levels of the day at noon and in the early afternoon, owing to the sun&#x27;s high angle in the sky. The large proliferation of maize crops across Earth has caused tiny, harmless fluctuations in the normal pattern of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, since these crops photosynthesize large amounts of carbon dioxide during these times and this process sharply drops down during the late afternoon and evening.

=== Body temperature ===
In humans, body temperature is typically highest during the mid to late afternoon. However, human athletes being tested for physical vigor on exercise machines showed no statistically significant difference after lunch. Owners of factory farms are advised to use buildings with an east–west (as opposed to north–south) orientation to house their livestock, because an east–west orientation generally means thicker walls on the east and west to accommodate the sun&#x27;s acute angle and intense glare during late afternoon. When these animals are too hot, they are more likely to become belligerent and unproductive.

=== Alertness ===

The afternoon, especially the early afternoon, is associated with a dip in a variety of areas of human cognitive and productive functioning. Notably, motor vehicle accidents occur more frequently in the early afternoon, when drivers presumably have recently finished lunch. A study of motor accidents in Sweden between 1987 and 1991 found that the time around 5:00 pm had by far the most accidents: around 1,600 at 5:00 pm, compared to around 1,000 each at 4:00 pm and 6:00 pm. This trend may have been influenced by the afternoon rush hour, but the morning rush hour showed a much smaller increase. In Finland, accidents in the agriculture industry are most common in the afternoon, specifically Monday afternoons in September.

One psychology professor studying circadian rhythms found that his students performed somewhat worse on exams in the afternoon than in the morning, but even worse in the evening. Neither of these differences, however, was statistically significant. Four studies carried out in 1997 found that subjects who were given tests on differentiating traffic signs had longer reaction times when tested at 3:00 pm and 6:00 pm than at 9:00 am and 12:00 pm. These trends are held across all four studies and for both complex and abstract questions. However, one UK-based researcher failed to find any difference in exam performance on over 300,000 A-level exam papers sat in either the morning or afternoon.

Human productivity routinely decreases in the afternoon. Power plants have shown significant reductions in productivity in the afternoon compared to the morning, the largest differences occurring on Saturdays and the smallest on Mondays. One 1950s study covering two female factory workers for six months found that their productivity was 13 percent lower in the afternoon, the least productive time being their last hour at work. It was summarized that the differences came from personal breaks and unproductive activities at the workplace. Another, larger study found that afternoon declines in productivity were greater during longer work shifts.

Not all humans share identical circadian rhythms. One study across Italy and Spain had students fill out a questionnaire, then ranked them on a &quot;morningness–eveningness&quot; scale. The results were a fairly standard bell curve. Levels of alertness over the course of the day had a significant correlation with scores on the questionnaire. All categories of participants—evening types, morning types, and intermediate types—had high levels of alertness from roughly 2:00 pm to 8:00 pm, but outside this window their alertness levels corresponded to their scores.

<text>131 Vala is an inner main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by C. H. F. Peters on 24 May 1873, and derives its name from &quot;völva&quot; (&quot;vǫlva&quot;, ), a prophetess in Norse paganism. One observation of an occultation of a star by Vala is from Italy (26 May 2002). 10-μm radiometric data collected from Kitt Peak in 1975 gave a diameter estimate of 34 km.

In the Tholen classification system, it is categorized as an SU-type asteroid, while the Bus asteroid taxonomy system lists it as a K-type asteroid. Photometric observations of this asteroid during 2007 at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico were used to create a &quot;nearly symmetric bimodal&quot; light curve plot. This showed a rotation period of 10.359 ± 0.001 hours and a brightness variation of 0.09 ± 0.02 magnitude during each cycle. The result is double the 5.18-hour period reported in the JPL Small-Body Database.

On 2028-Apr-05, Vala will pass from asteroid 2 Pallas.

<text>Sinner is the debut studio album by the American rock band Drowning Pool, released on June 5, 2001, by Wind-up Records. It is considered to be the band&#x27;s most popular album, being certified platinum in the same year that it was released. This was due at least in part to &quot;Bodies&quot; which remains the band&#x27;s most well-known song. This is the only studio album by the band to feature original lead singer Dave Williams. While touring in support of &quot;Sinner&quot;, he died on August 14, 2002, from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The album debuted at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Drowning Pool released a reissue of the album called the &quot;Unlucky 13th Anniversary Edition&quot; in 2014. The album was put at no. 25 on Metal Descent&#x27;s list &quot;The 25 Best Alternative Metal Albums&quot;. Their songs &quot;Mute&quot;, &quot;Told You So&quot;, and &quot;Reminded&quot; were featured on &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Cooler&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

==Writing and recording==
Dave Williams explained how the album got its name in an MTV interview: 

Williams also remarked on the track order: &quot;We wanted to start with &#x27;Sinner&#x27; and end with &#x27;Sermon&#x27;. We covered all the bases on religion and bad relationships.&quot;

On &quot;Sermon&quot;, Mike Luce stated: 

The Unlucky 13th Anniversary Edition of the album contains an unreleased demo called &quot;Heroes Sleeping&quot;. CJ Pierce explained the meaning of the song:

==History==
Mongolian people have lived around the area of Lake Baikal since the fifth century, with Mongolic-related Slab Grave cultural monuments found in Baikal territory. Over time, the Mongolic peoples of the regions developed into distinct groups, one of which became the Buryats. Further divisions of the Buryats came from those living on the western shore of Lake Baikal, with better land for agriculture, and those in the east, who practiced nomadism more regularly and continued residing in moveable felt yurts. As a result of the superior farmland, the western side of Lake Baikal was settled by European peasants during the time of the Russian Empire – western Buryats were more exposed to and influenced by the culture, religions, and economy of their European neighbors, whereas the eastern Buryats maintained closer ties to other Mongolic peoples, Buddhism, and Asian civilizations.

The territory of Buryatia has been governed by the Xiongnu Empire (209 BC-93 CE) and Mongolian Xianbei state (93–234), Rouran Khaganate (330–555), First Turkic Khaganate (552-603), Eastern Turkic Khaganate (682-744), Tang dynasty (647–784), Uyghur Khaganate (744-840), Yenisei Kyrgyz Khaganate (840-1208), Mongol Empire (1206–1368), and Northern Yuan (1368–1635). Medieval Mongol tribes such as the Merkit, Bayads, Barga Mongols and Tümeds inhabited Buryatia.

=== Imperial Russia ===
Cossacks and other tsarists officials began moving eastward into the western Buryat lands in 1625, where they estimated 30,000 Buryats were living in southeastern Siberia, collecting tribute from other, small Siberian tribes. The Buryats resisted the incorporation into the Russian Empire&#x27;s tribute system (&quot;yasak&quot;) that demanded a yearly supply of furs; it was not until the 1680s that the last of the eastern Buryat lands were forced to participate in the yasak system. In 1666, the fort of Udinskoye was founded. This area later became known as Verkhneudinsk – in 1934, it was renamed Ulan-Ude, the present-day capital of Buryatia.

From 1727 it was the border crossing for the Kyakhta trade between Russia and China. Kyakhta&#x27;s founder, the Serb Sava Vladislavich, established it as a trading point between Russia and the Qing Empire. The 1820 reforms of Mikhail Speransky established indirect rule over Buryatia by codifying the local clan leaders as official members of the &quot;steppe duma&quot; in order to incorporate them into the existing imperial government.

Buddhism was recognized as an official religion of the Russian Empire by Empress Elizabeth in 1741, with the first Pandito Khambo Lama, the spiritual leader of Buryat Buddhists, elected in 1764. The first person to serve in this role was Damba Dorzha Zaiaev (1711–1776). At the time of the Bolshevik Revolution, Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov served as the 12th Pandito Khambo Lama of Eastern Siberia from 1911 to 1917. Itigilov stepped down in 1917 at the time of the revolution and later encouraged his students to flee to Mongolia, though he refused to flee himself.

=== Soviet Buryatia ===
National movements, including that of Buryatia, began to foment after the February Revolution in 1917. From March 1917, the leading Buryat intelligentsia organized a number of conferences in cities such as Petrograd, Chita, Irkutsk, and Verkhneudinsk (present-day Ulan-Ude) and invited representatives from Buryat administrative districts of the Irkutsk and Transbaikalia regions. The culmination of these conferences was the first All-Buryat Congress in 23-25 April 1917 in Chita, where activists advocated for a self-governing Buryat Autonomous Region, based on the models of Poland and Finland, with an elected body, the Buryat National Duma, that all Buryats, men and women, over the age of 18 and without criminal convictions, would participate in. This Duma would elect a permanent executive body, the Buryat National committee, which would take on responsibilities such as organizing the elections, assembling the Buryat Duma, and publishing works in the Buryat language. Among other topics discussed at the Congress were the establishment of an Education Council to create Buryat schools, trained educators, and curricula that included the history of the Buryats and Mongols and Buryat studies. 

After the November Revolution in 1917, the Buryats bid for independence was complicated by the arrival of a Japanese expeditionary force into Buryatia in 1918. The Buryat national leaders saw the Japanese as potential and critical allies in assisting the independence movement, but the cooperation ultimately failed due to the conflicting agendas. The Red Army advanced in Buryatia in 1920 and continued to Outer Mongolia in 1921. Attracted to the promises of self-determination and territorial autonomy by the Bolsheviks, and having lost the cooperation of the Japanese, the Buryat leaders embraced the idea of building a Buryat nation with the new Soviet state. In 1923, the Buryat Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (; ) was created as a result of the merger of State of Buryat and Buryat Oblast and promised territorial autonomy.
In 1929, a revolt was suppressed in Buryatia, caused by collectivisation and repression of Buddhism. In 1937, Aga Buryatia and Ust-Orda Buryatia were detached from the Buryat-Mongolian ASSR and merged with Chita and Irkutsk Oblasts, respectively. In 1958, the name &quot;Mongol&quot; was removed from the name of the republic and simply became the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of Buryatia within the vast multi-ethnic, diverse Soviet Union. 

The Ivolginsky Datsan was opened in 1945 as the only Buddhist spiritual centre of the USSR, home to the Central Spiritual Board of Buddhists of the USSR, the state-controlled sangha.

The Buryat intelligentsia were active throughout Buryatia and beyond, into Tibet and Mongolia. At the turn of the 20th century, Buryats leaders, such as Batu-dalai Ochirov and Mikhail Bogdanov, began actively writing political articles about the threat to Buryatia and Buryat existence from Russia. Despite their noted influence from 1900 to 1930, most of them were purged, killed outright or sent to concentration camps, in the 1930s. 

The leader of the Buryat ASSR from 1962 to 1984 was Andrei Urupkheevich Modogoev. In the 1970s, Soviet authorities began two major industrial projects in Buryatia: the Gusinoozerskii power station to the south of Ulan-Ude and the construction of the Baikal–Amur Mainline railway in northern Buraytia. The construction of both projects, particularly the railway, required recruiting campaigns to bring workers from other parts of the country to Buryatia. Towns developed along the railroad, and the urban population in northern Buryatia doubled between 1979 and 1989. In addition to the Russians who moved to Buryatia for work, Buryats from other parts of southern Siberia also migrated to the Buryat ASSR, particularly Ulan-Ude and other cities for jobs and educational opportunities. Prior to World War II, less than 10% of Buryats lived in urban areas, compared to almost half at the time of the fall of the Soviet Union. By 1989, one-third of the Buryat population of the Buryat ASSR was living in Ulan-Ude.

=== Post-Soviet Buryatia ===
The Buryat ASSR declared its sovereignty in 1990 and adopted the name &quot;Republic of Buryatia&quot; in 1992. However, it remained an autonomous republic within the Russian Federation. On 11 July 1995 Buryatia signed a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, granting it autonomy. This agreement was abolished on 15 February 2002.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, autonomous republics such as Buryatia did not have the right to secede. However they retained considerable autonomy, with a separate legislature and president. However this autonomy has been curtailed following the 2004 law passed by Vladimir Putin that decreed regional governors and presidents were to be appointed, rather than directly elected.

==Politics==
The head of the Republic is the Head (formerly President), who the voters of the republic elect for a four-year term. From 2004 to 2012 the head of Buryatia (along with all other heads of regions in Russia) was nominated directly by the Russian President.

Between 1991 and 2007, the President was Leonid Vasilyevich Potapov, who was elected on 1 July 1994, re-elected in 1998 (with 63.25% of votes), and then re-elected again on 23 June 2002 (with over 67% of votes). Prior to the elections, Potapov was the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic—the highest post at that time.

The current Head of the Republic is Alexey Tsydenov, who was elected by popular vote on 10 September 2017. Prior to this he was acting Head, having been appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in February 2017.

The Republic&#x27;s parliament is the People&#x27;s Khural, popularly elected every five years. The People&#x27;s Khural has 66 deputies and is currently dominated by the country&#x27;s ruling party, United Russia, with 45 seats. Vladimir Anatolyevich Pavlov has been Chairman of the People&#x27;s Khural since September 2019.

The Republic&#x27;s Constitution was adopted on 22 February 1994.

In the 2024 Russian presidential election, which critics called rigged and fraudulent, President Vladimir Putin won 87.96% of the vote in Buryatia.

==Administrative divisions==
As of 2013, Buryatia is divided into 21 districts, 6 cities or towns, 16 urban-type settlements and 238 selsoviets and somons.

===Ethnic groups===
According to the 2021 Census, ethnic Russians make up 64% of the republic&#x27;s population, while the ethnic Buryats comprise 32.5% of the population. Other groups include Soyots (0.5%) and a host of smaller groups, each accounting for less than 0.5% of the total population.
===Religion===
Traditionally, Buryats adhered to belief systems that were based on the deification of nature, belief in spirits, and the possibility of their magic influence on the surroundings. They were led by shamans, who systematized tribal beliefs and cults. From the second half of the 17th century, beliefs and cults in the shamanic form were displaced by Buddhism, which became widespread in ethnic Buryatia. By the end of the 19th century, the majority of Buryats were part of the Buddhist tradition. A synthesis of Buddhism and traditional beliefs that formed a system of ecological traditions has constituted a major attribute of Buryat culture. In 2003, the Local Religious Organization of Shamans, Tengeri was officially registered as a religious organization in Buryatia.

As of a 2012 survey 27.4% of the population adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 19.8% to Buddhism, 2% to the Slavic Native Faith, Tengrism or Buryat shamanism, 4% declares to be unaffiliated Christian (excluding Protestants), 1% are Orthodox Christian believers without belonging to churches or are members of other Orthodox churches, 1% are members of Protestant churches. In addition, 25% of the population declares to be &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, 13% to be atheist, and 10.8% follows another religion or did not give an answer to the survey.

Tibetan Buddhism and Orthodox Christianity are the most widespread religions in the republic. Many Slavs, who constitute around 67% of the population, are Russian Orthodox. Since the breakup of the USSR in 1991, a small number have converted to various Protestant denominations or to Rodnovery, also known as the Slavic native faith. There are also some Catholics among the Slavs. Most of the Germans (0.11% of the population) are also Orthodox, so are some other non-European groups like Armenians (0.23%), Georgians (0.03%), and Soyot (0.37%). Buryats constitute 30.04% of the total population.

Most urban Buryats are either Buddhist or Orthodox, while those in the rural areas often adhere to Yellow shamanism, a mixture of shamanism and Buddhism, or to Black shamanism. There are also Tengrist movements. Siberian Tatars are around 0.7% of the population. However, due to isolation from the main body of Tatars, many of them now are either non-religious or Orthodox. Islam is followed by immigrant groups like Azeris and Uzbeks, who constitute another 0.7% of the population.

===Education===
The higher education institutions of the republic include Buryat State University, Buryat State Academy of Agriculture, East Siberian State Academy of Arts and Culture, and East Siberia State University of Technology and Management.

==Economy==

The republic&#x27;s economy is composed of agricultural and commercial products including wheat, vegetables, potatoes, timber, leather, graphite, and textiles. Fishing, hunting, fur farming, sheep and cattle farming, mining, stock raising, engineering, and food processing are also important economic generators.
The unemployment rate of Buryatia was 11% in 2020.

GDP pro person nominal in 2018 was 3,650 USD and PPP in 2009 was 11,148 USD. 
==Tourism==
Lake Baikal is a popular tourist destination, especially in summer.

<text>The Joseph Regenstein Library (colloquially, the Reg) is the University of Chicago’s primary library, located on the University’s Hyde Park campus on the South Side of Chicago. Named after the industrialist and philanthropist Joseph Regenstein, it is one of the largest repositories of books in the world. The Regenstein is noted for its brutalist architecture.

==History==

The library stands on the former grounds of Stagg Field. In 1965, the Joseph Regenstein Foundation gave $10 million to the University for construction of the library. In 1968, the university broke ground, and in 1970 the library opened at the final cost of $20,750,000. The building was designed by the Chicago firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, led by senior architect Walter Netsch. It is built out of grooved limestone, which, from a distance, resembles concrete. University tour guides often remark on the resemblance between each element of the building&#x27;s facade and the fore edge of a book. The University of Chicago Graduate Library School was housed in the Joseph Regenstein Library until its closure. Today, the &quot;Reg&quot; is the flagship institution of the University of Chicago Library system, which is considered among the top five in the world for breadth and depth of material, and receives high marks from users (&quot;The Princeton Review&quot; placed it in the top nine for college students).

The building has five floors above ground and two basements. Each floor has a large reading room in the center with desks, group study rooms, lockers and shelved reference works. The reading rooms on floors two and three are connected by a small atrium. The reading rooms are separated from the stacks, located on the west side of the building, so that the stacks can be maintained at lower temperatures, which are more amicable to book conservation. 220 faculty studies line the east side of the building.

The Regenstein&#x27;s overflowing collection posed space problems for the book stacks. In May 2005, the University of Chicago&#x27;s Board of Trustees authorized funding for a $42 million addition to the library, which was completed mid-2011. The Joe and Rika Mansueto Library, designed by Chicago-based architect Helmut Jahn, consists of a glass-domed reading room, under which lies an automated storage and retrieval system stretching fifty feet underground. It allows the library to maintain physical copies of materials available online while creating space within the book stacks to accommodate approximately 20 years of new print acquisitions.

The Regenstein Library is a popular social space for University of Chicago college students: &quot;On our campus, it&#x27;s not the football game that draws the biggest crowd, it&#x27;s evening study in the library,&quot; said former Provost Richard Saller. &quot;We&#x27;re a campus where the library is sort of the social center because it is the focus [of the university].&quot;

The Regenstein Library is also the location of the Special Collections Research Center, which houses rare book collections, manuscripts, and university archives. The SCRC was established in 1953 by Herman H. Fussler and was moved to the &quot;Reg&quot; when it opened in 1970. The rare books collection currently holds approximately 265,000 volumes.

It was owned by Trans States Holdings and headquartered in Bridgeton, Missouri. At the time of its closing, the airline operated flights for United Airlines under the United Express brand. Trans States Airlines ceased all operations on April 1, 2020.

==History==
The company began operations as Resort Air in 1982. As an independent commuter air carrier, Resort Air operated Swearingen Metro propjets from a small hub located in St. Louis (STL) with service to Carbondale, Illinois; Columbia, Missouri; Fort Leonard Wood, MO; Joplin, MO; Lake of the Ozarks, MO; Springfield, IL; and Springfield, MO. In 1985, the company entered into an agreement with Trans World Airlines (TWA) to operate as Trans World Express serving six cities in Missouri and Illinois. In 1989 Resort Air changed its name to Trans States Airlines. Many new aircraft were added to replace the Swearingen Metro planes including the BAe Jetstream model 31 and model 41 as well as much larger ATR 42s and ATR 72s. New service was added to many more cities from St. Louis and in 1999, Embraer ERJ 145 regional jets were added for the Trans World Express system expanding service to several cities much further distant from St. Louis.

In 1993 TSA began operations on the west coast as USAir Express at Los Angeles (LAX) with service to Fresno, Monterey, Ontario, CA, Orange County, Palm Springs, San Diego, and Santa Barbara nonstop from LAX with BAe Jetstream 31 propjets. The operation continued until the year 2000. 

On the east coast, in 1995, TSA began operations as a code share feeder airline into New York City JFK Airport for both Trans World Express and United Express. By 1999, Trans States had begun operations as a Delta Connection code share air carrier for Delta Air Lines at New York&#x27;s JFK Airport with Embraer ERJ 145 regional jets and BAe Jetstream 41 propjets with nonstop service to Albany, NY, Baltimore, Greensboro, NC, Hartford/Springfield, Norfolk, VA, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Raleigh/Durham, Richmond, VA and Rochester, NY. Flights under the USAirways Express banner were also performed at Pittsburgh.

In December 2001, TWA merged into American Airlines and all Trans States flights operating as Trans World Express then began flying and American Connection. American later dismantled the St. Louis hub operation created by TWA and the American Connection flights ended in 2009. In 2015 American merged with US Airways and the US Airways Express flights operated by Trans States then began flying as American Eagle. These flights then ended in 2018.

In 2006 Trans States briefly operated a small hub at San Antonio, Texas flying Embraer ERJ 145s. The service was performed under the United Express banner with flights from San Antonio to Albuquerque, Colorado Springs, Kansas City, New Orleans, Oklahoma City, Omaha, and Tulsa.

The call sign &quot;Waterski&quot; and the ICAO 3-letter identifier &quot;LOF,&quot; which stands for &#x27;Lodge of the Four Seasons&#x27;, are from the early days when the company was operated as Resort Air and took visitors to the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri.

In 2015, the airline began a hub operation at Denver under the United Express banner and carried 3.6 million passengers for the year. 

In February 2020, Trans States announced their intent to gradually cease operations through 2020 and transfer their fleet of ERJ-145&#x27;s to ExpressJet Airlines per an agreement with United Airlines. However, on March 17, 2020, CEO Rick Leach sent a memo to employees stating that due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, the airline would cease operations on April 1, 2020, much earlier than originally expected. Compass Airlines, another regional airline owned by Trans States Holdings, also announced a cessation of operations effective April 7, 2020, leaving GoJet Airlines as the only operating airline owned by Trans States Holdings. The ERJ 145s that were transferred to ExpressJet were then transferred to CommutAir later in 2020 as ExpressJet was subsequently shut down. CommutAir is also a United Express operator. 

The final Trans States Airlines flight was United Express Flight 4695 from Springfield, Missouri to Denver, Colorado on April 1, 2020.

== St. Louis TWA Express Hub Operations in 1990 ==

==United Express destinations==

==Fleet==
Prior to its shutdown, the Trans States Airlines fleet consisted of the following aircraft:

===Fleet development===
In October 2009, Trans States Holdings announced an agreement to purchase 50 Mitsubishi MRJ90 with options for 50 more. Trans States Holdings held conversion rights to take the smaller, 76-seat MRJ70 instead of the 92-seat MRJ90 dependent on the scope clause environment by the time the airline took delivery. The order was cancelled as of October 2019 due to concerns that the Mitsubishi SpaceJet M90 aircraft violates the US Scope clause laws.

In April 2013, Trans States Airlines began taking delivery of six former Passaredo Linhas Aéreas ERJ-145s. In 2015 Trans States began parking their United Express ERJ 145ERs, in exchange for ERJ 145XRs transferred from ExpressJet.

===Previously operated aircraft===
Prior to becoming an all-jet airline, Trans States operated several different turboprop aircraft types including:

* ATR 42
* ATR 72
* BAe Jetstream 31 
* BAe Jetstream 41
* Embraer EMB 120 
* Fairchild Metroliner III

These propjet aircraft were operated in code share feeder services for American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Trans World Airlines (TWA), USAir and US Airways.

<doc id="741459" wikidata="Q3190853" url="?curid=741459" title="Jérôme Choquette">
<text>Jérôme Choquette (; January 25, 1928 – September 1, 2017) was a lawyer and politician in Quebec, Canada. Choquette ran a private law practice, representing various claimants in a wide range of cases from his office on &quot;Avenue du Parc&quot;, downtown Montreal.

==Early life==
Choquette was born in Montreal, Quebec, and studied at the Notre-Dame-de-Grâce Academy and Collège Stanislas in Montreal, a Roman Catholic private school considered an elite institution in Quebec. He graduated from McGill University with a law degree in 1949, and was called to the Bar of Quebec in the same year. In 1951, he obtained a doctorate in economics from the Paris Law School in Paris, France. He also studied at the School of Business Administration at Columbia University in New York City.

He practised law in Montreal beginning in 1951 and was given the honorary title of Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1963.

==Career==
===Member of the National Assembly===
In the 1966 provincial election, he was elected to the provincial legislature of Quebec from the riding of Outremont in Montreal as a member of the Quebec Liberal Party. He was re-elected in the 1970 and 1973 elections.

===Cabinet member===
In the Liberal government of Robert Bourassa, he served as Minister of Financial Institutions from May to October 1970, Minister of Justice from May 1970 to July 1975, and Minister of Education from July to September 1975, when he resigned from the Liberal Party.

Choquette was the Minister of Justice during the October Crisis and one of the targets of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) terrorists who kidnapped and murdered Pierre Laporte, his fellow cabinet member and then-Deputy Premier. Seen as a decisive and strong Cabinet Minister, Choquette took the position during the Crisis that the government of Quebec could not give in to the FLQ demands without compromising its responsibility as the democratically elected government. Choquette openly carried a revolver during the crisis, he said, so that he could not be harassed. He also suggested that Bourassa name a minister of social peace.
In a memorandum of John Starnes dated of October 29, 1970, he writes : 
&quot;It appeared that the municipal authorities in Montreal had information which appeared to implicate the Quebec minister of Justice, Mr. Choquette, in the FLQ conspiracy.&quot;
Following the resolution of the Crisis and expiration of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;, Choquette brought in the services of the Quebec Ombudsman and provided the vehicle by which anyone unjustly treated had their case reviewed and given proper compensation. During the October Crisis, Choquette reportedly reluctantly supported the suspension of civil liberties under the War Measures Act.

Until he was removed from the portfolio, Choquette was deeply involved and interested in prosecuting Henry Morgentaler.

Choquette was the Cabinet Minister who helped create the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, introduced it into the National Assembly in 1975 and established Quebec&#x27;s legal aid system.

===Parti National Populaire===
In September 1975, Choquette resigned as Minister of Education over differences in language policy. He wanted stricter enforcement of the requirement that children whose parents were not educated in English be educated in French. He repeatedly refused the entreaties of Maurice Bellemare that he take over the leadership of the Union Nationale party.

On December 14, 1975, he founded the Parti National Populaire with Fabien Roy, a member of the National Assembly who had been expelled from the Ralliement créditiste du Québec. Choquette was confirmed as leader of the party at a party congress on October 24, 1976. He was defeated in Outremont in the November 1976 Quebec election.

Choquette resigned from the PNP on March 29, 1977, and rejoined the Liberal Party on January 16, 1978.

===Municipal politics===
Choquette restarted his law career in 1976. From 1983 to 1991, he served as mayor of the Montreal suburb of Outremont.

In 1993, he began a campaign for the leadership of the Civic Party of Montreal, a municipal political party in Montreal, but later withdrew from the race and founded the Parti des Montréalais (). As leader of that party, he was an unsuccessful candidate for mayor of Montreal in 1994.

<doc id="741460" wikidata="Q2403729" url="?curid=741460" title="Junius manuscript">
<text>The Junius manuscript is one of the four major codices of Old English literature. Written in the 10th century, it contains poetry dealing with Biblical subjects in Old English, the vernacular language of Anglo-Saxon England. Modern editors have determined that the manuscript is made of four poems, to which they have given the titles &quot;Genesis&quot;, &quot;Exodus&quot;, &quot;Daniel&quot;, and &quot;Christ and Satan&quot;. The identity of their author is unknown. For a long time, scholars believed them to be the work of Cædmon, accordingly calling the book the Cædmon manuscript. This theory has been discarded due to the significant differences between the poems.

The manuscript owes its current designation to the Anglo-Dutch scholar Franciscus Junius, who was the first to edit its contents and who bequeathed it to Oxford University. It is kept in the Bodleian Library under shelfmark MS Junius 11.

==Name and date==

The codex now referred to as the &quot;Junius manuscript&quot; was formerly called the &quot;Cædmon manuscript&quot; after an early theory that the poems it contains were the work of Cædmon; the theory is no longer considered credible, therefore the manuscript it is commonly referred to either by its Bodleian Library shelf mark &quot;MS Junius 11&quot;, or more casually as &quot;the Junius manuscript&quot; or &quot;Codex Junius&quot;. &#x27;Junius&#x27; in these is Franciscus Junius, who published the first edition of its contents in 1655.

It has been established on palaeographical grounds that compilation of the manuscript began c. AD 1000. Recent work has suggested an earlier, narrow window for the likely compilation date to 960–1000 for Liber I and shortly thereafter for Liber II, based on an integrated dating of the text, paleography, and illustrations.

The compilation was in two stages: Liber I contains the poems &quot;Genesis&quot;, &quot;Exodus&quot;, and &quot;Daniel&quot;, and was the work of a single scribe. Liber II contains the poem C&quot;hrist and Satan&quot;. The manuscript contains numerous illustrations that are an example of the Winchester style of drawing, typical of the period and region; it appears that two illustrators worked independently on the manuscript. The first scribe left spaces in the text for other illustrations which were never completed.

==Illustrations==
The manuscript is partly illustrated with a series of line drawings depicting the events in the text. From spaces left by the scribes, it appears that it was intended that the manuscript be fully illustrated; in the event, the work was left unfinished after only about a third of the artwork had been drawn. This scheme of illustrations, which is unparalleled in other manuscripts of Anglo-Saxon poetry, implies that the manuscript was conceived of as being considerably more important than most vernacular texts; it may have been intended for devotional or didactic use.

==Contents==
The names of the poems themselves are modern inventions; they are not given titles in the manuscript. As with the majority of Anglo-Saxon writing, the poems are anonymous and their provenance and dating are uncertain.

===Genesis===

&quot;Genesis&quot; is a paraphrase of the first part of the biblical book of Genesis, from the Creation through to the test of Abraham&#x27;s faith with the sacrifice of Isaac (Gen. 22).

The work is now recognised as a composite work formed of two originally distinct parts, conventionally referred to as &quot;Genesis A&quot; and &quot;Genesis B&quot;; the latter, lines 235–851 of the poem as we have it, appears to have been interpolated from an older poem to produce the current text.

It is &quot;Genesis B&quot; which has attracted the most critical attention. Its origin is notable in that it appears to be a translation from a ninth-century Old Saxon original; this theory was originally made on metrical grounds, in 1875 by the German scholar Sievers, and then confirmed by the discovery of a fragment of Old Saxon verse that appears to correspond to part of the work in 1894. Thematically and stylistically, it is distinctive: it tells the story of the falls of Satan and Man in an epic style, and has been suggested as an influence for &quot;Beowulf&quot;, and even, perhaps, for Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;.

===Exodus===
&quot;Exodus&quot; is a retelling of the story of the Israelites&#x27; Flight from Egypt and the Crossing of the Red Sea.

===Daniel===
A short paraphrase of the book of Daniel, dwelling particularly on the story of the Fiery Furnace, deals with the first five chapters of the Book of Daniel.

===Christ and Satan===
A three-part poem detailing the Fall of Satan, Christ&#x27;s harrowing of Hell (from the Apocryphal New Testament &quot;Gospel of Nicodemus&quot;), and Christ&#x27;s temptation in the desert.

<doc id="741463" wikidata="Q137980" url="?curid=741463" title="132 Aethra">
<text>132 Aethra is a metallic asteroid and Mars-crosser on an eccentric orbit from the asteroid belt. It measures approximately 40 kilometers in diameter.

It was discovered by James Craig Watson in 1873 and is the first such Mars-crosser asteroid to be identified. As a Mars-crosser asteroid, Aethra is the lowest numbered asteroid to not have proper orbital elements due to recurring perturbations by Mars. It has a rather eccentric orbit that sometimes brings it closer to the Sun than the planet Mars.

With an original observation arc of only 22 days, 132 Aethra was a lost asteroid between 1873 and 1922.

The varying light curve of the asteroid implies an elongated or irregular shape for its body.

It is named after Aethra, the mother of Theseus in Greek mythology.

<text>Terrence Ross Jacks (born March 29, 1944) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, guitarist and record producer known for his 1974 hit song &quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot;, an English adaptation of a song written by Belgian composer and singer Jacques Brel in 1961. Jacks is also an environmental activist, focused on pulp mill emissions in Howe Sound.

==Early life==

Terry Jacks was born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Jacks was the oldest of five boys and his father ran an architecture business in Winnipeg, a career Jacks later studied in university, before he become a musician. In the early 60s, when Jacks was a teenager, the family relocated to Vancouver. Jacks took up guitar and at 18 formed a band called The Chessmen with guitarist Guy Sobell. The group had four top-ten hits in Vancouver between 1964 and 1966.

Jacks and the Chessmen performed live on a Friday night in September 1965 for a &quot;Back to School&quot; event at the now-defunct T. Eaton Co. (Eaton&#x27;s) department store at its Brentwood Mall store in North Burnaby, a municipality next to Vancouver.

Pupils from Burnaby South Senior High School who followed music tuned in to CFUN 1410 AM, which advertised its &quot;Request Line&quot;. Being skeptical about whether CFUN really listened to requests, they began phoning the Request Line and asked for the B side of the current Chessmen hit. To their amazement, CFUN began playing it and turned the record into a two-sided hit.

Following The Chessmen, Terry and Susan Pesklevits (Susan Jacks), whom he later married, formed The Poppy Family along with Craig McCaw and Satwant Singh. They had several hits in Canada and internationally, their biggest being &quot;Which Way You Goin&#x27; Billy?&quot;, which went to #1 in Canada and #2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in the U.S. The song was written and produced by Terry Jacks, earning him a Gold Leaf (Juno) award in 1970 for his production. The Poppy Family performed at the Lethbridge, Alberta, Stampede in the summer of 1971.

==&quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot;==
The song &quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot; was originally intended for the Beach Boys, with Jacks serving as producer for the recording. However, after the group decided not to release it, Jacks decided to record it himself in late 1973 on his own record label, Goldfish Records. It became the largest-selling international single by a Canadian artist at that time, eventually selling 14 million copies worldwide. It earned Jacks two Juno Awards and became one of the biggest-selling Canadian singles of all time.

The song was based on Rod McKuen&#x27;s 1965 re-write of &quot;Le moribond&quot;, originally by Belgian singer Jacques Brel from 1962. For his version, Jacks made some modifications to the lyrics, which combined with McKuen&#x27;s changes resulted in a work that bears little resemblance to Brel&#x27;s original in tone, substance, and poetry. In Germany, the UK, and the United States, Jacks&#x27;s rewrite was released on Bell Records, and the song went to #1. In Canada, it was released on Jacks&#x27;s own label, Goldfish Records, and distributed by London Records Canada.

Jacks later released &quot;If You Go Away&quot; (another McKuen adaptation of a Jacques Brel song, titled &quot;Ne Me Quitte Pas&quot;), which reached #8 in the UK and #24 in Germany, and a cover of Kevin Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll (I Gave You the Best Years of My Life)&quot;, both of which had more success in Canada but also made the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the U.S. He wrote and recorded a number of other songs, and went on to produce for many artists, including &quot;Crazy Talk&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s Something I Like About That&quot; for Chilliwack, from their album &quot;Riding High&quot;.

Jacks produced two songs for Nana Mouskouri: &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; and &quot;Loving Arms&quot; in 1976. He produced the Vancouver top 10 hit &quot;Country Boy Named Willy&quot; for Spring on London Records (#38 Canada), and Valdy&#x27;s original version of &quot;Rock and Roll Song&quot; (b/w sometime &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;). The record was scheduled for release on London Records but was re-recorded in Los Angeles with another producer when Valdy signed a recording contract. He also spent a lot of time with Buddy Knox in the 1970s and produced a single for him with two songs: &quot;Me and You&quot; (written by Jacks) and the George Jones song &quot;White Lightnin&#x27;&quot;; the single remains unreleased. Jacks also went on to produce a number of other artists in the 1980s and 1990s, including DOA, who recorded a punk rock version of &quot;Where Evil Grows&quot;.

== 1980s ==
Jacks disliked the music business, particularly touring and promotional activities, and stopped recording in the mid-1970s, although he continued doing some music producing. Beginning in 1976, Jacks was impersonated by Timothy Wayne MacDonald for several years; the imposter gave concerts and appeared on talk shows and radio before turning himself in to Jacks.

Encouraged by friend and fellow musician Bob Buckley, Jacks decided to return to recording. His album &quot;Pulse&quot; and its single &quot;You Fooled Me&quot; were released in 1983 after his self-imposed break from the music business. Jacks later called &quot;Pulse&quot; a &quot;rehearsal/demo&quot;. He released the album &quot;Just Like That&quot; in 1987, while continuing to focus on his environmental work.

==2010s==
Jacks and Al Jardine composed &quot;Don&#x27;t Fight the Sea&quot;, which Jardine recorded in 2011 along with Beach Boys members Mike Love, Brian Wilson, Bruce Johnston, and the late Carl Wilson, who sang part of the lead vocal. A limited edition white vinyl 45 was made and sold to benefit Japanese tsunami victims.

In 2015, Jacks released “Starfish on the Beach”, a double CD compilation containing 40 of Jacks&#x27; favorite tracks from the last 40 years. The release features some of his recordings from the 1970s and 1980s. The package contains a 32-page booklet with photographs and Jacks&#x27; recollections of his musical career.

==Film==
Jacks has worked in documentary film and video, producing several shorts on environmental themes including &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot;, &quot;The Tragedy of Clearcutting&quot;, &quot;The Southern Chilcotin Mountains&quot; and &quot;The Warmth of Love (The Four Seasons of Sophie Thomas)&quot; with cinematographer Ian Hinkle. The video production &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot; earned an Environmental Gold Award from the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival.

In 1981, Jacks became involved with a project to make a TV movie version of &quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot;. He produced, scored, and starred in the movie.

== Environmental activism ==
In 1985, Jacks founded Environmental Watch to combat pulp mill pollution on Howe Sound. Jacks filed suit against the British Columbia Environment Ministry in 1988 for granting a pollution permit to Howe Sound Pulp and Paper. The lawsuit was dropped in 1990 after the company incurred 19 pollution charges by the ministry. In 1989, he organized and led a flotilla of boats past several pulp mills in Howe Sound to protest their pollution.

In the 1990s, Jacks engaged in a multi-year legal battle against pulp mill emissions and improper amendments to the mill&#x27;s permits.

Jacks was termed &quot;instrumental&quot; in the efforts to pass two federal laws that limited logging on the coast and constrained fish-canning by non-Canadian fishermen. His environmental work has earned him several awards including a lifetime achievement award in 1997 for his work, as well as the Eugene Rogers Environmental Award.

==Personal life==
Jacks and Susan divorced in 1973. In the late 1970s, Jacks married his manager, Margaret Zittier. The couple had one daughter together before their divorce in 2001. Jacks married his third wife, Diane Soza, in 2008.

<text>The Poppy Family was a Canadian psychedelic pop group based in Vancouver. They had a number of international hit records in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

== Career ==
Seventeen-year-old Susan Pesklevits met Terry Jacks in the mid-1960s when he appeared as a guest on the national teen TV show &quot;Music Hop&quot; where she was a regular performer. She later called Jacks to accompany her on rhythm guitar for one of her live appearances. Eventually, although she continued to do solo shows on television, with the addition of Craig McCaw on lead guitar, Susan decided that all her live performances would be as part of her newly formed trio. The name Poppy Family was chosen when Susan, Terry and Craig were searching for a new name and, in a dictionary, came across those two words, defined as &quot;varied species of flowering plant, etc.&quot;, and felt it applied to them. Susan and Terry were married in 1967 and Susan Pesklevits became Susan Jacks. Craig McCaw later introduced Satwant Singh on tabla drums from India and the Poppy Family&#x27;s unique sound was complete.

With Susan Jacks on lead vocals, harmony vocals and percussion, Terry Jacks on rhythm guitar and occasional vocals, Craig McCaw on guitar/sitar and Satwant Singh on tablas/drums and other percussion, the group recorded their first album, from which came their international hit &quot;Which Way You Goin&#x27; Billy?&quot; (No. 1 in Canada, No. 1 in Cashbox and No. 2 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100). The album also produced &quot;That&#x27;s Where I Went Wrong&quot; (No. 9 in Canada, No. 29 in the US). Both songs were Top 10 Adult Contemporary chart hits as well.

Their second and last album &quot;Poppy Seeds&quot; was recorded with studio musicians after Satwant and Craig both quit the band following their engagement at Expo &#x27;70 in Japan. Although the Poppy Family name continued to be used, Terry&#x27;s participation as a musician and singer was limited. &quot;Poppy Seeds&quot; contained their hits &quot;Where Evil Grows&quot; (No. 6 in Canada, No. 45 US), &quot;Good Friends?&quot; (No. 10 in Canada, &quot;Bubbling Under&quot; No. 105, and Adult Contemporary chart, US), &quot;Tryin&#x27;&quot; (No. 12 Country chart in Canada), &quot;I Was Wondering&quot; (No. 3 AC in Canada, US Top No. 100), &quot;No Good to Cry&quot; (No. 8 in Canada, US Top No. 100), and &quot;I&#x27;ll See You There&quot; (No. 1 AC chart in Canada). &quot;Where Evil Grows&quot; and &quot;Good Friends?&quot; both also hit the US AC chart. The Poppy Family&#x27;s first two Canadian releases were &quot;Beyond the Clouds&quot; (1968), &quot;What Can The Matter Be?&quot; (1969).

At their career peak, Susan and Terry appeared on Bobby Darin&#x27;s successful 1970 television variety special, &quot;The Darin Invasion&quot;, which was filmed in Canada. They also appeared on other variety shows including &quot;Rollin&#x27; on the River&quot; with Kenny Rogers and &quot;The George Kirby Special.&quot; During television appearances, Terry lip-synced the harmonies while Susan sang her own harmony vocals. When doing a song like &quot;Which Way You Goin&#x27; Billy?&quot; Terry&#x27;s lip syncing would give them a real &quot;group like&quot; presence. Susan enjoyed performing live, but Terry did not want to tour and their career ultimately suffered.

The &quot;Which Way You Goin&#x27; Billy?&quot; single earned the group two 1970 Gold Leaf (Juno) Awards as well as two Moffatt Awards in 1970. The Juno Award is Canada&#x27;s equivalent of the Grammy Award. The single version of &quot;Which Way You Goin&#x27; Billy&quot; went on to sell a total of more than 3½ million worldwide, and was awarded a million-selling Gold disc from the RIAA.

The Poppy Family name was dropped in 1972 and, although Terry had been releasing singles under his own name since 1970, together they recorded their solo albums, Susan&#x27;s &quot;I Thought of You Again&quot; and Terry&#x27;s &quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot;. Susan left the marriage in early 1973 before the albums were released.

&quot;Where Evil Grows&quot; is used in Season 2 Episode 4 of &quot;Killing Eve&quot;. 

&quot;Where Evil Grows&quot; is also used in the 2020 film &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; for a scene where the movie&#x27;s villain, Dr. Robotnik, played by Jim Carrey, dances to the song.

<text>133 Cyrene is a fairly large and very bright main-belt asteroid that was discovered by J. C. Watson on 16 August 1873 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and named after Cyrene, a nymph, daughter of king Hypseus and beloved of Apollo in Greek mythology. It is classified as an S-type asteroid based upon its spectrum. It is listed as a member of the Hecuba group of asteroids that orbit near the 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter.

In the Tholen classification system, it is categorized as a stony SR-type asteroid. Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Altimira Observatory in 1985 gave a light curve with a period of 12.707 ± 0.015 hours and a brightness variation of 0.22 in magnitude. This result matches previous measurements reported in 1984 and 2005.

<text>Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago is the seat of the Archdiocese of Chicago, one of the largest Catholic dioceses in the United States. The church serves as the episcopal seat of the current Archbishop of Chicago, Cardinal Blase J. Cupich.

Dedicated on November 21, 1875, Holy Name Cathedral replaced the Cathedral of Saint Mary and the Church of the Holy Name, which were destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. During renovations, a fire in 2009 caused major damage to the roof and interior of the church. The damage was repaired and the cathedral reopened later that year.

==History==

=== Great Chicago fire of 1871 ===
At the time of the founding of the Diocese of Chicago on September 30, 1843, Bishop William Quarter led his faithful from the Cathedral of Saint Mary at the southwest corner of Madison and Wabash Streets. A few years later in 1851, an immense brick church called the Church of the Holy Name was being constructed on State Street between Huron and Superior streets. Its cornerstone was set in 1852. In October 1871, however, both churches were destroyed as the Great Chicago Fire engulfed all of the city. Church of the Holy Name pastor John McMullen travelled the country to raise funds to rebuild the churches and to aid the homeless of Chicago. Meanwhile, Chicago&#x27;s Catholics were forced to worship in what was called the &quot;shanty cathedral&quot;, a boarded-up burnt house on Cass Street. They worshiped there for over four years.

=== Breaking ground for the new cathedral ===
In 1874, Brooklyn architect Patrick Charles Keely, who would later also design St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, was selected to draw plans for the new cathedral of Chicago. On July 19 of that year, the cornerstone was laid. On November 21 of the following year, Bishop Thomas Foley dedicated the church and christened it the Cathedral of the Holy Name. In 1880, the Diocese of Chicago was reorganized to become the Archdiocese of Chicago and Holy Name Cathedral became the church of primacy over several other dioceses in the Midwest United States.

=== Early renovations ===
In 1888, surveyors noticed that the cathedral was sagging on its Superior Street side. This prompted the archbishop to commence with the cathedral&#x27;s first renovation projects. By 1915, Holy Name Cathedral was balanced out and saved from sinking into the ground. It was also lengthened by to accommodate the growing Catholic population. That same year, James Edward Quigley, Archbishop of Chicago, died. The first major Mass of the newly rededicated cathedral was the late archbishop&#x27;s funeral.

=== Emergency repairs ===
Holy Name Cathedral underwent extensive emergency repairs from February 2008 through August 2008 due to a piece of the ornate wooden ceiling falling to the floor the night of February 10, 2008. Upon further inspection and more pieces falling—the cathedral was closed for emergency repairs. It reopened to the public for weekend Masses the weekend of August 30–31. It fully reopened on November 17, 2008.

It closed again after a major fire on February 4, 2009, which started in the attic where workers were finishing up emergency work that began in February 2008. The cause of the fire was determined to be a faulty ice melting system in the roof line of the church. The facility suffered extensive water damage. Fr. Matthew Compton, after going door to door through the rectory to help evacuate, then rescued the Blessed Sacrament with a fire department chaplain.
Firefighters entered the burning attic without their helmets and oxygen tanks. A fire in the attic of a building in the style of Holy Name Cathedral is usually declared a loss and just contained; the action of the firefighters that day saved The structure. The restoration work following the fire was performed by Daprato Rigali Studios. All Masses for the weekend were moved to the auditorium as they had been during 2008. The Archdiocese of Chicago floated a loan to Holy Name in order to finance the repairs. The cathedral reopened the weekend of August 1, 2009.

=== George Mundelein ===
In 1924, Archbishop George Mundelein was elevated by the pope to become a cardinal. When he returned from consistory at the Vatican, the new cardinal was greeted at Holy Name Cathedral with a celebratory procession of over 80,000 Catholics. Mundelein also managed to get Chicago named the host city for the 28th International Eucharistic Congress in 1926, with the opening mass being held at the cathedral.

When Cardinal Mundelein died unexpectedly in his sleep in October 1939, Chicago City Hall hastily paved State Street where the subway was being constructed to accommodate the great influx of mourners expected to make the pilgrimage. As Cardinal Mundelein lay in state in the nave of Holy Name Cathedral, over a million people paid their last respects.

=== Second Vatican Council ===
As soon as the Second Vatican Council was concluded in the 1960s, Holy Name Cathedral proceeded with a massive, controversial renovation project to alter the cathedral interior. From Easter 1968 to 1969, the cathedral was closed and Masses were held in various locations including a nearby school gymnasium. At this time all of the stained glass, oil paintings, and marble statuary was removed from the interior of the cathedral. The result was a relatively plain room, dominated by a six-ton granite altar and Resurrection crucifix. At midnight on Christmas Eve of 1969, Holy Name Cathedral was reopened.

=== Papal visit of 1979 ===
In October 1979, Pope John Paul II became the first Pontiff to visit Holy Name Cathedral, for a prayer service with Chicago&#x27;s bishops as well as a concert featuring the music of Luciano Pavarotti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, in the nave of the cathedral. The congregation also prayed the Our Father in Latin at the request of the Pope.

==Architecture and furnishings==
Holy Name Cathedral was built in the Gothic revival architectural style while at the same time integrating motifs symbolic of the message of the modern Church. The church building is long, wide and can seat 1,110 people. The ceiling is high and has a spire that reaches into the sky. Overall, the cathedral features motifs meant to instill an ambience of physically dwelling in the biblical tree of life.

===Bronze cathedral doors===
The first feature that greets worshipers are massive bronze doors designed by Albert J. Friscia that weigh each. The doors introduce the overall &quot;Tree of Life&quot; theme with intricate details that serve to make the doors look like overwhelming planks of wood. The doors possess a hydraulic system that allows them to be opened with the push of a finger. Beyond the doors is a vestibule encased in glass.

===Resurrection crucifix===
Once inside the church, the most striking feature is the suspended &quot;Resurrection Crucifix&quot; sculpted by the artist Ivo Demetz. Adorning the walls of the nave are the Stations of the Cross by artist Goffredo Verginelli depicting the Passion, Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ. The stations are cast in bronze and framed in red Rocco Alicante marble.

===Ambo of the Evangelists===
Various bronze sculptures are featured in other parts of the church. One of the largest pieces is the &quot;Ambo of the Evangelists&quot; by Eugenio de Courten. An &quot;ambo&quot;, in church liturgy, is the lectern from which readings of Holy Scripture are proclaimed. The bronze casting depicts the authors of the Gospels with their symbols: Matthew the angel representing the Gospel of the Church; Mark, the lion and inspiration for Peter&#x27;s teachings or catechesis; Luke, the ox, for his recounting of Christ&#x27;s infancy; John, the eagle, for the writer of the Spiritual Gospel, recounting the story of &quot;the Word made flesh.&quot;

===Ambo of the Epistle Writers===
Also by de Courten is the &quot;Ambo of the Evangelists&quot;, a bronze casting depicting the authors of the apostolic letters to the early Church communities: Peter, with keys to the Kingdom of God; Paul, who died by the sword; James, representing faith sustained by good works; and Jude, carrying a whip representing correction. This particular ambo is used by lectors and cantors during Sunday Masses and other special Church feasts and memorials.

===Cathedral altar===
Six tons of monolithic red-black Rosso Imperiale di Solberga granite forms the &quot;mensa&quot; or table top of the altar. The pedestal is encircled by a bronze bas-relief depicting Old Testament scenes of sacrificial offerings and preparation: Abel&#x27;s offering of the first sacrifice, the priest Melchizedek giving bread and wine, Abraham&#x27;s willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac, and the Prophet Elijah receiving bread and water from the Angel of the Lord for strength to continue on his journey. The consecrated altar contains relics, or actual artifacts from the bodies of Saint John the Apostle and Saint Timothy.

===Cathedra of the See of Chicago===
A &quot;cathedra&quot;, or bishop&#x27;s throne, is what makes the church a cathedral. It is from this chair that &quot;Sedes Chicagiensis&quot;, or See of Chicago, is presided over by the archbishop of Chicago. Unlike most Roman Catholic cathedra, the &quot;Cathedra of the See of Chicago&quot; is plain and simple. Its back contains three panels depicting the first Christian teachers: Christ in the center panel, Saint Peter to his right, and Saint Paul to his left.

===Sanctuary Panels of the Holy Name===
Above the &quot;cathedra&quot; are the &quot;Sanctuary Panels of the Holy Name&quot;, five bronze panels by Attilio Selva representing the Holy Name of Jesus from which the church gets its name. The first panel is of Simeon contemplating the &quot;Infant Savior&quot; whom Mary presents in the Temple. The second panel depicts the &quot;Mystery of the Trinity&quot; and an angel carrying the monogram of Christ to earth. The third panel is of the &quot;Risen Christ&quot; proclaimed as &quot;Lord&quot;. The fourth panel is of the &quot;Presentation of Jesus in the Temple&quot; showing Mary and Joseph presenting the child for circumcision and naming. The last panel is of the &quot;Priesthood of Jesus&quot;, with Christ adorned in vestments presenting the chalice to all people.

===Pipe organs===
The cathedral contains two fine pipe organs: a large 71-stop, 4-manual instrument in the &quot;west end gallery&quot; constructed by Flentrop Orgelbouw of Zaandam, Netherlands; and a smaller 19-stop, 2-manual instrument in the &quot;south chancel&quot; by Casavant Frères of Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada.

===Galeri of the Cardinals===
Holy Name Cathedral continues the tradition of raising the galero, a wide-brimmed tasseled hat, of a deceased cardinal over the &quot;cathedra&quot; from the highest point of the semicircular, domed cathedral apse. The galero is hung in Holy Name Cathedral where they remain until they are reduced to dust, symbolizing how all earthly glory is passing. Looking up above the cathedra are the galeri of Cardinals Mundelein, Stritch, Meyer, Cody, Bernardin, and George.

== Trivia ==
A cornerstone inscription still bears faint indications of bullet marks from the murder of North Side Gang member Hymie Weiss, who was killed in front of the church (at the edge of the street, roughly a foot or two south of where the cornerstone is) on October 11, 1926.

== 175th Anniversary ==
In 2024, the Cathedral celebrated its 175th Anniversary with two Special Liturgies (on Nov. 18 and 24th), and announced a year long celebration of the event. The Chicago City Council also declared November 18 of that Year to be Holy Name Cathedral Day.

<text>134 Sophrosyne is a large main-belt asteroid that was discovered by German astronomer Robert Luther on 27 September 1873, and was named after the concept of &quot;sophrosyne&quot;, Plato&#x27;s term for &#x27;moderation&#x27;. Classified as a C-type asteroid, it has an exceedingly dark surface and most probably a primitive carbonaceous composition.

An occultation of a star by 134 Sophrosyne was observed 24 November 1980, in the United States. Timing information from this event allowed a diameter estimate of 110 km to be derived. Photometric observations of the asteroid in 2015 produced a lightcurve indicating a rotation period of with a variation amplitude of in magnitude. This provided a good match to the only previous determination in 1989.

<text>Willie Simms (January 16, 1870 – February 26, 1927) was an American National Champion jockey in Thoroughbred racing and a U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee who won five of the races that would become the U.S. Triple Crown series.

An African American, Simms began racing in 1887 and was one of the most successful jockeys using the short-stirrup style (which gave the rider a crouching posture). En route to winning the United States riding title in 1893 and 1894, Simms won back-to-back Belmont Stakes. On August 17, 1894, Willie Simms won the first five races at Jerome Park Racetrack and finished second in the sixth and last race of the day. All five of Simms&#x27; winners were trained by Hardy Campbell Jr.
In 1895, the &quot;Boston Post&quot; reported Willie Simms was among the elite jockeys and was earning more than $10,500 a year. (US$315,548 in 2018) That year he raced in England, where he became the first American jockey to win with an American horse in that country.

Back in the United States, Simms won the 1896 Kentucky Derby in its first running at 1¼ miles on Ben Brush. He repeated as the Derby winner in 1898, aboard Plaudit. Before the advent of the term &quot;Triple Crown&quot; and the importance of the U.S. Triple Crown series, Simms went on to take the Preakness Stakes a few weeks later on a different horse, Sly Fox. He is the only African American jockey to win all three Triple Crown races.

During his 14-year career, Willie Simms rode some of the great Thoroughbred racehorses of the day such as two-time American Horse of the Year, Henry of Navarre.

Willie Simms finished his riding career with 1,125 wins and in 1977 was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame

His name was frequently misspelled as &quot;Sims&quot; by media of his era.

<text>Pebble Island is one of the Falkland Islands, situated north of West Falkland. It is possibly named after the peculiarly spherical pebbles found at its western tip.

==Description==
The island, the fifth largest in the Falklands archipelago, stretches for and about at its widest point, with a total area of . Its three high points are First Mountain , Middle Mountain and Marble Mountain , all of which lie in the western part of the island. The eastern part of the island has lakes and wetlands and is of high conservation value. The two halves are joined by an isthmus on which lies Pebble Island Settlement where the inhabitants live. The island has been a sheep farm since 1846; 6,000 Corriedale sheep are farmed, along with 125 head of beef and dairy cattle.

==Settlement==
Pebble Island Settlement (Spanish/Argentine name: &quot;Puerto Calderón&quot;)() is the headquarters of the Pebble Island farm, and is located on the island&#x27;s isthmus. There is a shop (open three days a week), a one classroom school, an airstrip, a hotel and a golf course.

==History==
The settlement&#x27;s Spanish name &quot;Puerto Calderón&quot; (meaning &quot;port of the cauldron [or vat]&quot;) reflects the area&#x27;s early history in sealing, and hunting penguins for oil.

The farm was established in 1846 by John Markham Dean (elsewhere, John Henry Dean), an Englishman who bought Pebble and three neighbouring islands for £400. Dean&#x27;s family concern passed on to Dean Brothers Ltd, but it is currently managed locally by Raymond Evans, the great nephew of Johnny Evans who introduced sheep to the island and slaughtered the first feral cattle.

During the Falklands War, the island was occupied by Argentine forces which created the &quot;Estación Aeronaval Calderón&quot; (naval air station Calderon), protected by elements of 2nd Naval Infantry Battalion, which was assaulted successfully by the British Special Air Service in the &quot;Raid on Pebble Island&quot;. Thirty to one-hundred and fifty Argentine soldiers were based here to protect the airfield.

HMS &quot;Coventry&quot; was sunk off the coast of Pebble Island. According to the inquiry into its loss, the ship sank north of Pebble Island in May 1982. The co-ordinates of the sinking are 51 03.6S, 59 42.2W and this is about from the nearest point on Pebble Island. There are memorials on the island to the British destroyer HMS &quot;Coventry&quot; and to an Argentinian Lear Jet, both destroyed during the conflict.

More recently, Pebble Island Settlement became one of the first in the Falkland Islands to use wind turbines to generate most of its electricity.

In October 2018, it was announced that Pebble Island was up for sale by Claire Harris, descendant of John Markham Dean. The new buyer would need to obtain a licence from the Falklands Government to ensure that the island is kept in line with the rest of the islands.

==Important bird area==
Pebble Island can be divided into a marshy east, known for its waterfowl and wading birds as well as a hilly west, known for its penguins. The Pebble Island group, including the much smaller White Island and some islets, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). Birds for which the site is of conservation significance include Falkland steamer ducks (100 breeding pairs), ruddy-headed geese (175 pairs), gentoo penguins (1700 pairs), southern rockhopper penguins (6800 pairs), macaroni penguins (10 pairs), southern giant petrels (20 pairs), sooty shearwaters (100 pairs), striated caracaras, white-bridled finches, blackish cinclodes and Cobb&#x27;s wrens. black-necked and Coscoroba swans breed on the main island.
