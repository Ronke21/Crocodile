<text>Silicon on sapphire (SOS) is a hetero-epitaxial process for metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing that consists of a thin layer (typically thinner than 0.6 μm) of silicon grown on a sapphire () wafer. SOS is part of the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) family of CMOS (complementary MOS) technologies.

Typically, high-purity artificially grown sapphire crystals are used. The silicon is usually deposited by the decomposition of silane gas () on heated sapphire substrates. The advantage of sapphire is that it is an excellent electrical insulator, preventing stray currents caused by radiation from spreading to nearby circuit elements. SOS faced early challenges in commercial manufacturing because of difficulties in fabricating the very small transistors used in modern high-density applications. This is because the SOS process results in the formation of dislocations, twinning and stacking faults from crystal lattice disparities between the sapphire and silicon. Additionally, there is some aluminum, a p-type dopant, contamination from the substrate in the silicon closest to the interface.

== History ==
In 1963, Harold M. Manasevit was the first to document epitaxial growth of silicon on sapphire while working at the Autonetics division of North American Aviation (now Boeing). In 1964, he published his findings with colleague William Simpson in the &quot;Journal of Applied Physics&quot;. In 1965, C.W. Mueller and P.H. Robinson fabricated a MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor) using the silicon-on-sapphire process at RCA Laboratories.

SOS was first used in aerospace and military applications because of its inherent resistance to radiation. More recently, patented advancements in SOS processing and design have been made by Peregrine Semiconductor, allowing SOS to be commercialized in high-volume for high-performance radio-frequency (RF) applications.

== Circuits and systems ==
The advantages of the SOS technology allow research groups to fabricate a variety of SOS circuits and systems that benefit from the technology and advance the state-of-the-art in:

* analog-to-digital converters (a nano-Watts prototype was produced by Yale e-Lab)
* monolithic digital isolation buffers
* SOS-CMOS image sensor arrays (one of the first standard CMOS image sensor arrays capable of transducing light simultaneously from both sides of the die was produced by Yale e-Lab)
* patch-clamp amplifiers
* energy harvesting devices
* three-dimensional (3D) integration with no galvanic connections
* charge pumps
* temperature sensors
* early microprocessors, such as the RCA 1802

== Applications ==
Silicon on sapphire pressure transducer, pressure transmitter and temperature sensor diaphragms have been manufactured using a patented process by Armen Sahagen since 1985. Outstanding performance in high temperature environments helped propel this technology forward. This SOS technology has been licensed throughout the world. ESI Technology Ltd. in the UK have developed a wide range of pressure transducers and pressure transmitters that benefit from the outstanding features of silicon on sapphire.

Peregrine Semiconductor has used SOS technology to develop RF integrated circuits (RFICs) including RF switches, digital step attenuators (DSAs), phase locked-loop (PLL) frequency synthesizers, prescalers, mixers/upconverters, and variable-gain amplifiers. These RFICs are designed for commercial RF applications such as mobile handsets and cellular infrastructure, broadband consumer and DTV, test and measurement, and industrial public safety, as well as rad-hard aerospace and defense markets.

Hewlett-Packard used SOS in some of their CPU designs, particularly in the HP 3000 line of computers.

Silicon on sapphire chips produced in the 1970s proved superior in performance to their all silicon counterparts, but this came at the cost of lower yields of just 9%.

== Substrate analysis: SOS structure ==
The application of epitaxial growth of silicon on sapphire substrates for fabricating MOS devices involves a silicon purification process that mitigates crystal defects which result from a mismatch between sapphire and silicon lattices. For example, Peregrine Semiconductor&#x27;s SP4T switch is formed on an SOS substrate where the final thickness of silicon is approximately 95 nm. Silicon is recessed in regions outside the polysilicon gate stack by poly oxidation and further recessed by the sidewall spacer formation process to a thickness of approximately 78 nm.

<doc id="747223" wikidata="Q385207" url="?curid=747223" title="Lev Schnirelmann">
<text>Lev Genrikhovich Schnirelmann (also Shnirelman, Shnirel&#x27;man; ; 2 January 1905 – 24 September 1938) was a Soviet mathematician who worked on number theory, topology and differential geometry.

==Work==
Schnirelmann sought to prove Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture. In 1930, using the Brun sieve, he proved that any natural number greater than 1 can be written as the sum of not more than &quot;C&quot; prime numbers, where &quot;C&quot; is an effectively computable constant.

His other fundamental work is joint with Lazar Lyusternik. Together, they developed the &quot;Lusternik–Schnirelmann category&quot;, as it is called now, based on the previous work by Henri Poincaré, George David Birkhoff, and Marston Morse. The theory gives a global invariant of spaces, and has led to advances in differential geometry and topology. They also proved the theorem of the three geodesics, that a Riemannian manifold topologically equivalent to a sphere has at least three simple closed geodesics.

==Biography==
Schnirelmann graduated from Moscow State University in 1925 and then worked at the Steklov Mathematical Institute from 1934 to 1938. His advisor was Nikolai Luzin.

Schnirelmann committed suicide in Moscow on 24 September 1938, for reasons that are not clear. According to Lev Pontryagin&#x27;s memoir from 1998, Schnirelmann gassed himself, due to depression brought on by feelings of inability to work at the same high level as earlier in his career. On the other hand, according to an interview Eugene Dynkin gave in 1988, Schnirelman took his own life after the NKVD tried to recruit him as an informer.

<doc id="747226" wikidata="Q11722691" url="?curid=747226" title="Mayor of Honolulu">
<text>The mayor of Honolulu is the chief executive officer of the City and County of Honolulu. An office established in 1900 and modified in 1907, the mayor of Honolulu is elected by universal suffrage of residents of Honolulu to no more than two four-year terms. The City and County of Honolulu&#x27;s elected officials include the mayor, the prosecuting attorney, and councilmembers representing nine districts.

The mayor of Honolulu has full control over appointment and removal of administrators, is invested with absolute control over department heads, wields veto power over the Honolulu City Council and has substantial control over the budget, totaling in excess of US$1 billion.

==Honolulu Hale and other offices==
The mayor of Honolulu conducts official business from Honolulu Hale, the historic city hall building of Honolulu constructed in 1928 in classical Spanish villa architectural styles. The building is located at the northeast corner of King and Punchbowl streets in the Hawaii Capital Historic District near downtown Honolulu. Other administrative officers under the mayor of Honolulu work from separate municipal buildings on the larger civic campus of which Honolulu Hale is a part.

==Domestic policy==
From the courtyard of Honolulu Hale, the mayor of Honolulu is mandated by the City and County charters to make an annual &quot;State of the City&quot; address. In this speech, the mayor of Honolulu outlines the administrative and legislative agenda for the year. It is also a summation of the budget to be implemented compared to the budget of the previous year.

The mayor of Honolulu also organizes the major public services managed by the mayor’s office. The mayor oversees dozens of departments, including: Honolulu Board of Water Supply, Honolulu Fire Department, Honolulu Police Department and the Oahu Civil Defense Agency. Unlike most United States mayors, the mayor of Honolulu does not oversee any schools, a jurisdiction of the Hawaii State Department of Education.

==Managing director==
Assisting the mayor of Honolulu in overseeing these departments and other domestic policy issues is the managing director of Honolulu. The managing director&#x27;s most important role is to serve as acting mayor in absence or resignation. The current managing director is Michael Formby.

==Foreign policy==
Many people, including Jeffre Juliano and Robert K. Wrede have considered Honolulu to be the &quot;Geneva of the Pacific&quot; due to its commercial and trade, political and military, as well as academic influences over Asia and the Pacific Rim. Honolulu is the site of several international governmental and non-governmental organizations and summits, as well as the site of high-profile multinational military exercises called RIMPAC. RIMPAC is conducted by the commander-in-chief of the United States Pacific Command whose headquarters is in Honolulu’s Salt Lake subdivision.

The uniqueness of Honolulu’s significance to the global community has forced the mayor of Honolulu to assume a constant diplomatic role that goes beyond the foreign policy roles of almost all other United States mayors. The mayor of Honolulu serves as concurrent chairman of several multinational mayoral bodies and convenes special sessions of international summits regularly.

==First Lady of Honolulu==
As a Hawaiian tradition, the wife of the mayor of Honolulu is honored with the ceremonial title of &quot;First Lady of Honolulu.&quot; Honolulu is distinct in this tradition as most United States cities and towns reserve the title of &quot;First Lady&quot; to the wife of the state governor, the wife of the president of the United States or the wife of a visiting foreign head of government. Honolulu deemed it necessary to bestow the ceremonial title to reflect her role in relation to her husband’s extensive international responsibilities. The title is not codified in modern law but is an honorific.

<doc id="747234" wikidata="Q1248820" url="?curid=747234" title="Petticoat Junction">
<text>Petticoat Junction is an American television sitcom that originally aired on CBS from September 1963 to April 1970. The series takes place at the Shady Rest Hotel, which is run by Kate Bradley; her three daughters Billie Jo, Bobbie Jo, and Betty Jo; and her uncle Joe Carson. The series is one of three interrelated shows about rural characters produced by Paul Henning. &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; was created upon the success of Henning&#x27;s previous rural/urban-themed sitcom &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1962–1971). The success of &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; led to a spin-off, &quot;Green Acres&quot; (1965–1971). &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; was produced by Filmways, Inc. and CBS Productions.

==Premise==
The show centers on the goings-on at the rural Shady Rest Hotel. Widowed Kate Bradley (Bea Benaderet) is the proprietress. Her lazy but lovable Uncle Joe Carson (Edgar Buchanan) supposedly helps her in the day-to-day running of the hotel, while she serves as a mediator in the various minor crises that befall her three beautiful daughters: redhead Betty Jo (Linda Kaye Henning); brunette Bobbie Jo (first Pat Woodell, later Lori Saunders); and blonde Billie Jo (first Jeannine Riley, then Gunilla Hutton, and finally Meredith MacRae). Uncle Joe, when he is not idling in his favorite porch chair, frequently comes up with half-baked get-rich-quick schemes and ill-conceived hotel promotions which end up with him making a fool of himself.

Early on, much of the show also focuses on the &quot;Hooterville Cannonball&quot;, an 1890s vintage steam-driven train run more like a taxi service by railroad engineer Charley Pratt (Smiley Burnette) and fireman/conductor Floyd Smoot (Rufe Davis). It was not uncommon for the &quot;Cannonball&quot; to make an unscheduled stop for the crew to go fishing, or to pick fruit for Kate&#x27;s apple butter and pies. The single-tracked Hooterville to Pixley spur line was cut off from the rest of the railroad 20 years before the start of the show by the demolition of a trestle. Charley and Floyd are alternately depicted as retired employees of the railroad receiving pensions and salaried railroad workers.

Many plots involve railroad executive Homer Bedloe&#x27;s futile attempts to cease operation and scrap the &quot;Hooterville Cannonball&quot;. Occasionally, youngest daughter Betty Jo can be found with her hand on the &quot;Cannonball&#x27;s&quot; throttle; running the train is one of her favorite pastimes, as she is something of a tomboy with an interest in mechanics.

Trips on the &quot;Cannonball&quot; usually include a stop in Hooterville at Drucker&#x27;s Store, run by Sam Drucker (Frank Cady). Drucker&#x27;s is the local hub, where menfolk come to play checkers and chat. Sam Drucker is the postmaster, editor of the newspaper, Justice of the Peace, county clerk, water commissioner, deputy sheriff and occasionally the mayor. His telephone is a lifeline for the Bradleys, Uncle Joe, and others. The fictional Hooterville became the main town for &quot;Green Acres&quot; in which Sam Drucker still ran Drucker&#x27;s Store. Pixley was apparently the county seat although a nearby community was &quot;Bugtussle,&quot; the original home of Jed Clampett and his family from &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.

==Setting==
The Shady Rest Hotel is located at a water stop along the isolated branch line of the C. &amp; F.W. Railroad. Due to a trestle demolition many years ago, the line now is entirely unconnected to any other railroad; it runs between the rural farm community of Hooterville and the small town of Pixley. Each of these towns is about away from the hotel, which is located roughly at the midpoint of the line. Kate Bradley says that her stubborn grandfather built the hotel there because that was where the lumber fell off the train. The town of Pixley, at one end of the &quot;Cannonball&#x27;s&quot; route, was named for Pixley, California. A number of location shots were filmed in the real Pixley. The exact location of Hooterville is never mentioned on &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; or &quot;Green Acres&quot;. Clues given to the location of Hooterville often conflict with each other, but nearby mentions of towns and counties place it in Southwest Missouri.

The Shady Rest is an old-fashioned, Victorian-style hotel, accessible primarily by train (and a poorly-maintained fire road), where guests share bathing facilities and eat together with the family at a large dining-room table. Kate Bradley cooks sumptuous meals on a wood-burning stove, and her specialty is chicken &#x27;n&#x27; dumplings. Meals were prepared for the show by property master Vince Vecchio. In a 1966 interview, Bea Benaderet said, &quot;I suspect that Vince is better at cooking things like [my] mother used to than anybody&#x27;s mother ever was.&quot;

Regarding the show&#x27;s title, &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, the hotel is located at a water stop, not a junction (where two or more railroad lines meet). The train stop is nicknamed &quot;petticoat junction&quot; because the Bradley sisters often skinny dip in the railway&#x27;s water tower and leave their petticoats draped over the side. The opening titles of the series show their petticoats hanging on the tower while they are swimming offscreen.

==Show history==
The idea for &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; came from Paul Henning&#x27;s wife, Ruth. Paul Henning said,

The Shady Rest was based on a real hotel in Eldon, Missouri, run by my wife&#x27;s grandmother... that&#x27;s where the hotel and the train and the whole setting came from, from Ruth&#x27;s reminiscences of visiting her grandma.

Ruth Henning told him stories of her childhood adventures at the Burris Hotel, which was owned by her grandparents in Eldon. Once called the Rock Island Hotel, the Burris was located next to the now-derelict Rock Island Line railroad tracks. Ruth Henning&#x27;s mother, Alice (Burris) Barth, also told her many stories about the hotel and about growing up in the small town of Eldon. The stories of Ruth and her mother, Alice, became the basis of the show.

Linda Kaye Henning said that her father &quot;wrote the series for Bea Benaderet.&quot; Paul Henning thought the show would make an ideal starring vehicle for the veteran character actress. Since the 1930s, Benaderet had played second-banana roles on radio and television to such personalities as Jack Benny, Lucille Ball, and George Burns and Gracie Allen. She was an uncredited voice actress for many Warner Bros. cartoons, and provided the voice of Betty Rubble on &quot;The Flintstones&quot;. She also played the semiregular character Cousin Pearl Bodine on season one of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. Henning felt that Benaderet had more than paid her dues and had earned the right to headline her own series.

During preproduction, proposed titles for the show were &quot;Ozark Widow&quot;, &quot;Dern Tootin&quot;&#x27;, and &quot;Whistle Stop&quot;.

===Tone and character changes===

For the first three seasons, &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; centered on homespun humor and the village&#x27;s backward mindset. Beginning in season four, however, the show gradually took on a different feel. Stories began to focus more on the Bradley sisters, specifically on the romance of Steve and Betty Jo, who became key characters. The show became more of a domestic comedy. Musical numbers and singing became prominent. Songs featured the Bradley sisters singing as a trio, Billie Jo solo, Steve solo, or Steve and Betty Jo as a duet. Sometimes, as many as two or three songs were in each episode.

The additions of Mike Minor as Steve Elliott and Meredith MacRae as the third Billie Jo influenced this change, as they were both accomplished singers. The characters of Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo also changed. Billie Jo went from being a boy-crazy dumb blonde to a strong, independent young lady. Bobbie Jo went from being book-smart (nicknamed &quot;the walking encyclopedia&quot;) to more of a bubble-head used for comic relief.

Kate Bradley&#x27;s appearance also changed. In the first two seasons, Kate&#x27;s wardrobe and hair style depicted her as a dowdy country farm woman. Beginning with the third year (in color), her clothing and coiffure were much more flattering and appealing, and she wore high heels.

===Death of Bea Benaderet===
Sickness kept Bea Benaderet away for the last third of season five as she dealt with lung cancer. She missed two episodes (#159 and 160), returned for one (#161), then missed eight more. Storylines dealt with Kate&#x27;s absence by having other characters say that she was out of town, although it was never stated where she was or what she was doing. Paul Henning brought in temporary replacement mother-figures Rosemary DeCamp (as Kate&#x27;s sister Helen) and Shirley Mitchell (as Kate&#x27;s cousin Mae). In January 1968, it was announced that Benaderet&#x27;s treatment was successful, and she returned for the fifth-season finale (&quot;Kate&#x27;s Homecoming&quot;) that aired on March 30, 1968. Benaderet&#x27;s performance showed the effects of her cancer treatment, as she appeared noticeably thinner and weaker. Following the conclusion of her treatment, she had revealed to the &quot;Press-Republican&quot; that despite her lengthy absence, series producer Charles Stewart would continue to write her as the lead for the upcoming sixth season.

At the start of the 1968–69 season, Benaderet had completed the first two episodes &quot;Birthplace of a Future President&quot; and &quot;The Singing Sweethearts&quot; when her cancer was found to have returned. The third episode, &quot;Only a Husband&quot;, was her final physical appearance on the show, in which she shared a brief scene with Mike Minor and was conspicuously absent from the other scenes that were written for her. Linda Kaye Henning recalled in 2008: &quot;The last few shows we knew she was very ill. … She was not well enough to do the episode where I have the baby.&quot; When Paul Henning realized that Benaderet would not recover, he decided that the fourth episode of season six would be the birth of Betty Jo&#x27;s baby, so Benaderet&#x27;s character could be included. In this episode, titled &quot;The Valley Has a Baby&quot;, Benaderet provided only her voice for scenes of Betty Jo and Steve reading a letter from Kate; her speaking to &quot;Cannonball&quot; engineer Wendell Gibbs over the phone and using the handcar with him to get to the hospital; and her presence at Betty Jo&#x27;s bedside after the baby&#x27;s arrival. The latter segments featured Benaderet&#x27;s stand-in, actress Edna Laird, portraying Kate with her back to the camera. The episode additionally featured three short flashbacks of Kate from season five: &quot;You Know I Can&#x27;t Hear You When the Thunder Is Clapping&quot;, where Betty Jo reveals to Kate that Steve and she are in love; &quot;A Cottage for Two&quot;, where Betty Jo&#x27;s dream house turns out to be an old shack; and &quot;With This Gown I Thee Wed&quot;, where Steve and Betty Jo get married. The episode aired just 13 days after Benaderet&#x27;s death on October 13, 1968.

Benaderet was popular with viewers, and her fan mail increased during her illness as she received many get-well cards and letters from fans. In the first five years of &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, she was indisputably the star of the show. As a result, the absence of her character had to be handled delicately. In the 1950s and &#x27;60s, it was almost unheard of for a main character on a television show to die, particularly on a situation comedy. The producers and CBS decided to continue the show, and Kate Bradley continued to be referred to as being &quot;out of town.&quot; Benaderet&#x27;s name was removed from the opening credits and Edgar Buchanan received star billing for the remainder of the series. Referring to the hotel, the opening theme lyrics were changed from &quot;It is run by Kate, come and be her guest&quot; to &quot;It is run by Joe, come and be his guest&quot;. Although &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; was still beloved by fans, the central premise of a country family was lost without a motherly figure. The long absence of Kate was only mentioned once in passing during the final two seasons. In the season-seven premiere &quot;Make Room For Baby&quot;, the Bradley sisters and baby Kathy Jo return from swimming in the water tower. Steve has paternal qualms about his daughter&#x27;s safety, to which Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo wistfully reply: &quot;Mom taught all of us to swim before we could walk. And in the same old water tower, too.&quot;

===Seasons six and seven===
Choosing not to recast the Kate Bradley role, or to sign Rosemary DeCamp on full-time (she was also playing the mother of Marlo Thomas on &quot;That Girl&quot;), the producers introduced the new character of Dr. Janet Craig, played by June Lockhart, who had just come from a three-year run as Maureen Robinson on &quot;Lost In Space&quot;. Previously, Lockhart had played another mother figure - Ruth Martin on the popular CBS-TV series &quot;Lassie&quot;. Lockhart&#x27;s character was essentially brought on as a surrogate mother figure to fill the void left by the death of Bea Benaderet, and takes up a medical practice at the hotel and also serves as a counsel of sorts for the girls. The cast was described as &quot;most welcoming&quot; to Lockhart as the newcomer during a difficult time. Quickly, Lockhart graduated from featured billing at the end of each episode to co-star billing in the opening credits. The show&#x27;s theme song lyrics were slightly altered to accommodate the change in cast.

A decline in Nielsen ratings had begun in season five, when CBS moved the show from Tuesday night to Saturday night. In season six, the show failed to make the ratings top 30. With Benaderet&#x27;s death and the mediocre ratings, the sitcom&#x27;s future was hanging in the balance. CBS considered canceling the show in the spring of 1969. The season-six finale &quot;Tune In Next Year&quot; was meant to be the series finale. Dr. Janet Craig receives a good job offer in another city and decides to accept it. However, at the end of the episode, Dr. Craig decides to stay when Steve and Betty Jo announce that they are going to have another baby.

At the last minute, CBS decided to renew the series for a seventh season. The main reason for the renewal was that it would give the series five full years of color episodes for syndication, which would be very profitable for the network. When the show returned for its seventh and final season in September 1969, two major plotline changes were made. The first is that Steve and Betty Jo, and their daughter Kathy Jo, move out of their cottage and back into the Shady Rest Hotel. The storyline involving Betty Jo&#x27;s new pregnancy was dropped and never referred to again. The second change is the addition of bumbling, but well-meaning, game warden Orrin Pike (played by actor Jonathan Daly), who becomes Bobbie Jo&#x27;s boyfriend, much to the annoyance of Uncle Joe. In the spring of 1970, despite somewhat improving ratings, &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; was canceled as a precursor to the CBS rural purge of the early 1970s, when all rural-themed shows were canceled. Its final first-run episode was broadcast on April 4, 1970, and the series officially ended its primetime run on Saturday, September 12, 1970, at 9:30 pm. It was replaced one week later by &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;.

&quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; did not have a series finale. However, &quot;Last Train to Pixley&quot;, the fourth-to-last episode to air, is in some ways like a series finale. In the episode, &quot;Hooterville Cannonball&quot; engineer/conductor Floyd Smoot decides to retire. The residents of the Shady Rest Hotel and Sam Drucker all take a ride on the &quot;Cannonball&quot; and recall (with flashbacks) such treasured memories as fishing from the train, a very pregnant Betty Jo driving the train when she is about to give birth, and the Christmas-time &quot;Cannonball&quot; decorated with lights. During the episode, Floyd sings the song &quot;Steam, Cinders and Smoke&quot;, which was written by former cast member Smiley Burnette. It was released as a single in 1964 by Burnette and Rufe Davis (who played Floyd Smoot). At the end of the episode, Floyd decides not to retire when the people of Hooterville write him letters asking him to stay.

===Cast notes===
The only actors who appeared in all seven seasons were Edgar Buchanan, Linda Kaye Henning, and Frank Cady. Buchanan was the only one to appear in every episode. Linda Kaye Henning appeared in all but two episodes: &quot;Bobbie Jo and the Beatnik&quot; (Season 1); and &quot;Have Library, Will Travel&quot; (Season 2). Edgar Buchanan, who portrayed Bea Benaderet&#x27;s character&#x27;s uncle, was only three years older than Benaderet in real life.
Veteran character actor Charles Lane played &quot;Cannonball&quot; nemesis Homer Bedloe in 24 episodes. Lane said that he perfected his stern curmudgeon character-type on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. Recalling in 1981 his many roles, he said &quot;They were all good parts, but they were jerks. If you have a type established, though, and you&#x27;re any good, it can mean considerable work for you.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Lane&#x27;s persona was so familiar to the public, &quot;that people would come up to him in the street and greet him, because they thought they knew him from their hometowns.&quot;

In the first-season episode #32 &quot;Dog Days At Shady Rest&quot;, Higgins, the actor dog, was featured as &quot;Sheba&quot;, the dog of Betty Jo&#x27;s boyfriend Orville Miggs (played by actor Jimmy Hawkins). That episode gave the producers an idea. It was decided at the start of the 1964–1965 season to add a new character to The Shady Rest - a dog. As a result, Higgins became a regular cast member. His first appearance was in the second season opener &quot;Betty Jo&#x27;s Dog&quot;. In that installment, coming home on the first day of school, Betty Jo meets a little male dog who immediately attaches himself to her and the Bradley family. Kate, at first, is against keeping him but by the end of the episode, she is won over by him and allows him to stay. Also, in that episode, the subject of Higgins&#x27;s name is addressed. At first, different names are suggested by the sisters when he first arrives (&quot;Spike&quot;, &quot;Prince&quot;, and &quot;Byron&quot;), but they never decide, so the dog at that time is not actually named. Eventually, the character&#x27;s name becomes simply &quot;Dog&quot; or &quot;Boy&quot;. Press releases for the show referred to him as the &quot;Shady Rest Dog&quot;. (The fifth-season episode &quot;Higgins, Come Home&quot; (broadcast January 27, 1968) refers to the dog&#x27;s real name, but the title itself is not displayed on the episode.) Higgins remained with the show until its cancellation in 1970. During that time, he won a PATSY Award, and he also was cover-featured on an issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot;. Higgins had a close rapport with Edgar Buchanan. In the official cast pictures taken each year during the run of Petticoat Junction, Buchanan is shown holding or petting the dog. Higgins went on to star in the successful 1974 film &quot;Benji&quot; which also featured Buchanan in a cameo role. Linda Kaye Henning indicated in a TV interview her father, the show&#x27;s producer, had planned to run a contest to name the dog but that never materialized and thus the dog was left without a &quot;proper&quot; name.

Another new character was introduced for the 1964–65 season to serve as a female nemesis for Kate Bradley - Selma Plout. Virginia Sale briefly reprised her role in the first season of &quot;Green Acres&quot; (her character is not mentioned by name, but is listed in the end credits). During the third season, Elvia Allman (who had appeared in season one as Gladys Stroud) was brought on as Cora Watson for one episode (a role she reprised on &quot;Green Acres&quot; the same season). Starting with Season 4 (1966–1967), Sale&#x27;s Selma was replaced by Allman. She appeared in 19 episodes in all, which extended to the end of season 7 (1969–1970). Selma&#x27;s daughter Henrietta Plout (first played by Susan Walther in season 3 then by Lynette Winter) was introduced at the same time and appeared in seven episodes over the next three seasons. Selma tries repeatedly to marry off the seemingly homely girl, the butt of many &quot;plain Jane&quot; jokes. In her next-to-last episode, the Bradley sisters give Henrietta a glamorous makeover and she is revealed to be quite attractive.

Mike Minor first appeared on the series as Selma Plout&#x27;s son Dan in the second-season episode &quot;Mother Of The Bride&quot; that aired December 15, 1964. After that episode, the character of Dan Plout is never seen again. Two years later, in the fall of 1966, Mike Minor rejoined the series as handsome crop duster Steve Elliott. Steve is originally the love interest of eldest daughter Billie Jo, but later marries (youngest daughter) Betty Jo.

The three Bradley sisters (played by Linda Kaye Henning, Pat Woodell, and Jeannine Riley) form a Beatlesque band called &quot;The Ladybugs&quot; with their friend Sally Ragsdale (Sheila James) in the season-one episode &quot;The Ladybugs&quot;. They wear mop-top wigs and perform the Beatles song &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; with the word &quot;Him&quot; substituted for &quot;Her&quot;. On March 22, 1964, mere days before this episode aired, the four actresses performed this same song as &quot;The Ladybugs&quot; on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Ed invited his viewers to tune in later that week to see the girls on their show.

Frank Cady, who played Sam Drucker, was the only actor in television history to play the same recurring character on three different shows at the same time. He was a regular on &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; and &quot;Green Acres&quot;, in addition to some late series guest appearances on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.

Benaderet had played Mrs. Granby on the short-lived 1950 radio show &quot;Granby&#x27;s Green Acres&quot;. This show was the inspiration for the &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; spin-off &quot;Green Acres&quot;. The Mrs. Granby character was altered on television and became Lisa Douglas, played by Eva Gabor. Jack Bannon, Benaderet&#x27;s son, played small parts over the course of the show, usually as a boyfriend or date for one of the Bradley girls. Byron Foulger played two different recurring characters on &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;. In the early seasons, he was banker Mr. Guerney, and in later seasons, he was train engineer Wendell Gibbs. Jimmy Hawkins appeared in five episodes as Betty Jo&#x27;s love interest Orville Miggs.

In season seven, Steve and Betty Jo&#x27;s baby Kathy Jo was played by Elna Danelle Hubbell. In season six, Kathy Jo was played (uncredited) by infant twins Heather and Barbara Whiter. Heather said her sister and she landed the role when their mother heard that the producers were looking for red-haired babies. She also said that she has no first-hand memories of working on the show.

===Cast changes===
Billie Jo was originally to be played by Sharon Tate. Though a cast photo was taken with Tate, she never appeared in the show. Though long rumored possible explanations for Tate&#x27;s replacement include the emergence of racy photos of Tate, the reality is that Martin Ransohoff, Filmways producer, felt she simply was not prepared for a central role, and her agents convinced her to pass up the opportunity. Billie Jo was played for the first two seasons (1963–65) by Jeannine Riley, who left to pursue a movie career. In the third season (1965–66), Riley was replaced by Gunilla Hutton (not present for 11 episodes), and for the rest of the show&#x27;s run, Billie Jo was played by Meredith MacRae.

Bobbie Jo was played in the first two seasons (1963–65) by Pat Woodell, who left the series to start a singing career. In some scenes in a few episodes, when Pat Woodell was unavailable, Bobbie Jo was shown only from behind, with a double standing in. For the remaining seasons, the character was played by Lori Saunders. Woodell and Saunders resembled each other physically, but the character of Bobbie Jo was gradually revamped after the cast change, going from a shy bookworm to a humorous scatterbrain. After Saunders took over the role, she at times gave her lines &quot;a slightly daffy delivery.&quot; The show writers picked up on this and gradually changed the character of Bobbie Jo from Paul Henning&#x27;s original conception of a brainy introvert into &quot;a high-spirited, delightfully ditzy extrovert.&quot;

In 1967, the show suffered its first loss when Smiley Burnette (engineer Charley Pratt) died of leukemia right after filming wrapped for the fourth season. During the show&#x27;s fifth season (1967–1968), Floyd Smoot (Rufe Davis) took over running the train alone as engineer and conductor. The absence of Burnette&#x27;s character of Charley was explained by allusions in several episodes to his death. Floyd was replaced the following season by Wendell Gibbs, played by Byron Foulger. During the show&#x27;s last season (1969–70), Foulger had become too ill to continue and did not appear. Davis guested as Floyd Smoot for two episodes, one of them being &quot;Last Train to Pixley&quot;. He was also addressed off-screen in one episode as an invisible character. Coincidentally, Foulger died on the same day that the final episode of &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; aired: April 4, 1970.

Bea Benaderet, who played the main character Kate Bradley, died in 1968 after a two-year illness with lung cancer; June Lockhart then joined the show as Dr. Janet Craig, a mother figure to the girls, from 1968 until the show&#x27;s end in 1970.

==Episodes==

==Reunions==
&quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; was the only one of Paul Henning&#x27;s country trio not to return in an updated reunion movie. In the 1970s, Meredith MacRae and Linda Kaye Henning tried to produce &quot;Hello Again Hooterville: A Thanksgiving Reunion&quot;, but the project never came to fruition. The game show &quot;Family Feud&quot; featured a &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; cast reunion in 1983, when Frank Cady, Linda Kaye Henning, Lori Saunders, Gunilla Hutton, and Meredith MacRae (Edgar Buchanan had died in 1979) competed against cast members from &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;.

In 1990, the character of Sam Drucker appeared in &quot;Return to Green Acres&quot;, in what was Frank Cady&#x27;s final acting role. In 1981, Linda Kaye Henning and Charles Lane both appeared in &quot;The Return of the Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, but not as Betty Jo and Homer Bedloe. Henning played a secretary named Linda, and Lane played Chief.

==&quot;Green Acres&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot; crossovers==
&quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; is set in the same fictional universe as &quot;Green Acres&quot;. Both shows are set in Hooterville, and they share such characters as Sam Drucker, Newt Kiley, and Floyd Smoot. A number of core &quot;Green Acres&quot; characters, such as Fred and Doris Ziffel (originally named &quot;Ruthie&quot; after Paul Henning&#x27;s wife, Ruth), Arnold the Pig, Newt Kiley, and Ben Miller, first appeared on season two of &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, which saw a number of scripts written by &quot;Green Acres&quot; creator Jay Sommers. Characters in all of Henning&#x27;s creations often crossed over into one another&#x27;s programs, especially during the first two seasons of &quot;Green Acres&quot;. 
During &quot;Petticoat&#x27;s&quot; run from 1963 to 1968 (up until Kate Bradley&#x27;s last few appearances at the beginning of season six), and with the exception of &quot;Green Acres&quot;, not once was there ever a connection to &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; even though Bea Benaderet had played Cousin Pearl Bodine during the latter&#x27;s first season (Benaderet reprised the role for a brief cameo in the sixth season). Despite this, in a 1968 episode of &quot;Petticoat&quot; (#175 &quot;Granny, the Baby Expert&quot;), Granny comes to Hooterville to tend to Betty Jo and Steve&#x27;s baby. Prior to her visit, she reminds Jed that he is related to Kate through Pearl and then later when she arrives at the Shady Rest she mistakes Uncle Joe for Kate and says &quot;They&#x27;s right about you Kate, you and Cousin Pearl are lookalikes.&quot; The episode is also part two of a three-episode crossover with &quot;Hillbillies&quot; that begins on &quot;Granny Goes to Hooterville&quot; and concludes on &quot;The Italian Cook&quot;.

Other crossover shows feature the Clampetts spending Thanksgiving and Christmas of 1968 in Hooterville on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (&quot;The Thanksgiving Story&quot;, &quot;The Week Before Christmas&quot;, &quot;Christmas in Hooterville&quot;, and &quot;Drysdale and Friend&quot;). Finally, two consecutive 1970 episodes of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (&quot;Buzz Bodine, Boy General&quot; and &quot;The Clampett-Hewes Empire&quot;) with a visiting Miss Jane and Mr. Drysdale, who mistakenly believes billionaire Howard Hughes lives in Hooterville.

The DVD release of the series by Brentwood Home Video replaced Massey&#x27;s music with John Hickman&#x27;s &quot;Banjo Signal&quot;. The DVD release of the series by TGG Direct, Inc. replaces Massey&#x27;s music with Frank Hutchison&#x27;s &quot;Train That Carried the Girl From Town&quot;. Both editions retain screen credit to Massey.

==Syndication==
After its cancellation, Filmways and Paul Henning&#x27;s company sold the show along with &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; after that show&#x27;s cancellation to CBS. Its distribution has changed hands over the years due to corporate changes involving Viacom, which in 2006 split into two separate companies. Today, CBS Media Ventures handles syndication.

The color (1965–70) episodes were shown in syndication for many years after the show&#x27;s cancellation. However, the rights to the black-and-white (1963–65) episodes were not resolved, and they were not included in the syndication package until MeTV began broadcasting the black-and-white (1963–65) episodes on July 12, 2011. The airings of the black-and-white episodes were short lived, and on July 21, 2011, MeTV started airing the color episodes once again. MeTV began to air the first two black-and-white seasons of the show again on November 4, 2013. The show has rotated on and off of the MeTV schedule in various time slots. On March 12, 2018, Decades TV Network and on April 23, 2018, Punch TV Studios began broadcasting the black-and-white episodes; both networks continued through with the color episodes.

The color episodes have run constantly, with the show running on TV Land from 1996 to 2000. The show ran on the Retro Television Network from 2005 to 2008, and on MeTV beginning in June 2012. The program has run on three different Canadian cable channels: Prime TV from 2000 to 2002, DejaView from 2005 to 2008, and on TV Land Canada from 2006 to 2010. The black-and-white episodes from season one are now in the public domain, their copyrights having lapsed. As a result, numerous discount DVDs of these episodes have been released, although with generic bluegrass-like theme music instead of the familiar opening and closing music, which is still under copyright.

As of April 2019, the original black-and-white episodes of &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; were airing on the Retro Television Network and Circle TV.

==Home video==
The Paul Henning Estate holds the original film elements to the first two seasons&#x27; black-and-white episodes, with the original opening and closing theme song. In 2005, it licensed 20 black-and-white episodes from season one to be released on the &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot; DVD set via MPI Home Video. It features the first 20 episodes of the series excluding &quot;Cannonball Christmas&quot;.

In 2008, CBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment) released the unaltered first season on DVD with new cast member interviews, original broadcast commercials.

The second season was released in 2009, concluding the show&#x27;s black-and-white episodes (it switched to color from the third season onward). The DVD also contained episode introductions and an interview with two cast members.

&quot;&quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; and &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;: Ultimate Christmas Collection&quot; DVD was released in 2005, with three themed episodes including &quot;Cannonball Christmas&quot; and new extras.

In 2013, the &quot;Return to Hooterville&quot; DVD was released to commemorate the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary. It contains one episode, &quot;A Cannonball Christmas&quot;, and over three hours of behind-the-scenes documentaries, interviews, archival footage, outtakes and more.

On October 1, 2013, the third season was released on DVD as a Walmart exclusive. It received a full retail release on April 15, 2014. This is the only release to date to include English SDH subtitles.

In 2019, the &quot;Seasons 1-3&quot; DVD set was released in the US; it was released in Australia in 2017 but from Shock Entertainment and coded for region 4.

, the show&#x27;s last four seasons have yet to be released on DVD.

==&quot;Hooterville Cannonball&quot;==
Motion shots of the &quot;Hooterville Cannonball&quot; were filmed on the Sierra Railroad, based in Jamestown, California. The steam locomotive used was the 4-6-0 (ten-wheeler) Sierra No. 3, which has the distinction of appearing in more movies than any other locomotive. Its first sound film appearance was in 1929 with Gary Cooper in &quot;The Virginian&quot;, and it has since appeared in many other Westerns, including a prominent role in the climactic ending of &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot;. It was also used in such television shows as &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; and &quot;The Iron Horse&quot;, as well as the TV series and movie &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;. Today, the Sierra No. 3 locomotive is still operational and located at Railtown 1897 State Historic Park.

A full-sized locomotive replica was used for studio scenes in and around the locomotive cab. The prop locomotive was provided by the Hoyt Hotel in Portland, Oregon. It was displayed in the lobby of the hotel as part of the décor of its Barbary Coast Lounge, hence the screen credit at the end of each episode &quot;Train furnished by Barbary Coast, Hoyt Hotel, Portland, Oregon&quot;. The replica still exists, although it has been restored to its pre-&quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; appearance as a locomotive called the Emma Sweeny, and is on public display under shelter in Santa Rita Park in Durango, Colorado.

==Real-world entertainment==
===Petticoat Junction Amusement Park===
There was an amusement park in Panama City Beach, Florida, named &quot;Petticoat Junction Amusement Park&quot;, which opened in 1963 (the same year that the show first aired) and closed in 1984, 14 years after the show ended. According to author Tim Hollis, the park&#x27;s owners (the Churchwell family), were friends with Edgar Buchanan. He talked to Paul Henning, who okayed the park being named after the show. As would be expected, there was a steam railroad attraction at the park, the narrow gauge Petticoat Junction Railroad. Although the park is closed, the locomotives and train cars from its railroad attraction survived. They were bought at auction by the late Fred H. Hallmark in 1985 and are kept and preserved on his family&#x27;s property at 9485 US-31 in Kimberly, Alabama.

===Petticoat Junction Cafeteria and Shady Rest Hotel===
In 1965, Claudia and J.T. &quot;Peavine&quot; Westmoreland bought an old train depot in Mabank, Texas, and converted it into a restaurant. Since the restaurant was next to a working railroad line, the customers nicknamed it &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, and the name was made official. Specialties at the Petticoat Junction Cafeteria included chicken fried steak and homemade coconut cream pies. The real-life Petticoat Junction was like the fictional show. In her memoirs, Claudia writes: &quot;The train crew grew to be a part of the Petticoat Junction. They would stop and eat with us and we looked forward to the once a day run.&quot; In 1966, the Southern Pacific Railroad sent work crews to elevate the railroad track. Claudia set up makeshift bedrooms for the workers and called it the &quot;Shady Rest Hotel&quot;. More permanent lodgings were soon added. Claudia&#x27;s daughter Ann recalled: &quot;Mother got people from the television show to send her photos of the Petticoat Junction set, the actors, just all kinds of things.&quot; The business was relocated one mile west in the 1970s and an RV park was added. The Petticoat Junction Cafeteria and Shady Rest Hotel lasted until 1996.

===Other &quot;Shady Rest&quot; Locations===
In the town of Woodstock, New York, is a hamlet called Shady; a rooming house operating there since 1968 is called &quot;The Shady Rest Townhouse&quot;, as an homage to the hotel in &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;.

<text>Body odor or body odour (BO) is present in all animals and its intensity can be influenced by many factors (behavioral patterns, survival strategies). Body odor has a strong genetic basis, but can also be strongly influenced by various factors, such as sex, diet, health, and medication. The body odor of human males plays an important role in human sexual attraction, as a powerful indicator of MHC/HLA heterozygosity. Significant evidence suggests that women are attracted to men whose body odor is different from theirs, indicating that they have immune genes that are different from their own, which may produce healthier offspring.

==Causes==

In humans, the formation of body odors is caused by factors such as diet, sex, health, and medication, but the major contribution comes from bacterial activity on skin gland secretions. Humans have three types of sweat glands: eccrine sweat glands, apocrine sweat glands and sebaceous glands. Eccrine sweat glands are present from birth, while the latter two become activated during puberty. Among the different types of human skin glands, body odor is primarily the result of the apocrine sweat glands, which secrete the majority of chemical compounds that the skin flora metabolize into odorant substances. This happens mostly in the axillary (armpit) region, although the gland can also be found in the areola, anogenital region, and around the navel. In humans, the armpit regions seem more important than the genital region for body odor, which may be related to human bipedalism. The genital and armpit regions also contain springy hairs which help diffuse body odors.

The main components of human axillary odor are unsaturated or hydroxylated branched fatty acids with E-3-methylhex-2-enoic acid (E-3M2H) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid (HMHA), sulfanylalkanols and particularly 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (3M3SH), and the odoriferous steroids androstenone (5α-androst-16-en-3-one) and androstenol (5α-androst-16-en-3α-ol). E-3M2H is bound and carried by two apocrine secretion odor-binding proteins, ASOB1 and ASOB2, to the skin surface.

Body odor is influenced by the actions of the skin flora, including members of &quot;Corynebacterium&quot;, which manufacture enzymes called lipases that break down the lipids in sweat to create smaller molecules like butyric acid. Greater bacteria populations of &quot;Corynebacterium jeikeium&quot; are found more in the armpits of men, whereas greater population numbers of &quot;Staphylococcus haemolyticus&quot; are found in the armpits of women. This causes male armpits to give off a rancid/cheese-like smell, whereas female armpits give off a more fruity/onion-like smell. &quot;Staphylococcus hominis&quot; is also known for producing thioalcohol compounds that contribute to odors. These smaller molecules smell, and give body odor its characteristic aroma. Propionic acid (propanoic acid) is present in many sweat samples. This acid is a breakdown product of some amino acids by propionibacteria, which thrive in the ducts of adolescent and adult sebaceous glands. Because propionic acid is chemically similar to acetic acid, with similar characteristics including odor, body odors may be identified as having a pungent, cheesy and vinegar-like smell although certain people might find it pleasant at lower concentrations. Isovaleric acid (3-methyl butanoic acid) is the other source of body odor as a result of actions of the bacteria &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot;, which is also present in several types of strong cheese.

Factors such as food, drink, gut microbiome, and genetics can affect body odor.

== Function ==
===Animals===
In many animals, body odor plays an important survival function. Strong body odor can be a warning signal for predators to stay away (such as porcupine stink), or it can also be a signal that the prey animal is unpalatable. For example, some animal species that feign death to survive (like opossums), in this state produce a strong body odor to deceive a predator that the prey animal has been dead for a long time and is already in the advanced stage of decomposing. Some animals with strong body odor are rarely attacked by most predators, although they can still be killed and eaten by birds of prey, which are tolerant of carrion odors.

Body odor is an important feature of animal physiology. It plays a different role in different animal species. For example, in some predator species that hunt by stalking (such as big and small cats), the absence of body odor is important, and they spend plenty of time and energy to keep their body free of odor. For other predators, such as those that hunt by visually locating prey and running for long distances after it (such as dogs and wolves), the absence of body odor is not critical. In most animals, body odor intensifies in moments of stress and danger.

====Humans====
In humans, body odor serves as a means of chemosensory signal communication between members of the species. These signals are called pheromones and they can be transmitted through a variety of mediums. The most common way that human pheromones are transmitted is through bodily fluids. Human pheromones are contained in sweat, semen, vaginal secretions, breast milk, and urine. The signals carried in these fluids serve a range of functions from reproductive signaling to infant socialization. Each person produces a unique spread of pheromones that can be identified by others. This differentiation allows the formation of sexual attraction and kinship ties to occur.

Sebaceous and apocrine glands become active at puberty. This, as well as many apocrine glands being close to the sex organs, points to a role related to mating. Sebaceous glands line the human skin while apocrine glands are located around body hairs. Compared to other primates, humans have extensive axillary hair and have many odor producing sources, in particular many apocrine glands. In humans, the apocrine glands have the ability to secrete pheromones. These steroid compounds are produced within the peroxisomes of the apocrine glands by enzymes such as mevalonate kinases.

==== Sexual selection ====
Pheromones are a factor seen in the mating selection and reproduction in humans. In women, the sense of olfaction is strongest around the time of ovulation, significantly stronger than during other phases of the menstrual cycle and also stronger than the sense in males. Pheromones can be used to deliver information about the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The MHC in humans is referred to as the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA). Each type has a unique scent profile that can be utilized during the mating selection process. When selecting mates, women tend to be attracted to those that have different HLA-types than their own. This is thought to increase the strength of the family unit and increase the chances of survival for potential offspring.

Studies have suggested that people might be using odor cues associated with the immune system to select mates. Using a brain-imaging technique, Swedish researchers have shown that homosexual and heterosexual males&#x27; brains respond in different ways to two odors that may be involved in sexual arousal, and that homosexual men respond in the same way as heterosexual women, though it could not be determined whether this was cause or effect. When the study was expanded to include lesbian women, the results were consistent with previous findings – meaning that lesbian women were not as responsive to male-identified odors, while responding to female odors in a similar way as heterosexual males. According to the researchers, this research suggests a possible role for human pheromones in the biological basis of sexual orientation.

==== Kinship communication ====
Humans can olfactorily detect blood-related kin. Mothers can identify by body odor their biological children, but not their stepchildren. Preadolescent children can olfactorily detect their full siblings, but not half-siblings or step-siblings, and this might explain incest avoidance and the Westermarck effect. Babies can recognize their mothers by smell while mothers, fathers, and other relatives can identify a baby by smell. This connection between genetically similar family members is due to the habituation of familial pheromones. In the case of babies and mothers, this chemosensory information is primarily contained within breastmilk and the mother&#x27;s sweat. When compared to that of strangers, babies are observed to have stronger neural connections with their mothers. This strengthened neurological connection allows for the biological development and socialization of the infant by their mother. Using these connections, the mother transmits olfactory signals to the infant which are then perceived and integrated.

In terms of biological functioning, olfactory signaling allows for functional breastfeeding to occur. In cases of effective latching, breastfed infants are able to locate their mother&#x27;s nipples for feeding using the sensory information enclosed in their mother&#x27;s body odor. While no specific human breast pheromones have been identified, studies compare the communication to that of the rabbit mammary pheromone 2MB2. The perception and integration of these signals is an evolutionary response that allows newborns to locate their source of nutrition. Signaling contains a level of precision that allows babies to differentiate their mother&#x27;s breasts from that of other women. Once the baby recognizes the familiar olfactory signal, the behavioral response of latching follows. Over time the infant becomes habituated to their mother&#x27;s breast pheromones which increases latch efficiency.

Beyond a biological function, a mother&#x27;s body odor plays a role in developing a baby&#x27;s social capabilities. The ability of an infant to evaluate the properties of human faces stems from the olfactory cues given from their mother. Frequent exposure to the pheromones exuded by their mother allows the connection between vision and smell to form in infants. This type of connection is only found between mothers and babies and over time it socializes the ability to recognize the features that distinguish human faces from inanimate objects.

==== Environmental threats ====
The connection between olfactory and visual cues has also been observed outside of familial relationships. Evolutionarily, body odor has been used to communicate messages about potentially dangerous stimuli in the environment. Body odor produced during particularly stressful situations can produce a cascade of reactions in the brain. Once the olfactory system is activated by a threatening stimuli, heightened activity in the amygdala and occipital cortex is triggered. This chain reaction serves to help assess the nature of the threat and increase chance of survival.

Humans have few olfactory receptor cells compared to dogs and few functional olfactory receptor genes compared to rats. This is in part due to a reduction of the size of the snout in order to achieve depth perception as well as other changes related to bipedalism. However, it has been argued that humans may have larger brain areas associated with olfactory perception compared to other species.

==Genes affecting body odor==

=== MHC ===
Body odor is influenced by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. These are genetically determined and play an important role in immunity of the organism. The vomeronasal organ contains cells sensitive to MHC molecules in a genotype-specific way.

Experiments on animals and volunteers have shown that potential sexual partners tend to be perceived more attractive if their MHC composition is substantially different. Married couples are more different regarding MHC genes than would be expected by chance. This behavior pattern promotes variability of the immune system of individuals in the population, thus making the population more robust against new diseases. Another reason may be to prevent inbreeding.

=== ABCC11 ===
The ABCC11 gene determines axillary body odor and the type of earwax. The loss of a functional ABCC11 gene is caused by a 538G&gt;A single-nucleotide polymorphism, resulting in a loss of body odor in people who are specifically homozygous for it. Firstly, it affects apocrine sweat glands by reducing secretion of odorous molecules and its precursors. The lack of ABCC11 function results in a decrease of the odorant compounds 3M2H, HMHA, and 3M3SH via a strongly reduced secretion of the precursor amino-acid conjugates 3M2H–Gln, HMHA–Gln, and Cys–Gly–(S) 3M3SH; and a decrease of the odoriferous steroids androstenone and androstenol, possibly due to the reduced secretion of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), possibly bacterial substrates for odoriferous steroids; research has found no difference, however, in testosterone secretion in apocrine sweat between ABCC11 mutants and non-mutants. Secondly, it is also associated with a strongly reduced/atrophic size of apocrine sweat glands and a decreased protein (such as ASOB2) concentration in axillary sweat.

The non-functional ABCC11 allele is predominant among East Asians (80–95%), but very low among European and African populations (0–3%). Most of the world&#x27;s population has the gene that codes for the wet-type earwax and average body odor; however, East Asians are more likely to inherit the allele associated with the dry-type earwax and a reduction in body odor. The reduction in body odor may be due to adaptation to colder climates by their ancient Northeast Asian ancestors.

However, research has observed that this allele is not solely responsible for ethnic differences in scent. A 2016 study analyzed differences across ethnicities in volatile organic compounds (VOCs), across racial groups and found that while they largely did not differ significantly qualitatively, they did differ quantitatively. Of the observed differences, they were found to vary with ethnic origin, but not entirely with ABCC11 genotype.

One large study failed to find any significant differences across ethnicity in residual compounds on the skin, including those located in sweat. If there were observed ethnic variants in skin odor, one would find sources to be much more likely in diet, hygiene, microbiome, and other environmental factors.

Research has indicated a strong association between people with axillary osmidrosis and the ABCC11-genotypes GG or GA at the SNP site (rs17822931) in comparison to the genotype AA.

Age-Related Differences

As seen in non-human animals such as mice, black-tailed deer, rabbits, otters, and owl monkeys, body odor contains age-related signals that these animals can detect and process. Similarly, humans have been seen to distinguish age-related information from body odor, particularly relating to odors of those of old age. In a study determining if there is a difference between the body odor of individuals of various ages, three groups were studied: those aged 20-30, aged 45-55, and aged 75-95, corresponding to young age, middle-aged, and old age, respectively. This study determined that individuals could distinguish between odors of various ages and group odors of old age, suggesting that there are certain chemical differences in age resulting in “age-dependent odor characteristics”.

Another study evaluated the components of body odor in participants aged 26 through 75 using headspace gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. This study demonstrated that in individuals 40 years or older, 2-Nonenal, an unsaturated aldehyde producing a greasy and grassy odor, was detected in increasing concentrations of those individuals. The detection of increasing amounts of 2-Nonenal in individuals 40 years or older suggested that 2-Nonenal contributes to the deteriorating body odor seen with aging.

Body Odor and Disease

In mammals, body odor can also be used as a symptom of disease. One&#x27;s body odor is completely unique to themselves, similar to a fingerprint, and can change due to sexual life, genetics, age and diet. Body odor, however, can be used as an indication for disease. For example, typically, human urine contains 95% water, however, for a person with an abnormal amount of blood sugar, their urine becomes more concentrated with glucose. Therefore, if a person&#x27;s body odor or urine smells unusually fruity or sweet, that can be a sign of diabetes. Additionally, an ammonia smell that occurs in one&#x27;s body, urine, or breath could also be an indicator of kidney disease. Typically, the liver converts ammonia to urea because ammonia has a high level of toxicity. The kidneys are responsible for removing waste, such as urea, out from the body. However, if the kidneys are not functioning properly, this urea is kept as ammonia, causing the urine and even one&#x27;s breath to smell like ammonia. In conclusion, body odor could be used as a helpful indicator of disease, especially when it suddenly deviates from normal.



==Alterations==
Body odor may be reduced or prevented or even aggravated by using deodorants, antiperspirants, disinfectants, underarm liners, triclosan, special soaps or foams with antiseptic plant extracts such as ribwort and liquorice, chlorophyllin ointments and sprays topically, and chlorophyllin supplements internally. Although body odor is commonly associated with hygiene practices, its presentation can be affected by changes in diet as well as the other factors. Skin spectrophotometry analysis found that males who consumed more fruits and vegetables were significantly associated with more pleasant smelling sweat, which was described as &quot;floral, fruity, sweet and medicinal qualities&quot;.

===Industry===
As many as 90% of Americans and 92% of teenagers use antiperspirants or deodorants. In 2014, the global market for deodorants was estimated at US$13 billion with a compound annual growth rate of 5.62% between 2015 and 2020.

==Medical conditions==
Osmidrosis or bromhidrosis is defined by a foul odor due to a water-rich environment that supports bacteria, which is caused by an abnormal increase in perspiration (hyperhidrosis). This can be particularly strong when it happens in the axillary region (underarms). In this case, the condition may be referred to as axillary osmidrosis. The condition can also be known medically as apocrine bromhidrosis, ozochrotia, fetid sweat, body smell, or malodorous sweating.

===Treatment===
If body odor is affecting a person’s quality of life, then seeing a primary care physician may be helpful. A doctor could recommend prescription antiperspirants containing aluminum-chloride. This chemical agent helps temporarily block sweat pores which reduces the amount a person will sweat. Deodorant is another remedy for body odor. It specifically targets odor but will not reduce sweat. Deodorants are usually alcohol-based which fights off bacteria. Most deodorants contain perfumes which also help with masking odor. If someone is experiencing severe body odor, a doctor may recommend a surgical procedure called endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy. This surgery will cut nerves that control sweating. This surgery poses the risk of harming other nerves in the body. 

===Prevention===

There are a number of ways to prevent body odor. These suggestions may help with those suffering from body odor. Bathing daily with antibacterial soap helps reduce the amount of bacteria found on the skin. This is especially important after doing any type of physical activity. Shaving armpit hair allows for sweat to evaporate more quickly so it won’t produce an odor. Applying deodorant or antiperspirant after showering which helps kill bacteria and prevent someone from sweating is helpful. Wearing fresh and clean clothes is also very important especially if you sweat a lot. 

Trimethylaminuria (TMAU), also known as fish odor syndrome or fish malodor syndrome, is a rare metabolic disorder where trimethylamine is released in the person&#x27;s sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong fishy odor or strong body odor.

=== Notable Persons with body odor ===
Alicja Janosz, the winner of Polish Idol season 1, is said to have a strong, but attractive, body odor. She met her husband while competing on World Idol when the odor caused him to instantly fall in love. Her opponent on Polish Idol, Ewelina Flinta, is said to have a very repulsive odor, and as a result, has remained single.

<doc id="747246" wikidata="Q1036561" url="?curid=747246" title="AGM-84E Standoff Land Attack Missile">
<text>The AGM-84E SLAM (Standoff Land Attack Missile) was a subsonic, over-the-horizon air-launched cruise missile that was developed by McDonnell Douglas from the AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile. The SLAM was designed to provide all-weather, day and night, precision attack capabilities against stationary high-value targets as well as ships in port.

== Design ==
Except for new technologies in the guidance and seeker sections, which included a Global Positioning System receiver, a modified AGM-65F Maverick missile IIR Seeker, and a modified Walleye datalink, all of the missile hardware came directly from the Harpoon missile. SLAM missile uses an inertial navigation system, which is supplemented by Global Positioning System (GPS) input, and it also uses infrared homing terminal guidance. It could also be guided by any aircraft carrying the AN/AWW-9B and AN/AWW-13 datalink pods. The missile however was unable to avoid terrain, meaning that to attack a target, there had to be no obstacles in the path of the missile.

== Deployment in the Gulf War ==
Developed in 48 months, three SLAMs were successfully employed during the Persian Gulf War, when they were used to strike Iraqi targets. These strikes, made exclusively by the few A-6E SWIP Intruders assigned to VA-75 on the USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; (CV-67), were before official operational testing of the new missile had begun. Only five SLAMs were carried to the war, all on the &quot;Kennedy&quot;. They had also been only been recently moved to carrier.

The first time the SLAM was used in combat came on January 18, 1991, when two SLAMs, fired two minutes apart, were launched by an A-6E SWIP Intruder from VA-75 towards a Hydro-electric plant north of Baghdad on the Tigris River, specifically the power house and turbines. This plant was targeted because it powered the Al-Qa&#x27;im superphosphate fertilizer plant (nicknamed &#x27;Big Al&#x27;), known to produce yellowcake for uranium enrichment. The SLAMs were guided by an A-7E Corsair II from VA-72 (also from the &quot;Kennedy&quot;) via the use of a Datalink pod.

Although GPS guidance could have done the job without the need of the Corsair II, the Navy need the Corsair II to allow the first SLAM to blast a hole, allowing the 2nd SLAM to fly through the hole and cause damage. The last SLAM used in the war was fired that same night against a dam known to generate electricity near Al Qa&#x27;im. The dam was reportedly disabled with that single hit. The strike itself was also successful in that it enabled the Intruder to attack without entering the Missile Engagement Zone of Al-Qa&#x27;im.

== 1990s and retirement ==
Several months after the Gulf War, the SLAM was officially approved for full production on June 28, 1991.

The SLAM was also used during NATO airstrikes in Bosnia during operations Deny Fly (1993-1995) and Deliberate Force (1995). An F/A-18C (N) Hornet from VFA-151 in February 1999 tested the SLAM&#x27;s special GPS only guidance mode against a simulated SA-10 radar van in a target complex located on San Nicolas Island.

In the year 2000, the SLAM was replaced in service by the AGM-84H SLAM-ER (Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response), which had numerous new capabilities including increased target penetration and nearly twice the range of the older AGM-84E SLAM.

<doc id="747252" wikidata="Q1631906" url="?curid=747252" title="NHL (video game series)">
<text>NHL (colloquially referred to as Chel) is a series of professional ice hockey simulation video games developed by EA Vancouver and published yearly by Electronic Arts under the EA Sports brand. The game is developed under license from the National Hockey League (NHL), which enables the use of the league&#x27;s team names, arenas and colors in the game, and the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA), which enables the use of the league&#x27;s player names and likenesses.

== Installments ==
In NHL Hockey from 1991, the game modes were season and playoff, and due to the license, the game was called &quot;EA Hockey&quot; in Europe and featured 22 national teams instead. NHLPA Hockey &#x27;93 was without the NHL license, so instead of NHL team names and logos, there were only cities. In NHL 95 were added game modes exhibition, training, shootout and the possibility to change individual players in teams. On PC, NHL 96 was in 3D with 2D player textures, fights are back (most recently in the first two games). NHL 97 was the first full 3D installment, the national teams of Canada, USA and Russia have been added, the other two teams contain a compilation of the best European players. In NHL 98, 18 national teams were already included. In NHL 99, the career mode was added and in NHL 2000, the tournament mode.



== Leagues ==

In addition to the NHL itself, the different installments of the game include development leagues like the American Hockey League and ECHL, major junior leagues like the member leagues of the Canadian Hockey League, European national leagues from Russia, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Czech Republic, and the European Champions Hockey League.

== Game covers ==

As is traditional with EA Sports, the NHL series boxes feature live action photos instead of drawings. As it lacked the NHLPA license, the early titles staged photos without real players. &quot;NHLPA Hockey 93&quot;, on the other hand, had the rights to use player images, but not of the teams. On this cover, the main action photo features the New York Rangers&#x27; Randy Moller checking the Philadelphia Flyers&#x27; Rod Brind&#x27;Amour while Rangers goaltender Mike Richter makes a save (in this photo there is the logo of the New York Rangers located on the bottom right of the goaltender&#x27;s pants). This photo is surrounded by eight small portraits of players (Steve Yzerman, Andy Moog, Pat LaFontaine, Brian Leetch, Ray Bourque, Patrick Roy, Jeremy Roenick, and Rick Tocchet). This changed with &quot;NHL 94&quot;, which featured a goal situation for Tomas Sandstrom (Los Angeles Kings) against Andy Moog (Boston Bruins). &quot;NHL 95&quot; featured an in-goal camera during a goal scored by Alexei Kovalev of the New York Rangers during the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals against Kirk McLean of the Vancouver Canucks. &quot;NHL 96&quot; featured New Jersey&#x27;s Scott Stevens and Detroit&#x27;s Steve Yzerman. More recently, Claude Giroux was featured on the cover of &quot;NHL 13&quot; and Martin Brodeur was on the cover of &quot;NHL 14&quot;. On June 24, 2014, EA Sports announced at the 2014 NHL Awards in Las Vegas that Patrice Bergeron of the Boston Bruins would be the official cover athlete for &quot;NHL 15&quot;. In 2015, during the NHL awards, it was announced that the cover of &quot;NHL 16&quot; would feature Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane carrying the Stanley Cup together. However, on August 12, 2015, EA announced that Kane would not be appearing on the cover or participating in any promotional activities for the game in light of a criminal investigation he was involved in. Instead, the cover featured Toews alone. At the 2016 NHL Awards, it was announced that Vladimir Tarasenko of the St. Louis Blues was to appear on the cover of &quot;NHL 17&quot;. On June 21, 2017, during the 2017 NHL Awards, EA announced that Connor McDavid of the Edmonton Oilers would be the cover athlete on &quot;NHL 18&quot;. On August 22, 2024, EA announced that Quinn Hughes of the Vancouver Canucks would be the Canadian and international cover athlete, and Jack Hughes of the New Jersey Devils would be the US regional cover athlete on &quot;NHL 25&quot;. And on the deluxe edition cover of &quot;NHL 25&quot;, all three Hughes brothers (including Luke Hughes of the New Jersey Devils) are the cover athletes together, which is for the first time in video game history that three siblings are on a video game cover art together.

== Commentary ==

In &quot;NHLPA &#x27;93&quot; and &quot;NHL &#x27;94&quot;, Emmy award-winning sportscaster Ron Barr gives a pre-game scouting report prior to each game. In the Genesis version of NHL 95, KNBR radio sportscaster John Shrader replaced Ron Barr in that duty. Live play-by-play commentary was introduced in the PC version of &quot;NHL 97&quot;. Jim Hughson, former play-by-play man for CBC&#x27;s &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; and also one of Canada&#x27;s best-known hockey announcers, provided the play-by-play for much of the series. The last games in which he is one of the announcers are the PC and PS2 versions of NHL 09. Bill Clement was the sole commentator in the Nintendo 64 version of &quot;NHL 99&quot;. Gary Thorne provided the play-by-play commentary in all Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions from &quot;NHL 07&quot; through &quot;NHL 14&quot;. NBC Sports commentator Mike Emrick and Eddie Olczyk provided the play-by-play and color commentary on all platforms, with their first appearance together being in &quot;NHL 15&quot; and last in &quot;NHL 19&quot;. James Cybulski is the current play-by-play commentator, starting with &quot;NHL 20&quot;. &quot;NHL 15&quot; was also the first game to introduce an ice level analyst, with TSN analyst Ray Ferraro appearing in the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of the game. Color commentary has been provided by Daryl Reaugh (NHL 98–99), Bill Clement (NHL 2000–2001, and NHL 07–14 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3), Don Taylor (NHL 2002–2003), Craig Simpson (NHL 2004–09), Eddie Olczyk (NHL 15–19). Ferraro made the jump from ice-level analyst to full color commentator in &quot;NHL 20&quot; (NHL 20–23). Ferraro was replaced by Cheryl Pounder as color commentator in &quot;NHL 24&quot; (NHL 24-present).
== Controversy ==

One idea that has been widely discussed over many years within the fan community is a purported automatic built-in gameplay mechanism called ”ice tilt”, which modifies skaters&#x27; and/or goalies&#x27; and/or the referee&#x27;s penalty-decision-making behavior irrationally to favor a worse player, a player on a losing streak or a player who is down by multiple goals. EA Sports has openly denied the existence of any such mechanism, instead saying that winning is a product of skill and the quality of the team&#x27;s roster. However, EA once published a document about a feature called &quot;Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment&quot;, which was interpreted by some as confirming the existence of ice tilt. EA has not denied this. In fact, they patented the software for it.
== Soundtracks ==
&quot;NHL 99&quot; was the first game in the series to feature fully licensed music from David Bowie for the intro video. Since then, each game has had soundtracks of licensed music known as EA Sports Trax, with selections of punk, alternative, and rock music. Electronic and hip hop music was later added to the mix in later games. &quot;NHL 15&quot; and &quot;NHL 16&quot; on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One use an original orchestral score instead for the menus, while the soundtrack continues playing in the arenas. &quot;NHL 17&quot; returned to the traditional EA Trax feature and also allowed the option to switch back to the original score from &quot;NHL 15&quot;.

<doc id="747259" wikidata="Q923955" url="?curid=747259" title="Dependency theory">
<text>Dependency theory is the idea that resources flow from a &quot;periphery&quot; of poor and exploited states to a &quot;core&quot; of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. A central contention of dependency theory is that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the &quot;world system&quot;. This theory was officially developed in the late 1960s following World War II, as scholars searched for the root issue in the lack of development in Latin America.

The theory arose as a reaction to modernization theory, an earlier theory of development which held that all societies progress through similar stages of development, that today&#x27;s underdeveloped areas are thus in a similar situation to that of today&#x27;s developed areas at some time in the past, and that, therefore, the task of helping the underdeveloped areas out of poverty is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as investment, technology transfers, and closer integration into the world market. Dependency theory rejected this view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and structures of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy.

Some writers have argued for its continuing relevance as a conceptual orientation to the global division of wealth. Dependency theorists can typically be divided into two categories: liberal reformists and neo-Marxists. Liberal reformists typically advocate for targeted policy interventions, while the neo-Marxists propose a planned economy.

==Basics==

The premises of dependency theory are that:
# Poor nations provide natural resources, cheap labour, a destination for obsolete technology, and markets for developed nations, without which the latter could not have the standard of living they enjoy. 
# Wealthy nations actively perpetuate a state of dependence by various means. This influence may be multifaceted, involving economics, media control, politics, banking and finance, education, culture, and sport.

==History==
Dependency theory originates with two papers published in 1949, one by Hans Singer and one by Raúl Prebisch, in which the authors observe that the terms of trade for underdeveloped countries relative to the developed countries had deteriorated over time: the underdeveloped countries were able to purchase fewer and fewer manufactured goods from the developed countries in exchange for a given quantity of their raw materials exports. This idea is known as the Prebisch–Singer thesis. Prebisch, an Argentine economist at the United Nations Commission for Latin America (UNCLA), went on to conclude that the underdeveloped nations must employ some degree of protectionism in trade if they were to enter a self-sustaining development path. He argued that import-substitution industrialisation (ISI), not a trade-and-export orientation, was the best strategy for underdeveloped countries. The theory was developed from a Marxian perspective by Paul A. Baran in 1957 with the publication of his &quot;The Political Economy of Growth&quot;. Dependency theory shares many points with earlier, Marxist, theories of imperialism by Rosa Luxemburg and Vladimir Lenin, and has attracted continued interest from Marxists. Some authors identify two main streams in dependency theory: the Latin American Structuralist, typified by the work of Prebisch, Celso Furtado, and Aníbal Pinto at the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC, or, in Spanish, CEPAL); and the American Marxist, developed by Paul A. Baran, Paul Sweezy, and Andre Gunder Frank.

Using the Latin American dependency model, the Guyanese Marxist historian Walter Rodney, in his book &quot;How Europe Underdeveloped Africa&quot;, described in 1972 an Africa that had been consciously exploited by European imperialists, leading directly to the modern underdevelopment of most of the continent.

The theory was popular in the 1960s and 1970s as a criticism of modernization theory, which was falling increasingly out of favor because of continued widespread poverty in much of the world. At that time the assumptions of liberal theories of development were under attack. It was used to explain the causes of overurbanization, a theory that urbanization rates outpaced industrial growth in several developing countries.

The Latin American Structuralist and the American Marxist schools had significant differences but, according to economist Matias Vernengo, they agreed on some basic points:[B]oth groups would agree that at the core of the dependency relation between center and periphery lays [lies] the inability of the periphery to develop an autonomous and dynamic process of technological innovation. Technology – the Promethean force unleashed by the Industrial Revolution – is at the center of stage. The Center countries controlled the technology and the systems for generating technology. Foreign capital could not solve the problem, since it only led to limited transmission of technology, but not the process of innovation itself. Baran and others frequently spoke of the international division of labour – skilled workers in the center; unskilled in the periphery – when discussing key features of dependency.

Baran placed surplus extraction and capital accumulation at the center of his analysis. Development depends on a population&#x27;s producing more than it needs for bare subsistence (a surplus). Further, some of that surplus must be used for capital accumulation – the purchase of new means of production – if development is to occur; spending the surplus on things like luxury consumption does not produce development. Baran noted two predominant kinds of economic activity in poor countries. In the older of the two, plantation agriculture, which originated in colonial times, most of the surplus goes to the landowners, who use it to emulate the consumption patterns of wealthy people in the developed world; much of it thus goes to purchase foreign-produced luxury items –automobiles, clothes, etc. – and little is accumulated for investing in development. The more recent kind of economic activity in the periphery is industry—but of a particular kind. It is usually carried out by foreigners, although often in conjunction with local interests. It is often under special tariff protection or other government concessions. The surplus from this production mostly goes to two places: part of it is sent back to the foreign shareholders as profit; the other part is spent on conspicuous consumption in a similar fashion to that of the plantation aristocracy. Again, little is used for development. Baran thought that political revolution was necessary to break this pattern.

In the 1960s, members of the Latin American Structuralist school argued that there is more latitude in the system than the Marxists believed. They argued that it allows for partial development or &quot;dependent development&quot;–development, but still under the control of outside decision makers. They cited the partly successful attempts at industrialisation in Latin America around that time (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico) as evidence for this hypothesis. They were led to the position that dependency is not a relation between commodity exporters and industrialised countries, but between countries with different degrees of industrialisation. In their approach, there is a distinction made between the economic and political spheres: economically, one may be developed or underdeveloped; but even if (somewhat) economically developed, one may be politically autonomous or dependent. More recently, Guillermo O&#x27;Donnell has argued that constraints placed on development by neoliberalism were lifted by the military coups in Latin America that came to promote development in authoritarian guise (O&#x27;Donnell, 1982).

These positions particularly in regard of Latin America were notably challenged theoretically in the work and teaching of Ruy Mauro Marini who developed wider recognition for a specifically Marxist Dependency Theory, after close reading of Marx, that super-exploitation and unequal exchange characteristically arose out of the specific forms in the capital reproduction of dependency, and the specific class relations particular to that dependency in the periphery .

The importance of multinational corporations and state promotion of technology were emphasised by the Latin American Structuralists.

Fajnzylber has made a distinction between systemic or authentic competitiveness, which is the ability to compete based on higher productivity, and spurious competitiveness, which is based on low wages.

The third-world debt crisis of the 1980s and continued stagnation in Africa and Latin America in the 1990s caused some doubt as to the feasibility or desirability of &quot;dependent development&quot;.

The &quot;sine qua non&quot; of the dependency relationship is not the difference in technological sophistication, as traditional dependency theorists believe, but rather the difference in financial strength between core and peripheral countries–particularly the inability of peripheral countries to borrow in their own currency. He believes that the hegemonic position of the United States is very strong because of the importance of its financial markets and because it controls the international reserve currency – the US dollar. He believes that the end of the Bretton Woods international financial agreements in the early 1970s considerably strengthened the United States&#x27; position because it removed some constraints on their financial actions.

&quot;Standard&quot; dependency theory differs from Marxism, in arguing against internationalism and any hope of progress in less developed nations towards industrialization and a liberating revolution. Theotonio dos Santos described a &quot;new dependency&quot;, which focused on both the internal and external relations of less-developed countries of the periphery, derived from a Marxian analysis. Former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso (in office 1995–2002) wrote extensively on dependency theory while in political exile during the 1960s, arguing that it was an approach to studying the economic disparities between the centre and periphery. Cardoso summarized his version of dependency theory as follows:
*there is a financial and technological penetration by the developed capitalist centers of the countries of the periphery and semi-periphery;
*this produces an unbalanced economic structure both within the peripheral societies and between them and the centers;
*this leads to limitations on self-sustained growth in the periphery;
*this favors the appearance of specific patterns of class relations;
*these require modifications in the role of the state to guarantee both the functioning of the economy and the political articulation of a society, which contains, within itself, foci of inarticulateness and structural imbalance.

The analysis of development patterns in the 1990s and beyond is complicated by the fact that capitalism develops not smoothly, but with very strong and self-repeating ups and downs, called cycles. Relevant results are given in studies by Joshua Goldstein, Volker Bornschier, and Luigi Scandella.

With the economic growth of India and some East Asian economies, dependency theory has lost some of its former influence. It still influences some NGO campaigns, such as Make Poverty History and the fair trade movement.

==Other theorists and related theories==
Two other early writers relevant to dependency theory were François Perroux and Kurt Rothschild. Other leading dependency theorists include Herb Addo, Walden Bello, Ruy Mauro Marini, Enzo Faletto, Armando Cordova, Ernest Feder, Pablo González Casanova, Keith Griffin, Kunibert Raffer, Paul Israel Singer, Walter Rodney and Osvaldo Sunkel. Many of these authors focused their attention on Latin America; dependency theory in the Arab world was primarily refined by the Egyptian economist Samir Amin.

Tausch, based on works of Amin from 1973 to 1997, lists the following main characteristics of periphery capitalism:
#Regression in both agriculture and small scale industry characterizes the period after the onslaught of foreign domination and colonialism
#Unequal international specialization of the periphery leads to the concentration of activities in export-oriented agriculture and or mining. Some industrialization of the periphery is possible under the condition of low wages, which, together with rising productivity, determine that unequal exchange sets in (double factorial terms of trade &lt; 1.0; see Raffer, 1987)
#These structures determine in the long run a rapidly growing tertiary sector with hidden unemployment and the rising importance of rent in the overall social and economic system
#Chronic current account balance deficits, re-exported profits of foreign investments, and deficient business cycles at the periphery that provide important markets for the centers during world economic upswings
#Structural imbalances in the political and social relationships, inter alia a strong &#x27;&#x27; element and the rising importance of state capitalism and an indebted state class

The American sociologist Immanuel Wallerstein refined the Marxist aspect of the theory and expanded on it, to form world-systems theory. World Systems Theory is also known as WST and aligns closely with the idea of the &quot;rich get richer and the poor get poorer&quot;. Wallerstein states that the poor and peripheral nations continue to get more poor as the developed core nations use their resources to become richer. Wallerstein developed the World Systems Theory utilizing the Dependence theory along with the ideas of Marx and the Annales School. This theory postulates a third category of countries, the &quot;semi-periphery&quot;, intermediate between the core and periphery. Wallerstein believed in a tri-modal rather than a bi-modal system because he viewed the world-systems as more complicated than a simplistic classification as either core or periphery nations. To Wallerstein, many nations do not fit into one of these two categories, so he proposed the idea of a semi-periphery as an in between state within his model. In this model, the semi-periphery is industrialized, but with less sophistication of technology than in the core; and it does not control finances. The rise of one group of semi-peripheries tends to be at the cost of another group, but the unequal structure of the world economy based on unequal exchange tends to remain stable. Tausch traces the beginnings of world-systems theory to the writings of the Austro-Hungarian socialist Karl Polanyi after the First World War, but its present form is usually associated with the work of Wallerstein.

Dependency theorists hold that short-term spurts of growth notwithstanding, long-term growth in the periphery will be imbalanced and unequal, and will tend towards high negative current account balances. Cyclical fluctuations also have a profound effect on cross-national comparisons of economic growth and societal development in the medium and long run. What seemed like spectacular long-run growth may in the end turn out to be just a short run cyclical spurt after a long recession. Cycle time plays an important role. Giovanni Arrighi believed that the logic of accumulation on a world scale shifts over time, and that the 1980s and beyond once more showed a deregulated phase of world capitalism with a logic, characterized - in contrast to earlier regulatory cycles - by the dominance of financial capital.

==Criticism==
Economic policies based on dependency theory have been criticized by free-market economists such as Peter Bauer and Martin Wolf and others:

*Lack of competition: by subsidizing in-country industries and preventing outside imports, these companies may have less incentive to improve their products, to try to become more efficient in their processes, to please customers, or to research new innovations.
*Sustainability: industries reliant on government support may not be sustainable for very long, particularly in poorer countries and countries which largely depend on foreign aid from more developed countries.
*Domestic opportunity costs: subsidies on domestic industries come out of state coffers and therefore represent money not spent in other ways, like development of domestic infrastructure, seed capital or need-based social welfare programs. At the same time, the higher prices caused by tariffs and restrictions on imports require the people either to forgo these goods altogether or buy them at higher prices, forgoing other goods.

Market economists cite a number of examples in their arguments against dependency theory. The improvement of India&#x27;s economy after it moved from state-controlled business to open trade is one of the most often cited. India&#x27;s example seems to contradict dependency theorists&#x27; claims concerning comparative advantage and mobility, as much as its economic growth originated from movements such as outsourcing – one of the most mobile forms of capital transfer. In Africa, states that have emphasized import-substitution development, such as Zimbabwe, have typically been among the worst performers, while the continent&#x27;s most successful non-oil based economies, such as Egypt, South Africa, and Tunisia, have pursued trade-based development.

According to economic historian Robert C. Allen, dependency theory&#x27;s claims are &quot;debatable&quot; due to fact that the protectionism that was implemented in Latin America as a solution ended up failing. The countries incurred too much debt and Latin America went into a recession. One of the problems was that the Latin American countries simply had too small national markets to be able to efficiently produce complex industrialized goods, such as automobiles.

== Examples of dependency theory ==
Many nations have been affected by both the positive and negative effects of the Dependency Theory. The idea of national dependency on another nation is not a relatively new concept even though the dependency theory itself is rather new. Dependency is perpetuated by using capitalism and finance. The dependent nations come to owe the developed nations so much money and capital that it is not possible to escape the debt, continuing the dependency for the foreseeable future.

An example of the dependency theory is that during the years of 1650 to 1900 European nations such as Britain and France took over or colonialized other nations. They used their superior military technology and naval strength at the time to do this. This began an economic system in the Americas, Africa, and Asia to then export the natural materials from their land to Europe. After shipping the materials to Europe, Britain and the other European countries made products with these materials and then sent them back to colonized parts of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. This resulted in the transfer of wealth from these regions’ products to Europe for taking control of the products. 

Some scholars and politicians claim that with the decline of colonialism, dependency has been erased. Other scholars counter this approach, and state that our society still has national powerhouses such as the United States, European Nations such as Germany and Britain, China, and rising India that hundreds of other nations rely on for military aid, economic investments, etc.

==Aid dependency==
Aid dependency is an economic problem described as the reliance of less developed countries (LDCs) on more developed countries (MDCs) for financial aid and other resources. More specifically, aid dependency refers to the proportion of government spending that is given by foreign donors. A nation having an aid dependency ratio of about 15%-20% or higher is correlated with negative outcomes for that nation. What causes dependency is the inhibition of development and economic/political reform that results from trying to use aid as a long-term solution to poverty-ridden countries. Aid dependency arose from long term provisions of aid to countries in need in which the receiving country became accustomed to and developed a dependency syndrome. Aid dependency is most common today in Africa. The top donors as of 2013 were the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany while the top receivers were Afghanistan, Vietnam, and Ethiopia.

=== History of aid dependence ===
International development aid became widely popularized post World-War Two due to first-world countries trying to create a more open economy as well as cold war competition. In 1970, the United Nations agreed on 0.7% of Gross National Income per country as the target for how much should be dedicated for international aid. In his book “Ending Aid Dependence”, Yash Tondon describes how organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) have driven many African countries into dependency. During the economic crisis in the 1980s and the 1990s, a great deal of Sub-Saharan countries in Africa saw an influx of aid money which in turn resulted in dependency over the next few decades. These countries became so dependent that the President of Tanzania, Benjamin W. Mkapa, stated that “Development aid has taken deep root to the psyche of the people, especially in the poorer countries of the South. It is similar to drug addiction.”

=== Motives for giving aid ===
While the widespread belief is that aid is motivated only by assisting poor countries, and this is true in some cases, there is substantial evidence that suggests strategic, political, and welfare interests of the donors are driving forces behind aid. Maizels and Nissanke (MN 1984), and McKinlay and Little (ML, 1977) have conducted studies to analyze donors’ motives. From these studies they found that US aid flows are influenced by military as well as strategic factors. British and French aid is given to countries that were former colonies, and also to countries in which they have significant investment interest and strong trade relations.

=== Stunted economic growth ===
A main concern revolving around the issue of foreign aid is that the citizens in the country that is benefiting from aid lose motivation to work after receiving aid. In addition, some citizens will deliberately work less, resulting in a lower income, which in turn qualifies them for aid provision. Aid dependent countries are associated with having a lowly motivated workforce, a result from being accustomed to constant aid, and therefore the country is less likely to make economic progress and the living-standards are less likely to be improved. A country with long-term aid dependency remains unable to be self-sufficient and is less likely to make meaningful GDP growth which would allow for them to rely less on aid from richer countries. Food aid has been criticized heavily along with other aid imports due to its damage to the domestic economy. A higher dependency on aid imports results in a decline in the domestic demand for those products. In the long-run, the agricultural industry in LDC countries grows weaker due to long-term declines in demand as a result from food aid. In the future when aid is decreased, many LDC countries&#x27;s agricultural markets are under-developed and therefore it is cheaper to import agricultural products. This occurred in Haiti, where 80% of their grain stocks come from the United States even after a large decrease in aid. In countries where there is a primary-product dependency on an item being imported as aid, such as wheat, economic shocks can occur and push the country further into an economic crisis.

=== Political dependency ===
Political dependency occurs when donors have too much influence in the governance of the receiving country. Many donors maintain a strong say in the government due to the country&#x27;s reliance on their money, causing a decrease in the effectiveness and democratic-quality of the government. This results in the receiving country&#x27;s government making policy that the donor agrees with and supports rather than what the people of the country desire. Government corruptibility increases as a result and inhibits reform of the government and political process in the country. These donors can include other countries or organizations with underlying intentions that may not be in favor of the people. Political dependency is an even stronger negative effect of aid dependency in countries where many of the problems stem from already corrupt politics and a lack of civil rights. For example, Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of the Congo both have extremely high aid dependency ratios and have experienced political turmoil. The politics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have involved civil war and changing of regimes in the 21st century and have one of the highest aid dependency ratios in Africa.

As aid dependence can shift accountability away from the public and to being between state and donors, “presidentialism” can arise. Presidentialism is when the president and the cabinet within a political system have the power in political decision-making. In a democracy, budgets and public investment plans are to be approved by parliament. It is common for donors to fund projects outside of this budget and therefore go without parliament review. This further reinforces presidentialism and establishes practices that undermine democracy. Disputes over taxation and use of revenues are important in a democracy and can lead to better lives for citizens, but this cannot happen if citizens and parliaments don&#x27;t know the complete proposed budget and spending priorities.

Aid dependency also compromises ownership which is marked by the ability of a government to implement its own ideas and policies. In aid dependent countries, the interests and ideas of aid agencies start to become priority and therefore erode ownership.

=== Corruption ===
Aid dependent countries rank worse in terms of level of corruption than in countries that are not dependent. Foreign aid is a potential source of rents, and rent-seeking can manifest as increased public sector employment. As public firms displace private investment, there is less pressure on the government to remain accountable and transparent as a result of the weakened private sector. Aid assists corruption which then fosters more corruption and creates a cycle. Foreign aid provides corrupt governments with free cash flow which further facilitates the corruption. Corruption works against economic growth and development, holding these poor countries down.

=== Efforts to end aid dependence ===
Since 2000, aid dependency has decreased by about ⅓. This can be seen in countries like Ghana, whose aid dependency decreased from 47% to 27%, as well as in Mozambique, where the aid dependency decreased from 74% to 58%. Target areas to decrease aid dependence include job creation, regional integration, and commercial engagement and trade. Long-term investment in agriculture and infrastructure are key requirements to end aid dependency as it will allow the country to slowly decrease the amount of food aid received and begin to develop its own agricultural economy and solve the food insecurity

=== Countering political corruption ===
Political corruption has been a strong force associated with maintaining dependency and being unable to see economic growth. During the Obama administration, congress claimed that the anti-corruption criteria The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) used was not strict enough and was one of the obstacles to decreasing aid dependence. Often, in countries with a high corruption perception index the aid money is taken from government officials in the public sector or taken from other corrupt individuals in the private sector. Efforts to disapprove aid to countries where corruption is very prevalent have been a common tool used by organizations and governments to ensure funding is used properly but also to encourage other countries to fix the corruption.

=== Other methods of aid ===
It has been proven that foreign aid can prove useful in the long-run when directed towards the appropriate sector and managed accordingly. Specific pairing between organizations and donors with similar goals has produced more success in decreasing dependency than the tradition form of international aid which involves government to government communication. Botswana is a successful example of this. Botswana first began receiving aid in 1966. In this case, Botswana decided which areas needed aid and found donors accordingly rather than simply accepting aid from other countries whose governments had a say in where the money would be distributed towards. Recipient-led cases such as Botswana are more effective partially because it negates the donor&#x27;s desirability to report numbers on the efficiency of their programs (that often include short-term figures such as food distributed) and instead focuses more on long-term growth and development that may be directed more towards infrastructure, education, and job development.

<text>The Folsom Lake State Recreation Area surrounds Folsom Lake in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The majority of it is owned by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and is managed by the California Department of Parks and Recreation. It is located near the city of Folsom, California, about east of Sacramento.

== General ==
The park was established in 1956 after the creation of the Folsom Dam. Folsom Lake is the ninth largest reservoir in California and a major recreational asset for the Sacramento area. It consists of two reservoirs: Folsom and Natoma. About 2 million people visit the Folsom Lake State Recreation Area every year. Generally, Folsom Lake State Recreation Area experiences hot summers and mild winters. Campgrounds in the area consist of the Peninsula Campground, Beals Point Campground, Black Miners Bar, and Avery&#x27;s Pond.

The lake and recreation area offer opportunities for hiking, biking, running, camping, picnicking, horseback riding, water-skiing and boating. Fishing offers trout, catfish, largemouth and smallmouth bass or yellow perch. Visitors can also tour nearby Folsom Powerhouse State Historic Park (once called &quot;the greatest operative electrical plant on the American continent&quot;), which from 1885 to 1952 produced 11,000 volts of electricity for Sacramento residents. For cyclists there is a bicycle path that connects Folsom Lake with many Sacramento County parks before reaching Old Sacramento. The park also includes Lake Natoma, downstream from Folsom Lake, which is popular for crew races, sailing, kayaking and other aquatic sports.

The primary recreation season coincides with the spring and summer months when temperatures are in the 80s, 90s and 100s. Visitation is highest from April through September. In the spring months when school is still in session, evenings and weekends are the times of highest lake activity.

There are 95 miles of trail at Folsom Lake State Recreation Area, used by hikers, bicyclists, runners, and horseback riders. A portion of the Western States/Pioneer Express Trail between Sacramento and Carson City also runs through the park. A paved bicycle trail loops around Lake Natoma, linking to Beals Point and the American River Bike Trail.

== History == 
Native Americans of the Maidu and Nisenan tribes inhabited the land around Folsom Lake for thousands of years. During the winter, they lived in permanent villages around the American River and in the summer made temporary homes made of bark. The Nisenan used local resources found around the lake like acorns and berries to trade with coastal tribes. They wove their baskets from willow, redbud, tule, milkweed, sedge grass and native grapevine. In 1848, the California Gold Rush began and most of the Nisenan land was given away. The Nisenan became overwhelmed and their population was severely decimated due to diseases. However, some survived and still live in surrounding reservations.

The Folsom Lake area was also a significant mining site during the California Gold Rush of 1849. During recent drought years, water levels had been so low at Folsom Lake that the old mining town of Mormon Island was revealed. Mormon Island was a sandbar about 300 feet long where gold was found by members of the Mormon Battalion. When news of gold discovery spread, Mormon Island grew and gained a population of up to 2,500 people by 1853. However, By the 1940s, very few families were left in the area due to fire, diminished gold, and a new railroad.

The Natoma Water Company was formed in 1851 by local miners to construct a 20-mile ditch that would supply water for miners seeking gold. The ditch started up by the new salmon falls bridge and reached down to Granite City, which today is named Folsom. The ditch was named the &quot;Natomas Ditch&quot; and it cost around $175,000 to build. In 1912 the Natoma Water Company lined 13,000 feet of the ditch with concrete. In 1953 the government bought most area to build Folsom Lake. The Natoma Water Company is now called Natoma Company.

People from all over the world came to the South Fork and North Fork of the American River to mine for gold, including England, Scotland, Wales, New York, Virginia, Kentucky, Hawaii, and China. They camped next to their mining areas and eventually these camps became small towns. Among these are Rattlesnake Bar, Mormon Bar, Mormon Ravine, Oregon Bar, and Manhattan Bar.

Folsom Dam was built in 1955 as a concrete dam flanked by earth wing dams and dikes, with a total length of about nine miles. The shoreline extends about 15 miles up the forks of the American River. Lake levels at Folsom Lake State Recreation Area normally vary from 460 feet in early spring to less than 400 feet by summer as the rainy weather passes and snow in the Sierra Nevada melts. Downstream, behind Nimbus Dam, smaller Lake Natoma has about 500 surface acres of water. Folsom and Nimbus Dams were built by the Bureau of Reclamation as part of California&#x27;s Central Valley Project to control the waters of the American River. Other functions of the dams include flood protection, household water supply, power and irrigation.

In May 1979, the California State Park and Recreation Commission approved the General Plan for the Folsom Lake State Recreation Area. The public participated heavily in this plan through six public workshops and over 3,500 mail in questionnaires. The public agreed that Lake Natoma should retain its quiet character but Folsom Lake needed to be upgraded for recreational use.

==Flora and fauna==
Folsom Lake State Recreation Area is home to many species of plants and animals. Some of the common plants in the area include blue oaks, interior live oaks, foothill pines and annual grasses. In the spring, wildflowers include Indian paintbrush, larkspur, lupine, brodiaea, fiddleneck, Dutchman&#x27;s pipe and monkeyflower. In addition to plant life, there are also several species of animals including black-tailed deer, raccoons, skunks, opossums, gray foxes and coyotes. Birds commonly found in the area include nesting egrets, herons and cormorants, Canada geese, blackbirds, scrub jays, quails, wrens, bushtits and towhees. There are also wrentits, California thrashers, kingfishers and grebes near the water. Red-tailed hawks, American kestrels, ospreys and eagles may be spotted flying over the area. Rattlesnakes are also common.

The park has many ancient blue oak trees that range from 400 to 500 years old. Vegetation in the area is 50 percent interior live oak, 25 percent blue oak, 14 percent annual grassland, 5 percent cottonwood/willow riparian, freshwater marsh and seasonal wetlands, and less than 5 acres of vernal pools.

Birdwatching is a year-round activity. Bird migration occurs in autumn and spring. Lake Natoma and Folsom Lake have up to 80,000 wintering gulls and some waterfowl. Great blue herons, great egrets and double-crested cormorants begin setting up breeding territories in February and stay until August. Their young can be seen March though August.

== Campgrounds ==
Peninsula campground

Peninsula campground is located at the end of Rattlesnake Bar Road, on the peninsula between the North and South Forks of the American River. It can be accessed from Pilot Hill on Highway 49 by following Rattlesnake Bar Road 11 miles to the campground. It is also accessible by boat for Boat-In camping. It has 100 campsites with facilities including flush toilets, hot showers, piped water, sanitation station, two boat launch ramps, and oaks nature trail. Peninsula is a remote campground which can be subject to winter and/or road closures. Campsite reservations can be made only on-season and during off-season it is first-come, first-served.

Beals Point campground

Beals Point is located on the west shore of Folsom Lake, just north of the dam. It can be accessed off Auburn-Folsom Road, south of Douglas Boulevard. There are 69 sites allowing trailers and RVs up to 31’. Facilities include flush toilets, hot showers, piped water, sanitation station, snack bar, beach equipment rentals, and a beach.

Black Miners Bar group campsites

Black Miners Bar is located on the west side of Lake Natoma. It can be accessed off Greenback Lane in Folsom. Campground facilities include 3 Group sites. Sites A &amp; B accommodate 50 people and Site C can accommodate 25 people. Flush toilets are available. A Group must contain at least 9 people. Gold was first discovered along the south bank of the American River in the area originally known as Negro Bar. This site received its name because it was one of the earliest recorded locations mined by African-American gold miners during the California Gold Rush of 1849. At the time, Negro Bar was a large sand bar located on the south bank of the lower American River, in what is now the City of Folsom. Most African American miners left by 1852 to nearby mining sites that were more successful. Today, Black Miners Bar is located on the opposite side of the American River. The site was temporarily renamed in 2022, while a permanent name is being decided.

Avery&#x27;s Pond environmental campsites

Avery&#x27;s Pond is located near Rattlesnake Bar, north of the Rattlesnake Bar Equestrian Assembly Area. It can be accessed by parking at Rattlesnake Bar and walking 1.1 miles to the sites. There are 2 Sites and each holds 8 people. There are no water or garbage service and no dogs or fires allowed. It is commonly used as a horseback riding trail.
Avery&#x27;s pond is a historical pond made in the 1880s by a pioneer rancher named Ira Avery. Elevation of the pond is at 530 feet, about 20 feet above Folsom Lake. The 1854 North Fork Diversion ditch provided water for Avery&#x27;s Pond and water from the pond became a reliable year-around water source for Avery&#x27;s extensive orchards. Avery used to supply lumber, fruit, and sheep to the gold miners in the area. His ranch consisted of about 117 acres, of which 40 acres had 1,500 fruit trees (pears, persimmons, cherries). The pond is lined with fine-grained alluvium.
== Nimbus Dam and Lake Natoma ==
Nimbus Dam and Lake Natoma are also included in the vicinity of the Folsom Lake State Recreation Area. 

Historically, the American River provided approximately 100 miles of stream in which salmon and steelhead could spawn and rear. When the Folsom-Nimbus project was completed in 1958, most of the spawning and rearing areas for the fish were cut off. Nimbus Hatchery was constructed to replace the salmon and steelhead runs that were blocked by Nimbus dam. The Nimbus Fish Hatchery located at Nimbus Dam raises Chinook salmon and steelhead for release to the American River. About 4 million Chinook salmon and 43,000 steelhead are released each year. Educational activities for children and adults are offered. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation pays the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to operate the hatchery.

Lake Natoma is an intermediate lake along the American River, located between Folsom Dam and Nimbus Dam. It is primarily a recreational lake. It includes Black Miners Bar. The Sacramento State Aquatic Center is also located here and equipment rentals are available for paddling, rowing, water ski and wakeboard, boating and jet skiing, and sailing and windsurfing. The Sac State Aquatic Center is a cooperation between students at Sacramento State, the University Union at Sac State, California Department of Boating and Waterways, and the California Department of Parks and Recreation.

<text>A Snellen chart is an eye chart that can be used to measure visual acuity. Snellen charts are named after the Dutch ophthalmologist Herman Snellen who developed the chart in 1862 as a measurement tool for the acuity formula developed by his professor Franciscus Cornelius Donders. Many ophthalmologists and vision scientists now use an improved chart known as the LogMAR chart.

==History==

Snellen developed charts using symbols based in a 5×5 unit grid. The experimental charts developed in 1861 used abstract symbols. Snellen&#x27;s charts published in 1862 used alphanumeric capitals in the 5×5 grid. The original chart shows A, C, E, G, L, N, P, R, T, 5, V, Z, B, D, 4, F, H, K, O, S, 3, U, Y, A, C, E, G, L, 2.

==Description==
The normal Snellen chart is printed with eleven lines of block letters. The first line
consists of one very large letter, which may be one of several letters, for example E, H, or N. Subsequent rows have increasing numbers of letters that decrease in size. A person taking the test covers one eye from 6 metres or 20 feet away, and reads aloud the letters of each row, beginning at the top. The smallest row that can be read accurately indicates the visual acuity in that specific eye.
The symbols on an acuity chart are formally known as &quot;optotypes&quot;.
In the case of the traditional Snellen chart, the optotypes have the appearance of block letters, and are intended to be seen and read as letters. They are not, however, letters from any ordinary typographer&#x27;s font. They have a particular, simple geometry in which:
* the thickness of the lines equals the thickness of the white spaces between lines and the thickness of the gap in the letter &quot;C&quot;
* the height and width of the optotype (letter) is five times the thickness of the line.
Only the nine letters C, D, E, F, L, O, P, T, Z are used in the common Snellen chart. The perception of five out of six letters (or similar ratio) is judged to be the Snellen fraction.
Wall-mounted Snellen charts are inexpensive and are sometimes used for approximate assessment of vision, e.g. in a primary-care physician&#x27;s office. Whenever acuity must be assessed carefully (as in an eye doctor&#x27;s examination), or where there is a possibility that the examinee might attempt to deceive the examiner (as in a motor vehicle license office), equipment is used that can present the letters in a variety of randomized patterns.
BS 4274-1:1968 (British Standards Institution) &quot;Specification for test charts for determining distance visual acuity&quot; was replaced by BS 4274-1:2003 &quot;Test charts for clinical determination of distance visual acuity — Specification&quot;. It states that &quot;the luminance of the presentation shall be uniform and not less than 120 cd/m2. Any variation across the test chart shall not exceed 20 %.&quot;
According to BS 4274-1:2003 only the letters C, D, E, F, H, K, N, P, R, U, V, and Z should be used for the testing of vision based upon equal legibility of the letters.

==Snellen fraction==

Visual acuity is the distance at which test is made / distance at which the smallest optotype identified subtends an angle of five arcminutes and the critical distinguishing features of the optotype subtend an angle of one arcminute.

==&quot;6/6&quot;(m) or &quot;20/20&quot;(ft) vision==

Snellen defined &quot;standard vision&quot; as the ability to recognize one of his optotypes when it subtended 5 minutes of arc. Thus the optotype can only be recognized if the person viewing it can discriminate a spatial pattern separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc.

Outside the United States, the standard chart distance is , and normal acuity is designated &quot;6/6&quot;. Other acuities are expressed as ratios with a numerator of 6. Some clinics do not have 6-metre eye lanes available, and either a half-size chart subtending the same angles at , or a reversed chart projected and viewed by a mirror is used to achieve the correct sized letters.

In the most familiar acuity test, a Snellen chart is placed at a standard distance: 6 metres. At this distance, the symbols on the line representing &quot;normal&quot; acuity subtend an angle of five minutes of arc, and the thickness of the lines and of the spaces between the lines subtends one minute of arc. This line, designated 6/6 (or 20/20), is the smallest line that a person with normal acuity can read at a distance of 6 metres. This definition is arbitrary, since human eyes typically have higher acuity, as Tscherning writes, &quot;We have found also that the best eyes have a visual acuity which approaches 2, and we can be almost certain that if, with a good illumination, the acuity is only equal to 1, the eye presents defects sufficiently pronounced to be easily established.&quot;

Three lines above, the letters have twice the height of those letters on the 6/6 (or 20/20 in the US) line. If this is the smallest line a person can read, the person&#x27;s acuity is &quot;6/12&quot; (&quot;20/40&quot;), meaning that this person needs to approach to a distance of to read letters that a person with normal acuity could read at . In an even more approximate manner, this person could be said to have &quot;half&quot; the normal acuity of 6/6.

At exactly 6 metres&#x27; distance from the patient, the letters on the 6/6 line shall subtend 5 minutes of arc (such that the individual limbs of the letters subtend 1 minute of arc), which means that the chart should be sized such that these letters are 8.73 mm tall and the topmost (6/60) &quot;E&quot; should be 87.3 mm tall. Putting it another way, the eye should be at a distance 68.76 times the height of the top (6/60) letter. The formula is

formula_1

where formula_2 is the optotype height or width (which are the same due to the optotype being on a square grid), formula_3 is the distance from eye to chart, and formula_4 is the angle subtended by the optotype, which is 5 arcminutes as specified by Snellen. Another calculation for United States clinics using 20-foot chart distances (slightly more than 6 m), and using a 17 mm model eye for calculations, and a letter which subtends 5 minutes of arc, gives a vertical height of the 20/20 letter to be 8.75 mm.

Acuity charts are used during many kinds of vision examinations, such as &quot;refracting&quot; the eye to determine the best eyeglass prescription.

The largest letter on an eye chart often represents an acuity of 6/60 (20/200), the value that is considered &quot;legally blind&quot; in the US. Many individuals with high myopia cannot read the large E without glasses, but can read the 6/6 (20/20) line or 6/4.5 (20/15) line with glasses. By contrast, legally blind individuals have a visual acuity of 6/60 (20/200) or less when using the best corrective lens.

== Electronic chart ==
To ensure adequate illumination of the Snellen charts, various medical device manufacturers had developed Snellen chart products with backlight or projection.

== Digital chart ==
Since computer monitors typically have good lighting for reading and LCD/LED monitors have high DPI (between 96 and 480) they are suitable for displaying optotypes. Commonly digital chart products support randomizing optotypes displayed to prevent patients from memorizing lines they have previously read. In Google Play and App Store (iOS), there are Snellen chart apps for smart phones and tablets.

<text>Gastroptosis is the abnormal downward dislocation (ptosis) of the stomach in which its greater curve is displaced below the iliac crest. It is not a life-threatening condition.

The condition frequently causes digestive symptoms, epigastric pain, constipation, decreased appetite, and sometimes even gastric emptying disorders. It is much more prominent in women than men, and is diagnosed with x-ray using barium contrast. Gastroptosis is mainly caused by the relaxation of surrounding ligaments and mesenteries as a result of the weight of the stomach.

<text>In semiconductor manufacturing, silicon on insulator (SOI) technology is fabrication of silicon semiconductor devices in a layered silicon–insulator–silicon substrate, to reduce parasitic capacitance within the device, thereby improving performance. SOI-based devices differ from conventional silicon-built devices in that the silicon junction is above an electrical insulator, typically silicon dioxide or sapphire (these types of devices are called silicon on sapphire, or SOS). The choice of insulator depends largely on intended application, with sapphire being used for high-performance radio frequency (RF) and radiation-sensitive applications, and silicon dioxide for diminished short-channel effects in other microelectronics devices. The insulating layer and topmost silicon layer also vary widely with application.

==Industry need==
SOI technology is one of several manufacturing strategies to allow the continued miniaturization of microelectronic devices, colloquially referred to as &quot;extending Moore&#x27;s Law&quot; (or &quot;More Moore&quot;, abbreviated &quot;MM&quot;). Reported benefits of SOI relative to conventional silicon (bulk CMOS) processing include:
*Lower parasitic capacitance due to isolation from the bulk silicon, which improves power consumption at matched performance
*Resistance to latchup due to complete isolation of the n- and p-well structures
*Higher performance at equivalent VDD. Can work at low VDDs
*Reduced temperature dependency due to no doping
*Better yield due to high density, better wafer utilization
*Reduced antenna issues
*No body or well taps are needed
*Lower leakage currents due to isolation thus higher power efficiency
*Inherently radiation hardened (resistant to soft errors), reducing the need for redundancy

From a manufacturing perspective, SOI substrates are compatible with most conventional fabrication processes. In general, an SOI-based process may be implemented without special equipment or significant retooling of an existing factory. Among challenges unique to SOI are novel metrology requirements to account for the buried oxide layer and concerns about differential stress in the topmost silicon layer. The threshold voltage of the transistor depends on the history of operation and applied voltage to it, thus making modeling harder.
The primary barrier to SOI implementation is the drastic increase in substrate cost, which contributes an estimated 10–15% increase to total manufacturing costs. FD-SOI (Fully Depleted Silicon On Insulator) has been seen as a potential low cost alternative to FinFETs.

==SOI transistors==

An SOI MOSFET is a metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) device in which a semiconductor layer such as silicon or germanium is formed on an insulator layer which may be a buried oxide (BOX) layer formed in a semiconductor substrate. SOI MOSFET devices are adapted for use by the computer industry. The buried oxide layer can be used in SRAM designs. There are two types of SOI devices: PDSOI (partially depleted SOI) and FDSOI (fully depleted SOI) MOSFETs. For an n-type PDSOI MOSFET the sandwiched n-type film between the gate oxide (GOX) and buried oxide (BOX) is large, so the depletion region can&#x27;t cover the whole n region. So to some extent PDSOI behaves like bulk MOSFET. Obviously there are some advantages over the bulk MOSFETs. The film is very thin in FDSOI devices so that the depletion region covers the whole channel region. In FDSOI the front gate (GOX) supports fewer depletion charges than the bulk so an increase in inversion charges occurs resulting in higher switching speeds. The limitation of the depletion charge by the BOX induces a suppression of the depletion capacitance and therefore a substantial reduction of the subthreshold swing allowing FD SOI MOSFETs to work at lower gate bias resulting in lower power operation. The subthreshold swing can reach the minimum theoretical value for MOSFET at 300K, which is 60mV/decade. This ideal value was first demonstrated using numerical simulation. Other drawbacks in bulk MOSFETs, like threshold voltage roll off, etc. are reduced in FDSOI since the source and drain electric fields can&#x27;t interfere due to the BOX. The main problem in PDSOI is the &quot;floating body effect (FBE)&quot; since the film is not connected to any of the supplies.

==Manufacture of SOI wafers==
-based SOI wafers can be produced by several methods:
*&quot;SIMOX&quot; - Separation by IMplantation of OXygen – uses an oxygen ion beam implantation process followed by high temperature annealing to create a buried layer.
*Wafer bonding – the insulating layer is formed by directly bonding oxidized silicon with a second substrate. The majority of the second substrate is subsequently removed, the remnants forming the topmost Si layer.
**One prominent example of a wafer bonding process is the &quot;Smart Cut&quot; method developed by the French firm Soitec which uses ion implantation followed by controlled exfoliation to determine the thickness of the uppermost silicon layer.
**&quot;NanoCleave&quot; is a technology developed by Silicon Genesis Corporation that separates the silicon via stress at the interface of silicon and silicon-germanium alloy.
**&quot;ELTRAN&quot; is a technology developed by Canon which is based on porous silicon and water cut.
*Seed methods - wherein the topmost Si layer is grown directly on the insulator. Seed methods require some sort of template for homoepitaxy, which may be achieved by chemical treatment of the insulator, an appropriately oriented crystalline insulator, or vias through the insulator from the underlying substrate.

An exhaustive review of these various manufacturing processes may be found in reference

== Use in the microelectronics industry ==
IBM began to use SOI in the high-end RS64-IV &quot;Istar&quot; PowerPC-AS microprocessor in 2000. Other examples of microprocessors built on SOI technology include AMD&#x27;s 130 nm, 90 nm, 65 nm, 45 nm and 32 nm single, dual, quad, six and eight core processors since 2001. Freescale adopted SOI in their PowerPC 7455 CPU in late 2001, currently Freescale is shipping SOI products in 180 nm, 130 nm, 90 nm and 45 nm lines. The 90 nm PowerPC- and Power ISA-based processors used in the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii use SOI technology as well. Competitive offerings from Intel however continue to use conventional bulk CMOS technology for each process node, instead focusing on other venues such as HKMG and tri-gate transistors to improve transistor performance. In January 2005, Intel researchers reported on an experimental single-chip silicon rib waveguide Raman laser built using SOI.

As for the traditional foundries, in July 2006 TSMC claimed no customer wanted SOI, but Chartered Semiconductor devoted a whole fab to SOI.

==Use in high-performance radio frequency (RF) applications==
In 1990, Peregrine Semiconductor began development of an SOI process technology utilizing a standard 0.5 μm CMOS node and an enhanced sapphire substrate. Its patented silicon on sapphire (SOS) process is widely used in high-performance RF applications. The intrinsic benefits of the insulating sapphire substrate allow for high isolation, high linearity and electro-static discharge (ESD) tolerance. Multiple other companies have also applied SOI technology to successful RF applications in smartphones and cellular radios.

==Use in photonics==
SOI wafers are widely used in silicon photonics. The crystalline silicon layer on insulator can be used to fabricate optical waveguides and other optical devices, either passive or active (e.g. through suitable implantations). The buried insulator enables propagation of infrared light in the silicon layer on the basis of total internal reflection. The top surface of the waveguides can be either left uncovered and exposed to air (e.g. for sensing applications), or covered with a cladding, typically made of silica

== Disadvantages ==
The major disadvantage of SOI technology when compared to conventional semiconductor industry is increased cost of manufacturing. As of 2012 only IBM and AMD used SOI as basis for high-performance processors and the other manufacturers (Intel, TSMC, Global Foundries etc.) used conventional silicon wafers to build their CMOS chips.

== SOI market ==
As of 2020 the market utilizing the SOI process was projected to grow up by ~15% for the next 5 years according to Market Research Future group.

<doc id="747303" wikidata="Q7122728" url="?curid=747303" title="Pacific Telesis">
<text>Pacific Telesis Group (PacTel) was one of the seven Regional Bell Operating Companies, sometimes also referred to as &quot;RBOCs&quot; or &quot;Baby Bells&quot;, created in 1983 in preparation of the breakup of AT&amp;T Corporation. Pacific Telesis was the holding company for Pacific Bell, Nevada Bell, Pacific Telesis International, PacTel Mobile Services and PacTel InfoSystems. Pacific Telesis was headquartered in San Francisco and incorporated in Nevada. It was acquired by SBC Communications (the former Southwestern Bell) in 1997, which would eventually become today&#x27;s AT&amp;T Inc.

==Nicknames==
Pacific Telesis is more commonly known as &quot;Pac Bell&quot;. Prior to the January 1, 1984, breakup of the Bell System, the corporate name of its principal subsidiary Pacific Bell was The Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, which had also been referred to as &quot;PacTel.&quot; After the corporate name change, Pacific Bell was commonly known as &quot;PacBell.&quot;

The red and white star trademarked logo was referred to by company employees as the &quot;splat&quot; or more formally as the &quot;access symbol&quot; after the similar star key on a telephone keypad.

==Branded products==
Pacific Telesis licensed rights to its name and the Bell name to Vodavi, who sold consumer telephones under the &quot;PacTel&quot; name. Vodavi manufactured PacTel telephones in South Korea to &quot;Bell Specifications&quot;.

Pacific Telesis later licensed the Pacific Bell name to Thomson Consumer Electronics, who also produced telephone equipment for GE.

==Spinoffs==
The cellular and paging unit of Pacific Telesis, PacTel Cellular, was spun off in 1994 into a new company called AirTouch Communications, leaving Pacific Telesis with only the landline telephone company. Senior Pacific Telesis management moved to AirTouch, thus leaving a new corporate culture to run the old Pacific Telesis. In 1999, AirTouch merged with Britain&#x27;s Vodafone to become Vodafone AirTouch. In 2000, Vodafone&#x27;s U.S. wireless assets were merged with those of Bell Atlantic to form the joint venture Verizon.

Later, when GSM technology became available, Pacific Bell Mobile Services was re-created, debuting in 1996 at the Republican National Convention in San Diego, California and being introduced to the public in 1997. After its public launch, the wireless division was renamed Pacific Bell Wireless and remained as such until the merger with SBC.

==Mergers==
In 1997, Pacific Telesis Group was acquired by SBC Communications, and although the Pacific Telesis Group corporate name disappeared fairly quickly, SBC continued to operate the Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell local telephone companies separately under their original names.

In September 2001, SBC renamed the telephone companies &quot;SBC Pacific Bell&quot; and &quot;SBC Nevada Bell&quot;. In late 2002, the companies were rebranded again as simply &quot;SBC&quot;. Meanwhile, employees of SBC working in California and Nevada who supported SBC&#x27;s non-regulated services and/or services provided both within and outside California were transferred to other SBC subsidiaries, like &quot;Pacific Telesis Shared Services&quot; and &quot;SBC Operations, Inc.&quot; However, for legal and regulatory purposes, employees supporting local regulated services were still employed by &quot;Pacific Bell Telephone Company dba SBC California (&quot;SBC California&quot;)&quot;, and &quot;Nevada Bell dba SBC Nevada&quot;, which were the SBC subsidiaries that provided regulated local telephone services within the franchise territory in California and Nevada.

On November 18, 2005, SBC completed its acquisition of AT&amp;T Corp. to form AT&amp;T Inc. Nevada and Pacific Bells are now known as Pacific Bell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&amp;T California and Nevada Bell Telephone Company d/b/a AT&amp;T Nevada. Pacific Telesis&#x27; companies as a whole business are known as AT&amp;T West.

In 2006, the company was dissolved into AT&amp;T Teleholdings, which is the current name of the former Baby Bell Ameritech.

<text>Donald L. Philippi (October 2, 1930 – January 26, 1993) was a noted translator of Japanese and Ainu, and a musician.

Born in Los Angeles, Philippi studied at the University of Southern California before going to Japan in 1957 on a Fulbright scholarship to study at the Kokugakuin University. In Japan he became an expert in both classical Japanese and Ainu.

Philippi is known for his translation of the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the ancient Shinto prayers known as &quot;norito&quot;. He also published a book of translations of Ainu epic poems (&quot;yukar&quot;), &quot;Songs of Gods, Songs of Humans: The Epic Tradition of the Ainu&quot;, and a book of translations of ancient Japanese poems, &quot;This Wine of Peace, This Wine of Laughter: A Complete Anthology of Japan&#x27;s Earliest Songs&quot;. Philippi was also a noted technical translator.

Under the pseudonym Slava Ranko, Philippi edited and published &quot;Maratto&quot;, a little magazine focused on Ainu literature and culture. The first issue was published March 3, 1977 in San Francisco.

Philippi was also a musician, learning the shamisen and the biwa both in the U.S. and Japan. In the late 1970s, he became familiar in the San Francisco music scene, again using the name Slava Ranko, and performing a combination of biwa and synthesizer music. In 1981, he issued an album, &quot;Arctic Hysteria&quot;.

<doc id="747306" wikidata="Q5486109" url="?curid=747306" title="Frank D. Celebrezze I">
<text>Frank D. Celebrezze I (May 12, 1899 – August 21, 1953) was an Italian-American politician, judge and former public safety director in Cleveland, Ohio.

==Early life==

He was born in 1899 to Dorothy (née Marcogiuseppe) and Rocco Cilibrizzi, Italian immigrants in Cleveland. Celebrezze and some of his family spent part of his childhood in his parents&#x27; home region of Basilicata, in southern Italy. The family name was Americanized in spelling to Celebrezze after they returned to Cleveland in 1912. His brother Anthony J. Celebrezze was then two years old. One of 13 children, Celebrezze graduated from St. Ignatius College in Cleveland. (This was later developed as separate campuses for Saint Ignatius High School in Cleveland and John Carroll University in University Heights, Ohio). He earned a Juris Doctor from University of Notre Dame on February 23, 1925.

His brother Anthony also became an attorney. He was elected to several terms as mayor of Cleveland, and was appointed to the cabinet of President John F. Kennedy, continuing in office under President Lyndon B. Johnson.

==Professional==

In the 1930s, Celebrezze served the courts as a Cuyahoga County assistant prosecutor. In 1942, Celebrezze replaced Eliot Ness as city safety director, serving under Cleveland mayors Frank Lausche and Thomas A. Burke. He was elected as a municipal judge in 1947 and reelected in 1951, serving until his death in 1953.

==Personal==

Celebrezze married Mary Carmella Delsander, with whom he had six children: Frank D. Celebrezze, Jr., Gerald, Dorothy, Joanne, Monica, and James. Frank Jr. became an attorney and was elected to the Supreme Court of Ohio, where he advanced to serve as Chief Justice. Celebrezze is interred in in Brook Park, on Cleveland&#x27;s West Side.

<text>Terrence O&#x27;Donnell (born February 11, 1946) is a former associate justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio.

==Education==
He graduated in 1964 from St. Edward High School, an all-boys Catholic high school on Cleveland&#x27;s west side. He did his undergraduate studies at Kent State University, graduating with a degree in political science in 1968. He earned his Juris Doctor at the Cleveland State University College of Law in 1971.

He later clerked for Ohio Supreme Court Justice J.J.P. Corrigan in 1971 and then clerked for Judge John V. Corrigan and Judge John M. Manos on the 8th District Court of Appeals in Cuyahoga County, where he later returned as an appellate judge.

==Career==
Justice Terrence O&#x27;Donnell joined the Supreme Court of Ohio in 2003 as its 149th justice. During his tenure on the Court, he led statewide efforts to increase professionalism among lawyers and judges across Ohio, culminating in the implementation of a Lawyer to Lawyer Mentoring Program that is recognized nationally as one of the finest in the United States.

Justice O&#x27;Donnell began his judicial career in 1980 on the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court—the busiest trial court in Ohio—and served there for 14 years until his election to the Eighth District Court of Appeals in 1994. He served there for eight years, and subsequently served as a visiting trial court judge in various counties throughout the state before joining the Supreme Court in 2003.

He began his legal career at the Ohio Supreme Court as a law clerk to Justice J.J.P. Corrigan in 1971, and then clerked for Judges John V. Corrigan and John M. Manos on the Eighth District Court of Appeals. Before beginning his judicial service, he practiced law with the firm of Marshman, Snyder &amp; Corrigan in Cleveland for six years.

A former school teacher, Justice O&#x27;Donnell was a founding member and past president of the Legal Eagles — a law fraternity for alumni of St. Edward High School in Lakewood, and a frequent lecturer at its year-end seminar. He also was a member of the Ohio State Bar Foundation Fellows Class of 2005, past member of the board of trustees of Magnificat High School, and the board of trustees of the Lawyers Guild of the Diocese of Cleveland.

Justice O&#x27;Donnell also served as chairman of the Ohio Legal Rights Service Commission, which oversees the protection and advocacy of the developmentally disabled and mentally ill statewide. He was a past member of the board of trustees of Our Lady of the Wayside, a nonprofit organization dedicated to serving the needs of the mentally and physically challenged where his brother, John, lived for 10 years until he died in 2011.

Justice O&#x27;Donnell was honored by every school and university he attended: St. Edward High School presented him with its Alumnus of the Year Award in 2005, Kent State University recognized him as an outstanding graduate of the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, and Cleveland State University awarded him its Distinguished Alumni Award. In addition, the University of Akron School of Law conferred an honorary doctor of law degree when he presented the commencement address in 2005. He was named Person of the Year by the Mayo Society of Greater Cleveland in 2015, was the 2006 recipient of the Jurisprudence Award from the American ORT Cleveland Chapter, and he became a member of the 2011 Irish Legal 100, a group of prominent Irish lawyers and judges selected from across the United States.

Justice O&#x27;Donnell resides in Rocky River with his wife, Mary Beth. The couple has four adult children—Terrence, Michael, Colleen, and Nora, and eight grandchildren, Terrence, Charlie, Claire, Emmett, Kevin, Molly, Maggie, and Andrew.

Justice O’Donnell&#x27;s term on the Supreme Court ended on Dec. 31, 2018, due to Ohio&#x27;s mandatory age limits for judges.

<text>US West, Inc. was one of seven Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs, also referred to as &quot;Baby Bells&quot;), created in 1983 under the Modification of Final Judgement (&quot;United States v. Western Electric Co., Inc.&quot; 552 Fed. Supp. 131), a case related to the antitrust breakup of AT&amp;T. US West provided local telephone and intraLATA long-distance services, data transmission services, cable television services, wireless communications services and related telecommunications products to defined areas in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. US West was a public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &quot;USW&quot; with headquarters at 1801 California Street in Denver, Colorado.

Until 1990, US West was a holding company with three Bell Operating Companies: Mountain States Telephone &amp; Telegraph (or Mountain Bell, headquartered in Denver, Colorado); Northwestern Bell, then headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska; and Pacific Northwest Bell, then headquartered in Seattle, Washington. In 1988, the three companies began doing business under the US West Communications name. On January 1, 1991, Northwestern Bell and Pacific Northwest Bell were legally merged into Mountain Bell which was renamed US West Communications, Inc. US West was the first RBOC to consolidate its Bell Operating Companies (the other was BellSouth). Northwestern Bell and Pacific Northwest Bell were not officially defunct, however, until mid-to-late 1994.

In 1998, US West split into two separate companies. Its telephone properties maintained the US West name, while the remaining assets such as cable, wireless and international businesses became MediaOne. The split was structured so that MediaOne Inc. was the legal successor to US West Inc., and US West was the spin-off entity.

US West merged with Qwest on June 30, 2000, and over time the US West brand was replaced by the Qwest brand. Qwest merged with CenturyLink on April 1, 2011, and the Qwest brand was replaced by the CenturyLink brand.

== Accomplishments ==
US West became a pioneer in the introduction and rapid system-wide implementation of telephone technologies designed by Bellcore (now iconectiv) in the 1980s and 1990s. Their lead in this push became one that many other Regional Bell Operating Companies had to scramble to keep up with.

US West&#x27;s success in this endeavor was for multiple reasons which included their then-innovative use of &quot;test-markets&quot; for staggered roll-outs of new calling features in middle-sized cities such as Boise, Idaho; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Phoenix, Arizona before releasing them on a wider scale (they were the first communications provider to use this strategy called beta-testing, a term used for many years in the software development industry). Their geographic presence featured telephone switching equipment that had been constructed fairly recent to the time frame, thereby requiring fewer upgrades. Their service area was also experiencing population growth at a tremendous rate, tripling their subscriber-base in a short time and increasing revenues.

US West also had ownership in the cable industry with its 1994 purchase of Atlanta-based Wometco and GTC cable operations and the subsequent purchase of Continental Cablevision, creating MediaOne Group Inc. MediaOne, along with several ancillary businesses, was spun off as a separate company in 1998 from the traditional phone operations to form MediaOne Group. US West also participated in a joint venture agreement with Time Warner Cable to form Time Warner Communications (later known as TW Telecom) in 1993- it also purchased a 26% stake in Time Warner Entertainment&#x27;s entertainment operations including Warner Bros. and HBO, which was passed to MediaOne, AT&amp;T, and finally Comcast. Comcast sold the stake back to Time Warner Inc. in 2003.

US West Communications was the first local telephone company to offer Caller ID service in 1991, nearly four years before any other local telco could do so. They were the first U.S. telco to upgrade their PSTN to electronic switching before 1990 and they were the first to offer residential and business ISDN and later, DSL services to their customers by 1997.

As a result of its rapid &quot;bring-to-market&quot; abilities and continued success in technological advancements, the company adopted the slogan &quot;Life&#x27;s better here.&quot; developed by ad agency NW Ayer.

US West was one of the first companies in the United States to officially recognize and support its gay and lesbian employees. The Eagles, an employee resource group for gay and lesbian US West employees, was recognized in 1989. It had chapters in seven US states by 1990.

== Criticisms ==

US West was accused by critics of failing to meet service needs within a reasonable time frame and of practicing predatory billing and collection methods. While the company often claimed that subscriber demands were often greater than their ability to fulfill orders, many critics pointed to high profit margins, spending on bring-to-market technology and lackluster investment in customer support.

US West went through a period of union-management relations that bordered on positive during the early 1990s. After a failed re-engineering strategy, relations fell apart due to increasing hostility between company leaders and employees. An often-used nickname for the company was &quot;US Worst.&quot; When the company rolled out its new slogan – &quot;Life&#x27;s better here&quot; – employees began wearing buttons and shirts that stated that &quot;Life&#x27;s Bitter Here&quot;.

The company was fined multiple times by the State of Oregon for these practices during the 1990s. US West was also, at several times, involved in smaller litigation with other states within its service area for similar complaints from customers.

Qwest, MCI, and smaller competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) who had recently been allowed to offer local service within US West&#x27;s service area (as a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996) complained to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that US West was uncooperative in releasing their owned lines to these new companies. These types of complaints landed US West in court yet again, offering the complex question of whether or not the government could legally offer the sale of owned property to other companies in the event of deregulation.

== Merger with Qwest ==

In 1996, reports appearing in &quot;The Denver Post&quot; and the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; revealed that CLECs had lodged complaints with the FCC against US West, including multiple complaints from Qwest Communications International, Inc. The complaints alleged US West neglected or seriously delayed release of &quot;bundled loops&quot; as required by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, making it difficult for competitors to provide local telephone service to their customers. Other competitors began following suit, and charged US West with monopoly-like or anti-trust type behavior.

During the winter of 1999–2000, US West announced that it had received an unsolicited purchase offer from Qwest Communications International, Inc. At the time, US West had been attempting to merge with Global Crossing, because the offer from Qwest was for a higher value, the US West Board accepted it.

On June 30, 2000, US West, Inc. and Qwest Communications International, Inc. combined via merger. Qwest Communications International, Inc. was merged into US West and renamed Qwest with all of US West&#x27;s direct subsidiaries becoming direct subsidiaries of Qwest.

After the merger, the Bell Operating Company subsidiary was renamed from US West Communications, Inc. to Qwest Corporation and other subsidiaries were similarly renamed to reflect the Qwest name.

After Qwest was acquired by CenturyLink in 2011, the Qwest brand was replaced by the CenturyLink brand. Subsidiaries, with the exception of Qwest Management Company (founded as US West Investment Management Company), which became CenturyLink Investment Management Company, retained the Qwest name and adopted d/b/a names.

<doc id="747325" wikidata="Q5446421" url="?curid=747325" title="Fibre Channel zoning">
<text>In storage networking, Fibre Channel zoning is the partitioning of a Fibre Channel fabric into smaller subsets to restrict interference, add security, and to simplify management. While a SAN makes available several devices and/or ports to a single device, each system connected to the SAN should only be allowed access to a controlled subset of these devices/ports. Zoning applies only to the switched fabric topology (FC-SW), it does not exist in simpler Fibre Channel topologies.

Zoning is different from VSANs, in that each port can be a member of multiple zones, but only one VSAN. VSAN (similarly to VLAN) is in fact a separate network (separate sub-fabric), with its own fabric services (including its own separate zoning).

==Zoning types==
There are two main methods of zoning, the two methods being hard and soft, that combine with two sets of attributes, name and port. More recently, the differences between the 2 have blurred. All modern SAN switches then enforce soft zoning in hardware.

===Soft and hard zoning===
The fabric name service allows each device to query the addresses of all other devices. Soft zoning restricts only the fabric name service, to show only an allowed subset of devices. Therefore, when a server looks at the content of the fabric, it will only see the devices it is allowed to see. However, any server can still attempt to contact any device on the network by address. In this way, soft zoning is similar to the computing concept of security through obscurity.

In contrast, hard zoning restricts actual communication across a fabric. This requires efficient hardware implementation (frame filtering) in the fabric switches, but is much more secure. That stated, modern switches will employ hard zoning when you implement soft.

===Port and WWN zoning===
Zoning can be applied to either the switch port a device is connected to OR the WWN World Wide Name on the host being connected. As port based zoning restricts traffic flow based on the specific switch port a device is connected to, if the device is moved, it will lose access. Furthermore, if a different device is connected to the port in question, it will gain access to any resources the previous host had access to. WWN zoning (also called &quot;name zoning&quot;) restricts access by a device&#x27;s WWN. As the WWN is on the host, the port the host is connected to can be moved and access is still preserved. Connecting a new device into a port previously used by a WWN zone device will not convey any access to the previous device&#x27;s resources.

==Use==
In order to bring the created zones together for ease of deployment and management a &quot;zoneset&quot; is employed (also called &quot;zoning config&quot;). A zoneset is merely a logical container for the individual zones, that are designed to work at the same time. A zoneset can contain WWN zones, port zones, or a combination of both (&quot;hybrid zones&quot;). The zoneset must be activated within the fabric (i.e. distributed through all the switches and then simultaneously enforced). Switches may contain more than one zoneset, but only one zoneset can be active in the entire fabric.

<doc id="747328" wikidata="Q2000285" url="?curid=747328" title="Proxy (climate)">
<text>In the study of past climates (&quot;paleoclimatology&quot;), climate proxies are preserved physical characteristics of the past that stand in for direct meteorological measurements and enable scientists to reconstruct the climatic conditions over a longer fraction of the Earth&#x27;s history. Reliable global records of climate only began in the 1880s, and proxies provide the only means for scientists to determine climatic patterns before record-keeping began.

A large number of climate proxies have been studied from a variety of geologic contexts. Examples of proxies include stable isotope measurements from ice cores, growth rates in tree rings, species composition of sub-fossil pollen in lake sediment or foraminifera in ocean sediments, temperature profiles of boreholes, and stable isotopes and mineralogy of corals and carbonate speleothems. In each case, the proxy indicator has been influenced by a particular seasonal climate parameter (e.g., summer temperature or monsoon intensity) at the time in which they were laid down or grew. Interpretation of climate proxies requires a range of ancillary studies, including calibration of the sensitivity of the proxy to climate and cross-verification among proxy indicators.

Proxies can be combined to produce temperature reconstructions longer than the instrumental temperature record and can inform discussions of global warming and climate history. The geographic distribution of proxy records, just like the instrumental record, is not at all uniform, with more records in the northern hemisphere.

==Proxies==

In science, it is sometimes necessary to study a variable which cannot be measured directly. This can be done by &quot;proxy methods,&quot; in which a variable which correlates with the variable of interest is measured, and then used to infer the value of the variable of interest. Proxy methods are of particular use in the study of the past climate, beyond times when direct measurements of temperatures are available.

Most proxy records have to be calibrated against independent temperature measurements, or against a more directly calibrated proxy, during their period of overlap to estimate the relationship between temperature and the proxy. The longer history of the proxy is then used to reconstruct temperature from earlier periods.

=== Ice cores ===

====Drilling====

 Ice cores are cylindrical samples from within ice sheets in the Greenland, Antarctic, and North American regions. First attempts of extraction occurred in 1956 as part of the International Geophysical Year. As original means of extraction, the U.S. Army&#x27;s Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory used an -long modified electrodrill in 1968 at Camp Century, Greenland, and Byrd Station, Antarctica. Their machinery could drill through of ice in 40–50 minutes. From 1300 to in depth, core samples were in diameter and 10 to long. Deeper samples of 15 to long were not uncommon. Every subsequent drilling team improves their method with each new effort.

====Proxy====

The ratio between the 16O and 18O water molecule isotopologues in an ice core helps determine past temperatures and snow accumulations. The heavier isotope (18O) condenses more readily as temperatures decrease and falls more easily as precipitation, while the lighter isotope (16O) needs colder conditions to precipitate. The farther north one needs to go to find elevated levels of the 18O isotopologue, the warmer the period.

In addition to oxygen isotopes, water contains hydrogen isotopes – 1H and 2H, usually referred to as H and D (for deuterium) – that are also used for temperature proxies. Normally, ice cores from Greenland are analyzed for δ18O and those from Antarctica for δ-deuterium. Those cores that analyze for both show a lack of agreement. (In the figure, δ18O is for the trapped air, not the ice. δD is for the ice.)

Air bubbles in the ice, which contain trapped greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, are also helpful in determining past climate changes.

From 1989 to 1992, the European Greenland Ice Core Drilling Project drilled in central Greenland at coordinates 72° 35&#x27; N, 37° 38&#x27; W. The ices in that core were 3840 years old at a depth of 770 m, 40,000 years old at 2521 m, and 200,000 years old or more at 3029 m bedrock. Ice cores in Antarctica can reveal the climate records for the past 650,000 years.

Location maps and a complete list of U.S. ice core drilling sites can be found on the website for the National Ice Core Laboratory.

===Tree rings===

Dendroclimatology is the science of determining past climates from trees, primarily from properties of the annual tree rings. Tree rings are wider when conditions favor growth, narrower when times are difficult. Two primary factors are temperature and humidity / water availability. Other properties of the annual rings, such as maximum latewood density (MXD) have been shown to be better proxies than simple ring width. Using tree rings, scientists have estimated many local climates for hundreds to thousands of years previous. By combining multiple tree-ring studies (sometimes with other climate proxy records), scientists have estimated past regional and global climates (see Temperature record of the past 1000 years).

===Fossil leaves===
Paleoclimatologists often use leaf teeth to reconstruct mean annual temperature in past climates, and they use leaf size as a proxy for mean annual precipitation. In the case of mean annual precipitation reconstructions, some researchers believe taphonomic processes cause smaller leaves to be overrepresented in the fossil record, which can bias reconstructions. However, recent research suggests that the leaf fossil record may not be significantly biased toward small leaves. New approaches retrieve data such as content of past atmospheres from fossil leaf stomata and isotope composition, measuring cellular CO2 concentrations. A 2014 study was able to use the carbon-13 isotope ratios to estimate the CO2 amounts of the past 400 million years, the findings hint at a higher climate sensitivity to CO2 concentrations.

===Boreholes===

Borehole temperatures are used as temperature proxies. Since heat transfer through the ground is slow, temperature measurements at a series of different depths down the borehole, adjusted for the effect of rising heat from inside the Earth, can be &quot;inverted&quot; (a mathematical formula to solve matrix equations) to produce a non-unique series of surface temperature values. The solution is &quot;non-unique&quot; because there are multiple possible surface temperature reconstructions that can produce the same borehole temperature profile. In addition, due to physical limitations, the reconstructions are inevitably &quot;smeared&quot;, and become more smeared further back in time. When reconstructing temperatures around 1500 AD, boreholes have a temporal resolution of a few centuries. At the start of the 20th century, their resolution is a few decades; hence they do not provide a useful check on the instrumental temperature record. However, they are broadly comparable. These confirmations have given paleoclimatologists the confidence that they can measure the temperature of 500 years ago. This is concluded by a depth scale of about to measure the temperatures from 100 years ago and to measure the temperatures from 1,000 years ago.

Boreholes have a great advantage over many other proxies in that no calibration is required: they are actual temperatures. However, they record surface temperature not the near-surface temperature (1.5 meter) used for most &quot;surface&quot; weather observations. These can differ substantially under extreme conditions or when there is surface snow. In practice the effect on borehole temperature is believed to be generally small. A second source of error is contamination of the well by groundwater may affect the temperatures, since the water &quot;carries&quot; more modern temperatures with it. This effect is believed to be generally small, and more applicable at very humid sites. It does not apply in ice cores where the site remains frozen all year.

More than 600 boreholes, on all continents, have been used as proxies for reconstructing surface temperatures. The highest concentration of boreholes exist in North America and Europe. Their depths of drilling typically range from 200 to greater than 1,000 meters into the crust of the Earth or ice sheet.

A small number of boreholes have been drilled in the ice sheets; the purity of the ice there permits longer reconstructions. Central Greenland borehole temperatures show &quot;a warming over the last 150 years of approximately 1°C ± 0.2°C preceded by a few centuries of cool conditions. Preceding this was a warm period centered around A.D. 1000, which was warmer than the late 20th century by approximately 1°C.&quot; A borehole in the Antarctica icecap shows that the &quot;temperature at A.D. 1 [was] approximately 1°C warmer than the late 20th century&quot;.

Borehole temperatures in Greenland were responsible for an important revision to the isotopic temperature reconstruction, revealing that the former assumption that &quot;spatial slope equals temporal slope&quot; was incorrect.

===Corals===

Ocean coral skeletal rings, or bands, also share paleoclimatological information, similarly to tree rings. In 2002, a report was published on the findings of Drs. Lisa Greer and Peter Swart, associates of University of Miami at the time, in regard to stable oxygen isotopes in the calcium carbonate of coral. Cooler temperatures tend to cause coral to use heavier isotopes in its structure, while warmer temperatures result in more normal oxygen isotopes being built into the coral structure. Denser water salinity also tends to contain the heavier isotope. Greer&#x27;s coral sample from the Atlantic Ocean was taken in 1994 and dated back to 1935. Greer recalls her conclusions, &quot;When we look at the averaged annual data from 1935 to about 1994, we see it has the shape of a sine wave. It is periodic and has a significant pattern of oxygen isotope composition that has a peak at about every twelve to fifteen years.&quot; Surface water temperatures have coincided by also peaking every twelve and a half years. However, since recording this temperature has only been practiced for the last fifty years, correlation between recorded water temperature and coral structure can only be drawn so far back.

===Pollen grains===
Pollen can be found in sediments. Plants produce pollen in large quantities and it is extremely resistant to decay. It is possible to identify a plant species from its pollen grain. The identified plant community of the area at the relative time from that sediment layer, will provide information about the climatic condition. The abundance of pollen of a given vegetation period or year depends partly on the weather conditions of the previous months, hence pollen density provides information on short-term climatic conditions. The study of prehistoric pollen is palynology.

===Dinoflagellate cysts===

Dinoflagellates occur in most aquatic environments and during their life cycle, some species produce highly resistant organic-walled cysts for a dormancy period when environmental conditions are not appropriate for growth. Their living depth is relatively shallow (dependent upon light penetration), and closely coupled to diatoms on which they feed. Their distribution patterns in surface waters are closely related to physical characteristics of the water bodies, and nearshore assemblages can also be distinguished from oceanic assemblages. The distribution of dinocysts in sediments has been relatively well documented and has contributed to understanding the average sea-surface conditions that determine the distribution pattern and abundances of the taxa (). Several studies, including and have compiled box and gravity cores in the North Pacific analyzing them for palynological content to determine the distribution of dinocysts and their relationships with sea surface temperature, salinity, productivity and upwelling. Similarly, and use a box core at 576.5 m of water depth from 1992 in the central Santa Barbara Basin to determine oceanographic and climatic changes during the past 40 kyr in the area.

===Lake and ocean sediments===

Similar to their study on other proxies, paleoclimatologists examine oxygen isotopes in the contents of ocean sediments. Likewise, they measure the layers of varve (deposited fine and coarse silt or clay) laminating lake sediments. Lake varves are primarily influenced by:

* Summer temperature, which shows the energy available to melt seasonal snow and ice
* Winter snowfall, which determines the level of disturbance to sediments when melting occurs
* Rainfall

Diatoms, foraminifera, radiolarians, ostracods, and coccolithophores are examples of biotic proxies for lake and ocean conditions that are commonly used to reconstruct past climates. The distribution of the species of these and other aquatic creatures preserved in the sediments are useful proxies. The optimal conditions for species preserved in the sediment act as clues. Researchers use these clues to reveal what the climate and environment was like when the creatures died. The oxygen isotope ratios in their shells can also be used as proxies for temperature.

===Water isotopes and temperature reconstruction===

Ocean water is mostly H216O, with small amounts of HD16O and H218O, where D denotes deuterium, i.e. hydrogen with an extra neutron. In Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) the ratio of D to H is 155.76x10−6 and O-18 to O-16 is 2005.2x10−6. Isotope fractionation occurs during changes between condensed and vapour phases: the vapour pressure of heavier isotopes is lower, so vapour contains relatively more of the lighter isotopes and when the vapour condenses the precipitation preferentially contains heavier isotopes. The difference from VSMOW is expressed as δ18O = 1000‰ formula_1; and a similar formula for δD. δ values for precipitation are always negative. The major influence on δ is the difference between ocean temperatures where the moisture evaporated and the place where the final precipitation occurred; since ocean temperatures are relatively stable the δ value mostly reflects the temperature where precipitation occurs. Taking into account that the precipitation forms above the inversion layer, we are left with a linear relation:

δ 18O = aT + b

This is empirically calibrated from measurements of temperature and δ as a = 0.67 ‰/°C for Greenland and 0.76 ‰/°C for East Antarctica. The calibration was initially done on the basis of &quot;spatial&quot; variations in temperature and it was assumed that this corresponded to &quot;temporal&quot; variations. More recently, borehole thermometry has shown that for glacial-interglacial variations, a = 0.33 ‰/°C, implying that glacial-interglacial temperature changes were twice as large as previously believed.

A study published in 2017 called the previous methodology to reconstruct paleo ocean temperatures 100 million years ago into question, suggesting it has been relatively stable during that time, much colder.

===Membrane lipids===
A novel climate proxy obtained from peat (lignites, ancient peat) and soils, membrane lipids known as glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) is helping to study paleo environmental factors, which control relative distribution of differently branched GDGT isomers. The study authors note, &quot;These branched membrane lipids are produced by an as yet unknown group of anaerobic soil bacteria.&quot; , there is a decade of research demonstrating that in mineral soils the degree of methylation of bacteria (brGDGTs), helps to calculate mean annual air temperatures. This proxy method was used to study the climate of the early Palaeogene, at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, and researchers found that annual air temperatures, over land and at mid-latitude, averaged about 23–29 °C (± 4.7 °C), which is 5–10 °C higher than most previous findings.

===Pseudoproxies===

The skill of algorithms used to combine proxy records into an overall hemispheric temperature reconstruction may be tested using a technique known as &quot;pseudoproxies&quot;. In this method, output from a climate model is sampled at locations corresponding to the known proxy network, and the temperature record produced is compared to the (known) overall temperature of the model.

<text>Mercury-Scout 1, or MS-1, was a United States spacecraft intended to test tracking stations for Project Mercury flights. It grew out of a May 5, 1961 NASA proposal to use Scout rockets to launch small satellites to evaluate the worldwide Mercury Tracking Network in preparation for crewed orbital missions. The launch of Mercury-Scout 1 on November 1, 1961, was unsuccessful, and the satellite failed to reach orbit.

== Background ==

The Mercury Tracking Network was a series of U.S.-owned and operated ground stations and tracking ships, positioned around the world under the flightpath of Mercury spacecraft. When the spacecraft came within several hundred miles of a ground station, it could have line-of-sight voice and telemetry communications by HF (shortwave), VHF or UHF radio and C-band and S-band radar. These communications passes would only last a few minutes, until the ground station disappeared over the horizon. Between ground stations, Mercury spacecraft were out of communications, except for an occasional unreliable HF message. In the early 1960s there were no synchronous communications satellites. The ground stations were linked back to NASA&#x27;s Mercury Control in Florida through land lines, undersea cables and in some cases HF radio.

The concept was approved on May 24. On June 13 the NASA Space Task Group issued requirements for a modified Scout rocket and small communications satellite that became known as Mercury-Scout. The satellite would simulate a Mercury spacecraft, allowing testing of and training with the Mercury Tracking Network.

== Satellite ==
The 67.5 kg MS-1 communications satellite was shaped like a small rectangular box. Within the box, electronics consisted of two command receivers, two minitrack beacons, two telemetry transmitters, an S- and C-band beacon, and antennas; all powered by a 1500 watt-hour battery.
Also attached was the fourth stage instrument package. The battery could power the electronics for 18½ hours before running down. To extend the satellite life, the equipment would be powered off by a ground command after the first three orbits (5 hours). During power-down, data results would be analyzed. The satellite would then be powered up for another three orbits (5 more hours). This process would then be repeated a third time. Mercury planners thought that by shutting down and powering up the satellite, the Mercury Tracking Network would get data and experience from the equivalent of three Mercury orbital missions.

== Mission ==
NASA decided to modify a USAF Blue-Scout II, # D-8, for the first Mercury-Scout mission. The U.S. Air Force was already launching Blue Scout rockets from Cape Canaveral and launched this one as well.

Mercury-Scout 1 was readied for launch on October 31 from LC-18B. The prelaunch countdown proceeded normally, but the engine failed to ignite. Pad crews checked out and repaired the ignition circuits and the flight was reattempted the next day. Control started failing only seconds after liftoff and at T+28 seconds, the first stage started to disintegrate. Range Safety issued the destruct command at T+43 seconds. The failure was traced to a technician who had accidentally transposed two wiring connectors in the guidance system, causing pitch errors to be interpreted as yaw errors and vice versa.

NASA canceled further Mercury-Scout missions. By the time Mercury-Scout 1 was launched, the MA-4 mission had already orbited. MA-5 followed MS-1 by 28 days. MA-4 and MA-5 checked out the Mercury Tracking Network making further Mercury-Scout missions unnecessary.

<doc id="747331" wikidata="Q18636218" url="?curid=747331" title="Limnognathia">
<text>Limnognathia is a genus of microscopic acoelomate freshwater animal that was discovered in Disko Island, Greenland, in 1994. Since then, it has also been found on the Crozet Islands of Antarctica as well as in the British Isles and the Spanish Pyrenees, suggesting a worldwide distribution. There are two known species of &quot;Limnognathia&quot;: &quot;L. maerski&quot;, described in 2000, and &quot;L. desmeti&quot;, described in 2025. 

&quot;Limnognathia&quot; is the only genus in the phylum Micrognathozoa (&quot;small-jawed animal&quot;).

==Description==
===Feeding===
&quot;Limnognathia&quot; mainly feeds on bacteria, blue-green algae, and diatoms. It has very complex jaws, with fifteen separate elements; these elements are very small, ranging from 4 μm to 14 μm. The animal can extend part of its jaw structure outside its mouth while eating. It also extends much of its jaw structure outside its mouth when it is regurgitating indigestible items.

===Anatomy===
&quot;Limnognathia&quot; has a large ganglion, or &#x27;brain&#x27;, in its head, and paired nerve cords extending ventrally (along the lower side of the body) towards the tail. Stiff sensory bristles made up of one to three cilia are scattered about the body. These bristles are similar to ones found on gnathostomulids, but up to three cilia may arise from a single cell in &quot;Limnognathia&quot;, while gnathostomulids never have more than one cilium per cell.

Flexible cilia are arranged in a horseshoe-shaped area on the forehead, and in spots on the sides of the head and in two rows on the underside of the body. The cilia on the forehead create a current that moves food particles towards the mouth. The other cilia move the animal.

===Reproduction===
All specimens of &quot;Limnognathia&quot; that have been collected have had female organs. They lay two kinds of eggs: thin-walled eggs that hatch quickly, and thick-walled eggs that are believed to be resistant to freezing, and thus capable of over-wintering and hatching in the spring. The same pattern is known from rotifers, where thick-walled eggs only form after fertilization by males. The youngest &quot;Limnognathia&quot; specimens collected may also have male organs, and it is now hypothesized that the animals hatch as males and then become females (sequential hermaphroditism).

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
===Taxonomic status===
&quot;Limnognathia&quot; is nominally a platyzoan, but has variously been assigned as a class or subphylum in the clade Gnathifera or as a phylum in a Gnathifera superphylum, named Micrognathozoa. It is related to the rotifers and gnathostomulids, grouped together as the Gnathifera.
Two species are described: &quot;Limnognathia maerski&quot; from Greenland and Spain, and &quot;Limnognathia desmeti&quot; from the Crozet Islands. There are no recognizable morphological differences between the two species, but genetic studies show that they are distinct species. 

===Species===
* &quot;Limnognathia maerski&quot; 
* &quot;Limnognathia desmeti&quot; 

===Phylogeny===

The Gnathifera is the sister group to the rest of the spiralians and is crucial to understand because of its relationship to animal evolution.

<doc id="747334" wikidata="Q2252904" url="?curid=747334" title="Dick Dastardly">
<text>Dick Dastardly is a fictional character and the main protagonist who has appeared in various animated series by Hanna-Barbera Productions from 1968 onward. Dastardly&#x27;s most famous appearances are in the series &quot;Wacky Races&quot; (his initial appearance) and its spin-off, &quot;Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines&quot;. He is partly based on the English actor Terry-Thomas.

The character was originally voiced by Paul Winchell, using a characterization that Winchell would also employ several years later to voice the Smurfs&#x27; nemesis Gargamel. Winchell&#x27;s facial structures were caricatured in the related character design as well. 

In subsequent depictions of the character, Dick Dastardly was voiced by Rob Paulsen and by Jim Cummings (the latter of whom was notable for voicing other characters previously voiced by Winchell, including Tigger and Zummi Gummi).

Dastardly&#x27;s catchphrases in the cartoons were &quot;Muttley, do something!&quot;, &quot;Drat, and double drat!&quot; and occasionally &quot;Triple drat!&quot; or &quot;Curses, foiled again!&quot;

==Appearances==
===&quot;Wacky Races&quot;===

In &quot;Wacky Races&quot;, Dastardly was one of the drivers who competed in each episode for first place, in a long and hazard-filled cross-country road rally. As his name implies, Dastardly aimed to win solely through cheating and trickery. His race car, numbered double-zero and named &quot;The Mean Machine&quot;, featured all sorts of devious traps for him to use against his opponents. As &quot;Wacky Races&quot; was inspired by the film &quot;The Great Race&quot;, so was Dastardly derived from the film&#x27;s chief villain, Professor Fate, played by Jack Lemmon. Dastardly in this series wore old-fashioned racer&#x27;s gear — a long blue in a few series color are same than purple duster overcoat often worn by early motorists, along with long red gloves, a large striped hat with driving goggles attached, and sporting a handlebar mustache.

Dastardly was aided in his schemes by his sidekick, a scruffy anthropomorphic dog named Muttley who had a distinctive wheezy laugh, heard most often when Dastardly&#x27;s schemes failed. Despite Dastardly and Muttley&#x27;s best efforts, the &quot;double-dealing do-badders&quot;, as the opening narration of &quot;Wacky Races&quot; describes them, failed to win a single race. Dastardly came close to winning on several occasions, but always failed, either through his own actions or bad luck, such as posing for his picture as it was a photo finish, stopping to sign an autograph for Muttley, and having Muttley sabotage his own vehicle (Dick told the hound to &quot;stop the winning car&quot;). On one occasion, Dastardly &quot;did&quot; cross the finish line in first place, but was revealed to have extended the nose of his car at the last moment, and was disqualified in favor of Penelope Pitstop; this despite the fact that other characters had pulled similar stunts in the past without punishment (and indeed the original footage showed that Dastardly had &quot;not&quot; extended the nose of his car). In another episode, The Mean Machine accidentally crossed the finish line first, but Dick was &quot;still&quot; disqualified; due to a series of crazy vehicle mix-ups, Dastardly and Muttley were in the wrong car!

It seemed likely that if Dastardly had not bothered to cheat, he might have won many of the races fairly. The Mean Machine was the fastest car on the grid (indeed, in many races, he would take the lead before stopping to set traps for the other drivers), and Dastardly&#x27;s driving ability was often shown to be superior to the other racers. Alas, Dick seemed bound to a code similar to that of wrestler Gorgeous George: &quot;Win if you can, lose if you must, but &quot;always&quot; cheat!&quot; (In fact, in one episode he came close to crossing the finish line first without cheating, but chose not to win and let the other racers finish before him, as he did not want to win fairly.)

===&quot;Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines&quot;===
Dick Dastardly (actually Dick Dastardly Sr.; see below) continued his villainous career in the &quot;Wacky Races&quot; spin-off &quot;Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines&quot;. The series was inspired by the 1965 film &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot; and Dastardly&#x27;s appearance is based on the film&#x27;s villain, Sir Percival Ware-Armitage, played by Terry-Thomas. Dastardly and Muttley flew with two other pilots: Zilly, a coward who would hide in his own clothing when ordered to deploy, and Klunk, the mechanic/inventor, who speaks a language largely composed of strange sounds that only Zilly can understand.

Together, they comprised the &quot;Vulture Squadron&quot;, presumably working for Germany and Central Powers in World War I. The squadron constantly attempted to stop a messenger pigeon, &quot;Yankee Doodle Pigeon&quot;, from delivering messages to an opposing army (seemingly American and/or the Triple Entente), often with the song &quot;Stop the Pigeon&quot; playing. A typical scene shows the Vulture Squadron all converging from different directions on Yankee Doodle Pigeon, only to end up crashing into one another—while the bird remained unharmed. As in &quot;Wacky Races&quot;, Dastardly continued to fail miserably at his mission, only coming near to success on a single occasion. Muttley, despite showing enough competence to win various medals (which Dastardly was constantly threatening to revoke), seemed to delight in Dick&#x27;s failures, displaying his trademark snickering laugh.

===&quot;Yogi&#x27;s Treasure Hunt&quot;===

In later years, Dastardly and Muttley were the for Yogi Bear and his friends in the 1980s series &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Treasure Hunt&quot;. This time, Dick repeatedly failed at discovering hidden treasure before Yogi and his team. It was in this series&#x27; episode &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Heroes&quot; that Dick&#x27;s full name was revealed; as the leader of an island named Dicaragua, he introduced himself as Richard Milhous Dastardly (a play on former U.S. President Richard Milhous Nixon). One episode shows that Dastardly and Muttley are the greediest creatures in the world.

===&quot;Fender Bender 500&quot;===
Dick Dastardly and Muttley were in the &quot;Fender Bender 500&quot; shorts on the early 1990s short-lived series &quot;Wake, Rattle, and Roll&quot;. In those segments, the duo once again appeared in a suped-up version of the Mean Machine as a monster truck called the Dirty Truckster (a pun on the phrase &quot;dirty trickster&quot;), but raced against such Hanna-Barbera stalwarts as Yogi Bear and Quick Draw McGraw. In this series, they were actually able to pull off at least two race wins, one when racing to Russia&#x27;s &#x27;Red Square&#x27; where it was announced that the prize was itself the Red Square. Unfortunately, their prize was simply a piece of red square paper, and not the deed to the Russian capital as the title of &#x27;red square&#x27; would imply. In another Fender Bender race (The &quot;Hit &#x27;n&#x27; Mississippi 500&quot;), he played on Yogi Bear&#x27;s famous catchphrase of being &quot;smarter than the average bear&quot; by claiming to be &quot;smarter than the average cheat&quot;.

===&quot;Yo Yogi!&quot;===
Dick Dastardly (alongside Muttley) appeared as a child (known as Dickie) in the short-lived series &quot;Yo Yogi!&quot;, voiced by Rob Paulsen. In the series he rides a bicycle that resembles the Mean Machine and his clothes resemble his ones from &quot;Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines&quot;. Dick Dastardly would often come up with various plots which would often backfire on him.

===&quot;Wacky Races Forever&quot; (2006)===
The series depicted a roster of both new and returning racers competing against each other. Penelope Pitstop and Peter Perfect had married and created Perfect Industries, the corporate sponsor of the new Wacky Races; their children, Parker and Piper, competed in the race. Dick Dastardly (voiced by Jim Cummings) appears in this and hatches a plan to take them out of the race but has it backfire on himself instead.

===&quot;Wacky Races&quot; (2017)===
In the 2017 reboot of &quot;Wacky Races&quot; it is revealed that the Dick Dastardly who flew in World War I (voiced by Tom Kenny) was the father of the Dick Dastardly (presumably Dick Jr.) of the original &quot;Wacky Races&quot;. In the new version, Dick Jr.&#x27;s son/descendant, Dick Dastardly III, technically wins in the episode &quot;Sister Twister&quot; – winning the &quot;Great Sportsman of the Year&quot; trophy after he made a bet with Peter Perfect that involved him being nice and not cheating for once. He won due to Pandora Pitstop disguising herself as Penelope Pitstop who proceeded to act unsportmans-like and so the judges gave the win to Dastardly – however – to Dastardly&#x27;s horror. He won by due to the sudden shift in his personality, such as saying nicer things to other racers and not cheating. The event also involved race, which Dastardly of course lost, though it had no effect on who won the trophy.

In the episode &quot;Grandfather Knows Dast&quot;, the original Dick Dastardly (World War I flying ace) rides with Dick Dastardly III, and chastises Dick Dastardly III for cheating instead of winning and ultimately causes them to lose the race just as they were about to win.

===&quot;Scoob!&quot;===

Dick Dastardly is the main antagonist in the animated &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; film &quot;Scoob!&quot;, voiced by Jason Isaacs. This version of Dick lacks the hat and goggles he usually wears, and his overcoat is now a dark purple long coat. According to his police report, this version of Dastardly is 6&#x27; 5&quot;, 295lbs. He is also depicted as more of a supervillain than a racer, having robotic minions called Rottens and being an enemy of the Blue Falcon. He operates a giant airship that is loosely based on his racing vehicle, the &quot;Mean Machine&quot;. During a scheme to steal the treasure horde left by Alexander the Great in the Greek underworld by use of a dimensional portal, Dastardly lost Muttley in the underworld when the portal was found to be one way only. He then seeks out the three skulls of Cerberus and Scooby-Doo because as the last descendant of Peritas, Alexander&#x27;s dog, he is the key to opening the gates to the Underworld and reuniting with Muttley; though at the cost of unleashing Cerberus onto the world. After achieving this, Dastardly and Muttley try to escape with treasure, but are captured by the reformed Rottens and taken into custody by Blue Falcon, Dynomutt, and Dee Dee Skyes. During his capture, Dick attempts a double-mask trick by wearing a mask of himself over a mask of Simon Cowell. During the credits, Muttley breaks Dastardly out of prison.

===&quot;Jellystone!&quot;===

Dick Dastardly appeared in the third season of &quot;Jellystone!&quot;, voiced by Dwight Schultz, in his &quot;Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines&quot; outfit. Dick Dastardly is the mayor of New Bedrock.

==Other appearances==
* Universal Studios Florida formerly had a motion simulator ride titled &quot;The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera&quot; which was a tribute to Hanna-Barbera cartoons; Dastardly (voiced by Michael Bell) alongside Muttley kidnap Elroy Jetson, so Yogi and Boo-Boo Bear have to travel across the various worlds of Hanna-Barbera to rescue him. At the end of the ride Dastardly is arrested and sent to a flying jail cell.
* Dick Dastardly, Muttley, and the Mean Machine returned as a boss car in the 2000 &quot;Wacky Races&quot; video game, voiced by Jim Cummings and Billy West. They are the protagonists in the earlier 1991 version.
** A remastered version of the game, called &quot;Wacky Races: Starring Dastardly and Muttley&quot;, is notable for allowing players to have Dick Dastardly finally win a race. If the player wins as him, the narrator is taken aback or disgusted and Dastardly is happy and surprised at winning a race.
* Dick Dastardly made a non-speaking cameo in the &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; episode &quot;Death by Chocolate&quot;.
* In the pilot of &quot;Wacky Races Forever&quot; Dastardly (voiced by Jim Cummings) and Muttley are the main villains, working for the vice-president of Perfect Industries in an attempt to stop the other racers from crossing the finish line. The series was not picked up by the network.
* Dastardly and Muttley were to appear in the series &quot;The Perils of Penelope Pitstop&quot;, where they (especially Dastardly) would have been perfect villains given the tone and the &quot;Perils of Pauline&quot; references, rather they were imagined to be the bodyguards of a younger brother of Penelope. However, this was only in the first sketches of the series, and the two did not appear in the final work. In the first of their encounters, the Hooded Claw did ask Penelope &quot;Who did you expect, Dick Dastardly?&quot; possibly in reference to the above unshot scene.
* Dastardly and Muttley cameo in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Handicar&quot; as participants in the return of &quot;Wacky Races&quot;.
* Dastardly also did an announcement for Cartoon Network, voiced by Jeff Bergman
* Dastardly and Muttley are named in the Madvillain song &quot;Accordion&quot;, from their 2004 album &quot;Madvillainy&quot;. 
* Dastardly makes a cameo in the &quot;Uncle Grandpa&quot; episode &quot;Uncle Grandpa Retires&quot; voiced by Eric Bauza. He and Muttley appear as attendees at the Big Race.
* Dick Dastardly appears as one of the main characters in 2016&#x27;s &quot;Wacky Raceland&quot;. In this version, it is revealed that before the apocalyptic event that ravaged Earth, Dick Dastardly was a world-famous pianist named Richard D&#x27;Astardlien who agreed to enter the race to Earth&#x27;s last known paradise Utopia so that he could have a chance of seeing his wife and son being reborn.
** Another version of Dick Dastardly appeared in &quot;Dastardly &amp; Muttley&quot;, also published by DC Comics under the &quot;Hanna-Barbera Beyond&quot; initiative. This version is Lt. Col. Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Atcherly, a United States Air Force pilot who is sent to shoot down the rogue drone &quot;War Pig One&quot; and is mutated by the mysterious element &quot;unstabilium&quot;, becoming increasingly insane and subject to cartoon physics.
* Dastardly and Muttley appear as contestants in a futuristic car race against Philip J. Fry, in &quot;Futurama Comics&quot; #82.
* A live action version of &quot;Wacky Races&quot; was created for a campaign for Peugeot in 2013 in which Dastardly (played by actor Porter Flynn) and Muttley (puppeteered by Mark Jeffris) race through the city against Penelope Pitstop, Peter Perfect, The Red Max, The Slag Brothers, The Ant Hill Mob, The Gruesome Twosome and Sergeant Blast and Private Meekly.

<text>Malakoff Diggins State Historic Park is a state park unit preserving Malakoff Diggins, the largest hydraulic mining site in California, United States. The mine was one of several hydraulic mining sites at the center of the 1882 landmark case &quot;Woodruff v. North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company.&quot; The mine pit and several Gold Rush-era buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Malakoff Diggins-North Bloomfield Historic District. The &quot;canyon&quot; is long, as much as wide, and nearly deep in places. Visitors can see huge cliffs carved by mighty streams of water, results of the mining technique of washing away entire mountains of gravel to wash out the gold. The park is north-east of Nevada City, California, in the Gold Rush country. The park was established in 1965.

==History==

The Malakoff mine pit on the San Juan Ridge is the impetus for one of the nation&#x27;s first environmental protection measures. 
In 1850 there was little gold left in streams. Miners began to discover gold in old riverbeds and on mountainsides high above the streams. In 1851 three miners headed northeast of what is now Nevada City for a less crowded area to prospect. One miner went back to town with a pocket full of gold nuggets for supplies and was followed back by many prospectors. These followers, however, did not find any gold and declared the area &quot;Humbug&quot;, thus the stream was so named &quot;Humbug Creek&quot;. Around 1852, settlers began to arrive in the area and the town of &quot;Humbug&quot; sprang up. These miners could not decide how to move the dirt to a place where there was water.

By 1853 miners invented a new method of mining called hydraulic mining. Dams were built high in the mountains. The water traveled from the reservoirs through a wooden canal called a flume that was up to long. The water ran swiftly to the canvas hoses and nozzles called monitors waiting in the old riverbeds. The miners would aim the monitors at the hillsides to wash the gravel into huge sluices. Over time the monitors became bigger and more powerful. Their force was so great they could toss a fifty-pound rock like a cannonball or even kill a person. Over 300 Chinese worked on this project and two Chinese settlements existed in North Bloomfield.

By 1857 the town had grown to 500 residents. Locals felt the name &quot;Humbug&quot; was too undignified and renamed the town &quot;Bloomfield&quot;, but California already had a town by this name so they renamed the town &quot;North Bloomfield&quot;.

In the late 1860s the towns of Marysville and Yuba City were buried under of mud and rock, and Sacramento flooded repeatedly. The farmers in the valleys complained about the tailings that flooded their land and ruined their crops. Thousands of acres of rich farmland and property were destroyed as a result of hydraulic mining.

By 1876 the mine was in full operation with 7 giant water cannons working around the clock. The town had grown to a population of around 2000 with various business and daily stage service. In 1880 electric lights were installed in the mine and the world&#x27;s first long-distance telephone line was developed to service the mine, passing through North Bloomfield as it made its way from French Corral to Bowman Lake.

By 1883 San Francisco Bay was estimated to be filling with silt at a rate of one foot per year. Debris, silt, and millions of gallons of water used daily by the mine caused extensive flooding, prompting Sacramento valley farmers to file the lawsuit &quot;Woodruff v. North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company&quot;. On January 7, 1884, Judge Lorenzo Sawyer declared a permanent injunction against dumping mining debris in the rivers.

==Climate==
At an altitude of , Malakoff Diggins generally has warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters. Weather can change rapidly any time of the year. Rain and snow fall usually from October until April, though there may be thunderstorm activity in the summer as well.

==North Bloomfield==
The visitor center has exhibits depicting life in the old mining town of North Bloomfield, with a past population of 1,500 that served as a supply base for the Diggins. About a block of buildings, some dating to the 1850s, are restored or re-created in a Gold Rush style, including white picket fences. One of the buildings is used as park headquarters and there is a museum with old artifacts, and a model showing how hydraulics worked. In summer, park rangers lead tours through a general store, a furnished home, and a drugstore whose shelves are lined with bottles, boxes and vials of medicines. A church, schoolhouse and other buildings are also part of the tour.

Park facilities include hiking trails, picnic area, swimming and fishing, a campground and rustic cabins that can be rented by campers. 
Humbug Days, including a parade and barbecue, is an annual event.

==Hiking and trails==

Visitors to the state historic park can hike on miles of trails. The mining pit is unfenced and accessible from the road and pathways that surround it. Hikers can enter the Hiller Tunnel, through which water for the mining operation once flowed. The park also contains a bedrock tunnel that served as a drain. Other hiking includes:
* &quot;Rim Trail&quot;
* &quot;Diggins Loop Trail&quot;
* &quot;Blair Trail&quot;
* &quot;North Bloomfield Trail&quot;

==Proposed for closure==
Malakoff Diggins was one of 70 California state parks proposed for closure by July 2012 as part of a deficit reduction program. It was previously one of many state parks threatened with closure in 2008. Those closures were ultimately avoided by cutting hours and maintenance system-wide.

<doc id="747342" wikidata="Q3322071" url="?curid=747342" title="Mount Rundle">
<text>Mount Rundle is a mountain in Canada&#x27;s Banff National Park overlooking the towns of Banff and Canmore, Alberta. The Cree name was &quot;Waskahigan Watchi&quot; or house mountain.
In 1858 John Palliser renamed the mountain after Reverend Robert Rundle, a Methodist invited by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to do missionary work in western Canada in the 1840s. He introduced syllabics there—a written language developed for the Cree, as part of his missionary work. He only visited the Stoney-Nakoda of the area around what is now called Mount Rundle in 1844 and 1847.

Mt. Rundle could actually be considered a small mountain range as the mountain extends for over , on the south side of the Trans-Canada Highway eastward from Banff to Canmore with seven distinct peaks along the way. The third peak southeast of Banff is the highest at . West of the Spray Lakes road is the East End of Rundle— locally known as EEOR—which rises above Whiteman&#x27;s Gap just south of Canmore. The Rundle Peaks are part of the South Banff Ranges, along with its siblings—the Sundance Range, Sulphur Mountain and the Goat Range.

== Geology ==

Mount Rundle consists of limestones, dolomitic limestones, dolomites and shales of Paleozoic (Late Devonian to Mississippian) age. In ascending order, they belong to the Palliser, Exshaw and Banff Formations, topped by the Rundle Group, which was named after the mountain.

Mount Rundle illustrates the classic limestone-shale-limestone &quot;sandwich&quot; of the front ranges. The basal &quot;slice of bread&quot; is the lower massive cliffs of tough grey Pallister Formation limestones and dolomites. The &quot;sandwich filling&quot; is the Banff Formation, a layer of softer, more easily eroded, dark brownish-gray to black calcareous shale with thin beds of argillaceous limestone. The top layer of the geologic sandwich is the grey limestones and dolomites of the Rundle Group that form the massive upper cliffs at the top of Mount Rundle. Between the Palliser and the Banff lie the thin, recessive shales of the Exshaw Formation (the &quot;lettuce leaf&quot; of the sandwich), covered with debris from above.

The Paleozoic &quot;sandwich&quot; is part of the Rundle thrust sheet that was moved up from the west along the Rundle thrust fault and emplaced on top of the younger rocks (the Early Cretaceous Mist Mountain Formation) that underlie Canmore and the forested slopes along the Bow River. The thrust faulting occurred during the Columbian Orogeny between late Jurassic and early Cretaceous time. At that time a collision of tectonic plates caused huge sheets of sedimentary rock in what is now British Columbia to become detached and slide eastward to northeastward over their neighbors, piling up to form the southern Canadian Rockies. This left the Paleozoic strata on Mount Rundle dipping steeply to the southwest, so that the southwest-facing side of the mountain forms an extensive dip slope. Geologists consider Mount Rundle to be a classic example of a mountain cut in dipping layered rocks, with the tilted strata giving the mountain its shape.

The most recent stage in the history of Mount Rundle began in the Pleistocene epoch about 2 million years ago with the sculpting and gouging of the Canadian Rockies by glaciers, and then by streams and rivers. Finally, after the glaciers retreated for the last time, a series of steep, tree-covered alluvial fans began to grow at the mouths of the deep gulches on the northeast-facing side of the mountain.

=== Commerce ===
Rundle rock or Rundle stone, a natural stone, first quarried on Mount Rundle, is a common dimension stone used in southern Alberta for landscaping and building purposes. It has been used in the construction of the Banff Springs Hotel and several of the Parks Canada buildings. It is fine-grained sandstone dating back to the Triassic Period.

== Scrambles ==
At the EEOR near Canmore there is a well-known scramble, the Goat Creek hiking trail, with its starting point at parking trailhead, which starts at the Smith-Dorrien/Spray Trail just south of the Canmore Reservoir above Grassi Lakes. This is also the beginning of the Mount Rundle Traverse, a demanding trek to mount all of Rundle&#x27;s peaks from Goat Creek parking lot to the Banff Springs Hotel. Mount Rundle is one of the most popular scrambles in the area, and is relatively straightforward for experienced hikers.
In Banff, the Spray River trailhead for the first peak taking the Mount Rundle Trail, is near the Spray River bridge on the road to the Banff Springs Golf Course. The all-day hike (from 8–10 hours) from the trailhead to the peak is about one-way and has an elevation gain of about to the cliff bank on the first peak and to the summit. Although it is called non-technical, it is considered gruelling by some. About halfway up there is a Central Gully, a huge watercourse with a well-worn path which is a dead end. Cliffs become higher and more vertical and there is no scrambling route. The real route crosses the watercourse and then immediately turns left (watch for markings). As one passes the treeline, the hiker ventures onto a feature called the &quot;Dragon&#x27;s back&quot;, where the route narrows between two steep gullies. The only real obstacle at this point is perseverance at the tread-mill like scree which slows progress to a two steps forward, one step back pattern.

The complete traverse from Banff to Canmore (staying always on the ridge) of the integral ridge was done &quot;solo&quot; in 1976 by the late Jean-Pierre Cadot. It required one bivouac, much scrambling, easy fifth-class rock climbing and one section was very involved and required lay-backing the ridge with a high degree of exposure. A long rappel was necessary to overcome a very steep section and it is most likely that the rappel station is still in place.

== Scenic viewpoints ==
In 2000 Dave Birrell described Mount Rundle as one of the most recognized Canadian mountains. Painter, print-maker and art teacher, Walter Phillips RCA (1884–1963) described Mount Rundle as his, &quot;bread and butter mountain. I never tire of painting it, for it is never the same. In deep shadow in the morning, it borrows a warm glow from the setting sun at the end of the day. Its colour runs the gamut from orange to cold blue-grey, with overtones of violet and intervals of green.&quot;

=== From Vermilion Lakes ===
The viewpoint from which most photographs are taken, from Mount Rundle, at the end of Vermilion Lakes road, with Vermillion Lakes in the foreground.

Mount Rundle and Sulphur Mountain can be seen from Mount Norquay on the north side of the Trans-Canada. The Banff Fairmont hotel patio and restaurants look out over Mount Rundle and Tunnel Mountain.

<text>Tanzim ( &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Organization&quot;) is a militant faction of the Palestinian Fatah movement.

Led by Marwan Barghouti, who is serving life sentences for murder in Israel, it gained prominence during the Second Intifada. Tanzim operates at the community level and has significantly pulled Palestinian support from Islamist groups. It has participated in violent acts against both military and civilian targets, and some of its members have even conducted suicide bombings.

==Overview==
The Tanzim militia, founded in 1995 by Yasser Arafat and other Fatah leaders to counter Palestinian Islamism, is widely considered to be an armed offshoot of Fatah with its own leadership structure. The acknowledged head of the Tanzim is Marwan Barghouti, who (as of 2017) is serving five consecutive life sentences in Israel for murder.

The Tanzim is a grass roots organization that operates at the community level. By taking a hardline position against Israel, it has helped siphon Palestinian support from the Islamist groups to the Palestinian Authority and PLO leadership.

Tanzim came to prominence in the street fighting which marked the beginning of the second Palestinian Intifada. Its members tend to be younger than those of other Fatah factions, often having grown up in the post-Oslo era. Many Tanzim members have joined the al-Shaid Yasser Arafat Brigades (formerly the &quot;al Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades&quot;). Tanzim has also recruited female suicide bombers, including Andaleeb Takatka, a 20-year-old Bethlehem woman who detonated an explosive belt at a Jerusalem bus stop in April 2002, killing six Israeli civilians, and injuring sixty. Marwan Barghouti, widely described as heading Tanzim, explicitly condemned terror attacks within Israel, writing &quot;While I, and the Fatah movement to which I belong, strongly oppose attacks and the targeting of civilians inside Israel, our future neighbor, I reserve the right to protect myself, to resist the Israeli occupation of my country and to fight for my freedom.&quot;

At the beginning of the Second Intifada, Hussein Abayat, leader of Tanzim in Beit Sahur, was killed in a helicopter attack by the IDF on 9 November 2000. The operation is considered the first time that Israel publicly acknowledged conducting a targeted killing. Abayat&#x27;s assistant Khaled Salahat was severely wounded in the strike.

On 15 February 2015, the Israeli army arrested Jamal Abu Lel, charging that he was &quot;the head of&quot; the Tanzim &quot;terrorist organization,&quot; running it from the Qalandiya refugee camp while carrying an Israeli permanent resident identity card due to his residing in Kfar Aqab, on the other side of the Jerusalem Airport from Qalandiya. Abu Lel is accused by the Shin Bet of funding and directing terrorist and shooting attacks against Israelis.

== Attacks against military and civilian targets ==

Fatah Tanzim have conducted a number of attacks against Israeli civilians and military, including against women and children. Below is a partial list of terrorist attacks:

<doc id="747349" wikidata="Q1274180" url="?curid=747349" title="Supercouple">
<text>A supercouple or super couple (also known as a power couple) is a popular and/or wealthy pairing that intrigues and fascinates the public in an intense or obsessive fashion. The term originated in the United States, and it was coined in the early 1980s when intense public interest in fictional soap opera couple Luke Spencer and Laura Webber, from &quot;General Hospital&quot;, made the pair a popular culture phenomenon.

The term &quot;supercouple&quot; typically refers to fictional couples from television dramas and film, such as &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;″s Rhett Butler and Scarlett O&#x27;Hara. With regard to real-life pairings, tabloids and the mainstream media have focused on wealthy or popular celebrity couples, and have titled them supercouples or power couples. Examples are the pairing of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez (which became known by the portmanteau &quot;Bennifer&quot;), and the former relationship of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie (&quot;Brangelina&quot;). 

==Definitions==
Supercouples are defined as popular or financially wealthy pairings that are widely admired in an intense or obsessive fashion and influence society&#x27;s expectations of what a great love story or relationship should be; they may or may not be romantic or high-profile, and interest in the pairings may be due to a combination of chemistry, physical attractiveness, or because they seem fated.

The term &quot;supercouple&quot; first appeared in 1981, with the wedding of &quot;General Hospital&quot;″s Luke and Laura. Thirty million viewers tuned into the event, and the widespread media attention it received from prominent newspapers and magazines set the pairing up as the default model for other soap opera supercouples. The model Luke and Laura originally followed consisted of action stories, romance, and obstacles for the couple to overcome. This paradigm subsequently became ideal of fictional soap opera supercouples in America, and extended to other genres. In &quot;Queer TV: Framing Sexualities On US Television&quot;, Nancy Martin says, &quot;Actively desiring heterosexual pairs not bent on reproduction became a required advertising device and a narratological mainstay on daytime and primetime.&quot; In &quot;Russian Television Today&quot;, David MacFadyen concludes, &quot;Even the busiest, most rambling soap operas are often neatly and conclusively distilled in the public&#x27;s mind by a &#x27;supercouple&#x27; or tiny, central pair of protagonists.&quot; Luke and Laura&#x27;s popularity resulted in fictional supercouples generally being regarded as soulmates. The pairings have typically overcome numerous obstacles or significant strife in order to be together.

Though a successful model, the concept has been criticized for hindering the growth of characters&#x27; relationships with other love interests; this has resulted in alternate definitions for the term. In her essay criticism of the term, &quot;The Siren Call of the Super Couple&quot; (ed. Suzanne Frentz, 1992), Diana Reep describes the love of a supercouple as &quot;so perfect that they are incapable of having romantic feelings for anyone else under any circumstances. In addition, the two have no personal flaws or idiosyncrasies that could interfere with their perfect love. Only an evil, outside force could disturb their relationship&quot;. While &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; former supervising producer Al Rabin credited the supercouple aspect as the secret to the show&#x27;s success, his then–executive producer Ken Corday stated, &quot;By definition, supercouple excludes others on the show. Every time they walk into a room, every other character, no matter how important, becomes window dressing, I&#x27;ve never believed in it.&quot; Corday added, &quot;Either people are involved in a good story or they&#x27;re not. They&#x27;re an interesting couple or they&#x27;re not.&quot; 
Celebrity couples may also be regarded as supercouples. Interest in the pairings ranges from media and public obsession to calculation of the couples&#x27; combined finances.

==Internet and media trends==
Fans often use portmanteau to refer to their favorite couples on online message boards, a significant aspect of the &quot;shipping fandom&quot;. The &quot;shipping fandom&quot; scene, whose name is derived from the word &quot;relationship&quot;, is a general term for fans&#x27; emotional or intellectual involvement with the ongoing development of romance in a work of fiction. Though technically applicable to any such involvement, it refers chiefly to various related social dynamics observable on the Internet, and is seldom used outside of that context. &quot;Shipping&quot; can involve virtually any kind of relationship—from the well-known and established, to the ambiguous or those undergoing development, and even to the highly improbable and the blatantly impossible. People involved in shipping (or shippers) assert that the relationship does exist, will exist, or simply that they would like it to exist.

&quot;Portmanteaux first came about with Lewis Carroll&quot; as a way to blend words, stated Jonathan Gabay, author of the Copywriter&#x27;s Compendium—a reference guide to the English language. Gabay added that people blend words in this fashion because sometimes there are words an individual wants, but those words do not actually exist. &quot;There&#x27;s a feeling you are trying to get out&quot;, he said. For fictional pairings, examples showcase themselves as Logan and Veronica (&quot;Veronica Mars&quot;) becomes &quot;LoVe&quot;, Josh and Reva (&quot;Guiding Light&quot;) becomes &quot;Jeva&quot;, Jack and Kate (&quot;Lost&quot;) becomes &quot;Jate&quot;, Michael and Sara (&quot;Prison Break&quot;) becomes &quot;MiSa&quot;, and so on. Some couples are given more complex portmanteaux; on &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, the pairing of Barney and Robin is referred to as &quot;BROTP&quot;, incorporating their initials, their platonic status as &quot;bros&quot;, and the popular fandom term OTP (&quot;One True Pairing&quot;). Seth Cohen of the show &quot;The O.C.&quot; parodied name-blending trends when he talked about real couples&#x27; overexposure to one another; he wondered whether or not his pairing with Summer Roberts would be called &quot;Summereth&quot; or &quot;Sethummer&quot;.

Gabay said portmanteaux &quot;...giv[e] people an essence of who they are within the same name. In double-barrelled names, the hyphen is almost pushing one name away from the other. Meshing says &#x27;I am you and you are me&#x27;, which is rather romantic&quot;. Occasionally, even anti-fans come up with names for couples, such as &quot;General Hospital&#x27;s&quot; Sonny Corinthos and Emily Quartermaine. The unpopular pairing of the mob boss and his enforcer&#x27;s sweet younger sister became known as &quot;Soily&quot;. Similarly, name-blending exists with celebrities&#x27; first names. Said to be a sign of commitment and togetherness, meshing is also seen by some as an attempt to banish what might be considered a &quot;sexist&quot; tradition of a woman taking her husband&#x27;s name when she marries.

In other Internet trends, fans often take part in making fan videos (also referred to as fanvids, a compilation of favorite scenes stylishly intercut as music videos or other various forms of entertainment) and writing fanfiction (alternative endings and stories to the original story&#x27;s outcome) for their favorite pairings. Sites such as YouTube, Archive of our Own, and Fanfiction.net help to facilitate this.

==Soap operas==
===Origins===
According to American soap opera writer and romance novelist Leah Laiman, soap operas are best known and most remembered for romance. The romances in daytime dramas are significantly characterized by bringing couples together, splitting them up, and starting the cycle over again to ensure that viewers remain invested in the pairings, if popular. This is a strategy that often succeeds within the medium. A supercouple storyline is typically detailed by the couple&#x27;s facing seemingly insurmountable challenges, such as a difference in social class, strong family interference, simple disagreements, marriages to other people, children with other people, etc.

Two characters comprising a supercouple will usually reunite and marry, while the most significant obstacle for the pairing is the soap opera genre itself; as soap operas typically continue for decades, there is no closure for the pairing unless both characters leave the show together or one of them dies. It is because of this, that after the usual fairytale wedding, if the supercouple remains on the series, writers do not allow the item to live happily ever after as a couple in a fairy tale would but rather subject them to a continual cycle of being separated and reunited. This factor has contributed to two characters of a supercouple normally divorcing and remarrying each other a few or several times. Author Diana Reep argues that the supercouple phenomenon creates &quot;serious storyline problems&quot; for producers and writers due to characters&#x27; being destined for only one lover:The problem supercouples create for storytellers is that, as characters, therefore, they are unchanging in a narrative form that emphasizes evolving characters and relationships... and as ideals, supercouples bring closure to a relationship in a world that is based in continuing expectations of change.

Creators within the medium generally focus more on the benefits of supercouples rather than the potential problems the pairings can produce. Former &quot;One Life to Live&quot; co-head writer Josh Griffith said that the key to a show&#x27;s success is &quot;passionate, romantic storytelling and pairings, and that&#x27;s what creates a supercouple&quot;. To him, they embody love and passion.

===Legends===
Although the term was not coined until the early 1980s, some couples prior to that point have been retrospectively termed supercouples; for example, Jeff Baker and Penny Hughes and Bob and Lisa Hughes, from &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. Doug Williams and Julie Olson from &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; are sometimes considered the first supercouple. From 1970 until 1976, Doug and Julie&#x27;s relationship wavers between love and hate. The chemistry the portrayers exhibited became evident offscreen; the real-life couple, Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth, were married in 1974. This set off a commotion among thousands of fans, who wrote letters to the show asking that the couple also be allowed to marry in the story. Since the actors were already married, they felt this was a valid request. NBC worked the tension and lengthened the anticipation of the wedding but eventually caved into the audience&#x27;s pressure. Doug and Julie are married in October 1976 within the series. They are the first soap opera characters to appear on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;.

Luke Spencer and Laura Webber, portrayed by Anthony Geary and Genie Francis from &quot;General Hospital&quot;, are considered the most famous soap opera supercouple. Their romance enthralled viewers; when they wed on November 16, 1981, American daytime television recorded its highest-ever ratings, with 30 million people tuning in to watch them say &quot;I do&quot;. Elizabeth Taylor made a cameo appearance during the wedding, and Princess Diana reportedly sent champagne. The couple was featured on the covers of &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and was credited with having brought &quot;legitimacy to daytime serials&quot; and its fans by crossing boundaries and becoming celebrities in the mainstream media. As a result, Luke and Laura have become regarded as daytime television&#x27;s quintessential and most iconic couple. While &quot;Guiding Light&quot; has the smallest number of supercouples, the series still had prominent pairings, notably Quint and Nola, as well as Josh and Reva, one of the central supercouples from the 1980s onward. In 1982, &quot;All My Children&quot;″s Jesse and Angie became the first black supercouple.

&quot;Dirty&quot; Den and Angie Watts, portrayed by Leslie Grantham and Anita Dobson on the British soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, generated an audience response similar to Luke and Laura&#x27;s. Den and Angie are renowned as arguably Britain&#x27;s most iconic soap opera couple, having broken the record for episode ratings to 30.1 million viewers in 1986 on the episode of their divorce, a record that remains unbeaten by any British soap opera episode today.

===Golden Age: 1980s===
The 1980s is known as the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of supercouples. Shows such as &quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and along with the aforementioned &quot;General Hospital&quot; and &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; were well known for their supercouples. &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; in particular had a significant number of supercouples — Bo and Hope, Shane and Kimberly, Patch and Kayla, and Jack and Jennifer all going on at roughly the same time. The show soon featured John and Marlena. &quot;All My Children&quot; was represented by Cliff and Nina, Greg and Jenny, Jesse and Angie, and later by Tad and Dixie.

&quot;As the World Turns&quot; had the popular couples Holden and Lily, Craig and Sierra, Tom and Margo, and Steve and Betsy with Betsy Stewart being portrayed by future film star Meg Ryan. Along with Luke and Laura, &quot;General Hospital&quot; also boasted Alan and Monica and Frisco and Felicia. At the same time, &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; introduced another supercouple, Cruz and Eden.

The supercouple phenomenon spread to foreign shores, with Scott and Charlene, portrayed by Jason Donovan and Kylie Minogue on the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;. The success of their romance prompted a fellow Australian daytime drama &quot;Home and Away&quot; to shelve out their own supercouple, Shane and Angel, and Den and Angie from &quot;EastEnders&quot; emerged as Britain&#x27;s most famous soap opera couple.

Sheraton Kalouria, NBC&#x27;s Vice President of Daytime Programming, said he believes in the &quot;it&quot; factor regarding fictional couples. &quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine Bo and Hope as a supercouple and divorce that from the magnetic chemistry of Peter Reckell and Kristian Alfonso&quot;, he stated. &quot;Or Cruz and Eden from &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; days and A Martinez and Marcy Walker. Or McKenzie Westmore as Sheridan and Galen Gering as Luis, if I might be so bold as to dub them a supercouple. Actors bring a huge excitement to [their pairing].&quot;

===Decline and remolding: 1990s–2000s===
====Popular, traditional, and altered setups====
Popular couplings on soap operas exist today, but there are few termed &quot;supercouples&quot; by fans or the soap opera media. Usually, the term is reminiscent of the 1970s and 1980s. As such, supercouples that are still on serials today are mostly from the 1980s, or early 1990s. After the mid-1990s, the supercouple phenomenon slowly faded and the nature of soap operas today allows few couples to define the nature of the show anymore as original supercouples once did.
&quot;Days of our Lives&quot; executive producer Ken Corday said that while he feels that &quot;love in the afternoon&quot; is still important to the genre, the supercouple title &quot;disappeared from vocabulary when Al Rabin [his supervising producer] left the show&quot;. &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; creator Agnes Nixon argued, &quot;[Supercouples are] still a vital component whenever possible.&quot; She stressed the importance of creating &quot;young love [stories], the Romeo and Juliet&quot; of tomorrow.

Shows have attempted to revive the success of supercouples through modern couples. There are instances when a character becomes a part of two popular pairings, where both couples which include the character develop the same or close to the same amount of positive fan reaction from viewers. This causes a certain rivalry between the two couples, with both vying for the title of supercouple. An example of this was especially evident with the mid-1990s storyline of &quot;General Hospital&quot;″s Sonny Corinthos, Brenda Barrett, and Jasper &quot;Jax&quot; Jacks, often referred to as &quot;the hottest love triangle in soap opera history&quot; by the soap opera media. The couple combinations within the love triangle were equally in demand, and which of the two is a true supercouple remains in dispute. Though debated, both couples are referenced and listed as supercouples by the soap opera medium.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoaP OpeRa DiGest 02/24/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Sonny character eventually acquired second supercouple status in the pairing of Sonny and Carly, becoming a part of two successful on-screen romances.

In other instances, a character is part of two equally popular couplings, but the storyline does not lend itself to the scenario being referred to as a love triangle. Samantha &quot;Sami&quot; Brady of the soap opera &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; is romantically desired by the two men, Lucas Roberts and EJ Wells. However, she was not considered to be actively involved in a love triangle, and both couples (Lucas and Sami and EJ and Sami) resonate with fans and appear to be at least equal in comparison and popularity.

In today&#x27;s soap opera medium, there are couples which come close to gaining supercouple status in terms of popularity. Although these pairings have perceived chemistry and potential, the couple&#x27;s story is cut short, often due to the actors leaving to pursue jobs outside of soap operas or due to the writers changing direction in a storyline. These couples do not last long enough onscreen to garner the long history of what is often considered a genuine supercouple. Such couples include Leo and Greenlee (&quot;All My Children&quot;), Ryan and Gillian (&quot;All My Children&quot;), Dusty and Lucy (&quot;As the World Turns&quot;), Simon and Katie (&quot;As the World Turns&quot;), Paul and Meg (&quot;As the World Turns&quot;), Robin and Stone (&quot;General Hospital&quot;), Jonathan and Tammy (&quot;Guiding Light&quot;), and Todd and Téa (&quot;One Life to Live&quot;).

Soap opera columnist Carolyn Aspenson stated that the &quot;supercouple formula&quot; should be redefined. She argued that tragic couples such as Leo and Greenlee are a better love story than if they had stayed together with a &quot;boring&quot; everyday life. &quot;A super couple shouldn&#x27;t be designed to be a couple that beats the odds and sticks it out no matter what,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#x27;re left with nothing on those terms. Instead, try redefining a super couple by the intensity of their love, their loss and their ability to move on without their other half. It leaves us frustrated, heartbroken and yearning for more. To me, that is the definition of a super couple.&quot;

====Gay and lesbian====
Soap operas traditionally featured only heterosexual romance. For American soap opera, this began to change with characters Bianca Montgomery, Lena Kundera, and Maggie Stone from &quot;All My Children&quot;. Bianca&#x27;s unveiling as a lesbian was unique for daytime television. By being a core character and the daughter of legendary diva Erica Kane, &quot;the show initiated an innovative discourse about the possibility, location, and representation of lesbian and gay characters in a television genre historically predicated on the celebration of heterosexual courtship, romance, and family life&quot;.

In 2003, Bianca&#x27;s relationship with Lena resulted in American daytime&#x27;s first lesbian kiss. The two became American daytime&#x27;s first lesbian couple, and received significant press. Though Lena and Bianca&#x27;s romance was well-received, popular, and the couple became responsible for several historic moments within daytime television, it was Bianca&#x27;s relationship with close confidante Maggie that thoroughly captivated viewers. The romance was considered unique and especially significant due to the show&#x27;s insistence that Maggie was not gay; the show&#x27;s insistence did not deter viewers from wanting the two romantically paired, and they often wrote in to the network (ABC) demanding that Bianca and Maggie become an official item. Eventually, hints that Maggie might not be heterosexual started to appear throughout the series, complicated by Maggie insisting that she is not gay but is rather &quot;into guys&quot; and only guys. Yet fan mail for the Bianca and Maggie pairing was prominent. The couple&#x27;s popularity grew beyond soap opera press, as newspapers and television magazines became fascinated by the love story as well. &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;The Advocate&quot;, and &quot;Daily News&quot; were among the media taking interest. The pairing eventually became the most popular gay couple in soap opera history, which surprised industry insiders who had not believed that a gay pairing could be as significantly in demand as heterosexual pairings. Though Bianca and Maggie&#x27;s romance was not made official until both were offscreen, it made clear to writers and executives who had been conflicted about including gay and lesbian love stories that the daytime audience was interested. Bianca and Maggie subsequently became American soap opera&#x27;s first same-sex supercouple.

Soap opera analyst C. Lee Harrington stated, &quot;While the past decade has witnessed a growing number of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender characters in primetime dramas and situation comedies, daytime soap operas offer unique challenges (and possibilities) regarding the inclusion and &#x27;normalization&#x27; of varied sexualities in entertainment television.&quot; Daytime television has been ahead of primetime for some time in exploring diverse or controversial storylines and characters, with the one glaring exception being homosexuality. Gay and lesbian issues or characters were invisible in 1950s and early 1960s TV. When it came to the mainstream shows, audiences were built up as &quot;replications of the idealized, middle-class nuclear family, defined as monogamous heterosexual couples with children&quot; (Buxton, 1997, p. 1477). Because of this perception of what was ideal, networks geared programming toward it, feeling that viewers were exactly like these images on their television screens.

In contrast to primetime, daytime dramas have different obstacles to developing innovative programming, with their advertising sponsors being more conservative, their audience smaller and &quot;genre restrictions that emphasize continuity and respect for history over innovation&quot;. Soap opera tried its first chance at including a gay character back in 1983 on &quot;All My Children.&quot; Actress Donna Pescow portrayed Dr. Lynn Carson, who &quot;comes out&quot; as a lesbian to patient and confidante Devon Shepherd McFadden (Tricia Pursley). The two women admit to having romantic feelings for each other, and that is as far as the relationship goes.

A prominent obstacle for gay and lesbian characters on daytime television is interference from television network executives who fear a decline in their ratings. The characters are often denied fulfilling and lasting romances with others of the same sex. &quot;Before Bianca&#x27;s gay character was written into &quot;All My Children&quot;, the purpose of gay characters was to make a point or explain homosexuality for the audience—a task handled within the course of a few episodes,&quot; said Zach Hudson of &quot;Washington Blade&quot;. &quot;The distraught parents or angry bullies who caused the early gay characters so much turmoil would suddenly see the light. Then the story—and the character—would simply vanish.&quot; It was not until Bianca that prominent gay characters and couples seemed possible within American daytime. Since then, American soap operas have tried to replicate the success of the Bianca character with the introduction of their own gay and lesbian characters. One soap opera in particular, &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, has been successful in launching the first popular romance between two men on an American daytime drama, Luke Snyder and Noah Mayer. In late 2007, the two make television history by carrying out the first kiss between two male lovers on an American soap opera. The popularity of the pairing borders on the same fascination level that centered around Bianca and Maggie&#x27;s lesbian romance. Not even months into the romantic aspect of their relationship, &quot;TV Guide&quot; named the male duo a top power couple.

Noah Mayer became one of the latest soap opera characters to come out as gay, and joined Bianca and others as visible gay characters in daytime. One year before Luke and Noah, the British soap opera &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; had already embarked on issuing their own gay male supercouple, between characters John Paul McQueen and Craig Dean; the storyline became one of the show&#x27;s most successful, gaining &quot;legions&quot; of fans. The budding same-sex romance on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; between Olivia Spencer and Natalia Rivera Aitoro became popular with fans in 2009. That same year, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; introduced its own male gay supercouple with Oliver Fish and Kyle Lewis. On international television, the German soap opera &quot;Verbotene Liebe&quot; gained international popularity, with the storylines involving Carla and Stella, and later with the couple of Christian and Oliver.

Beginning in 2011, &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; broke new ground when it decided to have the character Will Horton come out as gay. The soap chronicled Will&#x27;s struggle to accept his sexuality. The show also highlighted many obstacles the LGBT community face, such as bullying, hate crimes and gay slurs. The show cast actor Freddie Smith in the role of Jackson &quot;Sonny&quot; Kiriakis, the second openly gay contracted character in a daytime soap opera. Sonny would eventually become Will&#x27;s ongoing love interest. To the surprise of the actors and writers, Will and Sonny were greeted with fan support, and were eventually titled a supercouple and &quot;power couple&quot;. The show pushed the envelope even further when it decided to air Will&#x27;s first same-sex sexual encounter on-screen (which would become the first of many). Chandler Massey went on receive the 2012 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series, becoming the first actor ever to receive a Daytime Emmy Award for playing a gay character. He won his second consecutive Emmy for the role in the same category in 2013. Smith received his first Daytime Emmy nomination for his role in 2013 pitting him against Massey for the same award. In his acceptance speech, Massey thanked Smith. The show won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Daily Drama in 2013. In August 2013, it was announced that Massey had filmed his final episode as Will Horton, and that a recast had already been made. &quot;Days&quot; had initially planned not to recast the role, but changed its mind due to fear of advertiser and fan backlash.

In either aspect, fictional gay and lesbian romances have been argued as making an impact. &quot;These stories have the ability to reach the many different generations of viewers who watch daytime and share with them stories of our lives,&quot; stated Damon Romine, media entertainment director for the GLAAD organization. &quot;What viewers are seeing is that more and more of their own neighbors and friends are dealing with these issues, and the soaps are merely reflecting the reality of the world we live in.&quot;

==Primetime television==
A paradigm used for primetime couples is the love-hate relationship plotline. In the television series &quot;Dynasty&quot;, characters Krystle and Blake (Linda Evans and John Forsythe) are seen fighting for years, through ex-lovers and a host of other interferences. Krystle winds up in a coma and Blake spends years in jail, but their love eventually wins out over their problems. This resulted in the couple subsequently becoming one of television&#x27;s classic supercouples. Other early primetime power couplings include Ricky and Lucy (Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball) from &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, Pam and Bobby (Victoria Principal and Patrick Duffy) from &quot;Dallas&quot;, and Cliff and Clair Huxtable (Bill Cosby and Phylicia Rashad) from &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, among others.

Television shows also produce tragic love stories, such as Buffy and Angel from the series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The pairing&#x27;s persistent fight to be together is considered to have cemented their place in supercouple history. Voted #2 on IGN&#x27;s list of Top 10 Favorite TV Couples, and #5 on AOL&#x27;s list of Greatest TV Couples of All Time, the sites categorized the pairing as &quot;the ultimate&quot; star-crossed couple. The pairing&#x27;s main predicament—unable to experience sexual intimacy without Angel losing his humanity—has been summarized by IGN: 

Creator of the series Joss Whedon said, Becoming&#x27;, Parts 1 and 2 ... really sort of charted the main points of the Buffy–Angel relationship in all its difficulty and romance.&quot; Buffy&#x27;s portrayer, Sarah Michelle Gellar, said, &quot;I think deep down Buffy will always love Angel and she will never love anyone the way in which she loves him. I think they found a wonderful supercouple in Buffy and Angel.&quot;

Certain shows may not be adequately suited for a tragic-love storyline. For comedies, the approach of pairing mismatched couples is also often applied, and for dramas, there tends to be a &quot;will-they-won&#x27;t-they&quot; setup. Website Cinemablend states that there are two general formulas for a &quot;will-they-wont-they&quot; setup. &quot;The first one is when one person pursues the other, then finally gives up and dates someone else,&quot; the site stated, &quot;and the other scenario is when the two characters are so different and often do not get along with one another, they fight and argue constantly, but then one thing or a series of &#x27;things&#x27; happen and they are forced to put up with each other.&quot; Examples of popular couples cited for having displayed this formula are Buffy and Spike (of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;), Ross and Rachel (of the show &quot;Friends&quot;), Logan and Veronica (of the show &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;), among others.

There are numerous shows that tend to pair up two unexpected characters together. For instance, Pacey Witter and Joey Potter from the teen drama &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. Pacey and Joey did not like each other at all first, and Joey was in love with her supposed soulmate Dawson Leery, but they eventually fell in love and became a supercouple of the show. Kurt Hummel and Blaine Anderson and Santana Lopez and Brittany Pierce from &quot;Glee&quot; are regularly quoted as TV&#x27;s first LGBTQ supercouples.

A well-known &quot;will-they-won&#x27;t-they&quot; setup is the relationship of supercouple Agent Fox Mulder and Agent Dana Scully from the science fiction/thriller series &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Mulder and Scully, two FBI agents investigating cases that involve the paranormal, are showcased as having a relationship which borders on subtle hints of romance throughout the series without the two being heavily romantically involved. Though anticipation for Mulder and Scully to romantically commit to each other had existed for years among the show&#x27;s fanbase, the pairing&#x27;s romantic intimacy was not written as soon as fans would have hoped for; when the two are finally shown sharing a kiss in 1999 after seven seasons of buildup, some viewers felt the show waited too long to script the event. Critics state that in such cases, if a series extends sexual tension for &quot;too long&quot; before finally acting on romantic intimacy between the characters, it can result in viewers feeling that the best part of the pairing&#x27;s buildup was their &quot;will-they-won&#x27;t-they&quot; status.

With some fictional supercouples from soap opera or primetime, the couple may have started out as an unexpected pairing and with or without a paradigm. Due to viewers becoming excited over the prospect of chemistry between the two, the show&#x27;s producers and writers later decide to pair them.

==Film==
Given that films inherently have a shorter amount of time to develop characters and carry out storylines, the task of convincing the audience that the film&#x27;s couple are adequately suited for each other can be challenging. This is especially evident in cases where there is not enough plot focusing on the buildup of the characters&#x27; interaction, which can make the love story seem contrived. A memorable line or catchphrase spoken between the characters has been suggested as a remedy to this, since it can elevate a pairing&#x27;s popularity.

Films may resort to the notion that romance is a solution to life&#x27;s problems or is unchangeable, tapping into a &quot;love conquers all&quot; appeal; for example, in &quot;doomed&quot; romances where the underlying message is that the love the couple shared endured even though their time together was cut short. A film supercouple can be a couple appearing with the same actors over the course of few or several films, making the actors the supercouples rather than the characters.

==Celebrity==

The media often focuses on celebrity pairings. Celebrity couples who are viewed as fascinating or create a power coupling due to finances are singled out as supercouples. Since the term was coined, classic Hollywood couples have been regarded as supercouples, including Clark Gable and Carole Lombard. &quot;People&quot; magazine stated that Gable and Lombard were &quot;more than just Golden Age window dressing. The love they shared for six years was that Hollywood rarity: the real thing.&quot; They were titled &quot;The King of Hollywood and the Queen of Screwball Comedy&quot;, respectively, and eloped during a break in production on Gable&#x27;s &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in 1939. Lombard died three years later in a plane crash on her way home from a war bond rally. Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball were the stars and producers of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, and have since been credited as an onscreen and offscreen supercouple. They divorced in 1960 after 20 years of marriage. &quot;People&quot; described Gable and Lombard, Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner, and Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, were couples recognized as &quot;the greatest love stories of the century&quot;.

The supercouple title has been similarly prolific with modern celebrity pairings. In 1997, rapper/actor Will Smith married actress Jada Pinkett. The couple were titled a supercouple due to their combined film star allure and perceived physical attractiveness. In 2003 and 2008, &quot;People&quot; magazine categorized them as a supercouple due to their long marriage and widespread celebrity status. Smith spoke of the power of love as a connective force to &quot;Essence&quot; magazine. &quot;The truth about life is that we&#x27;re all alone,&quot; he said. &quot;But when somebody loves you, that experience is shared. Love is the only real connective tissue that allows you to not live and die by yourself.&quot; In 1998, Brad Pitt met &quot;Friends&quot; actress Jennifer Aniston, and married her in a private wedding ceremony in Malibu on July 29, 2000. They were titled a supercouple, regarded as one of the film industry&#x27;s most powerful, and their marriage was considered a rare Hollywood success. In January 2005, Pitt and Aniston announced they decided to formally separate after seven years together. Two months later, Aniston filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. In November 2000, Michael Douglas married Welsh actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, and the pair, 25 years apart in age, were considered a supercouple.

Pairing Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez incited unprecedented media attention for an American modern-day supercouple during their 2002-2004 relationship. The two were referred to as the first superstar couple of the Internet age, and the couple&#x27;s popularity resulted in their being known by the portmanteau &quot;Bennifer&quot; (for Ben and Jennifer) to the media, as well as to fans using the name combination. The term &quot;Bennifer&quot; itself became popular and started the trend of other celebrity couples being referred to by the combination of each other&#x27;s first names. The pairing eventually succumbed to overexposure, which caused public interest in their romance to result in less admiration and negatively affected their careers. In 2007, Affleck stated:

[The romance] was probably bad for my career. What happens is this sort of bleed-over from the tabloids across your movie work. You go to a movie, you only go once. But the tabloids and Internet are everywhere. You can really subsume the public image of somebody. I ended up in an unfortunate crosshair position where I was in a relationship and [the media] mostly lied and inflated a bunch of salacious stuff for the sake of selling magazines. And I paid a certain price for that. Then, in concert with some movies that didn&#x27;t work...

A celebrity supercouple to emerge after Bennifer was &quot;TomKat&quot; (the coupling of celebrity stars Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes), and other countries had already adopted the supercouple term. The United Kingdom had Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley (Grant &#x27;n&#x27; Hurley) and Posh and Becks (Victoria and David Beckham). Japan had Tomonori Jinnai and Norika Fujiwara; Jinnai established himself as a television regular and a &quot;pin-geinin&quot; or solo comedian while Fujiwara, a former Miss Japan, became known as a successful actress and &quot;one of the business&#x27;s biggest earners with a string of commercial contracts, regular TV and stage roles, and also active in charitable causes&quot;. They were titled &quot;one of the &#x27;super couples&#x27; of Japanese showbiz&quot; and &quot;held their elaborate traditional wedding on February 17, 2007 at the Ikutajinja shrine in Fujiwara&#x27;s hometown of Kobe, with hundreds of reporters and thousands of fans craning for a glimpse outside&quot; and &quot;invited 600 guests to the Hotel Okura the following April for a wedding reception that cost over ¥500 million. The event was broadcast live on TV and had a high audience rating of 40% in the Kansai region&quot;.

Another American couple regularly titled a supercouple are musicians Jay-Z and Beyoncé, also known as The Carters. Their marriage in New York City in early 2008, was reported by &quot;People&quot;. Knowles and Jay-Z were listed as the most powerful couple for &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 most influential people of 2006. In January 2009, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked them as Hollywood&#x27;s top-earning couple, with a combined total of $162 million. They also made it to the top of the list the following year, with a combined total of $122 million between June 2008 and June 2009. As of 2024, the couple has a combined total net worth of $3.3 billion.

The spotlight and attention given to American celebrity supercouples reached its height in 2006, when the celebrity phenomenon dubbed &quot;Brangelina&quot; triggered media obsession surrounding screen stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The two emerged as a prominent supercouple, 

Robert Thompson, director of the Centre for the Study of Popular Television, said the coupling of A-list stars like Pitt and Jolie, or in years gone by Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, was &quot;a paparazzi&#x27;s dream come true&quot;. He added that &quot;as silly as it sounds, this new tendency to make up single names for two people, like &#x27;Bennifer&#x27; (Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez) and &#x27;TomKat&#x27; (Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes), is an insightful idea&#x27;. &#x27;Brangelina&#x27; has more cultural equity than their two star parts.&quot;

In India, cricketer Virat Kohli and Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma started dating in 2013, and tied the knot in December 2017, forming one of contemporary India&#x27;s most famous and talked-about supercouple. They have been referred to as &#x27;Virushka&#x27;, in line with Hollywood pairings such as &#x27;Brangelina&#x27;. Similarly, actors John Abraham and Bipasha Basu are a former supercouple. Other Indian power couples, usually associated with the Hindi film industry, include: Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan; Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai; Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi (cricketer) and Sharmila Tagore; Dharmendra and Hema Malini; Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor.

Polly Vernon of the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; summed up her analysis of what makes a celebrity supercouple in her May 25, 2000 article:

The basic appeal of the accomplished supercouple can be reduced to this: by hooking up with another, carefully selected celeb, you can eliminate your bad points, compensate for your own shortcomings, and hint at a softer, more vulnerable side. Attach yourself to someone smarter, prettier, more fashionable, hipper, funnier than you are, and you will automatically acquire these missing qualities by osmosis. They, equally, will benefit from your particular brand of star quality. Your public perception will become more complete, more exciting. Together, you are quite literally, the ultimate individual.In 2023, American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift and football player Travis Kelce began dating, leading media outlets to call them a supercouple, with some even going as far as dubbing them &quot;America&#x27;s Royal Couple&quot;. The highly publicized relationship had a considerable cultural impact. &quot;Billboard&quot; opined that Swift and Kelce &quot;are arguably the world&#x27;s most high-profile couple right now, consistently making headlines on the daily for simply holding hands or enjoying dinner together.&quot; The NFL viewership increased dramatically; the Chiefs–Bears game, which Swift attended, drew the most television viewers of the weekend, while sales of Kelce&#x27;s jersey and Chiefs home game tickets surged. The NFL and NBC used the relationship for social media content and to promote subsequent games. A Chiefs–Jets game that Swift attended averaged 27 million viewers, making it the most-watched Sunday-night television show since Super Bowl LVII.

A number of couples in the public dressed up as Swift and Kelce as part of 2023 Halloween. A television special by &quot;Nightline&quot; about the relationship and its media impact, titled &quot;Taylor + Travis&quot;, was released on Hulu in November 2023. Journalist Emily Yahr opined in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the United States &quot;giddily contemplates&quot; the pairing of Swift and Kelce that, &quot;for many observers, checks all the right boxes.&quot; Andrew Unterbeger of &quot;Billboard&quot; opined that Swift and Kelce&#x27;s romance resulted in a &quot;near-100% public approval&quot; because &quot;it just felt right: the All-American athlete dating the All-American pop star.&quot;

==Video games==
Video game creators have realized the asset of incorporating supercouple romances within their products by stringing together epic stories of love and intrigue. While writing epic romances into video games is not a new phenomenon, the idea of capturing a video game player through emotionally charged moments via the death of a hero&#x27;s lover in order to produce feelings of attachment to the fictional environment has expanded, especially within action-adventure/role-playing games (RPGs). The goal is to make the gamer actually become emotionally invested in the characters and their actions, ultimately resulting in heightened gaming experience. Video game designer Peter Molyneux, when speaking of the main component he wanted in his game &quot;Fable 2&quot;, spoke of more than just the romantic aspect, stating, &quot;We want you to feel loved. You can have sex and you can have a baby. That baby will grow up and will kind of look like you.&quot;

In the early days of gaming, the idea of love and romance was used as little more than a plot point to urge the hero to complete the set of tasks put before him. Mario, hero of the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series of games, has Princess Peach to rescue from the main villain. Link and Princess Zelda from &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; made gamers wonder why the two were not romantically together while rooting for the couple. &quot;Double Dragon&quot; features the protagonist Billy Lee, as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend (Maria) from his evil twin brother (Jimmy), leader of a sinister street gang. This era of game-playing was not well known for equal opportunity in gender roles.

Eventually, video games grew to become a respectable and rich source of storytelling. &quot;Larger disk space, greater production staffs, and more impressive budgets allowed more fleshed out characters, more elaborate plot points, and greater instances of interaction between characters.&quot; The genre that benefited from this the most is the role-playing medium. The medium made romantic themes a prominent element of its story-telling, which became one of its staples. This subplot is featured through the exploits of supercouples, the primary pair of lovers.

&quot;Usually, the &#x27;supercouple&#x27; turns out to be the main hero and heroine of the game, though this is not always the case.&quot; The Lunar series, for example, has become famous for creating several romantic pairings from the hero&#x27;s party in addition to the hero and heroine. In a role-playing plot, often the romantic feelings the characters feel for one another somehow becomes entwined with the main plot itself. In &quot;Grandia&quot;, Justin, the main character, is compelled to fight against seemingly insurmountable odds in order to rescue the girl that he is in love with. In &quot;Tales of Legendia&quot;, the romantic feelings Shirley Fennes has for main character and brother-in-law Senel Coolidge is a focus of the game, even though the latter seems oblivious of the former&#x27;s true feelings even after they are accidentally engaged in the ending of the primary story mode. &quot;When the love between the supercouple somehow becomes threatened by the machinations of the antagonist, the heroes fight back with everything they have and usually prove, once and for all, that &#x27;love conquers all&#x27;.&quot;

The &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot; has several notable couples, such as Cloud Strife and his relationships with childhood friend Tifa Lockhart and flower girl Aerith Gainsborough. Cloud Strife and Aerith Gainsborough have been called video games&#x27; greatest, as well as its most tragic, star-crossed love story. The couple is also one of the most well-known video game couples in the history of video gaming. In 2005, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; stated that without the game, &quot;Aeris wouldn&#x27;t have died, and gamers wouldn&#x27;t have learned how to cry&quot;.

Other popular couples from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games include Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly (from &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;), Zidane Tribal and Princess Garnet til Alexandros (from &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;), Tidus and Yuna (from &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;), Vincent Valentine and his lost love Lucrecia Crescent, Zack Fair and Aerith Gainsborough in the prequel &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; game &quot;Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Snow Villiers and Serah Farron from &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot;, and Cecil Harvey and Rosa Farrell from &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;.

Love stories such as Solid Snake and Meryl Silverburgh (from &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;), which takes on more of a subtle approach, and couples defined more by their conflicts than their happiness, have also impacted the gaming industry. Video game insiders state that the need for these love stories within the gaming realm is valid and is a great addition to the gaming experience in most cases.

==Literature and toys==
Romantic and tragic themes found in modern supercouple stories have often been borrowed from classic literary couples. Romeo and Juliet, due to their enduring legacy and popularity, are considered an ideal supercouple outline for aspects of forbidden or tragic love, and the relationship between Antony and Cleopatra has been described as fitting the power-couple trope.

In the genres of toys and comic books, toys were given their first prominent supercouple with the creation of Ken and Barbie by Mattel, in 1961, and comic book supercouples such as Superman and Lois Lane (created in 1938), and Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson (created in 1966) are still popular today.

<doc id="747354" wikidata="Q3140166" url="?curid=747354" title="Honolulu Police Department">
<text>The Honolulu Police Department (HPD) is the principal law enforcement agency of the City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii, headquartered in the Alapa&#x27;i Police Headquarters in Honolulu CDP.

Officially recognized as a part of the government of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1846, the police department serves the entire island of O&#x27;ahu (which is coextensive with the City and County of Honolulu), covering over of territory, with just over 900,000 residents (not including military members) and over four million annual visitors. The island is divided into 8 patrol districts which are then subdivided into sectors and beats. HPD currently has more than 2,500 employees, 2,134 of which are full-time sworn officers. A 2003 Department of Justice report listed HPD as the 20th largest police department in the nation.

Unlike the other 49 states, Hawaii does not have a state police agency &quot;per se&quot; or individual city agencies; law enforcement is the jurisdiction of the individual county governments. HPD is nationally accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies and received the CALEA TRI-ARC Excellence Award from them in 2006.

==History==
===Predecessors===
In 1840, the Supreme Court of Kamehameha III established the first constitution for the Kingdom of Hawaii. The constitution paved the way for the &quot;Act to Organize the Executive Departments of the Government&quot; signed on April 27, 1846. The law created the office of marshal of the kingdom, the highest ranking police officer in the Hawaiian nation. He nominated, instructed, supervised and controlled the sheriffs of the kingdom of which there were four, one for each administrative region of Kaua&#x27;i, O&#x27;ahu, Mau&#x27;i and Hawaii. Each sheriff administered a corps of constables officially appointed by the four royal governors. Constables wore a distinct police insignia that consisted of a scarlet crown with the initials &quot;KIII&quot; in honor of Kamehameha III. The insignia was worn on the arm and on a red band on their police hats.

In 1893, the Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown by the Provisional Government of Hawaii which quickly deposed the marshal of the kingdom and dissolved the constabulary. In 1894, the newly proclaimed Republic of Hawaii formed its own police system.

After a few years under the governance of the Territory of Hawaii, four county governments were established out of the original administrative regions of the monarchy. John Thomas Kelly (1868–1927) was the first Sheriff of Honolulu under this system, and had served as an engineer in the 2nd Regiment during the Spanish-American War. His diary is on display in the Hawaiian National Archives. In 1905, each county established a police department led by an appointed sheriff. Police officers wore an octagon-shaped police badge similar in appearance to those of other police departments of the period. In the 1920s the badge was redesigned with an eagle on top.

In Hawaii, the Office of Sheriff falls under the Sheriff Division of the Hawaii Department of Law Enforcement (DLE). It is the functional equivalent of a state police department and has the distinction of making Hawaii the only U.S. state without an officially named state police department and one of two with a statewide Sheriff&#x27;s Department (the other being Rhode Island). Although the Sheriff Division&#x27;s jurisdiction covers the entire state, its primary functions are judicial and executive protection, security at the Hawaii State Capitol, law-enforcement at Hawaii&#x27;s airports, narcotics enforcement, prisoner transportation, the processing and service of court orders and warrants, and patrol of certain roads and waterways in conjunction with other state agencies.

Additional statewide law enforcement is provided by the Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) which patrols State lands, State Parks, historic sites, forest reserves, aquatic life and wildlife areas, coastal zones, Conservation districts, State beaches, as well as county ordinances involving county parks. The division also enforces laws relating to firearms, ammunition, and dangerous weapons. DLNR officers have full police powers.

===Establishment===
In response to a crime wave in the late 1920s and early 1930s as a combined result of increased racial tensions between whites and local ethnics and the outcome of the Massie case involving too much political influence on the Police, Territorial Governor Lawrence M. Judd appointed a &quot;Governor&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Crime&quot;. The committee recommended that a police commission be appointed by the mayor of Honolulu whose duty would be to appoint a chief of police and to supervise the operating of the police department. The committee also advised that the office of sheriff should be retained and charged with the duty of serving civil process, of maintaining the Honolulu prison system and to act as coroner. On January 22, 1932, a special session of the territorial legislature passed Act 1, establishing the Honolulu Police Commission and creating the office of chief of police. Thus was born the modern Honolulu Police Department as it exists today.

===Martial law===
After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Territorial Governor Joseph B. Poindexter declared martial law and Hawaii fell under military governance under the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps. The Honolulu Police Department became a deputized military force. The word &quot;Emergency&quot; was etched above the &quot;Honolulu&quot; on the seven-point star badges of police officers. For the duration of World War II, the Honolulu Police Department was forced to impose restrictions on civil liberties and hand people over for trial by a military judge. Martial law ended after the end of the war in 1945.

The San José State Spartans football team served with the Honolulu Police Department for the duration of World War II; the team had played a game against the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa Warriors, but were stranded in Hawaii after the Pearl Harbor attack.

===Modernization===

The first instance of modernization came in 1952 with the introduction of the Honolulu Police Department&#x27;s current badge. It was designed by Detective Alfred Karratti and embodies Hawaiian tradition and culture in its motifs. One feature that Detective Karratti kept was the use of the &quot;Pūloʻuloʻu&quot; or &quot;kapu&quot; staffs. They are symbols of law and order from ancient Hawaii.

In 1976 Sister Roberta Julie Derby became the first female police chaplain in the U.S. and would later go on to win the medal of valor for defusing a hostage situation.

The most aggressive programs of modernization for the Honolulu Police Department came in the 1990s. It was furnished with a fleet of new Ford Crown Victoria police cars equipped with on-board computers and a fleet of BMW police motorcycles. Officers also have the choice of using their own private vehicle for law enforcement duties as part of a subsidized program. The vehicle has sirens installed and removable blue police light which is put on the roof of the officers&#x27; car. On October 16, 1992, the Honolulu Police Department opened its multimillion-dollar state-of-the-art police headquarters in downtown Honolulu. The building was called &quot;Hale Maka&#x27;i&quot; and featured the latest technical advances of its time including a DNA crime lab unit, one of the first of its kind in the nation.

===Corruption and misconduct===
In October 2015, a former HPD officer was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison for an &quot;unprovoked attack&quot; on two men in a game room.

In 2016, a retired police officer pleaded guilty to lying under oath as part of a conspiracy to frame a man for stealing a mailbox from the home of Police Chief Louis Kealoha.

In 2017, Chief Louis Kealoha retired from the police department amid an FBI investigation into corruption and conspiracy. In June 2019, a jury in federal court convicted Kealoha (along with his wife Katherine and two Honolulu police officers) of using their law enforcement positions in an attempt &quot;to frame Katherine Kealoha&#x27;s uncle for stealing the couple&#x27;s mailbox in 2013&quot; and subsequently lying to federal investigators. The Kealohas pleaded guilty in October 2019 to financial crimes arising from the mailbox theft (specifically bank fraud and identity theft); two others were convicted in connection to the same case. In November 2020, Louis Kealoha was sentenced to serve 8 years in federal prison. Due to precautions related to the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic, Louis Kealoha was allowed to start his sentence in April 2021. His wife, Katherine, received a sentence of 13 years.

In 2018, Lieutenant Eric Yiu, a veteran detective who investigated financial crimes, was indicted on six felony counts of making false statements on his state tax returns. He pleaded guilty in March 2019, as part of a plea agreement, to filing fraudulent tax returns for three years, and May 2019, he was ordered to pay $11,654 for tax evasion, but avoided jail.

==Patrol vehicles==
The Honolulu Police Department has several new vehicles including the Ford Explorer Police Interceptor is the primiary vehicle for the fleet while the Ford Taurus Police Interceptor as well as Ford Fusion, Toyota Camry and a few Crown Victoria&#x27;s still in use even though it is no longer produced. HPD marked vehicles are white and blue.

The Honolulu Police Department is one of the four police departments in the state of Hawaii, being Hawaii County Police on &quot;the big island,&quot; Kauai Police Department, and Maui Police Department. Officers are permitted to purchase a vehicle for police patrol and for personal usage of any make and model, however it must be approved by the chief and must meet certain police department guidelines. The vehicles are unmarked and the officers receive payment for taking care of the vehicle including fuel payment. Although they are unmarked they can be easily identified by a small blue LED light on the roof of the vehicles. They are also equipped with sirens to be used for on duty only. Hawaii is the only US state in which police officers are permitted to use personal vehicles for official police businesses.

==Rank structure and insignia==
The Honolulu Police Department follows a paramilitary-like ranking structure. The ranks are identified as follows:

Officers may have stars located on the right-side chest area of their uniform above their name tag. These do not indicate rank: each star represents five years of service with the Honolulu Police Department. All uniformed emergency response personnel in the State of Hawaii generally follow this practice, although it does not carry on from one agency to the next.

==Districts==
The Honolulu Police Department has 5 stations, 5 substations and Police Headquarters located in central Honolulu Alapai Police HQ.

==Honolulu Police Specialized Services Division==
The Honolulu Police Specialized Services Division is a special tactical and task force. HPD SSD members have several roles such as SWAT responding to high risk calls, hostage rescues, dealing with fugitive or dangerous criminals and barricaded subjects. They are also tasked with protection of head of states and work alongside other law enforcement local, state and federal to apprehend any criminals surrounding the island of Oahu.

The Bomb Squad is tasked with responding to any calls related to IED and properly disposing, defuse the device. They are trained in detecting and proper handling of explosive materials from fireworks, commercial and IEDs including military grade explosives. They train with federal agencies and the US Military.

The Canine Unit- 
Officers in the canine unit receives training along with dogs are called upon to search for missing people, dangerous criminals and prisoner escapees. Each dog is designated a badge and is an official police officer.

The Helicopter Section-
Officers in this section are trained as police officers and FAA pilot mechanic certified. They are tasked in assisting HPD ground units by providing aerial observation for missing people, wanted fugitives, criminals and any other police related matter.

==Reserves==
Since 1941, the police department has maintained a police reserve program. Reserve officers are unpaid volunteers who work part-time (at least five hours per week) for the department in various roles.

==Line of duty deaths==

As of August 2022, 49 Honolulu Police Department officers have been killed in the line of duty. The department webpage lists all of them on a &quot;Roll of Honor&quot;.

==Duty weapons==
The standard issue firearm for Honolulu Police officers is the Glock 17. Prior to 2014, officers were issued the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 5906 but have since been phased out due to the age of the pistol and limited availability of parts. Officers carry their issued sidearm, the Glock 17 and can check out AR-15 rifles and less lethal shotguns from the armory while on their tour of duty. Officers can purchase supplemental weapons from an approved list and utilize them (as backup weapons or off-duty carry), AR-15 rifles, and shotguns. Officers must qualify with these supplemental weapons to carry or use them.

Approved long guns are the Colt AR-15 rifle, Remington 870 or Benelli M1 (Super 90) shotgun. Although most Officers carry their own personal long guns while on duty, respective stations throughout the island have a small arsenal of AR-15 rifles and less than lethal shotguns in the event they are needed.

==In popular culture==
The Honolulu Police Department has been the backdrop of several famous works of fiction, in literature, television and in motion pictures.

===Charlie Chan===
One of the most famous fictional literary detectives attached to the Honolulu Police Department was Charlie Chan. Chan, inspired in part by the career of HPD vice detective Chang Apana, was created in the 1920s by Earl Derr Biggers and became one of the most important figures in American mystery fiction. In addition to being the hero of six novels, Chan was the subject of some forty films between the 1930s and 1950s. He, along with his family, was also made the subject of a short-lived ABC/Hanna-Barbera cartoon series in the mid-1970s, &quot;The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan&quot;. His career spanned from 1898 to 1932.

===&quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;===

From October 1959 to September 1963, &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; was a crime drama aired on the ABC television network. Actors Robert Conrad and Anthony Eisley played private detectives fighting crime in Honolulu. Connie Stevens played Cricket, a singer at the Hawaiian Village Hotel bar which the guys frequented at least once a show. Mel Prestidge played Lt. Danny Quon, a Honolulu Police Lieutenant.

===&quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;===

The most famous Hawaii based crime drama was &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; which aired on the CBS television network from September 1968 to April 1980. Until &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; was the longest running crime series on American television. Jack Lord starred as Steve McGarrett, head of the elite state law enforcement office which worked alongside the chief of the Honolulu Police Department. James MacArthur starred as Danny Williams, McGarrett&#x27;s right-hand man. McGarrett and &quot;Danno&quot; were straight-laced men with extreme dedication to law and justice fighting the forces of evil around the islands, especially in seedy downtown dives. Kam Fong Chun (who played Det. Chin Ho Kelly) was, in real life, a former HPD officer during World War Two. In several episodes of the show&#x27;s first season, McGarrett mentions &quot;Chief Dan&quot; helping the Five-O unit with things like extra manpower or investigative resources; this referred to the real life Honolulu Police Chief Dan Liu (1908–1986), HPD&#x27;s longest serving chief (1948–1969). (Chief Dan Liu also appeared as himself in the 1952 film &quot;Big Jim McLain&quot;.)

A modern-day remake of the series aired on the same television network from September 2010 to April 2020. Like its predecessor, the remake prominently featured the HPD, usually uniform officers assisting the Five-0 task force in apprehending suspects, collecting evidence and securing crime scenes. The main characters, as of season 6, were all either former HPD officers or have some connection to the HPD: Steve McGarrett&#x27;s father John was a former HPD sergeant, Chin Ho Kelly was John McGarrett&#x27;s protege and reached the rank of Lieutenant, Danny Williams transferred to HPD from Newark PD in New Jersey, Kono Kalakaua was a fresh graduate from the HPD Academy and Lou Grover was the commander of the HPD SWAT Team. Kam Fong Chun&#x27;s son Dennis Chun had a recurring role as HPD Sgt. Duke Lukela.

===&quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;===

From December 1980 to September 1988, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; aired on the same network as &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; (in fact, some of the shooting was done on the same sound stage). Starring Tom Selleck as former U.S. Naval Intelligence and SEAL officer (and Detroit native) Thomas Magnum, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; is about a private investigator working closely with Honolulu Police Department officers Nolan Page and Yoshi Tanaka, while trying to enjoy the &quot;easy life&quot; at the estate of a very reclusive mystery writer named &quot;Robin Masters&quot; and his &quot;butler&quot; Jonathan Higgins (played by Texas-born veteran actor John Hillerman). The series was widely applauded for being the first to recognize the difficulty Vietnam War veterans faced in making the readjustment to civilian life. Many episodes touched upon the impact that serving in Vietnam had on Magnum and his friends, as well as echoes to events of World War II.

A reboot of Magnum P.I was released between 2018 and 2024. Similar to Five-0, the show prominently featured HPD assisting Magnum and his partner Juliet Higgins in apprehending suspects, raids, or providing information from the department. The show featured a rebooted Detective Yoshi Tanaka for its first 3 episodes before being promoted with Detective Gordon Katsumoto being the main &quot;liason&quot; between the PIs and HPD for the majority of the show. Other detectives appeared as well, including Detective Childs and Detective Thomas, who was Magnum&#x27;s girlfriend in Season 4. Along with this, certain HPD officers who were in Hawaii Five-0 made their way onto Magnum PI as well.

===&quot;Hawaiian Heat&quot;===

&quot;Hawaiian Heat&quot; was a short-lived series (September–December 1984) that was heavily hyped by ABC during its 1984 Olympics coverage. It starred Robert Ginty and Jeff McCracken as two Chicago cops who bag their boring jobs in the frozen Windy City to become detectives in paradise; their boss was played by veteran actor Mako Iwamatsu. Many of the episodes were directed by reclusive African-American actor/director Ivan Dixon.

===&quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot;===
From September 1987 to March 1992, CBS Television (in conjunction with Dean Hargrove Productions and the former Viacom Television) aired a spin-off for a &quot;Matlock&quot; character. The show was called &quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot; about Los Angeles County District Attorney Jason Lochinvar McCade (played by veteran radio/TV actor William Conrad) and his Chief Investigator, Jake Styles (played by Joe Penny). In the second season, CBS executives decided to film in Hawaii instead (having McCabe quit as DA for Los Angeles to become the Prosecuting Attorney in Honolulu), so the entire cast (including the show&#x27;s mascot, a bulldog named Max) was sent to Honolulu. After two seasons in Hawaii, the series returned to L.A.

===&quot;Hawaii&quot;===
In August 2004, NBC introduced the police series &quot;Hawaii&quot;. The show featured an elite Honolulu Police Department detective squad charged with fighting the most notorious of Hawaii mob criminals. Starring in the show were Michael Biehn from &quot;The Terminator&quot; as Sean Harrison, Sharif Atkins from &quot;ER&quot; as John Declan, Ivan Sergei from &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; as Danny Edwards, Eric Balfour from &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; as Christopher Gains, and newcomers Aya Sumika as Linh Tamiya and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Captain Terry Harada. Jeff Eastin was the creator and executive producer. Daniel Sackheim from the defunct series &quot;The Lyon&#x27;s Den&quot; directed. The series was canceled after eight episodes, partly due to strong competition from another show produced in Hawaii, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Lost&quot;.

NCIS Hawai&#x27;i

In 2021, a year after the reboot of Hawaii Five-0&#x27;s cancellation, CBS announced the release of , a spin-off of the military-police drama &quot;NCIS&quot;. Although the show focused on naval crimes, HPD officers can be prominently seen securing evidence in crime scenes, along with assisting with raids every so often. Similar to the reboot of Magnum P.I., certain HPD officers who appeared in Hawaii Five-0 appeared in NCIS Hawai&#x27;i as well. The most prominent character in NCIS Hawai&#x27;i from HPD was , who served on the Narcotics Task Force.

<text>Toby Stephens is an English actor who has appeared in films in the United Kingdom, United States, and India. He is known for the roles of Bond villain Gustav Graves in the 2002 James Bond film &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, for which he was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor; William Gordon in the 2005 &quot;Mangal Pandey: The Rising&quot; film; and Edward Fairfax Rochester in the 2006 BBC television adaptation of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. From 2014 to 2017, he starred as Captain Flint in the Starz television series &quot;Black Sails&quot;, followed by one of the lead roles in the Netflix science fiction series &quot;Lost in Space&quot; from 2018 to 2021. He has starred as the Greek God Poseidon in &quot;Percy Jackson and the Olympians&quot;.

== Early life and education ==

Toby Stephens, the younger son of actors Dame Maggie Smith and Sir Robert Stephens, was born in London. 

He was educated at Aldro School and Seaford College in West Sussex. 

He then trained at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA).

== Career ==
Stephens began his film career with the role of Othello in 1992, in Sally Potter&#x27;s &quot;Orlando&quot;. He has since made regular appearances on television (including in &quot;The Camomile Lawn&quot;, 1992) and on stage. 

He played the title role in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of &quot;Coriolanus&quot; shortly after graduation from LAMDA; that same season he played Claudio in &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; for the RSC. He played Stanley Kowalski in a West End production of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, and &quot;Hamlet&quot; in 2004. He has appeared on Broadway in &quot;Ring Round the Moon&quot;. He played the lead in the film &quot;Photographing Fairies&quot; and played Orsino in Trevor Nunn&#x27;s 1996 film adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. In 2002, he took on the role of Gustav Graves in the James Bond film &quot;Die Another Day&quot;. Aged 33 at the time of film&#x27;s release, he remains the youngest actor to have played a Bond villain. The following year, he depicted British double-agent Kim Philby in the BBC miniseries &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot;, co-starring with Tom Hollander, Samuel West, and Rupert Penry-Jones. 

In 2005, he played the role of a British Army captain in the Indian film, &quot;The Rising: Ballad of Mangal Pandey&quot;, portraying events in the Indian rebellion of 1857. The following year he returned to India to play a renegade British East India Company officer in &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Challenge&quot;. In late 2006, he starred as Edward Rochester in the highly acclaimed BBC television adaptation of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (broadcast in the United States on PBS in early 2007) and &quot;The Wild West&quot; in February 2007 for the BBC in which he played General George Armstrong Custer in &quot;Custer&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;. 

During mid-2007, Stephens played the role of Jerry in a revival of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Betrayal&quot; under the direction of Roger Michell. Later that year, Stephens starred as Horner in Jonathan Kent&#x27;s revival of William Wycherley&#x27;s &quot;The Country Wife&quot;. The play was the inaugural production of the Theatre Royal Haymarket Company.
In February 2008, the Fox Broadcasting Company gave the go-ahead to cast Stephens as the lead in a potential one-hour, primetime US television show, &quot;Inseparable&quot;, to be produced by Shaun Cassidy. Billed as a modern Jekyll and Hyde story, the show was to feature a partially paralysed forensic psychologist whose other personality is a charming criminal. Stephens&#x27; casting was highly unusual, because Fox had not yet approved a script nor purchased a pilot for the show. However, in mid-May 2008, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced that &quot;[b]y the time the network picked up the pilot (...) [the producers&#x27;] hold on Stephens had expired (...)&quot;

In May 2008, Stephens performed the role of James Bond in a BBC Radio 4 production of Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Dr. No&quot;, as part of the centenary celebration of Fleming&#x27;s birth. The production was reportedly the first BBC radio dramatisation of the novel though &quot;Moonraker&quot; was on South African radio in 1956, with Bob Holness providing the voice of Bond. He has since appeared in a number of adaptations of other James Bond novels. 

Also in May 2008, Stock-pot Productions announced that Stephens would have the lead role in a feature-length film entitled &quot;Fly Me&quot;, co-starring Tim McInnerny. Stock-pot was the producer of &quot;One Day&quot;, a short 2006 film shown at international film festivals, in which Stephens played a small part as the boss of McInnerny&#x27;s character. 

On 5 October 2008, Stephens appeared on stage at the London Palladium as part of a benefit entitled &quot;The Story of James Bond, A Tribute to Ian Fleming&quot;. The event, organised by Fleming&#x27;s niece, Lucy Fleming, featured music from various James Bond films and Bond film stars reading from Fleming&#x27;s Bond novels. Stephens took the part of James Bond himself in the readings. 

In early December 2008, Stephens read from &quot;Coda&quot;, the last book written by friend Simon Gray, for BBC Radio 4. The excerpts from which Stephens read included Gray&#x27;s description of his participation as godfather at the christening of Stephens&#x27; son Eli. 

Early in 2009, Stephens appeared as Prince John in season 3 of the BBC series &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. The series aired on BBC America in the United States. Stephens appeared in two episodes of a six-part television series, &quot;Strike Back&quot;, based on the novel by Chris Ryan. The series aired in May 2010. 

In mid-2009, Stephens returned to the London stage in the Donmar Warehouse production of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; alongside Gillian Anderson and Christopher Eccleston.

In 2010, he starred in the made-for-television film &quot;The Blue Geranium&quot;, a further sequel to the television series and films based on Agatha Christie&#x27;s Miss Marple character. The show was broadcast in the US on PBS in June 2010. Stephens starred as a highly self-centred detective opposite Lucy Punch in a three-part comedy television series for BBC Two entitled &quot;Vexed&quot;.

Stephens took on a small supporting role in a short film, &quot;The Lost Explorer&quot;, the directorial debut of photographer Tim Walker. The film is based on a short story by author Patrick McGrath.

On the London stage in the spring of 2010, Stephens received outstanding reviews for his performance as Henry in a revival of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;The Real Thing&quot;, directed by Anna Mackmin at the Old Vic Theatre in London. Of debuting at the Old Vic, where his parents performed as part of Laurence Olivier&#x27;s Royal National Theatre Company.

In 2010, Stephens appeared as Georges Danton in &quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot;. The play was another debut for Stephens, this time at London&#x27;s Royal National Theatre.

Over the years, Stephens has continued to prolifically narrate audiobooks and perform in broadcast radio dramas. In January 2011, Stephens joined other stars in narrating portions of the King James Version of the Bible for BBC Radio 4 as part of a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the Bible&#x27;s publication. Stephens performed the role of Raymond Chandler&#x27;s Philip Marlowe in a radio serial, which debuted in February 2011. Stephens narrated another audiobook, &quot;Paul Temple and the Geneva Mystery&quot;, released in February 2011. 

From 2014 to 2017, Stephens starred as Captain James Flint in the Starz television series &quot;Black Sails&quot;, a prequel to &quot;Treasure Island,&quot; set in the early 18th century during the Golden Age of Piracy.

In 2016, he was cast as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair in the film &quot;The Journey&quot;.

Between 2018 and 2021, he appeared as John Robinson in &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, the Netflix remake of the 1965 TV series. In 2021, he featured as Damian Cray in the second season of &quot;Alex Rider&quot;.

He appeared as the Greek God Poseidon in the series &quot;Percy Jackson and the Olympians&quot;, the Disney+ adaption of the books by the same name.

== Personal life ==
Stephens and New Zealand-born actress Anna-Louise Plowman were married in 2001. Their first child, a son, was born in 2007. The British playwright Simon Gray (who wrote &quot;Japes&quot;, a stage play, and &quot;Missing Dates&quot;, a radio drama, both of which starred Stephens) was reported to be Eli&#x27;s godfather. Their daughters were born in 2009 and 2010, respectively.

Plowman and Stephens performed together as Sibyl and Elyot in Jonathan Kent&#x27;s revival of &quot;Private Lives&quot; – the Noël Coward play in which his mother starred in 1975 on Broadway – for the 2012 Chichester Festival, reprised at the Gielgud Theatre in 2013.

<text>In research design, especially in psychology, social sciences, life sciences and physics, operationalization or operationalisation is a process of defining the measurement of a phenomenon which is not directly measurable, though its existence is inferred from other phenomena. Operationalization thus defines a fuzzy concept so as to make it clearly distinguishable, measurable, and understandable by empirical observation. In a broader sense, it defines the extension of a concept—describing what is and is not an instance of that concept. For example, in medicine, the phenomenon of health might be operationalized by one or more indicators like body mass index or tobacco smoking. As another example, in visual processing the presence of a certain object in the environment could be inferred by measuring specific features of the light it reflects. In these examples, the phenomena are difficult to directly observe and measure because they are general/abstract (as in the example of health) or they are latent (as in the example of the object). Operationalization helps infer the existence, and some elements of the extension, of the phenomena of interest by means of some observable and measurable effects they have.

Sometimes multiple or competing alternative operationalizations for the same phenomenon are available. Repeating the analysis with one operationalization after the other can determine whether the results are affected by different operationalizations. This is called checking robustness. If the results are (substantially) unchanged, the results are said to be &quot;robust against certain alternative operationalizations&quot; of the checked variables.
The concept of operationalization was first presented by the British physicist N. R. Campbell in his &#x27;Physics: The Elements&#x27; (Cambridge, 1920). This concept spread to humanities and social sciences. It remains in use in physics.

==Theory==
===History===
Operationalization is the scientific practice of &quot;operational definition&quot;, where even the most basic concepts are defined through the operations by which we measure them. The practice originated in the field of physics with the philosophy of science book &quot;The Logic of Modern Physics&quot; (1927), by Percy Williams Bridgman, whose methodological position is called &quot;operationalism&quot;.

Bridgman wrote that in the theory of relativity a concept like &quot;duration&quot; can split into multiple different concepts. In refining a physical theory, it may be discovered that what was thought to be one concept is actually two or more distinct concepts. Bridgman proposed that if only operationally defined concepts are used, this will never happen.

Bridgman&#x27;s theory was criticized because &quot;length&quot; is measured in various ways (e.g. it is impossible to use a measuring rod to measure the distance to the Moon), so &quot;length&quot; logically is not &quot;one&quot; concept but &quot;many&quot;, with some concepts requiring knowledge of geometry. Each concept is to be &quot;defined by&quot; the measuring operation used. So the criticism is that there are potentially infinite concepts, each defined by the methods that measured it, such as angle of sighting, day of the solar year, angular subtense of the moon, etc. which were gathered together, some astronomical observations taken over a period of thousands of years.

In the 1930s, Harvard experimental psychologist Edwin Boring and students Stanley Smith Stevens and Douglas McGregor, struggling with the methodological and epistemological problems of defining measurement of psychological phenomena, found a solution in reformulating psychological concepts operationally, as it had been proposed in the field of physics by Bridgman, their Harvard colleague. This resulted in a series of articles that were published by Stevens and McGregor from 1935, that were widely discussed in the field of psychology and led to the &quot;Symposium on operationism&quot; in 1945, to which Bridgman also contributed.

===Operationalization===
The practical &#x27;operational definition&#x27; is generally understood as relating to the theoretical definitions that describe reality through the use of theory.

The importance of careful operationalization can perhaps be more clearly seen in the development of General Relativity. Einstein discovered that there were two operational definitions of &quot;mass&quot; being used by scientists: &quot;inertial&quot;, defined by applying a force and observing the acceleration, from Newton&#x27;s Second Law of Motion; and &quot;gravitational&quot;, defined by putting the object on a scale or balance. Previously, no one had paid any attention to the different operations used because they always produced the same results, but the key insight of Einstein was to posit the Principle of Equivalence that the two operations would always produce the same result because they were equivalent at a deep level, and work out the implications of that assumption, which is the General Theory of Relativity. Thus, a breakthrough in science was achieved by disregarding different operational definitions of scientific measurements and realizing that they both described a single theoretical concept. Einstein&#x27;s disagreement with the operationalist approach was criticized by Bridgman as follows: &quot;Einstein did not carry over into his general relativity theory the lessons and insights he himself has taught us in his special theory.&quot; (p. 335).

==In the social sciences==
Operationalization is often used in the social sciences as part of the scientific method and psychometrics. Particular concerns about operationalization arise in cases that deal with complex concepts and complex stimuli (e.g., business research, software engineering) where unique threats to validity of operationalization are believed to exist.

===Anger example===
For example, a researcher may wish to measure the concept &quot;anger.&quot; Its presence, and the depth of the emotion, cannot be directly measured by an outside observer because anger is intangible. Rather, other measures are used by outside observers, such as facial expression, choice of vocabulary, loudness and tone of voice.

If a researcher wants to measure the depth of &quot;anger&quot; in various persons, the most direct operation would be to ask them a question, such as &quot;are you angry&quot;, or &quot;how angry are you?&quot;. This operation is problematic, however, because it depends upon the definition of the individual. Some people might be subjected to a mild annoyance, and become slightly angry, but describe themselves as &quot;extremely angry,&quot; whereas others might be subjected to a severe provocation, and become very angry, but describe themselves as &quot;slightly angry.&quot; In addition, in many circumstances it is impractical to ask subjects whether they are angry.

Since one of the measures of anger is loudness, the researcher can operationalize the concept of anger by measuring how loudly the subject speaks compared to his normal tone. However, this must assume that loudness is a uniform measure. Some might respond verbally while others might respond physically.

===Economics objections===
One of the main critics of operationalism in social science argues that &quot;the original goal was to eliminate the subjective mentalistic concepts that had dominated earlier psychological theory and to replace them with a more operationally meaningful account of human behavior. But, as in economics, the supporters ultimately ended up &quot;turning operationalism inside out&quot;. &quot;Instead of replacing &#x27;metaphysical&#x27; terms such as &#x27;desire&#x27; and &#x27;purpose&#x27;&quot; they &quot;used it to legitimize them by giving them operational definitions.&quot; Thus in psychology, as in economics, the initial, quite radical operationalist ideas eventually came to serve as little more than a &quot;reassurance fetish&quot; for mainstream methodological practice.&quot;

==Tying to conceptual frameworks==
The above discussion links operationalization to measurement of concepts. Many scholars have worked to operationalize concepts like job satisfaction, prejudice, anger etc. Scale and index construction are forms of operationalization. There is not one perfect way to operationalize. For example, in the United States the concept distance driven would be operationalized as miles, whereas kilometers would be used in Europe.

Operationalization is part of the empirical research process. An example is the empirical research question of if job satisfaction influences job turnover. Both job satisfaction and job turnover need to be measured. The concepts and their relationship are important — operationalization occurs within a larger framework of concepts. When there is a large empirical research question or purpose the conceptual framework that organizes the response to the question must be operationalized before the data collection can begin. If a scholar constructs a questionnaire based on a conceptual framework, they have operationalized the framework. Most serious empirical research should involve operationalization that is transparent and linked to a conceptual framework.

Another example, the hypothesis &quot;Job satisfaction reduces job turnover&quot; is one way to connect (or frame) two concepts – job satisfaction and job turnover. The process of moving from the idea &quot;job satisfaction&quot; to the set of questionnaire items that form a job satisfaction scale is operationalization. For example, it is possible to measure job satisfaction using only two simple questions: &quot;All in all, I am satisfied with my job&quot;, and, &quot;In general, I like my job.&quot;

Operationalization uses a different logic when testing a formal (quantitative) hypothesis and testing working hypothesis (qualitative). For formal hypotheses the concepts are represented empirically (or operationalized) as numeric variables and tested using inferential statistics. Working hypotheses (particularly in the social and administrative sciences), however, are tested through evidence collection and the assessment of the evidence. The evidence is generally collected within the context of a case study. The researcher asks if the evidence is sufficient to &quot;support&quot; the working hypothesis. Formal operationalization would specify the kinds of evidence needed to support the hypothesis as well as evidence which would &quot;fail&quot; to support it. Robert Yin recommends developing a case study protocol as a way to specify the kinds of evidence needed during the data collection phases. He identifies six sources of evidence: documentation; archival records; interviews; direct observations; participant observation and physical or cultural artifacts.

In the field of public administration, Shields and Tajalli (2006) have identified five kinds of conceptual frameworks (working hypothesis, descriptive categories, practical ideal type, operations research, and formal hypothesis). They explain and illustrate how each of these conceptual frameworks can be operationalized. They also show how to make conceptualization and operationalization more concrete by demonstrating how to form conceptual framework tables that are tied to the literature and operationalization tables that lay out the specifics of how to operationalize the conceptual framework (measure the concepts).

<text>Lophotrochozoa (, &quot;crest/wheel animals&quot;) is a clade of protostome animals within the Spiralia. The taxon was established as a monophyletic group based on molecular evidence. The clade includes animals like annelids, molluscs, bryozoans, and brachiopods.

==Groups==
Lophotrochozoa was defined in 1995 as the &quot;last common ancestor of the three traditional lophophorate taxa (brachiopods, bryozoans, and phoronid worms), the mollusks and the annelids, and all of the descendants of that common ancestor&quot;. It is a cladistic definition (a node-based name), so the affiliation to Lophotrochozoa of spiralian groups not mentioned directly in the definition depends on the topology of the spiralian tree of life, and in some phylogenetic hypotheses, Lophotrochozoa may even be synonymous to Spiralia. Nemertea and Orthonectida (if not directly considered as part of Annelida) are probably lophotrochozoan phyla; Dicyemida, Gastrotricha, and Platyhelminthes may be lophotrochozoans or placed in the Rouphozoa clade outside Lophotrochozoa; Chaetognatha, Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, and Syndermata are probably gnathiferans and so placed as a basal spiralian clade outside Lophotrochozoa; Cycliophora could be a gnathiferan or a lophotrochozoan phylum. One of the candidate hypotheses is presented below.

The Lophotrochozoa has basal Cycliophora and Mollusca groups, and more derived Lophophorate, Nemertea and Annelida groups.

With the introduction of Platytrochozoa and Rouphozoa, one candidate phylogeny is pictured below – though other studies recover a range of alternative possibilities:

In the most recent research, the three phyla Cycliophora, Entoprocta and Bryozoa makes up a single clade and are the first to branch off from the other lophotrochozoans. The second split is the molluscs, and the third consists of two sister phyla, annelids and nemerteans. Lastly remains the clade that consist of the phoronids and the brachiopods.

Another study recovers Lophotrochozoa as equivalent to Platytrochozoa, forming a sister group with Gnathifera at the base of Spiralia.

A number of fossil taxa can be identified as early Lophotrochozoans, even if their precise affinity remains contested. However, relevant Cambrian fossils are debated.

==Characteristics==

The clade Lophotrochozoa is named after the two distinct characteristics of its members; the lophophore, a feeding structure consisting of a ciliated crown of tentacles surrounding a mouth, and the developmental stage of the trochophore larva. Lophophorata such as Brachiozoa and Bryozoa have lophophores, while members of Trochozoa such as molluscs and annelids have trochophore larvae, although some may have none.

<doc id="747370" wikidata="Q340003" url="?curid=747370" title="Buridan's ass">
<text>Buridan&#x27;s ass is an illustration of a paradox in philosophy in the conception of free will. It refers to a hypothetical situation wherein an ass (or donkey) that is equally hungry and thirsty is placed precisely midway between a stack of hay and a pail of water. Since the paradox assumes the ass will always go to whichever is closer, it dies of both hunger and thirst since it cannot make any rational decision between the hay and water. A common variant of the paradox substitutes the hay and water for two identical piles of hay; the ass, unable to choose between the two, dies of hunger.

The paradox is named after the 14th-century French philosopher Jean Buridan, whose philosophy of moral determinism it satirizes. 
Although the illustration is named after Buridan, philosophers have discussed the concept before him, notably Aristotle, who put forward the example of a man equally hungry and thirsty, and Al-Ghazali, who used a man faced with the choice of equally good dates.

A version of this situation appears as metastability in digital electronics, when an electric circuit must decide between two states based on an input that is in itself undefined (neither zero nor one). Metastability becomes a problem if the circuit spends more time than it should in this &quot;undecided&quot; state, which is usually set by the speed of the clock the system is using.

==History==
The paradox predates Buridan; it dates to antiquity, being found in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;On the Heavens&quot;. Aristotle, in ridiculing the Sophist idea that the Earth is stationary simply because it is spherical and any forces on it must be equal in all directions, says that is as ridiculous as saying that

However, the Greeks only used this paradox as an analogy in the context of the equilibrium of &quot;physical&quot; forces. The 12th-century Persian scholar and philosopher Al-Ghazali discusses the application of this paradox to human decision making, asking whether it is possible to make a choice between equally good courses without grounds for preference. He takes the attitude that free will can break the stalemate.
Andalusian philosopher Averroes (1126–1198), in commentary on Ghazali, takes the opposite view. Although Buridan nowhere discusses this specific problem, its relevance is that he did advocate a moral determinism whereby, save for ignorance or impediment, a human faced by alternative courses of action must always choose the greater good. In the face of equally good alternatives Buridan believed a rational choice could not be made. 
Later writers satirised this view in terms of an ass which, confronted by both food and water, must necessarily die of both hunger and thirst while pondering a decision.

Many later philosophers have addressed this problem of &quot;choice without preference&quot;. In his &quot;Ethics&quot; (), Baruch de Spinoza accepts that his determinist philosophy implies that such a state of indecision could happen, but that this should be classed with other irrational behavior: 
Pierre Bayle (1647–1706) in his &quot;Dictionnaire&quot; authored some of the most comprehensive discussions of the problem. He recognized explicitly that if humans have the ability to make a decision between choices with no reason for preference, this means that humans have free will, and bears on man&#x27;s rationalization of God&#x27;s choices. He regarded the previous examples of the ass or dates as artificial, and pointed out there are many real instances in everyday life in which a person must make a choice in which the choice doesn&#x27;t matter to him, and that this presents no problem.

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) believed, from his principle of sufficient reason, that if a person&#x27;s preferences were really balanced no decision could be made, but that &quot;petites perceptions&quot;, small perceived preferences below the threshold of consciousness that are always present, explains why people are able to make such a choice.

==Discussion==
Some proponents of hard determinism such as Spinoza have granted the unpleasantness of the scenario, but have denied that it illustrates a true paradox, since one does not contradict oneself in suggesting that a man might die between two equally plausible routes of action. 

Other writers have opted to deny the validity of the illustration. A typical counter-argument is that rationality as described in the paradox is so limited as to be a straw man version of the real thing, which does allow the consideration of meta-arguments. In other words, it is entirely rational to recognize that both choices are equally good and arbitrarily (randomly) pick one instead of starving; although the decision that they are sufficiently the same is also subject to Buridan&#x27;s ass. The idea that a random decision could be made is sometimes used as an attempted justification for faith or intuitivity (called by Aristotle noetic or ). The argument is that, like the starving ass, we must make a choice to avoid being frozen in endless doubt. Other counter-arguments exist.

According to Edward Lauzinger, Buridan&#x27;s ass fails to incorporate the latent biases that humans always bring with them when making decisions.

Social psychologist Kurt Lewin&#x27;s field theory treated this paradox experimentally. He demonstrated that lab rats experience difficulty when choosing between two equally attractive (approach–approach) goals. The typical response to approach–approach decisions is initial ambivalence, though the decision becomes more decisive as the organism moves towards one choice and away from another.

==Buridan&#x27;s principle==
The situation of Buridan&#x27;s ass was given a mathematical basis in a 1984 paper by American computer scientist Leslie Lamport, in which Lamport presents an argument that, given certain assumptions about continuity in a simple mathematical model of the Buridan&#x27;s ass problem, there is always some starting condition under which the ass starves to death, no matter what strategy it takes. He further illustrates the paradox with the example of a driver stopped at a railroad crossing trying to decide whether he has time to cross before a train arrives. He proves that regardless of how &quot;safe&quot; the policy the driver adopts, because indecision can cause an indefinite delay in action a small percentage of drivers will be hit by the train.

Lamport calls this result &quot;Buridan’s principle&quot;:
:A discrete decision based upon an input having a continuous range of values cannot be made within a bounded length of time.

He points out that just because we do not see asses or people starving to death through indecision, or other examples of Buridan&#x27;s undecided states in real life, does not disprove the principle. The persistence of a Buridan&#x27;s undecided state for a perceptible length of time may just be sufficiently improbable that it has not been observed.

==Application to digital logic: metastability==

A version of Buridan&#x27;s principle occurs in electrical engineering. Specifically, the input to a digital logic gate must convert a continuous voltage value into either a 0 or a 1, which is typically sampled and then processed. If the input is changing and at an intermediate value when sampled, the input stage acts like a comparator. The voltage value can then be likened to the position of the ass, and the values 0 and 1 represent the bales of hay. As in the situation of the starving ass, there exists an input on which the converter cannot make a proper decision, and the output remains balanced in a metastable state between the two stable states for an undetermined length of time, until random noise in the circuit makes it converge to one of the stable states.

In asynchronous circuits, arbiters are used to make the decision. They guarantee that up to one outcome is selected at any given point in time, but may take an indeterminate (albeit typically extremely short) time to choose.

The metastability problem is a significant issue in digital circuit design, and metastable states are a possibility wherever asynchronous inputs (digital signals not synchronized to a clock signal) occur. The ultimate reason the problem is manageable is that the probability of a metastable state persisting longer than a given time interval &quot;t&quot; is an exponentially declining function of &quot;t&quot;. In electronic devices, the probability of such an &quot;undecided&quot; state lasting longer than a matter of nanoseconds, while always possible, can be made negligibly low.

==In popular culture==

* &quot;Buridan&#x27;s Ass&quot; is the name of the sixth episode of the first season of the FX television series &quot;Fargo&quot;.
* &quot;Buridan&#x27;s Donkey&quot;, a 1932 French comedy film, is named after the paradox.
* Lewis Cass, the Democratic candidate for the U.S. presidency in 1848, was contrasted with Buridan&#x27;s ass by Abraham Lincoln: &quot;Mr. Speaker, we have all heard of the animal standing in doubt between two stacks of hay, and starving to death. The like would never happen to General Cass; place the stacks a thousand miles apart, he would stand stock still midway between them, and eat them both at once, and the green grass along the line would be apt to suffer some too at the same time.&quot; (This being a reference to Cass&#x27;s support for &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; in the run-up to the Civil War.)
* Aleksander Fredro, Polish 19th-century poet, tells a story about a donkey who died from hunger because he could not decide between oats and hay, served in two troughs.
* In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel &quot;The Eight Doctors&quot;, the Fifth and Eighth Doctors are confronted by a Raston Warrior Robot. The Doctors stand exactly the same distance away from the Robot as it approaches them; unable to decide which to attack first (since the Robot attacks by sensing brain patterns, which are identical in the two Doctors), the Robot shuts down.
* The lyrics of a song by Devo, the title track from their album &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot;, describe a similar situation: &quot;In ancient Rome, there was a poem / About a dog who found two bones&quot; who then, unable to choose between the two, &quot;went in circles till he dropped dead.&quot;
* In episode 7 of the 10th season of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, Sheldon and Amy discuss the history of Buridan&#x27;s ass (renamed donkey), and its application to their lives. Amy resolves the paradox (of Sheldon desiring to live in different apartments) by creating a more desirable option by engaging Sheldon in a discussion of the theory and its history.
* On episode 2 of the third season of &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot; (&quot;Kimmy&#x27;s Roommate Lemonades&quot;), Kimmy learns about Buridan&#x27;s Ass from Perry, a possible love interest and also a tour guide for prospective students at Robert Moses College for Everyone.
* In &quot;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&quot;, a note can be found on a notice board from a farmer that is selling the meat of his donkey, who died of starvation because it was unable to decide between two different piles of food.
* In the episode &quot;Peace, Pity, Pardon&quot; of the show &quot;Route 66&quot;, Lincoln Case told his buddy Todd Stiles that he wasn&#x27;t sure he wanted his discharge papers from the army or if he wanted to re-enlist after being on leave. Stiles then related the story of Buridan&#x27;s ass, but wrongly attributed the theory to a Greek philosopher. After telling Case about Buridan&#x27;s ass, he said that &quot;indecision has killed more cats than curiosity.&quot;

<doc id="747376" wikidata="Q3525932" url="?curid=747376" title="Three Choirs Festival">
<text>The Three Choirs Festival is a music festival held annually at the end of July, rotating among the cathedrals of the Three Counties (Hereford, Gloucester, and Worcester) and originally featuring their three choirs, which remain central to the week-long programme. The large-scale choral repertoire is now performed by the Festival Chorus, but the festival also features other major ensembles and international soloists. The 2011 festival took place in Worcester from 6 to 13 August. The 2012 festival in Hereford took place earlier than usual, from 21 to 28 July, to avoid clashing with the 2012 Summer Olympics. The event is now established in the last week of July. The 300th anniversary of the original Three Choirs Festival was celebrated during the 2015 festival, which took place from 25 July to 1 August in Hereford (the landmark 300th meeting of the Three Choirs does not fall until after 2027 due to there being no Three Choirs Festivals for the duration of both World War I and World War II and COVID-19. The 2023 Festival took place in Gloucester from 22nd to 29th July.

The festival is closely identified with the musical careers of British composers Edward Elgar and Ralph Vaughan Williams. The organists of the three cathedrals (who act as artistic director and festival conductor when it is their cathedral&#x27;s turn to host the festival) are Geraint Bowen (Hereford), Adrian Partington (Gloucester), and Samuel Hudson (Worcester).

==History==
The festival, originally held over two days in September (but also held in September in 1933 and 1947, since C. S. Lewis&#x27;s brother Warren is known to have attended), is one of the world&#x27;s oldest classical choral music festivals. Originally called the Annual Music Meeting of the Three Choirs, the first is believed to have been held in Gloucester in 1715. Publicity for it in 1719 addressed &quot;Members of the yearly Musical Assembly in these parts&quot;. Its music obviously tended towards the ecclesiastical. In early gatherings, Purcell&#x27;s setting of the &quot;Te Deum&quot; and &quot;Jubilate&quot; was a regular part of the repertoire until 1784, and Handel dominated 18th-century programmes with oratorios such as &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Feast&quot;, &quot;Samson&quot;, &quot;Judas Maccabaeus,&quot; and &quot;Messiah&quot;. Sir Samuel Hellier, guardian of the Hellier Stradivarius, was a &quot;prominent figure&quot;. Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Creation&quot; was heard first in the festival of 1800. From 1840, Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot; was performed every year until 1930.

The 19th century saw the introduction of Rossini, Mozart, and Beethoven, and the festival&#x27;s fortunes were enhanced by the arrival of the railways. However, these also brought crowds, a phenomenon not always pleasing to the church authorities, although full seats uplifted the finances. In the 1870s, the festival was reduced to the three cathedral choirs, ending for a while the era of the visiting celebrity singer as a faction in the church sought to stress the &quot;appropriate&quot; nature of activities allowed in cathedrals. However, the civil authorities took issue with the ecclesiastical and the festival revived. Works by J. S. Bach were not heard until the 1870s, soon to be followed by local (Worcestershire-born) composer Elgar, who began to be featured around the turn of the century and whose works dominated the festival for much of the 20th century as its emphasis shifted toward British musicians. Herbert Sumsion, organist at Gloucester between 1928 and 1967, particularly helped to promote the works of native composers, including premiering works of Howells, Finzi, and others. Parry&#x27;s compositions were also performed regularly. His &quot;De Profundis&quot; was one of the earliest works to be commissioned especially for the festival and performed in 1891.

Delius in 1901 was another composer who introduced or conducted new works, with his &quot;Dance Rhapsody No. 1&quot;. Another was Ralph Vaughan Williams, whose &quot;Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis&quot; was premiered there in 1910, followed by the &quot;Five Mystical Songs&quot; in 1911 and the &quot;Fantasia on Christmas Carols&quot; in 1912, after which he co-featured with Elgar as a central prop to the musical repertoire. Sumsion fostered a relationship with Hungarian composer Zoltán Kodály and programmed Kodály&#x27;s works at six Gloucester festivals. Other names include Gustav Holst, Arthur Sullivan, Herbert Howells, Gerald Finzi, William Walton, Arthur Bliss, and Benjamin Britten and recently, Lennox Berkeley, John McCabe, William Mathias, Paul Patterson, and James MacMillan.

A timeline of some of the more significant events in the festival&#x27;s history from 1709 until the present day has been compiled by Anthony Boden: Three Choirs Festival timeline

In 1996, a Festival Society was established to provide a means for enthusiasts to actively participate in support for the Three Choirs Festival. The festival is funded by ticket sales, donations and sponsorships.

In 2010, the Three Choirs Festival Youth Choir was formed. Made up of singers aged 16–25, it has performed at every festival since then, under a variety of conductors. In 2012 in Hereford the Three Choirs Festival Youth Choir premiered &quot;Centuries of Meditation&quot;, a setting by Dobrinka Tabakova of words by Thomas Traherne.

The Philharmonia Orchestra began a rolling three-year formal residency at the festival in 2012.

In July 2019, it was reported that the programming of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; for the finale of the festival had prompted anger amongst Brexiteers, due to its use as the Anthem of Europe. The concert, unlike the other major musical events at the festival, did not sell out. 

In 2021, the Festival included the première of Steve Elcock&#x27;s Eighth Symphony.

<text>Maksymilian Rafailovych &quot;Max&quot; Levchin (born July 11, 1975) is a Ukrainian-American software engineer and businessman. In 1998, he co-founded the company that eventually became PayPal. Levchin made contributions to PayPal&#x27;s anti-fraud efforts and was the co-creator of the Gausebeck-Levchin test, one of the first commercial implementations of a CAPTCHA challenge response human test.

He founded or co-founded the companies Slide.com, HVF, and Affirm. He was an early investor in Yelp and was their largest shareholder in 2012. He left a leadership role in Yelp in 2015.

Levchin was a producer for the movie &quot;Thank You for Smoking&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born in Kyiv, then part of the Ukrainian SSR, to a Ukrainian-Jewish family, Levchin moved to the United States and settled in Chicago in 1991. In an interview with Emily Chang of &quot;Bloomberg&quot;, Levchin discussed his overcoming adversity as a child. He had respiratory problems and doctors doubted his chance of living. With guidance from his grandmother and his parents he took up the clarinet to expand his lung capacity. He attended Mather High School, and then the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in computer science in 1997.

==Business career==
In the summer of 1995, Levchin and fellow University of Illinois students Luke Nosek and Scott Banister founded SponsorNet New Media.

===PayPal===
In 1998, Levchin and Peter Thiel founded Fieldlink, a security company that allowed users to store encrypted data on their PalmPilots and other PDA devices for handheld devices to serve as &quot;digital wallets&quot;. After changing the company name to Confinity, they developed a popular payment product known as PayPal and focused on digital transfers of funds by PDA. The company merged with X.com in 2000, and in 2001, the company adopted the name PayPal after its main product. PayPal, Inc. went public in February 2002, and in July 2002 was acquired by eBay. Levchin&#x27;s 2.3% stake in PayPal was worth approximately $34 million at the time of the acquisition.

Levchin is primarily known for his contributions to PayPal&#x27;s anti-fraud efforts and is also the co-creator of the Gausebeck-Levchin test, one of the first commercial implementations of a CAPTCHA.

In 2002, he was named to the &quot;MIT Technology Review&quot; TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35, as well as Innovator of the Year.

Levchin is one of a group of roughly twenty founders and former employees of PayPal who have become referred to as the &quot;PayPal Mafia&quot;, due to their success in founding and investing in tech companies after leaving PayPal.

===Slide===
In 2004, Levchin founded Slide, a personal media-sharing service for social networking sites such as Myspace and Facebook. Slide was sold to Google in August 2010 for $182 million and, on August 25, Levchin joined the company as vice president of engineering. On August 26, 2011, Google announced it was shutting down Slide, and that Levchin was leaving the company.

===HVF and Affirm===
In late 2011, Levchin started a company called HVF (standing for &quot;Hard, Valuable, and Fun&quot;) that was intended to explore and fund projects and companies in the area of leveraging data, such as data from analog sensors.

In early 2012, the financial technology company Affirm was spun out of HVF, with the goal of building the next-generation credit network. Affirm was created by Levchin, Palantir Technologies co-founder Nathan Gettings, and Jeff Kaditz of First Data. The company is based in San Francisco.

In 2013, HVF launched Glow, a fertility app that helps couples conceive naturally.
After Affirm had its initial public offering, Levchin&#x27;s stake was estimated at about $2.5 billion.

==Board memberships and investments==
Levchin was a key early investor in Yelp, an online social networking and review service that started in 2004. He was the company&#x27;s largest shareholder, owning more than 7 million shares as of 2012. Levchin served as chairman of Yelp&#x27;s board of directors from its founding, until July 2015. An angel investor in Mixpanel, its founder Suhail Doshi credits Levchin for Mixpanel&#x27;s survival and subsequent success.

Levchin is an investor in Evernote. He served on the company&#x27;s board of directors from August 7, 2006, to 2016.

In December 2012, Levchin joined Yahoo&#x27;s board of directors, and remained until December 2015.

In 2015, Levchin was appointed to the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) advisory board for a three-year term, making him the first executive from Silicon Valley to be appointed to the board. In 2021, Levchin, after his experience on the advisory board at the CFPB, called for the necessity for the tech industry to engage more with regulators.

As of 2021 Levchin had an estimated net worth of US$3 billion.

==In the media==
Levchin appeared as a speaker at the 2007 Startup School organized by Y Combinator, where he described his own journey as an entrepreneur and the mistakes he made and lessons he learned. Levchin was also featured in &quot;Brilliant Issue&quot; of &quot;Portfolio&quot; by Condé Nast Publications. In 2022 Levchin was interviewed in an NPR podcast called &quot;How I Built This&quot; where he spoke about his early life and business endeavors including his role in PayPal.

==Politics==
Levchin was listed as one of the contributors to FWD.us, a Silicon Valley–based lobbying group spearheaded by Mark Zuckerberg and Joe Green. The group is intended to concentrate on immigration liberalization for high-skilled immigrants to the United States, improvements to education, and facilitating technological breakthroughs with broad public benefits. Levchin also narrated his personal experience as an immigrant in a video released by the group.

In 2013, amidst the controversy over mass surveillance and NSA espionage activities, Levchin defended the NSA in opposition to views of many other tech entrepreneurs. According to him, the agency was designed to protect the US from terrorism, so even if it oversteps its bounds, the public should support it.

==Other activity==
Levchin arranged and financed the Levchin Prize which since 2016 rewards advancements in cryptography with a real-world impact.

==Personal life==
In 2008, Levchin married his longtime girlfriend, Nellie Minkova. He has two children. He lived in San Francisco from 2007 to 2019. In 2019, he listed his home in San Francisco for $7.25 million, which he originally purchased in 2007 for $5.3 million.

<doc id="747386" wikidata="Q429379" url="?curid=747386" title="Hereford Cathedral">
<text>Hereford Cathedral, formally the , is a Church of England cathedral in Hereford, England. It is the seat of the bishop of Hereford and the principal church of the diocese of Hereford. The cathedral is a grade I listed building.

A place of worship has existed on the site of the present building since the 8th century or earlier. The present building was begun in 1079. Substantial parts of the building date from both the Norman and the Gothic periods.

The cathedral has the largest library of chained books in the world, its most famous treasure being the &quot;Mappa Mundi&quot;, a medieval map of the world created around 1300. The map is listed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.

==Origins==
The cathedral is dedicated to two saints, St Mary the Virgin and St Ethelbert the King. The latter was beheaded by Offa, King of Mercia, in the year 794. Offa had consented to give his daughter to Ethelbert in marriage: why he changed his mind and deprived him of his head historians do not know, although tradition is at no loss to supply him with an adequate motive. The execution, or murder, is said to have taken place at Sutton, four miles (6 km) from Hereford, with Ethelbert&#x27;s body brought to the site of the modern cathedral by &quot;a pious monk&quot;. He was buried at the site of the cathedral. At Ethelbert&#x27;s tomb miracles were said to have occurred, and in the next century (about 830) Milfrid, a Mercian nobleman, was so moved by the tales of these marvels as to rebuild in stone the little church that stood there and to dedicate it to the sainted king.

Before this, Hereford had become the seat of a bishopric. It is said to have been the centre of a diocese as early as the 670s when Theodore of Tarsus, Archbishop of Canterbury, divided the Mercian diocese of Lichfield, founding Hereford for the Magonsæte and Worcester for the Hwicce. In the 7th century the cathedral was refounded by Putta, who settled there when driven from Rochester by Æthelred of Mercia. The cathedral of stone, which Milfrid raised, stood for some 200 years, and then, in the reign of Edward the Confessor, it was altered. The new church had only a short life, for it was plundered and burnt in 1056 by a combined force of Welsh and Irish under Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, the Welsh prince; it was not, however, destroyed until its custodians had offered vigorous resistance, in which seven of the canons were killed. 
==Norman period==
Hereford Cathedral remained in a state of ruin until Robert of Lorraine was consecrated as the diocese&#x27;s bishop in 1079 and undertook its reconstruction. His work was carried on or, more probably, redone by Reynelm who was the next but one bishop and who reorganised the college of secular canons attached to the cathedral. Reynelm died in 1115 and it was only under his third successor, Robert de Betun, who was bishop from 1131 to 1148, that the church was brought to completion.

Of this Norman church the surviving parts are the nave arcade, the choir up to the spring of the clerestory, the choir aisle, the south transept and the crossing arches. Scarcely 50 years after its completion William de Vere, who occupied the see from 1186 to 1199, altered the east end by constructing a retro-choir or processional path and a lady chapel.

==13th century==
Between the years 1226 and 1246, the Lady Chapel was rebuilt in the Early English style—with a crypt beneath. Around the middle of the century the clerestory, and probably the vaulting of the choir, were rebuilt, having been damaged by the settling of the central tower. Under Peter of Aigueblanche (bishop 1240–68), one of Henry III&#x27;s foreign favourites, the rebuilding of the north transept was begun, being completed later in the same century by Swinfield, who also built the aisles of the nave and eastern transept.

===Aquablanca===

Peter of Aigueblanche, also known as Aquablanca, was one of the most notable of the pre-reformation Bishops of Hereford, who left his mark upon the cathedral and the diocese. Aquablanca came to England in the train of Eleanor of Provence. He was a man of energy and resource; though he lavished money upon the cathedral and made a handsome bequest to the poor, it cannot be pretended that his qualifications for the office to which Henry III appointed him included piety. He was a nepotist who occasionally practised gross fraud.

When Prince Edward came to Hereford to deal with Llywelyn the Great of Gwynedd, Aquablanca was away in Ireland on a tithe-collecting expedition, and the dean and canons were also absent. Not long after Aquablanca&#x27;s return, which was probably expedited by the stern rebuke which the King administered, he and all his relatives from Savoy were seized within the cathedral by a party of barons, who deprived him of the money which he had extorted from the Irish.

===Thomas de Cantilupe===

Thomas de Cantilupe was the next but one Bishop of Hereford after Aquablanca. He had faults not uncommon in men who held high ecclesiastical office in his day, however he was a strenuous administrator of his see, and an unbending champion of its rights. For assaulting some of the episcopal tenants and raiding their cattle, Lord Clifford was condemned to walk barefoot through the cathedral to the high altar, and Cantilupe himself applied the rod to his back. Cantilupe also wrung from the Welsh king Llewellyn some manors which he had seized, and Cantilupe, after a successful lawsuit against the Earl of Gloucester to determine the possession of a chase near the Forest of Malvern, dug the dyke which can still be traced on the crest of the Malvern Hills. Excommunicated by John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury, he went to the papal court in Orvieto to plead his case with the pope. He moved with the court to Montefiascone where, already ill, he died in 1282 before his case was fully resolved. His flesh was buried in the monastery of San Severo outside Orvieto and his heart and bones were brought back to England. His bones were placed in a shrine at Hereford Cathedral where they became a focus of a large pilgrimage cult. Rome was urged to canonise him, and among the evidences of his saintliness which his admirers appealed to, in addition to the miracles of healing wrought at his shrine, were the facts that he had exhibited extreme dislike of the Jews and appealed for their expulsion, never ceased to wear his hair-shirt, and would never allow even his sister to kiss him. The testimony was regarded as conclusive, and 40 years after his death, in 1320, Cantilupe&#x27;s name was added to the roll of saints. His arms were adopted for those of the see.

Considerable work was done to the Cathedral at this time to accommodate his cult. Among the works believed to be associated with his cult are works to the north porch, which include the figures of Synagoga, representing the supposed blindness and obstinacy of the Jewish faith, and a bagpiper. It is also likely that the Hereford Mappa Mundi is associated with the cult; it also features antisemitic features.

==14th to 16th century: completion of the fabric==

In the first half of the 14th century the rebuilding of the central tower, which is embellished with ball-flower ornaments, was carried out. At about the same time the chapter house and its vestibule were built, then Thomas Trevenant, who was bishop from 1389 to 1404, rebuilt the south end and groining of the great transept. Around the middle of the 15th century a tower was added to the western end of the nave, and in the second half of this century bishops John Stanberry and Edmund Audley built three chantries, the former on the north side of the presbytery, the latter on the south side of the Lady Chapel. Later bishops Richard Mayew and Charles Booth, who between them ruled the diocese from 1504 to 1535, made the last additions to the cathedral by erecting the north porch, now forming the principal northern entrance. The building of the present edifice therefore extended over a period of 440 years.

==16th to 18th century==
In the war between King and Parliament (the English Civil War) the city of Hereford fell into the hands first of one party, then of the other. Once it endured a siege, and when it was taken the conquerors ran riot in the cathedral and, in their fury, caused great damage which could never be repaired. In the early years of the 18th century, Philip Bisse (bishop, 1712–21), devised a scheme to support the central tower. He also had installed a large altarpiece and an oak screen, and instead of restoring the Chapter House he allowed its stones to be utilised for alterations to the Bishop&#x27;s Palace.

It was during this period that his brother, Thomas Bisse, was the chancellor of the cathedral. In 1724 Thomas Bisse organised a &quot;Music Meeting&quot; which subsequently became, with the cathedrals at Worcester and Gloucester, the Three Choirs Festival.

===1786: Fall of the western tower===

On Easter Monday, 1786, the greatest disaster in the history of the cathedral took place. The west tower fell, creating a ruin of the whole of the west front and at least one bay of the nave. The tower, which, unlike the west tower of Ely, was in the west bay of the nave, had a general resemblance to the central tower; both were profusely covered with ball-flower ornaments, and both terminated in leaden spires. James Wyatt was called in to repair the damage. As he did at Durham, instead of just repairing, he made alterations which were (and are) not universally popular.

==19th-century restoration and 1904 reopening==
In 1841 the restoration work was begun, instigated by Dean Merewether, and was carried out by Lewis Nockalls Cottingham and his son, Nockalls. Bisse&#x27;s masonry, which by this time had been found to be useless, was swept away from the central tower, the lantern was strengthened and exposed to view, and much work was done in the nave and to the exterior of the Lady Chapel. When Nockalls Cottingham drowned on a voyage to New York in September 1854, George Gilbert Scott was called in, and from that time the work of restoring the choir was performed continuously until 1863, when (on 30 June) the cathedral was reopened with solemn services. Renn Hampden, Bishop of Hereford, preached in the morning and Samuel Wilberforce preached in the evening. In his diary, Wilberforce characterises his right reverend brother&#x27;s sermon as &quot;dull, but thoroughly orthodox&quot;; but of his own service he remarks (not without complacency), &quot;I preached evening; great congregation and much interested.&quot;

The west front was restored by John Oldrid Scott over the period 1902 and 1908.

Between them these restorations cost some £45,000, (). Since then much else has been done. &quot;Wyatt&#x27;s Folly&quot;, as James Wyatt&#x27;s west front was often called, has been replaced by a highly ornate façade in commemoration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, whose figure is to be seen at the beautiful stained glass which fills the seven-light (i.e. with seven main vertical &quot;lights&quot;, or sections of glass) window subscribed &quot;by the women of Hereford diocese&quot;.

==20th-century extensions==
A new library building was constructed in the early 1990s and opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1996. In 1967 with the new liturgical fashion, George Gilbert Scott&#x27;s iron choir screen was removed in pieces and discarded. It has since been restored and is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

==21st-century changes==
Work on a new Cathedral Green, with pathways, seating and gated entrance to the cathedral was undertaken in 2010 to 2011.

In 2015, landscaping and restoration efforts began at the cathedral, financed by the Heritage Lottery Fund. These efforts involved reburying thousands of corpses, some from 12th century to the 14th century stone-lined graves, from the cathedral burial plot. Unusually, from the Middle Ages until the 19th century, anyone who died on church grounds had to be buried within the precinct. Notable among those reburied during the restoration was a knight who may have participated in tourney jousting, a man with leprosy (it was unusual for lepers to be buried anywhere near a cathedral due to the stigma associated with the disease), and a woman with a severed hand (a typical punishment for a thief, who would normally be unlikely to receive cathedral burial).

==Dean and chapter==
As of 11 May 2022:
*Dean — Sarah Brown (since 2021 installation)
*Precentor – Andrew Piper (since 9 March 2003 installation)
*Chancellor – The Revd Canon James Pacey

Among eminent men who have been associated with the cathedral – besides those who have already been mentioned – are Robert of Gloucester, the chronicler, prebendary in 1291; Nicholas of Hereford, chancellor in 1377, a remarkable man and leader of the Lollards at Oxford; John Carpenter, town clerk of London who baptised there on 18 December 1378; Polydore Vergil, prebendary in 1507, a celebrated literary man, as indeed with such a name he ought to have been; and Miles Smith, prebendary in 1580, promoted to the See of Gloucester – one of the translators of the Authorized King James Version of the Bible.

Another famous prebendary was Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who was appointed to a stall in 1510. The list of post English Reformation prelates includes Matthew Wren, who, however was translated to Ely in the year of his consecration (1635); Nicholas Monck, a brother of the George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, who died within a few months of consecration (1661); and two bishops around whom ecclesiastical storms raged, Benjamin Hoadley and Renn Hampden. Hoadley, by his tract against the Non-jurors and his sermon on the Kingdom of Christ, provoked the Bangorian Controversy and so led to the virtual supersession of Convocation from 1717 to 1852; the appointment of Hampden to this see by Lord John Russell in 1847 was bitterly opposed by those who considered him latitudinarian, including the Dean of Hereford, and was appealed against in the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench. Hampden went his way, which was that of a student rather than that of an administrator, and ruled the diocese for 21 years, leaving behind him at his death, in 1868, the reputation of a great scholar and thinker.

==Description==
===Dimensions===
The exterior length of the church is , the interior length , the nave (up to the screen) measuring and the choir . The great transept is long, the east transept . The nave and choir (including the aisles) are wide; the nave is high, and the choir 62½ feet. The lantern is high, the tower 140½ feet, or with the pinnacles .

==Nave==
There is decorative work on the Norman architecture columns and arches of the nave built by Reynelm&#x27;s stonemasons. Until 1847 the pavement which had been laid down in the nave completely hid the square bases on which the piers rest. Double semi-cylindrical shafts run up their north and south faces, ending in small double capitals at the height of the capitals of the piers themselves. In the south aisle of the nave are two 14th-century church monument tombs, with effigies of unknown ecclesiastics. The tomb of Sir Richard Pembridge in the reign of Edward III, is an example of the armour of that period, and it is one of the earliest instances of an effigy wearing the garter. A square-headed doorway gives access from this aisle to the Bishop&#x27;s Cloister.

At the northern entrance is a porch and decorated doorway, a good general view is at once obtained. There is a modern rood screen, a spacious and lofty central lantern, and a reredos with a carved spandrel. The Lady Chapel has lancet windows, foliated ornaments and a groined roof. The tomb of Charles Booth, bishop and builder of the porch, is in the sixth bay of the nave on the north side, guarded by the only ancient ironwork left in the cathedral. On the south side of the nave is the Norman font, a circular bowl large enough to allow of the immersion of children.

==Great transept and choir==

The north transept, rebuilt by Aquablanca in the Decorated period, and restored by Scott, is notable for the diapering of the triforium arcade, and for the form of the pointed arches and windows, which have so slight a curvature as to resemble two straight lines meeting at an angle. The north window is filled with stained glass by Hardman as a memorial of Archdeacon Lane-Freer, who died in 1863. In this transept is the tomb or substructure of the shrine of Thomas de Cantilupe, early Decorated work which has been restored. Of Purbeck marble, it is built in two stages, of which the lower contains 14 figures of Knights Templars in chainmail armour, occupying cinquefoiled niches; the Bishop was Provincial Grand Master of that Order in England. Between the north choir aisle and the eastern aisle of the transept is the tomb of Peter Aquablanca, the most ancient of the episcopal monuments in the church. The effigy is an example of a bishop in full vestments; the canopy is supported by slender shafts; the carving throughout is delicate. The south transept is thought by some authorities to be the oldest part of the cathedral, and it exhibits some Norman work, notably the eastern wall with its arcades.

Until its removal in the 1960s there was a wrought iron choir-screen, painted and gilt. Designed by Scott, it was executed by Messrs. Skidmore, of Coventry, from whose works also came the earlier metal screen at Lichfield. After being kept in storage for many years, the screen was completely restored in the late 1990s and re-erected at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

The choir, consisting of three Norman bays of three stages, is full of objects of beauty and interest. The reredos, designed by the younger Cottingham, consists of five canopied compartments, with elaborate sculpture representing our Lord&#x27;s Passion. Behind it is a pier from which spring two pointed arches; the spandrel thus formed is covered with rich modern sculpture, representing Christ in his majesty, with angels and the four Evangelists; below is a figure of King Ethelbert. Against the most easterly point on the south side of the choir is to be seen a small effigy of this king, which was dug up at the entrance to the Lady Chapel about the year 1700. The Bishop&#x27;s throne and the stalls, of 14th-century work and restored, and the modern book desks and figures of angels on the upper stalls, deserve attention. There is also a very curious ancient episcopal chair.

===Misericords===

The choir stalls support forty 14th-century misericords. These misericords show a mixture of mythological beasts, grotesques and everyday events, there appears to be no pattern to the content.

In addition to the misericords in the choir, there are five others contained in a row of &quot;Judges&#x27; Seats&quot;. It is unclear if these were used as misericords, or if they are just ornamentation.

==East transept==
In the north-east transept, of which the vaulting is supported by a central octagonal pier, a large number of monumental fragments are preserved, forming a rich and varied collection. There is also a beautiful altar-tomb of alabaster and polished marbles erected as a public memorial to a former Dean, Richard Dawes, who died in 1867. The effigy, by Mr. Noble, is a good likeness of the Dean, who was an ardent supporter of the education movement about the middle of the 19th century. The south-east transept contains memorials of several Bishops of Hereford. The remains of Gilbert Ironside (died 1701), together with his black marble tombstone, were removed to this place in 1867, when St Mary Somerset in Upper Thames Street, London, was taken down. Here also may be seen a curious effigy of John the Baptist, and a fine marble bust, believed to be the work of Roubiliac. The handsome canopied Perpendicular tomb of Richard Mayew (died 1516), with effigy fully vested, is on the south side of the altar. In the south-east transept, again, is a doorway that opens into the Vicars&#x27; Cloister, an interesting piece of Perpendicular work which leads to the college of the vicars choral.

==Lady Chapel==

Across from the retro-choir or ambulatory is the spacious Early English Lady Chapel, which is built over the crypt and approached by an ascent of five steps. Of the five lancet windows at the east end, each with a quatrefoil opening in the wall above it, Fergusson remarked that &quot;nowhere on the Continent is such a combination to be found&quot;; and he brackets them with the Five Sisters at York Cathedral and the east end of Ely Cathedral. They are filled with glass by Cottingham as a memorial of Dean Merewether, who is buried in the crypt below, and is further commemorated here by a black marble slab with a brass by Hardman, recording his unwearied interest in the restoration of the cathedral.

In the Lady Chapel are church monuments of Joanna de Kilpec and Humphrey de Bohun. Joanna was a 14th-century benefactress of the cathedral who gave to the Dean and Chapter an acre (4,000 m2) of land in Lugwardine, and the advowson of the church, with several chapels pertaining to it. On the south side of the Lady Chapel, separated from it by a screen of curious design, is the chantry erected at the end of the 15th century by Edmund Audley, who, being translated to Salisbury, built another there, where he is buried. His chantry here, pentagonal in shape, is in two storeys, with two windows in the lower and five in the higher.

==Crypt and library==

Though the crypt is small, it is of special interest, as it is Gothic rather than Norman. Its use as a charnel house resulted in the name Golgotha.

Hereford Cathedral Library is a Chained library which contains mainly ancient manuscripts chained to their shelves, some of them fine specimens of ancient handwriting, and containing beautiful illustrations in gold and colour. Two of the most valuable are a unique copy of the ancient Hereford antiphonary of the 13th century, in good preservation, and the Hereford Gospels, a copy of the Gospels at least a thousand years old, in Anglo-Saxon characters. Another treasure is an ancient reliquary of oak, bequeathed to the cathedral by Canon Russell, who is said to have obtained it from a Roman Catholic family in whose possession it had long been. It is covered with copper plates overlaid with Limoges enamel representing the murder and entombment of St Thomas of Canterbury.

===Mappa Mundi===

One of the cathedral&#x27;s treasures is the Hereford Mappa Mundi, dating from the later years of the 13th century. It is the work of an ecclesiastic who is supposed to be represented in the right-hand corner on horseback, attended by his page and greyhounds. He has commemorated himself under the name of Richard de Haldingham and Lafford in Lincolnshire, but his real name was Richard de la Battayle or de Bello. He held a prebendal stall in Lincoln Cathedral, and was promoted to a stall in Hereford in 1305. During the troubled times of Cromwell the map was laid beneath the floor of Edmund Audley&#x27;s Chantry, beside the Lady Chapel, where it remained secreted for some time.

In 1855 it was cleaned and repaired at the British Museum. It is one of the most remarkable monuments of its kind in existence, being the largest surviving of all the old maps drawn on a single sheet of vellum. The world is represented as round, surround by the ocean. At the top of the map (the east) is represented Paradise, with its river and tree; also the eating of the forbidden fruit and the expulsion of Adam and Eve. Above is a remarkable representation of the Day of Judgment, with the Virgin Mary interceding for the faithful, who are seen rising from their graves and being led within the walls of heaven. There are numerous figures of towns, animals, birds, and fish, with grotesque creatures; the four great cities, Jerusalem, Babylon, Rome, and Troy, are made very prominent. In Britain most of the cathedrals are mentioned.

In the 1980s, a financial crisis in the diocese caused the Dean and Chapter to consider selling the Mappa Mundi. After much controversy, large donations from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, Paul Getty and members of the public, kept the map in Hereford and allowed the construction of a new library to house the map and the chained libraries from the Cathedral and All Saints&#x27; Church. The centre was opened on 3 May 1996.

===Magna Carta===
Hereford is fortunate to possess one of only four 1217 Magna Carta to survive, which in turn is one of the finest of the eight oldest that survive. It is sometimes put on display alongside the Hereford Mappa Mundi in the cathedral&#x27;s chained library.

==Organ==
On the south side of the choir is the organ built in 1892 by &quot;Father&quot; Henry Willis, generally considered to be one of the finest examples of his work in the country. The case was designed by Scott.

===Organists===

William Wood is recorded as organist at Hereford Cathedral in 1515. Notable organists include the 16th-century composers John Bull and John Farrant, the conductor and advocate of British composers Meredith Davies, the friend of Edward Elgar George Robertson Sinclair, and the editor of Allegri&#x27;s Miserere, Ivor Atkins. The current organist is Geraint Bowen.

==Bells==
Hereford Cathedral houses 10 bells high in the tower. The tenor bell weighs 34 cwt (1.7 tonnes). The oldest bell in the cathedral is the sixth, which dates back to the 13th century. The bells are sometimes known as the &quot;Grand Old Lady&quot; as they are a unique ring of bells. The cathedral is the main tower of the Hereford Diocesan Guild.

==Other buildings==
Between the cloisters, the Bishop&#x27;s and Vicars&#x27;, both on the south side of the cathedral, are the remains of the Chapter House. In the troubles of 1645 the lead was stripped from its roof, and Bishop Bisse most inexcusably completed its ruin. The Bishop&#x27;s Palace, the Deanery, residences for the canons, and cathedral school are in close proximity to each other. The college, the residence of the vicars choral, forms a picturesque quadrangle.

<text>David Solway (born 8 December 1941) is a Canadian poet, essayist, educational theorist, travel writer and literary critic.

==Biography==
Solway received a BA in English and Philosophy from McGill University in 1962, and a QMA in Philosophy in 1966. He has later received a MA in creative writing/English from Concordia University in 1988, a MA in education from Université de Sherbrooke in 1996, and a Ph.D &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from Lajos Kossuth University in 1998. He was formerly a teacher at Dawson College and John Abbott College in Montreal, and at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, and has been a guest lecturer at several international universities. He has &quot;won numerous awards and prizes for his work in both poetry and non-fiction,&quot; including QSPELL Awards, Grand Prix du Livre de Montréal and A. M. Klein Prize for Poetry.

Solway is known for his work both as a poet, essayist and as a teacher, as well as for his polemical outspokenness, especially in opposition to Islam and in defense of Zionism. He has contributed political commentary to the conservative websites &quot;WorldNetDaily&quot; and &quot;PJ Media&quot;, and has been described as a part of the counter-jihad movement.

For inspiration, he invented a Greek poet named Andreas Karavis as a heteronym, whose work he published in apparent translation.

<text>Daimon Hellstrom, also known as the Son of Satan and Hellstorm, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Daimon made his live action debut in the television series &quot;Helstrom&quot;, portrayed by Tom Austen.

==Publication history==

Encouraged by the success of the titles &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; (vol. 2) and &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot;, both of which starred occult characters, Stan Lee proposed a series starring Satan, to be titled &quot;The Mark of Satan&quot;. Editor Roy Thomas had reservations about this idea and suggested a series focusing on the son of Satan instead (due to an oversight, &quot;The Mark of Satan&quot; is mentioned in a blurb in &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; (vol. 2) #1). According to Thomas, Lee approved of the idea, and Gary Friedrich and Herb Trimpe were assigned the task of designing the character. However, Trimpe denies this, claiming Friedrich alone designed Daimon Hellstrom and only brought him in as artist after the character was fully realized. Thomas has said he later realized that a 1960s fanzine character created by his friend Biljo White had looked very similar. Thomas recalled in 2001:

The character Daimon Hellstrom first appeared in &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; (vol. 2) #1–2 (Sept. 1973 – Oct. 1973), then was spun off into a feature, &quot;The Son of Satan&quot;, in &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; #12–24 (Oct. 1973 – Oct. 1975). During the &quot;Son of Satan&quot; run, &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot; was a controversial series, with numerous readers writing to object to the depictions of Satanism and Wicca as being either inaccurate or furthering the cause of evil. Nonetheless, sales were strong, prompting Marvel to launch the character into his own series, &quot;The Son of Satan&quot;, written by John Warner. The character&#x27;s success faded soon after the series launch, and &quot;The Son of Satan&quot; was cancelled with issue #7, though an unused fill-in was published as &quot;The Son of Satan&quot; #8 (Feb. 1977).

Hellstrom then became a recurring character in &quot;The Defenders&quot;, Steve Gerber having added the character to the team during the time he was writing the &quot;Son of Satan&quot; feature in &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot;, and Hellstrom continued to appear in &quot;Defenders&quot; following the cancellation of &quot;Marvel Spotlight&quot;. One of the later writers on &quot;Defenders&quot;, J. M. DeMatteis, featured a number of subplots focused on Daimon Hellstrom, commenting that he &quot;was absolutely my favorite character. Characters like Son of Satan are a wonderful metaphor for what we all contain, good and evil, high and low aspirations. He&#x27;s literally the son of the Devil, trying not to be what his father is. For a writer like me, how can you not feast on that?&quot; Hellstrom&#x27;s story reaches a resolution of sorts in &quot;The Defenders&quot; #120–121 (June–July 1983), as Hellstrom is freed from his Satanic heritage and marries his teammate the Hellcat.

In 1993, he received his own series once more with &quot;Hellstorm: Prince of Lies&quot;. As suggested by the title, his surname was spelled &quot;Hellstorm&quot; during this series, the character explicitly choosing to change it from &quot;Hellstrom&quot; in issues #1 and 2. Rafael Nieves wrote the first four issues, Len Kaminski took over as scripter until issue #11, and Warren Ellis then took over as writer until the series&#x27; cancellation with issue #21. In 2019, the character joined a team consisting of Blade the Vampire Slayer, Angela, the Winter Soldier, Spider-Woman, Wiccan and Monica Rambeau in &quot;Strikeforce&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
Daimon Hellstrom was born in the fictional town of Greentown, Massachusetts. He is the son of Satan and a mortal woman named Victoria Wingate (his father was later retconned into a demon named Marduk Kurios). Daimon and his younger sister, Satana, were trained by their father in the art of magic, tapping into the power granted them by their dark heritage. However, while Satana embraced her heritage, Daimon clung to his humanity. When their mother discovered who her husband really was, she was driven insane. Daimon and Satana were separated and put in different homes after their mother was institutionalized and their father banished back to Hell. Daimon grew up in a Jesuit-run orphanage, never hearing a word from his father or sister. He became a professor of anthropology at St. Louis University. He then set himself up as an occult investigator and defender of humanity, battling dark arcane forces — primarily those of his father — under the name of the &quot;Son of Satan&quot;, as a demonologist and exorcist.

In his first appearance, Daimon battled Satan and the Witch-Woman alongside the Ghost Rider. Soon after that, he began a long association with the Defenders by helping them battle Asmodeus (the leader of the Sons of Satannish) and Satannish himself. He also helped the Defenders battle the third incarnation of the Sons of the Serpent. Later, alongside the Human Torch, he battled Dryminextes. He then encountered Satana for the first time as an adult. Alongside the Thing, he battled Kthara. Alongside the Ghost Rider again, he battled the Challenger. Hellstrom next battled the Possessor.

After Steve Gerber ceased writing the book, Hellstrom began working at the University of the District of Columbia Parapsychology Department, where he had a friendship with Seripha Thames, a female professor who was a Wiccan. Following these events, he was rarely seen for a while. One of his few recorded adventures during this time was again with the Defenders, battling the Hulk. He returned to a more active role when he became involved with the Defenders yet again, this time becoming an active member of the group. He worked with the team to battle the Six-Fingered Hand, and was taken to Hell by Satan. He was subsequently expelled from Hell by Satan and rejoined the Defenders. Alongside Luke Cage, he battled the Sons of Satannish again. Hellstrom then battled an unnamed demon who had taken his place as &quot;Daimon Hellstrom&quot;. Alongside the Defenders, he battled the Miracle Man, who stole Daimon&#x27;s &quot;Darksoul&quot;, the essence of his evil heritage. Alongside the Defenders again, Hellstrom battled Mad Dog and the Mutant Force. He then married his teammate Patsy Walker, alias the Hellcat. Alongside the Defenders, Cutlass, Typhoon, and Hannibal King, Hellstrom then battled Minerva Bannister.

Alongside the Hellcat and the West Coast Avengers, he later battled Master Pandemonium, Allatou, and the Cat People. He later exorcised Lincoln Slade&#x27;s spirit from Hamilton Slade&#x27;s body. Alongside the West Coast Avengers again, he battled Seth&#x27;s forces. Daimon and Patsy retired from adventuring and Daimon went on a personal quest for meaning. He traveled to a monastery where the Miracle Man had taken refuge. When the Miracle Man stole Daimon&#x27;s &quot;Darksoul&quot;, Daimon discovered that he was human, but he was also dying. Patsy eventually used a dark magic book in Daimon&#x27;s possession titled the &quot;Grimorum Verum&quot; to summon &quot;Satan&quot; and pleaded for him to save Daimon&#x27;s life. However, to do this, Daimon had to regain his Darksoul and once again become the &quot;Son of Satan&quot;. Daimon was re-imbued with his essence, but upon witnessing Daimon&#x27;s &quot;true face&quot; of evil, Patsy went insane. Daimon kept her away from prying eyes in his estate at Fire Lake, where she spent most days either asleep or babbling seemingly randomly. She would remain there until one day she regained enough sanity to weep for having brought back such evil into the world, and committed suicide with the aid of a being known as Deathurge. Now calling himself &quot;Hellstorm&quot;, Daimon ultimately discovered a way to finally defeat his father. Daimon discovered his father&#x27;s secret true name – Marduk Kurios – and used the power of this knowledge to finally kill him. Daimon then became the new &quot;Satan&quot;, ruling over his father&#x27;s realm of Hell. He later used this power to allow Hawkeye and the Thunderbolts to resurrect Patsy from the dead. Daimon battled the Black School.

In the three-issue miniseries &quot;Hellcat&quot;, Daimon told his wife that he was never truly the son of Marduk Kurios; his true father was Satannish, who was himself the son of the Dread Dormammu. Daimon claimed he had been fathered as part of a plot to take control of the various &quot;Hell&quot; dimensions. These claims, however, heavily contradicted Hellstorm&#x27;s established history. It has since been revealed that Hellstorm was deliberately lying to Patsy when he made these claims; his love for Patsy led him to push her away in the hopes that she would be happier without him. Hellstorm used this claim to assume control over Satannish&#x27;s realm and inherit Dormammu&#x27;s right to rule as designated by the powerful &quot;Flames of Faltine&quot;. However, without either Satannish or Dormammu backing Daimon, Mephisto was able to gain control of the vast majority of &quot;Hell&quot;. Daimon was recruited by Kyle Richmond for the Defenders as part of the Fifty States Initiative. Working outside of the Initiative, this team was later forcibly disbanded by H.A.M.M.E.R. Daimon was then brought to A.R.M.O.R. to join the Midnight Sons in facing an interdimensional zombie threat. The Midnight Sons headed to Taino to contain the zombie virus, but ended up in a battle with the Hood&#x27;s forces. During the course of the outbreak on the island, Dormammu possessed fellow member Jennifer Kale, though Daimon exorcised him from her. The mission ended up a success, though the zombie Deadpool&#x27;s head escaped. He was sought out by Doctor Strange as a potential claimant of the title of Sorcerer Supreme; however, he was attacked by the Hood first, who was attacking potential magic users who could also claim the title and, helped by him and Brother Voodoo (now going by Doctor Voodoo as the new Sorcerer Supreme), they managed to banish Dormammu, leaving the Hood powerless for a while. Sometime around the Dark Reign, Hellstrom, after being informed by a Satanist priest of the existence of the Antichrist, vowed to slay the boy and, joining once more with his former girlfriend Jaine Cutter, rescued the Ghost Rider from the renegade angel Zadkiel&#x27;s forces, and eventually the united Ghost Riders from all of history were able to reclaim Heaven, overthrow Zadkiel, and triumph over the forces Satan had unleashed against them.

During the &quot;Chaos War&quot; story line, Hellstrom rose from the pits of Hell itself to inform the newly assembled &quot;God Squad&quot; that his father&#x27;s fiery realm had fallen to the hordes of the Chaos King and that all the dead souls of the Underworld were now under his thrall. Hellstrom joined forces with the God Squad and pitted his demonic powers against those of the enslaved Zeus, Hera and Ares, to little avail, and later journeyed with them in a last desperate attempt to seal Mikaboshi in Yomi.

In the pages of &quot;Avengers Undercover&quot;, Daimon Hellstrom appeared as a member of the Shadow Council&#x27;s ninth incarnation of the Masters of Evil. He is seen in the inner circle of Baron Helmut Zemo (who became the leader of this version of the Masters of Evil following the death of Max Fury). Cullen Bloodstone told the teenage heroes that followed him that Daimon Hellstrom had been helping him to control his Glaratrox form. Daimon Hellstrom was with Baron Zemo, Madame Masque, and the Constrictor when they watched the teenage heroes confront Arcade at Massacrer Casino. When the teenage heroes were apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. and placed in a S.H.I.E.L.D. detention center, Daimon Hellstrom teleported the entire building back to Bagalia, where Baron Zemo offered the group a chance to join the Masters of Evil. Daimon Hellstrom is shown to live in Hellstrom Manor in Hell Town, Bagalia.

Hellstrom then returned in the pages of Jason Aaron&#x27;s &quot;Avengers&quot; (vol. 8), where he helped the team by exorcising the Ghost Rider&#x27;s (Robbie Reyes) Dodge Charger.

Hellstrom later appeared as a teacher of Strange Academy where he teaches Inferno alongside Magik.

==Powers and abilities==

As a ruler of a realm of Hell, Hellstorm commands virtually unlimited power in his own dimension. Potentially, he can perform virtually any magical feat. As Hellstorm, thanks to his demonic heritage, Daimon Hellstrom could sense the presence of the supernatural and could cast spells to transport himself and others into mystical dimensions and back to Earth. Other powers he exhibited at this time may not have stemmed from himself (as he had lost his &quot;Darksoul&quot;, see below) but from his magical trident. Hellstorm could project mystic energy in the form of &quot;soulfire&quot; (also called &quot;hellfire&quot;) from his trident, causing excruciating pain within living beings through direct contact of a person&#x27;s life force. The soulfire did not physically burn in the sense that true fire does, and Hellstrom could project soulfire as a concussive blast of force. He could use soulfire for various other effects, including flight and physical transformations.

As the Son of Satan, Hellstrom possessed supernatural powers derived from his &quot;Darksoul&quot;, a demonic counterpart to his human soul, which physically manifested itself in the pentagram-shaped birthmark on his chest. The Darksoul granted him superhuman strength, and the ability to project soulfire. He was able to magically change into his demonic costume at will by extending the middle three fingers of each hand in the shape of a trident, concentrating, and letting his soulfire engulf his body. Once, Hellstrom used his powers to travel through time to ancient Atlantis. As the Son of Satan and Hellstorm, Hellstrom wielded a trident made of netharanium, a &quot;psychosensitive&quot; metal found only in &quot;Satan&#x27;s&quot; extradimensional realm. The trident was a medium through which magical energies, such as Hellstrom&#x27;s soulfire, could be amplified and projected. By projecting the soulfire through the trident, Hellstrom could gain enough thrust to levitate and to fly for short periods of time. He also used a fiery chariot drawn by three bat-winged demonic horses named Amon, Hecate and Set. Hellstrom is an expert in demonology, and a highly experienced exorcist with some knowledge of mystic rites. He has an advanced degree in theology, and is self-taught in demonology.

In this reality, the bargain would not be interrupted by Crash&#x27;s daughter Roxanne Simpson allowing Satan to fully take control of Johnny. Johnny would then go on a murder spree across America, killing criminals as well as both Crash and Roxanne. Ultimately, Johnny was confronted by Hellstrom, who would try to convince him to repent of his evil ways. Refusing to do so, the Ghost Rider attacked Hellstrom, forcing him to use his trident to absorb the Ghost Rider&#x27;s hellfire, killing him instantly.

<doc id="747395" wikidata="Q783761" url="?curid=747395" title="Russkaya Pravda">
<text>The Russkaya Pravda (sometimes translated as &quot;Rus&#x27; Justice&quot;, &quot;Rus&#x27; Truth&quot;, or &quot;Russian Justice&quot;) was the legal code of Kievan Rus&#x27; and its principalities during the period of feudal fragmentation. It was written at the beginning of the 12th century and remade during many centuries. The basis of the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot;, the &quot;Pravda&quot; of Yaroslav, was written at the beginning of the 11th century. The &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; was a main source of the law of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

In spite of great influence of Byzantine legislation on the contemporary world, and in spite of great cultural and commercial ties between Byzantium and Kievan Rus&#x27;, the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; bore no similarity whatsoever to the law of the Byzantine Empire. The absence of capital and corporal punishment rather reflects Norse jurisprudence.

==Editions==

Three recensions of the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; are known: the Short Edition (&quot;Kratkaya Pravda&quot;), the Extensive Edition (&quot;Prostrannaya Pravda&quot;), and the Abridged Edition (&quot;Sokrashchyonnaya Pravda&quot;). The shortest version numbers around 850 words, while the longest version is around four times as long. The abridged version is known from two 17th-century copies. 13 copies of the &quot;Kratkaya Pravda&quot; are extant, while an additional four are known to have existed but are now lost. 11 of the extant copies were made in the 18th and 19th century, while the other two are dated to the mid-15th century. Around 100 copies of the &quot;Prostrannaya Pravda&quot; are extant. Around three-quarters are found in &quot;kormchie&quot; books, while the remainder were found in various other collections that were also monastic in origin. These include for example the &quot;Merilo Pravednoye&quot;.

Modern scholarship of the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; began in 1738 when the historian Vasily Tatischev rediscovered the code in the text of one of the manuscripts of the Novgorod chronicles, where it was included under the year 1016. He offered his annotated text and brought it to the attention of the Russian Academy of Sciences, but it was not published until 1786. Around the same time, August Ludwig von Schlözer published the text of the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; using a different manuscript. Both works were concerned with the &quot;Kratkaya Pravda&quot;. The text of the &quot;Prostrannaya Pravda&quot; was published by V. Krestinin in 1788. The first study on the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot;, aside from Tatischev&#x27;s comments, was an academic address called &quot;Discours sur l’origine et les changements des loix russiennes&quot; delivered by F. Strube de Piermont in 1756. The results of two centuries of scholarship were collected in a three-volume edition published by the Soviet Academy of Sciences under the editorship of Boris Grekov.

== Genesis and evolution ==
The legal regulations of the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; reflected the evolution of the social relations in Kievan Rus&#x27; during the 11th–13th centuries. Common law, &quot;knyaz&quot; legislation, and legal proceedings represented the basis of the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot;. The presumable similarity with Scandinavian law raises questions, as the earliest written law books appeared after the Christianization of Scandinavia. Several studies on the connections with Germanic law have also been conducted, but attention has mostly been focused on the earliest law, the &quot;Leges Barbarorum&quot;. The similarities are not very specific, and there is a gap of about five centuries. The 9th-century &quot;Lex Saxonum&quot; has also been compared, in which the first dozen or so articles are close to the first ten articles of the &quot;Kratkaya Pravda&quot;.

The Short Edition of the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; contains two chronological components, called by researchers the &quot;Pravda Yaroslava&quot; (&quot;The &quot;Pravda&quot; of Yaroslav&quot;), otherwise known as the &quot;Drevneyshaya Pravda&quot; (&quot;Oldest Justice&quot;) of Yaroslav the Wise, and the &quot;Pravda Yaroslavichey&quot; (&quot;The &quot;Pravda&quot; of Yaroslav″s Sons&quot;). Due to the Short Edition not being a homogenous legal document, this has given rise to a theory that it is the amalgamation of two independent versions of the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot;. However, the &quot;Pravda Yaroslavichey&quot; appears to be an addition to the &quot;Pravda&quot; of Yaroslav, as it regulates questions not covered by the latter, and so modern scholars tend to accept the refutation of this theory. In regards to prior legislation, scholars often draw attention to treaties with the Byzantine Empire in 911 and 941, both of which mention the &quot;zakon russkii&quot;. As a result, the most probable source for the &quot;Pravda&quot; of Yaroslav would be customary law.

The two basic copies of the Short Edition have come from the text of the Novgorod chronicle. The chronicle says that Yaroslav, in accordance with the prevailing practice among the Rurikids, was appointed as the prince of Novgorod by his father Vladimir. One of his duties was the yearly tribute to Kiev, but in 1013 or 1014, Yaroslav, with the support of Novgorod, ceased this payment. His father began to gather an army as a result to enforce his claim, while Yaroslav brought in Varangians to strengthen his own army. These Varangians caused unrest in Novgorod, leading to many of them being killed during an uprising. Yaroslav had some of the prominent Novgorodians killed as a result, but when he heard of the news of his father&#x27;s death, he made peace with Novgorod. He then marched against his half-brother Sviatopolk, and after emerging victorious, he dismissed the Novgorodian troops and gave them a law code (&quot;pravda&quot;). Yaroslav wrote a statute (&quot;ustav&quot;), saying: &quot;Live according to this charter (&quot;gramota&quot;), as I have written it for you, and observe it&quot;. Although many scholars have given their opinion regarding the origins of the Short Edition, the majority opinion is to give credence to the general narrative given in the chronicle, in that Yaroslav did write a law that was connected to Novgorod&#x27;s support in his war against his half-brother. It is generally agreed that the second part, the &quot;Pravda Yaroslavichey&quot;, was not included in this law.

Subsequent development and improvement of the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; took place in times of Yaroslav&#x27;s sons and his grandson Vladimir Monomakh. The &quot;Pravda Yaroslavichey&quot; is known as such because it starts with the following: &quot;The law established for the Russian land, when Iziaslav, Vsevolod, Sviatoslav, Kosniachko Pereneg, Mikyfor the Kievan, and Chudin Mikula met together&quot;. There remains uncertainty about the precise date of the &quot;Pravda Yaroslavichey&quot;, with 1072 being given as the mostly likely date. New provisions are believed to have been added to the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; after the revolts in Kiev, Novgorod, and Rostov-Suzdal province in 1068–1071. The first part of the Expanded Edition, the &quot;Pravda&quot; of Yaroslav, was likely a heavily amended version of the Short Edition enacted sometime in the late 11th or early 12th century. The second part, which represented the law code created by Vladimir Monomakh, was enacted shortly after the uprising of 1113.

In the arising Russian state centered on Moscow, the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; was replaced by the &quot;Sudebnik&quot; of 1497 under Ivan III, which in turned was succeeded by the &quot;Sudebnik&quot; of 1550 under his grandson Ivan IV. The &quot;Sudebnik&quot; put an end to the legal fragmentation of Russia. It replaced other law codes in certain regions, including the Pskov Judicial Charter and Novgorod Judicial Charter. The Pskov Judicial Charter in particular was the most significant piece of legislation between the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot; and the &quot;Sudebnik&quot; of 1497, which was the first milestone of a newly unified Russian state.

== Institutions ==
The &quot;Pravda Yaroslavichey&quot; increased responsibility of a given community for killing soldiers of a &quot;knyaz&quot;, (&quot;&quot;, a privileged servant of knyazs or boyars), starostas (&quot;starosta&quot;, a representative from the low-ranking administration of a &quot;knyaz&quot;), (&quot;&quot;, a low-ranking soldier in the army of a &quot;knyaz&quot;) and other servants on their own territory. The &quot;Pravda Yaroslavichey&quot; provided severe punishment for arson, deliberate cattle mutilation, and collective encroachment on rich people&#x27;s property. After the 1113 Riot in Kiev, an exorbitant interest law was introduced that limited financial operations of moneylenders.
The &quot;Pravda&quot; stabilized the system of feudal relations and social inequality. During the 11th–13th centuries, it made new laws for the smerds (&quot;smerd&quot; – a feudal-dependent peasant), (&quot; - a feudal-dependent peasant, who could become free after paying off his &quot;, a feudal loan), (&quot;&quot; – a feudal-dependent peasant, who could be killed or sold like a slave) etc. The Vast Edition of Pravda contains special regulations regarding the status of and . It also reflects the role of the court of a &quot;knyaz&quot;, by increasing and giving various forms of punishment and penalties. It instituted fines that benefited the &quot;knyaz&quot; or his administration with diminished compensation to the victims.

In an attempt to abolish the blood feud (that was quite common at that time), the &quot;Pravda&quot; narrowed its &quot;usage&quot; and limited the number of avengers to the closest relatives of the dead. If there were no avengers on the victim&#x27;s side, the killer had to pay a fine (called &quot;vyra&quot;) in favour of the &quot;knyaz&quot; and partial compensation to the relatives of the victim (the killer&#x27;s community had to help him pay his fine). If a woman was killed, one would have to pay half of the regular fine (called &quot;poluvir&#x27;ye&quot;, half of &quot;vyra&quot;). The &quot;Pravda&quot; also protected the health and honor of the free members of the feudal society and provided financial compensation for mutilation or insult by word or deed. The &quot;Pravda&quot; had a comprehensive system of punishments and penalties for larceny in a city or countryside, deliberate damage to forests, hunting grounds or lands, trespassing etc. It also regulated debt between individuals and contained articles of liability and hereditary law. The &quot;Pravda&quot; made use of witnesses, oaths and of the trial by water or iron, a kind of a last-resort test used to prove defendant&#x27;s innocence or guilt in legal proceedings. The legal process also included testimony witnesses, evidence, collecting or hot pursuit. Investigators had to check for false accusations, as well.

<doc id="747397" wikidata="Q7729116" url="?curid=747397" title="The David Letterman Show">
<text>The David Letterman Show is an American morning talk show that was hosted by David Letterman on NBC. It originally aired from June 23 to October 24, 1980. Originally, the series lasted 90 minutes, then 60 minutes from August 4 onward.

==Background==
David Letterman&#x27;s relationship with NBC began in 1978, when he made his first appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Over the next two years Letterman returned to the show several times, and occasionally served as guest host in Carson&#x27;s absence. NBC&#x27;s president Fred Silverman was so impressed by Letterman&#x27;s performance that he decided to offer him a morning talk show.

In early 1980, NBC&#x27;s daytime morning lineup consisted of six game shows. &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; was made possible by the cancellation of three of them: &quot;High Rollers&quot;, &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, and the long-running daytime version of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;.

The series was a critical success (and won several Daytime Emmys including the 1981 
Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Class Writing) but the edgy comedy did not go over well with morning television watchers, who were more accustomed at the time to talk shows, soap operas, game shows, and prime time reruns.

==Production==
The original producer was Bob Stewart, a veteran quiz-show creator who had enlisted Letterman as a panelist on &quot;Pyramid&quot; from 1978 onward. However, due to creative differences, Stewart left the show four days before its premiere, and production of the first several shows fell to head writer Merrill Markoe, who acted as the show&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; producer despite having absolutely no prior experience in the role. Much more comfortable as a writer than as producer, Markoe stayed aboard as the show&#x27;s head writer for the entire run of the series, but was succeeded as producer by Barry Sand. Sand joined the show as of the July 15th episode, and remained at the helm for the rest of its run. (Sand later returned to &quot;Letterman&quot; as producer for the first five years of &quot;Late Night&quot;.) Michael McDonald of the Doobie Brothers wrote the opening theme of the show.

Behind the scenes were (after the first few weeks) Hal Gurnee directing, with Biff Henderson serving as stage manager, a role he served for the next 35 years of Letterman&#x27;s career. The writing staff initially consisted of Merrill Markoe (head writer), Valri Bromfield, Rich Hall, Harold Kimmel, Edie McClurg, Gerard Mulligan, Paul Raley, Will Shriner, Bob Sarlatte and Ed Subitsky. (Bromfield, McClurg, Kimmel, and Sarlatte left before the show&#x27;s end; added to the staff through the run were Ron Richards, Gary Jacobs and Letterman himself, not credited as a writer on early episodes.)

All the writers appeared on camera, some fairly frequently. Seen most often, usually in character being interviewed by Dave, were:

*Edie McClurg as regular correspondent Mrs. Marv Mendenhall, a housewife who shared various tips, advice and opinions with Dave and the audience. McClurg was also seen in the recurring roles of Dot; one of the Timkie sisters; and a 105-year-old version of herself. 
*Valri Bromfield as confused teen Debbie Smith; intense, no-nonsense Mrs. Bjorkman; one of The Timkie Sisters; and various other characters.
*Paul Raley as performer &quot;The Incredible Al&quot;, and as paranoid ex-FBI agent P.J. Rails.
*Rich Hall, usually as himself, giving odd theatre and film reviews, or using plastic toys to present recreations of news events in the (fictional) town of Pitkinville, Montana. 
*Will Shriner, also as himself, usually presenting a short film.
*Ed Subitzky as an unnamed character who would be announced as a well-known celebrity (e.g., Gary Coleman, Suzanne Somers, Donna Summer), but—after appearing on stage—would then almost immediately embarrassedly confess to NOT being that celebrity, but just a guy who wanted to get on TV. (this bit was reprised on early episodes of &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;.)
*Bob Sarlette was the announcer for the first six weeks, and also occasionally interacted with Dave in conversations and desk bits.

Early publicity photos for the show (issued prior to the first broadcast) showed the cast as a quartet of Letterman, Bromfield, McClurg and Sarlette, and in early episodes, only Bromfield, McClurg and Sarlette were identified as cast members. Ironically, Bromfield, McClurg and Sarlette all left the show between six weeks and three months of its debut, while the other (initially uncredited) regulars stuck through to the end.

Familiar bits that became staples of Letterman&#x27;s comedy on his later shows were originally introduced on this show. They include: &quot;Small Town News&quot;, &quot;Stupid Pet Tricks&quot;, and an ever-changing non-sequitur opening introduction immediately before Letterman is seen on camera. (e.g., &quot;And now, a man whose recipe for triple fudge brownies includes two quarts of vodka, sauerkraut, and a heaping tablespoon of love...David Letterman!&quot;) Because Letterman owned the rights to &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot;, he was able to claim ownership of all the sketches that originally aired on it; this would prove valuable in 1993, when Letterman left NBC to launch &quot;The Late Show&quot; on CBS. NBC wanted to claim that much of the work he did on &quot;Late Night&quot; was the property of NBC, but because those sketches were carryovers from &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot;, he was allowed to take them to CBS.

The production staff consisted of George Callahan, Kim Carney, Lee B. Chernick, Barbara Gaines, Edd Hall, Tim Holton, Brian J. McAloon, Meg Mortimer, Dency Nelson, and David Reale.

The news producer was Alan Mohan, and the news writer was Nick Allen. Bill Kelley was the technical director. The musical director was Frank Owens who led the &quot;David Letterman Symphony Orchestra&quot; (actually a four-person combo) and traded jokes with Letterman. Longtime NBC newsman Edwin Newman provided live news updates in the studio during each broadcast; studio audience members often interrupted his reporting with laughter or groans, as if Newman were an anchor on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Update&quot;.

The program was produced by Space Age Meats, a precursor to Letterman&#x27;s later production company, Worldwide Pants Incorporated.

==Guests==
Valri Bromfield, Edie McClurg, Rich Hall, Gerard Mulligan, Ed Subitzky, Merrill Markoe and Paul Raley all appeared on the show and served as writers. Edd Hall (later the announcer on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;) and &quot;Late Show&quot; producer Barbara Gaines were both production assistants, while stage manager Biff Henderson and director Hal Gurnee followed Dave to his next two shows. Announcer/comedian Bob Sarlatte was replaced partway through the run by Bill Wendell, who also announced on Dave&#x27;s next two shows until his retirement in 1995.

Among guests who appeared were Steve Allen, Andy Kaufman, Wil Shriner, Dinah Shore, Tom Snyder, photojournalists Jon &amp; Keiko Alpert, keyboardist Suzanne Ciani, Dr. Isaac Asimov and Jeff Greenfield, who reviewed the first show while it was on the air.

The show&#x27;s musical guests included Loudon Wainwright III, The Drifters, Janis Ian, Irene Cara, Maria Muldaur, Nell Carter, Judy Collins, John Sebastian, Tom Rush, Lionel Hampton, Charles Aznavour, Tracy Nelson, Linda Hopkins, Esther Satterfield, Lacy J. Dalton, Michael Franks, Gerard Kenny, John Hartford, and Harve Mann.

In one of his earliest television appearances, a young Bill Maher was an audience member on the show&#x27;s first episode, and Conan O&#x27;Brien claims he hitchhiked to New York just to see a broadcast in Studio 6A (which has also been home to some of Jack Paar&#x27;s NBC programs, and then eventually Letterman and O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s versions of the network&#x27;s &quot;Late Night&quot; franchise).

==Show timeline==
*June 23: First show. In addition to host Letterman, regulars introduced on the show include announcer Bob Sarlette, writer/performers Edie McClurg and Valri Bromfield, newsreader Edwin Newman, and bandleader Frank Owens. (Writer/performers Rich Hall, Paul Raley, Will Shriner and Gerard Mulligan will debut later in the week.) Head writer Merrill Markoe produces the show, without credit—the show has no official producer. Bruce Burmester directs.
*June 27: On the fourth show, the very first edition of Stupid Pet Tricks is presented. This is a segment that Letterman continued for the next 35 years.
*July 10: This episode marked the debut of &quot;Small Town News&quot;, which became another recurring segment on Letterman&#x27;s shows throughout his TV career.
*July 11: The first &quot;Viewer Mail&quot; segment is performed. This developed into another long-running Letterman bit.
*July 15: Barry Sand succeeds Markoe as producer. Markoe remains head writer.
*July 28: Hal Gurnee succeeds Burmester as director.
*August 4: The show is reduced from 90 minutes to 60 minutes as of this episode. Sarlette is no longer with the show as of this episode; Edie McClurg is the announcer for the week of August 4–8. 
*August 11: Bill Wendell succeeds Bob Sarlatte as the show&#x27;s permanent announcer. Wendell remained with Letterman for the next 15 years.
*August 21: Valri Bromfield&#x27;s last on-air appearance on the show. (She is still credited as a writer for the next two weeks.)
*September 10: Initial announcement of the &quot;have &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; in your own home&quot; contest.
*September 19: Edie McClurg&#x27;s last on-air appearance on the show. This is also her last show as a writer.
*September 26: &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; ran for four more weeks after its cancellation was announced. 
*October 10: The entire episode is devoted to a Missouri farmer named Floyd Stiles, who along with his wife, Zola Mae Stiles, is flown in from Collins, Missouri specifically for the show&#x27;s &quot;Floyd Stiles Day&quot; broadcast.
*October 22: Winners of the &quot;have &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; in your own home&quot; contest are featured in a special episode taped in Cresco, Iowa.
*October 24: The final show. Crew members&#x27; resumes are shown as bumpers leading into and out of commercials.

The final weeks of the show received particular acclaim. Esquire noted, &quot;He cut loose with his own jokes until they had a 2:00 a.m. comedy-club edge. He reached for his emergency weapons. Let go, he let go. By the beginning of October, audiences were packing themselves into the studio.&quot; College boys hitched cross-country with petitions to save him. Some Long Island housewives threatened to block Manhattan traffic until the network relented.

For the next year, NBC paid him $1,000,000 ($20,000 a week) to do nothing except not work for someone else without their permission, which included guest-hosting &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on multiple occasions. Letterman&#x27;s next program, &quot;Late Night&quot; premiered on February 1, 1982, replacing Tom Snyder&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow&quot; program.

==Episode status==
Approximately 83 episodes (of the 90 produced) are held in the archives of Letterman&#x27;s production company, Worldwide Pants; a brief clip from the finale was shown on Letterman&#x27;s 15th anniversary show in 1997, and similarly brief clips from several episodes were featured as interstitials on the &quot;Late Show&#x27;s&quot; final episode in 2015. Some episodes are available for on-site viewing at the Paley Center for Media in New York. In 2022, Letterman started releasing interviews from this program (in addition to his later shows) on his official YouTube channel, after longtime Letterman-archivist Don Giller did this on his own fan channel.

<text>John Grigg (4 June 1838 – 20 June 1920) was a New Zealand astronomer.

He was born in London and married Emma Mitchell in 1858. In 1863 they emigrated to New Zealand and settled in Auckland, however Emma died in 1867. Grigg then moved to the town of Thames. During this time he was seller of musical instruments, piano tuner, music teacher, and conductor. 

He married his second wife Sarah Allaway in 1871 but she died in 1874. He later married his third wife, Jane Henderson, in 1887. In all, he had six sons and three daughters by his three wives.

The 1874 transit of Venus awakened his interest in astronomy, which he pursued full-time starting in 1894. He began systematic searches for comets in that year.

He is best known for his co-discovery of the periodic comet 26P/Grigg–Skjellerup in 1902, which was his first discovery of a new comet.

<doc id="747416" wikidata="Q5232979" url="?curid=747416" title="David Dimbleby">
<text>David Dimbleby (born 28 October 1938) is an English journalist and former presenter of current affairs and political programmes, best known for having presented the BBC topical debate programme &quot;Question Time&quot;. He is the son of broadcaster Richard Dimbleby and elder brother of Jonathan Dimbleby, of the Dimbleby family. Long involved in the coverage of national events, Dimbleby hosted the BBC Election Night coverage from 1979 to 2017, as well as United States presidential elections on the BBC until 2016. He has also presented and narrated documentary series on architecture and history.

==Early life and education==
Dimbleby was born in East Sheen, Surrey, the son of the journalist and Second World War war correspondent Richard Dimbleby, by his marriage to Dilys Thomas, from Wales. He had three siblings: two brothers, Jonathan Dimbleby, also a television current affairs presenter, and Nicholas (died 2024), and a sister, Sally. David Dimbleby was educated at two independent schools, the Glengorse School in Battle, East Sussex, and Charterhouse in Godalming, Surrey, where he was a contemporary of the journalist Adam Raphael. The two younger Dimblebys both made their television débuts in the 1950s in the BBC&#x27;s first holiday programme &quot;Passport&quot;, at a time when the whole family would visit resorts in Switzerland or Brittany. A holiday programme for the home counties, called &quot;No Passport&quot;, was also broadcast.

After learning French in Paris and Italian in Perugia, Dimbleby read Philosophy, politics and economics at Christ Church, Oxford and graduated with a third-class degree. While at Oxford he was President of the Christ Church Junior Common Room, a member of the Bullingdon Club – a socially exclusive student dining and drinking society – and also editor of the student magazine &quot;Isis&quot;.

==Career==

===Early career===
Dimbleby joined the BBC as a news reporter in Bristol in the 1960s and has appeared in news programmes since 1962, early on co-presenting the televised version of the school quiz &quot;Top of the Form&quot;, and was a reporter on the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the 1964 general election with his father as linkman. Richard Dimbleby died the following year.

On 24 July 1967, Dimbleby was one of seventy signatories to an advertisement in &quot;The Times&quot; advocating the decriminalisation of cannabis use, which had been written by campaigner Stephen Abrams. An incident in 1969 led to Dimbleby, then freelance, being called in by the BBC&#x27;s Director of Television. During U.S. President Richard Nixon&#x27;s visit to the UK, a reference by Dimbleby to UK and US government heads&#x27; &quot;expensively hired&quot; press secretaries &quot;whose job is to disguise the truth&quot; was given much attention by the British press.

Dimbleby became involved in a number of projects that combined his established role as presenter and interviewer with documentary making. An early example of this was &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Men&quot; (1971), a film which the BBC recognises &quot;ridiculed&quot; the Labour opposition and led to a major conflict between the Corporation and the Labour Party; Dimbleby had his name removed from the credits because of the concessions that were made. In 1974, he became the presenter of &quot;Panorama&quot;, which had been presented by his father.

===Coverage of elections===
Dimbleby anchored the BBC&#x27;s overnight coverage of the 1979 general election, and continued in this role until the 2017 general election, for a total of ten general elections. In addition to election coverage, he also hosted BBC Budget specials, and was a presenter of the BBC early evening weekday current affairs series &quot;Nationwide&quot;. During the same period (beginning in 1979), Dimbleby has also been the anchor for the BBC&#x27;s European Parliament election results programmes and in 2008 and 2012, anchored the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the US election night.

Dimbleby was the main presenter of the BBC&#x27;s political series &quot;This Week Next Week&quot; (1984–88), broadcast on Sunday early afternoons, as a competitor to ITV&#x27;s established &quot;Weekend World&quot; series. As early as 1987, he was a contender for the position of Director-General of the BBC (losing out to Michael Checkland). &quot;This Week Next Week&quot; was replaced in 1988 by the &quot;On the Record&quot;, a political series presented until 1993 by his younger brother, Jonathan Dimbleby. Meanwhile, he continued to work in documentaries, including &quot;The White Tribe of Africa&quot; (1979), an award-winning four-part history of South Africa&#x27;s Afrikaans community and the rise of apartheid, &quot;An Ocean Apart&quot; (1988), an examination of the history of Anglo-American relations, and &quot;Rebellion!&quot; (1999), a history of Britain&#x27;s troubled relations with Zimbabwe.

By this time, Dimbleby was established as the anchor for the BBC&#x27;s coverage of events of national importance, such as the State Opening of Parliament, the Trooping the Colour, and the National Service of Remembrance service at the Cenotaph in Whitehall.

Dimbleby served as chairman of the BBC&#x27;s Thursday evening topical debate programme &quot;Question Time&quot; from 1994 until 2018. One of the most memorable moments from &quot;Question Time&quot; was when Dimbleby accidentally referred to Robin Cook as &quot;Robin Cock&quot;, to which Cook responded by jokingly referring to Dimbleby as &quot;David Bumblebee&quot;.

===2000s===
In 1999, Dimbleby opened &quot;2000 Today&quot;, the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the millennium celebrations, from Greenwich, England. He commentated on the funerals of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in 2002 and former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 2013, as well as the state visit of US President George W. Bush to the UK in 2003. In 2002, Dimbleby hosted the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II coverage. A profile by Ben Summerskill for &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2001 quoted an unnamed former Cabinet Minister who had observed Dimbleby&#x27;s career for many decades: &quot;I suspect he has an almost medieval view, that the Queen governs through Parliament... There are a few quarrels among the subjects – over which he presides very capably – but they have very little to do with what Britain is really about.&quot; Dimbleby, though, has himself criticised what he sees as archaic elements of the State Opening of Parliament.

David Dimbleby was chairman of the Dimbleby Newspaper Group, former publishers of the &quot;Richmond and Twickenham Times&quot;, acquired by the Newsquest Media Group in 2001 for a reported £12,000,000.

There were reports in 2004 that Dimbleby was shortlisted for the chairmanship of the BBC. However, the position was eventually awarded to Michael Grade. Dimbleby was a contender for the chairmanship in the corporation&#x27;s tumultuous period following 2001, which went to Gavyn Davies. He has instead remained, according to Mark Duguid for the BFI&#x27;s screenonline website, best known for his &quot;gravitas, journalistic integrity and consummate professionalism&quot; and as &quot;a paragon of impartiality&quot; as a narrator and moderator, of British politics.

In 2005, he hosted a BBC One series, &quot;A Picture of Britain&quot;, celebrating British and Irish paintings, poetry, music and landscapes. In June 2007 he wrote and presented a follow-up, the BBC series, &quot;How We Built Britain&quot;, in which he explored the history of British architecture by visiting a region of Britain and its historic buildings each week. David Dimbleby also presented a new series on BBC One, &quot;Seven Ages of Britain&quot;. In early editions of the programme, he looked at the Bayeux Tapestry and exhibits to do with Thomas Becket.

On 12 November 2009, Dimbleby missed his first &quot;Question Time&quot; in over fifteen years, having been taken to hospital as a precaution after being briefly knocked out by a rearing bullock at his farm in Sussex.

===2010s===
Dimbleby hosted the third of three televised election debates featuring the leaders of the three main political parties held in the run-up to the 2010 general election. On the night of the 2010 general election, Dimbleby hosted the BBC coverage, along with Jeremy Vine, Jeremy Paxman, Nick Robinson, and Emily Maitlis. Presenting from BBC Television Centre Studio 1, he was an anchor, and involved in commentary contributions, guest interviews and introducing live outside broadcasts. In 2013, Dimbleby presented &quot;Britain and the Sea&quot; and a year later, he presented &quot;The European Union: In or Out&quot;. In 2015, Dimbleby hosted the first BBC general election debate, in spite of the fact that neither Prime Minister David Cameron nor Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg took part.

Dimbleby hosted the EU referendum results show on BBC One, BBC News and BBC World News overnight on 23–24 June 2016, when the UK became the first and only country to vote to leave the European Union. In this programme, he made the following quote to the country when the BBC released its forecast for a Leave win at 04:40 BST:

On 20 April 2017, the BBC announced that Dimbleby would host their coverage of the 2017 general election, despite having previously said that the 2015 general election would be his last. On 17 June 2018, the BBC announced that Dimbleby would leave &quot;Question Time&quot; after 25 years at the end of that year. On 7 December 2018, the BBC announced that Fiona Bruce would take over presenting duties from January 2019. Since his retirement from &quot;Question Time&quot;, Dimbleby has presented occasional documentaries for the BBC.

===Post-&quot;Question Time&quot;===
In 2019, and in some of his first work outside the BBC for decades, he presented an acclaimed series of podcasts on the life of media mogul Rupert Murdoch entitled &quot;The Sun King&quot;. This focused on various key moments in Murdoch&#x27;s professional career such as his takeover of newspapers around the world, Fox News, his battles with print unions and the phone hacking scandal. It also attempts to examine Murdoch&#x27;s personal motivations and his political influence.

In 2020, Dimbleby continued his foray into podcasting, presenting a series on the lead-up to the Iraq War. The series examined the events in the lead-up to the 2003 invasion asking whether it was justified at the time, and whether it could have been avoided. It also closely analysed the relationship between George W. Bush and Tony Blair, with Blair being interviewed as part of the series.

In October 2020, Dimbleby said he was again considering putting his name forward for chairman of the BBC.

In September 2022, Dimbleby came out of retirement to commentate on the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II for the BBC, in particular for the committal service at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor. In 2023 and 2024, he also continued his long standing role as BBC narrator of the National Service of Remembrance at the Cenotaph.

In October 2022, Dimbleby stated that the BBC does not appropriately question the power of the royal family. He said that the BBC would not address controversial topics to do with the monarchy, such as its ability to change tax legislation, or the fact that the Duchy of Cornwall does not pay capital gains tax, and stated his disagreement that such matters were not examined. He also stated his shock over the amount of control the monarchy have over broadcasting covering them.

==Personal life==
Although the brothers presented election coverage on competing channels, when asked in an interview about rival ITV&#x27;s plans to include a riverboat party with the likes of Kevin Spacey and Richard Branson in their 2005 election broadcast, Dimbleby commented, &quot;They&#x27;ve got Jonathan Dimbleby, what do they need Kevin Spacey for?&quot;

Dimbleby has three children with his first wife, Josceline Dimbleby, a cookery writer: Liza, an artist; Henry, a chef and co-founder of the fast-food chain Leon; and Kate, a jazz and folk singer.

In 2000, Dimbleby married Belinda Giles, a granddaughter of Herbrand Sackville, 9th Earl De La Warr, with whom he had a son, Fred, in February 1998. Dimbleby lives in Folkington, near Polegate, East Sussex, and Pimlico, London. He previously had a home in Dittisham, near Dartmouth, Devon. He is a supporter of Tranmere Rovers.

==Honours==
Dimbleby was made an honorary graduate of the University of Essex in 2005, and is the President of the Institute for Citizenship. In 2019, he received the Special Recognition Award for his services to news and current affairs at the National Television Awards in London.

<text>Alfonso Ramón López (August 20, 1908 – October 30, 2005) was a Spanish-American professional baseball catcher and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Brooklyn Robins / Dodgers, Boston Bees, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Cleveland Indians between 1928 and 1947, and was the manager for the Cleveland Indians and the Chicago White Sox from 1951 to 1965 and during portions of the 1968 and 1969 seasons. Due to his Spanish ancestry and &quot;gentlemanly&quot; nature, he was nicknamed &quot;El Señor&quot;.

As a player, López was a two-time All-Star known for his defensive skills, leadership, and durability, as he established a major league record for career games played at catcher (1,918) that stood for decades. As a manager, his .584 career winning percentage ranks fourth best in major league history among managers of at least 2,000 games. His 1954 Cleveland Indians and 1959 Chicago White Sox teams were the only squads to interrupt the New York Yankees&#x27; string of American League pennants from to , inclusive. Over the course of 18 full seasons as a baseball manager (15 in the major leagues and 3 in the minor leagues), López&#x27;s teams never finished with a losing record. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977.

Al López&#x27;s parents immigrated to the United States from Spain shortly before his birth, and he grew up in the immigrant community of Ybor City in Tampa, Florida. He retired with his family to his hometown after his baseball career, and his accomplishments were commemorated in Tampa in the name of a baseball stadium (Al López Field) and a public park which bears his name and features his statue. His childhood home was moved next door to the Ybor City State Museum and is the site of the Tampa Baseball Museum.

==Early life==

Al López was the son of Modesto and Faustina (née Vásquez) López, who were married in Spain before immigrating to Havana, Cuba in the mid-1890s. They had several children in Cuba as Modesto worked as a &quot;tabaquero&quot; (cigar maker) in one of Havana&#x27;s many cigar factories. In 1906, Modesto went to the Cuban-Spanish-Italian immigrant community of Ybor City in Tampa, Florida, to seek better wages and living conditions, temporarily leaving his family behind until he had established a home in their new country. Faustina and their six children joined him in Ybor City several months later, and the family made Tampa their permanent home. Alfonso Ramón López, the seventh of nine children, was born there on August 20, 1908.

Ybor City was a thriving immigrant neighborhood during Al López&#x27;s childhood with a population of over 10,000. The cigar industry was the most important in town, and most residents were employed either by one of the dozens of large cigar factories or by businesses catering to the cigar industry and its employees. Modesto Lopez found work as a skilled selector in a cigar factory, which involved sorting raw tobacco leaves for use in different grades of cigars. Al often visited his father&#x27;s workplace as a child and later said that he &quot;hated&quot; the smell of tobacco leaves that permeated the building and clung to his father&#x27;s clothing when he came home from the factory. &quot;I vowed never to work in one.&quot;

As a teenager, López took a job delivering Cuban bread door to door for La Joven Francesca Bakery, which was located in a building which later became the Ybor City State Museum. He began to follow baseball when his elder brother Emilio introduced him to the game during the 1920 World Series, which coincidentally involved two teams that Lopez would later play for - Cleveland and Brooklyn. According to Al López, his brother Emilio also had excellent baseball talent, but he himself was more driven to excel at the game.

==Baseball player==
López&#x27;s professional career began in when, at the age of 16, he signed on as a catcher with the Class-D Tampa Smokers of the Florida State League, quitting his job at the bakery and dropping out of high school at Sacred Heart College (later known as Jesuit High School) to focus on baseball. His starting salary with the Smokers was $150 ($ today) per month, which was much needed by the large Lopez family since his father&#x27;s health was deteriorating and he could not work regularly. (Modesto Lopez died of throat cancer in 1926.)

Soon after signing with the Smokers, Al López impressed Hall of Fame pitcher Walter Johnson with his catching skills during a winter barnstorming exhibition game. At Johnson&#x27;s recommendation, Al was hired as a practice catcher for the Washington Senators during spring training in 1925, a valuable learning opportunity that he later credited with making him a better ballplayer. The Senators offered the Smokers $1000 for López&#x27;s contract, but the minor league club demanded $10,000, which the major league club thought too exorbitant for a young player with only one year of professional baseball experience. Instead, López moved steadily up the minor leagues ranks in subsequent seasons and made his major league debut in with Brooklyn.

After splitting time between the major and minor leagues for two seasons, López became the Dodgers&#x27; primary catcher in at the age of 21, and he remained a regular starter in the major leagues over the next 17 seasons. His best offensive campaign came in , when he hit .301, stole 10 bases, and finished 10th in National League MVP voting. Overall, he compiled modest career batting numbers, including 613 runs, 51 home runs, and 652 RBIs and a .261 batting average. He was better known for his defense, leadership, and his ability to work with various pitchers, which earned him two trips to the All-Star game and respect around the league.

Over a major league playing career which ran from 1928 until , López played for the Brooklyn Robins / Dodgers (1928, 1930-), Boston Bees (-), Pittsburgh Pirates (1940-) and Cleveland Indians (1947). 
In , López surpassed Gabby Hartnett&#x27;s major league record for career games as a catcher, and when he retired after the 1947 season, his major league record for games caught stood at 1,918. This record was not broken until by Bob Boone, and the National League record was broken by Gary Carter in . He caught 117 shutouts during his career, ranking him 13th all-time among major league catchers.

Lopez was also last player to hit a home run that bounced over the fence, which happened on September 12, 1930. The rule was changed the following year to make such a hit a ground-rule double. 

==Baseball manager==

===Minor leagues===
López decided to seek a job as a baseball coach or manager upon retiring after the 1947 season, which he&#x27;d spent as the backup catcher for the Cleveland Indians. Bill Veeck, the new owner of the team, was unhappy with how Indians player-manager Lou Boudreau had handled the club, and he asked López if he would be interested in taking the position. López declined, explaining that he did not want to appear to have undermined Boudreau to steal his job and preferred to gain managerial experience with another club. The decision was a positive one for both parties, as the Indians won the 1948 World Series and Boudreau was named the American League MVP.

Meanwhile, López began his managing career in 1948 with the Indianapolis Indians, the Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27;s Class AAA minor league affiliate. He spent three years in Indianapolis, leading his squads to one first place and two second-place finishes in the American Association while also serving as the team&#x27;s reserve catcher. Before the 1950 season, López re-signed with the Indianapolis Indians for the largest salary of any manager in American Association history, with a clause in his contract which allowed for him to leave if offered a managerial position with a major league club.

===Major Leagues===
====Cleveland Indians====
After having declined an opportunity to become the club&#x27;s manager in 1947, López accepted an offer to become the Cleveland Indians&#x27;s new manager in . Under López, the Indians won over 90 games each season from 1951 to 1953, but came in second to the New York Yankees each year. In , Lopez&#x27;s squad won a then-American League record 111 games to capture the AL pennant, but were swept by Willie Mays and the New York Giants in the 1954 World Series in one of the biggest upsets in World Series history.
Lopez&#x27;s Indians again finished in second place behind the Yankees in 1955 and 1956. During the latter season, López became &quot;incensed&quot; at Cleveland fans and management as the season progressed. Star third baseman Al Rosen slumped late in the year while playing injured, and López felt that the Indians&#x27; team management had not supported or defended his injured player from fans&#x27; booing and criticism. López was so disheartened over the situation that he resigned from the club on the last day of the season. Lopez finished his Indians career with a record of 570 wins and 354 losses, and his .617 winning percentage is still the best in franchise history.

====Chicago White Sox====

Lopez agreed to become the new manager of the Chicago White Sox about a month after resigning in Cleveland. The White Sox did not have the power hitters of Lopez&#x27;s Cleveland teams, but they had more speed with players such as Nellie Fox, Minnie Miñoso and Luis Aparicio. Consequently, López changed his offensive strategy to fit the roster. The White Sox stole over 100 bases every season from 1957 to 1961, consistently leading the American League in that category and often almost doubling the total of the next highest team, earning them the nickname &quot;Go-Go Sox&quot;.

In , his first year in Chicago, López&#x27;s White Sox won 90 games and finished in second place behind the Yankees while the Indians suffered through a losing season. Chicago again finished second in , but finally broke through and won the American League pennant in , losing to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series. By this time, Lopez was very well respected and in-demand manager, and in the middle of the 1960 season, a friend of New York Yankees president Dan Topping told an Associated Press reporter that López would replace Yankees manager Casey Stengel. (Stengel had managed López years earlier when López was a catcher for Brooklyn and Boston.) Despite rumored and confirmed inquiries from other teams, López stayed with Chicago until 1965, finishing in second place five times and never posting fewer than 82 wins.

López retired to the White Sox front office after the 1965 season due to a chronic stomach condition and assumed the title of team vice president. He returned to managing in July 1968, when White Sox manager Eddie Stanky was fired. Lopez was able to get most of his former coaches to return to the team. However, he had to undergo an appendectomy shortly after taking over as manager and missed most of the rest of the season. He agreed to manage the White Sox again in , but continuing health issues forced him to resign in early May, less than a month into the season.

===Managing style===

López was known for never scolding or shouting at his players and avoiding pep talks in lieu of constructive criticism. Indians owner Bill Veeck commented that López&#x27;s only fault as a manager was that he was &quot;too decent&quot;, a description that López took as a compliment. Veeck also said that López&#x27;s &quot;completely relaxed&quot; leadership &quot;squeezed every drop of talent out of his teams&quot;.

Describing López and his managerial style, a 1957 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; piece said, &quot;For Lopez, managing is a constant worry, a nervous strain, a jittery agony. Some managers thus beset relieve the harrowing pressure by exploding in sudden rages at players and sportswriters, or else by maintaining an almost sphinx-like silence in an effort to remain calm. But Lopez is a gentleman — a decent, thoughtful, exceptionally courteous man. He seldom permits himself the luxury of a temper tantrum, and he talks to anyone who talks to him.&quot; Later, his son shared that, while he did not demonstratively show it, his father hated to lose, and suffered from chronic insomnia and stomach issues during the baseball season.

Tommy John, who spent 26 years in MLB, said &quot;Lopez had a better handle on all the facets of the game than any manager I ever played for. He knew about hitting, offense, defense, pitching, catching, and strategy. The Senior, as he was dubbed, also understood player psychology, and knew how to communicate with his players. He was tough to play for in that he demanded so much out of you, but that just made you a better performer. Al was the type of manager who was smart enough, and secure enough, not to overmanage. He threw the bats and balls out on the field and simply let you play.&quot;

Because of his Spanish ancestry and his &quot;gentlemanly&quot; nature, López was given the nickname &quot;El Señor&quot;.

===Managerial record===
López&#x27;s .584 winning percentage is 9th all time in Major League Baseball history. At the time of his retirement, his 1,410 MLB managerial wins ranked 11th all-time, and were the 26th most wins as of the end of the 2016 season. In 18 full seasons as a minor league and major league manager, he never had a losing record. His 1954 Indians and 1959 White Sox teams were the only non-Yankee clubs to win the AL pennant between and inclusive, and his 840 wins with the White Sox still rank second in franchise history, behind Jimmy Dykes (899).


==Personal life and legacy==

Al López met Evelyn &quot;Connie&quot; Kearney, a dancer at the Hollywood Club in New York, while he was playing for Brooklyn in the early 1930s, and the couple often went on double dates with teammate Tony Cuccinello and his wife. When López was traded to Boston in 1935, he and Connie found it difficult to conduct a long-distance relationship, so she soon joined him. They married on October 7, 1939, and had a son, Al Jr., in 1940.

===Honors===
Al and Connie López retired to his hometown in 1970 to live near family and friends. López was the first Tampa native to play in the major leagues, the first to manage a major league team, the first to manage his team to a World Series (Lou Piniella and Tony La Russa each did so later), and the first to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. As such, he was the recipient of many honors in his hometown, both during and after his long baseball career.

Lopez was the manager of the Cleveland Indians and had just led them to the World Series when the city of Tampa built a new minor league and spring training ballpark. It was named Al López Field, and the date of the dedication ceremony (October 6, 1954) was declared &quot;Al López Day&quot; in the city of Tampa. The Chicago White Sox were the ballpark&#x27;s first spring training tenants, and when Lopez became the new White Sox manager in 1957, he had the unusual honor for several seasons of managing home games in his hometown in a ballpark named after himself. Later in life, López would recall a spring training incident in which an umpire with whom he was arguing threatened to throw him out of a game there. &quot;You can&#x27;t throw me out of this ballpark&quot;, protested Lopez, &quot;This is my ballpark – Al López Field!&quot; The umpire ejected him anyway, causing Lopez to exclaim, &quot;He threw me out of my own ballpark!&quot;

López was selected for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee as part of the Class of 1977. He served as the AL&#x27;s honorary team captain in the 1990 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.
Al López Field was demolished in to make room for a potential major league facility that was never built. López lived a few miles from the ballpark that bore his name. In a 1992 interview, he said that the razing of the stadium &quot;wasn&#x27;t very disappointing. I saw a diagram of the new stadium, and I didn&#x27;t feel bad because I thought they were going to build a bigger one and a better one. After that, something happened, and they never built the ballpark. Then it was a disappointment.&quot; Soon thereafter, the city of Tampa changed the name of Horizon Park, a large city park near the site of the razed stadium, to Al López Park, and installed a large statue of López in his catching gear. The statue was dedicated on October 3, 1992, a date which was officially proclaimed as a second &quot;Al López Day&quot; in the city. Soon thereafter, his high school, Jesuit High School, which is located across the street from Al López Park, named its new athletic center in Lopez&#x27;s honor.

When the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays began play in in nearby St. Petersburg, Lopez threw one of several ceremonial first pitches along with fellow Hall of Famers Ted Williams, Stan Musial, and Monte Irvin. The Rays annually award the &quot;Al López Award&quot; to the &quot;most outstanding rookie&quot; in the team&#x27;s spring camp each year.

In 2013, López&#x27;s boyhood home was moved to a lot across the street from the Ybor City State Museum, where it is undergoing renovation to become the &quot;Tampa Baseball Museum at the Al López House&quot;.

===Death===
Al López died on October 30, 2005, at the age of 97 after suffering a heart attack at his son&#x27;s home. His death came four days after the White Sox won the 2005 World Series, their first world championship in 88 years and their first AL pennant since Lopez had led them to the World Series in 1959. Lopez was the last living person who had played major league baseball during the 1920s, and was the longest-lived member of the Baseball Hall of Fame until Bobby Doerr passed him in 2015.

Connie López had died in September 1983. Al López was survived by his son, three grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.

<text>Edmund Pevensie is a fictional character in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; series. He is a principal character in three of the seven books (&quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, and &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;), and a lesser character in two others (&quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; and &quot;The Last Battle&quot;).

In &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, Edmund betrays his siblings to the White Witch while under her influence, but as the story goes on, he accepts the error of his ways. He is redeemed with the intervention of Aslan and joins the fight against the witch. Fulfilling an ancient prophecy, he becomes King Edmund the Just, King of Narnia, and with sisters Susan and Lucy, co-ruler under High King Peter.

==Biography==

===Characteristics===
Edmund is a spiteful and mean-spirited boy at the beginning of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;. By the end of the book, and throughout the rest of the series, Edmund is seen to be loyal, courageous, logical, and mature. In his adult life, as a king of Narnia, it is revealed that he handles many of Narnia&#x27;s negotiations and transactions, as seen in &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; when Shasta runs into Edmund in Tashbaan the capital city of Calormen, where he has accompanied Susan to discuss a marriage proposal from Prince Rabadash. Edmund becomes protective particularly of Lucy, and acts as a voice of reason to Peter, who is more apt to become carried away.

On his return to Narnia in &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, he makes friendships with both Prince Caspian and Reepicheep, which develop further in the &quot;Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;.

Edmund acts as confidante and confessor to his cousin Eustace in the novel &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;.

Aslan proclaims him King Edmund the Just, but in the letter sent to Miraz in the novel &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; he styles himself &quot;Duke of Lantern Waste and Count of the Western March, Knight of the Noble Order of the Table&quot;.

===&quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;===

In &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, Edmund is one of the main characters, and the character who develops the most over the course of story.

It is implied in the book that Edmund started life as a likeable person, but then changed for the worse and became spiteful after starting at a new school. Edmund makes unjust and hurtful comments to Lucy when she first finds the entrance to Narnia through the wardrobe, and is the second of the Pevensie children to go to Narnia, after following Lucy to mock her during a game of hide and seek.

He walks some distance into the forest, convinced that he will find Lucy, but instead he meets the White Witch (who introduces herself as the Queen of Narnia) and eats some enchanted Turkish delight. As a result, he promises the Witch that he will bring his siblings to her castle, not knowing that she intends to kill them all to prevent the fulfillment of a Narnian prophecy.

Upon returning, he denies having been in Narnia, not wishing to admit that Lucy&#x27;s story is true. When they all enter Narnia, the children are taken under protection of Mr and Mrs Beaver, but while the others are having an in-depth conversation about the arrival of Aslan, Edmund sneaks away to the White Witch&#x27;s castle, where he expects to be made a prince and later a king.

However, his opinion of the Witch changes when she reveals her true character in her castle. She harshly berates him for coming alone, only offers him hard bread and cold water for his efforts, and does not shelter him from the cold on her sledge. Hearing from him that Aslan has arrived in Narnia, she heads straight towards Aslan&#x27;s camp at the Stone Table, having first ordered Maugrim to find and kill his siblings and the Beavers. Edmund realises the full extent of her evil on their journey when she turns a group of creatures enjoying a feast provided by Father Christmas to stone.

The Witch prepares to put Edmund to death as a traitor, but a rescue party sent by Aslan arrives, frees him, and brings him to his siblings and the rest of Aslan&#x27;s army. Edmund becomes fully reformed after a long conversation with Aslan.

The next day, the Witch arrives and reiterates her claim to Edmund&#x27;s life. She and Aslan work out an agreement that Aslan will die in Edmund&#x27;s place (though the other Narnians do not know this); but unknown to her, the magical nature of this contract allows Aslan to be brought back to life.

While Aslan and Edmund&#x27;s sisters race to free the cursed prisoners in the Witch&#x27;s castle, Edmund fights in Peter&#x27;s army in battle, where he neutralizes the White Witch&#x27;s most dangerous advantage, her wand, and is gravely wounded. He is saved from death by the timely arrival of reinforcements led by Aslan, and by Lucy, who gives Edmund a dose of a magic cordial which can quickly heal any injury.

In the final chapter, Edmund is crowned by Aslan as co-ruler of Narnia with his siblings. After fifteen years in Narnia, he and his siblings return to England, where they all become children again.

===&quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;===
King Edmund, Queen Susan, Tumnus the Faun and a raven named Sallowpad are visitors in the country of Calormen, where Crown Prince Rabadash wants to force Susan to marry him. Mistaking Shasta for the missing prince Corin Thunderfist of Narnia&#x27;s ally Archenland, Edmund scolds the young boy for running off and making everyone worry. The Narnians manage to escape, which leads Rabadash to convince his father the Tisroc that they should take Narnia by invading Archenland.

Shasta brings warning of Rabadash&#x27;s invasion to Narnia, and meets Edmund once again. Edmund gently reminds Shasta that he should not eavesdrop, but is clear that all is well before they march to Anvard to stop Rabadash. Edmund, Shasta, and Corin&#x27;s father, King Lune of Archenland, lead the fight against the Calormene army and defeat them. Shasta is then recognized as Prince Cor, the long-lost heir of Archenland.

Edmund&#x27;s own redemption lends him perspective during the judgment of Rabadash; despite the fact that Rabadash has acted treacherously, Edmund argues against killing him, saying (in reference to himself) &quot;Even a traitor may mend. I have known one who did.&quot;

===&quot;Prince Caspian&quot;===

Edmund and his siblings return to Narnia to help Caspian, rightful King of Narnia, against King Miraz the Usurper. He convinces Trumpkin the dwarf that they are the Kings and Queens from the legend by defeating him in a sparring practice. He later helps Peter and Trumpkin defend Caspian against Nikabrik, a hag, and a werewolf, which Edmund kills. Edmund is also there to witness Peter&#x27;s duel against Miraz.

He has since become more caring and protective of Lucy, and is the first person to believe her when she sees Aslan, supporting her against the disbelief of Trumpkin and her other siblings. Edmund is shown in a more positive light in this book than in The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. His demeanor is more cooperative and loyal, even under the guidance of Peter, who is unprepared for the new Narnia and its current status. He rarely stands up to Peter openly but often subtly takes charge.

In the film, Edmund proves to be much more mature than Peter or Caspian, but he stays out of their arguments. Edmund sneaks into Miraz&#x27;s castle ahead of the army to signal that it is safe to enter, and later presents Peter&#x27;s proposition for a duel to Miraz and goads him into accepting, thereby buying them time. Also in the film, he stops the White Witch from being brought back from the dead by forcing his sword into the ice wall through which she is trying to re-enter Narnia, smashing it.

===&quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;===
Edmund, Lucy and their cousin Eustace enter the world of Narnia through a magic painting, and end up in the ocean. They are rescued and brought on board the Dawn Treader, where they are reunited with King Caspian, who is on a quest to search for the missing Lords that his uncle had sent to explore other lands some years before. This is Edmund and Lucy&#x27;s last adventure in the world of Narnia since Aslan told them they were getting too old to come back. By this point Edmund&#x27;s character has matured a great deal which can be seen in the way he deals with his cousin Eustace and in the power struggle with Caspian. Edmund and Lucy are noticeably close in this installment, as can be seen in the way they defend each other against Eustace. When Eustace changes his behavior after being changed back from a dragon, Edmund mentions his own betrayal and says that Eustace was not worse than he was. While on Ramandu&#x27;s Island, Edmund says to Ramandu&#x27;s daughter that when he looks at her, he cannot help believing what she says, but the same might happen with a witch.

===&quot;The Last Battle&quot;===
After seeing a vision of King Tirian of Narnia pleading for their help in England, Peter and Edmund go to the Ketterleys&#x27; old home in London to dig up the magic rings that Professor Kirke buried in the yard as a boy in &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; to be used by Eustace and Jill to reach Narnia. They are waiting for the others at the train platform when the accident happens.

When King Tirian sees the Seven Friends of Narnia in his dream/vision, he thinks that, as with Peter, that Edmund &#x27;had already the face of a King and a warrior&#x27;.

Edmund accompanies everyone, except Susan, into Aslan&#x27;s country. Like his brother and younger sister, he is killed in the train crash and is transferred to Aslan&#x27;s country, where they all live forever.

<text>Edward James Roye (February 3, 1815 – February 11, 1872) was a Liberian merchant and politician who served as the fifth president of Liberia from 1870 until his overthrow in the 1871 Liberian coup d&#x27;état and subsequent death. He had previously served as the fourth Chief Justice of Liberia from 1865 until 1868. He was the first member of Liberia&#x27;s True Whig Party to serve as president.

== Early life ==
Roye was born on February 3, 1815, in Newark, Ohio. He was the son of John and Nancy Roye, freed African-American slaves who had moved to Ohio from Kentucky and bought a property in Newark. They were reportedly of Igbo origin.

Roye&#x27;s father managed a ferry across the Wabash River at Terre Haute, Indiana. He owned property in Newark, Terre Haute and Vandalia, Illinois. Due to his family&#x27;s prosperity, Roye was able to attend Ohio University. He moved to Terre Haute after his father&#x27;s death in 1836, where he established the African-American community&#x27;s largest barbershop.

==Emigration to Liberia==
In 1846, attracted by the American Colonization Society&#x27;s promotion of the relocation of African Americans to the colony of Liberia in West Africa, Roye emigrated to the colony with his family at the age of 31. There he set up business as a merchant, reportedly bringing $1,000 of capital () with him. The next year, the colony gained independence. Within three years of his arrival, Roye became active in Liberian politics, serving as a representative and speaker (1849–1850) of the Liberian House of Representatives, and as chief justice of the Supreme Court of Liberia, He was also the Secretary of the Treasury. and unsuccessfully contested the presidential elections in 1855.

In 1857, Roye purchased the brig &quot;Eusebia&quot; for the purposes of conducting a trading business between Monrovia and New York City. His typical cargo included camwood, palm oil and ivory. By 1870 he reportedly had a fortune estimated at $200,000 ().

==Presidency (1870–71)==

Roye was inaugurated as President of Liberia on January 3, 1870. In the decades after 1868, escalating economic difficulties weakened the state&#x27;s dominance over the coastal indigenous tribal peoples. Conditions worsened, the cost of imports was far greater than the income generated by exports of its commodity crops of coffee, rice, palm oil, sugarcane, and timber. Liberia tried desperately to modernize its largely agricultural economy.

===Financial problems===
In 1871, Roye tasked the speaker of the House of Representatives, William Spencer Anderson, with negotiating a new loan from British financiers. Anderson secured $500,000 under strict terms from the British consul-general, David Chinery, but was heavily criticised and eventually arrested. Anderson was apparently tried the following year for his part in securing the loan. He was found not guilty, but he was shot to death while leaving the courthouse.

=== End of presidency ===

Roye was removed from the presidency on October 26, 1871, in what some allies called a coup d&#x27;état. The circumstances surrounding his removal from office, however, remain murky and highly partisan. What is known is that he was jailed for several months following his ousting and soon died under equally mysterious circumstances. His unpopular loans with Britain as well as fears from the Republican Party that he was planning to cancel the upcoming presidential election were among the reasons for his forced removal.

== Death and legacy ==
No specific historical record is available about the date and circumstances of Roye&#x27;s death. Varying accounts indicate that he was killed on February 11 or February 12, 1872. Another account suggests that he drowned on February 12, 1872, while trying to reach a British ship in Monrovia harbor.

The portrait of President Roye in the gallery of the Presidential Mansion in Monrovia notes his date of death as February 11, 1872.

The town of Royesville, bordering the city of Brewerville, was named after Roye. President William Tubman named the presidential yacht &quot;The Edward J. Roye,&quot; after President Roye. The headquarters of the True Whig Party was named the Edward J. Roye Building. His portrait his featured on the front of the five-dollar banknote of the Liberian dollar.

<doc id="747440" wikidata="Q3110908" url="?curid=747440" title="Gordon Kahl">
<text>Gordon Wendell Kahl (January 8, 1920 – June 3, 1983) was an American World War II veteran, farmer and tax protester who was known for being a one-time member of the Posse Comitatus movement and for his involvement in two fatal shootouts with law enforcement officers in the United States in 1983.

==Early life==
Gordon Kahl was born in Wells County, North Dakota, on January 8, 1920, to Frederick (1886–1953) and Edna (Laudenslager) Kahl (1892–1967). Kahl had three sisters and one brother. Raised on a farm, Kahl was a highly decorated turret gunner during World War II, shooting down ten enemy planes. After the war, &quot;he had a farm near Heaton, Wells County, North Dakota, [but] bounced around the Texas oilfields in later life as a mechanic and general worker.&quot;

In 1967, Kahl wrote a letter to the Internal Revenue Service stating that he would no longer pay taxes to the, in his words, &quot;Synagogue of Satan under the 2nd plank of the Communist Manifesto&quot;. In 1975 Kahl organized the first Texas chapter of the Posse Comitatus and became the state coordinator. In 1976 he appeared on a Texas television program with fellow tax protester William M. Rinehart and stated that the income tax was illegal and encouraged others not to pay their income taxes.

==Criminal conviction and prison==
On November 16, 1976, Kahl was charged with willful failure to file federal income tax returns for the years 1973 and 1974, under . He was convicted on each count in April and June 1977, and was sentenced to two years in prison and a fine of $2,000. Kahl served eight months in prison in 1977. One year of the sentence was suspended, as was the fine, and the court placed Kahl on probation for five years. Kahl appealed his conviction, but the conviction was affirmed in 1978 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

==Activity after prison==

W. M. Rinehart died of a heart attack while in prison at the same time as Kahl, who subsequently left and never returned to the Posse Comitatus group. He then became active in the township movement, an early version of the sovereign citizen movement. This movement sought to form parallel courts and governments purportedly based on English common law and constitutional law, and to withdraw recognition of the U.S. federal government. Township movement supporters attempted to organize among farmers in the American Midwest during the 1980s farm crisis.

==Confrontation and shootout near Medina, North Dakota==
On February 13, 1983, the U.S. Marshals attempted to arrest Kahl for violating his parole as he was leaving a Posse Comitatus meeting in Medina, North Dakota. In the car with Kahl were his wife Joan, his son Yorie Von, and three others who had been at the meeting. According to Scott Faul&#x27;s testimony, both Gordon Kahl and Yorie Von Kahl were armed with Ruger Mini-14 rifles. The conflict began when federal marshals created a roadblock a few miles north of Medina. When the Kahl party met the marshals at the roadblock, a short but intense firefight erupted. The gun battle left Marshals Kenneth Muir and Robert Cheshire dead, and Marshal Jim Hopson, Medina Police Department Officer Steve Schnabel, and Stutsman County Sheriff Deputy Bradley Kapp injured. Yorie Von Kahl was also wounded during the firefight. The Kahl party fired over a dozen rounds during the gunfight, while the marshals and officers fired eight. Three lawmen fired their weapons during the confrontation, and only one, Marshal Carl Wigglesworth, escaped the gunfight unharmed by hiding in a ditch.

According to the U.S. Marshals Service, the Kahl party was traveling north out of Medina in two vehicles. Deputy Bradley Kapp and Marshals Robert Cheshire and Jim Hopson followed the Kahl party, while Medina police officer Steven Schnabel and Marshals Kenneth Muir and Carl Wigglesworth moved south towards Medina in two cars to intercept the Kahl party.

At one point, the Kahl party took a wrong turn off of a highway. As they attempted to back out, Cheshire blocked their escape with his vehicle, while Marshal Muir and Officer Schnabel blocked the Kahls from the north. It was then that the arrest attempt was made. The lawmen exited the vehicles with their weapons drawn and ordered Kahl to surrender. Gordon Kahl, his son Yorie Von, and friend Scott Faul exited their vehicles armed with Ruger Mini-14 rifles. Gordon took cover behind his vehicle, Yorie Von took cover behind a telephone pole, and Scott Faul ran from the highway towards a set of trees, seeking better cover. Marshal Wigglesworth ran after Faul and attempted to cut him off but became stuck in a thick swamp. Meanwhile, Cheshire attempted to get Kahl to surrender, but Kahl refused and told the marshals to &quot;back off&quot;. The tense standoff continued for several more minutes before a shot was abruptly fired by one of the men.

The U.S. Marshals Service stated that Yorie Von Kahl fired the first shot at Cheshire from behind a telephone pole. The shot struck Cheshire in the chest, fatally wounding him. Yorie Von then fired a second shot at Deputy Bradley Kapp but missed. Kapp returned fire with a shotgun and fired four times at Yorie Von, seriously wounding him in the chest and face. As Kapp turned from the downed Yorie Von, Gordon fired at least one round through the windshield of Kapp&#x27;s vehicle, wounding Kapp in the forehead with glass fragments. As Kapp fell behind his car door, Gordon fired two or three more times, and a round struck and shattered Kapp&#x27;s body armor. The fatally wounded Cheshire managed to fire three rounds from his AR-15, all of which missed. Meanwhile, Scott Faul, taking cover in the nearby woods, fired at least seven rounds at Kapp and Cheshire&#x27;s vehicle. One of Faul&#x27;s shots hit the already wounded Cheshire a second time, and a bullet blew off Kapp&#x27;s index finger. A third shot hit the pavement, and a piece of asphalt struck Marshal Hopson in the ear, causing Hopson to suffer permanent brain damage.

Wounded and out of ammunition, Kapp retreated to a ditch, but was unable to reload his shotgun due to the wound in his hand. 

With Kapp down, Gordon turned to face US Marshal Kenneth Muir and Medina police officer Steve Schnabel, just as Muir fired off one round from a .38 caliber revolver. Muir&#x27;s shot hit the already wounded Yorie Von Kahl square in the chest, but the bullet struck a revolver Yorie Von wore on a shoulder holster, and therefore did not enter his heart. Before Muir could fire another shot, Kahl fired one round from his rifle at Muir, killing the marshal with a shot to the chest. Schnabel tried to return fire with his shotgun, but Gordon fired three more rounds at the officer as he tried to aim his weapon. One shot ricocheted, striking Schnabel in the back of the leg. The wounded Schnabel retreated to the side of the road and took cover in a ditch. The entire firefight lasted about thirty seconds.

Kahl then moved towards Cheshire&#x27;s vehicle. As Kahl approached, the wounded Kapp decided to flee and began running south, back towards Medina. Kahl chose not to shoot the fleeing officer, and instead turned to the fatally wounded Cheshire, who was trying to climb back inside his vehicle. Seeing that Cheshire was still alive, Kahl killed the dying marshal with two more shots to the head. Gordon Kahl then walked over to Muir and Schnabel&#x27;s vehicles as Scott Faul tended to the wounded Yorie Von Kahl. Moving to the side of the road, Kahl approached and confronted the wounded Schnabel, but chose not to kill him. After taking Schnabel&#x27;s shotgun and revolver, Kahl then took Schnabel&#x27;s police car and, after leaving the wounded Yorie Von Kahl at a Medina health clinic, fled to Arkansas. Kahl abandoned the stolen police car just outside of Medina. Yorie Von Kahl was immediately arrested after being treated at the clinic, while Scott Faul turned himself in to police.

==Police manhunt==

Following the gun battle, Kahl became a wanted fugitive by the FBI, and both local and federal authorities organized a massive manhunt. Several days after the Medina shootout, a SWAT team surrounded Kahl&#x27;s farmhouse in Heaton, North Dakota. Unaware that the farmhouse had been abandoned, the SWAT team fired hundreds of shots into the home, killing Kahl&#x27;s dog, and saturated the house with tear gas. After entering the house, the SWAT team found no sign of Kahl but did discover numerous weapons, ammunition, and white supremacist literature printed by the Posse Comitatus.

==Smithville, Arkansas, shootout and death==
Kahl was being hidden at the property of Arthur H. Russell just outside of Mountain Home, Arkansas. Those who were harboring Kahl were afraid that the U.S. Marshals were getting close to finding out where Kahl was staying, and decided to move him to the residence of Leonard Ginter and his wife Norma Ginter. Kahl hid in their earth-bermed, passive-solar home in Smithville, Arkansas.

Another shootout on June 3, 1983, ended the lives of Kahl and Lawrence County Sheriff Harold Gene Matthews. After FBI agents, U.S. marshals, Arkansas State Police, and local police arrived at the Ginter home, Sheriff Matthews entered the home along with Deputy U.S. Marshal James Hall and Arkansas State Police investigator Ed Fitzpatrick. Matthews entered the kitchen and Kahl emerged from behind a refrigerator; the two men fired almost simultaneously. Kahl fired at least one round, which severely wounded Matthews in the heart, and Matthews fired a single .41 Magnum round from his four-inch Smith &amp; Wesson Model 57 revolver, which hit Kahl in the head and instantly killed him. Hall and Fitzpatrick, hearing the gunfire, fired several shotgun blasts inside the house, accidentally striking Matthews in the torso with buckshot. Matthews managed to get to a police cruiser before he collapsed, and he gasped his last words, &quot;I got him.&quot; After Matthews stumbled out of the house, a SWAT team — unaware that Kahl was dead — began firing thousands of rounds at the house, eventually setting it ablaze by pouring diesel fuel down the house&#x27;s chimney. Kahl&#x27;s burned remains were found the following day. Matthews, critically wounded by the bullet fired from Kahl&#x27;s Mini-14, was taken to the hospital where he died on an operating table.

==Aftermath==
Edwin C. Udey, Arthur H. Russell, Leonard Ginter, and Norma Ginter were all indicted for harboring an concealing a fugitive, and for conspiracy to do the same. They were convicted of all charges. The convictions were upheld on appeal. Leonard was convicted and sentenced to a federal prison, while Norma&#x27;s sentence was suspended. Leonard was released in February 1987.

Leonard and Norma Ginter were each additionally charged with the capital murder of Sheriff Gene Matthews in relation to the federal harboring trial in state court. The capital murder charge was later dropped.

For their part in the Medina shootout, Yorie Von Kahl and Scott Faul were both sentenced to life in prison with eligibility for parole after thirty years. , both have been denied parole at each of their parole hearings.

David Ronald Broer (1939–2022) was acquitted of assaulting a police officer but was convicted of harboring and concealing a fugitive, with conspiracy to do the same. He was sentenced to ten years in prison and released in 1993.

Joan Kahl was acquitted. Yorie Von Kahl is serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution at Pekin, Illinois. Scott Faul is serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution at Sandstone, Minnesota.

Gordon Kahl was considered a martyr among tax protester groups, which helped disseminate his views and radicalize the movement.

==Personal life==
Kahl married Joan Miriam Seil in 1945. They had six children. Linda Kahl Holder, Gordon&#x27;s eldest daughter, was found dead in her car on March 6, 1984, at the age of thirty-six, after committing suicide with a single self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

==Media==
A 1991 movie which was based on these events was titled &quot;In the Line of Duty: Manhunt in the Dakotas&quot; (aka &quot;Midnight Murders&quot;, and in the Netherlands it was titled &quot;In the Line of Duty: The Twilight Murders&quot;), starring actor Rod Steiger as Kahl and Michael Gross as the head FBI agent. The events also inspired the making of the documentary film &quot;Death &amp; Taxes&quot;, which was released in 1993.

In &quot;Downtown Owl: A Novel&quot;, a book by Chuck Klosterman which is set in North Dakota in 1983 and 1984, the saga of Gordon Kahl is a constant topic of discussion among the residents of the fictional town of Owl, North Dakota.

In the 21st century, a South Dakota–based neo-Nazi podcaster whose real name is Riggin Lynn Scheer adopted the name Gordon Kahl online, as a tribute to the original Kahl. Scheer played a key role in promoting a pro-Nazi homeschooling network with thousands of members.

<text>Allan Warnke (October 27, 1946 – June 27, 2021) was a Canadian political scientist, professor and politician. He was a former Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of British Columbia, representing the Richmond-Steveston electoral district from 1991 to 1996.

==Biography==
Before his election to the BC legislature, he ran as a BC Liberal Party candidate in the 1983 provincial election in the dual-member Vancouver-Point Grey riding, and as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada in the 1988 federal election in the riding of North Island—Powell River. He then contested the 1991 provincial election as a BC Liberal candidate, and defeated former MLA Harold Steves of the New Democratic Party to become member of the legislative assembly for Richmond-Steveston. He served as the official opposition critic for aboriginal affairs in the 35th Parliament. He contested the 1993 BC Liberal leadership election and finished in sixth place.

For the 1996 provincial election, he was passed over for the Liberal nomination in favour of Geoff Plant. Warnke contested the election as an independent candidate, finishing in fifth place. He was an unsuccessful candidate in a 1999 provincial by-election in the riding of Delta South. He then ran again for his old seat in the 2001 provincial election, this time finishing in sixth place. He also ran as a candidate of the Canadian Action Party in the 2000 federal election in the riding of Delta—South Richmond, then in 2004 in the riding of Richmond, but was unsuccessful in both attempts.

Warnke was a professor of political science at Vancouver Island University and its predecessor Malaspina University-College, as well as being the department chair. He died suddenly in June 2021 from heart disease and medical complications due to obesity and hypertension. He was predeceased by his wife of forty-one years Geraldine (née Byers).

<text>Taipei American School (TAS; ; abbreviation TAS) is a non-profit private international school with an American-based curriculum located in Tianmu, Shilin District, Taipei, Taiwan. TAS serves students from pre-kindergarten through grade 12. At the high school, students may choose from a range of courses including honors, AP, and IB courses that fulfill the full IB Diploma Program.

Founded in 1949, the school served as a U.S. Department of Defense contract school during the U.S. military presence in Taiwan from the 1950s to 1970s. Upon termination of diplomatic relations between the United States and the ROC in 1979, TAS was reorganized into a private international school. The school is operated by the Taipei American School Foundation under contract to the American Institute in Taiwan, the United States&#x27; quasi-embassy in Taiwan. The school is a member of the G30 Schools Group.

Most graduates of TAS attend colleges and universities in the United States. As required by ROC law, TAS admits only students who hold foreign (i.e. non-ROC) passports.

== History ==
The first meeting of Taipei American School took place on September 26, 1949, in the basement of Presbyterian Theological Seminary at Zhongshan North Road, with eight students. This marked the beginning of the &quot;missionary era&quot; where Taiwanese and American medical missionaries were instrumental in founding TAS and providing it with students. The first class of students included American, European, and Taiwanese students.

By 1951, the influx of missionaries and business people escaping from the communist victory in mainland China caused enrollment to grow to 120 students. By 1952, TAS was forced to relocate to Nong&#x27;an East Road to provide space for the growing student population

In 1953, the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group was established in Taiwan. This brought to the island a large number of U.S. military personnel. Along with these military personnel came their families, including children needing an American-style education. TAS became the school for the children of the U.S. military personnel. In the summer of 1953, TAS constructed a much larger campus at Chang&#x27;an East Road.

In 1956, TAS graduated its first class of 14 seniors. By then, the Chang&#x27;an campus had approximately 50 faculty members and 1,000 students. In 1957, Mr. Wayne Nesbitt served as the first superintendent of the school.

In 1959, TAS purchased a 22 acre (89,000 m2) site in Shilin for a new campus. In March 1960, the kindergarten and lower school moved into a 36-classroom 5-wing complex on the site. The upper school remained at the Chang&#x27;an campus until 1964, when the last upper school facilities were completed. By 1969, TAS enrollment reached its highest point with nearly 3,000 students.

Bordered on two sides by a river, the Shilin campus was prone to flooding during the typhoons experienced on Taiwan when the protective dikes were breached. Cleanup took several days as classrooms were dried out and mud and silt was removed.

In the 1970s, Taiwan&#x27;s transforming economy brought foreign businessmen and overseas Chinese into the local economy, setting the stage for TAS&#x27;s later transformation even as enrollment shrank dramatically due to the U.S. military pull-out from Taiwan. By the late seventies, student enrollment dropped to approximately 700 students. Within a few years, enrollment started to increase again as overseas Chinese with foreign passports arrived in Taiwan searching for American educational facilities for their children. By the early eighties, the majority of students were ethnically Taiwanese and also U.S. citizens.

In September 1989, TAS relocated to its present campus in Tianmu, Taipei. To obtain use of the government land in Tianmu, TAS exchanged title to its Shihlin property for a long-term lease on the Tianmu site at a concessionary rent.

The 50th anniversary of Taipei American School was celebrated in 1999. As part of this celebration, TAS published a book documenting the history of the school: &quot;Ties That Bind&quot;, authored by Richard Vuylsteke. In 2019, TAS celebrated its seventieth anniversary.

== Campus ==


The current campus, completed in 1989, consists of a four-story complex with approximately 200 classrooms. In September 2010, TAS broke ground for the construction of three new buildings on its current campus: the new upper school building featuring science and technology classrooms with research and robotics laboratories, the Liu Lim Arts Center, and another gymnasium with covered and outdoor tennis courts.

The independently operated Taipei Youth Program Association (TYPA) is located at TAS and uses the campus facilities. The school is located directly across the street from Taipei Japanese School.

== Organization ==
TAS is divided into three divisions: lower, middle, and upper schools. The lower school (elementary) includes pre-kindergarten (known as Kindergarten A), kindergarten, and grades 1 through 5. The middle school (junior high) includes grades 6 through 8. The upper school (high school) includes grades 9 through 12. Each division is run by a principal and 2 assistant principals.

The superintendent serves as school head. The Taipei American School Board of Directors a hybrid board consisting of nine elected Board members and two appointed Board members. Elected Board members serve for three-year terms and appointed Board members serve for four-year terms. Board members serve without compensation and have the primary task of formulating and evaluating all school policies and overseeing the school&#x27;s financial affairs. It is their responsibility to see that the resources are in place to support excellence in all areas, always prioritizing the interests of the students first. The Board meets monthly and invites parents and faculty to attend these meetings. Board members are elected by the Taipei American School Association, which consists of all parents or guardians of children attending TAS.

== Student body ==
The combined KA-12 school enrollment is approximately 2500. TAS abides by the Republic of China Foreign Schools Law, which requires all international schools to only admit students who hold non-ROC passports.

== Academics ==
The Upper School offers 30 Advanced Placement (AP) courses. Additionally, the school also offers 37 International Baccalaureate (IB) courses and IB diplomas. Students are often given the chance to take AP and/or IB courses, starting from the 9th grade. In many cases, students can take both AP and IB classes, if school counselor approves.

The Lower school is pre-kindergarten to Grade 5, the Middle school is Grades 6–8, and the Upper school is Grades 9–12 which is a college preparatory program leading to a TAS U.S. high school diploma, Advanced Placement Capstone Diploma or an International Baccalaureate diploma. Almost 100 percent of TAS graduates continue their education at a college or university, the vast majority in the United States. TAS offers support services for mild learning needs.

<doc id="747450" wikidata="Q241599" url="?curid=747450" title="Helena Rubinstein">
<text>Helena Rubinstein (born Chaja Rubinstein; December 25, 1872 – April 1, 1965) was a Polish and American businesswoman, art collector, and philanthropist. A cosmetics entrepreneur, she was the founder and eponym of Helena Rubinstein Incorporated cosmetics company, which made her one of the world&#x27;s richest women.

==Early life==

Rubinstein was the eldest of eight daughters born to Polish Jews, &quot;Augusta&quot; Gitte (Gitel) Shaindel Rubinstein née Silberfeld and Naftoli Hertz &quot;Horace&quot; Rubinstein. Her father was a shopkeeper in Kraków, Lesser Poland, which was then occupied by Austria-Hungary following the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century. The existentialist philosopher Martin Buber was her cousin. She was also the cousin of Ruth Rappaport&#x27;s mother.

==Move to Australia==
After refusing an arranged marriage, Rubinstein emigrated from Poland to Australia in 1896, with no money and little command of the English language. Her stylish clothes and milky complexion did not pass unnoticed among the town&#x27;s ladies, however, and she soon found enthusiastic buyers for the jars of beauty cream in her luggage. She spotted a market where she began to make her own. A key ingredient of the cream, lanolin, was readily at hand.

Coleraine, in the Western Victoria region, where her uncle was a shopkeeper, might have been an &quot;awful place&quot; but was home to some 75 million sheep that secreted abundant quantities of lanolin. These sheep were the wealth of the nation and the Western District&#x27;s vast mobs of merinos produced the finest wool in the land. To disguise the lanolin&#x27;s pungent odour, Rubinstein experimented with lavender, pine bark, and water lilies.

Rubinstein had a falling out with her uncle, but after a stint as a bush governess began waitressing at the Winter Garden tearooms in Melbourne. There, she found an admirer willing to stump up the funds to launch her Crème Valaze, supposedly including herbs imported &quot;from the Carpathian Mountains&quot;. It cost ten pence and sold for six shillings (72 pence). Known to her customers only as Helena, Rubinstein could soon afford to open a salon in fashionable Collins Street, selling glamour as a science to customers whose skin was &quot;diagnosed&quot; and a suitable treatment &quot;prescribed&quot;.

Sydney was next, and within five years, Australian operations were profitable enough to finance a Salon de Beauté Valaze in London. As such, Rubinstein formed one of the world&#x27;s first cosmetic companies. Her business enterprise proved immensely successful and later in life, she used her enormous wealth to support charitable institutions in the fields of education, art, and health.

Rubinstein rapidly expanded her operation. In 1908, her sister Ceska assumed the Melbourne shop&#x27;s operation, and with $100,000, Rubinstein moved to London and began what was to become an international enterprise. (Women at this time could not obtain bank loans, so the money was her own.)

==Marriage and children – London and Paris==
In 1908, she married the Polish-born American journalist Edward William Titus in London. They had two sons, Roy Valentine Titus (London, December 12, 1909 – New York, June 18, 1989) and Horace Titus (London, April 23, 1912 – New York, May 18, 1958). They eventually moved to Paris where she opened a salon in 1912. Her husband helped with writing the publicity and set up a small publishing house, published &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; and hired Samuel Putnam to translate famous model Alice Prin&#x27;s (Kiki de Montparnasse) memoirs, &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Memoirs&quot;.

Rubinstein threw lavish dinner parties and became known for apocryphal quips, such as when an intoxicated French ambassador expressed vitriol toward Edith Sitwell and her brother Sacheverell: Rubinstein, who knew little French, asked a guest what the ambassador had said. &quot;He said, &#x27;Your ancestors burned Joan of Arc. Rubinstein replied, &quot;Well, someone had to do it.&quot;

At another , Marcel Proust asked her what makeup a duchess might wear. She summarily dismissed him because &quot;he smelt of mothballs&quot;. Rubinstein recollected later, &quot;How was I to know he was going to be famous?&quot;

==Move to the United States==
At the outbreak of World War I, she and Titus moved to New York City, where she opened a cosmetics salon in 1915, the forerunner of a chain throughout the country. Rubinstein opened up the boundless American market, and she skilfully used it, despite serious competitors. This was the beginning of her vicious rivalry with another notable woman of the cosmetics industry, Elizabeth Arden. Both Rubinstein and Arden, who died within 18 months of each other, were social climbers. They were both keenly aware of effective marketing and luxurious packaging, the attraction of beauticians in neat uniforms, the value of celebrity endorsements, the perceived value of overpricing and the promotion of the pseudoscience of skincare. The rivalry with Arden lasted all her life. Rubinstein said of her rival, &quot;With her packaging and my product, we could have ruled the world.&quot;

From 1917, Rubinstein took on the manufacturing and wholesale distribution of her products. The &quot;Day of Beauty&quot; in the various salons became a great success. The purported portrait of Rubinstein in her advertising was of a middle-age mannequin with a Gentile appearance.

In 1928, she sold the American business to Lehman Brothers for $7.3 million, ($127 million in 2022). After the onset of the Great Depression, she bought back the nearly worthless stock for less than $1 million and eventually increased the value of the company to $100 million, establishing salons and outlets in almost a dozen US cities. This saga, and Rubinstein&#x27;s early business career, has been the subject of a recent Harvard Business School case. Her subsequent spa at 715 Fifth Avenue included a restaurant, a gymnasium and rugs by painter Joan Miró. She commissioned artist Salvador Dalí to design a powder compact as well a portrait of herself in 1943, titled &quot;Princess Arthchild Gourielle-Helena Rubinstein&quot;. Other artists who painted her portrait were Graham Sutherland in 1957 for the Helena Rubinstein Foundation, now in the National Portrait Gallery of Australia, Marie Laurencin in 1934 (now in the National Portrait Gallery (United States), Raoul Dufy (1930), Roberto Montenegro (1941). After Rubinstein&#x27;s last visit to Australia, William Dobell painted a series of eight portraits in 1957.

===Divorce and remarriage===
After her divorce, in 1938 Helena readily married Prince Artchil Gourielli-Tchkonia (sometimes spelled Courielli-Tchkonia; born in Georgia, February 18, 1895, died in New York City, November 21, 1955), whose somewhat clouded matrilinear claim to Georgian nobility stemmed from him having been born a member of the untitled noble Tchkonia family of Guria, enticing the ambitious young man to appropriate the genuine title of his grandmother, born Princess Gourielli.

Gourielli-Tchkonia was 23 years younger than Rubinstein. Eager for a regal title, Rubinstein pursued the handsome man avidly and named a male cosmetics line after her youthful prized catch. Some have claimed that the marriage was a marketing ploy, including Rubinstein&#x27;s being able to pass herself off as Helena Princess Gourielli.

Rubinstein took a packed lunch to work and was frugal in many matters, but bought top-fashion clothing and valuable fine art and furniture. She founded the Helena Rubinstein Pavilion of Contemporary Art at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and in 1957 she established the Helena Rubinstein Travelling Art Scholarship in Australia. In 1953, she established the philanthropic Helena Rubinstein Foundation to provide funds to organizations specializing in health, medical research and rehabilitation.

In 1959, Rubinstein represented the US cosmetics industry at the American National Exhibition in Moscow.

Called &quot;Madame&quot; by her employees, she eschewed idle chatter, continued to be active in the corporation throughout her life, even from her sick bed, and staffed the company with her relatives.

==Death and legacy==
Rubinstein died April 1, 1965, of natural causes and was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery in Queens. Some of her estate, including African and fine art, Lucite furniture, and Victorian furniture upholstered in purple, was auctioned in 1966 at the Parke-Bernet Galleries in New York City.

One of Rubinstein&#x27;s numerous sayings was: &quot;There are no ugly women, only lazy ones.&quot; A scholarly study of her exclusive beauty salons and how they blurred and influenced the conceptual boundaries at the time among fashion, art galleries, the domestic interior and versions of modernism is explored by Marie J. Clifford. A feature-length documentary film, &quot;The Powder &amp; the Glory&quot; (2009) by Ann Carol Grossman and Arnie Reisman, details the rivalry between Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden.

In her book &quot;Ugly Beauty&quot;, Ruth Brandon described her methodology:

She knew how to advertise—using &#x27;fear copy with a bit of blah-blah&#x27;— and introduced the concept of &#x27;problem&#x27; skin types. She also pioneered the use of pseudo-science in marketing, donning a lab coat in many advertisements, despite the fact that her only training had been a two-month tour of European skin-care facilities. She knew how to manipulate consumers&#x27; status anxiety, as well: If a product faltered initially, she would hike the price to raise the perceived value.

In 1973, the company Helena Rubinstein, Inc. was sold to Colgate-Palmolive. By the 1980&#x27;s the brand had faded from the US market. In 1984 it was acquired by L&#x27;Oréal. The L&#x27;Oreal takeover was to cause a good deal of scandal as company founder, Eugène Schueller, had been an enthusiastic collaborator during the war, and in its aftermath, L&#x27;Oreal became notorious for employing ex-Nazis on the run. Jacques Corrèze, who engineered the takeover, was one of these: he had been active in expropriating Jewish property in Paris. The brand was re-launched in the US market in 1999 but it was unprofitable despite its having a renaissance in Asia, Europe, and South America. The US operation was closed down in 2003. Since 2011, L&#x27;Oréal has been repositioning the brand as an ultra-premium skin care franchise. As of 2023, high-end Helena Rubinstein products remain unavailable in the US but are sold in international markets.

The L&#x27;Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science are also known as the Helena Rubinstein Women in Science Awards.

The Helena Rubinstein Foundation, which had been established in 1953, operated through 2011, ultimately distributing nearly $130 million over the course of six decades, primarily to education, arts, and community-based organizations in New York City. The foundation was a longtime supporter of children&#x27;s programming for New York City&#x27;s PBS affiliate WNET.

The Manhattan Jewish Museum hosted the exhibition &quot;Helena Rubinstein: Beauty Is Power&quot;, the first museum show devoted to Rubinstein, from October 31, 2014, until March 22, 2015.

==Support for the arts==
A one-off Rubinstein Mural Prize was awarded in 1958 to Erica McGilchrist for her work in the Women&#x27;s College, University of Melbourne, and a Helena Rubinstein Scholarship was awarded to Frank Hodgkinson in 1958 and Charles Blackman 1960.

The Helena Rubinstein Portrait Prize was an annual prize of £300 for portraiture by an Australian artist, and was mostly staged at the Claude Hotchin Gallery in Western Australia.

==In popular culture==
Based on Woodhead&#x27;s book, the 2016 musical &quot;War Paint&quot; dramatizes her rivalry with competitor Elizabeth Arden. After a run Chicago&#x27;s Goodman Theatre, the show opened on Broadway at the Nederlander Theatre on April 6, 2017, starring Patti LuPone as Rubinstein and Christine Ebersole as Arden.

The comedy &quot;Lip Service&quot; by the Australian dramatist John Misto chronicles the life and career of Rubinstein and her rivalry with Elizabeth Arden and Revlon. &quot;Lip Service&quot; premiered April 26, 2017, at the Park Theatre in London, under the title &quot;Madame Rubinstein&quot;, before opening at Sydney&#x27;s Ensemble Theatre in August of the same year. Miriam Margolyes starred as Rubinstein.

<doc id="747454" wikidata="Q2668126" url="?curid=747454" title="Paradigm (experimental)">
<text>In the behavioural sciences (e.g. psychology, biology, neurosciences), an experimental paradigm, is an experimental setup or way of conducting a certain type of experiment (a protocol) that is defined by certain fine-tuned standards, and often has a theoretical background. A paradigm in this technical sense, however, is not a way of thinking as it is in the epistemological meaning (paradigm).

The more paradigms which are attempted, and the more variables within a single paradigm are attempted, with the same results, the more sure one is of the results, that, &quot;the effect is a true one and not merely a product of artifacts engendered by the use of a particular paradigm.&quot; The three core factors of paradigm design may be considered: &quot;(a) ...the &#x27;nuts and bolts&#x27; of the paradigm itself...; (b) ...implementation concerns...; and (c) resources available.&quot;

For example, the stop-signal paradigm, &quot;is a popular experimental paradigm to study response inhibition.&quot; The cooperative pulling paradigm is used to study cooperation. The weather prediction test is a paradigm used to study procedural learning. Other examples include Skinner boxes, rat mazes, and trajectory mapping.

<doc id="747455" wikidata="Q8016373" url="?curid=747455" title="William Ormsby-Gore, 2nd Baron Harlech">
<text>William Richard Ormsby-Gore, 2nd Baron Harlech (3 March 1819 – 26 June 1904), was an Anglo-Irish peer and Member of Parliament.

==Biography==
Lord Harlech was the younger son of William Ormsby-Gore and Mary Jane Ormsby. He was educated at Eton College and later purchased an Ensigncy in the 53rd Foot. He purchased a Lieutenancy in 1839 and exchanged into the 13th Light Dragoons in 1841, purchasing a Captaincy in 1846 and a Majority in 1852.

In the 1841 general election, Ormsby-Gore was elected unopposed as a Conservative Party MP for County Sligo. In the 1852 general election, there was a contest for the seat and he was defeated by a nationalist-inclined Liberal candidate. He returned to Parliament in a by-election on 17 May 1858 as MP for Leitrim, a seat he held until 1876.

Ormsby-Gore bought an estate at Derrycarne near Dromod in County Leitrim and went on to rise to high office in the county: he became High Sheriff there for 1857, and was appointed as Lord Lieutenant of County Leitrim in 1878, which he remained until his death.

On 14 January 1876, Ormsby-Gore&#x27;s elder brother John was created Baron Harlech. As he had no sons, the peerage was created with a special remainder to his younger brother, meaning that he was made heir presumptive of the peerage should the first Baron die without legitimate male heirs. This was an unusual procedure and it was determined at the time that the last such case had been 45 years before. As it happened, the first Baron died on 15 June 1876 and Ormsby-Gore became the second Baron Harlech.

Harlech was appointed by the Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire to be a Deputy Lieutenant of the county on 22 February 1882.

==Marriage and children==
Lord Harlech married Lady Emily Charlotte Seymour, daughter of Admiral Sir George Francis Seymour and sister of Francis Hugh George Seymour, 5th Marquess of Hertford, in 1850. They had six children:

* Mary Georgina Ormsby-Gore (born 1851, died 28 August 1937), married in 1878 Colonel Sir Alfred Mordaunt Egerton, KCVO, CB (a descendant of the 2nd Earl of Bridgewater) and had issue. She was Lady-in-Waiting to The Duchess of Connaught and to Princess Patricia of Connaught
* William Seymour Ormsby-Gore (born 27 December 1852, died May 1853)
* George Ralph Charles Ormsby-Gore, 3rd Baron Harlech (born 21 January 1855, died 8 May 1938)
* Major Henry Arthur Ormsby-Gore (born 18 March 1857, died 12 March 1921)
* Emily Ormsby-Gore (born 1859, died 12 Jul 1929), married in 1886 Hugh Fortescue, 4th Earl Fortescue and was the mother of Hugh Fortescue, 5th Earl Fortescue and Denzil Fortescue, 6th Earl Fortescue.
* Captain Seymour Fitzroy Ormsby-Gore, FRGS (born 18 January 1863, died 10 November 1950), unmarried, Conservative Member of Parliament for Gainsborough between 1900 and 1906.

Lord Harlech died on 26 June 1904, aged 85, and was succeeded in the barony by his eldest surviving son George.

<text>The Comoro Islands are a group of volcanic islands in the Mozambique Channel, an arm of the Indian Ocean lying between Madagascar and the African mainland. Three of the islands form the Union of the Comoros, a sovereign nation, while Mayotte belongs to France.

==Geography==

The Comoro Islands are located in the Mozambique Channel to the north-west of Madagascar and facing Mozambique. These volcanic islands, covering a total area of 2034 km2, are as follows:

* Ngazidja (also known as &quot;Grande Comore&quot;): the largest island of the Union of the Comoros, with its capital Moroni
* Ndzuwani (also known as &quot;Anjouan&quot;): part of the Union of the Comoros
* Mwali (also known as &quot;Mohéli&quot;): part of the Union of the Comoros
* Mayotte (also known as &quot;Maore&quot;): a French overseas department. Mayotte is composed of two islands, Grande-Terre and Petite-Terre (also known as &quot;Pamanzi&quot;), where the Dzaoudzi–Pamandzi International Airport is located.

The Glorioso Islands, comprising &quot;Grande Glorieuse&quot;, &quot;Île du Lys&quot; and eight little rock islets, were administratively attached to the archipelago before 1975, and, geologically speaking, form a part of the archipelago.

Notable reefs that are part of the archipelago are as follows:

* Banc Vailheu, or &quot;Raya&quot;, a submerged volcano located 20 km west of Grand Comoro
* Banc du Geyser, a reef measuring 8 by 5 km in area, situated 130 km North-East of Grande-Terre
* Banc du Leven, a former island between Madagascar and Grande-Terre which is now submerged

==History==


The Comoros may have been settled as early as the 6th century; among the peoples who crossed the sea to populate the islands are Bantu-speaking peoples, Austronesian (including Malagasy), Arabs, Somalis, Portuguese, French, and Indians. Islam probably arrived during the 10th century. The Comoros islands formed, with Zanzibar, Pemba, Lamu, and the coastal towns of Kenya and Tanzania, a united and prosperous region of Swahili culture, trading in local goods which were exported to the African coast, Madagascar, the Middle East and India. In that period, political power was in the hands of local rulers. During their explorations of the Comoros region, the Portuguese made landfall on the Islands of the Moon, in 1505; &quot;kamar&quot; is Arabic for &quot;moon&quot;.

During the colonial period, French settlers established plantations, initially producing sugar, an intensive process dependent on the labor of numerous Africans. In the twentieth century, they cultivated perfume plants and spices, such as ylang ylang, vanilla and cloves, as well as copra. In 1946, France redefined the Comoros as a French overseas territory.

In 1974, France organized a referendum for self-determination in the archipelago. Except in Mayotte, the population voted overwhelmingly in favour of independence. Following the unilateral declaration of independence in 1975, France maintained sovereignty over Mayotte. 

The three remaining islands formed the &quot;Etat Comorian&quot;, which later became the &quot;Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoro Islands&quot; and is today the Union of the Comoros.

In 1996, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961 was hijacked and crashed off the shore of the grande island. 125 people died onboard, including the three hijackers who caused the crash. 50 people survived.
In 1997, demands for increased autonomy on the islands of Ndzuani (Anjouan) and Mwali (Moheli) led to the breakup of the Federal Islamic Republic. In 2001, the government reformed as the &quot;Union of the Comoros&quot; under a new constitution which gave each of the three islands more autonomy than had been enjoyed previously. In 2008, the President of Anjouan refused to hold free elections. He was forced to flee following military intervention by troops of the Comorian Union and the African Union. The island country continues its present form of confederal government, albeit with minor changes approved in referendums in 2009 and 2018.

Mayotte, which had voted to retain French suzerainty in the 1975 referendum, expressed a wish to accede to the status of a &quot;département d&#x27;outre-mer&quot; (DOM) (Overseas Department) following another referendum held on the island on 29 March 2009. Mayotte officially became France&#x27;s 101st department on 31 March 2011.

==Geology==
The Comoro Archipelago consists of volcanic islands. These volcanic islands, together with the high mountains in the north of Madagascar, were formed in the Tertiary and Quaternary periods. The island of Mayotte is the oldest one still above sea level and underwent three volcanic phases between 15 million and 500,000 years ago. The ages progressively decrease from east to west. Grande Comore is the youngest island and is still volcanically active. Karthala, a shield volcano occupying some two thirds of the island, rises to 2361 meters. The summit caldera is quite large, being approximately 3 x 4 km (1.9 x 2.5 miles) in size at the rim (2007).
==Climate==
The Comoro Archipelago enjoys a tropical maritime climate, characterized by slight daytime temperature variations throughout the year of around at sea level and by abundant precipitation: a year. The average temperature of the sea water is .
There are two seasons in the Comoros: the hot and humid season flowing in from the north-west from November to April and the dry season from May to October. The climate on Mayotte is, nevertheless, noticeably warmer and drier. The climate is also characterized by important local variations in temperature and precipitation according to altitude, relief and the degree of exposure to the elements. Annual precipitation therefore varies in the region of and the absolute minimum of is reached on the summit of Karthala.

The hot, dry season is caused by a vast low pressure area which extends over a large part of the Indian Ocean and Central Africa. This low pressure favours gusty winds and cyclones. The last cyclone was Cyclone Gafilo, which passed close to the Comoros on 5 March 2004 causing great material damage. During the hot and humid season it can rain as much as in twenty-four hours.
The dry season is calmer. The low pressure moves towards the continent of Asia (this is the monsoon, the wind blowing from the south-east) and an anticyclone forms below the Comoros. This still does not prevent the islands from having a few gusts of wind, but their intensity is a lot less than during the hot season.

The two winds that bring the two different seasons are called the Kashkasi (in November) and the Kusi.

==Terrestrial ecology==

Partly as a result of international pressure during the 1990s, the government of the Union has begun to take greater care of the environment. Measures have been taken not only to preserve the rare fauna, but also to check the destruction of the environment, especially on Anjouan, which is densely populated. More precisely, in order to minimize the felling of trees for fuel, kerosene has been subsidized, and efforts are underway to replace the lost forest cover caused by the distillation of Ylang-ylang for perfume. The Fund for the Support of Community Development, sponsored by the International Development Association (IDA, a subsidiary of the World Bank) and the Comorian government, is applying itself to improving the water supply on the islands.

===Flora===
Like most islands, the diversity of the local flora suffers from two pressures, on the one hand the reduction of available space caused by humans settling in what used to be the wildest areas, and the invasion of exotic plant species such as guava trees. Much of the remaining habitat is not protected, and the islands&#x27; growing population puts more pressure on the remaining wild lands.

===Fauna===

The islands are home to eight species of native terrestrial mammal – three species of fruit bat, three insectivorous bat species, and two lemur species. Two bat species, Livingstone&#x27;s fruit bat (&quot;Pteropus livingstonii&quot;) and the Comoro rousette (&quot;Rousettus obliviosus&quot;), are endemic. Livingstone&#x27;s fruit bat, discovered by David Livingstone in 1863, was previously abundant, but has now been reduced to a population of about 1,200 specimens restricted to Anjouan and Moheli. A British preservation group sent an expedition to the Comoros in 1992, with the object of transporting some specimens to Great Britain, in order to form a reproducing colony.

Native lemurs include the mongoose lemur (&quot;Eulemur mongoz&quot;) and the common brown lemur (&quot;Eulemur fulvus&quot;). The common brown lemur or maki, known as &quot;Kima&quot; in Shikomori, is present on Mayotte, where it is believed to have been introduced from Madagascar. It is protected by French law and by local tradition.

Mammals introduced to the islands by humans include the Javan mongoose (&quot;Urva javanica&quot;) and tailless tenrec (&quot;Tenrec ecaudatus&quot;).

Twenty-two species of birds are endemic to the archipelago. Endemic species include the Karthala scops-owl (&quot;Otus pauliani&quot;), Anjouan scops-owl (&quot;Otus capnodes&quot;) and Humblot&#x27;s flycatcher (&quot;Humblotia flavirostris&quot;).

Native invertebrates include &quot;Scolopendra&quot;, venomous centipedes that can reach up to 25 centimetres long.

No large African animals (elephants, giraffes, lions, crocodiles, zebras or antelopes) are found on the Comoros, despite the islands being relatively close to the mainland.

==Freshwater ecology==
Freshwater habitats on the islands include streams originating in the islands&#x27; forested highlands and flowing into the sea, as well as crater lakes. These habitats are home to species of freshwater and brackish water fish, frogs, waterbirds, dragonflies, and caddisflies.

Mayotte and Moheli have perennial streams and lakes. Mayotte is the oldest of the islands, and has many meandering streams which descend from mountain forests, as well as two lakes – Dziani Karehani and Dziani Dzaha. Mohéli also has freshwater streams, and the freshwater but sulfurous lake Dziani Boundouni.

Grande Comore, the largest and youngest island, is volcanically active and has thin and rocky soils, with no perennial streams or large stream valleys. Anjouan also has few permanent freshwater habitats.

All of the freshwater fish on the Comoros are from secondary families, i.e. families of fish which can tolerate salt water. No primary families – fish families adapted to freshwater and intolerant of salt water – are native to the island, on account of the islands&#x27; oceanic origin and relatively recent geologic origins.

==Marine ecology==

Mayotte, the oldest island, is surrounded by a barrier reef, with extensive reefs and lagoons between the reef and the island. The reef and lagoon cover over 1,000 km2. They are home to more than 760 species of marine fish, including 17 threatened species, 581 species of marine arthropods, more than 450 cnidarian species, and 24 marine mammal species.

The other Comoro Islands are surrounded by fringing reefs, which form a narrow platform extending a short distance from the coast. Reefs fringe about 60% of the coast of Grande Comore, 80% of Anjouan&#x27;s coast, and 100% of Mohéli&#x27;s coast. The Sima Peninsula on Anjouan is surrounded by a vast reef. The islands also have rocky reefs on basalt substrates.

Mayotte has 7.6 km2 of seagrass beds. The extensive seagrass beds in Moheli Marine Park account for about 90% of the remaining seagrass beds in the Comoros. Other seagrass beds occur at Mitsamiouli, Malé and Ouroveni around Grande Comore and at Bimbini and Ouani around Anjouan. There are eight seagrass species in the Comoros. The islands&#x27; seagrass beds have been degraded by sedimentation and climate change. Between 1993 and 1998 the &quot;Thalassodendron ciliatum&quot; beds at Moheli Marine Park were destroyed by a large sediment influx into the lagoon from upland deforestation coupled with high rainfall.

Mayotte has 8.5 km2 of mangroves. There are approximately 120 ha of mangroves on the other Comoro islands, 75% of which are on the south coast of Mohéli, particularly around Damou and Mapiachingo. Smaller areas of mangrove are also found on Grande Comore and Anjouan. There are seven mangrove species in the Comoros, with &quot;Rhizophora mucronata&quot; and &quot;Avicennia marina&quot; the most abundant.

Marine mammals in the Comoros&#x27; seas include the humpback whale (&quot;Megaptera novaeangliae&quot;) sperm whale (&quot;Physeter macrocephalus&quot;), dugong (&quot;Dugong dugon&quot;) spinner dolphin (&quot;Stenella longirostris&quot;), pantropical spotted dolphin (&quot;Stenella attenuata&quot;), Fraser&#x27;s dolphin (&quot;Lagenodelphis hosei&quot;), bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops&quot; sp.), Risso&#x27;s dolphin (&quot;Grampus griseus&quot;), melon-headed whale (&quot;Peponocephala electra&quot;), short-finned pilot whale (&quot;Globicephala macrorhynchus&quot;), pygmy killer whale (&quot;Feresa attenuata&quot;), Blainville&#x27;s beaked whale (&quot;Mesoplodon densirostris&quot;), and Longman&#x27;s beaked whale (&quot;Mesoplodon pacificus&quot;).

Other marine fauna include the green sea turtle (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;), most abundantly on Mohéli and Mayotte where they still come to lay eggs, and the coelacanth, a deepwater fish known from fossils over 300 million years old.

===Marine protected areas===
Four marine national parks were established in 2010 – Coelacanth National Park (92.76 km2) along the south shore of Grande Comore, Mitsamiouli Ndroude National Park (23.14 km2) along the north shore of Grande Comore, Mohéli National Park (643.62 km2) around Mohéli, and Shisiwani National Park (64.97 km2) around Anjouan&#x27;s Sima Peninsula.

==Politics==
The Comoro Archipelago is divided between:
* The Union of the Comoros, a sovereign nation formed by the three islands of Grande Comore, Anjouan and Mohéli.
* Mayotte, an Overseas Department of the French Republic (&quot;département d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;). This island is also claimed by the Union of the Comoros according to Article 1 of its Constitution. 
Mayotte became a French Department on 31 March 2011.

The United Nations General Assembly continued to condemn the French presence in Mayotte until 1994. France, however, used its power of veto in the UN to prevent the Security Council from passing a resolution condemning France. The African Union judged the French presence on Mayotte to be illegal.

The Comoros underwent a political crisis that started off in 1997 with the separatism on Anjouan. The political authorities on the island had turned the population of the island against the central government, advocating at first reunification with France, and later a greater autonomy bordering on independence.

Since 2006, the former president of the Union of the Comoros, Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, who is originally from the island of Anjouan, has been in open conflict with the authorities of Anjouan, a conflict which ended in a landing of the National Army of Development in order to re-establish the authority of the Union on the island.

<doc id="747466" wikidata="Q646649" url="?curid=747466" title="Francis Ormsby-Gore, 6th Baron Harlech">
<text>Francis David Ormsby-Gore, 6th Baron Harlech (13 March 1954 – 1 February 2016), was a peer in the United Kingdom. In 1985 he inherited the property in Wales and the Harlech title from his father.

==Early life== 
His parents were David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech, a Conservative politician and British Ambassador to Washington in the Sixties, and his wife Sylvia &#x27;Sissie&#x27; Lloyd Thomas. 

Francis was born the youngest of five children. The second son of a second son, and only inherited due to some tragic deaths. The fourth Baron&#x27;s eldest son was killed at the age of 19 in a car accident. Thus Francis&#x27;s father became heir and later succeeded as the 5th Baron. Francis&#x27;s older brother died in what was suspected to be a suicide in 1974 making Francis the heir. 

Francis&#x27;s father was a childhood friend of John F. Kennedy — a relationship that remained strong in adulthood. John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy were close to his sociable parents, with US President Kennedy calling David &#x27;the wisest man I ever knew&#x27;, and leaning on him for support during the Cuban Missile Crisis. His father became deputy Conservative leader in the Lords and set up the Welsh TV station Harlech Television (HTV Wales), — later pursued the widowed Jackie Kennedy.

He was educated at Worth School, a private Catholic school in West Sussex. He left school at 16. His mother died in a car crash in 1967 when he was only 12. In 1969 his father married the American socialite Pamela Colin, a former London editor of American Vogue. His elder brother Julian committed suicide in 1974, making him the heir to the Harlech barony. 

The five Harlech siblings became the nexus of the fashionable Sixties &#x27;hippieocracy&#x27;, a bohemian set where aristocracy mingled with emerging Rock and Roll royalty in Swinging London. His elder sister, Jane, was a friend of The Rolling Stones and dated Mick Jagger. It was widely thought that she was the inspiration for the hit song Lady Jane. His youngest sister, Alice, at just 17, became engaged to Eric Clapton, who was then 25. During this time she developed a heroin addiction.

The siblings put their names on the books of English Boy, a model agency founded by the Queen&#x27;s page-turned-hippie, Sir Mark Palmer, 5th Baronet. When Palmer bought a gipsy caravan and set off, the siblings set up their own commune – on the family estate in Shropshire. The idea, they explained, was to form a &quot;peace circus to bridge the gap between children who are rich and children who have nothing&quot;. The siblings by then were referred to in society columns as the &#x27;Harlech hippies&#x27;.

In an attempt to avoid inheritance tax, their father had made over some of his property to his eldest son Julian. But in 1974 Julian shot himself dead at the age of 33, making him the heir to the title. Ormsby-Gore eventually succeeded his father in 1985, as the sixth Baron Harlech, after his father death in a car crash. 

He sat as a Conservative member of the House of Lords until the removal of the hereditary peers in 1999.

Harlech lived at his ancestral seat the Palladian Brogyntyn Hall near Oswestry, which he sold in 2001 and later at The Mount, Racecourse Road, Oswestry. He also owned Glyn Cywarch, his 4,200-acre estate in Talsarnau, Gwynedd in Wales.

==Personal life==
In 1986, Harlech married Amanda Jane Grieve, a daughter of solicitor Alan Grieve, a director of the Jerwood Foundation, and his first wife, Anne Dulake. She was a fashion journalist who would become the muse of, first, John Galliano and later Karl Lagerfeld.

Before Lord and Lady Harlech were divorced on 31 August 1998, they had a son and a daughter:
* Jasset David Cody Ormsby-Gore, 7th Baron Harlech (born 1 July 1986), who studied at Central St Martins, and who was elected to take Lord Elton&#x27;s seat in the House of Lords in 2021.
* Tallulah Sylvia Maria Ormsby-Gore (born 16 May 1988).

In 2011, it was revealed that he had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

He died of natural causes on 1February 2016. A North Wales Police spokesman said, &quot;North Wales Police were called to an address at Talsarnau near Harlech at 11.40am on Monday, following reports of the sudden death of a man in his 60s.&quot;

<text>The Battle of the Komandorski Islands was a naval battle between American and Imperial Japanese forces which took place on 27 March 1943 in the North Pacific, south of the Soviet Komandorski Islands. The Japanese were escorting a three ship convoy, while the Americans were patrolling waters west of the Aleutian Islands. The battle was a daylight surface engagement in which air support played no role and in which the outnumbered American force escaped greater damage after the Japanese chose to withdraw.

==Background==
In June 1942, Japanese forces landed in the western Aleutian Islands of Kiska and Attu, as a northern pincer of the main attack on Midway Island. After the stunning Japanese defeat at Midway, the Japanese held the islands as a defensive shield against any American attempt against the Kuriles. As the U.S. was preparing its assault on the Japanese strongholds, Japanese shipping between Japan and the islands was harassed by submarines and aircraft. The Japanese Imperial Navy countered this threat by sailing at night or taking advantage of stormy weather. Aware of Japanese tactics, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid deployed a surface force around Attu. On the night of 19/20 February 1943, the patrol force, consisting of the heavy cruiser &quot;Indianapolis&quot; and the destroyers &quot;Coghlan&quot; and &quot;Gillespie&quot; shelled and sank the Japanese transport ship &quot;Akagane Maru&quot; (3100 GRT) west of Attu.

In a bid to defy the American blockade, Vice-Admiral Boshirō Hosogaya, in charge of the 5th Fleet and the northern theatre of operations, assembled a high-speed convoy with two fast merchant ships &quot;Asaka Maru&quot; (7399 GRT) and &quot;Sakito Maru&quot; (7158 GRT) and a slower transport, the &quot;Sanko Maru&quot; (5491 GRT). The latter and her escort, the destroyer &quot;Usugumo&quot;, were to make a rendezvous with the main force south of the Komandorski Islands. The ships carried materiel essential to complete the building of an all-weather airstrip at Attu.

When Admiral Kinkaid became aware of Japanese plans to send a supply convoy to their forces on the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, U.S. Navy ships commanded by Rear Admiral Charles McMorris were sent to prevent this. The fleet consisted of the heavy cruiser , the light cruiser and the destroyers , , and . 

American intelligence estimated that the Japanese escort consisted of one heavy cruiser, one light cruiser, and four destroyers. However, the Japanese 5th Fleet had been reinforced by two more cruisers, so that the Japanese escort force actually consisted of the heavy cruisers &quot;Nachi&quot; and &quot;Maya&quot;, the light cruisers &quot;Tama&quot; and &quot;Abukuma&quot;, and the destroyers &quot;Wakaba&quot;, &quot;Hatsushimo&quot;, &quot;Ikazuchi&quot;, and &quot;Inazuma&quot;. Vice Admiral Boshirō Hosogaya hoisted his flag on &quot;Nachi&quot;. Rear-Admiral McMorris didn&#x27;t learn that he was facing a superior force until one hour after the first radar contact.

==Battle==
On the early morning of 27 March 1943, the Japanese convoy was intercepted by the American picket line some 100 nautical miles south of the Komandorski islands and 180 nautical miles west of Attu, just to the west of the International Date Line. Despite lacking radar, the Japanese cruiser squadron spotted the American force half an hour earlier than their enemies, in part because the southern horizon was lightening earlier than the northern, as well as the strict selection of lookouts of exceptional visual acuity by the Japanese navy. Because of the remote location of the battle and its being a chance encounter on the open ocean, neither fleet had air or submarine assistance, making this one of the few engagements exclusively between surface ships in the Pacific Theater and one of the last pure gunnery duels between fleets of major surface combatants in naval history. At one point, McMorris made a request for air support to the USAAF air base at Adak. However, the B-24 squadron sent to attack the Japanese force became lost in the fog and had to return home. A spotter aircraft from &quot;Nachi&quot; directed fire on the American force for the whole battle. While the Japanese side criticized the observers&#x27; inability to deal with smoke screens, the US reports say that the accurate way in which the enemy gunners shifted their fire led the Americans to believe that one of the Japanese cruisers had fire control radar.

Although the Japanese cruisers heavily outgunned the American force and inflicted more damage, the engagement was tactically inconclusive. The U.S. Navy warships escaped destruction after a Japanese misjudgment, when, with the Japanese fleet on the edge of victory, Admiral Hosogaya – not realizing the heavy damage his ships had inflicted and fearing American war planes would appear – chose to retreat, conceding a strategic victory to the US Navy. Indeed, the battle ended Japanese attempts to resupply the Aleutian garrisons by surface ship, leaving only submarines to conduct supply runs. The airstrip at Attu was never finished. Hosogaya was accordingly retired from active service after the battle and assigned to govern a group of South Pacific islands.

=== Timeline of the battle ===
This is a timeline of the action, based upon authors O&#x27;Hara and Millsap.
*0600: The United States ships were formed in a scouting line at six-mile intervals zig-zagging at 15 knots on base course 020°.
*0700: While the Japanese formation was turning 180º to a northern course, destroyer &quot;Inazuma&quot;, still heading south, spotted unknown ships 27000 yards to port. A navigating officer on one of the transports visually observed the American force minutes later.
*0715: The ships were identified as American, as the day dawned.
*0730: Hosogaya ordered a turn to starboard, to the southeast, while the two fast transports were ordered to withdraw north-northwest, escorted by &quot;Inazuma&quot;.

&quot;Salt Lake City&quot; fired 806 armor-piercing projectiles and then 26 high-capacity (explosive) shells after the supply of armor-piercing ammunition was exhausted. Powder and shells were manhandled aft from the forward magazines to keep the after guns firing. &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;′s rudder stops were carried away, limiting her to 10° course changes.

<text>Neil Leon Rudenstine (born January 21, 1935) is an American scholar, educator, and administrator. He served as president of Harvard University from 1991 to 2001.

==Early life and education==
Rudenstine was born in Danbury, Connecticut, the son of Mae (née Esperito) and Harry Rudenstine, a prison guard. His father was a Ukrainian Jew who emigrated from Kyiv, his mother a Roman Catholic and the daughter of immigrants from Campobasso, Italy.

Rudenstine was raised as a Roman Catholic and grew up speaking Italian with his mother’s family. Later in life, he said, he began to understand more about his Jewish heritage. He also pointed out that he had attended an Episcopal boarding school and a university with Presbyterian roots. &quot;One way or another, I’ve become extremely ecumenical&quot;, he said. He attended the Wooster School in Danbury on a scholarship and was selected to participate in Camp Rising Sun, the Louis August Jonas Foundation&#x27;s international summer scholarship program.

Rudenstine graduated with an A.B. in English from Princeton University in 1956 after completing his senior thesis, &quot;The Burden of Poetry: A Study in the Art of John Keats, Matthew Arnold and Thomas Stearns Eliot&quot;. At Princeton, he participated in Army R.O.T.C. After serving in the U.S. Army as an artillery officer, he attended New College, Oxford, on a Rhodes Scholarship and earned an M.A. In 1964, Rudenstine received a Ph.D. in English literature from Harvard; his dissertation, &quot;Sir Philip Sidney: The Styles of Love&quot;, directed by Douglas Bush, treated Sidney&#x27;s poetic development.

==Academic career==
Most of Rudenstine&#x27;s career has been dedicated to educational administration. He taught at Harvard from 1964 to 1968 as an instructor and then assistant professor in the Department of English and American Literature and Language.

From 1968 to 1988, Rudenstine was a faculty member and senior administrator at Princeton. A scholar of Renaissance literature, he was an associate professor and then full professor of English. He also held a series of administrative posts at Princeton:
* Dean of students (1968–1972)
* Dean of the college (1972–1977)
* Provost (1977–1988)
After his time at Princeton, he served as executive vice-president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation from 1988 to 1991.

===President of Harvard===
Rudenstine served as president of Harvard from 1991 to 2001. He gained a reputation as an effective fundraiser, overseeing a period of highly successful growth in Harvard&#x27;s endowment.

Rudenstine led Harvard&#x27;s first university-wide fundraising campaign, raising more than $2.6 billion, surpassing the goal of $2.1 billion. With this funding Harvard increased student financial aid, supported new educational and research programs, built new buildings, and renovated existing spaces. Under Rudenstine, endowments grew from $4.7 billion in 1991 to more than $15 billion.

Rudenstine was a strong supporter of university-based research. In the mid-1990s he helped found the Science Coalition and oversaw the growth of the university&#x27;s federally sponsored research support, which rose to $320 million in 2000.

During his tenure, Rudenstine worked toward more effective collaboration among Harvard schools. He developed many interdisciplinary programs, such as the Mind, Brain and Behavior Interfaculty Initiative, the University Committee on the Environment, and the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies. He reorganized the university’s administrative structure so that the school deans also worked as a consultative cabinet, and he recreated the provost position to oversee the interfaculty initiatives created during his presidency.

Rudenstine oversaw the establishment of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, which merged Radcliffe College with Harvard. This created a community of faculty and fellows across the arts and sciences, and promoted the study of women, gender, and society. At the time the Dean of Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study, Drew Faust said of Rudenstine, “He made it possible and continues to offer me and the Institute support in ways too varied to enumerate. The Institute would not exist without him”.

Rudenstine advocated for a diverse student body. In April 2000, during the 30th-anniversary celebration of the Department of Afro-American Studies, he said, &quot;Harvard will continue to take ethnicity and race into account, along with many other factors, as it admits students&quot;. Rudenstine also was committed to providing increased financial aid and scholarships to students from a range of financial circumstances. Student scholarships and fellowship grants increased from $59 million in 1991 to $132 million in 2000, a year before he left the presidency.

Rudenstine was known as mild-mannered and avoided internal controversy, usually taking a hands-off approach to leading the university. He initially objected to the Harvard Living Wage Campaign of 1998–2001, an initiative that drew the support of thousands of students, faculty, and alumni, including Senator Ted Kennedy. One source of his opposition was the sit-in organized by students and alumni, during which the institution&#x27;s administrative offices were occupied for more than two weeks, bringing work to a standstill. 

In response, Rudenstine formed an Ad Hoc Committee on Employment Policies at Harvard, which surveyed employment practices and delivered a report to the president. The committee cited the university&#x27;s strong record as an employer and recommended additional measures to build on its offerings for employees, which Rudenstine endorsed and advocated for during the remainder of his tenure.

In November 1994, the University announced that Rudenstine would take a medical leave of absence on the advice of doctors, who noted that he was suffering from severe fatigue and exhaustion. At the time, Rudenstine described the decision to take a leave as one he made with “the greatest reluctance.” He took a three-month leave of absence, during which provost Albert Carnesale served as acting president. Rudenstine returned from his absence in February 1994 and went on to serve seven more years until stepping down in 2001.

===Retirement===
In 2005, Rudenstine was invited to join the board of Philadelphia&#x27;s Barnes Foundation, responsible for the art collections of Albert C. Barnes. Before taking the job, he investigated the collection&#x27;s history and produced a book published in 2012, &quot;The House of Barnes: The Man, the Collection, the Controversy&quot;, which received the American Philosophical Society&#x27;s John Frederick Lewis Award.

Since 2017, Rudenstine has chaired the Advisory Board for ARTstor and taught a yearly freshman seminar in 20th-century poetry at Harvard.

==Published works==
* &quot;Pointing Our Thoughts: Reflections on Harvard and Higher Education, 1991–2001&quot; (2001)
* &quot;The House of Barnes: The Man, the Collection, the Controversy&quot; (2012)
* &quot;Ideas of Order: A Close Reading of Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets&quot; (2014)

==Memberships and affiliations==
Rudenstine is an honorary Fellow of New College, Oxford and Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge, and Provost Emeritus at Princeton University. In 1998, as president of Harvard University, Rudenstine was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Oxford, in a ceremony in which the president of Yale University, Richard Levin, was also honored.

Rudenstine is also a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a former director of the American Council on Education, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the American Philosophical Society, and the Committee for Economic Development.

Rudenstine has been a member of various advisory groups, including the National Commission on Preservation and Access and the Council on Library Resources. He has also served as a trustee of the College Entrance Examination Board and the Wooster School, of which he is a graduate. He serves on the boards of the New York Public Library, the Goldman Sachs Foundation, the Barnes Foundation, and many others in the United States and in Europe.

==Personal life==
Rudenstine is married to Angelica Zander, an art historian. They have three children and four grandchildren.

<doc id="747499" wikidata="Q5160981" url="?curid=747499" title="Congressional staff">
<text>Congressional staff are employees of a legislative Congress who support legislators in their duties. They handle a variety of tasks, including policy research, constituent services, communications, and administrative support. Staffers may work with individual members of Congress, or they may be associated with committees or other organizations that support Congress.

==History==
Before the American Civil War, members of Congress did not have staff assistance or even offices, and &quot;most members worked at their desks on the floor.&quot;

In 1891, Congress had a total of 146 staff members: 37 Senate personal staff, 39 Senate committee staff, and 62 House committee staff (37 of whom only worked during congressional sessions). The House first approved personal staff for Representatives in 1893. By the beginning of the 20th century, congressional staff had become a well-accepted feature of congressional operations. 
In 1943, House committees employed 114 staff members, while Senate committees employed 190 staff members. The size of individual members&#x27; personal staffs were still relatively small, with the average senator having six staffers and representatives limited to having five staffers. In the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, which reformed Congress and greatly reduced the number of congressional committees, Congress expressly authorized permanent, professional committee staff for the first time. The act provided for a much-needed increase in committee staff, allowing for up to four professional and six clerical staff members for each standing committee, except for the appropriations committees (which had no limitation on the number of staff members). The 1946 act also reorganized the Library of Congress and created the Legislative Reference Service (which later became the Congressional Research Service) as a distinct entity. The size of both personal and committee staff increased considerably after the passage of the Legislative Reorganization Act. Following the significant increase in 1947, there was gradual growth in the number of both kinds of staff for about twenty years. Increased staff specialization also occurred during this period of slow growth (i.e., staffers began to be divided into press, legislative, and casework roles).

In the 1970s, there was again a sharp jump in the number of staff. This was a response &quot;in part to increased workloads and in part to confrontation with the executive branch on various issues, including the president&#x27;s impoundment of funds and the Watergate crisis.&quot; The political scientist Morris P. Fiorina, in his book &quot;Congress: Keystone of the Washington Establishment&quot;, found that the number of congressional staff more than doubled between 1960 and 1974. The increase was mostly in district or state offices; the percentage of congressional staff who worked in a district office went from 14% in 1960 to 34% in 1974.

In the 1970s and 1990s, &quot;staff numbers generally held level and increases were held down. After 1995, staff numbers actually decreased slightly.&quot; 

In 2021 a group of staffers called Congressional Progressive Staff Association sought to push for workplace measures and with the support of Representative Andy Levin make incremental reforms. In 2022 and 2023, multiple House offices and one Senate office voted to unionize with the Congressional Workers Union.

== Structure and organization ==

Staff for the United States Congress are generally divided, as C-SPAN describes, into personal staff (working directly for individual members) and committee staff (serving legislative committees). There are also leadership staff who assist party leaders in managing legislative priorities.

*&quot;Personal staff&quot;, who work for individual members of Congress
*&quot;Committee staff&quot;, who serve either the majority or minority on congressional committees
*&quot;Leadership staff,&quot; who work for the speaker, majority and minority leaders, and majority and minority whips in the House of Representatives, and the majority and minority leaders and assistant majority and minority leaders (whips) in the Senate
*&quot;Institutional staff&quot;, including majority or minority party floor staff and non-partisan staff such as the Capitol Police, Architect of the Capitol (facilities and maintenance employees), and legislative clerks.
*&quot;Support agency staff&quot;, non-partisan employees of the Congressional Research Service (CRS), Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and Government Accountability Office (GAO).

In the year 2000, there were approximately 11,692 personal staff, 2,492 committee staff, 274 leadership staff, 5,034 institutional staff, and 3,500 GAO employees, 747 CRS employees, and 232 CBO employees.

==Personal staff==
Budgets for staff are determined by the population of the state; Senators from California, the most populous state, get more money for staff than Senators from Wyoming, the least populous state. Members can choose how to distribute staff between their Washington office and their United States congressional district home office or offices.

Not all offices have the same type of organization, and different titles may be used for substantially similar jobs. Common jobs are:

* &quot;Chief of staff&quot;: Highest-ranking and usually highest-paid legislative staffer in the office of a member of Congress, usually the chief operating officer of the office, reporting directly to the member. Oversees a dozen or more other employees. Some chiefs of staffs are charged with personnel decisions and policy initiatives. From time to time a chief of staff may be based out of a district office, but they are almost always found at the Capitol (&quot;on the &quot;Hill&quot;). Chiefs of staff are usually very experienced political staffers, often with years of prior work on the Hill, or are personal friends of Members. Some chiefs of staff were previously campaign managers.
* &quot;Deputy chief of staff&quot;: Reports to the chief of staff and typically oversees a few policy issues. Responsibilities typically include managing the Chief of Staff’s schedule, personal correspondence, and any overflow work delegated by the Chief of Staff.
* &quot;Legislative director&quot; (LD), &quot;senior legislative assistant&quot; (SLA), or &quot;legislative coordinator&quot; (LC): oversees the legislative staff, including all legislative assistants and correspondents. There is usually one in each office.
* &quot;Scheduler&quot; or &quot;Director of Operations&quot;: The key administrative staffer in the office, the scheduler is responsible for fully designing and maintaining the Member&#x27;s schedule. This work typically includes making travel arrangements and arranging all events and meetings.
* &quot;Legislative assistant&quot; (LA): Legislative Assistants assume expertise and develop legislation for a few select issue areas, keeping the Member up to date on constituent issues or policies that pertain to those subject areas.
* &quot;Legislative correspondent&quot; (LC): Responsible for drafting letters in response to constituents&#x27; comments and questions and also generally responsible for a few legislative issues. According to the Dirksen Congressional Center, most House offices have one or two, while senators have three to five, depending on their state&#x27;s population.
* &quot;Legislative counsel&quot;: Some offices also have a staffing attorney who works alongside legislative staff. Their role often involves advising legislative staff and the Member on legal issues and ensuring compliance with the law and chamber rules, including ethics guidelines.
* &quot;Press secretary&quot; or &quot;communications director&quot;: Responsible for Member&#x27;s relationship with media; is the liaison for the local and national press; issues press releases. In offices with no press assistants, this position also runs social media.
* &quot;Press Assistant&quot; (PA): Assistant to the Communications Director. Press assistants usually run social media accounts, draft press releases/op-eds/etc. as delegated, and occasionally assist with correspondence with media contacts.
* &quot;Staff Assistant&quot; (SA): The most common entry-level position on Capitol Hill, the Staff Assistant handles all front office responsibilities, answers phones, schedules tours, and often supervises the mail program. Staff Assistants also often serve as intern coordinators.
* &quot;Caseworkers&quot; or &quot;constituent services representatives&quot;: Based in the district office and responsible for helping constituents deal with problems relating to federal agencies. For example, caseworkers help individuals secure veterans&#x27; benefits, aid with Social Security and Medicare, and resolve immigration issues. Caseworkers may also provide mediation services to constituents and obtain government information and publications.

==Committee staff==
Each congressional committee has a staff, of varying sizes. Appropriations for committee staff are made in annual legislative appropriations bills. Majority and minority members hire their own staff except on two select committees in each house—the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct and Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in the House and the Select Committee on Ethics and Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in the Senate. These committees have a single staff.

In 2000, House committees had an average of 68 staff and Senate committees an average of 46. Committee staff includes both staff directors, committee counsel, committee investigators, press secretaries, chief clerks and office managers, schedulers, documents clerks, and assistant.

==Safety and security==
Like members of Congress, congressional staff have occasionally been the targets of violence or threats of violence. Between 1789 and 2011, there were five incidents affecting some congressional staff alongside members of Congress. The following recorded incidents of violence against congressional staff have taken place:

* In 1905, &quot;Doc&quot; Thompkins, private secretary to Representative John M. Pinckney of Texas, was wounded in a riot in which the congressman was slain.
* In 1935, Earle Christenberry, secretary to Senator Huey Pierce Long of Louisiana, opened a parcel bomb (which did not detonate).
* In 1978, Jackie Speier, then a staffer for Representative Leo Joseph Ryan of California, was seriously injured by a gunshot wound in an attack in Guyana, in which Ryan was assassinated.
* 1998 United States Capitol shooting incident: In 1998, two Capitol Police officers were killed by a gunman.
* 2011 Tucson shooting: In 2011, a gunman Jared Lee Loughner attacked a public event being held by Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona in Tucson.

<text>James Inkanish, Jr. (February 1, 1938 – November 1, 2008), known professionally as Jimmy Carl Black, was an original member of the Mothers of Invention, providing drums and vocals. He is known for introducing the songs “Are you Hung Up?” and “Concentration Moon” from the Mothers album &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; saying “hi boys and girls, my name is Jimmy Carl Black and I’m the Indian of the Group.”

==Background and early career: 1960s–1990s==

Born in El Paso, Texas, Black was Cheyenne, both his father James Inkanish Sr. and his mother Jennie Inkanish (née Dorris) were citizens of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes. His trademark line was &quot;Hi boys and girls, I&#x27;m Jimmy Carl Black, and I&#x27;m the Indian of the group.&quot; The line can be heard several times on The Mothers of Invention&#x27;s album &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; (for example, on the tracks &quot;Are You Hung Up?&quot; and &quot;Concentration Moon&quot;). The line can also be heard in Haskell Wexler&#x27;s 1969 movie &quot;Medium Cool&quot;, which uses several songs by Zappa and the Mothers. Black was also addressed as such by Theodore Bikel in the film &quot;200 Motels&quot;. He has been credited on some Mothers albums as playing &quot;drums, vocals, and poverty&quot;.

Black appeared in the movie directed by Frank Zappa, &quot;200 Motels&quot;, and sings the song &quot;Lonesome Cowboy Burt&quot;. Black made a few more appearances with Zappa in 1975 and 1980, and appeared as guest vocalist on &quot;Harder Than Your Husband&quot; on the Zappa album &quot;You Are What You Is&quot; (1981). The same year, 1981, he performed the same song at the discothèque Aladdin, Oasen, Bergen, Norway, as part of The Grandmothers, after their release &quot;Grandmothers&quot; (1980), an anthology of previously unreleased recordings by ex-members of The Mothers of Invention.

Jimmy Carl Black on Frank Zappa:
In 1972, Black played with Geronimo Black, the band he founded with Mothers wind player Bunk Gardner. In the summer of 1975 he played drums for Captain Beefheart &amp; the Magic Band under the stage name Indian Ink, notably at the band&#x27;s appearance at the Knebworth Festival.

In the eighties, Black, Gardner, Don Preston, and several other ex-Zappa musicians performed under the name The Grandmothers, but the band soon broke up. Black then moved to Austin, Texas, where he met English singer Arthur Brown. The duo recorded an album of classic R&amp;B songs, &quot;Black, Brown and Blue&quot;, and performed live together.

Black moved to Italy in 1992 and to Germany in 1995, where he re-formed The Grandmothers with original members Preston and Gardner and with Dutch bass player Ener Bladezipper (stage name of René Mesritz) and Italian guitar player Sandro Oliva.

==1990s–2008==
Black performed as a guest vocalist with the Muffin Men, a Frank Zappa tribute band based in Liverpool, England, and with Jon Larsen, on the surrealistic Strange News From Mars project, featuring several other Zappa alumni, such as Tommy Mars, Bruce Fowler, and Arthur Barrow. Black toured around Europe with the Muffin Men between 1993 and 2007 playing hundreds of gigs, and appearing on many of the band&#x27;s CDs and DVDs.

Black and Eugene Chadbourne played as the Jack and Jim Show around Europe and the US between 1992 and 2003. They performed many Zappa and Beefheart compositions alongside other material.

At Steely Dan&#x27;s 2001 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Walter Becker asked the assembled if they remembered who the original Mothers of Invention drummer was. Becker unsuccessfully lobbied the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for Black&#x27;s inclusion as a founding member of The Mothers of Invention.

An autobiographical audio production with Jimmy Carl Black was recorded in 2007, called &quot;The Jimmy Carl Black Story&quot;, produced by Jon Larsen.

Black was diagnosed with lung cancer in August 2008, and died on November 1, 2008, in Siegsdorf, Germany, at the age of 70. Benefits were held on November 9, 2008, at the Bridgehouse II in London and December 7, 2008, in Crown Valley, California. He is survived by his wife, Monika Black, by three sons and two daughters from his first marriage and by a daughter born out of wedlock.

In 2013, the documentary &quot;Where&#x27;s the Beer and When Do We Get Paid?&quot; about Black began running in Germany.

Black&#x27;s autobiography &quot;For Mother&#x27;s Sake&quot; was published by Monika Black on November 1, 2013, to mark the fifth anniversary of his death. The incomplete manuscript was rounded out using material from the synoptic web-bio Black published on his website, and extracts from various interviews Black gave. The main body of text was transcribed from tapes recorded by Roddie Gilliard in the Muffin Men tour bus during 1995-1998.

<doc id="747515" wikidata="Q5132790" url="?curid=747515" title="Cliff Warner and Nina Cortlandt">
<text>Clifford &quot;Cliff&quot; Warner and Nina Cortlandt are fictional characters and a supercouple from the 1980s Cliff and Nina storyline on the American daytime drama &quot;All My Children&quot;. Cliff was portrayed by Peter Bergman, and Nina was portrayed by Taylor Miller.

The two characters were in a popular on-again/off-again relationship that spanned the entire decade, becoming the soap&#x27;s first ever supercouple. Within the story, although the couple split up numerous times, they end up marrying one another in four separate ceremonies, one being titled as &quot;the most sumptuous wedding seen on daytime television up to that date&quot;. For over twenty years, the pairing held the record for the most marriages to each other on a soap opera, at four.


==Storyline==
Dr. Cliff Warner and Nina Cortlandt meet at Pine Valley Hospital where Nina is recovering from an appendectomy. They begin a fairytale romance and fall madly in love. Nina&#x27;s father, Palmer Cortlandt (James Mitchell), disapproves of their relationship, and plots to break them up. Nina, who is diabetic, develops retinopathy, which will make her go blind. Palmer refuses to let her know that there is a cure. Nina break up with Cliff, who she had agreed to marry, in order to not be a burden to him. Eventually, Cliff finds out about Nina&#x27;s condition, and is able to get her treatment. They reconcile and decide to go ahead with their wedding plans. In the meantime, Nina meets ne&#x27;er-do-well, Sean Cudahy (Alan Dysert), who works with Palmer to get Nina away from Cliff.

Nurse Sybil Thorne (Linda Gibboney) plots to get Cliff all to herself. Cliff is vulnerable after his split with Nina and makes love to Sybil, who ends up pregnant with his child. She alerts him to the fact just before his wedding to Nina in November 1980. Despite knowing this could tear them apart, Cliff marries Nina in a fairytale wedding. Sybil gives birth to a boy named Bobby. When Nina finds out the baby&#x27;s parentage from Sybil, she files for divorce. Sybil is found murdered, and Cliff is arrested, but it is later found that Sean Cudahy is the killer. During the trial, it was revealed that Nina&#x27;s friend, stable worker Monique Jonvil (Gillian Spencer), was actually the presumed-dead Daisy Cortlandt, Palmer Cortlandt&#x27;s ex-wife and Nina&#x27;s mother.

Cliff and Nina reconcile before the divorce is finalized. Nina happily adopts Bobby and they settle into domestic bliss. Nina starts a secretarial job with Steve Jacobi (Dack Rambo), who is smitten with her. She battles with her attraction to him in an attempt to make her marriage to Cliff work. Nina is at Cortlandt Manor working with Steve one night when a thunderstorm causes a power outage. Despite her attempts to stay true to her husband, Nina and Steve make love that evening.

From then on, Nina becomes uninterested in Cliff and dreams about her sexual encounter with Steve, which leads to more lovemaking between the two. One day, Cliff catches Nina, but instead of making a fuss, he sneaks away. That evening, he informs Nina of what he knows and demands that they divorce. This is their first divorce.

Before going away on an assignment, Steve persuades Nina to go away with him so they can have some time alone. Their plane crashes, and everyone in Pine Valley, including Cliff, has assumed Nina is dead. She resurfaces unscathed in 1983, but Steve is very badly injured.

Nina tells Cliff that Kim McGuire, an associate of Steve&#x27;s, has died, and she blames herself because Cliff was close with Kim. When Nina says that she should have died in the plane crash, Cliff takes her in an embrace and tells her, &quot;I just thank God you&#x27;re alive!&quot; Cliff&#x27;s new girlfriend, Devon McFadden (Tricia Pursley), sees the exchange of affection and runs off. Eventually, with her mother Ellen Dalton&#x27;s (Kathleen Noone) urging, she leaves town to start afresh without Cliff.

Nina and Steve separate, but instead of being involved with Nina, Cliff becomes involved with Dr. Amy Stone (Catherine Christianson). When Dr. Stone is seriously injured by a drunk driver, Cliff is the only surgeon available to operate on her. He cannot save her, and blames himself. However, Nina is there to pick up the pieces. They marry for the second time by a justice of the peace.

Taylor Miller leaves the role of Nina shortly after that. Zach Grayson befriends Nina, and Liza Colby, who is now Cliff&#x27;s intern, tries to seduce Cliff. Liza does not succeed. Nina resists Zach as well, however Cliff&#x27;s sister Linda plots with Zach to break up Cliff and Nina. They drug Nina and make it look like Nina is having an affair with Zach. They photograph it as well. Linda and Zach are found dead. It is believed that Zach killed Linda, but then Daisy killed Zach. Daisy is found guilty, but is later cleared when Donna remembers that it was Marion Colby who had killed Zach. The strain of all of this causes Nina to have a mental breakdown. Sometime during all of this, Cliff and Nina divorce for the second time.

Nina is released from the sanitarium. After a failed relationship with Benny Sago, she begins dating Matt Connolly (Michael Tylo). They take a vacation to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and they run into Cliff. Matt tells Cliff that Nina is still in love with him. Nina has already boarded a train back to Pine Valley. Cliff manages to get to Nina before the train departs and declares his love for her. In December 1986, they marry for the third time in a lavish ceremony in Tavern on the Green in New York City.

In 1987, Cliff becomes involved in an international rescue for a war-torn South American nation. He is reported killed while attempting to deliver medicine. Nina goes to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard to grieve. Matt Connolly follows her and they end up making love. Nina, afraid of being alone, asks Matt to marry her, which he does. Nina tries to settle into her new life with Matt, but still desperately misses her beloved Cliff.

Nina is stunned when Cliff turns up alive; it turns out he had only been held prisoner. They are overcome with emotion and have a wild night of passionate lovemaking. When he finds out that Nina married Matt, he leaves her. When Nina finds out she is pregnant, a paternity issue arises. Believing her life with Cliff is over, Nina says Matt is the father and they move to Chicago.

Months later, Cliff is proven to be the biological father of the child, Michael. By this time, Cliff is engaged to his doctor colleague, Angie Hubbard (Debbi Morgan). Nina returns to Pine Valley and Angie instantly feels threatened. For good reason, it turned out, as in the end, Cliff and Nina realize they are meant to be. The Warners marry for a fourth time and leave town for a new life in Denver, Colorado.

Nina briefly returned to Pine Valley as part of &quot;All My Children&quot;&#x27;s 25th anniversary from January 3 through January 6, 1995, also for the 40th anniversary celebration, which aired on January 5, 2010, and again on April 20, 2010, with her mother Daisy (Gillian Spencer) for Palmer&#x27;s funeral.

==Reception and impact==
Cliff and Nina&#x27;s romance enthralled viewers. &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, stated, &quot;Nina&#x27;s wedding to Cliff Warner is regarded as one of daytime&#x27;s most-watched moments.&quot; The pairing is considered to be one of soap opera&#x27;s most notable romances. Within a year, Taylor Miller had been voted &#x27;Most Promising Newcomer&#x27; by &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; magazine and enjoyed publicized attention as part of the couple. Following on the success of the Luke and Laura storyline on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, the writing staff at &quot;All My Children&quot; heavily promoted the star-crossed romance. &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; noted Cliff and Nina as one of daytime&#x27;s classic supercouples. Soapdom.com listed Cliff and Nina&#x27;s love story twice in their article &quot;The Exciting 80&#x27;s&quot;.

Victory Gardens Theater, when announcing their world premiere of ensemble member Claudia Allen&#x27;s play &quot;Unspoken Prayers&quot;, featuring Taylor Miller, stated that Miller &quot;reached into the hearts of millions of viewers as Nina, and to this day, long after she is a daily presence on the show, she is constantly stopped on the street, asked how she is, and engaged in &#x27;best friend&#x27; conversations.&quot;

Public fascination with Cliff and Nina&#x27;s romance was theorized by the All American Speaker&#x27;s Bureau. The bureau commented on Bergman&#x27;s soap opera history
