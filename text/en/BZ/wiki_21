<text>The Royal Liver Building is a Grade I listed building in Liverpool, England. It is located at the Pier Head and along with the neighbouring Cunard Building and Port of Liverpool Building is one of Liverpool&#x27;s &quot;Three Graces&quot;, which line the city&#x27;s waterfront. It was also part of Liverpool&#x27;s formerly UNESCO-designated World Heritage Maritime Mercantile City.

Opened in 1911, the building was the purpose-built home of the Royal Liver Assurance group, which had been set up in the city in 1850 to provide locals with assistance related to losing a wage-earning relative. One of the first buildings in the world to be built using reinforced concrete, the Royal Liver Building stands at tall to the top of the spires, to the top of the birds and to the main roof.

The Royal Liver Building is one of the most recognisable landmarks in the city of Liverpool with its two fabled Liver birds, which watch over the city and the sea. Legend has it that if the two birds were to fly away, the city would cease to exist.

The Liver birds are 5.5 m (18 ft) tall. Their added height gives the Royal Liver Building an overall height of 103.7 m (340 ft). A building of skyscraper proportion that was once one of the tallest buildings in the country, the Royal Liver Building is currently the fourth-tallest building in Liverpool.

==History==
In 1907, the Royal Liver Group had over 6,000 employees. Given the need for larger premises, the company approved the construction of a new head office. The building was designed by Walter Aubrey Thomas; the foundation stone was laid on 11 May 1908 and just 3 years later, on 19 July 1911, the building was officially opened by Lord Sheffield. The building is an early example of a building constructed using reinforced concrete, and given the building&#x27;s radical design was considered by some to &quot;be impossible to build&quot;.

During the early 1950s, the sixth floor was occupied and used by No 3 Movements Unit (Embarkation) of the Royal Air Force, overseeing and controlling the movement of RAF personnel and goods through the port.
In 1953, electronic chimes were installed to serve as a memorial to the members of the Royal Liver Friendly Society who died during the two World Wars. During hours of darkness, the clock dials are illuminated.

The building remained the head office for Royal Liver Assurance until its merger with Royal London Group in 2011.

In October 2016, the building was put up for sale for the first time in its history. The owner instructed CBRE Group to list the sale with a guide price of more than £40m. In February 2017, Luxembourg-based investment group, Corestate Capital, bought the building for £48 million along with Everton F.C. majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri. Moshiri planned to run Everton&#x27;s affairs from the building and have his own office to include a view of the new stadium on Bramley Moore Dock.

In 2019, as part of a larger repositioning of the building, a visitor attraction was opened giving the public the chance to tour the West Clock Tower of the building on a regular basis for the first time in its then 108 year history. Previously this had only been open to the public during Heritage Open Days, which have been running during September each year since 1994.

==Description==

The building overlooks the River Mersey from its waterfront location on the Pier Head and forms one of the &#x27;Three Graces&#x27; along with the Port of Liverpool Building and the Cunard Building. This is reflected in the building&#x27;s Grade I listed building status. It has 13 floors.
The Liver birds are 5.5 metres,18 feet tall. Crowning, they give the skyscraper a height of 103.7 metres, 340 feet.

The building is crowned by a pair of clock towers: as a ship passed along the river, mariners could tell the time from these. The clocks were made by Gent and Co. of Leicester. The clock faces are in diameter, larger than those of London&#x27;s famous landmark, the Great Westminster Clock, holding the distinction of being the largest electronically driven clocks in the UK.
The four clock faces have no numerals, only facets indicating the 12 hours. These are disposed as three on the riverside tower, facing west/north/south, the remaining one on the landward tower facing east. There is only one mechanism driving the faces on both of the towers. They were originally named George clocks, because they were started at the precise time that King George V was crowned on 22 June 1911.

Atop each tower stand the mythical Liver birds, designed by Carl Bernard Bartels. The birds are named Bella and Bertie, looking to the sea and inland, respectively. Bella may possibly be named for Isabella of Angoulême, the queen consort of King John, when Liverpool was granted its royal charter. Bertie may possibly be named for Edward VII (known as Bertie to the royal family) who was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland at the time of the building&#x27;s construction. Popular legend has it that while one giant bird looks out over the city to protect its people, the other bird looks out to sea at the new sailors coming in to port. Alternatively, local legend states one Liver bird is male, looking inland to see if the pubs are open, whilst the other is female, looking out to sea to see if there are any handsome sailors coming up the river.

It is also said that, if one of the birds were to fly away the city of Liverpool would cease to exist, thus adding to the mystery of the birds. As a result, both birds are chained to the domes upon which they stand; although this could simply be because the originally gilded Liver birds, of a moulded and hammered copper construction (that is itself fixed onto a rolled-steel armature) are eighteen feet high, ten feet long and themselves carry in their beaks an intricately cast sprig of seaweed. Additionally, however, their heads are three-and-a-half feet long, their wing spread is twelve feet and their legs measure two feet in circumference. The two birds – officially cormorants – have identical and almost traditional poses, standing upright with half-raised wings.

<text>Porin Ässät (; Finnish for &quot;Pori Aces&quot;), officially named Hockey Club Ässät Pori and colloquially known as Pata, is a professional ice hockey club based in Pori, Finland. It competes in the Liiga, the highest-ranking league of ice hockey in Finland. Since 1971, Ässät has played its games in the Isomäki Ice Hall.

The team was founded in 1967 due to a merger of two local sports clubs, Rosenlewin Urheilijat-38 and Porin Karhut. Ässät originally competed in the SM-sarja, which was replaced by the SM-liiga in 1975, making Ässät one of the ten original SM-liiga teams. Ässät was relegated to the I-Divisioona for the 1989–90 season, but it was promoted back to the SM-liiga after just one season.

Ässät has won the Kanada-malja championship three times (in 1971, 1978 and 2013); it also won the Finnish Cup once in 1967. Ässät has a total of nine medals in the upper tier of Finnish ice hockey, with four of them being silver and two of them being bronze. Ässät has been awarded the Aaro Kivilinna Memorial Trophy once in the 1979–80 season. Ässät won a European Cup bronze medal in 1979.

==History==

The Porin Ässät was established in June 1967 when two local sports clubs, Rosenlewin Urheilijat-38 and &quot;Porin Karhut,&quot; merged their sports operations. Although the RU-38 won the SM-sarja championship in 1967, the Rosenlew company seriously considered giving up sports activities, since it felt that hockey did not bring enough positive publicity to the company. The leaders of Karhut and RU-38 negotiated the unification of the clubs during the spring and early summer so secretly that the insiders of the teams did not get to know about the merger negotiations. Karhut benefited less economically from the merger, since the club had invested in player acquisitions to the point where its income did not cover expenses, especially after the Rosenlew club gained sponsors at Karhut&#x27;s expense. As Rosenlew was abandoning its sports club, it was suggested that the RU-38 was merged into Karhut. When an agreement was finally reached, Rosenlew took over a portion of Karhut&#x27;s debts and promised to support the new team financially in its early years. The new club was named Porin Ässät. The birth of the club was announced at the end of June 1967. The name of the club was given by Vilho Santala, who acted as a negotiator in uniting the clubs and was elected the first chairman of Ässät. The club&#x27;s logo was designed by Vesa Antikainen. The colors of the club were red, black and white.

The early days of Ässät did not go smoothly, with a heated atmosphere developing between the formerly Karhut and RU-38 players who were now on the same team. The merger of the two top clubs also raised hopes of a very strong team, but one line of national team-level players joined different teams, and the players who left were mainly RU-38 players from the previous season. The first team of Ässät thus consisted mainly of Karhut players.

The first games of Ässät went well, and even before the start of the 1967 SM-sarja season, Ässät won the Suomen Cup championship. In the final match played in Savonlinna, Ässät beat SaPKo 7–0. Thanks to inheriting the RU-38 championship, Ässät also played in the 1968 European Cup, where it won its first two rounds before being beaten by SC Dynamo Berlin in the quarter-finals.

In its first season in the 1967–68 SM-sarja, Ässät placed fourth with Rauli Virtanen&#x27;s coaching. The new club did not receive unreserved support from the people of Pori, as the number of spectators decreased by 10,000 from the last season of Karhut. In the second season of Ässät attendance started to rise, with the numbers rising to the same level as Karhut had. Lasse Heikkilä, the former coach of Karhut, became the coach for the second season and served as the team&#x27;s coach until 1974 and later in 1976–1981. In the 1968–69 season, Ässät were again fourth. For the following season, 1969–70, Ässät suffered two heavy losses when Veli-Pekka Ketola and Alpo Suhonen left for Jokerit for a year. Ässät finished sixth in the series.
For the season 1970–71, Ässät got a high-class returnee from Helsinki when Veli-Pekka Ketola returned to Pori after playing for one season in Jokerit. Alpo Suhonen also returned to Ässät after Ketola. Ketola&#x27;s return to his home club gave rise to a huge training enthusiasm in other players as well, and coach Lasse Heikkilä took the team on a training trip to Moscow before the start of the season. The trip to the Soviet Union started training very early, by the standards of the time, because there was no ice on Pori in early autumn. In the 1970–71 season Ässät finished third in the regular season after Jokerit and HIFK. In the final series, everything fell into place, Ässät lost only one of their ten matches and overtook the Helsinki clubs ahead. The gold medals were finally secured by a five-point difference to the Jokerit who came in second. The first championship came under the leadership of the forward trio Erkki Väkiparta – Veli-Pekka Ketola – Tapio Koskinen. Other lines behind No. 1 were also able to provide to the team. There were also big names in the defense, such as Antti Heikkilä and Pekka Rautakallio. Veli-pekka Ketola was the highest point scorer in the SM-sarja during the 1970–71 season with 42 points, of which 25 were goals and 17 were assists. Ässät&#x27;s captain during the season was Raimo Kilpiö. Ässät&#x27;s number one goalie was Jorma Valtonen who played every game of the season. Valtonen finished the season with a .922 save percentage.

For the 1975–76 season, Ässät joined the newly formed SM-liiga, making it one of the original ten clubs in the league. Not much was expected from the team. The worst loss was Pekka Rautakallio&#x27;s departure to North America. However, promising young players joined Ässät; Tapio Levo filled the gap left by Rautakallio. The net was blocked by the young Antero Kivelä. The young Ässät team showed their potential in the series by beating the clubs that were predicted to be at top of the series. It was worst experienced by the future champion TPS, who Ässät beat 14–0. However, the access for Ässät to the top four in the playoffs was only decided in the final round against Lukko. In the semi-finals, Ässät challenged Tappara, who advanced to the finals 2–0. In the bronze matches against HIFK, Ässät&#x27;s hunger for victory was greater and the team took the bronze winning the series 2–0.

The 1977–78 season again raised hopes of success when Pekka Rautakallio and Veli-Pekka Ketola returned to Ässät from North America. In addition, promising young people played in the club, such as Arto Javanainen, Kari Makkonen, Tapio Levo and Harry Nikander. Ässät finished second in the regular season after Tappara and defeated TPS 3–2 in the semi-finals. The final series against Tappara did not start promisingly, as Tappara won the first match in Tampere 8–0. However, Ässät won the rest of the games, and the club achieved its second Finnish Championship. The last match at the Porin jäähalli (now Isomäki Areena) was estimated to have been attended by more than 13,000 spectators, even though only 8,600 spectators should have been allowed into the arena at that time. There were more spectators in the arena than in any other previous hockey match played in Finland. In the early years of the SM-liiga in the second half of the 1970s, Ässät was one of the league&#x27;s absolute top teams. The most important player on the team was the captain, center Veli-Pekka Ketola, who had returned from the North American WHA League. Ketola broke the point record in the playoffs at the time.

The season that followed the championship, 1978–79, went as expected for Ässät in the regular season. The team won it by five points to Tappara. In the semi-finals, Ässät knocked out HIFK with a win of 3-0 and advanced to the final against Tappara. Last year&#x27;s finalists struggled again for the championship. The final series became a thrilling play. Tappara won the first two matches, Ässät the next two and the final series thus stretched to the fifth, decisive match. The match played in Pori ended with Tappara&#x27;s 2–5 victory, so Ässät was left with silver. Ässät finished 3rd in the 1978–79 IIHF European Cup.

In the following season, 1979–80, Ässät were nowhere near the previous season in the regular season, finishing fourth. In the semi-finals, TPS was defeated by Ässät 3–1, winning the finals for the third time in a row. HIFK came up against Ässät. HIFK took the championship 3–0, so Ässät were silver medallists again.

After the silver seasons, Ässät suffered bad losses when Veli-Pekka Ketola went back to North America. Tapio Levo also joined the NHL. In addition, Risto Tuomi and Veli-Matti Ruisma went to the Swedish league and Erkki Väkiparta retired. In the following seasons, Ässät placed in the middle caste of the SM-Liiga. For the 1983–84 season, the team received well-known returnees when Tapio Levo returned from the NHL and Risto Tuomi and Harry Nikander from Sweden. The team was also strengthened by its own juniors, from whom more top players of the future were emerging; In addition to Javanainen and Levo, Kari Takko and Christian Ruuttu, among others. The team placed second in the regular season and beat Oulun Kärpät 3–2 in the semi-finals. In the finals, the opponent was again Tappara. The series was close. Ässät won the first match in overtime but Tappara took the next three. The overtime goal of the decisive match secured Tappara the championship with 3–1 victories.

Ässät was relegated to the I-Divisioona after the 1988–89 season. Ässät won 37 of their 44 games in the 1989–90 I-Divisioona season, and played against JoKP in the SM-liiga qualification series, beating them and being promoted back to the league. In the 1990s, one of Ässät&#x27;s achievements was a bronze medal in 1995, beating rival team Rauman Lukko in the bronze game.

After the 1997–98 season, Ässät&#x27;s playing success no longer carried the team into the playoffs, and the following years were quite a toddler at every level of the organization. Bankruptcy was not far off, and senior officials were arrested on suspicion of tax evasion, although charges were subsequently dropped. The base quotation was the season 2000–01, when Ässät were the last in the league.
Ässät played in the 2006 SM-liiga finals, but got beaten by HPK Hämeenlinna. 

Ässät and Sport met in the 2009 SM-liiga qualifiers. Sport played in the second tier Mestis, and Ässät played in the SM-liiga. Ässät beat sport in seven games, winning the last game 3–0. After the series, Ässät fined Sport for €2,000 for broken benches in the arena. The biggest scandal happened when Sport&#x27;s coach Juhani Tamminen commented on the series and the whole league system in a press conference. Tamminen blamed the league for Sport&#x27;s loss in the series, calling it unfair. Tamminen had also threatened Ässät&#x27;s assistant coach Pasi Kaukoranta by telling him that he will rip his head off after Kaukoranta had allegedly provoked him. Tamminen was fined €2,500 by the league.

The 2012–13 season went differently for Ässät. It started the season strongly, but by the turn of the year had fallen below the playoff line. The team sold its No. 1 center, Stephen Dixon to a KHL team Lokomotiv Yaroslavl. At the end of January Ässät started the longest winning streak in their history, ending only in the last previous round of the regular season with an overtimetime loss against Oulu Kärpät. The standings rose to twelfth to fourth. In the quarterfinals, Ässät won KalPa 4–1. Semi-finals against JyP Ässät started with an overtime win when Michael Ryan scored the winning time in 92.51. Ässät won the second match in Pori 2–0 and the third in Jyväskylä 1–4. JyP narrowed the situation with their 1–2 away victory, but Ässät won the fifth match 0–1 and advanced to the finals. Tappara won the first final 2–1 after Jukka Peltola scored five seconds before the end of the regular time. The second final match in Pori was won by Ässät 5–1. In the third match, Tappara was better with 3–2 goals, and the winning goal was scored by Niclas Lucenius just one second before the end of the actual game time. Ässät won the fourth match 4–0 in their home arena. In the fifth final match, Ässät took the away victory with goals 1–2. Veli-Matti Savinainen finished the winning goal from Ville Uusitalo&#x27;s pass in the third overtime in 108.59. The match was the longest final match in SM-liiga history and the third longest in all playoffs. Ässät won the Finnish Championship after winning Tappara in the sixth final 3–2 with Jyri Marttinen&#x27;s goal, and at the same time the whole series was won by Ässät 4–2. The Pori team had won their previous championship in 1978. A real generational change was seen after the match, when the captain of the 1978 championship team, Veli-Pekka Ketola, came on the ice to hand over the Kanada malja to captain Ville Uusitalo.

In the 2017–18 season, Ässät played strongly. Jesperi Kotkaniemi was promoted to the SM-liiga line-up from the U20 league. During the World Championship break in November, Ässät strengthened their team with high-class returnees when Jarno Kärki, who moved to Tappara at the end of the previous season, and Sakari Salminen, who had played abroad for many years, returned. In January, Tommi Taimi returned to Ässät. Ässät were among the top six in the regular season throughout the autumn season, returning to 4th place after the Christmas break. After this, though, Ässät&#x27;s playing worsened and they fired head coach Jyrki Aho. The course of Ässät improved and the team started to win again, finishing in 8th place at the end of the regular season. Ässät sent Lukko directly to the summer holidays with a 2–0 series win and advanced to the semi-finals against Oulun Kärpät. In the series against Kärpät, Ässät were able to challenge them, but the Kärpät eventually won the series 4–1.

In 2024, Ässät won the U20 Finnish Championship, beating HC TPS in four games. Ässät&#x27;s goaltender Topias Rovio was chosen as the playoffs MVP. The championship was the second in club history, as they also won it in 1980.

==Team identity==

===Crest and uniform design===
Ässät&#x27;s primary logo is a spade inside a black ring. Ässät has used variations of the logo, for example the logo from 1982 to 1994, which had a white &quot;Ässät&quot; text on top of the original logo. The logo was designed by Vesa Antikainen.

The club&#x27;s home uniforms have always been red with another color, usually black or white. The original jersey of Ässät was completely red. Ässät&#x27;s home uniform since the 2022–23 season has been red with a small white stripe on the bottom part of the jersey and with white on the shoulders; the team&#x27;s players also wear red pants, red socks with a white stripe, and a white helmet. The away jersey is white with a red stripe on the bottom and with red on the shoulders, and is worn along with red pants, white socks with a red stripe, and a white helmet. In 2023, Ässät added a black-red alternate jersey with a bear logo.

From the early 2000s until 2023, Ässät had used a secondary logo, which was just the primary logo with a red &quot;Ässät&quot; text above it. In 2023 Ässät added red-black bear logo, which included elements from the predecessor clubs of Ässät, like the crown for Rosenlewin Urheilijat-38 and the bear for the Porin Karhut. The logo also had two &quot;hidden&quot; spades that are from the official Ässät logo. The secondary logo was used in the alternate jerseys and merchandise. The bear is a big part of the club&#x27;s identity as it appears in the coat of arms of Pori as well as in the Swedish language name of Pori, &quot;Björneborg&quot;. The bear logo was dropped in 2025 after the Chicago Bears claimed it looked too similar to their logo.

===Mascot===
Ässät&#x27;s mascot has been Rysty Mesikämmen since 2017. Rysty Mesikämmen is a brown bear who wears an ice hockey helmet and Ässät&#x27;s jersey with the number 67.

===Rivalries and fans===

Ässät&#x27;s main rivals are considered to be Rauman Lukko and Vaasan Sport.

Ässät has an official supporter organization called Pataljoona (Finnish for &quot;Battalion&quot;). It is known for its chants, tifos, and flags in Ässät&#x27;s home and away games.

==== Rauman Lukko ====

Ässät and Lukko are rivals mainly because of how their cities are located in the same region and how their arenas are about 50 kilometers from each other. Ässät&#x27;s largest victory against the two teams came in 1978, when Ässät beat Lukko 17–3 on home ice. The rivalry has been nicknamed the &quot;Satakunnan derby&quot;.

==== Vaasan Sport ====

Ässät&#x27;s rivalry against Vaasan Sport grew during the 2009 SM-liiga qualifiers. Ässät beat Sport in the game with seven of the qualifiers and thus kept its spot in the SM-liiga. The games between the clubs are known as the &quot;Kasitien derby&quot;.

==== IFK Helsingfors ====
Ässät has a rivalry with IFK Helsingfors. The games are known to be heated and have multiple istances of fighting. During the 2024–25 season two HIFK players were penalized for kicking Ässät players.

==Home arena==
===Home arena===

The Isomäki Ice Hall (Finnish: Isomäen jäähalli) was opened in 1964 as an outdoor artificial ice rink. The arena was finished in 1971 with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. As of 2023, the spectator capacity is 6,150.

Currently, the Isomäki Ice Hall is known for its closed atmosphere and reputation as a difficult arena for away teams. The arena is located in the Pori sporting center in the Isomäki district. It was last renovated between 2014 and 2016; during this time period, its name was officially changed to Isomäki Areena. The current audience capacity of the arena ranges from 6,150 to 6,500 spectators. As of 9 September 2023, the arena was known by sponsor name, Enersense Areena.

In 2023 after a successful season, the arena got a new jumbotron and new sound technology – increasing the amount of speakers from ten to 130. Isomäki also got more LED screens. The jumbotron was reported to have the best image quality in all of Finland.

===Training facilities===
Ässät mainly practises in the Isomäki Ice Hall, but also uses the Astora Areena, which was constructed in 2011. Astora Areena is owned by Porin Ässät ry and is used by all Ässät junior teams.

== Women&#x27;s team ==

Ässät has had a women&#x27;s representative team in 1982–95 and 1999–2003. Ässät was one of the ten founders of the Naisten SM-sarja (now &quot;Naisten Liiga&quot;). Arguably the best female player to come out of the Ässät junior department after the collapse of the senior team is Sofianna Sundelin, Olympic and World Championship bronze medallist who currently plays for St. Cloud State Huskies in the NCAA Division I.

Notable Ässät alumni include Sari Fisk and Anne Haanpää. Former Ässät player Tatyana Tsaryova is also a World Championship bronze medallist.

=== Team records ===
These are the top-five-point-scorers in franchise history. Figures are updated after each completed season.

<text>The West of Scotland Cricket Club is a cricket club based in Glasgow, Scotland. The club&#x27;s home ground is Hamilton Crescent, located in the Partick area of Glasgow&#x27;s West End.

West of Scotland, traditionally, are one of the working class cricket clubs in Glasgow and on a summer&#x27;s day there can be quite a jovial, rowdy, yet well informed support on the famous banking. West can boast a host of famous players who have both played at the ground and for the club. Recently two of these have been famous Scottish internationalists, the opening batsman Douglas Lockhart and bowler John Blain. Lockhart was a former Oxford UCCE player and having had trials with Derbyshire whilst Blain played professional county cricket for Northamptonshire and Yorkshire before working with West as the club&#x27;s coach.

==History==
West of Scotland Cricket Club was founded in 1862 as a result of a meeting which took place at the then Clarence Hotel in George Square, Glasgow, between a group of local businessmen and players from the Clutha Cricket Club, who had used the northern part of Hamilton Crescent for matches prior to West&#x27;s inception. 

One of the businessmen present was Colonel David Carrick Buchanan who became the first President of the Club and who continued in this role until his death in 1903. Sir David was devoted to the sport of cricket and was patron of a number of clubs, providing invaluable financial assistance to them.

The name, West of Scotland Cricket Club was coined by one John McNeill who was very ambitious for the Club, and who envisaged it becoming the MCC of Scotland. All-England Elevens were invited to the Club and other matches of a similar nature arranged, which included the first ever visit of an Australian team to Scotland in 1878. In the club&#x27;s early decades, they also founded the rugby union team West of Scotland F.C. (now based at Milngavie). In 1872 the Club played host to the first ever international football match, a meeting between Scotland and England, held at the Hamilton Crescent ground and attended by 4,000 spectators.

Tours of England were also undertaken and it was during the first match of one such Tour in July 1885 that a West cricketer achieved a world record which stood for 12 years. The match was against Priory Park C.C. (Chichester) during which Mr. J. S. Carrick batted for two days, achieving a score of 419 not out.

In 1891, Dr. W.G. Grace brought a team to Partick and won by an innings and 33 runs. By 1922 the Club had a membership of over 500, seating accommodation for 3,500 and a turnstile at every entrance. A reconstructed pavilion was opened in April 1923 by the then President, Mr. Peter Dawson and a new scoreboard built in 1936.

Following damage sustained during World War II extensive repairs were made to both the pavilion and ground which included the acquisition of turf from Renfrew Golf Course.

Between 1965 and 1970 Scotland played matches at Hamilton Crescent against New Zealand, the West Indies, MCC and Ireland. In August 1975 a benefit match was held for the then Club Professional, Salahuddin, and those taking part included Colin Cowdrey, Mike Denness, Intikhab Alam, Majid Khan, Asif Iqbal and Sir Garfield Sobers.

Ongoing improvements to the ground and buildings enabled West to continue hosting Senior and International matches and a visit by a Pakistan touring side in 1982 was followed by a series of Benson and Hedges One Day matches between Scotland and Gloucestershire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Northamptonshire. In July 1989 3,500 spectators watched Scotland play Australia. Following this, Scotland also played Essex and Kent at Hamilton Crescent.

West has become a regular venue for the Scottish Cup Final, held at the end of August and the tradition of hosting Representative Fixtures has continued with five European Championship Matches being held at Hamilton Crescent during 2000, namely Holland v. Ireland, Gibraltar v. Portugal, England Cricket Board XI v. Scotland, France v. Greece and Holland v. Denmark.

==Youth System==
The Indoor School was opened in February 1957 and was the first of its kind in Scotland. It has produced an array of youngsters who have come through the ranks and now play an impressive level of cricket. Moneeb Iqbal now plays at Durham and made his first class debut in 2006. In this game Iqbal took a stunning catch on the deep square leg boundary and it has been said that Iqbal is a favourite of the then Durham captain Michael Hussey.

Another product of the coveted West Youth system is Craig Wright, the ex-Captain of the Scottish national team. Wright left West of Scotland for Carlton CC due to work commitments. He has now moved back west to the controversial Greenock CC all-stars and captained them to SNCL Premier League Success in 2007.

Through the work of the Club&#x27;s Junior Convener, Jim Young, and voluntary coaches, the club has produced many players and over the past three years the recent coach, John Blain instigated a Development XI to introduce them into senior cricket.

<doc id="731002" wikidata="Q1910673" url="?curid=731002" title="Flushing–Main Street station (IRT Flushing Line)">
<text>The Flushing–Main Street station (signed as Main Street on entrances and pillars, and Main St–Flushing on overhead signs) is the eastern (railroad north) terminal on the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway, located at Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue in Downtown Flushing, Queens. It is served by the 7 local train at all times and the &lt;7&gt; express train during rush hours in the peak direction.

The Flushing–Main Street station was originally built as part of the Dual Contracts between the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT). It opened on January 21, 1928, completing the segment of the Flushing Line in Queens. Although plans existed for the line to be extended east of the station, such an extension was never built. The station was renovated in the 1990s. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) began constructing additional staircases, including four new entrances, at the station in 2022.

The station has two island platforms and three tracks; the platforms are connected at their eastern end. There are nine entrances at street level, leading to two separate fare control areas at Main Street and at Lippmann Plaza. There is an elevator, which makes the station compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2019, it was the busiest station outside of Manhattan, as well as the 12th busiest subway station in the system.

==History==
===Planning and construction===

The 1913 Dual Contracts called for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, or BMT) to build new lines in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Queens did not receive many new IRT and BRT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city&#x27;s Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway crowding in the other two boroughs first before building in Queens, which was relatively undeveloped. The IRT Flushing Line was to be one of two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, and it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens&#x27;s oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there.

At the time of the line&#x27;s planning, Downtown Flushing was a quiet Dutch-colonial-style village; what is now Roosevelt Avenue in the area was known as Amity Street, a major commercial thoroughfare in the neighborhood. In late 1912, Flushing community groups were petitioning the Public Service Commission (PSC) to depress the proposed line in Flushing into a subway tunnel, rather than an elevated line. Unlike a subway, an el would cause disturbances to the quality of life and a loss in nearby property values, as well as a widening of Amity Street that would cause more changes to the already existing town. One Amity Street property owner compared the planned effect of an elevated Flushing Line on Amity Street to the degradation of Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn after the Myrtle Avenue Elevated was built there. On the other hand, a subway would only require that the street be widened, even though it was more expensive than an elevated of the same length.

On January 20, 1913, because of these concerns, the Flushing Association voted to demand that any IRT station in Flushing be built underground. Due to advocacy for elevated extensions to the line past Flushing (see ), the PSC vacillated on whether to build a subway or elevated for the next few months. The PSC finally voted to bring the Flushing portion of the line underground in April 1913. However, as the costs of a subway had increased by then, they decided to postpone discussion of the matter. In June 1913, the New York City Board of Estimate voted to allow the line to be extended from 103rd Street–Corona Plaza east to Flushing as a three-track line, with a possible two-track second phase to Bayside.

The Flushing Line west of 103rd Street opened in 1917. The IRT agreed to operate the line under the condition that any loss of profits would be repaid by the city. As part of the agreement, the PSC would build the line eastward to at least Flushing. The station, as well as two other stations at Willets Point Boulevard and 111th Street, was approved in 1921 as part of an extension of the Flushing Line past 103rd Street. Construction of the station and the double-deck bridge over the Flushing Creek began on April 21, 1923, with the station built via cut-and-cover methods. The bridge was completed in 1927, and the station opened on January 21, 1928, over a decade after the line initially began operation.

===Proposed extension of the line===

The station was not intended to be the Flushing Line&#x27;s terminus. While the controversy over an elevated line in Flushing was ongoing in January 1913, the Whitestone Improvement Association pushed for an elevated to Whitestone, College Point, and Bayside. However, some members of that group wanted to oppose the Flushing line&#x27;s construction if there was not going to be an extension to Whitestone. After the January 20 vote to demand that the subway line through Flushing be built underground, groups representing communities in south Flushing collaborated to push for an elevated along what was then the LIRR&#x27;s Central Branch, in the current right-of-way of Kissena Corridor Park. Eleven days later, the PSC announced its intent to extend the line as an el from Corona to Flushing, with a possible further extension to Little Neck Bay in Bayside. There was consensus that the line should not abruptly end in Corona, but even with the extension to Bayside, the borough would still have fewer Dual Contracts route mileage than either Brooklyn or the Bronx. &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote that compared to the Bronx, Queens would have far less subway mileage per capita even with the Flushing extension.

The Bayside extension was tentatively approved in June 1913, but only after the construction of the initial extension to Flushing. Under the revised subway expansion plan put forth in December 1913, the Flushing Line would be extended past Main Street, along and/or parallel to the right-of-way of the nearby Port Washington Branch of the LIRR towards Bell Boulevard in Bayside. A spur line would branch off north along 149th Street towards College Point.

In 1914, the PSC chairman and the commissioner committed to building the line toward Bayside. However, at the time, the LIRR and IRT were administered separately, and the IRT plan would require rebuilding a section of the Port Washington branch between the Broadway and Auburndale stations. The LIRR moved to block the IRT extension past Flushing since it would compete with the Port Washington Branch service in Bayside. One member of the United Civic Association submitted a proposal to the LIRR to let the IRT use the Port Washington Branch to serve Flushing and Bayside, using a connection between the two lines in Corona. The PSC supported the connection as an interim measure, and on March 11, 1915, it voted to let the Bayside connection be built. Subsequently, engineers surveying the planned intersection of the LIRR and IRT lines found that the IRT land would not actually overlap with any LIRR land. The LIRR president at the time, Ralph Peters, offered to lease the Port Washington and Whitestone Branches to the IRT for rapid transit use for $250,000 annually (), excluding other maintenance costs. The lease would last for ten years, with an option to extend the lease by ten more years. The PSC favored the idea of the IRT being a lessee along these lines, but did not know where to put the Corona connection. Even the majority of groups in eastern Queens supported the lease plan. The only group who opposed the lease agreement was the Flushing Association, who preferred the original Flushing subway plan.

Afterward, the PSC largely ignored the lease plan since it was still focused on building the first phase of the Dual Contracts. The Flushing Business Men&#x27;s Association kept advocating for the Amity Street subway, causing a schism between them and the rest of the groups that supported the LIRR lease. Through the summer of 1915, the PSC and the LIRR negotiated the planned lease to $125,000 a first year, , with an eight percent increase each year; the negotiations then stalled in 1916. The Whitestone Improvement Association, impatient with the pace of negotiations, approved of the subway under Amity Street even though it would not serve them directly. The PSC&#x27;s chief engineer wrote in a report that a combined 20,600 riders would use the Whitestone and Bayside lines each day in either direction, and that by 1927, there would be 34,000 riders per day per direction. The Third Ward Rapid Transit Association wrote a report showing how much they had petitioned for Flushing subway extensions to that point, compared to how little progress they had made in doing so. Negotiations continued to be stalled in 1917. Despite the line not having been extended past Corona yet, the idea of a subway extension to Little Neck encouraged development there.

The Whitestone Branch would have had to be rebuilt if it were leased to the subway, with railroad crossings removed and the single track doubled. The PSC located 14 places where crossings needed to be eliminated. However, by early 1917, there was barely enough money to build the subway to Flushing, let alone a link to Whitestone and Bayside. A lease agreement was announced on October 16, 1917, but the IRT withdrew from the agreement a month later, citing that it was inappropriate to enter such an agreement at that time. Thereafter, the PSC instead turned its attention back to the Main Street subway extension.

Even after the station opened in 1928, efforts to extend the line past Flushing persisted. In 1928, the New York City Board of Transportation (BOT) proposed allowing IRT trains to build a connection to use the Whitestone branch, but the IRT did not accept the offer since this would entail upgrading railroad crossings and the single-tracked line. Subsequently, the LIRR abandoned the branch in 1932. As part of the 1929 IND Second System plan, the Flushing Line would have had branches to College Point and Bayside east of Main Street. That plan was revived in 1939. The BOT kept proposing an extension of the Flushing Line past Main Street until 1945, when World War II ended and new budgets did not allow for a Flushing extension. In 1956, the Queens Chamber of Commerce and Queens Transit Committee again proposed the extensions east of the station to Bayside and College Point, along with a new spur along Kissena Boulevard running south to Sutphin Boulevard in Jamaica and eventually leading to John F. Kennedy International Airport. Since then, several New York City Transit Authority proposals for an eastward extension have all failed.

===Later years===
====1930s to 1960s====
Following the station&#x27;s opening, Downtown Flushing evolved into a major commercial and transit center, as development sprung around the section of Main Street near the station. On April 24, 1939, express trains began operating to and from the station, in conjunction with the reconstruction of the Willets Point station for the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair. Due to the high level of passenger use, beginning in 1940 local residents requested an additional exit at the east end of the station, and the widening of existing staircases. A new eastern entrance was added after World War II. Ground broke on the new entrance on November 5, 1947, and it opened on October 28, 1948 with two new street stairs and an additional token booth. Upon its initial opening, the new entrance did little to relieve crowding at the main fare control area.

The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The IRT routes were given numbered designations in 1948 with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The route from Times Square to Flushing became known as the 7. On October 17, 1949, the joint BMT/IRT operation of the Flushing Line ended, and the line became the responsibility of the IRT. After the end of BMT/IRT dual service, the New York City Board of Transportation announced that the Flushing Line platforms would be lengthened to 11 IRT car lengths; the platforms were only able to fit nine 51-foot-long IRT cars beforehand. The platforms at Main Street and all other stations on the Flushing Line, with the exception of Queensboro Plaza, were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate , 11-car trains. An additional entrance was constructed to the north side of Roosevelt Avenue in the 1960s. However, nine-car trains continued to run on the 7 route until 1962, when they were extended to ten cars. With the opening of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, trains were lengthened to eleven cars.

====1970s to present====
A station renovation had been planned since the 1970s. In 1981, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. The MTA finally found funding for the station&#x27;s renovation in 1994—at the expense of the renovations of 15 other stations, including three Franklin Avenue Line stations and the Atlantic Avenue–Pacific Street, Roosevelt Avenue/74th Street, and 161st Street–Yankee Stadium station complexes—because the station was a &quot;vital station&quot; for commuters from Eastern Queens. Between 1999 and 2000, the station underwent a major renovation project. The renovation added an elevator near the eastern Lippmann Plaza exit that made the station compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The project also added new street entrances and a large entrance hall near Lippmann Plaza at the far east end of the station, beyond the bumper blocks at the end of the tracks.

The Flushing–Main Street station has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since October 2004. The National Park Service listed the station because it was considered a good historic example of Squire J. Vickers architecture during the time of construction.

As part of the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Program, New York City allocated $300 million to be used for projects to increase subway station capacity and to make them ADA accessible. One of the projects being funded will increase station circulation at Main Street. Four additional staircases would be added between the platforms and the mezzanine; additional street to mezzanine staircases would be added at the northeastern, northwestern and southwestern corners of Roosevelt Avenue and Main Street; and two new entrance staircases leading from the west-most area of the mezzanine to Roosevelt Avenue halfway between Main Street and Prince Street would be constructed. To provide space for the new staircases to and from the mezzanine, several employee rooms would be relocated. At the bottom of each new staircase, a new fare control area would be installed in the mezzanine, with four turnstiles. In addition, the project would strengthen or reframe the mezzanine wall liner and roof level beams, and the four existing platform-to-mezzanine staircases would be modified and would receive ADA-compliant handrails and guardrails. The project also included five countdown clocks, 15 digital information displays, and new cameras. The design for this project was completed in January 2020, and construction was to have started in September 2020. Work on the new staircases began in June 2022, with an estimated cost of $61 million; at the time, the work was expected to be complete in October 2023.

The MTA announced in late 2022 that it would open customer service centers at 15 stations; the centers would provide services such as travel information and OMNY farecards. The first six customer service centers, including one at Flushing–Main Street, were to open in early 2023. The customer service center at the Main Street station opened in March 2023. The new staircases, entrances, and turnstiles were finished in November 2023; the project had cost $49 million, less than the original budget. The MTA announced in 2024 that it would replace the station&#x27;s existing waist-high turnstiles with taller, wide-aisle turnstiles.

== Station layout ==
The station has three tracks and two relatively narrow island platforms that are wide. It is located entirely under Roosevelt Avenue, which is wide; the avenue was not widened when the subway was built. The 7 train stops here at all times, and the &lt;7&gt; train stops here during rush hours in the peak direction. The station is the eastern terminus for 7 trains; the next station to the west is . Main Street is one of only seven underground stations on the Flushing Line, one of three underground stations on the line in Queens, and the only underground station east of Hunters Point Avenue.

When peak-direction express service operates, express trains leave from the middle and southernmost tracks, Track M and Track 2 respectively, while local trains leave from Track 1. This system was instituted in November 1952. Mosaic on the wall tiles read &quot;MAIN STREET&quot;, and small tiles along the platform walls read &quot;M&quot;. The station was built with the cut-and-cover method. Its exterior walls consist of columns located at intervals, with the intermediate spaces filled with concrete.

At the west end of the platforms are the offices and dispatch tower for the IRT Flushing Line. Train crews report to the offices, while the dispatch tower dispatches trains and controls the Flushing Line. West of the station, the line rises from the tunnel via a portal at College Point Boulevard, and onto the elevated bridge across Flushing Creek.

===Exits===
There are nine entrances at street level, leading to two separate fare control areas. The original street exit is in the middle of the platforms with a separate mezzanine above the tracks, which contains the fare control area and the 24-hour station agent&#x27;s booth. Staircases lead up to all four corners of Main Street and Roosevelt Avenue. Eight staircases lead from the mezzanine to platform level. An entrance used to lead from the mezzanine to the basement of a Woolworths store, but this has been walled off. There were also restrooms along this mezzanine with corresponding tile mosaics.

The fare control area at Lippmann Plaza has an extremely high ceiling, with the lobby itself located approximately below the street level. The mezzanine is at platform level, and provides an ADA-compliant elevator, three unidirectional escalators, and a stairway to street level at Lippmann Plaza. New artwork titled &quot;Happy World&quot; was installed over the row of turnstiles in 1998. The plaza, also known as Lippmann Arcade, is a pedestrian walkway that leads to a municipal parking lot and several bus stops on 39th Avenue.

==Bus service==
In addition to connecting with the nearby Long Island Rail Road station of the same name, the station serves as one of the two busiest local bus-subway interchanges in Queens (along with Jamaica Center) and the largest in North America, with over 20 bus routes running through or terminating in the area .

==Ridership==
The passenger count for the station in 2019 was 17,568,837, making it the 12th busiest subway station system-wide, the busiest station outside of Manhattan, and the busiest station served by one service. This amounted to an average of 56,503 passengers per weekday. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, ridership dropped drastically in 2020, with only 6,944,923 passengers entering the station that year. The Flushing–Main Street station was the 10th busiest station system-wide in 2020. However, due to a steep drop in ridership in Manhattan, it was no longer the busiest station outside Manhattan, having been surpassed by the Jackson Heights–Roosevelt Avenue/74th Street station.

==Attractions and points of interest==

<text>Hawaii Pacific University (HPU) is a private university in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States. 

Oceanic Institute of HPU, an aquaculture research facility, is located at Makapuu Point. HPU is also present on military installations on the island of Oahu.

== History ==
HPU was founded in 1965 as Hawaii Pacific College by Paul C.T. Loo, Eureka Forbes, Elizabeth W. Kellerman, and Reverend Edmond Walker. Wanting a private liberal arts college in Honolulu, the four applied for a charter of incorporation for a not-for-profit corporation to be called Hawaii Pacific College. The state of Hawaii granted a charter of incorporation to Hawaii Pacific on September 17, 1965.

In September 1966, Honolulu Christian College established in 1949 merged into Hawaii Pacific College, and a new charter was granted by the state of Hawaii. In 1967, James L. Meader became Hawaii Pacific College&#x27;s first president. Meader, in consultation with community leaders, developed a comprehensive educational program.

When President Meader retired on June 30, 1968, the board of trustees elected George A. Warmer as Hawaii Pacific&#x27;s second president. Under Warmer&#x27;s leadership, the college implemented academic programs in the liberal arts and cooperative education.

In 1972, Hawaii Pacific College graduated seven students in its first commencement class and in the same year established a School of Business Administration. Chatt G. Wright became the founding dean of Hawaii Pacific&#x27;s new School of Business Administration.

In 1973, the college received full accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. The following years saw the creation of the English Foundations Program, offering instruction to non-native speakers of English, and the Division of Special Programs, administering off-campus instruction on various military installations on Oahu.

Warmer retired in 1976, and Chatt G. Wright became Hawaii Pacific&#x27;s third president. Under his leadership, Hawaii Pacific continued to expand and develop through the 1980s. Augmenting its undergraduate program of baccalaureate and associate degrees, Hawaii Pacific launched a Master of Business Administration program in 1986, a Master of Science in Information Systems program in 1989, and a Master of Arts in Human Resource Management in 1991.

Hawaii Pacific became Hawaii Pacific University (HPU) in 1990.

In 1992, Hawaii Loa College, a small, independent, liberal arts college on the windward side of Oahu, merged into Hawaii Pacific University.

In 2004, the HPU International Vocal Ensemble made their Carnegie Hall debut where they performed Morten Lauridsen&#x27;s &quot;Lux Aeterna and O Magnum Mysterium.&quot;

In 2011, President Chatt G. Wright retired and Geoffrey Bannister became HPU&#x27;s fourth president.

In January 2013, the Aloha Tower Development Corporation (ATDC) consented to the university&#x27;s ownership and management of the Aloha Tower Marketplace. The approvals passed by ATDC were essential to Hawaii Pacific&#x27;s plan to move forward in redeveloping the marketplace into a mixed-use property featuring outstanding student housing, retail and dining businesses, and community gathering spaces.

HPU completed a merger to bring Oceanic Institute formally into the university in January 2014.

In June 2014, HPU held a ceremonial groundbreaking and traditional Hawaiian blessing at Aloha Tower Marketplace, marking the official start of revitalizing this iconic waterfront destination.

The $50 million Aloha Tower Marketplace revitalization project was completed in August 2015, opening to students and the community. Aloha Tower Marketplace serves as an anchor for the university&#x27;s core downtown Honolulu campus, including a center for higher education and university housing integrated within a community gathering and retail space.

On July 1, 2016, John Yukio Gotanda, took office as Hawaii Pacific University&#x27;s fifth president. Born and raised in Hawaii, President Gotanda returned to lead HPU.

== Campus ==
=== Aloha Tower Marketplace and Downtown Honolulu Campus ===
HPU&#x27;s Aloha Tower Marketplace serves as an anchor for HPU in the downtown area. Aloha Tower Marketplace is a mixed-use facility that includes student housing, HPU&#x27;s Welcome Center, Learning Commons, Lounge, Student Café, Student Fitness Center, ESports Arena, and a variety of restaurants, businesses, classrooms, and meeting rooms for university and community use.

HPU&#x27;s athletic department is centrally located in Honolulu&#x27;s business district, and it is a few blocks&#x27; walk to the state capitol. HPU&#x27;s College of Business, which is headquartered in Pioneer Plaza, includes computer based classrooms along with meeting spaces. In 2016, HPU opened its downtown INBRE (IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence) research labs, providing students with biomedical instrumentation and laboratory facilities.

Hawaii Loa Campus

In summer 2024, HPU closed the Hawaii Loa campus, commonly referred to as HLC. The former campus is located eight miles away from the downtown campus, near Castle Junction in Kāneohe, on the windward side of the Koolau Range. HLC was originally built by Hawaii Loa College, a liberal arts school that was merged into Hawaii Pacific University in 1992. This campus housed the natural sciences, nursing, public health, and social work programs. The name &quot;Hawaii Loa&quot; refers to the Polynesian navigator, Hawaiiloa, who is credited in folklore with the discovery of the islands. In 2017, HPU sold the property to Castle Medical Center, but continued to lease the space until 2024.

=== Oceanic Institute ===
The Oceanic Institute (OI) of HPU is a research facility focused on the advancement of sustainable aquaculture technologies. OI of HPU is located on a 56-acre site at Makapuu Point on the windward coast of Oahu. OI conducts research, education, and training that focuses on marine aquaculture, aquatic feeds and nutrition, and coastal resource management. In 2013, OI of HPU commissioned a teaching laboratory to complement classroom and conference space at OI of HPU&#x27;s Ocean Learning Center (OLC). The OLC annex supports biotechnology research and education with two research labs, a teaching lab, and a distance learning center

=== Military programs ===
HPU&#x27;s Military Campus Programs (MCP) operates full-service campuses on Oahu&#x27;s US military bases, including Pearl Harbor, Hickam Air Force Base, Tripler Army Medical Center, Camp H. M. Smith, Schofield Barracks, and Kaneohe Marine Corps Base Hawaii.

== Academics ==
Hawaii Pacific University is made up of the following colleges: the College of Business, College of Liberal Arts, Graduate College of Health Sciences, College of Natural and Computational Sciences, and the College of Professional Studies. HPU offers both undergraduate and graduate programs in each of its colleges and schools.

The university also has an extensive distance learning and online-based platform for many of its programs. HPU also has an extensive Study Abroad and Student Exchange Program.

The student to faculty ratio is 12 to 1.

Hawaii Pacific University is regionally accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and received a reaffirmation of its accreditation in 2016, extending to 2022. The School of Education has received accreditation for its B.Ed. and M.Ed. degree programs by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation. The Nursing Program&#x27;s BSN and MSN degrees are approved by the Hawaii Board of Nursing and is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education. The Social Work Program&#x27;s BSW and MSW degrees are accredited by the Council on Social Work Education.

* Matthew LoPresti, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Philosophy and Humanities and Chair of the Asian Studies Program, and a former Democratic member of the Hawaii House of Representatives.

== Athletics ==

The university&#x27;s athletic teams are called the Sharks. They compete in the Pacific West Conference as part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division II.

<text>Icky Mettle is the debut studio album recorded by the indie rock band Archers of Loaf. It was produced and engineered by Caleb Southern at Kraptone Studios in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and released by Alias Records in 1993. A deluxe reissue of the album was released by Merge Records in 2011.

The album was recorded and mixed in seven days. According to Eric Bachmann, &quot;We spent like $5,000 to make it.&quot;

==Reception==

&quot;Icky Mettle&quot; received generally positive reviews. &quot;Interview&quot; declared it the &quot;Best Indie Rock Album of the Year&quot;. &quot;The Gazette&quot; listed it among the top 10 albums of 1993.

==Legacy==
&quot;Icky Mettle&quot; ranked number 32 in &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s original Top 100 Albums of the 1990s list, and &quot;Blender&quot; ranked it at number 56 in their 100 Greatest Indie-Rock Albums Ever list. In a retrospective review, &quot;Spin&quot;″s Mike Powell describes it as &quot;an album of boyish fits and noisy guitar flurries. It&#x27;s indie rock as hearty and art-free as oatmeal, before the line separating it from the mainstream dissolved, before it became so... eclectic.&quot;

In a 2005 interview with &quot;The Triangle&quot;, Eric Bachmann reflected on the album: &quot;When we first came out we had that energy. It&#x27;s a weird thing that you can&#x27;t put your finger on... I listened to &quot;Icky Mettle&quot;, and I almost cringe when I hear it. But what the people probably liked when they heard that record was the energy we were putting out.&quot;

In 2011, Chris Carrabba of Dashboard Confessional covered &quot;Web in Front&quot; on his album &quot;Covered in the Flood&quot;.

<doc id="731012" wikidata="Q4116626" url="?curid=731012" title="Middlesex Centre">
<text>Middlesex Centre is a township in Middlesex County, in southwestern Ontario, Canada, north and west of London. The Corporation of the Township of Middlesex Centre formed on January 1, 1998, with the amalgamation of the former Townships of Delaware, Lobo, and London (not to be confused with the adjacent city of London). It is part of the London census metropolitan area.

Middlesex Centre is halfway between two of the five Great Lakes. It is north of Lake Erie, and southeast of Lake Huron. Further to the east of Middlesex Centre is Lake Ontario, while to the west is the much smaller Lake St. Clair. That makes Middlesex Centre very desirable for farming for its frequent precipitation, and it also has higher than normal snowfall from lake-effect snow in the winter, causing desirable spring planting conditions (but also less desirable snow removal issues for its residents).

The same benefits received by the precipitation of the surrounding lakes also subjects the area to severe summer weather conditions because of the convection of any of the surrounding bodies of water in the summer heat. Middlesex Centre suffered a hit by an F3 tornado in 1990 at Komoka.

==Communities==
Statistics Canada records the following places as being part of Middlesex Centre in 2011: Arva, Ballymote, Birr, Bowood, Bryanston, Coldstream, Delaware, Denfield, Devizes, Duncrief, Ettrick, Fernhill, Ilderton, Ivan, Kilworth Heights, Komoka, Komoka Station, Lansdowne Park, Littlewood, Lobo, Lobo Siding, Lockwood Park, London, Maple Grove, Melrose, Middlesex, Middlesex Centre, Oriole Park Resort, Poplar Hill, Sharon, Southgate, Telfer, Uplands Subdivision, Vanneck.

A record snowfall (&quot;Snow-maggedon&quot;) occurred between Dec. 4–8, 2010, affecting Huron and Middlesex Counties. A total of of snow fell during a 102-hour period (it snowed on 98 of those 102 hours).

===Arva===

Arva is at the intersection of Provincial Highway 4 (Richmond Street) and Medway Road (7th Concession). The community is the home of Medway High School, Centennial Central Public School, Tamarak tree farm, Weldon Park, the Arva Flour Mill and store, The MillHouse (local, natural and organic foods), a furniture store, a tack shop, a post office, and two churches, as well as personalities such as the former mayor of the City of London, Ontario and former Member of Parliament for London North Centre Joe Fontana, President of University of St. Michael&#x27;s College at the University of Toronto David Sylvester (academic), and Ben Dreyer, a famous area horseback rider, hunter, tanner, and first nation&#x27;s skinner. Arva is on a pond (known as &quot;the mill pond&quot;) on Medway Creek. There is also a forest known as the sanctuary (in St. John&#x27;s Estates); the bush runs along the creek and goes down into a camp site that at one time was quite popular.

The demonym for someone from Arva is an Arvite.

In the 19th century, Arva was a critical rest stop on the Underground Railroad, and home to several homes constructed as part of the Railroad.

===Birr===

Birr is at the intersection of Highway 4 (Richmond Street) and 13 Mile Road. Despite its small size, Birr has maintained itself and supported various private business throughout the years. There are also three cemeteries, a gift shop called Legg&#x27;s General Store, a furniture store and a second-hand book store.

Until it was replaced by a modern low-rise concrete bridge in the mid-1970s, Birr had a one-lane iron bridge on the 13th Concession that crossed the Medway Creek. Birr had a hotel in the late 19th century; afternoon stagecoaches running between London and Lucan, 7 miles to the north, would stop overnight in Birr, in those days the approximate half-way point, and resume travel the next day.

===Coldstream===

Coldstream is a hamlet in Middlesex Centre with a population of approximately 200. The municipal offices for Middlesex Centre are in Coldstream. Before it became Middlesex Centre by combining the Townships of Delaware, Lobo, and London in 1998, Coldstream was included in Lobo Township and was situated in the centre of Lobo. It is estimated that immigrants from Scotland obtained land grants and settled as early as 1820 in Lobo. Coldstream was previously known as Cutler, probably because the Cutler family operated and owned much of the town. Today Coldstream has an antique and quilt shop, elementary school (Valleyview Public School), fire hall, library, concrete business, conservation area and the Municipal Office for Middlesex Centre, as well as many volunteer organizations and events within the community.

The Friend&#x27;s Meeting House was established on Quaker Lane in 1850 and a library was organized in 1887.

Much of the industry that Coldstream was founded upon has relocated to larger towns and cities such as Ilderton and London.

===Delaware===

Delaware straddles the Thames River, and is accessed by the old highway (Highway 2) linking London and Chatham and the freeway (Highway 402) linking Sarnia along with Port Huron and Toronto. The community of Delaware was first founded in 1796. Delaware was the objective of an American raid into Upper Canada in 1814 during the War of 1812, which resulted in the Battle of Longwoods, on March 4, 1814, just about 24 km outside of Delaware.

Delaware has two elementary schools, Delaware Central Public School (The Mustangs) (Thames Valley District School Board), and Our Lady of Lourdes (The Saints) (London District Catholic School Board). They are about one kilometre apart. Delaware Central has about 175 students, while Our Lady of Lourdes has around 400.

Delaware is nestled in the Thames River Valley, although it has now expanded over the top of the valley ridge. Most of the area surrounding Delaware is made up of forests and floodplain areas. Corn, soybeans and tobacco are farmed extensively in the area around Delaware, as well as inside the town limits in some areas. Delaware has undergone modest growth in housing over the last 30 years, with the developed area nearly doubling in that time. Many of the buildings in the heart of Delaware are reputed to be over one hundred years old. These include the building that is now Delaware Variety as well as the antique shop across the street. Belvoir Manor is a private home that was at one point a seminary and a private school for boys, and at one point was destroyed by fire. The surrounding Belvoir Farms in which it is located is a prominent croquet venue for Croquet Canada.

Delaware boasts a number of tourist destinations despite its small size. Delaware Speedway is a half-mile paved race track that is one of the oldest in Canada. The track hosts stock car racing every Friday night during the summer, as well as several Saturday and Sunday race features. The track has also hosted major concert events in the past including I Mother Earth and Matthew Good. The Longwoods Road Conservation Area features Skah-Nah-Doht, a recreated Iroquoian village complete with longhouses and tours, as well as a museum featuring exhibits of Iroquoian culture and archaeological artifacts. The park hosts a yearly native festival as well as a re-enactment of the Battle of Longwoods.

===Elginfield===

Elginfield is at the corner of Highway 4 and Highway 7, with the junction of Highway 23 just to the east. The University of Western Ontario operates an observatory near the community.

===Ilderton===

Ilderton is along Middlesex County Road 16 (Ilderton Road) to the west of Highway 4 (Richmond Street), at the junction of Middlesex County Road 20 (Hyde Park Road). Prior to the late 1990s, the village was also accessible by railway. CN Rail had a rail line running north from Hyde Park to Clinton through the village. This rail line was abandoned from Ilderton north to Centralia in 1988, and south of Ilderton circa 1996. The portion of the former rail line south of County Road 16 has been converted to parkland.

The Ilderton Independent Telephone Company served the Ilderton exchange until 1962 when the operations were acquired by The Bell Telephone Company of Canada. Ilderton is within boundary of three telephone area codes (NPA); 226, 519 and 548. Three telephone exchanges (NXX) are in operation for the Ilderton area, 519-666 (Bell) who provide traditional land-line services and DSL, 519-298 (Execulink Telecom) providers of Cable VOIP telephone services, and 226-308 (Quadro Communications - a co-op independent telecom). The majority of the 16,000 residents of the Municipality of Middlesex Centre are identified as &quot;Ilderton&quot; in the telephone directories, with the exception of extreme southwest area of the Municipality (Komoka and Kilworth) who are assigned &quot;London&quot; telephone numbers out of the Hyde Park Exchange. In February 2014, Ilderton celebrated the 150th Anniversary of the local Post Office. The first postmaster, named the Village &quot;Ilderton&quot; based on the village of Ilderton, Northumberland, UK, where he emigrated from.

Ilderton is home to a district fire station (As of March 31, 2014 - Emergency calls are answered by the Strathroy-Caradoc Police Service in nearby Strathroy, ending a decades long agreement with the nearby City of London.), Police Services are provided under contract with the OPP Middlesex County detachment. EMS/Ambulance Medical Services are provided by Station 14 in North West London, (approximately five minutes from Ilderton). The village houses a seniors apartment complex, a restaurant, two convenience stores, two gas stations, and a garage, a DIY Car Wash, 24-hour fitness facility, three hair salons, florist, computer sales and repair business, a county library, medical centre, a nature trail, two pizza businesses, and three parks - one of which contains a splash pad for children, and numerous home businesses. As the community is surrounded mainly by agricultural land, industry in the area is mostly farming.

The Ilderton Fair is one of the largest country fairs in Southern Ontario and brings huge crowds to the village every fall. The fall parade can take over an hour to go by and the events at the fairground and arena entertain young and old alike all weekend. At other times of the year the fairgrounds host many agricultural and equine events, the arena is home to sporting events year-round and is the focus for local hockey through the fall to spring. Alongside the arena is the Ilderton Curling Club. It has a 4-sheet surface and a bar overlooking the ice. During the winter Ilderton becomes a hub for snow-mobilers as there are several trails which pass through or close by plus the availability of fuel for both machines and riders.

Ilderton is the hometown of ice dancer Scott Moir, who captured Gold with partner Tessa Virtue at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia. The pair also earned two silver medals at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia and two gold medals at the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in PyeongChang, South Korea. They are the most decorated Figure Skaters in Olympic history.

Ilderton is also the hometown of Toronto Marlies forward #10 Matt Read.

===Komoka===
Komoka village is a crossing point for many railway lines and was formerly a railway hot spot featuring various hotels and development. Today, the Komoka Railway museum keeps the local railway history alive and features unique artifacts such as a 1913 Shay Steam Engine and a 1972 Grand Trunk Western caboose. There is an elementary school - Parkview Public School, and Providence Reformed Collegiate − a private Christian high school, and the new Komoka Wellness Centre in the village. The village also supports a number of youth sports teams, including baseball and soccer. The Komoka Park has two baseball and two soccer fields, tennis courts, and a children&#x27;s play area. There are two small business areas in the village: the downtown Komoka Foodtown and Post Office area, and the Glendon Drive / Komoka Road intersection with a bank, gas stations and variety stores, restaurants, and hair salon.

Komoka is experiencing a population growth due to several new subdivision developments. Consequently, the elementary school&#x27;s enrolment has rapidly increased resulting in substantial renovations. In 1986 a 20 unit seniors apartment building was built and named the Malott Apartments, after the Late Arthur Malott who donated all the funds for its construction. In 2009 a second 20 unit seniors apartment building was added to form the Komoka Seniors Apartments Complex. In 2011 the new Komoka Community Wellness Centre was opened and is home to the Elgin Middlesex Chiefs AAA Hockey teams, Komoka Kings Jr. B hockey team of the GOJHL, and was home to the Komoka Dragons Jr A hockey team of the GMHL. It also offers a YMCA fitness centre, walking track, two NHL size ice rinks, a library, meeting rooms, and an outside children&#x27;s play area. Komoka Provincial Park with walking trails is close by, as well as FireRock, so named because of finding an old native fire rock on the site during the new golf course construction, Oxbow Glen Golf and Country Club and The Oaks golf courses. The village has a Middlesex County EMS satellite ambulance station.

In partnership with Delaware and Mount Brydges, the three communities rotate responsibilities of hosting Canada Day celebrations. The partnership is called &quot;Del-Ko-Brydge&quot;. The celebrations, which has been held every year since 1981, feature a free pancake breakfast, morning parade, events and competitions throughout the day, a baseball game at night with fireworks following the game.

===Kilworth Heights===
Kilworth Heights takes up most of the area between Komoka and London which is south of County Road 14 (Glendon Rd) and north of Komoka Provincial Park and the Thames River. It is separate from Kilworth, which lies along Glendon Rd on the east side of the Thames River and is part of London.

Although Kilworth Heights is part of Middlesex Centre, demographically most of Kilworth Heights is a commuting exurb of Komoka. It has no independent industry, no schools, no major grocery store, no banks, and only two small commercial areas, including child care, veterinarian, restaurant, and a gas bar. All the rest of Kilworth Heights is single-unit residential. &quot;Old&quot; Kilworth Heights, to the east, still relies on individual wells and septic tanks. &quot;New&quot; Kilworth Heights, to the west, receives water and septic services from Komoka. Recent residential development in the western part of Kilworth Heights is responsible for much of Middlesex Centre&#x27;s population growth.

Middlesex Centre experiences severe weather annually. In 1990, the Komoka Community Church, which lies halfway between Komoka and Kilworth Heights, was destroyed down to the foundation by an F2 tornado.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Middlesex Centre had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>Amon of Judah was the fifteenth King of Judah who, according to the biblical account, succeeded his father Manasseh of Judah. Amon is most remembered for his idolatrous practices during his short two-year reign, which led to a revolt against him and eventually to his assassination in .

==Life==

Amon was the son of King Manasseh of Judah and Meshullemeth, a daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. Although the date is unknown, the Hebrew Bible records that he married Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. Following Manasseh&#x27;s death, Amon began his reign of Judah at the age of 22, and reigned for two years. Unlike many of his predecessors, who appear to have been made a co-regent at the age of 12, his reign does not allow for a period of co-regency, even though his father was at a very high age. This and the age of Manasseh at his birth (44) does suggest he may have been a younger son. 
The Jerusalem Bible describes Manasseh and Amon as &quot;two wicked kings&quot;. Biblical scholar and archeologist William F. Albright has dated his reign to 642–640, while professor E. R. Thiele offers the dates 643/642 – 641/640. Thiele&#x27;s dates are tied to the reign of Amon&#x27;s son Josiah, whose death at the hands of Pharaoh Necho II occurred in the summer of 609. The battle in which Josiah is said to have died, which is independently confirmed in Egyptian history, places the end of Amon&#x27;s reign, 31 years earlier, in 641 or 640 and the beginning of his rule in 643 or 642.

The Hebrew Bible records that Amon continued his father Manasseh&#x27;s practice of idolatry and set up pagan images as his father had done. II Kings states that Amon &quot;did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did Manasseh his father. And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them.&quot; Similarly, II Chronicles records that &quot;…he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.&quot; The Talmudic tradition recounts that &quot;Amon burnt the Torah, and allowed spider webs to cover the altar [through complete disuse] ... Amon sinned very much.&quot; Like other textual sources, Flavius Josephus too criticizes the reign of Amon, describing his reign in similar terms to the biblical accounts.

After reigning two years, Amon was assassinated by his servants or officials, who conspired against him, and he was succeeded by his son Josiah, who at the time was eight years old. After Amon&#x27;s assassination, his murderers became unpopular with the &quot;people of the land,&quot; and they were ultimately killed. It was the people of the land who proclaimed Josiah as his successor; it is not clear what succession would have been anticipated by the officials who assassinated Amon. Some scholars, such as Abraham Malamat, assert that Amon was assassinated because people disliked the heavy influence that Neo-Assyrian Empire, an age-old enemy of Judah responsible for the Assyrian destruction of the Kingdom of Israel, had upon him.

==Era==
Amon&#x27;s reign was in the midst of a transitional time for the Levant and the entire Mesopotamian region. To the east of the Kingdom of Judah, the Neo-Assyrian Empire was beginning to disintegrate while the Neo-Babylonian Empire had not yet risen to replace it. To the west, the Saïte Egypt was still recovering under pharaoh Psamtik I from the Assyrian occupation of 673-63, transforming from a vassal state to an autonomous ally. In this power vacuum, many smaller states such as Judah were able to govern themselves without foreign intervention from larger empires.

==Rabbinic literature==
The opinion that Amon was the most sinful of all the wicked kings of Judah (II Chron. xxxiii. 23) is brought out in the Talmud in tractate Sanhedrin 103b) as follows:
Ahaz suspended the sacrificial worship and sealed the Torah scrolls, Manasseh burned the names of the Lord and tore down the altar, Amon made it a place of desolation [covered it with cobwebs] and burned the Torah scrolls. This is derived from the story of the finding of the Book of the Law, II Kings, xxii. 8]; Ahaz permitted incest, Manasseh committed it with his sister, Amon committed it with his mother, saying to her, I only did this to anger the Creator. And yet, out of respect for his son Josiah, Amon&#x27;s name was not placed on the list of the kings excluded from the world to come. The sages also explain proverbs 24:30 as follows: I passed by the field of a lazy man, This is Ahaz. And the vineyard of a senseless man, this is Manashe. And behold, it was all overgrown with thorns, this is Amon. And its surface was covered with Nettle, this is Jehoiakim. And its stone wall was broken down, this is a reference to Zedekiah, in whose days the temple was destroyed. A midrashic fragment preserved in the &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot;, ii. 23, which appears to follow an account of the repentance of Manasseh according to a lost Jewish apocryphal writing, reads:

<text>Wild Dunes is an oceanfront resort on Isle of Palms, South Carolina, United States. It is on the north end of the island and has controlled-access gates.

==Information==
Wild Dunes was developed in 1972.

Wild Dunes has two famous golf courses on it: the Wild Dunes Links Course, and the Harbor Course, both designed by Tom Fazio. It also has a nationally ranked tennis complex with 17 clay courts, and an award-winning family recreation program.

In early 2008, large-scale beach erosion led to the depletion of the beachfront area of Wild Dunes. The beachfront was greatly reduced, waterfront buildings received structural damage, and the 18th hole of the Links Golf Course was washed out. After a lengthy process, at the end of the Summer of 2008 the City of Isle of Palms finished repairing the beach. Approximately of sand was pumped in from offshore, leading to the restoration of over 150 yards of beachfront. Also, the 18th hole of the Links Course has been repaired, but is now a Par 3 instead of the old Par 5. Wild Dunes worked with the golf course designer Tom Fazio to restore the course&#x27;s final hole to the Par 5 it used to be, a task that was completed in 2009.

<text>Max Mercury (Maxwell Crandall), also known as Windrunner, Whip Whirlwind, and Lightning, is a DC Comics superhero similar to Quality Comics&#x27; Quicksilver. Initially an obscure speedster, the character was rebooted by Mark Waid in 1993 in the pages of &quot;The Flash&quot; and turned into a mentor for Wally West and Bart Allen.

Max Mercury appears in the television series &quot;The Flash&quot;, portrayed by Trevor Carroll.

==Publication history==
===&quot;Quality Comics&quot;===
He first appeared in Quality&#x27;s &quot;National Comics&quot; #5, cover dated November 1940, as Quicksilver. Comics historian Don Markstein calls Quicksilver &quot;probably the first imitator of the Flash&#x27;s super-speed schtick&quot;.

Almost nothing was revealed about the character except that he possessed super-speed and had previously worked as a circus acrobat. In fact, after about a third of his feature&#x27;s run, his superhuman speed was downplayed, or phased out altogether. He appeared in &quot;National Comics&quot; until issue #73 (Aug 1949). He also made an appearance in &quot;Uncle Sam Quarterly&quot; (Winter 1941).

===&quot;DC Comics&quot;===
Due to the character&#x27;s indistinct background, decades later writer Mark Waid was free to reinvent the character in &quot;The Flash&quot; without contradicting anything. When the character reappeared in early 1990s issues of &quot;The Flash&quot;, his name had to be changed from &quot;Quicksilver&quot; to &quot;Mercury&quot; to avoid confusion with Marvel Comics&#x27; Quicksilver.

==Fictional character biography==
In Waid&#x27;s origin of the character, he was originally a scout with the US Cavalry in the 1830s. A friend of the local Indian tribes, he was shocked and dismayed to find them massacred on the orders of his commanding officer. Enchanted by a dying Indian shaman, he gained super-speed. In the years that followed, he became known to the Indians as &quot;Ahwehota&quot; (&quot;He Who Runs Beyond The Wind&quot;), and to everyone else as Windrunner.

Mercury has repeatedly traveled through time, seeking to enter the so-called Speed Force. He usually bounces off and finds himself decades in the future. His first attempt left him in the 1890s, where he created a new identity for himself as Whip Whirlwind. Later, he travelled ahead again, and was active in the 1930s and 1940s as Quicksilver when he acted as a mentor to the fledgling Golden Age Flash and Johnny Quick.

According to &quot;Jess Nevins&#x27; Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes&quot;, &quot;Quicksilver fights the Axis mesmerist Baron Hoff, the circus aerialists the Black Cats, the mad scientist Dr. Morlo, the Human Fly, the Screaming Skull, the Witch Doctor, and the Speed Demons, whose super-speed is derived from special pills&quot;.

In 1948, he had an affair with the wife of a doctor who had saved his life. When the doctor learned of this and his wife returned to her husband&#x27;s side, Max fled into the future once more. He then reappeared in the early 1960s, where he battled Savitar and was bounced still further forward in time. He spent some years in hiding, but was persuaded by Garrick to return to action against Professor Zoom (who was posing as Barry Allen). In recent years, he has been the mentor of first Wally West and later Bart Allen (alias Impulse). He taught West about the Speed Force, and helped him to access his full speed by encouraging him to break a mental block he had placed on his powers—stopping Wally from being as fast as Barry because he would then have &quot;really&quot; replaced his uncle as the Flash. He also attempted to teach Impulse a measure of patience with varying results. While living with Bart, Max met an aged physician named Helen Claiborne, who turned out to be his daughter from his earlier affair.

During &quot;Impulse&quot; #88 (September 2002, one of the last issues), Max&#x27;s body is possessed by the spirit of a Golden Age supervillain: the Rival. While still in Max&#x27;s body, the Rival then escapes to some unknown place in time.

In &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #4, Max appears in the Speed Force, where his spirit was imprisoned after the Rival escaped from the very same peril by possessing Max&#x27;s body. Max assists Johnny Quick, Bart Allen and other speedsters in taking the murderous Superboy-Prime to another realm far past the Speed Force.

In &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot; #4, Max has recently been brought back, as Barry Allen helps take him out of the &quot;Negative Speed Force&quot; controlled by Professor Zoom. Since this follows the possible continuity changes of the &quot;Crisis Trilogy&quot;, it is unclear whether the Rival is still in possession of Mercury&#x27;s original body.

==Powers and abilities==
Max is a human granted superhuman speed by ancient Native American rituals. His speed is enough that he can accelerate well beyond the standard Mach 1 super-speed limit, or the speed of sound; though he cannot reach escape velocity. Over time, he tried to find the fuel for his powers (and those of other speedsters): the Speed Force. Though he never quite entered it nor obtained its energies to power his speed, his attempts allowed him to travel forward through time.

Among his peers, Max is unique in his attempts to understand the Speed Force in a mystical way (referred to by other characters as &quot;Zen&quot;). He also differs from other speedsters because of his agility; he cannot run as quickly as the Flashes, but he has a greater ability to perform acrobatic stunts and finely coordinated actions than they do. Thus, he was even able to outmaneuver Professor Zoom during their initial fight, although Zoom still gained the advantage by threatening innocent people.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Flashpoint&quot;===
In the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; reality, Windrunner is in the 18th century when he was approached by Kid Flash (who was being controlled by the Speed Force) and then reduces Windrunner&#x27;s speed killing him to give the Flash power to stop the near-past Flash himself.

==In other media==
* Max Mercury appears in &quot;The Flash&quot; episode &quot;A New World&quot; Pt. 4, portrayed by Trevor Carroll. This version was chosen by the Flash to become a speedster.
* Two Max Mercury figures were released as a part of HeroClix&#x27;s &quot;The Flash&quot; set.
* DC Direct released a six-inch figure of Max Mercury in 2000.

<text>Giaginsky District (; ) is an administrative and a municipal district (raion), one of the seven in the Republic of Adygea, Russia. It is located in the northern central portion of the republic and borders with Shovgenovsky District in the north, Koshekhablsky District in the east and northeast, Mostovsky District of Krasnodar Krai in the southeast, Maykopsky District in the south, and with Belorechensky District of Krasnodar Krai in the west. The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the rural locality (a &quot;stanitsa&quot;) of Giaginskaya. As of the 2010 Census, the total population of the district was 31,766, with the population of Giaginskaya accounting for 44.5% of that number.

==History==
Giaginsky District was established within Azov-Black Sea Krai on December 31, 1934 as a result of the downsizing of that krai&#x27;s districts. On April 10, 1936, Khansky Selsoviet of Maykopsky District of the krai was merged into Giaginsky District and the latter, along with the city of Maykop, was transferred to Adyghe Autonomous Oblast. On February 1, 1963, Maykopsky District of Adyghe Autonomous Oblast was merged into Giaginsky District to create Giaginsky Rural District (). However, as the new system of rural districts did not prove to be efficient, Giaginsky District was re-instated in its pre-1963 borders on January 12, 1965.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Giaginsky District is one of the seven in the Republic of Adygea and has administrative jurisdiction over all of its thirty rural localities. As a municipal division, the district is incorporated as Giaginsky Municipal District. Its thirty rural localities are incorporated into five rural settlements within the municipal district. The &quot;stanitsa&quot; of Giaginskaya serves as the administrative center of both the administrative and municipal district.

<text>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin (; born 18 September 1953) is an Irish former Sinn Féin politician who served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Cavan–Monaghan constituency from 1997 to 2020. Ó Caoláin&#x27;s victory in 1997 made him the first member of Sinn Féin to be elected to the Dáil since 1957, and the first to actually take their seat since 1922. His election, which paralleled the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, is cited as the beginning of Sinn Féin&#x27;s involvement in the formal national politics of the Republic of Ireland.

Ó Caoláin served as Leader of Sinn Féin in Dáil Éireann from 1997 to 2011 and Chair of the Committee on Justice and Equality from 2016 to 2020.

==Biography==
Ó Caoláin was born in Monaghan in 1953. He was educated at St. Mary&#x27;s CBS, Monaghan. He was a bank official with the Bank of Ireland in the 1970s, and worked in a number of towns, including Ballinasloe. He became a senior bank official but then left the bank to concentrate on politics. Ó Caoláin is married to Briege McGinn and they have four daughters and one son.

Ó Caoláin underwent successful cardiac surgery early in 2007. On 19 June 2007, it was reported that he was rushed to hospital, but he was released shortly thereafter and has since made a full recovery.

==Political career==
Ó Caoláin has been active in republican circles since the 1970s. He was Director of Elections in the Anti H-Block campaign of 1981, which saw Kieran Doherty elected as a TD for the Cavan–Monaghan constituency. Between 1982 and 1985, he was general manager of the republican newspaper &quot;An Phoblacht&quot;. Ó Caoláin&#x27;s first political success came in 1985, when he was elected to Monaghan County Council as a Sinn Féin County Councillor. At the 1984 and 1989 European Parliament elections he stood unsuccessfully in the Connacht–Ulster constituency.

Ó Caoláin was a Sinn Féin delegate at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in Dublin in the mid-1990s. In 1996, he was an unsuccessful candidate in the Northern Ireland Forum election in Newry and Armagh. He was also a member of the Sinn Féin negotiations team during the talks which led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Following the 1997 general election, he was elected to Dáil Éireann for the Cavan–Monaghan constituency, making him the first Sinn Féin TD elected since 1957, and the first Sinn Féin TD to take his seat at Dáil Éireann in Leinster House since 1922. He was subsequently re-elected at the 2002 general election and was joined by four other Sinn Féin deputies. He was re-elected at the 2007 general election, 2011 general election and 2016 general election. Ó Caoláin served as Sinn Féin&#x27;s Spokesperson on Health and Children. While a TD, he accepted the average industrial wage and donated the remaining portion of his TD salary to his party.

On 7 March 2018, Ó Caoláin announced that he would not contest the next general election.

Since his retirement Ó Caoláin has remained involved in Sinn Féin. He was their Director of Elections in his former constituency in 2024.

<text>Anton Friedrich Justus Thibaut (4 January 177220 March 1840), was a German jurist and musician.

==Early life==

He was born at Hamelin, in Hanover, the son of an officer in the Hanoverian Army, of French Huguenot descent. After school in Hameln and Hanover, Thibaut entered the University of Göttingen as a student of jurisprudence, went from there to Königsberg, where he studied under Immanuel Kant, and afterwards to the University of Kiel, where he was a fellow-student with Niebuhr. Here, after taking his degree of doctor of laws, he became a &quot;Privat-dozent&quot;. His younger brother was Bernhard Friedrich Thibaut, a mathematician.

==Jurist==
=== Early career ===

In 1798 he was appointed extraordinary professor of civil law, and in the same year appeared his &quot;Versuche über einzelne Theile der Theorie des Rechts&quot; (1798), a collection of essays on the theory of law, of which by far the most important was entitled &quot;Über den Einfluss der Philosophie auf die Auslegung der positiven Gesetze&quot;, wherein he sought to show that history without philosophy could not interpret and explain law. In 1799, he published his &quot;Theorie der logischen Auslegung des römischen Rechts&quot;, one of his major works. In 1802 he published a short criticism of Feuerbach&#x27;s theory of criminal law, which recalls in many ways the speculations of Jeremy Bentham. The same year appeared &quot;Über Besitz und Verjahrung&quot;, a treatise on the law of possession and the limitation of actions.

In 1802 Thibaut was called to Jena, where he spent three years and wrote, in Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s summer-house, his chief work, &quot;System des Pandektenrechts&quot; (1803), which ran into many editions. The fame of this book results from its being the first modern complete compendium of the subject, distinguished alike by the accuracy of its sources and the freedom and unpedantic manner in which the subject is handled. It is, in effect, a codification of the Roman law as it then obtained in Germany, modified by canon law and the practice of the courts into a comprehensive system of Pandect law. At the invitation of the grand-duke of Baden, Thibaut went to Heidelberg to fill the chair of civil law and to assist in organizing the university; and he never left the town, though in later years, as his fame grew, he was offered places at Göttingen, Munich and Leipzig. His class was large, his influence great; and, except Gustav Hugo and Savigny, no civilian of his time was so well known.

=== Civil law essay ===
In 1814 appeared his &quot;Civilistische Abhandlungen&quot; (&quot;Treatises on Civil Law&quot;), of which the principal was his famous essay, the parent of so much literature, &quot;Über die Nothwendigkeit eines allgemeinen bürgerlichen Rechts für Deutschland&quot; (&quot;On the Necessity of a General Civil Law for Germany&quot;). It was inspired by the enthusiasm of the so-called German Wars of Liberation against Napoleon (1813–1814) and written in fourteen days. Thibaut himself explained in the &quot;Archiv für die civilistische Praxis&quot;, in 1838, the origin of this memorable essay. He had realized the change denoted by the march of German soldiers to Paris in 1814, and the happy future opened up for Germany. The system of small states he hoped and believed would continue; for the big state he considered crushing to the life of the individual and harmful as concentrating the &quot;warm life&quot; of the nation in one central point. In his judgment the only unity practicable and needful for Germany was that of law; and for this he urged all the German governments to labour. The essay was as much a condemnation of the entire state of jurisprudence as an argument for codification; it was a challenge to civilians to justify their very existence. Savigny took up the challenge thus thrown down when he wrote &quot;Über den Beruf unserer Zeit für Gesetzgebung und Rechtswissenschaft&quot; (1814); and a long controversy as to points not very clearly defined took place. The glory of the controversy belonged to Savigny; the real victory rested with Thibaut.

=== Later life ===
In 1819 he was appointed to the upper house of the newly constituted Baden parliament. He was also made member of the &quot;Scheidungsgericht&quot; (divorce court). In 1836 Thibaut published his &quot;Erorterungen des römischen Rechts&quot;. One of his last works was a contribution in 1838 to the &quot;Archiv für die civilistische Praxis&quot;, of which he was one of the editors (see below). Thibaut married, in 1800, a daughter of Professor Ahlers of Kiel. He died after a short illness, at Heidelberg.

==Legacy==

Thibaut, a man of strong personality, was much more than a jurist: he has a place in the history of music. Palestrina and the early composers of church music were his delight; and in 1824 he published, anonymously, &quot;Über die Reinheit der Tonkunst&quot; (Purity of Music), in which he eulogized the old music, especially that of Palestrina. He was an ardent collector of old compositions, and often sent young men to Italy, at his own expense, to discover interesting musical manuscripts. Among the masters of German prose, too, Thibaut has a place. His style, though simple, is richly expressive.

The framers of the new German civil code (&quot;Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch&quot;) in 1879 owed the arrangement of their matter in no small degree to Thibaut&#x27;s method and clear classification, but beyond this, the code, based on the civil law of the several German states, which was adroitly blended by the &quot;usus pandectarum&quot; into an harmonious whole, does not reflect his influence. He was one of the earliest to criticize the divisions found in the Institutes, and he carried on with Gustav Hugo a controversy as to these points.

Thibaut&#x27;s legal work was soon superseded by that of his successor, Karl Adolf von Vangerow (1805–1870), and his textbooks fell out of use. John Austin, who owed much to him, describes him as one &quot;who for penetrating acuteness, rectitude of judgment and depth of learning and eloquence of exposition, may be placed by the side of Friedrich Carl von Savigny, at the head of all living civilians.&quot;

<text>The House of Zrinski or Zrínyi was a Croatian-Hungarian noble family, a cadet branch of the Croatian noble tribe of Šubić, influential during the period in history marked by the Ottoman wars in Europe in the Kingdom of Croatia&#x27;s union with the Kingdom of Hungary and in the later Kingdom of Croatia as a part of the Habsburg monarchy. Notable members of this family were Bans of Croatia, considered national heroes in both Croatia and Hungary, and were particularly celebrated during the period of Romanticism, a movement which was called &quot;Zrinijada&quot; in Croatia.

The Zrinski (), meaning &quot;those of Zrin&quot;, are a branch of the Šubić family, which arose when king Louis I of Hungary needed some of the Šubićs&#x27; fortresses for his coming wars against Venice, and the city of Zadar in particular. In 1347, King Louis I took their estates around Bribir, most importantly the strategic fortress at Ostrovica, in Dalmatia, and gave them the Zrin estate with Zrin Castle, located south of the modern city of Petrinja and west of Hrvatska Kostajnica, in what was then Slavonia and is today the Croatian region of Banovina. Following the move, the family came to be known as known as the &quot;Counts of Zrin&quot; as the name changed from &quot;de Breberio&quot; to &quot;Zrinski&quot; (of Zrin) with variants of Zrinio, Zrini, de Serin, Sdrin, and von Serinus. Later, their power steadily increased, so that they acquired the territory between the rivers Krka and Zrmanja and the sea by the 13th century. At the outset of the 14th century, Paul I Šubić of Bribir was the longest-ruling Ban of Croatia (1275–1312), as well as lord of all of Bosnia (1305–1312). His son was Paul II Šubić of Bribir.

Paul I&#x27;s grandson was the first Zrinski, Juraj III. Šubić of Bribir, who, after the move to Zrin, took the title Juraj I. Zrinski hr]. His cousin, countess Jelena Šubić, was at the same time married to Vladislav Kotromanić. Their first-born child, Tvrtko I, became the Ban of Bosnia and from 1377 the King of Bosnia. Their niece and adopted daughter, Elizabeta Kotromanić (Elisabeth of Bosnia), married Louis I the Great. Elizabeth&#x27;s and Louis&#x27; daughters succeeded their father and became queens in their own right, as Mary of Hungary and Jadwiga of Poland.
The Zrinskis were Croats and played a crucial role in the history of the Croatian state, both before their arrival in Zrin and later. On the other hand, they are also identified as &quot;hungarus&quot; or &quot;natio hungarica&quot;, which means &quot;somebody from the Kingdom of Hungary&quot;, regardless of the language spoken and nationality. They were among many noble families in the Kingdom of Hungary. 

In 1547, as the Ottoman threat to lands in the vicinity of Zrin grew, King Ferdinand I gave to Ban Nikola IV Zrinski lands in Međimurje County, in the northernmost part of Croatia, with its capital Čakovec, which the members of the family held for the next 145 years (1546-1691). Following the move, the family kept the name Zrinski. Because they lived, worked, and intermarried with nobility from all parts of the multiethnic kingdom, it was natural and expected that they should be fluent in four or five languages. It is certain, that Nikola Zrinski spoke at least Croatian, Hungarian, Italian, Turkish, and of course Latin. It is of interest that he was the most prominent Hungarian poet in the 17th century, while his brother Peter is known for his poems in Croatian.

Among the many notable personalities of the family, there were a few women. Katarina Zrinska (1625–1673), a noted poet, was born in the Frankopan family, and, having married Petar Zrinski, became the member of the Zrinski family. Her daughter, Jelena Zrinska, was the wife of Francis I Rákóczi, the prince of Transylvania.

The Zrinski and the Frankopan families were the two most prominent noble families in Croatia in 16th and 17th century and they both perished in 1671 when Petar Zrinski and Fran Krsto Frankopan were charged with treason by the Emperor Leopold I, owing it to their role in the so-called Zrinski-Frankopan Plot (in Hungarian historiography called the Wesselényi Plot), and executed in Wiener Neustadt. The estates of Zrinski and Frankopan families were confiscated and their surviving members relocated.

The remains of Petar Zrinski and Fran Krsto Frankopan were transferred from Austria to Croatia in 1919 and buried in the Zagreb Cathedral.

The last male Zrinski descendants were Adam Zrinski (1662–1691), son of Nikola Zrinski, a Habsburg Monarchy army lieutenant-colonel. He inherited from his father the large and valuable &quot;Bibliotheca Zriniana&quot;. He died in the Battle of Slankamen in 1691, accidentally shot in his back by one of his fellow soldiers. Ivan Antun Zrinski (1654–1703), son of Petar Zrinski and Katarina Zrinska, was Habsburg army officer, who was accused of high treason and died after years in dungeons.

===Family&#x27;s survival===
Although was generally considered that the family became extinct, it still remains a matter of debate. According to oral tradition, there was a Zrinski member, Martin Zrinski (1462–1508), who was hidden by the Habsburgs in a Venetian army as an officer of the cavalry in the 16th century and the Venetian Republic sent him as Martino Zdrin (or Sdrigna) to the island of Cephalonia in Greece where he eventually settled, and the family was recorded in the gold book of island&#x27;s nobility as Sdrin, Sdrinia, Sdrigna, and Zrin. The family Sdrinias, with almost the same coat of arms as the Zrinski family, still exists in Greece and was accepted in the Croatian Nobility Association with the highest noble status. The survival is supported by seven letters (two written by Maria Sdrin) and photographs from Greece signed by &quot;Contessa &amp; Conte K. Sdrin&quot; and &quot;Conte Gerasimo N. Sdrini&quot;, and on behind &quot;Suvenire S. N. Sdriny Marsullela 7/20/6 1913. Madame Evangelini Tsimara Mavrata Ceffalonia&quot;.

===Bans===
The family produced four Bans of Croatia (viceroys):
* Nikola IV Zrinski (; 1508–1566), ban from 1542 until 1556
* Juraj V Zrinski (; 1599–1626), ban from 1622 until 1626

<text>Sport, known by its full name as &quot;Hockey Team Vaasan Sport OY&quot; or simply &quot;Vaasan Sport&quot;, is a Finnish ice hockey team playing in Liiga, and is based at the 5,200-capacity Vaasa Arena in Vaasa. The team was established in 1939 as IF Sport (Idrottsföreningen Sport).

==History==
Vaasan Sport was founded in 1939 as IF Sport. The team was involved in the founding of the Finnish top division Liiga, formerly known as SM-Liiga, in 1975, but was relegated only one year later after the 1975–1976 season.

After the relegation, Sport played in the Finnish First Division (since then renamed to Mestis), until they were relegated in 1991–1992 to the Finnish Second Division. Climbing back up to the First division proved to be a tough task and wasn&#x27;t accomplished until spring 1997, with the game-winning goal of the deciding game against Kiekko-67 being scored by Kari Teräväinen in overtime.

The 2008–09 season was a success as Sport won the Mestis championship. However, in the league qualification series the team lost the last game to Ässät in a best-of-7 format, thus remaining in Mestis. The overall qualification series were close as Sport at one point was a single goal away from beating Ässät in overtime and being promoted to Liiga, but was unable to score.

Sport struggled with bad economy during the 2000s, which almost led the club to bankruptcy. The club board made improvements to secure the future of the club, cutting down on the budget for the whole new season, as well as installing new head coach and former world ice hockey champion Antti Törmänen, who started to build a new young team from scratch. Eventually, the club surfaced from its financial struggles and went ahead to consistently fight for the championship victory again.

In 2014, during the 2013–2014 Mestis season, it was confirmed that Sport would be promoted to Liiga for the 2014–2015 season, regardless of the outcome of the ongoing championship. This was due to former Liiga team Jokerit transferring to KHL, leaving an open slot in the Finnish top division.

The official fan club is called Red Army. The fan club Ultras 06 function as non-official supporters.

<text>Chaminade University of Honolulu is a private Marianist university in Honolulu, Hawaii. Founded in 1955 by the Society of Mary, Chaminade is located in Kaimuki, Honolulu at the base of St. Louis Heights. Chaminade offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in 23 fields of study and 5 master&#x27;s degree programs. Chaminade University is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission.

==History==
Chaminade University of Honolulu was named after Father William Joseph Chaminade, a French Catholic priest who survived persecution during the French Revolution. He founded the Society of Mary in 1817. In 1849, Marianists sent missionaries to the United States to serve immigrant populations. In September 1883, eight Marianist priests arrived in Honolulu and established Saint Louis School, today a middle and high school for boys. With the encouragement of Saint Louis alumni, the Marianists established a university to serve the educational needs of local Hawai&#x27;i Catholics. They opened Saint Louis Junior College in 1955. Upon becoming a four-year institution, the school changed its name to Chaminade College in 1957. When graduate programs were added in 1977, Chaminade College changed its name to Chaminade University of Honolulu.

===Marianist traditions===
The Society of Mary (Marianists) is a religious order of brothers and priests following in the vision of Father William Joseph Chaminade, the founder of the Society of Mary. Since Father Chaminade believed schools were instrumental in changing society, Marianist schools today focus on the education of the whole person, realizing the importance of both faith and reason, and preparing students for entry into their chosen careers. Chaminade&#x27;s approach to education is founded in the Marianist education values:

# Educate for formation in faith
# Provide an excellent education
# Educate in family spirit
# Educate for service, justice and peace
# Educate for adaptation to change

==Campus==
Chaminade&#x27;s main campus, serving the undergraduate program and graduate program, is at the base of St. Louis Heights, a residential division of the Kaimuki district. Chaminade is approximately two miles outside Waikiki and four miles from Downtown Honolulu.

After receiving a large grant in 2003, the campus underwent extensive renovation and construction. This included the construction of the Sullivan Family Library, and the Dr. Lawrence K.W. and Mrs. BoHing Chan Tseu Center for Nursing Education.

Chaminade&#x27;s accelerated evening and online program (Adult Evening and Online Program) offers evening courses for nine degree programs at satellite locations on local military bases, community colleges and community centers.

==Academics==
Chaminade has 5 schools: Natural Sciences and Mathematics; Business and Communication; Humanities, Arts, and Design; Education and Behavioral Science; and Nursing. Across the schools, there are 25 day undergraduate majors, 36 minors, 14 certificates, 6 associate degrees, 19 online degrees, 6 master degrees, and 5 doctoral degrees.

The Adult Evening and Online Program (AEOP) offers accelerated courses for non-traditional students who wish to take classes in the evening and online.

Chaminade University of Honolulu Montessori Teacher Education Program is accredited by Montessori Accreditation Council for Teacher Education (MACTE) and affiliated with American Montessori Society (AMS).

==Athletics==

Chaminade University of Honolulu competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division II as a member of the Pacific West Conference, a nine-member athletic conference with members located in California, Hawaii, and Utah. Chaminade University fields teams in baseball, basketball, cross country, golf for men, softball, tennis, and volleyball for women. In the fall of 2006 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer were added for the first time as well as women&#x27;s basketball. Chaminade University of Honolulu&#x27;s team name is the &quot;Silverswords,&quot; a reference to a Hawaiian plant prized for its beauty and ability to withstand harsh conditions.

Chaminade also hosts the annual Maui Invitational basketball tournament.

<text>Kalevan Pallo (KalPa) is a professional ice hockey team which competes in the Finnish Liiga. They play in Kuopio, Finland at the Olvi Areena.

==Team history==
Established in 1929 as &quot;Sortavalan Palloseura&quot; in Sortavala, the club relocated to Kuopio in 1945 after its original hometown had been annexed by the Soviet Union. During its Sortavala years, the club was not active in ice hockey, but competed in association football, bandy, and pesäpallo instead. Ice hockey was introduced in 1947, and in 1956 KalPa officially replaced the more traditional Kuopio club KuPS in that sport thus specializing in hockey – minor league football was still continued until 1974 as a farm team of sorts for KuPS.

The full name of the company that runs the representative team today is &quot;KalPa Hockey Oy&quot;. The majority of the company is owned by former NHL players Sami Kapanen and Kimmo Timonen. Kapanen is the majority owner, controlling 50.5% of the franchise. Timonen owns 8%, while Timonen&#x27;s former teammate Scott Hartnell owns 5%. Hartnell purchased a minority share of the team after getting financial advice from Kimmo Timonen during a road trip to Boston.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Timonen, Kapanen, and fellow NHL player Adam Hall were playing for KalPa. After winning the Mestis championship, KalPa returned to SM-liiga for the 2005–06 season, after being relegated six years earlier in 1999.

KalPa has won three medals: silvers in the 1990–91 and 2016–17 seasons and a bronze in the 2008–09 season. KalPa has also won the Spengler Cup, in year 2018.

<doc id="731056" wikidata="Q335637" url="?curid=731056" title="Abu al-Qasim Khoei">
<text>Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Abu al-Qasim Musawi Khoei ( ; (; ; November 19, 1899 – August 8, 1992) was an Iranian Shia marja&#x27;. Khoei is considered one of the most influential twelver scholars. 

After the death of Muhsin al-Hakim in 1970, he became the spiritual leader of much of the Shia world until his death in 1992. He was succeeded briefly by Abd al-A&#x27;la Sabziwari, until his death in 1993. Then his former student, Ali Sistani, took leadership of the seminary, whereby many of his followers became followers of Sistani.

==Biography==
Khoei was born to a sayyid family in the northern Iranian city of Khoy in 1899. Khoei grew up in Qajar Iran. Around the age of 13, he moved to Iraq along with his older brother Abdullah and took up residence in the holy city of Najaf where he began studying Shia theology with the scholars of that city. He eventually attained the rank of Ayatollah and was made a marja. Khoei continued to live in Najaf, becoming a teacher for the remainder of his life, and overseeing the studies of scholars who would be qualified to issue fatwas based on Shia theology.

Due to his prominent position as a teacher and scholar in Najaf, he became an important leader of worldwide Shias. He was made the most prominent Grand Ayatollah in 1971 after the death of Muhsin al-Hakim. In this position, he became a patron of numerous institutions across the globe that sought to provide welfare, and also provided scholarships to theological students from across the Muslim world.

He is considered as the architect of a distinct school of thought in the principles of jurisprudence and Islamic law, and one of the leading exponents of &quot;kalam&quot; (scholastic theology) and &quot;rijal&quot; (study of the biographies of transmitters of ahadith, the prophetic traditions), &quot;fiqh&quot; (jurisprudence), and &quot;tafseer&quot; (exegesis of the Qur&#x27;an). His interests included astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy.

Khoei&#x27;s status as the pre-eminent scholar of his age did not go unchallenged. In the 1970s, Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Shirazi, a radical theologian based in Karbala had a long-running feud with Al Khoei and his fellow clerics in Najaf over the legitimacy of theocratic rule. The dispute resulted in Khoei seeking to dismiss Al Shirazi&#x27;s status as a religious scholar.

After the Persian Gulf War, Khoei was arrested by Saddam Hussein during the mass Shia uprising that followed the defeat of Iraqi forces. While under arrest, he was taken to Baghdad and forced to make public appearances with Saddam Hussein. Hussein eventually allowed Khoei to return to Najaf, but he was placed under house arrest. Khoei died on 8 August 1992 in Najaf, at the age of 92. His funeral was led by his student Ali Sistani. He was buried in the Shrine of Imam Ali in Najaf.

==Legacy==
===Welfare===

He was fervently dedicated to establishing welfare, social, cultural, and educational institutions for Muslims worldwide. The following are some of the institutions he established:

* Imam Khoei Benevolent Foundation in Queens, NY.
*al-Iman School in Queens, New York.
* As-Sadiq and Az-Zahra Schools in London.
* Imam Khoei Islamic Centre in London, U.K

He was also the patron of about 1,000 grant-maintained students of theology from Iraq and other countries like Lebanon, Iran, Syria, Persian Gulf States, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, South East Asia. He provided financial support for maintaining the schools including boarding expenses, teachers&#x27; salaries, and lodging costs.

===Students===

Former student Ali Sistani is currently the most senior Shia cleric in Iraq and widely regarded as &quot;wield[ing] enormous power over Iraq&#x27;s Shia majority.&quot; The degree of success of his articulation of moderate Shia politics in Iraq have been said to be &quot;in no small part traceable to the legacy of his mentor and teacher&quot;, Khoei.

Another significant student of Khoei, is Muhammad-Sadiq Rohani, who also shared a close relationship with Khoei. He was considered a high religious authorities in Iran, alongside Waheed Khurasani.

===Works===
Khoei wrote about various topics, ranging from Islamic jurisprudence to mathematics and astronomy and was a prolific writer in these disciplines. He wrote 37 books and treatises, most of which have been published. His works include:

* &quot;Lectures in the Principles of Jurisprudence&quot; – 10 volumes
* &quot;Biographies of Narrators of Tradition&quot; – 24 volumes
* &quot;Islamic Law&quot; – 18 volumes
* &quot;Al-Bayan Fi Tafsir al-Quran&quot; (&quot;The Elucidation of the Exegesis of The Qur&#x27;an&quot; and sometimes entitled &quot;The Prolegomena to the Quran&quot;)
* &quot;Minhaju-us-Saliheen&quot; (&quot;The Path of the Righteous&quot;) – 2 volumes, reprinted 78 times (guide book on religious practice and law)
* &quot;Anthology of Religious Questions&quot; – Concise version of the &quot;Path of the Righteous&quot; – in Arabic, Urdu, Persian, English, Turkish, Thai, Malay, Indonesian, and Gujarati
* &quot;Mabani al-Istinbat&quot; (&quot;Edifices of Deduction&quot;) Principles of Jurisprudence
* &quot;Ajwad-at-Taqrirat&quot; (&quot;The Best of Regulations&quot;) Principles of Jurisprudence

===Political impact===
Khoei was an &quot;old rival&quot; of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini from when the two lived in Najaf, and dismissed Khomeini&#x27;s theory that Velayat-e faqih—i.e., a ruling jurist should be the basis of Islamic Government—as a &quot;bogus innovation&quot; in Islam according to scholar Vali Nasr. Nasr argues that Khoei&#x27;s importance in limiting the reach of Khomeini&#x27;s ideas &quot;is often underrated and unrecognized&quot;.

Although enthusiasm was passionate in the Shi&#x27;i world for the Iranian Revolution in its early years, Khoei &quot;openly urged followers to ignore&quot; Khomeini and &quot;kept alive&quot; the tradition of Shia thought &quot;that accords more leeway to the idea of distinguishing between religious and political authority&quot; then and &quot;did so&quot; until enthusiasm for Islamist rule had lost much of its &quot;allure&quot; among Shia worldwide. He should also be given much of the credit for whatever influence &quot;moderate Shia politics&quot; has had in Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein through his mentee and student Ali Sistani who became the leading marjaʿ in Iraq after Khoei&#x27;s death.

==Personal life==

Khoei was married and had seven sons:

* Jamal al-Din. He was Khoei&#x27;s eldest son and spent his life in the service of his father&#x27;s marja&#x27;iya. He died in Tehran after being diagnosed with cancer, in 1984. He was buried in the Fatimah Masumah shrine in Qom. His notable works are: &quot;Sharh Kifayat al-Usul&quot;, &quot;Bahth Fi al-Falsafa Wa Ilm al-Kalam&quot;, &quot;Sharh Diwan al-Mutanabi&quot;.
* Ali. He was killed young in a car accident between Baghdad and Najaf.
* Abbas. Born in Najaf, moved to Baghdād to find work at the age of 12. Learning his craft and eventually becoming a successful businessman owning five shops in Baghdād. Abbas was a forward thinker who spoke 7 languages fluently (English, Arabic, Farsi, Turkish, Urdu, Azeri, Hindi) regularly travelled to the far east importing a variety of goods to Iraq for sale. After finding entrepreneurial success, Abbas provided financial backing to his entire family taking them out of poverty. This was fundamental in allowing his father Khoei to study full time and publish his works. Abbas moved to London in 1978. Whilst in London Abbas served the Middle Eastern community, including sending his own children to interpret for sick patients at Kings College Hospital. Abbas passed away in July 2021 in Najaf at the age of 91.
* Abd al-Sahib. Current secretary general of the Imam Khoei Foundation in London.
* Muhammad-Taqi. He was the secretary general of the Foundation in 1989. He was placed under house arrest with his father after the 1991 Shaban uprising. Muhammad-Taqi was allegedly assassinated by Saddam Hussein, who set up a car accident, on the night of 21 July 1994. Besides reports of his father&#x27;s lectures, he has authored &quot;Kitab al-Iltizamat al-Taba&#x27;iya Fi al-Uqud&quot;.
* Abd al-Majid. He emigrated from Iraq soon after the Shaban uprising and left for London. He became the secretary-general of the Foundation after his brother, Muhammad-Taqi&#x27;s death. Soon after the fall of Baghdad to US forces in 2003, he returned to Iraq with plans to revive Najaf to the glory and splendour it enjoyed under the patronage of his father. However, he was assassinated on April 10, 2003, near the Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf.
* Ibrahim. He was abducted from his house by the Baathist regime after the Shaban uprising, in 1991.

<doc id="731073" wikidata="Q2116681" url="?curid=731073" title="Bradford City stadium fire">
<text>The Bradford City stadium fire occurred during a Football League Third Division match on Saturday, 11 May 1985 at the Valley Parade stadium in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, killing 56 spectators and injuring at least 265. The stadium was known for its antiquated design and facilities, which included the wooden roof of the main stand. Previous warnings had also been given about a major build-up of litter in the cavity below the seats in the stand. The stand had been officially condemned and was due to be replaced with a steel structure after the season ended.

The match between Bradford City and Lincoln City, the final game of that season, had started in a celebratory atmosphere with the home team receiving the Third Division championship trophy. At 3:40 pm, television commentator John Helm remarked upon a small fire in the main stand; in less than four minutes, with the windy conditions, the fire had engulfed the whole stand, trapping some people in their seats. In the panic that ensued, fleeing crowds escaped on to the pitch but others at the back of the stand tried to break down locked exit doors to escape. Many were burnt to death at the turnstile gates, which had also been locked after the match had begun. There were many cases of heroism, with more than 50 people later receiving police awards or commendations for bravery.

The disaster led to rigid new safety standards in UK stadiums, including the banning of new wooden grandstands. It was also a catalyst for the substantial redevelopment and modernisation of many British football grounds within the following thirty years. Bradford City continues to support the Bradford Burns Unit, at the University of Bradford, as its official charity.

==Background==
Valley Parade in Bradford, West Yorkshire, was built in 1886 and was initially the home ground of Manningham Rugby Football Club. Since 1903, when the club was formed, Bradford City Association Football Club had played their home games at the ground. The playing area and stands were very basic but the ground had enough room for 18,000 spectators. When the association football club was formed, the ground was changed very little and had no covered accommodation. However, when Bradford City won promotion to the highest level of English football, Division One, in 1908, club officials sanctioned an upgrade programme. Football architect Archibald Leitch was commissioned to carry out the work. By 1911, his work was completed. It included a main stand which seated 5,300 fans, and had room for a further 7,000 standing spectators in the paddock in front. The main stand was described as a &quot;mammoth structure&quot;, but was unusual for its time because of its place on the side of a hill. The entrances to the stand were all at the rear and were higher than the rest of the ground.

Although there had been some changes to other parts of the ground, the main stand remained unaltered by 1985. Football ground writer Simon Inglis had described the view from the stand as &quot;like watching football from the cockpit of a Sopwith Camel&quot; because of its antiquated supports and struts. However, he also warned the club of a build-up of litter beneath the stand because of a gap between the seats. Some repair work was carried out, but in July 1984 the club was warned again, this time by a county council engineer, because of the club&#x27;s plans to claim for ground improvements from the Football Trust. One letter from the council said the problems &quot;should be rectified as soon as possible&quot;; a second said: &quot;A carelessly discarded cigarette could give rise to a fire risk.&quot; In March 1985, the club&#x27;s plans became more apparent when it took delivery of steel for a new roof.
The 1984–85 season had been one of Bradford City&#x27;s most successful seasons, ending with City clinching the championship title courtesy of a 2–0 victory against Bolton Wanderers in the penultimate game of the season. As a result, Bradford-born captain Peter Jackson was presented with the league trophy before the final game of the season with mid-table Lincoln City at Valley Parade on 11 May 1985. As it was the first piece of league silverware that the club had captured since they won the Division Three (North) title 56 years earlier, 11,076 supporters were in the ground. It was nearly double the season&#x27;s average of 6,610 and included 3,000 fans in the ground&#x27;s main stand. In the crowd were local dignitaries and guests from three of Bradford&#x27;s twin towns—Verviers in Belgium, and Mönchengladbach and Hamm in West Germany.

Bradford&#x27;s &quot;Telegraph &amp; Argus&quot; newspaper published a souvenir issue for 11 May, entitled, &quot;Spit and Polish for the Parade Ground&quot;. It detailed the safety work which would be carried out at Valley Parade as a result of the club&#x27;s promotion, admitting the ground was &quot;inadequate in so many ways for modern requirements&quot;. Steel was to be installed in the roof, and the wooden terracing was to be replaced with concrete. The work was expected to cost £400,000 (£million today).

The match kicked off at 3:04 pm and after forty minutes of the first half, the score remained 0–0, in what was described as a drab affair with neither team threatening to score.

At 3:44 pm, five minutes before half-time, the first sign of a firea glowing lightwas noticed three rows from the back of block G, as reported by television commentator John Helm. Helm later described the start of the fire in an interview to the &quot;Express&quot; newspaper: 

One witness saw paper or debris on fire, about below the floor boards. The stand seats did not have risers; this had allowed a large accumulation of rubbish and paper waste in the cavity space under the stand, which had not been cleared for many months. Spectators later spoke of initially feeling their feet becoming warmer; one of them ran to the back of the stand for a fire extinguisher but found none. A police officer shouted to a colleague for an extinguisher, but his call was misheard and instead the fire brigade were radioed. The call was timed at 3:43 pm.

The fire escalated very rapidly, and flames became visible; police started to evacuate the stand. As the blaze spread, the wooden stands and roofcovered with layers of highly flammable bituminous roofing feltquickly went ablaze. Burning timbers and molten materials fell from the roof onto the crowd and seating below, and dense black smoke enveloped a passageway behind the stand, where many spectators were trying to escape. One eyewitness, Geoffrey Mitchell, told the BBC: &quot;It spread like a flash. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. The smoke was choking. You could hardly breathe.&quot; As spectators began to cascade over the wall separating the stand from the pitch, the linesman on that side of the pitch informed referee Norman Glover, who stopped the game with three minutes remaining before half-time. It took less than four minutes for the entire stand to be engulfed in flames.

There were no extinguishers in the stand&#x27;s passageway for fear of vandalism, and one spectator ran to the clubhouse to find one but was overcome by smoke and impeded by others trying to escape. Supporters either ran upwards to the back of the stand or downwards to the pitch to escape. The stand had no perimeter fencing to keep fans from accessing the pitch, thus averting an instance of crush asphyxia as in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. Footage of the accident at this point shows levels of confusion among the spectatorswhile many were trying to escape or to cross the pitch to the relative safety of the neighbouring stands, other spectators were observed cheering or waving to the still-rolling pitchside cameras.

Most of the exits at the back were locked or shut and there were no stewards present to open them, but seven were forced open or found open. Three men smashed down one door and at least one exit was opened by people outside, which again helped prevent further deaths. Geoffrey Mitchell said: &quot;There was panic as fans stampeded to an exit which was padlocked. Two or three burly men put their weight against it and smashed the gate open. Otherwise, I would not have been able to get out.&quot; At the front of the stand, men threw children over the wall to help them escape. Most of those who escaped onto the pitch were saved.

People who had escaped the fire then tried to assist their fellow supporters. Police officers also assisted in the rescue attempts. One man clambered over burning seats to help a fan, as did player John Hawley, and one officer led fans to an exit, only to find it shut and had to turn around. Bradford City&#x27;s coach Terry Yorath, whose family was in the stand, ran onto the pitch to help evacuate people. Another player went into the office space to ensure there was nobody there. One fan put his jumper over a fellow supporter&#x27;s head to extinguish flames. Those who escaped were taken out of the ground to neighbouring homes and a pub, where a television screened &quot;World of Sport&quot;, which broadcast video recorded of the fire just an hour after it was filmed.

The fire brigade arrived at the ground four minutes after they were initially alerted. However, the fire had consumed the stand entirely by that point and they were faced with huge flames and very dense smoke. As many supporters still required rescue from the stand, they were unable to immediately start fighting the source of the fire.

The fire destroyed the main stand completely and left only burned seats, lamps and metal fences remaining. Some of those who died were still sitting upright in their seats, covered by remnants of tarpaulin that had fallen from the roof. Police worked until 4 am the next morning, under lighting, to remove all the bodies. Within a few hours of the blaze starting, it was established that 56 people had been killed, many as a result of smoke inhalation, although some of them had survived until reaching hospital.

===Television broadcast===

The match was recorded by Yorkshire Television for their regional edition of the ITV Sunday afternoon football show &quot;The Big Match&quot;. Uncensored coverage of the fire was transmitted minutes after the event on &quot;World of Sport&quot; and the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Grandstand&quot; after the video cassette was physically driven to Yorkshire Television.

==Victims and injured==

Of the 56 people who died in the fire, 54 were Bradford supporters and two supported Lincoln. They included three who tried to escape through the toilets, 27 who were found by exit K and turnstiles 6 to 9 at the rear centre of the stand, and two elderly people who had died in their seats. Some had been crushed as they tried to crawl under turnstiles to escape. One retired mill worker made his way to the pitch, but was walking about on fire from head to foot. People smothered him to extinguish the flames, but he later died of his injuries in hospital. Of those who died, 11 were under-18 and 23 were aged 65 or over, and the oldest victim was the club&#x27;s former chairman, Sam Firth, aged 86. More than 265 supporters were injured.

The fire was described as the worst fire disaster in the history of British football, and the worst football related disaster since 66 spectators died at Ibrox in 1971.

==Treatment of casualties and Burns Research Unit==
The Bradford Burns Unit was set up by Professor David Sharpe after he received many of the victims following the fire. As he received the injured at Bradford Royal Infirmary he was able to call upon 10% of the UK&#x27;s population of plastic surgeons. It was during this treatment that Sharpe began to develop the Bradford Sling, which applies even pressure across sensitive areas. The sling is now used internationally in the treatment of burns.

Immediately after the fire, Sharpe planned and treated the injuries of over 200 individuals, with many experimental treatments being used. Matthew Wildman, aged 17 at the time of the fire, commented that &quot;I must have had five different experiments carried out on me with all sorts of new techniques for skin grafts and I had potions injected into me that helped my face repair naturally over time.&quot;

On the 25th anniversary of the fire, the University of Bradford established the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest academic research centre in skin sciences as an extension to its plastic surgery and burns research unit.

==Inquiry, inquest and legal action==

===Popplewell Inquiry===
The inquiry into the disaster, chaired by Sir Oliver Popplewell and known as the Popplewell Inquiry, led to the introduction of new legislation to improve safety at the UK&#x27;s football grounds. Among the main outcomes of the inquiry were the banning of new wooden grandstands at all UK sports grounds, the immediate closure of other wooden stands deemed unsafe and the banning of smoking in other wooden stands.

At the time of the disaster, many stadiums had perimeter fencing between the stands and the pitch to prevent incidents of football hooliganism – particularly pitch invasions – which were rife during the 1980s. The main stand at Bradford was not surrounded by fencing, and therefore most of the spectators in it could escape onto the pitch – if they had been penned in then the death toll would inevitably have been in the hundreds if not the thousands. However, the turnstiles were locked and none of the stadium staff were present to unlock them, leaving no escape through the normal entrances and exits. Most of the fans who took this escape route were killed or seriously injured. Fans in the next stand (the &quot;Bradford End&quot;) pulled down the fence separating them from the pitch.

The Popplewell Inquiry found that the club had been warned about the fire risk that the rubbish accumulating under the stand had posed. The stand had already been condemned, and the demolition teams were due to start work two days later. However, as there was no real precedent, most Bradfordians accepted that the fire was a terrible piece of misfortune. A discarded cigarette and a dilapidated wooden stand, which had survived because the club did not have the money to replace it, and accumulated paper litter, were considered to have conspired to cause the worst disaster in the history of the Football League at that time .

===Inquest and legal test case===
In July 1985, an inquest was held into the deaths; at the hearings the coroner James Turnbull recommended a death by misadventure outcome, with which the jury agreed. Following the hearing in 1986, a test case was brought against the club by David Britton, a police sergeant serving on the day, and by Susan Fletcher, who lost her husband John, 11-year-old son Andrew, John&#x27;s brother Peter and his father Edmond in the fire. On 23 February 1987, Sir Joseph Cantley found the club two thirds responsible and the county council (which by this time had been abolished) one third responsible.

Explaining his decision, Sir Joseph Cantley stated: &quot;As I have already stated, the primary duty was on the Club and the functions of the County Council were supervisory and its liability is for negligent breach of a common law duty arising out of the way in which they dealt with or ignored their statutory powers. That duty was not a duty to the Club but a duty to the spectators and other persons in the stand. However, the responsibility of the Club is, in my view, very much the greater and I apportion responsibility between the two defendants as to two-thirds on the first defendant and one-third on the third (sic) defendant.&quot;

West Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council was found to have failed in its duty under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. The Health and Safety Executive who were also part of the legal action were found to be non-liable. Criticising Bradford City during the case, Mr. Michael Ogden QC, highlighted that the Club &#x27;gave no or very little thought to fire precautions&#x27;, despite repeated warnings.

The outcome of the test case resulted in over 154 claims being addressed (110 civilians and 44 police officers) by the injured or bereaved. Speaking at the close of the case, the Judge said &quot;They (the club) were at fault, no one in authority seemed to have appreciated the fire hazard. No one gave it the attention it ought to have received.. .. The fact is that no one person was concerned with the safety of the premises.&quot;

Central to the test case were two letters sent to Bradford City&#x27;s Club Secretary by the West Yorkshire Fire Brigade; the second letter dated 18 July 1984 specifically highlighted in full the improvements needed to be actioned at the ground as well as the fire risk at the main stand. When cross examined by QC Robert Smith, then Chairman Stafford Heginbotham said he knew about the fire risk at the ground.

During the case, Sir Joseph Cantley stated that: &quot;It is only right that I should say that I think it would be unfair to conclude that Heginbotham, Tordoff, the Board of Directors, or any of them, were intentionally and callously indifferent to the safety of spectators using the stand. They were at fault, but the fault was that no-one in authority seems ever to have properly appreciated the real gravity of this fire hazard and consequently no-one gave it the attention it certainly ought to have received.&quot;

The total amount of compensation to the 154 claimants was reported to be as high as £20million, with the payouts covered by insurance taken out by the club. In 1988, the first compensation payments were made to survivors of the fire, with over 40 people receiving up to £40,000 each. By this date the appeal fund set up for survivors had paid out more than £4m with further payouts expected as the effects of physical and mental injury were determined.

===Comments by Martin Fletcher===
In 2010, Susan Fletcher&#x27;s son and survivor of the Bradford City fire (and witness to the Hillsborough disaster), Martin Fletcher, openly criticised the club&#x27;s hierarchy at the time of the fire and the subsequent investigation. Fletcher said that &quot;The club at the time took no actual responsibility for its actions and nobody has ever really been held accountable for the level of negligence which took place. It was appalling that public money was given to the club while it was still owned by the same shareholders under whose direction the fire had happened. I do not include the people currently running the club, who have always displayed a great, sensitive duty to the memory of those who died.&quot;

After controversial comments made by Popplewell about the Hillsborough Disaster, Fletcher raised further concerns about the events following the fire saying that &quot;I have many unanswered questions still about the fire in which four of my family died, as does my mother. Popplewell&#x27;s report was nowhere close to the quality of Lord Justice Taylor&#x27;s report after Hillsborough, and since reading it as an adult I have always been very disappointed in it and considered it a poor piece of work.&quot; Fletcher subsequently published a book in 2015, &quot;Fifty-Six: The Story of the Bradford Fire&quot; which revealed a history of fires at businesses owned by the Bradford City chairman Stafford Heginbotham. Eight fires in the 18 years before the Bradford City fire were identified, many catastrophic and leading to large insurance payouts.

==Reaction==
The tragedy received immense media attention and drew support from around the world, with those offering their sympathy including Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Pope John Paul II. Messages of condolence were also received from Helmut Kohl, Chedli Klibi and Felipe González.

The club&#x27;s chairman, Stafford Heginbotham, said: &quot;It was to be our day&quot;. Coach Terry Yorath described the events as &quot;the worst day in my life.&quot; Police Superintendent Barry Osborne, divisional commander for the area, said many of his officers cried when they saw how badly people had been burned.

The disaster also had a long-lasting effect on the fans. Christopher Hammond, who was 12 on the day, said on the 20th anniversary of the fire: &quot;As a 12-year-old, it was easy to move on – I didn&#x27;t realise how serious it was until I looked at the press coverage over the next few days. But looking back and seeing how much it really affected my dad makes me realise what we went through.&quot; His father Tony went back the following day and said: &quot;I wondered how anybody had got out alive, but I also began to feel guilty that I had got out when so many hadn&#x27;t.&quot; He had to undergo counselling and was unable to go to another game for several years. Matthew Wildman was 17 at the time and needed crutches to walk because of rheumatoid arthritis. He was helped out of the stand by other fans and spent a period of time in hospital. He later said: &quot;I have never known anything like it, either before, or since. Everybody in the city was devastated, but there was an amazing number of volunteers. [...] I still have terrible memories of the day, but it is the humanity of those that helped us that I reflect on.&quot;

==Aftermath==
===Appeal fund===
The Bradford Disaster Appeal fund, set up within 48hours of the disaster, eventually raised over £3.5million (£million today). The fundraising events included a reunion of the 1966 World Cup Final Starting XI that began with the original starting teams of both England and West Germany, and was held at Leeds United&#x27;s stadium, Elland Road, in July 1985 to raise funds for the Appeal fund. England won the re-match 6–4.

Part of the Appeal funds were raised by a recording of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; from Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s musical &quot;Carousel&quot; by The Crowd (including Gerry Marsden of Gerry and the Pacemakers, who had recorded the 1963 version that led to Liverpool adopting it as their motto and team song), which reached number one in the UK Singles chart. The money raised from this record was contributed to fund the internationally renowned burns unit that was established in partnership between the University of Bradford and Bradford Royal Infirmary, immediately after the fire, which has also been Bradford City&#x27;s official charity for well over a decade.

For the 30th anniversary of the fire a new version of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; was recorded at Voltage Studios in Bradford. On the recording are Dene Michael (Black Lace), The Chuckle Brothers, Clive Jackson of Dr &amp; The Medics, Owen Paul, Billy Pearce, Billy Shears, Flint Bedrock, and Rick Wild of The Overlanders. It was the brainchild of Bradford City fan Lloyd Spencer with all profits going to the Bradford Royal Infirmary Burns Unit.

===Memorial service and memorials===

A capacity 6,000 crowd attended a multi-denominational memorial service, held on the pitch in the sunny shadow of the burnt out stand at Valley Parade in July 1985. A giant Christian cross, made up of two large charred wooden members that had once been part of the stand, was constructed in front of the middle of the stand and behind the pitchside speaker&#x27;s platform. Part of the service was also held in Urdu and Punjabi as a sign of appreciation to the local Pakistani community in Manningham, Bradford and around Valley Parade who had opened their homes to Bradford City supporters to provide assistance in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. The next day work began on clearing the burnt out shell of the stand, and Justice Popplewell released his findings into the disaster.

Bradford City initially prospered in the Second Division – only missing out on promotion to the First Division in 1988 after failing to beat Ipswich Town at home on the final day of their first full season back at Valley Parade.

At Valley Parade there are now two memorials. One, now re-situated to that end of the stand where the fire began, is a sculpture donated on the initial re-opening of Valley Parade in December 1986 by Sylvia Graucob, a then Jersey-based former West Yorkshire woman. The other, situated by the main entrance, was donated by the club after its £7.5million (£million today) rebuilding of the original main stand in 2002. It has a black marble fascia on which the names and ages of those that died are inscribed in gold, and a black marble platform on which people can leave flowers and mementos. There is a twin memorial sculpture, unveiled on 11 May 1986, which has the names of the dead inscribed on it. They were donated by Bradford&#x27;s twin city of Hamm, Germany, and are situated in front of Bradford City Hall in both locations.

After the fire, Bradford City also announced they would thereafter play with a black trim on their shirt sleeves as a permanent memorial to those who had died.

===Commendations===
Four police officers, constables David Britton and John Richard Ingham and chief inspectors Charles Frederick Mawson and Terence Michael Slocombe, and two spectators, Richard Gough and David Hustler, were awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal for their actions. PCs Peter Donald Barrett and David Charles Midgley, along with spectators Michael William Bland and Timothy Peter Leigh received the Queen&#x27;s Commendation for Brave Conduct. In total, 28 police officers and 22 supporters, who were publicly documented as having saved at least one life, later received police commendations or bravery awards. Together, flanked by undocumented supporters, they managed to clear all but one person who made it to the front of the stand. Club coach Terry Yorath incurred minor injuries while taking part in the rescue.

===Redevelopment of Valley Parade grounds===

While Valley Parade was re-developed, Bradford City played games at various neighbouring grounds: Elland Road, Leeds; Leeds Road, Huddersfield; and Odsal Stadium, Bradford. Valley Parade re-opened on 14 December 1986, when Bradford City beat an England XI 2–1 in a friendly. Since then, it has been further re-developed and, today, Valley Parade is a modern 25,136 all-seater stadium, which is virtually unrecognisable from how it was at the time of the disaster, save for the original clubhouse that still stands beside the main stand, and the flank support wall that runs down the Hollywell Ash Lane at the &quot;Bradford End&quot;.

===Effect on Lincoln City===
Lincoln City suffered two successive relegations, first to the Fourth Division in 1986, and again in 1987, becoming the first team to be automatically relegated from the Football League itself. They were immediately promoted back to the Football League in 1988, and survived for 23 years before being relegated again in 2011. Although some attributed Lincoln City&#x27;s sudden demise to the psychological effects of the fire on its players (together with the resignation of successful manager Colin Murphy shortly before the fire), it symbolised the wider crisis that the introduction of new safety legislation brought to Lincoln&#x27;s Sincil Bank home.

The timber construction of St. Andrew&#x27;s Stand, Main Stand and the roof of its popular Railway End terrace were immediately condemned as fire hazards, which saw seating capacity briefly cut to nil. Lincoln City&#x27;s board responded by committing £1.1million (£million today) to their ground&#x27;s renovation in the year that immediately followed the fire at Valley Parade, and over the following decade made improvements that eventually totalled £3million. After its renovation in 1990 they named the home end of their ground the &#x27;Stacey-West Stand&#x27;, in honour of Bill Stacey and Jim West, the two Lincoln City supporters who were amongst the 56 to die at Bradford. Each year Lincoln send representatives to the annual memorial service in Bradford city centre and between 2007 and 2009, were managed by Bradford&#x27;s captain that day, Peter Jackson.

The two sides met for the first time after the fire in April 1989, when they arranged a benefit match in aid of the Hillsborough disaster, at Valley Parade.

==Dramatisations, documentaries and published works==
In 2014, the theatre company Funny You Should Ask (FYSA) premiered their heartfelt tribute to the 56 people who died at the fire. Called &#x27;The 56&#x27; the play dramatises actual accounts of the Bradford City Fire with the purpose of the play showing how in times of adversity, the Football Club and the local community came together. Scriptwriters of the play spent hours with the survivors and victims&#x27; families. Profits from the play&#x27;s run at The Edinburgh Fringe were donated to the Bradford Burns Unit.

Parrs Wood Press published &quot;Four Minutes to Hell: The Story of the Bradford City Fire&quot; (2005) by author Paul Firth; the title refers to the estimated time it took for the stand to be completely ablaze from the first flames being spotted. Another book; &quot;56: The Story of the Bradford Fire (2015)&quot; was written by Martin Fletcher to discuss how the disaster was caused, and follows his loss of his father, brother, uncle and grandfather.

On 1 May 2010, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the fire the football TV show &quot;Football Focus&quot; was hosted from Valley Parade by Dan Walker, the show included interviews with Terry Yorath and John Hendrie.

In 1986, a year after the disaster, Yorkshire Television aired a documentary presented by John Helm entitled &quot;Bradford City – A Year of Healing&quot;. The Documentary highlighted the &#x27;poison pen letters&#x27; and graffiti targeted at the then club chairman Stafford Heginbotham over accusations that he was in some way personally responsible for the deaths of the 56 people who died at the fire.

==Calls for a new inquiry==
Following his own 15 year investigation Into the fire, which killed four of his family members while he escaped, former tax accountant Martin Fletcher released &quot;56: The Story of the Bradford Fire&quot; (2015). Nigel Adams – who worked for 12 years as a fire investigator with a British fire service – was spurred on by the book to join the call for a fresh inquiry, stating that Fletcher&#x27;s book was &quot;one of the best accounts of a fire, as seen from a victim&#x27;s point of view, and as a piece of investigative writing, I have ever read&quot;. He agreed that the inquiry into Bradford, led by the judge Oliver Popplewell, was inadequate and that there are many unanswered questions. He went on to state:

&quot;In 1985 fire investigation in Britain was in its infancy and some would say at that time most fire investigators were not much more than dust-kickers. Like all areas of forensic investigations, it has come on leaps and bounds. However, there is a lot in this book that troubles me about the science, or lack of it, used in the testing of the investigators&#x27; hypothesis as to the source of the ignition. The book also raises concerns about the speed of the inquiry and the fact that it commenced a few weeks after the fire and lasted for only a few days, whereas other inquiries into similar incidents, pre and post the Bradford fire, have taken years to come to fruition and months to be heard. The fact the inquiry also embraced the investigation into another incident which happened on the same day, a riot in which a young boy died at Birmingham City, makes it seem more frivolous.&quot;

Adams also went on to state that &quot;I have read in some newspapers that he is being berated for his campaign to have a new inquiry. I don&#x27;t see that. There is no malicious vendetta, there is no over-exaggeration, there are no trumped-up facts. It is a simple account laid out for all to see. Fletcher has taken facts and presented them in such a way that it should make it moralistically impossible for this incident not to be looked at again.&quot;

On 26 January 2016, the IPCC declined calls for an investigation and published its full response online.

==Eric Bennett controversy==
On 17 April 2015, retired Detective Inspector Raymond Falconer, in a report by the Bradford &quot;Telegraph and Argus&quot;, said the police were aware of an Australian man who admitted to starting the fire. Following the 30th anniversary of the fire, a number of news organisations named this man as Eric Bennett who was visiting his nephew in Bradford from Australia and attended the game on the day. Following this report, Leslie Brownlie, who was the nephew in question, is reported to have said that his uncle never made such an admission of starting the fire. He is quoted as saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe the statement of retired Detective Inspector Raymond Falconer at all. I don&#x27;t know where Falconer is getting this cock-and-bull story from… the inaccuracies in this report [documentary] are dumbfounding.&quot;

Raymond Falconer&#x27;s reliability had previously been questioned by Daniel Taylor in &quot;The Guardian&quot; who stated that: &quot;The &quot;Bradford Telegraph and Argus&quot; described him as a &#x27;top detective&#x27;. He was actually one of the detectives involved in one of the gravest miscarriages of justices in the country, the murder of Carol Wilkinson in Bradford, where someone was locked up for 20 years for a murder he didn&#x27;t commit.&quot;

<text>Evan Samuel Dobelle (born April 22, 1945) is a former public official and higher-education administrator, is known for promoting higher-education investment in the Creative Economy, public-private partnerships and the &quot;College Ready&quot; model that helps students graduate from high school and college.

==Early life==
Dobelle was born in Washington, D.C., on April 22, 1945. Dobelle&#x27;s father was prominent American surgeon Martin Dobelle; his older brother was medical researcher William H. Dobelle. Dobelle grew up between Pittsfield, Massachusetts and Cocoa Beach, Florida, where his father served on the medical staff for Project Mercury.

Dobelle began his undergraduate education at The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, where he was named a &quot;Distinguished Alumnus&quot;.

==Education and career==
Dobelle holds bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees in Education Administration from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and a master&#x27;s degree in public administration from Harvard University. Elected mayor of Pittsfield, Massachusetts in 1973 and 1975, Dobelle was later Massachusetts State Commissioner of Environmental Management and Natural Resources. He was U.S. Chief of Protocol for the White House in the Carter administration with the rank of Ambassador. His wife, Edith H. J. Dobelle, served as Chief of Protocol and Chief of Staff to First Lady Rosalynn Carter.
He was the treasurer and deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee and National Chairman of the Carter-Mondale Presidential Committee.

Long before the 1980 presidential race, Dobelle worked as a Research Associate for Governor Ronald Reagan&#x27;s commission for educational reform.

Dobelle was President of Middlesex Community College in Lowell, Massachusetts from 1987 to 1990.

Dobelle was subsequently President and Chancellor of City College of San Francisco from 1990 to 1995. While in San Francisco, Dobelle decentralized administrative functions - a managerial model the college celebrated and maintained until it went into state receivership in 2012 nearly losing its accreditation. While issues were identified by FCMAT, the report was issued seventeen years and three presidents after the end of Dobelle&#x27;s tenure and none of the findings were attributed to Dobelle.

While president of Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut (1995–2001), neighborhood renewal reversed declining enrollments.

As president of the University of Hawaiʻi from 2001 to 2004, he backed unifying the system&#x27;s campuses, established the Academy of Creative Media, built a new medical school, reformed financial and building practices and strengthened Native Hawaiian programs. He was also criticized for politicizing the university by endorsing Democrat Mazie Hirono for governor and for paying unusually high salaries to administrators (though typical by mainland standards). On June 15, 2004, Dobelle was fired by the Board of Regents, but this firing was deemed illegal and void. Turnover on the Board of Regents meant that there were no Regents left who had selected him as president. A few weeks later, Dobelle and the university reached a mediated settlement. Dobelle agreed to resign from the presidency and not to apply for any other University of Hawaiʻi positions, and the university agreed to a two-year non-tenured research position and a settlement of $1.6 million in cash, a state pension for life, and a fully paid $2 million life insurance policy, and assumed all legal costs of $1.2 million, with no finding of wrongdoing on the part of either Dobelle or the board.

The ensuing controversy caused a statewide referendum to be passed by 63% that changed the way Regents were appointed by the Governor and was upheld unanimously by the Hawaii Supreme Court. The gubernatorial advisor and Regent who had initiated the process against Dobelle was subsequently rejected for reconfirmation by the state senate.

In 2004, he became president of the New England Board of Higher Education (NEBHE). A few weeks later he was unanimously chosen to be President of NEBHE by the 48 delegates representing the six New England governors. Dobelle reorganized and focused the organization on core issues of access and affordability, significantly heightening NEBHE&#x27;s visibility and increasing external funding. Dobelle also energized participation of the six states in the region for the College Ready initiative and engaged all New England Governors, SHEEOS, and K–12 Education Commissioners in a single cooperative effort to address high school graduation rates and college access.

In December 2007 Dobelle was appointed president of Westfield State College in Westfield, Massachusetts. During his tenure the school&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;college&quot; to &quot;university.&quot;

In August, 2013, an audit directed by the executive committee of the university&#x27;s board of trustees found that Dobelle mixed personal and institutional expenses submitted for reimbursement; Dobelle countered that he had self-reported the accounting issue to the chair and the university General Counsel, and that the issue had arisen due to the existing system. Auditors also questioned other expenses, including tickets to the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and a wire transfer to Vietnam, one of several expenses from a 2008 twelve-person academic delegation to Asia meant to raise Westfield&#x27;s international profile and to raise funds. Reaction to the controversy includes an investigation by the state Attorney General&#x27;s office and the withdrawal of a $100,000 gift; Dobelle countered that the pledge had been made years before and was not authentic. Dobelle called the audit and its release illegal and defaming. On November 8, 2013, Dobelle announced his resignation from Westfield State University and his retirement from public service. However, he was still both suing the university and billing it for over 90 thousand dollars in his legal fees. On July 31, 2014, the Massachusetts Inspector General&#x27;s Office published the results of its investigation of Dobelle&#x27;s spending while at Westfield State. On April 30, 2015, Dobelle and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts settled. The settlement required Dobelle to pay the Commonwealth $185,000 in legal fees. The settlement agreement also prevents Dobelle from serving in any role at a Massachusetts public institution of higher learning, but with no admission of wrongdoing on the part of Dobelle.

He currently works as a consultant and board member in the nonprofit and private sectors.

==Research and recognition==
He has researched and compiled the &quot;Saviors of Our Cities&quot; list, which spotlights the top 25 universities and colleges that are &quot;exemplary examples of community revitalization and cultural renewal, economic drivers of the local economy, advocates of community service and urban developers, both commercially as well as in housing.&quot;

Dobelle serves on the Executive Boards of the Consortium of Urban and Metropolitan Universities ( CUMU), the Commission on Effective Leadership of the American Council on Education (ACE), and the Council on International Education (CIEE).

Dobelle has received accolades during his career for success in community outreach as well as management of colleges inclusive of faculty issues, athletic teams, student engagement and being an agent for change.

==Family==
Dobelle&#x27;s father was orthopedic surgeon Martin Dobelle, and his brother was scientist William H. Dobelle. He resides with his long-time wife, Kit. They have one son.

<text>Joachim Wilhelm Franz Philipp von Holtzendorff (October 14, 1829 – February 4, 1889), German jurist, born at Vietmannsdorf (a village in Templin), in the Mark of Brandenburg, was descended from a family of the old nobility.

He was educated at Berlin and at Pforta, afterwards studying law at the universities of Bonn, Heidelberg and Berlin (now the Humboldt University of Berlin). The Revolutions of 1848 inspired him with youthful enthusiasm, and he remained for the rest of his life a strong advocate of political liberty. In 1852 he graduated LL.D. from the University of Berlin, and in 1857 he became a &quot;Privatdocent&quot;; in 1860 he was nominated an extraordinary professor.

The predominant party in Prussia regarded his political opinions with mistrust, and he was not offered an ordinary professorship until February 1873, after he had decided to accept a chair at the University of Munich, where he passed the last nineteen years of his life. During the thirty years that he was professor he successively taught several branches of jurisprudence, but he was chiefly distinguished as an authority on criminal and international law.

He was especially well-suited to organizing collective work, and he has associated his name with a series of publications of the first order. While acting as editor, he often reserved for himself—among the independent monographs of which the work was composed—only those on subjects distasteful to his collaborators on account of their obscurity or lack of importance. Among the notable compilations which he superintended were the &quot;Encyclopädie der Rechtswissenschaft&quot; (Leipzig, 1870–1871, two volumes); his &quot;Handbuch des deutschen Strafrechts&quot; (Berlin, 1871–1877, 4 volumes), and his &quot;Handbuch des Völkerrechts auf Grundlage europäischer Staatspraxis&quot; (Berlin, 1885–1890, 4 volumes).

Among his many independent works were:
*&quot;Das irische Gefängnissystem&quot; (Leipzig, 1859)
*&quot;Französische Rechtszustände&quot; (Leipzig, 1859)
*&quot;Die Deportation als Strafmittel&quot; (Leipzig, 1859)
*&quot;Die Kürzungsfähigkeit der Freiheitsstrafen&quot; (Leipzig, 1861)
*&quot;Die Reform der Staatsanwaltschaft in Deutschland&quot; (Berlin, 1864)
*&quot;Die Umgestaltung der Staatsanwaltschaft&quot; (Berlin, 1865)
*&quot;Die Principien der Politik&quot; (Berlin, 1869)
*&quot;Das Verbrechen des Mordes und die Todesstrafe&quot; (Berlin, 1875)
*&quot;Rumäniens Uferrechte an der Donau&quot; (Leipzig, 1883; French edition, 1884)

He also edited or assisted in editing a number of periodical publications on legal subjects. From 1866 to the time of his death he collaborated with Rudolf Ludwig Karl Virchow in editing &quot;Sammlung gemeinverständlicher wissenschaftlicher Vorträge&quot; (Berlin). He gave a lecture on &quot;European Jurisprudence&quot;, one of a series of twelve given by the American Social Science Association for the Lowell Institute for their 1876–77 season.

<text>Benzonitrile is the chemical compound with the formula , abbreviated PhCN. This aromatic organic compound is a colorless liquid with a sweet bitter almond odour. It is mainly used as a precursor to the resin benzoguanamine.

==Production and reactions==
It is prepared by ammoxidation of toluene, that is its reaction with ammonia and oxygen (or air) at .
: + 3/2 + → + 
In the laboratory it can be prepared by the dehydration of benzamide or benzaldehyde oxime or by the Rosenmund–von Braun reaction using cuprous cyanide or NaCN/DMSO and bromobenzene.

Hydrogenation of benzonitrile in principle gives benzylamine, but owing to transamination, dibenzylamine and tribenzylamine are also produced.

==Applications==

===Laboratory uses===
Benzonitrile is a useful solvent and a versatile precursor to many derivatives. It reacts with amines to afford N-substituted benzamides after hydrolysis. It is a precursor to diphenylmethanimine via reaction with phenylmagnesium bromide followed by methanolysis.

Benzonitrile forms coordination complexes with transition metals that are both soluble in organic solvents and conveniently labile. One example is . The benzonitrile ligands are readily displaced by stronger ligands, making benzonitrile complexes useful synthetic intermediates.

==History==
Benzonitrile was reported by Hermann Fehling in 1844. He found the compound as a product from the thermal dehydration of ammonium benzoate. He deduced its structure from the already known analogue reaction of ammonium formate yielding hydrogen cyanide (formonitrile). He also coined the name benzonitrile which gave the name to all the group of nitriles.

In 2018, benzonitrile was reported to be detected in the interstellar medium.

<text>Angelos Charisteas (, ; born 9 February 1980) is a Greek former professional footballer who played as a forward. Since 2019, he works as sporting director for Aris.

At club level he played for Aris Thessaloniki, Werder Bremen, Ajax, Feyenoord, Bayer Leverkusen, Schalke 04, Arles-Avignon, and Al-Nassr. In 2004, he won the double with Werder Bremen, earning Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal medals and was also the club&#x27;s Sportsman of the Year. With Ajax, Charisteas also won the Dutch Cup and the Dutch Super Cup.

Internationally, he was capped 88 times by Greece, scoring 25 goals. He was a member of the UEFA Euro 2004 winning team, scoring three goals, including the winning goal in the final against the hosts Portugal, which was considered as the greatest triumph of the nation. He also represented Greece at UEFA Euro 2008 and the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

In 2019, Charisteas was also a political deputy in the region of Central Macedonia

==Club career==

===Aris===
After a few years playing for amateur club Strimonikos Serron, Charisteas eventually started his professional career with Greek side Aris Thessaloniki. It was during his first season at Aris that Charisteas started making a name for himself, scoring twice in nine matches as they won the Greek second division in 1997–98. Charisteas started well in his first season in the Greek top league and got further noticed when he scored twice in the local derby against Thessaloniki rivals PAOK. The striker made twelve appearances in the Alpha Ethniki – six as a substitute – before a loan at Athinaikos in 1998–99. He returned to Aris the following season and made his European debut in a UEFA Cup defeat by Celta de Vigo at the age of 19. Charisteas was continuously developing and in the 2000–01 season, where he scored seven goals.

===Werder Bremen===
On 29 January 2002, Charisteas joined Bundesliga side Werder Bremen, signing a four-year contract valid from the summer, having been watched by scouts from a number of Europe&#x27;s leading sides.

Werder Bremen Sporting director, Klaus Allofs attested &quot;Angelos is strong header of the ball, very fast and has good tactical behaviour&quot;.

At the club, he scored with regularity between 2002 and 2005.

The transfer fee paid to Aris was reported as €3 million. He had a successful first season scoring nine goals in 31 appearances in the Bundesliga and two goals from four games in the UEFA Cup.

In the 2003–04 season, Werder Bremen won the Bundesliga and the German Cup with Charisteas scoring four goals from 24 appearances.

On 29 September 2004, Charisteas contributed a goal in his side&#x27;s 2–1 win against Valencia in the Champions League. In total, he scored five goals in 11 matches for Werder Bremen the 2004–05 season.

===Ajax===
In December 2004, Charisteas moved to the Netherlands to play for Ajax for a reported fee nearly €5 million. Greece manager Otto Rehhagel had publicly urged Charisteas to try to move to another club during the January 2005 transfer window, in order to get more first-team action. Ajax fitted the bill, as they were hoping to find a replacement for Swedish international striker Zlatan Ibrahimović, who had been sold to Juventus. Charisteas made his Ajax debut on 23 January 2005 against FC Utrecht and scored his first goal four days later against SC Heerenveen. However, he only managed three more games all season. Charisteas netted home eight goals in the 2005–06 season, which included a late winner against Vitesse Arnhem. Charisteas missed Greece&#x27;s crucial match in the World Cup qualifying due to a head injury received after colliding with Arsenal&#x27;s Kolo Touré in a Champions League match which Ajax lost 2–1.

Under new Ajax manager Henk ten Cate, Charisteas was the 5th striker behind Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Ryan Babel, Markus Rosenberg, and Rydell Poepon. Ten Cate explained this by saying that Charisteas is a great striker for the 4–4–2 formation, but not for the 4–3–3 formation, which is played for Ajax.

===Feyenoord===
Despite stating that he was only interested in a move to England or Germany, Charisteas signed for arch-rivals Feyenoord in Rotterdam on 31 August 2006, the final day of the summer transfer window. This move caused a great deal of agitation in Rotterdam with parts of The Legion, stating that they did not want an Ajax player at their club, protesting the move at De Kuip with the chant &quot;Wij willen geen neus.&quot; (translated as: &quot;we don&#x27;t want a nose,&quot; nose being derogatory slang for Ajax players) and demanded that chairman Jorien van den Herik resign. Despite the protests, Charisteas made his debut for Feyenoord on 10 September against Sparta Rotterdam and played the full game. He eventually scored his first goal for his new club in his tenth game. Although he seemed to have convinced some fans at a certain point, Charisteas never enjoyed a good relationship with Feyenoord supporters. He finished the season having played a total of 28 games for Feyenoord, netting nine goals.

===Nürnberg===
On 6 July 2007, 1. FC Nürnberg confirmed a deal with Feyenoord to sign Charisteas on a four-year deal worth €2.5 million. He scored his first two official team goals in a 6–0 victory against fourth division club SC Victoria Hamburg.

At the beginning of the 2009–10 season, he returned to the newly promoted Nürnberg. His first goal of the season came on 12 March 2010, when he scored the winning goal in the 1–2 away win against Hertha BSC, helping Nürnberg to avoid the relegation, before Otto Rehhagel called him up to the Greece national team for the 2010 World Cup.

===Bayer Leverkusen===
On 2 February 2009, he was loaned out to Bayer Leverkusen until the end of the season, helping the team to reach the final of the German Cup.

===Arles-Avignon===
On 10 August 2010, Charisteas signed for Arles-Avignon, along with teammate Angelos Basinas. He made his debut on 21 August 2010 in a 1–2 away defeat against Toulouse. Charisteas made a total of seven appearances, scoring no goals, before his contract was terminated on 26 November 2010.

===Schalke 04===
On 30 January 2011, Schalke 04 formalized his arrival. Charisteas signed a contract on 30 June 2011, until the end of the season. In his debut match for Schalke, he scored the second goal in a 2–1 home win against Eintracht Frankfurt. It was his first touch of the ball, having been on the pitch for only 52 seconds. On 13 April 2011, Charisteas reached the semi-finals of the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League with Schalke, beating in the quarter-finals the defending champion Inter Milan, Charisteas replaced the Brazilian Edu in the 32nd minute of the second half.

On 21 May 2011, Charisteas won the German Cup with Schalke 04.

===Panetolikos===
On 27 July 2011, Charisteas joined Panetolikos, newly promoted to the Super League, signing a one-year contract. His first goal of the season came on 14 September 2011 when he scored the winning goal in the 1–0 home win against Asteras Tripolis.

===Al-Nassr===
After interest from Inter Milan, reported in the newspaper &quot;Corriere dello Sport&quot;, on 17 February 2013, Charisteas signed a one-and-a-half-year contract with Al-Nassr FC. Charisteas played his debut in the final of the 2012–13 Saudi Crown Prince Cup against Al-Hilal FC on 22 February 2013. After 90 minutes penalties had to be taken and Charisteas missed the fourth.

==International career==
After having been a regular player for the Greek U21 side, Charisteas made his international debut in February 2001 in a 3–3 draw against Russia. His impact was immediate as he scored two of the goals for Greece that day. His prolific goal scoring continued, eventually helping his team qualify for the Euro 2004.
During the victorious Euro 2004 campaign, Charisteas scored three goals: one in the group stage against Spain, one against France in the quarterfinals and the winning goal against the host country Portugal in the final on 4 July, securing himself a permanent place in the history of the sport. The win against Portugal was also considered as the greatest triumph of the nation.

His contribution to the team and his impact in the competition was further recognised when he was named in the Euro 2004 All-star Team and he was also nominated for the 2004 Ballon d&#x27;Or award, where he finished 11th in votes.

In January 2007, Charisteas told Dutch football magazine Voetbal International that winning Euro 2004 was an unbelievable experience which he would not swap for all the money in the world: &quot;Even in 50 years time, everybody will remember that I scored the goal which made Greece the champions of Europe. We wrote history and my life changed completely at that point.&quot;

Charisteas scored three goals for Euro 2008 qualifying rounds, helping Greece to automatically qualify for the competition with two games left. He would go on to be one of the few Greece players who performed well at Euro 2008, scoring the defending champions&#x27; only goal of the tournament in the 2–1 defeat to Spain. He scored 4 goals for his country in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.

Charisteas was included in the squad that travelled to South Africa for the final tournament, where he played one game. In that competition, he was the only Greece player to participate in two European Championships and a World Cup (others sharing this distinction: Giourkas Seitaridis, Kostas Katsouranis, Georgios Karagounis and the goalkeeper Kostas Chalkias).

Charisteas received another call-up on 8 October 2011 for the qualification match against Croatia. On 11 October 2011, he scored the winning goal in the 85th minute in Georgia, securing a 2–1 victory which sent Greece automatically to the UEFA Euro 2012 With this goal, Charisteas score in three qualifiers for European Championship and for three consecutive World Cups, became the only player to reach that distinction in the Greece national team.

Charisteas also became the second top scorer for the Greece national team with 25 goals, four fewer than the retired Nikos Anastopoulos.

==Style of play==
Charisteas played primarily as a target man.

==Post-playing career==
===Sports Directing===
On 29 August 2019, Charisteas became sporting director of his former club Aris Thessaloniki. He initially worked loosely as a player agent, and obtained a UEFA B license before registering to acquire further coaching certificates.

===Politics===
In 2019, Charisteas was elected to the Regional Parliament of Central Macedonia and he was re-elected in 2023. He has served as Deputy Regional Governor of Digital Policy of the Region of Central Macedonia and he is currently serving as Deputy Regional Governor for Volunteering and Youth Affairs of Central Macedonia.

==Personal life==
During his time as a footballer, Charisteas was known to play the Bouzouki in his spare time.

<doc id="731090" wikidata="Q45567" url="?curid=731090" title="Fernando Morientes">
<text>Fernando Morientes Sánchez (; born 5 April 1976) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a striker.

He played for a number of clubs during his career, including Real Madrid, Monaco, Liverpool and Valencia. In La Liga, he scored 124 goals in 337 games over 15 seasons. He earned 11 major honours with the first club, including three Champions League trophies.

Morientes earned 47 caps for the Spain national team, representing the country in two World Cups (totalling five goals) and Euro 2004. He later worked briefly as a manager.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Cilleros, Cáceres, Extremadura, Morientes moved to Sonseca in the Province of Toledo at the age of four. He began his professional career at Albacete Balompié, making his La Liga debut on 7 November 1993 as a 75th-minute substitute for Alejandro in a 2–3 loss against CD Tenerife at the Estadio Carlos Belmonte, and he made one more appearance that season, also from the bench.

On 23 October 1994, soon after coming on as a first-half replacement for Alberto Monteagudo, Morientes scored his first professional goal, opening a 2–0 home win over Racing de Santander. He got his first start a week later in a 1–5 loss at RCD Español, and finished the campaign with a total of five goals in 20 league games; additionally, he found the net in each leg of a 3–2 aggregate win over holders Real Zaragoza in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey.

Morientes signed with Zaragoza in 1995, where he spent another two seasons, often being partnered up front by Dani, a Real Madrid youth graduate. He made his debut on 9 September away to Real Betis, scoring the team&#x27;s goal after 48 minutes but being sent off seven minutes later for striking Jaime. On 10 January of the following year, he scored his first professional hat-trick in a 3–2 win at Athletic Bilbao for the domestic cup; his first such feat in the league followed on 3 February in a 4–1 victory over Valencia CF at La Romareda, and eight days later he scored the first goal at SD Compostela and also received his marching orders with his team winning 2–1 (eventual 2–3 defeat).

===Real Madrid===
Morientes&#x27; performances for Zaragoza caught the eye of Spanish giants Real Madrid, which bought the player in the summer of 1997 for approximately €6.6 million. Initially backing up established Predrag Mijatović and Davor Šuker, he finished as starter and managed 12 goals in his first year in 33 matches, squad-best (with the two players who fought with him for a starting berth netting ten apiece, as youth system prodigy Raúl); the team finished fourth in the league, but won the season&#x27;s UEFA Champions League.

Morientes performed very well in the 1998–99 campaign, scoring 19 goals in the league and 25 in 38 appearances overall. He continued to display top football in 1999–2000, netting 19 times and finishing as Real&#x27;s top scorer in a year where he also helped to the capital side&#x27;s second Champions League title in three years, scoring in the 3–0 defeat of Valencia CF in an all-Spanish final. In the next season, he won the first of two league titles with the club and netted ten goals overall, including four in eight appearances in the Champions League in a semi-final exit to eventual winners FC Bayern Munich; he missed the last weeks due to injury.

In 2001–02, Real failed to win the league after losing out to Valencia. Morientes continued his scoring form, however, scoring 18 league goals in only 25 starts, with six substitute appearances. He also netted five in a 7–0 demolition of UD Las Palmas, missing out on a double hat-trick after missing from the penalty spot late in the match. He finished second in the top scorers list, tied with Patrick Kluivert and behind Deportivo de La Coruña&#x27;s Diego Tristán, as the &quot;Merengues&quot; were successful in winning the Champions League after beating Bayer 04 Leverkusen – he played in the final and received a third winners medal.

In the summer of 2002, Real Madrid signed Brazilian superstar Ronaldo from Inter Milan. This fueled rumours that Morientes would soon be leaving, with FC Barcelona and Tottenham Hotspur reportedly interested – the former were reportedly on the verge of signing the player for around €22 million, but the move fell through due to Barça&#x27;s reluctance to match his wage demands. Eventually, he decided to stay, but as predicted he did not feature as much after the arrival of Ronaldo, who was preferred in the starting lineup along with Raúl. He eventually fell down the pecking order of strikers to Guti and Javier Portillo and, during a February 2003 home win against Borussia Dortmund – 2–1 in the Champions League second group stage – was involved in a highly publicised spat with manager Vicente del Bosque, with the player allegedly insulting the coach after being called to enter the pitch as a third replacement in the dying minutes; in the winter transfer window, despite continuous rumours of moves to Tottenham, Zaragoza, AS Roma and AC Milan, he remained at the club for remainder of the season as the side went on to win the league, with the player making a total of 19 appearances (with three starts) and scoring five goals.

===Monaco loan and return===
At the start of the 2003–04 season, it was evident Morientes was not part of Real&#x27;s plans. After extensive but ultimately unsuccessful negotiations regarding a loan deal with Germany&#x27;s FC Schalke 04, he was loaned to Ligue 1 side AS Monaco FC, where he performed very well, netting ten times from 28 appearances in the league. It was in the Champions League, however, that he really made an impact, finishing as top scorer at nine goals: Monaco met Real Madrid in the quarter-finals, where he scored a vital away goal in the first leg (4–2 away loss); in the second match, he again found the net as his team won 3–1, taking the aggregate score to 5–5 (away goals rule victory). He also scored in both games of the last-four win against Chelsea, but could not prevent a 3–0 defeat in the final to FC Porto, played at the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen.

After returning to Real Madrid at the start of the 2004–05 campaign, Morientes&#x27; hopes of forcing his way into the squad were further dampened with the arrival of Michael Owen from Liverpool. He featured in 13 scoreless league matches (all as a substitute), and was transferred to Liverpool in January 2005 for a fee of €9.3 million. During his time at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium he played 272 games in all competitions, scoring 100 goals.

===Liverpool===

Morientes made his debut for Liverpool on 15 January 2005 against Manchester United, starting in a 0–1 home loss to the rivals – BBC Sport described his performance as &quot;quiet&quot;. He scored his first goal for the club on 1 February, equalising with a 20-yard strike in a 2–1 win at Charlton Athletic, and he followed it four days later with his first goal at Anfield to open a 3–1 win over Fulham after nine minutes. He was cup-tied for the Champions League campaign, and did not feature in the victory against Milan in the final of the competition.

On 10 August 2005, Morientes scored in each half of a 3–1 away win against PFC CSKA Sofia in the first leg of the third qualifying round for the season&#x27;s Champions League. His form in the league was inconsistent, but on 10 December he netted a five-minute brace in a 2–0 home defeat of Middlesbrough, their seventh in a row. On 21 March 2006, he scored in a 7–0 rout of Birmingham City in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, finishing Steven Gerrard&#x27;s cross three minutes after entering in place of Peter Crouch. Liverpool went on to win the tournament, and the player replaced Harry Kewell early in the second half of the final against West Ham United.

Morientes totalled 12 goals in 61 appearances, also winning the 2005 UEFA Super Cup and playing on the losing side in the 2005 Football League Cup final and the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship final. He ultimately failed to live up to his reputation.

===Valencia===

Morientes joined Valencia in late May 2006 for a fee reported to be around £3 million. Here, he started to regain his form, scoring on his league debut – a 2–1 home win against Betis– and also netting a hat-trick in his first Champions League appearance against Olympiacos FC. He linked up well with David Villa and scored 12 goals in 24 games, and was also team-top scorer in the Champions League with seven; his good form throughout the season also earned him a recall to the national side.

For 2007–08, Morientes and Villa were joined in the strike force by Nikola Žigić and Javier Arizmendi. The campaign, however, was disappointing, as the &quot;Che&quot; were knocked out of the Champions League after finishing fourth in the group, and manager Quique Sánchez Flores was dismissed following a poor run of form. He picked up an injury in December 2007 that ruled him out for almost three months, and he made his return to the side against Sevilla FC on 15 March 2008; he also came off the bench to score the third and final goal in Valencia&#x27;s 3–1 victory over Getafe CF in the final of the Copa del Rey the following month.

Morientes missed out on a further few league games after he was hospitalised in April with abdominal pains and fever. He was released from hospital in time for the final two matches of the season, but played no part in either.

Having begun the following campaign as an unused substitute in Valencia&#x27;s first league game, and only coming on from the bench in the second, Morientes was handed his first start in a UEFA Cup match against C.S. Marítimo, and he scored the only goal in Portugal through a solo effort at the 12-minute mark. His increasing age and the form of Villa and Juan Mata, however, led to only a handful of appearances in the league; as they were ousted in the round of 32, he still finished as their top scorer in European competition at three goals in seven matches.

===Marseille===

On 27 July 2009, Morientes agreed to a deal at France&#x27;s Olympique de Marseille on a free transfer for one year, reuniting with former Monaco boss Didier Deschamps. During his first and only season he was only the fourth of five strikers in the squad, his only Ligue 1 goal coming on 26 September in what his first start, opening a 3–2 loss at Valenciennes FC.

Morientes was released on 1 July 2010, by mutual consent. On 31 August, the 34-year-old announced his retirement from football.

===Coaching and brief return as player===
Morientes started his career as manager with Huracán Valencia CF, taking charge of its youth academy. In 2012 he returned to Real Madrid, being appointed at the &quot;Juvenil B&quot; team in the youth academy.

In January 2015, at 38, Morientes returned to playing, signing with DAV Santa Ana in the Madrid regional championships. In June, he became manager of CF Fuenlabrada, but was sacked the following 17 February with the team 11th in Segunda División B.

==International career==
Morientes was a reliable performer for the Spain national team since 1998, scoring a brace in the first five minutes of his debut against Sweden on 25 March and adding a further two in each of his next two games, against Northern Ireland and Bulgaria respectively. He ranked fourth on the Spanish all-time topscorer&#x27;s list with 27 goals in 47 appearances, behind former Real Madrid teammate Raúl, former Valencia teammate Villa and former Madrid captain Fernando Hierro (who took the majority of Spain&#x27;s free kicks and penalties), although his goals-to-games ratio was higher than Raúl and Hierro.

Morientes netted five goals in the two FIFA World Cups he featured in, with two goals in 1998 and three in 2002. In the latter edition he and Raúl played together up front, and both showed impressive form in the tournament; during the quarter-final match against South Korea the former scored a goal in extra-time that was disallowed, although replays suggested the goal was legitimate – Spain eventually lost the match on penalties.

After being a surprise omission at UEFA Euro 2000, with coach José Antonio Camacho later admitting after being ousted in the quarter-finals that he had made a mistake by picking Ismael Urzaiz instead, Morientes was selected for Euro 2004 in Portugal, where he scored one of only two goals that the side could manage, in a subsequent group-stage exit. He also played for the nation during the 2006 World Cup qualifiers; however, due to his poor club form for Liverpool, he was not chosen by national team coach Luis Aragonés in the final squad for the tournament, although he was part of an initial 31-man list.

Following his return to form after moving to Valencia, Morientes was recalled to the national side. He scored his 27th goal for Spain in a Euro 2008 qualifier against Denmark on 24 March 2007. Injured four days later against Iceland in another qualifying fixture, he was not recalled again.

==Style of play==
Morientes was regarded one of the top strikers of his generation, forming a notable and highly successful partnership with Raúl at Real Madrid. A quick, creative and hard-working player, he excelled in the air and was an accurate finisher with his head and with his feet, both inside and outside the area; he was also an accurate free kick taker, and was capable of playing off another striker.

In his later career, as he lost his pace, Morientes often played in a supporting role, using his strength and control to hold up the ball for teammates.

==Media==
Morientes was featured in the EA Sports&#x27; FIFA video game series: he was on the cover for the Spanish edition of &quot;FIFA 99&quot;, and also appeared in &quot;FIFA Football 2005&quot;.

Morientes competed in the third season of Mask Singer: Adivina quién canta as &quot;Gorila&quot;, being declared joint winner with Ana Torroja as &quot;Ratita&quot;.

<text>Oulu Airport (; , ) is located in Oulu, Finland, south-west of the city centre. The airport is the third busiest airport in Finland after Helsinki-Vantaa and Rovaniemi airport, as measured by the number of passengers and landings. There are around 10 daily flights to Helsinki. Oulu Airport is also extensively used by the Finnish Air Force for training purposes and the managing body of the airport is Finavia. Oulu Airport has offered free wireless network access for passengers since May 2007.

== History ==
The construction of the airport runways in Oulunsalo began in 1949 and was completed in 1953 after the previous airport in Oritkari became too outdated for modern aircraft. In 1953 the airport only consisted of gravel runways and it wasn&#x27;t until 1958 that the terminal and ATC building were built and the runways were paved. Finnair back then &quot;Aero&quot; operated routes from the airport with DC-3 aircraft and started flights with Sud Aviation Caravelle jets from Oulu in 1964. The current terminal building was built to replace the old one in 1973 and expanded/renovated in 2002 and 2011 with the old one being demolished in the fall of 2005. The second runway of the airport was removed in the early 2000s and the current ATC tower was built in 1998.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===

The old terminal of the airport was demolished in 2005 for more apron space and a major extension of the main terminal was completed in September 2011. Four new jetbridge gates (gates 13–16) were constructed and the main terminal was expanded by , raising the capacity of the airport to 1.5 million passengers per year. The terminal has three cafes, one before security and two in the gate area which also has a bar &quot;Oluthuone Toppila&quot; and a duty-free shop. There&#x27;s also a designated smoking area and a grand piano that can be played by visitors.

===Runway===
Oulu Airport has one runway, 12/30, which is long and wide. Runway 12 is equipped with Category II Instrument landing system. The runway was renewed in summer 2017.

<doc id="731096" wikidata="Q1852384" url="?curid=731096" title="Mazda Millenia">
<text>The Mazda Millenia (officially written as millenia) is an automobile manufactured by Mazda in Japan from 1993 to 2002. The Millenia was originally planned as the one of the first models for Mazda&#x27;s proposed luxury brand Amati. 

At the time of its release, it was the first and only production car in the world to employ a Miller cycle engine, a design which Mazda would not use again for six more years until the second generation Mazda2. 

Having been developed for a separate market from typical Mazda customers was engineered to far greater levels of perceived quality than existing Mazda cars, such as interior plastic quality, panel gap and thicker paint coating, with Mazda claiming this attention to detail was intended to set &quot;standards for at least ten years&quot;.

== Plans for Amati ==
&quot;See also Amati Cars&quot;

The Millenia was originally intended to be named the Amati 500 and was to serve as the first model to launch Mazda&#x27;s new luxury brand Amati, which itself was announced in February 1992 for a planned launch in 1994. In June of the same year, Amati produced a logo and announced plans for a $75 million marketing campaign with Los Angeles-based Lord, Dentsu &amp; Partners planned to start at the end of 1993. Mazda expected to sell 20,000 a year in 1994 and to double that by 1995.

The recession caused by the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble led to the cancellation of Amati by October 1992, and by November 1993 it was decided to sell the Millenia as a Mazda instead.

== Branding post-Amati ==
As the company&#x27;s finances dwindled due to the collapse of the &quot;bubble economy&quot;, Mazda scrapped the launch of the Amati brand. Instead, the car was rebadged underMazda&#x27;s various sub-bands with differing model names depending on the market. There was no equivalent version offered by Mazda&#x27;s Ẽfini or Autozam.

=== Europe ===
Mazda of Europe sold the Mazda Xedos 9 between 1993 and 2002. There was also a smaller Mazda Xedos 6 offered at the same time.

=== Japan &amp; Australia ===
Source:

Marketed as the Eunos 800 in Japan and Australia from 1993 through 1998, while the Miller Cycle-equipped version was known as the Eunos 800M. Yaw-sensitive four-wheel steering was available as an option in Japan; Mazda claimed that with this feature, the Millenia was capable of passing the elk test at speeds comparable to the BMW 850i and Nissan 300ZX.

Like in Europe, it was sold alongside the smaller Xedos 6, which itself was rebranded as the Eunos 500. 

In July 1997, the Eunos 800 was renamed to Mazda Millenia when Mazda discontinued the Eunos brand.

==== Eunos 800M SP ====
Mazda Motorsport Australia released a limited edition Eunos 800M SP with improved suspension and larger alloy wheel and tire combination, but with no modifications to the engine.

=== North America ===
Launched in North America in 1994 (as a 1995 model year), the Mazda millenia replaced the Mazda 929 as the brand&#x27;s flagship sedan offering in North America. While the 929 had been the last non-luxury rear-wheel drive Japanese import sedan in the US, the Millenia was front-wheel drive. Unlike the other markets, there was no equivalent version of the Mazda Xedos 6/Eunos 500 in the US or Canada.

The Millenia was available in three models: the base model, the mid-level millenia L with standard leather upholstery, power moonroof and remote keyless entry, and the top-of-the-line millenia S model which featured traction control, heated front seats, heavy duty wipers and the supercharged 2.3-liter V6 Miller cycle engine.

Reception was generally positive, with reviewers praising the vehicle&#x27;s combination of interior quality, engine performance, and overall value as superior to contemporary competitors like the BMW 3-series, Infiniti i30, Acura TL, Lexus ES300, and Mercedes C280.

==== US Market Sales ====

&quot;(* Note: Monthly sales data could not be found for calendar year 2000, however the total sales for that year can be found in a year-over-year sales comparison table in the Automotive News Market Data Book for calendar year 2001&quot;&quot;)&quot;

==Facelift==
The vehicle received a minor facelift in 1997 primarily focused on cost-saving measures. For instance, the hood was downgraded from aluminum to steel. This first facelift was also accompanied by a name change from Eunos 800 to Mazda Millenia in the Japanese market.

The Millenia was more dramatically facelifted for the 2001 model year, with most modifications updating the front and rear bumpers and grille.

== Discontinuation ==
While production ceased in September 2002 with the final 35 units, in the United States there were still new Millenia sales as late as July 2004.

The Millenia did not have a direct predecessor or replacement in the Mazda product line. The end of production coincided with the introduction of the Mazda6 in 2002, which also served as replacement for Mazda&#x27;s other, contemporaneous mid-sized sedan, the Mazda 626.

<doc id="731104" wikidata="Q1353299" url="?curid=731104" title="William Joseph Chaminade">
<text>Guillaume-Joseph Chaminade, SM (also known as William Joseph Chaminade; Périgueux, 8 April 1761 – Bordeaux, 22 January 1850) was a French Catholic priest who survived persecution during the French Revolution and later founded the Society of Mary, usually called the Marianists, in 1817. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 3 September 2000. His feast day is celebrated on 22 January.

The Marianist Family&#x27;s other three branches — the religious sisters known as the Daughters of Mary Immaculate, the married and single men and women of the Marianist Lay Communities, and the consecrated laywomen of the Alliance Mariale — also look to Chaminade as a founder or inspiration.

==Early life==
Chaminade was born in 1761 in Périgueux to Catherine Bethon and Blaise Chaminade, in the former province of Périgord, now the Department of Dordogne. He was the 14th child of deeply religious parents. Three of his brothers became priests. Feeling called to serve in this way as well, he entered a minor seminary in Mussidan at the age of ten. He was ordained a priest in 1785 for the local diocese. 

==Revolutionary era==
In 1790, after the start of the French Revolution, Chaminade moved to Bordeaux. There he became an enemy of the state by defying the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which would have required him to take an oath affirming the Revolution&#x27;s secular values and disclaiming the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. He secretly continued to work as a priest, risking a possible death penalty. One of his allies in this work was Marie-Thérèse Charlotte de Lamourous, whom he later assisted in founding Bordeaux&#x27;s &quot;Miséricorde&quot; (House of Mercy) for &quot;fallen women&quot;.

In 1795, when the national government sought to work with the non-juring clergy, Chaminade accepted responsibility for supervising the reconciliation of the clergy of Bordeaux who had taken the Constitutional Oath but wanted to make peace with the Catholic Church; about fifty such priests completed their reconciliation with his help. After the Coup of 18 Fructidor by the French Directory in 1797, he fled the country and found refuge for three years in Zaragoza, Spain

While living there, he would regularly visit the Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar out of his strong devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. As a result of his prayer he developed a vision for restoring the Catholic faith to France. To this end, he decided to build an organization of both lay and religious Order members, taking the Virgin Mary as the model of a perfect disciple of Jesus.

==Founder==
When he returned to Bordeaux in November 1800, he re-established the Marian Sodality, which he hoped would promote the desecularization of France by offering &quot;the spectacle of a people of saints&quot;. He saw the development of the young lay movement as the prime focus of his mission. In this he was opposed by the traditionalist forces in the Church, both clergy and lay, who saw the re-creation of the privileges and institutions of the pre-Revolutionary Church as the true goal of their restoration of the faith in France. In 1824 Chaminade published a reply to that line of thinking in which he stated, &quot;The levers that move the moral world somehow need a new fulcrum.&quot;

The sodality spread to other cities, and the Holy See recognized his efforts by appointing him Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Bazas and later, in 1801, naming him an &quot;Apostolic Missionary&quot; to the region, confirming its trust in him.

Some sodalitists wanted to make a more complete commitment to the Church, so Chaminade, along with the Adèle de Batz de Trenquelléon, founded the Institute of the Daughters of Mary Immaculate in Agen in 1816. A year later, he founded the Society of Mary at Bordeaux. Both religious institutes devoted themselves to teaching. Chaminade sought to establish a network of schools to train Catholic teachers, but this effort was checked by the 1830 Revolution. However, both of Chaminade&#x27;s religious institutes continued to grow: the Daughters of Mary founded schools in south-western France to educate rural women and the Society of Mary expanded in France and spread to Switzerland(1839) and the United States of America (1849).

==Death==
The last ten years of Chaminade&#x27;s life were filled with problems of health, finances and obstacles to his vision in the administration of the Society. He was replaced in January 1846 as Superior General by a General Chapter, which he considered illegitimate, called by members of the General Council of the Society, with the approval of the Holy See. Partially paralyzed, he thereafter was left in virtual isolation by the government of the Society.

Chaminade died in Bordeaux in 1850, surrounded by members of the Society he had founded. His tomb is located in the city.

==Veneration==

The process of inquiry for the cause of Chaminade&#x27;s canonization was opened in 1909, with testimony taken in until 1912 in France and Spain, where he had lived. Chaminade&#x27;s spiritual writings were approved by theologians on 3 March 1916, and his cause was officially opened in Rome on 8 May 1918, granting him the title of Servant of God. Study on the matter continued until 1973, when Chaminade was declared Venerable by Pope Paul VI.

===Miracle worker===

====Argentina====
In 1995 the healing from lung cancer of Elena Otera, a resident of Buenos Aires, was studied as a possible miracle to be attributed to the intercession of Chaminade. After a positive conclusion in the local inquiry conducted by the Marianist Postulator of the cause, the matter was referred to the Vatican for investigation. The medical boards consulted by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints finally declared her healing as &quot;scientifically inexplicable&quot; in January 1999. A review of the cause then took place by the theologians and bishops of the Congregation. They voted unanimously in favor of declaring a miracle that following October. This was approved by Pope John Paul II, who beatified Chaminade in 2000.

====United States====
Rachel Baumgartner, then a high school student in St. Louis, Missouri, in the United States, was diagnosed in December 1998 with Askin&#x27;s tumor, a kind of sarcoma. She underwent emergency surgery to have the tumor removed, followed by chemotherapy and radiation. She was a member of the Parish of Our Lady of the Pillar, founded and staffed by the Marianists, and was chosen to attend the ceremony for Chaminade&#x27;s beatification in Rome in 2000. Early the next year the tumor was found to have re-appeared in her bone marrow, for which she underwent a stem cell transplant, which had a severe negative impact on her health. The tumor was found to have re-developed between her heart, lung and spine in November 2002.

Baumgartner was advised that no one had ever survived when this occurred after such a transplant, and that she had only a few weeks to live. After a year and a half, however, the tumor (which was the size of a small Nerf football) stopped growing and had not damaged the organs around it. In 2004 a noted surgeon removed the tumor, finding that it had died with almost no treatment, which was medically unexplainable. Baumgartner, now married and named Rachel Lozano, attributed this to the intercession of Chaminade. The Marianist pastor of the parish referred this matter to the Superior General of the Society of Mary, who in turn requested that the local bishop, the Archbishop of St. Louis, conduct a formal inquiry. The investigation was concluded in July 2010 and forwarded by the Archdiocese and the Marianists to Rome for judgment.

<doc id="731105" wikidata="Q29339" url="?curid=731105" title="Maniche">
<text>Nuno Ricardo de Oliveira Ribeiro (born 11 November 1977), known as Maniche (), is a Portuguese retired professional footballer who played as a central midfielder.

He played top-flight football in Portugal, Russia, England, Spain, Italy and Germany, and in 2004 he helped Porto to the Champions League, one of eight trophies won with that club. He amassed Primeira Liga totals of 177 matches and 31 goals in seven seasons.

Maniche won 52 caps for Portugal, representing the nation at Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup and finishing runner-up in the former competition.

==Club career==
===Benfica and Porto===
Born in Lisbon, Maniche played youth football for local S.L. Benfica. After three seasons with neighbouring F.C. Alverca, who acted as the former&#x27;s farm team, he returned to Benfica, where he was initially deployed as a winger.

Following disciplinary problems at Benfica, Maniche was signed by José Mourinho for FC Porto. The manager made him a key member of his sides, reconverting him to central midfielder.

Maniche enjoyed a successful period at Porto, winning both the UEFA Cup in 2003 and the UEFA Champions League in 2004 and contributing 13 goals in 60 matches as the club also managed back-to-back Primeira Liga titles. He was chosen Man of the match in the 2004 Intercontinental Cup, which his team won on penalties against Once Caldas of Colombia.

===Dynamo and Chelsea===
Maniche was sold to FC Dynamo Moscow in May 2005, for €16 million; he was accompanied in that adventure by Porto teammates Giourkas Seitaridis and Costinha (another club player, Derlei, had left for the Russian team in January). Unsettled, as were the vast majority of foreign players bought by new owner Alexey Fedorychev, he left in January 2006 on loan to Premier League side Chelsea.

Maniche was part of Chelsea&#x27;s 2006 league-winning squad. In his first start, a home game against West Ham United on 9 April, he had an opportunity to score an equaliser from six yards out but smashed his shot against the crossbar, and was shown an immediate red card in the 17th minute for a challenge on Lionel Scaloni; nevertheless, they went on to win 4–1.

However, Maniche did not make enough appearances in the league to earn a winners&#x27; medal, challenged for a central midfield place by Michael Essien, Frank Lampard and Claude Makélélé. Chelsea had the option of making the transfer permanent at the end of the season, for £5 million (US$9 million), but the player eventually returned to Dynamo Moscow.

===Atlético Madrid===
Maniche was signed by Atlético Madrid in late August 2006. Partnering his compatriots Costinha and Zé Castro, he scored four goals in 28 La Liga matches in his first season in a seventh-place finish.

Following a run-in with Atlético coach, Javier Aguirre, Maniche was cut from the squad, and agreed to join Inter Milan on a January loan, running for the second part of 2007–08. Splitting time between the bench and the starting eleven in eight Serie A appearances, he managed to score one goal, in a 1–2 home defeat to Juventus FC on 22 March, also hitting the post in stoppage time.

In July 2008, Maniche returned to Atlético Madrid, playing a major part in the &quot;Colchoneros&quot;&#x27; early season as they had returned to the UEFA Champions League after a 12-year absence. In late February 2009, however, he was ousted after a new quarrel with the management, now led by former club player Abel Resino.

According to additional reports in the Spanish press, Maniche was deemed surplus to requirements in Madrid after he rejected the club&#x27;s offer of a new deal, as his contract was going to expire on 30 June 2009.
&quot;We informed Maniche three or four weeks ago that we wanted to renew his contract&quot;, said Atlético&#x27;s general manager Miguel Ángel Gil Marín.&quot;

&quot;We really wanted him to accept the conditions and sign the contract. It is a shame for us.&quot;
 
Maniche was released on 6 May 2009.

===1. FC Köln===
On 20 July 2009, Maniche moved to the Bundesliga with 1. FC Köln, signing a two-year deal and rejoining former Benfica and Portugal teammate Petit. He scored the first of his three goals on 27 October, closing the 3–0 away victory over SV Eintracht Trier 05 in the last 16 of the DFB-Pokal.

===Return to Portugal===
Maniche left after only one season in Germany, and on 16 June 2010 he returned to his native country, signing a one-year deal (plus an option for two further seasons) with the club he still had not represented in the Portuguese Big Three, Sporting CP. Frequently injured during his spell with the &quot;Lions&quot; and vastly underperforming, the 33-year-old terminated his contract by mutual consent – even though he had automatically renewed it in December after appearing in his 20th competitive game– on 6 July 2011; in May of the following year, not being able to find a new team, he decided to retire.

On 12 June 2013, Maniche was appointed as assistant at F.C. Paços de Ferreira after his former Porto and international teammate Costinha was hired as the manager. Three years later, he was hired in the same role alongside the same boss at Segunda Liga side Académica de Coimbra, but left four months later for personal reasons.

==International career==
Maniche made his debut for the Portugal national team on 29 March 2003, in a 2–1 friendly win over Brazil. He was a key element in the country&#x27;s runner-up run at UEFA Euro 2004, scoring in a 2–0 group stage defeat of Russia and adding another in the semi-finals against the Netherlands, which ended in a 2–1 victory; he was subsequently selected for the Team of the Tournament.

On 21 June 2006, in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Portugal played Mexico in the final group fixture. Maniche netted in the sixth minute in an eventual 2–1 win that sealed the group win. Four days later, in the round of 16, as the national side faced the Netherlands once again, he scored the only goal of the game, and was the only Portuguese player to feature on Adidas&#x27; Golden Ball shortlist.

After appearing significantly during the qualifying stages for Euro 2008, he was surprisingly left out of the nation&#x27;s final squad, although younger brother Jorge Ribeiro would make the final cut. He also featured little during the qualification for the 2010 World Cup, and was subsequently left out of the squad for the final stages by manager Carlos Queiroz.

==Style of play==
Known for his teamwork, stamina and powerful shot, Maniche received his nickname after Benfica&#x27;s 1980s Danish forward Michael Manniche.

==Personal life==
Jorge Ribeiro, Maniche&#x27;s younger brother, was also a footballer. Mainly a left midfielder, he also represented Benfica amongst many other clubs, and the two were teammates at Dynamo Moscow.

<text>Ryan Rodney Reynolds (born October 23, 1976) is a Canadian and American actor, producer, and businessman. He began his career starring in the Canadian teen soap opera &quot;Hillside&quot; (1991–1993) and had minor roles before landing the lead role on the sitcom &quot;Two Guys and a Girl&quot; between 1998 and 2001. Reynolds then starred in a range of films, including the comedies &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Van Wilder&quot; (2002), &quot;Waiting...&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Proposal&quot; (2009), and the superhero films &quot;&quot; (2004), and &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (2011).

Reynolds&#x27;s biggest commercial success came with the superhero films &quot;Deadpool&quot; (2016), &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; (2018), and &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024), in which he played the title character. His performance in the first earned him a nomination for a Golden Globe Award. He has since starred in the drama &quot;Woman in Gold&quot; (2015), the horror film &quot;Life&quot; (2017), and the action films &quot;6 Underground&quot; (2019), &quot;Free Guy&quot; (2021), and &quot;The Adam Project&quot; (2022). Reynolds also provided voice acting in &quot;The Croods&quot; franchise (2013–2020), &quot;Turbo&quot; (2013) and &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot; (2019), in which he voiced the title character.

Reynolds was named &quot;People&quot;″s Sexiest Man Alive in 2010 and was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2017. As a businessman, he holds an ownership stake in Mint Mobile and is a co-owner of Welsh football club Wrexham; the latter is documented in the Emmy Award-winning television series &quot;Welcome to Wrexham&quot;. In 2020, Reynolds sold his ownership stake of Aviation Gin to Diageo as part of a $610 million deal. He also sits on the board of the Match Group.

==Early life==
Ryan Rodney Reynolds was born on October 23, 1976, in Vancouver, British Columbia. He is the youngest of four sons. His father, James Chester Reynolds, was a Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman before retiring from the force and going to work as a foods wholesaler. His mother, Tamara Lee (née Stewart), worked in retail sales. Reynolds has two brothers who work in law enforcement in British Columbia, one of whom followed their father into the RCMP. His paternal grandfather, Chester Reynolds, was a farmer who represented Stettler in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1940 to 1944. Reynolds has Irish and Scottish ancestry, and was raised Catholic in Vancouver&#x27;s Kitsilano neighbourhood and Vanier, Ontario (now a neighbourhood in Ottawa).

Reynolds has been involved in acting since age thirteen. He graduated from Kitsilano Secondary School in 1994, which he attended with actor Joshua Jackson. Reynolds played small roles in a number of television series, but became discouraged and quit acting at age 19 to enroll at Kwantlen Polytechnic University. A few months later he ran into fellow actor Chris William Martin, who convinced him to try again and move with him to Los Angeles.

==Career==
===1991–2003: Early work===
Reynolds&#x27;s career began in 1991 when he starred as Billy Simpson in the Canadian-produced teen soap opera &quot;Hillside&quot;, distributed in the United States by Nickelodeon as &quot;Fifteen&quot;. In 1993, Reynolds played a child who moves from India to Canada after the death of his father in the film &quot;Ordinary Magic&quot;. Between 1993 and 1994, he had a recurring role in &quot;The Odyssey&quot; as Macro. In 1996, he had a supporting role as Jay &quot;Boom&quot; DeBoom in &quot;Syzygy&quot;, the thirteenth episode of the third season of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, and co-starred with Melissa Joan Hart in the TV movie &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;. In 1996, Reynolds played Bobby Rupp, boyfriend of murdered teen Nancy Clutter, in a two-part miniseries, &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, an adaptation of Truman Capote&#x27;s non-fiction novel of the same name. He also appeared in the anthology &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; episode &quot;Origin of the Species&quot;, which originally aired on November 14, 1998. Beginning in 1998, Reynolds starred in &quot;Two Guys, A Girl and a Pizza Place&quot; (later renamed &quot;Two Guys and a Girl&quot;), playing medical student Michael &quot;Berg&quot; Bergen throughout the show&#x27;s four-season run. He starred in the National Lampoon movie &quot;Van Wilder&quot; in 2002, appeared in &quot;The In-Laws&quot; with Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks, and also in the Canadian production &quot;Foolproof&quot; in 2003.

===2004–2015: Romantic comedies and widespread recognition===

Although he had performed primarily in comedies, Reynolds underwent intense physical training to play an action role as the character of Hannibal King in the 2004 film &quot;&quot;. The same year, he made a cameo appearance in &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle&quot; as a nurse. Reynolds played George Lutz in the 2005 remake of the 1979 horror film &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot;. Also in 2005, he played a waiter named Monty in &quot;Waiting...&quot; and appeared as music executive Chris Brander in the romantic comedy &quot;Just Friends&quot; alongside Amy Smart and Anna Faris. In &quot;Just Friends&quot;, Reynolds lip-synced &quot;I Swear&quot; over the end credits. Additionally, he played an FBI agent alongside Ray Liotta in the 2006 crime action film &quot;Smokin&#x27; Aces&quot;. Reynolds played the protagonist in the 2008 film &quot;Definitely, Maybe&quot;. He also appeared in the second-season finale of the television series &quot;Scrubs&quot;. In 2007, Reynolds guest-starred as Brendan&#x27;s friend Hams in the episode &quot;Douchebag in the City&quot; of the TBS sitcom &quot;My Boys&quot;.

Reynolds portrayed Wade Wilson / Weapon XI in a supporting role in the prequel 20th Century Fox &quot;X-Men&quot; film, &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;, which was released in 2009. He had previously spoken of his interest and involvement in a possible film adaptation of Deadpool with screenwriter David S. Goyer as far back as 2005. 2009 also saw Reynolds portray Andrew Paxton, opposite Sandra Bullock, in &quot;The Proposal&quot;, and Mike Connell in &quot;Adventureland&quot;.

In 2010, Reynolds starred in the Spanish and American thriller &quot;Buried&quot;, which screened at the Sundance Film Festival. In June 2010, Reynolds was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Reynolds portrayed the Hal Jordan version of superhero Green Lantern in Warner Bros.&#x27; film &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, which was released on June 17, 2011. The film did not fare well either financially or critically, but his role made him one of the few actors to have headlined films based on both Marvel and DC characters. In 2011, he co-starred in the comedy &quot;The Change-Up&quot;, as well as narrating the documentary film &quot;The Whale&quot;. In 2012, he portrayed an agent in &quot;Safe House&quot;, alongside Denzel Washington. He then had starring roles in two DreamWorks Animation feature films, &quot;The Croods&quot; and &quot;Turbo&quot;, both released in 2013. His next role was portraying Nick Walker in the Universal Pictures film adaptation of Dark Horse Comics&#x27; &quot;R.I.P.D.&quot; (&quot;Rest in Peace Department&quot;), which was released in 2013. Reynolds went on to star in low-budget films, &quot;The Voices&quot; and &quot;The Captive&quot; in 2014, as well as &quot;Mississippi Grind&quot; the following year. This was followed by a supporting role in the financially successful biographical film &quot;Woman in Gold&quot; before he returned to the thriller genre with &quot;Self/Less&quot;, also in 2015.

===2015–present: Established actor and Marvel work===
In 2016, Reynolds found critical and commercial success with &quot;Deadpool&quot;, a film that had been in development as early as 2000. After portraying Wade Wilson / Weapon XI, in &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;, he became heavily involved in the development of a Deadpool film. &quot;Deadpool&quot; featured a reboot of the character, ignoring the events of &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;, and establishing a new backstory for the character that was closer to the Marvel Comics source material. Reynolds chose not to get paid from his performance as Deadpool so the film could be released, and spent the &quot;little salary&quot; he had so that co-writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick would be on set alongside him. The film takes place within the larger 20th Century Fox &quot;X-Men&quot; film universe, being made possible by the reset timeline in &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;. &quot;Deadpool&quot; made several box-office records, including a worldwide opening of $264.9 million from 62 markets, which was the biggest of 2016, the biggest for an R-rated film, and the second biggest for Fox behind only &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; ($303.9 million). It also recorded the biggest IMAX 2D worldwide opening of all time with $27.4 million from 606 IMAX theatres, eclipsing &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; ($23.8 million). The film&#x27;s financial and critical success led the studio to move forward with a sequel.

Also in 2016, Reynolds had a supporting role in the Ariel Vromen-directed thriller &quot;Criminal&quot;. On December 15, 2016, Reynolds received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard. Reynolds co-starred with Jake Gyllenhaal and Rebecca Ferguson in the science fiction thriller &quot;Life&quot; in 2017, which reunited him with &quot;Safe House&quot; director Daniel Espinosa. Reynolds began filming &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; in June 2017. The film opened on May 18, 2018. In May 2019, he starred as the titular character in &quot;Pokémon Detective Pikachu&quot;, a live action film adaptation of the &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot; video game. Reynolds voiced, and was the facial motion capture actor for the CGI detective Pikachu.

In January 2019, it was announced that he would return as the voice of Guy in the sequel to &quot;The Croods&quot;. The film, &quot;The Croods: A New Age&quot;, was also released in 2020.

In 2021, Reynolds starred in three films. The first, &quot;Hitman&#x27;s Wife&#x27;s Bodyguard&quot;, is an action comedy film directed by Patrick Hughes and written by Tom O&#x27;Connor and Brandon and Phillip Murphy. The film is a sequel to the 2017 film &quot;The Hitman&#x27;s Bodyguard&quot; which also featured Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson, Salma Hayek, and Richard E. Grant, who reprised their roles. Beginning April 2019, Reynolds shot his second 2021 film, science fiction action comedy film &quot;Free Guy&quot;, directed by Shawn Levy, from a screenplay by Matt Lieberman and Zak Penn, and a story by Lieberman. Reynolds stars as &quot;a background character who realizes he&#x27;s living in a video game. With the help of an avatar, he tries to prevent the makers of the game from shutting down his world.&quot; Also featuring Jodie Comer, Lil Rel Howery, Utkarsh Ambudkar, Joe Keery and Taika Waititi, the film was theatrically released in the United States on August 13 by 20th Century Studios. In his last film of the year, Reynolds starred alongside Dwayne Johnson and Gal Gadot in Netflix&#x27;s thriller &quot;Red Notice&quot;, written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber.

<text>The World Bowl was the annual American football championship game of the World League of American Football, later called NFL Europe. The World Bowl was played each year from 1991 to 2007 (except 1993 and 1994).

The first World Bowl was played in 1991 in London. With the 1995 relaunch of the World League with the North American teams removed, all subsequent World Bowls were played in Europe between European clubs. The only World Bowl to take place outside Europe was World Bowl &#x27;92 in Montreal, Canada.

The World Bowl trophy was a globe made of glass measuring 35.5 cm (14 inches) in diameter and weighing 18.6 kg (41 lbs).

==Overview==

When the World League of American Football (WLAF) was founded in 1991, with teams in North America and Europe as well as expansion plans for Asia, the name World Bowl was appropriate. The name was kept after 1995 when the league limited itself exclusively to Europe.

From 1995 to 1997, the World Bowl venue was decided by the standings after five weeks of the 10-week season. In other years, the sites were predetermined before the season. The 2002 World Bowl was hosted in Rhein Fire&#x27;s hometown of Düsseldorf as a farewell to the old Rheinstadion. After the new LTU Arena (now Merkur Spiel-Arena) was completed, the 2005 World Bowl was hosted there again. It would return in 2006, the first time that the game was played in the same site in consecutive years. As the city&#x27;s Fortuna Düsseldorf team spent much of this time in lower tiers of the German soccer pyramid, Düsseldorf was the rare NFL Europe city in which American football held an arguably competitive position.

Nine World Bowls were played on Saturdays and six World Bowls were played on Sundays (1991, 1996–1999, 2000).

==World Bowl (WLAF, NFL Europe, and NFL Europa Championships)==
*Note: Roman numerals were not officially used by NFL Europe until World Bowl IX. Before 2001, the games were titled with the current year, such as World Bowl 2000.

===Team records===

===Results by country===
===Hosting cities===
While the Olympic stadiums in Montreal, Amsterdam and Barcelona hosted World Bowls, the league never selected Berlin as a host town, though the city&#x27;s Thunder played in the Olympiastadion from 2003 to 2007.

==Other uses of &quot;World Bowl&quot;==
The former World Football League, a short-lived 1970s competitor to the NFL, was the first to name its championship game the World Bowl. In World Bowl I, the only WFL World Bowl contested, the Birmingham Americans defeated the Florida Blazers 22–21 on December 5, 1974, at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. The game had been scheduled to be played at the Gator Bowl Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, but after the Jacksonville Sharks folded mid-season, the league decided that the team with the better record would host the game.

The proposed World Indoor Football League that was to begin play in 1988 also intended on calling its championship the World Bowl. It would have been played on August 29, 1988. However, the WIFL disbanded 11 days before its season was to begin.

<text>George Braxton Pegram (October 24, 1876 – August 12, 1958) was an American physicist who played a key role in the technical administration of the Manhattan Project. He graduated from Trinity College (now Duke University) in 1895, and taught high school before becoming a teaching assistant in physics at Columbia University in 1900. He was to spend the rest of his working life at Columbia, taking his doctorate there in 1903 and becoming a full professor in 1918. His administrative career began as early as 1913 when he became the department&#x27;s executive officer. By 1918, he was Dean of the Faculty of Applied Sciences but he resigned in 1930 to relaunch his research activities, performing many meticulous measurements on the properties of neutrons with John R. Dunning. He was also chairman of Columbia&#x27;s physics department from 1913 to 1945.

Returning to administration as Dean in 1936, Pegram met Enrico Fermi on his arrival in the United States. In 1940 he brokered a meeting between Fermi and the US Navy at which the prospect of an atomic bomb was raised with the military for the first time. Following Marcus Oliphant&#x27;s mission to the United States in August 1941 to alert the Americans to its feasibility, Pegram and his colleague Harold C. Urey led a diplomatic mission to the United Kingdom to establish co-operation on development of the atomic bomb. They soon found themselves on Vannevar Bush&#x27;s S-1 Section coordinating technical research. Columbia&#x27;s physics department was home to the SAM Laboratories, where many of the key technologies required for the bomb were developed.

After the war Pegram helped found the Brookhaven National Laboratory. He served as vice president of the university 1949 to 1950.

==Early life==
George Braxton Pegram was born in Trinity, North Carolina, one of the five children of William Howell Pegram, a professor of chemistry at Trinity College (now Duke University), and Emma, daughter of Braxton Craven, the college&#x27;s founder and first president. He had two brothers and two sisters, all of whom graduated from Trinity College. His upbringing in the academic atmosphere of the campus left him with an appetite for careful methodical work and an inherent diplomacy.

Pegram graduated from Trinity College with a Bachelor of Arts (AB) degree in 1895, served briefly as the college librarian, and then became a high school teacher. He entered Columbia University in 1900, becoming an assistant in physics. He published his first two papers, on radioactive materials, the following year, and wrote his 1903 Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) thesis on &quot;Secondary radioactivity in the electrolysis of thorium solutions&quot;. It was published in the Physical Review that year. During the summer break in 1905, he worked for the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey on measuring the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field at its observation stations.

In those days, promising American scholars in physics would normally further their education overseas. Pegram was awarded a John Tyndall Fellowship for this purpose in 1907, and went to Germany, where he attended lectures at the Humboldt University of Berlin given by Max Planck and Walther Nernst. In 1908, he moved on to the University of Cambridge in England, where he heard lectures given by Sir Joseph Larmor. In his travels he visited some twenty European universities, and he met Florence Bement, a Wellesley College graduate from Boston. They renewed their acquaintance after they returned to the United States, and were married at her aunt&#x27;s home in West Newton, Massachusetts on June 3, 1909. They had two sons, William, born in 1910, and John, born in 1916.

==Early career==
On returning to the United States in 1909, Pegram was appointed an assistant professor at Columbia. He became an associate professor in 1912, and a full professor in 1918. He became the head of the physics department on the death of William Hallock in 1913, and held this position until 1945. He also became acting Dean of Columbia&#x27;s School of Mines, Engineering, and Chemistry in 1917, and was its dean from 1918 until 1930. During World War I he served on the administrative board of the Student Army Training Corps at Columbia. Classes commenced on October 1, 1918, with some 2,500 students. He was also dean of the US Army Radio School, US Army School of Photography, and US Army School of Explosives there, and was Director of Research of the United States Army Signal Corps.

In 1917 and 1918, Pegram served on a committee established by the National Research Council headed by the President of Columbia University, Nicholas Murray Butler, with Michael I. Pupin as its secretary, that created a quartz piezo-electric sound detector for locating submerged submarines. The device worked, and the Naval Experimental Station at New London, Connecticut, took over its development in September 1918. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by Duke University in 1918.

Tired of administrative work, which kept him away from his research, Pegram asked Butler to relieve him of the position of dean in 1930. This request was accepted, in spite of Pegram&#x27;s demonstrated ability as an administrator. His achievements included the construction of the Pupin Physics Laboratories. Pegram was intimately involved in its design, insisting on a structure without load bearing internal walls, so that it could be reconfigured over time, and with large two-storey lecture theatres. He attempted to expose his physics students to ideas from Europe, inviting Hendrik Lorentz, Larmor, Planck, Max Born and Werner Heisenberg to visit Columbia.

Pegram&#x27;s research focus remained on radioactivity. In 1929, he had recruited a graduate student, John R. Dunning, from Nebraska Wesleyan University, who built a linear amplifier. In 1935 and 1936 Dunning was able construct a cyclotron using many salvaged parts to reduce costs and funding from industrial and private donations. James Chadwick&#x27;s discovery of the neutron in 1932 sparked a flurry of research into neutrons by Pegram and Dunning. Between 1933 and 1936, they would work together on two dozen papers, all on neutrons. He also collaborated with Harold Urey on separating oxygen isotopes. This period came to an abrupt end when Howard Lee McBain died suddenly on May 7, 1936, and Pegram became dean again on January 1, 1937.

A sympathetic administrator proved vital to building up the physics department at Columbia. Pegram hired Isidor Isaac Rabi as a theoretical physicist on Heisenberg&#x27;s advice. Rabi would later succeed Pegram as chairman of the physics department. When Pegram heard that Nobel Prize-winning physicist Enrico Fermi wanted to emigrate to the United States with his family to escape Italian Racial Laws that affected his Jewish wife Laura, Pegram was quick to offer a position at Columbia. Recruiting Fermi was a coup; he had offers from four other universities, and Pegram was on the wharf to greet Fermi on his arrival in New York on January 2, 1939. Pegram supported the work of Leo Szilard, granting him access to facilities and laboratory space in the Pupin Physics Laboratories. Other scientists working at Columbia in 1939 included Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, G. Norris Glasoe, Francis G. Slack and Walter Zinn, making it one of the world&#x27;s most important centers for nuclear physics.

==Manhattan Project==
The discovery of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, followed by its explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch in December 1938, ignited a flurry of activity, with nearly one hundred articles on the subject published by the end of 1939. At Columbia, Enrico Fermi and John R. Dunning were quick to verify Hahn&#x27;s and Strassmann&#x27;s results, and there was a lively debate over whether uranium-235 or its more abundant uranium-238 isotope was primarily responsible. Two groups began working at Columbia on attempting to create a nuclear chain reaction in natural uranium. Both were in the Pupin Physics Laboratories, but working independently, at least initially, and on different floors: Fermi and Anderson in the basement, and Szilard and Zin on the seventh floor.

In March 1939, Fermi, Szilard and Eugene Wigner met with Pegram in his office, and urged that their results be brought to the attention of the government. Pegram knew Charles Edison, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and arranged for Fermi to meet with Rear Admiral Stanford C. Hooper, the technical assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations. Echoing sentiments his father had articulated back in 1911, Pegram informed Hooper that uranium chain reaction might &quot;liberate a million times as much energy per pound as any known explosive.&quot; Szilard, Wigner and Albert Einstein took their concerns to the President Franklin Roosevelt in the Einstein-Szilard letter. This prompted the creation of an Advisory Committee on Uranium under Lyman J. Briggs, the director of the National Bureau of Standards. On March 11, 1941, Pegram informed the Committee that it was &quot;very doubtful whether a chain reaction can be established without separating 235 from the rest of the uranium.&quot; He therefore recommended that efforts be concentrated on finding a means of separating the isotopes.

Initially, Fermi and Anderson had used a tank of water as a neutron moderator. The hydrogen in the water was good at slowing neutrons, which was desirable, but it also absorbed them, which was not. In July 1939, Szilard suggested using carbon in the form of graphite instead. Pegram attended the Advisory Committee on Uranium meeting on April 27, along with Fermi, Szilard and Wigner where the prospects for a chain reaction were discussed. On May 14, he was able to report that Szilard and Fermi had found that graphite indeed had a small neutron absorption cross section, and would make an effective moderator. Pegram brought in members of the football team to stack graphite blocks, and purchased uranium from the Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited in Canada. The uranium and graphite &quot;pile&quot;, as Fermi called it, soon grew too large for the Pupin Physics Laboratories. Fermi recalled that: 
By September 1941, they had built a uranium and graphite cube high there.

The Advisory Committee on Uranium was placed under Vannevar Bush&#x27;s National Defense Research Committee when it was established in June 1940, and Pegram was added to its membership. Following Mark Oliphant&#x27;s mission to the United States in August 1941 to alert the Americans to the atomic bomb&#x27;s feasibility, Pegram and his Urey led a diplomatic mission to the United Kingdom to establish co-operation on development of the atomic bomb. In December 1941, the S-1 Uranium Committee was placed directly under Bush&#x27;s Office of Scientific Research and Development, with the word &quot;uranium&quot; dropped for security reasons. James Conant became its chairman, with Pegram as his vice chairman. The United States&#x27; entry into World War II following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor gave the project a new urgency when the S-1 Committee next met on December 18, 1941.

In August 1942 the United States Army took over the effort, which became the Manhattan Project. The S-1 Committee was reorganised as the S-1 Executive Committee, and Pegram dropped out. Columbia&#x27;s physics department became home to the SAM Laboratories, where many of the key technologies required for the bomb were developed by over 700 researchers. Pegram chaired Columbia&#x27;s Committee on War Research. He worked closely with the Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory on a number of projects, most notably the development of the Magnetic Airborne Detector (MAD) at Columbia&#x27;s Airborne Instruments Laboratory at Mineola on Long Island.

==Later life==
Despite its early involvement and important role, the Manhattan Project had not been kind to Columbia. Arthur Compton had concentrated nuclear reactor research at the University of Chicago in 1942. After the war, scientists there had access to the research reactors at the government-sponsored Argonne National Laboratory, and Fermi and Urey were lured away to Chicago. When the war ended in August 1945, the Physics Department at Columbia had five vacant chairs. Filling them would be no easy task. Physicists were hailed as heroes, and every major university was eager to recruit the best ones to build up their departments. They were offered high salaries, and when they left they often took their students and post-doctoral assistants with them. Even the quintessential New Yorker Rabi was tempted to leave rather than return to Columbia from his wartime work at the MIT Radiation Laboratory. He offered to stay, but one condition: 

Rabi felt that to compete with the University of Chicago, Columbia needed to have access to a research reactor too; but the cost was greater than Columbia could afford without collaborating with other institutions, government assistance, or both. On January 16, 1946, Pegram convened a meeting of representatives of 16 different colleges, universities, hospitals and research institutions like the Bell Telephone Laboratories. The meeting drafted a request to the director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., asking him to establish a regional research laboratory near New York City. In response, Groves sent Colonel Kenneth Nichols to meet with Pegram and Rabi and their opposite numbers from Princeton University, Hugh S. Taylor and Henry D. Smyth on February 8. They found Nichols amenable to their idea; all he wanted to know was where it would be built, and who would run it.

Getting agreement on this required all of Pegram&#x27;s negotiating talents, since MIT wanted the facility located in Boston. Pegram assembled a group of nine universities, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, Penn, Rochester, and Yale, as the Initiatory University Group (IUG), and he persuaded Groves to provide initial funding for the project. Lee DuBridge was appointed as the head of the IUG. Finding a site that was both accessible and remote proved to be a challenge, but eventually one of found at Camp Upton on Long Island. The new research center became the Brookhaven National Laboratory.

Although no longer chairman of the Physics Department, Pegram remained the dean until 1949. He also chaired Columbia&#x27;s Committee on Government-Aided Research from 1945 to 1950 and again from 1951 to 1956, and vice president of the university 1949 to 1950, when Dwight Eisenhower was university president. In addition, Pegram was involved with a number of professional organizations. He attended the first meeting of the American Physical Society in 1899, and was its treasurer from 1918 to 1957, also serving as its president in 1941. He was also treasurer of Sigma Xi from 1917 to 1949, serving as its president from 1949 to 1951, and of the American Institute of Physics, which he helped to found, from 1938 to 1956, and its secretary too from 1931 to 1945. He was also a Member of both the American Philosophical Society and the United States National Academy of Sciences.

Pegram died in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania on August 12, 1958. His papers are in the Columbia University Library.

<doc id="731121" wikidata="Q2617505" url="?curid=731121" title="President Street–Medgar Evers College station">
<text>The President Street–Medgar Evers College station (originally President Street station) is a station on the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of President Street and Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn, the station is served by the 2 train at all times and the 5 train on weekdays.

== History ==

The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in Brooklyn. As part of Contract 3, the IRT agreed to build a subway line along Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn. The construction of the subway along Nostrand Avenue spurred real estate development in the surrounding areas. The Nostrand Avenue Line opened on August 23, 1920, and the President Street station opened along with it.

During the 1950s the platform was lengthened at its southern end to be able to accommodate 10-car trains which are 514 feet (157 m) long.

President Street, along with the Franklin Avenue station on the IRT Eastern Parkway Line, are the two closest stations to the City University of New York&#x27;s Medgar Evers College. In 2019, a bill to add the college&#x27;s name to both stations&#x27; names was passed in the New York state legislature and signed into law. The name of the President Street station was officially changed to &quot;President Street–Medgar Evers College&quot; on October 1, 2020, both to reflect the station&#x27;s proximity to the college and to honor the college&#x27;s namesake, civil rights figure Medgar Evers.

As part of its 2025–2029 Capital Program, the MTA has proposed making the station wheelchair-accessible in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

== Station layout ==

This deep underground station is the northernmost on the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line and the only one that has one island platform and two tracks. All stations to the south are set up as two track and two side platforms. To the north, the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line curves west and joins the local tracks of the IRT Eastern Parkway Line, where there are crossovers to the express tracks in an interlocking called Rogers Junction. The Nostrand Avenue station on that line is just two blocks north. The station is served by the 2 train at all times and by the 5 train on weekdays during the day. It is between Sterling Street to the south and Franklin Avenue to the north.

This station&#x27;s platform has wide I-beam columns painted in blue on both sides at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black station name plate with white lettering. The track walls have their original Dual Contracts trim line with &quot;P&quot; tablets on it at regular intervals for &quot;President.&quot; Towards the south end of the station, where the platform was extended in the 1950s to accommodate the current standard IRT train length of 510 feet (160 m), the walls have &quot;PRESIDENT ST&quot; in white sans serif font on a blue border.

===Exits===
The station&#x27;s only entrance/exit is near the north end of the platform. A single double-flight staircase and up-only escalator go up three stories to a small waiting area, where a turnstile bank provides entrance/exit from the system. Outside fare control, there is a token booth and two street stairs going up to both northern corners of President Street and Nostrand Avenue.

<text>The Sterling Street station is a station on the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located in Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn at the intersection of Sterling Street and Nostrand Avenue, the station is served by the 2 train at all times and the 5 train on weekdays.

== History ==
The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in Brooklyn. As part of Contract 4, the IRT agreed to build a subway line along Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn. The construction of the subway along Nostrand Avenue spurred real estate development in the surrounding areas. The Nostrand Avenue Line opened on August 23, 1920, and the Sterling Street station opened along with it.

The platforms at Sterling Street were lengthened during the 1950s to so that the platforms could accommodate 10-car trains.

As part of its 2025–2029 Capital Program, the MTA has proposed making the station wheelchair-accessible in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. 

== Station layout ==

The underground station has two tracks and two side platforms. The station is served by the 2 train at all times and by the 5 train on weekdays during the day. It is between Winthrop Street to the south and President Street–Medgar Evers College to the north. The platforms have original 1920s Dual Contracts era tiling. The name tablets have &quot;STERLING ST.&quot; in white letters on a brown background with a blue and brown border. The tile&#x27;s trim line consists of light brown coloring with a border composed of a mix of dark blue and brown coloring. An intermediate line of green runs between these two borders.

The platforms are offset at the north end, where they were extended in the 1960s (completed in 1964) and tiling from that time period was installed. The name tablets here run at regular intervals and have &quot;STERLING STREET&quot; in white letters on a brown background. Both platforms and the mezzanine have light blue I-beam columns at regular intervals. The mezzanine walls have four different large frames of drawings and paintings. It is not known who the author or what the name of this artwork is.

This is the only other station with two side platforms on the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line that allows a free transfer between directions (besides Flatbush Avenue, which uses a U-shaped set of side platforms). All stations to the south, including Flatbush Avenue, have their fare control areas on platform level.

===Exits===
The station&#x27;s only entrance/exit is a small mezzanine above the platforms towards the northern end. Inside fare control, it has two staircases going down to each platform, a newsstand, and a turnstile bank. Outside fare control, it has token booth and two street staircases leading up to both northern corners of Nostrand Avenue and Sterling Street.

From 1962 to 1964, the platforms at Winthrop Street were extended at either end to so that they could accommodate 10-car trains. Platforms at other stations along the Nostrand Avenue Line were extended at this time.

The Flatbush Avenue-bound platform closed from March 18, 2019, and reopened to the public on July 1, 2019. This was so a staircase to the platform could be replaced. Upon the Flatbush Avenue-bound platform&#x27;s reopening, the Manhattan-bound platform closed until July 29, 2019.

== Station layout ==
This underground station has two tracks and two side platforms which are slightly offset. The station is served by the 2 train at all times and by the 5 train on weekdays during the day. It is between Church Avenue to the south and Sterling Street to the north. Both platforms have their original 1920s Dual Contracts era tiling. The name tablets read &quot;WINTHROP ST.&quot; in gold lettering on a blue background with a green and brown border. The trim line consists of a light brown center surrounded by green lines and a darker brown border. &quot;W&quot; tablets on a blue background and brown border run along the trim line at regular intervals.

At either ends of each platform, where they were extended in the 1960s to accommodate the current standard &quot;A&quot; Division train length of 510 feet (160 m), there are white tiles with name tablets reading &quot;WINTHROP ST&quot; in white sans serif face spelled on a blue background at regular intervals. All columns in the station are I-beams and are painted green.

===Exits===
Each platform has one fare control area one block apart from each other and there are no crossovers or crossunders to allow free transfers between directions. The one on the Manhattan-bound side, located on platform level, has a turnstile bank, token booth, and one staircase going up to the northeast corner of Winthrop Street and Nostrand Avenue.

The fare control area on the Flatbush Avenue-bound platform is unstaffed. Two ten-step staircases go up to a mezzanine where two exit-only turnstiles and one High Entry/Exit Turnstiles provides access to/from the station. Outside fare control, there is a single staircase going up to the southwest corner of Parkside and Nostrand Avenues, one block south of the staircase to the Manhattan-bound fare control area. Mosaic directional signs on the southbound platform indicate that it used to have an exit to Winthrop Street as well.

<doc id="731129" wikidata="Q7375754" url="?curid=731129" title="Rub-a-dub-dub">
<text>&quot;Rub-a-dub-dub&quot; is an English language nursery rhyme first published at the end of the 18th century in volume two of Hook&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Box&quot; under the title &quot;Dub a dub dub&quot; rather than &quot;Rub a dub dub&quot;. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 3101.

==Lyrics==
This rhyme exists in many variations. Among those current today is:

&lt;poem&gt;
Rub-a-dub-dub,
Three men in a tub,
And who do you think they be?
The butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker,
And all of them out to sea.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Origins and meaning==
The earliest versions of this rhyme published differ significantly in their wording. Dating back to the 14th century, the original rhyme makes reference to maids in a &quot;tub&quot; – a fairground attraction similar to a modern peep show. The rhyme is of a type calling out otherwise respectable people for disrespectable actions, in this case, ogling naked ladies – the maids. The nonsense &quot;rub-a-dub-dub&quot; develops a phonetic association of social disapprobation, analogous to &quot;tsk-tsk&quot;, albeit of a more lascivious variety. The nursery rhyme is a form of teaching such associations in folklore: for individuals raised with such social codes, the phrase &quot;rub-a-dub-dub&quot; alone could stand in for gossip or innuendo without communicating all of the details.

One early recorded version in &quot;Christmas Box&quot;, published in London in 1798, has wording similar to that in &quot;Mother Goose&#x27;s Quarto or Melodies Complete&quot;, published in Boston, Massachusetts around 1825. The latter ran:

&lt;poem&gt;
Hey! rub-a-dub, ho! rub-a-dub, three maids in a tub,
And who do you think were there?
The butcher, the baker, the candlestick-maker,
And all of them gone to the fair.&lt;/poem&gt;

In the original version as it appeared both in England and in the United States (Boston) the song was talking about three maids instead of three men.
Later research, according to &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes&quot; (1951), suggests that the lyrics are illustrating a scene of three respectable townsfolk &quot;watching a dubious sideshow at a local fair&quot;.

By around 1830 the reference to maids was being removed from the versions printed in nursery books. In 1842 James Orchard Halliwell collected the following version:

&lt;poem&gt;
Rub a dub dub,
Three fools in a tub,
And who do you think they be?
The butcher, the baker,
The candlestick maker.
Turn them out, knaves all three.&lt;/poem&gt;

On a 1958 vinyl album of Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes [by Caedmon] with Boris Karloff, he sings a different version of the song that goes like this:

&lt;poem&gt;
Rub a dub dub,
Three men in a tub,
And how do you think they got there?
The butcher, the baker,
The candlestick maker.
They all jumped out of a rotten potato,
Was enough to make a man stare.&lt;/poem&gt;

There are several variants of the following story:

A pilot returning from a mission could not locate his aircraft carrier and in addition failed to establish secure communication. So he circled around the formation and radioed: &quot;Rub a dub dub, where is my tub?&quot; And received: &quot;Hey Diddle Diddle! Right here in the middle!&quot;

Some memoirs claim it was a real incident.

==In popular culture==

&quot;Rub-a-dub-dub&quot; or sometimes just &quot;rub-a-dub&quot; is Cockney rhyming slang for &quot;pub&quot;.

&quot;Rub-A-Dub-Dub&quot; is the title of a 1953 country music song by Hank Thompson, a 1984 animated television series by Peter Lang and Alan Rogers, and a 2023 novel by Robert Wringham.

<text>The Beverly Road station is a station on the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. It is located at the intersection of Beverley Road and Nostrand Avenue straddling the East Flatbush and Flatbush communities. The station is served by the 2 train at all times and the 5 train on weekdays.

== History ==
The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in Brooklyn. As part of Contract 4, the IRT agreed to build a subway line along Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn. The construction of the subway along Nostrand Avenue spurred real estate development in the surrounding areas. The Nostrand Avenue Line opened on August 23, 1920, and the Beverly Road station opened along with it.

During the 1950s the platforms were lengthened at their southern ends, so that the platforms could be 510 feet long and as a result they were then able to accommodate 10-car trains.

== Station layout ==
This underground station has two tracks and two side platforms. The station is served by the 2 train at all times and by the 5 train on weekdays during the day. It is between Newkirk Avenue to the south and Church Avenue to the north. Both platforms have their original IRT style trim line and name tablets. The trim line is pink with a brown border and &quot;B&quot; tablets for &quot;Beverly&quot; running at regular intervals. The name tablets read &quot;BEVERLY ROAD&quot; in a serif font on a brown background and pink border. The platforms only have I-beam columns near fare control in the center and these are painted yellow. The platforms are narrower and have cinder-block tiles at either ends, where they were extended in the 1950s to accommodate the current standard &quot;A&quot; Division train length of 510 feet. Here, there are signs reading &quot;BEVERLY ROAD&quot; in white arial font on a gray background.

This station&#x27;s name is spelled with two &quot;e&quot;s while the Beverley Road station on the BMT Brighton Line on the same street is spelled with three &quot;e&quot;s. That is because the street is split in half at Flatbush Avenue. To the west, it is spelled with three &quot;e&quot;s and to the east, formerly with two.

===Exits===
Each platform has one fare control area on the same level and there are no crossovers or crossunders to allow free transfers between directions. The Manhattan-bound one has a small turnstile bank, token booth, and one staircase going up to the southeast corner of Beverly Road and Nostrand Avenue. The Flatbush Avenue-bound platform&#x27;s fare control is unstaffed, containing two exit-only turnstiles, one High Entry/Exit Turnstile, and one staircase going up to the southwest corner of Beverly Road and Nostrand Avenue.

<text>The Mazda 929 is a full-size car which was sold by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Mazda between 1973 and 1997. Mazda used the 929 nameplate for export markets only, badge engineering its Luce model until 1991 and then transferring the name to export specification Sentia models. Between 1982 and 1986, Mazda also used the 929 nameplate on its Cosmo coupé in certain export markets.

<text>Tulivu-Donna Lynn Cumberbatch (July 28, 1950 - 
January 17, 2022) was an American jazz singer. Her African name &quot;Tulivu&quot; translates from Swahili loosely to &quot;beautiful,&quot; and her middle name, &quot;Donna Lynn&quot; is derived from &quot;Donna Lee,&quot; the jazz piece made popular by Charlie Parker. Her father, Harold Cumberbatch, was a baritone saxophone player. 

==Career==
As a child, Cumberbatch participated in church choir and the All City High School Chorus, then studied at Herbert H. Lehman College. After training, she began her solo career, influenced by such artists as Carmen McRae, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, and Nancy Wilson. She joined &quot;The Magnificent Trio,&quot; which consisted of Mark Johnson, Donald Smith, and Rachiim Ausar-Sahu.

In live performances, when not performing with her trio, Cumberbatch has sung with Hannibal Peterson, Kimati Dinizulu and the Kotoko Society, the Brooklyn Philharmonic, Diedre Murray, the Kronos Quartet, Akyenee Baako and Drumsong Productions, the Hank Doughty/Ray Abrams Big Band, and the Cliff Smalls Septet. She has performed in the Caribbean, Europe, and Canada, and frequently at jazz clubs and festivals in New York City.

She gained recognition for her work with Yoko Kanno on the album &quot;Song to Fly&quot; and on Kanno&#x27;s soundtracks for the anime television series &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;. With Yuki Kajiura she recorded a jazz version of the &quot;Noir&quot; song &quot;Lullaby&quot; for Kajiura&#x27;s solo album &quot;Fiction&quot;.

<text>The Newkirk Avenue–Little Haiti station is a station on the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of Newkirk and Nostrand Avenues in Brooklyn, the station is served by the 2 train at all times and the 5 train on weekdays.

== History ==

The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in Brooklyn. As part of Contract 3, the IRT agreed to build a subway line along Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn. The construction of the subway along Nostrand Avenue spurred real estate development in the surrounding areas. The Nostrand Avenue Line opened on August 23, 1920, and the Beverly Road station opened along with it.

In the 1950s, an additional exit-only was constructed on the Flatbush Avenue–bound platform that leads to the west side of Nostrand Avenue just south of Avenue D.

During the 1960s platform extensions were constructed at the southern ends of the platforms. They lengthened the platforms to long and allowed them to accommodate 10-car trains.

In early 2021, the New York State Assembly passed a bill presented by state assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn. The legislation provides funding for renaming the Newkirk Avenue station to Newkirk Avenue–Little Haiti station. The proposed name was meant to recognize the large Haitian community in the area around the station. On November 15, 2021, the Newkirk Avenue station was renamed. The station was formally rededicated on November 18, 2021, the 203rd anniversary of the Battle of Vertières (the last major battle of the Haitian Revolution).

== Station layout ==
This underground station has two tracks and two side platforms. The station is served by the 2 train at all times and by the 5 train on weekdays during the day. It is between Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College to the south and Beverly Road to the north. Each platform has its own fare control with no crossovers or crossunders to allow free transfers between directions, though there is evidence of a closed crossunder at the south end of the station.

The platforms have their original 1920s tiling from the Dual Contracts era. The &quot;NEWKIRK AVE&quot; name tablets are on a blue background with a green border. The station&#x27;s trim line is nearly fully green with accents of several other colors. &quot;N&quot;s for &quot;Newkirk&quot; run along the trim line at regular intervals. The platform columns run at regular intervals and are painted green to match the station&#x27;s tiling. They are wider in the middle of each platform where the station exits and fare control are. They get narrower as they run toward either end of the platform, especially at the extreme ends where the 1960s extension refrigerator-block style tiling is used. The columns have &quot;Newkirk&quot; written in white on a blue plate.

===Exits===
The Manhattan-bound platform has the station&#x27;s only bank of regular turnstiles and token booth. Its street stair leads to the southeast corner of Newkirk and Nostrand Avenues. The fare control for the Flatbush Avenue-bound platform is normally unstaffed, containing one High Entry Exit Turnstile and one exit-only turnstile. A Customer Service Agent Booth and bank of regular turnstiles is sometimes open during rush hours. This exit&#x27;s street stair leads to the southwest corner of Newkirk and Nostrand Avenues.

The Flatbush Avenue-bound platform has an additional exit-only on the extreme north end. This exit has two high turnstiles and its single street stair leads to the west side of Nostrand Avenue just south of Avenue D. This exit was added in the 1950s.

<doc id="731161" wikidata="Q1914654" url="?curid=731161" title="Mazda Carol">
<text>The Mazda Carol is a kei car manufactured by Mazda from 1962 until 1970. The Carol name was revived again with Mazda&#x27;s 1989 re-entry into the kei car class with the Autozam brand. Since 1989, the Carol has been a rebadged model manufactured by Suzuki for Mazda, based on the Japanese Suzuki Alto. The first two generations of the modern era Carols received unique bodywork, but since late 1998 the nameplate has been strictly a badging exercise.


== First generation (1962)==
The Mazda R360 was complemented by the more grown-up 2-door sedan Mazda P360 Carol in February 1962, the company&#x27;s first 4-passenger car, and complemented the three-wheeled Mazda Mazdago. It was more substantial than the R360: although its total length of was the same, its wheelbase was considerably longer. The Carol weighed in at , versus for the diminutive R360. It used the DA, a , rear-mounted water-cooled 358 cc 4-cylinder OHV engine. This is one of the smallest four-cylinder automobile engines in history, only Honda&#x27;s 356 cc DOHC alloy inline-four unit (used in the T360 truck) was smaller. The four-speed gearbox was synchronized only on the top three gears.

The Carol was perhaps overengineered: it had a very strong monocoque body, a four-cylinder four-stroke engine with a five-bearing crankshaft and four-wheel independent suspension by torsion bars, but this led to high production costs, comparably high weight, and its very comfortable ride was offset by cramped accommodation. Nonetheless, the Carol was an incredible success in the marketplace, capturing 67% of the Kei market in its first year. A better equipped DeLuxe version was added in May 1962, along with a changed angle of the rear window to help it stay clean. In September 1963, shortly after a reshaped combustion head and upgrade to , a four-door version appeared.

In October 1966 a minor facelift took place. The car was lightened somewhat, new bumpers were mounted, and the spare tire was moved from the front to the engine room, freeing up scarce luggage space. Also, the gearbox was now fully synchronized. The last modification took place in 1969, when in response to stricter safety standards a driver&#x27;s side headrest and provisions for seatbelts were fitted. Production continued until August 1970, by which time 265,226 Carol 360s had been built. Mazda did not offer a Kei class passenger car for two years, until the 1972 introduction of the Chantez.


=== Carol 600 (1962–1964) ===
The Carol 600 appeared in the fall of 1962 with a larger 586 cc &quot;RA&quot; OHV engine and longer at 3,200 mm. The extra length was due to more prominent bumpers, passenger space was as restricted as in the 360. Weight ranged from . It was also available as a four-door sedan, ahead of the lesser Carol 360. The car was called the &quot;600&quot; or &quot;P600&quot; in export markets. At home, there was a Standard two-door, and DeLuxe two- or four-door versions. Production ended in November 1964, after the introduction of the more spacious Mazda Familia 800 sedan version. Around 8,800 Carol 600s were built.

== Second generation (1989)==

With the revival of the Kei class in the late eighties, Mazda revived the Carol name in October 1989 for the Autozam Carol. The recently introduced Autozam was to be Mazda&#x27;s youthful brand and was used on Mazda&#x27;s kei cars for some time. The Carol was produced for Mazda by Suzuki, and while it used the Suzuki Alto&#x27;s platform and mechanicals, its interior and boldly curved exterior were largely unique. Its round headlights and cute appearance were very much a product of its time and followed upon the heels of similar designs such as Nissan&#x27;s Be-1 and Pao. It was either front (AA5PA) or all-wheel drive (AA5RA) and its SOHC 547 cc 3-cylinder Suzuki F5B engine produced at 7,500 rpm. The Carol had a wheelbase for a total length of and was wide. Brakes were discs up front and drums in rear.

Equipment levels were e, f (also 4WD), and the top g version. The g featured a Canvas Top. Four-wheel drives received a five-speed gearbox, while the front-wheel drive versions received a four- or five-speed manual or a three-speed auto. 550 cc Carols are rare, as production ended after only four months. New Kei car regulations for 1990 allowed manufacturers a bigger engine and an extra 10 cm of body length, and Mazda quickly brought out an updated Carol.

=== Facelift (1990–1994) ===

New regulations brought about the replacement of the 1989 Carol within 4 months, as the larger AA6 Carol was presented in February 1990. The new car was 6 cm longer and used a larger 657 cc Suzuki F6A engine with . The car is easy to tell from its predecessor by its clear headlight covers. In 1991, Mazda offered a turbocharged engine, and the car was further lengthened to 329 cm in 1992.
== Third generation (1995)==

An updated Autozam Carol came out in October 1995 as a 1996 model. Again, it was front or all-wheel drive and still sharing its platform with the Suzuki Alto. This generation also received model-specific bodywork, and was also only available as a three-door hatchback with a vestigial notchback design. A turbocharged SOHC version was available, although it was marketed without any sporting pretensions and did not even have a rev counter. Mazda also developed two retro-styled versions as a wave of such models flooded the Kei car market at the time; these were called the Carol Custom and the Carol Classic.

During 1998, the model&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Mazda Carol&quot; as the Autozam badge was being discontinued.

== Fourth generation (1998)==

An entirely new Carol appeared in October 1998 as a 1999 model, this time with the Mazda brand name. Unlike previous Carols, this model was similar to the Suzuki Alto. This Carol was available with either front or all-wheel drive and used the old 657 cc &quot;F6A&quot; engine or a new 658 cc DOHC unit. It was closely related to the AZ-Offroad and AZ-Wagon introduced at the same time.

The Carol was updated with a new look in December 2000, featuring Mazda&#x27;s new five-point grille design. Safety and emissions were also improved, thanks to new variants of the K-series family of engines with available variable valve timing. The earlier F6A was no longer available.
== Fifth generation (2004)==

As Suzuki released a replacement for the Suzuki Alto, the rebadged Mazda Carol was also replaced.
== Sixth generation (2009)==


Mazda has launched a new Carol in December 2009, which was first revealed at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show. The Carol has been updated alongside its brother, the Suzuki Alto. Like the Alto, the Carol is available with AWD and CVT.

== Seventh generation (2014)==


As Suzuki released a replacement for the Suzuki Alto, the rebadged Mazda Carol was also replaced.

== Eighth generation (2021)==


The eighth-generation Carol is based on the ninth-generation Alto.

<text>There was no regular election in 1944 to select inductees to the Baseball Hall of Fame. In 1939, the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) had moved to hold elections every three years rather than annually, and the next scheduled election was to be in 1945. In addition, the four-member Old-Timers Committee formed in late 1939 to select deserving individuals from the 19th century had still never met for that purpose, and criticism of the lack of honorees from that period was increasing.

On August 4, 1944, baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis named three new members to the Hall of Fame Committee (also known as the Old-Timers Committee), in addition to the four already named. He instructed them to put aside any delay and choose at least 10 individuals from the period 1876–1900 when they met early in 1945, in order that those selected might be honored concurrently with any elected by the BBWAA in their regular election in January. This was a goal the committee members believed they would have no problem meeting, and some noted that the number of deserving players was probably over two dozen. The previously named committee members were: Yankees president Ed Barrow; Athletics owner/manager Connie Mack; New York sportswriter Sid Mercer; and Braves president Bob Quinn. The newly named members were: Hall of Fame president Stephen C. Clark, who would chair the committee; Hall of Fame treasurer Paul S. Kerr, who would serve as committee secretary; and Boston sportswriter Mel Webb.

==Election of Commissioner Landis==

Landis died on November 25, 1944, even as plans were being made to extend his contract for a new seven-year term. Within days, the public and press strongly advocated his immediate election to the Hall. Two weeks after Landis&#x27; death, the Old-Timers Committee met at baseball&#x27;s winter meetings in New York City and elected Landis to membership in the Hall of Fame; Connie Mack sent his approval of the move by telegram from California, where he was vacationing. The members stated that any delay in electing Landis might have resulted in an unfortunate increase in public pressure, possibly creating the impression that the move was somehow forced rather than voluntary. The committee also suggested that if the upcoming BBWAA election failed to select any players whose careers extended into the early 20th century, some would be selected by the committee when they met again in February 1945.

Landis was formally inducted into the Hall of Fame on June 13, 1946, with Governor of New York Thomas Dewey unveiling his plaque in Cooperstown, New York, with dignitaries including Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler and National League president Ford Frick in attendance.

<text>The Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College station (announced as Brooklyn College–Flatbush Avenue on trains) is the southern terminal station on the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. It is located at the intersection of Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues in Flatbush, Brooklyn, locally called &quot;The Junction&quot;. The station is served by the 2 train at all times and the 5 train on weekdays. It is also the closest subway station to Brooklyn College and Midwood High School.

The Flatbush Avenue station was built along with the Nostrand Avenue Line as part of the Dual Contracts. The station opened on August 23, 1920, along with the rest of the line. Various proposals to extend the line past Flatbush Avenue were considered throughout the 20th century, but none were carried out.

The Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College station contains two side platforms and two tracks; the platforms are connected to each other at the southern end. It is the only such terminal station in the subway system, creating an inefficient design in which passengers must know which track a train is departing from before going to the platform. The platforms contain exits to the intersection of Nostrand and Flatbush Avenues, with a secondary exit to Avenue H. The station contains an elevator, which makes it compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

==History==

The Dual Contracts, which were signed on March 19, 1913, were contracts for the construction and rehabilitation and operation of rapid transit lines in the City of New York. The Dual Contracts promised the construction of several lines in Brooklyn. As part of Contract 4, the IRT agreed to build a subway line along Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn. The construction of the subway along Nostrand Avenue spurred real estate development in the surrounding areas. The Nostrand Avenue Line opened on August 23, 1920, and the Flatbush Avenue station opened as its terminal.

This underground station is the only &quot;dead-end&quot; terminal station in the subway system that does not have an island platform. It was built with two side platforms and two tracks to allow for a planned but ultimately unbuilt extension of the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line. The extension, proposed in 1929, would have brought the line south towards Voorhies Avenue in Sheepshead Bay. These plans were revisited in 1939, 1946, 1951, and 1968.

On October 5, 1931, a new staircase at the station to the southeastern corner of Flatbush Avenue and Nostrand Avenue was opened for service.

In 1968, as part of the Program for Action, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) gave consideration to extending the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line approximately beyond the station to provide room for turnaround facilities. This would eliminate the operational restrictions caused by the current layout. However, a ballot measure for funding much of the program was voted down in 1971, delaying this plan indefinitely. This plan was again considered in 1989.

In 1981, the MTA listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. As part of a plan to increase accessibility in the New York City Subway, the MTA had planned to install elevators at the Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College station by 1995. Starting in December 1993, the station was renovated at the cost of $6 million. An elevator was installed, and the 1920s-style &quot;Flatbush Avenue&quot; name tablets, containing red backgrounds with blue borders, were restored on both platforms. The elevator was closed from July to December 2021 for replacement. The top and bottom of the platform walls contain a blue solid line with a colorful border trim. This results in a tiling scheme with blue tiles that create a wavy pattern that comes farther up whenever there is a &quot;F&quot; tile — which stands for Flatbush — in the station&#x27;s trimline.

In December 2020, the MTA announced that it would commission artwork in honor of subway operator Garrett Goble, who died on March 27, 2020, during an arson at the Central Park North–110th Street station. The Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College station was selected because Goble had used it often while growing up. The artwork was ultimately unveiled and installed on May 24, 2021.

Plans for the Interborough Express, a light rail line using the Bay Ridge Branch right of way, were announced in 2023. As part of the project, a light rail station at Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues has been proposed next to the existing Brooklyn College subway station.

==Station layout==

This station has two side platforms, which are connected at the south end just past the bumper blocks, forming a &quot;U&quot; shape. The presence of the connection at the southern end mitigates what is otherwise an inefficient terminal design, in which passengers must know which track a train is departing from before going to one of the two platforms. The station is served by the 2 train at all times and by the 5 train on weekdays during the day. It is the southern terminus of all service; the next stop to the north is Newkirk Avenue–Little Haiti.

The IRT Nostrand Avenue Line tunnels continue beyond the bumper blocks at Flatbush Avenue and Nostrand Avenue. They extend for several hundred feet to Avenue H, but no tracks were ever laid in these tunnels. Up until about 2006, passengers could see the cemented-over gratings extending down Nostrand Avenue. When a new building went up, the grates were removed. Prior to the construction of the exit at the south end of the station, there was only a temporary wooden ramp connecting the platforms and the tunnels were actually visible to passengers.

On weekdays when 5 trains serve the station, all Manhattan-bound 2 trains depart from Track 3, and all Manhattan-bound 5 trains depart from Track 2. When the 5 does not serve the station, 2 trains depart from both tracks.

The station platforms have several doors for various non-public uses, including crew quarters. A 2 train crew office is on the Track 3 side, and a 5 train crew office is on the Track 2 side. There are public restrooms along Track 3 just within the station&#x27;s main entrance. The columns along the platforms are painted light-blue.

The 1996 cast bronze relief artwork at this station is called &quot;Flatbush Floogies&quot; by Muriel Castanis.

===Exits===
At the U-shaped end, there is an unstaffed exit containing two HEET turnstiles and one exit-only turnstile. The single staircase here goes up to the west side of Nostrand Avenue north of Avenue H. The station&#x27;s main entrance is on the Track 3 (eastern) platform. Two street stairs from each eastern corner of Nostrand and Flatbush Avenues lead to where the full-time token booth and two separate banks of turnstiles are. The single elevator from street level down to fare control is at the southeast corner. There is another entrance on the platform of Track 2 (west side). This entrance has two sets of street stairs adjacent to each other at the northwest corner of Flatbush Avenue and Nostrand Avenue. The token booth and turnstile bank are open weekdays only. A single HEET turnstile provides access to this entrance other times.

<text>The Boeing P-8 Poseidon is an American maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft developed and produced by Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security. It was developed for the United States Navy as a derivative of the civilian Boeing 737 Next Generation airliner. 

The P-8 operates in anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-surface warfare (ASUW), and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) roles. It is armed with torpedoes, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and other weapons, can drop and monitor sonobuoys, and can operate in conjunction with other assets, including the Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton maritime surveillance unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

In addition to the U.S. Navy, the P-8 is also operated by the Indian Navy, the Royal Australian Air Force, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Air Force, the Royal Norwegian Air Force and the Royal New Zealand Air Force. It also has been ordered by the Republic of Korea Navy, the German Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force.

==Development==

===Origins===
The Lockheed P-3 Orion, a turboprop ASW aircraft, has been in service with the United States Navy (USN) since 1962. In the 1980s, the USN began studies for a P-3 replacement, the range and endurance of which were reduced due to increasing weight and airframe fatigue life limitations. The specification required a new aircraft to have reduced operating and support costs. In 1989, Lockheed was awarded a fixed-price contract to develop the P-7, but this was canceled the following year.

In 2000, a second competition for a replacement began. Lockheed Martin submitted the Orion 21, an updated new-build version of the P-3. Boeing&#x27;s proposal was based on its 737-800 airliner. BAE Systems offered a new-build version of the Nimrod MRA4, a British jet-powered maritime patrol aircraft. BAE withdrew from the competition in October 2002, recognizing that without a production partner based in the United States, the bid was politically unrealistic. On 14 May 2004, Boeing was selected as the winner of the &quot;Multimission Maritime Aircraft&quot; program.

In June 2004, the USN awarded a development contract to Boeing. The project was planned to be for at least 108 airframes for the USN. Project value is expected to be worth at least $15 billion. Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Spirit AeroSystems, GE Aviation Systems, Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group, CFM International, BAE Systems, and Marotta are major subcontractors. In July 2004, the USN placed an order for five aircraft, and the first flight-test aircraft was to be completed in 2009. On 30 March 2005, it was assigned the P-8A designation.

===Design phase and testing===
The P-8 is to replace the P-3. Initially, it was equipped with legacy systems with later upgrades to incorporate newer technology. The Government Accountability Office credited the incremental approach with keeping the project on schedule and on budget. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) deleted the requirement for the P-8A to be equipped with magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) equipment as a weight reduction measure, improving endurance. A hydrocarbon sensor detects fuel vapors from diesel-powered submarines and ships.

The P-8&#x27;s first flight was on 25 April 2009. The second and third P-8s had flown and were in flight testing in early August 2010. On 11 August 2010, low-rate production of the P-8 was approved. A P-8 released sonobuoys for the first time on 15 October 2010, dropping six in three separate low-altitude passes. In 2011, the ice detection system was found to be defective due to the use of counterfeit components; allegedly these parts were poorly refurbished and sold to subcontractor BAE Systems as new by a Chinese supplier.
On 4 March 2012, the first production P-8A was delivered to the USN, flying to Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida, for training with the Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS), Patrol Squadron 30 (VP-30). On 24 September 2012, Boeing announced a $1.9 billion (~$ in ) order for 11 aircraft. On 10 June 2013, a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Inspector General (IG) report recommended delaying full-rate production over a lack of key data to assess if the P-8 met operational requirements; additional tests were also needed to guarantee a 25-year lifespan. Boeing executives dismissed the report, saying that the test program was on track. In 2013, full-rate production was delayed until the P-8 could demonstrate it can survive its 25-year lifespan without structural fatigue, overcome deficiencies, track surface ships, and perform primary missions.

On 24 June 2013, during weapons integration testing, the P-8 achieved a milestone by firing a live AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missile and scored a direct hit on a low-cost modular target. On 1 July 2013, an initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&amp;E) report found that the P-8A was &quot;operationally effective, operationally suitable, and ready for fleet introduction.&quot; Six test and nine low-rate initial production aircraft had been delivered at that point. On 31 July 2013, Boeing received a $2.04 billion contract to build 13 P-8As in the fourth low-rate initial production lot, for a fleet of 37 aircraft by the end of 2016, and long-lead parts for 16 P-8As of the first full-rate production lot.

In January 2014, Naval Air Systems Command proceeded with full-rate production of the P-8A. Increment 1 systems include persistent anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities and an integrated sensor suite; in 2016, Increment 2 upgrades will add multi-static active coherent acoustics, an automated identification system, and high-altitude anti-submarine weapons. Increment 3 in 2020 shall enable &quot;net-enabled anti-surface warfare&quot;.

In July 2014, Fred Smith, business development director for the P-8, noted that the program had: &quot;saved $2.1 billion on 2004 estimates of the cost of production... the aircraft is now selling for $150 million, down from the forecasted $216 million&quot;. The halving of USN orders from 16 aircraft per year down to eight in 2015 due to the expiration of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 was expected to be partially offset by commercial 737 sales and P-8 export sales. The DoD wanted to follow a program template for the P-8 similar to the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, with international cooperation from prospective users.

===Derivatives===
In 2010, Boeing proposed to replace the United States Air Force&#x27;s (USAF) E-8 Joint STARS fleet with a modified P-8 at the same cost Northrop Grumman proposed for re-engining and upgrading the E-8s. The proposed P-8 Airborne Ground Surveillance (AGS) would integrate an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, and have ground moving target indicator (GMTI) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) capabilities. A key feature was a pod-mounted radar on the fuselage&#x27;s lower centerline, positioned so the engine nacelles do not obstruct its line of sight. It reuses the P-8A&#x27;s Raytheon AN/APY-10 multi-mission surface search radar. Two aft ventral fins increase stability.

In 2013, Boeing proposed repackaging some of the P-8&#x27;s systems in the smaller and less expensive Bombardier Challenger 600 series business jet, as the Boeing Maritime Surveillance Aircraft (MSA). In 2014, Boeing also offered a JSTARS replacement based on the 737-700, rather than the P-8&#x27;s 737-800.

==Design==
The P-8 is a 737-800ERX, roughly similar to the 737-800 commercial passenger aircraft and the USN&#x27;s 737-700-based C-40 Clipper transport aircraft, but with several modifications to make it suitable for its military service role. Many of the changes reflect the need for the aircraft to operate at lower altitudes and be capable of more aggressive maneuvering than a commercial aircraft. However, the changes were kept in line with the existing assembly process. Boeing 737 fuselage builder Spirit AeroSystems added structural strength to the airframe, while adding a short bomb bay for torpedoes and other stores behind the wing. 

The aircraft is assembled at the Boeing Renton Factory with the stronger wings from the 737-900. The aircraft uses raked wingtips similar to those fitted to the Boeing 767-400ER, instead of the blended winglets available on 737NG variants. To combat icing on the raked wingtips, horizontal stabilizers and vertical stabilizers, the aircraft is outfitted with electro-mechanical expulsion deicing systems. In the cockpit, changes were made to the flight control and alerting systems, allowing for an increased bank angle, a more responsive autothrottle, and the elimination of audible warnings during low-altitude operations. In order to power additional onboard electronics, the P-8 has a 180 kVA electric generator on each CFM International CFM56 engine, replacing the 90 kVA generator of civilian 737s; this required the redesigning of the nacelles and their wing mountings. The Navy says that compared to the P-3, the P-8 has a smoother flight experience, subjecting crews to less turbulence and fumes, allowing them to concentrate better on missions.
After the aircraft roll off the assembly line, five operator stations (two naval flight officers plus three enlisted Aviation Warfare Operators/naval aircrewman) are mounted in a sideways row, along the port side of the cabin. Other than one large window on each side of the forward cabin for two observers, none of the other crew stations have windows. A short bomb bay for torpedoes and other stores opens behind the wing. The P-8 is to be equipped with the High-Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare Weapon Capability (HAAWC) Air Launch Accessory (ALA), turning a Mark 54 torpedo into a glide bomb for deploying from up to .

The P-8 features the Raytheon APY-10 multi-mission surface search radar. Unlike the preceding P-3, most versions of the P-8 lack a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD), but the P-8I is equipped with a MAD at India&#x27;s request. Various sensor data are combined via data fusion software to track targets. Following the cancellation of Lockheed Martin&#x27;s Aerial Common Sensor project, Boeing proposed a signals intelligence variant of the P-8 for the USN&#x27;s requirement. During the P-8A Increment 2 upgrade in 2016, the Littoral Surveillance Radar System (LSRS) will be replaced by the Advanced Airborne Sensor radar.

In U.S. service, the P-8A is complemented by the MQ-4C Triton unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) which provides continuous surveillance. In January 2015, BAE Systems was awarded a contract for the USN&#x27;s High Altitude ASW (HAASW) Unmanned Targeting Air System (UTAS) program to develop a sub-hunting UAV equipped with a MAD for launching from the P-8.
The P-8 cannot use the Navy&#x27;s typical probe and drogue in-flight refueling method, instead using a flying boom receptacle on the upper-forward fuselage, making it, like the USN&#x27;s E-6 Mercury aircraft, reliant on US Air Force (USAF) KC-135 Stratotanker, KC-10 Extender and KC-46 Pegasus aircraft for in-flight refueling. In April 2017, the USAF 459th Air Refueling Wing worked with the Naval Air Systems Command to certify operationally the P-8 for in-flight refueling. For extended endurance, the P-8 is equipped with six auxiliary fuel tanks.

==Operational history==

===United States===
In February 2012, the P-8 made its mission debut during &quot;Bold Alligator&quot; 2012, an annual littoral warfare exercise. In April 2012, it took part in Exercise Joint Warrior, flying out of RAF Lossiemouth. During RIMPAC 2012 in the Hawaiian area, two P-8As participated in 24 scenarios as part of Air Test and Evaluation Squadron One (VX-1) while forward deployed to Marine Corps Base Hawaii. On 29 November 2013, its inaugural deployment began when six aircraft and 12 air crews of squadron VP-16 departed its home station of NAS Jacksonville, Florida, for Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan. This deployment was a pre-planned regional re-balancing action, but occurred shortly after China&#x27;s establishment of the East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone, heightening tensions.

During early exercises and the Japanese deployment, the P-8 reportedly suffered radar, sensor integration, and data transfer problems, leading to more testing. In 2012–3, the US government&#x27;s Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOTE) evaluated the P-8A Increment 1, and reported that it was effective for small-area and cued ASW search, localization and attack missions, but lacked the P-3C&#x27;s broad-area ASW acoustic search capability; the Mk 54 torpedoes were of limited use against evasive targets. The P-8A was also effective at ASuW search, detection and classification in all-weather at short to medium ranges for all surface vessels and at longer ranges for larger vessels, yet was not effective for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance mission due to various issues including no high-resolution SAR capability. It did have better range, speed, and reliability than older aircraft. DOTE concluded that it was not deployment ready. Pentagon acquisition undersecretary Frank Kendall said of the report that, although its findings are factual, it ignored future capability upgrades for ASW and surveillance.

A second squadron, VP-5, completed its transition to the P-8 in August 2013. During mid-2014, a pair of P-8s were dispatched to Perth, Australia for two months for an international search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. On 2 October 2015, USN P-8s stationed at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida, alongside U.S. Coast Guard HC-144A Ocean Sentry, HC-130H and USAF Reserve HC-130P Combat Shadow aircraft, searched the Eastern Caribbean Sea for the missing SS El Faro cargo ship that sank on 1 October in the Category 3 Hurricane Joaquin near Crooked Island in the Bahamas. On 20 February 2018, a P-8 of Patrol Squadron Eight (VP-8) rescued three fishermen whose vessel had been adrift in the South Pacific Ocean for eight days, deploying a search and rescue (SAR) kit containing supplies and communications equipment, the first time that a P-8 deployed a SAR kit in a real operation.

On 19 August 2014, a Chinese Shenyang J-11 fighter came within of a USN P-8A of VP-5 about east of Hainan Island while patrolling the South China Sea. The J-11 flew past the P-8&#x27;s nose and performed a barrel roll at close proximity. A Pentagon spokesperson said the J-11&#x27;s unit had made close intercepts earlier that year. The U.S. sent a diplomatic note to China about the behavior of the Chinese fighter group&#x27;s commander. China stated that the claims were &quot;totally groundless&quot;, and that the root cause was U.S. surveillance of China. In November 2016, a Russian Su-30 fighter intercepted a P-8 over the Black Sea, coming within of it, forcing the P-8 through its jet wash, causing &quot;a 15-degree roll and violent turbulence&quot;.
USN P-8s routinely rotate through bases of allies. In September 2014, the Malaysian government offered the use of bases in East Malaysia for P-8s, but no flights have yet been approved. On 7 December 2015, P-8s were deployed to Singapore as part of a Defense Cooperation Agreement between the US and Singapore for &quot;fighting terrorism and piracy.&quot; China criticized the Singapore deployment as &quot;regional militarization by the U.S.&quot; The third detachment of two P-8s based in Paya Lebar Air Base, Singapore, participated in naval military drills with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) in mid 2016.

On 20 November 2023, a USN P-8A assigned to VP-4 overshot the runway while landing in the rain at MCAS Kaneohe Bay and ended up in the water. None of the nine crew on board were injured. The USN hopes to repair the aircraft and return it to operational status. The aircraft was floated and pulled from the sea on 2 December 2023.

A USN P-8A flew through the Taiwan Strait on 17 April 2024, asserting navigational rights amid tensions with China over Taiwan&#x27;s sovereignty. This followed the first talks between US and Chinese defense chiefs since 2022, aimed at easing regional tensions.

===India===

In January 2008, Boeing proposed the P-8I, a customized export variant of the P-8A, for the Indian Navy. The P-8I has a version of the Raytheon APY-10 multi-mission surface search radar that meets export requirements. It also features two components not fitted on the P-8A, a Telephonics APS-143 OceanEye aft radar and a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD). On 4 January 2009, India&#x27;s Ministry of Defence signed a US$2.1 billion (~$ in ) agreement with Boeing for eight P-8Is to replace the Indian Navy&#x27;s aging Tupolev Tu-142M maritime surveillance turboprops. It was Boeing&#x27;s first military sale to India and the P-8&#x27;s first international customer.

In October 2010, India&#x27;s Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) approved the purchase of four additional P-8Is. Contract signature followed in July 2016 with deliveries expected to start from 2020. In 2011, India planned to order twelve more P-8Is at a later date; in 2019, this was cut to eight to ten due to a limited budget.

The Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) Data Link II communications allows the P-8I to exchange tactical data between Indian Navy aircraft, ships and shore establishments; it also features an integrated BEL-developed IFF system. India has purchased 21 AGM-84L Harpoon Block II missiles and 32 Mark 54 Lightweight Torpedoes All-Up-Round for the P-8I.

In July 2012, Boeing began P-8I flight testing. On 19 December 2012, the first P-8I was handed over at Boeing&#x27;s facility in Seattle. It was inducted into the Indian Navy on 15 May 2013. The type is based at INS &quot;Rajali&quot;, in Tamil Nadu.

In 2014, several Indian Navy P-8Is conducted search operations for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The Indian Navy inducted the first squadron in November 2015. P-8Is participated in the 2017 Doklam Standoff between Indian Army and China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army. Indian Navy P-8Is also monitored Pakistani Army units during the 2019 Pulwama standoff.

In November 2019, the Indian government approved the procurement of six more P-8Is. In 2021, reports revealed that Indian Ministry of Defence has sent Letter of Request (LoR) to the US Government for procurement of additional 6 P-8Is. On 27 April, the LoR was forwarded to Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) and the proposal featured on a notice by the agency under the US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. In April 2020, Defense Security Cooperation Agency cleared approved the sale of 10 AGM-84L Harpoon missiles along with containers, spare and repair parts, support and test equipment for the P-8I fleet to the Indian Navy at a value of $93 million. The possible sale of 16 aircraft-launched Mark 54 Lightweight Torpedo all up rounds and 3 Mk 54 Exercise Torpedoes for its additional P-8I fleet at a cost of $63 million was also cleared. These sales were for the additional four P-8Is.

Of the 4 additional P-8Is ordered in 2016 the first was delivered to Indian naval air station INS Hansa, Dabolim Goa on 19 November 2020, followed by another on 13 July 2021; the remaining two were delivered on 30 December 2021.

In August 2024, it was announced that the Indian Navy&#x27;s P-8I fleet will be maintained by Air India Engineering Services Limited (AIESL), a subsidiary of Air India, which signed a deal with Boeing for receiving training for its personnel. AIESL has also overhauled the landing gear of the entire aircraft fleet.

===Australia===
On 20 July 2007, the Australian Minister for Defence announced that the P-8A was the preferred aircraft to replace the Royal Australian Air Force fleet of Lockheed AP-3C Orions in conjunction with a then yet-to-be-selected unmanned aerial vehicle. The last AP-3C was scheduled to be retired in 2018, after nearly 30 years of service. In March 2009, Australia&#x27;s Chief of Air Force stated that the RAAF planned to introduce the P-8A in 2016.

In October 2012, Australia formalized its participation, committing A$73.9m (US$81.1m) in an agreement with the USN. In July 2013, Air Marshal Geoff Brown, head of the RAAF, said Australia was considering buying more P-8As and fewer MQ-4C Triton UAVs than earlier planned. On 21 February 2014, Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the intention to procure eight P-8As plus options for four more; entry into service is planned for 2021.

In July 2014, negotiations commenced between Boeing and the US Department of Defense to integrate the AGM-84 Harpoon Block 1G anti-ship missile onto the P-8A on Australia&#x27;s behalf. In August 2014, the USN concluded an advanced acquisition contract on the first four of up to 12 P-8As to be bought by Australia, with delivery expected from 2017. In January 2016, Australia ordered a further four P-8As. The 2016 Defence White Paper stated that eight P-8As would be in service in the early 2020s and that 15 P-8As are planned for by the late 2020s. Including support facilities, the first group of eight aircraft&#x27;s total cost is estimated at $3.6 billion (AU$4 billion).

The RAAF accepted its first P-8A on 27 September 2016; it arrived in Australia on 14 November. The RAAF had received 12 P-8As by 13 December 2019. The Australian Government approved ordering two additional aircraft on 30 December 2020. The option to acquire a 15th aircraft may not be taken up.

According to the Australian Defence Minister, Richard Marles, in May 2022 a Chinese J-16 is alleged to have flown alongside a RAAF P-8A, deploying flares and chaff. One piece of chaff is alleged to have been ingested into the P-8A&#x27;s engine.

===United Kingdom===
In August 2012, it was reported that Boeing saw the United Kingdom as a market for the P-8, following the cancellation of the Nimrod MRA4 in 2010. On 23 November 2015, the UK announced its intention to order nine P-8s in the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015, which would be based at RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland to protect the UK&#x27;s nuclear deterrent and aircraft carriers, as well as perform search-and-rescue and overland reconnaissance missions.

On 25 March 2016, the U.S. State Department approved a proposed Foreign Military Sale to the UK for up to nine P-8s and associated support. During an April 2016 tour of US anti-submarine capabilities, the UK defense procurement minister stated that the Royal Air Force would initially operate the P-8 with U.S. weapons, with the option to transition to British weapons later. It was not initially clear whether the UK would have access to future ground-surveillance capabilities developed for the P-8. On 11 July 2016, Boeing announced the signing of a $3.87 billion (£3 billion) contract for nine P-8s and support infrastructure, spread across three production lots over a ten-year period, with deliveries commencing in 2019.

The RAF allocated the aircraft the service name Poseidon MRA Mk1. They are operated by No. 120 Squadron and No. 201 Squadron. The first Poseidon MRA Mk1 (&quot;ZP801&quot;) made its initial flight on 13 July 2019. The UK took delivery of the first aircraft, named &quot;Pride of Moray&quot;, at Boeing&#x27;s Seattle facility on 29 October. It arrived at Kinloss Barracks in February 2020 before relocating to RAF Lossiemouth in October 2020, along with &quot;ZP802&quot; which was delivered on 13 March 2020. The RAF declared the P-8 had reached initial operating capability (IOC) on 1 April 2020. The final ordered aircraft arrived at RAF Lossiemouth in January 2022.

===Norway===
In March 2014, Norwegian newspaper &quot;Dagbladet&quot; reported that the Royal Norwegian Air Force is considering leasing aircraft from Boeing as No. 333 Squadron RNoAF&#x27;s six P-3 Orions were becoming increasingly difficult to keep operational. In June 2016, Norwegian newspaper &quot;Verdens Gang&quot; reported that the Norwegian government would buy four new surveillance aircraft in its long-term defense plan; the P-8 was seen as the main option. In December 2016, the U.S. State Department approved the sale with congressional approval pending.

On 29 March 2017, Norway signed a contract for five P-8As, to be delivered between 2022 and 2023. On 13 July 2021, Boeing rolled out first P-8As Poseidon aircraft from the paint shop for Norway. The first aircraft was delivered on 18 November 2021. It is to be operated by the 133 Air Wing, 333 Squadron at Evenes Air Station. The first P-8 is to be named Viking and the successive four aircraft are to be named for Norse gods: Vingtor, Ulabrand, Hugin and Munin.

===New Zealand===

Boeing publicly identified the Royal New Zealand Air Force as a potential customer in 2008 as a replacement for its P-3 Orions. In April 2017, the U.S. State Department approved the possible foreign military sale of up to four P-8As with equipment and support, valued at US$1.46 billion (~$ in ). In July 2018, the New Zealand government announced the purchase of four P-8As, to begin operations in 2023.

Four P-8As were ordered in March 2019. The RNZAF is planning to operate the type for at least 30 years. In September 2020, the inaugural Royal New Zealand Air Force crew for the P-8A graduated training at Jacksonville, Florida. This crew is to then qualify as instructors to train the first RNZAF crews back in New Zealand. The first P-8A was delivered in December 2022 with three more aircraft delivered as of July 2023.

===South Korea===
In 2013, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) commenced a procurement program to acquire up to 20 ASW aircraft to replace the Republic of Korea Navy&#x27;s fleet of 16 P-3Cs; possible candidates included the C-295 MPA, P-8, Saab Swordfish and the SC-130J Sea Hercules. DAPA considered procuring 12 to 20 ex-USN Lockheed S-3 Vikings. In 2017, the ROKN canceled plans to buy refurbished S-3s.

On 26 June 2018, it was announced that DAPA had selected the P-8 and would acquire six aircraft through the US Foreign Military Sales program. On 13 September 2018, the US state department stated it supported the sale of 6 P-8s and notified Congress. South Korea ordered six P-8As in March 2019 with aircraft delivered in 2024. 

===Germany===
The US Department of State approved a possible Foreign Military Sale of five P-8As with associated equipment to Germany for an estimated cost of $1.77 billion. The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) notified US Congress of the possible sale on 12 March 2021. On 23 June 2021, Germany approved the purchase of five P-8As worth $1.31 billion (~$ in ). On 28 September 2021, Germany finalized the purchase and is to retire its existing P-3C Orions when the P-8s are delivered. In November 2023, a simulator and an additional three P-8s were approved. The first P-8A will enter service with the German Navy in Spring 2025.

=== Canada ===
Boeing identified that the Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s fleet of CP-140 Auroras (Canadian variant of the P-3 Orion) would begin to reach the end of their service life by 2025. In 2015, Boeing offered the Challenger MSA, a smaller and cheaper aircraft based on the Bombardier Challenger 650 integrating many of the P-8&#x27;s sensors and equipment, to complement but not replace the CP-140s. Boeing also offered the P-8A with modifications specific to Canadian operations to replace the Aurora.

In 2019, Canada announced the start of a project to replace its CP-140s, valued at greater than and named &quot;Canadian Multimission Aircraft Project&quot;. The Canadian Armed Forces requirements call for a crewed, long-range platform, capable of providing C4, ISR, and ASW with the ability to engage/control and to fully integrate with other ISR and ASW assets. In 2022, Boeing officially announced it would offer the P-8A in the Canadian Multi-Mission Aircraft project with CAE, GE Aviation Canada, IMP Aerospace &amp; Defence, KF Aerospace, Honeywell Aerospace Canada and Raytheon Canada. In March 2023, Canada announced the submission of a Letter of Request via the U.S. government&#x27;s Foreign Military Sales program on the acquisition of up to 16 P-8As. On 27 June 2023, the State Department approved a possible $5.9 billion sale of up to 16 P-8As and associated equipment, pending approval by Congress.

On 30 November 2023, Defence Minister Bill Blair announced that Canada would purchase up to 16 P-8As for (). The cost breakdown includes for the aircraft and related equipment while another is for simulators, infrastructure and weapons. Delivery of the type is expected between 2026 and 2027, with full operational capability anticipated by 2033. The fleet is to be based in Nova Scotia at 14 Wing Greenwood, and in British Columbia at 19 Wing Comox.

===Potential operators===
====Brazil====
On 23 September 2022, Boeing&#x27;s Latin America director, Tim Flood, presented the capabilities of the P-8 to the Brazilian Air Force commander, General Carlos de Almeida Baptista Júnior. According to Baptista Júnior, &quot;the discussions have a great importance to prospect the future of FAB&#x27;s maritime patrol aviation&quot;, as part of a plan to replace its P-3AMs currently in service.

====Denmark====
According to a leaked defence list in the Danish newspaper Altinget in 2023, Denmark is considering acquiring P-8s in the near future.

====Italy====
Italy indicated interest in purchasing P-8s, with fleet support provided by Alitalia, in 2004. However, in December 2008, Italy announced the purchase of four ATR 72 aircraft to replace its aging Atlantic maritime patrol fleet, possibly as a temporary solution because Italy remained interested in the P-8.

====NATO====
In April 2019, Boeing was reported to be in exploratory talks with various NATO allies to offer the P-8 as a NATO-shared interim solution to provide European allies with its capabilities until domestic capabilities could be secured by 2035.

====Saudi Arabia====
In 2017, Boeing announced it had signed several agreements with Saudi Arabia, which intends to order the P-8. The International Institute for Strategic Studies reported in 2019 that a Saudi order for the type was still pending.

====Turkey====
In 2016, Turkey indicated that it planned to acquire a new MMA aircraft to supplement existing assets, the P-8A being the main candidate based on the required performance.

===Failed bids===
====Malaysia====
In December 2017, the Royal Malaysian Air Force&#x27;s Brigadier General Yazid Bin Arshad announced it had shortlisted four aircraft types to replace the force&#x27;s aging fleet of Beechcraft Super King Air maritime patrol aircraft; these are the EADS CASA C-295 from Airbus, the P-8 from Boeing, ATR 72 MP from ATR, and the CASA/IPTN CN-235, possibly provided by either Airbus or Indonesian Aerospace, which acquired a licence to produce it. Arshad added that: &quot;these four types are shortlisted, the door is not closed yet&quot;, indicating other options may be possible. In May 2023, Malaysia selected ATR&#x27;s ATR-72MP as its maritime patrol aircraft.

<doc id="731170" wikidata="Q607198" url="?curid=731170" title="Mazda Cosmo">
<text>The was an automobile produced by Mazda from 1967 to 1996. During its production run, the Cosmo served as a &quot;halo&quot; vehicle for Mazda, with the first Cosmo successfully launching the Mazda Wankel engine. The final generation of the Cosmo served as Mazda&#x27;s flagship vehicle in Japan, sold as the Eunos Cosmo through its luxury Eunos division in Japan.

Mazda decided on the name &quot;&quot;, reflecting international cultural fascination with the Space Race, Mazda wanted to showcase the Mazda Wankel engine as forward-thinking, with focus on future developments and technology.


== Series L10A/L10B (1967–1972) ==
The first Mazda to bear the Cosmo name (called the 110S on models intended for export) was (along with the NSU Ro80) one of the first production cars to feature a 2-rotor Wankel engine. A prototype was presented at the 1964 Tokyo Motor Show, one month before the 1964 Summer Olympics, and after the introduction of the NSU Spider at the Frankfurt Motor Show; 80 pre-production Cosmos were produced for the Mazda test department (20) and for dealership testing (60) between 1965 and 1966. Full production began in May 1967 and lasted through 1972, though Cosmos were built by hand at a rate of only about one per day, for a total of 1,176 (343 Series I cars and 833 Series II cars). The car was also featured in the show &quot;The Return of Ultraman&quot;.

Cosmos were built in five batches:
=== Racing ===
In 1968, Mazda went racing with the Cosmo. They selected one of the most grueling tests in Europe to prove the reliability of the rotary engine, the 84-hour &quot;Marathon de la Route&quot; at the legendary Nürburgring circuit in Germany. Two mostly stock Cosmos were entered, along with 58 other cars. One major change to the cars&#x27; 10A engines was the addition of a novel side- and peripheral-port intake system: A butterfly valve switched from the side to the peripheral port as RPM increased. The engines were limited to to improve durability.

The cars ran together in fourth and fifth place for most of the race, but the all-Japanese car was retired with axle damage in the 82nd hour. The other car, driven by Belgians, completed the race in fourth overall. This was to be the only racing outing for the Cosmo—the next Mazda race car would be a Familia Rotary (R100).

=== Series I ===

The Series I/L10A Cosmo was powered by a 0810 two-rotor engine with 982 cc of displacement and produced about 110 hp (thus the &quot;110S&quot; name used in export markets). It used a Hitachi four-barrel carburetor and an odd ignition design—two spark plugs per chamber with dual distributors. A four-speed manual transmission and 14-inch wheels were standard.

In Japan, the installation of a rotary engine gave Japanese buyers a financial advantage when it came time to pay the annual road tax in that they bought a car that was more powerful than a traditional inline engine, but without having the penalty for having an engine in the higher above-one-litre tax bracket.

The front suspension was a coil-sprung double-wishbone design with an anti-roll bar. The rear used a leaf-sprung de Dion tube. Unassisted 10 inch (254 mm) disk brakes were found in front with 7.9 inches (201 mm) drum brakes in the rear. Performance in the quarter-mile (400 m) was 16.4 s, with a 115 mph (185 km/h) top speed. The price was lower than the Toyota 2000GT at 1.48 million yen (US$4,100).

=== Series II ===

The Series II/L10B was introduced in July 1968. It had a more-powerful 128 hp (95 kW)/103 lb·ft (140 N·m) 0813 engine, power brakes, 15 inch wheels and a 5-speed manual transmission. The wheelbase had been expanded by 15cm for more room and a better ride. This Cosmo was good for over 120 mph (193 km/h) and could accelerate to cover a quarter-mile (400 m) in 15.8 s.

Visual changes included a larger grille under the front bumper with two additional vents to each side of this &quot;mouth&quot;. Only 833 were ever made, and fewer than six Series II models were initially imported into the United States. The price was up a bit to 1.48 million yen (US$4,390).

Comedian and former talk show host Jay Leno owns a 1970 Series II Cosmo which was featured on the North American Speed Channel series &quot;My Classic Car&quot; in March 2006. It was believed to be the only remaining Series II Cosmo in the United States, though the original Cosmo 10A engine has been replaced with a 12A from an RX-7.

However, Mazda&#x27;s U.S. division &quot;found another in the garage of Phoenix-area car collector Glenn Roberts and made an offer that he couldn&#x27;t refuse,&quot; according to &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s September 2007 issue (&quot;A Tale of Two Rotaries&quot;). There is a further Series II Cosmo in a collection in Alberta, Canada.

A 1970 Mazda Cosmo Sport Series II L10B Coupe sold in January 2015 for inclusive premium at auction at Bonhams.

A 1970 Mazda Cosmo Series II 110S is currently, (September 2024), being fully restored by an English based Company called Yorkshire Car Restorations on YouTube. It has the original Wankel engine (10A) and original 5-speed gearbox. It has been fully stripped to bare metal and new re-fabricated parts and panels fitted, where necessary.
== Series CD (1975–1981) ==

The second generation CD Cosmo appeared in 1975 and lasted until 1981. It was known as the Cosmo AP (Anti-Pollution) in Japan, and sold internationally as the Mazda RX-5, though in some export markets its piston-powered counterpart was called the Mazda 121 (a name later applied to Mazda&#x27;s subcompact model). The anti-pollution label reflected that the cars were able to meet the strict, 1976 Japanese emissions standards, thanks to the installation of a thermal reactor which kept hydrocarbon levels down.

The CD Cosmo/RX-5 series was positioned as a personal luxury car, with a focus on comfort and high equipment levels rather than outright sportiness. When introduced, it had a fastback bodystyle with three side windows; the one just behind the B-pillar could be wound down. Inspired by the US market, in particular the 1970s era Lincoln Continental, a notchback coupé model called the Landau appeared in early 1977. Called the Cosmo L in Japan, it included an opera window and padded vinyl roof covering. Neither body style found many international buyers; it was, however, an enormous success in Japan where over 55,000 were sold in the first year alone. This new model competed with the Toyota Crown, Nissan Cedric, Nissan Gloria, and the Mitsubishi Galant Lambda coupés newly introduced to Japan.

Mazda America used the Mazda Cosmo name and offered it from 1976 through 1978, fitted with the 13B rotary engine. In the United States, the Cosmo was replaced by the smaller, lighter, and sportier Mazda RX-7. Due to its poor sales as an export, the Series II version, built from 1979, was not exported and remained a Japanese domestic sale only. In Europe, the RX-5 saw very little competition in the rotary-engine equipped market, with the introduction of the short-lived Citroën GS Birotor, as well as any remaining NSU RO80 sedans.

The Cosmo was Mazda&#x27;s largest rotary-powered coupé, based on the LA series Mazda Luce floor pan and mechanics, but slightly heavier due to body design and more luxurious appointments, including a five-link rear suspension and rear disc brakes. It was available with the 12A and 13B engines. This series Cosmo was joined by the short-lived Mazda Roadpacer, a large, heavy sedan powered only by a rotary engine.

While the powerful rotaries received most of the attention, with the 13B-engined version with a manual transmission being able to reach a top speed of , a piston-engined version was also on offer at the bottom of the range. The Cosmo 1800, used a 1769 cc (80 x 88 mm) inline-four SOHC engine that produces and . After Mazda noted a space for a more powerful piston-engined derivative, as rotary sales were slowing down because of their high fuel consumption, the bigger Cosmo 2000 with became available in March 1977.

The rotary engine had financial advantages to Japanese consumers in that the engine displacement remained below 1.5 liters, a significant determination when paying the Japanese annual road tax which kept the obligation affordable to most buyers, while having more power than traditional piston engines of the same official displacement.
== Series HB (1981–1987) ==
The third generation HB Cosmo from 1981 shared the Mazda HB chassis with its twin, the Mazda Luce. Some versions of both HB cars were sold overseas as the Mazda 929. The HB Cosmo was offered as a coupé (also called two door hardtop), as a sleek frameless window sedan (also called four door hardtop), and as a formal pillared sedan (known in Japan as saloon). The HB Cosmo is the only car in automotive history to offer a choice of gasoline and diesel piston engines, or rotary engines, and this was the last generation Cosmo to be exported.

Both the Cosmo sedan and four door hardtops were badge engineered versions of their respective Luce counterparts, with the Cosmo models sold at an exclusive dealership called &quot;Mazda Auto&quot;, while the Luce was sold at previously established Japanese Mazda dealerships. Later in 1991, &quot;Mazda Auto&quot; locations were renamed Eunos. The two door HB coupé however was only sold in Japan as a Cosmo. The range was facelifted in October 1983, at which time the fuel injected 13B-SI engine was introduced and the four-door hardtop switched from pop-up to fixed headlights. During 1984, the non-GT coupés also switched to fixed headlamps (domestic Japanese market; export markets differ in specifications and badge combinations).

When the FC series Mazda Savanna RX-7 was introduced in 1986 internationally, this series Cosmo coupe retained its top position as Mazda&#x27;s largest rotary powered personal luxury car, with a comfortable backseat, trunk, and every luxury amenity available, while adopting the retractable headlights from the RX-7.

Mazda offered three different rotary engines for the HB series. A 12A-6PI (for &quot;six-port induction&quot;), 12A-turbo and 13B-RESI, with all using electronic multiport fuel injection. The latter available with automatic transmission only. The 1982 12A-turbo Cosmo coupé was officially the fastest production car in Japan until being overtaken by the FJ20ET-powered R30 Skyline RS.

The rotary engine had financial advantages to Japanese consumers in that the engine displacement remained below 1.5 litres, a significant determination when paying the Japanese annual road tax which kept the obligation affordable to most buyers, while having more power than the traditional inline engines.

The HB Cosmo and Luce names were used in Japan, with the 929 being the export version (which was not available with the rotary engine options). While the HB Luce and Cosmo Saloon were discontinued in 1986, both Cosmo hardtops remained in production at a trickle until 1989.

The Mazda 929 Turbo EGI (Electronic Gasoline Injection) Luxury was available in Australia from 1986 to May 1987 (with these later cars produced in 1986). It used the FET engine and came only with a manual transmission. Not all two-door 929 models used the FET, most used other variants of the FE engine, either Carburetor or EGI with optional four-speed automatic transmission. The 2.0 L (1998 cc) fuel injected, turbocharged FET version of the FE produced 135 hp (100 kW) and 175 lb·ft (237 N·m). It was a water cooled 8-valve SOHC engine featuring a small turbocharger, and no intercooler.

== Series JC (Eunos Cosmo, 1990–1996) ==
The Eunos Cosmo (loosely based on the 1985 MX-03 concept car) started production in 1990 on the new JC platform. The Eunos Cosmo was the top-line touring flagship of the Eunos luxury channel. It is the only Mazda to use a triple-rotor engine. The car was a 2+2 coupé and was loaded with power amenities and other luxuries. Following the Japanese luxury theme, only an electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission was available that could be placed in manual shift mode and would change the gear selection in the dashboard display from PRNDSL for automatic transmission operation and PRND321 for manual transmission use.
Two engines were available, and both were equipped with twin sequential turbochargers; the two-rotor 13B-RE and the three-rotor 20B-REW. The triple rotor 20B had 2 litres (1962 cc) of displacement, making it the largest capacity rotary offered for sale by Mazda. It produces and of torque with twin turbochargers sourced from Hitachi. Two trim packages were offered; the S (Sport) which offered a firm suspension consisting of control arms in the front and a multilink rear suspension, with a cloth inserts added to leather interior and a full length center console accommodating four passengers, or E (Elegant) which offered a softer-tuned suspension and full leather upholstery.

The JC series Cosmo set several firsts in automotive history. Its two rotor 13B-RE and three rotor 20B-REW engines were the first Japanese-built, series production twin sequential turbo systems to be offered for sale on a rotary engine car. The internationally known FD series RX-7 didn&#x27;t receive the twin turbo 13B-REW engine until early 1992. The Eunos Cosmo was the first production car to have a built-in GPS navigation system, and the first in Japan to use the &quot;Palmnet&quot; serial data communication system for ECU-to-ECAT operation.

The fourth generation Cosmo was ahead of its time electronically as well by being offered with &quot;Car Communication System&quot;, a CRT colour touch-screen controlling climate control, mobile phone, GPS car navigation, NTSC TV, radio and CD player. The instrumentation used a LCD display rendering analog gauges with indicator needles that &quot;floated&quot; and using vivid colors for various functions.

The Cosmo was speed limited to to suit Japanese regulations, but the 20B-REW version was capable of if given a free run. With over of torque available at just 1,800 rpm, the Cosmo could launch from standstill to freeway speeds quickly; however, this came at the expense of heavy fuel consumption. The JC Cosmo was expensive even by today&#x27;s standards, as Mazda still has not matched the sales price of this car some 22 years later for anything else in its range. The availability of power and speed in the Cosmo appears extravagant in its intended market of Japan once it becomes understood that most of the driving environment consists of two-way streets that are usually zoned at or less, as mentioned in the article &quot;Speed limits in Japan&quot;

The Cosmo was manufactured from February 1990 until September 1995, and gathered a total of 8,875 sales. A split of 60/40 sales between 13B-REW and 20B-REW variants made the triple rotor 20B-REW version a rarer car. Although the Cosmo remained a Japanese market-only vehicle (export had been proposed originally under the Eunos sales channel, and under the stillborn Amati brand in the USA), used Cosmos have found their way to various RHD countries thanks to import regulations for private importers from these countries. The Cosmo appears in &quot;Sega GT&quot; and in the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; and &quot;Gran Turismo 2&quot; games, as well as the arcade game series &quot;Wangan Midnight: Maximum Tune 1&quot; through &quot;6RR&quot;.

== Cosmo 21 Concept (2002) ==
At the 2002 Tokyo Auto Salon, Mazda presented the Cosmo 21, a retro styled 21st century reinterpretation of the original Cosmo 110s of 1967 to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the Cosmo. 

Based on Mazda&#x27;s current generation of MX-5 (NB), the concept was styled and constructed by Mazda subsidiaries M&#x27;z IF (styling) and Mazda Sangyo (construction), and closely resembled the original Cosmo. The engine of the MX-5 was replaced by an early version of the Renesis rotary engine, later found in the Mazda RX-8.

The Cosmo 21 was revealed around the same time as many other retro style cars, including the Volkswagen New Beetle and the New Mini, adding to the growing list of retro style cars being produced in this era. Rumours of the Cosmo 21 entering limited production circulated in Japan, but the car remained purely a concept.

<text>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) uses icons, flags, and symbols to represent and enhance the Olympic Games. These symbols include those commonly used during Olympic competitions such as the flame, fanfare, and theme and those used both during and outside competition, such as the Olympic flag.

The Olympic flag was created in 1913 under the guidance of Baron de Coubertin of France. It was first hoisted in Alexandria, Egypt, at the 1914 Pan-Egyptian Games. The five rings on the flag represent the inhabited continents of the world (the Americas were considered as one continent and Europe was treated as distinct from Asia). It was made to contain the colours (blue, black, red, yellow, and green) which are common to almost all flags around the world.

== Motto and creed ==

The original Olympic motto is the hendiatris &quot;Citius, Altius, Fortius&quot; which is Latin for &quot;Faster, Higher, Stronger&quot;. The motto was proposed by Pierre de Coubertin upon the creation of the International Olympic Committee. Coubertin borrowed it from his friend Henri Didon, a Dominican priest who was an athletics enthusiast. Coubertin said that &quot;these three words represent a programme of moral beauty. The aesthetics of sport are intangible&quot;. The motto was introduced in 1924 at the Olympic Games in Paris. Coubertin&#x27;s Olympic ideals are expressed in the Olympic creed:

 Coubertin got this text from a sermon by the Bishop of Central Pennsylvania, Ethelbert Talbot, during the 1908 London Games.

In 2021, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), approved the addition of the word &quot;together&quot;, after an en dash, to the motto; it now reads &quot;Citius, Altius, Fortius – Communiter,&quot; Latin for &quot;Faster, Higher, Stronger – Together&quot; (or, in French, &quot;Plus vite, Plus haut, Plus fort – Ensemble&quot;). According to some Italian Latinists, such as professor Mario De Nonno and professor Giorgio Piras, the concept of acting together is not properly conveyed by &#x27;communis&#x27; nor &#x27;communiter,&#x27; and De Nonno suggests an adverb such as &#x27;Una&#x27; meaning &#x27;as one&#x27;.

== Rings ==

The Olympic rings consist of five interlocking rings, coloured blue, yellow, black, green, and red on a white field. The symbol was originally created in 1913 by Coubertin. He appears to have intended the rings to represent the five inhabited continents: Africa, America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. According to Coubertin, the colours of the rings, along with the white background, represented the colours of every competing country&#x27;s flag at the time. Upon its initial introduction, Coubertin stated the following in the August 1913 edition of &quot;Olympique&quot;:


In his article published in November 1992 in the &quot;Olympic Revue,&quot; the official magazine of the International Olympic Committee, the American historian Robert Barney explained that the idea of the interlaced rings came to Pierre de Coubertin when he was in charge of the USFSA, an association founded by the union of two French sports associations and until 1925, responsible for representing the International Olympic Committee in France. The emblem of the USFSA was two interlaced rings. Barney noted that Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung considered that circles symbolized wholeness and that their linkage symbolized continuity.

The 1914 Congress was suspended due to the outbreak of World War I, so the symbol and flag officially debuted at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium.

The symbol&#x27;s popularity and widespread use began during the lead-up to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Carl Diem, president of the Organizing Committee of the 1936 Summer Olympics, wanted to hold a torchbearers&#x27; ceremony in the stadium at Delphi, the site of the famous oracle, where the Pythian Games were also held. For this reason, he ordered the construction of a milestone with the Olympic rings carved in the sides, and that a torchbearer should carry the flame along with an escort of three others from there to Berlin. The ceremony was celebrated but the stone was never removed. Later, two American authors, Lynn and Gray Poole, when visiting Delphi in the late 1950s, saw the stone and reported in their &quot;History of the Ancient Games&quot; that the Olympic rings design came from ancient Greece. This has become known as &quot;Carl Diem&#x27;s Stone.&quot; This created a myth that the symbol had an ancient Greek origin.

The current view of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is that the symbol &quot;reinforces the idea&quot; that the Olympic Movement is international and welcomes all countries of the world to join. As can be read in the Olympic Charter, the Olympic symbol represents the union of the &quot;five continents&quot; of the world and the meeting of athletes from throughout the world at the Olympic Games. However, no continent is represented by any specific ring. The 1949–50 edition of the IOC&#x27;s &quot;Green Booklet&quot; stated that each colour corresponded to a particular continent: &quot;blue for Europe, yellow for Asia, black for Africa, green for Australia, and red for America&quot;. This assertion was reversed in 1951 because there was no evidence that Coubertin had intended it: &quot;at the very most he might perhaps have admitted it afterwards&quot;. Nevertheless, the pre-2014 logo of the Association of National Olympic Committees placed the logo of each of its five continental associations inside the ring of the corresponding colour.

An Olympic Rings emoji was added to WhatsApp on 24 July 2016 in version 2.16.7, it was later removed on 15 August 2016 in version 2.16.9. It consisted of five characters joined with s, forming a joined character sequence. This was presumably part of a temporary agreement with the International Olympic Committee.

== Different types of flags ==


Pierre de Coubertin created the Olympic flag in 1913.
=== Specific flags used ===

There are specific Olympic flags that are displayed by cities that will be hosting the next Olympic games. During each Olympic closing ceremony in what is traditionally known as the Antwerp or Oslo Ceremony, the flag is passed from the mayor of one host city to the next host, where it will then be taken to the new host city and displayed at its city hall. These special flags should not be confused with the larger Olympic flags manufactured specifically for each game, which are flown over the stadium during all the duration of the Games and then retired. Because there is no specific flag for this purpose, the flags flown over the stadiums generally have subtle differences, including minor colour variations, and, more noticeably, the presence (or lack) of white outlines around each ring.

==== Antwerp flag ====

During the Opening Ceremony of the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium, the Olympic flag with the five rings signifying the universality of the Olympic Games was raised for the first time at an Olympic Games. At the end of the Games, the flag could not be found and a new Olympic flag had to be made for the handover ceremony to the officials of the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. Despite it being a replacement, the IOC officially still calls this the &quot;Antwerp Flag&quot; instead of the &quot;Paris Flag&quot;. It was passed on to the next organizing city of the Summer Olympics until the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Norway, when a separate Olympic flag was created to be used only at the Winter Olympics &quot;(see below)&quot;. The 1924 flag then continued to be used at the Summer Olympics until the Games of Seoul 1988 when it was retired.

In 1997, at a banquet hosted by the US Olympic Committee, a reporter was interviewing Hal Haig Prieste who had won a bronze medal in platform diving as a member of the 1920 US Olympic team. The reporter mentioned that the IOC had not been able to find out what had happened to the original Olympic flag. &quot;I can help you with that,&quot; Prieste said, &quot;It&#x27;s in my suitcase.&quot; At the end of the Antwerp Olympics, spurred on by teammate Duke Kahanamoku, he climbed a flagpole and stole the Olympic flag. For 77 years the flag was stored away in the bottom of his suitcase. The flag was returned to the IOC by Prieste, by then 103 years old, in a special ceremony held at the 2000 Games in Sydney. The original Antwerp Flag was placed on display at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, with a plaque thanking him for donating it. The flag returned to Antwerp in 2004 and since 2013, the year that Antwerp bore the title of European Sports Capital, the flag was displayed in the entrance hall of Antwerp&#x27;s city hall. In 2017, however, the flag was stored in the collection of the MAS due to the renovation of the town hall.

While the flag is recognized by the IOC, critics and historians note that the returned flag is not the one that was used in the 1920 opening ceremony, as the original flag was much larger than the one returned by Prieste.

==== Oslo flag ====

The Oslo flag was presented to the IOC by the mayor of Oslo, Norway, during the 1952 Winter Olympics. Between 1952 and 2014, the flag was passed to the next organizing city for the Winter Olympics, with its last appearance in Sochi in the 2014 Winter Olympics. Currently, the actual Oslo flag is kept preserved in a special box, and in its last appearances (Torino 2006 to Sochi 2014), replicas had been used instead.

==== Seoul flag ====
As a successor to the Antwerp Flag, the Seoul flag was presented to the IOC at the 1988 Summer Olympics by the city of Seoul, South Korea, and was passed on to the next organizing cities of the Summer Olympics between 1988 and 2012. Its last appearance was in London in the 2012 Summer Olympics.

==== Rio de Janeiro flag ====

As a successor to the Seoul Flag, the Rio de Janeiro flag was presented to the IOC at the 2016 Summer Olympics by the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and has since been passed to the next organizing cities of the Summer Olympics.

==== Pyeongchang flag ====

As a successor to the Oslo Flag, the Pyeongchang flag was presented to the IOC at the 2018 Winter Olympics by the city of Pyeongchang, South Korea, and has since then been passed to the next organizing city of the Winter Olympics.

==== Singapore flag ====

For the inaugural Youth Olympic Games, an Olympic flag was created for the junior version of the Games. The flag is similar to the Olympic flag, but has the host city and year on it and was first presented to Singapore by IOC President Jacques Rogge. During the closing ceremony on 26 August 2010, Singapore officials presented it to the next organizing committee, Nanjing 2014.

==== Innsbruck flag ====

For the inaugural winter Youth Olympic Games, an Olympic flag was presented to the IOC at the 2012 Winter Youth Olympics by the city of Innsbruck, Austria, and has since then been passed on to the next organizing city of the Winter Youth Olympics.

== Flame and torch relay ==
The modern tradition of moving the Olympic flame via a relay system from Greece to the Olympic venue began with the Berlin Games in 1936. Months before the Games are held, the Olympic flame is lit on a torch, with the rays of the Sun concentrated by a parabolic reflector, at the site of the Ancient Olympics in Olympia, Greece. The torch is then taken out of Greece, most often to be taken around the country or continent where the Games are held. The Olympic torch is carried by athletes, leaders, celebrities, and ordinary people alike, and at times in unusual conditions, such as being electronically transmitted via satellite for Montreal 1976, submerged underwater without being extinguished for Sydney 2000, or in space and at the North Pole for Sochi 2014. On the final day of the torch relay, the day of the Opening Ceremony, the Flame reaches the main stadium and is used to light a cauldron situated in a prominent part of the venue to signify the beginning of the Games.

== Medals and diplomas ==

Olympic medals and diplomas are awarded to the highest-finishing competitors in each event at the Olympic Games. The medals are made of gold-plated silver (for the gold medals), silver, or bronze, and are awarded to the top three finishers in a particular event. Each medal for an Olympiad has a common design, decided upon by the organizers for the particular games. For medals awarded at Summer Games, the obverse side has an image of Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, holding a palm in her left hand and a winner&#x27;s crown in her right, and the Colosseum in Rome in the background. In contrast, at Winter Games the creators of the medals have complete freedom to choose their designs.

The original medal design, created by Giuseppe Cassioli, was used from the 1928 Summer Olympics to the 2000 Summer Olympics. The design underwent a drastic change for the 2004 Summer Olympics, when Cassioli&#x27;s design was replaced by a more modern design connected to Greece. The obverse side was changed to make more explicit references to the Greek goddess and traditions. In this design, the goddess Nike flies into the grounds of the Panathenaic Stadium, symbolizing the renewal of the Games. The new design was created by Greek jewelry designer Elena Votsi.

For each Summer Olympics from 2004 onwards, the reverse side, as well as the labels for each Olympiad, were changed to reflect scenic images or locations from the host city.

Olympic diplomas are given to competitors placing fourth, fifth, and sixth since 1949, and to competitors placing seventh and eighth since 1981.

== Anthems ==

The &quot;Olympic Hymn&quot;, officially known as the &quot;Olympic Anthem&quot;, is played when the Olympic flag is raised. It was composed by Spyridon Samaras with words from a poem of the Greek poet and writer Kostis Palamas. Both the poet and the composer were the choice of Demetrius Vikelas, a Greek Pro-European, and the first President of the IOC. The anthem was performed for the first time for the ceremony of opening of the 1896 Athens Olympic Games but was not declared the official hymn by the IOC until 1958. In the following years, every hosting location commissioned the composition of a specific Olympic hymn for their own edition of the Games until the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley.

Other notable Olympic anthems and fanfares include:
* &quot;Olympische Hymne&quot;: A composition for orchestra and mixed chorus composed by Richard Strauss for the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics.
* The &quot;Olympic Fanfare&quot; for the 1952 Helsinki Summer Olympics: this was originally composed by Aarre Merikanto for the 1940 Summer Olympics, which were cancelled. Merikanto&#x27;s Fanfare won the fanfare contest organized in Finland in 1939, but the score was lost for over a decade; when rediscovered in 1951, it was decided to use it in 1952. It was recorded in 1953.
* &quot;Bugler&#x27;s Dream&quot;: Written in 1958 by Leo Arnaud as part of his &quot;Charge Suite&quot;, the theme is often thought of by Americans as the &quot;Olympic Theme&quot; due to its usage in television coverage by ABC and NBC, starting with the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo.
* The &quot;Olympic March&quot;: The theme written by Yūji Koseki for the Tokyo 1964 Summer Olympics theme song.
* &quot;Olympic Fanfare 1972&quot;: The winning submission for the Munich 1972 Summer Olympics theme song, used as the TV signature tune of the German Olympic Center (Deutsches Olympia-Zentrum, DOZ) and the prelude to the medal ceremonies, composed by Herbert Rehbein. It was performed by the Orchestra of the Bavarian Broadcasting Company (&quot;Orchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks&quot;) and members of the Air Force Band Neubiberg, conducted by Willy Mattes.
* &quot;Olympic Fanfare and Theme&quot;: Composed by John Williams for the Los Angeles 1984 Summer Olympics, the theme was performed in the opening ceremonies by the United States Army Herald Trumpets conducted by then-Captain David Deitrick. The first recording, performed by an orchestra composed of Los Angeles-area musicians, was released in its entirety on the LP and cassette album &quot;The Official Music of the XXIIIrd Olympiad Los Angeles 1984&quot;, with a concurrent Japan-only CD release (which went on to win a Grammy in 1985). A slightly different arrangement of the piece was released on the Philips album &quot;By Request: The Best of John Williams and the Boston Pops Orchestra&quot;. In 1996, an alternate version of &quot;Olympic Fanfare and Theme&quot; was released on the album &quot;Summon the Heroes&quot; for the Atlanta Olympic Games, replacing the first part of the piece with Arnaud&#x27;s &quot;Bugler&#x27;s Dream&quot;. The theme was used in the closing ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games as the countries&#x27; flagbearers entered the BC Place field surrounding the Olympic cauldron, and during the Antwerp Ceremony when the Olympic flag was brought into the stadium by Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson.
* &quot;The Olympic Spirit&quot;: The theme written by John Williams for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul and used in the corresponding NBC broadcasts.
* &quot;Summon the Heroes&quot;: The theme written by John Williams for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
* &quot;Theme from The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot;: The theme song to this television show, composed by Randy Edelman, was first used by NBC for teaser commercial and promo spots in 1996; it would be retired following the 2016 Summer Olympics.
* &quot;Call of the Champions&quot;: The theme written by John Williams for the 2002 Salt Lake Winter Olympics.

Several other composers have contributed Olympic music, including Henry Mancini, Francis Lai, Marvin Hamlisch, Philip Glass, David Foster, Mikis Theodorakis, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Vangelis, Basil Poledouris, Michael Kamen, and Mark Watters.

== Kotinos ==

The &quot;kotinos&quot; (), is an olive branch, originally of wild olive-tree, intertwined to form a circle or a horse-shoe, introduced by Heracles. In the ancient Olympic Games there were no gold, silver, or bronze medals. There was only one winner per event, crowned with an olive wreath made of wild olive leaves from a sacred tree near the temple of Zeus at Olympia. The victorious athletes were honored, feted, and praised. Their deeds were heralded and chronicled so that future generations could appreciate their accomplishments.

According to the Greek historian Herodotus, the Persian king Xerxes was interrogating some Arcadians after the Battle of Thermopylae. He inquired why there were so few Greek men defending Thermopylae. The answer was &quot;All other men are participating in the Olympic Games&quot;. When asked &quot;What is the prize for the winner?&quot;, he was told &quot;an olive-wreath&quot;. Tigranes, one of his generals, replied &quot;Good heavens! Mardonius, what kind of men are these against whom you have brought us to fight? Men who do not compete for possessions, but for honour.&quot; 

In his play Plutus, the Greek playwright Aristophanes suggested that the wreath being made of wild olive instead of gold signified that Zeus hoards his gold for himself.

In later times, athletes were rewarded with a generous sum of money as well as the &quot;kotinos&quot;. The &quot;kotinos&quot; tradition was renewed specifically for the Athens 2004 Games, although in this case it was bestowed together with the gold medal. Apart from its use in the awards ceremonies, the &quot;kotinos&quot; was chosen as the 2004 Summer Olympics emblem.

== Olympic salute ==
The Olympic salute is a variant of the Roman salute, with the right arm and hand stretched and pointing upward, the palm outward and downward, with the fingers touching. However, unlike the Roman salute, the arm is raised higher and at an angle to the right from the shoulder. The greeting is visible on the official posters of the games at Paris 1924 and Berlin 1936.

The Olympic salute has fallen out of use since World War II because of its resemblance to the Nazi salute. It was used by the French team in the opening ceremony of the 1948 Winter Olympics.

== Mascots ==

Since the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France, the Olympic Games have had a mascot, usually an animal native to the area or occasionally human figures representing the cultural heritage. The first major mascot in the Olympic Games was Misha in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Misha was used extensively during the opening and closing ceremonies, had a TV animated cartoon, and appeared on several merchandise products. Nowadays, most of the merchandise aimed at young people focuses on the mascots, rather than the Olympic flag or organization logos.

== Intellectual property ==

The Olympic movement is very protective of its symbols, and many jurisdictions have given the movement exclusive trademark rights to any interlocking arrangement of five rings, and usage of the word &quot;Olympic&quot;. The rings are not eligible for copyright protection, both because of their date of creation and because five circles arranged in a pattern do not reach the threshold of originality required to be copyrighted.

The movement has taken action against numerous groups alleged to have violated their trademarks, including the Gay Games; the Minneapolis-based band The Hopefuls, formerly The Olympic Hopefuls; the Redneck Olympics or Redneck Games; Awana Clubs International, a Christian youth ministry who used the term for its competitive games; Wizards of the Coast, publisher at the time of the IOC&#x27;s complaint of the card game &quot;Legend of the Five Rings&quot;; and Philippine sporting good chain Olympic Village.

In 1938, the Norwegian brewery Frydenlund patented a label for its root beer which featured the five Olympic rings. In 1952, when Norway was to host the Winter Olympics, the Olympic Committee was notified by Norway&#x27;s Patent Office that it was Frydenlund who owned the rights to the rings in that country. Today, the successor company Ringnes AS owns the rights to use the patented five rings on its root beer. In addition, a few other companies have been successful in using the Olympic name, such as Olympic Paint, which has a paintbrush in the form of a torch as its logo, and the former Greek passenger carrier Olympic Airlines.

Certain other sporting organizations and events have been granted permission by the IOC to use the word &quot;Olympics&quot; in their name, such as the Special Olympics, an international sporting event held every four years for people with intellectual disabilities.

The IOC maintains exclusive ownership and control of the use of Olympic symbols through an international treaty and the IOC&#x27;s demand for the enactment of laws in hosting locations to grant special trademark protection to Olympic symbols. In 1981, the Nairobi Treaty on the Protection of the Olympic Symbol (Nairobi Treaty), a treaty administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization, was signed by fifty-two states. All fifty-two signatories to the Nairobi Treaty became obligated under the treaty to protect Olympic symbols against use for commercial purposes without authorization of the IOC. Under the Nairobi Treaty, if the IOC authorizes use of an Olympic symbol in a country that is a party to the treaty, then that country&#x27;s National Olympic Committee is entitled to a portion of any revenue generated from the IOC&#x27;s authorization of use. The Nairobi Treaty provides for a framework of international intellectual property protection of the licensure of all Olympic symbols.

In recent years, organizing committees have also demanded the passing of laws to combat ambush marketing by non-official sponsors during the Games – such as the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006 – putting heavy restrictions on using any term or imagery that could constitute an unauthorized association with the games, including mere mentioning of the host city, the year, and others.

Bob Barney co-authored the book &quot;Selling the Five Rings&quot; (2002), with Stephen Wenn and Scott Martyn, which discussed the history of corporate sponsorships and television rights for the Olympic Games. Barney argued that the Olympic torch had been commercialized since its inception in 1936, and that sponsors of the torch relay benefit from brand awareness. In contrast, the medal podium ceremonies, which began in 1932, had not become commercialized since no advertising is allowed inside Olympic venues.

<text>The University of Santo Tomas (UST; ), officially the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas, Manila or colloquially as Ustê (), is a private Catholic research university in Manila, Philippines. Founded on April 28, 1611, by Spanish friar Miguel de Benavides, third Archbishop of Manila, it has the oldest extant university charter in Asia and is one of the world&#x27;s largest Catholic universities in terms of enrollment found on one campus. It is the main campus of the University of Santo Tomas System that is run by the Order of Preachers.

UST was granted the title &quot;Royal&quot; by King Charles III of Spain in 1785. Pope Leo XIII made UST a pontifical university in 1902. Pope Pius XII bestowed the title of &quot;The Catholic University of the Philippines&quot; in 1947. The university houses the first and oldest engineering, law, medical, and pharmacy schools in the country.

The university offers programs in over 180 undergraduate and graduate specializations. It has 26 programs recognized by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) as Centers of Excellence and Centers of Development, ranking second in the country and first among private educational institutions. It is awarded institutional accreditation by the CHED through the Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines (FAAP). The university has the highest number of Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities&#x27; Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA)-accredited programs in the country, with 59.

The main campus is the largest university in the city of Manila and is home to 22 degree-granting colleges, a parish church, and a teaching hospital. The National Museum of the Philippines declared four of the university&#x27;s structures and the UST Baybayin Documents as National Cultural Treasures.

UST alumni and faculty include 30 Catholic saints, four presidents of the Philippines, 17 senators, nine chief justices, 20 national artists, a national scientist, and five billionaires.

The athletic teams are the Growling Tigers, who are members of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines and have won the overall championships more than any other university.

==History==

The foundation of the university is attributed to the Spanish friar Miguel de Benavides. He came to the Philippines with the first Dominican mission in 1587. He went on to become bishop of Nueva Segovia and was promoted to become the third archbishop of Manila in 1602. Upon his death on July 26, 1605, Benavides bequeathed his library and personal property worth ₱1,500 to be used as the seed fund for the establishment of an institution of higher learning. Two days before, he made a testament in the presence of Dominican priests Domingo de Nieva and Bernardo de Santa Catalina, who were the executors of his last will. In June 1606, Nueva Segovia bishop Diego de Soria wrote a letter to King Philip III of Spain informing him of the plans of founding a colegio. He also added that the colegio be given authorization to grant academic degrees similar to those of the &quot;Colegio de Santo Tomas&quot; in Avila, Spain.

In 1609, permission to open the college was requested from King Philip III of Spain, which only reached Manila two years later. The university was founded on April 28, 1611. The act of foundation was signed by frays Baltasar Fort, Bernardo Navarro, and Francisco Minayo. Bernardo de Santa Catalina carried out the wishes of Benavides and was able to secure a building near the Dominican church and convent in the walled city of Intramuros in Manila for the college. The authorities took the example of universities in Spain, such as the University of Salamanca, and in Spanish America, such as the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico, to become a model for the university. UST was first called the College of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary (), and in 1619, it was renamed &quot;Colegio de Santo Tomas&quot; in honor of the Dominican theologian, St. Thomas Aquinas. On November 20, 1645, Pope Innocent X issued the papal bull &quot;In Supereminenti&quot;, which elevated the &quot;Colegio de Santo Tomas&quot; to a university and placed it under papal authority.

Following the royal decree of King Philip V of Spain in 1733 and bull &quot;Dudum emanarunt&quot; of Pope Clement XII in 1734, the Faculty of Canon Law () and the Faculty of Civil Law () were established.

The Royal Decree of May 20, 1865, from Queen Isabella II of Spain gave power to UST for the supervision of all secondary schools. Being the only institution of higher learning at that time, UST acted as the Department of Education of the country. After five years, the Minister of Overseas Colonies Segismundo Moret issued a decree that converted &quot;Real y Pontificia Universidad de Santo Tomas&quot; into &quot;Real y Pontificia Universidad de Filipinas&quot;. In 1871, the &quot;Superior Gobierno de Filipinas&quot; issued a decree that established the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy (). UST was allowed to grant a licentiate degree in medicine. From 1877 to 1901, 329 students were granted the licentiate degree. José Rizal studied medicine at the university from 1878 to 1882, where he was granted the rare privilege of studying simultaneously the preparatory course of medicine and the first year of medicine. The university began granting the degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1902 during the new American system.

The university was registered on January 13, 1908, as a non-stock, non-profit educational institution under Act 1459 with the corporate name of &quot;Real y Pontificia Universidad de Santo Tomas de Manila&quot;. With the growing student population, the Dominicans were given a 21.5-hectare plot of land at the Sulucan Hills in Sampaloc, Manila and built its new campus. In 1924, it began accepting female enrollees. All courses and departments moved to the new campus, with the exception of medicine and civil law, both of which stayed in Intramuros.

During World War II, the Imperial Japanese forces converted UST into an internment camp for enemy aliens, mostly Americans living in the Philippines. Their secret police division, known as Kenpeitai, turned the original Intramuros campus into a garrison and torture chamber, destroying it by fire in 1944. Over 3,700 internees were freed, 2,870 of whom were Americans, and over 600 were either killed or died from sickness or starvation in the internment camp for 37 months from January 1942 until February 11, 1945, when the camp was liberated by General Douglas MacArthur.

UST was given the title &quot;Royal&quot; by King Charles III of Spain in 1785, in recognition of the university&#x27;s loyalty in defending Manila against the British troops. In 1974, then prince King Juan Carlos I of Spain visited UST and was conferred doctor of laws honoris causa and the title Royal Patron, as a revival of the tradition dating back to 1680 when King Charles II of Spain was named the first patron. Queen Sofía of Spain, who visited with her husband in 1974, came back in 2012.

In 1902, UST was officially declared a pontifical university by the &quot;Quae Mari Sinico&quot;, an apostolic constitution signed by Pope Leo XIII. As a pontifical university, UST has been visited by the pope four times since 1970, Pope Paul VI in 1970, Pope John Paul II in 1981 and 1995, and by Pope Francis in 2015. During the quadricentennial year in 2011, Pope Benedict XVI sent a special envoy and gave a video message. In 1947, Pope Pius XII bestowed the appellate name &quot;The Catholic University of the Philippines&quot;.

UST&#x27;s first Filipino rector was Leonardo Legaspi, who served UST from 1971 to 1977. At the onset of martial law in the Philippines in 1972, he issued guidelines from a Department Order about the Marcos martial law and sought the help of the faculty members for the maintenance of discipline imposed by the government. &quot;The Varsitarian&quot; continued to operate during martial law, even when several national newspapers were shut down. The UST administration cautioned &quot;The Varsitarian&quot; against publishing anti-government sentiments, but the publication still urged the students to resist the dictatorship. The student council from the Faculty of Arts and Letters became the first legitimate student government in the country since martial law was declared.

UST&#x27;s recognition as the oldest extant university in the Philippines was disputed by the University of San Carlos. Since its establishment, the UST&#x27;s academic life has been interrupted only twice; from 1898 to 1899, during the Philippine Revolution against Spain, and from 1942 to 1945, during the Japanese occupation of the country. On December 1, 2010, the House of Representatives passed Resolution No. 51, &quot;Resolution Congratulating the University of Santo Tomas on the occasion of its Quadricentennial Anniversary in 2011,&quot; which read &quot;founded on April 28, 1611, by Archbishop Miguel de Benavides&quot; and &quot;has the oldest extant university charter in the Philippines and Asia.&quot;

In the second term of 2023–2024, 33,407 students were enrolled in the university&#x27;s undergraduate and graduate programs, while 7,250 were enrolled in basic education.

===The university seal and colors===
The oldest seal used by the university is first seen in an examination book &quot;Libros de piques&quot; that is found in the UST Archives.

The university seal from 1868 to 1983 is set in a cardioid shield. The globus cruciger and the Dominican hound carrying a flaming torch are perched atop the shield. Directly below is the sun of Thomas Aquinas, whose rays extend throughout the whole seal. The seal depicts three or four ovals bearing different coats of arms.

In the 1868–1935 seal, the left oval contains the Papal insignia symbolizing the apostolic concession by which the college was raised to be a university. The right oval contains the coat of arms similar to the coat of arms of Spain used in 1700-1868 and 1834–1930 to indicate the protection which Philip IV of Spain vouchsafed to the university. The center oval contains the cross of the Dominican order, which is surrounded by a rosary, crowned by the star of Saint Dominic, and flanked below by a palm branch (representing martyrdom) to its left and white lilies to the right.

The inner lower border of the seal is lined with the Latin name of the university &quot;Pontificia et Regalis S(ancti) Thomæ Aquinatis Universitas Manilana&quot;. The upper half of the seal is flanked by laurel leaves on both sides and the lower half by a collar similar to the insignia used the by the Order of the Golden Fleece.

The 1935–1938, 1937–1946, and 1957–1983 versions had changes depending on the government of the country. In the 1935–1938 seal, the coat of arms of the Commonwealth of the Philippines replaced the coat of arms of the Spanish East Indies. A fourth oval was added in the 1937–1946 seal to include the Spanish East Indies. The 1957–1983 seal replaced the coat of arms of the Commonwealth of the Philippines with the coat of arms of the Philippines.
In June 2011, a new seal was unveiled, but due to its typeface and color selections, it garnered critical reaction on social media. The sudden change for a new seal was made after the Roman Curia suggested uniformity in the titles and the name of UST. The university&#x27;s Council of Regents decided to include UST&#x27;s name in the new seal and drop the titles of Royal and Pontifical because they are not part of the official name of the university. The controversial seal was revised a month after. The Council of Regents reverted to the previous seal and included UST&#x27;s honorific titles Pontifical and Royal, and the name of the university.

The current seal of the university is set in a modern French shield quartered by the Dominican Cross. The surrounding inscription reads the full name of UST: Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas, Manila, and the foundation year, 1611. The symbols are set on a field of Marian blue. The colors, as officially defined by the university&#x27;s identity guidelines, define the gold and blue as Pantone 213 C and Pantone 298 C, respectively.

The Tongues of Fire is the logo of the UST Quadricentennial Celebration. It features the outline of the UST Main Building tower and four flames that spell out UST. The tongues of fire reference the future of the university and are reminiscent of the stripes of a tiger. It is designed by alumnus Francisco Doplon.

==Campus==
The UST main campus is the largest university in the city of Manila. Located on España Boulevard in the Sampaloc district, it is spread over an almost perfect square of 21.5 hectares. The university is part of the University Belt. In 1927, the university transferred to its present campus when the Dominicans deemed the Intramuros campus inadequate for the university&#x27;s growing population.

The architectural style of buildings within the campus is influenced by the construction period, resulting in a significant variation. The designs of early structures are done by university priests and professors who used styles from the Renaissance Revival, Art Deco, Bauhaus, to International Style. The Sampaloc campus saw an extensive redevelopment at the turn of the century as 12 out of the 24 major buildings were constructed from 2002 to 2023. Several buildings, such as the Beato Angelico Building, the Thomas Aquinas Research Complex, and the hospital buildings, have adopted the capital and column of the UST Main Building, one of the university&#x27;s iconic symbols. Seven buildings are also named after beatified Dominicans and Dominican saints.

The central axis of the campus comprises the Arch of the Centuries, the Plaza Benavides, the Benavides Monument, the Main Building, the Quadricentennial Square, the Miguel de Benavides Library, the Tan Yan Kee Student Center, and the upcoming Henry Sy Sr. Hall. Erected around 1680, the Arch of the Centuries served as the main entrance to the first campus in Intramuros. It transferred to its present site in 1954. The Main Building, designed by the priest and engineer Roque Ruaño, was built from 1924 to 1927. It is the first structure on the campus and once served as the Kilometer Zero of Manila. It houses the Faculty of Civil Law, the Faculty of Pharmacy, the College of Science, the Museum of Arts and Sciences, and the administrative offices.

The northeast quadrant of the campus includes the St. Raymund Penafort Building and the health and medical buildings. St. Raymund de Peñafort Building is built in International Style in 1955 and is home to the Faculty of Arts and Letters and the College of Commerce and Business Administration. Built in 1952, the Bauhaus-inspired San Martin de Porres Building houses the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, the College of Nursing, and the College of Rehabilitation Sciences. The UST Hospital complex comprises the main St. Vincent Building, the Benavides Cancer Institute, the St. John Paul II Building, and the UST Hospital Clinical Division. The St. John Paul II Building was inaugurated in 2019 and serves as the extension of the UST Hospital.

The northwest quadrant comprises the Central Seminary, the Botanical Garden, the Benavides Building, the Central Laboratory Building, and the Thomas Aquinas Research Complex (TARC). The Central Seminary, built in 1933, is designed by Fernando Ocampo in Art Deco style. It also houses the Santísimo Rosario Parish and the Ecclesiastical Faculties. The Botanical Garden was established in 1932 and continues to serve students in the research of Philippine flora and medicinal plants. TARC is home to the Graduate School.

The southwest quadrant includes the Buenaventura Garcia Paredes, O.P. Building (BGPOP), the swimming pool, the UST Publishing House, the Beato Angelico Building, and the football field. BGPOP, also known as the Thomasian Alumni Center, sits on the site of the old UST Gymnasium. The Art Deco facade of the old gymnasium is preserved for its historical significance. The Beato Angelico Building occupies the site of the old UST Press, which was constructed in 1953. The College of Architecture and the College of Fine Arts and Design transferred from the Roque Ruano Building to the Beato Angelico Building in 2003.

The southeast quadrant comprises the Alfredo M. Velayo College of Accountancy and Multi-Deck Carpark Building, the Albertus Magnus Building, the Roque Ruaño Building, and the Quadricentennial Pavilion complex. The Albertus Magnus Building houses the College of Education and the Conservatory of Music. The Roque Ruaño Building, which houses the Faculty of Engineering, is built in 1952 and designed by Julio Victor Rocha. It initiated the application of the Niemeyer-inspired brise soleil in local buildings. The Quadricentennial Pavilion was the venue of the CNN Philippines vice-presidential debates in 2016, senatorial debates in 2019, and vice-presidential and presidential debates in 2022.

The Blessed Pier Giorgio Frassati Building is located across the main campus and is connected by the UST Link Bridge. The Frassati Building houses the Senior High School, the College of Information and Computing Sciences, the DOST-TOMASInno Center, and several administrative offices. At its completion in 2019, it became the tallest educational building in the Philippines with 23 floors.

A stormwater drainage system that would help in mitigating UST&#x27;s seasonal flood problem was completed in 2021. The underground system covers seven street zones that can hold 11.25 million liters of water.
As part of the celebration of the 2022 Thomasian Welcome Walk, the new UST block letters and the Bengal Tiger statue were unveiled at the Plaza Mayor.

The campus was declared a National Historical Landmark by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines in 2011. Four of the university&#x27;s structures were also declared National Cultural Treasures by the National Museum namely, the Arch of the Centuries, Main Building, the Central Seminary, and the university&#x27;s open spaces.

===Satellite campuses===
The UST in Manila is the main campus of the University of Santo Tomas System, which comprises three other existing campuses and one upcoming UST campus in Santa Rosa, Laguna. UST Angelicum College in Quezon City and University of Santo Tomas–Legazpi in Legazpi, Albay integrated with the UST System in 2017.

UST Angelicum College is located in the Santo Domingo Church complex in Quezon City. It offers basic education programs, a home study program, and undergraduate programs. The campus was founded as the Angelicum School in 1972 by Rogelio Alarcon. The school changed its name to Angelicum College in 1996 after offering undergraduate courses in 1995. It offers programs in communication, entrepreneurship, human resource management, and information technology.

UST-Legazpi, formerly known as the Aquinas University of Legazpi, is located in Legazpi, Albay. It is the biggest catholic university in the Bicol Region, offering courses in the fields of law, medical, architecture, engineering, accountancy, teacher education, and arts and sciences. The university also has its own hospital.

UST General Santos is an 80-hectare campus in southern Philippines that will initially offer programs in agricultural and fishery research, arts and humanities, business and accountancy, engineering and technology, and pharmaceutical sciences. The university acquired the land of the new campus in 1997, but the construction was stalled by land classification problems and local politics. In 2013, the local city council approved the rezoning of the university site to institutional from agricultural. The consultation and public hearing for the first phase of the establishment of the new campus was conducted in 2017. The construction broke ground on April 20, 2018, and was headed by then university rector Herminio Dagohoy. The campus opened on April 11, 2024.

UST Santa Rosa is a 40-hectare campus in Laguna that will offer undergraduate programs in science and engineering. The campus first broke ground on April 19, 2006, which was led by then university rector Tamerlane Lana and attended by UST board member and tycoon Lucio Tan. The development of the campus was delayed for several years by changes in the administration, the Quadricentennial Celebration from 2009 to 2012, and prioritization of the construction projects in the main campus. On September 10, 2017, a second groundbreaking ceremony was held and led by then university rector Herminio Dagohoy. The construction of the first building in the campus, the UST–Dr. Tony Tan Caktiong Innovation Center, began in December 2020. The center is named after an alumnus and Jollibee Foods Corporation founder Tony Tan Caktiong, and it will be an annex of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST)-TOMASInno Center.

==Administration and organization==
UST operates under the Code of Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church, the apostolic constitution &quot;Ex corde Ecclesiae&quot;, the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines supplementary ordinances of the &quot;Ex corde Ecclesiae&quot;, and laws of the Philippine government.

The executive authorities of the university are the chancellor, the vice-chancellor, the rector, and the vice-rector. The &quot;ex-officio&quot; chancellor is the Master of the Order of Preachers. He appoints the rector of the university upon the approval of the Holy See. Currently, Filipino-Dominican priest Gerard Timoner III holds the position. The &quot;ex-officio&quot; vice-chancellor of the university is the Prior Provincial of the Dominican Province of the Philippines. The rector serves as the university&#x27;s chief executive officer. He is assisted by a council of regents, an academic senate and an economic council. A dean heads an academic unit while being assisted by a faculty council and a regent, who is a member of the Order of Preachers.

UST Manila has 19 civil colleges, three ecclesiastical colleges, and three basic education schools. These are academic units that are organically interdependent with one another. A college may be referred to as a faculty, college, school, or institute, depending on when the academic unit was founded. The &quot;faculties&quot;, such as the Faculty of Civil Law, are formed during the Spanish colonial period, while &quot;colleges&quot; and &quot;schools&quot;, such as the College of Education and the Graduate School have been used since the American period. &quot;Institutes&quot; are adjuncts or naturally separate units of a specific faculty or college. Once an adjunct institute reaches a certain enrollment threshold, it becomes a separate college, independent of its faculty or parent college. The College of Information and Computing Sciences was founded as an institute when it separated from the Faculty of Engineering in 2014. It was elevated to the status of a college in 2021.

The UST Central Seminary and the UST Hospital have separate statutes but are still under the university. As a pontifical university, the Faculty of Sacred Theology, Faculty of Philosophy, and the Faculty of Canon Law or the UST Faculties of Ecclesiastical Studies are also governed by the apostolic constitution &quot;Veritatis gaudium&quot; that was issued by Pope Francis on December 8, 2017.

UST has three basic education schools, the Junior High School, the Education High School which serves as a laboratory for the College of Education, and the Senior High School. The UST Elementary School used to offer primary education for children in the K-12 levels, but stopped accepting applications for the K-level sometime in the 2010s.

==Academic profile==

UST offers over 63 undergraduate programs in over 100 undergraduate specializations, three professional programs, over 50 master programs, and over 20 doctorate programs enrolling 42,941 students in the first term of the academic year 2024–2025. The Faculty of Engineering received the most freshmen with 4,239 students and the Faculty of Art and Letters followed with 3,600. In 2018, there were 371 foreign students, majority were from Asian countries. The UST Hospital, which serves as the training hospital of the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, offers 21 residency training programs. The university produced 8,131 graduates in 2022.

===Admissions===

The university administers the University of Santo Tomas Entrance Test (USTET) as one of the admission requirements for high school and college in UST Manila, college in UST General Santos, and senior high school in UST Angelicum College. The results are released on January 28, the feast of day of St. Thomas Aquinas. In 2020 and 2021, the USTET was replaced by the UST Admission Rating (USTAR) because of the COVID-19 situation in the country. The USTAR is a score that computes several parameters obtained primarily from the academic records of the applicant. In 2020, the university received 48,411 applications for the USTAR, admitting 7,772 college freshmen for the school year 2021–2022. The Faculty of Engineering had the most freshmen for three consecutive years, with 1,071 students. The USTET resumed in 2022 for the 2023–2024 school year.

The USTET is also conducted in 35 provincial testing centers and 8 international testing sites, namely Hong Kong, Doha, Dubai, Manama, Muscat, Al-Khobar, Jeddah, and Riyadh.

The Faculty of Medicine and Surgery separately conducts a psychological examination for the first-year Doctor of Medicine program as part of the admission process. However, the scholastic standing and NMAT score are given the biggest weight in accepting applicants. Applicants must have a GWA score of at least 2.00/B+/86% and an NMAT score of at least 85th percentile. About 480 candidates are accepted out of 1,700 to 1,900 applicants annually. No entrance examination was held in 2021. For the B.S. in Basic Human Studies (LEAPMed) program, the faculty shortlists the top 200 USTET college applicants using the UST Predictive Scoring. It comprises the USTET score or USTAR rating, the LEAPMed examination score, and the IQ score. After an interview and a psychological examination, only the top 90 applicants are accepted.

The Faculty of Civil Law also conducts a separate entrance examination for the degree of Juris Doctor.

===Faculty and curriculum===
As of 2019, UST has 2,164 teaching faculty members, the most among private institutions and second in the country. The faculty comprises 1,160 master&#x27;s degree holders (largest among private institutions) and 333 doctoral degree holders.

The academic year is divided into two terms. The academic performance is graded through the use of the 5-point numerical grading system: 1.00 as excellent, 3.00 as passed, and 5.00 as failed. All bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the university include theology courses in their curricula.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, classes at the university were delivered through the &quot;enhanced virtual mode&quot; for school years 2020–2021 and 2021–2022.

The Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) program offered by the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery is a four-year post-graduate degree that consists of three years of academic instruction in the medical school and one year of clinical clerkship in the UST Hospital. The faculty implements a blended integrated approach, adopting problem-based learning (PBL) as a teaching model in appropriate teaching-learning scenarios, and recently, outcome-based education (OBE), a curriculum that emphasizes the achievement of expected learning outcomes.

The Faculty of Civil Law offers a four-year course, which leads to Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree. The curriculum mirrors the current model curriculum of the Legal Education Board. Master of Laws (LL.M.) and Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) are offered at the Graduate School of Law.

In 2002, the university embarked on e-learning by offering web-enhanced courses through Blackboard called e-LEAP (e-Learning Access Program). In 2023, the UST System shifted to Canvas as its learning management system.

===Research===

UST is a comprehensive research university. It is a member of the Philippine Higher Education Research Network (PHERNET) and Higher Education Regional Research Centers (HERRC). The university spent ₱91 million and ₱116 million in research in 2017 and 2018 respectively.

College of Science professors Nicanor Austriaco and Bernhard Egwolf are members of the OCTA Research team that is associated with forecasts and analyses of the country&#x27;s COVID-19 situation. They also developed an epidemiological model, UST CoV-2 Model, which released COVID-19 cases and death projections in Metro Manila. In the early part of the pandemic, the study recommended the need to increase the daily testing capacity that would potentially control the outbreak. In 2023, Austriaco&#x27;s 2021 project to develop a yeast-based oral vaccine against COVID-19 was funded by the DOST. A study group from the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery proposed a strategy to the government entitled &quot;War Plan Mayon&quot;, to combat the pandemic through herd immunity. Faculty of Engineering professor Anthony James Bautista invented the LISA robot (Logistic Indoor Service), a telepresence and service assistant robot that delivers medicine and allows medical workers to manage isolated patients in the UST Hospital.

UST, primarily through the College of Science, is setting up a research and training facility building for the UST Laboratories for Vaccine Science, Molecular Biology, and Biotechnology, or the UST VaxLab. The center has been developing inexpensive oral yeast vaccines against COVID-19 and African Swine Fever (ASF) since 2021.

The university and the Philippine Department of Science and Technology (DOST) launched the DOST–TOMASInno Center, a technology business incubator (TBI), in 2019. The center was made possible through a research grant from the DOST.

==Student life==

The university marks events with a variety of ceremonies largely influenced by the Hispano-Filipino Dominican Catholic culture and Philippine culture. This includes the &quot;Misa de Apertura&quot; and &quot;Discurso de Apertura&quot;, the Mass and lecture opening the academic year. As one of the oldest traditions in the university, the &quot;Discurso&quot; began in 1866. The Thomasian Welcome Walk where freshmen pass under the Arch of the Centuries at the start of their education at the university. Part of the welcome events are the in-person orientation called &quot;Roarientation&quot; for higher education freshmen and &quot;Alab&quot; (flame) for basic education freshmen. The UST &quot;Paskuhan&quot;, a series of monthlong campus events, celebrate the significance and value of Christmas. It features reenactments of the Christmas story, a campus-wide banquet, live concerts, and light and pyrotechnic displays.

Just before the solemn investiture ceremonies or graduation, the academic year ends with the campus-wide Baccalaureate Mass, the Ceremony of the Light, and send-off rites that are often held at the grandstand. At the end of the Ceremony of the Light, graduating students turn around to face the cross on top of the UST Main Building to sing the UST Hymn. This gesture of turning around is carried on by students and alumni who watch the UAAP games in other venues. Instead of facing the competing team during the singing of the school hymn, Thomasians in the audience turn around to face the university flag that is waved by the UST Yellow Jackets pep squad at the bleachers. The main event of the closing ceremonies is the graduating students&#x27; recessional parade through the Arch of the Centuries, which signifies the culmination of their Thomasian life.

Despite the COVID-19 situation in the country, most of the traditional activities such as the &quot;Misa de Apertura&quot; and &quot;Discurso de Apertura&quot;, the Thomasian Welcome Walk, &quot;Paskuhan&quot;, and closing ceremonies continued virtually. The Welcome Walk, ROARientation, and send-off rites, in particular, were streamed live in a Minecraft server. In 2022, the university returned to holding these traditional festivities in person. The closing ceremonies for the classes of 2020 to 2022 were held in July, while the Welcome Walk for the classes of 2026 and homecoming rites for the classes of 2024 and 2025 resumed in August.

As is customary in many Catholic institutions, activities and traffic within the campus stop at 12:00 and 18:00 PST (GMT+8) for the Angelus and at 15:00 PST for the 3 o&#x27;clock Prayer to the Divine Mercy daily.

The tiger statue in Plaza Mayor, which was installed in 2022, gained media attention when it transformed into a wishing well as students filled its open mouth with coins. The statue was barricaded the following day.

A sports competition among the university colleges is the annual Thomasian Goodwill Games, which was inaugurated in the school year 2002–2003. Sporting events include basketball, volleyball, and football.

===Student organizations===
The university hosts hundreds of student organizations which include a wide range of disciplines: religious, cultural, performing, media, socio-civic, and student service.

The UST Singers is a mixed choral ensemble that has won Choir of the World twice and Choir of the World Champion of Champions in the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod. Founded in 1927, the UST Symphony Orchestra is composed of faculty and students that performs regularly as a resident company at the Cultural Center of the Philippines. The UST Salinggawi Dance Troupe, both the cheer and the dance subteams, have won local and international competitions.

In the 1960s, the first LGBT organization, Tigresa Royal, was established but was never recognized by the university. In 2013, HUE, a new LGBT organization was established. Like Tigresa Royal, the university also denied HUE&#x27;s recognition as a university organization. In 2015, the university ordered numerous organizations to take down all rainbow-themed profile pics of its members in social media after the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States. The order was defied by numerous students of the university, marking the beginning of the UST Rainbow Protest. In July 2016, various student organizations supported the filing of the SOGIE Equality Bill. In March 2018, during the passage of the bill, numerous UST student organizations, including UST Hiraya, a feminist organization, backed the bill&#x27;s passage.

===Literature and media===
&quot;The Varsitarian&quot; is the student publication of the university. Established in January 1928 by students from the UST Literary Club led by Jose Villa Panganiban, it is the oldest Catholic newspaper in the Philippines. It is published fortnightly. The lampoon issue is called &quot;The Vuisitarian&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;buwisit&quot;, a Tagalog expression used for unlucky events, and Varsitarian. The publication hosts the annual Inkblots, a national campus journalism fellowship that gathers student journalists, journalism and communication enthusiasts, and media professionals. The UST Center for Creative Writing and Literary Studies hosts the National Writers&#x27; Workshop annually. The fellows are graduate students and professionals that are selected based on the merits of their submitted works. &quot;The Academia&quot; is the international bulletin of the university.

The Tiger Media Network, the university&#x27;s broadcasting arm, produces content through Tiger TV and Tiger Radio with the use of IPTV and the internet. DZST (860 kHz) was an AM radio station owned by the university from 1950 to 1963. The frequency eventually became the DZRV-AM or &quot;Radyo Veritas&quot;. In 2013, in partnership with Radio Veritas, the university launched the Blessed Pope John Paul II UST–Radio Veritas electronic community board located at the corner of España Boulevard and Lacson Avenue.

The USTv Students&#x27; Choice Awards was an annual award event that recognized TV programs and personalities that promoted Filipino Christian values.

===Greek life===
The Faculty of Civil Law and Faculty of Medicine and Surgery had several Greek organizations on campus. But in 2018, following the death of civil law student Horacio Castillo III, the UST Office of Student Affairs suspended the recognition of all fraternities and sororities. Tau Mu Sigma Phi, founded in 1946, is the oldest among the 10 Greek groups in the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery.

==Athletics==

In 1920, UST and other catholic universities and colleges in Manila organized a sports league called &quot;Liga Catolica&quot;. Four years later, members of the &quot;Liga Catolica&quot; organized themselves to form the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). UST won its first basketball championship and only NCAA championship in 1930. Two years later, the university seceded from the NCAA and formed the Big 3 League with the University of the Philippines and National University. The Big 3 League and Far Eastern University eventually formed the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) in 1938.

The varsity sports teams, originally called the Glowing Goldies, have since been renamed as the Growling Tigers beginning the 1992–1993 UAAP season. The women&#x27;s teams are called the Tigresses, while the juniors&#x27; (high school) teams are the Tiger Cubs.

UST has the most general championship titles among the eight member schools. As of 2024, UST has won the seniors&#x27; division 47 times in the 76 seasons that the title has been awarded, including the record high 14-year run. The juniors&#x27; team yielded 23 titles out of 28 seasons. The university is one of the only four universities that participate in all of the UAAP events. UST has the most championships in baseball, beach volleyball, judo, swimming, taekwondo (kyorugi and poomsae), tennis, and table tennis, or seven out of the 16 sports in the UAAP. UST men&#x27;s senior teams are the only teams that have won gold in all sports disciplines.

UST has won the men&#x27;s basketball title 18 times in the UAAP since 1938 and one in the NCAA, bringing the total to 19. In 2006, the Tigers captured the basketball championship defeating the Ateneo Blue Eagles in two of the three games held. With the championship, the UST tied with the UE Red Warriors with 18 UAAP men&#x27;s basketball titles, behind the league-leading FEU Tamaraws with 20. In 2012, the Tigers, led by Jeric Fortuna and Carmelo Afuang, finished second at the end of eliminations with a 10–4 record but were defeated by the Ateneo Blue Eagles in the finals. In 2013, the fourth seed Tigers defeated the top seed National Bulldogs in the semi-finals. The team, led by Jeric Teng and Karim Abdul, won the first game of the finals, but the DLSU Green Archers went on to win the title. In 2015, the Tigers finished the elimination round as the no. 1 seed with an 11–3 record. UST, led by mythical five members Kevin Ferrer and Ed Daquioag, lost in three games to FEU Tamaraws in the finals. In 2019, the Tigers entered the stepladder semifinals with an 8–6 card. It defeated the FEU Tamaraws in a one-game playoff for the third seed. The Tigers, led by Renzo Subido and Soulemane Chabi Yo, defeated the Kobe Paras-led UP Fighting Maroons in two games to face the Ateneo Blue Eagles in the finals. The Eagles won the series in two games. Chabi Yo and Mark Nonoy were recognized as the season&#x27;s Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year respectively.

The Golden Tigresses, the women&#x27;s volleyball team, rank second in the UAAP with 16 championship titles. Former players include national team members Mary Jean Balse, Aiza Maizo, Maika Angela Ortiz, Aleona Denise Santiago, Cherry Ann Rondina, and Ejiya Laure. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s beach volleyball teams have the most championship titles in the same league.

The Tiger Jins have the most number of championships across all divisions in the UAAP.

The Salinggawi Dance Troupe and the UST Yellow Jackets won eight UAAP Cheerdance Competition titles, from 1994 to 1996, and from 2002 to 2006.

Thomasians cheer the &quot;Go USTè!&quot; chant in supporting the Thomasian athletes on the playing field. UST Yellow Jackets founder Michael Ismael Flores created the iconic chant in 1990, getting inspiration from Vanilla Ice&#x27;s Ninja Rap.

The university sports facilities include a football field, a swimming pool, a tennis court, a sand court, and at least 10 basketball courts. The Quadricentennial Pavilion houses a 5,792-seat arena, a fitness center, a two-lane overall track, and training halls for dance, badminton, fencing, judo, and table tennis.

<text>Ursaab (lit. &quot;Proto-Saab&quot;), also known as 92001 and X9248, was the first of four prototype cars made by Saab AB, which at that time was solely an aeroplane manufacturer, leading to production of the first Saab car, the Saab 92 in 1949. The car is now in the Saab Car Museum in Trollhättan. The name &quot;Ursaab&quot; means &quot;original Saab&quot;.

The model was developed by a 16-person team led by engineer Gunnar Ljungström and designer Sixten Sason.

==Design==
An automobile design project was started in 1945 by Saab AB, a manufacturer of warplanes, with the internal name X9248. The design project became formally known as Project 92; the 92 being next in production sequence after the Saab 91, a single engine trainer aircraft. The aim was to design a car that would compete with small German cars like Opel Kadett, VW Beetle, DKW and Adler. The target consumer price was 3200 SEK. Bror Bjurströmer, who was then head of the design department, developed a 1:25 scale sketch and the overall design specifications, which included the following: a wheelbase of and total length of ; employment of a monocoque design; 50% less drag than other cars; 800 kilogram maximum weight; power from a transverse-mounted two-stroke engine; and front-wheel drive. The choice of rear-hinged doors was made by Gunnar Ljungström (head of the development team) as he wanted to lessen the risk of damaging doors whilst driving out of a garage. The company made four prototypes, 92001 through to 92004, before designing the production model, the Saab 92, in 1949.

==Development==

Development was started in Linköping by a 16-person team led by engineer Gunnar Ljungström and designer Sixten Sason. The immediately preceding Saab production code was for an aeroplane - the Saab 91 Safir. It was for this reason that the first car project was called the Saab 92. Normally the development would have been handled by the testing workshop, but it was busy with the Saab 91 Safir and the Saab 90 Scandia. Thus the tool workshop, which had a lighter workload at that juncture, was given the assignment.

The engineers responsible for making the prototype had no prior experience in making cars, and out of the 16 engineers only two had a driving licence. They needed information about the car manufacturing process, but had to simultaneously keep the project secret. A few visits were made to &quot;Nyköpings Automobilfabrik&quot; (later ANA), but as the extent of their work involved the simple installation of bodies on imported ladder frame chassis, the engineers were not able to gather as much information as they had hoped. Also, since all available literature only described how cars were made before the war, they realised that much of the manufacturing process would have to be learned on their own. Close to SAAB&#x27;s factory a junkyard provided the engineers with both parts and inspiration. They also purchased a number of cars to study, including a DKW, a Hanomag, an Opel Kadett and a Volkswagen.

Structural integrity concerns led to other design decisions. The team tasked with that portion of the project was used to building aircraft where every opening was covered with a load-bearing hatch. Since this was not viable on an automobile, it was decided that the body structure should be strengthened through the use of a rear window that was as small as possible and which used a split-window design, and omission of a rear bootlid.

Because the car had to have a very low drag coefficient,0.3, which even today is considered very impressive, aerodynamic tests were part of the early evaluations. Thus, the body was of novel design and, with safety in mind, it provided damage-resistance in the event of an accident. Winter driving capability was enhanced via front-wheel-drive and wide wheel arches which allowed for snow accumulation without obstruction of the wheels.

==Construction==
Using some carpenters from Motala, a full size mock-up in alder wood was built in the spring of 1946. The model was coloured black using shoe polish. Some extra workers were recruited from &quot;Thorells Kylarfabrik&quot; in Linköping for building the steel body. Hand-shaping the 1.2 mm thick steel sheets proved to be difficult work. By summer 1946 the first prototype body was ready, hand beaten on a wooden jig. Shaping of the metal was done in Saab&#x27;s secret factory 30 metres below ground.

The colour was a problem - the Managing Director wanted it painted black, but the vice MD wanted it blue. But the workshop had already purchased black paint, making it a moot point. The SAAB paint workshop did not have the capacity to handle the paint job so the builders contacted &quot;Aktiebolaget Svenska Järnvägsverkstäderna&quot; (ASJ), the Swedish railroad works in Arlöv. This firm was experienced in painting railway cars and buses. Having been told that their assistance was needed in painting a car, the company was initially reluctant to help since it was thought that the vehicle was a management car such as a DeSoto or something that would take a lot of time. However, when it was learned that the vehicle was a prototype of a new car, ASJ quickly took the job.

The prototype had a borrowed 13 kW (18 hp) two-cylinder two-stroke engine, which was placed transversely in the front of the vehicle. The first engine and gearbox came from a DKW vehicle, but they were later replaced with an engine and gearbox designed by Gunnar Ljungström. The prototype engine blocks were made by Albinmotor. The head of the firm, Albin Larsson, was hesitant to take work since the cooling pipes in the engine block were considered to be complicated. After test driving the prototype, however, Larsson changed his mind.

Ursaab was driven over , typically in utter secrecy, and usually on narrow and muddy forest roads and in early mornings or late nights. Today it is in the Saab museum in Trollhättan, with a cleaned grille and more roadworthy headlights. The name &quot;Ursaab&quot; means &quot;original Saab&quot;.

The Ursaab design was improved by Sixten Sason in 1947, resulting in another prototype: the 92002. The most remarkable difference between 92001 and 92002 is the hood (bonnet). The earlier hood design and the use of a hood mechanism from an Opel Kadett made removal of the engine difficult, as one would have to turn it 90 degrees and bring out the drive package with the gearbox first. Inspired by American cars that had cascading front-ends, the redesigned hood allowed for improved access to the engine bay. After an additional four prototypes the design was ready for production as the Saab 92. Ursaab was first shown to the press on June 10, 1947 at Saab AB&#x27;s headquarters.

<text>The L 14th Street–Canarsie Local is a rapid transit service in the B Division of the New York City Subway. Its route emblem, or &quot;bullet&quot;, is colored since it serves the BMT Canarsie Line.

The L operates 24 hours a day between Eighth Avenue in Chelsea, Manhattan, and Rockaway Parkway in Canarsie, Brooklyn, making all stops along the full route. It also briefly enters Queens at Halsey Street, serving the neighborhood of Ridgewood. It is the first New York City Subway service to be automated using communications-based train control.

The L commenced its current route and service pattern upon completion of the Canarsie Line in 1928. Express trains formerly ran along the L&#x27;s trackage in central Brooklyn, running along the BMT Fulton Street Line in eastern Brooklyn, but were discontinued in 1956. Since then, the L has been entirely local.

The L was originally the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation&#x27;s 16 service. The 16 became the LL in 1967 and then the L in 1985. In the early 2000s, the L saw a dramatic increase in ridership since many neighborhoods along the route have experienced gentrification. From April 2019 to April 2020, late-night and weekend L service between Manhattan and Brooklyn was temporarily reduced as part of the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown, which sought to repair damage to the 14th Street Tunnel incurred by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

== History ==

===Early history===
==== 1924–1967 ====
The L was originally given the LL designation when letters were assigned to the BMT division. From 1928 to 1967, the same service was assigned the BMT number 16.

In 1924, part of the eventual 14th Street–Canarsie Line opened, called the &quot;14th Street–Eastern District Line&quot; (commonly the &quot;14th Street–Eastern Line&quot;), and was given the number 16. This was extended east, and in 1928 it was joined to the existing BMT Canarsie Line east of Broadway Junction. Since that time, the 14th Street–Canarsie Line service has operated as it is today, except for an extension from Sixth Avenue to Eighth Avenue, which opened on May 30, 1931, to connect to the new Eighth Avenue Subway. The Eighth Avenue Terminal was originally built in IND style and has been restored to BMT style like Fulton Street and Broad Street. During rush hours, express service ran nonstop between Lorimer Street and Myrtle–Wyckoff Avenues. (Locals usually ran from Eighth Avenue to Myrtle–Wyckoff Avenues or Atlantic Avenue at these times.)

Before the 14th Street–Eastern and Canarsie Lines were connected, the Canarsie part of the line already had a number, 14, running from Lower Manhattan via the Broadway Elevated and called the &quot;Canarsie Line&quot;. When the 14th Street–Eastern Line was connected in 1928, this was renamed the &quot;Broadway (Brooklyn) Line&quot;, but continued to operate to Rockaway Parkway.

Starting on September 23, 1936, express trains ran to Lefferts Boulevard via the connection with the Fulton Street Elevated at Atlantic Avenue. This connection was severed on April 30, 1956, then the service ran to Rockaway Parkway again, but was discontinued on August 23. The R27 to R38&#x27;s roll signs had both L and LL for express and local service, even though the express never ran thereafter.

==== 1967–1985 ====
On November 26, 1967, with the opening of the Chrystie Street Connection, the BMT Eastern Division lines were given letters. The 14 to Canarsie was given the label (though the 14 main line was designated , continuing east from Broadway Junction towards Jamaica). On the other hand, the 16 became the LL. Canarsie service to Lower Manhattan was discontinued in 1968. When double letters were dropped on May 5, 1985, the LL became the L, and it still has that designation.

=== Skip-stop service proposal ===

In January 1991, skip-stop service was proposed to speed service during the height of rush hours in the peak direction which would have reduced the running time from 41 minutes to 37 minutes. Under this plan, the K designation, which was previously used as the Broadway Brooklyn Local from 1967 to 1976, and as the Eighth Avenue Local from 1985 to 1988, would be repurposed and would appear in a gray bullet similar to the color the L uses. Both services would have common stops at Rockaway Parkway, Broadway Junction (then called Eastern Parkway), Myrtle Avenue, Lorimer Street, First Avenue, Union Square, Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue. L trains would stop at East 105th Street, Livonia Avenue, Atlantic Avenue, Wilson Avenue, DeKalb Avenue, Morgan Avenue, Grand Street, and Bedford Avenue; K trains would stop at New Lots Avenue, Sutter Avenue, Bushwick Avenue–Aberdeen Street, Halsey Street, Jefferson Street, Montrose Avenue, Graham Avenue and Third Avenue. This change was proposed as a service improvement alongside other changes that would have either reduced or eliminated service to balance the MTA&#x27;s operational budget and would have been implemented in October 1991, pending approval from the MTA board.

===Modernization and rehabilitation===
==== Ridership and CBTC ====
Ridership on the L has increased dramatically since 2000 since many neighborhoods along the route have experienced gentrification. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority&#x27;s $443 million fleets of subway cars on the L was introduced in 2002, but by 2006 was already too small to handle growing ridership. The Transit Authority had projected that 212 Kawasaki-made R143 subway cars would be enough to accommodate ridership demands for years to come, but ridership has risen higher than expected. Therefore, sixty-four new R160A cars manufactured by Alstom were equipped with CBTC so they could run on the L.

The BMT Canarsie Line tracks underwent an extensive retrofit over to CBTC, a system that controls the trains via a computer onboard, as opposed manually operated by a human operator. This was completed in early 2009. While the retrofit has resulted in nearly two years of service changes and station closings, this system will eventually allow trains to run closer together and enables in-station &quot;countdown clock&quot; displays to note the exact time until the next train arrives. The line also used OPTO (one person train operation) beginning in June 2005, but a combination of public outcry regarding perceived safety issues, which increased after the July 2005 London tube bombings, heavy lobbying by the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU), as well as an arbitration ruling that MTA had breached its contract with TWU caused the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to end OPTO the following September. However, the MTA&#x27;s successful implementation of countdown clocks on the L was the first in the system.

On April 27, 2003, midday L service was reduced to run every 8 minutes instead of every 6 minutes.

==== 14th Street Tunnel shutdown ====
Starting April 27, 2019, L service was limited between Third Avenue and Bedford Avenue on late nights and weekends to allow for repairs on the Canarsie Line tunnels under the East River, which were badly damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Trains in both directions operated on one tube between Third and Bedford Avenues while late night and weekend work was done on the other tube. The original plan was for a full 15-month closure with both tubes closed simultaneously west of Bedford Avenue, but the plans were revised in January 2019. On April 26, 2020, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced the completion of the project, months ahead of schedule.

==Route==
===Service pattern===
The L uses the following lines with the same service pattern at all times.
=== Stations ===
The L runs on the BMT Canarsie Line in its entirety.

<text>Joseph James Kelley (December 9, 1871 – August 14, 1943) was an American left fielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) who starred in the outfield of the Baltimore Orioles teams of the 1890s. Making up the nucleus of the Orioles along with John McGraw, Willie Keeler, and Hughie Jennings, Kelley received the nickname &quot;Kingpin of the Orioles&quot;.

In his MLB career, Kelley played in the National League (NL) for the Boston Beaneaters (1891), Pittsburgh Pirates (1892), Baltimore Orioles (1892–1898), and Brooklyn Superbas (1899–1901), before he jumped to the upstart American League to play for the Baltimore Orioles (1902). He returned to the NL with Cincinnati Reds (1902–1906) and Boston Doves (1908). Kelley served as player-manager of the Reds (1902–1905) and Doves (1908). After extending his career in the minor leagues, he coached the Brooklyn Robins (1926), and scouted for the New York Yankees (1915–1916).

Kelley was regarded as an excellent batter, a good base runner, and a great leader. Over his seventeen-season MLB career, Kelley had a .317 batting average, and batted over .300 in eleven consecutive seasons. Kelley stole a career-high 87 bases in the 1896 season, which led MLB. He finished in the league&#x27;s top ten in categories such as batting average, home runs, runs batted in (RBI), and stolen bases numerous times. He served as team captain of the Orioles and the Superbas. In recognition of his career achievements, Kelley was elected a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1971.

==Early life==
Joseph James Kelley was born on December 9, 1871, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Patrick Kelly and Ann Kelly (née Carney) in Cambridge, Massachusetts on December 9, 1871. Kelley&#x27;s parents emigrated to the United States from Ireland, and he had five siblings. According to the 1880 United States Census, Patrick worked as a marble cutter.

As a child, Kelley was educated at a parochial grammar school and St. Thomas Aquinas College in Cambridge, where he starred for the school&#x27;s baseball team as a pitcher. He worked for a local piano manufacturer and the John P. Lowell Arms Company. He practiced with the Harvard Crimson, the college baseball team of Harvard University, and played semi-professional baseball for the Lowell Arms Company.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
Kelley made his professional debut with the Lowell Indians of the New England League (NEL) in 1891, at age 19. During games he did not pitch, Lowell&#x27;s manager put him in the lineup as an infielder. Kelley had a 10–3 win–loss record and a NEL-leading .323 batting average with Lowell.

===Boston Beaneaters (1891)===
Lowell folded in July. Three days later, Kelley signed with the Boston Beaneaters of the National League (NL). Kelley made his major league debut in August 1891 with the Beaneaters. After batting .244 in twelve games played, the Beaneaters released Kelley after the season. Kelley began the 1892 season with the Omaha Omahogs of the Class–A Western League, turning down a $1,200 salary ($ in current dollar terms) from the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League. With Omaha, Kelley batted .316 with 19 stolen bases in 58 games.

===Pittsburgh Pirates (1892)===
The Pittsburgh Pirates of the NL purchased Kelley&#x27;s contract from Omaha for $500 ($ in current dollar terms) on July 2, 1892.

===Baltimore Orioles (NL) (1892–1898)===
Ned Hanlon, new manager of the Baltimore Orioles, traded George Van Haltren to the Pirates for Kelley and $2,000 ($ in current dollar terms) in September 1892. Hanlon had succeeded Van Haltren as Orioles&#x27; manager during the season; remaining with the Orioles as a player, Van Haltren openly criticized Hanlon. Hanlon mentioned that he &quot;had [his] eye on Kelley for a long time.&quot;
Hanlon taught Kelley how to play center field. During the 1893 season, Kelley batted .305, with 120 runs scored, and stole 33 bases. He finished ninth in the NL with a .476 slugging percentage (SLG), and tied Eddie Burke for ninth in home runs with 9. The Orioles won the NL pennant in 1894, 1895, and 1896. Kelley moved to left field in 1894 with the acquisition of Steve Brodie, who played center. That year, he batted .393 with 111 runs batted in (RBI), 199 hits, and 165 runs scored, tying teammate Willie Keeler for second in runs and finishing sixth in batting average and eighth in hits. Combined with 107 walks, which were tied for second most in the NL with Cupid Childs and behind only Billy Hamilton, Kelley posted a .502 on-base percentage (OBP), finishing second in the NL to Hamilton, and hit 48 doubles, good for second in the NL, behind only Hugh Duffy. His .602 SLG was the fourth best in the NL.

These Orioles teams, led by John McGraw, were known to break the rules in order to win, including tampering with their bats and the playing field. Kelley hid baseballs in the outfield, using the closest hidden ball instead of finding the ball batted into the outfield. Kelley hit ten home runs in 1895, a then-franchise record, tying him for fifth in the NL with five other players. He also tied Brodie for second with 134 RBI, finished fourth with 54 stolen bases, fifth with a .546 SLG, and sixth with a .456 OBP. In 1896, Kelley finished seventh in the NL in batting average (.364), fourth in runs scored (148), fourth in SLG (.543), fifth in OBP (.469), ninth in hits (189), and tied Gene DeMontreville for eighth in home runs (8).

In 1897, Kelley agreed to serve as the coach of the Georgetown Hoyas, the college baseball team of Georgetown University. That year, he finished fifth in the NL in batting average (.362) and RBI (118), seventh in OBP (.447), and eighth in SLG (.489).

By 1898, Kelley earned an annual salary of $2,500 ($ in current dollar terms), plus a $200 ($ in current dollar terms) bonus for serving as team captain. He finished third in the league with 110 RBI and ninth with a .438 SLG. Due to insolvency, the Brooklyn Superbas purchased the Orioles after the 1898 season and transferred Kelley, Hanlon, Keeler, Joe McGinnity, and Hughie Jennings to Brooklyn. Wanting an opportunity to manage, and to remain near Baltimore, Kelley requested a transfer to the Washington Senators, but Washington did not have enough talent to send to Brooklyn to make a trade.

===Brooklyn Superbas (1899–1901)===
With McGraw remaining in Baltimore, Hanlon named Kelley team captain. The Superbas won the NL pennant in 1899 and 1900, as Kelley finished tenth in RBI (93), OBP (.410), and tied several players for tenth in home runs (6) in 1899 and led the team with a .319 batting average in 1900, while finishing fourth in the league in SLG (.485), tying Hickman for seventh in RBI (91), and tying Jimmy Collins and Buck Freeman for tenth in home runs (6).

Kelley moved back to the infield, becoming the regular first baseman in 1901.

===Baltimore Orioles (AL) (1902)===
After the 1901 season, Kelley denied reports that he would jump from the Superbas to the Detroit Tigers of the American League (AL), the former Western League which had decided to compete with the NL by creating franchises in east coast cities that housed NL franchises. However, the opportunity to return to Baltimore proved irresistible to Kelley, and after the AL&#x27;s successful 1901 season, he jumped from the Superbas to the Baltimore Orioles AL. Kelley&#x27;s father-in-law, John Mahon, was president and principal share holder of the AL&#x27;s Orioles.
Kelley was named Orioles&#x27; captain and received some stock in the team. McGraw, player-manager of the Orioles, resigned from the team to take over as manager of the New York Giants on July 7, 1902. In his absence, Kelley and Wilbert Robinson took over in the interim. Under indefinite suspension by Ban Johnson by July 1902 for fighting with umpires, Kelley entertained the idea of leaving the Orioles with McGraw, who was becoming frustrated with Johnson, and had begun negotiating to join the New York Giants of the NL. With the team in financial straits, Kelley sold his shares of the Orioles to Mahon, who had purchased McGraw&#x27;s shares when he left for New York, becoming principal shareholder of the Orioles. Mahon then sold controlling interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, on July 17. On the day they owned the franchise, they released the best players on the Orioles from their contracts so that they could be signed by National League teams: Kelley and Cy Seymour signed with the Reds, while McGinnity, Roger Bresnahan, Dan McGann, and Jack Cronin signed with the Giants. Johnson, along with Orioles minority owners, took control of the Orioles franchise, which had to forfeit their game that day as they did not have enough players. Kelley stated that the Orioles owed $12,000 ($ in current dollar terms), and that selling his shares was the only way Mahon could pay the team&#x27;s debts.

===Cincinnati Reds (1902–1906)===
The Superbas lodged a complaint against the Reds, claiming that Kelley was still under their control, seeking compensation from the Reds. However, the other NL owners saw the situation as a coup for their league, and compelled Hanlon to drop his complaint. Kelley did not immediately report to Cincinnati, instead traveling to Boston to attempt to convince members of the Boston Americans to join him in the NL. Kelley joined the Reds on July 31.

==Managerial career==
With rumors that Kelley was negotiating to become the Reds&#x27; manager, incumbent manager Bid McPhee resigned, and Kelley succeeded him. Kelley served as manager of the Reds from 1902 until 1905. In 1903, Kelley finished ninth in the NL in OBP (.402). He was dismissed as manager after the 1905 season, and replaced by Hanlon. He remained as a Reds player for the 1906 season. He batted .228 during the 1906 season, and the Reds released him.

Kelley signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Class–AA International League (IL) in 1907, receiving a $5,000 salary ($ in current dollar terms), the highest for a minor league player to date. Kelley batted .322 for the Maple Leafs as a part-time player, spending time in left field and first base. The Maple Leafs won the IL pennant that season.

===Boston Doves (1908)===
With Fred Tenney set to leave the Boston Doves of the NL for the Giants, the Doves claimed Kelley from the Maple Leafs, signing Kelley to a two-year contract with an annual salary of $5,500 ($ in current dollar terms). Kelley announced that he would play left field. Kelley feuded with Doves&#x27; owner George Dovey, as Dovey wanted George Browne fined for &quot;indifferent play&quot;, which Kelley refused to do. Dovey fired Kelley in December 1908. Kelley threatened legal action against Dovey, stating in the press that Dovey was releasing him to cut salary. Kelley and Dovey settled their case, freeing Kelley from the second year of his Doves contract.

==Later career==
Maple Leafs president James McCafferey secured Kelley&#x27;s return to the club in 1909. He played with the Maple Leafs through 1910, managing the Maple Leafs from 1912 to 1914, winning a second pennant in 1912.

After the 1914 season, the Maple Leafs released Kelley. The New York Yankees considered hiring Kelley as their manager after the 1914 season. Kelley scouted for the Yankees in 1915 and 1916. Former teammate Wilbert Robinson, then manager of the Brooklyn Robins, hired Kelley and McGinnity to join his coaching staff for the 1926 MLB season. Kelley and McGinnity were not retained after the season.

==Legacy==
As a player, Kelley had 11 consecutive .300-plus seasons during his MLB career. Kelley was also known as a good base runner and stole a career-high 87 bases in 1896. He retired with a career .317 batting, .402 OBP, 65 home runs, 1,421 runs, 1,194 RBI and 443 stolen bases in 1,853 career games. His 194 triples ranks him ninth all-time. Kelley tied Fred Carroll&#x27;s MLB record with nine hits in a doubleheader, which he presently shares with eight other players.

Additionally, he was known as a great leader. He compiled a 338–321 win–loss record as an MLB manager.

Kelley was considered by the Veterans Committee for induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1964, but was not selected. He was voted into the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1971.

==Personal life==
Kelley married Margaret Mahon on October 26, 1897. Keeler served as Kelley&#x27;s best man, and McGraw and Jennings served as groomsmen. Kelley is buried at New Cathedral Cemetery.

<text>Resistin also known as adipose tissue-specific secretory factor (ADSF) or C/EBP-epsilon-regulated myeloid-specific secreted cysteine-rich protein (XCP1) is a cysteine-rich peptide hormone derived from adipose tissue that in humans is encoded by the &quot;RETN&quot; gene.

In primates, pigs, and dogs, resistin is secreted by immune and epithelial cells, while, in rodents, it is secreted by adipose tissue. The length of the resistin pre-peptide in human is 108 amino acid residues and in the mouse and rat it is 114 aa; the molecular weight is ~12.5 kDa. Resistin is an adipose-derived hormone (similar to a cytokine) whose physiologic role has been the subject of much controversy regarding its involvement with obesity and type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

== Discovery ==
Resistin was discovered in 2001 by the group of Dr Mitchell A. Lazar from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. It was called &quot;resistin&quot; because of the observed insulin resistance in mice injected with resistin. Resistin was found to be produced and released from adipose tissue to serve endocrine functions likely involved in insulin resistance. 

This idea primarily stems from studies demonstrating that serum resistin levels increase with obesity in several model systems (humans, rats, and mice). Since these observations, further research has linked resistin to other physiological systems such as inflammation and energy homeostasis.

This article discusses the current research proposing to link resistin to inflammation and energy homeostasis, including its alleged role in insulin resistance in obese subjects, a subject reviewed by Vidal-Puig and O&#x27;Rahilly in 2001, and by M.A. Lazar in 2007.

== Inflammation ==

Inflammation is the first innate immune response to infection or irritation resulting from leukocyte (neutrophils, mast cells, etc.) accumulation and their secretion of inflammatory, biogenic chemicals such as histamine, prostaglandin, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. As cited, it has recently been discovered that resistin also participates in the inflammatory response.

In further support of its inflammatory profile, resistin has been shown to increase transcriptional events, leading to an increased expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines including (but not limited to) interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in an NF-κB-mediated (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells-mediated) fashion. It has also been demonstrated that resistin upregulates intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) vascular cell-adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), all of which are occupied in chemotactic pathways involved in leukocyte recruitment to sites of infection. Resistin itself can be upregulated by interleukins and also by microbial antigens such as lipopolysaccharide, which are recognized by leukocytes. Taken together, because resistin is reputed to contribute to insulin resistance, results such as those mentioned suggest that resistin may be a link in the well-known association between inflammation and insulin resistance.

In accordance, it is expected that, if resistin does serve as a link between obesity and T2DM while at the same time contributing to the inflammatory response, then proportional increases in chronic inflammation in association with obesity and insulin resistance should be observed. Recent data has shown that this is possible by demonstrating positive correlations between obesity, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation, which is believed to be directed in part by resistin signaling. This idea has recently been challenged by a study showing that increased levels of resistin in people with chronic kidney disease are associated with lowered renal function and inflammation, but not with insulin resistance. Notwithstanding, regarding resistin and the inflammatory response, it can be concluded that resistin does bear features of a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and could act as a key node in inflammatory diseases with or without associated insulin resistance.

This adipokine is associated with markers of inflammation in seminal plasma and the concentrations of seminal resistin correlate positively with those of proinflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), elastase and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). During inflammation, the concentrations of cytokines and ROS increase, and this may have a deleterious effect on the male reproductive function. One study showed that there was a negative correlation between the concentrations of seminal resistin and spermatic motility and vitality. (The seminal concentrations of resistin were significantly higher in cases of leukocyte spermia or if the patients were smokers.)

== Obesity and insulin resistance ==

=== Arguments for ===

Much of what is hypothesized about a resistin role in energy metabolism and T2DM can be derived from studies showing strong correlations between resistin and obesity. The premise being that serum resistin levels increase with increased adiposity. Conversely, serum resistin levels to decline with decreased adiposity following medical treatment. Specifically, central obesity (waistline adipose tissue) is the region of adipose tissue that contributes most to rising levels of serum resistin. This is significant, considering the link between central obesity and insulin resistance, two marked peculiarities of T2DM.

Although resistin levels increase with obesity, it is questioned whether this increase is responsible for the insulin resistance associated with increased adiposity. Several reports have shown a positive correlation between resistin levels and insulin resistance. This is supported by reports of correlation between resistin levels and subjects with T2DM. If resistin contributes to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in T2DM, then designing drugs to promote decreased serum resistin in T2DM subjects may deliver therapeutic benefits.

Resistin can increase levels of circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and accelerates LDL accumulation in arteries, increasing risk of heart disease has an adverse impact on the efficacy of statins, the primary drug used to reduce cholesterol in fighting of cardiovascular disease. In the liver, resistin increases LDL production and degrades LDL receptors, impairing the ability to process LDL. 

=== Arguments against ===
The amount of evidence supporting the resistin link theory between obesity and T2DM is vast. Nevertheless, this theory lacks support from the entire scientific community, as a number of studies present evidence against it. Such studies have found significantly decreased serum concentrations of resistin with increased adiposity, suggesting not only that resistin is downregulated in obese subjects, but also that decreased resistin levels may contribute to the links between obesity and T2DM. Data contradicting the idea that weight loss coincides with decreased serum resistin concentrations have also been presented; such studies instead report that weight loss is associated with marked increases in serum resistin. The idea that resistin links obesity to T2DM is under scrutiny, reports have been made of ubiquitous resistin expression in many tissues, rather than only those characteristic of obesity, such as adipocytes .

Although nearly as many scientists oppose the theory as those who support it , there is sufficient evidence to support the idea that resistin does have some incompletely defined role in energy homeostasis, while also demonstrating properties that help to incite inflammatory responses to sites of infection.

== Structure ==
Crystal structures of resistin reveal an unusual composition of several subunits that are held together by non-covalent interactions that make up its structure. The crystal structure shows a multimeric assembly consisting of hexamer-forming disulfide bonds. Each protein subunit comprises a carboxy-terminal disulfide-rich beta sandwich &quot;head&quot; domain and an amino-terminal alpha-helical &quot;tail&quot; segment. The alpha-helical segments associate to form three-stranded coils, and surface-exposed interchain disulfide linkages mediate the formation of tail-to-tail hexamers. The globular domain from resistin contains five disulfide bonds (Cys35-Cys88, Cys47-Cys87, Cys56-Cys73, Cys58-Cys75, and Cys62-Cys77). This suggests that the disulfide pattern will be conserved.

The interchain disulfide bonds of resistin and resistin-like molecule β (RELMß) are novel in that they are highly solvent when exposed, ranging from 84.6% to 89.5%. An average solvent exposure for all disulfide bonds is 9.9%, and 16.7% for 1,209 interchain disulfide bonds. Therefore, the most highly uncovered disulfide bonds found for intact proteins are resistin&#x27;s disulfides in high-resolution.

A Cys6Ser resistin mutant was substantially more potent at the low concentration and had a greater effect than the wild-type resistin at the high concentration. This result suggests that processing of the intertrimer disulfide bonds may reflect a mandatory step toward activation. Other results also suggest that both the Cys6Ser-mutant and wild-type resistin target mainly the liver.

<text>Solo climbing (or soloing) is a style of climbing in which the climber ascends a climbing route alone and deliberatly without the assistance of a belayer (or &quot;second&quot;), or being part of any rope team. By its very nature, solo climbing presents a higher degree of risk to the climber as they are entirely relient on their own skills and equipment and any problems may require a self-rescue.

Solo climbing is most common in mountaineering and more laterly in the sub-discipline of alpine climbing. The most dangerous form of solo climbing is free solo climbing, which means both climbing alone and without any form of climbing protection, and was dramatically portrayed in the climbing films, &quot;Free Solo&quot; (in rock climbing) and &quot;The Alpinist&quot; (in ice climbing and in alpine climbing).

==With climbing protection==

The following types of solo climbing use some form of climbing protection, which typically involves around a mechanical self-locking device (or progress capture/assisted braking device) that — when used properly with a rope and standard protection — reduces the risk of serious or fatal injury to the climber:

* Rope solo climbing is climbing alone but with a rope to help arrest a fall, or for a self-rescue if required. Instead of having a belayer, the climber uses a self-locking device that will hold the rope in the case of a fall, and leads the route in a traditional climbing manner, placing climbing protection as they ascend. One end of the rope is anchored below the climber and the climber pays-out the rope through the self-locking device as they ascend. Once they reach the top, they need to abseil down and re-ascend the route with an ascender, to remove the protection they placed earlier. 
:In 1992, French climber Catherine Destivelle used a self-locking device to rope-solo the first part of the traditional climbing route &quot;El Matador&quot; , on the Devils Tower in Wyoming (she free soloed the second part), and was captured in the climbing film, &quot;Ballade à Devil&#x27;s Tower&quot;. In 1992, Destivelle used rope solo technique to create &quot;Voie Destivelle&quot; (VI 5.11b A5) on the west face of the Petit Dru, and was captured in the climbing film, &quot;11 Days on the Dru&quot;. In 2016, Pete Whittaker rope-soloed the 35-pitch route &quot;Freerider&quot; in Yosemite in a single day.
*Top rope solo climbing is a form of top roping where a single static fixed rope, anchored to the top of the route, is laid along the length of the climb. The climber then clips-into the fixed rope using at least one progress capture device (PCD) such as a Petzl Micro Traxion or a Camp Lift, that will allow the rope to pay-through as the climber ascends but will grip the rope tightly in the event of a fall.
*Auto belay indoor climbing is usually a form of top roping (there are lead auto-belay devices) where the belayer is replaced by a mechanical device fixed the top (or bottom for lead auto-belay) of the route.

==Without climbing protection==

Free solo climbing (sometimes also just called &quot;soloing&quot;) is where the climber uses no climbing protection (or any form of climbing aids), except for climbing shoes and climbing chalk (for a rock-climber) or ice tools (for an ice-climber), to ascend a climbing route. 

Free soloing is the most dramatic soloing-technique and in 2017 became an Oscar-winning documentary film, &quot;Free Solo&quot; that featured Alex Honnold free soloing the 35-pitch big wall climbing route &quot;Freerider&quot; in Yosemite, the world&#x27;s first-ever free solo of a big wall route in history.

There are a number of sub-classes of free soloing:

* Deep-water soloing (DWS), is a subtype of free solo climbing performed on rock faces that overhang above water where in the case of a fall, the climber lands in the water. Extreme deep-water solo routes have falls of over , and thus a risk of serious injury. Noted DWS climbers include Chris Sharma who created the world&#x27;s first-ever DWS route, &quot;Es Pontàs&quot;, in 2007.
* FreeBASEing, is a subtype of free solo climbing performed on long multi-pitch big wall routes with a BASE jumping parachute as the sole means of protection, where a falling climber opens their parachute to arrest their fall. FreeBASEing was pioneered by Dean Potter who made a freeBASE ascent of &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; (5.12+) on the north face of the Eiger in 2008.
* Highball bouldering, is where the boulder exceeds in height, and therefore any fall, even where bouldering mats are used, presents a risk of serious injury. Where highball bouldering ends and free soloing begins is a source of debate amongst climbers. Notable highball boulders include Nalle Hukkataival&#x27;s &quot;Livin&#x27; Large&quot; in Rocklands, South Africa.
* Free solo ice climbing can also be done in a free-solo format (e.g. without any protection, such as ice screws). Notable free solo ice climbers include Canadian Marc-Andre Leclerc, and Swiss ice climber, Dani Arnold, who has free soloed routes of grade WI7. Related to this is the activity of mixed climbing free soloing (e.g. using ice climbing equipment on routes that are a combination of ice and rock).
* Buildering, is a subtype of free solo climbing where the climber ascends a public building (or mechanical structure with crane climbing), and usually without any protection. Notable building climbers include Alain Robert (who also made world&#x27;s first-ever free solo of an climbing route), who has free soloed major buildings including the Eiffel Tower and the Burj Khalifa.

==In film==
A number of notable films have been made focused on solo (and free solo) climbing (on rock and/or on ice) including: 
* &quot;The Alpinist&quot;, a 2021 documentary film about Canadian alpinist Marc-André Leclerc, with solo, and free solo, of rock, ice, and alpine routes.
*&quot;Free Solo&quot;, a 2018 Netflix documentary film about Alex Honnold&#x27;s free solo climb of &quot;Freerider&quot; on El Capitan.
*&quot;King Lines&quot;, a 2007 documentary film about Chris Sharma, featuring his free solo climb of the DWS route, &quot;Es Pontàs&quot; , in Mallorca.

<text>The Solicitor General of India (SGI) is subordinate to the Attorney General for India. The SGI is the second-highest law officer of the country, assists the Attorney General, and is assisted by Additional Solicitors General of India (Addl. SGIs). The SGI and the Addl. SGIs advise the Union of India and appear on its behalf in terms of the Law Officers (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1987.

Unlike the post of Attorney General for India, which is a Constitutional post under Article 76 of the Indian Constitution, the posts of the Solicitor General and the Additional Solicitor General are neither Constitutional nor statutory. The conditions of service of Law Officers are defined by &quot;The Law Officers (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1987&quot;, made under the powers conferred by the proviso to Article 309 of the Indian Constitution. 

The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) recommends the appointment and officially appoints the Solicitor General. The proposal for appointment of Solicitor General, Additional Solicitor General is generally moved at the level of Joint secretary (or Law Secretary) in the Department of Legal Affairs and after obtaining the approval of the Minister of Law &amp; Justice, the proposal goes to the ACC and then to the president.

Currently, the Solicitor General of India is Tushar Mehta.

==Duties==
The Solicitor General works under the Attorney General of India. The duties of the Solicitor General are laid out in Law Officers (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1987:
*to give advice to the Government of India upon such legal matters, and to perform such other duties of a legal character, as may from time to time, be referred or assigned to him by the Government of India.
*to appear, whenever required, in the Supreme Court or in any High Court on behalf of the Government of India in cases (including suits, writ petitions, appeal and other proceedings) in which the Government of India is concerned as a party or is otherwise interested;
*to represent the Government of India in any reference made by the President to the Supreme Court under Article 143 of the Constitution; and
*to discharge such other functions as are conferred on a Law Officer by or under the Constitution or any other Law for the time being in force.

==Restrictions of private practice==
As law officers representing the Government of India, SGIs are bound by certain restrictions concerning private practice. A law officer is not allowed to:
*hold briefs in any court for any party, except the Government of India or the government of a State or any University, Government School or College, local authority, Public Service Commission, Port Trust, Port Commissioners, Government aided or Government managed hospitals, a Government company, any Corporation owned or controlled by the State, any body or institution in which the Government has a preponderating interest;
*advice any party against the Government of India or a Public Sector Undertaking, or in cases in which he is likely to be called upon to advise, or appear for, the Government of India or a Public Sector Undertaking;
*defend an accused person in a criminal prosecution, without the permission of the Government of India; or
*accept appointment to any office in any company or corporation without the permission of the Government of India;
*advise any Ministry or Department of Government of India or any statutory organisation or any Public Sector Undertaking unless the proposal or a reference in this regard is received through the Ministry of Law and Justice, Department of Legal Affairs.

==Fee and allowances payable==
Fee and allowances payable to the law officers (including Attorney General of India, Solicitor General of India and the Additional Solicitors General) of the Government of India are as under:

In addition to the above fee payable for cases, a retainer fee is paid to the Solicitor General and the Addl. Solicitors General at the rate of Rs. 40,000, and Rs. 30,000 per month, respectively.

== List of incumbent Law Officers ==
The list of incumbent Law Officers (i.e. AGI, SGI, Addl. SGIs) as of 10 September 2024 are as follows:

<text>The Erie Railroad was a railroad that operated in the Northeastern United States, originally connecting Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey, with Lake Erie at Dunkirk, New York. The railroad expanded west to Chicago following its 1865 merger with the former Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, also known as the New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad (NYPANO RR).

The mainline route of the Erie Railroad proved influential in the development and economic growth of the Southern Tier of New York state, including the cities of Binghamton, Elmira, and Hornell. The Erie Railroad repair shops were located in Hornell and was Hornell&#x27;s largest employer. Hornell was also where Erie&#x27;s mainline split into two routes with one proceeding northwest to Buffalo and the other west to Chicago.

On October 17, 1960, Erie Railroad merged with its former rival, Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, to form the Erie Lackawanna Railway. The Hornell repair shops were closed in 1976, when Conrail took over, and repair operations moved to the Lackawanna&#x27;s facility in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Some of the former Erie line between Hornell and Binghamton was damaged in 1972 by Hurricane Agnes, but the damage was quickly repaired and today this line is a key link in the Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Southern Tier mainline. What was left of the Erie Lackawanna became part of Conrail in 1976. In 1983, remnants of the Erie Railroad became part of New Jersey Transit rail operations, including parts of its Main Line, and most of the surviving Erie Railroad routes are now operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway.

== History ==
=== New York and Erie Railroad: 1832–1861 ===
The New York and Erie Rail Road was chartered on April 24, 1832, by New York governor Enos T. Throop to connect the Hudson River at Piermont, north of New York City, west to Lake Erie at Dunkirk. On February 16, 1841, the railroad was authorized to cross into the northeast corner of Pennsylvania on the west side of the Delaware River, a few miles west of Port Jervis, NY, as the east side was already occupied by the Delaware and Hudson Canal to a point several miles west of Lackawaxen, PA. Construction began in 1836 and was opened in sections until reaching the full length to Dunkirk on May 19, 1851. At Dunkirk, steamboats continued across Lake Erie to Detroit, Michigan. The line crossed the Kittatinny Mountains at 870 feet.

When the route was completed in May, 1851, President Millard Fillmore and several members of his cabinet, including Secretary of State Daniel Webster, made a special, two-day excursion run to open the railway. It is reported that Webster viewed the entire run from a rocking chair attached to a flatcar, with a steamer rug and jug of high-quality Medford rum. At stops, he would step off the flatcar and give speeches.

The line was built at wide gauge; this was believed to be a superior technology to standard gauge, providing more stability.

In 1848, the railroad built the Starrucca Viaduct, a stone railroad bridge over Starrucca Creek in Lanesboro, Pennsylvania, which has survived and is still in use today. In fact, current owner Central New York Railroad spent $3.2 million in 2021 centering its single remaining track, re-ballasting and repairing masonry. The viaduct is long, high and wide at the top. It is the oldest stone rail bridge in Pennsylvania still in use.

As stated in the introduction, the shops in Hornell, New York were the largest on the Erie system beginning in the late 1920s, processing about 350 locomotives per year with &quot;classified&quot; (heavy) repairs. However, the first major repair facilities were built in Susquehanna, Pennsylvania in 1848, which were enlarged in 1863 to employ 700 workers. The primary car shops were located in Meadville, Pennsylvania in the western part of the state, employing 3,500 in 1912.

===Erie Railway: 1861–1878===
In August 1859, the company went into receivership due to inability to make payments on the debts incurred for the large costs of building, and, on June 25, 1861, it was reorganized as the Erie Railway. This was the first bankruptcy of a major trunk line in the U.S.

In the Erie War of the 1860s, four well-known financiers struggled for control of the company; Cornelius Vanderbilt versus Daniel Drew, James Fisk and Jay Gould. Gould ultimately triumphed in this struggle, but was forced to relinquish control in 1872–73 due to unfavorable public opinion following his involvement in the 1869 gold-rigging scandal and to his loss of $1 million of Erie Railroad stock to the British con-man Lord Gordon-Gordon. Investors in the railroad were also weary of Gould&#x27;s financial wars with Vanderbilt that caused wild stock price fluctuations and operating losses from rate battles. Upon leaving the Erie he managed to take $4 million, which he claimed was the railroad&#x27;s &quot;debt&quot; to him.

In 1869, the railroad moved its main shop facilities from Dunkirk to Buffalo. Rather than demolishing the shops in Dunkirk, the facility was leased to Horatio G. Brooks, the former chief engineer of the NY&amp;E who was at the controls of the first train into Dunkirk in 1851. Horatio Brooks used the facilities to begin Brooks Locomotive Works, which remained in independent business until 1901 when it was merged with seven other locomotive manufacturing firms to create ALCO. ALCO continued new locomotive production at this facility until 1934, then closed the plant completely in 1962.

The cost of breaking bulk cargo in order to interchange with standard gauge lines led the Erie to introduce a line of cars designed to operate on both broad gauge and standard gauge trucks. Beginning in 1871, the railroad interchanged traffic by means of truck exchange, including through passenger and freight connections to St. Louis, Missouri, using a Nutter car hoist in Urbana, Ohio. Beginning in 1876, the Erie carried out their plans to convert their trackage to standard gauge, since it was deemed that the standard gauge-broad gauge interchange operations could not justify the costs. By 1878, the Erie built a third rail along the entire mainline from Buffalo to Jersey City. The third rail installation and standard-gauge conversion projects were so expensive, that the railroad was forced into bankruptcy.

=== New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad: 1878–1895 ===
The Erie still did not see profits, and was sold in 1878 via bankruptcy reorganization to become the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad. On June 22, 1880, the railroad’s standard-gauge conversion process was completed.

In 1886, it was reported that the Erie and the Philadelphia and Reading Railway shared ferry services between their two Jersey City terminals, the larger being Pavonia Terminal, and Fulton Ferry in Brooklyn, New York for 11 round trips on weekdays and Saturdays, and four round trips on Sunday. In 1889, it opened a new bridge across the Hackensack River improving service to its terminals.

=== Erie Railroad: 1895–1960 ===
By 1893, the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad went into bankruptcy reorganization again, and then the company emerged in 1895 as the Erie Railroad. By that time, the company began to obtain financial support from J. P. Morgan. In 1898, the Erie obtained a subsidiary, the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad (NYS&amp;W), after Morgan purchased the majority of their shares, on the Erie&#x27;s behalf. The control of the NYS&amp;W allowed the Erie to gain access to anthracite coal mines south of Scranton, Pennsylvania, competing with coal operations from the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&amp;W).

George W. Perkins brought Frederick D. Underwood into the Erie Railroad in 1910. During the eastern railroad strike of 1913 Underwood agreed to accept any ruling made by mediators under the Newlands Reclamation Act. One of the demands made by Erie employees was a 20% increase in wages. Erie management had refused a wage increase, but compromised by asking employees to wait until January, 1915 for any advance. Union leaders agreed to make this an issue which Erie management would settle with its own men. However, W.G. Lee, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, asserted that the only way &quot;to deal with the Erie is through J.P. Morgan &amp; Company, or the banks&quot;. Underwood responded from his home in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, stating &quot;I am running the Erie Railroad: not George W. Perkins, nor J.P. Morgan, nor anybody else.&quot;

In the mid-1920s, the Van Sweringen brothers of Cleveland, Ohio, assumed control of the Erie, and they installed a new president for the railroad, John Joseph Bernet. Bernet only served as the Erie&#x27;s president from January 1927 to May 1929, but during that time, he initiated a reorganization and cost-cutting program to improve the company&#x27;s operations and finances. He also arranged for the Erie to replace most of their steam locomotives and rolling stock with newly-built standardized equipment to speed up their freight operations, and it involved the introduction of the Erie&#x27;s fleet of 2-8-4 &quot;Berkshire&quot; locomotives. In the mid-1930s, both Van Sweringen brothers died at an early age, before they could carry out any further plans they had for the Erie and their other railroads.

Despite the ravages of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the Erie managed to continue operations on their own, until they filed for bankruptcy again, on January 18, 1938. That same year, the Erie was involved in the U.S. Supreme Court case, the &quot;Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins&quot;. The Erie doctrine, which governs the application of state common law in federal courts, is still taught in American law schools, as of 2024. By December 1941, the Erie emerged from bankruptcy, following a reorganization process, which involved the purchase of the leased Cleveland and Mahoning Valley Railroad, swapping high rent for lower interest payments, and the purchase of formerly-subsidized and leased lines. In 1940, the NYS&amp;W became disbanded from the Erie&#x27;s control, as part of their own bankruptcy reorganization, and in the process, the Erie was entrusted ownership of their Susquehanna Connecting Railroad. The Erie&#x27;s reorganization was deemed a success, since the railroad managed to pay dividends to their shareholders.
On September 15, 1948, the Cleveland Union Terminal Company allowed the Erie to use the Union Terminal adjacent to Terminal Tower in lieu of its old station. That same year, the Erie purchased a share of the Niagara Junction Railway, along with the New York Central and the Lehigh Valley. On March 17, 1954, the Erie completely dieselized its locomotive roster, when K-1 class 4-6-2 No. 2530 hauled the railroad&#x27;s final steam-powered commuter train between Jersey City and Spring Valley, New York. Later that same year, the railroad launched trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC) services.

Erie Railroad prospered throughout the mid-1950s, but its profits were simultaneously on a decline. The company&#x27;s 1957 income was half of that of 1956; by 1958 and 1959, Erie Railroad posted large deficits. The Erie&#x27;s financial losses resulted in them entering negotiations to merge with the nearby Delaware, Lackawanna and Western. The proposed merger led to the abandonment of duplicate freight facilities in Binghamton and Elmira, New York. Between 1956 and 1957, the Erie shifted its passenger trains from its Pavonia Terminal to the DL&amp;W&#x27;s newer Hoboken Terminal. The DL&amp;W also abandoned most of their mainline between Binghamton and Elmira, in favor of the Erie&#x27;s parallel mainline, in 1958. The merger negotiations subsequently accelerated, and they briefly considered including the Delaware and Hudson Railroad (D&amp;H); on October 17, 1960, the Erie and the DL&amp;W merged together to create the Erie Lackawanna Railway. However, the merged railroad only operated for sixteen years, before their financial decline forced them to be absorbed into Conrail in 1976. Some former Erie trackage between Hornell and Binghamton were damaged in 1972 by Hurricane Agnes. The Erie&#x27;s large repair facility in Hornell was closed following Conrail&#x27;s takeover, and operations were consolidated at the Lackawanna&#x27;s Scranton facility.

== Lines operated ==

A map from 1960 shows that the Erie had some control over the former Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railway and the New York Central from Lawrenceville to Newberry Junction, near Williamsport, PA.

== Passenger service ==
The Erie Railroad operated a number of named passenger trains, although none were as well-known or successful as others like the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; or New York Central Railroad&#x27;s &quot;20th Century Limited&quot;. Some of the Erie&#x27;s most well known trains included the &quot;Erie Limited&quot;, &quot;Lake Cities&quot;, &quot;Pacific Express&quot;, &quot;Atlantic Express&quot;, &quot;Midlander&quot;, &quot;Southern Tier Express&quot; and &quot;Mountain Express&quot;. All of these had their western termini in Chicago, except the &quot;Mountain Express&quot; which terminated in Hornell, in the Southern Tier of New York.

The Erie operated an extensive network of commuter routes in northern New Jersey and the lower Hudson Valley of New York. Most of these routes became part of Conrail along with the rest of Erie Lackawanna&#x27;s rail operations in 1976. The New Jersey routes are now part of NJ Transit&#x27;s Hoboken Division, originating and terminating at Hoboken Terminal. The Hudson Valley routes are now part of Metro-North Railroad.

In addition to its steam and diesel services the Erie also operated an electric commuter rail line to its terminal station in Rochester, New York. The station was one of the Erie&#x27;s few electrified railroad stations, and the railroad became one of the first to provide electric commuter services in 1907.

<text>Canvassing, also known as door knocking or phone banking, is the systematic initiation of direct contact with individuals, commonly used during political campaigns. Canvassing can be done for many reasons: political campaigning, grassroots fundraising, community awareness, membership drives, and more. Campaigners knock on doors to contact people personally. Canvassing is used by political parties and issue groups to identify supporters, persuade the undecided, and add voters to the voters list through voter registration, and it is central to get out the vote operations. It is the core element of what political campaigns call the &quot;ground game&quot; or &quot;field&quot;.

Organized political canvassing became a central tool of contested election campaigns in Britain, and has remained a core practice performed by thousands of volunteers at each election there, and in many countries with similar political systems.

Canvassing can also refer to a neighborhood canvass performed by law enforcement in the course of an investigation. This is a systematic approach to interviewing residents, merchants, and others who are in the immediate vicinity of a crime and may have useful information.

In the United States, the compilation of election returns and validation of the outcome that forms the basis of the official results is also called canvassing.

==Practice==

A modern election canvass may be conducted by a candidate, volunteers, and/or paid canvassers. The canvassers are given lists known as &quot;canvass sheets&quot; (or access to a canvassing app) or in the UK as &quot;reading pads&quot;. These are a list of households to be contacted, generated from a voter database. Some campaigns today have replaced paper sheets with tablet or smartphone apps.

The canvasser will try to contact each of the households on their list, and deliver a script containing questions and persuasive messaging provided by the campaign. Almost all election canvassing includes asking how a person plans to vote. Supporters may then be asked themselves to volunteer, or to take a lawn sign. Those who are wavering or undecided may be given a message of persuasion. If foot canvassing, the canvasser may also distribute flyers.

During the canvass, the results will be entered into the voter database. This will update the campaign&#x27;s list of voters, removing those who have moved or are deceased and adding new residents who may have been found. The data on the questions will be used for further contact, a supporter may be added to a list for get out the vote or fundraising, while a hostile voter might be dropped from future contact.

==History==

===Origins===
The origin of the term is an older spelling of &quot;canvas&quot;, to sift by shaking in a sheet of canvas, hence to discuss thoroughly.

An organized canvass can be seen as early as the elections in the Roman Republic. In those campaigns candidates would shake the hands of all eligible voters in the Forum. Whispering into the ear of some candidates would be a &quot;nomenclator&quot;, a slave who had been trained to memorize the names of all the voters, so that the candidate could greet them all by name.

Modern canvassing can be traced back to the rise of contested elections in England. For the first centuries of the English Parliament elections were rarely contested. Losing an election was considered a dishonor to oneself, and to friends and family. Campaigning thus involved quiet sounding out of the small pool of voters. Only once this process had convinced a candidate that he had enough votes to win would he declare his interest in the seat.

Beginning in the Elizabethan era, and expanding during the conflicts under the Stuarts, elections began to be openly contested. Canvassing was a controversial strategy. In both 1604 and 1626 canvassing for votes was banned. It was seen as a violation to free elections, as votes would be won by persuasion rather than a voter making up his own mind. Despite this, by the late 17th century, canvassing was standard practice in English elections. Rival campaigns would attempt a full canvass of all voters, which even in the largest districts would only be a few thousand people.
There were many reasons why candidates invested much time and money in canvassing. As in the previous tradition of sounding out supporters before announcing, many candidates would use the canvass to determine their level of support, and would drop out before election day if it proved insufficient. Part of the concern would be financial. Campaigning was expensive in an era when voters expected to be plied with food and drink. In this period the candidates had to cover the costs of the election itself. If candidates did not find enough votes during their canvass they would drop out before wasting more money on a losing campaign.

Building the list of voters was also important, as only some districts kept full poll books. Legal wrangling over who met the property requirements to vote was important in many campaigns, and canvassing was used to add supporters to the rolls, while investigating the claims of opponents. The growing list of supporters would also be essential to an election day operation. In early elections all voters had to travel to a central town, often some distance from their home, and polling could last several days. During this time voters would be away from their work and their fields. As an example of the challenges, one losing candidate had identified 639 supporters in Kent for the Short Parliament election of 1640, but only 174 voted, most going home after finding out the polling would take three days.

===Persuasion and corruption===
A candidate would also make sure to knock on as many doors as possible to win over the voters. Speaking to as many voters as possible was seen as an essential tool to win the &quot;wavering multitudes.&quot;

By the 18th century canvassing was standard practice, but this was also an era of gross electoral corruption, and canvassing was used to bribe and threaten voters, as famously depicted in William Hogarth&#x27;s &quot;Humours of an Election&quot; series of paintings. Most directly this would take the form of direct bribes to voters. This was the practice in only a minority of districts, but in some areas large bribes had become habitual. In areas without direct bribery, candidates were expected to provide food, drink and banquets. For the priciest campaigns, these various costs added up to sums equivalent to several million pounds in today&#x27;s money, causing financial hardship even for wealthy candidates.
In the first elections held in the United States, canvassing was rare. Most elections were uncontested, and even in races with multiple candidates it was considered improper for a candidate to campaign on his own behalf. As the party system developed in the early 19th century, elections became more contested and voluntary associations developed to work on candidates&#x27; behalf. As in the United Kingdom, canvassing became an important part of their operations, and they would attempt to visit each voter in a district.

This system soon became a venue for gross corruption. Machine politics developed in the large cities of the eastern US. Winning candidates would reward their supporters with patronage appointments, and direct bribery was also common; one study estimated that 20% of New York voters were compensated for their votes during Gilded Age elections.

In the United Kingdom, the Reform Act 1832 attacked corruption and expanded the franchise. This, combined with the growing strength of the national parties, transformed canvassing. There were no lists of who was eligible to vote under the new law, and it was up to individual voters to register themselves. The parties launched mass canvasses with the goal of adding all of the party&#x27;s supporters to the electoral roll. As an example, in Norwich the 1874 saw 3000 Liberal and 2000 Conservative paid workers engaged in voter registration. The massive paid canvassing came to an end with the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883, which limited campaign spending. Thus the armies of paid canvassers were replaced with smaller volunteer efforts. Laws were also changed in the United Kingdom to make voter registration almost automatic, removing the need for the parties to expend efforts on it.

=== Voter identification and decline ===
As corruption faded, parties returned to using canvassing to win votes through persuasion and get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts. This was especially true of the new socialist parties such as the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, and the CCF in Canada who had little money but enthusiastic volunteer bases who could be deployed to door steps.

The years after the Second World War saw a general decline in canvassing. Political scientists began to question the utility of traditional campaigns. The Michigan model of voter behaviour became the accepted wisdom. It argued that voters had deep-set partisan loyalties, and that changes in such loyalties take years to develop. A simple knock on the door will do nothing to change a voter&#x27;s opinion. Parties thus switched their canvassing resources away from persuading voters, focusing only on identifying their supporters and making sure they voted. The British Labour Party adopted the Reading System developed by Ian Mikardo to win the Reading constituency in 1945. It was based on concentrating exclusively on pro-Labour areas and boosting their turnout, while ignoring non-supporters.

Even these approaches were found wanting. David Butler in his Nuffield Model of UK elections found that during the 1950s and 1960s, local campaigns had no effect on the results. With the rise of television, resources were shifted from the ground to mass market advertising, with canvassing seen as a relic of the past. Ivor Crewe argued that &quot;constituency organizing counts for next to nothing in the television age.&quot; One political scientist wrote there was a belief that canvassing was an &quot;elaborate ritual bringing some sense of gratification to the participants, but making no difference to election results.&quot;

===Revival===
In the United States, canvassing hit its all-time low during the 1996 election, with the lowest reported rates of political volunteering, and the lowest recorded voter turnout. Political scientists began to reassess the effects of canvassing. In Britain new studies found that unlike in earlier decades, a strong field campaign was having an effect on the result. In the United States Alan S. Gerber and Donald Green launched a series of controlled experiments, and demonstrated that foot canvassing was one of the most effective tools available to boost voter turnout.

The years since 2000 have seen a widespread revival of election canvassing. An intensive effort by the Al Gore campaign of 2000 was credited with gaining several points on election day in the 2000 election, enough to win the popular vote despite being down several points in the polls the day before. Subsequently, the Republicans launched their 72 Hour Program of get out the vote efforts over the last three days of a campaign, and also found demonstrable proof that it gained them several points in key races. The Obama campaigns of 2008 and 2012 were especially noted for dedicating resources to a field program.

New technologies changed how canvassing was conducted. While door-to-door blockwalking has been prior to COVID-19 been the most common canvassing technique, canvassing can also be done via phone, texting, and social media. Expansive databases of the electorate, such as the Democrats&#x27; NGP VAN, pulled together canvassing data, consumer information, and demographic profiles to allow precise targeting of voters. No longer would campaigns knock on all the doors in a district, rather voters who would most be persuaded to support the candidate or come out to vote could be targeted. Large campaigns incorporated A/B testing into their canvassing, to further hone and improve its effectiveness.

== Around the world ==
Originating in the United Kingdom, canvassing is most widespread in those countries that have borrowed from the British political system. It is standard practice in elections in Ireland, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. In India, despite the million or more voters in many constituencies, parties have made the effort to have canvassers visit the door of each house in each village.

Door-to-door canvassing has been little known in most other countries. It has been used in several Latin American countries, including Brazil and Chile. By utilizing newer technological resources like WhatsApp, voter turnout has increased among younger voters in Brazil. After the highly publicized canvassing tactics of the Obama campaign, similar tactics have been tried in France and Germany.

In Scandinavia door-to-door canvassing was an accepted part of election campaigning in the first half of the 20th century, but has since faded. It still exists, but an activist knocking on someone&#x27;s door is considered somewhat unseemly. More widespread workplace canvasses have been organized, either by labour unions or by employers.

In Pakistan, it has been found that canvassing is effective in increasing voter turnout and in facilitating political conversation when catered towards the men and women in the household. 

Canvassing for votes is forbidden in Japan due to fear of leftist control. This has been the case since the original General Election Law of 1925. The restrictions have been brought to the Supreme Court on several occasions, but have been upheld as constitutional.

==Effectiveness==
There has been a long history of studying the effectiveness of canvassing beginning with a 1927 study by Harold Foote Gosnell. Through the 1980s, a series of both controlled and natural experiments created a consensus that canvassing had a small effect on turnout, and no observable persuasive effect on whom to vote for.

In 1999, Gerber and Green published their first paper presenting a rigorously controlled experiment that produced a substantial turnout boost from canvassing in a municipal election in New Haven, Connecticut. This study revived interest in the subject. Since then Gerber, Green, and other political scientists have conducted a program that verified those results, and tested what techniques are most effective. Foot canvassing is the most effective contact method, increasing turnout by about 7 percentage points, while phoning boosts it by 2.6 points. Other contact techniques such as direct mail, robocalls, and email have small to undetectable effects. Other studies have found that canvassing can do more to boost turnout, and also win new votes at the door through persuasion.

In the city of Duisburg in Germany, another study was conducted to compare the effectivity of in-person canvassing versus mail-in surveys. This research was done in 2022 so volunteer canvassers followed health precautions during their research. The 11 canvassers found that the simpleness of coming door to door, with a small cash motivation, was more effective than mail-in surveys. 

A 2018 study in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot; found that door-to-door canvassing on behalf of the François Hollande campaign in the 2012 French presidential election &quot;did not affect turnout, but increased Hollande&#x27;s vote share in the first round and accounted for one fourth of his victory margin in the second. Visits&#x27; impact persisted in later elections, suggesting a lasting persuasion effect.&quot;

There are some studies that suggest that canvassing is less effective in certain European nations. In an article from the &quot;British Journal of Political Science&quot;, they found some evidence that the effectiveness in European canvasing activities is far less compared to the United States, compiling several studies of canvassing in Denmark. However, the paper did not come to one conclusion on the cause of this discrepancy.

== British example script ==
The following is an excerpt from a script used by the UK Labour Party in the buildup to a general election for telephone canvassing:

:Hello, can I speak to &quot;(voter&#x27;s name)&quot; please? Hello &quot;(voter&#x27;s name)&quot; my name is &quot;(name)&quot;. I&#x27;m calling on behalf of &quot;(MP/parliamentary spokesperson)&quot;. I&#x27;m calling to find out your views on the Labour government&#x27;s priorities. Which of the following do you think are the three most important priorities for the government? [Lists five policy areas – &#x27;better schools&#x27;, &#x27;better hospitals&#x27;, &#x27;more jobs&#x27;, &#x27;less crime&#x27; and &#x27;strong economy&#x27;] Let me tell you what Labour is doing in these areas and what the Tories would do if they were re-elected [refers to &#x27;dividing lines&#x27; table where Conservative policies are compared unfavourably with Labour]. Now can I ask you which party you think you will vote for at the next general election?

The script then divides into two sections based on whether the voter intends to support Labour or another party. The section for Labour supporters encourages the use of postal votes, asks whether the individual would consider displaying a poster in their window or deliver leaflets on their street and asks whether the individual would consider joining the party. The section for non-Labour voters asks the following questions:

# Which main political party do you identify with?
# There will be elections in &quot;(date)&quot;, which party will you vote for at these elections?
# How did you vote in the last general election?
# Who would be your second choice?
# Do you vote at every election?

== United States constitutionality ==

Local governments in the United States have passed local laws to limit Americans&#x27; ability to canvass. Many of these challenges escalated to the Supreme Court, which has ruled overwhelmingly on the side of the public&#x27;s right to canvass as protected by the First Amendment. For example, in &quot;Martin v. Struthers&quot;, Justice Hugo Black stated:Freedom to distribute information to every citizen wherever he desires to receive it is so clearly vital to the preservation of a free society that ... it must be fully preserved. To require a censorship through license which makes impossible the free and unhampered distribution of pamphlets strikes at the very heart of the constitutional guarantees.In 2002, the Supreme Court reconfirmed its conviction that canvassing is protected by U.S. First Amendment rights in &quot;Watchtower Society v. Village of Stratton&quot;. Justice John Paul Stevens stated:It is offensive, not only to the values protected by the First Amendment, but to the very notion of a free society that in the context of everyday public discourse a citizen must first inform the government of her desire to speak to her neighbors and then obtain a permit to do so.

<text>Nadab ( &quot;Nāḏāḇ&quot;) was, according to the Hebrew Bible, the second king of the northern Israelite Kingdom of Israel. He was the son and successor of Jeroboam. 

== Reign ==
Nadab became king of Israel in the second year of Asa, King of Judah, and reigned for two years. William F. Albright has dated his reign to 901–900 BCE, while E. R. Thiele offers the dates 910–909 BCE.

In the second year of his reign, while they were besieging Gibbethon, a Philistine town in southern Dan, a conspiracy broke out in Nadab&#x27;s army. He was slain by one of his own captains, Baasha, who then made himself king of Israel.

Having slain Nadab, Baasha put to death the remainder of the royal family (, ). This was consistent with the prophecy given via Ahijah the Shilonite concerning the extinction of the entire House of Jeroboam.
Nadab, son of King Jeroboam I and Egyptian Princess Ano, was next in line for the throne. Following the untimely death of his brother Abijah, Nadab became the crown prince. As a member of the tribe of Ephraim, Nadab&#x27;s reign was marked by turmoil, ultimately leading to his downfall.

Baasha, one of Nadab&#x27;s own commanders, orchestrated a coup, overthrowing and killing Nadab. This pivotal event marked the end of Nadab&#x27;s ill-fated monarchy in Israel.

<text>State Route 86 (SR 86) is a north–south state highway in the U.S. State of California that connects the Imperial and Coachella valleys in the southeastern desert region of the state. It runs from State Route 111 near the Mexican border crossing at Calexico north through the Imperial Valley via El Centro and Brawley, and around the west side of the Salton Sea into the Coachella Valley. It then goes through Coachella before terminating at Interstate 10 in Indio.

==Route description==
SR 86 begins at an intersection with SR 111, just east of the town of Heber, as Heber Road. After traveling west through Heber, and intersecting CR S31, SR 86 heads north and enters the city of El Centro (as 4th Street), having an interchange with I-8. Passing through downtown El Centro, SR 86 intersects Main Street (CR S80) before curving to the west (as Adams Avenue). The highway continues north on Imperial Avenue before it enters the city of Imperial and passes Imperial County Airport, continuing north as it leaves the city limits.

North of Imperial, SR 86 intersects CR S27 before making a turn to the northeast, entering the city of Brawley. It passes to the west of downtown (as Western Avenue) before turning west onto Main Street, running concurrently with SR 78. Both SR 78 and 86 turn northwest before passing through the city of Westmoreland and intersecting CR S30. After briefly turning west, SR 78 and 86 turn northwest again and pass through Elmore and Kane Spring; SR 78 turns west (towards San Diego County), while SR 86 continues northwest along the western edge of the Salton Sea (just east of Anza-Borrego Desert State Park), before it intersects CR S22. SR 86 passes through the Torres-Martinez Indian Reservation and Coolidge Spring before entering Riverside County.

Just north of the county line in Oasis, SR 86 continues north on an expressway, turning away from the Salton Sea and heading through agricultural fields and farmlands. The route then meets SR 111, and turns northwest, running parallel to that highway. As it nears Indio, the expressway turns into a freeway. SR 86 ends at an interchange with I-10.

SR 86 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and north of the southern SR 78 junction is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

==History==
In the late 20th century, SR 86 had a rather notorious reputation for frequent and often fatal collisions. For much of its length, especially between the southern tip of the Coachella Valley to the Imperial County line, SR 86 was a two-lane road with easy access from rural side roads. A driver trying to pass might find himself headed straight for the side of another vehicle pulling out from one of the side roads. This reputation earned SR 86 the nickname &quot;Blood Alley&quot;.

Originally a part of U.S. Route 99 until the 1960s, the northern end of SR 86 was widened and rerouted through the new and rather unusually numbered &quot;86S Expressway&quot; (for “supplemental”) soon after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), making SR 86 a four- or six-lane highway for most of its length. Since it is easier to enter California from the Imperial Valley than through San Diego, SR 86 sees a great deal of truck traffic to and from Mexico, earning it still another nickname, &quot;The NAFTA Highway&quot;. The new highway has proven to be at least as dangerous as the old alignment owing to much the same problems of poorly marked and uncontrolled side roads. A rash of fatal crashes in early 2005 prompted the city of Coachella to push Caltrans for the installation of at least two more traffic signals on SR 86S.
State Route 86S (SR 86S) was an expressway running through the Coachella Valley. In December 2012, the SR 86 designation was transferred to the routing of SR 86S, and SR 86S ceased to exist. State Route 195 was removed from the state highway system as a result. SR 86 was originally truncated to Avenue 46, but the State Route 86S expressway, which replaced SR 86 around the east side of Coachella and Indio, did reach I-10. Despite SR 86&#x27;s rerouting, the Airport Boulevard interchange remains numbered as exit 16, reflecting the former SR 86S&#x27;s distance.
