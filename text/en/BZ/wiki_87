<text>Man in the Wilderness is a 1971 American revisionist Western film about a scout for a group of mountain men who are traversing the Northwestern United States during the 1820s. The scout is mauled by a bear and left to die by his companions. He survives and recuperates sufficiently to track his former comrades, forcing a confrontation over his abandonment. The story is loosely based on the life of Hugh Glass. It stars Richard Harris as Zachary Bass and John Huston as Captain Henry.

The expedition in the movie is notable for bringing a large boat with it, borne on wheels.

==Plot==
In 1820, an expedition led by Captain Henry has completed two years of fur trapping in the unexplored Northwest territory. They are determined to reach the Missouri River before winter so they can sail south and trade their goods. Lowrie, a young trapper, hunts a deer and Zachary Bass follows after it until he is mauled by a brown bear. Too afraid to intervene, Lowrie sends for Henry and his men, who eventually kill the bear. 

Zachary&#x27;s flesh wounds are examined by the expedition&#x27;s doctor, Ferris, who believes he will not survive the journey. Henry orders Lowrie and Fogarty, another trapper, to have Zachary buried if he is not dead by morning and have Lowrie delivery an eulogy. Both men remain at Zachary&#x27;s side as the expedition departs. By the next morning, both men leave Zachary, who is still conscious, for dead as the Arikara natives approach. The natives approach him and leave without incident, as Zachary drifts in and out of consciousness. He first remembers his days as a student, and his then-pregnant wife Grace, who urges him to believe God is in him and all living things. 

Within hours, Lowrie and Fogarty return to Henry&#x27;s expedition and report they had left Zachary for dead. Henry decides not to return back for him, believing Zachary would want the expedition to continue. Meanwhile, Zachary, though injured, scavenges for food by consuming berries and raw bison meat. He builds himself a leg crutch and salvages wire, a knife, and a spear to kindle a fire. He traps a rabbit and uses its fur as an armpit cushion. Within days, Zachary&#x27;s strength regains, and he traps and skins a cougar for its coat. 

As the winter approaches, Zachary hides as a native couple approaches, and watches as the woman gives birth. This rekindles past memories of Grace, who had died in childbirth to an infant son. Fogarty, who is on the night watch, believes he sees Zachary and shoots him, but it turns out he had killed Lowrie. The next morning, the expedition arrive at a frozen river, and are forced to carry the boat for the duration of the expedition.

One morning, the natives head towards Henry&#x27;s expedition, and a gunfight ensues. Zachary pushes forward to help the expedition until the native chief stops the fighting when he recognizes Zachary. The chief blesses Zachary and returns his spear to him. Zachary returns to the expedition and approaches Henry, who returns his rifle back to him. Henry fears he will be shot, but Zachary decides to return back to his son. He leaves, and the expedition follows after him.

==Production==
&quot;Man in the Wilderness&quot; is based loosely on the 1818–20 Missouri Expedition and &quot;Capt. Henry&quot; is likely a fictionalized Major Andrew Henry of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. It was based on an original script by Jack De Witt, and bought by producer Sandy Howard. In December 1970 Howard announced that the film would star Richard Harris, who had made &quot;A Man Called Horse&quot; for Howard. Elliot Silverstein directed &quot;Horse&quot; but clashed with Harris so Richard Sarafian was brought in to direct this film. Howard said he was &quot;convinced&quot; that Sarafian &quot;is going to be one of the most important directors in America very soon.&quot;

Filming took three months from April to June 1971. The film was shot near Covaleda, Province of Soria, Spain, with the terrain looking more like the Adirondack wilderness and less like the Absaroka Range country of the Yellowstone River. Not technically a &quot;Spaghetti Western&quot;, &quot;Man&quot; was filmed in the rugged highlands where David Lean had shot some of the scenes for &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; in 1964.

John Huston joined the production a few days after quitting as director of the film &quot;The Last Run&quot; due to on-set fights with George C. Scott.

The bear who attacks Harris&#x27; character was called Peg. The attack sequence was filmed using a dummy.

&quot;This movie is Genesis to me,&quot; said Harris. &quot;It&#x27;s my apocalypse. It&#x27;s a very special and very personal statement about a man struggling for personal identity, looking for God and discovering Him in the wilderness, in leaves and trees. It&#x27;s all the things that the young people, and we, are missing today.&quot;

Harris only had nine lines of dialogue.

==Themes==
Though survival and revenge are the main themes, Christianity and religion play a significant role in the evolution of the main character, who is shown through flashbacks to be at odds with religion and God in general due to his lonely and abusive childhood involving indoctrination into Christianity.

==Release==
The film was theatrically released in the United States on November 24, 1971, including New York City, New York, and Los Angeles, California.

The film was the first feature to be shown in years at the newly refurbished Princess Theatre (renamed the Klondike Theatre, at the time) in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, on December 25, 1971.

<doc id="752040" wikidata="Q910445" url="?curid=752040" title="Hick's law">
<text>Hick&#x27;s law, or the Hick–Hyman law, named after British and American psychologists William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices: increasing the number of choices will increase the decision time logarithmically. The Hick–Hyman law assesses cognitive information capacity in choice reaction experiments. The amount of time taken to process a certain amount of bits in the Hick–Hyman law is known as the &quot;rate of gain of information&quot;. The plain language implication of the finding is that increasing the number of choices does not directly increase the time to choose. In other words, twice as many choices does not result in twice as long to choose. Also, because the relationship is logarithmic, the increase in time it takes to choose becomes less and less as the number of choices increases.

==Background==
In 1868, Franciscus Donders reported the relationship between having multiple stimuli and choice reaction time. In 1885, J. Merkel discovered that the response time is longer when a stimulus belongs to a larger set of stimuli. Psychologists began to see similarities between this phenomenon and information theory.

Hick first began experimenting with this theory in 1951. In his first experiment, there were 10 lamps arranged circularly around the subject. There were 10 Morse keys for each of his fingers that corresponded to these lamps. A running pre-punched tape roll activated a random lamp every 5 seconds; 4 electric pens recorded this lamp activation on moving paper in 4-bit binary. When the subject tapped the corresponding key, the 4 pens recorded the response, using the same system. Although Hicks notes his experimental design using a 4-bit binary recording process was capable of showing up to 15 positions and &quot;all clear&quot;, in his experiment he required the device to give an accurate record of reaction time between 10 options after a stimulus for the experiment.

Hick performed a second experiment using the same task, while keeping the number of alternatives at 10. The participant performed the task the first two times with the instruction to perform the task as accurately as possible. For the last task, the participant was asked to perform the task as quickly as possible.

While Hick was stating that the relationship between reaction time and the number of choices was logarithmic, Hyman wanted to better understand the relationship between the reaction time and the mean number of choices. In Hyman’s experiment, he had eight different lights arranged in a 6x6 matrix. Each of these different lights was given a name, so the participant was timed in the time it took to say the name of the light after it was lit. Further experiments changed the number of each different type of light. Hyman was responsible for determining a linear relation between reaction time and the information transmitted.

==Law==

Given &quot;n&quot; equally probable choices, the average reaction time &quot;T&quot; required to choose among the choices is approximately:

:formula_1

where &quot;b&quot; is a constant that can be determined empirically by fitting a line to measured data. The logarithm expresses depth of &quot;choice tree&quot; hierarchy – log2 indicates binary search was performed. Addition of 1 to &quot;n&quot; takes into account the &quot;uncertainty about whether to respond or not, as well as about which response to make.&quot;

In the case of choices with unequal probabilities, the law can be generalized as:

:formula_2

where &quot;H&quot; is strongly related to the information-theoretic entropy of the decision, defined as

:formula_3

where &quot;pi&quot; refers to the probability of the &quot;i&quot;th alternative yielding the information-theoretic entropy.

Hick&#x27;s law is similar in form to Fitts&#x27;s law. Hick&#x27;s law has a logarithmic form because people subdivide the total collection of choices into categories, eliminating about half of the remaining choices at each step, rather than considering each and every choice one-by-one, which would require linear time.

===Relation to IQ===

E. Roth (1964) demonstrated a correlation between IQ and information processing speed, which is the reciprocal of the slope of the function:

:formula_4

where &quot;n&quot; is the number of choices. The time it takes to come to a decision is:

proportional to :formula_5

==Stimulus–response compatibility==
The stimulus–response compatibility is known to also affect the choice reaction time for the Hick–Hyman law. This means that the response should be similar to the stimulus itself (such as turning a steering wheel to turn the wheels of the car). The action the user performs is similar to the response the driver receives from the car.

==Exceptions==

Studies suggest that the search for a word within a randomly ordered list—in which the reaction time increases linearly according to the number of items—does not allow for the generalization of the scientific law, considering that, in other conditions, the reaction time may not be linearly associated to the logarithm of the number of elements or even show other variations of the basic plane.

Exceptions to Hick&#x27;s law have been identified in studies of verbal response to familiar stimuli, where there is no relationship or only a subtle increase in the reaction time associated with an increased number of elements, and saccade responses, where it was shown that there is either no relationship, or a decrease in the saccadic time with the increase of the number of elements, thus an antagonistic effect to that postulated by Hick&#x27;s law.

The generalization of Hick&#x27;s law was also tested in studies on the predictability of transitions associated with the reaction time of elements that appeared in a structured sequence. This process was first described as being in accordance to Hick&#x27;s law, but more recently it was shown that the relationship between predictability and reaction time is sigmoid, not linear associated with different modes of action.

Hick&#x27;s law is sometimes cited to justify menu design decisions. For example, to find a given word (e.g. the name of a command) in a randomly ordered word list (e.g. a menu), scanning of each word in the list is required, consuming linear time, so Hick&#x27;s law does not apply. However, if the list is alphabetical and the user knows the name of the command, he or she may be able to use a subdividing strategy that works in logarithmic time.

<text>Obliquity: Why our goals are best achieved indirectly is a book by economist John Kay. It was inspired by an observation of the successful pharmaceutical researcher, Sir James Black:

The theme of the book is that businesses and other enterprises are best run by enthusiasts who pursue excellence in their speciality. Financial success then follows from this. But, if financial goals are instead made the primary objective, the business will then lose its vigour and may fail.

<text>Zinc chloride is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula ZnCl2·&quot;n&quot;H2O, with &quot;n&quot; ranging from 0 to 4.5, forming hydrates. Zinc chloride, anhydrous and its hydrates, are colorless or white crystalline solids, and are highly soluble in water. Five hydrates of zinc chloride are known, as well as four polymorphs of anhydrous zinc chloride.

All forms of zinc chloride are deliquescent. They can usually be produced by the reaction of zinc or its compounds with some form of hydrogen chloride. Anhydrous zinc compound is a Lewis acid, readily forming complexes with a variety of Lewis bases. Zinc chloride finds wide application in textile processing, metallurgical fluxes, chemical synthesis of organic compounds, such as benzaldehyde, and processes to produce other compounds of zinc.

==History==
Zinc chloride has long been known but currently practiced industrial applications all evolved in the latter half of 20th century.

An amorphous cement formed from aqueous zinc chloride and zinc oxide was first investigated in 1855 by Stanislas Sorel. Sorel later went on to investigate the related magnesium oxychloride cement, which bears his name.

Dilute aqueous zinc chloride was used as a disinfectant under the name &quot;Burnett&#x27;s Disinfecting Fluid&quot;. From 1839 Sir William Burnett promoted its use as a disinfectant as well as a wood preservative. The Royal Navy conducted trials into its use as a disinfectant in the late 1840s, including during the cholera epidemic of 1849; and at the same time experiments were conducted into its preservative properties as applicable to the shipbuilding and railway industries. Burnett had some commercial success with his eponymous fluid. Following his death however, its use was largely superseded by that of carbolic acid and other proprietary products.

==Structure and properties==
Unlike other metal dichlorides, zinc dichloride adopts several crystalline forms (polymorphs). Four polymorph are known: α, β, γ, and δ. Each features centers surrounded in a tetrahedral manner by four chloride ligands.

Here &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are lattice constants, &quot;Z&quot; is the number of structure units per unit cell, and ρ is the density calculated from the structure parameters.

The orthorhombic form (δ) rapidly changes to another polymorph upon exposure to the atmosphere. A possible explanation is that the ions originating from the absorbed water facilitate the rearrangement. Rapid cooling of molten gives a glass.

Molten has a high viscosity at its melting point and a comparatively low electrical conductivity, which increases markedly with temperature. As indicated by a Raman scattering study, the viscosity is explained by the presence of polymers. Neutron scattering study indicated the presence of tetrahedral centers, which requires aggregation of monomers as well.

===Hydrates===
A variety of hydrated zinc chloride are known: with &quot;n&quot; = 1, 1.33, 2.5, 3, and 4.5. The 1.33-hydrate, previously thought to be the hemitrihydrate, consists of &quot;trans&quot;-Zn(H2O)4Cl2 centers with the chlorine atoms connected to repeating ZnCl4 chains. The hemipentahydrate, structurally formulated [Zn(H2O)5][ZnCl4], consists of Zn(H2O)5Cl octahedrons where the chlorine atom is part of a [ZnCl4]2- tetrahedera. The trihydrate consists of distinct hexaaquozinc(II) cations and tetrachlorozincate anions; formulated [Zn(H2O)6][ZnCl4]. Finally, the heminonahydrate, structurally formulated [Zn(H2O)6][ZnCl4]·3H2O also consists of distinct hexaaquozinc(II) cations and tetrachlorozincate anions like the trihydrate but has three extra water molecules. These hydrates can be produced by evaporation of aqueous solutions of zinc chloride at different temperatures.

==Preparation and purification==
Historically, zinc chlorides are prepared from the reaction of hydrochloric acid with zinc metal or zinc oxide. Aqueous acids cannot be used to produce anhydrous zinc chloride. According to an early procedure, a suspension of powdered zinc in diethyl ether is treated with hydrogen chloride, followed by drying The overall method remains useful in industry, but without the solvent:

Aqueous solutions may be readily prepared similarly by treating Zn metal, zinc carbonate, zinc oxide, and zinc sulfide with hydrochloric acid:
Hydrates can be produced by evaporation of an aqueous solution of zinc chloride. The temperature of the evaporation determines the hydrates For example, evaporation at room temperature produces the 1.33-hydrate. Lower evaporation temperatures produce higher hydrates.

Commercial samples of zinc chloride typically contain water and products from hydrolysis as impurities. Laboratory samples may be purified by recrystallization from hot dioxane. Anhydrous samples can be purified by sublimation in a stream of hydrogen chloride gas, followed by heating the sublimate to 400 °C in a stream of dry nitrogen gas. A simple method relies on treating the zinc chloride with thionyl chloride.

==Reactions==
===Chloride complexes===
A number of salts containing the tetrachlorozincate anion, , are known. &quot;Caulton&#x27;s reagent&quot;, , which is used in organic chemistry, is an example of a salt containing . The compound contains tetrahedral and  anions, so, the compound is not caesium pentachlorozincate, but caesium tetrachlorozincate chloride. No compounds containing the ion (hexachlorozincate ion) have been characterized. The compound crystallizes from a solution of in hydrochloric acid. It contains a polymeric anion with balancing monohydrated hydronium ions, ions.

===Adducts===

The adduct with thf illustrates the tendency of zinc chloride to form 1:2 adducts with weak Lewis bases. Being soluble in ethers and lacking acidic protons, this complex is used in the synthesis of organozinc compounds. A related 1:2 complex is (zinc dichloride di(hydroxylamine)). Known as Crismer&#x27;s salt, this complexes releases hydroxylamine upon heating. The distinctive ability of aqueous solutions of to dissolve cellulose is attributed to the formation of zinc-cellulose complexes, illustrating the stability of its adducts. Cellulose also dissolves in molten hydrate. Overall, this behavior is consistent with Zn2+ as a hard Lewis acid.

When solutions of zinc chloride are treated with ammonia, diverse ammine complexes are produced. In addition to the tetrahedral 1:2 complex . 
the complex also has been isolated. The latter contains the ion. The species in aqueous solution have been investigated and show that is the main species present with also present at lower :Zn ratio.

===Aqueous solutions of zinc chloride===
Zinc chloride dissolves readily in water to give species and some free chloride. Aqueous solutions of are acidic: a 6 M aqueous solution has a pH of 1. The acidity of aqueous solutions relative to solutions of other Zn2+ salts (say the sulfate) is due to the formation of the tetrahedral chloro aqua complexes such as [ZnCl3(H2O)]−. Most metal dichlorides form octahedral complexes, with stronger O-H bonds. The combination of hydrochloric acid and gives a reagent known as &quot;Lucas reagent&quot;. Such reagents were once used as a test for primary alcohols. Similar reactions are the basis of industrial routes from methanol and ethanol respectively to methyl chloride and ethyl chloride.

In alkali solution, zinc chloride converts to various zinc hydroxychlorides. These include , , , and the insoluble . The latter is the mineral simonkolleite. When zinc chloride hydrates are heated, hydrogen chloride evolves and hydroxychlorides result.

In aqueous solution , as well as other halides (bromide, iodide), behave interchangeably for the preparation of other zinc compounds. These salts give
precipitates of zinc carbonate when treated with aqueous carbonate sources:
Ninhydrin reacts with amino acids and amines to form a colored compound &quot;Ruhemann&#x27;s purple&quot; (RP). Spraying with a zinc chloride solution, which is colorless, forms a 1:1 complex RP:, which is more readily detected as it fluoresces more intensely than RP.

===Redox===
Anhydrous zinc chloride melts and even boils without any decomposition up to 900 °C. When zinc metal is dissolved in molten at 500–700 °C, a yellow diamagnetic solution is formed consisting of the , which has zinc in the oxidation state +1. The nature of this dizinc dication has been confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Although is unusual, mercury, a heavy congener of zinc, forms a wide variety of salts.

In the presence of oxygen, zinc chloride oxidizes to zinc oxide above 400 °C. Again, this observation indicates the nonoxidation of Zn2+.

===Zinc hydroxychloride===
Concentrated aqueous zinc chloride dissolves zinc oxide to form zinc hydroxychloride, which is obtained as colorless crystals:
The same material forms when hydrated zinc chloride is heated.

The ability of zinc chloride to dissolve metal oxides (MO) is relevant to the utility of as a flux for soldering. It dissolves passivating oxides, exposing the clean metal surface.

==Organic syntheses with zinc chloride==
Zinc chloride is an occasional laboratory reagent often as a Lewis acid. A dramatic example is the conversion of methanol into hexamethylbenzene using zinc chloride as the solvent and catalyst:
This kind of reactivity has been investigated for the valorization of C1 precursors.

Examples of zinc chloride as a Lewis acid include the Fischer indole synthesis: 

Related Lewis-acid behavior is illustrated by a traditional preparation of the dye fluorescein from phthalic anhydride and resorcinol, which involves a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This transformation has in fact been accomplished using even the hydrated sample shown in the picture above. Many examples describe the use of zinc chloride in Friedel-Crafts acylation reactions.

Zinc chloride also activates benzylic and allylic halides towards substitution by weak nucleophiles such as alkenes:
In similar fashion, promotes selective  reduction of tertiary, allylic or benzylic halides to the corresponding hydrocarbons.

Zinc enolates, prepared from alkali metal enolates and , provide control of stereochemistry in aldol condensation reactions. This control is attributed to chelation at the zinc. In the example shown below, the &quot;threo&quot; product was favored over the &quot;erythro&quot; by a factor of 5:1 when .

===Organozinc precursor===
Being inexpensive and anhydrous, ZnCl2 is a widely used for the synthesis of many organozinc reagents, such as those used in the palladium catalyzed Negishi coupling with aryl halides or vinyl halides. The prominence of this reaction was highlighted by the award of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Ei-ichi Negishi.
Rieke zinc, a highly reactive form of zinc metal, is generated by reduction of zinc dichloride with lithium. Rieke Zn is useful for the preparation of polythiophenes and for the Reformatsky reaction.

==Uses==
===Industrial organic chemistry===
Zinc chloride is used as a catalyst or reagent in diverse reactions conducted on an industrial scale. Benzaldehyde, 20,000 tons of which is produced annually in Western countries, is produced from inexpensive toluene by exploiting the catalytic properties of zinc dichloride. This process begins with the chlorination of toluene to give benzal chloride. In the presence of a small amount of anhydrous zinc chloride, a mixture of benzal chloride are treated continuously with water according to the following stoichiometry:
Similarly zinc chloride is employed in hydrolysis of benzotrichloride, the main route to benzoyl chloride. It serves as a catalyst for the production of methylene-bis(dithiocarbamate).

===As a metallurgical flux===
The use of zinc chloride as a flux, sometimes in a mixture with ammonium chloride (see also Zinc ammonium chloride), involves the production of HCl and its subsequent reaction with surface oxides.

Zinc chloride forms two salts with ammonium chloride: and , which decompose on heating liberating HCl, just as zinc chloride hydrate does. The action of zinc chloride/ammonium chloride fluxes, for example, in the hot-dip galvanizing process produces gas and ammonia fumes.

===Other uses===
Relevant to its affinity for these paper and textiles, is used as a fireproofing agent and in the process of making Vulcanized fibre, which is made by soaking paper in concentrated zinc chloride. Zinc chloride is also used as a deodorizing agent and to make zinc soaps.

==Safety and health==
Zinc and chloride are essential for life. Zn2+ is a component of several enzymes, e.g., carboxypeptidase and carbonic anhydrase. Thus, aqueous solutions of zinc chlorides are rarely problematic as an acute poison. Anhydrous zinc chloride is however an aggressive Lewis acid as it can burn skin and other tissues. Ingestion of zinc chloride, often from soldering flux, requires endoscopic monitoring. Another source of zinc chloride is zinc chloride smoke mixture (&quot;HC&quot;) used in smoke grenades. Containing zinc oxide, hexachloroethane and aluminium powder release zinc chloride, carbon and aluminium oxide smoke, an effective smoke screen. Such smoke screens can lead to fatalities.

<text>The Old San Antonio Road was a historic roadway located in the U.S. states of Texas and Louisiana. Parts of it were based on traditional Native American trails. Its Texas terminus was about southeast of Eagle Pass at the Rio Grande in Maverick County, and its northern terminus was at Natchitoches, Louisiana. The road continued from Texas through Monclova to Mexico City.

The Old San Antonio Road is considered a part of El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail.

==Route==
Louisiana Highway 6 mostly runs alongside the Old San Antonio Road for the entirety of its route through that state from Natchitoches to west of Many. State Highway 21 follows the old road to Midway, Texas, then State Highway OSR (for Old San Antonio Road) follows it around Bryan and College Station, and back to Highway 21 to the eastern outskirts of San Marcos. South of San Marcos, the road follows the Old Bastrop Road until it intersects with I-35. The road leaves the Interstate at New Braunfels and follows Solms road, then Nacogdoches Road, then Mission Road through San Antonio. South of San Antonio, the road follows Old Pleasanton Road, then varying local and county roads and merges with State Highway 97 to Cotulla. The road crosses private property and then follows Farm to Market Road 133 to Catarina. After Catarina, the road is on private property.

==History==
In 1690, Spanish explorer Alonso de León, following various Indian and buffalo trails, crossed the Rio Grande on his way to East Texas to establish missions, effectively blazing the Old San Antonio Road. In 1691, Domingo Terán de los Ríos took additional missionaries to East Texas following much the same course as traveled by De León. In 1693, Gregorio de Salinas Varona further defined the course of the road while bringing relief supplies from Monclova.

The Old San Antonio Road was not a single road, but a network of trails with different routes at different times. The trail&#x27;s path was dictated by things as diverse as weather and Native American threats.

During the time that Texas was a Spanish, then Mexican, state, the road was used as a major thoroughfare between Mexico City and East Texas. With Texas independence, however, trade between Mexico and Texas waned, while Mexico&#x27;s trade with the United States began to increase. The old route from San Antonio to Louisiana, now called the &quot;Camino Arriba&quot;, was still a vital link for Texans to the United States. During the 1860s, the old road had a brief revival as a supply line from the Texas interior to the Confederacy, and for the flow of cotton to Mexico as a means to circumvent the ever-tightening Union blockade.

After the Civil War, the name &quot;Camino Arriba&quot; faded and the road was called the Old San Antonio Road. By the 1870s, with the coming of the railroad, the roadway between San Antonio and Mexico had all but disappeared. It was then called the Lower Presidio Road.

===Preservation===


In 1915, the State of Texas and the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) funded a project to place pink granite markers at approximately intervals along the route of the Old San Antonio Road. V.N. Zively, a professional surveyor, mapped the routing in 1915 and 1916 and placed an oak post at each marker site. Inscribed granite markers were installed later, and the Texas DAR presented the markers to the State of Texas in a ceremony in San Antonio on March 2, 1918.

The State of Texas took this routing and marked the remaining county roads as State Highway OSR. Originally, the whole route from the Sabine River to San Marcos carried this designation, but it has since been reduced to a short bypass around Bryan.

As of February 2006, all but nine of the 123 markers were surviving, but many were moved from their original locations as the route of the road was straightened by new highway construction. In deep South Texas, many of the markers are now on private ranches. (&quot;See List of Old San Antonio Road DAR Markers.&quot;)

In 1929, the Texas legislature designated the Zivley version of the Old San Antonio Road as one of the historic trails of Texas. Later research by the Old San Antonio Road Preservation Commission determined that the Zively route is just one of no fewer than five different main routes that were used at various times.

In 1989, the Texas Legislature created the Old San Antonio Road Preservation Commission to coordinate a yearlong observance in 1991 of the 300th anniversary of the road and encourage tourism along the route. The member agencies of the commission—The Texas Historical Commission, the Texas Department of Transportation, Texas Parks and Wildlife, and the Department of Commerce—promoted the road and constructed a series of information panels to be placed along the route. The commission ceased operations in July, 1993.

On October 18, 2004, President Bush signed a bill designating The El Camino Real de Los Tejas, of which the Old San Antonio Road is part, a National Historic Trail. The Texas Legislature is considering a bill that would give the Texas Historical Commission authority to oversee the development and administration of El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail in conjunction with the National Park Service.

<doc id="752054" wikidata="Q5134289" url="?curid=752054" title="Clinton v. City of New York">
<text>Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998), was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court held, 6–3, that the line-item veto, as implemented in the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, violated the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution because it impermissibly gave the President of the United States the power to unilaterally amend or repeal parts of statutes that had been duly passed by the United States Congress. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the six-justice majority that the line-item veto gave the President power over legislation unintended by the Constitution, and was therefore a violation of the separation of powers between the two branches.

==Background of the case==
The Line Item Veto Act allowed the president to &quot;cancel&quot;, that is to void or legally nullify, certain provisions of appropriations bills, and disallowed the use of funds from canceled provisions for offsetting deficit spending in other areas.

===Political circumstances===
The 1994 midterm elections signaled an upheaval in American politics known as the Republican Revolution, with the Republican Party taking control of both houses of the U.S. Congress from Democrats. Key to that revolution was the Republicans&#x27; Contract with America, which included a list of actions they promised to take if they gained control of Congress. Among this list was the Line Item Veto Act itself, one of two provisions designed to ensure congressional fiscal conservatism. The Act was the only provision of the &quot;Contract with America&quot; that President Clinton supported.

===Initial litigation===
At its passage, the Act was politically controversial, with many Democrats breaking with Clinton to oppose it. Of the opposition, six members of Congress, including Republican Mark Hatfield, sued to prevent use of the line-item veto. They were granted summary judgment by the U.S. District Court, but the Supreme Court held that the Congressmen lacked standing because they could not show any particularized harm, and dismissed their suit in &quot;Raines v. Byrd&quot;, 521 U.S. 811 (1997). Within the next two months, Clinton began using the line-item veto, prompting several entities to file suit in a second attempt to have the Act declared unconstitutional.

In the second case, which was consolidated from two cases by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the City of New York and several organizations related to health care alleged injury from President Clinton&#x27;s cancellation of certain provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that eliminated certain liabilities, and Snake River Potato Growers, Inc. alleged injury from the President&#x27;s cancellation of certain provisions of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 that gave tax benefits to aid farmer&#x27;s cooperatives in purchasing potato processing facilities.

The District Court ruled for the plaintiffs, holding that the Line Item Veto Act was unconstitutional. Because the Act established an expedited appeal process for challenges, the case was directly appealed from the District Court to the Supreme Court.

==Supreme Court&#x27;s decision==

In a majority opinion written by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court ruled that because the Act allowed the President to unilaterally amend or repeal parts of duly enacted statutes by using line-item cancellations, it violated the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which outlines a specific practice for enacting a statute. The Court construed the silence of the Constitution on the subject of such unilateral Presidential action as equivalent to &quot;an express prohibition&quot;, agreeing with historical material that supported the conclusion that statutes may only be enacted &quot;in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure&quot;, and that a bill must be approved or rejected by the President in its entirety.

===Kennedy&#x27;s concurrence===
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, in an opinion concurring in the opinion and judgment of the Court, objected to the dissent&#x27;s argument that the Act did not violate principles of the separation of powers and threaten individual liberty, stating that the &quot;undeniable effects&quot; of the Act were to &quot;enhance the President&#x27;s power to reward one group and punish another, to help one set of taxpayers and hurt another, to favor one State and ignore another&quot;. Kennedy&#x27;s concurrence implicitly viewed the statute as a violation of the nondelegation doctrine.

===Breyer&#x27;s dissent===
In a dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen Breyer contended that the objective of the Act was constitutionally proper and was consistent with powers that the President has held in the past, stating that the Act &quot;does not violate any specific textual constitutional command, nor does it violate any implicit Separation of Powers principle&quot;. He extensively refers to many different cases which support the delegation of power by the Congress, and primarily suggests that the Act is an efficient means by which a constitutionally legitimate end may be achieved.

===Scalia&#x27;s partial concurrence and partial dissent===
In an alternative opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia objected to the Court&#x27;s consideration of the case with respect to the Taxpayer Relief Act, finding no party in the case with standing to challenge it. However, he did find a party with standing to challenge the President&#x27;s cancellation in the Balanced Budget Act, and concluded that it did not violate the Constitution, because the Congress has the power to delegate the discretionary authority to decline to spend appropriated sums of money, which he asserted was equivalent to cancellation.

==Critical response==

Michael B. Rappaport argued that the original meaning of the Constitution does not apply to certain parts of the nondelegation doctrine, relying on his interpretation of the Executive Power Vesting Clause. Under this view, &quot;laws that authorize the withdrawal of money from the treasury and which have traditionally taken the form of authorizing a certain amount to be spent for particular programs ... are not subject to the nondelegation doctrine&quot;. He further criticized the majority opinion for failing to satisfactorily justify its application of a stricter standard to the delegation of cancellation authority than it had used in the past for other executive delegations. In Rappaport&#x27;s opinion, &quot;the Court&#x27;s approach to cancellation authority has no basis in text, structure and purpose, or precedent&quot;.
J. Stephen Kennedy wrote that the majority of the Supreme Court was sufficiently concerned with the constitutional challenges to the line item veto presented to declare the act wholly unconstitutional, instead of relying on other traditional and less sweeping ways of correcting acts of Congress. In his view, &quot;the Court&#x27;s decision sent a clear message of finality for any future use of the line item veto&quot;. Kennedy also noted that while the majority relied on a strict interpretation or literal textual reading of the Presentment Clause contained in Article I of the United States Constitution, Justice Scalia, in his dissent, &quot;stray[ed] somewhat from his usual strict constructionist approach ... by stressing that the President&#x27;s act of cancellation would only occur after satisfaction of the Presentment Clause&quot;.

Steven F. Huefner wrote that &quot;Although the Presentment Clause analysis of the Line Item Veto Act has superficial appeal, it ultimately does not withstand scrutiny&quot;, arguing that the Court should have relied on the nondelegation doctrine in order to invalidate the Act, as it provided a superior basis for such a decision. Huefner named two main implications of the Court&#x27;s refusal to use the nondelegation doctrine. First, it suggests that the Court seems unready or unwilling to alter the existing interpretation of the nondelegation doctrine. Second, the Court has shown that it is willing to rely upon alternative rationales to achieve the same result &quot;as would a more robust nondelegation doctrine rationale&quot;. This approach is significant because in theory, such a rationale could endanger previously accepted delegations to the executive.

Roy E. Brownell II criticized the Clinton administration for its exercise of the Line Item Veto Act, charging that it should have restricted its cancellation powers only to statutory provisions that remain in the realm of national security. He argued that had the Clinton administration limited its use of the Line Item Veto Act in this fashion, it would have ensured that when the constitutionality of the Act was inevitably challenged, the challenge would have been based on terms most favorable to the Executive. Brownell suggested that a test case brought forth on the grounds of national security would have likely acknowledged the existence of &quot;National Security Rescission&quot;, &quot;a narrow statutory construction limiting the area of presidential cancellation power to within the field of national security. Such a result ... would have assured that the President maintained cancellation authority over a sixth of the federal budget.&quot;

Steven G. Calabresi argued that although the Court had denied this, the instant decision was really a &quot;Nondelegation doctrine case masquerading as a bicameralism and presentment case&quot;. He also suggested that this decision was &quot;the blockbuster separation of powers case of the Rehnquist years&quot;.

==Subsequent developments==
Though the Supreme Court struck down the Line Item Veto Act in 1998, President George W. Bush asked Congress to enact legislation that would return the line item veto power to the Executive. First announcing his intent to seek such legislation in his January 31, 2006 State of the Union address, President Bush sent a legislative proposal Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 to Congress on March 6, 2006, urging its prompt passage. Senator Bill Frist, Senator John McCain, and Republican Whip Senator Mitch McConnell jointly introduced this proposal.

On that same day, Joshua Bolten, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, gave a press conference on the president&#x27;s line-item veto proposal. Bolten explained that the proposed Act would give the President the ability to single out &quot;wasteful&quot; spending and to put such spending on hold. While the spending line-item is on hold, the President can send legislation to Congress to rescind the particular line-item. The proposal would then be considered in both houses within ten days on an up or down basis, and could be passed by a simple majority. Additionally, such proposals could not be filibustered.

When asked how this proposed legislation was different from the 1996 Line Item Veto Act that was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending line items, the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such line-item vetoes. Thus, in order for the President to successfully rescind previously enacted spending, a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect.

Though the newer line-item veto proposal was much weaker than the 1996 version, it nevertheless failed to find strong support in Congress. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia called it &quot;an offensive slap at Congress&quot;, asserting that the legislation would enable the president to intimidate individual members of Congress by targeting the projects of his political opponents. He also complained that the line-item veto as proposed would take away Congress&#x27; constitutional &quot;power of the purse&quot; and give it to the executive branch.

On June 8, 2006, Viet D. Dinh, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, and Nathan Sales, John M. Olin Fellow at Georgetown University Law Center testified by written statement before the House Committee on the Budget on the constitutional issues in connection with the proposed legislation. Dinh and Sales argued that the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 satisfies the Constitution&#x27;s Bicameralism and Presentment Clause, and therefore avoids the constitutional issues raised in the 1996 Act struck down by the Supreme Court. They also stated that the proposed Act is consistent with the basic principle that grants Congress broad discretion to establish procedures to govern its internal operations.

The proposed Act was approved by the House Budget Committee on June 14, 2006, by a vote of 24–9. It was approved in the full House on June 22. A similar bill was submitted in the Senate, but failed to win approval. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act has therefore not become law.

<text>Laugardalsvöllur (, or more precisely &#x27;Laugardalur Stadium&#x27;) is Iceland&#x27;s national football stadium and the home venue for the Iceland national football team located in Reykjavík. It has a seating capacity of 9,500 and about 28,321 for concerts.

==History==

The idea of building a sporting venue in Laugardalur, along with some other entertainment facilities, dates back to 1871. At that time, the population of Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland, was only about 2,000. Laugardalur was also nearly 3 km (1.9 mi) away from residential areas. Little came out of this proposal for the next 60 years or so.

In 1943, the town council set up the Laugardalsnefnd committee. Its task was to make proposals and ideas for the area. The committee then delivered the result later, which included building a new football stadium and a new swimming pool.

Construction of the field started in 1949 and lasted until 1952. A year later in 1953, construction of a new stand started. The stand had a capacity of 4,000 when completed.

The first match was played on Laugardalsvöllur in 1957 when the Iceland men&#x27;s national football team played against Norway, two years before the official opening on 17 June 1959. A few years later, the stand was renovated and expanded, starting from 1965 to 1970.

Under the new stand there was opened a track-and-field facility, which operated until 2007, although there has always been all-weather running track around the pitch (upgraded in 1992). Later the year 1992, floodlights were inaugurated for the match against Greece.

In 1997, another new stand was built against the old stand, across the pitch. Constructions started a year earlier. It has a capacity of 3,500. At the same time, the old stand was relieved by matching it with the new stand by seating capacity.

Big renovation and expansion of the old stand started in 2005. After the completion in 2007, the stadium has a capacity of 9,800. Additional capacity can be added by bringing in two temporary stands seating 1,500 each, giving the stadium a maximum capacity of 12,800 but after the new requirements of FIFA for national football stadiums, this addition method has been forbidden. No major renovations or expansions have occurred since 2007.

The largest attendance for a football match ever seen at Laugardalsvöllur was 20,204 in 2004 in a friendly match between Iceland and Italy. The largest attendance for the venue about 25,000 during a concert in 2007. On 24 July 2018, American rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses played at the stadium in front of 25,000 people, at that time the largest rock concert ever held in Iceland.

In 2024, renovations began in order to install hybrid grass and a heating system underneath the field.

== Facilities ==
The stadium comprises two big stands facing each other. West Stand is the main stand and the larger one. It is the only stand to hold all the facilities needed for the stadium, excluding stadium seating. For the purpose of football matches and other competitions, the stand has 4 changing rooms for players (mainly) and 2 others for referees, which also have the capability of accommodating facility for a doctor or drug test. There are two other rooms for football matches and athletics tournaments administration.

== Future ==
There have been plans by KSÍ (the Football Association of Iceland) to renovate and expand Laugardalsvöllur since 2014, one year after the Iceland men&#x27;s national football team reached the play-offs for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in 2013. The team&#x27;s success kept going until they went to UEFA Euro 2016 and reached the quarter-finals. Both Icelandic football fans and KSÍ have been asking Reykjavík city, the current owner of the stadium, for a new stadium because seats have sold out for 7 out of 10 national football team matches in 2013–2015. Despite the attendance, Laugardalsvöllur had a deficit of 3.9 million ISK in 2015, but Reykjavík city then added its contribution of 11 million ISK, leaving a 7 million ISK profit.

Two options are being considered and both include removing the running track and placing stands in its place in addition to moving the pitch closer to the west stand and keeping the west stand in place. One option is a 17,500 capacity stadium with an open roof and heated pitch, costing 7-11 billion ISK. The second option is a 20,000 capacity stadium with a retractable roof over the stadium for the possibility of multi-purpose stadium, that would increase the utilization of seating capacity in the long term. The second option would cost 11-18 billion ISK.

Having a heated pitch is necessary, due to cold and snowy winters in Iceland and also because of the new requirements of UEFA, which indicates that matches for some teams in the qualification competition, for the UEFA European Championship, shall also be played in the winter. The grass would then be maintained itself with an automatic irrigation sprinkler system.

In 2024, a memorandum of understanding was signed to only develop the venue as a soccer-specific stadium in the future. With the removal of the running track and other athletics equipment, athletics would move to a dedicated area.

<doc id="752068" wikidata="Q268078" url="?curid=752068" title="The Runaway Jury">
<text>The Runaway Jury is a legal thriller novel written by American author John Grisham. It was Grisham&#x27;s seventh novel. The hardcover first edition was published by Doubleday Books in 1996 (). Pearson Longman released the graded reader edition in 2001 (). The novel was published again in 2003 to coincide with the release of &quot;Runaway Jury&quot;, a movie adaptation of the novel starring Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman, John Cusack and Rachel Weisz. The third printing () bears a movie-themed cover, in place of the covers used on the first and second printings.

==Plot==
Wendall Rohr and his team of tort lawyers have filed suit on behalf of plaintiff Celeste Wood, whose husband died of lung cancer, against the tobacco company Pynex. The trial is to be held in Biloxi, Mississippi, a state thought to have favorable tort laws and sympathetic juries. Before the jury in the Pynex trial has been sworn in, a stealth juror, Nicholas Easter, has successfully gotten himself added to the jury, in concert with a mysterious woman known only as Marlee.

Rankin Fitch, a shady &quot;consultant&quot; who has directed eight successful trials for the tobacco industry, has placed a camera in the courtroom in order to observe the proceedings in his office nearby, where he and his team analyze the jury and plan to manipulate them. He plans to get to Millie Dupree through blackmailing her husband through a tape that has him trying to bribe an official. He gets to Lonnie Shaver by convincing a company to buy his employer and convince him through orientation. He also tries to reach Rikki Coleman through blackmail of revealing her abortion to her husband. As the case continues, Fitch is approached by Marlee with a proposal to &quot;buy&quot; the verdict.

Meanwhile, Easter works from the inside to gain control of the jury – being warm-hearted, sympathetic and helpful to jurors who might be won over, and rather ruthless to those who prove impervious to his efforts. Eventually, he becomes jury foreman after the previous one falls ill (resulting from Nicholas spiking his coffee). He also manages to hoodwink and repeatedly manipulate the judge. Meanwhile, Marlee Easter&#x27;s partner/lover acts as his agent on the outside, convincing Fitch that Easter controls the jury and can deliver any verdict on demand through a series of highly secretive meetings, in which Marlee repeatedly threatens to disappear if Fitch&#x27;s team attempts to track her.

Marlee gives Fitch the impression that the pair&#x27;s objective is purely mercenary – to sell the verdict to highest bidder. Still, he makes a great effort to discover her true name and antecedents to satisfy his mounting curiosity. This turns out to be extremely difficult, and the detectives employed by Fitch express their grudging respect for her skill in hiding her tracks. As the trial reaches its climax, Fitch – still in the dark about Marlee&#x27;s past – agrees to her proposal to pay $10 million for a favorable verdict. Only after the money is irrevocably transferred to an offshore account do the detectives discover the truth: Marlee is in fact an anti-smoking activist whose parents both died from tobacco use. Thus, Fitch realizes that he lost Pynex&#x27;s $10 million in addition to having lost the trial.

Inside the closed jury room, Easter convinces the jury to find for the plaintiff and make a large monetary award – $2 million in compensatory damages, and $400 million in punitive damages. While not able to sway the entire jury, Easter gets nine out of twelve jurors to back him – sufficient for a valid verdict in a civil case. Pynex and its defense lawyers are devastated. In the Cayman Islands, Marlee short-sells the tobacco companies&#x27; stocks and makes an enormous gain on the original $10 million. Easter quickly disappears from Biloxi and leaves the US. While Easter and Marlee are now wealthy and satisfied that they served justice, the tobacco industry, once undefeatable, is now vulnerable to an avalanche of additional lawsuits.

The book closes with Marlee returning the initial $10 million bribe to Fitch, having almost doubled the money on the derivatives market, and warning Fitch that she and Easter will always be watching. She explains that she had no intention to steal or lie, and that she cheated only because, &quot;That was all your client understood.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The story&#x27;s suspense builds like that of a lengthening cigarette ash that refuses to drop off. And the plot&#x27;s eventual outcome is far more entertainingly unpredictable than anything Mr. Grisham has done before.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;the guts of the book is the cat-and-mouse game played by Marlee, Easter and Fitch, and it is probably Grisham&#x27;s best storytelling to date.&quot;

<doc id="752069" wikidata="Q2910887" url="?curid=752069" title="Vietnam Women's Memorial">
<text>The Vietnam Women&#x27;s Memorial is a memorial dedicated to the nurses and women of the United States who served in the Vietnam War. It depicts three uniformed women with a wounded male soldier to symbolize the support and caregiving roles that women played in the war as nurses and other specialists. It is part of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and is located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., a short distance south of the Wall and north of the Reflecting Pool. The statues are bronze and the base is made of granite. The United States Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission selected Glenna Goodacre to sculpt the memorial after previously rejecting the idea for a memorial to women.

Diane Carlson Evans, a former U.S. Army nurse, co-founded the Vietnam Women&#x27;s Memorial Foundation (VWMF) in 1984 with two other veterans. It took years of lobbying and attending dozens of meetings for the memorial to finally be approved. With assistance from members of Congress, VWMF was granted permission in 1988 to erect the memorial, as long as the necessary funds were raised. At the dedication on Veterans Day in 1993, Vice President Al Gore and other dignitaries were in attendance, along with approximately 25,000 onlookers. Since then, there have been numerous anniversary gatherings at the memorial.

==History==
===Memorial plans===
In 1982, Diane Carlson Evans, who served as a U.S. Army nurse during the Vietnam War, attended the dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Noting the memorial&#x27;s focus on men who served during the war, she wanted to also memorialize the more than 11,500 American women who served as nurses and in other roles. Two years later, she and two other veterans, attorney Donna-Marie Boulay and Gerald C. Bender, formed the Vietnam Women&#x27;s Memorial Foundation (VWMF), whose goal was to erect a memorial to the women who assisted in the war. In addition to the memorial, the group&#x27;s other goals was locating all women veterans of the war, and educating the public about their sacrifices.

Their idea was repeatedly turned down for the next several years. The women were mocked and received death threats. According to Evans, she discovered how much misogyny they would have to overcome to meet their goal. One person told Evans that if women were to be memorialized, so would the Canine Corps. Television journalist Morley Safer from &quot;60 Minutes&quot; heard about the reference to dogs and invited several women who had served in Vietnam to be interviewed. The response was positive, and some male veterans began offering their services to assist the project&#x27;s approval. Evans attended over 35 meetings with bureaucrats to seek approval for the monument.

In 1987, the United States Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) overwhelmingly rejected the proposal, despite a letter of support from Secretary of the Interior Donald P. Hodel. Members of the VWMF were angry with the decision, citing it as proof only men were apparently worthy of being honored for their service. In addition to the CFA, the memorial would have to be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC). The CFA&#x27;s reasons for denying the project was because, in their view, the memorial was already complete and the &quot;Three Soldiers&quot; statue represented all who served. Veteran Jill A. Mishkel, who worked on the Connecticut governor&#x27;s Task Force on Women Veterans, said &quot;To the majority of Americans, the word &#x27;veteran&#x27; implies &#x27;male.&#x27; The statue of three men representing women&#x27;s contributions is ludicrous. It&#x27;s an insult that the commission even suggested recognizing us with a plaque on a park bench.&quot; Maya Lin, who had designed the Wall, opposed the women&#x27;s memorial, giving credence to other opponents of the plan. According to Lin, &quot;In allowing this addition you substantiate the assumption that our national monuments can be tampered with by private interest groups years after the monuments have undergone the proper legal and aesthetic approval processes.&quot;

In response to the CFA&#x27;s rejection, U.S. senators David Durenberger and Alan Cranston sponsored a bill to erect the memorial. They were joined by U.S. House Representative Sam Gejdenson in sponsoring a House version of the bill. Durenberger said Public Law 96-297, signed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter, authorized a memorial in Constitution Gardens to both men and women who served in Vietnam. The design that was sponsored in the bill was of a lone woman nurse in uniform. This design, by Rodger M. Brodin, was criticized as it was too plain and only represented an officer. After years of lobbying and with the help of the aforementioned politicians, the VWMF succeeded in getting the U.S. Senate to approve a &quot;woman&#x27;s statue&quot; on June 15, 1988, that would be installed in Arlington National Cemetery instead of the Constitution Gardens.

The bill was signed by President Ronald Reagan in November 1988. In a statement from the White House, Reagan said the statue would be installed somewhere in the 2.2-acre (0.9 ha) area where the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and &quot;Three Soldiers&quot; are located. The bill recognized the Commemorative Works Act, which states the CFA and NCPC must approve new memorials in the city. The CFA and NCPC approved the plan the following year, and chose a site south of the Wall for the memorial. By 1990, the VWMF had raised almost half of its goal of $3.5 million. A competition for a new design began in August of that year, with the winner receiving $20,000. 

There were 317 entries for the design. The sculptor chosen was Eileen Barry, who submitted a design of a bronze woman facing the Wall. Also included in the winning design was a water feature and bronze relief. The design then headed back to the CFA and NCPC for final approval. Those groups could not agree on the design, so the eventual winner was Glenna Goodacre, selected in November 1991. It was announced the dedication would be in 1993, as long as the VWMF raised the remaining funds, which they eventually did. The person chosen to design the landscape was architect George Dickie, and the Art Castings of Colorado founded the memorial. Before the memorial was dedicated, organizers took the sculpture on a tour across the U.S.

===Dedication===

On Veterans Day, 1993, around 25,000 people gathered to attend the memorial&#x27;s dedication, including Vice President Al Gore, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff William J. Crowe, and several other military leaders. Many in attendance were veterans who shared their stories of Vietnam and reunited with women they served with during the war. One woman in attendance, whose son was killed in Vietnam, said &quot;They took care of our kids... Maybe somebody here today took care of my boy before he died.&quot;

A Marine in attendance, who had lost both legs during battle in Vietnam, was upset the memorial was installed 300 feet (91 m) south of the Wall, insisting it should be closer &quot;because these women were the last people those guys saw or talked to before they died.&quot; In addition to the dedication ceremony, there were many other events marking the occasion. Two such events were a women&#x27;s march down Constitution Avenue, which was met with cheers from male veterans, and a visit to Arlington National Cemetery, where a wreath was laid at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. According to the United States Department of Defense, the women&#x27;s memorial &quot;was the first in the nation&#x27;s capital to exclusively recognize the patriotic service of [American] women, both military and civilian.&quot; The memorial is owned and maintained by the National Park Service.

===Later history===
Since its installation, the memorial has been the site of annual gatherings to mark its anniversary. Around the time of the 20th anniversary in 2013, Evans and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund wanted an underground education center that would cover not just the women&#x27;s memorial, but the &quot;Three Soldiers&quot; and the Wall as well. The plan to build the education center, called The Education Center at The Wall, was cancelled in 2018 due to a lack of funding. At the 25th anniversary in 2018, there was a candlelight remembrance ceremony, a storytelling program for children, and multiple speakers. During the 30-year anniversary in 2023, another candlelight ceremony took place at the memorial, and the keynote address was given by Evans.

==Location and design==

The memorial is sited near the Wall and the &quot;Three Soldiers&quot; statue at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The three groupings of the memorial are in Constitution Gardens, a park on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The Lincoln Memorial lies to the southwest, the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool to the south, and Constitution Avenue to the north. Landscape architect George Dickie chose the site of the Vietnam Women&#x27;s Memorial based on three important factors: a location where the Wall was visible from the Memorial; accessibility to the Memorial; and a good fit and addition to the existing park layout and Constitution Gardens.

The memorial is composed of four bronze statues resting on a granite base. The sculpture is approximately 6.7-feet (2 m) tall, 7.9-feet (2.4 m) wide, and 5.8-feet (1.8 m) long. The base is 8-inches (20.3 cm) tall and the diameter is around 9.7-feet (3 m). Inscriptions on the sculpture include &quot;Glenna Goodacre Sculptor/(copyright symbol)&quot;, &quot;1993 Vietnam Women&#x27;s Memorial Project, Inc.&quot;, and the foundry&#x27;s mark. Three of the statues are women nurses in uniform assisting a wounded soldier. One of the women is sitting on sandbags, holding the soldier. Another is holding the soldier&#x27;s helmet while kneeling. The third woman is African American and is standing while looking up towards the sky. The surrounding landscape includes eight yellowwood trees that represent the eight American servicewomen who died during the Vietnam War: Eleanor Grace Alexander, Pamela Dorothy Donovan, Carol Ann Drazba, Annie Ruth Graham, Elizabeth Ann Jones, Mary Therese Klinker, Sharon Ann Lane, and Hedwig Diane Orlowski. The only servicewoman killed in action was First Lieutenant Sharon Lane; the rest died of accidents and illness.

The memorial has been criticized for historical inaccuracy as &quot;it depicts nurses giving medical care on the field of battle, such care was only given by U.S. Army medics and U.S. Navy corpsmen, with nurses working exclusively in military hospitals.&quot;

<doc id="752072" wikidata="Q2519710" url="?curid=752072" title="History of the United States (1849–1865)">
<text>The history of the United States from 1849 to 1865 was dominated by the tensions that led to the American Civil War between North and South, and the bloody fighting in 1861–1865 that produced Northern victory in the war and ended slavery. At the same time industrialization and the transportation revolution changed the economics of the Northern United States and the Western United States. Heavy immigration from Western Europe shifted the center of population further to the North.

Industrialization went forward in the Northeast, from Pennsylvania to New England. A rail network and a telegraph network linked the nation economically, opening up new markets. Immigration brought millions of European workers and farmers to the Northern United States. In the Southern United States, planters shifted operations (and slaves) from the poor soils of the Southeastern United States to the rich cotton lands of the Southwestern United States.

Issues of slavery in the new territories acquired in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848) were temporarily resolved by the Compromise of 1850. One provision, the Fugitive Slave Law, sparked intense controversy, as revealed in the enormous interest in the plight of the escaped slave in &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin,&quot; an 1852 anti-slavery novel and play.

In 1854, the Kansas–Nebraska Act reversed long-standing compromises by providing that each new state of the Union would decide its posture on slavery (popular sovereignty). The newly formed Republican Party stood against the expansion of slavery and won control of most Northern states (with enough electoral votes to win the presidency in 1860). The invasion of Kansas by sponsored pro- and anti-slavery factions intent on voting slavery up or down, with resulting bloodshed (Bloody Kansas), angered both North and South. The Supreme Court tried unsuccessfully to resolve the issue of slavery in the territories with a pro-slavery ruling, in &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;, that angered the North.

After the 1860 election of Republican Abraham Lincoln, seven Southern states declared their secession from the United States between late 1860 and 1861, establishing a rebel government, the Confederate States of America on February 9, 1861. The Civil War began when Confederate General Pierre Beauregard opened fire upon Union troops at Fort Sumter in South Carolina. Four more states seceded as Lincoln called for troops to fight an insurrection.

The next four years were the darkest in American history as the nation tore at itself using the latest military technology and highly motivated soldiers. The urban, industrialized Northern states (the Union) eventually defeated the mainly rural, agricultural Southern states (the Confederacy), but between 600,000 and 700,000 American soldiers (on both sides combined) were killed, and much of the infrastructure of the South was devastated. About 8% of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% in the North and an extraordinary 18% in the South. In the end, slavery was abolished, and the Union was restored, richer and more powerful than ever, while the South was embittered and impoverished.

==Economic and cultural changes==
===Developing a market economy===
By the 1840s, the Industrial Revolution was transforming the Northeast, with a dense network of railroads, canals, textile mills, small industrial cities, and growing commercial centers, with hubs in Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia. Although manufacturing interests, especially in Pennsylvania, sought a high tariff, the actual tariff in effect was low, and was reduced several times, with the 1857 tariff the lowest in decades. The Midwest region, based on farming and increasingly on animal production, was growing rapidly, using the railroads and river systems to ship food to slave plantations in the south, industrial cities in the East, and industrial cities in Britain and Europe.

In the south, the cotton plantations were flourishing, thanks to the very high price of cotton on the world market. Cotton production wears out the land, and so the center of gravity was continually moving west. The annexation of Texas in 1845 opened up the last great cotton lands. Meanwhile, other commodities, such as tobacco in Virginia and North Carolina, were in the doldrums. Slavery was dying out in the upper South, and survived because of sales of slaves to the growing cotton plantations in the Southwest. While the Northeast was rapidly urbanizing, and urban centers such as Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Chicago were rapidly growing in the Midwest, the South remained overwhelmingly rural. The great wealth generated by slavery was used to buy new lands, and more slaves. At all times the great majority of Southern whites owned no slaves, and operated farms on a subsistence basis, serving small local markets.

A transportation revolution was underway thanks to heavy infusions of capital from London, Paris, Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Hundreds of local short haul lines were being consolidated to form a railroad system, that could handle long-distance shipment of farm and industrial products, as well as passengers. In the South, there were few systems, and most railroad lines were short haul project designed to move cotton to the nearest river or ocean port. Meanwhile, steamboats provided a good transportation system on the inland rivers.

With the use of interchangeable parts popularized by Eli Whitney, the factory system began in which workers assembled at one location to produce goods. The early textile factories such as the Lowell mills employed mainly women, but generally factories were a male domain.

By 1860, 16% of Americans lived in cities with 2500 or more people; a third of the nation&#x27;s income came from manufacturing. Urbanized industry was limited primarily to the Northeast; cotton cloth production was the leading industry, with the manufacture of shoes, woolen clothing, and machinery also expanding. Energy was provided in most cases by water power from the rivers, but steam engines were being introduced to factories as well. By 1860, the railroads had made a transition from use of local wood supplies to coal for their locomotives. Pennsylvania became the center of the coal industry. Many, if not most, of the factory workers and miners were recent immigrants from Europe, or their children. Throughout the North, and in southern cities, entrepreneurs were setting up factories, mines, mills, banks, stores, and other business operations. In the great majority of cases, these were relatively small, locally owned, and locally operated enterprises.

===Immigration and labor===
To fill the new factory jobs, immigrants poured into the United States in the first mass wave of immigration in the 1840s and 1850s. Known as the period of old immigration, this time saw 4.2 million immigrants come into the United States raising the overall population to over 20 million people. Historians often describe this as a time of &quot;push-pull&quot; immigration. People who were &quot;pushed&quot; to the United States immigrated because of poor conditions back home that made survival dubious while immigrants who were &quot;pulled&quot; came from stable environments to find greater economic success. One group who was &quot;pushed&quot; to the United States was the Irish, who were attempting to escape the Great Famine in their nation. Settling around the coastal cities of Boston, Massachusetts and New York City, the Irish were not initially welcomed because of their poverty and Roman Catholic beliefs. They lived in crowded, filthy neighborhoods and performed low-paying and physically demanding jobs. The Catholic Church was widely distrusted by many Americans as a symbol of European autocracy. German immigration, on the other hand, was &quot;pulled&quot; to America to avoid a looming financial disaster in their nation. Unlike the Irish, the German immigrants often sold their possessions and arrived in America with money in hand. German immigrants were both Protestant and Catholic, although the latter did not face the discrimination that the Irish did. Many Germans settled in communities in the Midwest rather than on the coast. Major cities such as Cincinnati, Ohio and St. Louis, Missouri developed large German populations. Unlike the Irish, most German immigrants were educated, middle-class people who mainly came to America for political rather than economic reasons. In the big cities such as New York, immigrants often lived in ethnic enclaves called &quot;ghettos&quot; that were often impoverished and crime-ridden. The most infamous of these immigrant neighborhoods was the Five Points in New York City. With increasing labor agitation for higher wages and better working conditions, such as by the Lowell mill girls in Massachusetts, many factory owners began to replace female workers with immigrants who would work cheaper and were less demanding about factory conditions.

==Political upheaval==
===Wilmot Proviso===

In 1848 the acquisition of new territory from Mexico through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo renewed the sectional debate over slavery. The question of whether the new territory would allow slavery was the main question, with Northern Congressmen hoping to limit slavery and Southern Congressmen hoping to expand the territory in which it was legal. Soon after the Mexican–American War began, Democratic Congressman David Wilmot proposed that territory won from Mexico should be free from the institution of slavery. Called the Wilmot Proviso, the measure failed to pass Congress and thus never became law. This served to unify the majority of Southerners, who saw the Proviso as an attack on their society and their constitutional rights.

===Popular sovereignty debate===
With the failure of the Wilmot Proviso, Senator Lewis Cass introduced the idea of popular sovereignty in Congress. In an attempt to hold the Congress together as it continued to divide along sectional rather than party lines, Cass proposed that Congress did not have the power to determine whether territories could allow slavery, since this was not an enumerated power listed in the Constitution. Instead, Cass proposed that the people living in the territories themselves should decide the slavery issue. For the Democrats, the solution was not as clear as it appeared. Northern Democrats called for &quot;squatter sovereignty&quot;, in which the people living in the territory could decide the issue when a territorial legislature was convened. Southern Democrats disputed this idea, arguing that the issue of slavery must be decided at the time of adoption of a state constitution, when the request was made to Congress for admission as a state. Cass and other Democratic leaders failed to clarify the issue so that neither section of the country felt slighted as the election approached. After Cass&#x27; defeat in 1848, Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas assumed a leading role in the party and became closely associated with popular sovereignty with his proposal of the Kansas–Nebraska Act.

===California gold rush===
The election of 1848 produced a new president from the Whig Party, Zachary Taylor. James K. Polk did not seek reelection because he achieved all his objectives in his first term and because his health was declining. From the election emerged the Free Soil Party, a group of anti-slavery Democrats who supported Wilmot&#x27;s Proviso. The creation of the Free Soil Party foreshadowed the collapse of the Second Party System; the existing parties could not contain the debate over slavery for much longer.

The question of slavery became all the more urgent with the discovery of gold in California in 1848. The next year, there was a massive influx of prospectors and miners looking to strike it rich. Most migrants to California (so-called &#x27;Forty-Niners&#x27;) abandoned their jobs, homes, and families looking for gold. This huge migration of white settlers to the Pacific coast led to confrontations with Native populations, including the ethnic cleansing of thousands of Native inhabitants. Some historians (and a state governor) have referred to this period lasting into the early 1870s as the California genocide.

It also attracted some of the first Chinese Americans to the West Coast of the United States. Most Forty-Niners never found gold but instead settled in the urban center of San Francisco or in the new municipality of Sacramento.

===Compromise of 1850===
The influx of population led to California&#x27;s application for statehood in 1850. This created a renewal of sectional tension because California&#x27;s admission into the Union threatened to upset the balance of power in Congress. The imminent admission of Oregon, New Mexico, and Utah also threatened to upset the balance. Many Southerners also realized that the climate of those territories did not lend themselves to the extension of slavery (it was not yet foreseen that the Central Valley in California would someday become a center of cotton farming). Debate raged in Congress until a resolution was found in 1850.

President Taylor threatened to personally command an army against any Southern state that would secede from the Union, and he also threatened force against Texas, which laid claim to the eastern half of New Mexico. However, Taylor died of an intestinal ailment in July 1850, and his successor, Vice President Millard Fillmore, was a lawyer by training and far less war-like.

The Compromise of 1850 was proposed by &quot;The Great Compromiser,&quot; Henry Clay and was passed by Senator Stephen A. Douglas. Through the compromise, California was admitted as a free state, Texas was financially compensated for the loss of its Western territories, the slave trade (not slavery) was abolished in the District of Columbia, the Fugitive Slave Law was passed as a concession to the South, and, most importantly, the New Mexico Territory (including modern day Arizona and the Utah Territory) would determine its status (either free or slave) by popular vote. A group of Southern extremists, still not satisfied with the compromise, held two conventions in Nashville, Tennessee calling for secession, one during the summer of 1850 and the other late in the year, but by that point the Compromise had already passed through Congress and been accepted by the Southern states.

The Compromise of 1850 temporarily defused the divisive issue, but the peace was not to last long.

===Presidential election of 1852===

Having lost two presidential elections to Whig war heroes, the Democratic Party tried their own by nominating Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire, who had served without great distinction in the Mexican War. Endorsed by Southern Democrats, Pierce openly supported the Compromise and the Fugitive Slave Act. The Whigs rejected the idea of running incumbent President Fillmore, and so instead turned to another war hero in General Winfield Scott. Although a capable man, Scott&#x27;s haughty personality alienated many voters and Pierce won an easy victory at the ballot box.

===Foreign affairs===
The acquisition of the Southwest had made the United States a Pacific power. Diplomatic and commercial ties with China had been first established in 1844, and American merchants and shippers began urging an opening of ties with Japan, a country that had virtually isolated itself from the outside world for the past 300 years. In 1853, a fleet commanded by Commodore Matthew C. Perry arrived in Japan and forced the shogunate to sign a treaty with US, although Japanese fears of Russian encroachment also moved matters along.

Closer to home, Cuba was long coveted by Southerners as the choicest slave territory available. If annexed by the US and split into 3–4 states, it would restore the slave versus free state balance in Congress. President Polk had in 1845 offered the island&#x27;s owner, Spain, $100 million for the island, but it was refused and Madrid made it clear that they would not part with the island under any circumstance. Southerners were not about to give up their designs on Cuba, and several filibustering expeditions were mounted. They were easily repulsed by the Spanish authorities, and the last attempt ended in fifty Americans being captured and executed for piracy, including many men from the leading families of the South. A group of enraged Southerners responded by ransacking the Spanish consulate in New Orleans.

In 1854, the Spanish authorities captured the steamer &quot;Black Warrior&quot; on a technicality. War appeared to threaten, and Southerners in Congress were aggressively pushing President Pierce for it. Since the European powers were distracted with the Crimean War, there was also nobody that could come to Madrid&#x27;s assistance. Meanwhile, the US ambassadors to Spain, Britain, and France met in secret in Ostend, Belgium where they proposed a &quot;battle plan&quot; that involved offering Spain up to $120 million for Cuba. If Madrid still refused, then US was justified in taking the island by force. However, the Ostend Manifesto soon leaked out, and an outcry from free soil Northerners forced the Pierce Administration to give up its ambitions on Cuba. Coincidentally, just as Southerners had their eye on territories in the Caribbean, Northerners in the 1850s also developed renewed designs on Canada. In the end, both sides stalemated each other and got nothing as a result.

===Antislavery and abolitionism===
The debate over slavery in the pre-Civil War United States has several sides. Abolitionists grew directly out of the Second Great Awakening and the European Enlightenment and saw slavery as an affront to God and/or reason. Abolitionism had roots similar to the temperance movement. The publishing of Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, in 1852, galvanized the abolitionist movement.

Most debates over slavery, however, had to do with the constitutionality of the extension of slavery rather than its morality. The debates took the form of arguments over the powers of Congress rather than the merits of slavery. The result was the so-called &quot;Free Soil Movement.&quot; Free-soilers believed that slavery was dangerous because of what it did to whites. The &quot;peculiar institution&quot; ensured that elites controlled most of the land, property, and capital in the South. The Southern United States was, by this definition, undemocratic. To fight the &quot;slave power conspiracy,&quot; the nation&#x27;s democratic ideals had to be spread to the new territories and the South.

In the South, however, slavery was justified in many ways. The Nat Turner Uprising of 1831 had terrified Southern whites. Moreover, the expansion of &quot;King Cotton&quot; into the Deep South further entrenched the institution into Southern society. John Calhoun&#x27;s treatise, &quot;The Pro-Slavery Argument&quot;, stated that slavery was not simply a necessary evil but a positive good. Slavery was a blessing to so-called African savages. It civilized them and provided them with the lifelong security that they needed. Under this argument, the pro-slavery proponents believed that the African Americans were unable to take care of themselves because they were biologically inferior. Furthermore, white Southerners looked upon the North and Britain as soulless industrial societies with little culture. Whereas the North was dirty, dangerous, industrial, fast-paced, and greedy, pro-slavery proponents believed that the South was civilized, stable, orderly, and moved at a &#x27;human pace.&#x27;

According to the 1860 U.S. census, fewer than 385,000 individuals (i.e. 1.4% of whites in the country, or 4.8% of southern whites) owned one or more slaves. 95% of blacks lived in the South, comprising one-third of the population there as opposed to 1% of the population of the North.

===Kansas–Nebraska Act===
With the admission of California as a state in 1850, the Pacific Coast had finally been reached. Manifest Destiny had brought Americans to the end of the continent. President Millard Fillmore hoped to continue Manifest Destiny, and with this aim he sent Commodore Matthew Perry to Japan in the hopes of arranging trade agreements in 1853.

A railroad to the Pacific was planned, and Senator Stephen A. Douglas wanted the transcontinental railway to pass through Chicago. Southerners protested, insisting that it run through Texas, Southern California and end in New Orleans. Douglas decided to compromise and introduced the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854. In exchange for having the railway run through Chicago, he proposed &#x27;organizing&#x27; (open for white settlement) the territories of Kansas and Nebraska.

Douglas anticipated Southern opposition to the act and added in a provision that stated that the status of the new territories would be subject to popular sovereignty. In theory, the new states could become slave states under this condition. Under Southern pressure, Douglas added a clause which explicitly repealed the Missouri Compromise. President Franklin Pierce supported the bill as did the South and a fraction of northern Democrats.

The act split the Whigs. Northern Whigs generally opposed the Kansas–Nebraska Act while Southern Whigs supported it. Most Northern Whigs joined the new Republican Party. Some joined the Know-Nothing Party which refused to take a stance on slavery. The southern Whigs tried different political moves, but could not reverse the regional dominance of the Democratic Party.

===Bleeding Kansas===

With the opening of Kansas, both pro- and anti-slavery supporters rushed to settle in the new territory. Violent clashes soon erupted between them. Abolitionists from New England settled in Topeka, Lawrence, and Manhattan. Pro-slavery advocates, mainly from Missouri, settled in Leavenworth and Lecompton.

In 1855, elections were held for the territorial legislature. While there were only 1,500 legal voters, migrants from Missouri swelled the population to over 6,000. The result was that a pro-slavery majority was elected to the legislature. Free-soilers were so outraged that they set up their own delegates in Topeka. A group of pro-slavery Missourians sacked Lawrence on May 21, 1856. Violence continued for two more years until the promulgation of the Lecompton Constitution.

The violence, known as &quot;Bleeding Kansas,&quot; scandalized the Democratic administration and began a more heated sectional conflict. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts gave a speech in the Senate entitled &quot;The Crime Against Kansas.&quot; The speech was a scathing criticism of the South and the &quot;peculiar institution.&quot; As an example of rising sectional tensions, days after delivering the speech, South Carolina Representative Preston Brooks approached Sumner during a recess of the Senate and caned him.

===The new Republican Party===
The new Republican party emerged in 1854–1856 in the North; it had minimal support in the South. Most members were former Whigs or Free Soil Democrats. The Party was ideological, with a focus on stopping the spread of slavery, and modernizing the economy through tariffs, banks, railroads and free homestead land for farmers.

Without using the term &quot;containment&quot;, the new Party in the mid-1850s proposed a system of containing slavery, once it gained control of the national government. Historian James Oakes explains the strategy:
:&quot;The federal government would surround the south with free states, free territories, and free waters, building what they called a &#x27;cordon of freedom&#x27; around slavery, hemming it in until the system&#x27;s own internal weaknesses forced the slave states one by one to abandon slavery.&quot;

===Presidential election of 1856===

President Pierce was too closely associated with the horrors of &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot; and was not renominated. Instead, the Democrats nominated former Secretary of State and current ambassador to Great Britain James Buchanan, The Know Nothing Party nominated former President Millard Fillmore, who campaigned on a platform that mainly opposed immigration and urban corruption of the sort associated with Irish Catholics. The Republicans nominated famed soldier-explorer John Frémont under the slogan of &quot;Free soil, free labor, free speech, free men, Frémont and victory!&quot; Frémont won most of the North and nearly won the election. A slight shift of votes in Pennsylvania and Illinois would have resulted in a Republican victory. It had a strong base with majority support in most Northern states. It dominated in New England, New York and the northern Midwest, and had a strong presence in the rest of the North. It had almost no support in the South, where it was roundly denounced in 1856–60 as a divisive force that threatened civil war.

The election campaign was a bitter one with a high degree of personal attacks levied at all three candidates—Buchanan, aged 65, was mocked as being too old to be president and for not being married. Fremont was ridiculed for being born out of wedlock to a teenage mother. More damaging to the latter was the accusation by Know-Nothings that he was a secret Roman Catholic. Some Southern leaders threatened secession if a &quot;free soiler&quot; Northern candidate were elected. The two-year-old Republican Party nonetheless had a strong showing in its first presidential contest, and might have won except for Fillmore.

An uninspiring figure, Buchanan won the election with 174 electoral votes to Fremont&#x27;s 114. Immediately following Buchanan&#x27;s inauguration in March 1857, there was a sudden depression, known as the Panic of 1857, which weakened the credibility of the Democratic Party further. He feuded incessantly with Stephen Douglas for control of the Democratic Party, while the Republicans remained united and the Fillmore&#x27;s third party collapsed.

===Dred Scott decision===
On March 6, 1857, a mere two days after Buchanan&#x27;s inauguration, the Supreme Court handed down the infamous &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; decision. Dred Scott, a slave, had lived with his master for a few years in Illinois and Wisconsin, and with the support of abolitionist groups, was now suing for his freedom on the grounds that he resided in a free state. The Supreme Court quickly ruled on the very obvious—that slaves were not US citizens and thus had no right to sue in a Federal court. It also ruled that since slaves were private property, their master was fully within his rights to reclaim runaways, even if they were in a state where slavery did not exist, on the grounds that the Fifth Amendment forbade Congress to deprive a citizen of his property without due process of law. Furthermore, the Supreme Court decided that the Missouri Compromise, which had been replaced a few years earlier by the Kansas-Nebraska Act, had always been unconstitutional and Congress had no authority to restrict slavery within a territory, regardless of its citizens&#x27; wishes.

The decision outraged Northern opponents of slavery such as Abraham Lincoln and lent substance to the Republican charge that a Slave Power controlled the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court had sanctioned the hardline Southern view. This emboldened Southerners to demand even more rights for slavery, just as Northern opposition hardened. Anti-slavery speakers protested that the Supreme Court could merely interpret law, not make it, and thus the Dred Scott Decision could not legally open a territory to slavery.

===Lincoln-Douglas debates===
The seven famous Lincoln-Douglas debates were held for the Senatorial election in Illinois between incumbent Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln, whose political experience was limited to a single term in Congress that had been mainly notable for his opposition to the Mexican War. The debates are remembered for their relevance and eloquence.

Lincoln was opposed to the extension of slavery into any new territories. Douglas, however, believed that the people should decide the future of slavery in their own territories. This was known as popular sovereignty. Lincoln, however, argued that popular sovereignty was pro-slavery since it was inconsistent with the Dred Scott Decision. Lincoln said that Chief Justice Roger Taney was the first person who said that the Declaration of Independence did not apply to blacks and that Douglas was the second. In response, Douglas came up with what is known as the Freeport Doctrine. Douglas stated that while slavery may have been legally possible, the people of the state could refuse to pass laws favourable to slavery.

In his famous &quot;House Divided Speech&quot; in Springfield, Illinois, Lincoln stated:

:&quot;A house divided against itself cannot stand.&quot; I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved. I do not expect the house to fall, but I do expect that it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest further the spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the states, old as well as new, North as well as South.

During the debates, Lincoln argued that his speech was not abolitionist, writing at the Charleston debate that:

:I am not in favor of making voters or jurors of Negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office.

The debates attracted thousands of spectators and featured parades and demonstrations. Lincoln ultimately lost the election but vowed:

:The fight must go on. The cause of civil liberty must not be surrendered at the end of one or even 100 defeats.

===John Brown&#x27;s raid===
The debate took a new, violent turn with the actions of an abolitionist from Connecticut. John Brown was a militant abolitionist who advocated guerrilla warfare to combat pro-slavery advocates. Receiving arms and financial aid from a group of prominent Massachusetts business and social leaders known collectively as the Secret Six, Brown participated in the violence of Bleeding Kansas and directed the Pottawatomie massacre on May 24, 1856, in response to the sacking of Lawrence, Kansas. In 1859, Brown went to Virginia to liberate slaves. On October 17, Brown seized the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. His plan was to arm slaves in the surrounding area, creating a slave army to sweep through the South, attacking slaveowners and liberating slaves. Local slaves did not rise up to support Brown. He killed five civilians and took hostages. He also stole a sword that Frederick the Great had given George Washington. He was captured by an armed military force under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee. He was tried for treason to the Commonwealth of Virginia and hanged on December 2, 1859. On his way to the gallows, Brown handed a jailkeeper a note, chilling in its prophecy, predicting that the &quot;sin&quot; of slavery would never be cleansed from the United States without bloodshed.

The raid on Harper&#x27;s Ferry horrified Southerners who saw Brown as a criminal, and they became increasingly distrustful of Northern abolitionists who celebrated Brown as a hero and a martyr.

===Presidential election of 1860===

The Democratic National Convention for the Election of 1860 was held in Charleston, South Carolina, despite it usually being held in the North. When the convention endorsed the doctrine of popular sovereignty, 50 Southern delegates walked out. The inability to come to a decision on who should be nominated led to a second meeting in Baltimore, Maryland. At Baltimore, 110 Southern delegates, led by the so-called &quot;fire eaters,&quot; walked out of the convention when it would not adopt a platform that endorsed the extension of slavery into the new territories. The remaining Democrats nominated Stephen A. Douglas for the presidency. The Southern Democrats held a convention in Richmond, Virginia, and nominated John Breckinridge. Both claimed to be the true voice of the Democratic Party.

Former Know Nothings and some Whigs formed the Constitutional Union Party which ran on a platform based around supporting only the Constitution and the laws of the land.

Abraham Lincoln won the support of the Republican National Convention after it became apparent that William Seward had alienated certain branches of the Republican Party. Moreover, Lincoln had been made famous in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates and was well known for his eloquence and his moderate position on slavery.

Lincoln won a majority of votes in the electoral college, but only won two-fifths of the popular vote. The Democratic vote was split three ways and Lincoln was elected as the 16th president of the United States.

===Secession===
Lincoln&#x27;s election in November led to a declaration of secession by South Carolina on December 20, 1860. Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, six other states had declared their secession from the Union: Mississippi (January 9, 1861), Florida (January 10), Alabama (January 11), Georgia (January 19), Louisiana (January 26), and Texas (February 1).

Men from both North and South met in Virginia to try to hold together the Union, but the proposals for amending the Constitution were unsuccessful. In February 1861, the seven states met in Montgomery, Alabama, and formed a new government: the Confederate States of America. The first Confederate Congress was held on February 4, 1861, and adopted a provisional constitution. On February 8, 1861, Jefferson Davis was nominated President of the Confederate States.

==Civil War==

On April 12, 1861, after President Lincoln refused to give up Fort Sumter, the federal base in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina, the new Confederate government under President Jefferson Davis ordered General P.G.T. Beauregard to open fire on the fort. It fell two days later, without casualty, spreading the flames of war across America. Immediately, rallies were held in every town and city, north and south, demanding war. Lincoln called for troops to retake lost federal property, which meant an invasion of the South. In response, four more states seceded: Virginia (April 17, 1861), Arkansas (May 6, 1861), Tennessee (May 7, 1861), and North Carolina (May 20, 1861). The four remaining slave states, Maryland, Delaware, Missouri, and Kentucky, under heavy pressure from the Federal government did not secede; Kentucky tried, and failed, to remain neutral.

Each side had its relative strengths and weaknesses. The North had a larger population and a far larger industrial base and transportation system. It would be a defensive war for the South and an offensive one for the North, and the South could count on its huge geography, and an unhealthy climate, to prevent an invasion. In order for the North to emerge victorious, it would have to conquer and occupy the Confederate States of America. The South, on the other hand, only had to keep the North at bay until the Northern public lost the will to fight. The Confederacy adopted a military strategy designed to hold their territory together, gain worldwide recognition, and inflict so much punishment on invaders that the North would grow weary of the war and negotiate a peace treaty that would recognize the independence of the CSA. The only point of seizing Washington, or invading the North (besides plunder) was to shock Yankees into realizing they could not win. The Confederacy moved its capital from a safe location in Montgomery, Alabama, to the more cosmopolitan city of Richmond, Virginia, only 100 miles from the enemy capital in Washington. Richmond was heavily exposed, and at the end of a long supply line; much of the Confederacy&#x27;s manpower was dedicated to its defense. The North had far greater potential advantages, but it would take a year or two to mobilize them for warfare. Meanwhile, everyone expected a short war.

===War in the East===
The Union assembled an army of 35,000 men (the largest ever seen in North America up to that point) under the command of General Irvin McDowell. With great fanfare, these untrained soldiers set out from Washington DC with the idea that they would capture Richmond in six weeks and put a quick end to the conflict. At the Battle of Bull Run on July 21, however, disaster ensued as McDowell&#x27;s army was completely routed and fled back to the nation&#x27;s capitol. Major General George McClellan of the Union was put in command of the Army of the Potomac following the battle on July 26, 1861. He began to reconstruct the shattered army and turn it into a real fighting force, as it became clear that there would be no quick, six-week resolution of the conflict. Despite pressure from the White House, McClellan did not move until March 1862, when the Peninsular Campaign began with the purpose of capturing the capitol of the Confederacy, Richmond, Virginia. It was initially successful, but in the final days of the campaign, McClellan faced strong opposition from Robert E. Lee, the new commander of the Army of Northern Virginia. From June 25 to July 1, in a series of battles known as the Seven Days Battles, Lee forced the Army of the Potomac to retreat. McClellan was recalled to Washington and a new army assembled under the command of John Pope.

In August, Lee fought the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Manassas) and defeated John Pope&#x27;s Army of Virginia. Pope was dismissed from command and his army merged with McClellan&#x27;s. The Confederates then invaded Maryland, hoping to obtain European recognition and an end to the war. The two armies met at Antietam on September 17. This was the single bloodiest day in American history. The Union victory allowed Abraham Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared that all slaves in states still in rebellion as of January 1, 1863 were freed. This did not actually end slavery, but it served to give a meaningful cause to the war and prevented any possibility of European intervention.

Militarily, the Union could not follow up its victory at Antietam. McClellan failed to pursue the Confederate army, and President Lincoln finally became tired of his excuses and unwillingness to fight. He was dismissed from command in October and replaced by Ambrose Burnside, despite his pleas that he was not ready for the job. He attempted to invade Richmond from the north (McClellan had tried from the east), but the campaign ended in disaster at Fredericksburg when Burnside ordered waves of futile attacks against an entrenched Confederate position. The next year also proved difficult for the Union initially. Burnside was replaced by General Joseph &quot;Fighting Joe&quot; Hooker in January 1863, but he proved unable to stop Lee and &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson at Chancellorsville in May. Lee&#x27;s second invasion of the North, however, proved disastrous. Hooker was replaced by George Meade, and four days later the Battle of Gettysburg took place. Lee&#x27;s army lost scores of irreplaceable men and would never be the same again. Abraham Lincoln was angered by George Meade&#x27;s failure to pursue Lee after Gettysburg, but decided to let him stay in command, a decision endorsed by Ulysses S. Grant who was appointed General-in-Chief of all the Union armies early in 1864.

===War in the West===

While the Confederacy fought the Union to a bloody stalemate in the East, the Union army was much more successful in the West. Confederate insurrections in Missouri were put down by the federal government by 1863, despite the initial Confederate victory at Wilson&#x27;s Creek near Springfield, Missouri. After the Battle of Perryville, the Confederates were also driven from Kentucky, resulting in a major Union victory. Lincoln once wrote of Kentucky, &quot;I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.&quot; The fall of Vicksburg gave the Union control of the Mississippi River and cut the Confederacy in two. Sherman&#x27;s successes in Chattanooga and then Atlanta left few Confederate forces to resist his destruction of Georgia and the Carolinas. The Dakota War broke out in Minnesota in 1862.

===End of the Confederacy===
In 1864, General Grant assigned himself as direct commander of Meade and the Army of the Potomac, and placed General William Sherman in command of the Western Theatre. Grant began to wage a total war against the Confederacy. He knew that the Union&#x27;s strength lay in its resources and manpower and thus began to wage a war of attrition against Lee while Sherman devastated the West. Grant&#x27;s Wilderness Campaign forced Lee into Petersburg, Virginia. There he waged—and with Lee, pioneered—trench warfare at the Siege of Petersburg. In the meantime, General Sherman seized Atlanta, securing President Lincoln&#x27;s reelection. He then began his famous March to the Sea which devastated Georgia and South Carolina. Lee attempted to escape from Petersburg in March–April 1865, but was trapped by Grant&#x27;s superior number of forces. Lee surrendered at the Appomattox Court House. Four years of bloody warfare had come to a conclusion.

===Home fronts===

====United States====

The Union began the war with overwhelming long-term advantages in manpower, industry, and financing. It took a couple years for the potential to be realized, but with the victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in July 1863, the Confederacy was doomed.

Lincoln, an ungainly giant, did not look the part of a president, but historians have overwhelmingly praised the &quot;political genius&quot; of his performance in the role. His first priority was military victory, and that required that he master entirely new skills as a master strategist and diplomat. He supervised not only the supplies and finances, but as well the manpower, the selection of generals, and the course of overall strategy. Working closely with state and local politicians he rallied public opinion and (at Gettysburg) articulated a national mission that has defined America ever since. Lincoln&#x27;s charm and willingness to cooperate with political and personal enemies made Washington work much more smoothly than Richmond. His wit smoothed many rough edges. Lincoln&#x27;s cabinet proved much stronger and more efficient than Davis&#x27;s, as Lincoln channeled personal rivalries into a competition for excellence rather than mutual destruction. With William Seward at State, Salmon P. Chase at the Treasury, and (from 1862) Edwin Stanton at the War Department, Lincoln had a powerful cabinet of determined men; except for monitoring major appointments, Lincoln gave them full rein to destroy the Confederacy. Malaise led to sharp Democratic gains in the 1862 off-year elections, but the Republicans kept control of Congress and the key states. Despite grumbling by Radical Republicans, who disliked Lincoln&#x27;s leniency toward the South, Lincoln kept control of politics. The Republicans expanded with the addition of War Democrats and ran as the Union Party in 1864, blasting the Democrats as Copperheads and sympathizers with disunion. With the Democrats in disarray, Lincoln&#x27;s ticket won in a landslide.

During the Civil War the key policy-maker in Congress was Thaddeus Stevens, as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Republican floor leader, and spokesman for the Radical Republicans. Although he thought Lincoln was too moderate regarding slavery, he worked well with the president and Treasury Secretary in handling major legislation that funded the war effort and permanently transformed the nation&#x27;s economic policies regarding tariffs, bonds, income and excise taxes, national banks, suppression of money issued by state banks, greenback currency, and western railroad land grants.

====Confederate States====

The Confederacy was beset by growing problems as its territory steadily shrank, its people grew impoverished, and hopes of victory changed from reliance on Confederate military prowess to dreams of foreign intervention, to finally a desperate hope that the Yankees would grow so weary of war they would sue for peace. The South lost its lucrative export market as the Union blockade shut down all commercial traffic, with only very expensive blockade runners getting in and out. In 1861 the South lost most of its border regions, with Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri gained for the enemy, and western Virginia broken off. The Southern transportation system depended on a river system that the Union gunboats soon dominated, as control of the Mississippi, Missouri, Cumberland, and Tennessee rivers fell to the Union in 1862–63. That meant all the river towns fell to the Union as well, and so did New Orleans in 1862. The rickety railroad system was not designed for long-distance traffic (it was meant to haul cotton to the nearest port), and it steadily deteriorated until by the end practically no trains were running. Civilian morale and recruiting held up reasonably well, as did the morale of the army, until the last year or so. The Confederacy had democratic elections (for all white men), but no political parties. One result was that governors became centers of opposition to Jefferson Davis and his increasingly unpopular central administration in Richmond. Financially the South was in bad shape as it lost its export market, and internal markets failed one after the other. By 1864 women in the national capital were rioting because of soaring food prices they could not afford. With so few imports available, it was necessary to make do, use ersatz (such as local beans for coffee), use up, and do without. The large slave population never rose up in armed revolt, but black men typically took the first opportunity to escape to Union lines, where over 150,000 enrolled in the Union army. When the end came the South had a shattered economy, 300,000 dead, hundreds of thousands wounded, and millions impoverished, but three million former slaves were now free.

===Assassination of Abraham Lincoln===

On April 14, 1865, four days after the news of Lee&#x27;s surrender reached Washington, an air of celebration pervaded the capital. That evening, President Lincoln attended a performance of &quot;Our American Cousin&quot; at Ford&#x27;s Theatre. During the third act, a Confederate sympathizer named John Wilkes Booth shot and killed Abraham Lincoln. As he fled the scene, he yelled &quot;Sic semper tyrannis&quot;, the Virginia state motto. John Wilkes Booth was tracked, twelve days later, to a farm near Bowling Green, Virginia, on April 26. He was shot and killed by Union Army Sergeant Boston Corbett. His co-conspirators were tried before a military commission and were hanged on July 7.

<text>MTV Cribs (also known as Cribs) is an American documentary television show that originated on MTV and features tours of the private homes of celebrities. It originally aired from 2000 to 2010. In 2017, MTV produced short-form episodes of the program and distributed it through Snapchat Discover.

MTV revived the show for new full length episodes in 2021.

== History ==
The first show aired in September 2000. By 2005, &quot;Cribs&quot; had featured tours of the homes of over 185 celebrities including musicians, actors, and athletes over the course of 13 seasons. The show was originally narrated by Ananda Lewis, then narrated by SuChin Pak (originally of MTV News).

It was developed by Nina L. Díaz. A short iteration on CMT was titled CMT Cribs. The most watched and replayed episode of &quot;Cribs&quot; was a special one-hour edition touring Mariah Carey&#x27;s New York penthouse. In 2005/2006, MTV Canada produced a series of Canadian-made &quot;Cribs&quot; episodes. A new season of &quot;Cribs&quot;, filmed in high definition, started in August 2007 with a new format, title sequences, new narrator and on-screen graphics. A &quot;Priciest Pads&quot; special was created to kick off the new season, hosted by Kimora Lee Simmons.

The show was put into syndication in September 2008, to be offered by local television stations on a weekday basis in the United States by Litton Entertainment. However, the Litton versions of the program were severely edited and changed. Any references to MTV were scrubbed out, and the program received a new logo referring to it as just &quot;Cribs&quot;, while all music that was played in the original episodes was replaced by production music to avoid royalty fees. Although Lewis and Pak were still listed in the episode credits as narrators, all narration was stripped in the re-edited episodes, and &#x27;coming up&#x27; segments were either silent or voiced by an uncredited announcer. The syndicated version was unsuccessful and offered in barter form, mainly on the lower-rated stations in many markets in abysmal timeslots, and in September 2009 was removed from the market.

On January 24, 2009, &quot;Cribs&quot; created a separate version specific to CMT (a sister network of MTV), dedicating itself to country music artists, stock car drivers and professional bullriders, and other southeastern U.S. culture figures. New episodes were taped to air on CMT with the &quot;CMT Cribs&quot; title. Also in 2009, the MTV format switched to Teen Cribs, which featured the homes of regular teenagers living in large and otherwise notable homes, straying away from the celebrity element.

The main MTV &quot;Cribs&quot; series restarted in September 2010 with repackaging and updates of its past visits including such celebrities as Hanson, Twiggy Ramirez and others. The main MTV &quot;Cribs&quot; series created and broadcast a few new episodes in late 2010 and early 2011, featuring the homes of Penn Jillette, Julie Benz and Manny Pacquiao, and others.

==Revival==

The show was revived again for MTV as a short-form series with new episodes on Snapchat Discover beginning on June 3, 2017 with new episodes every Saturday for a number of weeks and the first episode featuring DJ Steve Aoki in his Las Vegas home. The revival was announced in April 2016 under former MTV president Sean Atkins. The first season was the highest rated premiere for a Snapchat Show ever and a second-season premiered mid-2018.

On July 14, 2021, it was announced that the show would be revived and include the homes of Martha Stewart, Big Sean, Rick Ross, Snooki, and other stars. It premiered on August 11 of that year and Pak returned as narrator. Season 19 aired on October 27, 2022.

== Show format ==
Producers decided not to include a host to make the show feel more intimate. Each 30-minute; documentary-style episodes begins with the celebrity opening the front door, introducing themselves, and saying, &quot;welcome to my crib.&quot;

A steadicam follows the celebrity through the home and takes frequent close-ups to make the viewer feel like they are walking through the home themselves.

== Controversies ==
Several celebrities have either been accused of, or admitted to, using other people&#x27;s property and claiming them as their own.
*In 2004, a lawsuit was brought against MTV by the real owner of Ja Rule&#x27;s house alleging unauthorized taping of the interior and damage to the property caused by Ja Rule&#x27;s partying.
*The first &quot;MTV Cribs&quot; episode with Robbie Williams showcased actress Jane Seymour&#x27;s house as his home. In reality, Williams was renting the home from Seymour. In an episode of &quot;The Kumars at No. 42&quot;, Seymour confirmed that she owned the property. Williams later admitted the con and then showed off his real home in a later episode.
*50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;MTV Cribs&quot; episode showed him with three Ferraris (a yellow Enzo Ferrari, and red versions of the Ferrari F50 and Ferrari 599) with 50 Cent claiming they were his &quot;whips&quot;. All three Ferraris were in fact owned by a private collector who lent out the vehicles for 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;Cribs&quot; episode and related music video work.
*Kim Kardashian&#x27;s episode of &quot;MTV Cribs&quot; was not filmed at her home. The episode shows her mother&#x27;s home in Hidden Hills and not Kim&#x27;s home, which at the time of the episode&#x27;s production was located in Beverly Hills.
*JoJo Levesque had her episode filmed at the home of an uncle, while she and her mother were transient, mostly staying within hotels and without a residence during her tours.

<doc id="752074" wikidata="Q4791413" url="?curid=752074" title="Arizona State Prison Complex – Florence">
<text>Arizona State Prison Complex – Florence also known as Florence State Prison (FSP) is a former facility operated by the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADC). The main FSP prison was located in Florence, Arizona. The Florence complex used to include a unit in Picacho in unincorporated Pinal County however, the Picacho Unit was closed and razed in early 2013. The Globe Unit in Globe is now part of ASPC-Phoenix.

The Central Unit of ASPC–Florence housed Arizona&#x27;s one of two male death row cell blocks (the other at Eyman where they were both consolidated when ASPC-Florence closed down) and the State of Arizona execution chamber. FSP is the judicial site in Arizona for state executions since 1910. The death house known on the Unit as Housing Unit 9 is located beside Housing Unit 8. Lethal injection and the gas chamber are the sole methods of execution.

In 1908 inmates finished building and opened the Arizona Prison at Florence. This new prison was to replace the territorial prison in Yuma. The convicts lived in tents while constructing the prison. The new prison featured a death chamber. The chamber was scaffolding above the death row cells that had a trap door for hanging inmates which opened to a room below. In 1934, hanging was replaced with the gas chamber following a botched hanging that took place in 1930. Convicts from Florence were a cheap source of labor and the state used them to build roads through the mountains between Bisbee and Tombstone in 1913. Convicts also built a bridge over the San Pedro River and improved the Douglas Highway. There is a concrete monument there commemorating the completion of the road.

The prison was designed in a mission-revival style architecture.

FSP had an inmate capacity of 3,946 in 6 housing units, housed at level 2, 3 and 5 security levels. The ADC uses a score classification system to assess inmates appropriate custody and security level placement. The scores range from 1 to 5 with 5 being the highest risk or need.

Central Unit was recently changed from a split 3/5 level to a sole maximum security unit.

<doc id="752081" wikidata="Q687600" url="?curid=752081" title="The Dead (1987 film)">
<text>The Dead is a 1987 period drama film directed by John Huston, written by his son Tony Huston, and starring his daughter Anjelica Huston. It is an adaptation of the short story of the same name by James Joyce, which was first published in 1914 as the last story in &quot;Dubliners&quot;. An international co-production between the United Kingdom, the United States, and West Germany, the film was Huston&#x27;s last as director, and it was released several months after his death.

The film takes place in Dublin in 1904 at an Epiphany party hosted by two sisters and their niece. The story focuses on the academic Gabriel Conroy (Donal McCann) and his discovery of his wife Gretta&#x27;s (Anjelica Huston) memories of a deceased lover. The ensemble cast also includes Helena Carroll, Cathleen Delany, Dan O&#x27;Herlihy, Marie Kean, Donal Donnelly, Seán McClory, Frank Patterson, and Colm Meaney.

At the 60th Academy Awards, Tony Huston was nominated for the award for Best Adapted Screenplay and Dorothy Jeakins was nominated for Best Costume Design for their work on the film. John Huston posthumously won the award for Best Director at the 3rd Independent Spirit Awards, and Anjelica Huston won the award for Best Supporting Female at the same ceremony.

==Plot==
On January 6, 1904, spinster sisters Kate and Julia Morkan and their unmarried niece, Mary Jane, host their annual Epiphany dinner party at their townhouse in Dublin. Horse-drawn carriages arrive with guests on the snowy night. Three of Mary Jane&#x27;s music students, Miss O&#x27;Callaghan, Miss Furlong, and Miss Higgins, enter, accompanied by the young bachelors Joseph Kerrigan and Raymond Bergin, who Miss Furlong formally introduces to Kate and her frail older sister, Julia.

Dan Brown, the only Protestant invited to the party, arrives next, followed by Kate&#x27;s favorite nephew, Gabriel Conroy, and his wife Gretta. Kate is worried that Freddy Malins will show up drunk, and when he does, Gabriel promptly escorts the man to the restroom to sober him up. After a few more drinks with Mr. Brown, Freddy goes to talk to his mother, who lives in Scotland with her daughter, and Mrs. Malins berates him for failing to meet her for tea earlier.

The guests dance, Mary Jane performs a virtuosic piece on the piano, and a guest named Mr. Grace recites a poem he calls &quot;Broken Vows&quot;, which is a lament of lost love, during which Gretta&#x27;s eyes grow misty. When the dancing restarts, Kate pairs Gabriel with Molly Ivors, an Irish nationalist colleague of his. She chides Gabriel for writing for an English newspaper and not learning Irish, and in response, he declares he is sick of Ireland.

While Gretta is attempting to persuade Gabriel that they should go on a summer trip to the Aran Islands that Molly mentioned, Kate announces that Julia is going to sing &quot;Arrayed for the Bridal&quot;, an operatic piece from her &quot;concert days&quot;. Despite her warbling voice, Freddy drunkenly gushes over the performance, and Kate complains about the Pope ending her sister&#x27;s singing career in the church choir when he replaced the women with boys.

When it is time to eat, Molly leaves the party to attend a union meeting. During the sumptuous feast, conversation topics range from opera to morality. Freddy reliably utters the wrong things, but despite his nerves, Gabriel gives a rousing speech praising the wonderful Irish hospitality shown by Kate, Julia and Mary Jane.

As the guests are leaving, Mrs. Malins asks Gabriel to look after Freddy when she returns to Scotland, and Gabriel awakens Mr. Brown and puts him in a carriage with the Malins. When almost everyone is gone, Bartell D’Arcy, a &quot;celebrated tenor&quot; who had not sung anything all evening, sings &quot;The Lass of Aughrim&quot; to Miss O&#x27;Callaghan, and Gabriel watches Gretta as she listens transfixed from the stairs. Her pensiveness continues in the carriage on the way to the hotel where she and Gabriel are staying the night, and she dismisses Gabriel&#x27;s attempts to cheer her.

In their hotel room, Gabriel asks Gretta what she is thinking, and she explains that when she was young and lived with her grandmother in Galway, a boy she knew named Michael Furey used to sing &quot;The Lass of Aughrim&quot;. She says she feels responsible for his death at age seventeen as, on the night before she returned to the convent in Dublin where she went to school, Michael left his sick bed and stood outside her window in the cold and rain to say goodbye, and he died a week later. Gretta cries herself to sleep, and Gabriel thinks that he has never felt love like the love Michael must have felt for Gretta and that it is better to die young and passionate than to wither and fade away like Julia, and presumably he will. Looking out the window, he imagines the snow falling all over Ireland, &quot;upon all the living and the dead.&quot;

==Cast==
==Adaptation==
Tony Huston&#x27;s screenplay was a fairly close adaptation of the original story, with some alterations made to the dialogue to aid the narrative for cinema audiences. The most significant change to the story was the inclusion of a new character, Mr. Grace, who, in the film, recites an English translation of the eighth-century Middle Irish poem &quot;Donal Óg&quot;.

==Production==
Weiland Schulz-Keil and Chris Sievernich, the producers of the film, had previously raised the money for Huston&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;. Screen rights to &quot;The Dead&quot; were purchased from the Joyce estate for $60,000.

Filming began on 19 January 1987. Huston originally planned to shoot the film entirely on-location in Dublin and Ardmore Studios. However, due to his declining health, the interiors were all shot on a soundstage at the California Institute of the Arts, while a second unit led by Huston&#x27;s son Danny and director of photography Fred Murphy filmed exterior location footage in Dublin.

According to Pauline Kael, &quot;Huston directed the movie, at eighty, from a wheelchair, jumping up to look through the camera, with oxygen tubes trailing from his nose to a portable generator; most of the time, he had to watch the actors on a video monitor outside the set and use a microphone to speak to the crew. Yet he went into dramatic areas that he&#x27;d never gone into before - funny, warm family scenes that might be thought completely out of his range. Huston never before blended his actors so intuitively, so musically.&quot;

Huston&#x27;s health made him uninsurable, so his friend Karel Reisz agreed to sign on as a stand-by director in case he was unable to complete production.

Anjelica Huston said her father remained a filmmaking virtuoso despite his ill health: &quot;He was so sick, but he could literally do it with his eyes closed. He knew when we were going to get a take way long before the camera rolled. I mean the timing was so precise that he could tell everything, exactly how it was going to go.&quot; The pressures of filming and watching her father&#x27;s health deteriorate had an adverse effect on her own health, and she developed Epstein-Barr syndrome during production.

Siobhán McKenna was originally cast in the film, but died two months before principal photography began.

==Release==
&quot;The Dead&quot; was released on DVD by Lionsgate on November 3, 2009, but the initial pressing was missing nearly ten minutes of footage from early in the film. After word of this was posted on various websites, Lionsgate eventually corrected the mistake and released the full-length version.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Dead&quot; received mostly positive critical reviews. The film holds a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 31 reviews.

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited &quot;The Dead&quot; as one of his 100 favorite films.

<doc id="752085" wikidata="Q2933012" url="?curid=752085" title="Café du Monde">
<text>Café du Monde (French for &quot;Café of the World&quot; or &quot;the People&#x27;s Café&quot;) is a renowned open-air coffee shop located on Decatur Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. It is a New Orleans landmark and tourist destination, known for its &quot;café au lait&quot; and beignets. Its coffee with chicory is widely available in the continental United States.
==History==
The French brought coffee with them as they began to settle along the Gulf Coast and the Mississippi River, circa 1700. During the American Civil War, the New Orleans Creoles developed the chicory-blended coffee (as there was a coffee shortage) — which has continued to be served at Café Du Monde and other New Orleans restaurants. Chicory adds a chocolate-like flavor to café au lait.

The Acadians (Cajuns) from Nova Scotia brought other French customs, such as the beignet, to Louisiana in the 18th century. Unlike most doughnuts, beignets are squared pieces of dough with no hole in the middle and are most often covered with powdered sugar. Sometimes they are seen served with fruit, jam, maple syrup, or even savory items. At Café du Monde, the beignets are served with a thick coating of powdered sugar and sold in orders of three.

Café Du Monde is the oldest coffee shop in New Orleans, opening as a simple coffee stand in 1862. Its simple menu has changed little since that era, still including dark-roasted coffee with chicory (served black or au lait), beignets, white and chocolate milk, hot chocolate, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. Sodas and iced coffee are more recent additions. According to the Café du Monde&#x27;s vice-president, Burton E. Benrud Jr., the beignets remain the only food item on the French Market location&#x27;s menu; and Café Du Monde is committed to &quot;keeping things the way they&#x27;ve always been: recipes have gone relatively unchanged.&quot;

===Post-Katrina===
Due to Hurricane Katrina, the shop closed at midnight on August 27, 2005. Although it suffered only minor damage, it remained closed for nearly two months. Owners took advantage of the low-traffic interval afterwards to refurbish the eating areas and kitchens. Six weeks after the hurricane, Café Du Monde began promoting its re-opening as a sign that the city&#x27;s recovery had begun. Over 100 news media outlets, including ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, reported on the re-opening. The French Quarter location reopened on October 19, 2005, to national media attention.

==Locations==
&quot;The Butcher&#x27;s Hall&quot; is the name of the original building at the French Market site where the Café Du Monde is located. It was built by the Spanish in 1791; however, it was damaged by a hurricane in 1812. A new market building went up in 1813. The coffee stand was established at the upriver end of the French Market in 1862.

For over a century Café Du Monde was one of two similar coffee-and-beignet places in the Market, the other being Morning Call, which was established in 1870 and moved out of the old French Market in 1974 to the suburban area of Metairie. After losing its lease in Metairie, Morning Call eventually moved into a large facility in New Orleans&#x27; City Park where several years later Café du Monde displaced them and gained another lucrative venue, despite having to pay a considerable fee to the City of New Orleans for the location.

Starting in the late 1980s, Café Du Monde opened additional locations in shopping malls. There are a total of nine Café du Monde coffee stand locations in the New Orleans metropolitan area: the original located in the French Market at 800 Decatur Street, Riverwalk Marketplace, Esplanade Mall, Lakeside Mall, Oakwood Mall, Veterans Boulevard, Mandeville, Covington, City Park in New Orleans, and New Orleans Louis Armstrong International Airport.

After the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition in New Orleans, Café Du Monde was approached by Japanese businesses interested in expanding the brand to Japan. In 1989 the Duskin Company formally contacted Café Du Monde, and a franchise agreement was agreed in time for Duskin to open its first Japanese outlets in 1990. The franchise expanded to a peak of 32 locations.

For the most part, the Japanese Café Du Monde franchise kept the same aesthetic as the original locations: green and white color scheme and the style of French Quarter architecture. Unlike the Café Du Monde stores in Louisiana, the Japan franchise expanded the original menu by adding different varieties of beignets, but the Café Du Monde coffee with chicory stayed the same. Along with their varieties of beignet toppings, the Japanese franchise also offered seasonal desserts, which are not offered at Café Du Monde in Louisiana. 

However, as of 2016 there were only 10 locations in Japan. In early 2018, Duskin ended the business relationship, closing all Café Du Monde locations in Japan on March 31, 2018.

===Products===
Since the early 1990s, Café du Monde coffee can generally be purchased in independent East Asian grocery stores and markets across the Continental United States. Following the Vietnam War, many refugees from the country arrived in the United States, and were accustomed to French-style chicory coffee, a legacy they had in common with Louisiana from the French Colonial era. As more families began to settle in cities around the Gulf Coast, in time many Vietnamese in the New Orleans area began to frequent Café du Monde, as well as work there. Many in this community would send the characteristic orange-yellow tins of Café Du Monde coffee to family and friends around the country, as an alternative to American coffee which lacked chicory and gradually this began to be stocked by markets catering to this demographic. A packaged Café du Monde beignet mix is also available.

==In popular culture==
Café Du Monde has appeared in multiple fictional depictions of the city including the &quot;Dave Robicheaux&quot; series of novels by James Lee Burke, and novels by John Connolly, Adam Gnade, Poppy Z. Brite, Sherrilyn Kenyon, Anne Rice, Kresley Cole, David Morrell, and Nancy A. Collins. The café as it appeared in 1955 can be seen in an extended sequence in the William Castle film &quot;New Orleans Uncensored&quot;; and as it appeared pre-Katrina in two scenes of the 2003 movie &quot;Runaway Jury&quot;.

The business is sung about in the Jimmy Buffett song, &quot;The Wino and I Know.&quot; In a 2009 episode of &quot;Man v. Food&quot; centered in New Orleans, the restaurant is visited by Adam Richman. In the 2013 movie &quot;Now You See Me&quot;, the character Merritt McKinney played by Woody Harrelson performs his magic tricks inside the café. In addition, it is featured multiple times in the TV series &quot;Tremé&quot;. Café Du Monde is prominently featured as a destination spot in the 2014 film &quot;Chef&quot;, directed by and starring Jon Favreau.
The business also appeared in one of “The Simpsons” episodes.
The business is also mentioned in the Marcus King song &quot;Too Much Whiskey&quot;.

<doc id="752089" wikidata="Q2506575" url="?curid=752089" title="Representative of the Government in the Senate">
<text>The representative of the Government in the Senate () is the member of the Senate of Canada who is responsible for introducing, promoting, and defending the government&#x27;s bills in the Senate after they are passed by the House of Commons. The representative is appointed by the prime minister.

The position replaced the leader of the Government in the Senate (), which from 1867 to 2015 was a senator who was a member of the governing party and led the government caucus in the Senate of Canada (whether or not that party held a majority in the Senate). The position of Leader had almost always been held by a Cabinet minister, except briefly in 1926, from 1958 to 63 and from 2013 to the position being discontinued in 2015.

The government representative&#x27;s counterpart on the Opposition benches is the leader of the Opposition in the Senate, who continues to be a member of the Official Opposition political party.

Senator Marc Gold has served as the second and current representative of the Government in the Senate since January 24, 2020.

==History==

=== As Leader of the Government ===
Early Canadian cabinets included several senators who would be answerable to the Senate for government actions, one of whom would serve as de facto government leader in the Senate. In the nineteenth century, it was not considered unusual for a senator to be Prime Minister. Sir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott and Sir Mackenzie Bowell served as prime minister from the Senate. Abbott and Bowell both found it difficult to lead the government from the Senate, however, and over time, the perceived legitimacy of the Senate declined. Today, it is rare for senators to occupy prominent positions in cabinet. From 1935 on, it was typical for a cabinet to have only one senator who would have the position of minister without portfolio alongside the position of leader of the government in the Senate.

There have been a few rare occasions when the leader of the government in the Senate was not included in the cabinet by virtue of a separate ministerial appointment, such as William Benjamin Ross who served in the position in 1926, and Walter Morley Aseltine and Alfred Johnson Brooks who were not included in the cabinets of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker from 1958-1963. In 1968, the position of leader of the government in the Senate became an official Cabinet position in its own right with the appointment of Paul Martin, Sr. (father of Canada&#x27;s future prime minister, Paul Martin). From July 2013, under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the government leader in the Senate was again a non-cabinet minister.

Occasionally, senators still hold senior cabinet positions (other than the leader of the government in the Senate) in order to ensure regional balance in cabinet if the governing party is unable to elect members in a particular region or province, e.g., when the Progressive Conservative Party formed the government under the leadership of Joe Clark in 1979, and when the Liberal Party formed the government under the leadership of Pierre Trudeau in 1980. However, it is usually the case that the leader of the government in the Senate is the sole senator serving in Cabinet.

The responsibilities of the leader of the government in the Senate include:

# Planning and managing the government&#x27;s legislative program in the Senate
# Answering all questions for the government during the Senate&#x27;s Question Period
# Maintaining relations with the opposition on all matters concerning Senate activities
# Working with the leader of the Government in the House of Commons to ensure the effective coordination of the government&#x27;s legislative programme.

The government side in the Senate is the party that forms the government in the House of Commons. This means that the government party in the Senate may have fewer seats than the opposition, particularly when a general election results in a new party forming government.

=== As Representative of the Government ===
Due to current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#x27;s 2014 decision to remove senators from the Liberal Party of Canada caucus, leaving them all effectively sitting as independent senators, Trudeau named a Representative of the Government in the Senate in the 42nd Canadian Parliament rather than a government leader. The situation created some uncertainty about how the Senate would function, and how government legislation would be brought to the Senate. Retired civil servant Peter Harder was named to the position on March 18, 2016.

On November 29, 2019, the Prime Minister&#x27;s office announced that Senator Harder would be stepping down from his position as Representative of the Government in the Senate effective December 31, 2019. It was also announced that Senator Grant Mitchell would retire as Government Liaison in the Senate but would continue until a replacement for Harder was named in &quot;due course.&quot; On January 24, 2020, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that Senator Marc Gold had agreed to become the new Government Representative in the Senate, sitting as a non-affiliated senator and would also be sworn in as a Privy Councillor.

<doc id="752090" wikidata="Q61659" url="?curid=752090" title="Friedrich Ebert Jr.">
<text>Friedrich &quot;Fritz&quot; Ebert Jr. (12 September 1894 – 4 December 1979) was a German socialist and later communist politician, the son of Germany&#x27;s first president Friedrich Ebert. He was originally a Social Democrat like his father before him, but is best known for his role in the foundation of East Germany&#x27;s ruling party, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, in which he served in various positions.

==Early life==
Born in Bremen, Ebert underwent an apprenticeship as a printer from 1909 to 1913. In 1910, he joined the Socialist Workers&#x27; Youth and in 1913 the SPD. From 1915 to 1918, he fought in the First World War. Of his three brothers, Ebert Jr. was the only survivor.

==Weimar Republic==

In 1920, he married Johanna Elisabeth Vollmann, three years his junior, with whom he had two children, Friedrich and Georg. His wife committed suicide in 1938.

During the Weimar Era, Ebert worked for various social democratic newspapers. From 1919 to 1925 he was an editor for &quot;Vorwärts&quot;, from 1923 to 1925 he worked for the &quot;Social Democratic Press Service&quot;, and from 1925 to 1933 he was an editor for the &quot;Brandenburger Zeitung&quot;.

Ebert&#x27;s career in electoral politics began in 1927 when he was elected to the Brandenburg an der Havel City Council. In 1930, he became City Council Chairman, and the same year he joined the board of the Association of German Cities for the Province of Brandenburg. He was also a member of the SPD district board for Brandenburg-Grenzmark. He was elected to the Reichstag in 1928, representing the Potsdam I constituency, and in April 1933 joined the Prussian State Council representing Brandenburg. He lost all elected positions after the Nazis came to power and banned the SPD in June 1933.

Ebert was also active in the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, serving as chairman of the Brandenburg state group in 1928.

On 21 February 1933, three weeks after the appontment of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany, Ebert published an open letter to Paul von Hindenburg. In it he pointed out to the Reich President, among other things,

==Nazi Germany==

In July 1933, Ebert was arrested for illegal political activity and detained for eight months in various concentration camps, including Oranienburg and Börgermoor. In 1939, he was conscripted into the Wehrmacht, serving for nine months. After he was discharged in 1940, Ebert was forced to work in the packaging and shipping department of the Reich Publishing Office. Until 1945, he was under constant police surveillance.

==East Germany==
After the demise of the Third Reich, Ebert served as editor-in-chief of &quot;Der Märker&quot; and was elected chairman of the SPD in the Prussian province of Brandenburg. Being the son of a former president made Ebert one of the foremost political leaders in East Germany. His role in this period can be compared with that of Jan Masaryk in post-war Czechoslovakia. Ebert was courted by the leaders of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), who were aiming for unification of the much larger SPD with the smaller KPD. They used his father&#x27;s role in the German Revolution of 1918–19, and the ensuing split in the German socialist movement, to blackmail Ebert into supporting the unification.

In 1946, the unification of the two parties&#x27; branches in the Soviet Occupation Zone was carried out under Soviet pressure. After the creation of the new party, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), Ebert was elected to the Central Committee and from 1949 was also a member of the Politburo. He was one of the few members from the SPD half of the merger with a prominent role in the merged party. The few recalcitrant members of the SPD half were pushed out soon after the merger, leaving the SED as a renamed and enlarged KPD. He served as President of the Landtag of Brandenburg from 1946 to 1949.

After the end of Allied cooperation and the breakup of the administration of Berlin in 1948, Ebert became Lord Mayor of East Berlin; he remained mayor until 1967. During this time he devoted himself to rebuilding the destroyed city, campaigning for the restoration of the Brandenburg Gate, the Rotes Rathaus, the Zeughaus, and the Berlin State Opera.

During the East German flag debate, it was Ebert&#x27;s suggestion to use the black-red-gold tricolour instead of the black-white-red of the NKFD and the former German Empire. He justified his proposal as follows:

He was a member of the Deutscher Volksrat, a preliminary parliament that drew up the first constitution of the GDR, and after 1949, he also became a member of the People&#x27;s Chamber, the parliament of the GDR. Between 1949 and 1971, Ebert served as the chamber&#x27;s deputy president. In 1971, he was elected chairman of the SED faction in the People&#x27;s Chamber. From 1960, he was also a member of the Council of State and from 1971 its deputy chairman. As such, he was acting head of state in 1973 after Walter Ulbricht&#x27;s death until the election of Willi Stoph.

Ebert lived in Majakowskiring, Pankow, East Berlin. He was decorated with the Order of Karl Marx, the Patriotic Order of Merit, Star of People&#x27;s Friendship and the Banner of Labor. After his resignation as mayor, the magistrate of East Berlin awarded him honorary citizenship, which was declared null and void in 1992.

<text>Janusz Antoni Lewandowski (; born 13 June 1951) is a Polish politician and economist belonging to the Gdańsk liberals group, and a former member of the European Parliament (elected on 13 June 2004), Chairman of the Committee on Budgets. On 27 November 2009 he obtained the post of Budget and Financial Programming Commissioner of the European Commission and is affiliated to the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP). He was re-elected for the 8th term (2014–2019) of the European Parliament, as a member of the EPP group.

== Biography ==

Lewandowski was born in Lublin. He graduated in economics from University of Gdańsk, received a doctorate and was a lecturer there until 1984. Later he worked for Polish Oceanic Lines (Polskie Linie Oceaniczne). He was also a lecturer at Harvard University and the founder of the Research Institute for Market Economy in Gdańsk (Instytut Badań nad Gospodarką Rynkową w Gdańsku).

He is an author of a book on famous liberals and he also writes short articles for several newspapers and magazines, including &quot;Rzeczpospolita, Gazeta Wyborcza, Parkiet, Polityka, Wprost&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

== Political career ==
From 1980 to 1989 he was an economics adviser to the Solidarity anti-communist movement, and in 1988 he was one of the founders of the Liberal Democratic Congress. He was the Minister of Privatization in the cabinets of Jan Krzysztof Bielecki (1990–1991) and Hanna Suchocka (1992–1993). His major successes were the foundation of the Warsaw Stock Exchange and the mass privatization programme (Program Powszechnej Prywatyzacji).

He lost his parliamentary seat in the 1993 elections and worked as an international expert from 1994 to 1997. After the merger of KLD and Democratic Union in 1994 he became a member of Freedom Union (UW), and in 1997 member of Sejm representing UW. Together with Donald Tusk and other liberals he seceded from UW to form Civic Platform, and was elected an MP again in 2001. Since 2003 he was an observer in the European Parliament.

In the 2004 European Parliament election he was a candidate of Civic Platform in constituency #1 Pomeranian Voivodship and received 79,879 votes (=20.17%, the best result in the region). On 23 July 2004 he was elected chair of the Parliamentary Committee on Budgets.

Andris Piebalgs was twice Acting Commissioner in his stead, from 19 April 2014 – 25 May 2014 while he was on electoral campaign leave for the 2014 European Parliament election from 1 July 2014 – 16 July 2014 after he took up his seat.

Lewandowski was re-elected for the 8th term (2014–2019) of the European Parliament, as a member of the EPP group.

He was re-elected for the 9th term (2019–2024) of the European Parliament and was chosen as the 1st Vice-Chair of the EP Committee on Budgets.

==Political positions==
Lewandowski has expressed skepticism about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change, putting him at odds with many of his colleagues in the Barroso Commission. MEPs have asked &quot;which steps&quot; president Barroso will take over the comments. As one of the key experts on the European Union long term budget, known as &quot;Multiannual Financial Framework&quot;, or MFF, MEP Lewandowski was one of the European Parliament &quot;rapporteurs&quot;, recommending the agreement on the MFF 2021–2027.

<text>Anna Elżbieta Fotyga (; ; born 12 January 1957) is a Polish politician who currently serves as a Member of the European Parliament, and is the Secretary-General of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party. She has served as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland, in the successive cabinets of Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz and Jarosław Kaczyński (2006–2007) and Chief of the Chancellery of the President (2007–2008).

==Early life and education==
Fotyga is a graduate of the University of Gdańsk and the Danish School of Public Administration. She also served postgraduate internships at the Department of Labor of the United States, Cornell University in New York and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

==Career==
In 1981, and again after 1989, Fotyga acted as Head of the Foreign Office of the Solidarity headquarters in Gdańsk, and was a close associate of Lech Kaczyński. In 2000, Fotyga served as a foreign affairs adviser under then Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek. Subsequently, she was Deputy Chair of the supervisory board of Social Security Administration (Zakład Ubezpieczen Spolecznych, ZUS) with special expertise in International Labour Organization (Międzynarodowa Organizacja Pracy) and the World Bank. From 2002 to 2004, she was Deputy Mayor of Gdańsk.

===Career in national politics===
Fotyga garnered 25,994 votes (the second highest in the region) in the 2004 European parliamentary elections as a candidate of the Law and Justice (PiS) party in the Pomeranian Voivodship.

On 9 May 2006 Fotyga was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland by President Lech Kaczyński, replacing Stefan Meller. The opposition criticised her office for pursuing a policy of isolation in relation to Russia and Germany. On 7 September 2007, Fotyga was dismissed from her post but re-appointed again on the same day; in this way the prime minister and president avoided her being dismissed by a vote of censure prepared by the Civic Platform three months earlier.

Following the fall of the Kaczynski administration in 2007, she was succeeded by Radosław Sikorski as foreign minister of Poland.

Until 20 August 2008, Fotyga was the chief of the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland.

===Member of the European Parliament, 2014–present===
From 2014 until 2019, Fotyga served chair of the European Parliament Subcommittee on Security and Defence. She has since been a full member of both the Committee on Foreign Affairs and its Subcommittee on Security and Defence.

In 2015, news media reported that Fotyga was included in a Russian blacklist of prominent people from the European Union who are not allowed to enter the country.

In 2020, Fotyga was appointed by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to join a group of experts to support his work in a reflection process to further strengthen NATO&#x27;s political dimension.

==Political positions==
Fotyga&#x27;s position on foreign affairs is congruent with the policy stance of PiS, based on the concept of Poland as a strong, independent country, poised to confront Germany or Russia when necessary. She has also pursued a policy of close alignment with the U.S.

On 23 November 2016 Fotyga proposed a resolution to counteract propaganda against the EU, which includes advocating censoring Russian media, such as RT and Sputnik. The proposal came under criticism of European Federation of Journalists, and Russian government.

Fotyga has signed a petition supporting the recognition of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria by the European Parliament.

==Personal life==
Fotyga is married and has two children.

<doc id="752105" wikidata="Q2601" url="?curid=752105" title="Manfred Gerlach">
<text>Manfred Gerlach (8 May 1928 – 17 October 2011) was a German jurist and politician, and the longtime leader of the East German Liberal Democratic Party. He served as &quot;Chairman of the Council of State&quot; and was thus head of state of East Germany from 6 December 1989 to 5 April 1990.

==Early life==
Gerlach was born in Leipzig and became a member of the resistance during World War II.

==Political career==
After the war, he studied law at the German Academy of State Sciences and Law &quot;Walter Ulbricht&quot; from 1951 to 1954. He worked as editor-in-chief of the Liberal-Democratic newspaper in Halle/Saale. In 1964, he earned his doctorate and would become a professor two decades later, in 1984. He was a co-founder of the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LDPD) and the Free German Youth (FDJ) in Leipzig. He was the LDPD youth leader of North-West Saxony from 1946 to 1950. From 1947 to 1952 he was also a member of the executive council of the Saxon LDPD from 1947 to 1952. In the 1950s, he was a mayor &quot;(Bürgermeister and deputy Oberbürgermeister)&quot; of the city of Leipzig. He served as the LDPD&#x27;s vice-chairman until 1953. From 1954 to 1967, he was the LDPD&#x27;s General Secretary. At the LDPD&#x27;s general party congress of 1967, he was elected as chairman of the LDPD. He remained chairman until 10 February 1990. From 1949 to 1990, Gerlach was a member of the People&#x27;s Chamber. He was also one of the deputy chairmen of the Council of State (&quot;de facto&quot; Vice-President) from 1960 until 1990. 

He initially supported the Socialist Unity Party line of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; of the East German non-communist parties. However, he began to move away from total submissiveness towards the SED in the late 1970s. Under his leadership, the LDPD developed some small scale contacts with its West German counterparts, the Free Democrats (FDP). However, as a state functionary, he defended the nationalisation of the last substantive private enterprises. 

Gerlach reportedly welcomed the liberalisation in the USSR started by Mikhail Gorbachev. His support for more liberalisation and pluralism in East Germany earned him remarkable popularity; popularity which he, however, lost due to his hesitant attitude during the overthrow of the SED in 1989.

On 13 October 1989, Gerlach was the first important East German politician to publicly question the monopolistic role of the SED. A few days later, on 18 October, SED leader Erich Honecker was finally deposed by his own Politburo. After the Fall of the Berlin Wall, Gerlach was elected chairman of the Council of State and thus the first non-communist head of state of the GDR who was not a caretaker. He held this post until April 1990, when the State Council was abolished in a prelude to reunification with West Germany.

In March 1990, Gerlach&#x27;s party and two other liberal parties merged into the new Association of Free Democrats, which merged into the West German FDP after reunification. In November 1993, Gerlach resigned his FDP party membership. In politics, his views thereafter became close to those of the Party of Democratic Socialism (the former SED). Gerlach was a signatory of the &quot;Berliner Alternatives Geschichtsforum&quot;, which promoted more positive views on GDR history. Critics of the former communist regime have described these publications co-authored by former GDR high functionaries (e.g. Gerlach, Gerald Götting, Hans Modrow etc.) as whitewashing the SED dictatorship and working on the image of current Germany by using antifascist rhetoric.

Gerlach had earned numerous state awards by the GDR, including the Patriotic Order of Merit and the Star of People&#x27;s Friendship in 1964 and 1988 and the Order of Karl Marx in 1988.

==Death==
On 17 October 2011, Gerlach died, aged 83, in Berlin following a long illness.

<text>Julius Arthur Hemphill (January 24, 1938 – April 2, 1995) was a jazz composer and saxophone player. He performed mainly on alto saxophone, less often on soprano and tenor saxophones and flute.

==Biography==

Hemphill was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and attended I.M. Terrell High School (as did Ornette Coleman). He studied the clarinet with John Carter, another I.M. Terrell alumnus, before learning saxophone. Gerry Mulligan was an early influence. He studied music at North Texas State College.

Hemphill joined the United States Army in 1964, and served for several years in the United States Army Band. He later performed with Ike Turner for a brief period. In 1968, Hemphill moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and co-founded the Black Artists&#x27; Group (BAG), a multidisciplinary arts collective that brought him into contact with artists such as saxophonists Oliver Lake and Hamiet Bluiett, trumpeters Baikida Carroll and Floyd LeFlore, and writer/director Malinke Robert Elliott.

Hemphill moved to New York City in the mid-1970s, and was active in the then-thriving free jazz community. He gave saxophone lessons to a number of musicians, including David Sanborn and Tim Berne. Hemphill was probably best known as the founder of the World Saxophone Quartet, a group he formed in 1976, after collaborating with Anthony Braxton in several saxophone-only ensembles. Hemphill left the World Saxophone Quartet in the early 1990s, and formed a saxophone quintet.

Hemphill recorded over twenty albums as a leader, about ten records with the World Saxophone Quartet and recorded or performed with Björk, Bill Frisell, Anthony Braxton and others. Late in his life, ill-health (including diabetes and heart surgery) forced Hemphill to stop playing saxophone, but he continued writing music until his death in New York City. His saxophone sextet, led by Marty Ehrlich, also released several albums of Hemphill&#x27;s music, but without Hemphill playing. The most recent is entitled &quot;The Hard Blues&quot;, recorded live in Lisbon after Hemphill&#x27;s death from diabetes.

In 2021, New World Records released a retrospective seven-disc box set album titled &quot;The Boyé Multi-National Crusade for Harmony&quot; featuring Hemphill in a variety of mostly live solo and group contexts.

A source of information on Hemphill&#x27;s life and music is a multi-hour oral history interview that he conducted for the Smithsonian Institution in March and April 1994, and which is held at the Archives Center of the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="752119" wikidata="Q4975585" url="?curid=752119" title="Brother of Jared">
<text>In the Book of Mormon, the Brother of Jared is the most prominent person in the account given in the beginning (Chapters 1–6) of the Book of Ether. The Brother of Jared&#x27;s name is not given in the text of the Book of Mormon, but Joseph Smith stated in 1834 that it was Mahonri Moriancumer.

== Name ==
In an 1835 letter, Oliver Cowdery parenthetically gives the name of the brother of Jared as &quot;Moriancumer,&quot; which appears in the Book of Ether in the Book of Mormon only as a place name. A later account describes an 1834 statement by Joseph Smith in which he said that the brother of Jared&#x27;s name had been revealed to him as &quot;Mahonri Moriancumer&quot;:


Etymologies have been proposed but remain largely speculative.

According to Daniel H. Ludlow, it is not clear why the name of the Brother of Jared does not appear in the Book of Mormon. However, the following are possible reasons:
* The Brother of Jared may have omitted his name out of modesty (John the Beloved did essentially the same thing in the Gospel of John, which he is traditionally said to have written);
* The Book of Ether is clearly a family record of Jared, not the Brother of Jared; Ether, the final writer and perhaps the abridger of the record, was a descendant of Jared and might naturally have emphasized the achievements of his direct ancestor rather than the brother of his ancestor;
* Moroni may have omitted the name in his abridgment because of difficulty in translating (or &quot;transliterating&quot;) the name into the Nephite language;
* In Ancient Rome, &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; meant names were intentionally deleted from the public record. Ancient Egyptian factions also expunged names and statues of heretical rivals. In Ether 11:17–18, a direct descendant of the Brother of Jared, and rival king, is also not named.

<text>Richfield Coliseum, also known as the Coliseum at Richfield, was an indoor arena located in Richfield Township, between Cleveland and Akron, Ohio. It opened in 1974 as a replacement for the Cleveland Arena, and had a seating capacity of 20,273 for basketball. It was the main arena for the Northeast Ohio region until 1994, when it was replaced by Gund Arena (now Rocket Arena) in downtown Cleveland. The Coliseum stood vacant for five years before it was purchased and demolished in 1999 by the National Park Service. The site of the building was converted to a meadow and is now part of Cuyahoga Valley National Park.

The arena was primarily the home to the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), developed by Cavaliers owner Nick Mileti, who also owned the Cleveland Crusaders of the World Hockey Association. Over the years it had additional tenants such as the Cleveland Barons of the National Hockey League, Cleveland Force of Major Indoor Soccer League, Cleveland Crunch of Major Indoor Soccer League, the Cleveland Lumberjacks of the International Hockey League, and the Cleveland Thunderbolts of the Arena Football League. 

It hosted the 1981 NBA All-Star Game; The Buckeye Homecoming, the 1983 professional boxing match between Michael Dokes and Gerrie Coetzee; and the 1985 MISL All Star Game. It was also the site of the March 24, 1975 boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner, which in part inspired the movie &quot;Rocky&quot;.

The Coliseum was a regular concert venue, with its first event being a concert by Frank Sinatra. The first rock concert at the Richfield Coliseum, in October 1974, featured Stevie Wonder in October 1974. The last concert was by Roger Daltrey, in 1994; that was also the last official event at the arena. 

==History==
The arena, which opened in 1974, replaced the Cleveland Arena, which had 12,500+ boxing capacity, 10,000+ otherwise. The new arena seated 20,273 for basketball and 18,544 for hockey, and was one of the first indoor arenas to contain luxury boxes. Cavaliers founder Nick Mileti was the driving force behind the Coliseum&#x27;s construction, believing that its location in northern Summit County south of Cleveland near the confluence of the Ohio Turnpike and Interstates 77 and 271 was ideally suited given the growth of urban sprawl. 

The Coliseum was built in Richfield to draw fans from both of Northeast Ohio&#x27;s major cities, as nearly five million Ohioans lived within less than an hour&#x27;s drive (in good weather) from the Coliseum. While the arena&#x27;s location hindered attendance somewhat, the Cavaliers&#x27; average attendance was over 18,000 per game each of the last two seasons at the Coliseum. In a 2012 interview with ESPN&#x27;s Bill Simmons, basketball great Larry Bird said that it was his favorite arena to play in. The Coliseum was the site of Bird&#x27;s final game in the NBA.

The Force also drew well at Richfield: 20,174 attended when Cleveland took on Minnesota on April 6, 1986, still the largest regular-season crowd (and the third-largest overall) ever to see an indoor soccer match in the US.

The World Wrestling Federation also promoted several notable pay-per-view shows at the arena, including &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event VII&quot; (taped September 13, 1986); Survivor Series (1987); Survivor Series (1988); and Survivor Series (1992)

===Attendance hindrances===
Though a large arena at the time of construction, it had only one concourse for both levels, which made for very cramped conditions when attendance was anywhere close to capacity. The Coliseum&#x27;s real drawback was that the revenue-producing luxury suites were at the uppermost level and, as such, were the worst seats in the house. This situation was rectified at Gund Arena, where the suites were much closer to the playing area.

Also hurting attendance was the arena&#x27;s location at the interchange of Interstate 271 and Ohio State Route 303, which was a rural, two-lane highway outside of Richfield. The rural location made the Coliseum inaccessible to anyone without an automobile, and as the only true access to the arena was directly at the interchange, traffic became an issue with every Coliseum event, especially when attendance was anywhere near capacity. Lake-effect snow from Lake Erie provided another obstacle to drivers during the winter months.

===Demolition and environmental remediation===
The Coliseum&#x27;s fate was sealed in 1990, when voters in Cuyahoga County approved a new sin tax to fund the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex, which included Gund Arena. The Cavaliers moved to Gund Arena at the beginning of the 1994–95 season.

In 1997, the hardwood floor was sold to Grace Christian School of Staunton, Virginia.

After being vacant for five years, the arena was torn down in 1999, between March 30 and May 21, and the arena footprint and surrounding parking areas were allowed to be returned to woodland as part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area, now Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Two years later it was noted that the site appeared to have no trace of the former building, although a widened section of Route 303, as well as the remains of the parking lot entrance, reveal its location.

The site is now a grassy meadow and has become an important area for wildlife. Birds such as the Eastern meadowlark, bobolink, and various sparrows now inhabit the area. This has caused the site to become popular with local birders.

===Seating capacity===

<doc id="752127" wikidata="Q5291486" url="?curid=752127" title="Don't Break the Ice">
<text>Don&#x27;t Break the Ice is a children&#x27;s tabletop game for two to four players ages 3 and up. First marketed by Schaper Toys in 1968, the game was sold to Hasbro subsidiary Milton Bradley in 1986. It is still in production, and special editions were released in conjunction with the films &quot;Frozen&quot; (2013) and &quot;Frozen II&quot; (2019).

==Game play==
The game is played with a set of plastic &quot;ice blocks&quot;, a stand, and one miniature plastic hammer for each player. One ice block is larger than the rest, and has a plastic character standing on it - this varies from edition to edition, being either Phillip the Penguin, a man referred to as &quot;Ice Man&quot;, or a polar bear.

To set up the game, the stand is turned upside down and the ice blocks placed into the frame, so that the shared uniform compression of the blocks pressed against each other will cause them to stay in place when the stand is turned upright. The players then take turns removing ice blocks by tapping with the hammers. The game ends when one player causes the block with the character figure to fall through. The player who took the turn before that one wins the game.

<doc id="752144" wikidata="Q5132059" url="?curid=752144" title="Cleveland Arena">
<text>Cleveland Arena was an arena in Cleveland, Ohio. It was built and privately financed by local businessman Albert C. Sutphin during the height of the Great Depression in 1937 as a playing site for Sutphin&#x27;s AHL team, the Cleveland Barons. The arena was at 3717 Euclid Avenue, and seated over 10,000 in the stands and over 12,500 for events such as boxing, where floor seating was available.

In addition to the Barons, the arena was home to the Cleveland Rebels of the Basketball Association of America, also owned by Sutphin, for the 1946–47 season.

Cleveland Arena was also a regular concert and boxing venue, and six-day bicycle races were held there between 1939 and 1958, moved there from Public Hall. On March 21, 1952, it was the site of the Moondog Coronation Ball, considered the first rock and roll concert, organized by Alan Freed. The concert was shut down after the first song by fire authorities due to overcrowding. It was estimated 20,000 people were in the arena or trying to enter it, when the capacity was roughly half that.

In 1968, the arena and the Barons were purchased by Nick Mileti. In 1970, the expansion Cleveland Cavaliers of the NBA moved into the arena and played there for their first four seasons, from 1970 to 1974. After the Cavaliers began playing at the arena, it stopped hosting games for the Cincinnati Royals of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Royals, who also played home games at other Ohio sites, played more than 35 games at the arena between 1966 and 1970.

The Cleveland Crusaders of the new World Hockey Association played at the arena from 1972 to 1974.

The arena also had a medical facility, Arena Clinic. It primarily provided medical care for visiting athletic teams and other entertainment events, but also served as a walk-in clinic for the community. Its sign can be seen in photographs of the arena.

While the arena was a showpiece when it opened, by the 1970s it had become decrepit. It also lacked adequate parking. It closed in 1974, with teams moving to the Richfield Coliseum. The arena was demolished in 1977; the headquarters of the Cleveland Chapter of the American Red Cross now occupies the site.

The arena was the last major sporting facility to open within Cleveland&#x27;s borders prior to 1994, when Jacobs Field, now Progressive Field, opened for Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) Cleveland Indians. Later that year, the Cavaliers moved back into Cleveland when they opened the adjacent Gund Arena, now Rocket Arena.

<text>Haunani-Kay Trask (October 3, 1949 – July 3, 2021) was a Native Hawaiian activist, educator, author, poet, and a leader of the Hawaiian sovereignty movement. She was professor emerita at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, where she founded and directed the Kamakakūokalani Center for Hawaiian Studies. A published author, Trask wrote scholarly books and articles, as well as poetry. She also produced documentaries and CDs. Trask received awards and recognition for her scholarship and activism, both during her life and posthumously.

== Early life and education ==

Trask was born to Haunani and Bernard Trask. She was born in San Francisco, California and grew up on the Koolau side of the island of Oahu in Hawaii.

Trask graduated from Kamehameha Schools in 1967. She attended the University of Chicago, but transferred to the University of Wisconsin–Madison to complete her bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1972, master&#x27;s degree in 1975, and Ph.D. in political science in 1981. Her dissertation was published into a book, &quot;Eros and Power: The Promise of Feminist Theory&quot;, by the University of Pennsylvania Press in 1986.

== Career ==
Trask founded the Kamakakūokalani Center for Hawaiian Studies at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The center emerged as an evolution of the university’s American Studies program after Trask “charged the department with sex and race discrimination.” Trask protested the American Studies curriculum’s lack of racial, ideological, and gender diversity. She served as the center&#x27;s director for almost ten years and was one of its first tenured faculty members. Trask helped secure the building of the Gladys Brandt Kamakakūokalani Center for Hawaiian Studies, the permanent center for Hawaiian Studies at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. In 2010, Trask retired from her director position but continued teaching native political movements in Hawaii and the Pacific, the literature and politics of Pacific Islander women, Hawaiian history and politics, and third world and indigenous history and politics as an emeritus faculty member.

Trask hosted and produced &quot;First Friday&quot;, a monthly public-access television program started in 1986 to highlight political and cultural Hawaiian issues. Trask co-wrote and co-produced the award-winning 1993 documentary &quot;Act of War: The Overthrow of the Hawaiian Nation.&quot; She also wrote the 1993 book &quot;From a Native Daughter: Colonialism and Sovereignty in Hawaii&quot;, which has been described by Cynthia G. Franklin and Laura E. Lyons as a &quot;foundational text&quot; about indigenous rights. Trask published two books of poetry, the 1994 &quot;Light in the Crevice Never Seen&quot; and the 2002 &quot;Night Is a Sharkskin Drum.&quot; Trask developed &quot;We Are Not Happy Natives,&quot; a CD published in 2002 about the Hawaiian sovereignty movement.&quot;&quot;

Trask was a fellow at the International Institute of Human Rights in 1984, a research fellow at the American Council of Learned Societies in 1984, a Rockefeller fellow at the University of Colorado from 1993-1994, a &quot;National Endowment for the Arts writer-in-residence&quot; at the Institute of American Indian Arts in 1996, a fellow at the Pacific-Basin Research Center at Harvard University from 1998-1999, and a William Evans visiting fellow in Maori studies at the University of Otago.

Trask represented Native Hawaiians at the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Peoples in Geneva. In 2001, she traveled to South Africa to participate in the United Nations World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance.

=== Awards and recognitions ===
In 1991, Trask was named “Islander of the Year” by &quot;Honolulu Magazine&quot; and one of ten Pacific women of the year by &quot;Pacific Islands Monthly Magazine&quot;. In 1994, she was awarded the Gustavus Myers Award for her 1993 book &quot;From a Native Daughter&quot;. In March 2017, &quot;Hawaii Magazine&quot; recognized Trask as one of the most influential women in Hawaiian history. In 2019, Trask was awarded the “Angela Y. Davis Prize” from the American Studies Association in recognition of her application of her “scholarship for the public good.”

== Political beliefs ==

While earning her undergraduate degree in Chicago, Trask learned about and became an active supporter of the Black Panther Party. While studying at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Trask also participated in student protests against the Vietnam War. Trask later wrote about how these experiences as a graduate student helped develop her theories about how capitalism and racism sustained each other. 

During her graduate study on politics, Trask began to engage in feminist studies and considered herself to be a feminist. Later in her career, Trask denounced her identification as a &quot;feminist&quot; because of its mainstream focus on Americans, whiteness, and &quot;First World &#x27;rights&#x27; talk.&quot; She later claimed to align more with transnational feminism.

Trask opposed tourism to Hawaii and the U.S. military&#x27;s presence in Hawaii. She personified paradise (Hawaii) as a woman, helping her claim that protective militarization relies on this sexist imagery. In 2004, Trask spoke out against the Akaka Bill, a bill to establish a process for Native Hawaiians to gain federal recognition similar to the recognition that some Native American tribes possess. Trask believed this bill was an injustice to Native Hawaiian people because it allowed the United States government to control Native Hawaiian governing structure, land, and resources without recognizing Hawaii&#x27;s sovereignty. She clarified that the bill was drafted ex parte and that hearings were withheld to exclude native community involvement.

Trask challenged the traditional understandings of the Asian American, particularly Japanese, experience in Hawaii. She believed the Japanese occupying Hawaii “like to harken back to the oppressions of the plantation era, although few Japanese in Hawaii today actually worked on the plantations during the Territory (1900–1959).” Trask’s critique of Asian settler colonialism is cited as a foundational development in both Asian American and decolonial justice studies.

==Personal life==
Trask&#x27;s longtime partner was University of Hawaii professor David Stannard. Trask came from a politically active family. One of her two sisters, Mililani Trask, is a Hawaiian language immersion teacher, attorney, and a leader of the Hawaiian sovereignty movement. In 1987, Trask founded &quot;Ka Lāhui Hawaii&quot;, one of Hawaii’s largest and most prominent indigenous sovereignty movements with Mililani. Trask descended from the Kahakumakaliua line of Kaua‘i through her father, who was a lawyer, and the Pi‘ilani line of Maui through her mother, who was an elementary school teacher. Her paternal grandfather, David Trask Sr., was chairman of the civil service commission and the police commission in 1922, served as the sheriff of Honolulu from 1923 to 1926, and was elected a territorial senator from Oahu in 1932. He was a key proponent of Hawaii statehood. Trask&#x27;s uncle, Arthur K. Trask, was an attorney, an active member of the Democratic Party, and a member of the Statehood Commission from 1944–1957. David Trask Jr., another uncle, was the head of the Hawaii Government Employees Association.

== Legacy ==
Trask died from cancer on July 3, 2021. In September 2021, the Department of Philosophy at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa issued a posthumous apology to Trask for attacks she received from the university&#x27;s philosophers in the past. In her obituary, the New York Times noted her fight for Indigenous sovereignty and cited her quote, “We will die as Hawaiians. We will never be Americans.”

<text>Runaway Jury is a 2003 American legal thriller film directed by Gary Fleder and starring John Cusack, Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman and Rachel Weisz. 

An adaptation of John Grisham&#x27;s 1996 novel &quot;The Runaway Jury&quot;, the film pits lawyer Wendell Rohr (Hoffman) against shady jury consultant Rankin Fitch (Hackman), who uses unlawful means to stack the jury with people sympathetic to the defense. Meanwhile, a high-stakes cat-and-mouse game begins when juror Nicholas Easter (Cusack) and his girlfriend Marlee (Weisz) appear to be able to sway the jury to deliver any verdict they want in a trial against a gun manufacturer. 

The film was released October 17, 2003.

== Plot ==

In New Orleans, an ex-employee perpetrates a mass shooting at a stock brokerage firm. Eleven people are killed and several wounded. Among the dead is Jacob Wood. Two years later, with attorney Wendell Rohr, Jacob&#x27;s widow Celeste sues Vicksburg Firearms for the company&#x27;s gross negligence that caused her husband&#x27;s death. 

During jury selection, jury consultant Rankin Fitch (revealed to have ties with Vicksburg) and his team communicate background information on the jury pool through electronic surveillance to defense attorney Durwood Cable, who is in the courtroom.

Potential juror Nick Easter attempts to be excused from jury duty. Judge Frederick Harkin refuses, claiming Nick is receiving a lesson in civic duty. Nick&#x27;s congenial manner wins over his fellow jurors, except Frank Herrera, a Marine veteran who dislikes him.

Someone named Marlee calls Fitch and Rohr and makes an offer to deliver the desired verdict to the first bidder. Rohr dismisses the offer, assuming it to be Fitch&#x27;s tactic to obtain a mistrial. Fitch wants proof that she can deliver, which she provides by asking if he &quot;feels patriotic&quot; and having the Juror&#x27;s oath allegiance to the flag. 

By observing the jurors&#x27; behavior through concealed cameras, Fitch identifies Nick as the influencer and orders his apartment searched, but finds nothing. Marlee retaliates by getting one of Fitch&#x27;s jurors bounced, so Fitch blackmails three jurors. 

This leads Rikki Coleman, a juror who wants her abortion to remain secret, to attempt suicide. Fitch also sends his men to find a concealed storage device with key information in Nick&#x27;s apartment, after which they burn it. When Nick shows the judge footage of Fitch&#x27;s men breaking into his apartment, the jury is sequestered.

Rohr&#x27;s key witness, a former Vicksburg employee, does not show up. After confronting Fitch, Rohr decides that he cannot win the case. He asks his firm&#x27;s partners for $10 million to pay Marlee. On principle, Rohr refuses to pay, electing to take his chances against Fitch while keeping his conscience clear. 

After the CEO of Vicksburg Firearms loses his temper under cross-examination, making a bad impression on the jury, Fitch agrees to pay Marlee, to be certain of the verdict. Fitch sends an operative, Janovich, to kidnap Marlee, who fights him off and raises the price to $15 million.

Fitch&#x27;s subordinate Doyle, who is investigating Nick, finds that he is actually Jeff Kerr, a law-school dropout. He travels to Gardner, Indiana, where both Jeff and his law-school girlfriend Gabby (i.e., Marlee) come from. 

Doyle quizzes Gabby&#x27;s mother, who reveals that Gabby&#x27;s sister died in a shooting years before when she was in high school. At the time, the town of Gardner sued the manufacturer of the guns used, and lost; Fitch had helped the defense win the case. Nick and Marlee&#x27;s offer is a setup. Doyle calls Fitch to warn him but is too late, as the money has already been paid.

After receiving confirmation of the payment, Nick asks the other jurors to review the facts, saying they owe it to Celeste Wood to deliberate. This triggers Herrera into a rant against the plaintiff, which undermines any support he had from the other jurors. The gun manufacturer is found liable, with the jury awarding $110 million in general damages to Celeste Wood.

After the trial, Nick and Marlee confront Fitch with a receipt for the $15 million bribe, which they will make public unless he retires. Fitch asks Nick how he got the jury to vote for the plaintiff; Nick replies that he did not, explaining that he stopped Fitch from stealing the trial, merely by getting the jury to vote with their hearts. Nick and Marlee inform an indignant Fitch that the $15 million &quot;fee&quot; will benefit the shooting victims in Gardner, leaving Fitch ranting that if both Nick and Marlee stops, they will both have nothing.

While on his way with Celeste and her son to a celebratory meal, Rohr sees Nick and Marlee watching children play. They exchange acknowledging looks, and Rohr smiles. He leaves as Marlee and Nick decide to return home to Gardner.

== Cast ==

In addition, Dylan McDermott has an uncredited cameo as Jacob Wood, whose murder sets the plot in motion.

== Production ==
The rights to make an adaptation of John Grisham&#x27;s 1996 novel &quot;The Runaway Jury&quot;, were purchased in August 1996 by Arnon Milchan and distribution partner Warner Bros. for a record $8million, including first-look rights to Grisham&#x27;s next novel. Directors slated to helm the picture included Joel Schumacher and Mike Newell, with the lead offered to Edward Norton and Will Smith. After the release of the 1999 film, &quot;The Insider&quot;, which, as does the novel, focuses on big tobacco, the studio decided to make the plaintiff sue a gun company instead in the film adaptation.
This is Gene Hackman&#x27;s and Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s first film together. At the Pasadena Playhouse, they were classmates, and were both voted &quot;Least Likely to Succeed.&quot;

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Runaway Jury&quot; grossed $49.4million domestically (United States and Canada) and $30.7million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $80.2million, against a budget of $60million. It opened at No. 3, in its first of four consecutive weeks in the Top10 at the domestic box office.

=== Critical response ===

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, and stated that the plot to sell the jury to the highest-bidding party was the most ingenious device in the story, because it avoided pitting the &quot;evil&quot; and the &quot;good&quot; protagonists directly against each other in a stereotypical manner, but it plunged both of them into a moral abyss.

<doc id="752157" wikidata="Q1429126" url="?curid=752157" title="Glassboro Summit Conference">
<text>The Glassboro Summit Conference, usually just called the Glassboro Summit, was the 23–25 June 1967 meeting of the heads of government of the United States and the Soviet Union—President Lyndon B. Johnson and Premier Alexei Kosygin, respectively—for the purpose of discussing Soviet Union–United States relations in Glassboro, New Jersey. During the Arab–Israeli Six-Day War diplomatic contact and cooperation increased, leading some to hope for an improvement in the two countries&#x27; relations. Some even hoped for joint cooperation on the Vietnam War. Although Johnson and Kosygin failed to reach agreement on anything important, the generally amicable atmosphere of the summit was referred to as the &quot;Spirit of Glassboro&quot; and is seen to have improved Soviet–US relations.

==Background==

With the United States gradually losing ground in the Vietnam War, the administration was looking for other solutions to the conflict.

On 5 June 1967 the Six-Day War began between Israel and the Arab states. The war led to an increase in Soviet-US diplomatic contact and cooperation; there were some who hoped this could continue to help the US solve the Vietnam War and other pressing international issues. On 10 June 1967, Premier Alexei Kosygin wrote a letter to contact President Lyndon B. Johnson. The &quot;hot line&quot; message arrived at the White House to seek communication between the United States and the Soviet Union. Alexei Kosygin gives a quick explanation of what the Soviet Union and United States should do in regards to the Middle Eastern Crisis. In the message Alexei Kosygin writes:

Several days later the Soviet Union sent Premier Alexei Kosygin to New York City to deliver a speech on the then-ongoing Middle Eastern crisis at the United Nations headquarters. When the United States government was informed of this the Americans gladly welcomed Kosygin to a meeting between him and President Lyndon B. Johnson. On 13 June 1967 Johnson sought out J. William Fulbright, a Senator, at a White House reception. Llewellyn Thompson, then US ambassador to the USSR, believed that a conference could &quot;start the process of moving toward an understanding with the Soviets&quot;. Fulbright even believed that Johnson was reconsidering his Vietnam strategy. Later Fulbright wrote two letters to Johnson about the importance of a summit between the two nations. Johnson agreed, and wrote a letter in return, which said they were waiting for a Soviet response for US invitation. Walt Rostow, the National Security Advisor at the time, said it was a 20 percent chance of the summit having a good effect on Soviet–US relations, and only a 10 percent chance of the summit going awry.

The Soviet Political Bureau (Politburo) were divided over the usefulness of the summit. Andrei Gromyko, the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time and still not a member of the Politburo, was able to win support for it. Gromyko noted that Soviet-US dialogue which had been suspended in 1963 should be reactivated, despite the Vietnam War putting a great deal strain on the two countries&#x27; relations.

Kosygin had agreed to address the United Nations and as such, wished to conduct the summit in New York. Johnson, wary of encountering protesters against the war in Vietnam, preferred to meet in Washington, D.C. Roughly equidistant, Hollybush, the residence of the President of Glassboro State College (now Rowan University) in Glassboro, New Jersey was selected as a compromise.

==The summit==
===Vietnam War===

In their first meeting held on 23 June 1967 there were only four people present, Alexei Kosygin and Lyndon B. Johnson and their respective interpreters. The main subjects discussed between the two was the ongoing crisis in the Middle East and the Soviet-US arms race. Towards the end of the meeting, Johnson said he was willing to discuss a peace settlement regarding war in Vietnam; literally meaning dividing the country in half, one part communist another part capitalist. He assured Kosygin that the only reason for American bombing in North Vietnam was because of North Vietnamese intervention into South Vietnam. Johnson offered the Soviets to supervise the democratic election in South Vietnam in the aftermath of the war. Kosygin responded by returning to the original subject; the crisis in the Middle East. During their afternoon meeting, Kosygin told Johnson that he was recently in contact with Phạm Văn Đồng, the Prime Minister of North Vietnam, and that they had discussed the possibilities on putting an end to the war. The North Vietnamese reply came during Kosygin&#x27;s lunch with Johnson. Kosygin compared the Vietnam War with the Algerian War which ended when Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s France signed a peace treaty signifying the end of French colonisation of Algeria; he believed this would happen to the United States if the war continued. He also made it very clear that the North Vietnamese would not give up their goal of a unified Vietnam that easily.

Johnson was worried of North Vietnamese betrayal, saying he would be &quot;crucified&quot; politically in the United States if the North Vietnamese decided to send their troops into South Vietnam if and when the United States stopped bombing them. Kosygin said, relieving Johnson of his worries, that a North Vietnamese delegation could meet anywhere in the world to discuss a peace settlement with the Americans.

==The Spirit of Glassboro==
The two world leaders met for three days, from 23 June to 25 June 1967, at Hollybush Mansion, home of the college president. Although Johnson and Kosygin failed to reach agreement on limiting anti-ballistic missile systems, the generally amicable atmosphere of the summit was referred to as the &quot;Spirit of Glassboro&quot;.

<text>William Louis Petersen (born February 21, 1953) is an American actor. He is best known for his role as Gil Grissom in the CBS drama thriller series &quot;&quot; (2000–2015), for which he won a Screen Actors Guild Award and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award; he was further nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards as a producer of the show. He reprised his role as Gil Grissom in the sequel &quot;&quot;, which premiered on October 6, 2021.

He also starred in the films &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot; (1985), &quot;Manhunter&quot; (1986), &quot;Young Guns II&quot; (1990), &quot;Fear&quot; (1996), &quot;The Contender&quot; (2000), &quot;Detachment&quot; (2011), and &quot;Seeking a Friend for the End of the World&quot; (2012).

== Early life ==
Petersen was born in Evanston, Illinois, the youngest of six children of June (née Hoene; 1909–2006) and Arthur Edward Petersen (1907–2004), who worked in the furniture business. Of Danish and German descent, he was raised in the Roman Catholic faith of his mother. He has two brothers, Arthur Jr. and Robert, and three sisters, Anne, Mary Kay, and Elizabeth.

He graduated from Bishop Kelly High School in Boise, Idaho, in 1972. He was accepted to Idaho State University on a football scholarship. While at Idaho State, Petersen took an acting course, which changed the direction of his life. He left school along with his wife, Joanne, in 1974, and followed a drama professor to the Basque country, where he studied as a Shakespearean actor. Petersen was interested in Basque culture: He studied the Basque language and gave his daughter the Basque name &quot;Maite Nerea&quot; (&quot;My Beloved&quot;); she was born in Arrasate/Mondragón in 1975. Petersen returned to Idaho with the intention of being an actor. Not wanting to work a nonacting job in Idaho, he returned to the Chicago area, living with relatives. He became active in the theater and earned his Actors&#x27; Equity card. He performed with the Steppenwolf Theatre Company, of which he has been an ensemble member since 2008, and was a co-founder of the Remains Theater Ensemble, which also included other prominent Chicago actors Gary Cole and Ted Levine.

== Career ==
Petersen made his film debut with a bit part in &quot;Thief&quot; (1981), directed by Michael Mann. The actor received his first break when he played a Secret Service agent gone rogue to avenge his mentor in William Friedkin&#x27;s 1985 action film &quot;To Live and Die in L.A.&quot; In 1986, he played FBI agent Will Graham in the first Hannibal Lecter film, &quot;Manhunter&quot;. Because his role was so emotionally exhausting, he did everything he could to rid himself of Graham after finishing principal photography. He shaved off his beard, cut his hair, and bleached it blond. He also claims to have done this because, while rehearsing for a play in Chicago, his dialogue was always coming out like Graham&#x27;s; he dyed his hair so he could look in the mirror and see a different person.

He declined a part in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Platoon&quot;, as it would have kept him in the Philippines, away from his family. Instead, he worked on the 1987 HBO made-for-TV movie &quot;Long Gone&quot; as a minor league baseball player and manager named Cecil &quot;Stud&quot; Cantrell. Petersen was offered the role of Henry Hill in the film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, but turned it down. An exposé about the film in the May 2015 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; claims that Petersen turned down the audition altogether. In a 1990 ABC three-part miniseries, &quot;The Kennedys of Massachusetts&quot;, Petersen played U.S. President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s father, Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy. The film won an Emmy and a Golden Globe from eight and two nominations, respectively. Also in 1990, Petersen portrayed the infamous Patrick Floyd &quot;Pat&quot; Garrett in &quot;Young Guns II&quot;.

In 1993, Petersen appeared in a CBS TV miniseries, &quot;Return to Lonesome Dove&quot;, as former Ranger Gideon Walker. He played Steven Walker, a father who stops at nothing to break up the relationship between his daughter and her vicious boyfriend in &quot;Fear&quot; (1996). Petersen played Governor Jack Hathaway, an unscrupulous candidate for vice president following the death of the incumbent, in &quot;The Contender&quot; in 2000.

He appeared uncredited in the noir thriller &quot;Mulholland Falls&quot; as a character who finds himself on the violent receiving end of a Los Angeles police squad&#x27;s tactics. In 1999, he starred in &quot;Kiss the Sky&quot; as &quot;Jeff.&quot; He appeared as part of an all-star cast in a remake of the 1997 film &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (as Juror #12, a.k.a. &quot;the Snob&quot;).

From 2000 to 2009, he played Dr. Gil Grissom in the CBS crime drama &quot;&quot;. Petersen took a break from &quot;CSI&quot; in 2006 to appear in a five-week run of the Trinity Repertory Company production of &quot;Dublin Carol&quot; by Conor McPherson, in Providence, Rhode Island. Petersen renewed his contract with CBS to appear on &quot;CSI&quot; for the 2008–09 season, reportedly for $600,000 per episode. On July 15, 2008, the Associated Press reported that Petersen was leaving the show as a regular following Season 9&#x27;s tenth episode in order to pursue more stage-acting opportunities, but that he might return for guest spots. He remained an executive producer of the show. He reprised his role of Gil Grissom in the eleventh-season episode &quot;The Two Mrs. Grissoms&quot; (aired February 3, 2011). He came back in 2015 as a guest in the series finale, &quot;Immortality.&quot;

In February 2020, Petersen was announced to return for a &quot;CSI&quot; sequel series along with Jorja Fox, before the series was picked up as &quot;&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1975, Petersen and his then-wife Joanne Brady welcomed a daughter, Maite. In June 2003, Petersen married his longtime girlfriend Gina Cirone. On July 5, 2011, Petersen and Cirone welcomed twins, a daughter and son, via surrogate.

Peterson is an avid Chicago Cubs fan. In 2004, he described to &quot;Playboy&quot; a near-death experience he had in the 1980s which gave him &quot;assurance&quot; that there is an afterlife.

In August 2021, Petersen was taken to the hospital via ambulance after feeling unwell on the set of &quot;&quot;. He was experiencing symptoms of exhaustion after 12 weeks of shooting, and released from the facility soon after.

== Honors ==
On February 3, 2009, Petersen received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Its file formats and procedures are similar to of those in some IBM access methods for several of its mainframe computer operating systems and by other vendors for file and record management. VMS RMS is an integral part of the system software; its procedures run in executive mode. (RMS was not initially integrated into RT-11 and RSTS/E, but was available as an added charge &quot;layered product&quot;. It was later added to RSTS/E and was a part of its standard documentation set.)

RMS supports four record access methods:
* Sequential Access
* Relative Record Number Access
* Record File Address Access
* Indexed Access

RMS supports four record formats:
* Fixed length
* Variable length
* Variable record length with fixed-length control blocks
* Stream files (records separated by termination characters)
** STREAM: Records terminated by CRLF
** STREAM_CR: Records terminated by CR
** STREAM_LF: Records terminated by LF

Digital provided the File Definition Language (FDL) which could be used to define the structure of an RMS file.

<text>The Government House Leader, officially known as the leader of the Government in the House of Commons of Canada (), is the Cabinet minister responsible for planning and managing the government&#x27;s legislative program in the House of Commons of Canada. Despite the name of the position it does not refer to the prime minister of Canada, who is the head of government.

== History ==
From 1867 until World War II, prime ministers took upon themselves the responsibilities of being leader of the government in the House of Commons, organizing and coordinating House of Commons business with the other parties. The expansion of government responsibilities during the war led to Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King deciding to delegate the House leadership to one of his ministers. In 1946, the position of government house leader was formally recognized.

In 1968, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau designated the government house leader as president of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada. Under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the roles of government house leader and president of the Privy Council were separated in 1989. Under Mulroney and his successors, the position of house leader would often be held by someone who was named a minister of state without any portfolio responsibilities specified. Since 2003, this minister of state status has been obscured in all but the most official circumstances by the use of a &quot;Leader of the Government in the House of Commons&quot; style in its place.

Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s first House Leader, Jacques Saada was also the minister responsible for democratic reform; however, with the election of a minority government in the 2004 election, Martin appointed Tony Valeri to the position of leader of the government in the House of Commons with no additional responsibilities.

==List of officeholders==
Until 2005, the position of government house leader was not technically a cabinet-level post, but rather a parliamentary office, so to qualify for cabinet membership, an individual had to be named to cabinet in some other capacity. For a time, with the position having evolved into a full-time job, government house leaders have been named to cabinet as ministers of state with no portfolio specified. The Martin government created these positions so that the minister of state title is effectively invisible. An amendment to the &quot;Salaries Act&quot; made this unnecessary by listing the government house leader as a minister.

<text>Mare Desiderii (Latin &quot;dēsīderiī&quot;, the &quot;Sea of Desires&quot;) was an area of the Moon named after Luna 3 returned the first pictures of the far side in 1959. 

Early publications of the Luna 3 image referred to the Mare as Mechta, the Russian word for dream. Mechta was an alternate name for the Luna 1 spacecraft. The feature was also called the Dream Sea or the Sea of Dreams. Other references called it Mare Somnii, Latin for the Sea of Dreams.

It was later determined to be an optical illusion in the low quality image. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) removed the name from the list of lunar nomenclature in 1960. Instead this area includes a smaller mare, Mare Ingenii (Sea of Ingenuity or Cleverness), and other dark craters overlapping with the South Pole-Aitken Basin.

The naming of this and other features by the Soviet Union was considered controversial at the time. The newly named places on Soviet lunar maps were perceived as an extension of Soviet territory. The IAU was then given the responsibility for naming newly discovered features.

<text>José Martín Antonio Gautier Benítez (April 12, 1848 – January 24, 1880) was a Puerto Rican poet of the Romantic Era.

==Early years==
Gautier Benítez was born in Caguas, Puerto Rico to Rodulfo Gautier and the Puerto Rican poet, Alejandrina Benitez de Gautier. His great-aunt, María Bibiana Benítez, was also a well known Puerto Rican poet. He was mostly influenced by the exponents of the Romantic poetry of the 19th century. His great-great-uncle was José Benítez, mayor of Ponce in 1800.

Gautier Benítez&#x27;s father wanted him to take up a military career and so in 1865, he was sent to military school in San Juan. When he graduated, he went to Madrid, Spain, where he continued his military education.

When Gautier Benítez returned to Puerto Rico from Spain, he found a job in the provincial government office. According to his military records, between September 26 and November 8 of 1868, Gautier Benítez fought against the members of the &quot;Revolution Committee of Puerto Rico&quot; involved in &quot;El Grito de Lares&quot;, a short lived independence revolt against Spanish rule in Puerto Rico.

In 1873 he joined the Liberal Reformist Party and became a principal force behind the creation of the &quot;Ateneo Puertorriqueño&quot;. In 1878 he became the co-founder, along with his friend Manuel de Elzabura, of the &quot;Puerto Rican Review&quot;. That same year he wrote his first poem &quot;A Puerto Rico&quot; (To Puerto Rico), was highly acclaimed by his contemporaries as one of his greatest works. &quot;A Puerto Rico&quot; also received an award from the &quot;Ateneo&quot;.

==Later years==
In 1879, Gautier Benítez&#x27;s mother, Alejandrina, died and he also became terminally ill with tuberculosis. He retired to his house where he would live until he died. Gautier Benítez died in San Juan, aged 32 years of age and is laid to rest in Santa Maria Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in Old San Juan. Gautier Benítez&#x27;s verses, entitled &quot;Poemas&quot; (Poems) were published posthumously in 1880.

==Poems by Gautier Benítez==

Among his works are: &quot;A Puerto Rico (Ausencia)&quot; (To Puerto Rico (Absence)), &quot;A Puerto Rico (Regreso)&quot; (To Puerto Rico (Return)) and the following:.

*Americana
*Como Tu Quieras
*Deber De Amar
*El Manzanillo
*El Poeta
*Ella y Yo
*Enfermo
*INSOMNIO
*La Barca
*La Nave
*Las Aves De Paso
*Los Ojos De T.
*Oriental
*Romance
*Un Encargo A Mis Amigos
*Un Sueño
*Zoraida

==Legacy and honors==
The city of Caguas named a high school and public housing project after Gautier Benítez. The island–municipality of Vieques honored him by naming its public library the &quot;José Gautier Benítez Public Library&quot;. In the municipality of Hatillo an elementary school was named after him. The song &quot;Lamento Borincano&quot;, from Rafael Hernández mentions Gautier Benítez in it &quot;Borinquen, la tierra del edén. La que al cantar, el gran Gautier llamó la perla de los mares.&quot; In 2019 construction began on the José Gautier Benítez Development, a mixed-income residential area in Caguas.

<doc id="752192" wikidata="Q16843899" url="?curid=752192" title="History of the Scots Guards (1805–1913)">
<text>This article details the history of the Scots Guards from 1805 to 1913. The Scots Guards (SG) is a regiment of the Guards Division of the British Army.

==Pre-Napoleonic wars history==

The Scots Guards trace their origins back to 1642 when, by order of Charles I, the regiment was raised by Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll for service in Ireland, and was known as the Marquis of Argyll&#x27;s Royal Regiment. After serving with the King in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the regiment was dispersed, but was reformed after the Restoration of the Monarchy as the Scottish Regiment of Foot Guards in 1662. In 1686, the regiment was brought on to the establishment of the English Army and was renamed by Queen Anne as the Third Regiment of Foot Guards.

==The Napoleonic Wars==
In 1804, the United Kingdom&#x27;s nemesis, Napoleon Bonaparte, became Emperor of the French. The following year the Third Coalition was formed against France and the 1st Battalion took part in the expedition to Hannover in 1805 at a time when Napoleon&#x27;s armies burnt across the continent. In 1806 the Fourth Coalition against France was created and the following year the 1st Battalion took part in the second Battle of Copenhagen in Denmark, an expedition intended to prevent the Danish Fleet falling into the hands of the French. A combined British and Hannoverian Army under General Lord Cathcart besieged the Danish city while the Royal Navy bombarded the city. The operation was a success and the Danes surrendered their fleet of eighteen warships to the British.

In 1809 the Fifth Coalition was formed against France, though this was much smaller than previous coalitions, consisting of just Austria and the United Kingdom. That same year the 1st Battalion made its way to the Iberian Peninsula where it was to take part in the Peninsular War in Portugal and Spain. On 12 May, the 1st Battalion took part in the crossing of the River Douro, an operation that ended so successfully that the French Army were in full retreat to Amarante after the actions in Oporto and its surrounding areas.

In late July, the 3rd Foot Guards took part in the Battle of Talavera, one of the bloodiest and most bitter of engagements during the war. The British were commanded by Lieutenant-General Arthur Wellesley, a man who gained immortal fame in the history of the British Army, and would soon gain the honour Duke of Wellington for Talavera. The British-Spanish Army numbered about 50,000 and the 1st Battalion was part of the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division, while the French numbered over 40,000. The battle that ensued was ferocious, with the British defenders receiving the first attack on the night of 27 July, an attack that nearly forced the British off the Cerro de Medellin, a hill to the left of the 3rd Foot Guards&#x27; position, but a counter-attack successfully repulsed the French. In the early hours of 28 July the French attacked once more, meeting stiff resistance from the British defenders. At the Cerro position, the British poured a relentless and overwhelming fire into the advancing French formations, and repulsed the French, inflicting heavy casualties on them. Further French attacks took place, at one point, the Foot Guards distinguished themselves greatly when they poured a devastating fire into the French ranks, though the Guards advanced after the fleeing French and in doing so became the target of a French artillery battery and French infantry who duly ripped into the Guards, causing hundreds of casualties. However, despite suffering terribly, the Guards managed to reform and, along with other infantry battalions, commenced yet another professional and overwhelming fire to repulse a large French counter-attack, which caused quite horrific casualties for the French. The Battle of Talavera was bloody and ended in victory for the British though at a terrible price, with over 5,000 men being killed or wounded, while their French opponents lost over 7,000 men. For its role in the battle, the regiment won its fifth battle honour.

Also that year, the 2nd Battalion&#x27;s flank companies took part in the disastrous Walcheren Expedition in the Low Countries, a campaign that would suffer many casualties from disease rather than the bullet of an enemy, through Walcheren Fever, which affected the troops that suffered from it so severely that many thousands of the troops still suffered from it years afterwards, and led to the Duke of Wellington stating that he did not want any unit that served in the Walcheren Campaign to serve with him.

In 1810, the 1st Battalion took part in the Battle of Buçaco in which a British-Portuguese Army of about 50,000 soundly defeated a numerically superior French force before marching to the Lines of Torres Vedras, a series of trenches and redoubts designed to protect Lisbon, and where the British again defeated the French, forcing the French Army to withdraw. The following year, in March, companies of the 2nd Battalion, who were now deployed to the Peninsula, took part in the Battle of Barrosa in an attempt to lift the siege of Cadiz, and soundly defeated the French relatively quickly, and for its actions, won the regiment its sixth battle honour.

In May 1811, the 1st Battalion took part in the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro which ended in yet another British victory and gained the regiment its seventh battle honour. The following year, in January, the 1st Battalion took part in the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo. The fortress of Ciudad Rodrigo was one of the two important French held fortresses (the other being Badajoz) and the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo began on 8 January. Despite their more privileged nature as an elite force in comparison to the normal infantry, the Guards still helped in the digging of trenches, an arduous duty made especially more by the absolutely terrible weather. When the assault on Ciudad Rodrigo finally happened on 19 January 1812 it was bloody, with fierce and chaotic hand-to-hand fighting taking place at the two breaches made in the walls of the fortress. The casualties were heavy for the British, with over 500 being killed, wounded or missing during the assault and over 1,000 casualties in total for the siege, though despite this, the British took Ciudad Rodrigo.

In July, the 1st Battalion took part in the Battle of Salamanca, a decisive victory for the British, and then subsequently took part in the Siege of Burgos which ended in October. In 1813, the 2nd Battalion took part in an expedition to the Low Countries, while back in Spain, the 1st Battalion took part in the Battle of Vittoria in which the British and Allied forces won a resounding victory over the French, as well as at the bloody Siege of San Sebastian, where the British besieged San Sebastián from July to August, after two bloody assaults by the British troops. After fighting so hard against the French in Portugal and Spain, in late 1813, the British finally pushed into France itself, where the 1st Battalion took part in a number of successful engagements, including at Nive. Napoleon would eventually abdicate in April 1814.

In March 1815, Napoleon returned to France from his exile in Elba, eventually retaking France from Louis XVIII. The 2nd Battalion, 3rd Foot Guards, who were stationed in what is present-day Belgium, took part in, on 18 June, one of the most famous battles in history, Waterloo. The battalion was part of the two battalion 2nd Guards Brigade, under the command of Major-General Sir John Byng, the other battalion being the 2nd Battalion of the Coldstream Regiment of Foot Guards. The 3rd Foot Guards were positioned on the ridge just behind Hougoumont Farm under the command of Second Major Francis Hepburn, while the light companies of the two battalions, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel James Macdonnell, garrisoned the Farm, a place, on the right flank of the British and Allied army, that would be a key position during the battle.

Just after 11:00am, the battle commenced, with a French division, under the command of Prince Jérôme Bonaparte, beginning the assault on Hougoumont, with the Farm coming under heavy artillery fire. The French assaulted the farm, but the Guards&#x27; stout defense repulsed the first French attack. A second attack happened, and during that attack, the French attempted to push through the main gate. Despite the gallant efforts of the British Guardsmen to shut it, a few dozen French troops broke through before the Guardsmen managed to shut the main gate once more. What followed was a fierce hand-to-hand fight between the Guardsmen and French, until eventually all the French, minus a drummer boy who was spared by the Guardsmen, were killed.

The third attack came from the east of the farm, at the orchard. A few companies of the 3rd Guards subsequently confronted the French troops and, after some hard fighting, drove them from the orchard and back into the woods. The fourth attack soon came, this time with the use of a fearsome howitzer, and thus, the Grenadier Company of the 3rd Guards was sent into the woods to destroy the howitzer, but were faced with a superior French force and were forced out of the woods. The 3rd Guards were then sent to repulse the French from the orchard which they duly did, driving the French back into the woods once more.

Further attacks occurred on the farm, and the gallant defenders never wilted in the face of such French attacks, and held the farm against all odds; even when the farm was set ablaze by howitzer fire, the defenders still repulsed all French attacks. The elite Guards had proven their professionalism and valour once more in the field, and contributed greatly to the British and Allied victory at Waterloo, gaining the praise of the Duke of Wellington in the process. The defenders of Hougoumont suffered over 1,000 men killed or wounded during the Battle for Hougoumont, with the 3rd Guards suffering well over 200 men killed or wounded; while the French suffered many thousands of casualties in their numerous attempts to capture the farm. Napoleon was defeated and as before, he was exiled, this time to the British territory of St. Helena, where he would remain until his death in 1821.

The 2nd Battalion then joined the Army of Occupation in France where they would remain until 1816 when they returned home to the UK. In 1824, both battalions of the 3rd Foot Guards deployed to Dublin, Ireland, and in 1826, the 2nd Battalion deployed to Portugal until returning home in 1828. Also in 1826, the 1st Battalion deployed to Manchester during troubles there. In 1830, William IV ascended to the throne, and the following year gave the regiment a new name, the Scots Fusilier Guards.

==Crimean War==

In 1854, the Crimean War began, which pitted the United Kingdom, France and the Ottoman Empire against the Russian Empire. The 1st Battalion of the Scots Fusilier Guards were dispatched as part of the Guards Brigade to the East, being deployed to Malta, Bulgaria and Turkey, before, in September, the British finally landed in the Crimea, at a place called Calamity Bay. The British and their French allies then began the advance on Sevastopol, a Russian naval base, but was blocked at the River Alma by Russian forces. And here came the Battalion&#x27;s first engagement at the Battle of Alma, an action that saw chaotic and heavy hand-to-hand combat between the British and Russians. The road to Sevastopol runs through a gap between two hills, one to the east, known as Kourgane Hill and the other to the west, known as Telegraph Hill. On Kourgane Hill there consisted two earthworks, one known as the &#x27;Great Redoubt&#x27; on the western side of the hill, while the other was on the eastern side, known as the &#x27;Lesser Redoubt&#x27;.

A British unit, known as the Light Division, made its advance, making steady progress on the Great Redoubt, and took it with very heavy casualties; however chaos soon set in, after a confusing order from an unknown officer during a Russian counter-attack was soon contradicted by other officers, and the British duly fell back. The Scots Fusilier Guards, in the center of the Guards Brigade, part of the 1st Division, were supporting the Light Division, though had only just crossed the River Alma by the time the Great Redoubt was taken. One brave group of Royal Welch Fusiliers had held their ground and were firing into the Russians until confronted by a mass of Russian soldiers, forcing them to retreat rapidly, and in the process, smashed straight into the formation of the advancing Scots Fusiliers Guards, causing immense chaos. The Russians seized their opportunity to strike, launching a large-scale bayonet charge on the regiment, resulting in brutal carnage, eventually forcing the regiment to reluctantly withdraw, suffering over 150 casualties. During this chaos, the Colour party of the regiment, whose Colours had been shot through, held its ground against the overwhelming Russian force, and safeguarded the Colours from the Russians, as well as helping to rally the regiment. The Russians attempted to exploit the chaos when a large Russian force advanced on the Brigade of Guards, but the Guards poured a withering and accurate fire into the Russians, causing very heavy casualties. The British, including men of the battered Scots Fusilier Guards, subsequently advancing, causing the Russians to flee which allowed the British to re-take the Great Redoubt. Further heroics occurred on the right, with the Highland Brigade, just two lines deep, firing, while advancing, on the Russians who soon fled from the spirited Highland Brigade. The Battle had been bloody, with the British losing more than 2,000 casualties while the Russians suffered 6,000. For their actions at Alma, the Scots Fusilier Guards won a battle honour and four men of the regiment would later win the Victoria Cross, an award created in 1856 to become the highest award for valour in the face of the enemy. These men were Captain Robert James Lindsay, Sergeants John Knox and James McKechnie, as well as Private William Reynolds.

In 1855, the regiment took part in another bloody engagement, at the Battle of Inkerman, at a place known to the British as Mount Inkerman. The British, and their French allies, were attacked by numerically superior Russian troops, hoping to break the Siege of Sevastopol. The attack happened in very thick mist and despite having weak defences and being outnumbered severely, the British defended stoutly against the Russians. The first Russian attacks was completely devastated by the accurate fire of the badly outnumbered British defenders. The Guards helped defend the right of the British defenders, and at Sandbag Battery, performed valiantly in the face of overwhelming Russian numbers, and despite the difficulties the Guards faced, they overcame them and devastated the Russian forces assaulting the Sandbag Battery. The Battle of Inkerman was a victory that had been filled with dreadfully brutal hand-to-hand combat, that, at times, resembled the battles of a far more primitive age, and saw over 2,000 British soldiers killed or wounded out of over 8,000 that took part in the battle, with the Russians suffering over 11,000 casualties. The regiment won its thirteenth battle honour for its part at Inkerman.

The Scots Fusilier Guards also took part in the arduous Siege of Sevastopol, which lasted from September 1854 to September the following year, when it was captured by the British. The Crimean War would end in 1856 with the Treaty of Paris, with the Scots Fusilier Guards returning home to the UK that same year.

==Distant troubles==

In 1862, the 2nd Battalion landed in the then-colony of New Brunswick to reinforce the garrison there during increased tensions with the United States during the American Civil War. The battalion departed in 1864, while the American Civil War still raged, and returned home to the UK. In 1877 Queen Victoria, changed the regiment&#x27;s name to the now more familiar Scots Guards. In 1881, the 1st Battalion deployed to Dublin, Ireland and the following year the battalion, as part of the Guard Brigade, took part in an expedition to Egypt, which came about in response to a revolt led by Urabi Pasha, an Egyptian military officer. A 25,000 strong British force, under the command of Sir Garnet Wolseley, landed in Egypt in August, and on 13 September, the decisive engagement of the campaign occurred, the Battle of Tel el-Kebir, which ended in victory for the British, and culminated with the taking of Cairo and the capture of Urabi Pasha. The Scots Guards gained the battle honours &quot;Tel-el-Kebir&quot; and &quot;Egypt 1882&quot; for taking part in the Egyptian Expedition, and it was the last time the regiment carried the Colours into war.

In 1885, the 2nd Battalion took part in the Suakin Expedition to the Sudan, including the Battle of Hasheen, and gained the battle honour Suakin 1885 for their part in the campaign. The battalion returned home to the UK in late 1885 and took part in Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Military Review in 1887. In 1887, a proposal to convert the 1st Battalion Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders into the 3rd Battalion of the Scots Guards was dropped after concerted lobbying by the Camerons. In 1895, the 2nd Battalion of the regiment deployed to Dublin and returned to its barracks in London in 1897, with the 1st Battalion deploying to Dublin that same year.

In 1899, war broke out between the British Empire and the Dutch Boer Republics, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. The 1st Battalion soon departed Ireland for South Africa to join up with the 1st Guards Brigade, and reached that country in November. The battalion quickly saw its first engagements in November, at Belmont, which ended in a British victory, and at the Battle of Modder River, another British victory, though it had come at a heavy cost in British life after the British forces had come under a terrible withering fire from the Boer defenders, but the Boers eventually withdrew; the Scots Guards gained a battle honour for their part in the battle. In December, the battalion took part in its first major engagement of the war at the Battle of Magersfontein. The Boers, well defended in their positions, poured a terrible fire into the attacking British, causing very heavy casualties, with the battle ending in a defeat for the British who had battled bravely against the Boers, and ending the attempts to relieve the town of Kimberley which was besieged by Boer forces; the siege would not to be lifted until February 1900. Also in 1899, the 3rd Battalion of the regiment was raised in London, though would not see overseas service in South Africa.

In 1900, the 2nd Battalion departed the UK for South Africa, landing there in April, whereupon it joined the 16th Infantry Brigade. The Scots Guards then saw action at another major battle, at the Battle of Paardeberg, which lasted for a number of days in February, though the Boers there were eventually defeated when the Boer leader Piet Cronje surrendered. The following month, the regiment took part in the Battle of Driefontein and in May, the 2nd Battalion took part in a small engagement at Biddulphsberg and on 31 May, the regiment was present at the capture of Johannesburg. During its time in Africa, the regiment performed a variety of duties, including manning blockhouses, rather than just its involvement in the many battles of the war. In June 1902, the British and their Commonwealth Allies triumphed over the Boers, after suffering dreadful casualties, appalling conditions and the terrible fighting they took part in against their tough adversary, the Boers. Following the end of the war the battalion returned home, leaving Cape Town in and &quot;Michigan&quot; in September 1902, arriving at Southampton early the following month. They had proved their professionalism once more to the world, and returned to the usual public duties that accompany the Guards.

Elsewhere, in 1901, the regiment gained its first Colonel-in-Chief, Edward VII, with the other Guards regiments also gaining the King as their Colonel-in-Chief. In 1906 the 3rd Battalion of the regiment was disbanded due to changes in the British Army. In 1910, Edward VII died and both battalions of the Scots Guards performed a variety of duties during the sad time, including lining the route of the procession. That same year the regiment gained its second Colonel-in-Chief, the newly crowned George V. In 1911, small detachments of the Scots Guards were involved in a decidedly unpleasant event, the Siege of Sidney Street. In 1910 a group of Latvian anarchists had attempted to rob a jewellers shop in Houndsditch in December 1910, and it had ended in the murder of three policemen and two being seriously wounded. A number of the gang were soon captured and on 1 January 1911, an informant had told the police that a small number of the gang were residing in 100 Sidney Street. On 3 January, after some fighting, the street was cordoned off to prevent the gang from escaping and, as the police were inadequately armed to fight the gang who had superior weapons, small detachments of the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards were called to the scene. Continuous gunfire raged between the police and Guardsmen and the small gang for the duration of the siege. Eventually, a fire began and soon afterwards two badly burnt members of the anarchist gang were discovered; one had been shot. Later that year, the regiment departed the UK for Egypt and returned home in 1913.

<text>Matt Helm is a fictional character created by American author Donald Hamilton (1916–2006). Helm is a U.S. government counter-agent, a man whose primary job is to kill or nullify enemy agents—not a spy or secret agent in the ordinary sense of the term as used in most spy thrillers.

Helm appeared in 27 adventure/suspense novels by Hamilton, first published in 1960, and the character was later adapted into film, television and other media.

==The character and the books==
Published between 1960 and 1993, the 27 books in the series portrayed Helm, who acquired the code name &quot;Eric&quot; during his secret wartime assignments, as jaded, ruthless, pragmatic, and competent. The series was noted for its between-books continuity, which was somewhat rare for the genre. In the later books, Helm&#x27;s origins as a man of action in World War II disappeared and he became an apparently ageless character, a common fate of long-running fictional heroes.

The first book in the series, &quot;Death of a Citizen,&quot; takes place in the summer of 1958, 13 years after the end of the war. In the book, other characters describe Helm as verging on middle age and apparently soft and out of shape, although no specific age for him is given. In the next story, which apparently takes place in the summer of 1959, a hostile agent from a rival American spy organization taunts Helm as a shopworn 36-year-old and clearly over the hill as a physical specimen. Later in the book, Helm himself says that he is 36 years old. Writer Hayford Peirce examined the issue of Helm&#x27;s age, and found this figure to be improbably young given the information about Helm&#x27;s background in &quot;Death of a Citizen.&quot; Peirce postulated that Helm was actually several years older than the 36 years mentioned in &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot; and that he was probably born around 1918. By &quot;The Betrayers&quot;, the tenth book, the age issue vanishes completely.

Critic Anthony Boucher wrote: &quot;Donald Hamilton has brought to the spy novel the authentic hard realism of Dashiell Hammett; and his stories are as compelling, and probably as close to the sordid truth of espionage, as any now being told.&quot; Golden Age mystery writer John Dickson Carr, who began reviewing books for &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; in 1969, &quot;found Donald Hamilton&#x27;s Matt Helm to be &#x27;my favorite secret agent,&#x27;&quot; wrote Carr&#x27;s biographer, noting that Hamilton&#x27;s books had little in common with Carr&#x27;s. &quot;The explanation may lie in Carr&#x27;s comment that in espionage novels he preferred Matt Helm&#x27;s &#x27;cloud-cuckooland&#x27;. Carr never valued realism in fiction.&quot;

These titles have since been republished by Titan Books.

==Matt Helm in other media==

In 1965, Columbia Pictures acquired the film rights to eight Matt Helm novels. A five-film parody or spoof spy movie series was planned and four were produced, debuting with &quot;The Silencers&quot; (from Hamilton&#x27;s novels &quot;The Silencers&quot; and &quot;Death of a Citizen&quot;, adapted by acclaimed &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; screenwriter Oscar Saul). The series was produced by Irving Allen, former partner of James Bond film producer Albert R. Broccoli. They were made to star Dean Martin, who co-produced them with his Meadway-Claude Production company and received a share of the profits. 

The films used the name Matt Helm, his cover identity, plus book titles and some very loose plot elements, but otherwise the series bore no resemblance to the character, atmosphere, or themes of Hamilton&#x27;s original books, nor to the hard-edged action of Bond.

Martin played the part with his own persona of a fun-loving, easygoing, wisecracking playboy with plenty of references to singing and alcohol consumption. Helm&#x27;s government agency, unnamed in the novels, was called Intelligence and Counter-Espionage (ICE) in the films. Like the Bond series, the Helm films featured a number of &quot;sexy&quot; women in each, sometimes referred to as &quot;The Slaygirls&quot;. Martin co-starred in the films with popular &#x27;60s actresses such as Stella Stevens, Ann-Margret, Sharon Tate, Elke Sommer, Janice Rule and Tina Louise.

A 1970s TV series &quot;Matt Helm,&quot; which cast Tony Franciosa as Helm, an ex-spy turned private detective, also departed from the books and was unsuccessful.

In 2002, it was reported that DreamWorks had optioned the entire Helm book series. In 2005, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that DreamWorks had signed Michael Brandt and Derek Haas to write a screenplay for a high six-figure deal. According to the article, the film was to be a contemporary adaptation of the character, but no casting or release information was announced.

Paramount retained the film rights to the Matt Helm series after its 2008 split from DreamWorks. In 2009, it was reported that Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci would produce a more serious version of the Helm franchise, with &quot;Variety&quot; saying that the tone of Paul Attanasio&#x27;s script had a similar tone to &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, and that Steven Spielberg was considering directing or producing.

In March 2018, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that Tom Shepard had been hired to rewrite the script, with Bradley Cooper attached to play Helm. Spielberg reportedly would remain involved in some unspecified capacity.

===Films===
(all starring Dean Martin as Helm)
#&quot;The Silencers&quot; (1966)
#&quot;Murderers&#x27; Row&quot; (1966)
#&quot;The Ambushers&quot; (1967)
#&quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot; (1969)

A fifth film was planned, based upon the novel &quot;The Ravagers&quot;, but Martin declined the opportunity to play the role again. The title of the film was announced at the end of &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;.

==== Box office performance ====
====Home media====
&quot;Murderer&#x27;s Row&quot; was initially released on VHS in 1980, with reissues in 1987 and 1993. &quot;The Ambushers&quot; was released on VHS in 1987, with a reissue in 1996. &quot;The Silencers&quot; and &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot; were both released on VHS only in 1996, with no reissues for either film. The 1996 releases consisted of 2 box sets, one containing &quot;Murderer&#x27;s Row&quot; and &quot;The Ambushers&quot;, with the other containing &quot;The Silencers&quot; and &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;. It is unknown if these releases were sold exclusively as box sets, or if they were also issued individually. A 4-DVD box set containing the four films was released in North America in December 2005.

===Television series===
A television series loosely based upon Hamilton&#x27;s character was launched by the ABC Network in 1975. Titled simply &quot;Matt Helm,&quot; the series starred Anthony Franciosa as a retired spy who becomes a private detective. After being launched by a pilot TV movie, it ran for only 14 episodes.

=== Manga ===
In Japan, Jin Kimura (), also known as () drew , based on the novel, in the magazine &quot;Boy&#x27;s Life&quot; (), November 1968 – March 1969.

<text>Saxe-Coburg () was a duchy held by the Ernestine branch of the Wettin dynasty in today&#x27;s Bavaria, Germany.

==History==


===Ernestine Line===

When Henry IV, Count of Henneberg – Schleusingen, died in 1347, the possessions of the House of Henneberg – Schleusingen were divided between his widow, Jutta of Brandenburg-Salzwedel, and Henry&#x27;s younger brother, John, and Jutta was given the so-called “&quot;neues Herrschaft&quot;” (&quot;new lordship&quot;), with Coburg among other properties. The death of Jutta six years later was followed by the division of the new &quot;Herrschaft&quot; amongst three of her daughters.

The second daughter, Catherine of Henneberg, was awarded the southeastern part of the Coburgish land. After their wedding in 1346, Catherine&#x27;s husband, Frederick III, the Margrave of Meissen from the House of Wettin, asked for his wife&#x27;s dowry, the Coburgish land called the &quot;Pflege Coburg&quot;; but his father-in-law resisted the devolution, and Frederick III could not touch it until after the death of Jutta in 1353.

The Coburgish land was the southernmost part of the Saxon territories. By the Treaty of Leipzig in 1485, the Great Division of the Saxon States (&quot;Großen Sächsischen Landesteilung&quot;) between the Albertine and Ernestine lines, this Coburgish land, together with the greater part of the Landgraviate of Thuringia and the possessions in the Vogtland, was allotted to Ernest, Elector of Saxony, and thus to the Ernestine side of the House of Wettin.

===Duke John Ernest===
After losing the Schmalkaldic War in 1547, the Ernestines had their territorial possessions greatly reduced in Thuringia. Because the Districts of the Coburger Land were assigned to Duke John Ernest as “equipment” (&quot;Ausstattung&quot;), they remained unaffected by the measures against the outlawed Electors. John Ernest settled in the city of Coburg to build the Ehrenburg as his new residential palace, which was later also used and expanded by various Dukes of Saxe-Coburg. When John Ernest died childless in 1553, the former Elector John Frederick I was now only the Duke of Saxony, just released from prison only to die in 1554.

===Joint Rule===
The Coburger Land was given to Elector John Frederick II “the Middle” as his share of the inheritance. He reigned from Gotha together with his brothers John William, residing in Weimar, and John Frederick III “the Younger”. After the early death of their youngest brother, there was a preliminary division of the Ernestine properties, in which the surviving brothers agreed to have a “&quot;Mutschierung&quot;”, i. e., a change in government, every three years. John Frederick II reigned in Gotha, Eisenach and Coburg. But he failed in his efforts to regain the rank of the Elector for himself and his House, fell into conflict with the Emperor (&quot;Grumbachsche Händel&quot;, or “Grumbach Feud”), and was eventually outlawed and imprisoned until his death. His rule initially fell to his brother, John William, who had participated in the &quot;Reichsexekution&quot; on the side of Augustus, Elector of Saxony, but it was returned, in the &quot;Erfurter Teilung&quot; (“Erfurter Division”) of 1572, to the sons of John Frederick.

===Duke John Casimir===
With the Erfurter Division Treaty of 1572 the remaining lands were eventually and forcibly divided between the sons of the defeated John Frederick II. The younger son was John William of Saxe-Weimar, who received, among other properties, the cities of Jena, Altenburg and Saalfeld. Because the elder son, John Frederick II “the Middle” was still in prison for life in Austria, his sons, John Casimir and John Ernest, were given the new Principality of Saxe-Coburg, with Coburg chosen as their residence and “Duke” as their titles. The Principality consisted of the southern and western parts of Thuringia, including the cities of Eisenach, Gotha and Hildburghausen. One of the guardians for the sons was the enemy of their father, Augustus, Elector of Saxony, who supervised their education and who, for his own reasons, began in Coburg a corrupt Regency with Saxon officials from his Electorate.

Only after the death of Elector Augustus of Saxony in 1586 were Duke John Casimir and his brother John Ernest able to take over the government of their Principality. In 1596, the Principality was cut in half to give John Ernest his own Duchy of Saxe-Eisenach and John Casimir remained in Coburg to reign alone. His remaining territories were the Districts of Coburg, with the jurisdictions of Lauter, Rodach and Gestungshausen; Heldburg with the jurisdictions of Hildburghausen, Römhild, Eisfeld, Schalkau, Sonneberg, Neustadt bei Coburg, Neuhaus am Rennweg, and Mönchröden; and Sonnefeld. Under the reign of John Casimir, there was a building boom in Coburg. Above all, he established as the nucleus of Coburger government an administrative apparatus that would survive for a long time after his death and through many wars and political upheavals. Casimir, the founder of the Coburger State, died in 1633. His Principality then fell to his brother, the Duke of Saxe-Eisenach, John Ernest, who was also childless. During this time, the Coburger Land was hit hard by the Thirty Years War as the staging area for numerous armies. The population fell from 55,000 to 22,000.

===Inheritance===
In 1638, the Ernestine line of Saxe-Eisenach died out and its territories were divided between the Duchies of Saxe-Weimar and Saxe-Altenburg. By drawing lots, the Coburger Land fell in 1640, with the Districts of Coburg, Sonnefeld, Sonneberg, Neuhaus am Rennweg, Neustadt bei Coburg, Hildburghausen and Römhild to Frederick William II of Saxe-Altenburg . The principalities of Altenburg and Coburg were ruled in personal union by the Duke but they maintained their own state authorities. Duke Frederick William II died in 1669, followed three years later by his only son, Hereditary Prince Frederick William III, bringing the line of Saxe-Altenburg to extinction. Three quarters of the Altenburger area, including the Coburger Land, were secured, with the Gotha Division Treaty (&quot;Gothaer Teilungsvertrag&quot;) of 1672, for the new sovereign, Ernest I “the Pious”, of Saxe-Gotha, who died in 1675. The administration of Saxe-Gotha was undertaken by his eldest son, Frederick I, at the request of his father, together with his six other brothers.

Because the trial of the common administration of the territories failed at the &quot;Schloss Friedenstein&quot; in Gotha, the inheritance had to be distributed on 24 February 1680 among the seven brothers. The second eldest son of Ernst I “the Pious” of Saxe-Gotha, Albrecht, received the Principality of Saxe-Coburg. Like Saxe-Gotha under Duke Frederick and Saxe-Meiningen under Duke Bernhard I, the third oldest son, the Principality received full sovereignty in the Imperial Confederation. However, the Districts of Coburg, Neustadt bei Coburg, Sonneberg, Mönchröden, Sonnefeld and Neuhaus am Rennweg were considerably smaller than they were before, because Römhild and Hildburghausen were separated to supply the younger brother, the sixth oldest son, who became Ernest II, the first Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen.

===Duke Albert===
Under Duke Albert, the expansion of his baroque residence in Coburg began. He based his life on the customs of his royal and princely contemporaries and tried to imitate their households on a smaller scale in Coburg. His court library consisted of 4,757 volumes. His plans to raise the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; Casimirianum to the rank of university failed because of the tight finances. The reconstruction of the &quot;Schloss&quot; Ehrenburg, burned in 1690, in the Baroque style eventually led to the ruin of the finances of the Principality, which could not be prevented by the minting of inferior coins. The Baroque Prince, Duke Albert, died in 1699 without any surviving descendants. This was followed by the usual inheritance disputes. Saxe-Hildburghausen got the District of Sonnefeld in 1707. Between Bernhard I of Saxe-Meiningen and his youngest brother John Ernest IV of Saxe-Saalfeld, strife lasted for thirty-five years, ending only in 1735 with several interventions from the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles VI, in Vienna. Saxe-Meiningen received the District of Neuhaus am Rennweg and the jurisdiction of Sonneberg while Saxe-Saalfeld was united with the remaining territories of Saxe-Coburg to become Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. In 1753, it grew with the one-third of the Duchy of Saxe-Römhild, which had expired with the death of its only Duke, the childless Henry, Duke of Saxe-Römhild.

===Duke Francis Josias===

Duke Johann Ernest of Saxe-Saalfeld died in 1729. Afterwards, his sons Christian Ernest II and Francis Josias ruled the country together but in different residences. Christian Ernest remained in Saalfeld while Francis Josias chose Coburg as his residence and his decision would stand until the end of the monarchy in 1918. In 1745, Francis Josias inherited parts of Saxe-Coburg from his brother. In 1747, he was able to anchor his birthright (primogeniture) in the Line of Succession Laws and confer it on his rapidly growing family for the long-term survival of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. In 1806, with the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, the Duchy became fully and truly independent. In 1826, with the extensive rearrangement of the Ernestine duchies, Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld changed its name to Saxe-Coburg and Gotha with the personal union of two different duchies, Coburg and Gotha.

<text>Saxe-Gotha () was one of the Saxon duchies held by the Ernestine branch of the Wettin dynasty in the former Landgraviate of Thuringia. The ducal residence was erected at Gotha.

==History==

The duchy was established in 1640, when Duke Wilhelm von Saxe-Weimar created a subdivision for his younger brother 
Ernest I the Pious. Duke Ernest took his residence at Gotha, where he had &quot;Schloss Friedenstein&quot; built between 1643 and 1654. At the same time, the Duchy of Saxe-Eisenach was created for the third brother Albert IV.

Nevertheless, Albert died in 1644, and Ernest inherited large parts of his duchy, though not the core territory around the residence at Eisenach and the Wartburg, which fell to his elder brother Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar. Ernest could also incorporate several remaining estates of the extinct House of Henneberg in 1660, which had been vacant since 1583. Finally in 1672 he received the major part of Saxe-Altenburg through his wife Elisabeth Sophie, after Altenburg&#x27;s last duke Frederick William III had died without heirs. Ernest would then be called Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.

When Ernest died in 1675, he left his seven sons a significantly enlarged territory. The eldest, Frederick I at first ruled jointly with his brothers until in 1680 the duchy was divided. The area around Gotha and also Altenburg passed to Frederick I, who retained the title of a Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. For later history of the duchy, see Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.

== Dukes of Saxe-Gotha ==

When the house of Saxe-Gotha and Altenburg became extinct in 1825, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg was split. Saxe-Gotha passed to the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld who in turn gave Saalfeld to Saxe-Meiningen. The Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen received Saxe-Altenburg, and gave the district of Hildburghausen to Saxe-Meiningen.

After the abolition of German monarchies at the end of the First World War it became a part of the newly created state of Thuringia in 1920.

<text>The Goodyear Inflatoplane is an inflatable experimental aircraft made by the Goodyear Aircraft Company, a subsidiary of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, well known for the Goodyear blimp. Although it seemed an improbable project, the finished aircraft proved to be capable of meeting its design objectives, although orders were never forthcoming from the military. A total of 12 prototypes were built between 1956 and 1959, and testing continued until 1972, when the project was finally cancelled.

==Design and development==
The original concept of an all-fabric inflatable aircraft was based on Taylor McDaniel&#x27;s inflatable rubber glider experiments in 1931. Designed and built in only 12 weeks, the Goodyear Inflatoplane was built in 1956, with the idea that it could be used by the military as a rescue plane to be dropped in a hardened container behind enemy lines. The 44 cubic ft (1.25 cubic meter) container could also be transported by truck, jeep trailer or aircraft. The inflatable surface of this aircraft was actually a sandwich of two rubber-type materials connected by a mesh of nylon threads, forming an I-beam. When the nylon was exposed to air, it absorbed and repelled water as it stiffened, giving the aircraft its shape and rigidity. Structural integrity was retained in flight with forced air being continually circulated by the aircraft&#x27;s motor. This continuous pressure supply enabled the aircraft to have a degree of puncture resilience, the testing of airmat showing that it could be punctured by up to six .30 calibre bullets and retain pressure.
There were at least two versions:
The GA-468 was a single-seater. It took about five minutes to inflate to about ; at full size, it was long, with a wingspan. A pilot would then hand-start the two-stroke cycle, Nelson engine, and takeoff with a maximum load of . On 20 US gallons (76 L) of fuel, the aircraft could fly , with an endurance of 6.5 hours. Maximum speed was , with a cruise speed of 60 mph. Later, a engine was used in the aircraft.

Takeoff from turf was in 250 feet with 575 feet needed to clear a 50-foot obstacle. It landed in 350 feet. Rate of climb was 550 feet per minute. Its service ceiling was estimated at 10,000 ft.

The GA-466 was the two-seater version, shorter, but with a longer wingspan than the GA-468. A more powerful McCulloch 4318 engine could power the of plane and passenger to , although the range of the plane was limited to .

==Operational history==

The test program at Goodyear&#x27;s facilities near Wingfoot Lake, Akron, Ohio showed that the inflation could be accomplished with as little as 8 psi (544 mbar), less than a car tire. The flight test program had a fatal crash when Army aviator Lt. &quot;Pug&quot; Wallace was killed. The aircraft was in a descending turn when one of the control cables under the wing came off the pulley and was wedged in the pulley bracket, locking the stick. The turn tightened until one of the wings folded up over the propeller and was chopped up. With the wings flapping because of loss of air, one of the aluminum wing tip skids hit the pilot in the head, as was clear from marks on his helmet. Wallace was pitched out, over the nose of the aircraft and fell into the shallow lake. His parachute never opened. Only 12 Goodyear Inflatoplanes were built, but development continued until the project was cancelled in 1973.

<text>The Feather River is the principal tributary of the Sacramento River, in the Sacramento Valley of Northern California. The river&#x27;s main stem is about long. Its length to its most distant headwater tributary is just over . The main stem Feather River begins in Lake Oroville, where its four long tributary forks join—the South Fork, Middle Fork, North Fork, and West Branch Feather Rivers. These and other tributaries drain part of the northern Sierra Nevada, and the extreme southern Cascades, as well as a small portion of the Sacramento Valley. The total drainage basin is about , with approximately above Lake Oroville.

The Feather River and its forks were a center of gold mining during the 19th century. Since the 1960s, the river has provided water to central and southern California, as the main source of water for the California State Water Project. Its water is also used for hydroelectricity generation. The average annual flow of the Feather River is more than 7 million acre feet (3.3 km3).

The Feather is unique in that two of its tributaries, the East Branch and Middle Fork, originate east of the Sierra Nevada in the Diamond Mountains and breach the crest of the Sierra as they flow west.

==Course==
The river rises in four main forks in the Sierra Nevada which unite as arms of the Lake Oroville reservoir in the foothills northeast of Oroville in eastern Butte County. In terms of drainage area, the largest is the North Fork, which drains about 60% of the entire upper Feather River watershed. The Middle Fork is the second largest, draining about 32% of the upper basin. The South Fork and the West Branch are much smaller, each draining less than 5% of the upper basin. The main stem Feather River begins at Oroville Dam, the outlet of Lake Oroville. From there the river flows generally south across the Sacramento Valley, east of the Sutter Buttes, past Oroville and Yuba City–Marysville. The Feather receives the Yuba River from the east at Yuba City and the Bear River from the east south of Yuba City. It empties into the Sacramento River from the north, about northwest of Sacramento.

===North Fork===

The North Fork Feather River begins in Feather River Meadows at the junction of Rice Creek and South Arm Rice Creek, . The names and confluence locations of the streams in this area were changed by the Board on Geographic Names in 1927. USGS topographic maps, as of 1995, are mislabeled for South Arm, North Arm Rice Creek, Rice Creek and North Fork Feather River. Rice Creek, labeled North Arm Rice Creek on USGS topo maps, flows south from its source at Cold Boiling Lake, , in Lassen Volcanic National Park, through Crumbaugh Lake, and south to join the South Arm Rice Creek, forming the North Fork Feather River.

The North Fork&#x27;s length is about , or about including Rice Creek. The total length of the Feather River from the source of Rice Creek to the Sacramento River is about .

From its source in Feather River Meadows the North Fork flows east. A tributary emerges from Buzzard Springs and flows into the Stump Ranch Marsh Area, where it joins the North Fork, which then flows southeast to Lake Almanor, a reservoir created by Canyon Dam. Below Canyon Dam the North Fork flows generally southwest through the Sierra Nevada, receiving the East Branch North Fork Feather River near Belden.

The North Fork continues flowing south below the East Branch confluence. Bucks Creek, which drains Bucks Lake near Bucks Lake, California, joins from east. The North Fork flows southeast into Butte County, becoming the northern arm of Lake Oroville. Before Oroville Dam was built the mouth of the North Fork was located at . After the North Fork&#x27;s mouth was inundated by Lake Oroville the North Fork&#x27;s mouth was changed to be at , according to the USGS.

The North Fork Feather River drains — for the North Fork itself and for East Branch North Fork. The average discharge for the two streams is about for the North Fork, and for the East Branch.

====East Branch====
The East Branch is one of the major tributaries of the Feather River system. It originates at , at the confluence of Indian Creek and Spanish Creek. Indian Creek is another long and important tributary, flowing from its source at , on the south slopes of Diamond Mountain, south and west, through Indian Valley and north of American Valley. Impounded at Antelope Dam, Indian Creek then joins Spanish Creek to form the East Branch North Fork Feather River. The longest tributary of Indian Creek is Last Chance Creek, which rises in eastern Plumas County at , south of Honey Lake, and flows generally west, joining Indian Creek at the western end of Genesee Valley. From its source at the Indian and Spanish Creeks confluence, the East Branch North Fork flows west past Twain and joins the North Fork near Belden.

The East Branch&#x27;s main stem length is about . Indian Creek is about long, and Last Chance Creek is about long. The East Branch&#x27;s most distant headwater is Last Chance Creek&#x27;s source. The total length from the mouth of the East Branch to the source of Last Chance Creek is about . The total length of the Feather River from the source of Last Chance Creek to the Sacramento River is about .

===Middle Fork===

The Middle Fork Feather River begins at , in southeastern Plumas County about south of Beckwourth, at the north end of the Sierra Valley. It is formed by the joining of a number of tributaries that merge in an inverted river delta wetland with a complex network of irrigation ditches and drains called the Sierra Valley Channels. A number of creeks merge in the Sierra Valley, the longest of which is Little Last Chance Creek, which originates at and flows south through Frenchman Lake and Last Chance Valley to the Sierra Valley, where it divides into two distributary channels. Other tributaries that join to form the Middle Fork in the Sierra Valley include Carman Creek, Fletcher Creek, Turner Creek, Berry Creek, Hamlin Creek, Sierraville Creek, and Smithneck Creek.

Flowing west through the mountains from its source in the Sierra Valley the Middle Fork is joined by Big Grizzly Creek, which drains Lake Davis to the north. Then the river flows through Portola and Delleker in the Humbug Valley. Sulphur Creek joins in the Mohawk Valley at Clio. Continuing west, the Middle Fork passes between Graeagle and Blairsden and further downstream south of Sloat in Long Valley. At Sloat, Long Valley Creek and Polar Creek enters the Feather. The Feather then enters a long and deep gorge. It is joined by numerous small tributaries. The Pacific Crest Trail crosses near Onion Valley Creek. The Middle Fork turns to flow southwest and south, through Bald Rock Canyon and the Feather River Canyon and on into the middle arm of Lake Oroville.

The Middle Fork&#x27;s main stem length is about , or about including Little Last Chance Creek. The total length of the Feather River from the source of Little Last Chance Creek to the Sacramento River is about .

===South Fork===
The South Fork Feather River originates in southern Plumas County near the Plumas-Sierra county line, at . It heads on the southwest slope of Pilot Peak, just north of Gibsonville Ridge and Bunker Hill Ridge. It flows west and southwest to Little Grass Valley Reservoir, an impoundment created by Little Grass Valley Dam. Below the dam the South Fork flows southwest between Mooreville Ridge and Lumpkin Ridge and enters Butte County. Just before entering Lake Oroville the Ponderosa Diversion Dam impounds the South Fork in the Ponderosa Reservoir. Below the dam the river becomes the south arm of Lake Oroville. The mouth of the South Fork is considered to be where the river empties into Ponderosa Reservoir, . The mouth was formerly located farther west at , until it was inundated by Lake Oroville. The total stream distance from the head of the South Fork to the juncture with the Middle Fork in Lake Oroville is .

===West Branch===
The West Branch Feather River, sometimes called the West Fork Feather River, has a drainage area that is small but slightly larger than that of the South Fork. It originates in Butte County at , in Lassen National Forest. It flows southwest through Snag Lake and by Coon Hollow, after which it is joined by Philbrook Creek, which drains Philbook Reservoir to the east. From there the West Branch flows more directly south and leaves Lassen National Forest. It is joined by Fish Creek and Last Chance Creek (there are several streams named Last Chance Creek in the Feather River watershed). Downstream from Last Chance Creek a diversion dam draws off some of the West Branch&#x27;s water. The diverted water flows into Hendricks Canal, a long conduit composed of ditch, flume, and tunnel sections, with a capacity of . Along with other facilities, such as Philbrook Reservoir, Hendricks Canal is part of the Toadtown development, which conveys water through the several canals and powerhouses. The water ultimately empties into Butte Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River. Another diversion dam on the West Branch Feather River near Magalia, called the Magalia 73 Dam, conveys water into the Upper Miocene Canal, which runs to Kunkle Reservoir and the Lime Saddle Powerhouse on Lake Oroville. From the powerhouse water is carried by the Middle Miocene Canal to the Coal Canyon Powerhouse and on into the Oroville-Thermalito Complex. The Miocene Canal and Lime Saddle Powerhouse are part of the DeSabla Regional Bundle of hydroelectric facilities operated by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company.

The West Branch Feather River flows by Stirling City and is joined by Big Kimshew Creek and the Little West Fork West Branch Feather River. Concow Creek, flowing southwest from Concow Reservoir, joins just before the West Branch empties into the northwest arm of Oroville Lake, near Paradise.

==Drainage basin==
The United States Forest Service manages over 80% of the Feather River&#x27;s upper watershed, in the mountains above Lake Oroville. The alluvial valleys in this area are mostly privately owned and used for livestock grazing and hay production. In terms of drainage area, the North Fork Feather River is the largest, accounting for about 60% of the total basin above Lake Oroville. The Middle Fork drains about 32% of the upper basin. Other forks and tributaries drain much smaller areas—the West Fork accounts for about 5%, and the South Fork about 3%.

There are several important valleys in the otherwise mountainous upper basin. The Sierra Valley comprises an area of about is located where a number of tributaries come together to form the Middle Fork. The valley&#x27;s elevation is nearly . It is known as the largest high-alpine valley in the continental United States. It also lies along the Pacific Flyway, making it an important seasonal home to migrating birds. Settlements in the valley include Loyalton, Sierraville, and Beckwourth, with Portola just west of Sierra Valley.

The American Valley is located in the middle of the upper Feather basin. Spanish Creek and Greenhorn Creek join in the valley, and Spanish Creek flows north to join Indian Creek, forming the East Branch North Fork Feather River. American Valley is about in elevation and supports a population of about 6,500. The largest community is Quincy. Historically, American Valley was a floodplain, but settlers drained the wet meadows to create pasture for cattle and fields for hay production. Today the stream channels are deeply incised and floods rare. These alternations affected the valley&#x27;s ecology. Beavers, which were once prevalent, were nearly eliminated. This in turn had a large effect on the valley&#x27;s hydrology.

Indian Valley is the third important alluvial valley of the upper basin. It is located along lower Indian Creek, near its confluence with Lights Creek. By the end of the 19th century Indian Valley was considered the most important valley of Plumas County and its swampy land was developed into a prosperous agricultural landscape. Communities in Indian Valley include Greenville and Taylorsville.

Two large endorheic lakes, Eagle Lake and Honey Lake, lie north of the upper Feather River basin, across the Diamond Mountains.

==History==
Historically, the Maidu were the main Native American inhabitants of the upper Feather River basin&#x27;s American, Indian, and Sierra Valleys. Maidu villages were located in the Big Meadows area, now inundated by Lake Almanor, and in American Valley where Quincy is now located. The Maidu migrated to the Sierra Valley in the spring and summer, but did not stay during the harsh winters. The Washoe hunted in the upper Feather River basin, especially in Long Valley, Sierra Valley, and Mohawk Valley. There is evidence of Paiute and Washoe settlements in the Long Valley area.

In 1836, John Marsh, Jose Noriega and a company of men, went on an exploration of Northern California. They felled trees, made dugout canoes, and ascended the Sacramento River. They proceeded up a tributary, and found a place where the whole surface was covered in feathers. They named it &quot;El Rio de las Plumas,&quot; River of the Feathers.

The 1849 California Gold Rush brought a flood of prospectors and settlers to the region. The American and Indian Valleys were settled in the 1850s. In the Sierra Valley the first settlers arrived in 1852.

==The Feather River Route==

The Western Pacific Railroad operated a railroad through the Feather River canyon. This route was selected because it leads to a low pass over the Sierra Nevada mountains. The Western Pacific California Zephyr trains used this route and had a feather in their logo to represent the river.
Today, there is no scheduled passenger service along the Feather River Route. The present day California Zephyr, run by Amtrak, operates over Donner Pass.

==River modifications==
Since 1967, the Feather River&#x27;s origin at the confluence of its four forks has been submerged under the waters of Lake Oroville, created by the construction of Oroville Dam in 1967. At about high, it is the tallest dam in the United States and wields nearly complete control over the flow of the Feather River by creating one of the largest reservoirs in California. The dam was built with the purpose of preventing the frequent floods that often inundated this part of the Sacramento Valley, and to store water for agricultural uses downstream during the dry season. The dam is the principal feature for the California State Water Project, storing water for more than 23 million people and of farmland in Central and Southern California

Directly downstream from Oroville Dam lies the Oroville-Thermalito Complex, which consists of two reservoirs, a Forebay and Afterbay, both used for hydroelectricity generation. Although the water diverted from the Feather for this purpose is returned to the river, the water of downstream canals do not, except in the form of irrigation return flows (agricultural waste water). Downstream of Oroville, the river&#x27;s flow is sucked away by numerous irrigation canals that supply water to the agricultural businesses of the lower Feather River valley. The heavy usage of water from the river has reduced its flow significantly.

The Feather&#x27;s main tributaries, the Yuba and the Bear, are also impounded by large dams that provide irrigation water and flood control. New Bullards Bar Dam and Englebright Dam are located on the Yuba, and Rollins Dam and Camp Far West are situated on the Bear. Smaller dams now also block other tributaries, including the Middle, South and North Forks of the Feather. The watershed&#x27;s high mountain streams are often utilized in complex schemes for hydroelectricity generation, including the Pacific Gas and Electric Canyon Power Project on the North Fork, which uses water from Lake Almanor, and the Yuba Hydroelectric Project which taps the Middle and South Forks of the Yuba River.

Water diversions, especially from Lake Oroville, has reduced the streamflow of the Feather River. The USGS has operated a stream gage downriver of Oroville Dam since 1902. The river&#x27;s average annual discharge between 1902 and 1967, before the dam was built, was . From 1969 to 2009 the average flow is , mainly due to diversion for power generation at the Thermalito pumped-storage plant. Most of this water is returned to the river further downstream via a tailrace canal. The maximum discharge at this stream gauge was , recorded on March 19, 1907. The minimum was , recorded on September 19, 1972.

==Ecology==
The riparian area of the Feather River supports a rich biodiversity of native flora and fauna. The Sierra Nevada reaches have considerable wild river features and steep gradients. In lower reaches, after joining of the forks, there is also significant habitat; near Yuba City, for example, there are extents of the river with numerous valley oak trees with understory of wild grape.

The Feather River stonecrop (&quot;Sedum albomarginatum&quot;) is a rare plant endemic to the Feather River watershed.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for the upper and lower sections of Feather River based on levels of mercury found in fish caught from this water body.

<text>William Jefferson Blythe Jr. (February 27, 1918 – May 17, 1946) was an American salesman of heavy equipment. He was the biological father of Bill Clinton, the 42nd president of the United States. Three months before his son was born, Blythe drowned following a car crash.

==Personal life==
William Jefferson Blythe Jr. was one of nine children born to William Jefferson Blythe Sr. (1884–1935), a farmer in Sherman, Texas, and Lou Birchie Ayers (1893–1946). Blythe Sr. was of English and Scottish descent, with a family tree in North America since the days of the thirteen colonies.

Blythe was married five times. He married for the first time in December 1935 to Virginia Adele Gash when they both were 17; they were divorced only thirteen months later. However, Virginia Gash and Blythe remained friends, and she visited him on occasion. A son was conceived during these visits, and Henry Leon Blythe was born in Sherman, Texas in January 1938, eighteen months after his parents had been divorced.

Blythe married his second wife, 21-year-old Maxine Hamilton, in August 1938; they divorced two weeks later.

Blythe next married Minnie Faye Gash, his first wife&#x27;s sister, in December 1940. The marriage was annulled four months later in April 1941, without children.
Shortly after the annulment on May 3, 1941, Blythe married again. His fourth wife was Wanetta Ellen Alexander of Kansas City, Missouri, and the wedding was held in Jackson County, Missouri. Wanetta gave birth to Blythe&#x27;s daughter on May 11, 1941, eight days after their wedding. She had become pregnant with Blythe&#x27;s child prior to his short-lived third marriage to Minnie. Their daughter, Sharon Lee Blythe Pettijohn, died on April 24, 2022. Blythe and Wanetta were formally divorced three years later, in April 1944, and lost touch immediately afterward. Wanetta, who eventually settled in Tucson, Arizona, had no inkling of Blythe&#x27;s subsequent history until the presidential campaign of 1992 and a &quot;Washington Post&quot; story. Upon seeing old photographs of Bill Clinton&#x27;s father flashed on TV, Wanetta &quot;swears on a stack of Bibles ... that that was the man she was married to&quot;, said her son-in-law Bob Pettijohn, husband of her daughter Sharon.

Blythe&#x27;s divorce from Wanetta was granted in court on April 13, 1944. Seven months prior on September 4, 1943, Blythe had bigamously married Virginia Dell Cassidy of Bodcaw, Arkansas. Blythe and Virginia remained married until his death in a car crash on May 17, 1946. On August 19, 1946, three months after Blythe&#x27;s death, Virginia gave birth to their only child, William Jefferson Blythe III. Bill, as a teen, took his stepfather&#x27;s surname and became known as Bill Clinton, the future 42nd president of the United States. Virginia Blythe-Clinton had no knowledge of Blythe&#x27;s previous marriages until decades later when &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ran an extensive story in 1993, based on birth and marriage registry records, to mark Father&#x27;s Day.

Blythe&#x27;s eldest son, Henry Leon Blythe, never knew his biological father or paternal siblings. After their divorce, Virginia Gash moved to California and married first a man named Coffelt, then a man named Charles Ritzenthaler. She had lost touch with Blythe when their son was an infant, after he briefly married and then divorced her sister. Later in life, Henry Leon Blythe took the name Henry Leon Ritzenthaler in honor of his stepfather. Henry ran several small businesses in Paradise, California, including a janitorial business, dying in 2009. He was unaware of his connection to the future president until the presidential campaign of 1992, when an investigation by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, based on birth registry records, revealed details of Bill Clinton&#x27;s family. Ritzenthaler met his half-brother for the first time around that time, and the physical resemblance between the two was remarkable.

==Career==
Blythe was a traveling heavy equipment salesman for most of his brief career. It was while he worked as a travelling salesman that he met and married all his wives. After his fifth wedding in September 1943, Blythe shipped out for military service in World War II. He was stationed in Egypt and Italy. He worked in a motor pool as a mechanic, repairing jeeps and tanks.

After the war ended, Blythe returned to Hope, Arkansas, to be with his wife. Shortly after he returned, he purchased a house in Chicago and readied it to receive his wife and expected child; he was apparently laying the ground for a more settled and conventional married life. Blythe moved to the new house in Chicago while Virginia remained behind in Hope. In Chicago, Blythe returned to his old job as a traveling salesman for the Manbee Equipment Company, which repaired heavy machinery. He died three months before the birth of his son.

==Death==
On May 17, 1946, while traveling from Chicago, Illinois, to Hope, Arkansas, Blythe lost control of his 1942 Buick on U.S. Route 60 outside of Sikeston, Missouri, after one of his car&#x27;s tires blew out. He survived the crash after being thrown from the car, but drowned in a drainage ditch. There were only three feet (1 meter) of water in the ditch. Three months later, Blythe&#x27;s widow, Virginia, gave birth to their son, whom she named William Jefferson Blythe III in honor of his father and grandfather. In 1950, Blythe&#x27;s widow married Roger Clinton Sr.; 12 years later, Blythe&#x27;s posthumous son legally adopted his stepfather&#x27;s surname. He has a granddaughter, Chelsea Clinton, and 3 great-grandchildren through Bill.

==Memorial==
Blythe was buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Hope, Hempstead County, Arkansas. In 1994, Virginia was interred beside him. In Clinton&#x27;s 2004 autobiography, &quot;My Life&quot;, the elder Blythe was extensively mentioned, including a visit that Clinton made to the site where his father drowned.

<text>George Coleman Eads III (born March 1, 1967) is an American actor, known for his role as Nick Stokes on the CBS police drama &quot;&quot;. He later starred as Jack Dalton on the CBS action-adventure series &quot;MacGyver&quot; for three seasons.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Eads attended Belton High School in Belton, Texas. Eads graduated from Texas Tech University (1989) with a degree in marketing. In college, he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. Prior to beginning an acting career, Eads worked as a copy machine salesman, as well as selling first aid and safety supplies for Cintas.

===Career===
Eads drove to Los Angeles, California in a pickup truck borrowed from his stepfather, to pursue his acting career. Eads got his big break on the prime time soap opera &quot;Savannah&quot;, in which he played the conniving Travis Peterson and later Travis&#x27;s twin brother, Nick Corelli.

Eads guest-starred as paramedic Greg Powell on &quot;ER&quot; in 1997 and worked on several television films such as &quot;Crowned and Dangerous&quot; (1997).

In 2000, Eads became one of the lead characters of the CBS police drama &quot;&quot;, in which he portrayed forensic scientist Nick Stokes.

Parallel to &quot;CSI&quot;, Eads worked on made-for-television films, such as 2003&#x27;s &quot;Monte Walsh&quot; and 2004&#x27;s &quot;Evel Knievel&quot;.

In August 2013, prior to &quot;CSI&quot; 14th season, Eads reportedly took a leave of absence after having an altercation with a writer from the show over what was described as &quot;creative issues&quot;. On November 25, 2014, it was announced that Eads would be leaving the show, which in any event was not renewed for the following season; he only missed the series finale television film, &quot;Immortality&quot;.

From 2016 to 2019, Eads starred as Jack Dalton in CBS&#x27;s reboot series &quot;MacGyver&quot;. In 2018, while the series&#x27; third season was filming, Eads asked to be released from his contract so he could spend more time with his young daughter who resides in Los Angeles, as &quot;MacGyver&quot; is filmed in Atlanta. Producers ultimately agreed with Eads being written out of the show but left open the opportunity for him to return as a guest star in the future. However, his character was ultimately killed off. The February 1, 2019 episode &quot;Father + Bride + Betrayal&quot; was his last on &quot;MacGyver&quot;.

==In other media==
In March 2009, Eads was voted as one of &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Sexiest Male Actors in the &quot;TV Guide&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Sexiest Stars&quot; issue. The &quot;Sexiest Stars&quot; issue voted &quot;The Mentalist&quot;″s Simon Baker as the Sexiest Male Actor. Eads was not discouraged by this, however, and said that he was very appreciative of his fans calling him &quot;sexy&quot;. &quot;It’s sweet and kind. It makes me want to work harder for them. It makes me want to be sexier.&quot;

<doc id="752221" wikidata="Q3499729" url="?curid=752221" title="Stonehenge II">
<text>Stonehenge II is a concrete sculpture in the Texas Hill Country, US, built in homage to the original Stonehenge monument. Stonehenge II was conceived by Al Shepperd and built with the help of his friend and neighbor, Doug Hill. Originally located on FM 1340 west of Hunt, Texas, Stonehenge II now resides on the campus of the Hill Country Arts Foundation in Ingram, Texas (78025).

According to the signage at the site: &quot;Stonehenge II is not a replica; it is about 2/3 the size of the original, and it is not oriented to the sun, as is the original. Rather, it is Hill&#x27;s impression, in steel and concrete, of the nearly 5,000 year old circle of stones on the Salisbury Plain.&quot;

In addition to the constructed and real stones comprising the monument, there are also two fabricated Moai, or Easter Island (Rapa Nui/Isla de Pascua) statues located at the Hill Country Arts Foundation. These imitation Moai are made of the same material as the Stonehenge II stones.

==Creation of Stonehenge II==
The first stone for the project was a piece of limestone left over from a building project. Most of the stones are constructed of plaster applied to a wire mesh frame; however, two of the central stones are real, large, and probably unmovable without heavy equipment.

==Relocation effort==
In the summer of 2010, Al Shepperd began searching for a new home for Stonehenge II after putting his land in Hunt, Texas up for sale. The Hill Country Arts Foundation agreed to offer a new location for the project, and started a &#x27;Save Stonehenge II&#x27; campaign to raise the necessary funds to cover the costs of moving, repairing, and rebuilding the monument in a new location in Ingram, Texas. By December 2010, the stones and statues were moved to the new site, but not reconstructed.

By 2011, the Hill Country Arts Foundation had raised the necessary funds to move the monument and statues to its new home on Foundation property near the Point Theater in Ingram.

==The site today==
The new location of Stonehenge II sits directly in the path of the April 8, 2024 total solar eclipse. The duration of the eclipse will last for 4 minutes 26 seconds. Future plans for Stonehenge II include the addition of a dance floor, benches, and sidewalks to the site.

==In popular culture==
Stonehenge II was featured as a backdrop for a scene in an early episode of the NBC TV series &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; (Episode 19: &quot;Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes&quot;).

<doc id="752225" wikidata="Q3488682" url="?curid=752225" title="ExxonMobil Building">
<text>The ExxonMobil Building (also known as Exxon Tower, and formerly as Humble Oil Building) at 800 Bell Street in Houston, Texas is a 45-story, skyscraper built in 1963, designed by Welton Becket &amp; Associates. The building is known for its “fins” which protrude from the building’s exterior to provide shade from the sun.

At the time of its construction, it was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River at , surpassing the Republic Bank Tower in Dallas (the previous record holder). It remained the tallest building west of the Mississippi only until 1965, when Elm Place was built in Dallas. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2025.

==History==
800 Bell Street was built in 1963 as the headquarters of Humble Oil Company, a predecessor of Exxon. In 1973 Humble&#x27;s parent company Standard Oil of New Jersey rebranded nationwide as Exxon and discontinued the Humble name.
During the Houston Astros&#x27; 2004 NLCS run (playoffs), the top of the building was crowned by hundreds of tiny blue lights while an enormous Astros star (logo) made of white lights was hung on the south side of the building.

In 2011 the company announced they would relocate all employees in the building to a new ExxonMobil office in Spring.

In January 2013, Shorenstein Properties acquired the property for $50 million. As part of the deal, ExxonMobil leased back the entire building through 2015. Shorenstein Properties announced plans to undertake significant improvements following ExxonMobil&#x27;s departure.

In 2015, as ExxonMobil&#x27;s lease expired, oil prices crashed. This caused petroleum companies to shed excess office space, leaving the property vacant for almost the next decade.

Mayor of Houston Annise Parker proposed moving municipal court and Houston Police Department operations into the ExxonMobil building. Charles McClelland, the head of HPD, stated that having so many law enforcement and public safety agencies concentrated in a single building may be a safety risk, citing the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. In September 2015 Parker&#x27;s administration announced that the plan would not move forward due to concerns over costs.

In late 2022, the 1.2 million square foot building was sold to developers with plans to convert the vacant office building to residential units.

===Location===
The building is two blocks east of 1500 Louisiana Street; a parking lot is between the two buildings. The building is situated about five blocks north of the Pierce Elevated freeway, which is slated to be re-routed and removed as part of a Texas Department of Transportation Plan.

==Petroleum Club==
The Petroleum Club of Houston moved into the top three floors of the ExxonMobil Building in February 1963. The club was accessible through elevators on Bell Street. In January 2015, due to ExxonMobil&#x27;s lease expiration, the club relocated to Total Plaza.

<doc id="752230" wikidata="Q526241" url="?curid=752230" title="Bobby Jackson">
<text>Bobby Jackson (born March 13, 1973) is an American professional basketball coach who is an assistant coach for the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for Western Nebraska Community College and the University of Minnesota. In the NBA, he played for several teams over twelve seasons, from 1997 to 2009.

==Playing career==

=== Collegiate ===
Jackson graduated from Salisbury High School in 1992. He attended Western Nebraska Community College and later the University of Minnesota. As a Golden Gopher, Bobby Jackson led Minnesota to the Final Four, where they lost to the Kentucky Wildcats.

=== Professional ===
Jackson was selected by the Seattle SuperSonics with the 23rd pick in the 1997 NBA draft. He was traded to the Denver Nuggets prior to his rookie season where he played 68 games before moving on to a more familiar place in Minnesota where he donned a Timberwolves jersey for two seasons.

He is perhaps best known for his years in Sacramento when he played for the Kings from 2000 to 2005, where he was known as &quot;Action Jackson&quot; and was a crowd favorite. In the 2002 NBA Playoffs, after he and his team finished with a 61–21 regular season record, Jackson and the Kings came within one game of making the NBA Finals, eliminated controversially by the Los Angeles Lakers. During the 2002-03 NBA season, Jackson averaged a career-best 15.2 points per game on the way to being named the Sixth Man of the Year. Jackson suffered an abdominal strain early in the 2004–05 season that forced him to miss 51 games. The following season, he was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies for Bonzi Wells.

On July 29, 2008, it was reported that Jackson would be traded by the Rockets back to the Sacramento Kings along with Donté Greene, a 2009 first round draft pick and cash consideration in exchange for Ron Artest (now Metta World Peace). The trade was completed on August 14, due to Greene&#x27;s rookie contract signing on July 14.

Jackson retired from the NBA on October 24, 2009.

== Coaching career ==
Jackson became an assistant coach for the Sacramento Kings. On June 5, 2013, new Kings coach Michael Malone announced that the 2012–13 assistant coaches would not be retained for the 2013–14 season.

On September 9, 2013, Jackson was hired by the Minnesota Timberwolves as a player development coach.

In 2021, Jackson was named the head coach of the Stockton Kings in the NBA G League.

On September 5, 2023, Jackson became an assistant coach for the Philadelphia 76ers.

<text>The Hong Kong Journalists Association () is a Hong Kong association that represents journalists in Hong Kong. Established in 1968, the association acts as a trade union for journalists by seeking to improve working conditions for them and further works to aid journalists by striving to remove barriers journalists face when gathering news. HKJA also serves as a channel for individuals to file complaints when unethical reporting in local media is observed.

The association has been chaired by Selina Cheng since June 2024.

==Background==

Every year, HKJA produces a report on the press freedom status in Hong Kong. It is widely circulated to foreign consulates and non-governmental organisations and is often quoted in foreign media reports about Hong Kong. The 2006 report describes the challenges facing the media in Hong Kong, including the government&#x27;s attempts to influence the editorial direction of the public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong .

Prior to 2006, the report was annually produced in partnership with ARTICLE 19, a London-based rights group.

HKJA is an affiliated member of the International Federation of Journalists, the world&#x27;s largest journalists&#x27; organisation.

HKJA is also a member of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange, a global network of non-governmental organisations that monitors censorship worldwide and defends journalists, writers, Internet users and others who are persecuted for exercising their right to freedom of expression.

Hong Kong&#x27;s press consists of 23 Chinese dailies, 13 English dailies (one in Braille and one an Internet edition), 8 bilingual dailies and 5 Japanese publications. Of the 23 Chinese dailies, 17 mainly cover local and overseas news, while 4 specialise in finance. 3 Chinese dailies and 4 bilingual dailies are published on the Internet.

===Funding===

To maintain its neutrality, HKJA is funded by membership fees and other fund-raising activities, such as annual dinners, seminars (for non-members), training courses etc.

===Membership classifications===

One may choose to join HKJA as a Full Member, Associate Member, Public Relations Member or Student Member.

== List of chairman ==
The association has been chaired by Selina Cheng since June 2024.

* Selina Cheng, 2024–

* Tam Chi-keung (譚志強), 2008–09
* Fan Ho-tsai (范皓齊), 2007–08
* Lo King-wah, –2007

==Board==
Every year, the executive committee appoints three members to the ethics committee after the annual general meeting. The committee&#x27;s responsibility is to investigate alleged breaches of HKJA&#x27;s Code of Ethics and to make recommendations to the executive committee. There are also five subcommittees which members can join: Press Freedom; Membership, Training and Welfare; China Concern; International Relations; Publication.

==Activities==

The Association organises various activities to inform their members of the latest news/developments in the field. These include seminars, workshops, press awards and overseas tours. The Association also organises football matches, i.e. JA Cup, since 1985.

Certificate Courses:

HKJA has organised training courses for junior journalists that will take place in November 2006. These courses cover topics such as how to conduct effective interviews in political, court or hospital settings. Guest lecturers are invited to the courses, most of which are well known in the journalism field. A certificate will be given to candidates who complete the courses.

===JA Cup===

The HKJA Cup was inaugurated in 1984. The champions of the JA Cup are:

==Press freedom issues in Hong Kong==

=== Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) ===
Questions over Hong Kong&#x27;s press freedom were raised when the government announced plans to set up a committee to review public broadcasting in January 2005. The greatest concern that arose from the establishment of the committee seemed to be the controversy over the editorial independence/freedom of Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK). The broadcaster is known for airing views and opinions that challenge the government&#x27;s policies. Consequently, there were fears over whether RTHK&#x27;s editorial freedom would remain. On the one hand, the government wanted to use RTHK as an outlet to disseminate its views. On the other, Hong Kong people want to be able to voice their concerns freely. The Hong Kong Journalists Association responded to the issue by saying that RTHK should maintain its freedom and remain independent of the government (for more on HKJA&#x27;s response, see the HKJA Annual Report (2006)).

=== Article 23 ===
Introduced as a law to protect national security, Article 23 of the Basic Law created much concern and debate over Hong Kong&#x27;s right to freedom of speech. On the one hand, the government wanted to pass the bill to help the country and protect it from any threats, while on the other, individuals wanted to be able to express themselves freely. In a response to the issue, HKJA opposed the bill as it felt that Article 23 posed a threat to freedom of expression and was also unnecessary. Due to the dissatisfaction of the people, on 1 July 2003 approximately 500,000 people protested against Article 23. On 5 September later that year, the government announced that it had decided to withdraw the bill.

== Hong Kong press ratings ==
On 26 October 2006, &quot;Ming Pao&quot; reported the findings of a survey in which Hong Kong people were asked to rate the local press.
It showed that the press received a relatively steady approval rating from the general public.

However, another survey conducted by the University of Hong Kong, showed that public support for the press in Hong Kong has been decreasing and has reached its lowest point in three years.

<doc id="752246" wikidata="Q1339293" url="?curid=752246" title="American Family Field">
<text>American Family Field is a retractable roof stadium in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Located southwest of the intersection of Interstate 94 and Brewers Boulevard, it is the ballpark of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Milwaukee Brewers. It opened in 2001 as a replacement for Milwaukee County Stadium. The stadium was previously called Miller Park as part of a $40 million naming rights deal with Miller Brewing Company, which expired at the end of 2020. The rights have since been owned by American Family Insurance.

American Family Field features North America&#x27;s only fan-shaped convertible roof, which can open and close in less than 10 minutes. Large panes of glass allow natural grass to grow, augmented with heat lamp structures wheeled out across the field during the off-season.

The stadium opened in 2001 at a cost of $392 million. Between 1996 and 2000, taxpayers paid $609 million for the construction costs through higher sales taxes. In 2023, Wisconsin lawmakers entered into an agreement with the Milwaukee Brewers to spend nearly half a billion dollars of public funds on stadium renovations.

==Construction==
American Family Field was one of the largest construction projects in Wisconsin history. It was built with US$290 million of public funds from a 0.1% sales tax that began January 1, 1996, and ended on March 31, 2020. The tax was applied on purchases in Milwaukee County and four surrounding counties: Ozaukee, Racine, Washington, and Waukesha. The tax was controversial, in part because of the notion of using public funds for a privately owned sports team. The state senator who cast the deciding vote in the funding bill, George Petak of Racine, lost a recall election based on his vote for the stadium.

On November 9, 1996, groundbreaking took place in a parking lot behind County Stadium. Originally scheduled to open in 2000, American Family Field&#x27;s construction was delayed after three construction workers were killed in an accident on July 14, 1999. A Lampson Transi-lift crane (nicknamed &quot;Big Blue&quot;) brought in to build the roof collapsed while lifting a 450-ton roof section during windy conditions. A camera crew was filming construction of the stadium on that day and captured the collapse on video as it occurred. Repair work and an investigation forced the Brewers to stay in County Stadium for one more year, until 2001. There was some talk of having the Brewers move to American Family Field in the middle of 2000, but it was determined that too many issues would need to be resolved for it to be a realistic possibility.

The stadium was previously called Miller Park as part of a $40 million naming rights deal with Miller Brewing Company which expired at the end of 2020. Madison-based American Family Insurance purchased the naming rights in a new 15-year deal.

===Structural challenges===
The unconventional fan-shaped retractable roof has not been without complications. Major elements of the pivot system behind home plate and the outfield roof track have been replaced, even after the crane incident.

At the end of the 2006 season, the roof&#x27;s bogie system was replaced at a cost of over $13 million. The 10 new, , bogies were paid for with money from the settlement between the stadium district and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of America. Six of the bogies weigh , while the four others weigh . The work was completed by lifting sections of the roof approximately with Enerpac hydraulic lifts, while a crane replaced the bogies individually. &quot;The bogies will last for the life of the facility,&quot; said Mike Duckett, executive director of the then named Miller Park stadium district. The project was completed by the start of the 2007 season.

===Additions===
In time for the 2006 season there were three additions to the stadium. Two sets of LED scoreboards were added. One replaced the formerly manually operated &quot;out of town&quot; scoreboards along the left and right field walls with a new set of LED scoreboards along the left-field wall. The new &quot;out of town&quot; scoreboards show the score of every Major League game on that day. A second-tier marquee scoreboard was also added along the bottom of the 300-level of the stadium stretching from foul pole to home plate to foul pole, with the portion closest to the foul lines used to provide open captions of announcements from the public address system and advertisements. The section of the second-tier scoreboard above home plate displays statistics for those unable to see the main scoreboard above the center-field wall. The final addition to American Family Field for the 2006 season was the addition of a field-level picnic area in the corner of right-field. The picnic area has a capacity of 75 and provides a place for fans to watch the game in a leisurely setting and be within feet of the right-fielder. Known first as the Mercedes-Benz Field Haus, the picnic area&#x27;s name was changed to AirTran Airways Landing Zone in 2009, and to the ATI Club in 2012. In 2017, due to a contract dispute between ATI and the Brewers, it was apparently billed as the Right Field Patio until gaining its sponsorship as the Aurora Health Care Bullpen in 2018.

In 2009, American Family Field&#x27;s outfield was replaced with &quot;Lo-Mo&quot; Kentucky bluegrass just like the infield was the prior year. The new turf, common in other ballparks around baseball, is denser and has a sand base, instead of the sand and clay mix under the original grass. The turf yields truer hops and fewer instances in which the baseball skips under an outfielder&#x27;s glove than the previous turf.

During the off-season between 2010 and 2011, the stadium&#x27;s original centerfield scoreboard (a smaller videoboard atop a larger black and amber message display board) was replaced by a full-length and full color Daktronics 1080p HD display board which was the ninth-largest screen among MLB stadiums as of 2012, along with a public address/sound system upgrade. By 2023, the relative screen size had dropped to 20th among the 30 MLB teams.

In late 2023, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers signed into effect a bill totaling $500 million of taxpayer money to allow for repairs, ensuring the team remains in Milwaukee until 2050, despite threats of relocation by the MLB. Debuting in the 2024 season, American Family Field had many renovations done with the most notable changes being in center and right field, with a 12,077 square feet board in center, and a 2,840 square feet board in right. The Brewers partnered with ANC in order to provide the 8mm LED displays. The center field board ranks 3rd in the majors for overall size behind the New York Mets and Cleveland Guardians. The new center field board is over double the size of the old board at 5,940 square feet. LED displays were also added on the dugout and behind home plate. The 3rd Street Market Hall, a popular food hall and event venue in downtown Milwaukee, opened with four restaurants in the right field loge level. These vendors include: Kompali Tacos, Smokin&#x27; Jack&#x27;s BBQ, Kawa (Asian fusion), and Anytime Arepa (Venezuelan). The team store in left field was also renovated.

The team also announced new parking technology in collaboration with the Interstate Parking Company, based out of Milwaukee. The goal of this partnership is to speed up the time it takes for parking at American Family Field, which can be up to an hour during the busiest times. Visitors may purchase parking in advance at a discounted rate, or may pay when they arrive via QR codes across the stadium grounds. Parking ambassadors aid in the parking process.

Plans for future improvements include a $25 million winterization of the stadium as well as improvements to the roof, elevators, suites, and other parts of the ballpark.

=== Sensory friendly ===
In June 2022 the Brewers announced the creation of a quiet area at American Family Field known as a sensory friendly area. The area is equipped with &quot;sensory bags&quot; to accommodate those with sensory processing disorders. The sensory bags contain noise-cancelling headphones, a fidget toy, verbal cue cards, and a weighted lap pad.

==Attendance==

From the year American Family Field opened in 2001, the Brewers have averaged 31,783 fans per game, or 2,574,423 per season, while placing 11th out of 30 franchises in total attendance, despite having only eight winning seasons through the 2019 season, and having won only two MLB playoff series in just five total series appearances, and having the smallest market size of any Major League city. In 2011, the Brewers set a franchise record of 3,071,373, and beginning in 2004 they have attracted at least two million fans—an ongoing streak of 15 consecutive years, the 12th longest in Major League history. Prior to American Family Field, the previous such consecutive streak in Milwaukee baseball history was four years, from 1954 to 1957. Since 2007, except for the required reduced attendance in 2020 &amp; 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Brewers have drawn at least 2.5 million fans in 13 of 15 seasons, and have only had one season (2016), where they didn&#x27;t average 30,000+ fans per game.

Note: For the 2020 season, fans were not allowed in MLB stadiums due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2021, fans were allowed to attend, but for part of the season, it was with reduced capacity.

==Attractions==

* Bernie Brewer, the team mascot, has a club house above the left field seats. Following every Brewers home run and victory, Bernie Brewer slides into a home plate shaped platform (The Kalahari &quot;Splash Zone&quot; was discontinued for the 2012 season). This is different from his old home at Milwaukee County Stadium, where Bernie slid into a giant mug of beer in center field which had been sponsored over the years by Pabst, Miller, and Sentry Foods. During the home run celebration, a short burst of fireworks is shot out from the top of the center field scoreboard, and above Bernie&#x27;s club house, the call words of Brewers&#x27; radio announcer Bob Uecker are illuminated, &quot;Get Up, Get Up, Get Outta Here, Gone!&quot;
* The Hank the Dog mascot made his debut on September 13, 2014. Hank the real dog was found wandering the field at the Spring training complex in Maryvale, Arizona, on February 17, 2014. He was named after former Brewer and Braves great Hank Aaron. He would soon become an international sensation.
* The Barrelman mascot made his debut on April 6, 2015. The barrelman served as the team&#x27;s primary logo from 1970 to 1977.
* The Johnsonville Sausage Race occurs during each game in the middle of the 6th inning; it was moved from the bottom of the 6th inning to enable the sausages to create more excitement for the fans as the Brewers prepared to bat. The current &quot;racing sausages&quot; are the Bratwurst, the Polish, the Italian, the Hot Dog and the Chorizo. The chorizo sausage (to salute the region&#x27;s growing Latino population) was added on July 29, 2006, for one race, and became a full-time participant in 2007.
* During the 7th inning stretch, in addition to &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot;, fans at American Family Field sing &quot;Roll Out the Barrel&quot;, in salute to Milwaukee&#x27;s beer-making history.
* The Brewers have also set statues of legendary Milwaukee players Robin Yount and Hank Aaron outside the front entrance of American Family Field, as well as a statue of former team owner and MLB commissioner Bud Selig and one for Brewers longtime radio broadcaster Bob Uecker. An additional sculpture of Uecker was added to the highest point of seats in the ballpark, in reference to Uecker&#x27;s famed Miller Lite commercial where he says, &quot;I must be in the front row&quot;, and he&#x27;s placed at the highest point of the ballpark instead.
* Another sculpture, &quot;Teamwork&quot; by Omri Amrany, honors three Iron Workers Local 8 members killed during the construction of the stadium.
* Helfaer Field is a youth baseball facility located outside American Family Field. The infield is laid out upon the former footprint of the County Stadium infield, albeit in smaller Little League-compliant dimensions. The groundbreaking ceremony was held in August 2001. It was named in honor of the Evan and Marion Helfaer Foundation, which was founded in 1974. Evan Helfaer was an original investor in the Brewers.
* The American Family Field Walk of Fame was created in 2001 to honor both the Milwaukee Brewers and the Milwaukee Braves. It is located outside American Family Field on the plaza near the home plate entrances. Its most recent additions were former Brewers first baseman Prince Fielder in 2022, starting pitcher Ben Sheets in 2023, and outfielder Ryan Braun in 2024.
* The Brewers Wall of Honor was created in 2014 to commemorate Brewers players, coaches and executives who meet a set criteria based on service to the club or career accomplishments. It is located outside American Family Field on an exterior wall near the Hot Corner entrance. Brewers TV announcer Bill Schroeder became the 59th honoree on July 17, 2015.
* The Selig Experience is an exhibit to honor former Brewers owner and retired MLB commissioner Allan H. (Bud) Selig. It opened on May 29, 2015.

==Notable events==

===Baseball===

On opening day April 6, 2001, President George W. Bush and MLB Commissioner Bud Selig had first pitch honors for the stadium. The park hosted the 2002 MLB All-Star Game, which ended infamously in a tie.

====Non-Brewer games====
In April 2007, snow storms in northern Ohio caused the Cleveland Indians to postpone their home opening series against the Seattle Mariners and forced the Indians to find a different location for their home series against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Major League Baseball took advantage of American Family Field&#x27;s roof and moved the Indians-Angels series to Milwaukee. All seats were sold for $10 apiece, and attendance was 52,496 for the three games. The series was a reminder to many of the 1989 film &quot;Major League&quot;, which featured scenes filmed in Milwaukee County Stadium, though the film was about a fictionalized Cleveland Indians team. The first game of the series was played on the same day that the film&#x27;s &quot;Wild Thing Edition&quot; was released on DVD. When Joe Borowski came in to close for the Indians, the song &quot;Wild Thing&quot; was played over the PA system, in an homage to the film. Also, the Indians&#x27; mascot Slider slid down Bernie Brewer&#x27;s slide following Indians home runs. These games were the first to be played under American League rules in Milwaukee since 1997 (the Brewers&#x27; final season in the AL). Some Milwaukee fans commemorated the occasion by making unofficial t-shirts that said, &quot;The Cleveland Indians of Milwaukee; Established 1989, Re-established 2007.&quot;

Hurricane Ike&#x27;s landfall in Houston forced the Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros to play a two-game series at American Family Field on Sunday, September 14 and Monday, September 15, 2008. The park became the first neutral site in Major League history to host a no-hitter, when Carlos Zambrano of the Chicago Cubs threw the first no-hitter in the history of the park against the Houston Astros on Sunday, September 14, 2008. The next day, his teammate Ted Lilly, took a no-hitter into the 7th inning.

===Bowling===
American Family Field hosted the 2007 United States Bowling Congress Masters finals on Sunday, October 28, 2007. The playing surface was fitted with four bowling lanes for the tournament.

===Concerts===
===Soccer===
During the 2014 All-Star break, American Family Field hosted an untelevised international friendly match between Swansea City and Chivas of Guadalajara on July 16, 2014. The soccer pitch was laid out in a first baseline-to-left field configuration, with a narrower width than a standard soccer pitch due to the constraints of the field. The teams played to a 1–1 draw in front of about 31,000 in attendance.

During the 2015 All-Star Break, American Family Field hosted a friendly between Mexican side Club Atlas and English Premier League side Newcastle United on July 14, 2015. Club Atlas won the match 2–1.

After a three-year hiatus, American Family Field once again hosted a friendly match between Mexican sides C.F. Pachuca and Club León. Pachuca won the match 3–1.

===Basketball===
On November 11, 2022, the University of Wisconsin Badgers hosted a basketball doubleheader at American Family Field called the &quot;Brew City Battle&quot;. The event featured the Wisconsin Badgers men&#x27;s team playing against the Stanford University Cardinal and the Wisconsin Badgers women&#x27;s team playing against the Kansas State Wildcats. The Badgers beat the Cardinal 60 to 50 in the men&#x27;s game while they lost 63 to 77 in the women&#x27;s game against the Wildcats.

===Movie premiere===
On August 11, 2012, American Family Field hosted an event called &quot;Field of Honor: A Salute to the Greatest Generation&quot;. Over 30,000 tickets were sold for the event, which included the premiere showing of &quot;Honor Flight&quot;, a documentary detailing the Honor Flight movement, where veterans of World War II are flown into Washington, D.C., on commercial flights via donations and non-profit organizations in order to visit the National World War II Memorial in person.

===Arctic Tailgate===
The Arctic Tailgate is an annual event where fans camp outside American Family Field the day before single game tickets are sold, which is usually the last weekend of February. (It is delayed or moved into the stadium&#x27;s heated concourse if the temperatures are well below for the safety of fans.) The tradition is said to have started as early as the 1990s where Brewers fans would try to be the first to acquire tickets for Opening Day. Since 2006, the Brewers have made it an official event, even providing the waiting fans coffee, hot chocolate, and doughnuts in the morning, discounts on tickets for the first week of games in the season, as well as a free lunch consisting of a hot dog, chips, and a soda, eaten in a heated tent afterwards. Over 101,000 tickets were sold for the 2015 Arctic Tailgate.

===In film===
American Family Field was also a major filming location for the motion picture &quot;Mr. 3000&quot;, which centered on a fictional Brewers player played by comedian Bernie Mac.

<text>Curious George is a fictional monkey who is the title character of a series of popular children&#x27;s picture books written and illustrated by Margret and H. A. Rey. Various media, including films and TV shows, have been based upon the original book series.

George is described as &quot;a good little monkey, and always very curious&quot;. In the first book, George is caught by &quot;The Man with the Yellow Hat&quot; and taken from Africa to America where the two live together. George and the Man with the Yellow Hat become friends.

George&#x27;s first appearance was as a monkey named &quot;Fifi&quot; in the book &quot;Cecily G. and the Nine Monkeys&quot;, which was first published in France during 1939 in the late years. The popularity of the character led the Reys to feature &quot;George&quot; in his own series.

==History==

=== Creation ===
The original series was written by the husband-and-wife team of Hans Augusto (H. A.) Rey and Margret Rey. The Jewish couple fled Paris in June 1940, on bicycles they had made themselves, carrying the &quot;Curious George&quot; manuscript with them. At first, only H. A. Rey was credited for the work in order to distinguish the Reys&#x27; books from the large number of children&#x27;s books written by female authors. The first seven books were illustrated by H.A. Rey. Later, Alan J. Shalleck was credited as an editor and Hans Rey and Margret Rey for the writing and illustrating. The Reys produced many other children&#x27;s books, but the &quot;Curious George&quot; series was the most popular. Each book has been in continuous print since it was first published.

=== Literature ===

Margret and H. A. Rey released seven &quot;Curious George&quot; books during H. A. Rey&#x27;s lifetime. Recently, more &quot;Curious George&quot; books have been released by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt including board books with scenes from the original books, books adapted from the 1980s telefilm series, and new adventures.

===Original adventures===
&quot;Curious George&quot; appeared in 1941. This book begins with George living in Africa and tells the story of his capture by the Man with the Yellow Hat, who takes him on a ship to &quot;the big city&quot; where he will live in a zoo. The second book, &quot;Curious George Takes a Job&quot; (1947), begins with George living in the zoo, from which he escapes and has several adventures before the Man with the Yellow Hat finds him and takes George to live at his house. The remaining five stories describe George&#x27;s adventures while living at the house of the Man with the Yellow Hat. Although the Man with the Yellow Hat is unnamed in both the original books and telefilm books, he receives his name in the Curious George TV series and is known as &quot;Theodore Shackleford&quot;.

Sometimes dubbed the &quot;Original Adventures&quot;, these original seven titles are completely by the series creators, Margret &amp; H. A. Rey.

* &quot;Curious George&quot; (1941)
* &quot;Curious George Takes a Job&quot; (1947)
* &quot;Curious George Rides a Bike&quot; (1952)
* &quot;Curious George Gets a Medal&quot; (1957)
* &quot;Curious George Flies a Kite&quot; (1958)
* &quot;Curious George Learns the Alphabet&quot; (1963)
* &quot;Curious George Goes to the Hospital&quot; (1966)

Before appearing in his own series, Curious George appeared as a character in another children&#x27;s book written and illustrated by H. A. Rey, &quot;Cecily G. and the Nine Monkeys&quot; (1939).

===Books adapted from telefilms===
A second series of books, based on the telefilm series, was edited by Margret &amp; H.A. Rey and Alan J. Shalleck. These appeared between 1984 and 1993. They are mostly out of print, though several have been re-released with new cover art as part of the next series, the &quot;New Adventures&quot;.

=== &quot;New Adventures&quot; ===
A third series of books, the Curious George &quot;New Adventures&quot;, began to appear in 1998, and continues to the present. These books are &quot;illustrated in the style of H. A. Rey&quot; by a variety of credited and uncredited artists including Mary O&#x27;Keefe Young, Martha Weston, Anna Grossnickle Hines, Michael Alan Jensen, and Vipah Interactive.

=== &quot;The Man with the Yellow Hat&quot; ===

Aside from George himself, the only recurring character in the original adventures is the Man with the yellow Hat who is George&#x27;s best friend and caretaker. The Man often facilitates George&#x27;s adventures by taking him somewhere, and even more often resolves the tension by intervening just in time to get George out of a tight spot. He is always seen wearing a bright yellow suit and a wide brimmed yellow hat. The Man is never mentioned by name in the original adventures or in any subsequent content over more than six decades.

He is always referred to as &quot;The Man&quot; or fully &quot;The Man with the Yellow Hat&quot; (abbreviated &quot;TMWTYH&quot;), but aside from those two names, he is unnamed in the original series and telefilm books. When people speak to George about the Man, they often refer to him as &quot;Your friend&quot;. In H. A. Rey&#x27;s book &quot;See the Circus&quot;, published in 1946, &quot;The Man with the Yellow Hat&quot; was referred to as &quot;Ted&quot;. Later, in &quot;Curious George&quot; (2006), the Man, who is voiced by Will Ferrell, is also referred to as &quot;Ted&quot; throughout the film; his last name is revealed as being &quot;Shacklefield&quot; in a deleted scene. In the TV series, he is voiced by Jeff Bennett.

==Other media==
&quot;Curious George&quot; has been adapted into a television show, magazine, and video game.

===Television===
A set of animated &quot;Curious George&quot; television films were produced from 1979 to 1982; they were first shown in the United States in 1984 on Nickelodeon. This series was produced and co-written by Alan Shalleck.

The shorts were aired on The Disney Channel as a segment on the program &quot;Lunch Box&quot; starting in 1989.

In 1993, Margret Rey successfully sued Lafferty, Harwood, and Partners, the Canadian company that funded the cartoons, for licensing VHS tapes to third-party companies without the Reys&#x27; permission. The Reys eventually won the dispute, forcing Lafferty, Harwood, and Partners to pay for all wrongdoing.

A new &quot;Curious George&quot; series debuted on September 4, 2006 on PBS Kids as part of the PBS Kids Preschool Block. Although &quot;Curious George&quot; ended its original run on April 1, 2015, the series is still airing on PBS Kids in reruns. It was produced by the Boston affiliate WGBH, Imagine Entertainment, and Universal Animation Studios. A revival of the series was released on the streaming service Peacock on July 15, 2020. It then ended March 17, 2022.

===Film===
The 2017 film &quot;Monkey Business: The Adventures of Curious George&#x27;s Creators&quot; documents the lives of Hans and Margret Rey including their flight from France during the 1940 invasion by Germany, their life in the United States, and their creation of the &quot;Curious George&quot; children&#x27;s books.

====Animated====
A minimal-animation 16 mm film called &quot;Curious George Rides a Bike&quot; was produced by Weston Woods Studios in 1958 and later released on DVD.

In 1982, animator John Clark Matthews produced a 16 mm stop-motion animated short called &quot;Curious George Goes to the Hospital&quot; based on the book of the same name. In 1984, they created another short, again based on the book of the same name. Produced by Churchill Films, the films were created with puppet-figures. Matthews would later use a similar technique for his &quot;Frog and Toad&quot; films.

An animated film, &quot;Curious George&quot;, was released on February 10, 2006, featuring Will Ferrell as the voice of the originally unnamed Man with the Yellow Hat. In the film (in which The Man is referred to as &quot;Ted&quot;), Curious George secretly follows The Man onto the ship to the city on his own accord. Frank Welker provided the vocal effects of Curious George. Ron Howard serves as the film&#x27;s producer.

A direct-to-video sequel to the film was released on March 2, 2010, titled &quot;Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey!&quot;, which featured Jeff Bennett replacing Ferrell as the voice of the Man. Bennett also provides the Man&#x27;s voice in the television series. The second direct-to-video sequel, &quot;Curious George 3: Back to the Jungle&quot;, was released on June 23, 2015. &quot;Curious George: Royal Monkey&quot; was released on September 10, 2019, while &quot;Curious George: Go West, Go Wild&quot; was released on Peacock on September 20, 2020. A sixth and final film, &quot;Curious George: Cape Ahoy&quot;, was released on Peacock on September 30, 2021. A Christmas film, &quot;Curious George: A Very Monkey Christmas&quot;, was released in 2009 on PBS. &quot;Curious George Swings Into Spring&quot; and &quot;Curious George: A Halloween Boo Fest&quot; were released in 2013. On Monday, August 6, it began to re-run on Cartoonito.

====Reboot====
A live action/animated film was in development at Illumination Entertainment in the beginning of the 2010s. In August 2016, Andrew Adamson was in negotiations to direct, co-write, and executive produce a live action film for Universal Pictures, along with Ron Howard, Brian Grazer, David Kirschner, Jon Shapiro and Erica Huggins producing it.

===Video game===
A &quot;Curious George&quot; video game was released on February 2, 2006, published by Namco and developed by Monkey Bar Games, a division of Vicious Cycle Software for Microsoft Windows, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Game Boy Advance. It is the based on the 2006 animated film. A version for the Nintendo DS was also planned, but was cancelled.

===Other===
A children&#x27;s bookstore in Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts was known as Curious George and Friends (formerly Curious George Goes To Wordsworth) and carried a considerable amount of licensed &quot;Curious George&quot; merchandise. It was the last remaining property of Wordsworth Books, a former local general interest bookstore that closed in the beginning of the 2000s. This store was closed in June 2011. A new store, the World&#x27;s Only Curious George Store, opened in 2012 at the same address and closed permanently in 2021.

From 2009 to 2011, a musical stage show based on the TV series, &quot;Curious George Live!&quot;, toured the United States and Canada. In the show, George heads to Rome, Italy to help Chef Pisghetti win a meatball eating contest there. The show was produced by VEE Corporation, the producer of &quot;Sesame Street Live!&quot;. As of 2024, the show continues to be performed in several community theaters and has been retitled &quot;Curious George: The Golden Meatball&quot;. 

&quot;Curious George&quot; is used as the theme for children&#x27;s play areas and some of the children&#x27;s entertainment on the Stena Line ferries. On some peak time sailings, this includes a Curious George costumed character. &quot;Curious George&quot; merchandise is also provided with children&#x27;s meals and is available to purchase in the on-board shop.

A &quot;Curious George&quot;-themed water play area, Curious George Goes to Town, opened at Universal Studios Florida in 1998 and was removed in 2023. The attraction was also featured at Universal Studios Hollywood until its removal in 2013.

In February 2006, the &quot;Curious George&quot; brand partnered with Welch&#x27;s jelly for a collection of six jars. In the latter part of that decade (when the new film and the new television show were released), licensing deals for the character generally involved less upscale, more kid-focused products. Earlier, Vivendi Universal (now NBCUniversal) had—for a short time—embraced the use of the character in a series of 2001 adverts for the company, but the character never officially became a corporate mascot.

=== In popular culture ===
In the 1994 film &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, one edition of &quot;Curious George&quot; is featured as Forrest&#x27;s favorite book, which his mother reads to him. Forrest later reads it with his son, with a Curious George plush also shown on his shelf. In the opening scene, a feather comes floating down to Forrest&#x27;s feet and he stores it in this book. At the end of the film, it falls out of the book and rises floating through the air again.

Jarrod, the protagonist of the NBC series &quot;The Pretender&quot;, reads &quot;Curious George&quot; books in season one and develops a fascination with them. He likens himself to George and Sydney Green to the Man with the Yellow Hat.

The books have inspired other derivative works, including &quot;Bangkok Bob&quot; (written by Sasha Alyson and published by the Lao publishing project Big Brother Mouse).

<text>Stanley Howard Knowles (June 18, 1908 – June 9, 1997) was a Canadian parliamentarian. Knowles represented the riding of Winnipeg North Centre from 1942 to 1958 on behalf of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and again from 1962 to 1984 representing the CCF&#x27;s successor, the New Democratic Party (NDP).

Knowles was widely regarded and respected as the foremost expert on parliamentary procedure in Canada, and served as the CCF and NDP House Leader for decades. He was also a leading advocate of social justice, and was largely responsible for persuading the governments to increase Old Age Security benefits and for the introduction of the Canada Pension Plan, as well as other features of the welfare state.

==Early life and career==
Born in Los Angeles, California, Knowles was the third child of Margaret (née Murdock) and Stanley Ernest Knowles of Canada. His father was a machinist from Nova Scotia and his mother was the daughter of a domestic servant from New Brunswick. The couple married in Nova Scotia and emigrated to the United States in 1904, four years before Stanley&#x27;s birth. He visited relatives on the Canadian Prairie when he was 16 and decided to stay and enrolled at Brandon College in 1927. Knowles was brought up as a fundamentalist Methodist but was won over to the social gospel movement, and became a United Church minister after meeting J. S. Woodsworth at the annual conference of the Student Christian Movement of Canada, a fledgling ecumenical social justice movement founded in 1921. Knowles was ordained in 1933 after graduating from theological college.

==Political career==
Knowles joined the CCF in 1934, during the Great Depression, and ran unsuccessfully for election to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1935 in Winnipeg South Centre and 1940 federal elections in Springfield and for the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1941 provincial election. He was first elected to the House of Commons in a 1942 by-election in Winnipeg North Centre that was held on the death of former CCF leader J. S. Woodsworth. He became an expert on parliamentary procedure, and used his skills to humiliate the Liberal government of Louis St. Laurent during the 1956 Pipeline Debate. This helped contribute to the government&#x27;s electoral defeat in the 1957 election.

Progressive Conservative Party leader John Diefenbaker was so impressed by Knowles&#x27;s skill that when he became prime minister as a result of that election, he asked Knowles to become Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada. Knowles declined. On April 3, 1957, Knowles noted that the reason only 37 of the 259 members of the House of Commons were present at the Chamber&#x27;s night session was because those not present had accompanied their daughters to a controversial concert by US singer Elvis Presley, which resulted in a non quorum situation. The year after, in 1958, Knowles was narrowly defeated by John MacLean, his Tory challenger in 1957, in an election that almost wiped out the CCF. His defeat in that election has been attributed both to the landslide victory won by Diefenbaker&#x27;s Tories, and to the fact that Knowles spent much of the campaign travelling across Canada as a surrogate for ailing leader M.J. Coldwell rather than campaigning in his own riding. He subsequently went to work for the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) as its executive vice-president, and worked with David Lewis to devise a strategy to create a new party that would bring the old CCF together with the labour movement by partnering the party with the CLC. This new party was launched as the New Democratic Party in 1961. Knowles ran as the new party&#x27;s candidate for his old seat in the 1962 election, and won. He played a crucial role through minority governments of the 1960s and 1970s using the NDP&#x27;s position holding the balance of power to persuade successive Liberal governments to introduce progressive measures.

Knowles was also known for his refusal to partake in many of the financial perks and entitlements available to a Member of Parliament. For the entirety of his career in politics, he boarded with the family of Susan Mann when in Ottawa rather than purchasing a residence of his own. Mann herself later published a biography of Knowles, &quot;Stanley Knowles: The Man from Winnipeg North Centre&quot;, in 1982.

In 1979, he became a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on the advice of Prime Minister Joe Clark.

==Retirement==
Knowles battled multiple sclerosis from 1946, but it was his 1981 stroke that ultimately removed him from public life. He retired from politics in 1984, but was given the unprecedented distinction of being made an honorary table officer of the House of Commons by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. This allowed him to spend his retirement viewing parliamentary debates from the floor of the House, and he was often seen to do so until further strokes left him bedridden.

In 1984, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. From 1970 to 1990, he was the chancellor of Brandon University, and today has the school&#x27;s student union building named after himself and Tommy Douglas. He also has an elementary / junior high school in northwest Winnipeg named after him. He died in 1997.

<doc id="752259" wikidata="Q183280" url="?curid=752259" title="Stargazer (fish)">
<text>The stargazers are a family, Uranoscopidae, of perciform ray-finned fish that have eyes on top of their heads (hence the name). The family includes about 51 species (one extinct) in eight genera, all marine and found worldwide in shallow and deep saltwaters.

== Description ==
In addition to the top-mounted eyes, a stargazer also has a large, upward-facing mouth in a large head. Their usual habit is to bury themselves in sand, and leap upwards to ambush prey (benthic fish and invertebrates) that pass overhead. Some species have a worm-shaped lure growing out of the floors of their mouths, which they can wiggle to attract prey&#x27;s attention. Both the dorsal and anal fins are relatively long; some lack dorsal spines. Lengths range from 18 up to 90 cm, for the giant stargazer &quot;Kathetostoma giganteum&quot;.

Stargazers are venomous; they have two large venomous spines situated behind their opercles and above their pectoral fins. The species within the genera &quot;Astroscopus&quot; and &quot;Uranoscopus&quot; can also cause electric shocks. &quot;Astroscopus&quot; species have a single electric organ consisting of modified eye muscles, while &quot;Uranoscopus&quot; species have theirs derived from sonic muscles. These two genera within stargazers represent one of eight independent evolutions of bioelectrogenesis. They are unique among electric fish in not possessing electroreceptors, meaning that they do not use an electric sense to locate prey.

Stargazers are a delicacy in some cultures (the venom is not poisonous when eaten), and they can be found for sale in some fish markets with the electric organ removed. Stargazers are ambush predators which camouflage themselves; some can deliver both venom and electric shocks. Ichthyologist William Leo Smith called them &quot;the meanest things in creation&quot;.

Uranscopidae contains the following genera:

<doc id="752260" wikidata="Q1142586" url="?curid=752260" title="Ford Field">
<text>Ford Field is a domed American football stadium located in Downtown Detroit. It primarily serves as the home of the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL), the Michigan Panthers of the United Football League (UFL), the Mid-American Conference championship game, and the annual GameAbove Sports Bowl college football bowl game, state championship football games for the MHSAA, the MHSAA State Wrestling Championships, and the MCBA Marching Band State Finals, among other events. The regular seating capacity is approximately 65,000, though it is expandable up to 70,000 for football and 80,000 for basketball.

The naming rights were purchased by the Ford Motor Company for $40 million over 20 years; the Ford family holds a controlling interest in the company, and they have controlled ownership of the Lions franchise since 1964.

==History==

===Planning and construction===
In 1975, the Lions moved to the Pontiac Silverdome after playing at Tiger Stadium from 1938 to 1939 and 1941 to 1974. By the mid-1990s, they began exploring the possibility of returning to the city of Detroit in order to build a new stadium. On August 20, 1996, the Lions announced their intention to build a new stadium in Downtown Detroit. On November 5, 1996, voters approved a referendum for the stadium.

Groundbreaking for the stadium occurred on November 16, 1999, as part of a downtown revitalization plan for the city of Detroit, which included Comerica Park.

==Design==
The stadium&#x27;s design incorporates a former Hudson&#x27;s warehouse, which was constructed in the 1920s. The warehouse was converted to office space and currently has Campbell Ewald and Bodman as tenants.

The presence of the warehouse allows for a seating arrangement that is unique among professional American football stadiums. The majority of suites are located in the warehouse along the stadium&#x27;s southern sideline, as are the lounges that serve the premium club seats on that side of the field. The bulk of the grandstand seats are located along the northern sideline and both end-lines, with gaps in the stadium&#x27;s upper half at the southwest and southeast corners. The upper deck on the stadium&#x27;s northern sideline also contains one level of suites and a smaller section of club seating. A similar design was implemented at the renovated Soldier Field, albeit with the use of a new structure (as opposed to an existing building) to house four levels of suites.

Unlike most prior domed stadiums, Ford Field allows a large amount of natural light to reach the field, thanks to immense skylights and large glass windows at the open corners. The windows along the ceiling are frosted to mimic the automotive factories that are prevalent in Metro Detroit. The south entrance provides the seating bowl and concourse with sunlight year-round and also offers fans a view of downtown Detroit. To prevent the stadium from becoming an overly imposing presence in the Detroit skyline, the playing field is below street level, similar to the design at adjacent Comerica Park.

Ford Field is one of the few venues in the NFL that has end zones in the east and the west. There is no NFL rule for field construction in roofed venues regarding sunlight distracting players on the field. The east–west end zone design accommodated the Hudson warehouse location. The natural light is not a distraction to the players in a day game, because the light only reaches as far as the sidelines, leaving the field still properly lit with the combination of artificial stadium lighting and sunlight.

In 2017, Ford Field underwent its first major renovation. The $100 million renovation included new video boards, a new sound system, updated suites, and the renovation of multiple restaurants, clubs, and bars on the property.

==Major events==

===Football===
Ford Field hosted Super Bowl XL on February 5, 2006, as the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Seattle Seahawks, 21–10 to win their fifth Super Bowl championship in front of 68,206 in attendance. It also marked the final game in the 13-year career for Steelers running back, and Detroit native, Jerome Bettis.

The stadium was home to the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl sponsored by Detroit-based Little Caesars (previously known as the Motor City Bowl and jointly sponsored by the Big Three automakers headquartered in Detroit – Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors) from 2002 until 2013. It featured a top Mid-American Conference (MAC) team and a Big Ten Conference team. The Little Caesars Pizza Bowl was replaced by the Quick Lane Bowl, later known as the GameAbove Sports Bowl, which is backed by the Lions. It has also hosted the annual MAC Football Championship Game since 2004.

Ford Field has been the site of several neutral site regular season college football games, including Western Michigan vs. Illinois in 2008 and Michigan State vs. Florida Atlantic in 2010. Central Michigan was set to play Western Michigan at Ford Field on October 17, 2020, before the football season for the conference were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Penn State and Michigan State played a neutral field regular season game on November 24, 2023, a Black Friday game televised by NBC in primetime. Penn State won the game 42–0.

On December 13, 2010, the Minnesota Vikings played a home game at Ford Field against the New York Giants after the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome&#x27;s inflatable roof collapsed due to a rip in the roofing material caused by heavy snow accumulation. The roof failure forced the already postponed game to be moved elsewhere, and after deliberations, the NFL chose Ford Field. It was the first ever regular season Monday night game played at Ford Field, and one of the few instances where a team played an unofficial home game at another (rival) team&#x27;s home field. The Lions hosted their first ever &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game in Ford Field on October 10, 2011, against the Chicago Bears.

A Buffalo Bills home game against the New York Jets was played at Ford Field on November 24, 2014, after a major lake effect snowstorm hit western New York, causing the game to be moved from Ralph Wilson Stadium. The Bills won the game 38–3. A similar scenario took place on November 20, 2022, when the Bills&#x27; home game against the Cleveland Browns was also moved to Ford Field. The Bills won the game 31–23.

On December 3, 2015, Ford Field was the site of the Miracle in Motown, where on the final play of regulation between the Lions and Green Bay Packers on &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot;, with no time remaining on the game clock and Detroit leading 23–21, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers threw a Hail Mary pass into the end zone that was caught by tight end Richard Rodgers for the game-winning touchdown. The play resulted in a dramatic 27–23 come-from-behind victory for the Packers. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it is the longest game-winning Hail Mary in NFL history.

The Lions hosted their first playoff game at Ford Field against the Los Angeles Rams on January 14, 2024. The Lions won the game 24–23. The Lions hosted their second playoff game at Ford Field against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on January 21, 2024. The Lions won the game 31–23.

===Basketball===
On December 13, 2003, Ford Field hosted the then largest crowd ever to attend a basketball game, as 78,129 people packed the stadium for the Basketbowl, where the Kentucky Wildcats defeated the Michigan State Spartans, 79–74.

The University of Detroit Mercy and Ford Field hosted the 2008 NCAA basketball tournament regional semifinal and final games (March 28 and 30). Ford Field was the site of the 2009 Final Four (April 4 and 6). For the 2008 NCAA basketball tournament, the court was placed in the center of the football field rather than in an end of the stadium. This was the first time this configuration was used for NCAA Tournament play with the new 70,000-seat capacity rule in effect. Ford Field will host the Final Four again in 2027 (April 3 and 5).

===College hockey===
The 2010 Frozen Four was held on April 8 and 10 with Boston College defeating Wisconsin to win the championship. This has been the only time NCAA hockey has used a football stadium for the championship (inspired in part by their college basketball counterparts) and resulted in the largest attendance (37,592) at a Frozen Four event.

===High school competitions===
Ford Field has hosted the MHSAA football state championships since 2005. It also hosted the MHSAA individual wrestling state finals in 2018.

The stadium also hosts the MCBA finals, where Michigan high school marching bands compete to be the best in the state.

===Soccer===
Ford Field hosted two group stage matches of the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup soccer tournament on June 7, 2011. Panama played Guadeloupe in the first match, while the United States played Canada in the second match.

In 2016, Dan Gilbert and Tom Gores announced a bid for a Major League Soccer expansion franchise, first looking at building a new open-air stadium in downtown Detroit, then focusing on playing at Ford Field, which would be retrofitted with a retractable roof. However, in 2018, Gilbert and Gores and the Ford family would &quot;not move forward with this proposed retrofit, because the risks that would inhere to such an undertaking would substantially outweigh the rewards&quot;.

===Other competitions===
The Professional Bull Riders brought their Built Ford Tough Series tour to Ford Field for the first time ever on March 10, 2012. Ford Field is the second Detroit area venue the BFTS has visited; they had visited The Palace of Auburn Hills in 2001, 2006 and 2007.

The United States Hot Rod Association (USHRA) holds multiple Monster Jam Monster Truck races at Ford Field. These races were previously held in the Pontiac Silverdome until it was closed. AMA Supercross Championship, also a Feld Entertainment competition, has competed at Ford Field from 2006 to 2008 and 2014 to 2017.

===Other events===
On April 1, 2007, Ford Field hosted WWE&#x27;s WrestleMania 23. This event set a Ford Field attendance record of 80,103. It was the first WrestleMania held in the Detroit area since 93,173 fans set a world indoor attendance record at the Pontiac Silverdome for WrestleMania III in 1987. WWE returned to the venue for SummerSlam on August 5, 2023.

Ford Field hosted the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) Midwest Regional in 2007 and 2014.

In 2015, Ford Field housed the large group gatherings of the ELCA Youth Gathering.

On November 18, 2017, Ford Field hosted the Beatification Mass of Fr. Solanus Casey, a Capuchin Franciscan Friar who ministered at the nearby St. Bonaventure Monastery on Mt. Elliott. The near-capacity crowd was one of the largest Catholic masses in Detroit history.

Ford Field hosted the FIRST Championship in 2018 and 2019 along with the nearby Cobo Center. The 2020 event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="752261" wikidata="Q8031607" url="?curid=752261" title="Women of Sand and Myrrh">
<text>Women of Sand and Myrrh is a novel written by Hanan al-Shaykh. It is al-Shaykh&#x27;s fifth novel. It was originally published in 1989 as &quot;Misk al-ghazal&quot; () and was published in English in 1992. The English translator is Catherine Cobham. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; chose &quot;Women of Sand and Myrrh&quot; as one of the 50 best books of 1992.

The storyline consists of four main characters: Suha, Tamr, Nur, and Suzanne. Different sections of the novel give the perspectives of the four women, making the book a story with four different narrators. Suha and her husband have escaped from war-torn Lebanon into the unnamed country; despite this, Suha finds herself miserable and bored, and cheats on her husband with the wealthy and spoiled Nur. Suzanne is an American housewife who has also arrived with her husband; her husband is no longer attracted to her, but Suzanne discovers that she is extremely attractive to the local men. Tamr is an poor Turkish woman who tries to establish her own business, but struggles as a divorcee with no rights.

The story is based in a relatively modern society in the Middle East. Rather than having strong ties into the pre-20th century Middle East, it is representative of life in some of the more fundamentalist societies within the last few decades. Elements of the book are present in this society today:

* Women wearing abayas and using different infrastructure elements.
* Mandatory prayers at certain times of the day
* Patriarchal society; many view women as good for little except raising children.
* Implementation of desalinization plants (a large clue that the main setting is Saudi Arabia), airports, etc.

The novel addresses many issues in today&#x27;s society and has a wide variety of themes. Main themes of the novel include differing gender roles, class distinctions, culture, religion, and materialism vs. romanticism. Themes include:

* Men vs. women
* Feminism
* Use and/or abuse of power in a relationship
* Class distinctions
* Structure of society
* Rebellion against the status quo
* Culture and religion
* Freedom vs. Confinement/Restraint
* Elements of traditional culture and their effect
* Materialism vs. Romanticism
* The sexual disadvantages and existing desires of Arab women
* Hidden Lesbianism in Arab cultures
* The Innate desire of Arab women to be treated better

&quot;Women of Sand and Myrrh&quot; was banned in many Arabic lands for strong content (sexual, political, etc.) and for a strong treatment of Arabic culture.

==Critical reception==
Kirkus Reviews praised the novel, calling it &quot;a promising debut&quot;. Publishers Weekly likewise gave a positive review.

Elise Salem Manganaro, writing for the Middle East Studies Association, criticized the style of the novel, but otherwise praised the novel for its themes and relevance to the modern world. Edward Said called the novel one &quot;Western feminists should read&quot;. Hannadi al-Samman criticized the depiction of lesbian relationships in the novel, writing that lesbian love in the novel is portrayed as merely an inferior alternative to heterosexuality.

<text>Joseph Ashbrook (April 4, 1918 – August 4, 1980) was an American astronomer.

==Biography==
Ashbrook was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He received a doctorate from Harvard University in 1947 and taught at Yale University from 1946 to 1950, and at Harvard from 1950 to 1953. He started to work at &quot;Sky and Telescope&quot; in 1953, where he wrote the column &quot;Astronomical Scrapbook&quot; from 1954 to 1980, and remained on its staff until his death; he also edited the magazine from 1964 on.

Ashbrook was one of the first to study Cepheid variables as tools for establishing galactic distances. He was a longtime member of the AAVSO.

He went through old archives of observations from centuries past to determine a highly precise value for the rotation period of Mars —to within a few thousandths of a second.

He co-discovered the periodic comet 47P/Ashbrook-Jackson in 1948.

<doc id="752273" wikidata="Q200763" url="?curid=752273" title="Kirchheimbolanden">
<text>Kirchheimbolanden, is the capital and the second largest city of the Donnersbergkreis, in Rhineland-Palatinate. Situated in south-western Germany, it is approximately 25 km west of Worms, and 30 km north-east of Kaiserslautern.

The first part of the name, &quot;Kirchheim&quot;, dates back to 774. It became a town in 1368, and the Sponheim family improved its security with many towers and walls. William, Duke of Nassau, ancestor of the royal families of Belgium, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and of the grand-ducal family of Luxembourg, was born in Kirchheimbolanden. It was also ruled by the First French Empire between 1792 and 1814, before passing to the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1815. It was a rural district centre in the &quot;Rheinkreis&quot;, which was renamed &quot;Pfalz&quot; (Palatinate) in 1835.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Kirchheim&quot; was first mentioned in the Lorsch codex on 28 December 774, which can be traced back to the 7th century, where a parish church stood in present-day Kirchheimbolanden named &quot;St. Remigius&quot;. The term &quot;Kirch&quot; is derived from the Old High German word for &quot;church,&quot; while the suffix &quot;-heim&quot; was commonly used during the Frankish colonisation to denote a &quot;home&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot;. After Kirchheimbolanden gained town privileges in 1368, it was first mentioned as &quot;Kirchheim bei Bolanden&quot; in 1370, owing its name to the .

==History==
===Middle ages===
The place Kirchheim was first mentioned in 774, later it belonged to the Lords of Bolanden.

It is mentioned in the Wormser wall-building ordinance from around 900 as one of the places that shared responsibility for maintaining the city wall of Worms. At the end of the 13th century, Kirchheim was inherited by the Sponheim branch line Bolanden-Dannenfels. Count Heinrich II. Von Sponheim-Bolanden raised the village to a town in 1368 and made it his residence. Via his granddaughter Anna von Hohenlohe († 1410) and her husband Philipp I, Count of Nassau-Weilburg, Kirchheimbolanden and the entire Sponheim-Bolander family property finally fell to the Nassau House, which owned it until the end of the feudal period.

===Early modern age===
Charles August, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg moved his residence from Weilburg to Kirchheim in 1737. Charles Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg temporarily owned his own infantry regiment (1755–1759) in Mannheim with the Elector of the Electoral Palatinate and was temporarily general of the Netherlands, where he was governor. Frederick William, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg (1788–1816) left the city in 1793 because of the French Revolution and went to Bayreuth. This ended the time as the royal seat for Kirchheimbolanden, then only called Kirchheim.

It experienced its greatest heyday under Prince Charles August (1719–1753) and especially under Carl Christian (1753–1788) of the House of Nassau-Weilburg and his rich, clever and musical wife Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau.

===From the 19th century===
After 1792, French revolutionary troops occupied the region and after the Treaty of Campo Formio (1797), annexed the left bank of the Rhine. From 1798 to 1814, Kirchheim belonged to the French department of Donnersberg and was the main town (chef-lieu) of the canton of the same name.

Due to the agreements made at the Congress of Vienna (1815) and an exchange contract with Austria, the region became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1816. From 1818, Kirchheim was the seat of a land commissioner in the Bavarian Rhine circle.

When the Rhenish Hessian Legion hurriedly evacuated Kirchheim from a Prussian overwhelming power during the Palatinate uprising on June 14, 1849, Palatine militants remained in the palace garden without notification. In the battle of Kirchheimbolanden in the presence of the Prince of Prussia, 17 militants were killed.

From 1939, the place was part of and administrative seat of the district of the same name. After the Second World War, Kirchheimbolanden became part of the then newly formed state of Rhineland-Palatinate, within the French occupation zone. In the course of the first Rhineland-Palatinate administrative reform, the city moved in 1969 to the newly formed Donnersbergkreis and its seat; three years later, Kirchheimbolanden was incorporated into the also newly created community of the same name.

==Geography==
===Location===
Kirchheimbolanden lies in the Palatinate at the transition point of the Nordpfälzer Bergland to the Alzeyer Hügelland bordering to the east. The city centre is located about four kilometres (as the crow flies) northeast of Donnersberg on the slope of Wartberg, also known as Schillerhain. The Leiselsbach, a left tributary of the Pfrimm, rises in the urban area. The lowest point lies at 229 m above sea level, the highest at 496 m above sea level.

===Coat of arms===

Blazon: &quot;Divided; at the top of silver and black sheathed in three rows, at the bottom in green a black boar striding to the right.&quot;

Justification of the coat of arms: The coat of arms was awarded by King Ludwig I of Bavaria on January 30, 1844, and was last confirmed on June 18, 1976, by the district government, Neustadt an der Weinstrasse. It comes from a city seal from the 14th century. The chess (actually blue and gold) comes from the coat of arms of Count Heinrich II. Von Sponheim-Bolanden (Grafschaft Sponheim), who in 1368 obtained town rights from Emperor Charles IV in 1368. The boar is reminiscent of the Counts of Eberstein, former masters of Stauf Castle, who temporarily held local authority.

<doc id="752278" wikidata="Q1058931" url="?curid=752278" title="Georgia Dome">
<text>The Georgia Dome was a domed stadium in the Southeastern United States. Located in Atlanta between downtown to the east and Vine City to the west, it was owned and operated by the State of Georgia as part of the Georgia World Congress Center Authority. Opened in 1992, it was then the second-largest covered stadium in the world by capacity, behind the Pontiac Silverdome. Though the Georgia Dome was a profitable facility, its primary tenant, the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League, grew dissatisfied with it less than two decades after its opening and began planning for a replacement stadium. It was closed and demolished in 2017.

In addition to the Falcons, the Georgia Dome was also the home of the Georgia State University Panthers football team. It hosted two Super Bowls (XXVIII and XXXIV), 25 editions of the Peach Bowl (January 1993–December 2016) and 23 SEC Championship Games (1994−2016). In addition, the Georgia Dome also hosted several soccer matches since 2009 with attendances over 50,000. In its 25 years of operation, the Georgia Dome hosted over 1,400 events attended by over 37 million people. The Georgia Dome was the only stadium in the United States to host the Summer Olympics, Super Bowl and NCAA men&#x27;s basketball Final Four. The Georgia Dome also hosted Wrestlemania 27 with The Rock as the host, and it was the biggest event in the venue. John Cena vs The Miz was the main event for the WWE Championship.

The Georgia Dome&#x27;s successor, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, was built adjacent to the south and opened on August 26, 2017. The Georgia Dome was demolished on November 20, 2017.

==History==

===Facility information===
The Georgia Dome was completed in 1992 in time for the 1996 Summer Olympics at a cost of $214 million, making it one of the largest state-funded construction projects in Georgia history. The stadium seated 71,228 for football, approximately 80,000 for concerts, and 71,000 for basketball when the stadium fully opened and 40,000 for basketball and gymnastics when the stadium was sectioned off (one half closed off by a large curtain). For most Georgia State football games, the dome was configured with 28,155 seats, with tickets for only the bulk of the lower level and the club-level seats on sale. The record for overall attendance at the Georgia Dome came during a college football game, with 80,892 at the SEC Championship Game in 2008.

The Dome had 5,740 club seats and 171 luxury boxes. The executives suites fit 16-24 people, while eight super-suites added in 2007 were capable of accommodating 57-96 guests. There were also four restaurants/bars. There were 12 escalators and 9 elevators.

The structure was located on of land; the Dome had a height of , a structure length of , a structure width of , and a total floor area of . The stadium was the largest cable-supported dome in the world. Its roof was made of teflon-coated fiberglass fabric and had an area of . From its completion until the December 31, 1999, opening of the Millennium Dome in London, it was the largest hooked domed structure of any type in the world. Matt Hartley Lighting, LLC designed the lighting for the concourse of the Georgia Dome.

===Surface===
The Georgia Dome originally used AstroTurf artificial surface for its football events. In 2003, Arthur Blank, the new owner of Atlanta Falcons, funded the installation of the new infilled FieldTurf artificial surface system.

===Renovations===
In 2006, the Atlanta Falcons and the Georgia World Congress Center Authority announced a $300 million renovation to the Georgia Dome. The project was separated into two stages. The first stage, which took place before the 2007 NFL season, focused on updating the premium seating areas, including the creation of eight &#x27;super-suites&#x27; as well as an owners&#x27; club, most of them now incorporating new plasma TVs. In 2008, the exterior of the stadium was repainted, replacing the original teal and maroon color scheme with a red, black, and silver theme to match the Falcons&#x27; team colors; the stadium&#x27;s original teal seats were replaced with red seats in the lower and upper levels and black seats in the middle level. The entrance gates and concourses were also renovated and updated before the 2008 football season. In 2009, the video screens in both end zones were relocated to a new exterior monument sign on Northside Drive. The interior end zones each received a new and considerably wider HD video screen that significantly enhanced views of replays, as well as graphics and digital presentations. A new sound system was installed in the same year, replacing the previous system that was nearly 20 years old.

In 2008, the Georgia Dome started showing safety videos before games, presented by Deltalina, flight attendant &quot;mascot&quot; of Delta Air Lines. The videos satirize Delta&#x27;s massively popular &quot;Deltalina&quot; inflight safety videos. The videos&#x27; theme was &quot;Delta Safety First&quot;.

===Major weather-related issues===
Three years after the completion of the Dome, the integrity of its roof became an issue. During a Falcons pre-season game in August 1995, a severe rainstorm caused water to pool on the fabric, tearing part of the material, and causing a section of the roof to fall into the stadium. The storm was intense enough that the roof panels could be seen moving during the game, and the water and roof material later fell with enough force to smash seats in the upper decks and knock holes in concrete floors. The collapse occurred after fans left the stadium, and no one was injured during the incident. The roof was eventually repaired in a way that prevented similar incidents from occurring in the future.

In the 2008 Atlanta tornado outbreak on March 14, 2008, during the 2008 SEC men&#x27;s basketball tournament, a tornado ripped two holes in the dome during the Alabama–Mississippi State quarterfinal game, delaying the game for about an hour. The quarterfinal game to follow between the Kentucky Wildcats and Georgia Bulldogs was postponed until the following day. The resulting damage forced the rest of the tournament to be moved to the Alexander Memorial Coliseum, now known as McCamish Pavilion, at Georgia Tech.

===Final years and replacement===


In 2010, the Georgia World Congress Center Authority announced plans for a new stadium just south of the Georgia Dome. At the time, the Georgia Dome had just completed a major update and was still relatively young. The Dome had been designed specifically for football while a handful of NFL teams still made do with multi-purpose stadiums shared with MLB teams; plus, the Dome had plenty of luxury suites and premium seating which were important revenue-generating features lacking other older venues which made them obsolete. Nonetheless, sports economist Rod Fort noted that pro sports team owners &quot;thought they could get away with demanding new&quot; stadiums every year with public money; plus, the Falcons did not have control of the Dome nor the profits, which made them less competitive than other teams that owned state-of-the-art facilities. In addition, Arthur Blank &quot;wanted a state-of-the-art facility for his NFL and MLS teams and was willing to pitch in a huge amount of money to make it happen&quot;, as well as wanting to host another Super Bowl. Also with the Atlanta climate the Falcons long desired to play outdoors in either an open-air stadium or retractable roof stadium rather than inside a dome. At the time it was planned to retain the Georgia Dome to continue hosting non-NFL events.

In justifying the need for a new venue, Falcons CEO and president Rich McKay said that the Georgia Dome &quot;was a really functional building that served its purpose very well. We did not want to build a better Georgia Dome. That was not the object. If we would have done that, we would have renovated the Georgia Dome. We really wanted to change the game and do it for a long, long time.&quot; Stadium general manager Scott Jenkins described the new stadium&#x27;s advantages over the Dome, saying &quot;The LED displays we have, whether it&#x27;s every seat is two-inches wider than the Georgia Dome, almost all the concourses connect so you can circumnavigate the building, you don&#x27;t get cut-off. You can move vertically throughout the building, we have really wide staircases, we have twice the elevators, twice the escalators compared to the Georgia Dome&quot;. McKay said of it, &quot;The architecture, I think, speaks for itself. I hope the first time you&#x27;re in it, yeah, you&#x27;re wowed by the architecture, but more wowed by the fan experience.&quot; &quot;SB Nation&quot; noted that while the &quot;Georgia Dome did its job for 24 years...it wasn&#x27;t anything special. That&#x27;s not the case with [the Mercedes-Benz Stadium]. Walking up to it feels like you&#x27;re approaching a darn spaceship&quot;.

The new stadium, which would be known as Mercedes-Benz Stadium, received approval from the city of Atlanta, Fulton County, and Georgia state governments in 2013. Construction commenced and ground was broken in 2014.

The Falcons&#x27; final game in the Dome was the 2016 NFC Championship Game on January 22, 2017, with a 44–21 victory over the Green Bay Packers, that sent the Falcons to their second Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. The stadium&#x27;s final public event took place on March 4 and 5, 2017, with back-to-back Monster Jam shows.

===Demolition===
Shortly after the Georgia Dome&#x27;s closing, a group presented a petition to the governor&#x27;s office to save the stadium from demolition, arguing that it was still in good condition and that its loss would be wasteful. While the Falcons initially sought an open-air stadium to complement the Georgia Dome, GWCCA officials ultimately concluded that maintaining two 70,000-seat stadiums was not financially feasible, and the Georgia Dome&#x27;s fate was already sealed when Mercedes-Benz Stadium was approved in 2013.

Demolition of the Georgia Dome was intended to begin shortly after the stadium&#x27;s final event; however, due to construction delays caused by the complexity of Mercedes-Benz Stadium&#x27;s eight-panel retractable roof, demolition of the Georgia Dome was postponed until the new stadium&#x27;s certificate of occupancy could be issued. GWCCA officials stated that the Georgia Dome would remain nominally operational until Mercedes-Benz Stadium was ready; however, the Dome&#x27;s artificial turf had been removed and its offices vacated prior to the announcement of the new stadium&#x27;s delay.

On June 9, 2017, Steve Cannon, CEO of the Falcons&#x27; parent company AMB Group, stated that construction officials were confident that Mercedes-Benz Stadium would be ready in time for the Falcons&#x27; first preseason game, and the process of decommissioning the Georgia Dome had resumed, with the Dome scheduled for implosion on November 20, 2017, at 7:30 am EST.

In July 2017, GWCCA officials removed equipment they intend to reuse either at Mercedes-Benz Stadium or elsewhere on the GWCC campus while other equipment was liquidated by sealed bids. Most of the seats in the lower and middle bowls were sold in bulk to high schools and colleges while pairs were sold to individuals; most of the upper bowl seats were recycled. The stadium&#x27;s lower bowl and loading docks were demolished by mid-August. From September 16 to 30, 2017, memorabilia from the Georgia Dome was sold in an online auction format by Schneider Industries.
Demolition officials from Adamo Demolition, the company contracted for the job, stated that the pressure from the implosion needed to go up from the roof and not out through the sides to ensure that Mercedes-Benz Stadium and other nearby buildings were not damaged during the demolition; to protect nearby structures, construction felt was placed over the four corners of the Dome, and a tall fence covered in the same material was erected between the Dome and Mercedes-Benz Stadium. To ensure that the roof fell in place during the implosion, parts of the concrete ring supporting the roof had been chipped away and ventilation holes were cut into the roof fabric. of explosives were used to bring the Dome down within 12 seconds.
Due to the large exclusion zone required for the demolition, no public viewing areas were made available; additionally, Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority officials announced that rail service west of the Five Points station would be suspended on the day of demolition until MARTA safety inspectors certified that the tunnels which run below the Dome site were safe for trains to operate. GWCCA officials stated that the implosion would be broadcast live by WSB-TV as well as livestreamed on the official websites of the Falcons, Atlanta United FC, and Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Live coverage of the implosion on the Weather Channel was blocked at the last moment by a MARTA bus that stopped in front of the camera just seconds before the implosion.

While the implosion was considered successful with the roof and a majority of the structure felled, the eastern wall and the northwest gate of the Dome were left standing after the implosion. Although the Dome&#x27;s proximity to adjacent structures was a major concern, with Mercedes-Benz Stadium only away from the Dome, demolition officials stated that bringing the roof down was the biggest challenge due to its unique design. The Georgia World Congress Center and Mercedes-Benz Stadium were undamaged during the first implosion, although the new stadium did receive a heavy dusting. Initially, demolition officials stated that the two remaining sections would be brought down manually with hydraulic excavators; however, after inspections determined that the explosive charges did not detonate, a supplementary implosion took place on the morning of December 20 at 1:00 am EST. A window at one of the GWCC buildings was shattered during the second implosion but was quickly replaced.

Following the implosion, most of the concrete from the Georgia Dome remained on site, crushed into smaller pieces to be used as infill material while steel and other materials were separated and recycled. Most of the Georgia Dome site became greenspace for tailgating at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and other community events. On April 21, 2017, GWCCA officials announced that The Home Depot acquired the naming rights to the park prior to its construction, adopting the name of &quot;The Home Depot Backyard&quot;. Cleanup of debris from the Georgia Dome site was completed by late February 2018 with construction of the Home Depot Backyard beginning shortly thereafter; the new park officially opened on September 11, 2018. Ground was broken for a new high-rise convention center hotel on May 19, 2021, which opened in January 2024. The hotel is located between the Home Depot Backyard and GWCC Building C, and is the first newly constructed hotel for Hilton&#x27;s Signia brand.

A historical marker erected by the GWCCA and the Georgia Historical Society commemorating the Georgia Dome&#x27;s legacy was dedicated on September 6, 2018.

==Events hosted==
===Football===

The Dome was home to the NFL&#x27;s Atlanta Falcons. The stadium also hosted Super Bowl XXVIII in 1994 and Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000. The Falcons failed to qualify for the playoffs both seasons that the Dome hosted the Super Bowl; despite a 14–2 regular season in 1998 which was capped off with a Super Bowl appearance, the Falcons slumped to a 5–11 record in 1999. The final NFL Game at the Georgia Dome was the 2016 NFC Championship between the Falcons and the Green Bay Packers, won by the Falcons 44–21 to advance to their second Super Bowl in franchise history.

The Dome was also the annual host (since 1998) to FCS Classic football game between Florida A&amp;M Rattlers and another HBCU opponent (Southern Jaguars in 2011 and Tennessee State Tigers in prior years), and the annual host to the Southeastern Conference Football Championship Game and the Chick-fil-A Bowl (also known as the Peach Bowl) post-season college football games. From 2015 to 2016, the Dome hosted the Celebration Bowl, the annual post-season bowl match up between the MEAC and SWAC. On January 2, 2006, the Georgia Dome hosted the Nokia Sugar Bowl, between the University of Georgia and West Virginia University. The game was held in Atlanta, Georgia, since the game&#x27;s usual venue, the Louisiana Superdome, was unable host due to damage caused by Hurricane Katrina.

From the program&#x27;s inception in 2010 until 2016, the stadium was home of the NCAA Division I Georgia State Panthers of Georgia State University. Subsequently, with the Dome&#x27;s impending closure, the university acquired the Atlanta Braves&#x27; former Turner Field baseball park and renovated it to Georgia State Stadium for college football.

The Georgia Dome also annually hosted the Georgia High School Association (GHSA) football semi-finals until 2007 and hosted the football state championships from 2008 to 2016.

===Basketball===
The Georgia Dome hosted the NCAA Final Four Men&#x27;s Basketball National Championship in 2002, 2007, and 2013, along with regional semi-finals and finals in 2001, 2004, 2006 and 2012 and NCAA Women&#x27;s Final Four in 2003. The SEC men&#x27;s basketball tournament has been held at the Georgia Dome during 10 seasons, most recently in 2014. The ACC men&#x27;s basketball tournament has been held at the Georgia Dome on two occasions, in 2001 and 2009. The NCAA Division I Basketball&#x27;s Champions Classic was held at the dome in 2012.

It was also one of two homes, along with the facility then known as Alexander Memorial Coliseum, for the NBA&#x27;s Atlanta Hawks during the construction of State Farm Arena from 1997 to 1999 on the site of the former Omni Coliseum. While playing at the Georgia Dome on March 27, 1998, the Atlanta Hawks set a then-NBA single-game attendance record with 62,046 fans against Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls.

===Olympics===
For the 1996 Summer Olympics, one half of the arena hosted the basketball competitions (including final) while the other half hosted the artistic gymnastics events and team handball (men&#x27;s final).

===Soccer===
The Georgia Dome held a number of international soccer matches. On June 24, 2009, the Dome hosted its first ever soccer match between Mexico and Venezuela in front of 51,115 fans, with grass laid over the FieldTurf. On February 9, 2011, Mexico and Bosnia and Herzegovina played a friendly match in front of 50,507 fans. On July 20, 2013, the Dome hosted two quarter-final match-ups of the 2013 Gold Cup—Panama vs. Cuba and Mexico vs. Trinidad &amp; Tobago—in front of 54,229 fans.

The stadium was an official candidate venue for hosting matches as part of the United States&#x27; bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but Qatar was selected to host the tournament.

===Other events===
The Georgia Dome was also a prominent stop for many music acts including Alabama, Guns N&#x27; Roses, U2, KISS, The Rolling Stones, Elton John, Billy Joel, Taylor Swift, Chuck Berry, Smash Mouth, The Beach Boys, Kid Rock, Phil Collins, Backstreet Boys, Korn, Metallica, Skillet, Beyoncé, One Direction and many more. It was also home to the video game convention E3 from 1997 to 1998.
In 1998, Gaither Homecoming hosted two Homecoming concerts, &quot;Atlanta Homecoming&quot; and &quot;All Day Singin&#x27; At The Dome&quot;.
===Drum Corps International===
The stadium also hosted the Drum Corps International (DCI) Southeastern Championship from 2006 to 2016. The inaugural event featured 22 drum corps in the old fashioned Prelims/Finals one-day format. During the competition, the stadium was the first, and only indoor rain delay, when an upper deck rain gutter leaked inside the stadium. The 2006 competition was won by The Cavaliers, becoming the first of only four corps to win in the 11 years the stadium hosted the event.

From 2007 to 2014, the Blue Devils would win an unprecedented 8 straight victories at the annual Southeastern Championship. The win streak would be snapped in 2015 by Carolina Crown with its fan-favorite production of &quot;Inferno&quot;

With the announcement of the Mercedes-Benz Stadium to be opened in the summer of 2017, the 2016 tour season would be the last hurrah inside the dome. Though the 2016 season would be the last in the dome, it would prove to be a historical one at that, with the Bluecoats powering their way to the top to win the last competition in the stadium, bringing the corps&#x27; first Southeast Championship and later on their first DCI World Championship Title.

While the 2017 show was scheduled to be in the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium, construction delays would make the venue not ready for the July 29 event, which would find a temporary home at McEachern High School in Powder Springs. DCI hosted the 2018 and 2019 Southeast Championships at the new stadium.

===Wrestling===
The Georgia Dome hosted WrestleMania XXVII on April 3, 2011, as well as WrestleMania Axxess in the Georgia World Congress Center; WrestleMania XXVII was the last WWE event held in the Georgia Dome.

&quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; was hosted in the Georgia Dome twice in 1998 and twice again in 1999; &quot;WWE Monday Night Raw&quot; was hosted 4 times in the stadium between 1999 and 2001.

<text>Raymond James Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Tampa, Florida, United States. It opened in 1998 and is home to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL) and the University of South Florida (USF) Bulls college football program. The seating capacity for most sporting events is 69,218, though it can be expanded to about 75,000 for special events with the addition of temporary seating. Raymond James Stadium was built at public expense as a replacement for Tampa Stadium and is known for the replica pirate ship located behind the seating area in the north end zone. Raymond James Financial, a financial service firm headquartered in the Tampa Bay area, has held the naming rights for the stadium for the stadium&#x27;s entire existence.

Besides serving as the home field for the Buccaneers and the Bulls, the facility has been the site of three Super Bowls: XXXV in 2001, XLIII in 2009, and LV in 2021, in the third of which the Buccaneers became the first team in NFL history both to play and to win a Super Bowl on their home field. In college football, Raymond James Stadium is the home of the annual Tampa Bowl (since 1999) and Gasparilla Bowl (since 2018), hosted the ACC Championship Game in 2008 and 2009, and was the site of the College Football Playoff National Championship in 2017. Additionally, the stadium has hosted a wide variety of non-football events, including soccer matches, equestrian sports competitions, monster truck shows, and large concerts. It was also the site of WrestleMania 37 in April 2021.

==History==
=== Financing and construction ===
Immediately upon purchasing the Buccaneers in 1995, new owner Malcolm Glazer declared that twenty-eight year old Tampa Stadium was inadequate to justify the record $192 million he paid for the NFL franchise and began lobbying local government for a replacement. A few months later, the city of Tampa and Hillsborough County unveiled plans for a $168 million stadium that was to be paid for with a rental car surtax along with fees on items relating to stadium events, such as ticket surcharges and parking fees. However, the Glazer family rejected the plan within hours because it would reduce their revenue, and when local and state government officials did not agree on an alternative taxpayer-financed plan quickly enough for their liking, they threatened to move the Buccaneers elsewhere and were soon meeting with officials from several other cities to explore possible relocation sites.

In early 1996, the city of Tampa and Hillsborough County proposed the establishment of a &quot;Community Investment Tax&quot;, a 30-year half-cent sales tax increase that would pay for various public improvements along with a new stadium for the Bucs. The tax increase would have to be approved in a public referendum, which was scheduled for September. The &quot;Community Investment Tax Stadium&quot; (CITS) proposal was heavily promoted by the team along with several prominent local officials, and as part of intensive public relation campaign, Malcolm Glazer repeatedly promised to pay half the cost of the new stadium if fans put down 50,000 deposits on 10–year season ticket commitments priced at $190 to $2500 per seat. Former Tampa mayor Bill Poe sued to halt the referendum, as he claimed that the tax violated the Florida state constitution&#x27;s ban on public support for private companies. Poe&#x27;s objections were rejected, and plans for the vote were allowed to proceed.

Public opinion polls indicated that support for the CITS proposal was still limited as election day neared, with the main reasons being a &quot;negative reaction&quot; to the Glazers&#x27; tactics and unwillingness to raise taxes to &quot;help&quot; owners who &quot;overpaid&quot; for an NFL team. In response, stadium proponents launched a &quot;media blitz&quot; of television and radio advertisements emphasizing the tax&#x27;s potential impact on local schools and roads in an attempt to persuade residents who did not want to pay for a football stadium to &quot;hold their nose&quot; and vote yes anyway. On September 3, 1996, the ballot measure passed by a margin of 53% to 47%. After the vote, the season ticket deposit drive fell 17,000 short of its 50,000 goal at the team-imposed deadline, the Buccaneers&#x27; offer to pay half of stadium construction costs was withdrawn, and the facility was designed and built entirely at public expense.

Before construction began on the stadium, the Buccaneers and the Tampa Sports Authority signed a lease in which local government paid the vast majority of operating and maintenance expenses while the franchise kept almost all of the proceeds from all events held there. Former Tampa mayor Bill Poe went back to court to challenge the legality of the lease, again citing the state&#x27;s constitutional ban on using tax dollars to enrich a private business in claiming that the &quot;sweetheart deal&quot; should be voided. A local court ruled in Poe&#x27;s favor, but upon appeal, the Supreme Court of Florida ruled that the lease was constitutional because the stadium provided a &quot;public benefit&quot;, and construction continued as planned.

In 1998, a 13-year deal was agreed with Raymond James Financial, headquartered in St. Petersburg, for naming rights to the stadium. The deal was extended for 10 years in 2006 and again in 2016, and the deal is currently set to expire in 2027.

=== Opening, further developments ===

The stadium officially opened on September 20, 1998, when the Buccaneers defeated the Bears, 27–15. The stadium hosted its first Major League Soccer match on March 20, 1999, after the Tampa Bay Mutiny relocated from Houlihan&#x27;s Stadium; the Mutiny lost their first match at Raymond James 5–2 to D.C. United with 16,872 in attendance. The Mutiny folded after the 2001 season after facing declining revenue due to declining attendance and the Bucs&#x27; lease at Raymond James Stadium, which saw the Mutiny receiving no money from parking or concessions. They played their last home match on September 9, 2001, a 2–1 loss to the Columbus Crew. The team had an average attendance of 10,479 per match in their final season at Raymond James Stadium.

In April 2003, the Tampa Sports Authority proposed passing ownership of the stadium to Hillsborough County to avoid having to pay millions of dollars in property taxes (the Bucs&#x27; lease agreement dictated that they not have to pay property taxes). However, Bucs had a right of refusal and refused to sign off on the plan unless the local government paid more of the cost for gameday security and increased the amount of (county-purchased) insurance coverage for the stadium. The dispute continued for months until December 2003, when the county legally declared the stadium a condominium and took ownership. As part of the change, the Bucs were given ownership of portions of the structure. To win the Bucs&#x27; approval, the county agreed to refund the team&#x27;s resultant property tax payments annually.

After a nearly two-year legal battle, the Tampa Sports Authority came to a settlement with popular sports-seating and telescopic platform/bleacher company Hussey Seating of North Berwick, Maine. Following the stadium&#x27;s opening in 1998, roughly 50,000 Hussey-manufactured seats at Raymond James Stadium began to fade from their original color – a bright, vibrant shade of red – to a shade of washed-out pink. Spotting this obvious defect, the Buccaneers organization pleaded to the TSA to sue the seating manufacturing company for the cost to replace the affected chairs in 2003. Initially, in May 2004, after testing samples of the seats, Hussey Seating did not find any cause for the fading, and thus, found no reason to replace the seats at the company&#x27;s cost under the current 10–year warranty. After the TSA cited a portion of the warranty which did, in fact, state that Hussey would replace seats if any fading were to occur, Hussey president Tim Hussey admitted an error in the research and eventually would come to a $1.5 million agreement with the TSA to replace the problem seats. Reportedly, the seat-fading occurred due to a manufacturing error by Hussey, as a UV inhibitor – a sunscreen-like component for the plastic – was forgotten in the mixture used to create the seats. All of the problem seats were replaced by new, non–pink seats in the spring of 2006.

In December 2015, the Buccaneers and the Tampa Sports Authority reached an agreement to complete over $100 million in improvements and renovations to the stadium. The negotiations took months, and were extended by Bucs&#x27; lawyers demanding additional concessions after an agreement was near in September 2015. In the end, the upgrades were paid with at least $29 million of public money, with the remainder paid for by the Bucs in exchange for the right to play a home game at another site beginning in the 2018 season and other concessions. Renovations began in January 2016, and the first phase was complete in time for the 2016 football season.

==Features==

One of the most recognizable features of the stadium is a , 43-ton steel-and-concrete replica pirate ship in the north end zone, making it stand out from other NFL stadiums. Each time the Buccaneers score points, enter the other team&#x27;s red zone, or win a home game, the replica cannons on the ship are fired off. The cannons fire once for each point scored. In addition, when the Buccaneers enter their opponent&#x27;s red zone, the cannons fire once, and flags are hoisted and waved around the stadium. The cannons are also used during pre-game player introductions. During various times throughout the game, the song &quot;Yo Ho (A Pirate&#x27;s Life for Me)&quot; is played on the stadium public address system (taken from Pirates of the Caribbean), which signals patrons on board the ship to throw beads, T-shirts, and other free prizes to the spectators below. The segment is also known as a &quot;Mini Gasparilla&quot; to most fans. An animated parrot sits on the stern of the pirate ship. Controlled by radio and remote control, the parrot picks fans out of the crowd and talks to those passing by. The pirate ship&#x27;s sails, which for NFL games usually shows Buccaneers logos and sponsors, are often changed to suit the event that it hosts.

The two &quot;Buc Vision&quot; Daktronics video displays were among the largest in the league when they were built. In 2016 they were replaced with , HD video boards in both end zones. &#x27;Buccaneer Cove&#x27; in the north end zone features a weathered, two–story fishing village facade, housing stadium concessions and restrooms. All areas of the stadium are ADA compliant.

Temporary bleachers were erected in the end zones for Super Bowl XXXV, which set a then-record stadium attendance of 71,921. The stadium attendance record has since been surpassed by the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship, which also made use of temporary seating. Super Bowl XLIII and Super Bowl LV used temporary seating as well.

In 2003, the corner billboards in the stadium were replaced with rotating trilon billboards. Those were subsequently replaced in 2016 with high visibility video displays.

Raymond James Stadium boasts the second-best turf in the NFL, according to a 2009 biannual players&#x27; survey.

In early 2016, the stadium was given an extensive facelift. The most notable improvement was the replacement of the video displays with state of the art, high visibility video displays in both the north and south end zones along with the addition of a new video tower in each corner. All together, the video displays cover more than , the third-largest video displays in the NFL. The original sound system and the stadium&#x27;s luxury boxes were also upgraded.

Before the 2022 season, some of the temporary seats used for Super Bowls and other special events were set up in the south end zone, bringing the capacity to 69,218. They were removed after the season, following Tom Brady’s retirement. 

==Naming==
During construction, the facility was known as Tampa Community Stadium. In June 1998, prior to its opening, the naming rights were bought by St. Petersburg-based Raymond James Financial for $32.5 million in a 13–year agreement. Contract extensions signed in 2006 and 2016 have extended the naming rights deal through 2028.

The stadium is referred to as &quot;Ray Jay&quot;. Somewhat derisively, it has been occasionally referred to as &quot;the CITS&quot;, a name coined by long-time local sportscaster Chris Thomas which stands for &quot;Community Investment Tax Stadium&quot;, referring to the fact that the stadium was entirely financed by local taxpayers.

==Notable events==
=== American Football ===
====Super Bowl====
Raymond James Stadium has hosted the Super Bowl three times: Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, and Super Bowl LV in 2021. In Super Bowl LV, the Buccaneers became the first team in NFL history to play a Super Bowl in their home stadium, which they won 31–9. Like previous Super Bowls, the league treated Super Bowl LV as a neutral site game, with the pirate ship&#x27;s Buccaneer-logo sails replaced with Super Bowl sails. The league also did not allow the Buccaneers to fire the ship&#x27;s cannons during the game. The cannons are normally fired after every score by the Buccaneers and when their offense enters the red zone. The cannons were only fired during player introductions and were fired 31 times after the end of the game to represent the Buccaneers&#x27; 31 points. The Buccaneers were coincidentally the designated home team for Super Bowl LV, as the home team alternates between the two conferences annually.

WWE planned to host WrestleMania 36—the 2020 edition of its flagship professional wrestling pay-per-view—at Raymond James Stadium on April 5. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, WWE subsequently filmed it at its training facility in Orlando instead, behind closed doors with no audience and only essential staff present. In January 2021, WWE announced that WrestleMania 37 (which was originally announced as being hosted by SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California) would be hosted by Raymond James Stadium on April 10 and 11, 2021. The event had a reported attendance of 25,675 each night, a combined total of 51,350 spectators on both nights, a sellout reported by the company.

<text>State Route 74 (SR 74), part of which forms the Palms to Pines Scenic Byway or Pines to Palms Highway, and the Ortega Highway, is a state highway in the U.S. state of California. It runs from Interstate 5 in San Juan Capistrano in Orange County to the city limits of Palm Desert in Riverside County. Stretching about , it passes through several parks and National Forests between the Pacific coast and the Coachella Valley.

==Route description==
SR 74 begins at an interchange with I-5 in the city of San Juan Capistrano and heads east as the Ortega Highway, loosely paralleling San Juan Creek. The highway leaves the San Juan Capistrano city limits and turns northeast, going through the community of Rancho Mission Viejo and entering Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park and eventually Cleveland National Forest. After going through San Juan Hot Springs, SR 74 enters Riverside County.

The highway continues winding through the Santa Ana Mountains and passes through the community of El Cariso before descending into the city of Lake Elsinore. SR 74 continues northwest on Grand Avenue before continuing northeast on Riverside Drive and continuing along the shore of Lake Elsinore. The road continues southeast on Collier Avenue before continuing northeast on Central Avenue and intersecting I-15. SR 74 leaves the city of Lake Elsinore and continues through unincorporated Riverside County before turning east and entering Perris. After traveling through downtown, SR 74 merges with I-215 and runs concurrently with I-215 before exiting the freeway as Matthews Road.

SR 74 travels southeast through the Romoland area of Menifee and turns east to become Pinacate Road, continuing through Homeland and Green Acres before running concurrently with SR 79 as Florida Avenue through Hemet. SR 79 splits off and heads north towards San Jacinto while SR 74 continues through East Hemet and Valle Vista before entering the San Bernardino National Forest. The Palms to Pines Highway parallels San Jacinto Creek as it winds through the mountains before intersecting SR 243 in Mountain Center and providing access to the Hemet Reservoir. SR 74 follows the Garner Valley Wash through Garner Valley before meeting the eastern terminus of SR 371. The road crosses the Santa Rosa Indian Reservation before going through the communities of Ribbonwood and Pinyon Pines and turning north along Deep Canyon and becoming the western boundary of the University of California Desert Research Area.

As the highway descends to the Coachella Valley area, it parallels Carrizo Creek before entering the city limits of Palm Desert, where SR 74 meets its current legal eastern terminus. The SR 74 designation continued into Palm Desert as a city arterial to its eastern terminus at SR 111, which has also had its state highway designation removed through Palm Desert.
Route 74 passes through many parks and National Forests along its route. Some of these places include the San Bernardino National Forest, the Cleveland National Forest, the Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park, Lake Elsinore State Recreation Park, the Soboba Indian Reservation, Lake Hemet, Santa Rosa Indian Reservation, and Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument.

SR 74 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and for a portion near I-15 as well as from I-215 to the eastern Hemet city limits is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 74 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System; however, it is only a scenic highway as designated by Caltrans from the western boundary of the San Bernardino National Forest to its junction with SR 111. State Route 74 is called the California Wildland Firefighters Memorial Highway (from Lake Elsinore to San Juan Capistrano), as designated by various state laws. The Palms to Pines Scenic Byway is a National Forest Scenic Byway.

==History==
The route has been signed as Route 74 since the establishment of state routes in 1934. Its original corridor between then CA 71 Corona Freeway (later I-15W) and present-day I-215 (then, I-15E and U.S. Route 395) was numbered as U.S. 395, through downtown Perris. East of the CA 74/U.S. 395 junction, from Romoland-east, was CA 740 (Florida Avenue).

The western portion of Route 74 in Orange County follows San Juan Creek and is named the Ortega Highway, after the Spanish explorer Sgt. José Francisco Ortega who led the scouts of the 1769 Portola expedition, first non-natives to ever see the area.

Route 74 between San Juan Capistrano and Lake Elsinore, due to its narrow width and high traffic volume, is known as one of the most dangerous highways in the state.

California&#x27;s legislature has relinquished state control of segments of SR 74 in Perris and Palm Desert, and turned it over to local control. This includes deleting from the highway code an unconstructed segment that would have extended SR 74 from SR 111 to Interstate 10.

On August 11, 1930, the Riverside County Board of Supervisors officially named the highway &quot;from San Jacinto Mountains to the Desert&quot; as the Palms to Pines Highway.

==In media==
* A segment of Route 74 named &quot;Seven Level Hill,&quot; just south of Palm Desert, California, appears in the 1963 American comedy film &quot;It&#x27;s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; during the opening minutes of the film, when the major characters of the film meet for the first time following a car accident.
* Scenes from the 1954 American comedy film &quot;The Long, Long Trailer&quot; were shot on the Pines to Palms Scenic Byway (State Route 74) in Palm Desert.
* The rock band Kyuss, which formed in Palm Desert, titled the opening track of their 1991 debut album Wretch, &quot;(Beginning of What&#x27;s About to Happen) Hwy 74&quot;.

<text>Keiem is a small town situated some 7 km north of Diksmuide in West Flanders, Belgium. Administratively it forms part of Diksmuide Municipality.

Lying close to the right bank of the River Yser, the town suffered extensive flooding when, on 21 October 1914, the sea locks at the mouth of this river were opened as a defensive measure against the advancing German Army during the &quot;Race to the Sea&quot; phase of World War I. The operation was successful in halting the advance, with the result, however, that Keiem was to occupy the front line of the war for the next four years. By the end of the conflict, apart from three damaged houses which still stood, the town had been completely flattened.

<text>The 8th Division was an infantry division of the Australian Army, formed during World War II as part of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force. The 8th Division was raised from volunteers for overseas service from July 1940 onwards. Consisting of three infantry brigades, the intention had been to deploy the division to the Middle East to join the other Australian divisions, but as war with Japan loomed in 1941, the division was divided into four separate forces, which were deployed in different parts of the Asia-Pacific region. All of these formations were destroyed as fighting forces by the end of February 1942 during the fighting for Singapore, and in Rabaul, Ambon, and Timor. Most members of the division became prisoners of war, waiting until the war ended in late 1945 to be liberated. One in three died in captivity.

==History==
===Formation===
The 8th Division began forming in July 1940, with its headquarters being established at Victoria Barracks, in Sydney. The division&#x27;s first commander was Major General Vernon Sturdee. The third division raised as part of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force, the formation was raised amidst an influx of fresh volunteers for overseas service following Allied reverses in Europe. Consisting of around 20,000 personnel, its principal elements were three infantry brigades, with various supporting elements including a machine gun battalion, an anti-tank regiment, a divisional cavalry regiment, and engineer, signals and other logistic support units. Each infantry brigade also had an artillery regiment assigned.
The three infantry brigades assigned to the division were the 22nd, 23rd and 24th. These were raised in separate locations: the 22nd (Brigadier Harold Taylor) in New South Wales, the 23rd (Brigader Edmund Lind) in Victoria and Tasmania and the 24th (Brigader Eric Plant) in the less populous states of Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. In September 1940, a reorganisation of the 2nd AIF resulted in the 24th Brigade being sent to North Africa, where it became part of the 9th Division. It was replaced in the 8th Division by the 27th Brigade (Brigadier Duncan Maxwell), which was the last 2nd AIF brigade to be formed. The division&#x27;s cavalry regiment was also transferred to the 9th Division.

While it had initially been planned for the 8th Division to deploy to the Middle East, as the possibility of war with Japan loomed, the 22nd Brigade was sent instead to Malaya on 2 February 1941 to undertake garrison duties there following a British request for more troops. This was initially a temporary move, with plans for the brigade to rejoin the division, which would then be transferred to the Middle East. Meanwhile, the 23rd Brigade moved to Darwin in April 1941. The 2/22nd Battalion was detached from it and deployed to Rabaul, New Britain that month, as part of plans to deploy to the islands to Australia&#x27;s north in the event of war with Japan; ill-prepared, poorly equipped and hastily deployed, they would ultimately be destroyed. The 27th Brigade joined the 22nd Brigade in Malaya, in August. The remainder of the 23rd Brigade was split into another two detachments: the 2/40th Battalion to Timor, while the 2/21st Battalion went to Ambon in the Dutch East Indies. In October 1941, the 23rd Brigade officially taken off the division&#x27;s order of battle, to simplify command arrangements, which had been strained by the splitting of the division&#x27;s brigades.

===Malaya===


As war broke out in the Pacific Japanese forces based in Vichy French-controlled Indochina quickly overran Thailand and invaded Malaya. The loss of two British capital ships, HMS &quot;Repulse&quot; and HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, off Malaya on 10 December 1941, neutralised Allied naval superiority, allowing the Japanese to perform amphibious assaults on the Malayan coast with much less resistance. Japanese forces met stiff resistance from III Corps of the Indian Army and British units in northern Malaya, but Japan&#x27;s superiority in air power, tanks and infantry tactics forced the British and Indian units, who had very few tanks and remained vulnerable to isolation and encirclement, back along the west coast towards Gemas and on the east coast towards Endau.

On 14 January 1942, parts of the division went into action for the first time south of Kuala Lumpur, at Gemas and Muar. The 2/30th Battalion had some early success at the Gemencheh River Bridge, carrying out a large-scale ambush which destroyed a Japanese battalion. Following this, the Japanese attempted a flanking towards Muar. The 2/29th and the 2/19th Battalions were detached as reinforcements for the 45th Indian Infantry Brigade, which was in danger of being overrun near the Muar River. By 22 January, a mixed force from the two battalions, with some Indian troops, had been isolated and forced to fight their way south to Yong Peng. Members of the Imperial Japanese Guards Division massacred about 135 Allied prisoners at Parit Sulong, following the fighting. Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Anderson, acting commander of the 2/19th, was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in leading the break out.

On the east coast, the 22nd Brigade fought a series of delaying actions around Mersing, as the Japanese advanced. On 26 January, the 2/18th Battalion launched an ambush around the Nithsdale and Joo Lye rubber plantations, which resulted in heavy Japanese casualties and briefly held up their advance allowing the 22nd Brigade time to withdraw south. Meanwhile, the remainder of the 27th Brigade waged a rearguard action around the Ayer Hitam trunk road, while the 22nd Brigade was sent back to guard the north end of the Johore–Singapore Causeway which linked the Malayan Peninisula to Singapore, as Allied forces retreated.

===Singapore===

As Allied forces in Malaya retreated towards Singapore, a 2,000-strong detachment of 8th Division reinforcements arrived in Singapore, including the 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion. These reinforcements were largely provided to the 2/19th and 2/29th Battalions which had suffered heavy casualties in Malaya, although most had not completed basic training and they were ill-prepared for the fighting to come. By 31 January, the last British Commonwealth forces had left Malaya, and engineers blew a hole wide in the causeway. The Allied commander, Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival, gave Major General Gordon Bennett&#x27;s 8th Division the task of defending the prime invasion points on the north side of the island, in a terrain dominated by mangrove swamps and forest. The 22nd Brigade was assigned a daunting wide sector in the west of the island amidst a tangle of islets and mangrove swamps, and the 27th Brigade a zone in the north-west, near the causeway. From vantage points across the straits, including the Sultan of Johore&#x27;s palace, as well as aerial reconnaissance and infiltrators, the Japanese commander, General Tomoyuki Yamashita and his staff gained an excellent knowledge of the Allied positions. From 3 February, the Australian positions were shelled by Japanese artillery. Shelling and air attacks intensified over the next five days, destroying communications between Allied units and their commanders.

At 8.30 pm on 8 February, Australian machine gunners opened fire on vessels carrying a first wave of 16 infantry battalions, totalling around 4,000 Japanese troops, towards Singapore Island, concentrating on the positions occupied by the 3,000-strong 22nd Brigade. While the artillery fired thousands of rounds in response to support calls, confused and desperate fighting raged throughout the evening. Eventually the increasing Japanese numbers, poor siting of defensive positions, and lack of effective communications, allowed Japanese forces to exploit gaps in the Australian lines. By midnight the two 8th Division infantry brigades, the 22nd and 27th, were separated and isolated, and the 22nd had begun withdrawing towards Tengah. By 1:00 am, further Japanese troops – bringing the total to 13,000 – had begun landing and as the main Australian force was pushed back towards Tengah airfield, small groups of troops that had been bypassed by the Japanese fought to rejoin their units as they had withdrawn toward Tengah airfield. Around dawn on 9 February a further 10,000 Japanese troops landed, and as it became clear that the 22nd Brigade was being overrun and it was decided to form a secondary defensive line to the east of Tengah airfield and north of Jurong.

The 27th Brigade had not yet faced an attack. However, the next day, the Japanese Imperial Guard made a botched landing in the northwest, suffering severe casualties from drowning and burning oil in the water, as well as Australian mortars and machine guns. In spite of the 27th Brigade&#x27;s success, as a result of a misunderstanding between Brigadier Duncan Maxwell and Bennett, they began to withdraw from Kranji in the north. That same day, communication problems and misunderstandings, led to the withdrawal of two Indian brigades, and loss of the crucial Kranji–Jurong ridge through the western side of the island.

The Australian battalions attempted several local counterattacks as they attempted to shore up their lines. One such attack, saw the Bren carriers of the 2/18th Battalion conduct a mobile ambush. Nevertheless, the British Commonwealth forces steadily lost more ground, with Japanese penetrating to within five miles of Singapore urban centre, by 10 February capturing Bukit Timah. On 11 February, knowing that his own supplies were running low, Yamashita called on Percival to &quot;give up this meaningless and desperate resistance&quot;. The next day the Allied lines attempted to stabilise along the Krangi–Jurong line on west side of the island, with an ad hoc battalion of Australian reinforcements being committed to hasty counterattack. This was eventually cancelled, but the battalion was not recalled, and it was later set upon by the Japanese 18th Division as the Japanese recommenced offensive actions. Meanwhile, the 27th Brigade attempted to retake Bukit Timah, but the attack was repulsed by stubborn defence from Japanese Imperial Guards troops.

On 13 February, Bennett and other senior Australian officers advised Percival to surrender, in the interests of minimising civilian casualties. Percival refused but unsuccessfully sought authority to surrender from his superiors. The following day the remaining British Commonwealth units battled on. The Australians established a defensive perimeter to the north-west of the city centre around Tanglin Barracks, while preparations were made to mount a final stand. Meanwhile, civilian casualties mounted as civilians crowded into the area now held by the Allies and bombing and artillery attacks intensified. Civilian authorities began to fear that the water supply would soon give out. Japanese troops killed 200 staff and patients after they captured Alexandra Barracks Hospital.

By the morning of 15 February, the Japanese had broken through the last line of defence in the north and food and some kinds of ammunition had begun to run out. After meeting his unit commanders, Percival contacted the Japanese and formally surrendered the Allied forces to Yamashita, shortly after 5:15–pm. Bennett created an enduring controversy when he handed over the 8th Division to the divisional artillery commander, Brigadier Cecil Callaghan, commandeered a boat and managed to escape captivity. According to Frank Owen, his lack of inspired leadership was exemplified by one of his last orders: because of lack of ammunition he issued orders that Australian gunners were only to offer artillery support in their own sector. He did not inform Percival of this order.

In the aftermath, almost 15,000 Australians became prisoners of war at Singapore, an absolute majority of all Australian prisoners of the Japanese in World War II. Due to Japanese mistreatment and neglect, many died in the prisoner of war camps, and around 2,400 Australian prisoners died in the Sandakan Death Marches. A small number were able to escape POW camps and continue fighting either by making their way back to Australia, or as members of guerrilla units (for example Jock McLaren).

Analysis of the 8th Division&#x27;s performance in Malaya and Singapore has been mixed. According to Lindsay Murdoch, a classified wartime report blamed the Australians for the loss of Singapore, with reports that in the closing stages of the battle groups of Australian troops were seen heading away from battle leaderless, impossible to control and engaging in various crimes. The division&#x27;s role in the defence of Singapore has also been criticised by some authors, such as Colin Smith and several others, as being defeatist and ill-disciplined. Although, others such as Peter Thompson and John Costello have argued that the 22nd Brigade was &quot;so heavily outnumbered that defeat was inevitable&quot;, while both authors argue that tactical and strategic decisions made by Bennett and Percival, were more significant.

According to Smith, Bennett described his own troops as &quot;wobbly&quot; and Brigadier Harold Taylor, commander of the 22nd Brigade, told his men they were a &quot;disgrace to Australia and the AIF.&quot; Colonel Kappe, Bennett&#x27;s Chief Signals Officer, related that &quot;one party of 50 under an officer, after being steadied and persuaded to occupy a locality, soon afterwards vacated it without order.&quot; According to Smith, Bennett himself is reported to have told another Australian commander, shortly before leaving his command, &quot;I don&#x27;t think the men want to fight.&quot; In contrast, historian Christopher Coulthard-Clark argues that the division was one of the only British Commonwealth forces to have any tactical success in Malaya, while Thompson points out that the division bore the brunt of the fighting on Singapore, arguing that despite making up only 14 percent of the Singapore garrison, the division suffered 73 percent of its casualties. Equally, the British commander of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders singled out the Australian 2/29th as fighting with &quot;great coolness&quot; and worthy of entering battle with them, while Masanobu Tsuji wrote that in Malaya the Australians &quot;fought with a bravery…not previously seen&quot;.

===Rabaul===

The 2/22nd Battalion—composed of 716 men—made up the majority of the combat personnel in the Lark Force, the name given to the 1,400-strong garrison concentrated in Rabaul, New Britain, from March 1941. Lark Force also included personnel from the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles, a coastal defence battery, an anti-aircraft battery, an anti-tank battery and a detachment of the 2/10th Field Ambulance. The island, part of the Australian territory of New Guinea was important because of its proximity to the Japanese territory of the Caroline Islands, including a major Japanese Navy base on Truk Island. The main tasks of Lark Force were protection of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) airfield and flying boat anchorage, which were important in the surveillance of Japanese movements in the region. A 130-strong detachment from the 2/1st Independent Company was detached to the nearby island of New Ireland.

In January 1942, Lark Force came under heavy attack by Japanese aircraft, which neutralised coastal artillery. In the early hours of 23 January 1942, 5,000 Japanese marines began to land. Some faced fierce resistance, but because of the balance of forces, many landed unopposed. Amidst the onslaught, fighting took place around Simpson Harbour, Keravia Bay and Raluana Point, while a company of troops from the 2/22nd and NGVR fought to hold the Japanese around Vulcan Beach. Nevertheless, the Japanese were able to bypass most of the resistance and move inland, and after a short fight, Lakunai airfield had been captured by the Japanese force. Following this, the Lark Force commander, Lieutenant Colonel John Scanlan, ordered the Australian soldiers and civilians to split into small groups and retreat through the jungle. Only the RAAF had made evacuation plans and its personnel were removed by flying boats and a single Hudson bomber.

The Australian Army had made no preparations for guerrilla warfare, and most soldiers surrendered during the following weeks. At least 130 Australians, taken prisoner at the Tol Plantation, were massacred on 4 February 1942. From mainland New Guinea, some civilians and individual officers organised unofficial rescue missions and—between March and May—about 450 troops and civilians who had managed to evade the Japanese, were evacuated by sea. At least 800 soldiers and civilian prisoners of war lost their lives on 1 July 1942, when the ship on which they were sent from Rabaul to Japan, the &quot;Montevideo Maru&quot;, was sunk off the north coast of Luzon by the US submarine USS &quot;Sturgeon&quot;.

A handful of Lark Force members remained at large on New Britain and—often in conjunction with indigenous people—conducted guerrilla operations against the Japanese. Rabaul became the biggest Japanese base in New Guinea. Allied forces landed in December 1943, although substantial Japanese forces continued to operate on New Britain until Japan surrendered in August 1945. By the end of the Pacific War, more than 600 members of the 2/22nd Battalion had died.

===Ambon===

The island of Ambon, in the Dutch East Indies, was perceived to be under threat from Japan because of its potential as a major air base. However, by mid-December 1941, only two flights of RAAF light bombers were deployed there, along with assorted obsolete US Navy and Royal Netherlands Navy aircraft. The 8th Division&#x27;s 1,100-strong Gull Force, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Leonard Roach, commanding officer of the 2/21st Battalion, arrived on 17 December. In addition to the 2/21st Battalion, it included 8th Division artillery and support units. The existing Royal Netherlands East Indies Army garrison, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Kapitz, consisted of 2,800 Indonesian colonial troops, with Dutch officers. Kapitz was appointed Allied commander on Ambon. Roach had visited the island before Gull Force&#x27;s deployment and requested that more artillery and machine gun units be sent from Australia. Roach complained about the lack of response to his suggestions, and he was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel John Scott on 13 January 1942.

Ambon first came under attack from Japanese aircraft on 6 January. Against the Japanese seaplane bombers, the limited Allied air defences held out, but on 24 January Japanese carrier-based Zeroes began appearing and eventually the remaining aircraft were withdrawn, having been completely out-classed. On 30 January, a Japanese fleet including two aircraft carriers and about 5,000 Japanese marines and soldiers reached Ambon. Although the Japanese ground forces were numerically not much bigger than the Allies, they had overwhelming superiority in air support, naval and field artillery, and tanks. In the belief that the terrain of the southern side of the island was too inhospitable for landings, the Allied troops were concentrated in the north. However, the initial Japanese landings were in the south, while other landings found the more lightly defended southern beaches. The Australians had been tasked with defending the Bay of Ambon, and the Laha and Liang airfields.

Following the initial landing, the Allied troops had to move quickly to re-orientate towards the advancing Japanese troops, and in the process large gaps formed in the defensive perimeter. Within a day of the Japanese landing, the Dutch forces had been surrounded and were forced to surrender. The Australians of Gull Force withdrew westwards, and held out until 3 February, when Scott surrendered. While small parties were able to escape to Australia, the majority – almost 800 men – were taken prisoner.

According to Australian War Memorial principal historian, Dr. Peter Stanley, several hundred Australians surrendered at Laha Airstrip. At intervals for a fortnight after the surrender, more than 300 prisoners taken at Laha were executed. The government of Australia states that, &quot;the Laha massacre was the largest of the atrocities committed against captured Allied troops in 1942.&quot; Of Australian prisoners of war on Ambon, Stanley provides the following description of their captivity: &quot;they suffered an ordeal and a death rate second only to the horrors of Sandakan, first on Ambon and then after many were sent to the island of Hainan late in 1942. Three-quarters of the Australians captured on Ambon died before the war&#x27;s end. Of the 582 who remained on Ambon 405 died. They died of overwork, malnutrition, disease and one of the most brutal regimes among camps in which bashings were routine.&quot; A total of 52 members of Gull Force managed to escape from Ambon. Of those captured from Gull Force, only 300 survived the war.

===Timor===
In 1941, the island of Timor was divided into two territories under different colonial powers: Portuguese Timor and West Timor part of the Dutch East Indies. The Australian and Dutch governments agreed that, in the event of Japan entering World War II, Australia would provide forces to reinforce West Timor. Consequently, a 1,400-strong detachment, known as the Sparrow Force, and centred on the 2/40th Battalion, arrived at Kupang on 12 December 1941.

The force was initially commanded by Lieutenant Colonel William Leggatt. It also included the Australian commandos of the 2/2nd Independent Company. Sparrow Force joined about 650 Dutch East Indies and Portuguese troops and was supported by the 12 Lockheed Hudson light bombers of No. 2 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force, and a troop from the British Royal Artillery&#x27;s 79th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery. The Allied forces were concentrated around the strategic airfield of Penfui. As the government of Portugal declined to cooperate with the Allies, a force composed of the 2/2nd Independent Company and Dutch forces occupied Portuguese Timor, without any resistance being offered by the Portuguese Army or officials. Additional Australian support staff arrived at Kupang on 12 February, including Brigadier William Veale, who was to be the senior Allied officer on Timor. By this time many of the Australians, unused to tropical conditions, were suffering from malaria and other illnesses.

Timor came under attack from Japanese aircraft on 26 January. The bombing, hampered by AA guns and a squadron of US Army Air Forces fighters based in Darwin, intensified during February. Air attacks forced an Allied convoy—escorted by the destroyers HMAS &quot;Swan&quot; and HMAS &quot;Warrego&quot;—to return to Australia. It had included valuable reinforcements, such as a US Army artillery battalion and the remainder of the British AA battery.

During the night of 19/20 February, the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s 228th Regimental Group, began landing in Portuguese Timor. The first contact was at Dili, the capital of Portuguese Timor, where the Allies were caught by surprise. Nevertheless, they were well-prepared and after inflicting heavy casualties on the troops attacking the airfield, the garrison destroyed the airfield and began an orderly retreat towards the mountainous interior and the south coast. On the same night, Allied forces in West Timor were under extremely intense air attacks, which had already caused the RAAF force to be withdrawn to Australia. Sparrow Force HQ was immediately moved further east, to its supply base at Champlong, and soon lost contact with the 2/40th.

The 2/40th&#x27;s line of retreat towards Champlong had been cut off by the dropping of about 500 Japanese paratroopers, who established a strong position near Usua. Sparrow Force HQ moved further eastward and Leggatt&#x27;s men launched a sustained and devastating assault on the paratroopers. By the morning of 23 February, the Allies had killed all but 78 of the Japanese forces in front of them, but had been engaged from the rear by the main Japanese force once again. With his soldiers running low on ammunition, exhausted and carrying 132 men with serious wounds, and without communications to Sparrow Force HQ Leggatt eventually acceded to a Japanese invitation to surrender. The 2/40th had suffered 84 killed in action. More than twice that number would die as prisoners of war during the next two-and-a-half years.

Veale and the Sparrow Force HQ force—including some members of the 2/40th and about 200 Dutch East Indies troops—continued eastward across the border, and eventually joined the 2/2 Independent Company. The 2/40th effectively ceased to exist, its survivors being absorbed into the 2/2nd and subsequently took part in the guerrilla campaign that was waged on Timor in the following months, before being evacuated in December 1942.

===Postscript 1942–1945===
After a journey lasting several weeks, traversing the Strait of Malacca, Sumatra and then Java, following his escape from Malaya, Bennett arrived in Melbourne on 2 March 1942. The Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, publicly exonerated him. However, the Australian high command effectively sidelined Bennett by appointing him commander of III Corps, a formation responsible for the defence of Western Australia. With this, he was promoted to lieutenant general, but he never commanded troops in battle again. His actions in escaping would later also be subject to a royal commission.

Following the loss of its original infantry battalions, the headquarters unit of the 23rd Brigade, which had not deployed with the infantry battalions, was used to re-form a new brigade. Three Militia battalions were assigned, the 7th, 8th and 27th Battalions. Reassigned to the 12th Division, after garrison duty in Darwin and training in northern Queensland, the 23rd Brigade saw action in 1944–1945 against the Japanese on Bougainville. Ostensibly the 8th Division ceased to exist in 1942; however, one of its artillery regiments, the 2/14th, which had remained in Darwin when the 23rd Brigade deployed, continued to serve until 1946, albeit attached to the 9th and 5th Divisions during their campaigns in New Guinea.

During the fighting in Malaya, Singapore, Ambon, Timor and Rabaul the 8th Division lost over 10,000 men, including 2,500 killed in action, with this figure representing two-thirds of all deaths sustained by the Australian Army in the Pacific. One of the division&#x27;s infantry battalions, the 2/19th, lost more men killed in action than any other 2nd AIF unit. Additionally, of those captured, one in three died in captivity.

<text>George Claude Leon Underwood (25 December 1890 – 9 October 1975) was a British artist, although primarily known as a sculptor, printmaker and painter, he was also an influential teacher and promotor of African art. His travels in Mexico and West Africa had a substantial influence on his art, particularly on the representation of the human figure in his sculptures and paintings. Underwood is best known for his sculptures cast in bronze, carvings in marble, stone and wood and his drawings. His lifetime&#x27;s work includes a wide range of media and activities, with an expressive and technical mastery. Underwood did not hold modernism and abstraction in art in high regard and this led to critics often ignoring his work until the 1960s when he came to be viewed as an important figure in the development of modern sculpture in Britain.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Underwood was born in the west London suburb of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. He was the eldest of the three sons of George Underwood, a fine art dealer and he attended Hampden Gurney School. From 1907 to 1910 he attended the Regent Street Polytechnic in central London before studying at the Royal College of Art for three years. While still a student in 1911, Underwood was commissioned to paint a mural for the Peace Palace in The Hague. In 1913 he visited Russia to study the depiction of horses in traditional Russian art.

===World War I===

In the First World War, Underwood enlisted in the Royal Horse Artillery before transferring to a field battery unit and then serving as a Captain in the Camouflage Section of the Royal Engineers. He worked with Solomon Joseph Solomon as a camoufleur, creating battlefield observation posts disguised as trees. Underwood&#x27;s duties on the Western Front included going into No man&#x27;s land to make detailed drawings of trees which were later replaced with metal replicas used by military observers. He sketched and painted scenes of this work, notably in his 1919 oil painting &quot;Erecting a Camouflage Tree&quot;, which was intended for the, never built, British national Hall of Remembrance and was in turn purchased by the Imperial War Museum.

===1920s and 1930s===
After the war Underwood attended the Slade School of Art for a year&#x27;s refresher course and in 1920 received the British Prix de Rome but chose not to go to Italy, instead using the grant to travel elsewhere later in the decade. He painted both formal portraits, such as that of the Canadian war hero G.B. McLean, and Impressionist works such as the 1921 painting &quot;Venus in Kensington Gardens&quot;. In his Hammersmith studio Underwood set up a private art school, the Brook Green School, which he ran, intermittently, until 1938. At Brook Green, Underwood initially, concentrated on teaching printmaking with woodcutting but also began making sculptures. In 1925, with some of his past pupils, Underwood created the English Wood-Engraving Society to promote the art form. Later in his career, between 1935 and 1945 Underwood created a significant number of colour linocuts.

In 1922 Underwood had his first solo exhibition at the Chenil Gallery in London. An exhibition of his sculptures was held in 1924. He also taught a life drawing class at the Royal College of Art from 1920 until 1923 when he resigned and travelled to Paris and Iceland. In 1925 he became the first contemporary artist to spend time examining the cave paintings at Altamira in Spain. Underwood spent 1926 in the United States where he published an illustrated book of verse, &quot;Animalia&quot;, illustrated some volumes by others and also painted and made engravings. In Greenwich Village he opened a life-drawing school. In 1927 he went to Mexico, spending five months travelling and studying Aztec and Mayan art forms.

After returning to England in late 1928 Underwood made a number of paintings on Mexican themes, including imagined portraits of Montezuma II and Hernán Cortés, the latter holding a stone heart in front of a ruined castle. He also created several surrealist paintings, six of which were shown at the first, and only, exhibition of The Neo Society held at the Godfrey Phillips Gallery in London in May 1930. With funding from Eileen Agar, Underwood co-founded a graphical quarterly magazine, &quot;The Island&quot;, in 1931 which, despite contributions from Henry Moore, Agar, CRW Nevinson and Mahatma Gandhi was only published for four issues. From 1932 to 1934, Underwood made a series of sculptures of dancing figures including &quot;Herald of New Day&quot;, the plaster cast of which is now in the Tate collection. In 1934 he published an artistic manifesto, &quot;Art for Heaven&#x27;s Sake: Notes on a Philosophy of Art&quot;. Underwood was always convinced that subject matter formed a fundamental role behind the power of both his own and primitive art, and had no belief in subject-less or purely abstract form in his own work. Underwood&#x27;s 1935 lignum vitae carving &quot;African Madonna&quot;, or &quot;Black Virgin&quot;, was inspired by a Bantu carving and is sited in St George&#x27;s Cathedral, Cape Town.

Underwood&#x27;s 1937 bronze sculpture of King George VI, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, had originally been intended to be of Edward VIII but was reworked after the abdication of December 1936. When first shown in public, the Buckingham Palace authorities asked that it be removed from view. In 1938, Underwood closed the Brook Green School. During the School&#x27;s existence, its students had included Henry Moore, Eileen Agar, Gertrude Hermes, Blair Hughes-Stanton, Raymond Coxon, Edna Ginesi and Roland Vivian Pitchforth. Moore later spoke of his indebtedness to Underwood&#x27;s teaching.

===World War II===
From 1939 to 1942, during World War II, Underwood worked at the civil defence camouflage centre at Leamington Spa. In 1944, having long collected and studied non-Western art, he undertook a lecture tour, sponsored by the British Council, of west Africa and on his return to Britain wrote three books on aspects of African art. These included a study of the Ife and Benin heads, &quot;Bronzes of West Africa&quot; which showed a pioneering appreciation of their artistic significance and his understanding of their relationship to the culture and technology from which they originated. Underwood had begun collecting African art in 1919 and, after his 1944 tour, had acquired over 550 pieces including several significant works by Yoruba artists, including sculptures by Olowe of Ise. Some of these works Underwood later sold to the British Museum while others were eventually acquired by National Museum of African Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the United States. His access to the cave paintings of Altamira in Spain ignited his &quot;New Philosophy&quot; with regard to this interrelationship of the expressiveness and technology of primitive art.

===Later life===
From 1948 onwards, Underwood cast his bronze sculptures in his own studio and throughout the 1950s, concentrated on his sculpture and on promoting his theories and philosophy of art. In 1961 Underwood was elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Society of Sculptors and further recognition followed in 1969 when the first full-scale retrospective of his work was held at The Minories in Colchester. The art historian John Rothenstein wrote in the introduction to that exhibition that Underwood was &quot;..the most versatile artist at work in Britain today..&quot;. However it was to be over forty years before the next major retrospective of his work was held, in 2015 at the Pallant House Gallery. This lack of attention has been attributed to the range and versatility of Underwood&#x27;s output which, across the various media he worked in, lacked a common recognisable style that was easy to promote and also to his, sometimes, complex and esoteric philosophies and theories on art.

Underwood was married to Mary Coleman. They first met in 1911 at the Royal College of Art, married in 1917 and their first child was born in 1919. They had two sons, Garth (a zoologist) and John, and one daughter, Jean.

<doc id="752310" wikidata="Q2092780" url="?curid=752310" title="RCA Dome">
<text>The RCA Dome (originally Hoosier Dome) was a domed stadium in Indianapolis. It was the home of the Indianapolis Colts NFL franchise for 24 seasons (1984–2007).

It was completed at a cost of $77.5 million, as part of the Indiana Convention Center, with the costs split between private and public money. The largest crowd to attend an event at the Dome was 62,167 for WrestleMania VIII in 1992. It was demolished on December 20, 2008, as part of a project to expand the attached convention center.

==Description==
The Birdair-designed dome was made up of teflon-coated fiberglass and weighed , which was held up by the air pressure inside the building. The ceiling was high, though the height varied up to as the materials expanded and contracted with the weather.

Like other domes of this style (the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, BC Place, the JMA Wireless Dome, and the Pontiac Silverdome) there were warning signs posted cautioning patrons of the high winds at the doors when exiting the facility.

==History==

Construction for the Hoosier Dome began in May 1982.

The domed stadium was similar in design and appearance to the Metrodome and the previous BC Place roof, owing in great part to the involvement of engineers David Geiger and Walter Bird, pioneers in air-supported roofs.

The stadium was originally named the Hoosier Dome until 1994 when RCA paid $10 million for the naming rights for 10 years, with two 5-year options to RCA at a cost of $3.5 million if invoked. The stadium seated 56,127 for football, the smallest in the NFL. Modifications were made to the stadium in 1999 to expand the suites and add club seating. Before that, the maximum seating for a football crowd was 60,272. The stadium was built to lure a National Football League team to Indianapolis, and as the stadium was being completed, the Baltimore Colts relocated to Indianapolis on March 29, 1984.

The Dome was officially dedicated on August 11, 1984, as a sellout crowd watched the Indianapolis Colts defeat the New York Giants in an NFL preseason game. The Buffalo Bills and Chicago Bears played a preseason game at the Hoosier Dome on August 26, 1984, which had been scheduled prior to the Colts moving in.

The football playing surface was originally AstroTurf, and replaced with FieldTurf in 2005.

The Colts moved into the new, retractable-roof, Lucas Oil Stadium for the 2008 NFL season. The RCA Dome was replaced by additional space for the adjacent Indiana Convention Center. The new convention space connects to Lucas Oil Stadium in much the same way that the existing Indiana Convention Center had been connected to the RCA Dome (although the new connecting walkway now passes under a railroad track).

===Demolition===
On September 24, 2008, the roof of the Dome was deflated, which took about 35 minutes. The building itself was imploded on December 20, 2008, by Controlled Demolition, Inc., and was featured on the second series premiere of the National Geographic show &quot;Blowdown&quot;.

An Indianapolis nonprofit, People for Urban Progress, rescued of the Dome roof. They work with local Indianapolis designers to recycle the material into community shade structures and art installations, as well as wallets, purses and bags.

==Events==

===Football===
Although the RCA Dome never hosted any Super Bowls, it played host to the 2006 AFC Championship Game, which saw the Colts erase a 21–3 deficit for a come-from-behind 38–34 win over the New England Patriots in what would ultimately be the only AFC Championship Game hosted at the RCA Dome.

The RCA Dome also hosted three AFC Divisional Round games in 1999, 2005, and 2007, with the Colts posting an 0–3 record in those games; the 2005 game, which saw the heavily favored Colts lose to the Pittsburgh Steelers 21–18 in one of the biggest upsets in NFL history (en route to the Steelers&#x27; victory in Super Bowl XL), is best remembered for Colts cornerback Nick Harper recovering a Jerome Bettis fumble only for Mike Vanderjagt to miss the game-tying field goal at the end of the game. The RCA Dome also hosted three AFC wild card games in 2003, 2004, and 2006, with the Colts winning all three games. The Colts&#x27; 28–24 loss to the San Diego Chargers in the 2007 Divisional Round proved to be the stadium&#x27;s final game before the Colts moved on to Lucas Oil Stadium the following season.

===Basketball===
In addition to football, the RCA Dome hosted several basketball games. The first was an exhibition game in 1984 between an NBA All-Star team led by home-state hero Larry Bird and the United States Olympic Men&#x27;s Basketball team, coached by Bob Knight, who was at the time the coach of Indiana University. The Dome hosted the 1985 NBA All-Star Game in February, where an NBA-record crowd of 43,146 saw the Western Conference beat the host Eastern Conference 140–129. The Indiana High School Athletic Association&#x27;s 1990 boys and girls basketball finals were held at the stadium; 41,046 attended the boys semifinals and finals, setting the record for the largest crowd at a high school basketball game. Later, it hosted many NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Championship games, including four Final Fours (1991, 1997, 2000, 2006). The NCAA, whose headquarters are in Indianapolis, has committed to holding the Final Four in the city once every five years. The RCA Dome hosted its only Women&#x27;s Final Four in 2005. It served as one of two sites for the FIBA Men&#x27;s Basketball World Championship in 2002, sharing the honors with Gainbridge Fieldhouse, the home of the Indiana Pacers.

===Other sports===
During the 1987 Pan American Games, the RCA Dome hosted the Gymnastics and Handball competitions as well as the closing ceremonies.

In 1991, the Dome hosted the 1991 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. In 1992, the Dome hosted WrestleMania VIII for the World Wrestling Federation.

Monster Jam hosted events at the venue every year, with the last event being held in 2008 a few months before the venue was demolished.

In addition, it hosted the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships from 1989 to 1999, and the 1990 General Conference Session of Seventh-day Adventists. Additionally, the RCA Dome served as the site of the Indiana State School Music Association State Marching Band Competition, the Bands of America Grand Nationals, and the Drum Corps International Midwestern Regional, along with the NFL Scouting Combine in February of each year. The 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Wrestling Trials were held in the Dome. It also hosted a PBR Built Ford Tough Series bull riding event in 2004.
The Thunder in the Dome was a midget car race held from 1985 to 2001. The Dome also hosted an AMA Supercross Championship round from 1992 to 2008.

===Concerts===
Many concerts took place in this venue, such as the 1987 Pink Floyd reunion, the Rolling Stones, the Monsters of Rock Festival in 1988 (Van Halen, Metallica, Scorpions, Dokken, and Kingdom Come), and Farm Aid IV in 1990 (Elton John, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Lou Reed, John Mellencamp, Genesis, CSN&amp;Y, Willie Nelson, Iggy Pop, Don Henley &amp; Bonnie Raitt).

<text>Shatrughan Prasad Sinha (born 15 July 1946) is an Indian actor and politician. He is a Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha from Asansol constituency as a member of All India Trinamool Congress (TMC). Earlier he was elected as Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha (2009–2014, 2014–2019) from Patna Sahib. He was also a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha during 1996–2002 and 2002–2008. He was a Union Cabinet Minister of Health and Family Welfare and Shipping in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. He was a member of standing committee on transport, tourism and culture and member of consultative committee in ministry of external affairs and overseas Indian affairs from 2014 to 2019.
In 2016, his biography, &quot;Anything but Khamosh&quot;, was released.

==Early life==
Sinha was born in Patna, Bihar, to Bhuvaneshwar Prasad Sinha and Shyama Devi Sinha on 15 July 1946. He is the youngest of four brothers – Ram, Lakshman, Bharat and himself. He graduated from Patna Science College with a Bachelor of Science. He had a Diploma in Acting from the Film and Television Institute of India Pune. Currently there&#x27;s a scholarship being awarded in his name in the institute to Diploma students. He moved to Mumbai, where he started his career in the film industry. He is married to former Miss India Poonam Sinha (&quot;née&quot; Chandiramani).

==Acting career==
Sinha got his first acting opportunity to play a Pakistani military officer in Dev Anand&#x27;s &quot;Prem Pujari&quot;. Before that, he got a small role as a police inspector in Mohan Sehgal&#x27;s &quot;Sajan&quot; in 1969. The release of &quot;Prem Pujari&quot; was delayed, so his first released film was &quot;Sajan&quot;. He later appeared in villainous roles in &quot;Pyar Hi Pyar&quot;, &quot;Banphool&quot;, Manmohan Desai&#x27;s &quot;Raampur Ka Lakshman&quot;, &quot;Bhai Ho Toh Aisa&quot;, Sultan Ahmed&#x27;s &quot;Heera&quot;, and in Vijay Anand&#x27;s &quot;Blackmail&quot;.

He played supporting roles in many films before appearing in Gulzar&#x27;s &quot;Mere Apne&quot; in 1971. He was cast along with his future wife Poonam Sinha, then called as Komal, in the movie &quot;Sabak&quot; (1973). He played supporting roles in &quot;Khilona&quot;, Dulal Guha&#x27;s &quot;Dost&quot; in 1974, &quot;Aa Gale Lag Jaa&quot;, &quot;Jheel Ke Us Paar&quot; and &quot;Gambler&quot; in 1970. He acted with Amitabh Bachchan in films like &quot;Raaste Ka Paththar&quot;, &quot;Yaar Meri Zindagi&quot;, &quot;Shaan&quot; and &quot;Kala Paththar&quot;, of which &quot;Shaan&quot; was the biggest success. He later acted in &quot;Bombay to Goa&quot;, &quot;Dostana&quot; and &quot;Naseeb&quot;. His films as the lead hero between 1970 and 1975 were not hits. His first successful film as lead hero was in &quot;Kalicharan&quot; in 1976. Subhash Ghai went with the story of &quot;Kalicharan&quot; to N. N. Sippy and said he wanted to direct his first film. N. N. Sippy got ready to produce after few days, but wanted to cast only Rajesh Khanna in the lead role of &quot;Kalicharan&quot;. Then only when N. N. Sippy confirmed with Rajesh Khanna that Khanna did not have dates for the years 1976 and 1977, Sippy asked Subhash Ghai to go ahead with the script and direct &quot;Kalicharan&quot; with Sinha in the lead.

Sinha played the lead hero were &quot;Ab Kya Hoga&quot;, &quot;Khan Dost&quot;, &quot;Yaaraon Ka Yaar&quot;, &quot;Dillagi&quot;, &quot;Vishwanath&quot;, &quot;Muqabla&quot; and &quot;Jaani Dushman&quot;. He then became a bankable action hero from early eighties to mid-nineties. He co-starred with Sanjeev Kumar in &quot;Bereham&quot;, &quot;Hathkadi&quot;, &quot;Baad Aur Badnaam&quot;, &quot;Chehre Pe Chehra&quot;, &quot;Hirasat&quot; and &quot;Qatl&quot;. He starred in Hrishikesh Mukherjee&#x27;s &quot;Naram Garam&quot;, Brij&#x27;s &quot;Bombay 405 Miles&quot; and &quot;Taqdeer&quot;. He has sung the song &quot;Ek Baat Suni Hai Chachaji&quot; with singer Sushma Shrestha in the film &quot;Naram Garam&quot; in 1981, composed by R. D. Burman. However, when his films as lead hero like Prakash Mehra&#x27;s &quot;Jawalamukhi&quot;, Amjad Khan&#x27;s &quot;Chor Police&quot;, &quot;Ameer Aadmi Garib Aadmi&quot; and Raj Khosla&#x27;s &quot;Mera Dost Meraa Dushman&quot; became flops, despite being appreciated by critics, there was threat to his career as lead hero. He also produced and acted in the film &quot;Kalka&quot;, based on life of coal mine workers, released in 1983.

He then bounced back by bagging roles in films with lead hero as Rajesh Khanna in films like &quot;Dil E Nadan&quot;, &quot;Aaj Ka M.L.A Ram Avtaar&quot;, &quot;Maqsad&quot; and &quot;Paapi Pet Ka Sawal Hai&quot;. His other hit films in the mid-eighties included &quot;Jeene Nahi Doonga&quot;, &quot;Bhawani Junction&quot;, &quot;Aandhi-Toofan&quot;, &quot;Ramkali&quot;, &quot;Ilzaam&quot; and &quot;Asli Naqli&quot;. He then went on to star with Jeetendra in &quot;Hoshiyar&quot;, &quot;Khudgarz&quot;, &quot;Ranbhoomi&quot; and &quot;Mulzim&quot;. He co-starred with Dharmendra in &quot;Insaniyat Ke Dushman&quot;, &quot;Loha&quot; (1987), &quot;Aag Hi Aag&quot; (1987), &quot;Hawalaat&quot; and &quot;Zalzala&quot;. He was in films like &quot;Telephone&quot; (1985), &quot;Sherni&quot; (1988), &quot;Khoon Bhari Maang&quot; (1988) and &quot;Adharm&quot; (1992). He starred with Raajkumar in &quot;Betaaj Badshah&quot; in 1994 and Salman Khan in &quot;Chaand Kaa Tukdaa&quot; in 1994. Sinha credited Rajesh Khanna for getting &quot;Kaalicharan&quot; and for the revival of his career as lead hero in the 1980s, however their friendship got affected when Shatrughan Sinha stood as the BJP candidate against Rajesh Khanna in the 1992 election. Though as a Congress candidate Khanna had defeated Sinha by 25000 margin of votes, Khanna was disappointed at Sinha for standing against him in the elections.

Sinha was selected by Rediff as one of the most unconventional actors in Hindi cinema (the others being Ajay Devgan, Amitabh Bachchan, Irrfan Khan, Rajesh Khanna, Rajinikanth, Shahrukh Khan and Sunil Shetty). In 2008, he became a judge on &quot;The Great Indian Laughter Challenge&quot; show, season 4 on STAR One TV. On 3 October 2009, Sinha appeared on Sony Entertainment Television Asia&#x27;s show &quot;Dus Ka Dum&quot; season 2 as host for a special episode. He is currently hosting the Bhojpuri version of the popular game show &quot;Kaun Banega Crorepati&quot; on Mahuaa channel.

He portrayed Chief Minister Konda Shivaji Rao, a character based on NTR in Ram Gopal Varma&#x27;s &quot;Rakta Charitra&quot;.

==Political career==
Sinha entered politics by contesting in a by-election opposite Rajesh Khanna. He quoted in an interview that his biggest regret in his life was contesting election against his friend Khanna. Khanna won the elections by beating Sinha by 25,000 votes; however, he was hurt and never spoke to Sinha thereafter. Sinha did try to rebuild his friendship with Khanna; however, that never happened until Khanna&#x27;s death in 2012.

He won the Patna Sahib Lok Sabha constituency in Bihar during the 2009 Indian general elections. He defeated another cinema celebrity, Shekhar Suman. Out of a total of 552,293 votes polled, Sinha received 316,549 votes. He won the seat in the subsequent 2014 Indian general elections, as well. In 2014, he received 485,905 from the 813,411 total votes polled.

Sinha became a cabinet minister in the Third Vajpayee ministry from the 13th Lok Sabha, holding two portfolios, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (January 2003 – May 2004), and the Department of Shipping (August 2004). As of May 2006, he was appointed as the head of the BJP Culture and Arts Department.

On 6 April 2019, Sinha became a member of the Indian National Congress in presence of Congress general secretary K. C. Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala. Sinha became a member of the Indian National Congress Party, having joined them after he was not given a seat for the 2019 Indian general elections by the Bharatiya Janata Party.

In March 2022, Sinha joined All India Trinamool Congress to contest in the By-election for the Asansol Lok Sabha constituency. On 16 April 2022, Sinha won by defeating Bharatiya Janata Party&#x27;s Agnimitra Paul by a margin of 303,209 votes.

<doc id="752313" wikidata="Q285905" url="?curid=752313" title="Flick of the Switch">
<text>Flick of the Switch is the ninth studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC. The album was deemed a commercial disappointment after it failed to match the sales figures of the band&#x27;s two previous releases, 1980&#x27;s &quot;Back in Black&quot; and 1981&#x27;s &quot;For Those About to Rock&quot;, and its release represented the beginning of the band&#x27;s commercial decline. The third AC/DC album to feature lead vocalist Brian Johnson, the album is also the last to feature drummer Phil Rudd before his return on &quot;Ballbreaker&quot; (1995). The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the &quot;AC/DC Remasters&quot; series.

==Recording==
AC/DC returned to Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas to record their ninth album, the same studio where they had recorded &quot;Back in Black&quot; with Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange in 1980. Lange had produced AC/DC&#x27;s three previous releases but this time the band chose to produce themselves. On the recorded commentary on the album for the &quot;Live at Donington&quot; DVD, the band members state that the album was an attempt to make the band raw again, and were happy with the result. In the book &quot;AC/DC: Maximum Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, AC/DC engineer Tony Platt recalls:

The album is notable for its &quot;dry&quot; sound, with very little of the polish that is evident on their previous effort &quot;For Those About to Rock We Salute You&quot;. In a 1984 interview, Angus Young said of the LP, &quot;We wanted this one as raw as possible. We wanted a natural, but big, sound for the guitars. We didn&#x27;t want echoes and reverb going everywhere and noise eliminators and noise extractors.&quot;

However, the album&#x27;s birth was a troubled one; after having problems with Malcolm as well as drugs and alcohol, drummer Phil Rudd was fired midway through the album&#x27;s recording sessions, although he had completed his drum parts. According to Murray Engleheart&#x27;s band memoir &quot;AC/DC: Maximum Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, Rudd had been struggling for some time; tour manager Ian Jeffrey recalls getting a phone call from a strung-out Rudd at four in the morning when the band was playing in Nebraska on the Back in Black tour and finding the drummer in his hotel room in a state of disorientated agitation. Eventually Rudd broke down crying and begged Jeffery &quot;Don&#x27;t tell Malcolm.&quot; Jeffery also reveals that Malcolm punched the drummer after he showed up two hours late for the band&#x27;s show at Long Island&#x27;s Nassau Coliseum and was unable to play the last song of the encore. &quot;It was an absolutely stupid thing that finished it, but it had been brewing for a long, long time,&quot; Jeffery remembers. &quot;He got into drugs and got burned out,&quot; Malcolm later explained to KNAC.com in August 2000. Former Procol Harum drummer B.J. Wilson was hired to help complete the recording if needed, but his contributions were not used. Platt later recalled to band biographer Jesse Fink, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a happiest of albums. There were all sorts of tensions within the band. They were all pretty knackered by that point. It was the album that copped the backlash, really.&quot; The drum position was eventually filled by future Dio drummer Simon Wright after more than 700 auditions were held in the U.S. and UK. Simon Kirke of Free and Bad Company fame, and Paul Thompson of Roxy Music were two of the drummers auditioned. Wright appeared in the videos for &quot;Flick of the Switch&quot;, &quot;Nervous Shakedown&quot;, and &quot;Guns For Hire&quot;. A second video for &quot;Nervous Shakedown&quot; was also shot at a pre-show rehearsal at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit. He also toured for the album, and is seen in the pro-shot video recordings from that period.

The songs on &quot;Flick of the Switch&quot; contain much of the outlaw bravado (&quot;Guns For Hire,&quot; &quot;Badlands&quot;) and sexual innuendo (&quot;Rising Power,&quot; &quot;Deep in the Hole&quot;) that fans had come to expect from the Australian rockers. The song &quot;Bedlam in Belgium&quot; was inspired by the band&#x27;s appearance at Kontich when a riot nearly broke out when police tried to close down the show after the band allegedly ignored a strict 11 p.m. curfew. On tour in support of the album, &quot;Guns For Hire&quot; was the set opener. The tour resulted in more upheaval in the band&#x27;s inner circle when Malcolm, frustrated by mixed reviews for &quot;Flick of the Switch&quot; and dwindling audience numbers in certain cities, fired tour manager Ian Jeffrey. In his Bon Scott memoir &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, author Clinton Walker observes:

==Album cover==
The &quot;Flick of the Switch&quot; cover is a simple, pencil-drawn picture of Angus Young hanging from a giant power switch, illustrated by artist Brent Richardson, that Young had sketched out to reflect the simple, raw approach of the album. Atlantic Records hated it. Angus had wanted the album graphics to be embossed the same way that &quot;Back in Black&quot; had been but, according to Ian Jeffrey, Atlantic did not want to spend the money because they believed the album contained no hit singles.

==Reception==

Recorded shortly after their 1982 European tour at the beginning of 1983, the album was originally released with little promotion in the US on 19 August 1983. The album reached No. 4 in UK and No. 15 in the US, and has been certified platinum by the RIAA. In his original &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, David Fricke noted, &quot;Produced by the band, &quot;Flick of the Switch&quot; isn&#x27;t quite the monster blowout that 1980&#x27;s &quot;Back in Black&quot; was, and the Youngs&#x27; retooling of old riffs for new hits also teeters on self-plagiarism at times.&quot; Canadian journalist Martin Popoff considered the album &quot;the blinding furious peak of the Brian Johnson era&quot;, where AC/DC recaptured &quot;the raw edge lost during the Mutt Lange years... even if the songs were starting to relive past glories&quot;. Steve Huey of AllMusic was of the same opinion, writing that &quot;as perhaps indicated by the record&#x27;s idiotic original title, the utterly generic &quot;I Like to Rock&quot;, AC/DC seemed to be running out of ideas at an alarming rate, and their record sales began to reflect that fact.&quot; Malcolm Young later said of the LP, &quot;It was thrown together real quick. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a great album...&quot;

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said of the title track that it &quot;blasts off in suitable fashion with a basic hard rock guitar riff from Angus Young followed by Brian Johnson’s just-as-basic hard rock squeals&quot; and the rest of the song follows in kind, consistent with the song&#x27;s lyrics that &quot;with a flick of the switch she’ll blow you sky high.&quot;

<text>The 2003 NBA draft was held on June 26, 2003, at The Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. The NBA announced that 41 college and high school players and a record 31 international players had filed as early-entry candidates for the 2003 NBA draft. The Cleveland Cavaliers, who had a 22.50 percent probability of obtaining the first selection, won the NBA draft lottery on May 22, and Cleveland chairman Gordon Gund said afterward his team would select LeBron James, and they did. The Detroit Pistons and the Denver Nuggets were second and third, respectively. This draft was the first draft to be aired on ESPN after they picked up the license from TNT.

The 2003 draftees represented one of the deepest talent pools in NBA history. The draft contained 15 players who combined for 26 championships. Four of the top five picks are NBA All-Stars and &quot;Redeem Team&quot; Olympic Gold Medalists: Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, and LeBron James.

==Overview==
Four of the top five picks of the 2003 draft became NBA All-Stars and &quot;Redeem Team&quot; Olympic Gold Medalists: Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, and LeBron James. Nine players have participated in an All-Star Game. Dwyane Wade was named NBA Finals MVP in 2006 and won NBA championships with the Miami Heat in 2006, 2012 and 2013, as well as the NBA All Star Game MVP in 2010. Boris Diaw won the Most Improved Player Award in 2006, Jason Kapono won the three point shootout in back-to-back years in 2007 and 2008, James Jones won the three point shootout in 2011, Leandro Barbosa won the Sixth Man Award in 2007, Kyle Korver set the NBA record for three point shooting percentage in 2010 (53.6%), and in the 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013 seasons, LeBron James won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, and the NBA Finals MVP in 2012, 2013, 2016, and 2020. Carmelo Anthony won the 2013 NBA scoring title and was the only player in NBA history to win at least three Olympic gold medals until Kevin Durant won his third one in 2021. Zaza Pachulia and David West won NBA championships with the Golden State Warriors in 2017 and 2018. Matt Bonner won NBA championships with the San Antonio Spurs in 2007 and 2014. Dahntay Jones and Mo Williams won the NBA championship in 2016 with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Luke Walton won three NBA championships, two as a player with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2009 and 2010 and one as an assistant coach with the Warriors in 2015. Chris Bosh left the Toronto Raptors in 2010 as its all-time leader in points, rebounds, blocks, double doubles, free throws made and attempted, and minutes played; he went on to win championships with the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013.

The 2003 draft class has drawn comparisons to the 1984 and 1996 NBA draft classes but is also known for the Detroit Pistons&#x27; selection of Darko Miličić with the second overall pick over other prospects who went on to have much more success in the league. 
As of 2025, LeBron James is the only remaining active player from the 2003 draft class.

Eleven of the players selected in this draft never played in an NBA game throughout their professional basketball careers. Two of those players were the sole selection of the draft by their respective teams: Malick Badiane (Houston&#x27;s only pick) and Paccelis Morlende (Philadelphia&#x27;s only pick).

==Draft selections==






==Notable undrafted players==

These players were not selected in the 2003 NBA draft, but have played at least one game in the NBA.
==Draft lottery==


==Early entrants==
===College underclassmen===
In terms of underclassmen declaring for this year&#x27;s draft, the number of players available for entry this year would increase up to 73 after previously being down a bit the previous year. However, it would also see the most withdrawn entries from underclassmen either in college, overseas, or even high school in the case of Charlie Villanueva with 27 total people doing exactly that. As such, there would actually be 46 underclassmen that qualified as such for this year&#x27;s draft, which would be an overall step down when compared to last year&#x27;s official number of underclassmen entering the NBA draft. The following college basketball players successfully applied for early draft entrance.
* Chris Alexander – C, Iowa State (junior)
* Carmelo Anthony – F, Syracuse (freshman)
* Mario Austin – F, Mississippi State (junior)
* Ronald Blackshear – G, Marshall (junior)
* Chris Bosh – F, Georgia Tech (freshman)
* Lamar Castile – G, CC of Beaver County (sophomore)
* Rod Edwards – G, Ouachita Baptist (junior)
* Carl English – G, Hawaii (junior)
* T. J. Ford – G, Texas (sophomore)
* Zack Fray – F, Santa Ana (sophomore)
* Jonathan Hargett – G, West Virginia (freshman)
* David Hamilton – F, Salem International (junior)
* Jarvis Hayes – F/G, Georgia (junior)
* Maurice Jackson – F, Texas–Permian (junior)

* Michael Sweetney – F, Georgetown (junior)
* Dwyane Wade – G, Marquette (junior)
* Mo Williams – G, Alabama (sophomore)
* Doug Wrenn – F/G, Washington (junior)
===High school players===
This would be the ninth straight year in a row where at least one high school player would declare their entry into the NBA draft directly out of high school after previously only allowing it one time back in 1975. However, it would be one of the most famous ones due to the entry of high school phenom LeBron James entering the NBA draft this year, being the second high schooler to be drafted at #1 behind only Kwame Brown back in 2001, as well as being the second high schooler to win the NBA Rookie of the Year Award behind Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire only a year prior. This draft also saw a high schooler named Charlie Villanueva initially enter for the NBA draft, but withdraw his name and go to college before the draft began. The following high school players successfully applied for early draft entrance.
* Ndudi Ebi – F, Westbury Christian School (Houston, Texas)
* LeBron James – G, St. Vincent–St. Mary High School (Akron, Ohio)
* James Lang – F, Central Park Christian High School (Birmingham, Alabama)
* Travis Outlaw – F, Starkville High School (Starkville, Mississippi)
* Kendrick Perkins – F, Clifton J. Ozen High School (Beaumont, Texas)
===International players===
The following international players successfully applied for early draft entrance.
* Malick Badiane – F, Langen (Germany)
* Leandro Barbosa – G, Bauru Tilibra (Brazil)
* Carlos Delfino – G, Skipper Bologna (Italy)
* Boris Diaw – F, Pau-Orthez (France)
* Maciej Lampe – F, Universidad Complutense (Spain)

* Zaza Pachulia – F/C, Ülker (Turkey)
* Aleksandar Pavlović – G/F, Budućnost (Serbia and Montenegro)
* Mickaël Piétrus – G, Pau-Orthez (France)
* Zoran Planinić – G, Cibona (Croatia)

<text>Pervijze (, English &quot;Pervyse&quot;) is a small rural village in the Belgian province of West Flanders, and a part (&quot;Deelgemeente&quot;) of the municipality of Diksmuide. Pervijze has an area of 12.23 km2 and almost 900 inhabitants.

Before the municipal mergers in 1971, Pervijze was an independent municipality. In 1971, Lampernisse, Oostkerke and Stuivekenskerke were added to the municipality. In 1977 Pervijze became a part of Diksmuide.

During World War I, Pervijze was situated near the Yser Front and was destroyed. Two British nurses, Elsie Knocker and Mairi Chisholm, became known as &quot;The Madonnas of Pervyse&quot; in the British press. In Brussels (more precisely in Etterbeek), there is a street called &quot;Rue de Pervyse&quot; and &quot;Pervijzestraat&quot;.

<text>Stuivekenskerke is a district of the town of Diksmuide, in the Belgian province of West Flanders. Located on the Yser river, until 1970 it was an independent municipality and then merged and became a sub-municipality of Diksmuide. Stuivekenskerke, built in a polder, has an area of 7.34 km2 and had 160 inhabitants in 2007.

== History ==
===Early and medieval history===
In Roman times, the area consisted of mudflats and salt marshes, and already had a human presence. Floods coming in from the North Sea in the 4th century, and gradual flooding of the coastal area, rendered the area unfit for habitation. In 1161, the Norbertines of Vicoigne in Raismes became the owners of a sheepfold on a slightly elevated area surrounded by mudflats and marshes. This settlement would become a monastic domain, ; the area was encircled with dikes and became a fairly important center for sheep farming. Between 10 and 20 monks lived at the monastery, on a site 133 ha in size.

The first mention of the place name is from 1219; it says &quot;parochia de Stuvinskerke in loco qui Vatha dicitur&quot; (&quot;the parish of Stuvinskerke in the place called Vate&quot;). The &quot;-kerke&quot; ending indicates that the name can only have come into existence after the Christianization of the area, after the 11th century. The name supposedly comes from the Germanic &quot;Stuvinas karika&quot;, or &quot;Stuvin&#x27;s church&quot;. Similar to other polder parishes, the name then comes from a local landowner, who founded a church and named it for himself.

On 18 March 994, the parish of Vladslo had been bequeathed by Radbod, bishop of Noyon and Tournai, to Saint Peter&#x27;s Abbey, Ghent, and that abbey had patronage over Stuivekenskerke until 1802. This gift was confirmed in 1111, in a text that indicated that Stuivekenskerke was one of the daughter parishes (along with Keiem, Leke, Beerst, and Schore) that came from the mother parish Vladslo. Saint Peter was the patron saint. The Stuivekenskerke parish, though west of the Yser, was part of the Diocese of Tournai until 1559, when it was transferred to the Diocese of Bruges; neighboring villages on that side of the river belonged first to the Diocese of Thérouanne, and then to the Diocese of Ypres.

===Under French rule===
During the Ancien Régime, Stuivekenskerke belonged to the viscounty Veurne-Ambacht.

In the vicinity of Tervate and Stuivekenskerke, small fortifications were built by the Spaniards at the end of the 16th century, as a defense line against looting by reformists from Ostend. When the Siege of Ostend ended in 1604, these small fortresses soon disappeared.

The church had already received a new tower in 1572, and in 1643 it received a new northern aisle. At that time, the hamlet of Tervate also had a presence: on the Ferraris maps from around 1770–1778, this hamlet near a bridge over the Yser was of the same size as the center of Stuivekenskerke—which itself was accessible only from the north, via a single dead end country road. Several farms were nearby, some of which enclosed. The Viconia Monastery had a double wall and a mill. With the end of French rule, in 1794, the Norbertines were expelled and the property was sold. The local De Grave family first leased the terrain, and finally bought it.

===19th century, the village moves north===

At the end of the 19th century, the village moved, as a result of the construction of a new church. A restoration of the village&#x27;s St. Peter&#x27;s Church was to be too much work and so around 1866-1872 mayor J. B. de Graeve decided to have a new church built, two kilometers north of the village center, in the vicinity of his estate, the Viconia. In the following years, a new village center soon arose around this church, with a square, a school, a rectory, an inn and a grocery store. The old church was demolished, except for the tower, and the old village center decayed into a small hamlet, with a few small houses and a farm, called &quot;Oud-Stuivekenskerke&quot;.

===20th century===

The village was hit hard in World War I. The battle for the Yser, the edge of the last part of Belgium not occupied by the Germans, started on 18 October 1914, and Diksmuide and Nieuwpoort came under attack the next day. The day after, the German army reached the , and threatened to overrun allied positions and get straight to Dunkirk. By 25 October, the Germans had broken through the line, and the Belgian government decided to flood the entire area. When advanced German troops found water rising up behind their lines, they retreated behind the Yser. They took Diksmuide on 10 November, and when the first snow fell, they dug in, starting a lengthy trench war.

There were two important Belgian positions north of Diksmuide. Dodengang, a system of trenches where the Belgian and German armies were only meters away, was just north of Diksmuide, on the Yser. Next was Onze-Lieve-Vrouwehoekje (&quot;the little corner of Mary&quot;), at Out-Stuivekenskerke, a little over 1 kilometer from the Yser; because of the flooding, this had become an island. This important Belgian outpost (&quot;The Great Guard South&quot;) was manned from December 1914 to May 1915 by the artillery observer Edouard Lekeux (Aarlen, 1884 - Luik, 1962), a reserve lieutenant and a Franciscan minorite, who moved to the Goemaere family farm after German artillery had leveled the church tower. A plaque in his honor was put up in 1963 in Oud-Stuivekenskerke. The Germans retreated from the area on October 15, 1918.

The St. Peter&#x27;s Church, which had been destroyed in the war, was rebuilt in 1925, as was the Viconia estate. The Oud-Stuivekenserke landscape is dominated by the &quot;Our Lady of Victory&quot; chapel (1924-1925, by Veurne architect Camille Van Elslande), the ruined church tower from 1572, and the many military remembrances of World War I. The entire area was declared protected in 1993.

==Clay pits==
After World War 2, clay was extracted in Stuivekenskerke, between the Viconia estate and the Yser; these clay pits, the , now form a 35 ha nature reserve with seven ponds. The area is a haven for birds, and at least 195 different species are found here.

== Places of interest ==

*Viconia Kasteelhoeve, rebuilt in 1925
*Onze-Lieve-Vrouwehoekje in Oud-Stuivekenskerke, with the ruined tower of the former St. Peter&#x27;s church, and the memorial chapel Our Lady of Victory, with a demarcation pole with the inscription &quot;Here the conqueror was brought to a halt&quot;
*Viconia clay pits
*The boards of the Yser, in which mats woven from willow provide resting and mating areas for fish

==Modern administration==
Formerly an independent municipality, in 1970 Stuivekenskerke merged with Pervijze, Lampernisse, and Oostkerke, and became sub-communes in the municipality of Diksmuide.

<text>Vladslo German war cemetery is about three kilometres north east of Vladslo, near Diksmuide, Belgium. Established during World War I, the cemetery originally held 3,233 wartime burials. In 1956, burials from many smaller surrounding cemeteries were concentrated in Vladslo, and it now contains the remains of 25,644 soldiers. Each stone bears the name of twenty soldiers, with just their name, rank, and date of death specified.

The cemetery is administered by the German War Graves Commission (&quot;Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge&quot;). They also look after the three other German war cemeteries in Belgium: Langemark, Menen and Hooglede.

==The Grieving Parents==
The cemetery also contains a pair of statues – &quot;The Grieving Parents&quot; – by Käthe Kollwitz, a noted German sculptor. She made the statues in the 1930s as a tribute to her youngest son, Peter, who was killed in October 1914 and is buried in the cemetery. The eyes on the father-figure gaze on the stone directly in front of him, on which Kollwitz&#x27;s son&#x27;s name is engraved.

<text>John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin (, , abbreviation KUL) is a university established in 1918.

==History==
Father Idzi Benedykt Radziszewski founded the university in 1918. Lenin allowed the priest to take the library and equipment of the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy to Poland to launch the university just as Poland regained its independence.

The aim of the university was to be a modern place of higher education that would conduct research in the spirit of harmony between science and faith. The university sought to produce a new Catholic intelligentsia that would play a leading role in Poland. The number of students increased from 399 in 1918–19, to 1440 in 1937–38. This growth was interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War and Nazi Germany&#x27;s occupation of Poland. Of all the universities located in the German-occupied territory, the University of Lublin was the only one to resume work in October 1939. On 23 November 1939, the Nazis executed a number of academic workers, including, among others, professors Michał Niechaj and Czesław Martyniak.

The university was ordered shut down and its buildings were converted into a military hospital. Nevertheless, the university carried on its teaching activities in secret. After the invasion of Lublin in July 1944 by the Red Army, the university reopened on 21 August 1944. Since then the university has functioned without interruption. The university stayed open during the years Poland was under Communist control between 1944 and 1989, though some of its faculties did not. The faculties of law, social science and education were shut down between 1953 and 1956. It was the only independent, Catholic university in existence in the entire Soviet bloc. Given that the Communist governments all insisted on having a total monopoly of control over educational institutions, the preservation of its independence was a great achievement.

The university was often harassed in various ways by the Communist authorities, especially in the 1950s and the 1960s. The university faculty were under frequent surveillance by the secret police. Periodically some faculties were denied by the state the right to grant graduate degrees. The employment prospects of its graduates were limited.

Despite the difficulties, the university&#x27;s independence was maintained and it never adopted Marxist dogmas taught at all the other state universities. It served as a haven for students who were expelled from state universities for political reasons.

After the fall of Communism in Poland in 1989, the university has flourished, quadrupling its student population and greatly expanding its campus. In 2010 the university was involved in a scandal concerning the granting of PhDs by departments that were not allowed to grant them, due to not having a sufficient number of academic staff.

==Rankings==
The university has had a steady advance in university rankings. In 2011, it was placed 8th among all Polish universities. Also in 2011, &quot;Wprost&quot; magazine ranked it 15th among humanity universities. Before that, in 2006 &quot;Newsweek Polska&quot; ranked the university 54th among all Polish universities.

In 2011–12, the university&#x27;s philosophy program was ranked first in Poland by the Polish Accreditation Agency, distinguished twice, receiving 9 million PLN total in grants that year as a result.

==Notable alumni and professors==
* Pope John Paul II (Karol Wojtyła), the most famous person associated with the university. Wojtyła earned a licentiate in theology in July 1947, and successfully defended his doctoral thesis entitled &quot;Doctrina de fide apud S. Ioannem a Cruce&quot; (&quot;Doctrine of Faith in St. John of the Cross&quot;) in philosophy on 19 June 1948 at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; in Rome. Although his doctoral work was unanimously approved in June 1948, he was denied the degree because he could not afford to print the text of his dissertation (an &quot;Angelicum&quot; rule). In December of that year, a revised text of his dissertation was approved by the theological faculty of Jagiellonian University in Kraków, and Wojtyła was awarded the degree. He became a part-time teacher of philosophy at KUL starting in 1954, sharing his time between teaching in Lublin and doing his pastoral work in Kraków. After he became archbishop of Kraków in 1963 and a cardinal in 1967, his duties limited the time he was able to spend teaching in Lublin, and his students often commuted to his lectures in Kraków. His involvement with the university continued until he was elected pope in 1978. All of his philosophical works were published in Lublin.

<text>The first USS &quot;Pike&quot; (SS-6) was a in the service of the United States Navy, later renamed as &quot;A-5&quot;.

She was laid down on 10 December 1900 at San Francisco, California by Union Iron Works, launched on 14 January 1903, and commissioned on 28 May 1903 at the Mare Island Navy Yard with Lieutenant Arthur MacArthur III in command.

&quot;Pike&quot; operated out of the Mare Island Navy Yard for over three years, operating principally in experimental and training roles. Following the earthquake and subsequent fire at San Francisco on 18 April 1906, members of Pike&#x27;s crew took part in the relief efforts in the wake of the disaster.

Decommissioned on 28 November 1906, &quot;Pike&quot; remained inactive until 8 June 1908, when she was recommissioned for local operations with the Pacific Torpedo Flotilla, off the Pacific coast. She remained attached to this unit into June 1912. &quot;Pike&quot; was renamed &quot;A-5&quot; on 17 November 1911.

&quot;A-5&quot; arrived at the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 26 June 1912, and was placed in reserve two days later. Following two and a half years of inactivity there, &quot;A-5&quot; was loaded onto the collier on 15 February 1915 (her sister-ship &quot;A-3&quot; was loaded the next day). &quot;A-5&quot; made the voyage to the Philippines as deck cargo. She arrived at Olongapo on 26 March. Launched on 13 April, she was recommissioned on 17 April and assigned to the Asiatic Fleet.

Shortly after the United States entered World War I, &quot;A-5&quot; sank while moored at the Cavite Navy Yard on 15 April 1917; her sinking was attributed to a slow leak in a main ballast tank. She was raised on 19 April and, following reconditioning, returned to active service. Like her sister-ships, she patrolled the waters off the entrance to Manila Bay during the course of the war with the Central Powers.

&quot;A-5&quot;, given the alphanumeric hull number SS-6 on 17 July 1920, was decommissioned on 25 July 1921. Earmarked as a target vessel, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 16 January 1922.

<text>A breakaway is a situation in ice hockey in which a player with the puck has no defending players except for the goaltender between him or her and the opposing goal, so is free to skate in and shoot at will (before the out-of-position defenders can catch up). A breakaway is considered a lapse on the part of the defending team. If a player&#x27;s progress is illegally impeded by an opposing player or if the goalie&#x27;s stick is thrown forward, the breakaway player is awarded a penalty shot. If a player faces an empty net (i.e., the opposing team has pulled their goalie) and is illegally impeded by an opposing player, he or she is automatically awarded a goal instead of taking a penalty shot.

<text>Blue Star Memorial Highways are highways in the United States that are marked to pay tribute to the U.S. armed forces. The National Council of State Garden Clubs, now known as National Garden Clubs, Inc., started the program in 1945 after World War II. The blue star was used on service flags to denote a service member fighting in the war. The program has since been expanded to include Memorial Markers and Memorial By-ways (since 1994). These markers are used in National Cemeteries, parks, veterans facilities, and gardens.

<text>The third USS &quot;Porpoise&quot; (SS-7) was an early in the service of the United States Navy, later renamed as A-6.

She was laid down on 13 December 1900 in Elizabeth, New Jersey at the Crescent Shipyard under the direction of shipyard superintendent, Arthur Leopold Busch. This craft was launched on 23 September 1901, and commissioned at the Holland Torpedo Boatyard at New Suffolk, New York on 19 September 1903.

==Early service==
Assigned initially to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport for experimental torpedo firing work, &quot;Porpoise&quot; entered the New York Navy Yard in September 1904 for repairs and alterations, remaining there until February 1906. Assigned then to the First Torpedo Flotilla on 7 March 1907, she operated at Annapolis, Maryland — temporarily assigned to the United States Naval Academy for instruction of future naval officers — until June. Taken subsequently to the New York Navy Yard, she was decommissioned on 21 April 1908. Partially disassembled, she was then loaded onto the after well deck of the collier for a voyage to the Philippines as deck cargo along with her sister ship via the Suez Canal.

Arriving at the Naval Station at Cavite, &quot;Porpoise&quot; was launched on 8 July 1908, and recommissioned on 20 November. Due to the small size of &quot;Plunger&quot;-class boats, officers and men lived on board the gunboat .

==Whiting&#x27;s experiment==
In April 1909, Ensign Kenneth Whiting, a future naval aviation pioneer, became the commanding officer of &quot;Porpoise&quot;. On 15 April, Whiting and his crew of six took the submarine out for what was to be a routine run. &quot;Porpoise&quot; got underway, cleared the dock and moved out into Manila Bay. She dove soon thereafter, and leveled off at a depth of . Only then did Whiting reveal the purpose of the dive.

Convinced that a man could escape from a submarine through the torpedo tube, Whiting determined that he was going to try and test his theory with himself as a guinea pig. Squeezing into the 18 inch (450 mm) diameter tube, he clung to the crossbar which stiffened the outer torpedo tube door, as the crew closed the inner door. When the outer door was opened and water rushed in, Whiting hung onto the crossbar that drew his elbows out of the tube&#x27;s mouth, and then muscled his way out using his hands and arms, the entire evolution consuming 77 seconds. He then swam to the surface, &quot;Porpoise&quot; surfacing soon thereafter. Reluctant to speak about the incident in public, he nevertheless informed his flotilla commander, Lt. Guy W.S. Castle, who submitted a report on how the feat had been accomplished. In &quot;Porpoise&#x27;s&quot; log that day, Whiting had simply commented: &quot;Whiting went through the torpedo tube, boat lying in (the) water in (a) normal condition, as an experiment...&quot;

==Asiatic fleet and later service==
Subsequently, becoming a unit of the First Submarine Division, Asiatic Torpedo Fleet, on 9 December 1909, &quot;Porpoise&quot; continued her routine of local operations out of Cavite for the next decade. Renamed A-6 on 17 November 1911, she patrolled the entrance to Manila Bay and convoyed vessels out of port during World War I, under the command of Lt. A.H. Bailey. Placed in ordinary on 1 December 1918, she spent a little over a year in that status, until decommissioned on 12 December 1919 and turned over to the Commandant of the Naval Station at Cavite for disposal. Given the alphanumeric hull number SS-7 on 17 July 1920, &quot;A-6&quot; was authorized for use as a target in July 1921 and as of 16 January 1922 was struck from the Naval Vessel Register.

<text>The matrix or groundmass of a rock is the finer-grained mass of material in which larger grains, crystals, or clasts are embedded.

The matrix of an igneous rock consists of finer-grained, often microscopic, crystals in which larger crystals, called phenocrysts, are embedded. This porphyritic texture is indicative of multi-stage cooling of magma. For example, porphyritic andesite will have large phenocrysts of plagioclase in a fine-grained matrix. Also in South Africa, diamonds are often mined from a matrix of weathered clay-like rock (kimberlite) called &quot;yellow ground&quot;.

The matrix of sedimentary rocks is finer-grained sedimentary material, such as clay or silt, in which larger grains or clasts are embedded. It is also used to describe the rock material in which a fossil is embedded.

==Cementation==
All sediments are at first in an incoherent condition (e.g. sands, clays and gravels, beds of shells), and they may remain in this state for an indefinite period. Millions of years have elapsed since some of the early Tertiary strata gathered on the ocean floor, yet they are quite friable (e.g. the London Clay) and differ little from many recent accumulations. There are few exceptions to the rule that with increasing age sedimentary rocks become more and more indurated. Generally, the older the strata the more likely it is that they will have the firm consistency generally implied in the term &quot;rock&quot;.

The pressure of newer sediments on underlying masses is apparently one cause of this hardening, though not in itself a very powerful one. More efficiency is generally ascribed to the action of percolating water, which takes up water-soluble materials and then redeposits them in pores and cavities. This operation is probably accelerated by the increased pressure produced by superincumbent masses, and to some extent also by the rise of temperature which inevitably takes place in rocks buried to some depth beneath the surface. The rise of temperature, however, may be only a tiny increase; we know more than one instance of sedimentary deposits which have been buried beneath four or five miles of similar strata (e.g. parts of the Old Red Sandstone), and yet no perceptible difference is apparent between beds of similar composition at the top of the series and near its base. Should the deposits have been truly &quot;baked&quot;, that is, subject to a large increase in temperature, then differences would be evident.

The redeposited cementing material is most commonly calcareous or siliceous. Limestones, which were originally a loose accumulation of shells, corals, etc., become compacted into firm rock in this manner; and the process often takes place with surprising ease, as for example, in the deeper parts of coral reefs, or even in wind-blown masses of shelly sand exposed merely to the action of rain. The cementing substance may be regularly deposited in crystalline continuity on the original grains, where these were crystalline, and even in sandstones (such as Kentish rag), a crystalline matrix of calcite often envelops the sand grains. The change of aragonite to calcite and of calcite to dolomite, by forming new crystalline masses in the interior of the rock, usually also accelerates consolidations. Silica is less easily soluble in ordinary waters, but even this ingredient of rocks is dissolved and redeposited with great frequency. Many sandstones are held together by an infinitesimal amount of colloid or cryptocrystalline silica; when freshly dug from the quarry they are soft and easily trimmed, but after exposure to the air for some time they become much harder, as their siliceous cement sets and passes into a rigid condition. Others contain fine scales of kaolin or of mica. Argillaceous materials may be compacted by mere pressure, like graphite and other scaly minerals.

<text>Canadian federal elections have provided the following results in Northern Montreal.
==Regional profile==
The North End of Montreal has significant immigrant populations and generally supports the Liberals, although the BQ captured Ahuntsic and Bourassa in their 1993 near-sweep of the province, and took Ahuntsic and Papineau in 2006 as the Bloc gained support among immigrant groups. This area was traditionally Liberal until Mulroney&#x27;s rise to power in 1984, which lowered the Liberals hold on the area to only two seats. The Bloc hoped to gain additional support here to counter any losses in rural Quebec to the Conservatives, who are very weak here.

In the event, however, the region was affected by the NDP &quot;orange wave&quot; that swept through Quebec in 2011. The Liberals retained ridings in Montreal, and the Bloc was left with Ahuntsic as its only seat in the entire Montreal region. In 2015, however, the Liberals swept the entire region, undoubtedly buoyed by Justin Trudeau representing a riding in this region. They maintained their sweep in 2019 and 2021.

<doc id="752390" wikidata="Q1777790" url="?curid=752390" title="Niqqud">
<text>In Hebrew orthography, niqqud or nikud ( or ) is a system of diacritical signs used to represent vowels or distinguish between alternative pronunciations of letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Several such diacritical systems were developed in the Early Middle Ages. The most widespread system, and the only one still used to a significant degree today, was created by the Masoretes of Tiberias in the second half of the first millennium AD in the Land of Israel (see Masoretic Text, Tiberian Hebrew). Text written with niqqud is called &quot;ktiv menuqad&quot;.

Niqqud marks are small compared to the letters, so they can be added without retranscribing texts whose writers did not anticipate them.

In modern Israeli orthography, &quot;niqqud&quot; is mainly used in specialised texts such as dictionaries, poetry, or texts for children or new immigrants to Israel. For purposes of disambiguation, a system of spelling without niqqud, known in Hebrew as &quot;ktiv maleh&quot; (, literally &quot;full spelling&quot;) had developed before the introduction of &quot;niqqud&quot;. This was formally standardised in the &quot;Rules for Spelling without Niqqud&quot; () enacted by the Academy of the Hebrew Language in 1996, and updated in 2017. Nevertheless, &quot;niqqud&quot; is still used occasionally in texts to prevent ambiguity and mispronunciation of specific words. 
One reason for the lesser use of niqqud is that it no longer reflects the current pronunciation. In modern Hebrew, &quot;tzere&quot; is pronounced the same as &quot;segol&quot;, although they were distinct in Tiberian Hebrew, and &quot;pataḥ&quot; the same as &quot;qamatz&quot;. To the younger generation of native Hebrew speakers, these distinctions seem arbitrary and meaningless; on the other hand, Hebrew language purists have rejected out of hand the idea of changing the basics of niqqud and fitting them to the current pronunciation – with the result that in practice niqqud is increasingly going out of use.

According to Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann, the lack of niqqud in what he calls &quot;Israeli&quot; (Modern Hebrew) often results in &quot;mispronunciations&quot;. For example, the Israeli lexical item is often pronounced as &quot;mitabním&quot; (literally &quot;becoming fossilized (masculine plural)&quot;) instead of &quot;metaavním&quot; &quot;appetizers&quot;, the latter deriving from &quot;teavón&quot; &quot;appetite&quot;, the former deriving from &quot;éven&quot; &quot;stone&quot;. Another example is the toponym , which is often pronounced as &quot;maalé edomím&quot; instead of &quot;maalé adumím&quot;, the latter appearing in the Hebrew Bible (Joshua 15:7 and 18:17). The hypercorrect &quot;yotvetá&quot; is used instead of &quot;yotváta&quot; for the toponym , mentioned in Deuteronomy 10:7. The surname of American actress Farrah Fawcett () is often pronounced &quot;fost&quot; instead of &quot;fóset&quot; by many Israelis.

==Chart ==
This table uses the consonant letters &#x27;, &#x27; or , where appropriate, to demonstrate where the niqqud is placed in relation to the consonant it is pronounced after. Any other letters shown are actually part of the vowel. Note that there is some variation among different traditions in exactly how some vowel points are pronounced. The table below shows how most Israelis would pronounce them, but the classic Ashkenazi pronunciation, for example, differs in several respects.

Note concerning IPA: the transcription symbols are linked to the articles about the sounds they represent. The diacritic ˘ (breve) indicates a short vowel; the triangular colon symbol ː indicates that the vowel is long.

==Keyboard==
Both consonants and niqqud can be typed from virtual graphical keyboards available on the World Wide Web, or by methods integrated into particular operating systems.

===Microsoft Windows===
* In Windows 8 or later, niqqud can be entered using the right alt (or left alt + ctrl) + the first Hebrew letter of the name of the value, when using the default (Hebrew Standard) keyboard layout:

*In Windows 7 or earlier, niqqud can be entered by enabling Caps Lock and then, with the cursor positioned after a letter, pressing Shift and one of the keys in the Windows column below.
* The user can configure the registry to allow use of the Alt key with the numeric plus key to type the hexadecimal Unicode value.
* The user can use the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator to produce a custom keyboard layout, or can download a layout produced by another party.

===Linux===
In GTK+ Linux systems, niqqud can be entered by holding down AltGR and pressing the same keys as for Windows, above, or by pressing ctrl+shift+u followed by the appropriate 4 digit Unicode.

===macOS===
Using the Hebrew keyboard layout in macOS, the typist can enter niqqud by pressing the Option key together with a number on the top row of the keyboard. Other combinations such as &quot;sofit&quot; and &quot;hataf&quot; can also be entered by pressing either the Shift key and a number, or by pressing the Shift key, Option key, and a number at the same time.
Notes:
* 1 The letter &quot; represents any Hebrew consonant.
* 2 For sin-dot and shin-dot, the letter &quot; (sin/shin) is used.
* 3 The dagesh, mappiq, and shuruk have different uses, but the same graphical representation, and hence are input in the same manner.
* 4 For shuruk, the letter &quot;&quot; (vav) is used since it can only be used with that letter.
* A rafe can be input by inserting the corresponding Unicode character, either explicitly or via a customized keyboard layout.

SIL International have developed another standard, which is based on Tiro, but adds the Niqqud along the home keys. Linux comes with &quot;Israel — Biblical Hebrew (Tiro)&quot; as a standard layout. With this layout, niqqud can be typed without pressing the Caps Lock key.
