<text>Anne Tyler (born October 25, 1941) is an American novelist, short story writer, and literary critic. She has published twenty-four novels, including &quot;Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant&quot; (1982), &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot; (1985), and &quot;Breathing Lessons&quot; (1988). All three were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and &quot;Breathing Lessons&quot; won the prize in 1989. She has also won the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize, the Ambassador Book Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award. In 2012 she was awarded &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Award for Literary Excellence. Tyler&#x27;s twentieth novel, &quot;A Spool of Blue Thread&quot;, was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize in 2015, and &quot;Redhead By the Side of the Road&quot; was longlisted for the same award in 2020. 

She is recognized for her fully developed characters, her &quot;brilliantly imagined and absolutely accurate detail&quot;, her &quot;rigorous and artful style&quot;, and her &quot;astute and open language.&quot;

Tyler has been compared to John Updike, Jane Austen, and Eudora Welty, among others.

== Early life and education ==
=== Early childhood ===
The oldest of four children, she was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Her father, Lloyd Parry Tyler, was an industrial chemist and her mother, Phyllis Mahon Tyler, a social worker. Both her parents were Quakers who were very active with social causes in the Midwest and the South. Her family lived in a succession of Quaker communities in the South until they settled in 1948 in a Quaker commune in Celo, in the mountains of North Carolina near Burnsville. The Celo Community settlement was populated largely by conscientious objectors and members of the liberal Hicksite branch of the Society of Friends. Tyler lived there from age seven through eleven and helped her parents and others care for livestock and organic farming. While she did not attend formal public school in Celo, lessons were taught in art, carpentry, and cooking in homes and in other subjects in a tiny school house. Her early informal training was supplemented by correspondence school.

Her first memory of her own creative story-telling was of crawling under the bed covers at age three and &quot;telling myself stories in order to get to sleep at night.&quot; Her first book at age seven was a collection of drawings and stories about &quot;lucky girls ... who got to go west in covered wagons.&quot; Her favorite book as a child was &quot;The Little House&quot; by Virginia Lee Burton. Tyler acknowledges that this book, which she read many times during this period of limited access to books, had a profound influence on her, showing &quot;how the years flowed by, people altered, and nothing could ever stay the same.&quot; This early perception of changes over time is a theme that reappears in many of her novels decades later, just as &quot;The Little House&quot; itself appears in her novel &quot;Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant&quot;. Tyler also describes reading &quot;Little Women&quot; 22 times as a child. When the Tyler family left Celo after four years to move to Raleigh, North Carolina, eleven-year-old Tyler had never attended public school and never used a telephone. This unorthodox upbringing enabled her to view &quot;the normal world with a certain amount of distance and surprise.&quot;

Tyler felt herself to be an outsider in the public schools she attended in Raleigh, a feeling that has followed her most of her life. She believes that this sense of being an outsider has contributed to her becoming a writer: &quot;I believe that any kind of setting-apart situation will do [to become a writer]. In my case, it was emerging from the commune ... and trying to fit into the outside world.&quot; Despite her lack of public schooling prior to age eleven, Anne entered school academically well ahead of most of her classmates in Raleigh. With access now to libraries, she discovered Eudora Welty, Gabriel García Márquez, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and many others. Eudora Welty remains one of her favorite writers, and &quot;The Wide Net and Other Stories&quot; is one of her favorite books; she has called Welty &quot;my crowning influence.&quot; She credits Welty with showing her that books could be about the everyday details of life, not just about major events. During her years at Needham B. Broughton High School in Raleigh, she was inspired and encouraged by a remarkable English teacher, Phyllis Peacock. &quot;Mrs. Peacock&quot; had previously taught the writer Reynolds Price, under whom Tyler would later study at Duke University. Peacock would also later teach the writer Armistead Maupin. Seven years after high school, Tyler would dedicate her first published novel to &quot;Mrs. Peacock, for everything you&#x27;ve done.&quot;

When Tyler graduated from high school at age sixteen, she wanted to attend Swarthmore College, a school founded in 1860 by the Hicksite branch of the Society of Friends. However, she had won a full AB Duke scholarship to Duke University, and her parents pressured her to go to Duke because they needed to save money for the education of her three younger brothers. At Duke, Tyler enrolled in Reynolds Price&#x27;s first creative writing class, which also included a future poet, Fred Chappell. Price was most impressed with the sixteen-year-old Tyler, describing her as &quot;frighteningly mature for 16,&quot; &quot;wide-eyed,&quot; and &quot;an outsider.&quot; Years later Price would describe Tyler as &quot;one of the best novelists alive in the world, ... who was almost as good a writer at 16 as she is now.&quot; Tyler took an additional creative writing course with Price and also studied under William Blackburn, who also had taught William Styron, Josephine Humphreys, and James Applewhite at Duke, as well as Price and Chappell.

As a college student, Tyler had not yet determined she wanted to become a writer. She loved painting and the visual arts. She also was involved in the drama society in high school and at Duke, where she acted in a number of plays, playing Laura in &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; and Mrs. Gibbs in &quot;Our Town&quot;. She majored in Russian Literature at Duke—not English—and graduated in 1961, at age nineteen, having been inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. With her Russian Literature background she received a fellowship to graduate school in Slavic Studies at Columbia University.

Living in New York City was quite an adjustment for her. There she became somewhat addicted to riding trains and subways: &quot;While I rode I often felt like I was ... an enormous eye taking things in, turning them over and sorting them out ... writing was the only way&quot; [to express her observations]. Tyler left Columbia graduate school after a year, having completed course work but not her master&#x27;s thesis. She returned to Duke, where she got a job in the library as a Russian bibliographer. It was there that she met Taghi Modarressi, a resident in child psychiatry in Duke Medical School and a writer himself, and they were married a year later (1963).

== Career ==
=== Early writing and first publications ===
While an undergraduate at Duke, Tyler published her short story &quot;Laura&quot; in the Duke literary journal &quot;Archive&quot;, for which she won the newly created Anne Flexner award for creative writing. In college and prior to her marriage, she wrote many short stories, one of which impressed Reynolds Price so that he later stated that it was the &quot;most finished, most accomplished short story I have ever received from an undergraduate in my thirty years of teaching.&quot; &quot;The Saints in Caesar&#x27;s Household&quot; was published in &quot;Archive&quot; also and won her a second Anne Flexner award. This short story led to her meeting Diarmuid Russell, to whom Price had sent it with kudos. Russell, who was an agent for both Reynolds Price and for Tyler&#x27;s &quot;crowning influence&quot; Eudora Welty, later became Tyler&#x27;s agent.

While working at the Duke University library, before and after marrying Modarressi—Tyler did continue to write short stories and started work on her first novel, &quot;If Morning Ever Comes&quot;. During this period her short stories appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, and &quot;Harpers&quot;. After the couple moved to Montreal—Modarressi&#x27;s U.S. visa had expired and they moved there so he could finish his residency—Tyler continued writing while looking for work. Her first novel was published in 1964 and &quot;The Tin Can Tree&quot; was published the next year. Years later she disowned both of these novels, as well as many of the short stories she wrote during this period. She has even written that she &quot;would like to burn them.&quot; She feels that most of this early work suffers from the lack of thorough character development and her failure to rework material repeatedly.

In 1965 at age 24, Tyler had her first child, a daughter they named Tezh. Two years later a second daughter, Mitra, was born. About this time, the couple moved to Baltimore, MD as Taghi had finished his residency and obtained a position at the University of Maryland Medical School. With the moves, the changes in jobs, and the raising of two young children, Tyler had little time or energy for writing and published nothing between 1965 and 1970. She settled comfortably in the city of Baltimore where she has remained and where she has set most of her subsequent novels. Baltimore is generally considered to have a true mix of Southern and Northern culture. It also is an area of considerable Quaker presence, and Tyler eventually enrolled both her daughters in a local Friends school. During this period she began writing literary reviews for journals, newspapers, etc. to provide the family with additional income; she would continue this employment until the late 1980s, writing approximately 250 reviews in total. While this period was not productive for her writing career, Tyler does feel that this time enriched her spirit and her experience and in turn gave her subsequent writing greater depth, as she had &quot;more of a self to speak from.&quot;

Tyler began writing again in 1970 and had published three more novels by 1974: &quot;A Slipping-Down Life&quot;, &quot;The Clock Winder&quot;, and &quot;Celestial Navigation&quot;. In her own opinion, her writing improved considerably during this period; with her children entering school, she was able to devote a great deal more focus to it than had been possible since she graduated from Duke. With &quot;Celestial Navigation&quot;, Tyler began to get national recognition: Gail Godwin gave it a very favorable review in the &quot;New York Times Review of Books&quot;. While she is not proud of her first four novels, Tyler considers this fifth novel one of her favorites. It was a difficult book to write she notes, since it required rewriting draft after draft to truly develop her understanding of the characters. John Updike gave a favorable review to her next novel, &quot;Searching for Caleb&quot;, writing: &quot;Funny and lyric and true, exquisite in its details and ambitious in its design ... This writer is not merely good, she is wickedly good.&quot; Afterwards he proceeded to take an interest in her work and reviewed her next four novels as well. &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Passing&quot; (1980) won the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize for Fiction and was nominated for both the American Book Awards and the National Book Critics Circle Award. Joyce Carol Oates gave it good review in &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;: &quot;Fascinating ... So unconventional a love story that it appears to take its protagonists themselves by surprise.&quot;

=== National recognition===
With her next novel, Tyler truly arrived as a recognized artist in the literary world. Tyler&#x27;s ninth novel, &quot;Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant&quot;, which she considers her best work, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, PEN/Faulkner Award, and the American Book Award for Fiction in 1983. In his review in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, John Updike wrote, &quot;Her art needed only the darkening that would give her beautifully shaped sketches solidity ... In her ninth novel, she has arrived at a new level of power.&quot; Her tenth novel, &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot;, was awarded the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction in 1985, the Ambassador Book Award for Fiction in 1986, and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 1986. It was also made into a 1988 movie starring William Hurt and Geena Davis. The critical and commercial success of the film further increased the public awareness of her work. Her 11th novel, &quot;Breathing Lessons&quot;, received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1989 and was &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Book of the Year&quot;. It was adapted into a 1994 TV movie, as eventually were four other of her novels.

Since her Pulitzer Prize with &quot;Breathing Lessons&quot;, Tyler has written 13 more novels; many have been Book of the Month Club Main Selections and have become &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestsellers. &quot;Ladder of Years&quot; was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; as one of the ten best books of 1995. &quot;A Patchwork Planet&quot; was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Book (1999). &quot;Saint Maybe&quot; (1991) and &quot;Back When We Were Grownups&quot; (2001) were adapted into TV movies in 1998 and 2004, respectively. In her 2006 novel &quot;Digging to America&quot;, she explored how an immigrant from Iran, who has lived in the U. S. for 35 years, deals with her &quot;outsiderness,&quot; perspectives with which Tyler is familiar due to her marriage to Iranian psychiatrist Taghi Mohammad Modarressi.

In addition to her novels, Tyler has published short stories in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Redbook&quot;, &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, but they have never been published as a collection. Her stories include &quot;Average Waves in Unprotected Waters&quot; (1977), &quot;Holding Things Together&quot; (1977), and &quot;Teenage Wasteland&quot; (1983). Between 1983 and 1996, she edited three anthologies: &quot;The Best American Short Stories 1983&quot;, &quot;Best of the South&quot;, and &quot;Best of the South: The Best of the Second Decade&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1963, Tyler married Iranian psychiatrist and novelist Taghi Mohammad Modarressi. Modarressi, 10 years her senior, had left Iran and his family as a political refugee at age 25. After a year and a half internship in Wichita, Kansas, he obtained a residency in child psychiatry at Duke University Medical School. There he met Tyler and discovered their common interest in literature. Modarressi had written two award-winning novels in Persian and so was quite an accomplished writer himself. He later wrote three more novels, two of which Tyler helped to translate to English (&quot;The Book of Absent People&quot; and &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Rules of Etiquette&quot;). In the 1980s, Modarressi founded the Center for Infant Study in Baltimore and the Cold Spring Family Center Therapeutic Nursery in Pimlico, Maryland, which dealt with children who had experienced emotional trauma. Modarressi died in 1997 at the age of 65, from lymphoma.

Tyler and Modarressi had two daughters, Tezh and Mitra. Both share their mother&#x27;s interest in, and talent for, painting. Tezh is a professional photographer, and an artist who works primarily in oils, who painted the cover of her mother&#x27;s novel, &quot;Ladder of Years&quot;. Mitra is a professional illustrator working primarily in watercolors. She has illustrated seven books, including two children&#x27;s books co-authored with Tyler (&quot;Tumble Tower&quot; and &quot;Timothy Tugbottom Says No!&quot;).

Tyler resides in the Roland Park neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland, where most of her novels are set. Today tourists can even take an &quot;Anne Tyler tour&quot; of the area. For some time she was noteworthy among contemporary best-selling novelists, for she rarely granted face-to-face interviews nor did book tours nor made other public appearances. In 2012 she broke with this policy and gave her first face-to-face interview in almost 40 years; subsequently, Mark Lawson interviewed her on BBC Radio in 2013 about her approach to writing. In 2015, she discussed her 20th novel, &quot;A Spool of Blue Thread&quot;, in a live radio interview with Diane Rehm and callers on &quot;The Diane Rehm Show&quot;.

== Writing style, influences, and philosophy ==
Tyler&#x27;s novels have been reviewed and analyzed by numerous fellow authors, scholars and professional critics. The summary that follows of the nature of her work relies upon selected descriptions and insights by a limited number of the many distinguished literati who have reviewed her works. Also Tyler herself has revealed much about her own writing through interviews. Although she has refused to participate in face-to-face interviews until very recently, she has participated in numerous e-mail interviews over the years. These e-mail interviews have provided material for biographies, journal articles, reader&#x27;s guides, and instructional materials.

=== Classification of her literature ===
Tyler has occasionally been classified as a &quot;Southern author&quot; or a &quot;modern American author.&quot; The Southern category apparently results from the fact that she grew up and went to college in the South. Also she admired and/or studied under well-known Southern authors Eudora Welty and Reynolds Price. In a rare interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Tyler cited Eudora Welty as a major literary influence: &quot;Reading Eudora Welty when I was growing up showed me that very small things are often really larger than the large things&quot;. However, poet and author Katha Pollitt notes, &quot;It is hard to classify Anne Tyler&#x27;s novels. They are Southern in their sure sense of family and place but lack the taste for violence and the Gothic that often characterizes self-consciously southern literature. They are modern in their fictional techniques, yet utterly unconcerned with contemporary moment as a subject, so that, with only minor dislocations, her stories could just as well have taken place in twenties or thirties.&quot;

It is also difficult to classify Tyler in terms of themes; as she herself notes, &quot;I don&#x27;t think of my work in terms of themes. I&#x27;m just trying to tell a story.&quot; Tyler goes on to say, &quot;Any large &#x27;questions of life&#x27; that emerge in my novels are accidental—not a reason for writing the novel in the first place but either (1) questions that absorb my characters, quite apart from me, or (2) on occasion, questions that may be thematic to my own life at the moment, even if I&#x27;m not entirely aware of them. Answers, if they come, come from the characters&#x27; experiences, not from mine, and I often find myself viewing those answers with a sort of distant, bemused surprise.&quot;

=== Characters and detailed descriptions ===

In Tyler&#x27;s works, the characters are the driving forces behind the stories and the starting point for her writing: &quot;I do make a point of writing down every imaginable facet of my characters before I begin a book, trying to get to know them so I can figure out how they&#x27;ll react in any situation ... My reason for writing now is to live lives other than my own, and I do that by burrowing deeper and deeper ... till I reach the center of those lives.&quot; In 1976, Pollitt described her skill in this way: &quot;Tyler [is] polishing brighter and brighter a craft many novelists no longer deem essential to their purpose: the unfolding of character through brilliantly imagined and absolutely accurate detail.&quot; 

Twelve years later, Michiko Kakutani, in her review of &quot;Breathing Lessons&quot;, praised &quot;[Tyler&#x27;s] ability to select details that reveal precisely how her characters feel and think&quot; and her &quot;gift for sympathy, for presenting each character&#x27;s case with humor and compassion.&quot; Kakutani later went on to note that &quot;each character in &quot;Saint Maybe&quot; has been fully rendered, fleshed out with a palpable interior life, and each has been fit, like a hand-sawed jigsaw-puzzle piece, into the matrix of family life.&quot; Carol Shields, also writing about her characters, observes: &quot;Tyler has always put her characters to work. Their often humble or eccentric occupations, carefully observed and threaded with humor, are tightly sewn to the other parts of their lives, offering them the mixed benefit of tedium and consolation, as well as a lighted stage for the unfolding of their dramatic selves. She also allows her men and women an opportunity for redemption.&quot;

Tyler has spoken about the importance of her characters to her stories: &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, character is everything. I never did see why I have to throw in a plot, too.&quot; In a 1977 interview, she stated that &quot;the real joy of writing is how people can surprise one. My people wander around my study until the novel is done. It&#x27;s one reason I&#x27;m very careful not to write about people I don&#x27;t like. If I find somebody creeping in that I&#x27;m not really fond of, I usually take him out.&quot; Pollitt had even earlier noted how Tyler&#x27;s characters seem to take on a life of their own that she doesn&#x27;t seem to totally control: &quot;Her complex, crotchety inventions surprise us, but one senses they surprise her too.&quot;

=== Realism through details ===
Just as Tyler is difficult to categorize as a novelist, it is also challenging to label her style. Novelist Cathleen Schine describes how her &quot;style without a style&quot; manages to pull the reader into the story: &quot;So rigorous and artful is the style without a style, so measured and delicate is each observation, so complex is the structure and so astute and open the language, that the reader can relax, feel secure in the narrative and experience the work as something real and natural -- even inevitable.&quot; The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; made a similar point: &quot;One does not so much read a Tyler novel as visit it. Her ability to conduct several conversations at once while getting the food to the table turns the act of reading into a kind of transport.&quot; Reviewer Tom Shone put it this way: &quot;You&#x27;re involved before you ever notice you were paying attention.&quot; Joyce Carol Oates, in her review of &quot;The Amateur Marriage&quot;, perhaps described the phenomenon best: &quot;When the realistic novel works its magic, you won&#x27;t simply have read about the experiences of fictitious characters, you will have seemed to have lived them; your knowledge of their lives transcends their own, for they can only live in chronological time. The experience of reading such fiction when it&#x27;s carefully composed can be breathtaking, like being given the magical power of reliving passages of our own lives, indecipherable at the time of being lived.&quot;

=== Focus on family and marriage ===
While Tyler herself does not like to think of her novels in terms of themes, numerous reviewers and scholars have noted the importance of family and marriage relationships to her characters and stories. Liesl Schillinger summarized: &quot;Taken together, the distinct but overlapping worlds of her novels have formed a Sensurround literary record of the 20th century American family—or, at least, of the proud but troubled archetypal families that ... interested her most.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Michiko Kakutani has been reviewing Tyler&#x27;s novels for over 25 years. She has frequently noted Tyler&#x27;s themes with regard to family and marriage. Reviewing &quot;Noah&#x27;s Compass&quot;, Kakutani states that &quot;the central concern of most of this author&#x27;s characters has always been their need to define themselves in terms of family — the degree to which they see themselves as creatures shaped by genetics, childhood memories and parental and spousal expectations, and the degree to which they are driven to embrace independent identities of their own.&quot;. This is an example of where Anne Tyler got some of her characteristics from, being able to be independent and get to know herself through her writing.

Reviewing &quot;Saint Maybe&quot;, Jay Parini describes how Tyler&#x27;s characters must deal with &quot;Ms. Tyler&#x27;s oddball families, which any self-respecting therapist would call &#x27;dysfunctional&#x27; ... An inexplicable centripetal force hurls these relatives upon one another, catches them in a dizzying inward spiral of obligation, affection and old-fashioned guilt—as well as an inexpressible longing for some perfect or &quot;normal&quot; family in a distant past that never really was. Almost every novel by Anne Tyler begins with a loss or absence that reactivates in the family some primordial sense of itself.&quot; Larry McMurtry wrote, &quot;in book after book, siblings are drawn inexorably back home, as if their parents or (more often) grandparents had planted tiny magnets in them which can be activated once they have seen what the extrafamilial world is like. ... sooner or later a need to be with people who are really familiar – their brothers and sisters – overwhelms them.&quot;

Novelist Julia Glass has similarly written about Tyler&#x27;s characters&#x27; families: &quot;What makes each story distinctive is the particular way its characters rebel against hereditary confines, cope with fateful crises or forge relationships with new acquaintances who rock their world.&quot; In the same way, Glass mentions the frequent role of marriage struggles in her work: &quot;Once again, Tyler exhibits her genius for the incisive, savory portrayal of marriage, of the countless perverse ways in which two individuals sustain a shared existence.&quot; McMurtry puts it this way, &quot;The fates of [Tyler&#x27;s] families hinge on long struggles between semiattentive males and semiobsessed females. In her patient investigation of such struggles, Miss Tyler has produced a very satisfying body of fiction.

=== Passage of time and the role of small, chance events ===

The role of the passage of time and its impact on Tyler&#x27;s characters is always present. The stories in many of her novels span decades, if only by flashbacks. Joyce Carol Oates emphasized the role of time in this manner: &quot;[Tyler&#x27;s novels] move at times as if plotless in the meandering drift of actual life, it is time itself that constitutes &quot;plot&quot;: meaning is revealed through a doubling-back upon time in flashes of accumulated memory, those heightened moments which James Joyce aptly called epiphanies. The minutiae of family life can yield a startling significance seen from the right perspective, as Tyler shows us.&quot; With regard to those minutiae, Tyler herself comments: &quot;As for huge events vs. small events: I believe they all count. They all reveal character, which is the factor that most concerns me ... It does fascinate me, though, that small details can be so meaningful.&quot;

Kakutani described &quot;Saint Maybe&quot; in a similar manner: &quot;Moving back and forth among the points of view of various characters, Ms. Tyler traces two decades in the lives of the Bedloes, showing us the large and small events that shape family members&#x27; lives and the almost imperceptible ways in which feelings of familial love and obligation mutate over the years.&quot; Again in her review of &quot;Breathing Lessons&quot;, Kakutani perceives that &quot;she is able, with her usual grace and magnanimity, to chronicle the ever-shifting covenants made by parents and children, husbands and wives, and in doing so, to depict both the losses – and redemptions – wrought by the passage of time.&quot;
Tyler herself further weighs in upon how small events can impact relationships: &quot;I love to think about chance -- about how one little overheard word, one pebble in a shoe, can change the universe ... The real heroes to me in my books are first the ones who manage to endure.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Tyler is not without her critics. The most common criticism is that her works are &quot;sentimental,&quot; &quot;sweet,&quot; and &quot;charming and cosy.&quot; John Blades, literary critic for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, skewered &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot; (as well as all her earlier novels) as &quot;artificially sweet&quot; and &quot;unrealistic.&quot; &quot;The Observer&quot;″s Adam Mars-Jones stated, in his review of &quot;The Amateur Marriage&quot;: &quot;Tyler seems to be offering milk and cookies.&quot; Kakutani has also occasionally bemoaned a &quot;cloying cuteness,&quot; noting that &quot;her novels—with their eccentric heroes, their homespun details, their improbable, often heartwarming plots—have often flirted with cuteness.&quot;

In a 2012 interview, Tyler responded to such criticisms: &quot;For one thing I think it is sort of true. I would say piss and vinegar for [Philip] Roth and for me milk and cookies. I can&#x27;t deny it ... [However] there&#x27;s more edge under some of my soft language than people realize.&quot; Because almost all of Tyler&#x27;s work covers the same territory—family and marriage relationships—and are located in the same setting, she has come under criticism for being repetitive and formulaic. Reviewing &quot;The Patchwork Planet&quot;, Kakutani states: &quot;Ms. Tyler&#x27;s earlier characters tended to be situated within a thick matrix of finely nuanced familial relationships that helped define both their dreams and their limitations; the people in this novel, in contrast, seem much more like lone wolves, pulled this way and that by the author&#x27;s puppet strings ... Ms. Tyler&#x27;s famous ability to limn the daily minutiae of life also feels weary and formulaic this time around ... As for the little details Ms. Tyler sprinkles over her story ... they, too, have a paint-by-numbers touch. They add up to a patchwork novel that feels hokey, mechanical ... and yes, too cute.

Tyler has also been criticized for her male characters&#x27; &quot;Sad Sack&quot; nature and their &quot;lack of testosterone.&quot; Tyler has disagreed with this criticism: &quot;Oh that always bothers me so much. I don&#x27;t think they are wimps. People are always saying we understand you write about quirky characters, and I think, isn&#x27;t everybody quirky? If you look very closely at anybody you&#x27;ll find impediments, women and men both.&quot;

== Work habits ==

Over the last couple of decades, Tyler has been quite forthcoming about her work habits—both in written articles and in interviews. She is very disciplined and consistent about her work schedule and environment. She starts work in the early morning and generally works until 2 pm. Since she moved to the Roland Park neighborhood of Baltimore, she has used a small, orderly corner room in her house, where the only distractions are the sounds of &quot;children playing outside and birds.&quot; She has noted that at the beginning of her day, taking the first step—that is, entering her corner room—can be difficult and daunting. She begins her writing by reviewing her previous days&#x27; work and then by sitting and staring off into space for a time. She describes this phase of writing as an &quot;extension of daydreaming,&quot; and it focuses on her characters.

Over the years Tyler has kept files of note cards in which ideas and observations have been recorded. Characters, descriptions, and scenes often emerge from these notes. She says the act of putting words to paper for her is a &quot;very mechanical process,&quot; involving a number of steps: (1) writing first in long hand on unlined paper, (2) revising long hand versions, (3) typing the entire manuscript, (4) re-writing in long hand, (5) reading into a tape-recorder while listening for &quot;false notes,&quot; (6) playing back into a stenographer&#x27;s machine using the pause button to enter changes. She can be quite organized, going so far as to map out floor plans of houses and to outline the chronology of all the characters in a given novel.

In 2013, Tyler gave the following advice to beginning writers: &quot;They should run out and buy the works of Erving Goffman, the sociologist who studied the meaning of gesture in personal interactions. I have cause to think about Erving Goffman nearly every day of my life, every time I see people do something unconscious that reveals more than they&#x27;ll ever know about their interiors. Aren&#x27;t human beings intriguing? I could go on writing about them forever.&quot;

<text>Josef Kajetán Tyl (4 February 180811 July 1856; ) was a significant Czech dramatist, writer, and actor. He was a notable figure in the Czech National Revival movement and is best known as the author of the current national anthem of the Czech Republic titled &quot;Kde domov můj?&quot;.

==Life==

Josef Kajetán Tyl was the first-born son of Jiří Tyl, a tailor and retired military band oboe player, and his wife Barbora née Králíková, daughter of a miller and groats maker. He was christened &quot;Josef František&quot;, yet this name was changed into Josef Kajetán when he underwent confirmation at the age of eleven. The family surname had several written forms – Tylly, Tylli, Tilly or Tyll – and was later changed to Tyl. Josef Kajetán had four younger siblings: one brother and three sisters, but except sister Anna none of them survived to adulthood.

After finishing elementary school, Josef Kajetán studied at a grammar school in Prague and in Hradec Králové. Among his teachers belonged the leading Czech linguist and writer Josef Jungmann and the playwright Václav Kliment Klicpera. After finishing his studies at the grammar school, he started to study philosophy in Prague.

Already as a student, Tyl started to be active in theatre and finally left school to become a member of the Hilmer traveling theatre company. When the company disbanded after two years of journeying around the countryside, he returned to Prague and got a job as a clerk in an infantry regiment&#x27;s office. In his free time, he wrote theatre plays and worked as an actor at the Estates Theatre. Due to his abilities, he could leave his job in the military in 1842, as he was given a full-time job at the Estates Theatre, where he became the director, organizer, and playwright of the Czech ensemble in the otherwise mainly German theatre.
In 1833 Tyl became a redactor of a renewed Czech magazine called &quot;Květy&quot; (Blossoms), which exists until today. He was also a redactor of the magazines &quot;Vlastimil&quot; and &quot;Pražský posel&quot; (Prague Messenger), and of the newspaper &quot;Sedlské noviny&quot; (Farmer´s newspaper), that were later banned because of his political involvement.

Tyl used several pen names that were often derived from the name of his hometown Kutná Hora, for example, Horský, Horník, Kutnohorský, and Vítek.

In the revolutionary year 1848, Tyl became politically active and was briefly a member of the Austrian parliament in Vienna. Because he fought for the independence of the Czech nation from Austria-Hungary, he was later marked as politically unreliable by the authorities and expelled from the Estates Theatre. He wanted to found his own traveling theatre company but his request was rejected, so in 1851 he joined an existing one and left for a tour, together with his family. Yet the theatre company did not fare well, and the Tyl family ended up in poverty. In 1856, during his theatre&#x27;s stay in Plzeň, the 48 years old Tyl died of an unknown illness and was buried at a local cemetery.

A theatre in Plzeň was later named in his honor Divadlo Josefa Kajetána Tyla.

==Work==
Tyl was an author of several novels and short stories, but he is most famous for his about 20 theatre plays, which can be divided into several groups.

=== Plays describing the life of the Czech society in Tyl&#x27;s time period ===
* &quot;Paličova dcera&quot; (Arsonist&#x27;s daughter)
* &quot;Pražský flamendr&quot; (Prague playboy)
* &quot;Bankrotář&quot; (Bankrupter)
* &quot;Chudý kejklíř&quot; (Poor Juggler)

===Plays portraying famous events from Czech history (especially the Hussite movement)===
* &quot;Jan Hus&quot;
* &quot;Žižka z Trocnova&quot; (Žižka of Trocnov)
* &quot;Krvavý soud aneb kutnohorští havíři&quot; (A Bloody Verdict: The Miners of Kutná Hora)
* &quot;Krvavé křtiny, aneb Drahomíra a její synové&quot; (Bloody Baptism, or Drahomír and Her Sons)

=== Plays featuring fairy tale characters (fairies, witches) ===
* &quot;Strakonický dudák&quot; (The Bagpiper of Strakonice) – one of his most famous works
* &quot;Lesní panna aneb cesta do Ameriky&quot; (The Forest Maiden: A Journey to America)
* &quot;Tvrdohlavá žena&quot; (The Stubborn Woman)
* &quot;Jiříkovo vidění&quot; (George&#x27;s Vision)
* &quot;Čert na zemi&quot; (Devil On Earth)

===Other plays===
* &quot;Paní Marjánka, matka pluku&quot; (Lady Marjánka, Mother of the Regiment)
* &quot;&quot; – a song from this play, named Kde domov můj, became the Czech national anthem in 1918
* &quot;Slepý mládenec&quot; (The Blind Young Man)

==Family==

Tyl&#x27;s wife was a Czech actress Magdalena Forchheimová (1803–1870), who performed under the pen name &quot;Skalná&quot;. Tyl met her in 1829 during his first tour with a traveling theatre company, where they both performed. They married on 28 January 1839, yet their marriage stayed childless, as after a stillbirth Magdalena couldn&#x27;t have any more children.

In 1841 Tyl fell in love with his wife&#x27;s much younger sister Anna, who was also a talented actress and performed under the pen name Anna Rajská (1824–1903). They started an affair, Tyl did not divorce or leave his wife however and all three of them lived together in one household until his death. Anna bore her brother-in-law eight illegitimate children, their youngest son was born one month after Tyl died. Their sons went by their mother&#x27;s surname Forchheim, daughters were allowed by the authorities to use father&#x27;s surname Tyl.

On 24 April 1861, five years after Tyl&#x27;s death, Anna married Tyl&#x27;s colleague, actor Josef Ladislav Turnovský, with whom she had three more children. Turnovský took care not only of Tyl&#x27;s family but also of his legacy by saving his manuscripts and publishing his works.

===Children of Josef Kajetán Tyl===

*Josef Otakar Forchheim (1843–1907), doctor of philosophy and gymnasium professor in Plzeň, buried in Prague at the Vyšehrad Cemetery
*Jan Stanislav Forchheim (1845–1890), turner and military band musician

<doc id="730274" wikidata="Q34152" url="?curid=730274" title="Shilha language">
<text>Shilha ( ; from its name in Moroccan Arabic, ), now more commonly known as Tashelhiyt, Tachelhit ( ; from the endonym , ), is a Berber language spoken in southwestern Morocco. When referring to the language, anthropologists and historians prefer the name &quot;Shilha&quot;, which is in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). Linguists writing in English prefer &quot;Tashelhit&quot; (or a variant spelling). In French sources the language is called , or .

Shilha is spoken in an area covering around 100,000 square kilometres. The area comprises the western part of the High Atlas mountains and the regions to the south up to the Draa River, including the Anti-Atlas and the alluvial basin of the Sous River. The largest urban centres in the area are the coastal city of Agadir (population over 400,000) and the towns of Guelmim, Taroudant, Oulad Teima, Tiznit and Ouarzazate.

In the north and to the south, Shilha borders Arabic-speaking areas. In the northeast, roughly along the line Demnate-Zagora, there is a dialect continuum with Central Atlas Tamazight. Within the Shilha-speaking area, there are several Arabic-speaking enclaves, notably the town of Taroudant and its surroundings. Substantial Shilha-speaking migrant communities are found in most of the larger towns and cities of northern Morocco and outside Morocco in Belgium, France, Germany, Canada, the United States and Israel.

Shilha possesses a distinct and substantial literary tradition that can be traced back several centuries before the protectorate era. Many texts, written in Arabic script and dating from the late 16th century to the present, are preserved in manuscripts. A modern printed literature in Shilha has developed since the 1970s.

== Name ==
Shilha speakers usually refer to their language as . This name is morphologically a feminine noun, derived from masculine &quot;male speaker of Shilha&quot;. Shilha names of other languages are formed in the same way, for example &quot;an Arab&quot;, &quot;the Arabic language&quot;.

The origin of the names and has recently become a subject of debate (see Shilha people#Naming for various theories). The presence of the consonant in the name suggests an originally exonymic (Arabic) origin. The first appearance of the name in a western printed source is found in Mármol&#x27;s (1573), which mentions the &quot;indigenous Africans called Xilohes or Berbers&quot; ().

The initial in is a Shilha nominal prefix (see ). The ending (borrowed from the Arabic suffix ) forms denominal nouns and adjectives. There are also variant forms and , with instead of under the influence of the preceding consonant . The plural of is ; a single female speaker is a (noun homonymous with the name of the language), plural .

In Moroccan colloquial Arabic, a male speaker is called a , plural , and the language is , a feminine derivation calqued on . The Moroccan Arabic names have been borrowed into English as &quot;a Shilh&quot;, &quot;the Shluh&quot;, and &quot;Shilha&quot;, and into French as , , and or, more commonly, .

The now-usual names and in their endonymic use seem to have gained the upper hand relatively recently, as they are attested only in those manuscript texts which date from the 19th and 20th centuries. In older texts, the language is still referred to as or &quot;Tamazight&quot;. For example, the author Awzal (early 18th c.) speaks of &quot;a composition in that beautiful Tamazight&quot;.

Because Souss is the most heavily populated part of the language area, the name (lit. &quot;language of Souss&quot;) is now often used as a pars pro toto for the entire language. A speaker of is an , plural , feminine , plural .

== Number of speakers ==

With 4.7 million speakers or 14% of Morocco&#x27;s population, Tachelhit is the most widely spoken Amazigh language in the Kingdom, ahead of Tamazight and Tarifit. Its speakers represent more than half of the 8.8 million Amazighophones.

It is also the Amazigh language that has the greatest geographical extension in the country. Its speakers are present in 1512 of the 1538 municipalities in the kingdom. This distribution is notably the result of a large diaspora of small traders who have settled throughout the country, but also of workers in search of employment opportunities.

Five Moroccan regions have a rate of Tachelhit speakers higher than the national average: Souss-Massa, Guelmim–Oued Noun, Marrakech–Safi and Drâa–Tafilalet and Dakhla–Oued Ed Dahab. They concentrate 79% of the speakers. However, only two of them have a majority of Tachelhito speakers: Souss–Massa with 66% of its population (1,765,417 speakers) and Guelmim–Oued Noun with 50% (218,650 speakers). This rate drops to 26% for Marrakech–Safi (1,185,846 speakers), 22% for Drâa–Tafilalet (359,936 speakers) and 18% in Dakhla–Oued Ed Dahab (25,198 speakers).

Like the high concentration of Tachelhit-speaking speakers in Dakhla, Tachelhit is spoken significantly by many inhabitants, in Moroccan municipalities outside the area where the language historically originated. With 49% of its speakers living in cities, Tachelhit has become highly urbanized. Thus, 10% of Casablancais speak Tachelhit, i.e. more than 334,000 people. Casablanca is therefore the first Tachelhit city in Morocco, ahead of Agadir (222,000 speakers). Similarly, 9.2% of Rbatis speak Tachelhit, i.e. more than 52,000 people, or 4% of Tangiers and Oujdis. Finally, there are singular cases of very outlying municipalities such as the fishing village of Imlili, south of Dakhla (60% of speakers) or the rural municipality of Moulay Ahmed Cherif, 60 km west of the city of Al Hoceima (54% speakers). These situations are reminiscent of the historical migrations that have followed one another over the long term and especially the massive rural exodus that began in the 20th century towards the economic metropolises.

Although many speakers of Shilha, especially men, are bilingual in Moroccan Arabic, there are as yet no indications that the survival of Shilha as a living language will be seriously threatened in the immediate future. Because of the rapid growth of the Moroccan population over the past decades (from 12 million in 1961 to over 33 million in 2014), it is safe to say that Shilha is now spoken by more people than ever before in history.

== Dialects ==
Dialect differentiation within Shilha, such as it is, has not been the subject of any targeted research, but several scholars have noted that all varieties of Shilha are mutually intelligible. The first was Stumme, who observed that all speakers can understand each other, &quot;because the individual dialects of their language are not very different.&quot; This was later confirmed by Ahmed Boukous, a Moroccan linguist and himself a native speaker of Shilha, who stated: &quot;Shilha is endowed with a profound unity which permits the Shluh to communicate without problem, from the Ihahan in the northwest to the Aït Baamran in the southwest, from the Achtouken in the west to the Iznagen in the east, and from Aqqa in the desert to Tassaout in the plain of Marrakesh.&quot;

There exists no sharply defined boundary between Shilha dialects and the dialects of Central Atlas Tamazight (CAT). The dividing line is generally put somewhere along the line Marrakesh-Zagora, with the speech of the Ighoujdamen, Iglioua and Aït Ouaouzguite ethnic groups belonging to Shilha, and that of the neighboring Inoultan, Infedouak and Imeghran ethnic groups counted as CAT.

== Writing systems ==
Though Tashelhit has historically been an oral language, manuscripts of mostly religious texts have been written in Tashelhit using the Arabic script since at least the 16th century. Today, Tashelhit is most commonly written in the Arabic script, although Neo-Tifinagh is also used.

== Literature ==
Shilha has an extensive body of oral literature in a wide variety of genres (fairy tales, animal stories, taleb stories, poems, riddles, and tongue-twisters). A large number of oral texts and ethnographic texts on customs and traditions have been recorded and published since the end of the 19th century, mainly by European linguists.

Shilha possesses an old literary tradition. Numerous texts written in Arabic script are preserved in manuscripts dating from the 16th century. The earliest datable text is a compendium of lectures on the &quot;religious sciences&quot; () composed in metrical verses by , who died in 1597. The best known writer in this tradition is Mḥmmd u Ɛli Awzal, author of &quot;The Cistern&quot; (a handbook of Maliki law in verse), &quot;The Ocean of Tears&quot; (an adhortation, with a description of Judgment Day, in verse) and other texts.

Modern Tashelhit literature has been developing since the end of the 20th century.

== Research ==
The first attempt at a grammatical description of Shilha is the work of the German linguist Hans Stumme (1864–1936), who in 1899 published his . Stumme&#x27;s grammar remained the richest source of grammatical information on Shilha for half a century. A problem with the work is its use of an over-elaborate, phonetic transcription which, while designed to be precise, generally fails to provide a transparent representation of spoken forms. Stumme also published a collection of Shilha fairy tales (1895, re-edited in Stroomer 2002).

The next author to grapple with Shilha is Saïd Cid Kaoui (Saʿīd al-Sidqāwī, 1859-1910), a native speaker of Kabyle from Algeria. Having published a dictionary of Tuareg (1894), he then turned his attention to the Berber languages of Morocco. His (1907) contains extensive vocabularies in both Shilha and Central Atlas Tamazight, in addition to some 20 pages of useful phrases. The work seems to have been put together in some haste and must be consulted with caution.

On the eve of the First World War there appeared a small, practical booklet composed by Captain (later Colonel) Léopold Justinard (1878–1959), entitled . It contains a short grammatical sketch, a collection of stories, poems and songs, and some interesting dialogues, all with translations. The work was written while the author was overseeing military operations in the region of Fès, shortly after the imposition of the French protectorate (1912). Justinard also wrote several works on the history of the Souss.

Emile Laoust (1876–1952), prolific author of books and articles about Berber languages, in 1921 published his (2nd enlarged edition 1936), a teaching grammar with graded lessons and thematic vocabularies, some good ethnographic texts (without translations) and a wordlist.

Edmond Destaing (1872–1940) greatly advanced knowledge of the Shilha lexicon with his (1920) and his (1940, with copious lexical notes). Destaing also planned a grammar which was to complete the trilogy, but this was never published.

Lieutenant-interpreter (later Commander) Robert Aspinion is the author of (1953), an informative though somewhat disorganized teaching grammar. Aspinion&#x27;s simple but accurate transcriptions did away with earlier phonetic and French-based systems.

The first attempted description in English is &quot;Outline of the Structure of Shilha&quot; (1958) by American linguist Joseph Applegate (1925–2003). Based on work with native speakers from Ifni, the work is written in a dense, inaccessible style, without a single clearly presented paradigm. Transcriptions, apart from being unconventional, are unreliable throughout.

The only available accessible grammatical sketch written in a modern linguistic frame is &quot;&quot; (1988) by Lionel Galand (1920–2017), a French linguist and berberologist. The sketch is mainly based on the speech of the Ighchan ethnic group of the Anti-Atlas, with comparative notes on Kabyle of Algeria and Tuareg of Niger.

More recent, book-length studies include Jouad (1995, on metrics), Dell &amp; Elmedlaoui (2002 and 2008, on syllables and metrics), El Mountassir (2009, a teaching grammar), Roettger (2017, on stress and intonation) and the many text editions by Stroomer (see also ).

== Phonology ==
=== Stress and intonation ===
There is currently no evidence of word stress in Tashlhiyt.

=== Vowels ===
Shilha has three phonemic vowels, with length not a distinctive feature. The vowels show a fairly wide range of allophones. The vowel /a/ is most often realized as [a] or [æ], and /u/ is pronounced without any noticeable rounding except when adjacent to . The presence of a pharyngealized consonant invites a more centralized realization of the vowel, as in &quot;three&quot;, &quot;four&quot;, &quot;six&quot; (compare &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;five&quot;).

Additional phonemic vowels occur sporadically in recent loanwords, for example as in &quot;restaurant&quot; (from French).

==== Transitional vowels and &quot;schwa&quot; ====
In addition to the three phonemic vowels, there are non-phonemic transitional vowels, often collectively referred to as &quot;schwa&quot;. Typically, a transitional vowel is audible following the onset of a vowelless syllable CC or CCC, if either of the flanking consonants, or both, are voiced, for example &quot;house&quot;, &quot;schoolboy&quot;. In the phonetic transcriptions of Stumme (1899) and Destaing (1920, 1940), many such transitional vowels are indicated.

Later authors such as Aspinion (1953), use the symbol to mark the place where a transitional vowel may be heard, irrespective of its quality, and they also write where in reality no vowel, however short, is heard, for example &quot;owner of livestock&quot;, &quot;he&#x27;s eating&quot;. The symbol , often referred to as &quot;schwa&quot;, as used by Aspinion and others, thus becomes a purely graphical device employed to indicate that the preceding consonant is a syllable onset: , . As Galand has observed, the notation of &quot;schwa&quot; in fact results from &quot;habits which are alien to Shilha&quot;. And, as conclusively shown by Ridouane (2008), transitional vowels or &quot;intrusive vocoids&quot; cannot even be accorded the status of epenthetic vowels. It is therefore preferable not to write transitional vowels or &quot;schwa&quot;, and to transcribe the vowels in a strictly phonemic manner, as in Galand (1988) and all recent text editions.

=== Consonants ===

The chart below represents Tashlhiyt consonants in IPA, with orthographical representations added between angled brackets when different:

Additional phonemic consonants occur sporadically in recent loanwords, for example as in &quot;(my) father&quot; (from Moroccan Arabic), and as in &quot;beach&quot; (from French).

Like other Berber languages and Arabic, Tashlhiyt has both pharyngealized (&quot;emphatic&quot;) and plain dental consonants. There is also a distinction between labialized and plain dorsal obstruents. Consonant gemination or length is contrastive.

==== Semivowels ====
The semivowels and have vocalic allophones and between consonants (C_C) and between consonant and pause (C_# and #_C). Similarly, the high vowels and can have consonantal allophones and in order to avoid a hiatus. In most dialects, the semivowels are thus in complementary distribution with the high vowels, with the semivowels occurring as onset or coda, and the high vowels as nucleus in a syllable. This surface distribution of the semivowels and the high vowels has tended to obscure their status as four distinct phonemes, with some linguists denying phonemic status to /w/ and /j/.

Positing four distinct phonemes is necessitated by the fact that semivowels and high vowels can occur in sequence, in lexically determined order, for example &quot;bee&quot;, &quot;ewe&quot; (not *, *). In addition, semivowels and , like other consonants, occur long, as in &quot;wrap&quot;, &quot;camel&#x27;s hump&quot;. The assumption of four phonemes also results in a more efficient description of morphology.

In the examples below, and are transcribed phonemically in some citation forms, but always phonetically in context, for example &quot;the daughters of&quot;, &quot;he has two daughters&quot;.

==== Gemination and length ====
Any consonant in Tashlhiyt, in any position within a word, may be simple or geminate. There may be up to two geminates in a stem, and up to three in a word.

The role of gemination varies:

Gemination also may occur due to phonological assimilation. For example, the following phrase would be realized as [babllfirma]:

Some consonants are realized differently during morphological gemination; as , as , as , and as .

=== Syllable structure ===
Shilha syllable structure has been the subject of a detailed and highly technical discussion by phoneticians. The issue was whether Shilha does or does not have vowelless syllables. According to John Coleman, syllables which are vowelless on the phonemic level have &quot;schwa&quot; serving as vocalic nucleus on the phonetic level. According to Rachid Ridouane on the other hand, Shilha&#x27;s apparently vowelless syllables are truly vowelless, with all phonemes, vowels as well as consonants, capable of serving as nucleus. The discussion is summed up in Ridouane (2008, with listing of relevant publications), where he conclusively demonstrates that a perfectly ordinary Shilha phrase such as &quot;you took it away&quot; indeed consists of three vowelless syllables [tk.ks.tst:.], each made up of voiceless consonants only, and with voiceless consonants (not &quot;schwa&quot;) serving as nucleus. Many definitions of the syllable that have been put forward do not cover the syllables of Shilha.

==== Syllable types ====
The syllable structure of Shilha was first investigated by Dell and Elmedlaoui in a seminal article (1985). They describe how syllable boundaries can be established through what they call &quot;core syllabification&quot;. This works by associating a nucleus with an onset, to form a core syllable CV or CC. Segments that are higher on the sonority scale have precedence over those lower on the scale in forming the nucleus in a core syllable, with vowels and semivowels highest on the scale, followed by liquids and nasals, voiced fricatives, voiceless fricatives, voiced stops and voiceless stops. When no more segments are available as onsets, the remaining single consonants are assigned as coda to the preceding core syllable, but if a remaining consonant is identical to the consonant that is the onset of the following syllable, it merges with it to become a long consonant. A morpheme boundary does not necessarily constitute a syllable boundary.

Comparative diagram of the following:
Application of core syllabification produces the following Shilha syllable types:

Shilha syllable structure can be represented succinctly by the formula , in which C is any consonant (single/long), and X is any vowel or consonant (single) and with the restriction that in a syllable CXC the X, if it is a consonant, cannot be higher on the resonance scale than the syllable-final consonant, that is, syllables such as [tsk.] and [wrz.] are possible, but not *[tks.] and *[wzr.].

Exceptional syllables of the types X (vowel or single/long consonant) and (vowel plus single/long consonant) occur in utterance-initial position:
: [r.glt.] &quot;close it!&quot; (syllable C)
: [f:.ɣat.] &quot;go out!&quot; (syllable C:)
: [a.wi.tid.] &quot;bring it here!&quot; (syllable V)
: [ac.kid.] &quot;come here!&quot; (syllable VC)
Another exceptional syllable type, described by Dell and Elmedlaoui (1985), occurs in utterance-final position, when a syllable of the type CC or CC: is &quot;annexed&quot; to a preceding syllable of the type CV or C:V, for example &quot;be silent!&quot; is [fs.samt.] not *[fs.sa.mt.].

Since any syllable type may precede or follow any other type, and since any consonant can occur in syllable-initial or final position, there are no phonotactical restrictions on consonant sequences. This also means that the concept of the consonant cluster is not applicable in Shilha phonology, as any number of consonants may occur in sequence:

:[fr.ḥɣs.lm.ɛrf.tn.nk.] (6 syllables, 14 consonants, no vowels)

==== Metrics ====
The metrics of traditional Shilha poems, as composed and recited by itinerant bards (), was first described and analyzed by Hassan Jouad (thesis 1983, book 1995; see also Dell and Elmedlaoui 2008). The traditional metrical system confirms the existence of vowelless syllables in Shilha, and Jouad&#x27;s data have been used by Dell and Elmedlaoui, and by Ridouane to support their conclusions.

The metrical system imposes the following restrictions:
*each line in a poem contains the same number of syllables as all the other lines
*each syllable in a line contains the same number of segments as its counterpart in other lines
*each line contains one particular syllable that must begin or end with a voiced consonant
*each line is divided into feet, with the last syllable in each foot stressed (&quot;lifted&quot;) in recitation
Within these restrictions, the poet is free to devise his own metrical form. This can be recorded in a meaningless formula called which shows the number and the length of the syllables, as well as the place of the obligatory voiced consonant (Jouad lists hundreds of such formulae).

The system is illustrated here with a quatrain ascribed to the semi-legendary Shilha poet Sidi Ḥammu (fl. 18th century) and published by Amarir (1987:64):

Application of Dell and Elmedlaoui&#x27;s core syllabification reveals a regular mosaic of syllables:

The poem is composed in a metre listed by Jouad (1995:283) and exemplified by the formula , , , (the in the last syllable indicates the position of the compulsory voiced consonant).

== Grammar ==
=== Nouns ===
On the basis of their morphology, three types of Shilha nouns can be distinguished, two indigenous types and one type of external origin:
*inflected nouns
*uninflected nouns
*unincorporated loans
The relevant morpho-syntactic categories are gender, number and state.

==== Inflected nouns ====
Inflected nouns are by far the most numerous type. These nouns can be easily recognised from their outward shape: they begin with a nominal prefix which has the form :
: &quot;daytime&quot;
: &quot;orphan&quot;
: &quot;hound&quot;
: &quot;evening&quot;
: &quot;marsh mallow (plant)&quot;
: &quot;ant&quot;
Inflected nouns distinguish two genders, masculine and feminine; two numbers, singular and plural; and two states, conventionally referred to by their French names as (&quot;free state&quot;) and (&quot;annexed state&quot;) and glossed as EL and EA. Gender and number are all explicitly marked, but historical and synchronic sound changes have in some cases resulted in the neutralization of the difference between EL and EA.

The nominal prefix has no semantic content, i.e. it is not a sort of (in)definite article, although it is probably demonstrative in origin. It is made up of one or both of two elements, a gender prefix and a vocalic prefix. Singular feminine nouns may also have a gender suffix. For example, the noun &quot;bee&quot; has the feminine prefix , the vocalic prefix and the feminine singular suffix added to the nominal stem . While feminine inflected nouns always have the feminine prefix, masculine nouns do not have a gender prefix in the free state (EL); for example &quot;fox&quot; has no gender prefix, but only a vocalic prefix added to the nominal stem .

Gender is thus marked unambiguously, albeit asymmetrically. In just a handful of nouns, the morphological gender does not conform to the grammatical gender (and number): &quot;sheep and goats&quot; is morphologically masculine singular, but takes feminine plural agreement; &quot;eyes&quot; is morphologically masculine plural, but takes feminine plural agreement; &quot;(someone&#x27;s) children, offspring&quot; is morphologically feminine singular, but takes masculine plural agreement.

The annexed state (EA) is regularly formed by reducing the vocalic prefix to zero and, with masculine nouns, adding the masculine gender prefix : 
:EL &quot;bee&quot; → EA 
:EL &quot;fox&quot; → EA 
With some nouns, the original vocalic prefix has fused with a stem-initial vowel, to produce an inseparable (and irreducible) vowel:
:EL &quot;moon, month&quot; → EA (not *)
:EL &quot;sun&quot; → EA (not *)
With feminine nouns that have an inseparable vocalic prefix, the difference between EL and EA is thus neutralized.

While most inflected nouns have a vocalic prefix , some have (in some cases inseparable), and a few have (always inseparable). When a masculine noun has the vocalic prefix (separable or inseparable), the masculine gender prefix changes to . The table below presents an overview (all examples are singular; plurals also distinguish EL and EA):

The EA is not predictable from the shape of the noun, compare:
: &quot;hand&quot; → EA 
: &quot;knee&quot; → EA 
The phonological rules on the realization of /w/ and /j/ apply to the EA as well. For example, the EA of &quot;chief&quot; is /w-mɣar/, realized as after a vowel, after a consonant:
: &quot;the chief went to see the judge&quot;
: &quot;the chief accompanied the judge&quot;
Inflected nouns show a great variety of plural formations, applying one or more of the following processes:
*suffixation (masculine , feminine )
*vowel change (insertion or elision, or ablaut)
*consonant gemination or degemination
*stem extension (+, +, +, +, always in combination with a suffix)
There are also irregular and suppletive plurals. The feminine singular suffix is naturally lost in the plural.

Independent from these processes, the separable vocalic prefix is always replaced with . An inseparable vocalic prefix either remains unchanged, or changes as part of vowel change (but if the vocalic prefix is inseparable in the singular, it may be separable in the plural, as with &quot;dune&quot;, and vice versa, as with &quot;dog&quot;; see table below).

Below is a sample of nouns, illustrating various plural formations.

The plural is generally not predictable from the shape of the singular, compare:
: &quot;shoe&quot;, plural (vowel change and suffix)
: &quot;utensil&quot;, plural (stem extension and suffix)
Many nouns have more than one plural, for example &quot;knife&quot;, plural (vowel change) or (suffixation).

Many Shilha place-names are morphologically inflected nouns:
: &quot;Anammeur&quot;
: &quot; Irhoreïsene&quot;
: &quot;Taroudant&quot;
: &quot;Tizegzaouine&quot;
The same is the case with Shilha ethnic names:
: &quot;the Ammeln&quot; (singular )
: &quot;the Achtouken&quot; (singular )
: &quot;the Ilallen&quot; (singular )
: &quot;the Isouktan&quot; (singular )
Among the inflected nouns are found many incorporated loans. Examples include:
: &quot;wax&quot; (from Latin)
: &quot;reeds&quot; (from Punic)
: &quot;vegetable plot, orchard&quot; (from early Romance)
: &quot;Muslim&quot; (from Arabic)
: &quot;letter, missive&quot; (from Arabic)

==== Uninflected nouns ====
This is the least common type, which also includes some loans. Examples:
: &quot;cuckoo&quot;
: &quot;thirst&quot;
: &quot;thumb&quot;
: &quot;tar&quot; (from Arabic)
: &quot;station&quot; (from French)
: &quot;index finger&quot;
: &quot;couscous&quot;
: &quot;cricket&quot;
: &quot;carrots&quot;

It is probable that all uninflected nouns were originally masculine. The few that now take feminine agreement contain elements that have been reanalyzed as marking feminine gender, for example &quot;kind of spider&quot; (initial seen as feminine prefix), &quot;bat&quot; (not an Arabic loanword, but final analyzed as the Arabic feminine ending).

Many uninflected nouns are collectives or non-count nouns which do not have a separate plural form. Those that have a plural make it by preposing the pluralizer , for example &quot;stations&quot;.

The uninflected noun or &quot;people, humans&quot; is morphologically masculine singular but takes masculine plural agreement.

Names of people and foreign place-names can be seen as a subtype of uninflected nouns, for example (man&#x27;s name), (woman&#x27;s name), &quot;Fès&quot;, &quot;Portugal&quot;. Gender is not transparently marked on these names, but those referring to humans take gender agreement according to the natural sex of the referent (male/masculine, female/feminine).

==== Unincorporated loans ====
These are nouns of Arabic origin (including loans from French and Spanish through Arabic) which have largely retained their Arabic morphology. They distinguish two genders (not always unambiguously marked) and two numbers (explicitly marked). A notable feature of these nouns is that they are borrowed with the Arabic definite article, which is semantically neutralized in Shilha:
:Moroccan Arabic &quot;the pistol&quot; → Shilha &quot;the pistol, a pistol&quot;
:Moroccan Arabic &quot;the coffin&quot; → Shilha &quot;the coffin, a coffin&quot;
The Arabic feminine ending is often replaced with the Shilha feminine singular suffix :
:Moroccan Arabic → Shilha &quot;fruit&quot;
:Moroccan Arabic → Shilha &quot;tomb of a saint&quot;
Arabic loans usually retain their gender in Shilha. The exception are Arabic masculine nouns which end in ; these change their gender to feminine in Shilha, with the final reanalyzed as the Shilha feminine singular suffix :
:Moroccan Arabic &quot;the prophetic tradition&quot; (masculine) → Shilha (feminine)
:Moroccan Arabic &quot;death&quot; (masculine) → Shilha (feminine)
Arabic plurals are usually borrowed with the singulars. If the borrowed plural is not explicitly marked for gender (according to Arabic morphology) it has the same gender as the singular:
: &quot;domestic animal&quot; (feminine), plural (feminine)
: &quot;buckle&quot; (masculine), plural (masculine)
Loanwords whose singular is masculine may have a plural which is feminine, and marked as such (according to Arabic morphology), for example &quot;flag&quot; (masculine), plural (feminine).

==== Use of the annexed state ====
The annexed state (EA) of an inflected noun is used in a number of clearly defined syntactical contexts:
*when the noun occurs as subject in postverbal position:


*after most prepositions (see also ):


*after numerals 1 to 10 and after the indefinite numeral (see also ):


*after some elements which require a following noun phrase (see also ):
: &quot;the people of Agadir&quot;
: &quot;he with EA-reed: flute player&quot; (EL )
*after &quot;like, such as&quot; (premodern, obsolete in the modern language)

Outside these contexts, the EL is used. Uninflected nouns and unincorporated loans, which do not distinguish state, remain unchanged in these contexts.

==== Semantics of feminine nouns ====
The formation of feminine nouns from masculine nouns is a productive process. A feminine noun is formed by adding both the feminine nominal prefix (and, if necessary, a vocalic prefix), and the feminine singular suffix to a masculine noun. The semantic value of the feminine derivation is variable.

For many nouns referring to male and female humans or animals (mainly larger mammals), matching masculine and feminine forms exist with the same nominal stem, reflecting the sex of the referent:
: &quot;widower&quot; → &quot;widow&quot;
: &quot;Muslim&quot; → &quot;Muslima&quot;
: &quot;twin boy&quot; → &quot;twin girl&quot;
: &quot;cock, rooster&quot; → &quot;hen&quot;
: &quot;lion&quot; → &quot;lioness&quot;
: &quot;moufflon&quot; → &quot;female moufflon&quot;
In a few cases there are suppletive forms:
: &quot;man, husband&quot; ― &quot;woman, wife&quot;
: &quot;buck&quot; ― &quot;goat&quot;
Feminine nouns derived from masculine nouns with inanimate reference have diminutive meaning:
: &quot;stone&quot; → &quot;small stone&quot;
: &quot;cave&quot; → &quot;hole, lair&quot;
: &quot;room&quot; → &quot;small room&quot;
: &quot;box&quot; → &quot;little box&quot;
: &quot;garden&quot; → &quot;small garden&quot;
Conversely, a masculine noun derived from a feminine noun has augmentative meaning:
: &quot;lake&quot; → &quot;large lake&quot;
: &quot;house&quot; → &quot;large house&quot;
: &quot;fan palm&quot; → &quot;large fan palm&quot;
Feminine nouns derived from masculine collective nouns have singulative meaning:
: &quot;maize&quot; → &quot;a cob&quot;
: &quot;peppers&quot; → &quot;a pepper&quot;
: &quot;aubergines&quot; → &quot;an aubergine&quot;
: &quot;matches&quot; → &quot;a match&quot;
Feminine derivations are also used as names of languages, professions and activities:
: &quot;Dutchman&quot; → &quot;the Dutch language&quot;
: &quot;the French&quot; → &quot;the French language&quot;
: &quot;blacksmith&quot; → &quot;blacksmith&#x27;s profession&quot;
: &quot;beggar&quot; → &quot;begging&quot;
: &quot;miser&quot; → &quot;avarice&quot;
: &quot;(my) brother&quot; → &quot;brotherhood&quot;
There is an overlap here with feminine nouns denoting females:
: &quot;Frenchwoman&quot; and &quot;the French language&quot;
: &quot;beggarwoman&quot; and &quot;begging&quot;

==== Nominal deictic clitics ====
There are three deictic clitics which can follow a noun: proximal &quot;this, these&quot;, distal &quot;that, those&quot; (compare ) and anaphoric &quot;the aforementioned&quot;:
: &quot;[as for] this honey, it is not expensive&quot;
: &quot;the cold has badly afflicted that goat&quot;
: &quot;then he gave the bird to some children to play with&quot;

===Personal pronouns===
There are three basic sets of personal pronouns:
*independent
*direct object clitics
*suffixes
In addition, there are two derived sets which contain the suffixed pronouns (except in 1st singular):
*indirect object clitics
*possessive complements
Gender is consistently marked on 2nd singular, and on 2nd and 3rd plural. Gender is not consistently marked on 3rd singular and 1st plural. Gender is never marked on 1st singular.

The independent (&quot;overt&quot;) pronouns are used to topicalize the subject or the object.


They are also used with certain pseudo-prepositions such as &quot;like&quot;, &quot;except&quot;:


The direct object clitics are used with transitive verbs:


The 3rd singular feminine variant is used after a dental stop, compare:
: &quot;bring her here!&quot; (imperative singular)
: &quot;bring her here!&quot; (imperative plural masculine)
The direct object clitics are also used to indicate the &quot;subject&quot; with pseudo-verbs, and with the presentative particle &quot;here is, &quot;:
: (alone me) &quot;I alone&quot;
: (all them) &quot;they all, all of them&quot;
: (absent him) &quot;he&#x27;s not there, he&#x27;s disappeared&quot;
: (where her) &quot;where is she?&quot;
: (here.is me) &quot;here I am&quot;
The pronominal suffixes are used with prepositions to indicate the object (see ), and with a closed set of necessarily possessed kinship terms to indicate possession (see ). The plural forms add an infix before the suffix with kinship terms, for example &quot;our father&quot; (never *); this infix also occurs with some prepositions as a free or dialectal variant of the form without the :
: or &quot;on them&quot;
: &quot;with them&quot; (never *)

The indirect object clitics convey both benefactive and detrimental meaning:


The possessive complements follow the noun (see ).

=== Prepositions ===
Prepositions can have up to three different forms, depending on the context in which they are used:
*before a noun or demonstrative pronoun
*with a pronominal suffix
*independent in relative clause
The form before nouns and demonstrative pronouns and the independent form are identical for most prepositions, the exception being the dative preposition (independent , ).

Most prepositions require a following inflected noun to be in the annexed state (EA) (see ). Exceptions are &quot;until&quot;, &quot;toward&quot; (in some modern dialects, and in premodern texts) and prepositions borrowed from Arabic (not in the table) such as &quot;after&quot; and &quot;before&quot;.

The instrumental and allative prepositions &quot;by means of&quot; (with EA) and &quot;toward&quot; (with EL) were still consistently kept apart in premodern manuscript texts. In most modern dialects they have been amalgamated, with both now requiring the EA, and with the pre-pronominal forms each occurring with both meanings: &quot;toward it&quot; (now also &quot;with it&quot;), &quot;with it&quot; (now also &quot;toward it&quot;).

The use of the different forms is illustrated here with the preposition &quot;in&quot;:

Two prepositions can be combined:


Spatial relations are also expressed with phrases of the type &quot;on top of&quot;:
: &quot;on top of the dung heap&quot;
: &quot;beside the road&quot;
: &quot;in the midst of the river&quot;
The preposition &quot;in&quot; with pronominal suffixes, with all its free and dialectal variants, is presented below. The other prepositions display a much smaller variety of forms.

=== Numerals ===
The inherited cardinal numeral system consists of ten numerals (still in active use) and three numeral nouns (now obsolete) for &quot;a tensome&quot;, &quot;a hundred&quot; and &quot;a thousand&quot;. There is also an indefinite numeral meaning &quot;several, many&quot; or &quot;how many?&quot; which morphologically and syntactically patterns with the numerals 1 to 10. For numbers of 20 and over, Arabic numerals are commonly used.

==== Numerals 1 to 10, indefinite numeral ====
These are listed below. The formation of feminine &quot;one&quot; and &quot;two&quot; is irregular.

The numerals 1 to 10 are constructed with nouns (inflected nouns in the EA), the gender of the numeral agreeing with that of the noun:



The same obtains with the indefinite numeral:
: &quot;several/many EA-horses, how many horses?&quot;
: &quot;several/many EA-cows, how many cows?&quot;
Numerals , &quot;one&quot; also serve as indefinite article, for example &quot;one Westerner, a Westerner&quot;, and they are used independently with the meaning &quot;anyone&quot; (), &quot;anything&quot; ():
: &quot;he didn&#x27;t see anyone&quot;
: &quot;I&#x27;m not afraid of anything&quot;
The final of masculine &quot;one&quot; and &quot;two&quot; is often assimilated or fused to a following , or :
: → &quot;one EA-day&quot;
: → &quot;one EA-year&quot;
: → &quot;a place&quot;
: → &quot;two EA-years&quot;
: → &quot;two EA-months&quot;

==== Teens ====
The teens are made by connecting the numerals 1 to 9 to the numeral 10 with the preposition &quot;with&quot;. In the premodern language, both numerals took the gender of the counted noun, with the following noun in the plural (EA):


In the modern language, fused forms have developed in which the first numeral is always masculine, while the following noun is in the singular, and connected with the preposition &quot;of&quot;:


==== Tens, hundreds, thousands ====
There are three inherited nouns to denote &quot;a tensome&quot;, &quot;a hundred&quot; and &quot;a thousand&quot;. These now seem to be obsolete, but they are well attested in the premodern manuscripts. Morphologically, they are ordinary inflected nouns.

The tens, hundreds and thousand were formed by combining the numerals 1 to 10 with the numeral nouns:




The numeral nouns are connected with the preposition &quot;of&quot; to a noun, which is most often in the singular:




In the modern language the Arabic tens are used, which have developed a separate feminine form:



The numerals between the tens are most frequently made with the Arabic numerals 1 to 10:


The Arabic hundreds and thousands are used in the modern language, taking the places of the original numeral nouns while the original syntax is maintained:




There is also a vigesimal system built on the Arabic numeral &quot;twenty, score&quot;, for example:

==== Ordinal numerals ====
&quot;First&quot; and &quot;last&quot; are usually expressed with relative forms of the verbs &quot;to be first&quot; and &quot;to be last&quot;:


There are also agent nouns derived from these verbs which are apposed to a noun or used independently:


The other ordinals are formed by prefixing masc. , fem. to a cardinal numeral, which is then constructed with a plural noun in the usual manner:


The ordinal prefixes is also used with Arabic numerals and with the indefinite numeral:
: &quot;the 25th [day] of [the month] Dhū al-Qaʿda&quot;
: &quot;the how-manieth time?&quot;

Because four of the numerals 1 to 10 begin with , the geminated that results from the prefixation of , (as in , , etc.) is often generalized to the other numerals: , , , etc.

=== Verbs ===
A Shilha verb form is basically a combination of a person-number-gender (PNG) affix and a mood-aspect-negation (MAN) stem.

==== Sample verb ====
The workings of this system are illustrated here with the full conjugation of the verb &quot;to give&quot;. The perfective negative goes with the negation &quot;not&quot;. The imperfective goes with the preverbal particle (except usually the imperative, and the relative forms).

The verb &quot;give&quot; has the full complement of four different MAN stems:
*Aorist ― in 1st, 2nd and 3rd singular, 1st plural, and the imperatives, but in 2nd and 3rd plural
*Perfective ― in 1st and 2nd singular, but with the other forms
*Perfective negative ― all forms
*Imperfective (an irregular formation) ― all forms

==== Person-number-gender affixes ====
There are two basic sets of PNG affixes, one set marking the subject of ordinary verb forms, and another set marking the subject of imperatives.

Two suffixes (singular , plural ) are added to the 3rd singular and masculine 3rd plural masculine verb forms respectively to make relative forms (also known as &quot;participles&quot;), as in &quot;who gives&quot;, &quot;who give&quot;.

==== Mood-aspect-negation stems ====
A few verbs have just one MAN stem. The majority of verbs have two, three or four different MAN stems. The Aorist stem serves as the citation form of a verb. The list below offers an overview of MAN stem paradigms. Around 15 paradigms of non-derived verbs can be recognized, based on the formation of the Perfective and the Perfective negative. Further subdivisions could be made on the basis of the formations of the Imperfective. All sections in the list contain a selection of verbs, except sections 12, 14, and 15, which contain a full listing.

==== Uses of MAN stems ====
The table below is adapted from Kossmann (2012:40, table 2.12 Uses of MAN stems in Figuig Berber).

==== Stative verbs ====
Shilha has around twenty stative verbs which are still recognizable as a separate type of verb on the basis of their MAN stem paradigms. In earlier stages of the language, these verbs had their own separate set of PNG markers, which are sporadically found in premodern manuscripts:
: &quot;the night, it is long&quot; (cf. modern )
: &quot;medicines are bitter&quot; (cf. modern )
In the modern language, these verbs take the regular PNG markers. Only the original singular relative form without prefix may still be encountered, for example or (mountain which.is.big) &quot;big mountain&quot;. Stative verbs do not have a separate Perfective negative form. The table shows a selection of stative verbs.

====Verbal deictic clitics====
There are two deictic clitics which are used with verbs to indicate movement toward or away from the point of reference: centripetal &quot;hither&quot; and centrifugal &quot;thither&quot;:

The use of these clitics is compulsory (idiomatic) with certain verbs. For example, the verb &quot;come&quot; almost always goes with the centripetal particle, and &quot;find&quot; with the centrifugal clitic:

When the verbal deictic clitics occur after an object pronoun, they change to and :

=== Possession ===
==== Within a noun phrase ====
A possessive construction within a noun phrase is most frequently expressed as Possessee Possessor. The preposition &quot;of&quot; requires a following inflected noun to be in the annexed state. This kind of possessive construction covers a wide range of relationships, including both alienable and inalienable possession, and most of them not involving actual ownership:
: &quot;Daoud&#x27;s waterhole&quot;
: &quot;the entrance of the grain silo&quot;
: &quot;Brahim&#x27;s children&quot;
: &quot;pots of clay&quot;
: &quot;a little salt&quot;
: &quot;the price of maize&quot;
: &quot;after lunch&quot;
: &quot;the city of Istanbul&quot;
: &quot;the rising of the sun&quot;
: &quot;the road to school&quot;
: &quot;the religion of the Jews&quot;
: &quot;the story of Joseph&quot;
Many such possessive constructions are compounds, whose meaning cannot be deduced from the ordinary meaning of the nouns:
: &quot;road of straw: the Milky Way&quot;
: &quot;mouth of jackal: a length measure&quot;
: &quot;ravine of lice: nape, back of the neck&quot;
: &quot;needle of hedges: kind of bird&quot;
The possessor can itself be a possessee in a following possessive construction:
: &quot;the era of the reign of Moulay Lahcen&quot;
: &quot;the time of the giving birth of the sheep and goats&quot;
As a rule, the preposition assimilates to, or fuses with, a following , , or :
: → &quot;the language of the Arabs&quot;
: → &quot;horse-doctor&quot;
: → &quot;the season of rain&quot;
: → &quot;the king of the Muslims&quot;
: → &quot;orange tree&quot;
: → &quot;maize of Egypt&quot;
The possessor can also be expressed with a pronominal possessive complement. This consists of a pronominal suffix added to the preposition, which then takes the shape (see ). The form of the 1st singular possessive complement is anomalous: after a vowel, and after a consonant (or, in some dialects, ):
: &quot;my head&quot;
: &quot;my hands&quot;
: &quot;my leg&quot;
: &quot;your (sg.m.) pouch&quot;
: &quot;your (sg.f.) affairs&quot;
: &quot;his clothes&quot;
: &quot;her opinion&quot;
: &quot;its smell&quot;
: &quot;our neighbours&quot;
: &quot;your (pl.m.) occupation&quot;
: &quot;your (pl.f.) friends&quot;
: &quot;their (m.) livelihood&quot;
: &quot;their (f.) locks of hair&quot;

==== Within a clause ====
There are two ways to express possession within a clause. The most common way is to use the &quot;exist with&quot; construction:

The verb &quot;exist&quot; (perfective ) is usually omitted, leaving a verbless clause:

Alternatively, the verb &quot;hold, possess&quot; can be used:

In addition, there is the verb &quot;possess&quot; (perfective ), whose use is restricted to (inalienable) part-whole relationships and kinship relationships:

In al its usages can be replaced with or the &quot;exist with&quot; construction, but not the other way around:


==== Possessed nouns ====
These are a subtype of uninflected nouns. As with proper names, gender is not transparently marked on possessed nouns, which take gender agreement according to the natural sex of the referent. Plurals are either suppletive or made with the preposed pluralizer . Most possessed nouns are consanguinal kinship terms which require a possessive suffix (the table contains a selection).

These kinship terms cannot occur without pronominal suffix. Example:

If these nouns are part of an NP-internal possessive construction, possession must be indicated twice:

The suffix must also be added when possession is expressed in a clause:

Some kinship terms are not possessed nouns but inflected nouns which take possessive complements (see examples above).

Another group of possessed nouns require a following noun phrase, occurring only in an NP-internal possessive phrase. A following inflected noun must be in the EA.

These four possessed nouns occur as first element in compound kinship terms (see above; then becomes in &quot;the brother of&quot;). They also serve to indicate descent, origin and ethnicity:
: &quot;Ahmed son of Moussa&quot; (name of a famous saint)
: &quot;member of the Aït Brayyim ethnic group&quot;
: &quot;native of outside: a foreigner&quot;
: &quot;a native of Taroudant&quot;
: &quot;the natives of Aguercif&quot;
: &quot;native woman of Aglou&quot;
: &quot;the women of Tafraout&quot;
When is followed by another (phonemic) the result is :
: → &quot;native of Ouijjane&quot; (also surname: Gouijjane)
: → &quot;a man, son of a man: a man of virtue&quot;
 occurs in many Shilha ethnonyms:
: &quot;the Sons of Boubker&quot; (Aït Boubker), singular 
: &quot;the Sons of Ouafka&quot; (Aït Ouafka), singular → 

==== Proprietive and privative elements ====
The proprietive elements masc. &quot;he with, he of&quot; and fem. &quot;she with, she of&quot; are borrowed from Arabic (original meaning &quot;father of&quot;, &quot;mother of&quot;). They are used as formative elements and require a following inflected noun to be in the annexed state. The plural is formed with the pluralizer :




In many cases, fuses with a following nominal prefix:


The feminine is encountered less frequently:

The privative elements masc. &quot;he without&quot; and fem. &quot;she without&quot; are made up of a gender prefix (masculine , feminine ) and an element which is probably related to the negation &quot;not&quot;. They do not require the annexed state, and should probably be translated as &quot;who does not have&quot;, with the following noun phrase as object:




== Lexicon ==

Tashlhiyt, like other Berber languages, has a small number of loanwords from Phoenician-Punic, Hebrew, and Aramaic. There are also Latin loans from the time of the Roman empire, although the region in which Tashlhiyt is spoken was never in the empire&#x27;s territory.

Most Tashlhiyt loanwords are Arabic in origin. Maarten Kossmann estimates that about 6% of the basic Tashlhiyt lexicon is borrowed from Arabic; Salem Chaker estimates that 25% of the stable lexicon overall is borrowed from Arabic.

Although some nouns denoting typically Islamic concepts such as &quot;mosque&quot;, &quot;ritual prayer&quot;, &quot;fasting&quot;, which certainly belong to the very oldest layer of Arabic loans, are fully incorporated into Shilha morphology, many equally central Islamic concepts are expressed with unincorporated nouns, for example &quot;Islam&quot;, &quot;pilgrimage to Mecca&quot;, &quot;alms tax&quot;. It is possible that during the early stages of islamization such concepts were expressed with native vocabulary or with earlier, non-Arabic loans. One such term which has survived into the modern era is &quot;ewe for slaughter on the (Islamic) Feast of Immolation&quot;, from , the Latinized name of the Jewish festival of Passover (&quot;Pesaḥ&quot;) or, more specifically, of the paschal lamb (&quot;qorbān Pesaḥ&quot;) which is sacrificed during the festival. Another example is &quot;sins&quot;, obsolete in the modern language, but attested in a premodern manuscript text, whose singular is borrowed from Romance (cf. Spanish , Latin ; modern Shilha uses &quot;sins&quot;, from Arabic).

Tashlhiyt numerals 5 to 9 may be loanwords, although their origin is unclear; they do not seem to originate from Phoenician-Punic or Arabic. Additionally, all Tashlhiyt numerals agree in gender, whereas Arabic numerals do not.

== Secret languages ==
Destaing mentions a secret language (argot) called or which is spoken by &quot;some people of Souss, in particular the descendants of Sidi Ḥmad u Musa.&quot; He quotes an example: &quot;do you speak the secret language?&quot;

Two secret languages used by Shilha women are described by Lahrouchi and Ségéral. They are called (cf. Shilha &quot;deaf-mute person&quot;) and or . They employ various processes, such as reduplication, to disguise the ordinary language.

<text>Nathan Farragut Twining ( ; October 11, 1897 – March 29, 1982) was a United States Air Force general. He was the chief of Staff of the United States Air Force from 1953 until 1957, and the third chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1957 to 1960. He was the first member of the Air Force to serve as Chairman. Twining was a distinguished &quot;mustang&quot; officer, rising from private to four-star general and appointment to the highest post in the United States Armed Forces in the course of his 45-year career.

==Early life and military career==
Twining was the son of Clarence Walker Twining and Maize (Barber) Twining. His family had a strong military background; his brother Merrill B. Twining was a general in the United States Marine Corps, his brother Robert B. Twining attained the rank of captain in the United States Navy, and his uncle Nathan Crook Twining was a rear admiral in the Navy. Twining&#x27;s stepmother, Frances Staver Twining, was the author of &quot;Bird-Watching in the West&quot;.

In 1913, Twining moved with his family from Monroe, Wisconsin, to Oswego, Oregon. He was educated in Wisconsin and Oregon, and was a 1917 graduate of Portland, Oregon&#x27;s Lincoln High School. He served in the Oregon National Guard from 1915 to 1917 and attained the rank of first sergeant. In 1917, he received an appointment to West Point after placing well in a competitive examination for members of the National Guard. Because the program was shortened to produce more officers for World War I, he spent only two years at the academy and graduated in 1919.

After serving in the Army infantry for three years, including post-war occupation duty in Germany, in 1922 Twining was reassigned to the Air Service. Over the next 15 years he flew fighter aircraft in Texas, Louisiana, and Hawaii, while also attending the Air Corps Tactical School and the Command and General Staff College. When World War II broke out in Europe he was assigned to the operations division on the Air Staff; then in 1942 he was sent to the South Pacific where he became chief of staff of the Allied air forces in that area.

In January 1943, he was promoted to major general and assumed command of the Thirteenth Air Force, and that same November he traveled across the world to take over the Fifteenth Air Force from Jimmy Doolittle. On February 1, 1943, the U.S. Navy rescued Maj. Gen. Twining, the 13th Air Force Commander, and 14 others near the New Hebrides. They had ditched their plane on the way from Guadalcanal to Espiritu Santo and spent six days in life rafts. After arriving in Europe, he commanded the Fifteenth Air Force as well as the Mediterranean Allied Strategic Air Force of the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces during the Combined Bomber Offensive and Oil campaign against the Axis. When Germany surrendered, Arnold sent Twining back to the Pacific to command the B-29s of the Twentieth Air Force in the last push against Japan, however he was in this command only a short time when the atomic strikes ended the war. On October 20, 1945, Twining led three B-29s in developing a new route from Guam to Washington via India and Germany. They completed the 13,167-mile-trip in 59 hours, 30 minutes. He returned to the States where he was named commander of the Air Materiel Command, and in 1947 he took over Alaskan Air Command.

On September 23, 1947, Lieutenant General Twining issued a memo to Brigadier General George Schulgen of the Army Air Forces. The subject line of the memo read “AMC Opinion Concerning &#x27;Flying Discs.&#x27;” The general tone of the memo was that unidentified objects seen in the skies by military personnel were not weather, astronomical or other phenomenon but rather objects that warranted further investigation. Twining wrote “The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious.”

After three years there Twining was set to retire as a lieutenant general, but when Muir Fairchild, the Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, died unexpectedly of a heart attack, Twining was elevated to full general and named his successor.

== United States Air Force Chief of Staff ==

When General Hoyt Vandenberg retired in mid-1953, Twining was selected as Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force; during his tenure, massive retaliation based on airpower became the national strategy. During his tenure as Air Force Chief of Staff Twining oversaw massive buildup within the United States Air Force, including the entrance of several jet-fleet aircraft within the Air Force such as the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker and F-100 Super Sabre. Twining also directed the development of missiles system within the Air Force. For his role and achievement in developing the Air Force, Twining was credited for leading the U.S. Air Force into a modern-day Air Force with far more sophisticated equipment rather than the old equipment that the Air Force used during the World War II and during the early years of the Air Force following the Air Force receiving its own autonomy in 1947.General Twining was also an ardent advocate of the Strategic Air Command and strongly believed that Strategic Air Command was the best deterrent to Communist military power. As a result, several of new Strategic Air Command bases including the Strategic Air Command underground command center in Strategic Air Command Headquarters was built during General Twining&#x27;s tenure as Air Force Chief of Staff.

As Air Force Chief of Staff General Twining also achieved the reputation for appeasing the acrimonious controversies which characterized the interservice rivalry during the immediate postwar years and played major role in easing the interservice rivalry. The interservice rivalry had emerged following the end of World War II and the establishment of National Security Act of 1947. One of interservice rivalry major conflict was the &quot;Revolt of the Admirals&quot; in 1949, on which the Truman administration canceled the building of supercarrier USS &quot;United States&quot; (CVA-58) due to Truman Administration and the Department of Defense more preferred the strategic bomber aircraft Convair B-36 Peacemaker, causing several high-ranking Navy officials to protest against the Truman administration decision to canceled the supercarrier project.

In 1956, Twining was chosen by Eisenhower to head a delegation of senior officers to visit Soviet Union, the first such exchange since World War II. He was shown by Zhukov at an air force base with Badger and Bison bombers flying overhead.

==Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff==

In 1957, President Eisenhower appointed Twining Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. During his term as chairman, Twining oversaw the early stage of the Space Race and boost the space program due to the Soviet that launch an intercontinental ballistic missile on August 25, 1957, and less than two months later successfully launch &quot;Sputnik&quot; in orbit. Twining also supported President Eisenhower New Look policy that turns the military capability from conventional military capability into a modern military capability by pushing the research and development for science and technology especially on the weapons program. The policy was to deter the threat from the Soviet and their Eastern Bloc allies and eventually preventing them to win the Arms race. One of Twining&#x27;s major achievement as Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff was the launch of The United States first liquid-fueled Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the Titan and Atlas Missile in 1959. Twining was also credited for established the growth of The Strategic Air Command or SAC as The United States primary Nuclear deterrence against the massive retaliation, as a result Strategic Air Command&#x27;s strength increased multiple times rather than when Strategic Air Command was first established in 1946. In 1958 when the Iraqi&#x27;s insurgent managed to topple the Iraqi&#x27;s monarchy government causing the neighboring Lebanon to be concerned that the uprising might spread within the Lebanon area. Those eventually leading General Twining to convince President Eisenhower to deploy troops to Lebanon in order to secure the government of President Camille Chamoun of Lebanon from the incoming uprising. General Twining also played major role during the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis when The People&#x27;s Republic of China forces (PRC) attacked the Taiwan Territory island of Quemoy and Matsu. Worried that the island of Taiwan might lose into the PRC&#x27;s communist, General Twining and the rest of the Joint Chiefs member recommended to President Eisenhower to use whatever force necessary in order to protect the Island of Taiwan from the PRC&#x27;s forces. This resulted in the deployment of United States Seventh Fleet and another two carriers from the Mediterranean including USS Lexington and USS Marshall to the Formosa strait. Several of the U.S. Air Force fighter aircraft also deployed to Taiwan. Those eventually the show of force along with some political initiatives did worked and the crisis passed after the bombardment ceased. During the Berlin Crisis in November 1958 General Twining convinced President Eisenhower that the Soviet threat is imminent and eventually could caused major crisis and told the President that the armed forces have to standby in cased some major crisis erupted. Some other service chief are considering for major mobilization forces along with the Western Allies. However General Twining saw that it was not necessary for that and The Soviet finally withdrew from its deadline in May 1959.
During his tenure as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Twining also played central role in working out a new procedures to coordinate a nuclear strike plans in order to prevent the first-strike and strength the United States deterrence against the United States enemy, especially those who own Nuclear Weapons. This resulted in the development of land-based missiles and Polaris Submarines missile in order to complement the submarine-launched ballistic missiles as part of the Nuclear Triad. Together with Secretary of Defense Thomas S. Gates Jr., Twining coordinated the creation of the Joint Strategic Planning Staff and also the Single Integrated Operational Plan. These two functions plan played major role during the Cold War and eventually still play major role even after the end of the Cold War.

Twining was re-appointed as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the second term in 1959. However, due to his deteriorating health condition following major surgery, Twining chose to take early retirement from active-duty on September 30, 1960.

Following his retirement from active duty Twining worked as vice chairman for the publishing firm Holt, Rinehart, and Winston. In 1965, Twining was named ninth annual recipient of the General William E. Mitchell Memorial Award.

General Nathan F. Twining died on March 29, 1982, at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>A commodity price index is a fixed-weight index or (weighted) average of selected commodity prices, which may be based on spot or futures prices. It is designed to be representative of the broad commodity asset class or a specific subset of commodities, such as energy or metals. It is an index that tracks a basket of commodities to measure their performance. They are similar to stock market indices but track the price of a basket of specific commodities. These indexes are often traded on exchanges, allowing investors to gain easier access to commodities without having to enter the futures market. The value of these indexes fluctuates based on their underlying commodities, and this value can be traded on an exchange in much the same way as stock index futures.

Investors can choose to obtain a passive exposure to these commodity price indices through a total return swap or a commodity index fund. The advantages of a passive commodity index exposure include negative correlation with other asset classes such as equities and bonds, as well as protection against inflation. The disadvantages include a negative roll yield due to contango in certain commodities, although this can be reduced by active management techniques, such as reducing the weights of certain constituents (e.g. precious and base metals) in the index.

== History ==
The first index to track commodity futures prices was the Dow Jones futures index which started being listed in 1933 (backfilled to 1924). The next such index was the CRB (&quot;Commodity Research Bureau&quot;) Index, which began in 1958. Due to its construction both of these were not useful as an investment index. A later practically investable commodity futures index was the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index, created in 1991 and known as the &quot;GSCI&quot;. The next was the Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index. It differed from the GSCI primarily in the weights allocated to each commodity. The DJ AIG had mechanisms to periodically limit the weight of any one commodity and to remove commodities whose weights became too small. After AIG&#x27;s financial problems in 2008 the Index rights were sold to UBS and then to Bloomberg and it is now known as the Bloomberg Commodity Index. Other commodity indices include the Reuters / CRB index (which is the old CRB Index re-structured in 2005) and the Rogers Index.

In 2005 Gary Gorton (then of Wharton) and Geert Rounwehorst (of Yale) published &quot;Facts and Fantasies About Commodities Futures&quot;, which pointed out relationships between a commodities index and the stock market, and inflation. They were both employed as consultants to AIG Financial Products (AIG-FP), which was responsible for managing the DJAIG Index. Gorton&#x27;s other role was to provide AIG-FP with the mathematical modelling expertise underpinning the construction of &quot;Super-Senior&quot; credit derivatives linked to mortgage-backed securities so as to ensure AIG was not exposed to risk of loss.

==Categories==
The constituents in a commodity price index can be broadly grouped into the following categories:
*Energy (such as Coal, Crude Oil, Ethanol, Gas Oil, Gasoline, Heating Oil, Natural Gas, Propane)
*Metals
**Base metals (such as Lead, Zinc, Nickel, Copper)
**Precious metals (such as Gold, Silver, Platinum, Palladium)
*Agriculture
**Grains (such as Corn, Oats, Rice, Soybeans, Wheat)
**Softs (such as Coffee, Cocoa, Sugar, Butter, Cotton, Milk, Orange Juice)
**Livestock (such as Hogs, Live Cattle, Pork Bellies, Feeder Cattle)

<doc id="730299" wikidata="Q709692" url="?curid=730299" title="Faustin Twagiramungu">
<text>Faustin Twagiramungu (14 August 1945 – 2 December 2023) was a Rwandan politician. He was Prime Minister of Rwanda from 1994 until his resignation in 1995, the first head of government appointed after the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) captured Kigali. He soon came to disagree with the RPF&#x27;s policies and actions, resigned and was placed under house arrest, but managed to leave the country and settle in Belgium. He continued his opposition activity against Paul Kagame&#x27;s rule, subsequently returning to Rwanda and standing for elections, but without success.

==Early life and career==
Twagiramungu was born in Cyangugu prefecture on 14 August 1945. Although Hutu in origin, Twagiramungu rejected the ethnic label and preferred to see himself as a Rwandan. Twagiramungu spoke Kinyarwanda, French, Swahili and English.

Twagiramungu studied and worked in Quebec, Canada, from 1968 to 1976, during which time he experienced Quebec separatism and met with René Lévesque. After returning to Rwanda, he ran a transportation company called STIR — Société des Transports Internationaux au Rwanda.

==Political career==
Twagiramungu rose to political prominence after the democratic opening in Rwanda in 1991, as the chairman of a new political party, the Republican Democratic Movement (). MDR joined the multiparty government set up in April 1992, and an MDR politician, Dismas Nsengiyaremye, became the Prime Minister. However, in July 1993, MDR was split between two factions headed by Nsengiyaremye and Twagiramungu, who both wanted to be the Prime Minister in the anticipated Broad-Based Transitional Government (BBTG), a post which was to be decided prior to the signing of the Arusha Accords. Twagiramungu&#x27;s faction was weak, but he succeeded thanks to support from the other political parties. The Arusha Accords were signed on 4 August 1993, and Twagiramungu was chosen to be the Prime Minister. The BBTG was never installed.

===Prime Minister after the genocide===
In July 1994, Twagiramungu finally became Prime Minister in the Arusha-inspired &quot;Government of National Unity&quot; set up by the RPF after taking power in wake of the Rwandan genocide. His appointment was tinged with symbolism for many Rwandans, as he was the son-in-law of Grégoire Kayibanda. After taking office, Twagiramungu was faced with the vexing problem of human rights abuses by the RPF. Like interior minister Seth Sendashonga, he believed there had to be a certain amount of tolerance, but was worried when there seemed to be no end in sight. According to the historian Gérard Prunier who has discussed the issue with Twagiramungu at length, &quot;The Hutu ministers were so conscious of the potential catastrophe their eventual resignations could cause that they swallowed it all in the name of national unity. Until the Kibeho slaughter pushed them over the brink.&quot; The tension within the administration came to a head when Twagiramungu called for an &quot;extraordinary council of ministers on security matters&quot; which met on 23 August 1995 and ended two days later when Paul Kagame—the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Rwanda and the RPF—made a sardonic comment and left the room. On 28 August, Twagiramungu decided to resign, and four other ministers were fired the next day, including Sendashonga. Twagiramungu was put under house arrest, but managed to leave the country by the end of the year.

===Opposition in exile===
In Brussels in March 1996, Twagiramungu and Sendashonga set up an exiled opposition party called the Democratic Forces for Resistance (). FRD was officially launched in April 1997. On 16 May 1998, Sendashonga, who had survived an earlier attempt on his life, was assassinated in Nairobi. Twagiramungu denounced the murder and accused the Rwandan government of culpability. In 2001, a Kenyan court found that the murder was political and blamed the Rwandan government.

In 1998, FRD invited four other exiled movements (RDR, , and UNAR) to form the Union of Rwandan Democratic Forces (), which wanted to press for a new power-sharing agreement along the lines of the Arusha Accords, and Twagiramungu was slated to be its president from 1998 to 2002. RNLM and UNAR were both old monarchist parties, seen to represent Tutsi interests, but they soon abandoned the alliance. As president of UFDR, Twagiramungu reportedly worked as if he was alone, creating &quot;a party within a party&quot;, and was distanced even from the majority of his own party, the FRD. He was also unpopular with the old guard of the RDR &quot;because of his leading role in the Rwandan opposition to Juvénal Habyarimana&#x27;s government and his position in the moderate section of the MDR.&quot; Twagiramungu resigned from the presidency in December 2001 and &quot;essentially detached himself from the opposition movements&quot;.

On 10 December 2002, Twagiramungu announced that he would be a candidate in the Rwandan presidential election of 2003. Running on a platform of full employment, regional security, and progressive taxation, he accused the government of attempting to silence his views. He was forced to stand as an independent as his political party, the MDR, was banned. In the final count, he placed second (out of three) with 3.62 percent of the vote. He did not accept the result, claiming that Paul Kagame was leading the country towards a one-party system. The elections were widely condemned as fraudulent by outside observers. Twagiramungu left Rwanda immediately after the election, fearing arrest.

In 2010, Twagiramungu founded a &quot;new political trend&quot; called the Rwandan Dream Initiative (RDI). In early 2014, RDI teamed up with three other parties (PS-Imberakuri, and FDLR) to form the Coalition of Political Parties for Change (CPC). The inclusion of FDLR was a point of controversy. The coalition was reportedly falling apart before the end of the year.

On 4 April 2014, only two days after Kagame had visited Brussels, Twagiramungu was informed by Belgian police and state security that his life was in danger, and his house was provided with police protection for four days. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported that &quot;there is mounting evidence that Mr. Kagame&#x27;s agents are involved in organized efforts to kill exiled dissidents&quot;. 

Twagiramungu died in Brussels on 2 December 2023, at age 78.

<text>Charles Egbert Tuttle Jr. (April 5, 1915 – June 9, 1993) was an American publisher and book dealer who was internationally recognized for his contributions to understanding between the English- and Japanese-speaking worlds. Belonging to a family long associated with publishing, he travelled to Japan in a military role at the end of World War II, and established a publishing company there. Tuttle was the founder and eponym of the Charles E. Tuttle Company, now named Tuttle Publishing. Many of his company&#x27;s books on Asian martial arts, particularly those on Japanese martial arts, were the first widely read publications on these subjects in the English language.

==Early life==
Tuttle was born on April 5, 1915, in Rutland, Vermont, United States of America. His family had long been involved in printing books and stationery, dating from the mid-19th century in the US, and tracing their history back to Richard Tottel in the late 16th century in London. His father, Charles E. Tuttle Sr., published African-American literature and dealt in rare books, and also worked closely with the Vermont Historical Society. Tuttle attended local schools, the Phillips Exeter Academy, and Harvard University for his education. At university, he studied American history and literature. After graduating in 1937, he worked in the library of Columbia University for a year, then joined the family business.

==Japan==
In 1943, Tuttle&#x27;s father died and, with World War II in progress, he enlisted in the United States Army. He completed officer training and, when the war ended, was selected as part of the Allied forces occupying Japan. He arrived in Tokyo in October 1945, expecting to take charge of the library of the Diet of Japan (as he had been ordered), only to find that General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s staff had changed his assignment. He spent the next two years helping the Japanese newspaper industry. In 1947, Tuttle met Reiko Chiba, who belonged to a wealthy Japanese family from Hokkaidō; the two were married in 1951.

Tuttle founded his publishing company in Tokyo in 1948, with the mission to publish &quot;books to span the East and West.&quot; His company was the 31st corporation approved by the occupying administration. In its first year of operation, it imported and distributed US paperback publications to the occupying forces, and the next year, it released its first publication. In 1951, the company began an intensive publishing program, producing English translations of contemporary Japanese literature, dictionaries of Japanese and other Asian languages, books on Japanese art and culture, and books on Japanese martial arts. Notably, many of its books on Asian martial arts were the first widely read publications on these subjects in the English language.

==Later life==
In 1971, the Association of American Publishers named Tuttle as its Publisher of the Year. In June 1978, he and his nephew, Tom Mori, founded the Tuttle-Mori Agency. In 1983, the Japanese government awarded him the Order of the Sacred Treasure, 3rd Class (Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon), for his contributions to the advancement of Japanese–American understanding. Through the late 1980s, Tuttle focused on the rare book business.

Following a brief illness, Tuttle died in his sleep on June 9, 1993, in his home town of Rutland, and was survived by his wife. Reiko Tuttle continued to run Charles E. Tuttle Company until 1996, when she sold the business to a cousin, Eric Oey and Tuttle Antiquarian Books until 2001, when she sold the business to two long-serving Tuttle company employees. She died on April 14, 2006, in Tokyo. Reflecting on the couple&#x27;s contribution to Vermont, J. Kevin Graffagnino, Executive Director of the Vermont Historical Society, wrote: &quot;Charles and Reiko Tuttle epitomized Vermont’s tradition of making a difference without fanfare or self-congratulation.&quot;

<text>Vlastimil Tusar (18 October 1880 – 22 March 1924) was a Czech journalist and political figure. He served as prime minister of Czechoslovakia from 1919 to 1920, in two periods.

Tusar was born as the son of a civil servant, and attended a gymnasium and an economical school in Prague. Between 1900 and 1903 he worked for a bank, in 1903 he became a journalist for various social democratic papers. In 1908 he became editor in chief of the weekly magazine &quot;Rovnost&quot; in Brno and changed it into a daily newspaper.

In 1911, he was elected Member of the Austrian Reichsrat (the parliament of Austro-Hungary) for the constituency of Brno. At first he was pro-Austrian oriented, but later he changed his mind and in 1918 he played a vital role in the formation of Czechoslovakia as a new state. On 27 October 1918 from Vienna he informed Alois Rašín, that it was the best moment to declare the independence of Czechoslovakia. Then he became a member of the new Czechoslovak parliament, but until 1919 he stayed in Vienna as a negotiator with the newly formed Republic of Austria, negotiating mainly about border issues.

8 July 1919 he became prime minister of a new coalition government of Social Democrats and the Agrarian party. After parliamentary elections in 1920 he became prime minister again. On 14 August the government resigned because of the rising activity of the communist wing in Social Democracy.

On 1 March 1921 he left his seat in parliament, having been made Czechoslovak ambassador in Berlin, where he died in 1924.

== Private life ==
Vlastimil Tusar married Štěpánka Tusarová (née Pelíšková) in 1906, with whom he had two daughters, and divorced her in 1912. From 1917 until his death in 1924 he was married to Hedvika Tusarová (née Welzel).

<text>Stansfield Turner (December 1, 1923 January 18, 2018) was an admiral in the United States Navy who served as President of the Naval War College (1972–1974), commander of the United States Second Fleet (1974–1975), and Supreme Allied Commander NATO Southern Europe (1975–1977), and was Director of Central Intelligence (1977–1981) under the Carter administration. A graduate of Exeter College, Oxford and the United States Naval Academy, Turner served for more than 30 years in the Navy, commanding warships, a carrier group, and NATO&#x27;s military forces in southern Europe, among other commands.

Turner was appointed to lead the CIA by Jimmy Carter in 1977 and undertook a series of controversial reforms, including downsizing the Agency&#x27;s clandestine arm and emphasizing technical intelligence collection over human intelligence. He also oversaw the CIA&#x27;s responses to the Iranian Revolution and the Soviet–Afghan War. After leaving the CIA in 1981, Turner entered the private sector, authored several books, and criticized subsequent administrations, including the Bush administration&#x27;s handling of the Iraq War. He was a senior research scholar at the University of Maryland, College Park&#x27;s School of Public Policy.

==Early life and education==
Turner was born in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois, on December 1, 1923, to Oliver Stansfield Turner, a real estate broker, and Wilhelmina Josephine Wagner. Turner was life-long Christian Scientist having been raised in a Christian Science family. He remained a devout member of the Christian Science Church, including The Christian Science Mother Church in Boston, Massachusetts, as well as several Christian Science branch churches where he taught in the Sunday School. He graduated from Highland Park High School in 1941 before attending Amherst College until 1943. After joining the United States Naval Reserve, he received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy in 1943 as a member of the Class of 1947. While at Annapolis, he participated in the Navy Midshipmen football program as a guard. Although Turner and fellow transfer student Jimmy Carter were in the same class at the Academy, he received his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering and attained a commission in the United States Navy in June 1946 as part of an accelerated three-year curriculum, the result of World War II. He was a Rhodes Scholar at Exeter College, Oxford while serving in the Navy, graduating with a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics in 1950, which was promoted to an MA per tradition. In 1966, he attended the six-week Advanced Management Program at Harvard Business School.

==Military career==
Upon commissioning as a naval officer, Turner served briefly aboard the escort carrier USS &quot;Palau&quot; and the light cruiser USS &quot;Dayton&quot;. After a brief leave of absence to attend Oxford, Turner returned to navy service and served as a gunnery officer aboard the destroyer USS &quot;Stribling&quot; and then the operations officer aboard the USS &quot;Hanson&quot;, taking part in shore bombardments in the closing months of the Korean War. From 1956 to 1958, he served as commanding officer of the ocean mine sweeper (MSO), USS &quot;Conquest&quot;, and later executive officer of the destroyer USS &quot;Morton&quot; (DD-948) in 1961 and 1962. Turner then served as commanding officer of the destroyer USS &quot;Rowan&quot; and the guided missile cruiser USS &quot;Horne&quot; (DLG-30), where he participated in combat operations off the coast of Vietnam.

He commanded Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla 8 as a rear admiral, leading a task group in 1970–1971 consisting of the aircraft carriers &quot;Independence&quot; and &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; monitoring the Soviet Fifth Eskadra in the Mediterranean. He then served as Director, Systems Analysis Division, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (1971–1972); President of the Naval War College (1972–1974); and Commander, United States Second Fleet, Naval Station Norfolk (1974–1975). After being promoted to admiral in 1975, Turner became NATO Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe, Naples where he served until his appointment to the CIA in 1977. Turner retired from active Navy duty on December 31, 1978.

==Career==

===Central Intelligence Agency===
In February 1977, President Jimmy Carter nominated Turner as Director of Central Intelligence, after Ted Sorenson&#x27;s nomination was withdrawn due to his background as a conscientious objector and allegations of mishandling classified documents. After two days of hearings, Turner was unanimously confirmed to lead the Agency.
President Carter wanted reforms on the intelligence agencies, whose reputations were discredited due to the Watergate scandal (Church Commission), and other controversies that involved spying on citizens, against the antiwar movement and other dissident groups in the United States, and international assassination plots (Human rights violations by the CIA). Turner sought to revamp the Agency in several ways, first appointing several high-ranking naval officers, known as the &quot;Navy mafia&quot;, to leadership positions and also by fundamentally altering the Agency&#x27;s traditional methods of intelligence collection. Under Turner&#x27;s direction, the CIA emphasized technical intelligence (TECHINT) and signals intelligence (SIGINT) over human intelligence (HUMINT). In October 1977, Turner eliminated over 800 operational positions, most of them in the clandestine service, in what was dubbed the Halloween Massacre. In a memoir published in 2005, Turner expressed regret for the dismissals stating, &quot;In retrospect, I probably should not have effected the reductions of 820 positions at all, and certainly not the last 17.&quot; The reductions applied to Vietnam-era personnel according to later-era employee and novelist Jason Matthews. Turner also oversaw the beginning of Operation Cyclone, the CIA&#x27;s program to arm Afghan guerrillas in their fight against the Soviet Union.

During Turner&#x27;s term as head of the CIA, he became outraged when former employee Frank Snepp published a book called &quot;Decent Interval&quot; which exposed incompetence among senior U.S. government personnel during the fall of Saigon. Turner accused Snepp of breaking the secrecy agreement required of all CIA employees, and then later was forced to admit under cross-examination that he had never read the agreement signed by Snepp. Regardless, the CIA ultimately won its case against Snepp at the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court forced Snepp to turn over all his profits from &quot;Decent Interval&quot; and to seek preclearance of any future writings about intelligence work for the rest of his life. Ironically, the CIA would later rely on the &quot;Snepp&quot; legal precedent to force Turner to seek preclearance of his own memoirs, which were highly critical of President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s policies.

On March 12, 1980, President Jimmy Carter and Turner presented Tony Mendez with the CIA&#x27;s Intelligence Star for his role in the exfiltration of six U.S. State Department personnel from Iran on January 28, 1980.

===Post-CIA activities===
Upon leaving the agency, Turner became a lecturer, author, and TV commentator, and served on the boards of several American corporations, including Monsanto (1981–1991) and the National Life Group (1985–1992). Turner served as a member of the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography&#x27;s Marine Advisory Council and the United States Naval Academy&#x27;s Board of Visitors. He also wrote several books, including &quot;Secrecy and Democracy – The CIA in Transition&quot; (1985), &quot;Terrorism and Democracy&quot; (1991), &quot;Caging the Nuclear Genie – An American Challenge for Global Security&quot; (1997; revised edition, 1999), and 2005&#x27;s &quot;Burn Before Reading: Presidents, CIA Directors, and Secret Intelligence&quot;, in which he advocated fragmenting the CIA.

Turner was sharply critical of the Bush administration&#x27;s handling of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In September 2003 he wrote that &quot;most of the assumptions behind our invasion have been proven wrong: The intelligence did not support the imminence of a threat, the Iraqis have not broadly welcomed us as liberators, the idea that we could manage this action almost unilaterally is giving way to pleas for troops and money from other nations, the aversion to giving the U.N. a meaningful role is eroding daily, and the reluctance to get involved in nation building is being supplanted by just that.&quot; In 2004, Turner was among 27 retired diplomats and military commanders who publicly said the administration of President Bush did not understand the world and was unable to handle &quot;in either style or substance&quot; the responsibilities of global leadership.

In November 2005, after Vice President Dick Cheney lobbied against a provision to a defense bill that Republican Senator John McCain passed in the Senate banning &quot;cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment&quot; of all U.S. detainees, Turner was quoted as saying, &quot;I am embarrassed that the USA has a vice president for torture. I think it is just reprehensible. He [Dick Cheney] advocates torture, what else is it? I just don&#x27;t understand how a man in that position can take such a stance.&quot; Cheney countered the bill that went well beyond banning torture and could be interpreted by courts to ban most forms of interrogation.

Turner served on the Military Advisors Committee for the Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, whose mission was to reduce the amount of the discretionary budget going to the military by 15 percent and reallocate that money to education, healthcare, renewable energies, job training, and humanitarian aid programs.

==Personal life and death==

Turner married Patricia Busby Whitney (September 25, 1923 – June 12, 2013) on December 23, 1953. The couple had two children, Laurel and Geoffrey. The marriage ended in divorce in 1984. Turner then married Norwegian-born Eli Karin Gilbert () in 1985. On January 15, 2000, Turner survived a plane crash, although seriously injured, in Costa Rica that killed his wife and three other people on board. Turner and his wife were on the L-410 Turbolet operated by Taxi Aereo Centroamericano, on a flight from the small airport of Tobías Bolaños International Airport in San José, destined toward Tortuguero.

<doc id="730322" wikidata="Q464109" url="?curid=730322" title="Scissor Sisters">
<text>Scissor Sisters are an American pop rock band formed in 2000. The band&#x27;s current line-up consists of Jake Shears (vocals), Babydaddy (various instruments) and Del Marquis (guitar, bass). Former members include vocalist Ana Matronic and drummers Paddy Boom and Randy Real. 

Scissor Sisters incorporate diverse styles in their music, but tend to sway towards pop rock, glam rock, nu-disco, and electroclash. Forged in the &quot;gay nightlife scene of New York&quot;, the band took its name from the female same-sex sexual activity of tribadism.

The band came to prominence following the release of their Grammy-nominated and chart-topping disco version of &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; and subsequent debut album &quot;Scissor Sisters&quot; (2004). The album was a success, particularly in the UK where it reached number one, was the best-selling album of 2004, was later certified nine-times platinum by the BPI, and earned them three BRIT Awards in 2005. All five of its singles reached positions within the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart while &quot;Filthy/Gorgeous&quot; scored the band their first number one on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Songs, despite the album&#x27;s meager success in their native US.

The album continued its success in countries around Europe, in Australia and in Canada before the release of the band&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Ta-Dah&quot; (2006), their second consecutive UK number one album which produced their first UK number one single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Feel Like Dancin&#x27;&quot;. Their third studio album &quot;Night Work&quot; (2010) displayed a shift towards a more club-oriented sound, charting at number two on the UK Albums Chart, number one on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Independent Albums chart and in the top 10 of several international territories. The band released their fourth studio album &quot;Magic Hour&quot; in May 2012.

Scissor Sisters has performed around the world and have become recognized for their controversial and transgressive live performances. They also collaborated with a number of other well-known pop musicians, including Elton John and Kylie Minogue; these particular collaborations have been received positively by both critics and other notable figures. In 2004, Bono, lead vocalist of rock band U2, described Scissor Sisters as &quot;the best pop group in the world&quot;. They also collaborated with Global Cool in 2007 on one of their green lifestyle campaigns.

Originally named Dead Lesbian and the Fibrillating Scissor Sisters, the final two words being derived from the lesbian sexual act of tribadism, the band was founded in 2000 after friends Jason &quot;Jake Shears&quot; Sellards and Scott &quot;Babydaddy&quot; Hoffman (who had met in 1999 in Lexington, Kentucky) both moved to New York City, enjoying its open and gay-friendly ethos. They began producing music together, with Babydaddy composing music and Shears writing lyrics. The duo released a couple of singles to little success and began appearing at underground clubs on New York&#x27;s Lower East Side. On a trip to Disneyland, the pair met Ana &quot;Matronic&quot; Lynch at a screening of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Captain EO&quot;. During a subsequent teacup ride, they discovered that they had a lot in common. Shears later remarked, &quot;I really thought she was a freak but when I started singing &quot;Another Part of Me&quot; she showed me the best moonwalk I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

Ana Matronic ran a weekly cabaret event known as Knock Off at a club called the Slipper Room in New York, where she liked to hire eccentric and alternative acts; one reporter described it as a place that &quot;served up a racy, multigender revue of kitsch,&quot; and that a performer dressed as a giant vulva &quot;enfolded me with her labia while singing &quot;Lick Me in My Wet Spot&quot; to the tune of &quot;Hit Me With Your Best Shot&quot;.&quot; Matronic invited the pair to appear at Knock Off, which they did on September 21, 2001. Shears dressed as his character &quot;Jason the Amazing Back-Alley Late Term Abortion&quot; whilst Matronic, dressed as a reject from Andy Warhol&#x27;s Factory, joined the pair on stage and sang. Shears and Babydaddy felt she was very effective and asked her to join the band on a permanent basis, to which she agreed.

The trio then began appearing at other clubs, dropping the word &quot;Fibrillating&quot; from their name. They primarily played electroclash, which was popular at the time in the underground club scene of New York with bands like Peaches and Chicks on Speed. They were soon joined by Derek &quot;Del Marquis&quot; Gruen on lead guitar, who had known Shears from when they both worked at the IC Guys club where Shears had been a stripper. They were joined by a fifth member, Patrick &quot;Paddy Boom&quot; Seacor, on drums who (being heterosexual) felt the need to explain to his mother that &quot;it&#x27;s not a gay band... there [are] gay members, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s about the music and about performance.&quot;

In 2002, the band signed with a small New York record company called A Touch of Class for a two-single deal. Their first single &quot;Electrobix&quot; dealt with gay men&#x27;s obsessions with working out but proved to be less popular than its B-side, a cover version of Pink Floyd&#x27;s progressive rock classic &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;. Matronic commented, &quot;It&#x27;s one of those songs that people were either gonna love or hate, and that&#x27;s really, really powerful, because it basically means you&#x27;re evoking a reaction in everyone. The first time I heard it, I thought that if it doesn&#x27;t make us famous, it&#x27;ll make us infamous because somebody will shoot us!&quot; Their version of &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; became a hit in many dance clubs and, after sending Pink Floyd themselves a copy, the Scissor Sisters received positive remarks from the song&#x27;s original writers Roger Waters and David Gilmour. The song proved to be particularly popular in the UK, where various record labels soon took an interest in the band. In 2003, they decided they would tour Europe where they believed audiences would be more receptive to them and their music than their native US.

=== 2003–2004: Debut album and breakthrough success ===
&quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; came to the attention of British label Polydor, who signed the group to a contract. Their first single for the label &quot;Laura&quot; (with two different music videos) had a limited release in 2003 and reaching number 54 in the UK Singles Chart, receiving little attention with the exceptions of British music paper &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, Channel 4&#x27;s entertainment programme &quot;V Graham Norton&quot;, and the same channel&#x27;s music programme &quot;Popworld&quot; for which they were interviewed. The track also received much radio play in Australia. Their track &quot;It Can&#x27;t Come Quickly Enough&quot; was also included on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Party Monster&quot; (2003), playing over its ending credits.

Their first hit was in 2004 with the official release of &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;. Reaching number 10 in the UK, this success was followed by &quot;Take Your Mama&quot; which went to number 17, a re-release of &quot;Laura&quot; (with two different music videos) which went to number 12, the ballad &quot;Mary&quot; which went to number 14, and the hedonist anthem &quot;Filthy/Gorgeous&quot; which peaked at number 5 in the UK. All the singles came from their debut album &quot;Scissor Sisters&quot;, which reached number one in the UK Albums Chart and became the best selling album of 2004, beating Keane&#x27;s &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; by 582 copies. As of 2018, it is the 20th biggest-selling album of the 21st century, and the 35th biggest-selling of all time in the UK.

Several media outlets noted that Scissor Sisters &quot;stick out like a sore thumb&quot; on the list of artists who have sold over 2 million copies of an album in the UK in the 21st century, the others being James Blunt, Robbie Williams, Keane, Dido, Coldplay and Norah Jones—artists considered &quot;mainstream&quot; compared to the Scissor Sisters&#x27; brash and controversial image. The band had been particularly keen on producing an album that fitted together well rather than simply producing a string of singles. According to Babydaddy, their purpose was &quot;to create a perfect pop rock album that would pick you up at the beginning, take you on a journey in the middle, and set you right back down again in the same place at the end.&quot;

About six months after its British release, &quot;Scissor Sisters&quot; was released in the US. To publicize it the band appeared on the popular morning television show &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, an event that Shears later recalled: &quot;Kelly Ripa loved us, after the first time we played, she gave me a hug and whispered in my ear, &#x27;I just want you to know that this is my favorite music performance we&#x27;ve ever had.&#x27; It was amazing.&quot; Nonetheless, neither the band nor the album proved to be a big commercial success in the US: major chain store Wal-Mart refused to stock it, claiming on its website that it contained &quot;a snarling, swaggering attack on conservatism&quot; in the form of the song &quot;Tits on the Radio&quot;.

The band refused to produce a &quot;clean&quot; version of the album, and Babydaddy remarked that, &quot;We did have to slap a parental warning sticker on the disc, which is completely absurd. I think a kid listening to Eminem is getting a much more negative message than what we&#x27;ve been putting forward. We&#x27;ve only got one &#x27;shit&#x27; and a few &#x27;tits!&#x27;&quot; Band members have shown their dissatisfaction with the decision on a number of occasions. However, they continued their success in Europe by performing at the Brixton Academy in London for Halloween 2004, where they asked the audience to dress up as the characters from &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;; the band themselves did so too.

=== 2005–2007: &quot;Ta-Dah&quot; ===
Recording of the second album, &quot;Ta-Dah&quot;, commenced in mid-May 2005 at the Discoball; sneak previews of new songs were played at live performances, including &quot;Everybody Wants the Same Thing&quot;, performed at the Live 8 concert, &quot;Paul McCartney&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Decide&quot;, &quot;Hybrid Man&quot;, &quot;Forever Right Now&quot; and &quot;Hair Baby&quot; (a title that refers to the phenomenon of tumors containing partially formed fetuses). Among the assumed pseudonyms used to play a series of secret shows to test this new material were &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27; Diarrhea&quot;, &quot;Portion Control&quot; and &quot;Megapussi&quot;. Scissor Sisters were also one of the headlining acts at the British V Festival in 2005, where they collaborated on stage with Scottish rock group Franz Ferdinand to perform a cover version of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Suffragette City&quot;.
The band fulfilled one of its dreams: Elton John collaborated with them on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Feel Like Dancin&#x27;&quot; (as pianist and co-writer). The song reached No. 1 in the United Kingdom on September 10, 2006, and remained in the top spot for four consecutive weeks. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Feel Like Dancin&#x27;&quot; also peaked at No. 1 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart and the Euro Hot 100. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Feel Like Dancin&#x27;&quot; became the group&#x27;s biggest hit to date.

Elton John also contributed to the song &quot;Intermission&quot; on &quot;Ta-Dah&quot; and played piano on a demo of the song &quot;Bad Shit&quot; (that can be found on the &quot;Lights&quot; CDsingle).

In 2006, they acted as an opening act for Depeche Mode&#x27;s Touring the Angel Tour for a concert in Mountain View, California. Their first gig in the UK for promotion of the second album took place at the KOKO Club, Camden, London, on August 31, 2006, and was filmed for MTV. 2006 performances at the Bowery Ballroom and Siren Music Festival in New York and the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival allowed the band to showcase an array of songs from the new album. A free concert was given in Trafalgar Square to 10,000 ballot winners on September 16, 2006, to promote the Red charity. The band also headlined the 2006 Bestival festival on the Isle of Wight. Additionally, they were invited to BBC&#x27;s Maida Vale studios to perform different songs on every show broadcast on BBC Radio 1. The event, dubbed &quot;Scissor Sisters Day&quot;, culminated in them actually standing in for presenter Pete Tong and hosting his three-hour slot themselves. The show took an unexpected turn when a woman in labour telephoned the show to share her experience with the band and they played &quot;Push It&quot; by Salt-n-Pepa for her. Several performances, interviews, and a humorous jingle that was written in an hour, were filmed and edited into a special seven-day, looped broadcast on BBCi.

The album was released on September 18, 2006 in the United Kingdom, and on September 26, 2006 in the United States. According to Shears, the album is a combination of 1960s psychedelia, glam rock and disco. It reached No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart in its first week of release, officially taking the top spot on September 24, 2006, marking a first for the Scissor Sisters, consisting of a single and album at the top of the UK charts simultaneously. The album &quot;Ta-Dah&quot; leaked onto the Internet on September 10, 2006, five days before its release in the United Kingdom.

The Scissor Sisters ended their first UK tour at the Wembley Arena, London, from November 24 to 26, 2006, supported by new artist Lily Allen, who performed during the three days there. The band has also been in the Latin America Top 40 Airplay. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Feel Like Dancin&#x27;&quot; is still charting and is so far their biggest hit to date in Latin America, reaching No. 23, charting mostly in South America, particularly Peru. &quot;Land of a Thousand Words&quot; was released as the second single from the album, peaking at No. 19 in the UK. &quot;She&#x27;s My Man&quot; was the third single released in March 2007, peaking at No. 29. &quot;Kiss You Off&quot; was the fourth and final single released in May 2007 but failed to dent the Top 40, their first single since their debut &quot;Laura&quot; to do so. The &quot;Kiss You Off&quot; video centered around Ana Matronic in a futuristic beauty salon. The group was the main event during the New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations for 2007 in Berlin. On February 8 and 9, 2007, the group appeared on the American daytime soap opera &quot;Passions&quot;. They performed &quot;I Don&#x27;t Feel Like Dancin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Land of a Thousand Words&quot; from the album &quot;Ta-Dah&quot;.

=== 2008–2011: &quot;Night Work&quot; and other projects ===

After touring the world in 2007, the band had a short hiatus in order to work on their next studio album. Premiering new material of this album at secret gigs in New York City&#x27;s Mercury Lounge in October 2008, they assumed the names Queef Latina and Debbie&#x27;s Hairy. New songs included on the set list were &quot;Television&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Money&quot;, &quot;Other Girls&quot;, &quot;Major for You&quot;, &quot;None of My Business&quot;, &quot;Singularity&quot;, &quot;Do the Strand&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s There&quot;, &quot;Not the Loving Kind&quot;, &quot;Taking Shape&quot; (with Babydaddy on lead vocals), and &quot;Uroboros&quot;. Shears stated on the band&#x27;s website there was a possibility that none of these songs would appear on the album, as the band was less than satisfied with most of them. This was confirmed to be the case when the track list was revealed. Drummer Paddy Boom was absent at these gigs and it was later announced that he had amicably parted from the band. The band had come into contact with drummer Randy &quot;Real&quot; Schrager, who was known from his work on the downtown New York scene, playing with bands such as Jessica Vale and The Act. He was initially brought on as a fill-in during Paddy Boom&#x27;s leave of absence. Eventually, Randy was made part of the full-time line-up.

Scissor Sisters spent much of 2008 and early 2009 in the recording studio. However, after working on new material for approximately 18 months, the band decided to shelve their third album. Shears explained: &quot;In my heart I knew it wasn&#x27;t right. I didn&#x27;t really know what it was trying to say. It left me a little bit cold.&quot; Reportedly, an entire record had been worked on but that the group had &quot;shelved it about a year ago.&quot; Shears admits, &quot;If it wasn&#x27;t something we could fully get behind and believe in, I think the band was going to be over.&quot;

In June 2009, the band returned to the studio and began to work on new tracks that made it onto &quot;Night Work&quot;, their replacement third album. Produced in collaboration with Stuart Price, &quot;Night Work&quot; was released on June 28, 2010. The album was described as &quot;supersexual and sleazy&quot; with its first single, &quot;Fire with Fire&quot; as &quot;a really epic song that makes you feel really good&quot;. With the album, the band have toured worldwide on The Night Work Tour. As an opening act, they joined Lady Gaga for select dates on her third leg of The Monster Ball Tour in early 2011.

Shears and Scissor Sisters collaborator John &quot;JJ&quot; Garden provided the lyrics and score for a world-premiere musical adaptation of Armistead Maupin&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the City&quot;, a much-loved series of novels (and later a television miniseries) about life in San Francisco in the 1970s. The musical was first developed at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center&#x27;s National Music Theater Conference in 2009, where Shears and Garden collaborated with a creative team that included playwright Jeff Whitty and director Jason Moore, of the Tony-Award-winning musical &quot;Avenue Q&quot;. The show had a subsequent run in San Francisco on May 18, 2011 at the American Conservatory Theater.

=== 2012–2024: &quot;Magic Hour&quot; and indefinite hiatus ===

On October 31, 2011, Shears tweeted that the band&#x27;s fourth album was in its final stages. A song from the new album titled &quot;Shady Love&quot; debuted on Annie Mac&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show on January 2, 2012. &quot;Shady Love&quot; features guest vocals from Azealia Banks while Jake Shears performs under his pseudonym Krystal Pepsy.

On March 13, 2012, Scissor Sisters announced the title of the album, &quot;Magic Hour&quot;, and revealed that the record would be released worldwide on May 28, 2012. The band also announced the release date of a new single, &quot;Only the Horses&quot;. Originally scheduled to come out on May 20, the release of &quot;Only the Horses&quot; was brought forward to May 13. The video premiered on Thursday April 18, 2012. On May 7, the band released the track &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Kiki&quot; exclusively via Spotify in some countries.

Upon release, &quot;Magic Hour&quot; peaked at #4 on the UK Albums Chart and #35 on the US Billboard 200. The album reached #1 on Billboard&#x27;s Dance/Electronic Albums chart. The band embarked on a world tour in support of &quot;Magic Hour&quot;, starting with summer shows in North America. On July 10, 2012, they performed the American TV premiere of &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Kiki&quot; on Bravo-TV&#x27;s &quot;Watch What Happens Live&quot;. They toured Europe in September and October 2012.

On October 23, 2012, while performing at the Camden Roundhouse, Scissor Sisters announced an indefinite hiatus. A year later, Ana Matronic insisted that the band, while still on break, had not permanently split.

The band collaborated on a charity record with MNDR and released &quot;Swerlk&quot; on June 9, 2017, their first release in five years. Proceeds for the single were donated to the Contigo Fund, a nonprofit organization for LGBTQ individuals.

In June 2019, Shears stated the impetus for the band&#x27;s hiatus was the success of &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Kiki&quot; in the US and wanting to end things on a high note: &quot;I didn’t know what the fuck to say after that song, quite honestly. When that song came out and did what it did [hitting #1 on the Billboard dance charts], I was just like, &#x27;Well, there it is, I guess we did it.&#x27; I truly had no idea what to follow that up with. So I thought, we’ve been recording and touring for 10 years, and I felt like it was time. This wasn’t what anybody in the band had planned to do. So I thought it would be fun to end on a high note. But you know what? That’s not to say we’re never going to do anything again. The Scissor Sisters will be back.&quot; He later noted: &quot;I think reaching that goal, and feeling like we were in a great moment, made it feel like a great time to hang up our hats.&quot;

===2024–present: Reunion and 2025 tour ===
After over seven years of inactivity, on October 29, 2024, the band&#x27;s logo appeared on Glasgow&#x27;s OVO Hydro and Manchester&#x27;s Co-op Live arenas. The following day, the band&#x27;s social feeds were updated with the text &quot;31.10.24&quot;.

On October 31, the band confirmed that they were reuniting for a string of shows in 2025, in celebration of the 20th anniversary of their debut album. The band&#x27;s reunited line-up will be a trio, featuring Jake Shears, Babydaddy and Del Marquis, and will not feature the participation of Ana Matronic, Paddy Boom or Randy Real. 

Regarding Ana Matronic&#x27;s absence, Shears noted: &quot;I think it just didn&#x27;t line up. It&#x27;s not something that she wanted to do at this moment in time. And I didn&#x27;t want that to keep us from coming out and playing these songs.&quot; Babydaddy elaborated: &quot;It&#x27;s more her story to tell than ours. Except to say that, I think she&#x27;s such a part of the spirit of this band, especially at that moment in time. There were definitely conversations, and I think hopefully a good understanding of it just not being the right time. So it is a little funny [to be reuniting without her]. But also, there&#x27;s the people that want to hear this music again too. Maybe there is some future where Ana comes back and does stuff too. Who knows? She&#x27;ll be in the back of our minds, for sure. But in the meantime, for the 20th anniversary, it just felt like we wanted to see what these songs do out there.&quot;

==Artistry==
===Musical style===
Scissor Sisters&#x27; music can be generally described as a mixture of glam rock, disco and alternative music. They appear to have been heavily influenced by Elton John (who co-wrote and played piano on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Feel Like Dancin&#x27;&quot;) despite Shears commenting that he was not familiar with his work prior to the release of their record. Shears has since stated that he has become a big fan. The band also has been compared to ABBA, the Bee Gees, Blondie, KC and the Sunshine Band, Duran Duran who were &quot;the reason we got into music,&quot; Matronic stated, Supertramp, Siouxsie and the Banshees who Matronic &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be here without,&quot; David Bowie, 1970s-era Kiss, Queen, Chic, Richard O&#x27;Brien and various other dance, disco, rock, and funk acts. Shears also stated that The Beatles have been an influence for him and that he is a huge fan of Paul McCartney and Wings, hence their track entitled &quot;Paul McCartney&quot;. However, the band admits that their music is hard to categorise.

The lyrics of their songs, largely written by Shears and Babydaddy, are known for their mixture of wit and tragedy. The songs on their debut album dealt with a number of subjects and issues in a variety of styles, from drug abuse within the gay community (&quot;Return to Oz&quot;), to Shears&#x27; deep platonic love for his best friend Mary (&quot;Mary&quot;). Mary died of a brain aneurysm in April 2006, news that devastated members of the band.

Many of Scissor Sisters&#x27; songs deal with themes in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, relating to the fact that three of the band members, including the two founders, are gay. &quot;Filthy/Gorgeous&quot; is about transgender prostitutes while &quot;Take Your Mama&quot; deals with coming out of the closet to family members. Despite this, Shears stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe sexuality really matters when it comes to music.&quot; In an interview featured on the &quot;We Are Scissor Sisters... And So Are You&quot; DVD, Shears states, &quot;The fact that some of us are gay affects our music the same amount as it does that some of the members of Blondie are straight.&quot;

===Performance style===
The visuals for Scissor Sisters&#x27; self-titled first album and its singles featured artwork by an English illustrator named Spookytim, who had a studio in Brighton called Studiospooky. The artwork was created by a wide variety of techniques and mixed traditional paper-based processes with digital and photographic elements in order to reflect the multi-referential nature of the band&#x27;s music.

Scissor Sisters are known for their extravagant live performances. In some of their early shows, Shears was known to remove all of his clothes onstage, harking back to his former profession as a go-go stripper; in others, he threw inflated condoms into the audience.

&quot;Isn&#x27;t It Strange,&quot; a track created during the band&#x27;s recording session for &quot;Night Work&quot;, featured in &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot; (2010).

DJ Earworm&#x27;s 2005 song &quot;No One Takes Your Freedom&quot; combined Scissor Sisters&#x27; &quot;Take Your Mama&quot; with The Beatles&#x27; &quot;For No One&quot;, George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Freedom &#x27;90&quot; and Aretha Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Think&quot;.

<text>Carl Friedrich Heinrich Graf von Wylich und Lottum (5 November 1767 – 14 February 1841), also called Graf Lottum &quot;(Count Lottum)&quot;, was a Prussian infantry general and minister of the State. He was the son of general Friedrich Wilhelm Graf von Wylich und Lottum and his wife.

== Biography ==
Graf Lottum was born in Berlin and visited the Academie des Nobles, the principal educational establishment of the state, founded by Frederick the Great. On 9 April 1784 he became ensign of the Infantry Regiment of Anhalt-Bernburg, and on 26 October 1786 lieutenant. One year later, he was transferred to the newly formed fusilier battalion &quot;von Schenck&quot;, also stationed in Halle. His battalion participated in the Dutch campaign of 1787. Shortly thereafter, as an ordonnance officer, he accompanied general Graf Schulenburg-Renert in the war against France. A fall from his horse in 1793 led to a fracture of his foot and rendered him unusable for field duties.

He was assigned as an assistant to the &quot;Upper War Collegium&quot;, where he remained, raising in his rank, until the treaty of Tilsit in 1807. In the same year he was assigned to hold the &quot;Report of Military Affairs&quot; in front of the king, which should prove to be deciding for his career. During this time, and until the report was passed on to von Scharnhorst, Frederick William III came to know and esteem Graf Lottum.

In his charge as counselor for the king and being the head of the &quot;Reorganization Committee&quot;, he used his influence to strengthen the conservative tendencies in the aristocracy of Prussia. He opposed the admission of officers of civic origin, and fought against the &quot;Landsturm&quot; and the &quot;Städteordnung&quot;.

On 16 December 1808, Graf Lottum was reassigned as the head of the &quot;Military Economy Department&quot;. Then, he left the active military service with the title of Councillor of the State. This did not last long however, as he became general major on 3 February 1810.

In the war of 1812 against Russia, he was sent by the king to Warsaw, to negotiate with Emperor Napoleon the right of passage through Prussian territories. In spring 1813 he was assigned to the &quot;Upper Governmental Commission&quot;, which had to lead most state affairs in the absence of the king.
In 1814 and 1815, Graf Lottum remained mostly in Paris, to manage outstanding payments owed by France. After his return in 1817, he quit the army for a second time. In the following he led the financial affairs for the State Council, for a shorter time the external affairs and the financial affairs for the Ministry of the Interior.

On 3 August 1828, he was appointed General of the Infantry by the king.

Graf Lottum died in Berlin on 14 February 1841, shortly after his wife. He has been characterized as a hard-working, but gentle person without strong political ambitions.

Graf Lottum is an honorary citizen of the city of Berlin. The street Lottumstraße in the district Prenzlauer Berg is named after him.

<text>Spatial tense is a grammatical category that refers to the indication of the place of an event, analogue to the use of the more common category of grammatical tense to indicate the time of an event.

The term &quot;spatial tense&quot; is mostly employed in the grammar of Lojban (an artificial language). In Lojban, temporal and spatial tense are treated alike. When present, they are marked by particles that may appear in different parts of the sentence according to the emphasis the speaker wants to convey. The spatial tense morphemes show position and/or distance relative to the speaker. The difference between spatial tense and the use of words and phrases like &quot;here&quot;, &quot;to the left&quot;, &quot;at a short distance ahead&quot;, etc., lies in the fact that these phrases are simply lexical items, while spatial tense is a grammatical category of the verb (more properly speaking, the predicate).</text><links>

<doc id="730350" wikidata="Q188819" url="?curid=730350" title="Billboard 200">
<text>The Billboard&quot; 200is a [[record chart]] ranking the 200 most popular [[Album|music albums]] and [[extended play|EPs]] in the United States. It is published weekly by &quot;[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]&quot; magazine to convey the popularity of an [[recording artist|artist]] or groups of artists. Sometimes, a recording act is remembered for its &quot;[[chart-topper|number ones]]&quot; that outperformed all other albums during at least one week. The chart grew from a weekly top 10 list in 1956 to become a top 200 list in May 1967, acquiring its existing name in March 1992. Its previous names include the Billboard&quot; Top LPs (1961–1972), Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape(1972–1984), Billboard&quot; Top 200 Albums (1984–1985), Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums(1985–1991), and Billboard&quot; 200 Top Albums (1991–1992).

The chart is based mostly on sales—both at retail and digital – of albums in the United States. The weekly sales period was Monday to Sunday when Nielsen started tracking sales in 1991, but since July 2015, the tracking week begins on Friday (to coincide with the Global Release Day of the music industry) and ends on Thursday. A new chart is published the following Tuesday, post dated to the Saturday of that week, four days later. The chart&#x27;s streaming schedule is also tracked from Friday to Thursday. Digital downloads of albums are included in &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 tabulation. Albums that are not licensed for retail sale in the United States (yet purchased in the U.S. as imports) are not eligible to chart. A long-standing policy rendering titles that are sold exclusively by specific retail outlets (such as Walmart and Starbucks) ineligible for charting, was reversed on November 7, 2007, and took effect in the issue dated November 17, 2007.

On December 13, 2014, &quot;Billboard&quot; began to include on-demand streaming and digital track sales (as measured by Nielsen SoundScan) using a new algorithm with data from all major on-demand audio subscription and online music sales services in the U.S. Starting on the issue dated January 18, 2020, &quot;Billboard&quot; updated its method again by incorporating video data from YouTube, along with visual plays from digital platforms like Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal, Vevo and, as of the issue dated March 23, 2021, from Facebook.

As of the issue dated March 1, 2025, the number-one album on the chart is &quot;Some Sexy Songs 4 U&quot; by PartyNextDoor and Drake.

==History==
&quot;Billboard&quot; began an album chart in 1945. Initially only five positions long, the album chart was not published on a weekly basis, with weeks sometimes passing before it was updated. A biweekly (though with a few gaps), 15-position &quot;Best-Selling Popular Albums&quot; chart appeared in 1955. With the increase in album sales as the early 1950s format wars stabilized into market dominance by 45 RPM singles and long-playing 12-inch albums – and with 78 RPM record and long-playing 10-inch album sales decreasing dramatically – &quot;Billboard&quot; premiered a weekly &quot;Best-Selling Popular Albums&quot; chart on March 24, 1956. The position count varied anywhere from 10 to 30 albums. The first no. 1 album on the new weekly list was &quot;Belafonte&quot; by Harry Belafonte. The chart was renamed &quot;Best-Selling Pop Albums&quot; later in 1956, and then &quot;Best-Selling Pop LPs&quot; in 1957.

Beginning on May 25, 1959, &quot;Billboard&quot; split the ranking into two charts: &quot;Best-Selling Stereophonic LPs&quot; for stereo albums (30 positions) and &quot;Best-Selling Monophonic LPs&quot; for mono albums (50 positions). These were renamed &quot;Stereo Action Charts&quot; (30 positions) and &quot;Mono Action Charts&quot; (40 positions), respectively, in 1960. In January 1961, they became &quot;Action Albums – Stereophonic&quot; (15 positions) and &quot;Action Albums – Monophonic&quot; (25 positions), and three months later, they became &quot;Top LPs – Stereo&quot; (50 positions) and &quot;Top LPs – Monaural&quot; (150 positions).

On August 17, 1963, the stereo and mono charts were combined into a 150-position chart called &quot;Top LPs&quot;. On April 1, 1967, the chart was expanded to 175 positions, and then finally to 200 positions on May 13, 1967. In February 1972, the album chart&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;Top LPs &amp; Tape&quot;; in 1984, it was retitled &quot;Top 200 Albums&quot;; in 1985, it was retitled again to &quot;Top Pop Albums&quot;; in 1991, it became the &quot;&quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Top Albums&quot;; and it was given its current title of the &quot;&quot;Billboard&quot; 200&quot; on March 14, 1992.

From the end of 1970 to 1985, &quot;Billboard&quot; also printed a &quot;Bubbling Under the Top LPs&quot; albums chart paired with the &quot;Bubbling Under the Hot 100&quot; singles chart, which listed albums that had not yet charted on what was then the &quot;Top LPs &amp; Tape&quot; chart.

===Catalog albums===
In 1960, &quot;Billboard&quot; began concurrently publishing album charts that ranked sales of older or mid-priced titles. These &quot;Essential Inventory&quot; charts were divided by stereo and mono albums, and featured titles that had already appeared on the main stereo and mono album charts. Mono albums were moved to the &quot;Essential Inventory – Mono&quot; chart (25 positions) after spending 40 weeks on the &quot;Mono Action Chart&quot;, and stereo albums were moved to the &quot;Essential Inventory – Stereo&quot; chart (20 positions) after 20 weeks on the &quot;Stereo Action Chart&quot;.

In January 1961, the &quot;Action Charts&quot; became &quot;Action Albums – Stereophonic&quot; (15 positions) and &quot;Action Albums – Monophonic&quot; (24 positions). Albums appeared on either chart for up to nine weeks, and were then moved to an &quot;Essential Inventory&quot; list of approximately 200 titles and with no numerical ranking. This list continued to be published until the consolidated &quot;Top LPs&quot; chart debuted in 1963.

In 1982, &quot;Billboard&quot; began publishing a &quot;Midline Albums&quot; chart (alternatively titled &quot;Midline LPs&quot;), which ranked older or mid-priced titles. The chart held 50 positions and was published on a biweekly (and later triweekly) basis.

On May 25, 1991, &quot;Billboard&quot; premiered the &quot;Top Pop Catalog Albums&quot; chart, the criteria for which were albums that were more than 18 months old and had fallen below no. 100 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

&quot;Both &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot; should be in the Billboard Top 200,&quot; said former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters in 1992. &quot;&quot;The Wall&quot; still does anything up to four million each year... They&#x27;ve created a catalog chart in which to place all these old albums, leaving the main chart free for all the artists the record companies will want to book advertising space for. It just offers further evidence of the dishonesty that&#x27;s rife in this business.&quot;

Starting with the issue dated December 5, 2009, however, the catalog limitations – which removed albums over 18 months old that had dropped below No. 100 and had no currently running singles – for the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 were lifted, turning the chart into an all-inclusive list of the 200 highest-selling albums in the country (essentially changing &quot;Top Comprehensive Albums&quot; into the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200). A new chart that keeps the previous criteria for the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 – dubbed the &quot;Top Current Albums&quot; chart – was also introduced in the same issue.

===Holiday albums===
&quot;Billboard&quot; has adjusted its policies for Christmas and holiday albums several times. The albums were eligible for the main album charts until 1963, when a &quot;Christmas Albums&quot; chart was created. Albums appearing here were not listed on the &quot;Top LPs&quot; chart, and in 1974, this rule was reverted and holiday albums again appeared within the main list.

In 1983, the &quot;Christmas Albums&quot; chart was resurrected, but a title&#x27;s appearance here did not disqualify it from appearing on the &quot;Top Pop Albums&quot; chart. In 1990, the chart was retitled &quot;Top Holiday Albums&quot;; , it holds 50 positions and runs for several weeks during the end-of-calendar-year holiday season. Its current policy allows holiday albums to concurrently chart on the &quot;Top Holiday Albums&quot; list and the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

===Nielsen SoundScan===
Since May 25, 1991, the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200&#x27;s positions have been derived from Nielsen SoundScan sales data; , it is contributed to by approximately 14,000 music sellers. Because these numbers are supplied by a subset of sellers rather than record labels, it is common for these numbers to be substantially lower than those reported by the Recording Industry Association of America when Gold, Platinum and Diamond album awards are announced. (RIAA awards reflect wholesale &quot;shipments&quot;, not retail &quot;sales&quot;.)

===Incorporation of streaming data and track sales===
Beginning with the December 13, 2014, issue, &quot;Billboard&quot; updated the methodology of its album chart again, changing from a &quot;pure sales-based ranking&quot; to one measuring &quot;multi-metric consumption&quot;. With this overhaul, the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 includes on-demand streaming and digital track sales (as measured by Nielsen SoundScan) by way of a new algorithm, utilizing data from all of the major on-demand audio subscription services, including Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play and Groove Music. Under the new methodology, 10 track sales or 1,500 song streams from an album are treated as equivalent to one purchase of the album. &quot;Billboard&quot; continues to publish a pure album sales chart, called &quot;Top Album Sales&quot;, that maintains the traditional &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 methodology but is based exclusively on SoundScan&#x27;s sales data.

Beginning on January 18, 2020, &quot;Billboard&quot; incorporated video and audio data from YouTube, along with visual plays from streaming services like Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal and Vevo, into the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The change has also impacted &quot;Billboard&quot; genre-specific album charts.

==Year-end charts==
&quot;Billboard&quot; &quot;chart year&quot; runs from the first week of December to the final week in November. This altered calendar allows for &quot;Billboard&quot; to calculate year-end charts and release them in time for its final print issue in the last week of December. Prior to Nielsen SoundScan, year-end charts were calculated by an inverse-point system based solely on an album&#x27;s performance on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (e.g., an album would be given one point for a week spent at No. 200, two points for a week spent at No. 199, etc., up to 200 points for each week spent at No. 1). Other factors, including an album&#x27;s total weeks spent on the chart and its peak position, are calculated into an album&#x27;s year-end total.

Since &quot;Billboard&quot; began obtaining sales information from Nielsen SoundScan, the year-end charts are now calculated by a very straightforward cumulative total of yearlong sales. This gives a more accurate picture of any given year&#x27;s best-selling albums, as a title that hypothetically spent nine weeks at No. 1 in March could possibly have sold fewer copies than one spending six weeks at No. 3 in January. Albums at the peak of their popularity at the time of the November/December chart-year cutoff many times end up ranked lower than one would expect on a year-end tally, yet are ranked on the following year&#x27;s chart as well, as their cumulative points are split between the two chart-years.

==All-Time &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 achievements (1963–2015)==
In 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; compiled a ranking of the 100 best-performing albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 over its 52 years, along with the best-performing artists. Shown below are the top 10 albums and top 10 artists over the 52-year period of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, through October 2015. Also shown are the artists placing the most albums on the overall &quot;all-time&quot; top 100 album list.

Notes:
* The album &quot;Music to Be Murdered By&quot; by Eminem has the largest rise for an album that did not top the chart; on January 2, 2021, it jumped from number 199 the previous week to number 3 on the chart.
* The mixtape &quot;Days Before Rodeo&quot; by Travis Scott dropped off the chart entirely after reaching number one the previous week (October 5, 2024), becoming the first project to do so.
* The album &quot;Hello from Las Vegas&quot; by Lionel Richie dropped off the chart entirely without ever reaching the top spot; on September 7, 2019, it exited the chart after debuting at number 2 the previous week.

===Longest climbs to number one in the SoundScan era===
Here are the albums to complete the 10 longest rises to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 since the adoption of Nielsen Music data in 1991.

* &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot; by Paula Abdul spent 64 consecutive weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 before hitting number one in 1989, making it the longest time spent on the chart before reaching the number one spot.

===Albums to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 by artists who have never appeared on the Hot 100===

Note: Newhart, Meader and Fontaine&#x27;s albums were all number one on the mono chart but not on the stereo chart. Garland is listed on a technicality; she has 17 pop hits, but all were from 1939 to 1955 – all before the 1958 establishment of the Hot 100. 

===EPs to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200===

==Additional milestones==
* The first album to debut at number one was &quot;Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy&quot; by Elton John. John repeated the same feat with the album &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot; – the second album to debut at number one – making John the first artist to have two consecutive studio albums debut at number one. Whitney Houston&#x27;s second album, &quot;Whitney&quot;, was the first album by a female artist to debut at number one.
* In the early 1960s, Bob Newhart accomplished the feat of having the number one and number two albums simultaneously on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart, with &quot;The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart&quot; and &quot;The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!&quot; This was equaled by the Beatles multiple times: twice in 1964 with &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; and &quot;Introducing... The Beatles&quot;, and then with &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and &quot;Something New&quot;, followed in 1969 by the album &quot;The Beatles&quot; (commonly known as &quot;The White Album&quot;) and the soundtrack for the film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. In 1991, Guns N&#x27; Roses held the top two with &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;; in 2004, Nelly&#x27;s &quot;Suit&quot; and &quot;Sweat&quot;; and in 2017, Future&#x27;s &quot;Future&quot; and &quot;Hndrxx&quot;.
* &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; set the record of 109 non-consecutive weeks in the top 10 from May 1, 1965, to July 16, 1966, but only spent two weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.
* The first U.K. solo artist to debut at number one with a debut album is Leona Lewis on April 26, 2008, with the album &quot;Spirit&quot;. The first U.K. group to debut at No. 1 with a debut album is One Direction on March 31, 2012, with the album &quot;Up All Night&quot;.

Subsequently, Bieber () became the youngest solo artist to achieve seven No. 1 albums on the chart with &quot;Changes&quot;, breaking a 59-year-old record set by Elvis Presley at the age of 26. He further extended his record, after turning 27, by becoming the youngest soloist to have eight albums top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, following the release of his sixth studio album, &quot;Justice&quot;, breaking yet another chart record held by Elvis Presley at the age of 29.
* Tony Bennett became the oldest male to debut at number one on October 8, 2011 ( old), with the album &quot;Duets II&quot;. Bennett, who was born on August 3, 1926, later surpassed his own record when his collaborative album with Lady Gaga, &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot;, debuted at number one on October 11, 2014 ( old).
* The issue dated July 11, 2009, was the first time any catalog album outsold the number one album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Three of Michael Jackson&#x27;s albums – &quot;Number Ones&quot;, &quot;The Essential Michael Jackson&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot; – claimed positions 1–3, respectively, on &quot;Top Pop Catalog Albums&quot; and &quot;Top Comprehensive Albums&quot; in the week following Jackson&#x27;s death.

* Jackie Gleason, at least for a time, held the record for the most albums to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 without charting any songs in the top 40 of the Hot 100; five of Gleason&#x27;s mood music albums topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the mid-1950s.

<text>Luigi Colani (born Lutz Colani; 2 August 1928 – 16 September 2019) was a German industrial designer.

His long career began in the 1950s when he designed cars for companies including Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Volkswagen, and BMW. In 1957, he dropped his first name &quot;Lutz&quot; using the name &quot;Luigi&quot;. In the 1960s, he began designing furniture, and as of the 1970s, he expanded in numerous areas, ranging from household items such as ballpoint pens and television sets to uniforms and trucks and entire kitchens. A striking grand piano created by Colani, the &quot;Pegasus&quot;, is manufactured and sold by the Schimmel piano company.

His unconventional designs made him famous, not only in design circles, but also to the general public. He received numerous design awards, although his unconventional approach left him largely an outsider from the mainstream of industrial design.

== Style ==
The prime characteristic of his designs are the rounded, organic forms, which he terms &quot;biodynamic&quot; and claims are ergonomically superior to traditional designs. His &quot;kitchen satellite&quot; from 1969 is the most prominent example of this school of thought. Many of his designs for small appliances are being mass-produced and marketed, but his larger designs have not been built, &quot;a whole host of futuristic concepts that will have us living in pods and driving cars so flat that leg amputation is the only option.&quot;

== Life and career ==
Born in Berlin, Colani was the son of a Swiss film set designer and a mother of Polish descent.

=== 1950s ===

By 1953, he was living in California where he was Head of New Materials project group at McDonnell Douglas in California.

Moving to auto design, in 1954, he received the Golden Rose international prize for creation and design, in Geneva, Switzerland, for special Fiat bodywork; he would be the originator of many Fiat designs in the coming years. A constant innovator, by 1958 he was also interested in sailing vessels. His catamaran design was a racing success in Hawaii.

Returning to cars, in 1963 he introduced the world&#x27;s first plastic monocoque sports car, based on the BMW 700, and in 1960 the world&#x27;s first kit car in series, the Colani GT, which sold 1,700 copies. In 1966 he showed his sports coupe design at the IAA in Frankfurt.

===1960s===
By the 1960s, his design range had also expanded to include household objects and furniture, beginning in 1963 with his elephant piggy bank, and in 1965 he gained worldwide success with furniture designs for Asko, Fritz-Hansen (Körperform chairs), Cor, and Kusch+Co. He also rebodied an Abarth Alfa Romeo design, based on two wrecked Abarth 1000 GT Coupés in the early 1960s.

In 1968, for Thai Airlines, he developed a two piece plastic cutlery set which the Museum of Design, Zürich, added to its collection.

===1970s===
He had developed a sufficient reputation and income by 1970 to establish a studio with a major design team at Harkotten Castle near Sassenberg, Germany. The studio was an enormous success, with work and exhibitions worldwide for many major companies. Meanwhile, he continued with his innovations in car design, including his 1972 design of the Eifelland Formula One car.

This period saw him making his first forays into the Japanese market, when he obtained contracts from Japanese companies for the first time. In 1973, he made his first study trip to the Far East, during which Japanese buyers recognized Colani&#x27;s potential. He received invitations by five companies to establish a Colani Design Center Japan.

About this time, the &quot;Drop&quot; teapot he designed for Rosenthal, a world leader in porcelain, was acquired for inclusion in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York. In 1999, Rosenthal promoted a special edition of his now-famous design.

In 1974, Colani designed the for Melitta. It was manufactured by the Melitta-owned porcelain manufacturer Friesland Porzellan since 1981.

Not all of his designs were successes. For example, he created an unsuccessful design for an Olympic row boat. About this time, in the early 1970s he developed his first streamlined truck design, which he said, &quot;was a direct response to the world oil crisis yet nobody noticed my design. They didn&#x27;t get the message.&quot; He would revisit streamlined trucks later in the decade to more fanfare.

Colani&#x27;s first profession as an aeronautics designer was revisited in 1976 when he was assigned the task of designing the RFB Fanliner, the first plastic sports airplane with a Wankel rotary engine. Later, in 1985, he unveiled the Pontresina propeller-driven airplane, having two contra-rotating coaxial pusher propellers with scimitar blades mounted in the tail. The propellers, also known as &quot;centripetal supersonic propellers&quot;, were a new design idea. The plane was a design study and is not airworthy.

By 1978, his revolutionary trucks, aircraft, car and ship studies had begun to be seen frequently at exhibitions worldwide. His interest in fuel economy continued into the 1980s. In 1981, he set a fuel economy world record set with the four-seater Colani 2CV (based on the French Citroën 2CV which consumed just 1.7 litres of gasoline to travel 100 km using a stock 2CV engine and chassis.
===1980s===

The year 1982 saw Colani relocating to Japan, where a year later he accepted a position as professor in Tokyo.

For Canon, he developed the &quot;5 Systems&quot; camera prototypes and in 1984, he was voted the No. 1 industrial designer in Japan at the Otaru exhibition for his 60 m large shell. In 1986, he received the Golden Camera Award for the Canon T90.

In 1985, his Robot Theater was the most-attended pavilion at Expo &#x27;85.

In 1986, one of his motorcycles set a world record in Italy. That year, he founded Colani Design Bern in Switzerland.

<doc id="730360" wikidata="Q3735641" url="?curid=730360" title="Friday (Robinson Crusoe)">
<text>Friday is one of the main characters of Daniel Defoe&#x27;s 1719 novel &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&quot;. Robinson Crusoe names the man Friday, with whom he cannot at first communicate, because they first meet on that day. The character is the source of the expression &quot;Man Friday&quot;, used to describe a male personal assistant or servant, especially one who is particularly competent or loyal.

It is possible that a Miskito pirate by the name of Will became the inspiration for the character &quot;Friday&quot;.

==Character==
Robinson Crusoe spends twenty-eight years on an island off the coast of Venezuela with his talking parrot Poll, his pet dog, and a tame goat as his only companions. In his twenty-fifth year, he discovers that Carib cannibals occasionally use a desolate beach on the island to kill and eat their captives.

Crusoe helps one of the captives escape his captors. Crusoe ambushes two pursuers, and the others leave in their canoes without knowing what happened to their companions. The escaped captive bows in gratitude to Crusoe, who decides to employ him as a servant. He names him Friday after the weekday upon which the rescue takes place.

Crusoe describes Friday as being a Native American, though very unlike the Indians of Brazil and Virginia. His religion involves the worship of a mountain god named Benamuckee, officiated over by high priests called Oowokakee. Crusoe learned a few of his native words that have been found in a Spanish-Térraba (or Teribe) dictionary, so Friday may have belonged to that tribe, also called the Naso people. Friday is cannibal as well and suggests eating the men Crusoe has killed.

Crusoe teaches Friday the English language and converts him to Christianity. He convinces him that cannibalism is wrong. Friday accompanies him in an ambush in which they save Friday&#x27;s father.

Crusoe returns to England twenty-eight years after being shipwrecked on that island, and four years after rescuing Friday. Friday&#x27;s father goes with a Spanish castaway to the mainland to retrieve fourteen other Spanish castaways, but Crusoe and Friday depart the island before they return.

Friday accompanies Crusoe home to England and is his companion in the sequel &quot;The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe&quot;, in which Friday is killed in a sea battle.

In Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;École des Robinsons&quot; (1882), the castaways rescue an African man on their island who says his name is Carefinotu. T. Artelett proposes to call him Mercredi (&quot;Wednesday&quot;), &quot;as it is always done in the islands with Robinsons,&quot; but his master Godfrey prefers to keep the original name.

==Film and television adaptations==
*The 1935 Mickey Mouse cartoon &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Man Friday&quot; features Mickey as Crusoe, with Friday and other islanders as humanized monkey characters.
*The 1935 Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoon &quot;Robinson Crusoe Isle&quot; features Oswald applying for a job as Robinson Crusoe&#x27;s &quot;man Friday&quot;. Crusoe&#x27;s twelve previous Fridays have been eaten by cannibals, making Oswald &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;.
*The 1946 &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; cartoon &quot;The Island Fling&quot; features Bluto as Crusoe, with Friday, as well as Saturday, Sunday and Monday at the end, as humanized monkey characters.
*In Luis Buñuel&#x27;s 1954 film &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, Jaime Fernández played Friday alongside Dan O&#x27;Herlihy as Crusoe.
*In the 1990s animated series &quot;Robinson Sucroe&quot;, a parody of Robinson Crusoe, the island Sucroe lands on is heavily populated by friendly natives, all of whom are named after days of the week and times of day (e.g. &quot;Tuesday Dawn&quot;) as a reference to Friday.
*The 1964 film &quot;Robinson Crusoe on Mars&quot; recasts the Robinson Crusoe story as a space adventure. Victor Lundin played the rescued companion of Crusoe figure Commander Christopher Draper (Paul Mantee), who dubs him &quot;Friday&quot; in reference to the novel.
*In the 1966 Walt Disney film &quot;Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.&quot;, Friday became a beautiful woman, and was named &#x27;Wednesday&#x27; instead. The character was played by Nancy Kwan. Dick Van Dyke was cast as Crusoe.
*In the 1968 American family film &quot;Robby&quot;, Ryp Siani played Friday to Warren Raum&#x27;s Robby. In choosing his principal actors, writer/director Ralph C. Bluemke first cast ten-year-old Siani in the role of Friday. He was already a seasoned child actor at the time, having been brought up in a show business family, and appearing in television commercials since early childhood.
*In the 1970 Mexican film &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and its 1973 sequel &quot;Robinson y Viernes en la Isla Encantada (Robinson and Friday on the Enchanted Island)&quot;, Ahui Camacho played Friday to Hugo Stiglitz&#x27; Crusoe. This is the second time a child actor portrays the character and is shown fully nude (only in the first film).
*&quot;Man Friday&quot;, a 1975 British film, retold the story from Man Friday&#x27;s point of view. It starred Richard Roundtree as Man Friday and Peter O&#x27;Toole as Crusoe.

*In the 1982 Norwegian TV series &quot;Brødrene Dal og spektralsteinene&quot;, in episode number 5 in a parody called &quot;Robinson Caruso&quot;, Friday was called &quot;Langfredag (Good Friday)&quot; and played by Knut Lystad.
*One of the first season episodes of the 1996 Spanish animated series &quot;The Triplets&quot; is an adaptation of Robinson Crusoe. In this episode, The Bored Witch disguises herself as a native, playing the role of Friday to get closer to Robinson and the triplets.
*In the 1997 film version of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, William Takaku played Friday to Pierce Brosnan&#x27;s Crusoe.
*In the 2008 American TV series &quot;Crusoe&quot;, Friday was played by Tongayi Chirisa.

==Idiom==

The term Man Friday became an idiom to describe an especially faithful servant or one&#x27;s best servant or right-hand man. The female equivalent is &quot;Girl Friday.&quot; The July 1, 1912, edition of the news magazine &quot;Industrial World&quot;, volume 46, issue 2, published in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, uses the term &quot;Girl Friday&quot;. The title of the 1940 movie &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; alludes to it.

==Reception==
Friday&#x27;s relationship with Robinson Crusoe has been the subject of academic analysis.

<text>[[Canoeing]] at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] was held at the Sydney International Regatta Centre for the sprint events and the Whitewater Stadium in Penrith for the canoe and kayak slalom disciplines. The repechage rounds that ran from the 1960 to the 1996 Games were eliminated in the sprint events while qualifying rounds were added to the slalom events. Additionally, a quota system for each event was enacted, meaning each event had a limited number of competitors that could compete.

A total of 16 events were contested, 12 sprint events (9 for men and 3 for women) and 4 slalom events (3 for men and 1 for women).

<doc id="730369" wikidata="Q652568" url="?curid=730369" title="Argyll Robertson pupil">
<text>Argyll Robertson pupils (AR pupils) are bilateral small pupils that reduce in size on a near object (i.e., they accommodate), but do &quot;not&quot; constrict when exposed to bright light (i.e., they do not react). They are a highly specific sign of neurosyphilis; however, Argyll Robertson pupils may also be a sign of diabetic neuropathy. In general, pupils that accommodate but do not react are said to show light-near dissociation (i.e., it is the absence of a miotic reaction to light, both direct and consensual, with the preservation of a miotic reaction to near stimulus (accommodation/convergence)).

AR pupils are extremely uncommon in the developed world. There is continued interest in the underlying pathophysiology, but the scarcity of cases makes ongoing research difficult.

==Pathophysiology==
The two different types of near response are caused by different underlying disease processes. &quot;Adie&#x27;s pupil&quot; is caused by damage to &quot;peripheral&quot; pathways to the pupil (parasympathetic neurons in the ciliary ganglion that cause pupillary constriction to bright light &quot;and&quot; with near vision). The pathophysiologic mechanism which produces an Argyll Robertson pupil is unclear, but is believed to be the result of bilateral damage to the pretectal nuclei in the midbrain. Studies have failed to demonstrate a focal localising lesion. Research has implicated the rostral midbrain in the vicinity of the cerebral aqueduct of the third ventricle as the most likely region of damage. A lesion in this area would involve efferent pupillary fibres on the dorsal aspect of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (associated with the response to light) while sparing the fibres associated with the response to near, which lie slightly more ventrally.
The exact relationship between syphilis and the two types of pupils (&quot;AR pupils&quot; and &quot;tonic pupils&quot;) is not known at the present time. The older literature on AR pupils did not report the details of pupillary constriction (brisk vs. tonic) that are necessary to distinguish AR pupils from tonic pupils. Tonic pupils can occur in neurosyphilis. It is not known whether neurosyphilis itself (infection by &quot;Treponema pallidum&quot;) can cause tonic pupils, or whether tonic pupils in syphilis simply reflect a coexisting peripheral neuropathy.

Thompson and Kardon summarize the present view:

:: The evidence supports a midbrain cause of the AR pupil, provided one follows Loewenfeld’s definition of the AR pupil as small pupils that react very poorly to light and yet seem to retain a normal pupillary near response that is definitely not tonic.

:: To settle the question of whether the AR pupil is of central or peripheral origin, it will be necessary to perform iris transillumination (or a magnified slit-lamp examination) in a substantial number of patients who have a pupillary light-near dissociation (with and without tonicity of the near reaction), perhaps in many parts of the world.

===Parinaud syndrome===
A third cause of light-near dissociation is Parinaud syndrome, also called dorsal midbrain syndrome. This uncommon syndrome involves vertical gaze palsy associated with pupils that “accommodate but do not react.&quot; The causes of Parinaud syndrome include brain tumors (pinealomas), multiple sclerosis and brainstem infarction.

Due to the lack of detail in the older literature and the scarcity of AR pupils at the present time, it is not known whether syphilis can cause Parinaud syndrome. It is not known whether AR pupils are any different from the pupils seen in other dorsal midbrain lesions.

The condition is diagnosed clinically by a physician.

==Treatment==

There is no definite treatment, but, because syphilis may be an underlying cause, it should be treated.
However, because this sign is associated with neurosyphilis, it should be treated with crystalline penicillin 24 mU intravenous per day for 10 to 14 days. If the patient is allergic to penicillin, they should undergo desensitization and then be treated.

==History==
Argyll Robertson pupils were named after Douglas Argyll Robertson (1837–1909), a Scottish ophthalmologist and surgeon who described the condition in the mid-1860s in the context of neurosyphilis.

In the early 20th century, William John Adie described a second type of pupil that could &quot;accommodate but not react&quot;. Adie&#x27;s tonic pupil is usually associated with a benign peripheral neuropathy (Adie syndrome), not with syphilis.

When penicillin became widely available in the 1940s, the prevalence of AR pupils (which develop only after decades of untreated infection) decreased dramatically. AR pupils are now quite rare. A patient whose pupil &quot;accommodates but does not react&quot; almost always has a tonic pupil, not an AR pupil.

In the 1950s, Loewenfeld distinguished between the two types of pupils by carefully observing the exact way in which the pupils constrict with near vision. The near response in &quot;AR pupils&quot; is brisk and immediate. The near response in &quot;tonic pupils&quot; is slow and prolonged.

<text>The myenteric plexus (or [[Leopold Auerbach|Auerbach]]&#x27;s plexus) provides motor innervation to both layers of the muscular layer of the gut, having both parasympathetic and sympathetic input (although present ganglion cell bodies belong to parasympathetic innervation, fibers from sympathetic innervation also reach the plexus), whereas the submucous plexus provides secretomotor innervation to the mucosa nearest the lumen of the gut.

It arises from cells in the vagal trigone also known as the nucleus ala cinerea, the parasympathetic nucleus of origin for the tenth cranial nerve (vagus nerve), located in the medulla oblongata. The fibers are carried by both the anterior and posterior vagal nerves. The myenteric plexus is the major nerve supply to the gastrointestinal tract and controls GI tract motility.

According to preclinical studies, 30% of myenteric plexus&#x27; neurons are enteric sensory neurons, thus Auerbach&#x27;s plexus has also a sensory component.

==Structure==
A part of the enteric nervous system, the myenteric plexus exists between the longitudinal and circular layers of muscularis externa in the gastrointestinal tract. It is found in the muscles of the esophagus, stomach, and intestine.

The ganglia have properties similar to the central nervous system (CNS). These properties include presence of glia, interneurons, a small extracellular space, dense synaptic neuropil, isolation from blood vessels, multiple synaptic mechanisms and multiple neurotransmitters.

The myenteric plexus originates in the medulla oblongata as a collection of neurons from the ventral part of the brain stem. The vagus nerve then carries the axons to their destination in the gastrointestinal tract.

They contain Dogiel cells.

==Function==
The myenteric plexus functions as a part of the enteric nervous system (digestive system). The enteric nervous system can and does function autonomously, but normal digestive function requires communication links between this intrinsic system and the central nervous system. The ENS contains sensory receptors, primary afferent neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons. The events that are controlled, at least in part, by the ENS are multiple and include motor activity, secretion, absorption, blood flow, and interaction with other organs such as the gallbladder or pancreas. These links take the form of parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers that connect either the central and enteric nervous systems or connect the central nervous system directly with the digestive tract. Through these cross connections, the gut can provide sensory information to the CNS, and the CNS can affect gastrointestinal function. Connection to the central nervous system also means that signals from outside of the digestive system can be relayed to the digestive system: for instance, the sight of appealing food stimulates secretion in the stomach.

===Neurotransmitters===
The enteric nervous system makes use of over 30 different neurotransmitters, most similar to those of the CNS such as acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin. More than 90% of the body&#x27;s serotonin lies in the gut; as well as about 50% of the body&#x27;s dopamine, which is currently being studied to further our understanding of its utility in the brain.
The heavily studied neuropeptide known as substance P is present in significant levels and may help facilitate the production of saliva, smooth muscle contractions, and other tissue responses.

====Receptors====
Since many of the same neurotransmitters are found in the ENS as the brain, it follows that myenteric neurons can express receptors for both peptide and non-peptide (amines, amino acids, purines) neurotransmitters. Generally, expression of a receptor is limited to a subset of myenteric neurons, with probably the only exception being expression of nicotinic cholinergic receptors on all myenteric neurons. One receptor that has been targeted for therapeutic reasons has been the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT4) receptor. Activating this pre-synaptic receptor enhances cholinergic neurotransmission and can stimulate gastrointestinal motility.

The enteric nervous system exhibits taste receptors similar to the ones in the tongue. The taste receptor TAS1R3 and the taste G protein gustducin are two of the most common. These receptors sense &quot;sweetness&quot; on the tongue and sense glucose in the enteric nervous system. These receptors help regulate the secretion of insulin and other hormones that are responsible for controlling blood sugar levels.

==Clinical significance==
Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease is a congenital disorder of the colon in which nerve cells of the myenteric plexus in its walls, also known as ganglion cells, are absent. Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease is a form of functional low bowel obstruction due to failure of caudal migration of neuroblasts within developing bowel – this results in an absence of parasympathetic intrinsic ganglion cells in both Auerbach&#x27;s and Meissner&#x27;s plexuses. The distal large
bowel from the point of neuronal arrest to the anus is continuously aganglionic. It is a rare disorder (1:5000), with prevalence among males being four times that of females.

Achalasia is a motor disorder of the esophagus characterized by decrease in ganglion cell density in the myenteric plexus. The cause of the lesion is unknown. 

Myenteric plexi destruction has been found to be secondary to Chagas disease (T. cruzi infection sequelae). Destruction occurs in the esophagus, intestines, and ureters. This denervation can lead to secondary achalasia (lower esophageal sphincter will not open; loss of inhibitory neurons), megacolon, and megaureter, respectively.

===Role in CNS disorders===
Because the ENS is known as the &quot;brain of the gut&quot;, due to its similarities with the CNS, researchers have been using colonic biopsies of Parkinson&#x27;s patients to help better understand and manage Parkinson&#x27;s disease. PD patients are known to experience severe constipation due to GI tract dysfunction years before the onset of motor movement complications, which characterises Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==History==
Leopold Auerbach, a neuropathologist, was one of the first to further research the nervous system using histological staining methods.

<text>Operation Arctic Fox (German: &quot;Unternehmen Polarfuchs&quot;; ; Russian: &quot;Кандалакшская операция&quot;) was the codename given to a World War II campaign by German and Finnish forces against Soviet Northern Front defenses at Salla, Murmansk Oblast, in July 1941. The operation was part of the larger Operation Silver Fox (&quot;Silberfuchs&quot;; ) which aimed to capture the vital port of Murmansk. Arctic Fox was conducted in parallel to Operation Platinum Fox (&quot;Platinfuchs&quot;; ) in the far north of Lappland. The principal goal of Operation Arctic Fox was to capture the town of Salla and then to advance in the direction of Kandalaksha (Finnish: Kantalahti) to block the railway route to Murmansk.

As a joint operation by German and Finnish forces, it combined experienced Finnish arctic troops with relatively unsuitable German forces from Norway. They managed to capture Salla after fierce fighting, but the German troops were unable to overcome the old, pre-war Soviet border fortifications further east. The Finnish units were able to make better progress, and came to within of the Murmansk railway. Strong Soviet reinforcements prevented any further advance. Because of the escalating situation further south in Central Russia, the Germans were unwilling to assign more units to this theatre, calling an end to their offensive. With the Finns unwilling to continue the attack on their own, Arctic Fox ended in November 1941, when both sides dug in at their current positions.

==Background==
The German High Command (OKW) included Finland in its plan for its major offensive against the Soviet Union: Operation Barbarossa. A joint Finnish-German offensive named Operation Silver Fox was planned to support the Germany&#x27;s main effort in central Russia. The goal of &quot;Silver Fox&quot; was to capture or disable the port of Murmansk, which was to be a major destination for Western Allied shipping aid to the Soviet Union, by executing a pincer attack against it. The southern pincer of the attack was named Operation Arctic Fox and was launched from the Kemijärvi region of Central Finland against the defenses at Salla. 

Salla was occupied by the Soviets during the invasion of Finland in 1939. German XXXVI Corps, consisting of both German and Finnish troops, was the main German force of the operation. The corps was commanded by General Hans Feige and was subordinate to the Army of Norway which was commanded by Nikolaus von Falkenhorst. XXXVI Corps was supported by Finnish III Corps commanded by Hjalmar Siilasvuo.

==Planning and Preparation==
Planning for the operation started in December 1940. Erich Buschenhagen, chief of staff of Army of Norway, visited Finland and drew up a plan which would determine Finland&#x27;s role in the war, including the first draft of German-Finnish joint operations against the Soviet Union. On 8 December 1940 Hitler issued &quot;Directive No. 21&quot;, which detailed his plan for Operation Barbarossa as whole and included the targets for proposed German-Finnish cooperation. The detailed operational plan was created by Nikolaus von Falkenhorst with Army of Norway staff in January 1941.

German units assigned to the operation were transported to the Arctic in successive operations &quot;Blue Fox 1&quot; and &quot;Blue Fox 2&quot;. The 169th Division and Feige&#x27;s headquarters were transported by ship and train to Rovaniemi. From there they joined Finnish forces and took position for the offensive under the guise of border exercises. The SS-Infantry &quot;Kampfgruppe Nord&quot; was created, consisting of the 6th and 7th Motorized SS Infantry Regiments, two artillery battalions, and one reconnaissance battalion. This unit was primarily an untrained police unit and unsuited for arctic warfare. During transit from Norway to Finland a transport ship caught fire and 110 soldiers died. The unit was renamed the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord and was led by General Demelhuber. Two small Panzer units were attached to the force: Panzer-Abteilung 211 which used captured French tanks (Hotchkiss H39), and Panzer-Abteilung 40 which consisted mainly of Panzer I and Panzer II (and a small reinforcement of Panzer III) tanks.

The goal of the operation was to take Salla, and then to proceed eastward along the railway to capture Kandalaksha, and to cut the Murmansk Railway line which connected Murmansk with Russia. To accomplish this, the German-Finnish forces advanced in two main groups: one led by the XXXVI Corps in the north, and one by the Finnish III Corps in the south. For XXXVI Corps part, the 169th Division advanced in a three-pronged, frontal attack against the defense line along the Tenniö River. Further south the Finnish 6th Division attempted a flanking operation into the Soviet rear from Kuusamo. They had to advance through difficult terrain to the northeast and capture the towns of Alakurtti and Kayraly (&quot;Kairala&quot;). Finnish III Corps was placed under the command of &quot;Army High Command Norway&quot; for the operation. There they would meet up with the German divisions. Both divisions were supported by the 6th SS Mountain Division that advanced in the centre along the Salla – Kandalaksha road in a frontal assault against the defensive line.

Further south, the Finnish 3rd Division launched an attack, the goal being to cut the Murmansk supply-lines at Loukhi and Kem. For this the 3rd Division was split into two battlegroups. &quot;Group J&quot; advanced from south of Kuusamo to take Kestenga (&quot;Kiestinki&quot;), while &quot;Group F&quot; attacked from Suomussalmi to capture Ukhta.

Aerial support for the offensive was provided by Luftflotte 5 and the Finnish Air Force. The Luftwaffe created a new headquarters for the operation and moved it into Finland. The Finnish air force fielded about 230 aircraft of various types. Luftflotte 5 assigned 60 planes to &quot;Silver Fox&quot; and used Junkers Ju 87, Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 aircraft for ground support.

The Soviets were less prepared. While they anticipated a German invasion, with possible Finnish support, Stalin did not expect an attack along the entire border so early. The border was heavily fortified, but Soviet leadership was unprepared for the German attack. The formation opposing &quot;Silver Fox&quot; was the Northern Front, consisting of the 7th and 14th Armies. They were commanded by Lieutenant-General Markian Popov. On 23 August 1941, the Northern Front was split up into the Karelian Front and the Leningrad Front, commanded by Valerian Frolov and Popov. Frolov remained in command of the Karelian Front until 1 September, when he was promoted and replaced by Roman Panin. During the first weeks the Axis would have a numerical superiority, as the Soviets only had 150,000 men north of Lake Ladoga along the border.

The Axis had air superiority as Soviet Karelia was protected by the 1st and 55th Mixed Air Divisions, totaling 273 aircraft, many outclassed by their enemy. This situation was partly alleviated by the reinforcement of No. 151 Wing RAF on September 7, 1941 at Vaenga airfield. The Wing was tasked with providing Hawker Hurricane aircraft and training for the Russians, but also flew 365 sorties over the Murmansk area, accounting for 14 German aircraft kills.

==Operation Arctic Fox==
===Start of the war===
On September 1, 1940, Finland signed a treaty allowing the Germans to transit troops through Finland to Norway. During German-Finnish negotiations the Finnish High Command offered its support to the German &quot;venture&quot;, but the Finnish national parliament sanctioned military action against the Soviets only in case the Soviet Union attacked them first. On 22 June Germany launched Operation Barbarossa, invading the Soviet Union. German aircraft used Finnish air bases, and the army launched Operation Reindeer which captured Petsamo. Simultaneously Finland remilitarized the neutral Åland Islands. Despite these actions the Finnish government insisted it was neutral, but the Soviet leadership already viewed Finland as Germany&#x27;s ally. The Murmansk Oblast declared a state of emergency, mobilizing 50,000 soldiers and sailors. Conscripts and volunteers joined the newly formed 1st Polar Rifle Division, while sailors from the Northern Fleet enlisted in a marine infantry brigade. Civilians were also employed in the construction of four lines of fortifications, between Zapadnaya Litsa and Kola Bay. The Soviets proceeded to launch an air raid on 25 June, bombing all major Finnish cities and industrial centers including Helsinki, Turku and Lahti. During a night session, the Finnish parliament voted to go to war against the Soviet Union and Operation Arctic Fox would begin within a week.

===Capture of Salla and stalemate at Kayraly===

&quot;Arctic Fox&quot; began at midnight 1 July 1941, when the Finnish 6th Division crossed the border. The 6th SS Mountain Division &quot;Nord&quot; and the 169th Division attacked the Soviets several hours later. Soviet positions were heavily fortified and manned by divisions from the Soviet 14th Army: the 122nd Rifle Division, the 104th Rifle Division, and the 1st Tank Division commanded by Valerian A. Frolov. In daylight, facing Soviet resistance, both divisions sustained heavy losses and the attack failed, with SS &quot;Nord&quot; Division faring especially badly. The situation worsened the next day when, after a renewed assault, the Soviets counterattacked. SS &quot;Nord&quot; staff panicked and some of the division routed, forcing Feige and the XXXVI Corps command to intervene to restore order.

This failure prompted the German command to rethink its strategy. To reinforce the troops and replace the losses, additional personnel were transferred from the 163rd Infantry Division based in Southern Finland. With a combined effort by all the German forces, extensive air-support by &quot;Luftflotte 5&quot;, as well as a supportive flanking attack by the Finnish 6th Division, they finally broke through the Soviet defenses on 6 July and captured Salla. A heavy Soviet counterattack drove them back out of the town but on 8 July, a general Soviet retreat of the 122nd Rifle Division allowed the German forces to recapture the town. The Soviet troops had to leave most of their artillery behind and in the heavy fighting some 50 Soviet tanks were destroyed. In order not to lose momentum, the SS Division &quot;Nord&quot; pursued the 122nd Rifle Division toward Lampela, while the 169th Division turned east toward Kayraly. Meanwhile, the Finnish 6th Division was making good progress in its flanking manoeuvre to the east to circumvent Kayraly and Lape Apa.

On 9 July, the 169th Division reached the town of Kayraly, but was thrown back by strong Soviet counterattacks. All three Soviet divisions now formed a formidable defense line around Kayraly, incorporating the adjacent lakes Apa and Kuola into their defense. The German advance stalled, facing difficulties with arctic forest fighting. At the same time the Soviets managed to bring additional reinforcements to replace their losses. On 16 July, Falkenhorst arrived at the XXXVI Corps&#x27; headquarters and pressured Feige to renew the offensive. Feige relented and on 27 and 29 July the corps made two additional attacks separately against the Soviets which led to nothing. A stalemate had developed at the front line that the Germans could not break. Due to the grim situation, and mounting losses (5,500 men in just one month), &quot;AOK Norwegen&quot; finally ordered Feige to halt the offensive.

===Attack of the Finnish III Corps===
While the German advance stalled, the Finnish 3rd Division of III Corps in the south was making good progress. The division&#x27;s first opponent was the Soviet 54th Rifle Division of the Soviet 7th Army. &quot;Group F&quot; advanced very quickly through of rough terrain to the Vyonitsa River, where it encircled and destroyed several Soviet units from 10 to 19 July. &quot;Group J&quot; advanced to the strongly defended canal between Lake Pyaozero and Lake Topozero. Astonished by the rapid Finnish success, the &quot;AOK Norwegen&quot; now decided to support the Finnish advance by transferring parts of the SS &quot;Nord&quot; Division south and put them under Finnish command.

Beginning on 30 July, the Finns succeeded in smuggling a battalion over the lakes, behind Soviet lines, which allowed them to flank and subsequently defeat the Soviets on the other side of the canal. On 7 August, the Finns captured Kestenga after fierce fighting. Reacting to the Finnish advance on the Murmansk railway, the Soviets transferred additional troops (the 88th Rifle Division as well as the independent Grivnik brigade) into the region. Soviet resistance now stiffened, leading to a stall of &quot;Group J&#x27;s&quot; advance east of Kestenga. While &quot;Group J&quot; had been embroiled in the battle around Kestenga, &quot;Group F&quot; was able to reach the outskirts of Ukhta. They broke through the defense line at the Yeldanka Lake, and were able to come within a few miles short of Ukhta proper. However, the new Soviet reinforcements prevented any further gains, and the Finnish attack stalled in this sector too.

With the increasing Soviet resistance, a plan was made to concentrate on only one target. It was decided to halt the Ukhta-offensive and instead support the advance east of Kestenga in mid-August. This new drive was able to make some ground in the arctic no-man&#x27;s land, but no decisive breakthrough could be achieved. The increasing Soviet activity also worried Siilasvuo, especially as &quot;Group F&quot; was now standing still in exposed terrain, open to a possible Soviet encirclement. To counter this, &quot;AOK Norwegen&quot; decided to bolster the Finnish forces for a final push to the east and the rest of the SS &quot;Nord&quot; division was moved south and put under Finnish command. Also parts of 6th Finnish Division were now moved south and returned to the Finnish III Corps for more reinforcements. Once the reorganisation had been completed, a new, final attack had to be launched by both Finnish battlegroups in October.

Concurrently to these advances, a Finnish &quot;jaeger&quot; (&quot;jääkäri&quot;) battalion was inserted into the largely unoccupied area between the Murmansk and Kandalaksha directions of the advance and was able to cut the sole railway line connecting Kandalaksha with forward Soviet positions at the Nyam station. This meant that for two weeks the Soviet 122nd Rifle Division did not receive any supplies and had to live off its field dumps.

===Renewed attack in the centre toward the Murmansk Railway===
 During the successful advance by Finnish forces in the south, tensions between the headquarters of XXXVI Corps and &quot;AOK Norwegen&quot; rose. Feige naturally believed that his corps should lead the main effort against the Murmansk railway. However, instead of giving him the requested reinforcements to overcome the strong Soviet defenses and reach the goal of Kandalaksha, Falkenhorst was transferring more and more units south to bolster the Finnish III Corps&#x27; advance. While &quot;AOK Norwegen&quot; indeed saw the greatest chance of success within III Corps, nevertheless it ordered Feige to resume his offensive towards the east, leaving him in a very difficult situation.

With no other choices left, Feige drew up a plan for another offensive. The thinly stretched forces of the 169th division had to split up to take over the defense line along the entire frontline between Kayrala and its adjacent lakes. The Finnish 6th Division would then be freed to undertake another massive flanking operation. Coming from the very south, they would circumvent the Soviet positions at Kayrala and thrust to a position east of it behind the Soviet lines at Lake Nurmi. The 169th Division would do the same, but from the north, resulting in a large pincer movement to trap the Soviets. At the beginning of August 1941 this plan was launched with the Finnish 6th Division heading the renewed drive of the XXXVI Corps with the 169th Division following. The plan met with unexpected success. The attack completely surprised the Soviets and a large firefight developed around Kayraly. The German-Finnish force was able to encircle large parts of the Soviet 42nd Rifle Corps and its 104th Division. Although some units escaped, large Soviet formations were subsequently destroyed and the Soviets had to leave most of their equipment behind. In the face of the new German thrust, the Soviets retreated to the Tuutsa River. They tried to establish a new defensive line around Alakurtti, but were unable to hold out against the pursuing Finnish-German units. After the Soviets lost Alakurtti they withdrew to the Voyta River where the old 1939 Soviet border fortifications were situated.

On 6 September, XXXVI Corps launched a frontal assault against the Soviet fortifications but made only slow progress. XXXVI Corps attempted another flanking attack similar to Kayrela, with one German regiment trying to circumvent the Soviet defenses in the south. This time it did not work as well, and the German effort bogged down against heavy resistance. After days of fighting, the Germans were finally able to push behind the Voyta River only to be confronted by another even stronger Soviet defense line. The so-called VL or Verman Line stretched from Lake Verkhneye Verman to Lake Tolvand and included heavy Soviet pre-war fortifications.

By this point XXXVI Corps had reached total exhaustion. With the transfer of the SS Division &quot;Nord&quot; to the south, and a return of the Finnish 6th Division to III Corps, Feige deemed any further advance in this sector impossible. With the Soviets bringing more reinforcements to the front every day, Feige requested more men if he was to start a new attack. Plans were made by &quot;AOK Norwegen&quot; for a resumption of the offensive, but the German High Command was unable to reinforce the Arctic theatre with additional units and &quot;AOK Norwegen&quot; could not send anything meaningful itself to aid Feige. Consequently, all offensive plans were scrapped. Due to the more spectacular gains at the main front in Central Russia during Operation Barbarossa, the OKW deemed the current situation acceptable and an end was ordered to the offensive operations of XXXVI Corps. This, combined with heavy German casualties, led to the attack finally being called off at the end of September.

===Final battles of III Corps and the end of the operation===

While XXXVI Corps was struggling against the Soviets, III Corps&#x27; situation was not much better, despite reinforcements arriving from the transfers of XXXVI Corps to the south. &quot;Group F&#x27;s&quot; new drive on Ukhta was immediately stopped in its tracks by recent reinforcements of the 88th Rifle Division. The Soviets now launched a heavy counterattack. The Finns, who were still reorganising with the recently arrived German units for a revived push to the east, were forced to retire. To counter the new threat &quot;AOK Norwegen&quot; now threw in everything it had available to bolster the Finnish front. New assignments included another regiment from XXXVI Corps as well as parts of the 14th Finnish Infantry Regiment pulled from Operation Platinum Fox, the German front in the far north. The new reinforcements helped to stabilise the front.

Finally, on 30 October, the new long-planned offensive began, and after two days a Soviet regiment was encircled. Finnish General Hjalmar Siilasvuo proceeded to clear the perimeter with his troops. After the disappointing performance of the SS units under his command and the realization that he neither the Finnish nor the German high command is going to provide him with additional forces or substantial reinforcements, he slowed down the advance towards the east and instead concentrated on clearing and securing the area. Those mop-up operations were completed by 13 November. By that point the Finnish 3rd Division had killed 3,000 Soviet soldiers and captured 2,600.

With the Germans mostly unable to operate and advance without the support of the experienced Finnish units, their hope now lay on a continuation of the attack led by the Finns themselves. These hopes were soon squashed. Field Marshal Carl Mannerheim, supreme commander of the Finnish forces, insisted on delaying further offensive operations, citing military and logistical reasons. On 17 November, Siilasvuo ordered an immediate stop to the Finnish III Corps&#x27; offensive, despite positive feedback from his field commanders that further ground could be taken. This sudden change in Finnish behaviour was, in some part, the result of diplomatic pressure by the United States and Britain. Finland was no longer interested in spearheading such an offensive. With the Finnish refusal to be involved in further offensive operations, &quot;Arctic Fox&quot; came to an end in November and both sides dug in.

==Aftermath==

Operation Arctic Fox did not meet its goals. During the operation the German and Finnish forces took Salla as well as Kestenga, but overall the operation failed in terms of its strategic intentions, as neither Murmansk nor the Murmansk railway at Kandalaksha were captured. The closest the German-Finnish force came to the Murmansk railway was east of Kestenga, where they were about away from it. The XXXVI Corps, especially its SS-component, was ill-trained and unprepared for arctic warfare and therefore made little progress while suffering heavy casualties. On the other hand, the Finnish units, especially the 6th Division of the III Finnish Corps, made good progress and inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviet forces.

The failure of Arctic Fox had a significant impact on the course of the war in the east. Murmansk was a major base for the Soviet Northern Fleet and it was also together with Arkhangelsk the main destination for Allied aid shipped to the Soviet Union. British convoys had traveled to Murmansk since the summer at the onset of the war, but with the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, the influx of Western Allied aid increased massively. The United States enacted the Lend-Lease pact in which they vowed to supply the Soviet Union with large quantities amounts of food, oil, and war materiel. One quarter of this aid was delivered via Murmansk. This included large amounts of raw materials like aluminum as well as large quantities of military goods for the Soviet war effort, including 5,218 tanks, 7,411 aircraft, 4,932 anti-tank guns, 473 million rounds of ammunition and various sea vessels. Those supplies benefited the Soviets significantly and contributed to their continued resistance.

For the remainder of the war the Arctic front remained stale. The German High Command did not regard it as an important theatre and therefore refrained from transferring the substantial reinforcements needed for a renewal of the offensive. The Finns likewise were not interested in continuing the offensive on their own as they did not want to antagonize the Western Allies further. In September 1944, following a series of devastating German defeats, the Finns sued for peace with the Soviet Union and had to give up all their territorial conquests. The Germans subsequently retreated from Central Finland to Petsamo and Norway. In October 1944, the Red Army conducted the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation and achieved a decisive victory over the German forces in the Arctic by completely expelling them from Finland.

==Notes==
* Russian historiography commonly describes the fighting in this area as the Kandalaksha Operation.
* A mixed unit consisting of ad hoc drafted and volunteered sailors, later renamed 186th Rifle Division. In November, it was transferred to the south of Murmansk when Operation Platinum Fox slowed down.
* The Finns suffered around 5,000 casualties during the course of the whole Silver Fox operation.
*The matter of when and why Finland prepared for war is still somewhat opaque. See: William Trotter &quot;A Frozen Hell&quot; Algonquin Books, 1991, p. 226

Despite exhaustive efforts by Finnish historians, it is so far proven impossible to pinpoint the exact date on which Finland was taken into confidence about Operation Barbarossa. The &quot;paper trail&quot; is tantalizing but leads only to dead ends and side paths, not to any benchmark conference or dates. Probably no formal agreements were necessary. The Finnish Generals who were privy to joint planning were mostly German trained and intimately familiar with the German way of waging war. There was also a certain amount of coyness on both sides. Joint operations were discussed, all during the spring of 1941, in purely hypothetical terms, and neither the Finns nor the Germans were entirely candid with one another as to their national aims and methods. In any case, the step from contingency planning to actual operations, when it came, was little more than a formality. Three days after the start of Barbarossa, Stalin handed the Finns a perfect excuse by launching some air raids. War was declared on June 25, 1941

*See Gerhard Weinberg &quot;A World at Arms&quot; Cambridge University Press, 1994, p. 271:
A political factor also restrained the Finns as they approached the border they had before the Russian attack of 1939. They came under increasing pressure from Britain and the United States to stop at the old border. There were element within Finland which favoured such a halt; and in their hour of peril in October–November 1941, the Soviet Union through the United States offered to return to that border if Finland made peace. The euphoria caused by the same German victories which produced this Soviet offer misled the Finns into disregarding it and continuing in the war for expansionist objectives in eastern Karelia and in the far north. The British thereupon declared war on Finland, while, in fear that the United States would do the same, refrained from even further offensives.

<text>Zuber Corners is an unincorporated rural community in Woolwich Township, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

Zuber Corners is located at the crossroads of County Road 23 and Line 86. The Grand River is a short distance west.

==History==
The settlement is named for Jacob Zuber, who lived on the southeast corner of the settlement.

In 1874, a stone school was built at Zuber Corners. It replaced a school in nearby West Montrose which was being flooded each year. The school closed in 1967.

<doc id="730377" wikidata="Q804332" url="?curid=730377" title="Baker's cyst">
<text>A Baker&#x27;s cyst, also known as a popliteal cyst, is a type of fluid collection behind the knee. Often there are no symptoms. If symptoms do occur these may include swelling and pain behind the knee, or knee stiffness. If the cyst breaks open, pain may significantly increase with swelling of the calf. Rarely complications such as deep vein thrombosis, peripheral neuropathy, ischemia, or compartment syndrome may occur.
Risk factors include other knee problems such as osteoarthritis, meniscal tears, or rheumatoid arthritis. The underlying mechanism involves the flow of synovial fluid from the knee joint to the gastrocnemio-semimembranosus bursa, resulting in its expansion. The diagnosis may be confirmed with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Treatment is initially with supportive care. If this is not effective aspiration and steroid injection or surgical removal may be carried out. Around 20% of people have a Baker&#x27;s cyst. They occur most commonly in those 35 to 70 years old. It is named after the surgeon who first described it, William Morrant Baker (1838–1896).

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms may include swelling behind the knee, stiffness, and pain. If the cyst breaks open, pain may increase, and there may be swelling of the calf. Rupture of a Baker&#x27;s cyst may also cause bruising below the medial malleolus of the ankle (Crescent sign).

==Cause==

In adults, Baker&#x27;s cysts usually arise from almost any form of knee arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) or cartilage (particularly a meniscus) tear. Baker&#x27;s cysts in children do not point to underlying joint disease. Baker&#x27;s cysts arise between the tendons of the medial head of the gastrocnemius and the semimembranosus muscles. They are posterior to the medial femoral condyle.

The synovial sac of the knee joint can, under certain circumstances, produce a posterior bulge, into the popliteal space, the space behind the knee. When this bulge becomes large enough, it becomes palpable and cystic. Most Baker&#x27;s cysts maintain this direct communication with the synovial cavity of the knee, but sometimes, the new cyst pinches off. A Baker&#x27;s cyst can rupture and produce acute pain behind the knee and in the calf and swelling of the calf muscles. 

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is by examination. A Baker&#x27;s cyst is easier to see from behind with the patient standing with knees fully extended. It is most easily palpated (felt) with the knee partially flexed. Diagnosis is confirmed by ultrasonography, although if needed and there is no suspicion of a popliteal artery aneurysm then aspiration of synovial fluid from the cyst may be undertaken with care. An MRI image can reveal presence of a Baker&#x27;s cyst.

An infrequent but potentially life-threatening complication, which may need to be excluded by blood tests and ultrasonography, is a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Quick assessment of the possibility of DVT may be required where a Baker&#x27;s cyst has compressed vascular structures, causing leg edema, as this sets up conditions for a DVT to develop.

A burst cyst commonly causes calf pain, swelling and redness that may mimic thrombophlebitis.

==Treatment==
Baker&#x27;s cysts usually require no treatment unless they are symptomatic. It is very rare that the symptoms are actually coming from the cyst. In most cases, there is another disorder in the knee (arthritis, meniscal (cartilage) tear, etc.) that is causing the problem. Initial treatment should be directed at correcting the source of the increased fluid production. Often rest and leg elevation are all that is needed. If necessary, the cyst can be aspirated to reduce its size, then injected with a corticosteroid to reduce inflammation. Surgical excision is reserved for cysts that cause a great amount of discomfort to the patient. A ruptured cyst is treated with rest, leg elevation, and injection of a corticosteroid into the knee.

===Exercise===
Many activities can put strain on the knee, and cause pain in the case of Baker&#x27;s cyst. Avoiding activities such as squatting, kneeling, heavy lifting, climbing, and even running can help prevent pain. Despite this, some exercises can help relieve pain, and a physiotherapist may instruct on hamstring stretching to reduce pressure on the Baker&#x27;s Cyst, and strengthening exercises for the quadriceps and/or the patellar ligament.

<doc id="730378" wikidata="Q5576268" url="?curid=730378" title="Goddard–Thorn theorem">
<text>In mathematics, and in particular in the mathematical background of string theory, the Goddard–Thorn theorem (also called the no-ghost theorem) is a theorem describing properties of a functor that quantizes bosonic strings. It is named after Peter Goddard and Charles Thorn.

The name &quot;no-ghost theorem&quot; stems from the fact that in the original statement of the theorem, the natural inner product induced on the output vector space is positive definite. Thus, there were no so-called ghosts (Pauli–Villars ghosts), or vectors of negative norm. The name &quot;no-ghost theorem&quot; is also a word play on the no-go theorem of quantum mechanics.

== Statement ==
This statement is that of Borcherds (1992).

Suppose that formula_1 is a unitary representation of the Virasoro algebra formula_2, so formula_1 is equipped with a non-degenerate bilinear form formula_4 and there is an algebra homomorphism formula_5 so that 
formula_6
where the adjoint is defined with respect to the bilinear form, and 
formula_7
Suppose also that formula_1 decomposes into a direct sum of eigenspaces of formula_9 with non-negative, integer eigenvalues formula_10, denoted formula_11, and that each formula_11 is finite dimensional (giving formula_1 a formula_14-grading). Assume also that formula_1 admits an action from a group formula_16 that preserves this grading.

For the two-dimensional even unimodular Lorentzian lattice II1,1, denote the corresponding lattice vertex algebra by formula_17. This is a II1,1-graded algebra with a bilinear form and carries an action of the Virasoro algebra. 

Let formula_18 be the subspace of the vertex algebra formula_19 consisting of vectors formula_20 such that formula_21 for formula_22. Let formula_23 be the subspace of formula_18 of degree formula_25. Each space inherits a formula_16-action which acts as prescribed on formula_1 and trivially on formula_17.

The quotient of formula_23 by the nullspace of its bilinear form is naturally isomorphic as a formula_16-module with an invariant bilinear form, to formula_31 if formula_32 and formula_33 if formula_34.

=== II1,1 ===
The lattice II1,1 is the rank 2 lattice with bilinear form
formula_35
This is even, unimodular and integral with signature (+,-).

== Formalism ==
There are two naturally isomorphic functors that are typically used to quantize bosonic strings. In both cases, one starts with positive-energy representations of the Virasoro algebra of central charge 26, equipped with Virasoro-invariant bilinear forms, and ends up with vector spaces equipped with bilinear forms. Here, &quot;Virasoro-invariant&quot; means &quot;Ln&quot; is adjoint to &quot;L&quot;−&quot;n&quot; for all integers &quot;n&quot;.

The first functor historically is &quot;old canonical quantization&quot;, and it is given by taking the quotient of the weight 1 primary subspace by the radical of the bilinear form. Here, &quot;primary subspace&quot; is the set of vectors annihilated by &quot;Ln&quot; for all strictly positive &quot;n&quot;, and &quot;weight 1&quot; means &quot;L&quot;0 acts by identity. A second, naturally isomorphic functor, is given by degree 1 BRST cohomology. Older treatments of BRST cohomology often have a shift in the degree due to a change in choice of BRST charge, so one may see degree −1/2 cohomology in papers and texts from before 1995. A proof that the functors are naturally isomorphic can be found in Section 4.4 of Polchinski&#x27;s &quot;String Theory&quot; text.

The Goddard–Thorn theorem amounts to the assertion that this quantization functor more or less cancels the addition of two free bosons, as conjectured by Lovelace in 1971. Lovelace&#x27;s precise claim was that at critical dimension 26, Virasoro-type Ward identities cancel two full sets of oscillators. Mathematically, this is the following claim:

Let &quot;V&quot; be a unitarizable Virasoro representation of central charge 24 with Virasoro-invariant bilinear form, and let be the irreducible module of the R1,1 Heisenberg Lie algebra attached to a nonzero vector &quot;λ&quot; in R1,1. Then the image of &quot;V&quot; ⊗  under quantization is canonically isomorphic to the subspace of &quot;V&quot; on which &quot;L&quot;0 acts by 1-(&quot;λ&quot;,&quot;λ&quot;).

The no-ghost property follows immediately, since the positive-definite Hermitian structure of &quot;V&quot; is transferred to the image under quantization.

==Applications==
The bosonic string quantization functors described here can be applied to any conformal vertex algebra of central charge 26, and the output naturally has a Lie algebra structure. The Goddard–Thorn theorem can then be applied to concretely describe the Lie algebra in terms of the input vertex algebra.

Perhaps the most spectacular case of this application is Richard Borcherds&#x27;s proof of the monstrous moonshine conjecture, where the unitarizable Virasoro representation is the monster vertex algebra (also called &quot;moonshine module&quot;) constructed by Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman. By taking a tensor product with the vertex algebra attached to a rank-2 hyperbolic lattice, and applying quantization, one obtains the monster Lie algebra, which is a generalized Kac–Moody algebra graded by the lattice. By using the Goddard–Thorn theorem, Borcherds showed that the homogeneous pieces of the Lie algebra are naturally isomorphic to graded pieces of the moonshine module, as representations of the monster simple group.

Earlier applications include Frenkel&#x27;s determination of upper bounds on the root multiplicities of the Kac–Moody Lie algebra whose Dynkin diagram is the Leech lattice, and Borcherds&#x27;s construction of a generalized Kac–Moody Lie algebra that contains Frenkel&#x27;s Lie algebra and saturates Frenkel&#x27;s 1/∆ bound.

<text>A boulevard is a type of broad avenue planted with rows of trees, or in parts of North America, any urban highway or wide road in a commercial district.

Boulevards were originally circumferential roads following the line of former city walls.

In North American usage, boulevards may be wide, multi-lane thoroughfares divided with only a central median.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;boulevard&quot; is borrowed from French. In France, it originally meant the flat surface of a rampart, and later a promenade taking the place of a demolished fortification. It is a borrowing from the Dutch word &quot;&quot; &#x27;bulwark&#x27;.

<text>This article details the history of the Scots Guards from 1642 to 1804. The Scots Guards (SG) is a regiment of the Guards Division of the British Army. The Scots Guards trace their origins back to 1642 when, by order of King Charles I, the regiment was raised by Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll for service in Ireland, and was known as the Marquis of Argyll&#x27;s Royal Regiment. It spent a number of years there and performed a variety of duties, but in the mid-1640s, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the regiment took part in the fight against James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose who was fighting on the side of Charles I. In 1646, Montrose left Scotland upon the defeat of the King in England.


==Lyfe Guard of Foot==
In 1650, a year after the execution of King Charles I, his son, Charles II, arrived in Scotland to ascend to the throne of Scotland. That same year, the regiment became the Lyfe Guard of Foot of His Majesty King Charles II. In July that year, Oliver Cromwell, a leading figure of the English Civil War, and now leader of England, led an army into Scotland. Late that year, the Scottish Royalists, led by David Leslie, confronted Cromwell&#x27;s English Army at the Battle of Dunbar. It would turn into a victory for Cromwell&#x27;s Army, and resulted in over 3,000 men of Leslie&#x27;s Army being killed and many thousands more captured. The following year the regiment took part in the invasion of England which was led by the newly crowned King Charles II of Scotland. The regiment took part in the Battle of Worcester which again ended in a defeat for the Royalist forces, with King Charles II subsequently fleeing to France. The regiment ceased to exist.

When Oliver Cromwell died in 1658, his son Richard Cromwell succeeded him but proved to be unsuccessful and abdicated in 1659. The following year, Charles II returned to England upon the Convention Parliament declaring him to be King. In 1661, the regiment was reformed as the Scottish Regiment of Foot Guards. That same year, Archibald, 1st Marquis of Argyll who had been ordered to raise the regiment by Charles I, was executed for high treason. The regiment was used against the Covenanters in Scotland who had begun an uprising in 1666 in response to many oppressive measures taken towards them by Charles II. That same year, the regiment took part in the Battle of Rullion Green which ended in a defeat for the Covenanters. In 1679, the regiment once more confronted the Covenanters in battle, at Bothwell Brig, which also ended in a defeat for the Covenanters.

==A Grand Alliance==
In 1686, the regiment was placed on the establishment of the English Army and the word battalion was first used. In 1688, William of Orange landed in England, forcing King James II to flee England after the English Army changed sides and joined with William. The following year, William, along with his wife Mary, became joint ruler of England and Scotland.

In 1688, England, along with many allies, was involved once more in a war on the continent, the War of the Grand Alliance, its adversary being its old enemy, France. The war also reached North America where both sides&#x27; colonists fought each other. The regiment saw action in the Low Countries the following year at the Battle of Walcourt, in which an Allied Army defeated the French, though defeats for the Allies would soon follow. In 1692, the regiment took part in the bloody Battle of Steenkirk. The courage and professionalism of the Allied soldiers was truly proven in that bitter battle, though it ended in a defeat for the Allies, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The following year the regiment took part in another bloody engagement, the Battle of Landen. The Allies stoutly stood their ground against the attacking French, though they could not hold forever, and French cavalry broke through the Allied defences, forcing the Allied Army to withdraw. As at Steenkirk, the battle resulted in heavy casualties for both sides.

In 1695, the Guards regiments displayed unswerving courage and ferocity during the Siege of Namur, which ended in September with the Allies capturing the city, in what is now Belgium, from the French. The Guards regiments suffered heavily during the siege though constantly showed their professionalism and courage. The regiment gained its first battle honour for the Siege of Namur but their second would not come for many years.

==Wars of Succession==
In 1704, a further company was created for the regiment, a Highlander company, complete with the many traditional accoutrements of a Highlander. In 1707, England and Scotland, with the Act of Union, joined to become the Kingdom of Great Britain, with Queen Anne becoming the nation&#x27;s first Monarch.

In 1709, a number of years after the War of the Spanish Succession had begun, the regiment deployed to Spain and in 1710 took part in the Battle of Saragossa which ended in a victory for Great Britain against Franco-Spanish forces. That same year, the regiment took part in the Battle of Brihuega, when a British force was surprised by the enemy and defeated despite putting up a valiant fight. The war would not end until 1713 with the Treaty of Utrecht, ending the war favourably for Great Britain. Change came to the regiment when its name was changed to the 3rd Regiment of Foot Guards, a name they would take into the 19th century. In 1714, the Highlander Company was disbanded.

In 1740, the War of the Austrian Succession began, which pitted Great Britain and her Allies once more against France. In 1743, the regiment took part in the Battle of Dettingen. This was the last time a reigning British Monarch led an army into battle. The British and her Allies defeated the French Army which was led by the Duc de Noailles. In honour of the victory, the composer Handel wrote &quot;Dettingen Te Deum&quot;. The battle gave the regiment its second battle honour.

In 1745, the regiment took part in the Battle of Fontenoy in the Austrian Netherlands between a British and Allies force and the French. The British and Allied force were under the command of the Duke of Cumberland while the French force was commanded by Maurice de Saxe. The British and their Allies, despite performing valiantly, lost the battle to the French with both sides losing many men. The battle was quite fierce, and the 3rd Foot Guards suffered quite badly, losing over 100 officers and men during the engagement. The regiment subsequently had a brief period back in Great Britain during the Second Jacobite Rebellion which was led by Bonnie Prince Charlie who claimed the throne of Great Britain, aided by France. The regiment was soon back in the Low Countries though, and in 1747 took part in the Battle of Lauffeld which ended in a defeat for Britain and her Allies who had been outnumbered by the French. The long War of the Austrian Succession would finally end the following year.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==
In 1756, war flared up once more between Great Britain and France, though this time the war would reach many parts of the world, in effect creating the first ever &#x27;world war&#x27;. In June 1758, the 1st Battalion took part in an expedition against France, landing at Cancalle Bay on the Brittany coast. However, this first expedition was abortive and was cancelled, with the troops and ships eventually returning to Britain.

A second expedition was launched in August, and British forces, including the 1st Battalion, 3rd Foot Guards, landed near the port of Cherbourg in Normandy. At the landing site, the Guards battalions dispersed a few thousand French troops who had been there to oppose the landing. The British force soon marched on Cherbourg which duly surrendered. The British subsequently destroyed many French warships as well as the port facilities at Cherbourg which would not be fully repaired for many years. They then re-embarked aboard their ships and in early September landed a few miles from St. Malo in Brittany for an assault on that port. However, the assault was deemed to be impracticable and the fleet that had landed them was forced to sail from its position to Saint-Cast due to bad weather, thus forcing the British troops to march there so that they could re-embark. On 12 September, the British rearguard, consisting of over 1000 Guards as well as the Grenadier companies of the infantry battalions, were attacked by numerically superior French troops. The rearguard stoutly defended their position but they were only delaying the inevitable and eventually they fell back, rushing to embark about the ships. The British lost several hundred men killed, wounded and captured during the engagement, including the commander of the rearguard.

The 2nd Battalion also saw service abroad, being part of a Brigade of Guards force sent to Germany where they fought under the command of John Manners, Marquess of Granby. The battalion took part in the Battle of Villinghausen in 1761, in which an Allied force, under the command of Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, defeated a numerically superior French force. The following year, in June, the battalion took part in the Battle of Wilhelmsthal in which a heavily outnumbered Allied force defeated the French after some bitter fighting, of which the Guards battalions saw much of it. Later that year, the battalion took part in the Battle of the Brücke-Mühle, the battalion&#x27;s last action during the Seven Years&#x27; War, which would end in 1763.

==Seeing the New World==
In 1776, the American colonists, in Philadelphia, declared their independence from Great Britain during the American War of Independence. In response, fifteen men from each company of the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards, Coldstream Regiment of Foot Guards and the 3rd Regiment of Foot Guards, formed a composite battalion of Foot Guards to be sent to North America. The composite battalion was subsequently split into two battalions, with both battalions seeing action at the Battle of Brooklyn and the Battle of White Plains that same year. The following year, in September, the composite Foot Guards took part in the Battle of Brandywine. The British and their Allies, the Hessians, were slightly outnumbered by the Americans, though the British and Hessians did triumph, with both sides suffering large casualties. Later that year, both composite battalions took part in the Battle of Germantown which also ended in a British victory.

In 1781, the two composite Foot Guard battalions took part in the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. The force was commanded by General Charles Cornwallis and had 1,900 troops while their American opponents numbered 4,400. The Foot Guards were in the thick of it for much of the battle with exceptional professionalism. During the course of the battle, the Foot Guards were involved in a very bitter struggle with American Dragoons after being the subject of an attack by the Dragoons from the rear. The Americans also launched a counter-attack and chaos ensued. General Cornwallis made the difficult decision to fire grapeshot into the intermingling masses of the British and American troops. While the British troops took heavy casualties from the grapeshot, the Americans were forced to withdraw. The Foot Guards suffered quite heavily, losing many men killed and wounded, their commanding officer, Brigadier Charles O&#x27;Hara of the Coldstream Guards being severely wounded.

The composite Foot Guards, due to the casualties that the Guards had suffered, was reduced to a single composite battalion. Later in 1781, the composite Foot Guards took part in its last engagement, at the Battle of Yorktown, which began when Yorktown was besieged by the Americans. The British defended their positions with great courage into October, but the British commander, General Cornwallis, on 19 October, marched out, along with his army, of Yorktown to surrender to the Americans. The Foot Guards would not depart America until 1782, finally returning home to Great Britain in 1783. The composite Foot Guards were disbanded that same year and the men were returned to their previous regiments.

==The French Revolutionary Wars==
In 1789, the French Revolution began. In 1793, the First Coalition, which included Great Britain and continental European powers, was created to combat Revolutionary France. The &quot;1st Battalion&quot; took part in the Battle of Famars on 23 May and the Siege of Valenciennes (1793) which began that same month, with the town eventually falling to the Allies in July that year. The &quot;battalion&quot; also took part in the Battle of Caesar&#x27;s Camp at Bouchain and the Siege of Dunkirk which ended in September.

In August 1793, the &quot;1st Battalion&quot;, under the command of William Grinfield along with the 1st Battalions of the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards and the Coldstream Regiment of Foot Guard&#x27;, took part in the Battle of Lincelles. The Guards, only just over 1000, were tasked with recaptururing the village of Lincelles from the French, over 5,000 in strength, who had re-taken it from Dutch troops. The Foot Guards advanced valiantly and professionally on the freshly captured village, coming under horrendous artillery and small-arms fire, suffering heavy casualties. The Foot Guards performed ferociously with bayonet upon storming the village, being engaged in some bitter fighting with the French, causing heavy French casualties in the process and clearing the village of the French, with the Guards capturing the village. The regiment won its third battle honour for their part in the battle. The regiment took part in further engagements in 1793, including at Lannoy. The &quot;battalion&#x27;s&quot; last engagements came the following year.

In 1798, the Second Coalition against Revolutionary France was formed. That same year, the &quot;1st Battalion&#x27;s&quot; light companies took part in a raid on Ostend in what is now Belgium. The raid had the objectives of destroying the lock-gates and sluices of the Bruges to Ostend canal. The expedition was supported by a bombardment from Royal Navy (RN) warships. The locks were destroyed, but due to unfavourable winds preventing re-embarkation, the 1,300 men of the army contingent under the command of Major General Coote were captured by the French. In 1799, the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; took part in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, in the French puppet-state of the Batavian Republic, in what is now the Netherlands. An Anglo-Russian force took part in the campaign there, which had the intentions of restoring the exiled Dutch King, with the hope that the population of Batavia would be keen on such a move after suffering bad times economically due to France forbidding any trade with Great Britain. Shortly after the landing took place a large number of warships of the Batavian Fleet surrendered peacefully to the British. In October, the Foot Guards, along with many other regiments, were involved in the engagements of Egmont-op-Zee and Alkmaar, the latter of which ended in a British victory. In 1800, the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; took part in the expeditions against the coastal Spanish cities of Ferrol, Vigo and Cádiz, the latter of which would become more prominent during the Peninsular War only a few years later.

In 1798, France invaded Egypt intent on conquering the country, a move that would have posed danger to Great Britain&#x27;s position in the Mediterranean as well as to India. The following year, Admiral Lord Nelson decimated the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile, effectively trapping the French in Egypt. In 1801, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was formed and just a few months later the &quot;1st Battalion&quot; was part of a British Army expedition, under the command of General Sir Ralph Abercromby, to Egypt, landing at Aboukir Bay on 8 March, with the amphibious landing being very successful despite being opposed by French defenders.

The &quot;battalion&quot; also took part in the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March, with the British force numbering about 14,000 and the French around 20,000. At the latter engagement, the British forces displayed much heroism and valour, with the Guards Brigade, in the center, acting in a highly professional manner against the French forces, which ended in victory for the British. The British suffered just under 1,500 killed, wounded and missing, including their commander, General Abercromby, who was mortally wounded during the battle, while the French suffered just over 4,000 casualties. Cairo and Alexandria soon afterwards, with the whole of Egypt being recaptured by late 1801. The regiment gained its fourth battle honour with the Sphinx being placed on its Colours with Egypt superscribed on it.

<text>The boxing competition at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia was held at the Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre in Darling Harbour. The event was only open to men and bouts were contested over four rounds of two minutes each. Five judges scored the fighters in real time and the boxer with the most points at the end was the winner.

Like other Olympic combat sports, two bronze medals are awarded; in the case of boxing, both losing semi-finalists receive a bronze medal, with no further play-off. As a result, the quarter-final essentially equates to a bronze medal match, a semi-final to a silver medal match, and the final to a gold medal match. 48 medals are therefore available, half of which are bronze medals.

<text>Ish-bosheth (, &quot;man of shame&quot;), also called Eshbaal (, ; alternatively spelled Ishbaal, &quot;man of Baal&quot;) was, according to the Hebrew Bible, the second monarch of the Kingdom of Israel. After the death of his father, Saul, Ish-bosheth ascended to the throne and reigned for two years. 

During his reign, Ish-bosheth engaged in a protracted conflict with David, who had been anointed as Saul&#x27;s successor by the Tribe of Judah. This rivalry between the two leaders shaped the political landscape of the kingdom at the time. The Hebrew Bible recounts that Ish-bosheth&#x27;s reign was marked by war with David&#x27;s forces, as both factions vied for control and legitimacy. According to biblical accounts, he was killed by two of his own army captains, Baanah and Rechab, who believed that assassinating Ish-bosheth would earn them favour with David. This act not only brought a premature conclusion to Ish-bosheth&#x27;s rule but also played a significant role in the subsequent unification of the kingdom under David&#x27;s leadership.

==Biblical narrative==
In the biblical account, Abner, the captain of Saul&#x27;s army, proclaimed Ish-bosheth king over Israel at Mahanaim in Transjordan (), after the slaying of Ish-bosheth&#x27;s father and brothers in the battle of Gilboa (). Ish-bosheth was 40 years old at this time and reigned for two years (). 

However, after the death of King Saul, the tribe of Judah seceded from the rule of the House of Saul by proclaiming David as its king (), and war ensued (). David&#x27;s faction eventually prevailed against Ish-bosheth&#x27;s (), but the war continued until Abner joined David (). 

Before the death of Saul, David had been married to Saul&#x27;s daughter Michal, Ish-bosheth&#x27;s sister, until Saul and David had a falling-out and Saul gave her to another man (). Later, at the conclusion of the war with Ish-bosheth, David&#x27;s terms for peace required returning Michal to him, and Ish-bosheth complied (). After Abner&#x27;s death, Ish-bosheth seems to have given up hope of retaining power ().

Two of Ish-bosheth&#x27;s own army-captains, Rechab and Baanah, assassinated the deposed king, () expecting a reward from David for this. David, however, refused to give any commendation for high treason; he had both killers executed and their hands and feet cut off. David&#x27;s supporters buried the head of Ish-bosheth in Abner&#x27;s grave at Hebron ().

==Problem of naming==

The names &quot;Ish-bosheth&quot; and &quot;Eshbaal&quot; have ambiguous meanings in the original Hebrew. In Hebrew, &quot;Ish-bosheth&quot; means &quot;Man of shame&quot;. He is also called &quot;Eshbaal&quot;, in Hebrew meaning &quot;Baal exists&quot;, or &quot;fire of Baal&quot;.

Critical scholarship suggests that &quot;Bosheth&quot; was a substitute for &quot;Baʿal&quot;, beginning when Baʿal became an unspeakable word; as (in the opposite direction) Adonai became substituted for the ineffable Tetragrammaton (see taboo deformation).

===As Ish-bosheth===
He is exclusively called Ish-bosheth in the Books of Samuel in the Hebrew Bible:
:Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul&#x27;s host, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel. Ish-bosheth Saul&#x27;s son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. (, Jewish Publication Society, 1917)

When he was assassinated and King David punished the killers:
:... Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, as he took his rest at noon, and they came into the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the groin; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. ... And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David in Hebron, and said to the king: &quot;Behold the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul your enemy, who sought your life; and the Lord has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.&quot; ... And David answered ... &quot;shall I not now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?&quot; ... But they took the head of Ish-bosheth, and buried it in the grave of Abner in Hebron. ()

===As Eshbaal===
Meanwhile, in the Books of Chronicles, he is exclusively called Eshbaal:

:And Ner begot Kish; and Kish begot Saul; and Saul begot Jonathan, and Malchi-shua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal. ( and , Jewish Publication Society, 1917)

==Archaeology==
In 2012, according to the Israel Antiquities Authority, archaeologists had discovered a 3,000-year-old inscription on a reconstructed large ceramic jar found in Khirbet Qeiyafa, containing the name &quot;Eshbaal ben Beda&quot;. Though this Eshbaal is a different person than the Eshbaal/Ish-bosheth of the Bible, it was the first time the name was discovered in an ancient inscription. It is one of only four Hebrew inscriptions ever discovered dating to the 10th century BC.

<doc id="730432" wikidata="Q312005" url="?curid=730432" title="Chris McCandless">
<text>Christopher Johnson McCandless (; February 12, 1968 – August 1992), also known by his pseudonym &quot;Alexander Supertramp&quot;, was an American adventurer who sought an increasingly nomadic lifestyle as he grew up. McCandless is the subject of &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, a nonfiction book by Jon Krakauer that was later made into a full-length feature film.

After graduating from Emory University in Georgia in 1990, McCandless traveled across North America and eventually hitchhiked to Alaska in April 1992. There, he entered the Alaskan bush with minimal supplies, hoping to live simply off the land. On the eastern bank of the Sushana River, McCandless found an abandoned bus, Fairbanks Bus 142, which he used as a makeshift shelter until his death. In September, his body, weighing only , was found inside the bus by a hunter. McCandless&#x27;s cause of death was officially ruled to be starvation, although the exact circumstances relating to his death remain the subject of some debate.

In January 1993, Krakauer published an article about McCandless in that month&#x27;s issue of &quot;Outside&quot; magazine. Inspired by the details of McCandless&#x27;s story, Krakauer wrote the biographical book &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, which was subsequently adapted into a 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, with Emile Hirsch portraying McCandless. That same year, McCandless became the subject of Ron Lamothe&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;.

==Early life==
Christopher Johnson McCandless was born in Inglewood, California and spent his early childhood in El Segundo, California. He was the elder child of Wilhelmina Marie &quot;Billie&quot; McCandless (&quot;née&quot; Johnson) and Walter &quot;Walt&quot; McCandless, and had a younger sister named Carine, born in July 1971. McCandless also had six half-siblings from Walt&#x27;s first marriage, who lived with their mother in California and later in Denver, Colorado. In 1976, the family relocated to Annandale, Virginia, where McCandless&#x27;s father was hired as an antenna specialist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). McCandless&#x27;s mother worked as a secretary for Hughes Aircraft. The couple went on to establish a successful consultancy business out of their home, specializing in Walt&#x27;s area of expertise.

Carine McCandless alleged in her memoir &quot;The Wild Truth&quot; that her parents inflicted verbal and physical abuse upon each other and their children, often fueled by her father&#x27;s alcoholism. She cited their abusive childhood, as well as his reading of Jack London&#x27;s &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, as the motivating factors in her brother&#x27;s desire to &quot;disappear&quot; into the wilderness. In a statement released to the media shortly before the memoir was released, Walt and Billie McCandless denied their daughter&#x27;s accusations, stating that her book is &quot;fictionalized writing [that] has absolutely nothing to do with our beloved son, Chris, his journey or his character. This whole unfortunate event in Chris&#x27;s life 22 years ago is about Chris and his dreams.&quot;

In 1986, McCandless graduated from W.T. Woodson High School in Fairfax, Virginia. He excelled academically, although a number of teachers and fellow students observed that he &quot;marched to the beat of a different drummer.&quot; McCandless also served as captain of the cross-country team, where he would urge teammates to treat running as a spiritual exercise in which they were &quot;running against the forces of darkness ... all the evil in the world, all the hatred.&quot;

In the summer of 1986, McCandless travelled to Southern California and reconnected with relatives and friends. While he was there, McCandless learned that his father had lived for a time in a bigamous union with his second wife; he had also fathered a child with his first wife after the birth of his children by his second wife. Jon Krakauer speculated that this discovery had a profound impact on McCandless.

McCandless graduated from Emory University in May 1990 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in the double majors of history and anthropology. McCandless was an academic high achiever. After graduating, he donated his college savings of over $24,000 (approximately $ in ) to Oxfam and adopted a vagabond lifestyle, working when necessary as a restaurant food preparer and farm-hand. An avid outdoorsman, McCandless completed several lengthy wilderness hiking trips and paddled a canoe down a portion of the Colorado River before hitchhiking to Alaska in April 1992.

==Personal life==
McCandless had a particular interest in classic literature. According to Krakauer, some of his favorite writers were Jack London, Mark Twain, Leo Tolstoy and H. G. Wells. He was also heavily influenced by 19th-century American writer and naturalist Henry David Thoreau, and was engrossed by his essay &quot;On the Duty of Civil Disobedience&quot;. McCandless highlighted a section on chastity in Thoreau&#x27;s &quot;Walden&quot;, which has raised questions regarding his sexuality. There is no indication of McCandless having any romantic partners throughout his life, and he is believed to have remained celibate, although his sister Carine recalls how one night, as a teenager, McCandless drunkenly attempted to bring a girl up to his room, which awakened his mother Billie, who sent the girl home. While staying in Niland Slabs, a seventeen-year-old girl named Tracy pursued McCandless romantically; however, McCandless rejected her advances. Wayne Westerburg recalls McCandless stating that he hoped to get married and have a family in his future.

==Travels==
McCandless left Virginia in the summer of 1990, driving a Datsun west in an apparent cross-country trip to California. His car was in poor condition and suffered numerous breakdowns as he made his way out of the eastern United States. He also carried no car insurance on the vehicle and was driving with expired license plates. By the end of the summer, McCandless had reached the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, where a flash flood disabled his car. Fearful of fines or possibly even arrest due to lack of a valid license, registration, and insurance, McCandless removed the car&#x27;s license plates, took what he could carry, and kept moving on foot. His car was later found, repaired, and put into service as an undercover vehicle for the local police department.

Traveling northwest, McCandless then hitchhiked into the Sierra Nevada mountains, where he broke into a closed cabin to steal food, supplies, and money. Throughout the winter of 1990 and in 1991, McCandless appears to have lived in hermit camps with other vagrants in the Sierra Nevada region. He was suspected of burglarizing other cabins when food and money ran low, but only one case was ever positively confirmed by authorities after his death.

===Mexico and arrest===
In early 1991, McCandless left the Sierra Nevada and hitchhiked in a circular course south through California, into Arizona, and then north to South Dakota. Completely out of cash with no means to support himself, he obtained a job as a grain elevator operator in Carthage, South Dakota. He worked at this job for the remainder of 1991, until one day suddenly quitting and leaving his supervisor a postcard, which read:Tramping is too easy with all this money. My days were more exciting when I was penniless and had to forage around for my next meal ... I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;m going to live this life for some time to come.McCandless then headed to Colorado, where he used money from his job to buy kayak supplies as well as a handgun. He then navigated the Colorado River, without a permit, and was occasionally pursued by wildlife and park rangers who had heard of his exploits from other river travelers, several of whom had been concerned that McCandless had been seen white water rafting in dangerous areas of the river with no safety equipment. In all, sightings of McCandless were reported at Lake Havasu, Bill Williams River, the Colorado River Reservoir, Cibola National Wildlife Refuge, Imperial National Wildlife Refuge, and Yuma Proving Ground. The authorities attempted, but never succeeded, in locating McCandless, who was wanted due to his lack of proper river training as well as kayaking on the river without a valid boating license.

McCandless eventually followed the Colorado River all the way to Mexico, where he crossed the international border through a spillway at the Morelos Dam. After encountering waterfalls, through which he could no longer navigate in a canoe, McCandless abandoned his river journey and spent a few days alone at the village of El Golfo de Santa Clara, in the state of Sonora. Finding Mexico intimidating, with no way to support himself, he attempted to re-enter the U.S. and was arrested for carrying a firearm at a border checkpoint. McCandless was briefly held in custody but released without charges after his gun was confiscated. Following this experience in Mexico, McCandless began hitchhiking north, eventually winding up back in South Dakota.

===Alaska===
In April 1992, McCandless hitchhiked from South Dakota to Fairbanks, Alaska. After his death, witnesses stated they had seen McCandless in Alaska first at Dot Lake, with several other sightings in Fairbanks. McCandless was stated to be traveling with a &quot;big backpack&quot; and would give a false name if asked his identity. He was described as very suspicious of people around him, unkempt, and smelling due to lack of hygiene. One witness described McCandless as &quot;generally strange, weird, with a weird energy&quot;.

McCandless was then last seen alive at the head of the Stampede Trail on April 28 by a local electrician named Jim Gallien. Gallien, who had given McCandless a ride from Fairbanks to the start of the rugged track just outside the small town of Healy, later said he had been seriously concerned about the safety of McCandless (who introduced himself as &quot;Alex&quot;) after noticing his light pack, minimal equipment, meager rations, and obvious lack of experience. Gallien said he had deep doubts about &quot;Alex&#x27;s&quot; ability to survive the harsh and unforgiving Alaskan bush.

Gallien tried repeatedly to persuade McCandless to delay the trip, at one point offering to detour to Anchorage and buy him suitable equipment and supplies. However, McCandless ignored Gallien&#x27;s persistent warnings and refused his offers of assistance (though he did accept a pair of Xtratufs, two sandwiches, and a packet of corn chips from Gallien). Gallien dropped McCandless off, believing he would head back towards the highway within a few days as hunger set in.

After hiking along the snow-covered Stampede Trail, McCandless came upon an abandoned bus (about west of Healy at ) alongside an overgrown section of the trail near Denali National Park. McCandless, according to Krakauer, attempted to continue &quot;heading west until [he] hit the Bering Sea.&quot; However, he was deterred by the thick Alaskan bush and returned to the bus, where he set up camp and lived off the land. He had of rice; a Remington Nylon 66 semi-automatic rifle with 400 rounds of .22LR hollowpoint ammunition; a number of books, including one on local plant life; some personal effects and a few items of camping equipment. Self-portrait photographs and journal entries indicate he foraged for edible plants and hunted game including porcupines, squirrels, and birds such as ptarmigans and Canada geese. On June 9, 1992, McCandless illegally stalked and shot a moose. However, the meat spoiled within days after he failed in his efforts to preserve it. McCandless would experience profound regret as a result of this experience, expressing in a journal entry “I now wish I had never shot the moose. One of the greatest tragedies of my life.”

It had been speculated that McCandless was responsible for vandalizing several cabins in the area that were stocked with food, survival equipment, and emergency supplies. In response, Denali National Park Chief Ranger Ken Kehrer has categorically stated that McCandless was not considered a viable suspect by the National Park Service.

McCandless&#x27;s journal documents 113 days in the area. In July, after living in the bus for a little over two months, he decided to head back to civilization, but the trail was blocked by the impassable Teklanika River swollen with late-summer runoff from the Cantwell Glacier; the watercourse by that stage was considerably higher and swifter than when he had crossed in April. McCandless did not have a detailed topographical map of the region and was unaware of the existence of an abandoned, hand-operated cable car that crossed the river downstream from where he had previously crossed. At this point, McCandless headed back to the bus and re-established his camp. He posted an S.O.S. note on the bus, stating: 

==Death==
McCandless&#x27;s final written journal entry, noted as &quot;Day 107&quot;, simply read, &quot;BEAUTIFUL BLUE BERRIES.&quot; Days 108 through 112 contained no words and were marked only with slashes, and on Day 113, there was no entry. The exact date and time of his death are unknown. Near the time of his death, McCandless took a picture of himself waving while holding a written note, which read:

On September 6, 1992, a hunter who was looking for shelter for the night came upon the converted bus where McCandless had been staying. Upon entering, he smelled what he thought was rotting food and discovered &quot;a lump&quot; in a sleeping bag in the back of the bus. The hunter radioed police, who arrived the following day. State troopers found McCandless&#x27;s decomposing remains in the sleeping bag.

===Theories of starvation===
In his book &quot;Into the Wild&quot; (1996), Jon Krakauer proposes two factors that may have contributed to McCandless&#x27;s death.

====Protein poisoning====
Krakauer wrote McCandless could have died of &quot;rabbit starvation&quot;, officially known as protein poisoning, from over-relying on lean meat for nutrition.

====Swainsonine in &quot;Hedysarum alpinum&quot; seeds====
Krakauer also speculated that McCandless might have been poisoned by a toxic alkaloid called swainsonine, after eating sweet-vetch seeds (&quot;Hedysarum alpinum&quot; or &quot;Hedysarum mackenzii&quot;) containing the toxin, or possibly by a mold that can grow on them, when he put them into a plastic bag. Swainsonine inhibits the metabolism of glycoproteins, which leads to starvation despite ample food consumption.

In an article in the September 2007 issue of &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot;, correspondent Matthew Power states that extensive laboratory testing showed there were no toxins or alkaloids present in the sweet-vetch seeds McCandless had been eating. Thomas Clausen, then-head of the chemistry and biochemistry department at University of Alaska Fairbanks, said, &quot;I tore that plant apart. There were no toxins. No alkaloids. I&#x27;d eat it myself.&quot; Further, there are no accounts in modern medical literature of a person being poisoned by this species of plant. Power argued that McCandless &quot;couldn&#x27;t catch enough food to survive, and simply starved to death&quot;.

====Lathyrism due to ODAP in &quot;Hedysarum alpinum&quot; seeds====
In 2013, a new hypothesis was proposed. Ronald Hamilton, a retired bookbinder at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, suggested a link between the symptoms described by McCandless and the poisoning of Jewish prisoners in the concentration camp at Vapniarca. He put forward the proposal that McCandless starved to death because he was suffering from paralysis in his legs induced by lathyrism, which prevented him from gathering food or hiking. Lathyrism may be caused by oxalyldiaminopropionic acid (ODAP) poisoning from seeds of &quot;Hedysarum alpinum&quot;.

The ODAP, a toxic amino acid, had not been detected by Clausen&#x27;s previous studies of the seeds because he had suspected and tested for a toxic alkaloid, rather than an amino acid, as no scientist had previously suspected that &quot;Hedysarum alpinum&quot; seeds contained this toxin. The protein would be relatively harmless to someone who was well-nourished, with access to a normal diet, but would be toxic to someone who was malnourished, physically stressed, and on an irregular and insufficient diet, as McCandless was.

As Krakauer points out, McCandless&#x27;s field guide did not warn of any dangers of eating the seeds, which were not known to be toxic when the guide was published. Krakauer suspects that this is the meaning of McCandless&#x27;s journal entry of July 30, which states, &quot;EXTREMELY WEAK. FAULT OF POT[ATO] SEED. MUCH TROUBLE JUST TO STAND UP. STARVING. GREAT JEOPARDY.&quot;

In September 2013, Krakauer published an article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; following up on Hamilton&#x27;s claims. A sample of fresh &quot;Hedysarum alpinum&quot; seeds was sent to a laboratory for HPLC analysis. Results showed that the seeds contained 0.394% beta-ODAP by weight, a concentration well within the levels known to cause lathyrism in humans, although the interpretation of the results has been disputed by other chemists. The article notes that while occasional ingestion of foodstuffs containing ODAP is not hazardous for healthy individuals eating a balanced diet, &quot;individuals suffering from malnutrition, stress, and acute hunger are especially sensitive to ODAP, and are thus highly susceptible to the incapacitating effects of lathyrism after ingesting the neurotoxin&quot;.

====L-canavanine in &quot;Hedysarum alpinum&quot; seeds====
In March 2015, Krakauer co-authored a scientific analysis of the &quot;Hedysarum alpinum&quot; seeds McCandless ate. Instead of ODAP, the report found relatively high levels of L-canavanine (an antimetabolite toxic to mammals) in the &quot;H. alpinum&quot; seeds and concluded &quot;it is highly likely that the consumption of H. alpinum seeds contributed to the death of Chris McCandless.&quot;

==Legacy==

The converted green and white bus where McCandless lived and died became a well-known destination for hikers. Known as &quot;The Magic Bus&quot;, the 1946 International Harvester was abandoned by road workers in 1961 on the Stampede Trail. A plaque in McCandless&#x27;s memory was affixed to the interior by his father, Walt McCandless. McCandless&#x27;s life became the subject of numerous articles, books, films, and documentaries, which helped elevate his life to the status of modern myth. He became a romantic figure to some, inspired by what they see as his free-spirited transcendentalism, but to others, he is a controversial, misguided person.

&quot;The Magic Bus&quot; became a pilgrimage destination for trekkers who would camp at the vehicle. Some of these experienced their own difficulties, or even died attempting to cross the Teklanika River. According to one historian, the bus had become &quot;a latter-day &quot;lieu de mémoire&quot;&quot; — a “site of memory&quot; that both &quot;stored and secreted communal remembrance.&quot;

On June 18, 2020, various government agencies coordinated with an Alaska Army National Guard training mission to remove the bus, deemed a public safety issue after at least 15 people had to be rescued and at least two people died while attempting to cross the Teklanika River to reach the bus. It was flown via CH-47 Chinook helicopter to Healy, then driven via flatbed truck to an undisclosed location. On September 24, 2020, the Museum of the North at the University of Alaska Fairbanks announced it was the permanent home of McCandless&#x27;s &quot;Magic Bus 142&quot;, which will be restored and exhibited outdoors. It was exhibited indoors for two years, until October, 2023, but as of 2024 is being kept in storage until sufficient funds for restoration are raised.

==Assessments==
McCandless has been a polarizing figure since his story came to widespread public attention with the publication of Krakauer&#x27;s January 1993 &quot;Outside&quot; article. While the author and many others have a sympathetic view of the young traveler, others, particularly Alaskans, have expressed negative views about McCandless and those who romanticize his fate.

Alaskan Park Ranger Peter Christian wrote:

When you consider McCandless from my perspective, you quickly see that what he did wasn&#x27;t even particularly daring, just stupid, tragic, and inconsiderate. First off, he spent very little time learning how to actually live in the wild. He arrived at the Stampede Trail without even a map of the area. If he [had] had a good map he could have walked out of his predicament [...] Essentially, Chris McCandless committed suicide.

Ken Ilgunas, also an Alaskan Park Ranger and the author of &quot;The McCandless Mecca&quot;, wrote in response:

Before I go any further, I should say that Pete is a really good guy [...] But with that said, I think Pete is very, very wrong. [...] Because I am in the unique position as both an Alaskan park ranger and a person who is, in many ways, like Chris McCandless, I feel I can speak with some authority on the subject. [...] McCandless, of course, did not commit suicide. He starved to death, accidentally poisoned himself, or a combination of the two.
Sherry Simpson, writing in the &quot;Anchorage Press&quot;, described her trip to the bus with a friend, and their reaction upon reading the comments that tourists had left lauding McCandless as an insightful, Thoreau-like figure:

Among my friends and acquaintances, the story of Christopher McCandless makes great after-dinner conversation. Much of the time I agree with the &quot;he had a death wish&quot; camp because I don&#x27;t know how else to reconcile what we know of his ordeal. Now and then I venture into the &quot;what a dumbshit&quot; territory, tempered by brief alliances with the &quot;he was just another romantic boy on an all-American quest&quot; partisans. Mostly I&#x27;m puzzled by the way he&#x27;s emerged as a hero.

Krakauer defends McCandless, claiming that what critics point to as arrogance was merely McCandless&#x27;s desire for &quot;being the first to explore a blank spot on the map.&quot; He continues: &quot;In 1992, however, there were no more blank spots on the map—not in Alaska, not anywhere. But Chris, with his idiosyncratic logic, came up with an elegant solution to this dilemma: He simply got rid of the map. In his own mind, if nowhere else, the &quot;terra&quot; would thereby remain &quot;incognita&quot;.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Krakauer&#x27;s approximately 9,000-word article &quot;Death of an Innocent&quot; (January 1993) was published in &quot;Outside&quot;. Chip Brown&#x27;s full-length article on McCandless, &quot;I Now Walk Into the Wild&quot; (February 8, 1993), was published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Jon Krakauer&#x27;s non-fiction book &quot;Into the Wild&quot; (1996) expands upon his 1993 &quot;Outside&quot; article and retraces McCandless&#x27;s travels leading up to the hiker&#x27;s eventual death.

McCandless&#x27;s story was adapted by screenwriter Chip Johannessen into a 1998 episode of Chris Carter&#x27;s television series &quot;Millennium&quot;, titled &quot;Luminary.&quot;

An eponymous 2007 film adaptation of &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, directed by Sean Penn with Emile Hirsch portraying McCandless, received a number of awards, including Best Picture from the American Film Institute. Ron Lamothe&#x27;s documentary &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; (2007) also covers McCandless&#x27;s life story.

The book &quot;Back to the Wild&quot; (2011) compiles photographs, postcards and journal entries by McCandless. A PBS documentary uncovering some additional information, with interviews, titled &quot;Return to the Wild: The Chris McCandless Story&quot;, first aired on the PBS network in November 2014.

In 2014, Carine McCandless, Chris&#x27; sister, published &quot;The Wild Truth&quot;, a memoir of her life. It detailed their abusive home life, providing further context to Chris&#x27; actions.

The podcast &quot;You&#x27;re Wrong About&quot; discussed McCandless for its February 27, 2023 episode. The episode, with guest Blair Braverman, reviews several topics regarding the life, death, and legacy of McCandless and his impact on discussion of wilderness, Alaska, and domestic violence.

<text>The Barnum effect, also called the Forer effect or, less commonly, the Barnum–Forer effect, is a common psychological phenomenon whereby individuals give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically to them, yet which are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. This effect can provide a partial explanation for the widespread acceptance of some paranormal beliefs and practices, such as astrology, fortune telling, aura reading, and some types of personality tests.

Psychologist Bertram Forer originally named it the &quot;fallacy of personal validation&quot;. The term &quot;Barnum effect&quot; was coined in 1956 by psychologist Paul Meehl in his essay &quot;Wanted – A Good Cookbook&quot;, because he relates the vague personality descriptions used in certain &quot;pseudo-successful&quot; psychological tests to those given by showman P. T. Barnum.

==Overview==
The Barnum effect is manifested in response to statements that are called &quot;Barnum statements&quot;, meaning that general characterizations attributed to an individual are perceived to be true for them, even though the statements are such generalizations that they could apply to almost anyone. Such techniques are used by fortune tellers, astrologers, and other practitioners to convince customers that they, the practitioners, are in fact endowed with a paranormal gift. The effect is a specific example of the &quot;acceptance phenomenon&quot;, which describes the general tendency of humans &quot;to accept almost any bogus personality feedback&quot;. A related and more general phenomenon is that of subjective validation.

==Early research==
In 1947, psychologist Ross Stagner asked a number of personnel managers to take a personality test. After they had taken the test, Stagner, instead of responding with feedback based on their actual individual answers, presented each of them with generalized feedback that had no relation to their test answers but that was, instead, based on horoscopes, graphological analyses, and the like. Each of the managers was then asked how accurate the assessment was. More than half described the assessment as accurate, and almost none described it as wrong.

In 1948, in what has been described as a &quot;classic experiment&quot;, psychologist Forer gave a psychology test – his &quot;Diagnostic Interest Blank&quot; – to 39 of his psychology students, who were told that they would each receive a brief personality vignette based on their test results. One week later Forer gave each student a purportedly individualized vignette and asked each of them to rate it on how well it applied. In reality, each student received the same vignette, consisting of the following items:
On average, the students rated its accuracy as 4.30 on a scale of 0 (very poor) to 5 (excellent). Only after the ratings were turned in, it was revealed that all students had received an identical vignette assembled by Forer from a newsstand astrology book. 

Forer attributed the effect to gullibility. The effect has been said to confirm the Pollyanna principle, where individuals tend &quot;to use or accept positive words of feedback more frequently than negative words of feedback&quot;.

== Factors influencing the effect==
Two factors are important in producing the Forer effect, according to the findings of replication studies. The content of the description offered is important, with specific emphasis on the ratio of positive to negative trait assessments. The other important factor is that the subject trusts the honesty of the person providing feedback.

The effect is consistently found when the assessment statements are vague. People are able to read their own meaning into the statements they receive, and thus the statement becomes &quot;personal&quot; to them. The most effective statements include the phrase &quot;at times&quot;, such as &quot;At times you feel very sure of yourself, while at other times you are not as confident.&quot; This phrase can apply to almost anyone, and thus each person can read a &quot;personal&quot; meaning into it. Keeping statements vague in this manner ensures observing the Forer effect in replication studies.

Individuals are more likely to accept negative assessments of themselves if they perceive the persons presenting the assessments as high-status professionals. Evidence also suggests that people with authoritarian or neurotic personalities or who have a greater than usual need for approval are more likely to manifest the Barnum effect.

Later studies have found that subjects give higher accuracy ratings if the following are true:
* The subject believes that the analysis is personalized, and thus applies personal meaning to the statements.
* The subject believes in the authority of the evaluator.
* The analysis lists mainly positive traits.

==Exploiting the effect==

In 1977, Ray Hyman wrote about the way in which hucksters exploit the Forer effect to take advantage of victims (or &quot;marks&quot;). He provided a list of factors that help these tricksters to dupe their prey. For example, hucksters are more likely to be successful if they exude an air of confidence (&quot;If you look and act as if you believe in what you are doing, you will be able to sell even a bad reading to most of your subjects&quot;), if they &quot;[m]ake creative use of the latest statistical abstracts, polls, and surveys&quot; showing &quot;what various subclasses of our society believe, do, want, worry about, and so on&quot;, if they employ &quot;a gimmick, such as a crystal ball, tarot cards, or palm reading&quot;, if they are alert to the clues provided about their clients by such details as their &quot;clothing, jewelry, mannerisms and speech&quot;, if they are not afraid of &quot;hamming it up&quot;, and if they use flattery.

Michael Birnbaum, a professor of psychology at California State University, Fullerton, has noted that the Forer effect is used by magicians and psychics when they give &quot;cold readings&quot;, as well as by certain TV personalities who claim psychoanalytical expertise and profess to be able to diagnose a guest&#x27;s psychological problems in a few minutes. &quot;Real psychologists are horrified by this practice&quot;, states Birnbaum, but they fail to criticize it vigorously enough in public, and so it continues to be treated with a respect it doesn&#x27;t deserve. &quot;It is regrettable that academic psychology has not paid more attention to the cold reading technique&quot;, Denis Dutton wrote in 1988, &quot;in as much as the widespread practice of successful cold reading forms the basis for much of the belief in paranormal powers to be found in society today.&quot; While academic psychologists had focused in their studies on students, Dutton called for &quot;analysis of the actual techniques and methods used by proficient cold readers&quot;.

&quot;The moral of the Barnum demonstration&quot;, Birnbaum has said, is that &quot;self-validation is no validation. Do not be fooled by a psychic, quack psychotherapist, or a phony faith healer who uses this trick on you! Be skeptical and ask for proof. Keep your money in your wallet, your wallet in your pocket, and your hand on your wallet.&quot;

<text>Windows on the World was a complex of dining, meeting, and entertainment venues on the top floors (106th and 107th) of the North Tower (Building One) of the original World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan, New York City, United States.

It included a restaurant called Windows on the World, a smaller restaurant called Wild Blue (before 1999 was called &quot;Cellar in the Sky&quot;), a bar called The Greatest Bar on Earth (which had previously been the Hors d&#x27;Oeuvrerie) as well as a wine school and conference and banquet rooms for private functions located on the 106th floor. Developed by restaurateur Joe Baum and designed initially by Warren Platner, Windows on the World occupied of space in the North Tower. The Skydive Restaurant, which was a 180 seat cafeteria on the 44th floor of 1 WTC conceived for office workers, was also operated by Windows on the World.

The restaurants opened on April 19, 1976, and were destroyed in the September 11 attacks. All of the staff members who were present in the restaurant on the day of the attacks perished; the plane&#x27;s impact severed all means of escape from the 92nd floor up.

==Operations==

The main dining room faced north and east, allowing guests to look out onto the skyline of Manhattan. The dress code required jackets for men and was strictly enforced; a man who arrived with a reservation but without a jacket was seated at the bar. The restaurant offered jackets that were loaned to the patrons so they could eat in the main dining room. The dinnerware, rugs, lighting fixtures, menus and the communication equipment were designed by Milton Glaser.

A more intimate dining room, Wild Blue, was located on the south side of the restaurant. The bar extended along the south side of 1 World Trade Center as well as the corner over part of the east side. Looking out from the bar through the full length windows, one could see views of the southern tip of Manhattan, where the Hudson and East Rivers meet. In addition, one could see the Liberty State Park with Ellis Island and Staten Island with the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. The kitchens, utility spaces, and conference center in the restaurant were located on the 106th floor.

Windows on the World closed after the 1993 bombing, in which employee Wilfredo Mercado was killed while checking in deliveries in the building&#x27;s underground garage. The explosion also damaged receiving areas, storage and parking spots used by the restaurant complex. On May 12, 1994, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced that the Joseph Baum &amp; Michael Whiteman Company had won the contract to run the restaurants after Windows&#x27;s former operator, Inhilco, gave up its lease. It underwent a US$25 million renovation and reopened on June 26, 1996. Cellar in the Sky, a 60-seat space within the restaurant, reopened after Labor Day. In 1999, Cellar in the Sky was changed into an American steakhouse and renamed &quot;Wild Blue&quot;. In 2000, its final full year of operation, it reported revenues of US$37 million, making it the highest-grossing restaurant in the United States.

The executive chefs of Windows on the World included Philippe Feret of Brasserie Julien while the last chef was Michael Lomonaco.

==September 11 attacks==
Windows on the World was destroyed when the North Tower collapsed during the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. While the restaurant was hosting regular breakfast patrons and the Risk Waters Financial Technology Congress, Egyptian terrorist Mohamed Atta and four other Al-Qaeda hijackers crashed American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower between floors 93 and 99 at 8:46a.m. Everyone present in the restaurant died that day, as all means of escape (including the stairwells and elevators leading down from the impact zones) were instantly severed by the impact. Victims trapped in Windows on the World either died from smoke inhalation from the ensuing fire, jumping or falling to their deaths from the restaurant, or being killed in the eventual collapse of the North Tower. At least five Windows occupants were witnessed jumping or falling to their deaths from the restaurant.

There were 72 restaurant staff present in the restaurant, including assistant general manager Christine Olender, whose desperate calls to Port Authority police represented the restaurant&#x27;s final communications. Sixteen Incisive Media-Risk Waters Group employees, as well as 76 other guests/contractors, were also present. Among those also present was the executive director of the Port Authority, Neil Levin, who was having breakfast. After about 9:40a.m., no further distress calls from the restaurant were made. The last people to leave the restaurant before Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower at 8:46a.m. were Michael Nestor, Liz Thompson, Geoffrey Wharton, and Richard Tierney, who all shared an elevator together. They departed at 8:44a.m. and survived the attack.

World Trade Center lessor Larry Silverstein regularly held breakfast meetings in Windows on the World with tenants, as part of his recent acquisition of the Twin Towers from the Port Authority, and was scheduled to be in the restaurant on the morning of the attacks. However, his wife insisted that he had to go to a dermatologist&#x27;s appointment that morning, whereby he avoided death.

== Impact ==

=== Reception ===
In its last iteration, Windows on the World received mixed reviews. Ruth Reichl, a &quot;New York Times&quot; food critic, said in December 1996 that &quot;nobody will ever go to Windows on the World just to eat, but even the fussiest food person can now be content dining at one of New York&#x27;s favorite tourist destinations.&quot; She gave the restaurant two out of four stars, signifying a &quot;very good&quot; quality rather than &quot;excellent&quot; (three stars) or &quot;extraordinary&quot; (four stars). In his 2009 book &quot;Appetite&quot;, William Grimes wrote that &quot;At Windows, New York was the main course.&quot; In 2014, Ryan Sutton of &quot;Eater.com&quot; compared the now-destroyed restaurant&#x27;s cuisine to that of its replacement, One World Observatory. He stated, &quot;Windows helped usher in a new era of captive audience dining in that the restaurant was a destination in itself, rather than a lazy byproduct of the vital institution it resided in.&quot;

=== Legacy ===
Windows of Hope Family Relief Fund was organized soon after the attacks to provide support and services to the families of those in the food, beverage, and hospitality industries who had been killed on September 11 in the World Trade Center. Windows on the World executive chef Michael Lomonaco and owner-operator David Emil were among the founders of that fund.

On January 4, 2006, a number of former Windows on the World staff opened Colors, a co-operative restaurant in Manhattan that serves as a tribute to their colleagues and whose menu reflects the diversity of the former Windows&#x27; staff. The original location closed in 2017 and reopened in 2019. Windows on the World was planned to reopen on the top floors of the new One World Trade Center, but that project was canceled in 2011. Instead, One World Observatory contains eateries named ONE Dine, ONE Mix and ONE Café.

=== Cultural influence ===
It has been speculated that &quot;The Falling Man&quot;, a famous photograph of a man dressed in white falling headfirst on September 11, was an employee at Windows on the World. Although his identity has never been conclusively established, he was believed to be Jonathan Briley, an audio technician at the restaurant. Jonathan was the younger brother of Alex Briley, the original &quot;G.I.&quot; from the band Village People.

In March 2005, the novel &quot;Windows on the World&quot;, by French novelist Frédéric Beigbeder, was released; the novel focuses on two brothers who are in the restaurant on September 11 with their father. Kenneth Womack&#x27;s 2012 novel &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the World&quot; is a fictive recreation of the lives of the staff and visitors at the Windows on the World complex on the morning of September 11.

In 2021 young adult novelist Alan Gratz published a book called &quot;Ground Zero&quot; about a boy named Brandon who is with his father in Windows on the World on the morning of September 11, 2001.

<text>William Laimbeer Jr. (born May 19, 1957) is an American former professional basketball coach and player who spent the majority of his career with the Detroit Pistons. Known for his physical style of play, he played a big part in the Pistons earning the nickname the “Bad Boys&quot; in the mid-1980s before helping them win back-to-back NBA championships.

In his National Basketball Association (NBA) career, Laimbeer was known for his 11-year tenure with the Detroit Pistons during their &quot;Bad Boys&quot; era. Although a solid shooter and rebounder, Laimbeer became notorious for his physical play and reputation for delivering hard, often flagrant fouls. Laimbeer played at center with Hall of Fame backcourt guards Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars and forward Dennis Rodman, winning back-to-back NBA Championships in 1989 and 1990 with the Pistons, and being named an NBA All-Star four times. Prior to the NBA, he played for the University of Notre Dame and Palos Verdes High School in Southern California.

After his playing career, Laimbeer served as the head coach and general manager of the Detroit Shock in the WNBA from 2002 to 2009, coaching the team to three league championships in 2003, 2006, and 2008. He was the head coach of the New York Liberty from 2013 to 2017 and the head coach of the Las Vegas Aces from 2018 until 2021. He has twice been named the WNBA&#x27;s Coach of the Year.

==Early life==

Laimbeer was born in Boston and raised in the Chicago suburb of Clarendon Hills before moving with his family to Palos Verdes Estates, California. His father, William Laimbeer Sr., was an Owens-Illinois executive who rose as high as company president. The younger Laimbeer once famously joked, &quot;I&#x27;m the only player in the NBA who makes less money than his father.&quot;

Laimbeer played a Sleestak on the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; before attending Notre Dame. He was a Palos Verdes High School student, and the &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; show solicited their basketball team for tall people to play Sleestaks.

As a senior in high school in 1975, Laimbeer led Palos Verdes to a CIF basketball title and a stunning upset over 6 time defending champion Verbum Dei.

== College career ==
For college, Laimbeer attended Notre Dame where he played basketball, but he flunked out after his freshman year. To regain his eligibility, he spent two semesters at Owens Technical College in Toledo, Ohio. Laimbeer then re-entered Notre Dame. He spent two years playing for Notre Dame&#x27;s basketball team. For his last two years of college, he averaged 7.3 points and 6.0 rebounds per game while playing 20 minutes a game, primarily as a substitute. With the Fighting Irish, Laimbeer appeared in the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament in 1978, and the Elite Eight in 1975

==Professional career==

=== Brescia (1979–1980) ===
Laimbeer was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 1979, but the team&#x27;s hesitation in signing him to a contract led him to instead spend his first professional season in Europe. He played in Italy for Pinti Inox Brescia, where he averaged 21.1 points and 12.5 rebounds.

=== Cleveland Cavaliers (1980–1982) ===
Laimbeer returned to play for the Cavaliers in 1980. He was a reserve for the entire 1980–81 season and started only 4 games for the 1981–82 team.

=== Detroit Pistons (1982–1993) ===
On February 16, 1982, Laimbeer was traded to the Detroit Pistons, where he remained for the rest of his career. He was immediately installed as the Pistons starting center. During his playing career, Laimbeer was one of the most notorious players in the NBA. While highly popular among Piston fans, Laimbeer was despised by opposing players and fans for his disdain of his opponents, his poor sportsmanship, and his dangerous play, such as repeatedly committing violent intentional fouls. In the public eye, Laimbeer&#x27;s reputation for physical play tended to overshadow his skills. His former teammate Dennis Rodman noted this in his book &quot;Bad As I Wanna Be&quot;, saying, &quot;He [Laimbeer] was more than a thug, but that&#x27;s what he&#x27;ll be remembered for.&quot; In an interview for the 1990 NBA Home Video release &quot;Pure Pistons,&quot; teammate Isiah Thomas also talked about Laimbeer&#x27;s effect on opposing players, saying, &quot;He frustrates people,&quot; but then added, &quot;He frustrates people...because he&#x27;s &quot;good&quot;.&quot;

In the ESPN &quot;30 for 30&quot; film &quot;Bad Boys&quot;, Laimbeer said his approach to the game was all psychological. When the Pistons would take to the court before a game, Laimbeer made it a point to lead the rest of the team out from the locker room and he always did so with a scowl on his face to show he was not intimidated by anyone.

While a serviceable and solid player for most of his career, Laimbeer knew there were better skilled players than him. However, there were not as many players who were as physical on the court as he was, and Laimbeer was able to use that to his advantage. The hard-nosed approach he used was designed to wear on opposing players to the point where they began focusing more on retaliating against him and the rest of the Pistons instead of trying to win the game; Laimbeer said if he was able to do that to an opponent during the course of a game, he had broken him down. He even said the local media would play a role as his and the team&#x27;s reputation preceded them: &quot;When the Pistons came into a town, all the media would write about were the &#x27;Bad Boys&#x27; and how rough we played. They&#x27;d be asking players if they were going to stand up to us. And once we got teams thinking like that, we had them. We already got them out of their game.&quot;

Laimbeer was one of the top outside-shooting centers of his era, draining over 200 three-pointers for his career, and excelled at running the pick and pop with guards Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars. Then-head coach Chuck Daly used Laimbeer&#x27;s inside-outside skills to great effect. On the defensive end, Laimbeer was one of the best rebounders in the game. On the offensive end, Daly would often have Laimbeer fade to the perimeter rather than roll to the basket, which had the additional effect of keeping the opposing team&#x27;s best rebounder far from the backboard. Laimbeer was selected to the NBA All-Star Game on four occasions (1983, 1984, 1985 and 1987) and finished among the league leaders in rebounding and free throw percentage several times, winning the rebound title in the 1985–86 season. Laimbeer started on the Pistons&#x27; 1989 and 1990 NBA championship teams.

Laimbeer spent 14 seasons in the NBA, mostly with the Detroit Pistons. Laimbeer became the 19th player in league history to amass more than 10,000 points and 10,000 rebounds. Laimbeer was most effective off the defensive glass – from 1982 to 1990 no player in the league totaled more defensive rebounds. He was also remarkably durable, never playing fewer than 79 regular-season games during his first 13 seasons, and playing all 82 games seven times. His streak of 685 consecutive games played (which ended due to suspension in the 1988–89 season) is the fifth longest in league history. Laimbeer retired early in the 1993–94 season at age 36 after an incident in practice with longtime friend Isiah Thomas that led to Thomas breaking his hand. Laimbeer, upset over the fight as well as worried over the reaction of Pistons fans for injuring their team captain, decided to retire, believing the fight with Isiah was his &quot;downfall&quot;. He announced his retirement after a meeting with Thomas and head coach Don Chaney that ended with him and Thomas teary-eyed and remaining best friends. Laimbeer had his jersey number (40) retired by the Pistons in February 1995. He remains the franchise&#x27;s all-time leader in career rebounds.

Laimbeer endorsed a video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, &quot;Bill Laimbeer&#x27;s Combat Basketball&quot;, a futuristic basketball game in which physical play is encouraged. In a cameo in the ninth season of &quot;Cheers,&quot; Kevin McHale of the rival Celtics remarked, when presented with the X-Ray of an adult male gorilla&#x27;s ankle, &quot;...could be Laimbeer.&quot;

==Post-playing life==
In 1994, Laimbeer and his father, William Sr. co-founded Laimbeer Packaging Corp., a company located in Melvindale, Michigan, a Detroit suburb, producing corrugated cardboard boxes. The company struggled through the late 1990s and closed in early 2002. 
Laimbeer won the NBA Shooting Stars Competition at the 2007 All-Star Weekend in Las Vegas along with Chauncey Billups of the Detroit Pistons and Swin Cash of the Detroit Shock. In February 2009 he won the competition with Arron Afflalo and Katie Smith. In 1999, Laimbeer was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame.

Laimbeer is a former color commentator for the Pistons and was a studio analyst for ESPN in 2003.

==Coaching career==

=== Detroit Shock (2002–2009) ===
In the middle of the 2002 WNBA season, Laimbeer took over the head coaching position for the Detroit Shock. A year later, he led the franchise to its first WNBA championship and was named Coach of the Year that year. It marked the first time in WNBA history that a team other than Los Angeles or Houston won the title. On September 9, 2006, Laimbeer led the Shock to their second WNBA championship against the Sacramento Monarchs in five games. Two years later, on October 5, 2008, Laimbeer led the team to its third league championship in six years by defeating San Antonio.

Laimbeer has talked about the possibility of one day coaching in the NBA. The New York Knicks&#x27; former team president, former Piston teammate Isiah Thomas, once considered Laimbeer as a possibility. The Pistons, presided by former teammate Joe Dumars, had considered the possibility of Laimbeer replacing departing coach Larry Brown, before ultimately hiring former Minnesota Timberwolves head coach Flip Saunders.

On June 15, 2009, Laimbeer resigned as head coach of the Detroit Shock, due to family reasons and the desire to become an NBA head coach.

=== Minnesota Timberwolves (2009–2012) ===
Though he was unable to secure an NBA head coaching position, that same year Laimbeer was offered, and accepted, an assistant coach position with the Minnesota Timberwolves.

=== New York Liberty (2012–2017) ===
In 2012, Laimbeer returned to the WNBA to become the head coach and general manager of the New York Liberty, replacing John Whisenant. He quickly returned to his pugnacious ways, drawing a fine for saying Minnesota Lynx player Maya Moore &quot;should get hurt&quot; for playing late into a game in which the Lynx easily defeated the Liberty.

On October 14, 2014, the Liberty parted ways with Laimbeer after two seasons, but he was rehired as the Liberty head coach on January 8, 2015.

=== Las Vegas Aces (2018–2021) ===
On October 17, 2017, the then-unnamed Las Vegas Aces announced Laimbeer as head coach and President of Basketball Operations. Laimbeer coached the Aces through 2021. After the 2021 season Laimbeer retired from coaching.

In total, Laimbeer finished first seven times as a head coach in the WNBA, winning the WNBA Finals three times in five trips.

==In popular culture==
In 1990, Nintendo ported a game called &quot;Future Basketball&quot; to their SNES console under the name Bill Laimbeer&#x27;s Combat Basketball. The game was set in a future where Laimbeer was commissioner of a basketball league with no rules, and weapons allowed.

The song &quot;Tough Guy&quot; off the 1994 Beastie Boys album &quot;Ill Communication&quot; deals with Laimbeer and criticizes his physically aggressive style of playing basketball.

Laimbeer is referenced by name in the 2005 song &quot;Welcome to Tally Hall&quot; by Michigan-based band Tally Hall.

<text>Leslie Feinberg (September 1, 1949 – November 15, 2014) was an American butch lesbian, transgender activist, communist, and author. Feinberg authored &quot;Stone Butch Blues&quot; in 1993. writing, notably &quot;Stone Butch Blues&quot; and pioneering non-fiction book &quot;Transgender Warriors&quot; (1996), laid the groundwork for much of the terminology and awareness around gender studies and was instrumental in bringing these issues to a more mainstream audience.

== Early life ==
Feinberg was born in Kansas City, Missouri and raised in Buffalo, New York in a working-class, Jewish family. At fourteen years old, began work at a display sign shop at a local department store. Feinberg eventually dropped out of Bennett High School, though officially received a diploma. Feinberg began frequenting gay bars in Buffalo and primarily worked in low-wage and temporary jobs, including washing dishes, cleaning cargo ships, working as an ASL interpreter, inputting medical data, and working at a PVC pipe factory and a book bindery.

== Career ==
When Feinberg was in twenties, met members of the Workers World Party at a demonstration for the land rights and self-determination of Palestinians and joined the Buffalo branch of the party. After moving to New York City, Feinberg took part in anti-war, anti-racist, and pro-labor demonstrations on behalf of the party for many years, including the March Against Racism (Boston, 1974), a national tour about HIV/AIDS (1983–84), and a mobilization against KKK members (Atlanta, 1988).

Feinberg began writing in the 1970s. As a member of the Workers World Party, was the editor of the political prisoners page of the &quot;Workers World&quot; newspaper for fifteen years, and by 1995, had become the managing editor.

Feinberg&#x27;s first novel, the 1993 &quot;Stone Butch Blues&quot;, won the Lambda Literary Award and the 1994 American Library Association Gay &amp; Lesbian Book Award (now called the Stonewall Book Award). While there are parallels to Feinberg&#x27;s experiences as a working-class dyke, the work is not an autobiography. second novel, &quot;Drag King Dreams&quot;, was released in 2006.

 nonfiction work included the books &quot;Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Transgender Warriors: Making History from Joan of Arc to Dennis Rodman&quot; in 1996. Also in 1996, Feinberg appeared in Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s documentary, &quot;Transexual Menace&quot;. In 2009, released &quot;Rainbow Solidarity in Defense of Cuba&quot;—a compilation of 25 journalistic articles.

In &quot;Transgender Warriors&quot;, Feinberg suggests that the term &quot;transgender&quot; was commonly used in two different ways. It served as an umbrella term encompassing anyone who questions or challenges traditional ideas of sex and gender. Additionally, it referred specifically to the distinction between individuals who change the sex assigned to them at birth and those whose gender expression is seen as not aligning with societal expectations for their sex.

Feinberg&#x27;s writings on LGBT history, &quot;Lavender &amp; Red&quot;, frequently appeared in the &quot;Workers World&quot; newspaper. Feinberg was awarded an honorary doctorate from Starr King School for the Ministry for transgender and social justice work.

Feinberg was outspoken about her support for Palestinians. In a 2007 speech given to the first public conference of Aswat, an organization for LGBT Palestinian women, in Haifa in 2007, Feinberg said, &quot;I am with Palestinian liberation with every breath in my body; every muscle and every sinew.&quot; In a 2006 interview with Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore about &quot;Drag King Dreams&quot;, Feinberg said of her novel&#x27;s Jewish characters, &quot;for Heshie and Max, this question of the occupation of Palestine goes to the heart of what it means to live an authentic life in a period in which this really historical crime is taking place in their name.&quot;

In June 2019 Feinberg was one of the inaugural fifty American &quot;pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes&quot; inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City&#x27;s Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall&#x27;s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

== Illness ==
In 2008, Feinberg was diagnosed with Lyme disease. She wrote that the infection first came about in the 1970s, when there was limited knowledge related to such diseases and that felt hesitant to deal with medical professionals for many years due to transgender identity. For this reason, only received treatment later in life. In the 2000s, Feinberg created art and blogged about illnesses with a focus on disability art and class consciousness.

== Personal life ==
Feinberg described herself as &quot;an anti-racist white, working-class, secular Jewish, transgender, lesbian, female, revolutionary communist.&quot;

According to Julie Enszer, a friend of Feinberg&#x27;s, Feinberg sometimes &quot;passed&quot; as a man for safety reasons.

Feinberg&#x27;s spouse, Minnie Bruce Pratt, was a professor at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York. Feinberg and Pratt married in New York and Massachusetts in 2011. In the mid and late 1990s they attended Camp Trans together.

Feinberg died on November 15, 2014, of complications due to multiple tick-borne infections, including &quot;Lyme disease, babeisiosis, and protomyxzoa rheumatica&quot;, which had suffered from since the 1970s. Feinberg&#x27;s last words were reported to be, &quot;Hasten the revolution! Remember me as a revolutionary communist.&quot;

=== Pronoun usage ===
Feinberg stated in a 2006 interview that pronouns varied depending on context:

Feinberg&#x27;s widow wrote in statement regarding Feinberg&#x27;s death that Feinberg did not really care which pronouns a person used to address : &quot;She preferred to use the pronouns /zie and /hir for herself, but also said: &#x27;I care which pronoun is used, but people have been respectful to me with the wrong pronoun and disrespectful with the right one. It matters whether someone is using the pronoun as a bigot, or if they are trying to demonstrate respect.

<text>Deutsche Physik (, &quot;German Physics&quot;) or Aryan Physics () was a nationalist movement in the German physics community in the early 1930s which had the support of many eminent physicists in Germany. The term appears in the title of a four-volume physics textbook by Nobel laureate Philipp Lenard in the 1930s.

&quot;Deutsche Physik&quot; was opposed to the work of Albert Einstein and other modern theoretically based physics, which was disparagingly labeled &quot;Jewish physics&quot; ().

==Origins==

This movement began as an extension of a German nationalistic movement in the physics community which went back to the start of World War I with Austria&#x27;s declaration of war on 28 July 1914. On 25 August 1914, during the German Rape of Belgium, German troops used petrol to set fire to the library of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. The burning of the library led to a protest note which was signed by eight distinguished British scientists, namely William Bragg, William Crookes, Alexander Fleming, Horace Lamb, Oliver Lodge, William Ramsay, Lord Rayleigh, and J. J. Thomson. In 1915, this led to a counter-reaction in the form of an &quot;appeal&quot; formulated by Wilhelm Wien and addressed to German physicists and scientific publishers, which was signed by sixteen German physicists, including Arnold Sommerfeld and Johannes Stark. They claimed that German character had been misinterpreted and that attempts made over many years to reach an understanding between the two countries had obviously failed. Therefore, they opposed the use of the English language by German scientific authors, editors of books, and translators. A number of German physicists, including Max Planck and the especially passionate Philipp Lenard, a scientific rival of J. J. Thomson, had then signed further &quot;declarations&quot;, so that gradually a &quot;war of the minds&quot; broke out. On the German side it was suggested to avoid an unnecessary use of English language in scientific texts (concerning, e.g., the renaming of German-discovered phenomena with perceived English-derived names, such as &quot;X-ray&quot; instead of &quot;Röntgen ray&quot;). It was stressed, however, that this measure should not be misunderstood as a rejection of British scientific thought, ideas and stimulations.

After the war, the perceived affronts of the Treaty of Versailles kept some of these nationalistic feelings running high, especially in Lenard, who had already complained about England in a small pamphlet at the beginning of the war. When, on 26 January 1920, the former naval cadet Oltwig von Hirschfeld tried to assassinate German Finance minister Matthias Erzberger, Lenard sent Hirschfeld a telegram of congratulation. After the 1922 assassination of politician Walther Rathenau, the government ordered flags flown at half mast on the day of his funeral, but Lenard ignored the order at his institute in Heidelberg. Socialist students organized a demonstration against Lenard, who was taken into protective custody by state prosecutor Hugo Marx.

During the early years of the twentieth century, Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity caused bitter controversy within the worldwide physics community. There were many physicists, especially the &quot;old guard&quot;, who were suspicious of the intuitive meanings of Einstein&#x27;s theories. While the response to Einstein was based partly on his concepts being a radical break from earlier theories, there was also an anti-Jewish element to some of the criticism. The leading theoretician of the &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot; type of movement was Rudolf Tomaschek, who had re-edited the famous physics textbook &quot;Grimsehl&#x27;s Lehrbuch der Physik&quot;. In that book, which consists of several volumes, the Lorentz transformation was accepted, as well as the old quantum theory. However, Einstein&#x27;s interpretation of the Lorentz transformation was not mentioned, and Einstein&#x27;s name was completely ignored. Many classical physicists resented Einstein&#x27;s dismissal of the notion of a luminiferous aether, which had been a mainstay of their work for the majority of their productive lives. They were not convinced by the empirical evidence for relativity. They believed that the measurements of the perihelion of Mercury and the null result of the Michelson–Morley experiment might be explained in other ways, and the results of the Eddington eclipse experiment were experimentally problematic enough to be dismissed as meaningless by the more devoted doubters. Many of them were very distinguished experimental physicists, and Lenard was himself a Nobel laureate in Physics.

==Under the Third Reich==
When the Nazis entered the political scene, Lenard quickly attempted to ally himself with them, joining the party at an early stage. With another Nobel laureate in Physics, Johannes Stark, Lenard began a core campaign to label Einstein&#x27;s relativity as &quot;Jewish physics&quot;.

Lenard and Stark benefited considerably from this Nazi support. Under the rallying cry that physics should be more &quot;German&quot; and &quot;Aryan&quot;, Lenard and Stark embarked on a Nazi-endorsed plan to replace physicists at German universities with &quot;Aryan physicists&quot;. By 1935, though, this campaign was superseded by the Nuremberg Laws of 1935. There were no longer any Jewish physics professors in Germany, since under the Nuremberg Laws, Jews were not allowed to work in universities. Stark in particular also tried to install himself as the national authority on &quot;German&quot; physics under the principle of (literally, &quot;coordination&quot;) applied to other professional disciplines. Under this Nazi-era paradigm, academic disciplines and professional fields followed a strictly linear hierarchy created along ideological lines.

The figureheads of &quot;Aryan physics&quot; met with moderate success, but the support from the Nazi Party was not as great as Lenard and Stark would have preferred. They began to fall from influence after a long period of harassment of quantum physicist Werner Heisenberg, which included getting him labeled a &quot;White Jew&quot; in . Heisenberg was an extremely eminent physicist, and the Nazis realized that they were better off with him rather than without, however &quot;Jewish&quot; his theory might be in the eyes of Stark and Lenard. In an historic moment, Heisenberg&#x27;s mother rang Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s mother and asked her whether she would please tell the SS to give &quot;Werner&quot; a break. After beginning a full character evaluation, which Heisenberg both instigated and passed, Himmler forbade further attack on the physicist. Heisenberg would later employ his &quot;Jewish physics&quot; in the German project to develop nuclear fission for the purposes of nuclear weapons or nuclear energy use. Himmler promised Heisenberg that after Germany won the war, the SS would finance a physics institute to be directed by Heisenberg.

Lenard began to play less and less of a role, and soon Stark ran into even more difficulty, as other scientists and industrialists known for being exceptionally &quot;Aryan&quot; came to the defense of relativity and quantum mechanics. As historian Mark Walker puts it:
==Effect on the German nuclear program==
It is occasionally put forth that there is a great irony in the Nazis&#x27; labeling modern physics as &quot;Jewish science&quot;, since it was exactly modern physics—and the work of many European exiles—which was used to create the atomic bomb. Even if the German government had not embraced Lenard and Stark&#x27;s ideas, the German antisemitic agenda was enough by itself to destroy the Jewish scientific community in Germany. Furthermore, the German nuclear weapons program was never pursued with anywhere near the vigor of the Manhattan Project in the United States, and for that reason would likely not have succeeded in any case. The movement did not actually go as far as preventing the nuclear energy scientists from using quantum mechanics and relativity, but the education of young scientists and engineers suffered, not only from the loss of the Jewish scientists but also from political appointments and other interference.

<text>Franz Julius Ferdinand Meyen (28 June 1804 – 2 September 1840) was a Prussian physician and botanist.

Meyen was born in Tilsit, East Prussia. In 1830 he wrote &quot;Phytotomie&quot;, the first major study of plant anatomy. Between 1830 and 1832, he took part in an expedition to South America on board the &quot;Prinzess Luise&quot;, visiting Peru and Bolivia, describing species then new to science such as the Humboldt penguin.

From 1823 to 1826, he studied medicine at the University of Berlin, followed by service as a military surgeon at the Charité in Berlin. In 1834 he became an associate professor of botany in Berlin. With Heinrich Friedrich Link, he was co-editor of the journal &quot;Jahresberichte über die Arbeiten für physiologische Botanik&quot; (1837–1839).

He died in Berlin in 1840.

<text>The Flower-class corvette (also referred to as the &quot;Gladiolus&quot; class after the lead ship) was a British class of 294 corvettes used during World War II by the Allied navies particularly as anti-submarine convoy escorts in the Battle of the Atlantic. Royal Navy ships of this class were named after flowers.

Most served during World War II with the Royal Navy (RN) and Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). Several ships built largely in Canada were transferred from the RN to the United States Navy (USN) under the lend-lease programme, seeing service in both navies. Some corvettes transferred to the USN were crewed by the US Coast Guard. The vessels serving with the US Navy were known as Temptress- and &quot;Action&quot;-class patrol gunboats. Other Flower-class corvettes served with the Free French Naval Forces, the Royal Netherlands Navy, the Royal Norwegian Navy, the Royal Indian Navy, the Royal Hellenic Navy, the Royal New Zealand Navy, the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and, immediately after the war, the South African Navy.

After World War II many surplus Flower-class vessels were used in other navies, or for civilian use. is the only member of the class preserved as a museum ship.

==Class designation==
The term &quot;corvette&quot; was originally a French name for a small sailing warship, intermediate between the frigate and the sloop-of-war. In the 1830s the term was adopted by the RN for sailing warships of roughly similar size, primarily operating in the shipping protection role. With the arrival of steam power, paddle- and later screw-driven corvettes were built for the same purpose, growing in power, size, and armament over the decades. In 1877 the RN abolished the &quot;corvette&quot; as a traditional category; corvettes and frigates were then combined into a new category, &quot;cruiser&quot;.

The months leading up to World War II saw the RN return to the concept of a small escort warship being used in the shipping protection role. The Flower class was based on the design of &quot;Southern Pride&quot;, a whale-catcher, and were labelled &quot;corvettes&quot;, thus restoring the title for the RN, although the Flower-class has no connection with pre-1877 cruising vessels.

There are two distinct groups of vessels in this class: the &quot;original Flower-class&quot;, 225 vessels ordered during the 1939 and 1940 building programmes; and the &quot;modified Flower-class&quot;, which followed with a further 69 vessels ordered from 1940 onward. The modified Flowers were slightly larger and better armed.

Flower-class vessels, of original and modified design, in USN service were called &quot;Temptress&quot;- and &quot;Action&quot;-class gunboats; they carried the hull classification symbol PG (&quot;patrol gunboat&quot;).

==Design==

In early 1939, with the risk of war with Nazi Germany increasing, it was clear to the Royal Navy that it needed more escort ships to counter the threat from Kriegsmarine U-boats. One particular concern was the need to protect shipping off the east coast of Britain. What was needed was something larger and faster than trawlers, but still cheap enough to be built in large numbers, preferably at small merchant shipyards, as larger yards were already busy. To meet this requirement, the Smiths Dock Company of South Bank -on-Tees, a specialist in the design and build of fishing vessels, offered a development of its 700-ton, whaler (whale catcher) &quot;Southern Pride&quot;. They were intended as small convoy escort ships that could be produced quickly and cheaply in large numbers. Despite naval planners&#x27; intentions that they be deployed for coastal convoys, their long range meant that they became the mainstay of Mid-Ocean Escort Force convoy protection during the first half of the war.

The Flower class became an essential resource for North Atlantic convoy protection until larger vessels such as destroyer escorts and frigates could be produced in sufficient quantities. The simple design of the Flower class using parts and techniques (scantlings) common to merchant shipping meant they could be constructed in small commercial shipyards all over the United Kingdom and Canada, where larger (or more sophisticated) warships could not be built. Additionally, the use of commercial triple expansion machinery instead of steam turbines meant the largely Royal Naval Reserve and Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve crews that were manning the corvettes would be familiar with their operation.
Flower-class vessels were slow for a warship, with maximum speed of . They were also very lightly armed as they were intended solely for anti-submarine warfare; many of the RCN&#x27;s original Flower-class ships were initially fitted with minesweeping equipment, while virtually all of the modified Flowers were fitted with a limited anti-aircraft capability. The original Flowers had the standard RN layout, consisting of a raised forecastle, a well deck, then the bridge or wheelhouse and a continuous deck running aft. The crew quarters were in the forecastle while the galley was at the rear, making for poor messing arrangements. The modified Flowers saw the forecastle extended aft past the bridge to the aft end of the funnel, a variation known as the &quot;long forecastle&quot; design. Apart from providing a very useful space where the whole crew could gather out of the weather, the added weight improved the ships&#x27; stability and speed and was applied to a number of the original Flower-class vessels during the mid and latter years of the war. The original Flowers had a mast located immediately forward the bridge, a notable exception to naval practice at that time. The modified Flowers saw the mast returned to the normal position immediately aft of the bridge; this does not seem to have been done in all of the modified builds or conversions of the original vessels. A cruiser stern finished the appearance for all vessels in the class.

==Orders==

The RN ordered 145 Flower-class corvettes in 1939, the first 26 on 25 July with a further batch of 30 on 31 August, all under the 1939 Pre-War Programme. Following the outbreak of World War II, the British Admiralty ordered another 20 on 19 September (all from Harland &amp; Wolff) under the 1939 War Programme. This was followed by an order for a further ten Flower-class corvettes from other British shipbuilders two days later. Another 18 were ordered on 12 December and two on 15 December, again from British shipbuilders. The RN ordered the last ten vessels (under the 1939 War Programme) from Canadian shipbuilders in January 1940.

By the end of January 1940, 116 ships were building or on order to this initial design. The ten vessels ordered from Canadian shipbuilders were transferred to the RCN upon completion. Another four vessels were ordered at Smiths Dock Company for the French Navy, the first ship being completed for the Free French Naval Forces in mid-1940 and the other three being taken over by the RN. Another 31 Flowers were ordered by the RN under the 1940 War Programme but six of these (ordered from Harland &amp; Wolff) were cancelled on 23 January 1941.
The RN ordered 27 modified Flower-class corvettes under the 1941 and 1942 War Programmes. British shipbuilders were contracted to build seven of these vessels under the 1941 Programme and five vessels under the 1942 Programme; two vessels (one from each year&#x27;s Programme) were later cancelled. The RN ordered fifteen modified Flowers from Canadian shipyards under the 1941 programme; eight of these were transferred to the USN under reverse Lend-Lease.

The RCN ordered seventy original and 34 modified Flower-class vessels from Canadian shipbuilders. The Canadian shipbuilders also built seven original Flowers ordered by the USN, which were transferred to the RN under the Lend-Lease Programme upon completion, because wartime shipbuilding production in the United States had reached the level where the USN could dispense with vessels it had ordered in Canada. The RCN vessels had several design variations from their RN counterparts: the &quot;bandstand&quot;, where the aft pom-pom gun was mounted, was moved to the rear of the superstructure; the galley was also moved forward, immediately abaft the engine room.

Shortly after the outbreak of war the French Navy ordered 18 Flower-class vessels, 12 from UK yards, two from &quot;Ateliers et Chantiers de France&quot; at Dunkirk and four from &quot;Ateliers et Chantiers de Penhoët&quot; at Saint-Nazaire. The two At. &amp; Ch. de France ships are listed as &quot;cancelled&quot; but the four Penhoët ships were under construction at the time of the Fall of France and were seized by Nazi Germany. Three were completed for &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; service and commissioned in 1943–44 as the &quot;Patrouillenboot Ausland&quot; patrol ships.

==Armament==

The original Flower class were fitted with a 4-inch (102 mm) gun on the bow, depth charge racks carrying 40 charges on the stern, a minesweeping winch and a 2-pounder (40 mm) pom-pom gun on a &quot;bandstand&quot; over the engine room. Due to shortages, a pair of Lewis guns or quadruple Vickers HMG was sometimes substituted for the pom-pom, which would have left the ship very vulnerable to aircraft attack in its envisaged role of coastal convoy escort and patrol in the North Sea. The long-range endurance of the vessels, coupled with early war-time shortages of larger escort warships, saw Flowers assigned to trans-Atlantic convoy escort where &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft were rarely encountered. Vessels assigned to the Mediterranean Sea usually had more anti-aircraft guns fitted. Underwater detection capability was provided by a fixed ASDIC dome; this was later modified to be retractable. Subsequent inventions such as the High Frequency Radio Direction Finder (Huff-Duff) were later added, along with various radar systems (such as the Type 271), which proved particularly effective in low-visibility conditions in the North Atlantic.
The Flower class had been designed for inshore patrol and harbour anti-submarine defence and many required minor modifications when the Allied navies began to use them as trans-Atlantic convoy escorts. These small warships could be supported by any small dockyard or naval station, so many ships came to have a variety of weapons systems and design modifications depending upon when and where they were refitted; there is really no such thing as a &#x27;standard Flower-class corvette&#x27;

Several of the major changes that vessels in the class underwent are indicated below, in a typical chronological order:
* Original twin mast configuration changed to single mast in front of the bridge, then moved behind the bridge for improved visibility.
* Heavy minesweeping gear removed for deep-sea escort work and to improve range.
* Galley relocated from the stern to midships.
* Extra depth charge storage racks were fitted at the stern. Later, more depth charges stowed along walkways.
* Hedgehog fitted to enable remote attacks while keeping ASDIC contact.
* Surface radar fitted in a &quot;lantern&quot; housing on the bridge.
* Forecastle lengthened to midships to provide more accommodation and better seaworthiness. Several vessels were given a &quot;three-quarters length&quot; extension.
* Increased flare at the bow. This and the above modification created the modified Flower design for subsequent orders.
* Various changes to the bridge, typically lowering and lengthening it. Enclosed compass house removed.
* Extra twin Lewis guns mounted on the bridge or engine room roof.
* Oerlikon 20 mm cannons fitted, usually two on the bridge wings but sometimes as many as six spread out along the engine-room roof, depending on the theatre of operations.

A ship could have any mix of these, or other specialist one-off modifications. Ships allocated to other navies such as the RCN or USN usually had different armament and deck layouts. A major difference between the RN vessels and the RCN, USN, and other navies&#x27; vessels was the provision of upgraded ASDIC and radar. The RN was a world leader in developing these technologies and RN Flowers were somewhat better-equipped for remote detection of enemy submarines. A good example of this is the difficulty that RCN Flowers had in intercepting U-boats with their Canadian-designed SW1C metric radar, while the RN vessels were equipped with the technologically advanced Type 271 centimetric sets. In addition, RCN vessels were incapable of operating gyrocompasses, making ASDIC attacks more difficult.

==Operations==

Flower-class corvettes were used extensively by the RN and RCN in the Battle of the Atlantic. They also saw limited service elsewhere with the RN, as well as the USN and several Allied navies such as the Royal Netherlands Navy, the Royal Norwegian Navy, the Royal Hellenic Navy, the Free French Naval Forces, the Royal Indian Navy, and the Royal New Zealand Navy. The Belgian Navy used some of these vessels during World War II, and have continued to use Flower names for their minehunters. Most Royal Navy Flower-class ships drew their officers and crew from the Royal Naval Reserve and the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR). Many RN Flowers had captains drawn from the Merchant Navy.

Service on Flowers in the North Atlantic was typically cold, wet, monotonous and uncomfortable. Every dip of the forecastle into an oncoming wave was followed by a cascade of water into the well deck amidships. Men at action stations were drenched with spray and water entered living spaces through hatches opened for access to ammunition magazines. Interior decks were constantly wet and condensation dripped from the overheads. The head (or sanitary toilet) was drained by a straight pipe to the ocean; and a reverse flow of the icy North Atlantic would cleanse the backside of those using it during rough weather. By 1941 corvettes carried twice as many crewmen as anticipated in the original design. Men slept on lockers or tabletops or in any dark place that offered a little warmth. The inability to store perishable food meant a reliance on preserved food such as corned-beef and powdered potato for all meals.

The Flowers were nicknamed &quot;the pekingese of the ocean&quot;. They had a reputation of having poor sea-handling characteristics, most often rolling in heavy seas, with 80-degree rolls, 40 degrees each side of upright, being fairly common; it was said they &quot;would roll on wet grass&quot;. Many crewmen suffered severe motion sickness for a few weeks until they acclimatised to shipboard life. Although poor in their sea-handling characteristics, the Flowers were extremely seaworthy; no Allied sailor was ever lost overboard from a Flower during World War II, outside combat.

A typical action by a Flower encountering a surfaced U-boat during convoy escort duties was to run directly at the submarine, forcing it to dive and thus limiting its speed and manoeuvrability. The corvette would then keep the submarine down and preoccupied with avoiding depth charge attacks long enough to allow the convoy to pass safely. The top speed of the Flower-class ships made effective pursuit of a surfaced U-boat [about ] impossible, though it was adequate to manoeuvre around submerged U-boats or convoys, both of which ran at a typical maximum of and sometimes much less in poor weather. The low speed also made it difficult for Flowers to catch up with the convoy after action.
This technique was hampered when the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; began deploying its U-boats in &quot;wolf-pack&quot; attacks, which were intended to overwhelm the escort warships of a convoy and allow at least one of the submarines to attack the merchant vessels. Better sensors and armament for the Flowers, such as radar, HF/DF, depth charge projectors and ASDIC, meant these small warships were well equipped to detect and defend against such attacks but the tactical advantage often lay with the attackers, who could mount attacks intended to draw the defending Flower off-station. Success for the Flowers should be measured in terms of tonnage protected, rather than U-boats sunk. Typical reports of convoy actions by these craft include numerous instances of U-boat detection near a convoy, followed by brief engagements using guns or depth charges and a rapid return to station as another U-boat took advantage of the skirmish to attack the unguarded convoy.

Continuous actions against a numerically superior U-boat pack demanded considerable seamanship skills from all concerned and were very wearing on the crews. Thirty-six ships in the class were lost during World War II, many due to enemy action, some to collision with Allied warships and merchant ships. One, sunk in shallow water, was raised and repaired. Of the vessels lost to enemy action, 22 were torpedoed by U-boats, five were mined and four were sunk by aircraft. The Flower-class corvettes are credited with participating in the sinking of 47 German and four Italian submarines. Construction of the Flower-class was superseded toward the end of the war as larger shipyards concentrated on s and smaller yards on the improved design. The Flower class represented fully half of all Allied convoy escort vessels in the North Atlantic during World War II.

===Kriegsmarine use===

In 1940 four Flower-class corvettes were being built in St. Nazaire-Penhoet for the French Navy. They were seized by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; (German Navy). Three were completed in 1943 and 1944, while the fourth was never finished. Their designation &quot;PA&quot; stood for &quot;Patroullienboot Ausland&quot; (foreign patrol craft).

==Post-war use==
The relatively small Flowers were among the first warships to be declared surplus by Allied navies following the end of World War II. They had seen years of hard service in the North Atlantic and were made obsolete by the numerous destroyer escorts and frigates that entered service in the latter part of the war.

32 vessels from the RN, RCN, and USN were transferred to Argentina, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Greece, India, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, and Venezuela. These were typically operated according to their original design, as coastal patrol vessels, with many serving until the 1970s.

The Irish Navy bought three Flowers in 1946 (, , and ). The fledgling navy had intended to buy three more corvettes, as well as a number of surplus minesweepers, but severe budget restrictions cancelled these plans, leaving the original three to serve alone through the 1950s and 1960s despite antiquated armament, poor accommodation, and maintenance problems. Taken out of service 1968–1970 and scrapped shortly afterwards. Replaced by s before the building of a similar size vessel, LE &quot;Deirdre&quot;. Entry into the European Economic Community in 1973 assisted in funding for the building of three future ships.

110 surplus Flowers were sold for commercial use. These saw various careers as mercantile freighters, smugglers, tugs, weather ships, and whalers. The remainder were scrapped. Of particular interest is the story of . She was declared surplus by the RCN and sold as a towboat specializing in deep-sea salvage. In November 1955, she rescued the freighter &quot;Makedonia&quot; in the North Pacific, towing the vessel for over one month through severe weather, becoming one of the most famous salvage ships of all time.

The surplus RCN Flowers and were sold as mercantile freighters but were subsequently acquired in 1946 by the &quot;Mossad LeAliyah Bet&quot;, a branch of the Jewish Defense Association (&quot;Haganah&quot;) in the British Mandate for Palestine. &quot;Mossad Le&#x27;aliyah Bet&quot; organized Jewish immigration from Europe into Palestine, in violation of unilateral British restrictions. The corvettes were intercepted in the Mediterranean Sea during the summer of 1946 by the destroyer and interned in Palestine. After Israel became independent in 1948, these commercial ships were commissioned into the Israeli Navy as the warships &quot;Hashomer&quot; and &quot;Hagana&quot; respectively.

Allied navies disposed of their Flowers so quickly following the war, the RN could not supply a single vessel to play &quot;Compass Rose&quot; in the 1953 film production of Nicholas Monsarrat&#x27;s novel &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot;. The Royal Hellenic Navy supplied (formerly ) for the role prior to her scrapping.

The only survivor of the entire class is , owned by the Canadian Naval Memorial Trust. She was laid up in reserve in March 1946 and converted in 1952 to a research vessel for Canadian Department of Marine and Fisheries, a role she served in until the early 1980s when she was acquired by the trust. She has been restored to her wartime appearance and serves in the summer months as a museum ship in Halifax, Nova Scotia, while wintering securely in the naval dockyard at CFB Halifax under the care of Maritime Forces Atlantic, Maritime Command. &quot;Sackville&quot;″s presence in Halifax is considered very appropriate, given the port was an important North American convoy assembly port during the war. &quot;Sackville&quot; makes her first appearance each spring when she is towed by a naval tug from HMC Dockyard to a location off Point Pleasant Park on the first Sunday in May to participate in the &quot;Commemoration of the Battle of the Atlantic&quot; ceremonies held at a memorial in the park overlooking the entrance to Halifax Harbour. &quot;Sackville&quot; typically hosts several dozen RCN veterans on this day and has also participated in several burials at sea for dispersing the ashes of RCN veterans of the Battle of the Atlantic at this location.

<text>Philosophy, politics and economics, or politics, philosophy and economics (PPE), is an interdisciplinary undergraduate or postgraduate degree which combines study from three disciplines. The first institution to offer degrees in PPE was the University of Oxford in the 1920s.
This particular course has produced a significant number of notable graduates such as Aung San Suu Kyi, Burmese politician and former State Counsellor of Myanmar, Nobel Peace Prize winner; Princess Haya bint Hussein, daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan; Christopher Hitchens, the British–American author and journalist; Will Self, British author and journalist; Oscar-winning writer and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck; Michael Dummett, Gareth Evans, Philippa Foot, Christopher Peacocke, Gilbert Ryle, and Peter Strawson, philosophers; Harold Wilson, Edward Heath, David Cameron, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom; Hugh Gaitskell, Michael Foot, William Hague and Ed Miliband, former Leaders of the Opposition; former Prime Ministers of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto and Imran Khan; and Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke and Tony Abbott, former Prime Ministers of Australia. The course received fresh attention in 2017, when Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai earned a place.

In the 1980s, the University of York went on to establish its own PPE degree based upon the Oxford model; King&#x27;s College London, the University of Warwick, the University of Manchester, and other British universities later followed. According to the BBC, the Oxford PPE &quot;dominate[s] public life&quot; (in the UK). It is now offered at several other leading colleges and universities around the world. More recently Warwick University and King&#x27;s College added a new degree under the name of PPL (Politics, Philosophy and Law) with the aim to bring an alternative to the more classical PPE degrees.

In the United States, it is offered by over 50 colleges and universities, including three Ivy League schools and a large number of public universities. Harvard University began offering a similar degree in Social Studies in 1960, which combines politics, philosophy, and economics with history and sociology. In 2020, in addition to its undergraduate degree programs in PPE, Virginia Tech joined the Chapman University&#x27;s Smith Institute as among the first research centers in the world dedicated to interdisciplinary research in PPE. Several PPE programs exist in Canada, most notably the first endowed school in the nation – the Frank McKenna School of Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Mount Allison University. In Asia, Tsinghua University, Waseda University, NUS, Tel-Aviv University and Ashoka University Asian University For Women, Chattogram in Bangladesh are among those that have PPE or similar programs.

== History ==
Philosophy, politics and economics was established as a degree course at the University of Oxford in the 1920s, as a modern alternative to classics (known as &quot;literae humaniores&quot; or &quot;greats&quot; at Oxford) for those entering the civil service. It was thus initially known as &quot;modern greats&quot;. The first PPE students commenced their course in the autumn of 1921. The regulation by which it was established is Statt. Tit. VI. Sect. 1 C; &quot;the subject of the Honour School of Philosophy, Politics, and Economics shall be the study of the structure, and the philosophical and economic principles, of Modern Society.&quot; Initially it was compulsory to study all three subjects for all three years of the course, but in 1970 this requirement was relaxed, and since then students have been able to drop one subject after the first year – most do this, but a minority continue with all three.

During the 1960s some students started to critique the course from a left-wing perspective, culminating in the publication of a pamphlet, &quot;The Poverty of PPE&quot;, in 1968, written by Trevor Pateman, who argued that it &quot;gives no training in scholarship, only refining to a high degree of perfection the ability to write short dilettantish essays on the basis of very little knowledge: ideal training for the social engineer&quot;. The pamphlet advocated incorporating the study of sociology, anthropology and art, and to take on the aim of &quot;assist(ing) the radicalisation and mobilisation of political opinion outside the university&quot;. In response, some minor changes were made, with influential leftist writers such as Frantz Fanon and Régis Debray being added to politics reading lists, but the core of the programme remained the same.

Christopher Stray has pointed to the course as one reason for the gradual decline of the study of classics, as classicists in political life began to be edged out by those who had studied the modern greats.

Political theorists Dario Castiglione and Iain Hampsher-Monk have described the course as being fundamental to the development of political thought in the UK since it established a connection between politics and philosophy. Previously at Oxford, and for some time subsequently at Cambridge, politics had been taught only as a branch of modern history.

== Course material ==
The programme is rooted in the view that to understand social phenomena one must approach them from several complementary disciplinary directions and analytical frameworks. In this regard, the study of philosophy is considered important because it both equips students with meta-tools such as the ability to reason rigorously and logically, and facilitates ethical reflection. The study of politics is considered necessary because it acquaints students with the institutions that govern society and help solve collective action problems. Finally, studying economics is seen as vital in the modern world because political decisions often concern economic matters, and government decisions are often influenced by economic events. The vast majority of students at Oxford drop one of the three subjects for the second and third years of their course. Oxford now has more than 600 undergraduates studying the subject, admitting over 200 each year.

== Academic opinions ==
Oxford PPE graduate Nick Cohen and former tutor Iain McLean consider the course&#x27;s breadth important to its appeal, especially &quot;because British society values generalists over specialists&quot;. Academic and Labour peer Maurice Glasman noted that &quot;PPE combines the status of an elite university degree – PPE is the ultimate form of being good at school – with the stamp of a vocational course. It is perfect training for cabinet membership, and it gives you a view of life&quot;. However, he also noted that it had an orientation towards consensus politics and technocracy.

Geoffrey Evans, an Oxford fellow in politics and a senior tutor, critiques that the Oxford course&#x27;s success and consequent over-demand is a self-perpetuating feature of those in front of and behind the scenes in national administration, in stating &quot;all in all, it&#x27;s how the class system works&quot;. In the current economic system, he bemoans the unavoidable inequalities besetting admissions and thereby enviable recruitment prospects of successful graduates. The argument itself intended as a paternalistic ethical reflection on how governments and peoples can perpetuate social stratification.

Stewart Wood, a former adviser to Ed Miliband who studied PPE at Oxford in the 1980s and taught politics there in the 1990s and 2000s, acknowledged that the programme has been slow to catch up with contemporary political developments, saying that &quot;it does still feel like a course for people who are going to run the Raj in 1936... In the politics part of PPE, you can go three years without discussing a single contemporary public policy issue&quot;. He also stated that the structure of the course gave it a centrist bias, due to the range of material covered: &quot;...most students think, mistakenly, that the only way to do it justice is to take a centre position&quot;.

<text>Barbara Stanisława &quot;Basia&quot; Trzetrzelewska (; born 30 September 1954), better known mononymously as Basia, is a Polish singer-songwriter and recording artist noted for her Latin-inspired jazz-pop music.

She began singing professionally in various Polish bands beginning in the late 1960s and during the 1970s, then moved to the UK in 1981. She rose to fame as a singer in the British trio Matt Bianco. By 1986, Basia and her bandmate Danny White had left the group to focus on her solo career.

She signed with Epic Records and enjoyed a successful international career from 1987 until 1995, particularly in the U.S. where her first two albums &quot;Time and Tide&quot; and &quot;London Warsaw New York&quot; both sold more than a million copies, her biggest hits being &quot;Time and Tide&quot;, &quot;New Day for You&quot;, &quot;Promises&quot;, &quot;Baby You&#x27;re Mine&quot;, &quot;Cruising for Bruising&quot;, and &quot;Drunk on Love&quot;. She also developed a following in Asia.

She took a lengthy hiatus due to personal tragedies. She made a comeback to regular recording and performing beginning with the release of &quot;Matt&#x27;s Mood&quot;, a Matt Bianco album in 2004. She releases her music through independent labels.

== Education and career ==
=== 1954–1984: Early life and career ===
Basia was born in Jaworzno, Poland east of Katowice on 30 September 1954. She had three siblings–two brothers and a sister–and her parents ran a popular ice cream parlor in the town&#x27;s centre. Growing up in a musical household, Basia enjoyed singing from an early age and had an extensive collection of vinyl records. Her mother played piano and gave her first music lessons.

In 1969, Basia performed as a vocalist in a local band, Astry, appearing with them at the National Festival of Beat Avangarde in Kalisz west of Łódź where they won. Always good at exact sciences, Basia had intended to study mathematics at the Jagiellonian University, in Kraków but eventually took up physics. During her first year at university, Alibabki, a popular Polish all-female band asked her to join the group. Basia accepted the offer in 1972, dropped out of university, and toured with them in Poland and abroad, mostly in Eastern Bloc countries, until 1974. In 1976, Basia took part in the National Festival of Polish Song in Opole as a soloist to no success. From 1977 to 1979, she performed in Polish rock band Perfect.

Moving to London with her partner in January 1981, Basia recorded demo tracks for various artists. She met Danny White (brother of jazz guitarist Peter White) there and his collaborator Mark Reilly by answering their ad in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. The trio performed in 1983 as Bronze, but later changed the name to Matt Bianco. Their debut album &quot;Whose Side Are You On?&quot; was released in 1984 and turned out to be a hit in Europe. It spawned Matt Bianco&#x27;s UK Top 40 singles &quot;Get Out of Your Lazy Bed&quot; and &quot;Half a Minute&quot;.

=== 1985–1999: Solo career ===
Despite the success, Basia and Danny White left Matt Bianco in 1985 to focus on Basia&#x27;s solo career, marking the beginning of a long-term collaboration. Their first release was the single &quot;Prime Time TV&quot; in 1986, a minor success in the UK and Germany. Basia&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Time and Tide&quot;, was released in 1987, selling well in France but performing poorly in the rest of Europe. Accompanying singles &quot;New Day for You&quot; and &quot;Promises&quot; were also only modest successes. The album fared much better in the US where it found popularity on smooth jazz radio stations. The song &quot;Time and Tide&quot; was Basia&#x27;s first hit on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at No. 26 in 1988, followed by &quot;New Day for You&quot; and &quot;Promises&quot;, both reaching the top 10 on the Adult Contemporary chart in 1989. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in November 1989 selling one million copies in the US alone. Worldwide, it sold almost two million copies.

The second album, &quot;London Warsaw New York&quot;, recorded in 1989 and released in early 1990, was promoted by the popular singles &quot;Baby You&#x27;re Mine&quot; and &quot;Cruising for Bruising&quot;. The latter peaked in the top 40 on both US and Canadian singles chart. The album also included the cover of Stevie Wonder-penned track &quot;Until You Come Back to Me&quot;, a minor hit on the Adult Contemporary chart. &quot;London Warsaw New York&quot; was another commercial success, selling in over two million units worldwide including more than one million in the US, earning Basia her second American platinum certification. It also became &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Contemporary Jazz Album of 1990. The album was a strong seller in Japan which at that point had become Basia&#x27;s number two market. The LP was supported by an extensive tour spanning the US, Europe, and Japan. Seeing Basia&#x27;s success, her label released &quot;Brave New Hope&quot;, a compilation consisting of remixes and rare tracks. Her third studio album, &quot;The Sweetest Illusion&quot;, was released in spring 1994. Mixed by David Bascombe, the project marked the end of a ten-year working relationship with mixmaster Phil Harding. &quot;The Sweetest Illusion&quot; included a number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart, &quot;Drunk on Love&quot;, and the moderately successful song &quot;Third Time Lucky&quot;. Although less successful than Basia&#x27;s two previous albums, it reached the top 40 on the US charts and received gold certification from the RIAA for selling over half a million copies. In Japan it peaked in the top 10, receiving a platinum sales award, her greatest achievement there. To support &quot;The Sweetest Illusion&quot;, Basia again embarked on a long tour in the US, Japan and Europe. On the tour, she played her first ever solo concerts in Poland. She recorded a 16-song live album, &quot;Basia on Broadway&quot; during the New York City leg of that tour.

In 1996, Basia contributed vocals to Peter White&#x27;s song &quot;Just Another Day&quot; which was released as a single from his album &quot;Caravan of Dreams&quot;. A retrospective compilation album, &quot;Clear Horizon – The Best of Basia&quot;, came out in 1998 consisting of notable chart hits, non-single tracks, and new material including a cover of &quot;Waters of March&quot;, written by Brazilian composer Antônio Carlos Jobim. The compilation was Basia&#x27;s last release for Sony and was a minor success only in Japan, largely due to lack of promotion from the label.

=== 2000–present: Hiatus and comeback ===
Basia withdrew from the music industry when her mother, to whom she was very close, died in December 2000. Not long after that, her cousin died in a car accident and that was followed by the passing of other close friends. The singer struggled with depression, lost motivation to work, and thought she would never return to singing. After some persistent efforts from Danny White and Mark Reilly, who had started working together again, she agreed to join a re-formed Matt Bianco. The band released the album &quot;Matt&#x27;s Mood&quot; in 2004 to critical acclaim and modest chart success. The positive response to Matt Bianco&#x27;s reunion and pleas from her fans encouraged Basia to work on her next solo album. Having finished touring with the band in 2006, Basia and White began working on the new material together while Reilly performed with Matt Bianco.

Her fourth solo studio album, &quot;It&#x27;s That Girl Again&quot;, was finally released in spring 2009 by independent label Koch Records. It was promoted by the ballad &quot;A Gift&quot; on the Polish radio while &quot;Blame It on the Summer&quot; served as the lead single on the American market. The album met with critical as well as commercial success, placing in the top 10 of the US Jazz Albums chart and the top 5 in her native Poland where it was certified platinum. Basia toured extensively in Europe, east Asia, and North America to promote &quot;It&#x27;s That Girl Again&quot;. A 2011 concert in Łódź, Poland northwest of Wrocław, was recorded for her second live album, &quot;From Newport to London: Greatest Hits Live... and More&quot;, released in fall 2011. The album featured three studio recordings including the title song, released as the lead single, and &quot;Wandering&quot;, a duet with Polish singer Mietek Szcześniak. They recorded one more song together, a cover of Vanessa Williams&#x27; hit &quot;Save the Best for Last&quot;, produced by its original co-writer Wendy Waldman, this time for Szcześniak&#x27;s album &quot;Signs&quot;. In March 2013, Basia performed a full show at the Java Jazz Festival in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Basia recorded duets with Polish artists Monika Lidke and the band Pectus for their respective albums, simultaneously working on the new solo album. In 2014, she was given the Commander&#x27;s Cross of Polonia Restituta for promoting Polish culture worldwide and n 2015, she received the Medal for Merit to Culture – Gloria Artis. Her fifth solo studio album, &quot;Butterflies&quot;, was released in May 2018, preceded by the single &quot;Matteo&quot;. It received positive reviews and charted in the top 5 on the Jazz Albums chart in the US, and the top 20 in Poland. The accompanying concert tour spanned the US, Poland and East Asia. In November 2019, Basia was honored with the Kosciuszko Foundation Pioneer Award. In 2021, she was featured on the single &quot;Fire &amp; Ice&quot; by The Clarisse Sisters.

== Influences and artistry ==
Basia&#x27;s success has derived primarily from eclecticism rather than originality. Her biggest influence has always been American music, particularly soul and jazz. Her songs are also inspired by Latin American music, especially Brazilian, and genres including bossa nova and samba. She has cited Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Burt Bacharach, Astrud Gilberto, and Antônio Carlos Jobim as being among her musical influences.

Basia is noted for having a wide vocal range of approximately three octaves. She has always tried to incorporate Polish elements into her songs which are otherwise English. Her native language can be heard in &quot;Copernicus&quot; and &quot;Reward&quot; from &quot;London Warsaw New York&quot;; in the album &quot;Matt&#x27;s Mood&quot;; as well as in &quot;An Olive Tree&quot; and &quot;Yearning&quot; from &quot;The Sweetest Illusion&quot;. She has also released two songs performed entirely in Polish: the concert album &quot;Basia on Broadway&quot; features a live recording of &quot;Dzień się budzi&quot; (English: &quot;The Day Is Dawning&quot;), and &quot;It&#x27;s That Girl Again&quot; has &quot;Amelki śmiech&quot; (&quot;Amelka&#x27;s Laughter&quot;).

== Personal life ==
Basia has one son, Mikołaj, born in the late 1970s. At the time, her partner was John, a social worker from England living in Chicago. They then went to the UK. In the second half of the 1980s, she and her musical collaborator Danny White dated. Since 1991, Basia&#x27;s partner has been musician Kevin Robinson, a member of Simply Red, with whom she lives in a London suburb. Basia also maintains a house in her Polish hometown Jaworzno and divides her time between the two countries. She holds dual Polish and British citizenship.

Basia is an avid lover of architecture which she calls her &quot;unfulfilled passion&quot;.

One of Braff&#x27;s earliest roles was in &quot;High&quot;, a proposed 1989 CBS television series with a cast that also included Gwyneth Paltrow and Craig Ferguson; the television pilot never made it on air. Braff appeared in the 1990s series &quot;The Baby-sitters Club&quot;, in the episode &quot;Dawn Saves the Trees&quot;. He appeared in Woody Allen&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;Manhattan Murder Mystery&quot;. In 1998, Braff had a part in a George C. Wolfe production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; for New York City&#x27;s Public Theater.

Braff played &quot;J.D.&quot; (short for the character&#x27;s full name, John Dorian) on the medical comedy television series &quot;Scrubs&quot;, which debuted in 2001. The role was Braff&#x27;s first major role in a television show. Braff was nominated for three Golden Globes and an Emmy for his work on the show. Braff directed several episodes of &quot;Scrubs&quot;, including the 100th episode, &quot;My Way Home&quot;. For the show&#x27;s ninth season Braff was a cast member for six episodes and also served as one of the executive producers.

===Filmmaking===
Braff starred in &quot;Garden State&quot;, also directing and producing it. The film was filmed in his home state of New Jersey. Producers were initially reluctant to finance the film; Braff wrote it in six months. At the 2005 Grammy Awards, his &quot;mixtape&quot; won a Grammy for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media for the &quot;Garden State&quot; soundtrack.

On April 24, 2013, Braff started a Kickstarter campaign to finance the film &quot;Wish I Was Here&quot;, based on a script he wrote with his brother Adam. The $2 million goal was reached in three days. He directed and starred in the film which was released in 2014.

Braff was the executive producer of the documentary &quot;Video Games: The Movie&quot;. He was also one of the executive producers of &quot;The Internet&#x27;s Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz&quot;, released in 2014. He has directed several music videos: Gavin DeGraw&#x27;s &quot;Chariot&quot;, Joshua Radin&#x27;s &quot;Closer&quot;, Radin&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be With You&quot;, and Lazlo Bane&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; which is the theme song from &quot;Scrubs&quot;. His music production led to newfound success for some of the artists featured on his film soundtracks including The Shins, who were prominently featured on the &quot;Garden State&quot; and &quot;Scrubs&quot; soundtracks, resulting in the expression &quot;the Zach Braff effect&quot;.

In 2020, Braff directed the short film &quot;In The Time It Takes To Get There&quot;, starring Alicia Silverstone and Florence Pugh. The film was based on a poster created by Sam West, the winner of an Adobe contest in 2018. In 2021, Braff was nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award for directing the Apple TV+ comedy show &quot;Ted Lasso&quot;. He also received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for the &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; episode &quot;Biscuits&quot;.

Braff wrote, directed, and produced the drama film &quot;A Good Person&quot; starring Morgan Freeman and Florence Pugh, it was released on March 24, 2023.

====In development====

Braff was expected to direct &quot;Open Hearts&quot;, a remake of the 2002 Danish film &quot;Elsker dig for evigt&quot; (&quot;Love You Forever&quot;). The film is about a woman who has an affair with her paralyzed husband&#x27;s doctor, whose wife caused the accident that put her husband in a wheelchair. It was first revealed that Braff was directing &quot;Open Hearts&quot; in 2006, however, the film was eventually canceled. Braff said &quot;It fell apart at the last second due to scheduling and budget, as so many movies do.&quot; At the same time, Braff&#x27;s film &quot;The Last Kiss&quot; was being released.

In 2009, Braff was working on the script for &quot;Swingles&quot;, a film based on a spec script by Duncan Birmingham; he would direct and star in the film alongside Cameron Diaz. As of 2021, no further public announcements about the film&#x27;s development status has been released.

===Other roles===
Along with other &quot;Scrubs&quot; cast members, Braff has a cameo role in &quot;It&#x27;s a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie&quot;.

He also voiced the titular character in the Disney animated film &quot;Chicken Little&quot; (2005), and has reprised the role in various Disney video games such as &quot;Chicken Little&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, &quot;Chicken Little: Ace in Action&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts 2.5 HD ReMIX&quot;. Braff has also done voiceovers for commercials, including a PUR water campaign, Wendy&#x27;s in 2007 and 2008, and in Cottonelle as the voice of the puppy. He also provided the voice of Finley in the Disney film &quot;Oz The Great and Powerful&quot; (2013). In 2005, Braff was featured on &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; when he was tricked into chasing and then beating a supposed vandal who appeared to be spray-painting his brand new Porsche.

Braff was in talks to star in the film &quot;Fletch Won&quot; and had signed on to play the role eventually played by Dane Cook in &quot;Mr. Brooks&quot;, but dropped out of both roles to work on &quot;Open Hearts&quot;, which he adapted from a Danish film and will direct. He has also co-written a film version of &quot;Andrew Henry&#x27;s Meadow&quot;, a children&#x27;s book, with his brother, and was scheduled to direct one of the segments for the film &quot;New York, I Love You&quot;.

In July 2009, he signed on as an executive producer of the documentary &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; to &quot;help spread the word about it.&quot;

Braff starred in the romantic drama &quot;The Last Kiss&quot;, which opened on September 15, 2006. Braff tweaked several parts of Paul Haggis&#x27; script for the film, as he wanted the script to be as &quot;real as possible&quot; and &quot;really courageous&quot; regarding its subject matter. As with &quot;Garden State&quot;, Braff was involved with the film&#x27;s soundtrack, serving as executive producer. The film&#x27;s director, Tony Goldwyn, compared Braff to a younger version of Tim Allen, describing Braff as &quot;incredibly accessible to an audience... a real guy, an everyman.&quot;

In 2007, Braff starred in the film &quot;The Ex&quot; (2007). He also starred in the Canadian indie film &quot;The High Cost of Living&quot; with Québécois actress Isabelle Blais in 2010. Directed by Deborah Chow, the film was shot in Montreal and principal photography wrapped on March 9, 2010. Braff stated he enjoyed filming in the country in which &quot;The Last Kiss&quot; was also shot. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was also shown at the Tribeca Film Festival.

Braff played the lead role of Alex in &quot;Alex, Inc.&quot;, a television comedy based on a family man who quit his radio career to launch a podcasting company. ABC cancelled the show after one season.

===Theater===
Braff returned to the Public Theater in 2002, in a part in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, staged in Central Park. In mid-2010, Braff took a lead role in &quot;Trust&quot;, at the Second Stage Theatre, a contemporary Off-Broadway theater company. The play ran from July 23 to September 12, extending its scheduled run by one week. Braff wrote on Facebook that he was &quot;Having so much fun doing &quot;Trust&quot;.&quot; The play co-starred Sutton Foster, Ari Graynor, and Bobby Cannavale, was written by Paul Weitz and directed by Peter DuBois. Braff played Henry, a wealthy married man who &quot;looks to find something real in the most unlikely of places.&quot;

In early 2011, Braff announced that he had written a play to be performed at the Second Stage Theatre in mid-2011. His play, &quot;All New People&quot;, is set on Long Beach Island and centers on Charlie, a 35-year-old from Braff&#x27;s home state New Jersey. The play was directed by Peter DuBois, who directed Braff in &quot;Trust&quot; the previous year. When announcing the play on Facebook, Braff wrote that &#x27;one of my dreams comes true&#x27;. In 2012, Braff moved the play on tour to the UK, playing in Manchester at the Manchester Opera House between February 8–11, Glasgow at the King&#x27;s Theatre between February 14–18, and finally in London for 10 weeks at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre from February 22.

On April 10, 2014, Braff opened on Broadway in the musical &quot;Bullets Over Broadway The Musical&quot;, an adaptation of Woody Allen&#x27;s 1994 film, directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman.

===Other pursuits===
In 2009, Braff opened the Mermaid Oyster Bar in New York City with chef and high school friend Laurence Edelman, as well as Danny Abrams.

Proprietors of the Rio Theater in Monte Rio, California credited Braff with making the donation that put their Kickstarter campaign over the target to buy a digital projector over its $60,000 goal in May 2013.

In March 2020, Braff and &quot;Scrubs&quot; co-star Donald Faison launched a &quot;Scrubs&quot; rewatch podcast titled &quot;Fake Doctors, Real Friends&quot;. Distributed by iHeartRadio, the duo also shares stories and experiences of their time on set. Guests on the podcast include their co-stars Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, Neil Flynn, John C. McGinley, Christa Miller, and Ken Jenkins as well as the show&#x27;s creator, Bill Lawrence and director Michael Spiller.

==Personal life==
Braff has previously dated actress Mandy Moore, from 2004 to 2006. He has also had relationships with model Taylor Bagley, from 2009 to 2014 and actress Florence Pugh, which generated controversy due to their 20-year age gap, from 2019 to 2022. He directed her in his 2019 short film &quot;In the Time it Takes to Get There&quot; and the drama film &quot;A Good Person&quot;.

In November 2008, Braff earned his pilot&#x27;s license flying a Cirrus SR20.

<doc id="730486" wikidata="Q1801144" url="?curid=730486" title="Lakeshore, Ontario">
<text>Lakeshore is a municipality on Lake St. Clair, in Essex County, Ontario, Canada. It was incorporated in 1999 by amalgamating the Town of Belle River with the townships of Maidstone, Rochester, Tilbury North, and Tilbury West. It is the largest and the most populous municipality within Essex County. However, it is part of the Windsor census metropolitan area.

Lakeshore has a significant concentration of French Canadians and is one of only four communities in Southern Ontario (excluding Eastern Ontario) in which more than 5% (the provincial average) of the population is francophone. The others are Welland, Pain Court, and Penetanguishene. In the 2011 census, 7.7% of the population reported French as their mother tongue, and 17.2% reported knowledge of both official languages. Lakeshore also has a historic black community, along the Puce River, made up of descendants of refugee slaves from the South in the United States who immigrated to Canada for freedom, using the Underground Railroad network.

==Communities==
The Municipality of Lakeshore comprises the communities of Belle River, Comber, Deerbrook, Elmstead, Emeryville, Haycroft, Lighthouse Cove, North Woodslee, Pike Creek, Pleasant Park, Puce, Ruscom Station, South Woodslee, St. Joachim, Stoney Point, and Strangfield, as well as the far eastern section of Tecumseh.

A small portion of the township&#x27;s easternmost area is considered by some to be part of Tilbury, although Tilbury proper is located in the neighbouring municipality of Chatham-Kent.

==Geography==
Although incorporated as a town, the vast majority of Lakeshore is rural, being made up of cleared farmland predominantly used for the cultivation of cash crops such as soybeans and winter wheat. The Comber Wind Farm is also located here.

As in the rest of Essex County and Chatham-Kent, the terrain is extremely flat and regular. The terrain slopes very gently from the southern border of Lakeshore on Highway 8, with an average elevation of , to the shore of Lake St. Clair at . The highest land is in the southwestern corner of the town, near the town of Essex, at an elevation of .

The area is drained by a series of slow-moving rivers and creeks, all of which flow northward into Lake St. Clair: from west to east, these are Pike Creek, the Puce River, Belle River, the Ruscom River, and finally Big Creek and Baptiste Creek, which form the northeastern border of Lakeshore at their junction with the Thames River.

The major transportation arteries through Lakeshore, including Highway 401, the Tecumseh Road, and County Roads 22, 42 and 46, all follow an east–west parallel toward Windsor and Detroit in the west and toward Chatham-Kent in the east. The only significant exception is Highway 77, which connects Leamington to Highway 401 via Staples.

==History==
Areas along Lake St. Clair and the Puce, Belle, and Ruscom rivers were originally occupied by the Huron and Wyandot First Nations. Some French colonists associated with Fort Detroit and the fur trade settled in this area in the 18th century. Their descendants are known as Fort Detroit French. They also came from Sandwich, where colonists had developed farms at what was known as Petite Côte, a bend in the Detroit River.

The coast of Lake St. Clair and lots fronting the Puce, Belle, and Ruscom rivers were first surveyed in 1793 by Patrick McKniff. The area was not fully divided into concessions and lots, however, until the rear lines of the townships and the Middle Road (today County Road 46) were surveyed by Mahlon Burwell in 1823. Land speculation was endemic in Essex County at that time, as in many other parts of Upper Canada. Much of the present town of Lakeshore was once owned by a single speculator, the fur trader John Askin: by 1797, he held 80 lots, concentrated primarily along the Pêche (Pike) Puce, Belle, and Ruscom rivers.

From the 1840s, the town received numerous Irish immigrants, fleeing the Great Famine. Later additional waves of French Canadians migrated from Quebec. Development was slow until the construction of a series of railroads through the area. These include the Great Western Railway, opened in 1854 and passing through Belle River, and the Canada Southern Railway (later owned by New York Central and Michigan Central), opened in 1872 and passing through Comber. These stimulated the settlement by new migrants from the East.

Following the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 that abolished slavery in most of the British Empire, the Lakeshore region became one of several end points of the Underground Railroad, an informal network running from the South of the United States to help refugee slaves gain freedom. In 1851, the Refugee Home Society was founded in Detroit by Michigan and Ontario abolitionists. Under the direction of Henry Walton Bibb, the society purchased scattered lots in and around Maidstone, Puce, and Belle River to resettle refugee blacks. Although Michigan was a free state, slavecatchers operated in Detroit to capture refugees for the high bounties offered under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.

The two oldest communities in Lakeshore are Comber and Belle River. Samuel Taylor II, who developed and owned half the land west of main street, had part of his land laid out into village lots. This includes property that was donated to build two schools and two churches. It is due to his many contributions in the area that Taylor Avenue in Comber still exists today. Other landowners, including John Gracey and William MacDowell, two Scotch-Irish Presbyterians from Comber, Ireland followed suit. It was named after their home town in 1848 or 1850 when it was erected as a Police village.

Belle River, named for the river where it developed, was incorporated as a village on November 26, 1874, but its origins can be traced to the Jesuit Mission of St. Jude. The mission was founded in 1834 to serve the religious needs of the local population of French Catholics. The mission did not receive a resident pastor until 1857, after the Great Western Railway opened the area to large-scale immigration. Over the course of the 1870s, the town&#x27;s population was tripled by an influx of settlers from the province of Quebec, sometimes referred to as Canadian French, in contrast to the Fort Detroit French. The earliest industries in the town were operated by Luc and Denis Ouellette, who established a sawmill and gristmill on opposite sides of the river.

In 1881, the population of Comber was 250 and that of Belle River was 650.

Stoney Point () was settled by 1851 and incorporated as a village in 1881, at which time it had a population of 375. The church of St. Joachim, which became the centre of the village of the same name, was completed in 1882 and enlarged in 1891. It was established to serve the needs of French Catholics in the area along the Ruscom River, who were distant from the existing parishes in Belle River and Stoney Point.

Belle River was well known for bootlegging during Prohibition in the United States. The Wellington hotel, once located on Notre Dame, the town&#x27;s main street, exported alcohol to the United States. Owners and residents of many American-owned cottages on Charron Beach Road also participated in bootlegging liquor.

In the 1920s, James Scott Cooper, a well-known local entrepreneur and bootlegger, built mansions from his profits in Walkerville and Belle River. The Cooper Court Motel and Bar in Belle River, built in 1920, still operates today. Cooper was a philanthropist and contributed greatly to the construction of Belle River&#x27;s first high school in 1922, St. James High School; it was named informally to honour Cooper&#x27;s generosity. The building still stands today, housing the local Canadian Legion on Notre Dame Street.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Lakeshore had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Economy==
Lakeshore&#x27;s economy is based primarily on agriculture and manufacturing. Over 27% of the workforce is employed in the manufacturing sector. The prominence of manufacturing is an outgrowth of the town&#x27;s proximity to Windsor and Detroit, the historic centre of North American automobile production. The economy of Lakeshore remains closely tied to that of Windsor: more than 50% of the town&#x27;s total workforce is employed in Windsor.

In recent years, important developments in renewable energy, particularly in wind power, have taken place in the town. It is the site of the 72-turbine Comber Wind Farm.

==Sports==

The community&#x27;s hockey team is the two-time defending Stobbs Division Champions Lakeshore Canadiens, who play in the Provincial Junior Hockey League.

The youth sports teams are Belle River Jr. Canadiens (Hockey), Lakeshore Lightning (Girls Hockey), Belle River Braves (Baseball) and Belle River F.C. (Soccer).

Belle River is the birthplace of retired NHL player Tie Domi, and NHL player Aaron Ekblad was raised in Belle River.

NFL and CFL offensive lineman Drew Desjarlais was born and raised in Belle River. In 2023 the Ottawa Redblacks obtained Desjarlais from the NFL by making him the league’s highest-paid offensive lineman. 

Since 1989, Belle River has been known as the &quot;Jet Ski Capital of Canada&quot; due to the numerous personal watercraft riders and racers in the town, many of whom are American visitors. In the past, the community&#x27;s racing team was named after the URL: www.belleriverbia.com. To this day there continues to be an annual event hosted by The CAN AM Watercross Tour in honour of the sport in conjunction with the town&#x27;s annual Sunsplash Festival.

The Atlas Tube Recreation Centre opened in Lakeshore in September 2014, home to three ice rinks, an indoor walking track, gymnasium, library, and community program rooms. In 2017, the aquatics centre was opened, adding a 25-metre lap pool, a leisure pool, and a spa tub. Outside of the enclosed 200,000 square foot facility, there is a 5-kilometre walking trail, splash pad and soccer fields.

<text>The Pink Cliffs are a series of highly dissected cliffs on the Colorado Plateau in Garfield, Iron, and Kane counties in southwestern Utah, United States. Contrary to the implication of the name, the cliffs are not a single set of rock formations, but actually a geological formation that manifests itself in multiple sets of rock formations.

==Description==
The cliffs form a large number of unique rock formations, many of which are protected by either the Bryce Canyon National Park or the Cedar Breaks National Monument. Most of the other formations are located within the Dixie National Forest. Geologically the cliffs are pink- and red-colored Claron Formation limestones, forming the upper riser of the Grand Staircase (which descends southward to the Grand Canyon in Arizona). The Pink Cliffs, as well as the other layers of the Grand Staircase, were named by geologist Clarence Dutton in the 1870s.

While it is not an uncommon belief that the extent of the Pink Cliff is limited to the Bryce Canyon National Park area (being one of the best and most popular areas to view the cliffs), geographically, the cliffs actually extend well beyond the national park, forming a rough, but wide, &quot;U&quot; shape that spans three counties. The westernmost part of the cliffs are located on the western edge of the Markagunt Plateau (mostly within Cedar Breaks National Monument) in southeastern Iron County and the easternmost part of the cliffs are located on the southeastern edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau in southwestern Garfield County (mostly within Bryce Canyon National Park). From the national monument on the west, the cliffs wrap south around the southern edge of the Markagunt Plateau (roughly along the border of the Dixie National Forest) and run just south of Navajo Lake in northeastern Kane County. After being bisected by the Long Valley and the valley of Kanab Creek, the cliffs wrap around the southern and southeastern edges of the Paunsaugunt Plateau and extend north through and just beyond the national park.

<doc id="730510" wikidata="Q2363314" url="?curid=730510" title="WWE Heat">
<text>WWE Heat (formerly known as Sunday Night Heat and also known as Heat) is an American professional wrestling television program that was produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and aired from August 2, 1998 to May 30, 2008. Originally produced under the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) banner, it aired on USA Network (1998–2000), MTV (2000–2003), and TNN/Spike TV (2003–2005) in the United States, CTV Sportsnet in Canada, and Channel 4, Sky1, and Sky Sports in the United Kingdom. From 2002, due to the WWE brand extension, &quot;Heat&quot; served as a supplementary show to the Raw brand, focusing more exclusively on its mid-card performers and matches, and was recorded before the week&#x27;s television taping of &quot;Raw&quot;.

&quot;Heat&quot; was most recently streamed on WWE.com on Friday afternoons for North American viewers from 2005 to 2008. However, the show was still televised internationally and showed in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 and then later on Sky Sports 3, Australia on Fox8, India on TEN Sports, Germany on Premiere Sport Portal, France on Action, Spain on Sportmania and C+ Deportes -both channels from Digital+, the Middle East on ShowSports4, the Philippines on Jack TV, and Japan on J Sports. The final episode was uploaded to WWE.com. The show was replaced internationally with &quot;WWE Vintage Collection&quot;, a program featuring classic matches.

On May 7, 2018, the first 52 episodes of &quot;WWE Heat&quot; were made available to stream on the WWE Network.

==History==

===Early format===

The show was originally introduced on the USA Network on August 2, 1998 in the United States. The one-hour show would be broadcast on Sunday nights, being taped earlier in the week after Raw. It was the second primary program of the WWF&#x27;s weekly television show line-up, serving as a supplement to the &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; program. &quot;Heat&quot; would feature a format similar to that of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, in that continuing feuds from the previous week would progress during the show, and the following day&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; would be heavily promoted. On scheduled WWF pay-per-view event nights, &quot;Heat&quot; would also serve as a preview show to the events. The show was initially signed for only 6 episodes, but proved to be very popular and was continued.

===1999–2002===

With the premiere of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in August 1999, coverage of &quot;Heat&quot; was significantly reduced in favor of the newer show. The debut of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; also led to &quot;Heat&quot; being taped before &quot;SmackDown!&quot; with matches for WWF syndication programs like &quot;Jakked/Metal&quot; being taped before &quot;Raw&quot; broadcasts. When &quot;SmackDown!&quot; premiered, &quot;Heat&quot; briefly became a complete weekly summary show, featuring occasional interviews and music videos. After only a few weeks following the format change, &quot;Heat&quot; began airing exclusive matches again.

Occasionally, special editions of the show aired heavily promoted. For Super Bowl XXXIII in 1999, &quot;Heat&quot; aired as &quot;Halftime Heat&quot; on the USA Network during halftime of the Super Bowl. These specials ended following the show&#x27;s move to MTV in 2000. When the show started airing on MTV in late 2000, it was broadcast live from WWF New York. WWF personalities and performers would appear at the restaurant as special guests while Michael Cole and Tazz provided commentary to matches.

====United Kingdom (2000–2001)====
The United Kingdom&#x27;s coverage Heat began in January 2000, when Channel 4 started broadcasting the show at 4pm on Sundays, as a part of T4 – which also included broadcasting four WWF PPVs a year. These one-hour shows were a magazine-type show, usually featuring three or four brief matches as well as highlights from &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. As with the North American airing, exclusive matches taped before &quot;SmackDown!&quot; were aired on this version of the show.

A separate commentary team was used on airings in the United Kingdom, with references aimed more at that specific audience. During commentary, &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown!&quot; were referred to as taking place on Friday and Saturday respectively, which were the days they were broadcast in the United Kingdom on Sky Sports – as opposed to the manner in which the two programs were often referred to by the North American broadcast dates of Monday and Thursday. The two-person announce team was a mix of individuals including Kevin Kelly, Michael Cole, Michael Hayes and Jonathan Coachman. During the middle of 2000, &quot;Heat&quot; started to get moved around the Channel 4 schedule, usually between the afternoon and midnight. Towards the end of 2000, the show was permanently moved to being broadcast in the early-hours of Monday mornings. The show stayed in the time-slot until December 2001 when Channel 4&#x27;s deal with the WWF expired in the United Kingdom.

===2002–2005===
In April 2002, the show returned to its original filming schedule, again before &quot;Raw&quot;. Eventually, the live from WWF New York format was retired, and was replaced as being the Raw brand&#x27;s second show. Ratings were still moderate for &quot;Heat&quot;, although the show lost some popularity once &quot;SmackDown!&quot; began to air. This version also featured highlights from that week&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot;, and the name change was introduced to the show in May 2002, when it became known as &quot;WWE Sunday Night Heat&quot; (the May 5, 2002 episode, along with the Insurrextion United Kingdom-exclusive pay-per-view held the same day, were the last broadcasts of any kind under the WWF name). &quot;Heat&quot; returned to the United Kingdom and Ireland in January 2003 on Sky One (with repeats on Sky Sports), though the coverage became Sky Sports exclusive in January 2005 along with most of WWE&#x27;s programming. In the United States, &quot;Heat&quot; stayed with MTV until March 2003 when it was transferred over to The New TNN (later rebranded to Spike TV). It stayed in that timeslot until the contract with Viacom expired.

===2005–2008===

&quot;Heat&quot; and &quot;Velocity&quot; were not picked up by the USA Network when WWE moved its programming over to that network in October 2005, leaving Americans no way to watch WWE weekend shows on television. To solve this problem, WWE decided to stream the shows on their website exclusively for the U.S. audience, with new editions posted every Friday afternoon. Additionally, prior to every PPV event, WWE would continue to air a live bonus 30-minute &quot;Heat&quot; pre-show on the PPV channel. Backlash 2006 would be the final PPV event to feature a live &quot;Heat&quot; pre-show before that particular version of &quot;Heat&quot; was discontinued. &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; was soon renamed to &quot;WWE Heat&quot;, as it no longer aired on Sundays.

&quot;Heat&quot; was still shown internationally to fulfill international programming commitments. When WWE went high definition in January 2008, &quot;Heat&quot; began using the same HD set as &quot;Raw&quot;, &quot;SmackDown&quot;, and &quot;ECW&quot;. After 10 years of programming and 513 episodes, the final episode of &quot;WWE Heat&quot; was uploaded to WWE.com on May 30, 2008. It was the most watched episode of &quot;Heat&quot; since it debuted on WWE.com. The show was replaced internationally with a new show featuring classic matches, called &quot;WWE Vintage Collection&quot;.

===Legacy===
At the 2019 Royal Rumble it was announced that WWE would be bringing back &quot;Halftime Heat&quot; featuring superstars from NXT during the Super Bowl LIII halftime show.

==Pre-show episodes==
Starting with SummerSlam 1998 and ending with Backlash 2006, Heat aired special live episodes as the pre-show or countdown to several WWE pay-per-views.

==Notable championship matches==
Though the majority of title changes would take place on &quot;Raw&quot;, &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, or pay-per-view events, the WWF Championship changed hands on a special &quot;Halftime Heat&quot; that aired during the half-time of Super Bowl XXXIII on January 31, 1999 when Mankind defeated The Rock in an empty arena match to win the title. This special episode received the highest rating of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; with a rating of 6.6.

Additionally, the Light Heavyweight Championship changed hands on &quot;Heat&quot; on three occasions. The first took place on the February 13, 2000 airing when Essa Rios (in his first appearance under that name and with the debuting Lita) defeated Gillberg. The second change saw Crash Holly defeat Dean Malenko on the March 18, 2001 episode. In the final change, the debuting Jerry Lynn defeated Crash Holly on a live edition before the Backlash pay-per-view on April 29, 2001.

==Commentators and hosts==

There have been many commentators in the history of &quot;Heat&quot;. Industry veterans and &quot;Raw&quot; broadcasters Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler have done commentary on the show. The show was also the launchpad for Shane McMahon&#x27;s on-camera career in WWE, originally placed in the role of a commentator for the program. In October 2000, the show was hosted by Rebecca Budig and MTV VJ/Rapper DJ Skribble when it moved from USA Network to MTV.

Often wrestlers would take the role of color commentators on the show with Al Snow, Tommy Dreamer, Raven, and D&#x27;Lo Brown all holding this position mostly as a replacement for an announcer who was unavailable. During the show&#x27;s run on MTV, Diva Lita also served as a commentator following her major neck injury.

Before the WWE-produced Extreme Championship Wrestling reunion pay-per-view One Night Stand 2005 took place, a special &quot;Extreme Heat&quot; episode was broadcast and hosted by Jonathan Coachman and Michael Cole.

During one episode when Jonathan Coachman was unavailable, former ECW announcer (and then-lead &quot;Raw&quot; announcer) Joey Styles took part in the show. Styles then quit in storyline, however, on the following Monday&#x27;s&#x27; &quot;Raw&quot;, meaning Grisham ran the show alone.

<text>John Leavitt Stevens (August 1, 1820 – February 8, 1895) was the United States Minister to the Hawaiian Kingdom in 1893 when he conspired to overthrow Queen Liliuokalani in association with the Committee of Safety, led by Lorrin A. Thurston and Sanford B. Dole – the first Americans attempting to overthrow a foreign government under the auspices of a United States government officer. Apart from his work as a politician and diplomat, he was also a journalist, author, minister and newspaper publisher. He founded the Republican Party in Maine and served as Maine State Senator.

==Early life==

John Leavitt Stevens was born in 1820 in the town of Mount Vernon, Kennebec County, Maine, to Capt. John Stevens and Charlotte (Lyford) Stevens. He was a lifelong resident of Augusta in the same county, except for his time away at school and his later diplomatic service. Stevens attended Maine Wesleyan Seminary to prepare for a minister&#x27;s career in the Universalist church, which he served as pastor for a decade, becoming a leader in the anti-slavery movement. (Stevens later became a firm opponent of capital punishment, and as a Maine State Senator urged the legislature to abolish the death penalty).

After a decade as an activist Universalist minister, Stevens was persuaded by his lifelong friend Maine Governor Anson P. Morrill to give up the pulpit and become a newspaper publisher and politician. Stevens took his friend Morrill&#x27;s advice, left the ministry and became a newspaper editor and publisher before becoming a Maine delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention.

Six years prior, in 1854, Stevens and his partner James G. Blaine had purchased the newspaper &quot;The Kennebec Journal&quot; in Augusta, where the pair collaborated for 14 years on editing their publication and pushing the development of Maine&#x27;s Republican Party. Stevens also played a large role in the 1876 Presidential campaign when he served as Chairman of the Republican State Committee of Maine. He stumped in the states of Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania for the Republican Presidential ticket that year, which won him an appointment as a minister representing the United States government.

==Diplomatic career==

Stevens joined the United States Department of State and was appointed successively minister to Paraguay, Uruguay, Sweden and Norway, and finally to Hawaii, an appointment pushed by his old partner Blaine, who had risen to United States Secretary of State. When Stevens was named to the Hawaiian post, his title was changed to Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary, indicating his rise within the State Department.

Soon after his installation in Hawaii, Stevens began writing about the islands, in a steady stream of pamphlets and speeches, including his December 19, 1891, speech delivered at Founder&#x27;s Day celebrations of the Kamehameha School, entitled &quot;Advice to Young Hawaiians&quot;, and his later &quot;The Hawaiian Situation&quot; tract, written with Eugene Chamberlain and William Springer.

Envoy Stevens had gone on-the-record about his Manifest Destiny views concerning close allies of the United States. Presumably his views reflected those of his former partner, friend, sponsor and now boss at the State Department. In 1881, James G. Blaine had written of the necessity of &quot;drawing the ties of intimate relationship between us and the Hawaiian Islands so as to make them practically a part of the American system without derogation of their absolute independence.&quot;

Constitutional reforms in Hawaii in 1887 had widened the gulf between foreign businessmen and native Hawaiian nationalists. In January 1891 the Hawaiian King, who had been sympathetic to the interests of the foreign businessmen, died while on a visit to the United States. He was succeeded by his sister, the Princess, who was crowned Queen Lili&#x27;uokalani. The new Queen was known to dislike the restrictive constitution of 1887, and envoy Stevens suspected the Queen&#x27;s nationalist sympathies. He asked that a United States warship, the be stationed indefinitely in Honolulu harbor.

In March 1892 envoy Stevens wrote to United States Secretary of State James G. Blaine, his old newspaper partner, asking how far he might deviate from standard State Department rules if a native revolutionary movement emerged. &quot;The golden hour is near at hand,&quot; Stevens later wrote his old partner and friend Blaine. &quot;So long as the islands retain their own independent government there remains the possibility that England or the Canadian Dominion might secure one of the Hawaiian harbors for a coaling station.&quot; Added Stevens: &quot;Annexation excludes all dangers of this kind.&quot;

The question had taken on significance after the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1886. Seeking to capitalize on the new transcontinental link in Canada, British capitalists were said to welcome the addition of the Hawaiian Islands as an English protectorate. For aggressive Manifest Destiny advocates like Stevens, the telegraphing of English intentions – even by diplomatic innuendo – signaled the need for a preemptive American response.

==Overthrow and Stevens&#x27;s response==

At the time of the Bayonet Constitution of 1887 Grover Cleveland was president, and his secretary of state Thomas F. Bayard sent written instructions to the American minister George W. Merrill that in the event of another revolution in Hawaii, it was a priority to protect American commerce, lives and property. Bayard specified, &quot;the assistance of the officers of our Government vessels, if found necessary, will therefore be promptly afforded to promote the reign of law and respect for orderly government in Hawaii.&quot; In July 1889, there was a small scale rebellion, and Minister Merrill landed Marines to protect Americans; the State Department explicitly approved his action. Merrill&#x27;s replacement, minister John L. Stevens, read those official instructions, and followed them in his controversial actions of 1893.

On January 14, 1893, envoy Stevens met with two other men concerned about American territorial interests in the Pacific. That night, Stevens and American-Hawaiian businessmen Sanford Dole and Lorrin Thurston met to hatch &quot;an audacious plot to overthrow Hawaii&#x27;s Queen and bring her country into the United States,&quot; writes &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Stephen Kinzer in his book &quot;Overthrow&quot;.

The immediate event which precipitated the meeting was Queen Lili&#x27;uokalani&#x27;s attempt to promulgate a new constitution which would have restored many of the powers of the monarchy that existed prior to the forced promulgation of the &quot;Bayonet Constitution&quot; in 1887 that reduced the power of the Hawaiian monarch and rescinded voting rights to much of the population. The Queen&#x27;s cabinet refused to go along with the planned new constitution, and Queen Liliuokalani temporarily yielded. But to the ardent Annexationists the volatile situation provided an opportunity that they seized. The Annexation Club morphed into a Committee of Safety; it shepherded documents drafted to establish a provisional government.

The Committee of Safety expressed concern for the safety and property of American residents in Honolulu. Minister Stevens, advised about these supposed threats to non-combatant American lives and property by the Committee of Safety, obliged their request and summoned a company of uniformed U.S. Marines from the &quot;Boston&quot; and two companies of U.S. sailors to land on the Kingdom and take up positions in strategic locations in Honolulu on the afternoon of January 16, 1893. 162 sailors and Marines aboard the &quot;Boston&quot; came ashore well-armed but under orders of neutrality. They were positioned around Royal residences and Hawaiian government installations, not around United States citizens&#x27; quarters. Having observed the troops&#x27; march up the street, the Queen was heard to remark that the Marines were finishing what the &quot;missionaries&quot; started. The presence of the Marines served effectively in intimidating royalist defenders. Historian William Russ states, &quot;the injunction to prevent fighting of any kind made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself.&quot; Due to the Queen&#x27;s desire &quot;to avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life&quot; for her subjects and after some deliberation, at the urging of advisers and friends, the Queen ordered her forces to surrender. The Honolulu Rifles took over government buildings, disarmed the Royal Guard, and declared a Provisional Government.

Minister Stevens recognized the new government, giving his blessing on behalf of the United States Department of State, and commissioners were immediately dispatched to Washington to request that Hawaii be annexed by the United States. On February 9, 1893, Stevens acted preemptively, establishing a protectorate pending negotiations for annexation. On February 16, President Harrison sent a message to the Senate, formally requesting annexation of the Hawaiian kingdom.

But President Cleveland, immediately following his inauguration, sent a message to the Senate, canceling all further talk of annexation. He then sent a commissioner to the Islands to assess the situation, who reported that the newly established protectorate be withdrawn as unnecessary. Envoy Stevens immediately resigned and returned to Maine, where he spent his time in public denunciation of the new administration&#x27;s Hawaiian policy.

The Blount Report commissioned by President Grover Cleveland was submitted on July 17, 1893, and found Stevens guilty of inappropriate conduct in support of the conspiracy to overthrow Hawaii&#x27;s Queen. Answering the charges from his Augusta, Maine, home, Stevens supplied his rationale: the Queen was immoral, and so needed to be dethroned. The later Morgan investigation conducted by the U.S. Congress, which led to the Morgan Report on February 26, 1894, found Stevens and other U.S. agents not guilty, after which Cleveland abandoned the matter because of lack of Congressional support. Both the Blount and Morgan Reports are cited by partisans on both sides to support their claims about the legitimacy or lack thereof of the overthrow.

In 1993, Congress passed and the President signed an Apology Resolution apologizing for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii a century before. Based on the Blount Report and other historical analyses, the Resolution subsequently became a touchstone in the cultural and political identification of many native Hawaiians.

==Forced retirement and later life==

Following his forced retirement in 1893 because of the overthrow of Hawaii, Stevens spent his time lecturing and writing and working in Republican Party circles. He died two years later. During his retirement, Stevens worked to rehabilitate his image following his humiliating firing by the new President. In 1894, the former preacher and newspaper editor published &quot;Picturesque Hawaii: A Charming Description of Her Unique History, Strange People, Exquisite Climate, Wondrous Volcanoes, Luxurious Productions, Beautiful Cities, Corrupt Monarchy, Recent Revolution and Provisional Government&quot;, a strange volume of part memoir, part travelogue and part political tract meant to provide a rationale for his actions in the Islands.

During his life, Stevens authored several other books, including a two-volume biography of Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus and his involvement in the Thirty Years War, praised by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as showing &quot;extensive research and much patient reading.&quot; The prolific Stevens also authored assorted letters, speeches and tracts, many of them advocating his Manifest Destiny views on American foreign policy. Stevens was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws by Tufts College in 1882. American author and orientalist William Elliot Griffis dedicated his book &quot;America in the East&quot; to Stevens, who, Griffis wrote, &quot;believing that the lives and property of American citizens abroad ought to be as well protected as if they were at home, acting according to his faith.&quot;

John L. Stevens was married to the former Mary Lowell Smith of Hallowell, Maine, on May 10, 1845. The couple had one son and three daughters, one of whom drowned on January 20, 1893 – three days after the Hawaiian overthrow Stevens helped engineer – and an event said to have sent the diplomat into crippling depression.

Hon. John L. Stevens died at his home in Augusta, Maine, at 4 a.m. on February 8, 1895, of heart disease.

In 1898 the United States government officially annexed Hawaii. A seven-piece silver service made of melted silver dollars and given to Stevens after his Hawaiian tenure by pro-Annexation forces in Hawaii is still owned by Stevens&#x27;s descendants. The tea service, and the career of its controversial owner, were the subject of a Public Broadcasting Service documentary in 1998 entitled &quot;The Nation Within&quot;. A one-act play entitled &quot;Cry for the Gods&quot; was written by Judge Paul Handy which presents a dramatized, fictional meeting between Stevens and the Queen on the night of January 16, 1893. It has been performed in Maryland and as part of the Capital Fringe Festival in Washington, DC.

<text>Cypress Lawn Memorial Park, established by Hamden Holmes Noble in 1892, is a rural cemetery located in Colma, California, a place known as the &quot;City of the Silent&quot;.

== History ==
Noble was a Civil War veteran who moved to California in 1865 and was a member of the San Francisco Stock Exchange prior to founding Cypress Lawn. On March 9, 1892, Noble was granted a permit to establish a non-sectarian cemetery and plans for Cypress Lawn were made public as work had begun on a mortuary chapel and receiving vault. Noble was responsible for the initial layout and landscape architecture of the cemetery.

The prominent castle-like granite entry gate east of El Camino was designed by the B. McDougall architecture firm in San Francisco in 1892, incorporating Mission Revival elements, and completed in 1893. The site was dedicated on May 28, 1893. A crematory also was completed in 1893, housed in a building designed by Albert Pissis and William P. Moore; it was damaged beyond repair during the 1957 San Francisco earthquake and subsequently demolished.

The idea of rural or garden cemeteries (as opposed to city cemeteries) became popular in the mid 19th-century in the United States following the founding of Mount Auburn Cemetery, and cities like San Francisco began relocating their badly maintained urban cemeteries to suburban settings. Between February 1940 until 1945, many of the remains from the Lone Mountain Cemetery complex in San Francisco had been moved to Cypress Lawn Memorial Park and were placed in a mound. In 1993, a memorial obelisk was added to the grassy mound to commemorate those that had been re-interred.

The cemetery was among those profiled in the PBS documentary &quot;A Cemetery Special&quot; (2005) by Rick Sebak.

==Site==
The original cemetery occupies east of El Camino Real and west of Hillside Boulevard and is known as the East Campus; the site was expanded by west of El Camino, acquired in 1901, named the West Campus. Lakes were added in the 1920s. In 2006, Cypress Lawn opened the Hillside Gardens, northeast of the original campus. The Mount Olivet cemetery, founded in 1896 on adjacent to Hillside Gardens, was acquired by Cypress Lawn in 2020 and renamed Olivet Gardens.

Several structures are on the original (East Campus) site, including the 1892 entrance gate, the Noble Chapel and Crematory, named for the founder and completed in 1894, and the original columbarium, completed in 1895 to a design by Edward Hatherton and T. Paterson Ross. The Lakeside Columbarium, also on the East Campus, was designed by Bernard J. S. Cahill and started in 1927, but construction was suspended in 1930 due to the Great Depression and never resumed. On the West Campus, both the Public Mausoleum and Catacombs (completed 1921) and the Administration Building (1919) were also designed by Cahill.

Since 2020, an annual Arboretum day is held in November to celebrate the site&#x27;s trees, some of which were selected and planted by Noble. One of the notable trees on the original campus is a Monterey cypress which was estimated to be planted before 1906.

==Notable burials==

Cypress Lawn Memorial Park is the final resting site for several members of the celebrated Hearst family, people from the California Gold Rush, plus other prominent citizens from the city of San Francisco and nearby surroundings. By 1992, more than 300,000 had been interred at the site.

Three British Commonwealth service personnel of World War I were buried here, but only one, Lieutenant Norman Travers Simpkin (died 1919), Royal Field Artillery, has a marked grave in the cemetery. Two others, Canadian Army soldiers, are alternatively commemorated on a special memorial in Greenlawn Memorial Park in Colma.

<doc id="730518" wikidata="Q363970" url="?curid=730518" title="Yves Congar">
<text>Yves Marie-Joseph Congar (; 13 April 1904 – 22 June 1995) was a French Dominican friar, priest, and theologian. He is perhaps best known for his influence at the Second Vatican Council and for reviving theological interest in the Holy Spirit for the life of individuals and of the church. He was created a cardinal of the Catholic Church in 1994.

==Early life==
Congar was born in Sedan in northeast France in 1904. His father Georges Congar was a bank manager. Congar&#x27;s hometown was occupied by German military forces for much of World War I, and his father was among the men deported to Lithuania. Upon the urging of his mother, Lucie Congar née Desoye (called &quot;Tere&quot; by Yves throughout his life), Congar recorded the occupation in an extensive series of illustrated diaries which were later published. They provide a unique historical insight into the war from a child&#x27;s point of view.

Encouraged by a local priest Daniel Lallement, Congar entered the diocesan seminary. Moving to Paris in 1921, he had Jacques Maritain among his philosophy teachers and the Dominican theologian Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange as a retreat master.

==Priest and prisoner-of-war==
After a year of compulsory military service (1924–1925), which Congar spent in the Rhineland, in 1925 he joined the Dominican Order at Amiens, where he took &quot;Marie-Joseph&quot; as his name in religion. Towards the end of his theological studies from 1926 to 1931 at Le Saulchoir, the Dominican theologate which was then located in Kain-la-Tombe, Belgium, and focused on historical theology, Congar was ordained a priest on 25 July 1930 by Luigi Maglione, nuncio in Paris. In 1931 Congar defended his doctoral dissertation written at Le Saulchoir, on the unity of the Church.

Congar was a faculty member at Le Saulchoir from 1931 to 1939, moving with the Institution in 1937 from Kain-la-Tombe to Étiolles near Paris. In 1932 he began his teaching career as Professor of Fundamental Theology, conducting a course on ecclesiology. Congar was influenced by the Dominicans Ambroise Gardeil and Marie-Dominique Chenu, by the writings of Johann Adam Möhler, and by his ecumenical contacts with Protestant and Eastern Orthodox theologians. Congar concluded that the mission of the church was impeded by what he and Chenu termed &quot;baroque theology.&quot;

In 1937 Congar founded the &quot;Unam Sanctam&quot; series, addressing historical themes in Catholic ecclesiology. These books called for a &quot;return to the sources&quot; to set theological foundations for ecumenism, and the series would eventually run to 77 volumes. He wrote for a wide variety of scholarly and popular journals, and published numerous books.

During World War II Congar was drafted into the French army as a chaplain with the rank of lieutenant. He was captured and held from 1940 to 1945 as a prisoner of war by the Germans in Colditz and Lübeck&#x27;s Oflag, after repeated attempts to escape. Later he was made a Knight (Chevalier) of the French Legion of Honour, and awarded the Croix de Guerre. In addition he was awarded the Médaille des Évadés for his numerous escape attempts.

==Scholar and ecumenist==
After the war, Congar continued to teach at Le Saulchoir, which had been returned to France, and to write, eventually becoming one of the most influential theologians of the 20th century on the topic of the Catholic Church and ecumenism.

Congar was an early advocate of the ecumenical movement, encouraging openness to ideas stemming from the Eastern Orthodox Church and Protestant Christianity. He promoted the concept of a &quot;collegial&quot; papacy and criticised the Roman Curia, ultramontanism, and the clerical pomp that he observed at the Vatican. He also promoted the role of lay people in the church. Congar worked closely with the founder of the Young Christian Workers, Joseph Cardijn, for decades.

From 1947 to 1956 Congar&#x27;s controversial writing was restricted by the Vatican. One of his most important books &quot;True and False Reform in the Church&quot; (1950) and all of its translations were forbidden by Rome in 1952. Congar was prevented from teaching or publishing after 1954, during the pontificate of Pope Pius XII, following publication of an article in support of the worker-priest movement started by Jacques Loew in France. He was subsequently assigned to minor posts in Jerusalem, Rome, Cambridge and Strasbourg. Eventually, in 1956, Archbishop Jean Julien Weber of Strasbourg assisted Congar in returning to France.

Congar&#x27;s reputation recovered in 1960 when Pope John XXIII invited him to serve on the preparatory theological commission of the Second Vatican Council. Although Congar had little influence on the preparatory schemas, as the council progressed his expertise was recognized and some would regard him as the single most formative influence on Vatican II. He was a member of several committees that drafted conciliar texts, an experience that he documented in great detail in his daily journal. The journal extended from mid-1960 to December 1965. Following his direction, his journal was not released until 2000, and was first published in 2002 as &quot;Mon Journal du Concile I-II, présenté et annoté par Éric Mahieu&quot; (two volumes). A one-volume English translation appeared in 2012. Congar also wrote a diary during his years of trouble with the Holy Office entitled &quot;Journal d&#x27;un théologien 1946-1956, édité et presenté par Étienne Fouilloux.&quot; An English translation appeared in 2015; there is a prior Spanish translation.

After the council, Congar said &quot;respecting many questions, the council remained incomplete. It began a work which is not finished, whether it is a matter of collegiality, of the role of the laity, of missions and even of ecumenism.&quot; Congar&#x27;s work focused increasingly on the theology of the Holy Spirit (see Pneumatology), and his 3-volume work on the Spirit has become a classic. He was also a member of the International Theological Commission from 1969 to 1985.

Congar continued to lecture and write, publishing on topics including Mary, the Eucharist, lay ministry, and the Holy Spirit, as well as his diaries. His works include &quot;The Meaning of Tradition&quot; and &quot;After Nine Hundred Years&quot; which addresses the East-West Schism.

In 1963, Congar was diagnosed with a &quot;diffuse disease of the nervous system&quot; which caused weakness and numbness in his extremities. In 1985, the diagnosis was changed to a form of sclerosis which increasingly affected his mobility and writing ability, and made his scholarly research difficult. He became a resident at the Hôpital des Invalides in Paris from 1986.

==Cardinal and death==
In November 1994 he was named a cardinal deacon by Pope John Paul II, shortly before his death on 22 June the following year. His remains were buried in Montparnasse Cemetery.

<text>Homewood Field is the athletics stadium of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.

== History ==
It was built in 1906 and has an official capacity of 8,500 people. The name is taken, as is that of the entire campus, from the name of the estate of Charles Carroll of Carrollton. Homewood Field is located on the northern border of the campus. It serves as the home field for the university&#x27;s football, soccer, field hockey, and lacrosse teams.

It was also the home field for the professional lacrosse team, the Baltimore Bayhawks, for the 2001 and 2003 Major League Lacrosse seasons. It hosted the Division I NCAA Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship in 1975, and was the site for the 2016 Big Ten men&#x27;s lacrosse tournament. The south grandstand is named for Conrad Gebelein (1884–1981), longtime music director at the university.

While known primarily for being the &quot;Yankee Stadium of Lacrosse&quot;, its largest record crowd actually filled the stands for a football game. In 1915 on Thanksgiving Day, 13,000 spectators watched Hopkins grind out a 3–0 win over in-state rival Maryland. Fletcher Watts scored the game-winning field goal as the last moments ticked down. From then until 1934, the teams met on that day all but two years.
