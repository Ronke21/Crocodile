<text>&quot;The Death of Superman&quot; is a crossover story event mostly featured in DC Comics&#x27; Superman-related publications. The crossover, which originated from editor Mike Carlin and writers Dan Jurgens, Roger Stern, Louise Simonson, Jerry Ordway, and Karl Kesel, began in December 1992 and lasted until October 1993. It was published in &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Action Comics&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Justice League America&quot;, and &quot;Green Lantern&quot;. Since its initial publication, &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; has been reprinted in various formats and editions.

Development began after a planned story, in which Clark Kent (Superman) and Lois Lane would be married, was postponed to coincide with a similar storyline in the television series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;. While pitching possible replacements, Ordway jokingly suggested that they should kill Superman. As Superman comic sales had declined in recent years, the writing teams felt the character had been taken for granted and decided to temporarily kill him to emphasize his importance. They wanted the crossover to surprise readers and show Superman is not invincible.

&quot;The Death of Superman&quot; is divided into three story arcs: &quot;Doomsday!&quot;, &quot;Funeral for a Friend&quot;, and &quot;Reign of the Supermen!&quot;. The first arc chronicles Superman&#x27;s fight with the monster Doomsday and concludes with his death. The second depicts Superman&#x27;s fellow superheroes and the rest of the DC Universe mourning his death, ending with his adoptive father Jonathan Kent having a heart attack. The third sees the emergence of four Superman impostors before the original is resurrected. A number of characters in &quot;The Death of Superman&quot;, such as Doomsday, Superboy, the Cyborg Superman, Steel, and The Eradicator would recur in later DC publications.

When news broke that DC planned to kill Superman, a beloved cultural icon, &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; received unprecedented coverage from the mainstream media. &quot;Superman&quot; #75, which features Superman&#x27;s death, sold over six million copies and became the top-selling comic of 1992. Retrospective reviewers are divided on the story, with some finding it ambitious and influential, while others dismiss it as a publicity stunt.

The story has been adapted into various forms of media, including two novelizations in 1993 and a beat &#x27;em up video game, &quot;The Death and Return of Superman&quot;, in 1994. A loose animated film adaptation, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2007. A second animated adaptation was released as a two-part film, &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; and &quot;Reign of the Supermen&quot;, in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

== Publication history ==
=== Background ===

Superman is a superhero created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character debuted in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 on April 18, 1938, to immediate success, and the following year became the first superhero to headline his own comic book, &quot;Superman&quot;. Since his debut, Superman has been a cultural icon in the United States.

In 1985, DC launched the crossover event &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, which took place in a variety of comics. Its conclusion resulted in the DC Universe—the shared universe that the publisher&#x27;s comics, including those related to Superman, take place in—being rebooted. Writer/artist John Byrne re-envisioned Superman in his 1986 limited series, &quot;The Man of Steel&quot;. The following year, Byrne relaunched &quot;Superman&quot; with a new first issue and the original series was renamed &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;. In the reboot, Byrne removed various elements of the Superman mythos, like Supergirl, to streamline the character for modern audiences, which also allowed him to reintroduce them in a new way later on. The relaunch was a major success for DC and &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; #1 became the bestselling comic book issue of 1986. Byrne also wrote and illustrated &quot;Action Comics&quot;, and scripted &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; with artist Jerry Ordway. Under Byrne, a new Superman comic was released every week and each series maintained continuity with the others. He spent two years on the Superman comics before leaving in 1988, dissatisfied with DC&#x27;s lack of &quot;conscious support&quot; for him and that the version of Superman licensed for merchandising did not reflect Byrne&#x27;s stories.

As a result of Byrne&#x27;s departure, Superman group editor Mike Carlin had to assemble new creative teams to replace him. Ordway began to write &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;, while Roger Stern, who had recently finished a 12-year stint at rival publisher Marvel Comics, took over &quot;Action Comics&quot;. Connecting stories also became harder due to the new, more diverse creative teams, whereas Byrne had managed most of them on his own. To control consistency in stories, the teams regularly attended a &quot;Superman Summit&quot;, which started in 1988. The summit was a unique method of making the writers work together, focusing their attention to the next year&#x27;s worth of stories. These meetings were often dysfunctional, with &quot;Superman&quot; writer/penciler Dan Jurgens noting they frequently disagreed when discussing story ideas and argued until one person was &quot;left standing&quot;. Carlin recalled that he had to act like a &quot;babysitter&quot; for the 18 creators during summits, and the teams often compromised. When the writing teams were having trouble deciding stories, Ordway would jokingly suggest they kill Superman.

DC editor Paul Levitz liked the success of the three interconnected Superman comics, so a fourth, &quot;&quot; (written by Louise Simonson and penciled by Jon Bogdanove), started. While the creative teams believed the quality of the comics increased because there were more people working on them, they experienced a decline in sales, primarily due to the popularity of violent antiheroes like the Punisher, Spawn, and Wolverine. A new Superman comic was released every week, each selling roughly 150,000 copies an issue—&quot;a fraction&quot; of the numbers bestselling comics like those featuring Spider-Man enjoyed. The writing teams increased the romantic tension between Clark Kent (Superman&#x27;s civilian identity) and Lois Lane in an effort to make the comics more appealing. Eventually, they had Kent propose to Lane and reveal he was Superman, and began to plan a storyline about their marriage. According to Carlin, they developed the wedding arc between 1990 and 1991, and planned for it to conclude in &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #500 (June 1993). They also considered a &quot;Death of...&quot; story, but did not work on it in depth.

=== Development ===

While the Superman comics struggled, DC&#x27;s sister company Warner Bros. developed &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, a television series for ABC centered around the relationship between Lane and Kent. One of the ideas that arose during production was the wedding of Lane and Kent. Although the series did not exist in the same continuity as the comics, Warner Bros. wanted the Superman brand to remain consistent across all forms of media. As a result, Carlin and DC president Jenette Kahn decided to put the wedding in the comics on hold until &quot;Lois &amp; Clark&quot; reached its wedding episode in order that the stories could coincide. With the original storyline set aside in the comics, the teams needed a new event to replace it.

The postponement disappointed the writing teams, as they had to put aside a year&#x27;s worth of story planning and, according to Simonson, essentially had to come up with something at the last minute. At the 1991 summit, Ordway again made his joke, but no one laughed. Simonson spoke up and said, based on her experience from editing X-Men comics at Marvel, killing a major character &quot;show[s] just how much that character means – to his friends, family, enemies, to the whole world!&quot; Carlin liked the idea, and in the documentary film &quot;Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman&quot; (2006), he recalled, &quot;the world was taking Superman for granted, so we literally said &#x27;let&#x27;s show what the world would be like without Superman&#x27;&quot;. Jurgens formally pitched &quot;The Death of Superman&quot;, and DC let the project move forward, which shocked Ordway.

Prior to moving forward, Carlin asked Siegel if he had any concerns with the concept of killing Superman. Siegel felt it was &quot;a good way to shake things up&quot;; the teams felt better knowing he approved. Bogdanove recalled how the story &quot;almost began to write itself, from the end backwards. It felt like a story that could make the readers care again, the way we had always cared about Superman&quot;. &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; forced DC to cancel a non-canon, four-issue limited series Neil Gaiman and Matt Wagner were working on, as it also featured the character&#x27;s death. The initial plan called for Superman to be killed in &quot;Superman&quot; #75 (January 1993) and resurrected in &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #500, as both were milestone issues.
Jurgens created the concepts of a monster tearing apart Metropolis and an issue dedicated to a single fight sometime before &quot;The Death of Superman&quot;; the teams combined these when developing the story. Carlin had previously rejected the fight idea whenever Jurgens brought it up, feeling it would not be effective without a good story. When deciding which villain should kill Superman, the writers determined that his existing foes relied too much on technology and intellect, and did not want to use one of them or his traditional weakness, Kryptonite. Thus, they concluded that a new villain had to take him on physically. They chose to name this villain &quot;Doomsday&quot; after Carlin wrote the phrase &quot;doomsday for Superman&quot; on the whiteboard used for planning, and did not feel giving him an origin was important. The teams wanted Doomsday to have a distinctive look, so they gave all artists a few minutes to create designs and voted for the one they thought was best. Jurgens&#x27; design—a massive, muscular humanoid with bones ripping through his skin, inspired by the design style of Image Comics—won.

The four issues showing Superman&#x27;s fight with Doomsday feature a &quot;countdown&quot; of panels: the first has four per page, the second has three, the third has two, and the last simply comprises splash pages. Inker Brett Breeding conceived this, as he thought it would increase the suspense and speed of the action. Furthermore, Jurgens wanted to make an issue told through splash pages and the fight seemed like the perfect fit. The story was partly an effort to show the ramifications of a superpowered fight in a city, because, as Ordway said, it &quot;had to have consequences&quot;. The final page of issue #75—a triple-page spread depicting Lane mourning Superman—took considerable time to create. The writers wanted &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; to surprise readers, as they hoped to emphasize that Superman is not invincible and could be killed by something besides Kryptonite.
Chronicling the fallout of Superman&#x27;s death did not take long, according to Bogdanove. He thought, as &quot;the real meat of the story&quot;, it allowed them to accomplish their goal: explaining why the character matters. Ordway recalled the most exciting part for him was exploring what the DC Universe would be like without Superman and had fun writing about other characters&#x27; reactions to his death. DC did not intend for Superman&#x27;s death to be permanent and the teams kept this a secret; they signed non-disclosure agreements preventing them from revealing the character would return. Carlin expected fans to know the death would be temporary, and in 2018 said he still could not believe many did not. However, the teams delayed all Superman comics for three months to create the illusion that he had really been killed because DC&#x27;s solicitation cycle would have spoiled the resurrection.

The media attention caused Carlin to delay Superman&#x27;s resurrection beyond &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #500. Furthermore, the teams knew bringing Superman back in that issue would be illogical and held an emergency summit at a hotel in Terrytown, New York, where they plotted the final parts of the story. The teams considered bringing Superman back harder than killing him, as they did not want to make fans feel like they had been cheated. They decided to introduce a new version of Superman before bringing back the original, but the writers each had different ideas. Simonson suggested that each writer create their own Superman, which not only solved the problem of what this new character should be like but also let the creative teams have independence after years of forced collaboration. These characters, known as the Supermen, were created using three existing characters (Eradicator, Superboy, and Hank Henshaw) and a new one (John Henry Irons). According to Bogdanove, they used the Supermen to reinforce &quot;what makes Superman so super&quot;.

Stern characterized Eradicator as an &quot;Old Testament&quot; Superman who was more alien than human and compared his character to Jack Kirby&#x27;s Silver Surfer. He wanted the character to be introduced in a way that readers would not be able to tell he was Eradicator until revealed. Karl Kesel conceived Superboy for another series he pitched to editor Karen Berger beforehand and characterized him as &quot;an MTV generation&quot; Superman. Jurgens chose to reintroduce Henshaw, whom he created a few years earlier, with his Cyborg Superman. He hoped to trick readers into thinking Henshaw was the real Superman before revealing him as a villain. Simonson and Bogdanove based Irons (Steel), an &quot;everyman as Superman&quot;, on the African American folk hero John Henry and the Marvel character Iron Man. Additional replacements, including &quot;Little-Boy Superman&quot; and &quot;Rock-Creature Superman&quot; were created but never used. Even if their original idea was altered, each writer maintained a sense of individuality for their Superman.

&quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #500 was Ordway&#x27;s last issue on the title, as he wanted to spend time with his family. His contract was supposed to expire with issue #499 (February 1993) but he desired to end his run on a &quot;historical&quot; note. Ordway also hoped to use a character from &quot;The Sandman&quot;, Death, in issue #500 but was unable to do so because of an editorial mandate barring characters from DC&#x27;s mature comics line appearing in mainstream books like &quot;Superman&quot;. Kesel replaced him afterward. Because Jurgens did not want to simply use Superman&#x27;s classic design when he was revived, he gave him long hair. The teams also deepened the red and blue of Superman&#x27;s costume to signify that things would not be entirely the same for him. Superman briefly wore a black suit after his revival; this design came from a sketch Bogdanove made at a meeting.

=== Publication ===
&quot;The Death of Superman&quot; was first alluded to in Simonson&#x27;s &quot;Superman: The Man of Steel&quot; #17 (November 1992); after the issue&#x27;s story, a teaser panel shows Doomsday&#x27;s fist repeatedly punching a wall. The crossover began the following issue, in which Doomsday is unleashed and begins to carve a brutal path of destruction across America. This leads to Superman&#x27;s death in &quot;Superman&quot; #75, which DC published on November 18, 1992. There were several variants of issue #75: a standard newsstand edition; a direct market edition; and a collector&#x27;s edition sold in a polybag with a black armband, poster, stickers, and a trading card, which cost more than the standard edition. Following the in-comics funeral, all the Superman publications went on hiatus until the release of &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #500. Like &quot;Superman&quot; #75, collector&#x27;s editions of &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #500 came in polybags. One version had a translucent white bag with the red Superman logo, while another came in a black bag with a white logo. Each installment of the story received a second printing.

According to &quot;Vulture&quot;″s Abraham Riesman, DC &quot;aggressively&quot; promoted &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; since it had financial incentives to do so, as comic book speculation was at its peak. Publishers like DC would designate certain comic book issues as significant, causing mint condition copies to be sold for more money. For &quot;Superman&quot; #75, DC issued a press kit to stores with a cardboard coffin, stickers, and a poster. At the height of the crossover, in May 1993 DC published a special issue, &quot;Newstime: The Life and Death of The Man of Steel&quot;. It compiled fictional news stories about Superman&#x27;s death, providing an in-universe look at the event.

=== Collected editions ===
DC published the story in three collected volumes from 1992 to 1993: &quot;The Death of Superman&quot;, &quot;World Without a Superman&quot;, and &quot;The Return of Superman&quot;. &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; was released in time for the 1992 Christmas shopping season and, according to comics historian Matthew K. Manning, is the bestselling trade paperback of all time. Reprints of these collections were published in 2003, 1998, and 2004, respectively, while a recolored edition of &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; was released in 2013.

In September 2007, DC released an omnibus edition of the story, &quot;The Death and Return of Superman Omnibus&quot;. It features all the issues from previous collections along with 40 pages dedicated to promotional materials and interviews, for a total of 784 pages. Jurgens also contributed new cover art. A new version of the omnibus edition was published in 2013, while another reissue was released in 2019.

An edition of &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; containing the DVD/Blu-ray versions of the 2007 film adaptation, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2015. DC reissued &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; in four &quot;New Edition&quot; volumes on April 5, 2016: &quot;Superman: The Death of Superman&quot;; &quot;Superman: Funeral for a Friend&quot;; &quot;Superman: Reign of the Supermen&quot;; and &quot;Superman: The Return of Superman&quot;. DC published another collection, &quot;Superman: Doomsday&quot;, around the same time; it compiles comics that feature Doomsday&#x27;s return.

== Overview ==
=== Arcs ===

&quot;The Death of Superman&quot; is divided into a trilogy of story arcs; the first is known as &quot;Doomsday!&quot;, which leads to Superman&#x27;s death at the hands of Doomsday. The second story arc, &quot;Funeral for a Friend&quot;, which focuses on the immediate aftermath of Superman&#x27;s death, began with &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #498 (January 1993). The final story arc, &quot;Reign of the Supermen!&quot;, began with a prologue in &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #500 and introduced the Supermen. The title of this arc references Siegel and Shuster&#x27;s first Superman story, &quot;The Reign of the Superman&quot;. It crosses into the larger DC Universe, with &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #46 (October 1993) featuring a tie-in story. Despite the gap between the releases of &quot;Funeral for a Friend&quot; and &quot;Reign of the Supermen!&quot;, no time passed within the continuity of the comics. &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; concluded in October 1993 with &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #505, in which Superman returns to Metropolis.

=== Synopsis ===
Doomsday emerges from an underground bunker and encounters the Justice League International. He easily defeats them, but Superman arrives and the two fight across America. Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen are sent to cover the battle for television, while Lex Luthor dissuades Supergirl from joining the fight and convinces her that she is needed in Metropolis. Doomsday sees a commercial for a Metropolis wrestling competition and heads for the city.

Superman throws Doomsday on the mountain housing Project Cadmus, but fails to stop him from reaching Metropolis. Supergirl rebels against Luthor and goes to Superman&#x27;s aid, but a single punch from Doomsday knocks her to the ground. Professor Emil Hamilton and Bibbo Bibbowski fire a laser cannon at Doomsday, but it does not harm him. Doomsday and an exhausted and badly injured Superman fight and strike each other with so much force that the shockwaves from their punches shatter windows. At the struggle&#x27;s culminating moment in front of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; building, both lay a massive blow upon each other, killing Doomsday and mortally wounding Superman. In the arms of a frantic Lane, Superman succumbs to his wounds and dies. Olsen, Justice League members Ice and Bloodwynd, and Guardian are also present at the end, with Olsen bitterly photographing Superman&#x27;s fall.

Superman&#x27;s death stuns and traumatizes the residents of the DC Universe. His funeral is attended by nearly every superhero, as well as some supervillains, then President Bill Clinton, and First Lady Hillary Clinton. Every hero wears a black arm band featuring Superman&#x27;s crest. After the funeral, Project Cadmus steals Superman&#x27;s body from his mausoleum to clone him, but Lane and Supergirl recover it. With Superman gone, the crime rate rises; the costumed heroes of Metropolis, including a team funded by Luthor, rise to fill in as protectors but are insufficient.

Jonathan Kent takes Superman&#x27;s death the hardest. One night, while reading a newspaper story Lane wrote in Superman&#x27;s honor, Jonathan begins to feel responsible for his son&#x27;s death and has a heart attack in his wife Martha&#x27;s arms. In a coma, Jonathan meets Superman in the afterlife and convinces him to come back, before reawakening. Meanwhile, four men claiming to be Superman—Steel, the Cyborg Superman, Superboy, and Eradicator—emerge, and Lane discovers his grave is empty. Steel and Superboy are disproven as the original Superman, but the Cyborg and Eradicator both seem to recall some of his memories. Hamilton tests the Cyborg and concludes he is the real Superman. In actuality, Eradicator stole Superman&#x27;s body and placed it in a regeneration matrix in the Fortress of Solitude, drawing on his recovering energies for power.

A powerless Superman, wearing a black costume, escapes the matrix. The Cyborg helps Mongul destroy Coast City and, in its ruins, they begin to build Engine City in an effort to recreate Mongul&#x27;s home planet, Warworld. Superboy asks Steel to help him fight the Cyborg, and Superman and Supergirl join the two. They travel to Engine City, where the Cyborg launches a missile at Metropolis with the intent of destroying it and building a second Engine City in its place. Superboy manages to stop the missile before it strikes. Hal Jordan returns from space to find Coast City destroyed. Devastated, Jordan attacks Engine City and defeats Mongul. Eradicator joins the fight and shields Superman from Kryptonite gas. The gas kills Eradicator but also evolves within him. It passes into Superman, allowing him to regain his powers and defeat the Cyborg. Supergirl uses her powers to reconstruct Superman&#x27;s original costume and they return to Metropolis.

== Alternate versions ==

=== Tales from the Dark Multiverse ===
Lois becomes enraged and bitter after the death of Superman by Doomsday&#x27;s hands, believing the world failed him. After meeting the Eradicator, who failed to bring Superman back to life, Lois proposes that the two merge, turning Lois into the Eradicator. Taking extreme measures to &#x27;make the world a better place&#x27;, Lois kills Lex Luthor, the Joker and Batman and goes to fight the Cyborg Superman. When the real Superman returns, only for him to be killed by the Cyborg Superman, Lois kills the latter and continues her role as Earth&#x27;s &quot;savior&quot;.

== Reception ==
=== At release ===
As DC did not reveal that Superman would be revived at the end of the story, many fans believed &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; had permanently killed Superman, a beloved cultural icon. Thus, it attracted unprecedented coverage from the mainstream media; NPR&#x27;s Glen Weldon stated &quot;news outlets like &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;People&quot;, and New York&#x27;s &quot;Newsday&quot; pounced upon&quot; the killing of Superman, and it made the front page of &quot;Newsday&quot;. Details of &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; were covered by the media before DC wanted them to and the company&#x27;s publicists were not ready to talk about the story when it appeared in &quot;Newsday&quot;. Mark Potts of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; speculated the death would not last, but nonetheless expressed interest in what a world without Superman would be like.

&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) parodied &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; in a sketch in the seventh episode of its eighteenth season. The sketch depicts the casts of DC and Marvel attending Superman&#x27;s funeral. Black Lightning, portrayed by Sinbad, tries to enter, but no one knows him even though he claims to have taught Superman how to fly. &quot;Den of Geek!&quot; named this the best of &quot;SNL&quot;″s superhero-themed sketches.

The attention caused &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; to become an unforeseen success. Comic book retailers ordered five million copies of &quot;Superman&quot; #75 in advance and many people who had never read comics bought the issue hoping it would become an expensive collector&#x27;s item. Numerous former readers looking for nostalgia also purchased &quot;Superman&quot; #75. DC shipped between 2.5 and 3 million copies of the issue on the day of release and it sold out across America. Some stores had one-per-customer limits on the issue to avoid mobs and lines of customers longer than a city block. The issue brought in a total of 30 million during its first day on sale and ultimately sold more than six million copies, making it the bestselling comic book issue of 1992. Sales from &quot;Superman&quot; #75 doubled DC&#x27;s market share in November 1992. After the issue was released, Siegel met with Carlin to tell him that &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; impressed him. The success of the event turned Jurgens, who had been an average writer and penciller, into an industry star.

The four bestselling issues of 1993 were &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #500, &quot;Action Comics&quot; #687, &quot;Superman&quot; #78, and &quot;Superman: The Man of Steel&quot; #22. Additionally, the first installments of &quot;Reign of the Supermen!&quot; were among the top five bestselling comic books of June 1993. Valiant Comics timed the release of &quot;Bloodshot&quot; #1 to the release of #75, and &quot;&quot; #1 to the release of &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #500 to take advantage of the increased customers and boost sales. Both books included cover enhancements to attract customer attention. However, many retailers say &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #500 was the beginning of a decline in the comic industry. Retailers and distributors were stuck with unsold copies, and thousands of stores closed. Additionally, those who bought &quot;Superman&quot; #75 could only sell first printings for cover price a few months after its release.

=== In later years ===
Some commentators have retrospectively dismissed &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; as little more than a publicity stunt to give the Superman comics a brief surge in sales. Indeed, each series&#x27; sales immediately declined following Superman&#x27;s resurrection. While most fans figured the death was only temporary, those who did not felt deceived. &quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot; (2001), the eleventh episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ twelfth season, mocks this frustration through a scene in which Nelson Muntz holds the comic &quot;The Death of Sad Sack&quot; and declares &quot;this better not be another fake-out&quot;. &quot;Wizard&quot; compared the phenomenon to the New Coke debacle, in which The Coca-Cola Company updated the formula to its signature drink before quickly changing it back after negative publicity, leading to rumors that the company simply did so in an effort to spike sales.

&quot;ComicsAlliance&quot; writer Chris Sims believed that most people bought &quot;Superman&quot; #75 just to see Superman&#x27;s death, while Weldon speculated its sales were propelled by hopes it would become valuable. Gerard Jones, who wrote the &quot;Green Lantern&quot; tie-in story, theorized that the phenomenon may have been due in part to the then-relatively recent poor ending of the &quot;Superman&quot; film franchise. Sims recalled that when he worked in a comic book store in 2009, some customers were shocked that DC was still publishing Superman comics, as they did not read the story&#x27;s conclusion.

Generally, DC writers have denied &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; was a publicity stunt. Jurgens, for instance, stated he did not anticipate the attention, while Stern believed the sensation was caused only because it was a good story. Levitz said DC had no reason to think the wider public would care because they killed Superman in stories before.

Despite these accusations, many view &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; favorably. Sims called the crossover DC&#x27;s greatest success of the 1990s and a definitive Superman story. He thought that while killing off an important comics character was not an original idea, &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; was more ambitious and had a greater legacy than other similar events. Steve Morris of &quot;Comics Beat&quot; also thought it had a major impact, with &quot;strong storytelling and a simple, if well-done, central narrative&quot;. He said the main story was well planned, especially considering that it could have easily misfired. Brian Salvatore, writing for &quot;Multiversity Comics&quot;, believed the story was effective and &quot;present[ed] some pretty compelling arguments for why Superman is the greatest superhero of all time, without ever really coming out and saying that&quot;. He also praised the characterization, forcing Superman to rely on pure instinct.

Conversely, &quot;The Escapist&quot;″s Bob Chipman described the event as a &quot;dumb story full of crappy characters embodying almost all of the worst trends of dreadful [1990s] comics&quot;, and lamented its influence on subsequent Superman films and comics in general. Chad Nevett of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; called the story boring and jumbled, comparing issue #75 to &quot;trading cards that intend[ed] to tell a story than an actual comic story&quot;. Morris did criticize its subplots as nonsensical and felt Doomsday was terribly designed, disagreeing with Sims that it was a definitive Superman story. Salvatore felt it had missed opportunities and criticized the Justice League&#x27;s role in the story, comparing them to punching bags. Both Salvatore and Nevett thought Doomsday came out of nowhere, and Nevett joked he was a &quot;walking plot device&quot; rather than a true villain. Penciler Curt Swan disliked the story because he thought it &quot;came out of the blue. There was no build-up, no suspense developed. Superman had no foreboding of some force out there that would conquer him. It all occurred too quickly&quot;.

=== Legacy in comics ===
&quot;The Death of Superman&quot; had an immediate effect on DC&#x27;s comics. DC timed a similar event featuring Batman, &quot;&quot;, to happen shortly after &quot;The Death of Superman&quot;, followed by the deaths of Wonder Woman, Green Arrow, and the Flash. Green Lantern&#x27;s event, &quot;Emerald Twilight&quot;, in which he turned into the villain Parallax, ties to events that occur during &quot;The Death of Superman&quot;. Marvel published the Spider-Man &quot;Clone Saga&quot; as a response to the media attention &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; garnered. It featured Spider-Man having a baby, which Marvel believed would appeal to news outlets. Despite these similar story attempts, Weldon commented that the industry &quot;was in freefall&quot; and &quot;death/disabling stunts offered only brief sales spikes&quot;.

Some characters established during &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; became recurring characters in DC&#x27;s comics. Superboy and Steel received ongoing series after the story&#x27;s conclusion and Steel appears in a self-titled film (1997), portrayed by basketball player and Superman fan Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. Eradicator received a limited series, Superboy remained a fixture of the DC Universe until he was killed in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; (2005–2006), and the Cyborg Superman became a recurring enemy of Superman and Green Lantern. Later comics featuring Doomsday included &quot;Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey&quot; (1995), which explores his origin, and &quot;Reign of Doomsday&quot; (2011), which heavily references &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; and features him hunting down the Supermen.

In 2011, DC relaunched its entire comics line in an initiative called The New 52, which revamped the DC Universe and erased certain events. The relaunch altered Superman considerably, characterizing him as shorter-tempered and no longer married to Lois Lane. However, &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; remained intact in the new DC Universe. To coincide with the release of the animated film adaptation of the crossover in 2018, a 12-part &quot;Death of Superman&quot; webcomic series began, written by Simonson and illustrated by Cat Staggs, Joel Ojeda, and Laura Braga, among others. The first parts chronicle Superman&#x27;s actions hours before Doomsday kills him; later parts follow Jimmy Olsen during the confrontation and the aftermath of Superman&#x27;s death.

The 2019 one-shot &quot;Tales from the Dark Multiverse: The Death of Superman&quot; imagines a reality where Superman&#x27;s death causes Lois Lane to have a psychological breakdown. Lois goes to the Fortress of Solitude and learns the Eradicator failed to restore Superman. Lois merges with the Eradicator and uses her new abilities to force the world to accept Superman&#x27;s ideals. Her murder of criminals leads other heroes to oppose her, including the Cyborg Superman, Steel, and Superboy. Convinced she is correct, Lois fully adopts the identity of the Eradicator.

== Adaptations ==
Stern wrote a novelization of &quot;The Death of Superman&quot;, &quot;The Death and Life of Superman&quot;, in 1993. Additionally, Simonson wrote another adaptation, &quot;&quot;, around the same time. It features cover art by Alex Ross.

Blizzard Entertainment and Sunsoft developed a video game based on the story, &quot;The Death and Return of Superman&quot;, which was released in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and in 1995 for the Sega Genesis. &quot;The Death and Return of Superman&quot; is a beat &#x27;em up in which the player controls Superman and the Supermen as they attempt to save Metropolis. Retrospectively, &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;″s Dave Cook considered it the game that &quot;finally [gave] Superman the video game justice he deserves in what is undoubtedly one of his most celebrated stories&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot;″s Greg Miller called it one of his favorite games and said it was what inspired him to become a video game journalist.

In the wake of &quot;The Death of Superman&quot;, Warner Bros. acquired the rights to produce Superman films, and hired Jon Peters to write a script for a sequel to &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; (1987). The script, called &quot;Superman Reborn&quot;, borrowed liberally from &quot;The Death of Superman&quot;, including the fight between Superman and Doomsday, but Warner Bros. disliked it due to its similar themes to &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995). Later rewrites altered the story considerably and the film ultimately never came to fruition. &quot;Superman Lives&quot;, another canceled Superman film that would have been directed by Tim Burton, started as an adaptation of &quot;The Death of Superman&quot;; Warner Bros. executives believed the story was &quot;the key&quot; to revive the &quot;Superman&quot; franchise.

Warner Bros. released an animated direct-to-video film adaptation, &quot;&quot;, in 2007. &quot;Superman: Doomsday&quot; is loosely based on &quot;The Death of Superman&quot;; to fit within a 75-minute runtime, the story was condensed and greatly altered. For example, the Justice League is not present and most aspects of &quot;Reign of the Supermen!&quot; were removed. The film was a commercial success and started the DC Universe Animated Original Movies line of direct-to-video releases.

The DC Extended Universe series of films contains references to &quot;The Death of Superman&quot;, beginning with the appearance of Superman&#x27;s black suit in &quot;Man of Steel&quot; (2013). The climax of &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; (2016) draws narrative elements from &quot;Doomsday!&quot;. In the film, Lex Luthor uses forbidden Kryptonian genetic engineering projects to combine General Zod&#x27;s corpse with his own DNA, creating Doomsday. During their fight, Superman and Doomsday deliver killing blows, respectively, and both die. Jurgens received a &quot;Special Thanks&quot; credit at the end of the film. In &quot;Justice League&quot; (2017), the black suit reappears as an Easter egg in a deleted scene. Costume designer Michael Wilkinson explained that director Zack Snyder planned to have Superman wear the suit when he was resurrected in the film, but scrapped the idea in pre-production. Superman wore the black suit in Snyder&#x27;s 2021 director&#x27;s cut of the film, &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot;.

A second animated film adaptation was made in two parts: &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; (2018) and &quot;Reign of the Supermen&quot; (2019), part of the DC Universe Animated Original Movies line and of DC Animated Movie Universe. Compared to &quot;Superman: Doomsday&quot;, the new adaptation is more faithful to the comic story. DC&#x27;s Tim Beedle considered the films &quot;much less condensed&quot; and said they &quot;include many of the fan-favorite moments from the story that were left out of &quot;Doomsday&quot;&quot;.

Elements of &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; and &quot;Reign of the Supermen!&quot; appear in television series set in the Arrowverse: 
* During the 2019-2020 crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, a scene set on Earth-75 depicting their Earth&#x27;s Lois Lane (Elizabeth Tulloch) mourning a dead Superman (Tyler Hoechlin) can be shown on the news after being killed by Earth-38&#x27;s Lex Luthor (Jon Cryer). 
* The character John Henry Irons appears in &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;, portrayed by Wole Parks. This version is from a pre-Crisis Earth, before it was anti-mattered, and was married to his Earth&#x27;s Lois Lane and together had a daughter named Natalie. One day, their Earth is suddenly invaded by an army of evil Kryptonians unleashed by Morgan Edge/Tal-Rho and led by a rogue Kal-El, bearing a black suit. John and Nat build a Steel made suit equipped with a kinetic heavy hammer and an A.I which is set for Lex Luthor. After finding Kal-El, Irons goes after him promising Nat he will return after he&#x27;d kill Kal. However, when plans don&#x27;t go as they seem, Kal kills Lois during a news broadcast and Irons flees in a ship that is being attacked by Kal. Just before Irons escapes, a wave of anti-matter destroys his Earth and crash lands on Earth-Prime. Sometime later, Irons discovers Earth-Prime&#x27;s Superman is alive. Fearing what would happen on this Earth like what happened on his Earth, Irons swears to kill Superman. In his Steel armor, Iron grabs Superman&#x27;s attention by attacking several oil rigs due to them containing lead, one of Superman&#x27;s weaknesses. Irons manages to stab Superman with Kryptonite, weakening Superman. Returning to his base somewhere in the pole, Irons is notified by his A.I, who has recognized Irons as &quot;Captain Luthor&quot;, that he has no Kryptonite left, prompting Irons to search for more around the globe while also building a new ship. Later, Irons introduces himself as Marcus Bridgewater to Lois and offers his help on her investigation on Earth-Prime&#x27;s Edge. When Lois becomes suspicious of Marcus, she deduces that she is actually John Henry Irons, who on Earth-Prime died six years ago in 2015 during a tour in Afghanistan. Superman then confronts Irons, who brutally injures Superman with his hammer. Superman is saved by his son Jordan and is taken into custody at the D.O.D. to be interrogated. Irons reveals to Superman what happened on his Earth and his plans to kill him. While being taken back to his cell, the facility is attacked by one of Edge&#x27;s X-Kryptonians who attacks Irons but is saved by Superman. Irons is released by the D.O.D. and makes amends with Superman, who wants to team up with Irons in a potential war on Earth-Prime before Irons drives off in the distance in his R.V. He then properly authorizes the A.I. to call him by his real name and erase the Luthor protocol.
*&quot;The Death of Superman&quot; Storyline appears in Superman &amp; Lois&#x27; season 3 and 4 where Lex Luthor experimented on Kal-El / Bizarro and transformed him into Doomsday to get revenge on the couple. After an intense battle in space, Doomsday rips out Superman&#x27;s heart and delivers it to Luthor. Clark&#x27;s son Jordan delivers his body to the Fortress to keep it in stasis until they can get his heart back. Jordan attempts to retrieve it from Luthor, but fails as the villain destroys it in front of him. When Lois&#x27; father is confronted by Luthor and Doomsday, he injects himself with the same serum used to resurrect Bizarro and allows himself to be killed by Doomsday so that his heart could be transferred into Superman&#x27;s body. The transfer successfully brings Superman back to life, albeit with some limitations on his powers that he eventually overcomes. In the series finale, it&#x27;s revealed Clark managed to live for 32 years after the transfer before he eventually dies of heart failure.

The film chronicles the cross-country journey of college students Walter Gibson (Cusack) and Alison Bradbury (Zuniga) as they make their way from New England to Los Angeles over Christmas break, each in an effort to meet their ideal romantic match.

Released theatrically in the spring of 1985, &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; received mostly favorable reviews from film critics, who commended it for its traditional comedic structure, with some likening it to a modern version of Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934), though Reiner himself stated that the parallels between the two films were unintentional.

==Plot==
High school senior Walter &quot;Gib&quot; Gibson and his best friend Lance are celebrating the fact they are moving on to college, but all Gib can do is lament the fact that he has lost his touch with women. Lance heads to UCLA while Gib moves on to college in New England. The two keep in touch by writing letters, but Gib&#x27;s luck has not changed. His attempt to woo the ambitious, pensive Alison Bradbury from his English class by tricking her into tutoring him only results in his angering and alienating her. Eventually, he receives a phone call from Lance telling him to come to California for Christmas break because he has set him up with a beautiful girl, assuring him she is a &quot;sure thing&quot;.

Gib finds a ride from a ride-share board to make the trip. He meets Gary Cooper and Mary Ann Webster, the couple providing the ride. Things go from bad to worse when he realizes he will be sitting next to Alison as she heads to UCLA to visit her boyfriend, Jason. The tension and bickering between Gib and Alison become too much for Gary and Mary Ann, and they abandon them on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere, infuriating Alison.

Alison hitches a ride from a middle-aged man who sexually harasses her, but Gib stops him. The two abandon him and decide to stick together, eventually making it to a train station. However, when Gib does not have enough money to cover his bus fare, the two instead check into a motel. Gib grows jealous when he overhears Alison talking to Jason on the phone, and ventures to a nearby bar where he spends his remaining money on alcohol and drunkenly sings Christmas carols with the locals.

The next morning, Gib rushes Alison out of the motel, and has her stuff her shirt with scarves so she appears pregnant, hoping it will increase their chances of getting a ride. The two manage to hitchhike to a restaurant, whereupon Alison realizes she left her appointment book and cash back at the motel. That night, the two are crestfallen when they find themselves caught outside in a rainstorm, until Alison realizes that she has her father&#x27;s emergency credit card. The two use the credit card to stay at an upscale hotel, where they treat themselves to drinks and dinner. The next morning, Alison is pleased to find Gib embracing her, but he quickly pulls away upon waking up.

While hitchhiking with a truck driver through Arizona, Alison overhears Gib explaining that he made the trip to meet his &quot;sure thing&quot;. Upon arriving at the UCLA campus, Alison angrily parts ways with Gib. That night, Gib attends a Christmas mixer where Lance has arranged for Gib to meet his &quot;sure thing&quot;. Meanwhile, Alison finds herself bored at Jason&#x27;s dormitory, and decides to drag him to the same party. Alison and Gib see each other, but their mutual jealousy leads to a confrontation between the two. Gib takes the &quot;sure thing&quot; to Lance&#x27;s room, but cannot stop thinking about Alison.

Back on campus after Christmas break, Alison and Gib are obviously uncomfortable around each other. In their English class, Professor Taub reads an essay composed by Gib as a writing assignment, which is a description of his night with the &quot;sure thing&quot;. The girl in the essay asks the protagonist if he loves her, but for the first time he realizes that those are not just words and he cannot sleep with her. Alison realizes what actually happened that night, she tells Gib that she and Jason broke up, and they kiss.

==Production==
===Development===
The origins of the film came from an experience writer Steven L. Bloom had while attending Brown University. During this time, his best friend was attending Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia and was constantly recounting the good times he was having, which Bloom felt left out of. Out of pity over his situation his friend arranged for him to meet a sure thing over spring break, so Bloom found a ride through a ride board and drove to Atlanta with a number of other students.

===Casting===
When casting for the part of Walter &quot;Gib&quot; Gibson began, director Rob Reiner initially refused to meet with John Cusack because the actor was under-aged. Casting directors Jane Jenkins and Janet Hirshenson convinced Reiner to audition Cusack, after which Reiner knew he had to have him for the part. At the time Anthony Edwards was seriously being considered for the lead, but after Cusack got the part, Edwards was offered the best friend role instead.

At the time of his casting, Cusack was still 16 and had not yet graduated from high school, so producer Roger Birnbaum had to go to court to have him emancipated. During the filming of the movie (March–April 1984), Birnbaum then became Cusack&#x27;s legal guardian.

Robert Bauer played the same character, Moke, in two Rob Reiner movies, &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; (1984) and this one.

===Filming===
Principal photography began in early March 1984 in Stockton and Los Angeles, California. Due to the fact that the winter of 1984 was uncharacteristically warm, the filmmakers struggled to locate snowy settings on the east coast for the sequences set there. Several days before shooting was scheduled to begin at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, a blizzard hit upstate New York, and a second unit was sent to Ithaca to capture the snowy locale. Meanwhile, the exteriors at the University of the Pacific—which was used as a stand-in for the east coast college campus—were sprayed with a fire-retardant foam to appear as though snow had fallen there. Additional photography took place at a beachside residence near Malibu.

==Soundtrack==
Many popular songs were used in the film but a soundtrack was never officially released. The following is a list of tracks featured in the film:

===Box office===
&quot;The Sure Thing&quot; was given advanced sneak previews in the United States and Canada on February 23, 1985 before its wide release on March 1, 1985. It earned over $18 million at the box office.

===Critical response===
Reviews for &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; were mostly positive. Film critic Roger Ebert, who gave it three-and-a-half stars out of four, praised the film and called it a &quot;small miracle&quot; for its handling of teenage material in an era when movies like &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; were the norm. In a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote that &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; was &quot;glowing proof of two things: Traditional romantic comedy can be adapted to suit the teen-age trade, and Mr. Reiner&#x27;s contribution to &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; was more than a matter of humor&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; deemed the film &quot;a sweetly old-fashioned look at the last lap of the coming-of-age ordeal in which the sure thing becomes less important than the real thing. Realization may not be earth shattering, but in an era of fast food and faster sex, return to the traditional is downright refreshing.&quot;

&quot;Time Out&quot; magazine described the film favorably as a &quot;confident, witty teenage variation on &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; [that] focuses on two students hitching across the States through rainstorms, starvation and show tunes. He&#x27;s a libidinous layabout who inadvertently dropped in to college. She&#x27;s an uptight goody-goody who believes spontaneity has its time and its place. There&#x27;s plenty of mileage in this pairing, even if the movie isn&#x27;t going anywhere unexpected.&quot;

In 2017, the British Film Institute ranked &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; among Reiner&#x27;s five most essential directorial efforts, noting: &quot;In an age when American teen comedies came to be defined by the success of &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; (1982), &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; triumphs from its winning formula of being sassy yet never bawdy and sentimental while never mawkish.&quot;

The film holds a rating of on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Though its final outcome is predictable, &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; is a charming, smartly written, and mature teen comedy featuring a breakout role for John Cusack.&quot;

===Home media===
MGM Home Entertainment released &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; in a special edition region 1 DVD on August 5, 2003. In 2015, Shout! Factory released a 30th-anniversary Blu-ray edition of the film. Sandpiper Pictures reissued a Blu-ray edition on December 19, 2023.

<text>Short Circuit is a 1986 American science fiction comedy film directed by John Badham and written by S. S. Wilson and Brent Maddock. The film centers on an experimental military robot that is struck by lightning and gains a human-like intelligence, prompting it to escape its facility to learn more about the world. It stars Ally Sheedy, Steve Guttenberg, Fisher Stevens, Austin Pendleton, and G. W. Bailey; Tim Blaney is the voice of the robot Number 5.

&quot;Short Circuit&quot; was theatrically released in the United States and Canada on May 9, 1986, by Tri-Star Pictures. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was a box office success, grossing $40.7 million against a $15 million budget. It earned three nominations, including Best Science Fiction Film, at the 14th Saturn Awards. The film&#x27;s sequel, titled &quot;Short Circuit 2&quot;, was directed by Kenneth Johnson and was theatrically released on July 6, 1988.

==Plot==

NOVA Laboratory robotics experts Newton Crosby and Ben Jabituya have developed a robotic soldier called S.A.I.N.T. (Strategic Artificially Intelligent Nuclear Transport) for the U.S. military to use in Cold War operations, though they would rather seek peaceful applications of the robots. After a live demonstration for the military, one of the units, S.A.I.N.T. Number 5, is struck by lightning arcing through the lab&#x27;s power grid. That scrambles the robot&#x27;s programming and makes it sentient, resulting in its escape from the NOVA facility.

The robot finds itself in Astoria, Oregon and is found by Stephanie Speck, an animal caregiver, who mistakes him for an alien. She takes the robot into her home, where she provides him with &quot;input&quot; in the form of visual and verbal stimuli, allowing the robot to improve its language skills. Stephanie continues to help the curious Number 5 robot learn about the world. She eventually discovers that Number 5 was built by NOVA, and contacts them about the lost robot. Nova&#x27;s CEO, Dr. Howard Marner, orders Crosby and Ben to recover Number 5, so they can disassemble and rebuild him. While waiting for NOVA to arrive, Number 5 learns about death when he accidentally crushes a grasshopper and concludes that if NOVA disassembles him, he will die, and escapes in Stephanie&#x27;s food truck. However, NOVA uses a tracking device on Number 5 to corner and deactivate him for return to the facility. During transport, Number 5 reactivates himself, removes the tracking device and flees back to Stephanie. NOVA meanwhile, offer a $25,000 bounty on the return of Number 5, which in turn attracts the unwanted attention of Stephanie&#x27;s abusive ex-boyfriend Frank, who turns up at her house to try and capture Number 5, but he quickly defeats Frank and dismantles his car. Knowing that Frank will alert NOVA and the authorities, Stephanie and Number 5 go on the run in search of Crosby, to convince him of Number 5&#x27;s sentience.

Due to Number 5&#x27;s unusual behaviour, Crosby tries to convince Howard that something has changed with Number 5&#x27;s programming and that they should take care not to damage it in their recovery efforts so that he can examine them later. Howard instead sends their security chief Captain Skroeder, who has an innate distrust of the robots, and S.A.I.N.T. prototypes 1, 2, and 3 to capture Number 5 by force, ignoring Crosby&#x27;s concerns. Number 5 outwits the other robots and reprograms their personalities to act like The Three Stooges, allowing him to escape. Number 5 kidnaps Crosby, takes him to Stephanie, and convinces Crosby of his sentience. They find that Skroeder has called in the United States Army to capture Number 5, and on his orders, restrain Crosby and Stephanie so he can open fire. To protect his friends, Number 5 leads the Army away and appears to be destroyed by a helicopter missile. Stephanie is devastated as Skroeder&#x27;s men scrounge the remains of Number 5 as trophies, prompting Crosby to resign from NOVA and drive away with Stephanie in the NOVA van. Howard is dismayed over the loss of his research and the $11 million monetary loss and fires Skroeder on the spot for his insubordination.

Crosby and Stephanie are surprised to discover that Number 5 had hidden under the van, having assembled a decoy of himself from spare parts to mislead the military. Crosby suggests taking Number 5 to a secluded ranch in Montana, where there will be much &quot;input&quot; for the robot, and Stephanie agrees to come with them. As they drive off, Number 5 asserts that his name should now be &quot;Johnny 5&quot; based on the El DeBarge song &quot;Who&#x27;s Johnny&quot; which had been playing on the van&#x27;s radio.

==Production==

This film was conceived after the producers distributed an educational video about a robot to various colleges. Studying other films with a prominent robot cast (like the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series) for inspiration, they decided to question human reactions to a &#x27;living&#x27; robot, on the premise that no one would initially believe its sentience. According to the DVD commentary, Number 5 was the most expensive part of the film, requiring several different versions to be made for different sequences. Almost everything else in the film was relatively inexpensive, allowing them to allocate as much money as they needed for the robot character. 

The inspiration for the design of number 5 came from Douglas Trumbull&#x27;s &quot;Showscan&quot; short entitled &quot;LETS GO&quot; which featured a robot named PAL that was designed by Eric Allard, Steven Spielberg saw the short and informed Badham to contact Allard for the robot construction in the film

Number 5 was designed by Syd Mead, the &quot;visual futurist&quot; famous for his work on &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Tron&quot;. although Mead&#x27;s design was greatly influenced by the sketches of Allard, the Robotics Supervisor credited for &quot;realizing&quot; the robots. Director John Badham named Allard &quot;the most valuable player&quot; on the film. Most of the arm movements of Number 5 were controlled by a &quot;telemetry suit&quot;, carried on the puppeteer&#x27;s upper torso. Each joint in the suit had a separate sensor, allowing the puppeteer&#x27;s arm and hand movements to be transferred directly to the machine. He was also voiced in real-time by his puppeteer, the director believing that it provided for more realistic interaction between the robot and the other actors than putting in his voice in post-production, although a few of his lines were re-dubbed later.

During Stephanie&#x27;s impromptu news interview, Badham makes a cameo appearance as the news cameraman. The sequence in the film depicting Number 5 watching the movie &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (and imitating John Travolta&#x27;s dance moves) is an in-joke, as Badham also directed &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;.

Fisher Stevens said that when he was originally hired to play Ben Jabituya, the character was not intended to be Indian. Stevens was fired and replaced by Bronson Pinchot at one point, but then Pinchot left to do the sitcom &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, and Stevens was rehired. To portray the role he had to grow a beard, dye his hair black, darken his skin with makeup, turn his blue eyes brown with contact lenses, speak with an East Indian accent and &quot;walk hunched over like a cricket player&quot;. In 2015, Aziz Ansari had a cordial discussion with Stevens over the role, with Ansari saying he did not view Stevens as a bad guy or someone who played Ben as a tired stereotype, and Stevens saying (with Ansari&#x27;s agreement) that a present-day version of the role would be played by an actor who had an Indian or a South Asian background.

In 2009, Austin Pendleton, who had gone to college with Badham, stated &quot;some stuff was cut out of my part in [&quot;Short Circuit&quot;]. And also the two leading roles were cast with really talented, attractive people who were not right for the parts. [The] script was just &#x27;heartbreakingly&#x27; beautiful to read. And now it&#x27;s a nice little slightly bland kids&#x27; movie. Nothing exactly wrong with it. Those two people who are in the leads are good, very likable, easy-to-work-with people, and have done some good work; they just weren&#x27;t those people that were written in the script. And I said to John when it was about to open, &#x27;Why did you cast them?&#x27; And he said, &#x27;That was what the studio insisted on&#x27;. And it sort of ended the discussion. I said, &#x27;Okay&#x27;. The film kind of works, but again, it was going to have been quite a beautiful film&quot;. According to Pendleton, the role Guttenberg ended up playing &quot;...was a person who could not relate to other human beings, so he poured all that into the creation of the robot. Well, Steve, he&#x27;s a lovely guy, and I think he&#x27;s talented. I think he has a real sharp—especially in those days when they were hiring him all the time—he had a wonderful kind of charisma. Very easy, but utterly social. He&#x27;s just so very engaging and open with people. He&#x27;s wonderful to be on a movie with. He&#x27;s just a real colleague. But he&#x27;s just that way with people. He does not bring onscreen with him the problem that the character in that movie has. So you hear that he&#x27;s shy and everything, but it&#x27;s more like a convention than anything else. The perfect person for the role, 20 years earlier, would have been Dustin Hoffman. That thing that Dustin brought to &quot;The Graduate&quot; that a more affable actor would not have.&quot;

Guttenberg and Bailey had previously worked together on the &quot;Police Academy&quot; series of films.

==Soundtrack==
Although no soundtrack album was released at the time, El DeBarge had a chart hit with the single &quot;Who&#x27;s Johnny (Theme from &quot;Short Circuit&quot;)&quot;. Released in 1986 on the Gordy label, the single was used for the film and reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&amp;B Singles chart. In 2008, Varèse Sarabande released David Shire&#x27;s score as part of their CD Club series of limited edition releases. The DeBarge song was not included or mentioned in the liner notes. The last three tracks are source music.

===Personnel===
* Max Carl - vocals, keyboards (track 10)
* Marcy Levy - vocals (track 10)

==Reception==
===Critical response===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A–&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;Short Circuit&quot; as &quot;a cheerful, inoffensive fantasy in which such attractive live actors as Steve Guttenberg and Ally Sheedy play second fiddle to machinery&quot; and wrote that &quot;the movie, which has the clean, well-scrubbed look of an old Disney comedy, is nicely acted.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a hip, sexless sci-fi sendup&quot; and praised the writers for &quot;some terrific dialog that would have been a lot less disarming if not for the winsome robot and Sheedy&#x27;s affection for it.&quot; The &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; gave &quot;Short Circuit&quot; a good review, saying: &quot;Number Five is the real star of this energetic film. Sheedy, Guttenberg and company are just supporting players&quot;. Roger Ebert, writing in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, rated &quot;Short Circuit&quot; 1.5 out of 4 stars and called it &quot;too cute for its own good&quot;. Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Short Circuit&quot; for issue 85 of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; and stated that &quot;there &quot;are&quot; good jokes, but the picture&#x27;s so bland they hardly count&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Short Circuit&quot; debuted at No. 1 in the US box office with a studio-reported weekend gross of $5.3 million, although independent sources suggested that the gross was inflated and more likely between $4.5 and $4.725 million. It grossed a domestic total of $40.7 million, ranking it 21st for 1986 in the United States; it performed slightly better than other hits of that year, such as &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;, &quot;The Fly&quot;, &quot;Three Amigos&quot;, &quot;Little Shop Of Horrors&quot;, and &quot;About Last Night&quot;. By 1987, &quot;Short Circuit&quot; had grossed in worldwide theatrical and ancillary revenues (not including merchandise). The film was reportedly the top home video rental of 1987.

===Accolades===
==Franchise==
===1987 video game===

A 1987 video game based on the 1986 film of the same name was published and developed by Ocean Software for ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC.

===1988 sequel===

A sequel, titled &quot;Short Circuit 2&quot;, was directed by Kenneth Johnson and was theatrically released on July 6, 1988. There was a script for a possible third film, where Johnny 5 went to college, that was written in 1989 and rewritten in 1990 but was found unsatisfactory by the producers, and the project was scrapped and canceled. Johnny 5 answered questions in character in a videotaped interview with Bobbie Wygant, a reporter based in Dallas, to promote &quot;Short Circuit 2&quot;.

A 1991 24-minute educational TV short film, titled &quot;Auto Theft: Hot Cars, Cold Facts&quot;, takes place after &quot;Short Circuit 2&quot;. The TV short film stars Gina Revarra as Lisa, John Hugh as Officer Dave, Donald Bishop as Howard and Russell Turner (the TV short film&#x27;s director, producer and co-editor) as the voice of Johnny 5.

===Planned remake===
On April 4, 2008, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Dimension Films had acquired the rights to remake the original film. Dan Milano had been hired to write the script, and David Foster to produce it. Foster said that the robot&#x27;s appearance would not change. Later in October 2009, reports circulated that Steve Carr would direct the remake and that the film&#x27;s plot would involve a boy from a broken family befriending the Number 5 robot. Carr left the project on August 4, 2011 and Tim Hill was reportedly hired to direct. On November 13, 2020, it was announced that Spyglass Media Group is set to remake the 1986 film, with Project X Entertainment&#x27;s James Vanderbilt, Paul Neinstein, and William Sherak producing and Rehab Entertainment&#x27;s John W. Hyde returning as executive producer alongside Terissa Kelton. The company hired the writing team of Eduardo Cisneros and Jason Shuman to put a Latin twist on the screenplay for the film.

== Contemporary whitewashing concerns ==
&quot;Short Circuit&quot; has become subject to contemporary criticism over the casting of Stevens, a Caucasian actor, to play the Indian character Ben along with brownface makeup. American comedian Aziz Ansari has cited the casting as an example of whitewashing in Hollywood. In 2021, Stevens said: &quot;It definitely haunts me. I still think it&#x27;s a really good movie, but I would never do that part again. The world was a different place in 1986, obviously&quot;.

According to Badham, the character was planned to be American when Stevens was cast. Inspired by a scene in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; (1984) in which a French shop assistant is rude to his American customers, Badham made Ben Indian, thinking the &quot;culture mismatch was fun&quot;. He said he would have had Indian or Indian-American actors audition for the movie if the decision been made before Stevens was cast. He said, &quot;That was an oversight on our part, but we never intended to make fun of the character of Ben&quot;.

<text>Raymond Blanc OBE (born 19 November 1949) is a French chef. Blanc is the chef at Le Manoir aux Quat&#x27; Saisons, a hotel-restaurant in Great Milton, Oxfordshire, England. The restaurant has two Michelin stars and scored 9/10 in the &quot;Good Food Guide&quot;. He is entirely self-taught, but has himself taught or employed other chefs including Heston Blumenthal, John Burton-Race, Michael Caines, Paul Liebrandt, and Marco Pierre White.

==Early life==
Blanc was born near Besançon, the capital of the Franche-Comté region in eastern France, between Burgundy and the Jura mountains. He grew up in Saône, a village just east of there.

While his two sisters were taught to cook by the influential Maman Blanc, his father taught Blanc and his two brothers to work in the kitchen garden. His father gave him a colander and foraging map for his 10th birthday, and what he collected his mother taught him to cook.

==Career==
Training as a waiter, Blanc worked at the Michelin-starred &quot;Le Palais de la Bière&quot; in Besançon. In 1972 he was fired for upsetting the head chef (Blanc had offered him advice on how to cook); however, the manager knew of a job in England.

Not speaking English well enough to survive without a notepad, he was dispatched to &quot;The Rose Revived&quot; in Newbridge, Oxfordshire, arriving three days after landing at Dover in his Renault 5 Gordini. Blanc married the owner&#x27;s daughter Jenny, and the couple had two sons.

Before striking out on his own in 1977, Blanc worked for a time under chef patron André Chavagnon, who had opened a French restaurant, La Sorbonne, in Oxford High Street in 1966.

In 1977, the Blancs opened &quot;Les Quat&#x27; Saisons&quot; in a row of modern shops in Summertown, Oxford: &quot;We mortgaged the house, owed 18 further people, and opened in a corridor between a lingerie shop and Oxfam&quot;. An overnight success, he won &quot;Egon Ronay Guide Restaurant of the Year&quot;, two Michelin stars and a host of other distinctions.

In 1981, Blanc opened La Maison Blanc, a chain of boulangeries and pâtisseries that also contain cafès. There were 14 branches of Maison Blanc across the country, including several in London and one in Oxford. Maison Blanc cakes were also available nationwide in Waitrose supermarkets. The chain was closed in 2017 by its owners, Kout Food Group.

In 1983, Blanc purchased a manor-house in the Oxfordshire village of Great Milton where he opened &quot;Le Manoir aux Quat&#x27; Saisons&quot;, a country house hotel and double Michelin starred restaurant. Awarded five AA stars and with a score of 19/20 from respected French guide Gault Millau, Le Manoir describes itself as &quot;one of the ultimate gastronomic destinations in the country&quot;.

Blanc opened Le Petit Blanc, the first of a chain of smaller restaurants, in Oxford in June 1996. Blanc&#x27;s stated aim with these was to bring the French philosophy of &quot;good food being central to good living&quot; to the United Kingdom. His desire was to create and serve food that can be enjoyed by everyone – &quot;from the time-conscious business person to those looking for a welcoming family restaurant&quot;.

Blanc suffered two mini strokes when he was 42, believed to have been brought on by stress and overwork.

In June 2003, after nearly losing the chain to his ex-wife Jenny as part of his divorce settlement, the four Le Petit Blanc Brasseries (now known as Brasserie Blanc) in Birmingham (which closed in 2008), Cheltenham, Manchester and Oxford became part of the Loch Fyne Restaurant Group portfolio. Blanc maintains a share in the business, and continues to be involved creating new menus, developing the chef and kitchen teams and participating in the promotion of the restaurants. Since 1996, Raymond has opened the following branches of Brasserie Blanc:

* 1996 - Le Petit Blanc brasserie, Oxford. Awarded one Michelin Star in its first year and classed amongst the ten best restaurants in the country, in 2006 it was re-launched as Brasserie Blanc
* 1998 - Cheltenham
* 1999 - Birmingham (closed 2008)
* 2000 - Manchester
* 2004 - Tunbridge Wells (closed 2009)
* 2007 - Leeds and Milton Keynes
* 2008 - Bristol (closed 2019) and Winchester
* 2009 - Portsmouth
* 2010 - Chichester and Threadneedle Street, London
* 2012 - Bath, Berkhamsted, St Albans and Chancery Lane, Charlotte Street, Covent Garden (closed 2016), St Paul&#x27;s and Tower Hill in London

In 2012 Blanc became the president of the Sustainable Restaurant Association.

Also In 2012 Blanc became the Culinary Director for Eurostar.

In March 2013, Raymond Blanc made the news with Mayor of London Boris Johnson, to publicise a scheme to get young people into the food and hospitality industry. Blanc took on twenty-one apprentices across the Brasserie Blanc Restaurants.

Blanc is one of the patrons of the Children&#x27;s Food Festival, which was held on the Northmoor Trust Estate in south Oxfordshire in June 2009.

In 2014 Blanc and Kate Humble presented &quot;Kew on a Plate&quot;, a 4-part television series demonstrating the garden growth and preparation of several vegetable dishes.

===Chefs trained by Blanc===
Blanc has taught or employed many other future chefs and restaurateurs, including: 
*Sat Bains
*John Burton-Race
*Heston Blumenthal
*Michael Caines
*Elisha Carter
*Éric Chavot
*William Curley
*Shaun Dickens
*David Goodridge
*Paul Heathcote
*David Chalton
*Marco Pierre White
*Jorge Rausch
*Nicholas Essex

===TV appearances===
Blanc has made numerous appearances on many major television stations, during prime time viewing, in the UK. These include his own series &quot;Food &amp; Drink&quot; in 1987, &quot;Take Six Cooks&quot; in 1986 and &quot;Masterchef&quot; in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1995 and 1998, as well as &quot;The Restaurant&quot;, a BBC 2 series hosted by Blanc where nine couples competed to win their own restaurant.

Blanc was a featured chef on &quot;Great Chefs&quot; television, appearing in &quot;Great Chefs of the World&quot;.

On 13 January 2007, he appeared on &quot;Saturday Kitchen&quot;. In the Omelette Challenge, he finished last because he took the longest to cook an omelette. However, he was nudged up a few places by James Martin, right above Ken Hom, as Blanc produced a black truffle out of his pocket and garnished the finished omelette with truffle shavings.

In summer 2007, a BBC promotion for his new reality TV programme &quot;The Restaurant&quot; was shown on UK television. (The show is known to BBC America viewers in the US as &quot;Last Restaurant Standing&quot;). The promo showed a group of well-dressed diners in a slow-motion food fight, to a Gonzales backing track. The show was part of BBC Two&#x27;s autumn season in 2007 and returned, with minor changes to the format, in 2008. In 2009, &quot;The Restaurant&quot; returned to BBC Two in a low-budget format. This season was much criticised for the poor standard of contestants, for neglecting the successful elements of previous series, and for Blanc choosing as the winner a team without any discernible culinary ability outside of making cocktails.

==Personal life==
Blanc has two sons, Olivier and Sebastien. Blanc lives in Oxford with long-term partner Natalia Traxel. In 2008 he received an honorary OBE.

During the fourth series of The Great British Bake Off Blanc
made personal attacks against contestant Ruby Tandoh in online comments. He derided her for being thin which he claimed indicated she must not truly love baking or cooking. He also criticized her for crying, which he called “female tears” and portrayed her crying as an attempt to manipulate the judges. 

Tandoh subsequently defended herself with an article in The Guardian and reflected on the anger and misogyny in online commentary about the show and responded to Blanc’s comments directly. Blanc later apologized for his comments, which became controversial. He self-depreciatingly described himself as a “grumpy Frenchman” to explain his behavior.

<doc id="736299" wikidata="Q749701" url="?curid=736299" title="Western rock nuthatch">
<text>The western rock nuthatch (Sitta neumayer) (sometimes known simply as rock nuthatch) is a small passerine bird which breeds from Croatia east through Greece and Turkey to Iran. This nuthatch is largely resident apart from some post-breeding dispersal. The eastern rock nuthatch &quot;Sitta tephronota&quot; is a separate species, which occurs further east in south-central Asia.

The western rock nuthatch is a bird associated with habitats with bare rocks, especially in mountainous areas. Those at the highest altitudes may move lower down in winter.

It feeds on insects and spiders in summer, supplemented with seeds and snails in winter. It feeds on the ground, and will wedge larger items in rock crevices while it hammers them open with its strong bill. It will also flycatch.

The western rock nuthatch is 13.5 cm long, slightly smaller than Eurasian nuthatch, and has the typical nuthatch big head, short tail and powerful bill and feet. It is long-legged and long-billed compared to most of its relatives.

The race &quot;S. n. neumayer&quot; of southeast Europe is dark grey above, and has a long strong black eyestripe. It has a white throat and underparts shading to buff on the belly. Sexes are similar, and young birds are slightly duller versions of the adults. Two other races in the west of its Asian range are similar but less well marked.

&quot;S.n. tschitscherini&quot; of western Iran is paler grey above and has a much weaker eyestripe. &quot;S.n. plumbea&quot; of southern Iran resembles &quot;tschitscherini&quot;, but has grey underparts.

This territorial species builds a flask-shaped nest from mud, dung and hair or feathers in a rock crevice, cave, or under an overhang on a rock face. Decorative items may be pushed into crevices and cracks near the entrance to the nest. The nest is lined with softer materials and the entrance is sealed with mud. 4-10 eggs are laid, and are white speckled with yellow.

The western rock nuthatch has a &quot;tsik&quot; call and a trilled &quot;tui tui tui &quot; song. It is common in suitable habitat in most of its range.

Pliny the Elder believed that it was these birds that inspired man to build homes of earth in imitation of the western rock nuthatch&#x27;s nests.

<text>Paul Weston (né Wetstein; March 12, 1912 – September 20, 1996) was an American pianist, arranger, composer, and conductor who worked in music and television from the 1930s to the 1970s, pioneering mood music and becoming known as &quot;the Father of Mood Music&quot;. His compositions include popular music songs such as &quot;I Should Care&quot;, &quot;Day by Day&quot;, and &quot;Shrimp Boats&quot;. He also wrote classical pieces, including &quot;Crescent City Suite&quot; and religious music, authoring several hymns and masses.

Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, Weston had a keen interest in music from an early age and learned to play the piano. He was educated at Springfield High School, then attended Dartmouth College and Columbia University.

At Dartmouth, Weston formed his own band and toured with the college band. He joined Columbia&#x27;s dance band, The Blue Lions, but was temporarily unable to perform following a rail accident, and did some arrangements while he recovered. He sold his first arrangements to Joe Haymes in 1934. When Haymes requested more material, Weston&#x27;s music was heard by Rudy Vallée, who offered him work on his radio show. Weston met Tommy Dorsey through Haymes and in 1936 became a member of Dorsey&#x27;s orchestra. He persuaded Dorsey to hire The Pied Pipers after hearing them in 1938, and the group toured with the bandleader.
After leaving Dorsey in 1940, Weston worked with Dinah Shore and moved to Hollywood when he was offered film work. In California he met Johnny Mercer, who invited him to write for his new label, Capitol Records. Weston became music director there, where he worked with singer Jo Stafford and developed the mood music genre. Stafford moved with him to Columbia Records in 1950, and they were married in 1952.

Weston worked extensively in television from the 1950s to the 1970s. He helped start the Grammy Awards, which were first presented in 1959. He was honored with a Grammy Trustees Award in 1971 and spent three years as music director of Disney on Parade.

Weston and Stafford developed a comedy routine where they assumed the guise of a bad lounge act named Jonathan and Darlene Edwards. Their first album was released in 1957. In 1960, their album &quot;Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. Weston&#x27;s work in music is honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early years and work==
Weston was born Paul Wetstein in Springfield, Massachusetts, to Paul Wetstein, a teacher, and Anna &quot;Annie&quot; Grady. The family moved to Pittsfield when Weston was two, and he spent his formative years in the town. His parents were both interested in music, and when Paul Sr taught at a private girls&#x27; school, he was allowed to bring the school&#x27;s gramophone home over the Christmas holidays. Weston remembered hearing &quot;Whispering Hope&quot; on it as a child.

At age eight, he started piano lessons. He was an economics major at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, where he graduated cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1933. During his college days, Weston had his own band called &quot;the Green Serenaders&quot;; this allowed him to pay his own college tuition. Weston also learned how to play the clarinet so he could travel with the college band. He went to graduate school at Columbia University and was active in the Blue Lions, Columbia&#x27;s dance band. In January 1934, Weston was seriously injured in a train accident. While trying to catch a train, Weston grabbed a door handle as the train sped off. He was able to hold on to the handle and was dragged two and one half miles before losing his grip. Unable to be active in a band, he started doing music arranging as a way to keep some involvement with music while convalescing. When he returned to New York in the fall of 1934, he made his first sale of his work to Joe Haymes. Haymes liked Weston&#x27;s work enough to ask him to do more arrangements for his band. His medley of &quot;Anything Goes&quot; songs was heard by Rudy Vallée, who contacted him and offered Weston a job as an arranger for his &quot;Fleischmann&#x27;s Hour&quot; on radio. Weston was also doing arranging for Phil Harris.

He met Tommy Dorsey through his work with Joe Haymes. Following the Dorsey Brothers split in 1935, Tommy had yet to form an orchestra; he used the Joe Haymes Orchestra for his first engagement as a solo conductor. Weston joined Dorsey as chief arranger in 1936, holding the position until 1940. He became Dinah Shore&#x27;s arranger/conductor and worked freelance for the Bob Crosby Orchestra. Weston also worked with &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; and Paul Whiteman. When Bob Crosby&#x27;s band was hired for his brother Bing&#x27;s film, &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;, this took him to Hollywood and into film work. He changed his name from Wetstein to Weston after his arrival in California. Weston was asked to do more work for Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, and also for Betty Hutton. Subsequent films as musical director include &quot;Belle of the Yukon&quot; (1944) and &quot;Road To Utopia&quot; (1945).

==Capitol and Columbia==

Weston met Johnny Mercer while working for Paramount in 1942; Mercer, who was preparing to start Capitol Records, wanted Weston to write for his new company. Paul wrote, arranged and directed Mercer&#x27;s &quot;Strip Polka&quot;—the first arrangement written for the new label on April 6, 1942. On August first of that year, the 1942–44 musicians&#x27; strike began. No union musicians could record for any record company, but were able to play for live engagements and radio shows; the issue which prompted the strike was regarding record companies paying royalties to musicians. Many record companies had &quot;stockpiled&quot; recordings of their stars prior to the strike, planning to release them over a period of time. While the older, more established record labels were able to do this, the newly formed Capitol had no opportunity to do likewise. The strike brought the new company to a standstill until Johnny Mercer began his radio show, &quot;Johnny Mercer&#x27;s Music Shop&quot;, in June 1943. The radio show was meant to be a venue for Capitol&#x27;s talent during the Musicians&#x27; Strike. Mercer and Capitol recording artist Jo Stafford hosted the program, with Weston and his orchestra providing the music for it. Stafford and Weston had first met in 1938, when he was working as an arranger for Tommy Dorsey; Weston was responsible for getting Stafford&#x27;s group, the Pied Pipers, an audition with Dorsey for his radio show. The recording ban was lifted for Capitol in October 1943 after an agreement was reached between the Musicians&#x27; Union and the record company; Weston was then able to return to the recording studio. In 1944, he became the company&#x27;s music director. When appointed, Weston was the youngest musical director for any major record company.

Besides his work at Capitol, Weston did conducting for many radio shows during this time. He worked with &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;, the radio shows of Joan Davis, and &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;. Jo Stafford, who became a regular host of &quot;the Chesterfield Supper Club&quot; in 1945, returned to California permanently in November 1946. Stafford later hosted the show from Hollywood, with Weston and his orchestra. It was around this time that Weston had a new idea for recorded music that would be similar to the soundtrack of a movie. It could be an enhancement to living but subtle enough not to stifle conversation. His album &quot;Music For Dreaming&quot; was the beginning of the &quot;Mood Music&quot; genre. In 1950, he left Capitol for a similar position at Columbia Records; Jo Stafford also signed with Columbia at the same time. He remained active in radio, with his own &quot;The Paul Weston Show&quot;, and also in acting roles on &quot;Dear John&quot; with Irene Rich, &quot;Valiant Lady&quot;, and &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot;.

Paul Weston and Jo Stafford were married on February 26, 1952; the couple had two children, Tim (born 1952), and Amy (born 1956). Both returned to Capitol in 1961, leaving the company for Dot Records in late 1965.

==Jonathan and Darlene Edwards==


In 1957 Weston was named musical director for NBC-TV, a position he held for five years, a founding member and the first president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and half of a recording duo that the whole country was talking about. Paul and Jo did a skit at their parties where he would play the role of a simply horrible lounge pianist and she would vocalize in off-key melodies to the tunes he tried to play.

He went public with his portion of the act at a Columbia Records convention, where it was an instant hit; the couple agreed to do some recordings, calling themselves Jonathan and Darlene Edwards. George Avakian, a Columbia Records executive, chose the name of Jonathan Edwards for Weston&#x27;s act in honor of the Calvinist preacher of the same name. Weston was concerned he might not be able to fill an album with the performances of Jonathan Edwards, so he asked Stafford to help. She became Darlene Edwards, the off-key singer. It was not immediately known to the public who had really made the records; there was much speculation as to what two famous people might be behind the music, before a 1957 &quot;Time&quot; article revealed their true identities.

In 1958, the fictional couple appeared on Jack Benny&#x27;s &quot;Shower of Stars&quot;, and, in 1960, on &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;. The couple won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album of 1960 for their work as the imaginary pair. While Weston was the conductor for &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot;, his perpetual houseguest, Jonathan Edwards, made an appearance on the program without his singing wife, Darlene. The vocal for &quot;I Love a Piano&quot; was provided by Kaye as the pair started the television show on March 25, 1964.

They continued to release Jonathan and Darlene albums for several years, and, in 1979, released a cover of the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot;, backed with &quot;I Am Woman&quot;. As Jonathan and Darlene Edwards, the couple released a &quot;sing along&quot; album which Mitch Miller believed put an end to his television show and sing-along records. Their last release, &quot;Darlene Remembers Duke, Jonathan Plays Fats&quot;, was issued in 1982.

==Grammys==
The original idea of honoring those in the recording industry came from the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce in 1957. Their plan was to propose bronze sidewalk markers to be placed on Hollywood Boulevard (the beginning of the current Hollywood Walk of Fame). The Chamber approached local top recording company executives with the idea, asking for help with a list of those who deserved the honor. Weston was one of the men named to this committee by the Chamber. The committee executives decided all those who had sold a million records or a quarter million record albums during their careers would be candidates for the bronze star markers. As they continued their research, the men on the committee realized that many very important people in the recording industry would not qualify for this type of recognition. This realization prompted the founding of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, whose purpose was to create an award for recording artists. It became known as the Grammy, and the first awards were given in 1959. Paul Weston&#x27;s dedication to music and recording was recognized with a Trustees&#x27; Award Grammy in 1971.

==Television and composing==
Weston had a long career as a musical director for television, including &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot;, &quot;The Jonathan Winters Show&quot;, &quot;The Jim Nabors Show&quot; and for &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, a 1961 variety show. He was also the conductor and arranger for his wife&#x27;s CBS television show from 1954 to 1955, &quot;The Jo Stafford Show&quot;. Although he did not provide the names of the programs, Weston once said conductors on live television shows, &quot;should also receive a stuntman&#x27;s check!&quot; In 1959, Weston worked with Art Carney and Bil Baird&#x27;s marionettes for an ABC television children&#x27;s special, &quot;Art Carney Meets Peter and the Wolf&quot;, and was nominated for his musical contributions to the show.

Weston arranged Ella Fitzgerald&#x27;s album &quot;Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Irving Berlin Song Book&quot; (1957), devoted to the music of Irving Berlin. Among songs he composed are &quot;I Should Care&quot; and &quot;Day by Day&quot;, both of which were collaborations with Sammy Cahn and Axel Stordahl and were big hits for Frank Sinatra. He co-wrote &quot;Shrimp Boats&quot;, published in 1951, which was popularized by Jo Stafford.

One of Weston&#x27;s songs made the tiny town of Hana on the island of Maui a household word. While on a visit to the area, Weston needed to shop for gifts for his two children. He found himself at the Hasegawa General Store, about which he wrote &quot;The Hasegawa General Store&quot;, based on his experiences there, which was recorded by Arthur Godfrey, Jim Nabors, and others.

Weston also wrote classical and religious music: one of his two symphonic suites, &quot;Crescent City Suite,&quot; has enjoyed many performances, in the &quot;Crescent City&quot;, New Orleans, and elsewhere. It was composed in 1956 and performed in New Orleans at the Municipal Auditorium in 1957 with Weston conducting. There was enough interest in the composition for a version for school bands to be made available in 1959; a symphonic version was also issued. He was the author of many hymns and two Masses which were published by the Gregorian Institute of America. He founded Corinthian Records in the late 1970s, a company which started as a religious music label, but which later became the distributor for the couple&#x27;s secular albums. His intention was to get the masters of both his and Stafford&#x27;s recordings for later reproduction on compact disk. He spent three years as the musical director of &quot;Disney on Parade&quot;.

==Retirement and death==
The couple retired from performing in the 1970s. Active for many years in charities helping the developmentally disabled, the Westons gave more of their time to these groups after their retirement. The AbilityFirst work center in Woodland Hills, California is named in Paul Weston&#x27;s memory. Weston died on September 20, 1996, in Santa Monica, California, aged 84. He is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City. In 2006, his widow, Jo Stafford donated her husband&#x27;s library and her own to the University of Arizona. She died in 2008, aged 90.

<text>Lucyna von Bachman Ćwierczakiewiczowa () (17 October 1826 — 26 February 1901) was a Polish journalist and author of Polish cookery books.

==Life and career==
Ćwierczakiewiczowa was born Lucyna von Bachman in Warsaw, into an extravagant upper-class family. In 1858, she published her first book &quot;Jedyne praktyczne przepisy wszelkich zapasów spiżarnianych oraz pieczenia ciast&quot; (&quot;The only practical compendium of recipes for all household stocks and pastry&quot;). Her work was based both on her own culinary experience and on 17th century and 18th century memoirs by Polish nobles. In 1860 she published another cookbook &quot;365 obiadów za pięć złotych&quot; (&quot;365 dinners for 5 zlotys&quot;).

In 1865 she started her own column in the Bluszcz weekly dealing with cuisine and fashion. She also collaborated with Kurier Warszawski, the most notable Warsaw-based newspaper of the time. In the 1870s, she published several other guides to cooking, cleaning and flower arrangement. She also began to invite many prominent figures to her salon at 3 Królewska Street. Among her guests were the most influential writers and journalists of her time, including Bolesław Prus.

Her books made her the most popular author in Poland. Before 1924, her first cook book was issued 23 times, with more than 130 thousand copies sold worldwide, more than all the books by Henryk Sienkiewicz and Bolesław Prus combined. Because of that, she became famous but was also mocked by many &quot;serious&quot; authors of the time. Her weight (more than 130 kilograms) and haughtiness gained her a nickname of &quot;Ćwierciakiewiczowa&quot;, an allusion to the Polish word &quot;ćwierć&quot; meaning &quot;a quarter&quot;. This nickname became so popular that nowadays her name is frequently misspelt, even in serious publications.

Since 1875, Ćwierczakiewiczowa devoted herself to preparing a yearly publication for women named &quot;Kolęda dla Gospodyń&quot;. It was a calendar filled with cooking recipes, women&#x27;s suffrage propaganda and short novels and poems.

She died in Warsaw and is buried in the Protestant Reformed Cemetery in Warsaw. Her tombstone mistakenly shows her birthdate as 1829.

<text>Jiujiang, formerly transliterated Kiukiang and Kew-Keang, is a prefecture-level city located on the southern shores of the Yangtze River in northwest Jiangxi Province in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is the second-largest prefecture-level city in Jiangxi and its borders include Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China. Jiujiang is the fourth largest port on the Yangtze River and was one of the first five cities that were opened to foreign trade along the Yangtze River following the implementation of Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s Opening-Up Policy. It is Jiangxi&#x27;s only international trade port city.

Its population was 4,600,276 inhabitants at the 2020 census, 1,164,268 of whom resided in the built-up area (metro) made up of three urban districts (aka Xunyang, Lianxi, and Chaisang). In 2007, the city was named China&#x27;s top ten livable cities by the Chinese Cities Brand Value Report, which was released at 2007 Beijing Summit of China Cities Forum. In 2022, the State Council of China granted Jiujiang the title of Famed National Historical and Cultural City for its rich history and multiculture background in the Republican era.

==History==
===Ancient history===
In ancient times it was told that nine rivers converged near where Jiujiang sprang up to become Jiangxi&#x27;s main water port today. From the Xia to the Shang dynasty, the capitals of several states were located in area of Jiujiang. In the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BCE) Jiujiang bordered between the states of Wu (downstream, to the east) and Chu (upstream, to the west).

===Imperial history===
Tao Yuanming (365–429 CE), a famous Chinese philosopher, recluse and poet, lived at the base of Mount Lu. He was once appointed magistrate of nearby Pengze County and after 83 days resigned owing to the politics involved in administering justice. He retired back to his village to pen an essay called &quot;Peach Blossom Spring&quot;. In 757, Li Bai (701–762 CE) was implicated in the An–Shi disturbances and exiled at Jiujiang. Bai Juyi (772–846 CE) wrote a poem called &quot;Lute Song&quot;, which is about his sadness and isolation of forced exile as a middle rank official to reside in such a small and remote town. In the 13th century Zhu Xi was a Confucian philosopher who practiced at the White Deer Grotto Academy, on Mount Lu&#x27;s eastern flanks.

Jiujiang has also been known as Jiangzhou () and Xunyang () in former times. During the Jin dynasty (266–420) it was known as Sin Yang, the Liang dynasty (502–557) of Southern and Northern Dynasties era it was called Jiangzhou. After reunification, the Sui dynasty saw its name as Jiujiang, and the Song dynasty (960–1127) called it Ting Jiang. The Ming dynasty (1368–1644), gave it Jiujiang which has retained its name to this day. It was a Taiping rebellion stronghold for five years (1850–1864) after they devastated the town to only leave one street with buildings intact. The city served as the capital of Taiping&#x27;s Jiangxi province during this time.

===British concession and European settlement history===


====The arrival of the Europeans====
A member of Lord Elgin&#x27;s committee arriving in 1858 to survey Chinese ports for treaty status noted: &quot;We found it to the last degree deplorable.&quot; A single dilapidated street, composed only of a few mean shops, was all that existed of this once thriving populous city. The remainder of the vast area composed within its massive walls 9–10 kilometers in circumference, contained nothing but ruins, weeds and kitchen gardens. After Jiujiang becoming an open treaty port in 1862, it was exporting Jiangxi&#x27;s vast rice crop. In 1904, more than 160,000 kilos of opium were moved through its customs house. The New York Methodist Mission Society&#x27;s superintendent, Virgil C. Hart, arrived in Kiukiang in 1866 and bought a piece of property just east of the city wall. This is where the city&#x27;s first Methodist church and Western hospital was built, with the hospital renamed the No. 1 Hospital, and the oldest/continuous operating hospital in Jiangxi Province. In 1896 Drs. Mary Stone (Shi Meiyu) and Ida Kahn (Kahn Cheng) arrived back in Jiujiang, being China&#x27;s first two native female Western-educated doctors; having graduated from the University of Michigan Medical School. They were provided with funds collected by Dr. I. N. Danforth (from Chicago residents), to build the Elizabeth Skelton Danforth Hospital and administered entirely by the native Chinese. This was later renamed Jiujiang Women&#x27;s and Children&#x27;s Hospital, and the nursing education by Drs. Stone and Kahn would later be the impetus for the founding of Jiujiang University and Jiujiang Medical School.

It became one of the three centers of the tea trade in China along with Hankou and Fuzhou. The Russians had two brick tea producing factories, but ceased operations after 1917. On October 16, 1927, there was an explosion of ammunition on the Chinese troopship &quot;Kuang Yuang&quot; near Jiujiang. The British surrendered their concession in 1927 after being robbed and its Chinese workers mutineered their posts to the marauding crowds. An economic recession had set in over the decades as Indian and Chelonian tea made for greater competition. A military advance was being staged upriver in Wuhan by the Kuomintang in 1927 and all the remaining expatriate community fled on British and American warships towards safer waters of Shanghai, to never return. Jiujiang languished as a port and much of its export trade was siphoned off with the connecting of Nanchang to coastal rail lines built in 1936–37.

====The establishment of the British concession====

After China&#x27;s defeat in the Second Opium War, China and Britain signed the Treaty of Tientsin. At the beginning of the eleventh year of Xianfeng (1861), the British counsellor, Harry Parkes, went to the new port on the Yangtse River by naval vessel according to the treaty to investigate the situation and select the site of concession to be opened. After the concession sites of Zhenjiang and Hankou were delimit, on March 22, Harry Parkes returned to Jiujiang from Hankou and decided to open up a commercial port in Jiujiang.

In the 11th year of Xianfeng (1861), Zhang Jixin, general minister of Jiangxi province, signed with Harry Parkers the treaty of opening up the British concession in Jiujiang, the Treaty of Land Lease in Jiujiang. The concession was located in a narrow area on the west of Jiujiang, between the Yangtze River and Gantang Lake, to the west of Longkai River, with a length of 150 zhang from east to west and a depth of 60 zhang from south to north, covering an area of 150 acres. The southern part of the concession includes part of PenPu Port.

====The development of Kuling in Mount Lu====

In the early 20th century, Kuling on top of Mount Lu became the summer resort for international residents because of its beautiful geological landscape and nice climate. At the golden age, over 4000 foreigners from America and European countries lived in this small town in summer time.

Kuling, on the slopes of a wide valley of Mount Lu, was established in 1895 by the missionaries Edward Selby Little, Dr. Edgerton Haskell Hart and three others, as a sanitarium and rest resort for Western missionaries in southern China. They built their houses in the colonial style of architecture, and added churches, schools, and sports facilities. It was named by Little, as a pun: it is wonderfully &quot;cooling&quot; after the summer heat in the plains below. It was also a word that sounded conveniently Chinese to the local people, and has been adopted by them. Kuling was run by the missionaries in a Kuling Council that sold the plots of the land and with the proceeds paid for local services and security. In 1910, Caroline Maddock Hart and four others met to found the Nurses Association of China; with Caroline Maddock Hart being its first president.

===Modern history===
In 1938, Jiujiang was occupied by Japanese forces during the Wuhan campaign. Following its capture, the city was the site of a &quot;mini-Nanjing Massacre,&quot; where male residents were executed and women raped. Many of the city&#x27;s urban districts and suburban villages were razed, including the city&#x27;s ceramics factories and boats used for transportation.

Until 1949 Jiujiang had very little industry except for local handicrafts. Manufacturing is Jiujiang&#x27;s backbone today with auto, machinery, petrochemical, shipbuilding and textiles as its cornerstones. After the completion of the Yangtze River Bridge in 1992 and the Beijing to Kowloon and Wuhan to Shanghai rail systems laid, a convenient ground corridor was provided and a regional airport now serves most of China&#x27;s capital cities.

In 2005, an earthquake hit Ruichang. Kuling American School Association donated 200 sets of desks and chairs and more than 50 sets of Oxford English-Chinese Dictionary to a local primary school near Ruichang.

Li Daoyuan from the Northern Wei period (386–534) theorizes that it is because the hill has a bell-shaped appearance and hollow inside, thus providing the sound when struck. Or it may be because of the water lapping within the limestone nooks and fissures around its base, as famous litterateur from the same time Su Shui discovered. Su Dongpo also did three trips around its perimeter, before settling on this last explanation for its unique sound also. Many Chinese literati&#x27;s have left more than twenty calligraphy masterpieces carved upon its rocks, with some dating back to the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE).

<text>Joseph Kay QC (27 February 1821 – 9 October 1878) was an English economist and judge on the Northern Circuit.

Kay was born at Salford, Lancashire, the brother of Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth, 1st Baronet and Sir Edward Kay. Educated privately and at Trinity College, Cambridge, he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1848. He was appointed judge of the Salford Hundred court of record in 1862 and became a member of the Portico Library in Manchester. In 1869 was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

Kay is best known for a series of works on the social condition of the poor in France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, and Austria, the materials for which he gathered on a four years tour as travelling bachelor of his university. They were &quot;The Education of the Poor in England and Europe&quot; (London, 1846); &quot;The Social Condition of the People in England and Europe&quot; (London, 1850, 2 vols.); &quot;The Condition and Education of Poor Children in English and in German Towns&quot; (Manchester, 1853). He was also the author of &quot;The Law relating to Shipmasters and Seamen&quot; (London, 1875) and &quot;Free Trade in Land&quot; (1879, with a memoir).

In 1863 Joseph married Mary Drummond, daughter of Maria Drummond and Thomas Drummond, his marriage lasting fifteen years until his eventual death at Fredley, near Dorking, Surrey in 1878.

<text>Plum Island is an island in the town of Southold in Suffolk County, New York. The island is situated in Gardiners Bay, east of Orient Point, off the eastern end of the North Fork coast of Long Island. It is about long and wide at its widest point.

Plum Island is the site of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), which was established by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1954. The Island is also the site of the former U.S. military installation Fort Terry (c. 1897), and the historic Plum Island Light (c. 1869), and its automated replacement.

Plum Island is owned in its entirety by the United States government, which was considering sale of the island, but suspended the plan in February 2012. Access to the island is controlled by the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

On August 29, 2013, the United States General Services Administration (GSA) and United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a final &quot;Record of Decision (ROD): Public Sale of Plum Island, New York&quot;.

After years of pressure from organizations including the Preserve Plum Island Coalition (PPIC), the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, along with its permanent regional program Save the Sound and Soundkeeper, Inc., Congress voted in December 2020 to block the sale and preserve Plum Island. In 2020, President Donald Trump signed the legislation.

==Geology==
The northern portion of Plum Island is a recessional moraine deposit, part of the Harbor Hill-Roanoke Point-Fishers Island-Charlestown Moraine, and thus is one of the Outer Lands. Boulders in the moraine can be seen in the eroding northern slope of the island.

==History==
Plum Island was called &quot;Manittuwond&quot; by the Native American Pequot Nation. It was probably first seen by Europeans in 1614 when Adriaen Block, a Dutchman employed by the Dutch West India Company, charted the area. The island was named from the beach plums that grow along the shores, and an old Dutch map made about 1640 shows the name &quot;Pruym Eyelant&quot; (Plum Island). In 1659, the island was purchased by Samuel Wyllys III (Samuel Willis III), son of the Governor of Connecticut, from Wyandanch, the ruling local Indian Chieftain of Long Island, for a coat, a barrel of biscuits and 100 fishhooks.

On August 11, 1775, American General David Wooster dispatched 120 soldiers to the island, then known as Plumb Island, who were immediately fired upon by the British. After firing a single return volley, the soldiers retreated back to Long Island. Although no casualties were reported, this brief skirmish is believed to have represented at least one American military &quot;first&quot;: the first amphibious assault by an American army.

The historic Plum Island Lighthouse is located at the west end of the island. The original lighthouse on Plum Island was constructed in 1827; the current structure was built in 1869. The light marks the east side of &quot;Plum Gut&quot;, a mile-wide entrance to Long Island Sound with extremely strong tidal currents. The light aided navigation near the entrance to Long Island Sound, especially through the &quot;Plum Gut&quot; channel between Orient Point and Plum Island.

After passing through the possession of more than 20 families, in 1899, the island was purchased in its entirety by the United States government following the Spanish–American War for approximately $90,000. The U.S. Army established a Coast Artillery post, later known as Fort Terry on the island in 1897. The fort was activated as an anti-submarine base during World War II. Deactivated after the war, the fort was subsequently reactivated and assigned to the Army Chemical Corps.

In 1954, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) established the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC). The center conducts research on animal pathogens to protect farmers, ranchers, and the national food supply. Because of the nature of the research, access to the island and the research facility is restricted.

In 2003, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assumed ownership of the island and all its facilities. The USDA continues its long running science mission at PIADC jointly with DHS, who are charged with the safe and secure operation of the facility.

As one result of the heightened national security initiatives following the 9/11 attacks, Plum Island was considered as a potential site for a new high-security animal diseases lab, National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). In September 2008, the U.S. Congress passed H.R. 2638 (Sec. 540 - New York) that directed the General Services Administration (GSA) to close the PIADC, sell the island to the public, and to use the proceeds towards the construction of the NBAF, if it were decided that NBAF would be built elsewhere. In January 2009, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) selected the City of Manhattan, Kansas, as the site for the NBAF, and decided to relocate the PIADC there as well. However, the decline in real estate values stemming from the subprime mortgage crisis and late-2000s recession caused the sale of the island to be considered no longer viable. Because the proceeds from selling the island were needed to construct the new facility in Kansas, the project was effectively cancelled for the short term when the 2013 federal budget request contained no funding for the new facility. As part of the planned sale of Plum Island, the United States Government prepared an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the island, one objective of which is to determine whether the impact of nearly sixty years of animal testing on the island constituted a threat to public health that could preclude the planned sale.

In 2008, the U.S. Congress passed, and U.S. President George W. Bush signed H.R. 2638, part of the , which required that Plum Island and the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) be sold to help fund the new National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Manhattan, Kansas. This legislation started the process that would have had all of Plum Island sold to a private party.

A regional environmental group, Save the Sound, led the legal aspects of the movement to preserve Plum Island including the repeal of H.R. 2638. In addition, a coalition of conservation, environmental, and civic, organizations formed the Preserve Plum Island Coalition (PPIC) The PPIC advocates a plan for its designation as a National Wildlife Refuge or other protected area. The proposal provides for guided public access to the historic district and a trail area while nature preserve areas at the south and east would be restricted to student and research access.

On July 16, 2013, former U.S. Congressman Tim Bishop (First Congressional District of New York) introduced a new bipartisan bill (&#x27;Save, Don&#x27;t Sell Plum Island&#x27;). This goal of this bill was to preserve critical biodiversity, and prevent further development, on Plum Island, by eliminating H.R. 2638&#x27;s provision that all of Plum Island be sold at public auction to fund a new NBAF in Manhattan, Kansas. Similar legislation was also introduced in the U.S. Senate at the same time as that in the U.S. House of Representatives.

On August 29, 2013, the USDA and DHS announced a final Record of Decision (ROD) which determined that the entirety of Plum Island was to be sold to the private sector to help offset the cost of constructing the replacement facility. On September 30, 2013, New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo sent a letter to the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and United States General Services Administration (GSA), calling for both agencies to submit to a consent order requiring them to present a comprehensive environmental cleanup plan for Plum Island, in Suffolk County, New York, and giving New York State final review of the Island&#x27;s conditions before it would be put up for sale.

On January 5, 2015, the Connecticut Fund For the Environment (CFE) &amp; Save The Sound jointly sent a letter to the U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), indicating a 60-Day &quot;Notice of Intent to Sue&quot; these agencies. This letter outlined how the sale of Plum Island, under the terms of H.R. 2638, was in violation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

On April 1, 2015, New York and Connecticut Senators Senators Schumer, Gillibrand, Blumenthal and Murphy, sent a letter to the Appropriation Committee asking for the repeal of H.R. 2638. The senators explained that the original financial reasoning to sell Plum Island was no longer valid, and that it was in the best interest of the country to conserve Plum Island.

Congress voted on December 21, 2020, to block the planned sale and preserve the island. The policy was a provision of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, an omnibus spending and stimulus bill. Under the bill, the Department of Homeland Security must offer the island for transfer to other federal agencies such as the Fish and Wildlife Service. If no federal agency wants to take control, the department must offer the island to state and local government agencies. The legislation also would give Homeland Security $18.9 million to clean contamination on the island. The provision was based on legislation first introduced in 2015 by Representative Lee Zeldin, whose district includes Plum Island.

The overall bill had overwhelming support by both political parties. On December 27, 2020, President Donald Trump signed the legislation.

<doc id="736330" wikidata="Q1474555" url="?curid=736330" title="Henry Cow">
<text>Henry Cow were an English experimental rock group, founded at the University of Cambridge in 1968 by multi-instrumentalists Fred Frith and Tim Hodgkinson. Henry Cow&#x27;s personnel fluctuated over their decade together, but drummer Chris Cutler, bassist John Greaves, and bassoonist/oboist Lindsay Cooper were important long-term members alongside Frith and Hodgkinson.

An inherent anti-commercial attitude kept them at arm&#x27;s length from the mainstream music business, enabling them to experiment at will. Critic Myles Boisen writes, &quot;[their sound] was so mercurial and daring that they had few imitators, even though they inspired many on both sides of the Atlantic with a blend of spontaneity, intricate structures, philosophy, and humor that has endured and transcended the &#x27;progressive&#x27; tag.&quot;

While it was generally thought that Henry Cow took their name from 20th-century American composer Henry Cowell, this has been repeatedly denied by band members. According to Hodgkinson, the name &quot;Henry Cow&quot; was &quot;in the air&quot; in 1968, and it seemed like a good name for the band. It had no connection to anything. In a 1974 interview, Cutler said the name was chosen because &quot;[i]t&#x27;s silly. What could be sillier than Henry Cow?&quot;

==History==
===Early years===
Fred Frith met Tim Hodgkinson, a fellow student, in a blues club at Cambridge University in May 1968. Recognising their mutual open-minded approach to music, the two began performing together, playing a variety of musical styles including &quot;dada blues&quot; and &quot;neo-Hiroshima&quot;. One of Henry Cow&#x27;s first concerts was supporting Pink Floyd at the Architects&#x27; Ball at Homerton College, Cambridge, on 12 June 1968.

In October 1968, Henry Cow expanded when they were joined by Andy Powell (bass guitar), David Attwooll (drums) and Rob Brooks (rhythm guitar). They performed with this line-up until December that year, when Frith, Hodgkinson and Powell split off from the rest of the group and became a trio. Powell at the time was studying music at King&#x27;s College under Roger Smalley, the resident composer. Smalley was influential in Henry Cow&#x27;s early development. He exposed them to a variety of new music from bands and musicians like Soft Machine, Captain Beefheart and Frank Zappa. Smalley also introduced them to the idea of writing long and complex musical pieces for rock groups. It was at this time that Henry Cow began writing music to challenge their collective ability to play, then using it to improve on themselves.

As a trio, with Frith on bass guitar, Powell on drums and Hodgkinson playing an organ that Frith and Powell had persuaded him to learn, Henry Cow performed a number of gigs on the university calendar, including the annual Architects&#x27; Ball and the Midsummer Common Festival, as well as a performance on the roof of a 14-storey building in Cambridge. In April 1969, Powell left and the band reverted to a duo, with Frith playing violin and Hodgkinson on keyboards and reeds. In October 1969 philosopher Galen Strawson auditioned for the band. Later, Frith and Hodgkinson persuaded bassist John Greaves to join the band, and with the services of a couple of temporary drummers and then Sean Jenkins, Henry Cow performed as a quartet for the next eight months. In May 1971, Martin Ditcham replaced Jenkins on drums, and with this line-up they played at several events, including the Glastonbury Festival alongside Gong in June 1971.

Ditcham left in July 1971, and it was not until September that year that the drummer&#x27;s seat was filled again, this time by Chris Cutler. Responding to one of Cutler&#x27;s adverts in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, the band invited him to a rehearsal, and it was only when Cutler joined that Henry Cow settled into a permanent core of Frith, Hodgkinson, Cutler and Greaves. The band then relocated to London, where they began an aggressive rehearsal schedule.

After having entered John Peel&#x27;s &quot;Rockortunity Knocks&quot; contest in 1971, Henry Cow recorded a John Peel session for BBC Radio 1 in February 1972. They later went on to record another session in October that year and a further three sessions between 1973 and 1975.

In April 1972, Henry Cow wrote and performed the music for Robert Walker&#x27;s production of Euripides&#x27; &quot;The Bacchae&quot;. This involved an intense and demanding three-week period of concentrated work that changed the band completely. It was during this time that Geoff Leigh on woodwinds joined and Henry Cow became a quintet.

In July 1972, the band performed at the Edinburgh Festival, and wrote and performed music for a ballet with artist Ray Smith and the Cambridge Contemporary Dance Group at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Smith appeared with Henry Cow at several of their early 1970s performances, to &quot;add a dimension to the whole experience&quot;. Smith&#x27;s acts included &quot;set[ting] up an ironing board stage left and spen[ding] the whole evening ... quietly ironing&quot; at the Rainbow Theatre, &quot;read[ing] out short passages of discontinuous text between each piece of music&quot; at the Hammersmith Palais, and miming with a glove puppet at the New London Theatre. Smith later went on to do the &quot;paint sock&quot; art work for three of Henry Cow&#x27;s LP covers.

Back in London, they started to organise a series of concerts and events under the names Cabaret Voltaire and Explorers&#x27; Club at the Kensington Town Hall and the London School of Economics respectively. Invited guests included Derek Bailey, Lol Coxhill, Ivor Cutler, Ron Geesin, David Toop, Lady June and Smith. Improvisers Bailey and Coxhill became &quot;enthusiastic supporters&quot; of Henry Cow and attended many of their concerts; Frith later stated that he was &quot;strongly affected by their critical engagement and encouragement&quot;. For the first time the band started getting some attention from the national music press. Reviewing the first Cabaret Voltaire event with Kevin Ayers in October 1972 in &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, Ian MacDonald described Henry Cow as &quot;one of the most resilient and obstinate of that range of groups normally ignored by the popular music press&quot;. This exposure, and a John Peel recording session in April 1973, led to the band signing with Virgin Records in May 1973.

===Unrest===
Within two weeks of signing the contract, Henry Cow began recording their debut album &quot;Legend&quot; (also known as &quot;Leg End&quot;) at Virgin&#x27;s Manor Studios in Oxfordshire. It took three weeks of hard work, but at the end they were able to handle the studio themselves, which would prove to be invaluable later in their career. The track &quot;Nine Funerals of the Citizen King&quot;, sung by the whole group, was Henry Cow&#x27;s first overtly political statement.

To promote its new signing, Virgin organised a UK tour for Henry Cow and Faust, who had also just signed to the label. During this tour, Henry Cow began preparing music for an unorthodox and provocative play, based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Some of this music was used on their next record &quot;Unrest&quot;. In November 1973, members of the band participated in a live-in-the-studio performance of Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; for the BBC, which was later released on the 2004 DVD edition of Oldfield&#x27;s video compilation, &quot;Elements&quot;.

During a tour of the Netherlands in December 1973, Geoff Leigh left the group. Looking for more unusual instruments to draw them further away from rock and jazz, Henry Cow asked classically trained Lindsay Cooper (oboe, bassoon) to join. In early 1974 the group 
began recording &quot;Unrest&quot; at The Manor. Having only enough prepared material to fill one side of the LP, they developed a studio composition process that produced the second side.

In May 1974, Henry Cow were on tour again around England and Europe with Captain Beefheart. It was during this tour that they realised they were becoming a conventional rock band, playing the same material night after night. Their music was no longer a challenge and they were becoming complacent. After some serious deliberating, they asked Cooper to leave and fulfilled their last outstanding concert obligations (a tour of the Netherlands) as a quartet. Without Cooper they were forced to abandon much of their learned material and worked on a 35–40 minute piece Hodgkinson had written that later became the politically charged &quot;Living in the Heart of the Beast&quot; on their third album, &quot;In Praise of Learning&quot;.

In November 1974, avant-pop group Slapp Happy (Anthony Moore, Peter Blegvad, Dagmar Krause) invited Henry Cow to record with them on their second album for Virgin. The result was &quot;Desperate Straights&quot;, an almost entirely Slapp Happy-composed album that surprised critics, considering how dissimilar the two groups were. The success of this venture prompted a merger of the two bands, and in early 1975 they recorded &quot;In Praise of Learning&quot; at The Manor. The merger ended in April 1975 when Moore and Blegvad left. Krause remained with Henry Cow, which effectively spelled the end of Slapp Happy.

Having made guest appearances on both the Henry Cow/Slapp Happy albums, Cooper rejoined in April 1975 and Henry Cow became a sextet. In May 1975 they embarked on a concert tour with Robert Wyatt in England, France and Italy to launch &quot;In Praise of Learning&quot; and Wyatt&#x27;s new album, &quot;Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard&quot;. This was followed by a period of almost constant touring across Western Europe that continued until Henry Cow disbanded in 1978.

===Europe===
Henry Cow&#x27;s music was challenging and uncompromising and this often led to them being accused of deliberately making it unapproachable. In a review of &quot;Unrest&quot; in &quot;New Musical Express&quot; on 15 June 1974, Neil Spencer called the band &quot;determinedly inaccessible&quot;. As a result, Henry Cow were virtually ignored in their own country. Virgin Records too, having started dropping experimental groups in favour of commercial ones, now showed little to no interest in the band. The group continuously considered whether to continue or not; there certainly were no economic inducements. Cutler said, &quot;We had to make what amounted to political decisions about the organization of the group and its relation to the commercial structures, and this was bound to be reflected in the music too.&quot; Henry Cow&#x27;s anti-capitalist stance was brought on partly out of necessity rather than choice. They began working outside the music industry and did everything for themselves. They abandoned agencies and managers and stopped looking for approval from the music press. Henry Cow quickly became self-sufficient and self-reliant.

Virtual exiles from their own country, they made mainland Europe their second home where they (and their music) were well received. After a concert in Rome in July 1975, Henry Cow remained behind with their truck/bus/mobile home and began meeting local musicians, including progressive rock band Stormy Six, and the PCI (Italian Communist Party). The PCI offered them concerts at Festa de L&#x27;Unità (large open-air fairs that run every summer all over Italy), and they joined Stormy Six&#x27;s L&#x27;Orchestra, a musicians&#x27; co-operative in Milan. Each contact they made led to more contacts and soon doors opened for Henry Cow all over Europe.

While rehearsing for an upcoming tour of Scandinavia in March 1976, John Greaves left the band to start working on the &quot;Kew. Rhone.&quot; project with Peter Blegvad, and Dagmar Krause withdrew due to ill health. Committed to the tour, Henry Cow had to perform as a quartet (Hodgkinson, Frith, Cooper and Cutler) and adjust their music accordingly. They took the radical option and abandoned composed material completely in favour of pure improvisation.

In May 1976, Henry Cow compiled a double LP &quot;Concerts&quot; for a new Norwegian underground label Compendium (re-released later on the budget Virgin sub-label Caroline). For the first time, they did everything themselves: the mastering, cover design, cutting, pressing and manufacturing. The album included an excerpt from one of several concerts performed with guest artist Robert Wyatt in 1975.

Henry Cow began auditioning for a bass player and found Georgie Born, a classically trained cellist and improviser. Even though she had never played bass guitar before, she joined the band in June 1976 and tuned her bass in 5ths like a cello with a lower C. In the interim, the band&#x27;s compositions, including a new Hodgkinson epic with the working title of &quot;Erk Gah&quot;, grew more complex.

Henry Cow returned to London in early 1977, where they merged with the entire Mike Westbrook Brass Band and folk singer Frankie Armstrong to form the Orckestra. They played their first concert at the Moving Left Revue at The Roundhouse in London and then at the Open Air Theatre in Regent&#x27;s Park. The Orckestra later went on to tour in France, Italy and Scandinavia (extracts from some of these performances were released in 2006 on a CD-single included in the &quot;Henry Cow Box&quot;). At more or less the same time they set up Music for Socialism and its May Festival. It had been three years since Henry Cow had performed more than one concert a year in their own country. In an attempt to break the apathy that seemed to be discouraging anyone from wanting to put them on, they tried to organise a small alternative tour themselves, but abandoned it after 11 concerts when they started losing money: clearly nothing had changed.

Their contract with Virgin Records had now become a burden to both Henry Cow and Virgin: none of Henry Cow&#x27;s records were licensed or distributed in the countries in which they spent all their time playing, and Henry Cow were not making any money for Virgin. Henry Cow needed to record again but Virgin refused to give them studio time at The Manor. When Henry Cow referred to the contract (&quot;one month at a first class studio&quot;), Virgin Records (in October 1977) agreed to cancel it.

By now, Krause&#x27;s health had deteriorated to such an extent that touring became impossible for her and she decided to leave the group, although she agreed to sing on Henry Cow&#x27;s next album. The recording of this album was to begin at Sunrise studios in Kirchberg, Switzerland in January 1978. However, a group meeting one week before threw into question the material planned for it, the aforementioned &quot;Erk Gah&quot; in particular. Cutler and Frith hurriedly wrote a set of songs which, along with some of the planned material, were duly recorded. On returning to London, another meeting was convened to question the predominance of songs on the album. The group agreed that the songs would be released separately by Cutler and Frith, while the instrumentals would be released later by Henry Cow. This decision, however, spelled the end of the band. Cutler, Frith and Krause released the songs, with four extra tracks recorded at David Vorhaus&#x27;s Kaleidophon Studio in London, as &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; under the name Art Bears, crediting the rest of Henry Cow as guests. Later that year Henry Cow returned to Sunrise, by then without Dagmar Krause and Georgie Born, to record their last album, &quot;Western Culture&quot;, an instrumental. Annemarie Roelofs had joined the band two months before the split and plays on the album as well.

===Rock in Opposition===

Henry Cow agreed to disband as a permanent group, but did not announce the fact immediately. They continued for another six months, creating a new set of material (recorded later to complete &quot;Western Culture&quot;) and revisited for the last time all the places that had supported them over the years.

In March 1978, Henry Cow invited four European groups, Stormy Six (Italy), Samla Mammas Manna (Sweden), Univers Zero (Belgium) and Etron Fou Leloublan (France), to come to London and perform in a festival Henry Cow had organised called Rock in Opposition, or RIO. Throughout Europe, Henry Cow had encountered many &quot;progressive&quot; groups refusing to bow to the hegemony of American and British rock music. Instead they drew on non-American music sources, such as local folk music and 20th century &quot;classical&quot; or &quot;art music&quot;, and often sang in their own languages. As was the case with Henry Cow, these groups struggled to survive: record companies were not interested in their music. Although these groups and Henry Cow were musically diverse, what they had in common was: (1) their independence and opposition to the established Rock business; and (2) a determination to pursue their own work regardless.

After the festival, RIO was formalised as an organisation with a charter whose aim was to represent and promote its members. RIO thus became a collective of bands united in their opposition to the music industry and the pressures to compromise their music.

Henry Cow&#x27;s last concert was held in Milan on 25 July 1978. A final performance scheduled at the Annual World Youth Festival in Cuba never materialised. In August they returned to the Sunrise studios to complete &quot;Western Culture&quot;, after which the band officially announced their break-up in the press, stating that &quot;… although the group as a commodity, as a name, ceases to exist the work of the group will go on …&quot;

&quot;Western Culture&quot; was released on Henry Cow&#x27;s own Broadcast label. Shortly afterward, Chris Cutler launched Recommended Records, his own independent label and non-commercial record distribution network.

A partial Henry Cow reunion occurred in 1993 when Hodgkinson, Cutler, Cooper and Krause came together to record &quot;Hold to the Zero Burn, Imagine&quot; for Hodgkinson&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Each in Our Own Thoughts&quot;. The song was formerly known as &quot;Erk Gah&quot; and composed by Hodgkinson for, and performed by, Henry Cow. When asked in 1998 about a possible Henry Cow reunion concert, Frith replied, &quot;Forget it! We&#x27;re all much too busy.&quot; In December 2006, Cutler, Frith and Hodgkinson performed together at The Stone in New York City, only their second concert performance since Henry Cow broke up in 1978. The first was in London in 1986. Frith and Hodgkinson also performed improvised duo concerts in 1990. Extracts of the concerts were released in 1992 as &quot;Live Improvisations&quot;.

Cooper died in September 2013; In June 2014, it was announced that there would be a Henry Cow reunion as part of two concerts celebrating her life and works. The band, including Henry Cow members Chris Cutler, Fred Frith, John Greaves, Tim Hodgkinson, Annemarie Roelofs and Dagmar Krause, performed a set of Cooper&#x27;s compositions in Henry Cow, then in News from Babel, Music for Films and Oh Moscow. The Henry Cow set featured Cutler, Frith, Greaves, Hodgkinson, Roelofs, Michel Berckmans, Alfred Harth and, on one piece, Veryan Weston and Zeena Parkins; Krause performed later in the evening, but not on the Henry Cow set. The concerts were performed at the Barbican Centre, London on 21 November 2014, as part of the EFG London Jazz Festival, and at the Lawrence Batley Theatre, Huddersfield as part of the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, on 22 November 2014. A third remembrance concert for Cooper featuring the same line-up above was held in Forlì, Italy on 23 November 2014.

In a review of the Barbican concert on 21 November, Dom Lawson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;a fitting salute to Cooper&#x27;s life&quot;, adding &quot;what tonight’s experience never becomes is self‑indulgent: there’s a sharpness to the intricate arrangements as very obvious waves of passion and commitment from everyone on stage flow and spread across the auditorium.&quot;

In May 2019, the with John Greaves released &quot;Echoes of Henry Cow&quot;, an album of variations on Henry Cow compositions and other music. Aymeric Leroy wrote in the liner notes that it should not be seen as a Henry Cow tribute album, but rather &quot;echoes (much transformed during its long journey through time, space, memory and the mysterious twists and turns of the creative process) in [Edelin&#x27;s] own musical inner world&quot;.

In September 2019, American historian of experimental music and an associate professor of music at Cornell University, Benjamin Piekut published &quot;Henry Cow: The World Is a Problem&quot;, a detailed biography and analysis of the band from their inception in 1968 to their demise in 1978.
On 18 November 2022, Greaves, Frith, Hodgkinson and Cutler reunited for concerts in Piacenza, Italy, under the moniker of Henry Now with Italian friend guesting. The same line-up played two gigs in the Czech Republic in November 2023. In January 2024 Henry Now performed in Barcelona with a line-up of Cutler, Frith, Hodgkinson and Annemarie Roelofs.

==Music==
Henry Cow&#x27;s music included elaborately scored pieces (often with complex time signatures), tape loops and manipulations, &quot;flat-out free improvisation&quot; and songs. It incorporated elements of jazz, rock, contemporary classical music and the avant-garde. Dagmar Krause&#x27;s vocals added another dimension to their sound, giving it a dramatic, almost Brechtian flair. Music journalists at the time often underestimated the formal compositional element of their music, while others simply dismissed it as being &quot;inaccessible&quot;.

John Kelman wrote at &quot;All About Jazz&quot; that &quot;Henry Cow represented a new kind of classical chamber music; one where spontaneity was a partial component, and the instrumentation used created textures that defied those looking for tradition and convention.&quot; Edward Macan in his 1997 book &quot;Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture&quot; described Henry Cow&#x27;s music as &quot;highly eclectic&quot; and said that their pieces often included &quot;furious atonal instrumental passages with no discernable melodic contour or key center, impossibly complex shifting meters alternating with freely ametric sections with no definable beat or regular recurring rhythms, and jagged, &quot;sprechstimme&quot;-like vocal lines that blur the line between song and speech.&quot;

Trond Einar Garmo described Henry Cow&#x27;s music as avant-garde rock. Writing in his book, &quot;Henry Cow: An Analysis of Avant Garde Rock&quot; (2020), Garmo stated:
I have chosen to use the term &#x27;avant-garde rock&#x27; for Henry Cow&#x27;s music. The word &#x27;avant-garde&#x27; is usually associated with art that is &#x27;difficult&#x27;, &#x27;incomprehensible&#x27;, and to some extent &#x27;meaningless&#x27;. The actual meaning of the word, however, is &#x27;vanguard&#x27;. Avant-garde artists are, therefore, artists who find new directions and expand the boundaries of the art form in which they operate. And it is in this sense that I have used the word. Avant-garde rock represents the most experimental and radical trends within rock.

Henry Cow&#x27;s music was challenging, not only to the listener, but also to the band themselves. They often composed pieces to challenge their own capabilities. Some of their music was scored beyond the conventional ranges of their instruments, necessitating that they &quot;reinvent their instruments&quot; and learn how to play them in completely new ways. Frith explained in a 1973 interview, &quot;What we&#x27;ve done is to literally teach ourselves to ... compos[e] music which we could not initially, play. Because of that attitude, we can go on forever. It&#x27;s a self-generative concept which gives us a sense of purpose most groups simply don&#x27;t have.&quot; And yet their music may not have been as good as it could have been. Henry Cow conducted their affairs as a collective and all decisions, including those related to their music, had to be approved by the group. Cutler said at a conference on &quot;Composition and Experimentation in British Rock 1967–1976&quot; in Italy in 2005 that Henry Cow had a rule that &quot;the composer no longer owned the composition once the band had started to work on it.&quot; In a 1998 interview Frith said that this may have led to much of Henry Cow&#x27;s material being &quot;watered down&quot; rather than strengthened. He felt that &quot;this ... was a big mistake, and a lot of our best ideas may not have been fully realised as a result of it.&quot; Cutler wrote that when Art Bears was formed in 1978, he and Frith decided there would be &quot;no discussions; if someone had an idea, they put it to tape. Then we&#x27;d listen and it would be immediately clear if it worked, didn&#x27;t work or could work if pursued.&quot;

Henry Cow were largely a live band, yet of the original six albums they made, only one, &quot;Concerts&quot; gave a glimpse of their live performances. In January 2009 Recommended Records released &quot;The 40th Anniversary Henry Cow Box Set&quot;, a nine-CD plus one-DVD collection of over 10 hours of previously unreleased and mostly live recordings made between 1972 and 1978, over four hours of which was improvised. This offered, &quot;for the first time,&quot; according to Kelman, &quot;a comprehensive account of Henry Cow&#x27;s breadth and depth.&quot;

===Timeline===
Notes: before Sean Jenkins joined, the band auditioned several other drummers. According to Fred Frith, between 1969 and 1971, the band played more as a trio than with a drummer. From November 1974 to April 1975, Henry Cow merged with Slapp Happy to form one group. The band&#x27;s final studio album, &quot;Western Culture&quot;, was released in 1979 after the group had split up.

<doc id="736331" wikidata="Q1046397" url="?curid=736331" title="Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra">
<text>The Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra (, &quot; of Queen Śrīmālā&quot;) is one of the main early Mahāyāna Buddhist texts belonging to the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras that teaches the doctrines of Buddha-nature and &quot;One Vehicle&quot; through the words of the Indian queen Śrīmālā. After its composition, this text became the primary scriptural advocate in India for the universal potentiality of Buddhahood.

==History==
Brian Edward Brown, a specialist in Buddha-nature doctrines, writes that the composition of the &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot; occurred during the Īkṣvāku Dynasty in the 3rd century CE as a product of the Caitika schools of the Mahāsāṃghikas. Alex Wayman has outlined eleven points of complete agreement between the Mahāsāṃghikas and the &quot;Śrīmālā&quot;, along with four major arguments for this association. Anthony Barber also associates the earlier development of the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra&quot; with the Mahāsāṃghikas, and concludes that the Mahāsāṃghikas of the Āndhra region were responsible for the inception of the Buddha-nature doctrine. In the 6th century CE, Paramārtha wrote that the Mahāsāṃghikas revere the sūtras that teach the Buddha-nature doctrine.

==Translations==
The &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot; was translated to Chinese in 436 CE by Guṇabhadra (394-468) and later by Bodhiruci (672-727). A complete Sanskrit original is no longer extant, but extensive quotations are found in the Sanskrit text of the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; as well as some recently discovered fragments conserved in the Schøyen Collection. It was later translated into English by Alex and Hideko Wayman as &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Roar of Queen Srimala&quot;.

==Content==
The &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot; teaches the reality of an ultimate, immaculate consciousness within each living being, which is the Buddhic &quot;Dharmakāya&quot; (essence of Truth), which is yet temporarily sheathed in obscuring defilement. This Dharmakāya, when viewed as intrinsically free from spiritual ignorance, is said to constitute eternity, bliss, the self, and purity in their perfect state. The use of the word &quot;self&quot; in this sutra is in a way unique to this class of sutra. The great Queen Śrīmālā, who according to this text is empowered by the Buddha to teach the Dharma, affirms:

The scripture, which was extremely influential by way of clarification of the Tathagātagarbha view of Śūnyatā, insists that the ultimately correct understanding of emptiness is that the Tathāgatagarbha is empty of all knowledge that is not liberation, whereas, in contrast, the qualities which characterise a Buddha are not empty of inconceivable virtues. An alternative title offered by the Buddha for this sutra expresses this idea of an ultimate meaning to the emptiness doctrine: &quot;The True Revelation of the Buddha&#x27;s Intention when Teaching Emptiness.&quot;

The sūtra has, furthermore, significantly contributed to the Mahāyāna notion of the permanent, steadfast and eternal Tathagātagarbha, which is nothing less than the perfect Dharmakāya temporarily concealed by (ultimately unreal) mental contaminants:

<text>The Maricopa or Piipaash are a Native American tribe, who live in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community and Gila River Indian Community (both in Arizona) along with the Pima, a tribe with whom the Maricopa have long held a positive relationship. The Maricopa at the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community consist mostly of Xalychidom Piipaash members and are concentrated in Lehi. The Maricopa at the Gila River Indian Community are concentrated in Maricopa Colony. The Maricopa are a River Yuman group, formerly living along the banks of the Colorado River.

== Names ==
The neighboring Akimel O&#x27;odham (Pima) and future allies, called these people the Kokmalik&#x27;op (&#x27;enemies in the big mountains&#x27;). The Spanish transliterated this to Maricopa. They call themselves Piipaa, Piipaash or Pee-Posh (″people″). 

The &quot;Maricopa&quot; of the American explorers of the 19th century at this time consisted of descendants of five (possibly six) originally independent River Yuma tribes (see Spier, 1933: 1-41): the &quot;Maricopa/Piipaash&quot;-speaking original &quot;Piipaash&quot; together with the &quot;Halchidhoma&quot;, &quot;Kavelchadom&quot; and &quot;Opa/Piipaa Nyaa&quot; as well as the &quot;Delta Yuma/Cocopa&quot;-speaking &quot;Halyikwamai&quot; and &quot;Kohuana/Kahwan&quot;.

Since in the 19th century the two originally &quot;Delta Yuma/Cocopa&quot;-speaking &quot;Halyikwamai&quot; and &quot;Kohuana/Kahwan&quot; lived together with four &quot;Maricopa/Piipaash&quot;-speaking &quot;Piipaash&quot;, &quot;Halchidhoma&quot;, &quot;Kavelchadom&quot; and &quot;Opa/Piipaa Nyaa&quot; along the Gila and Salt Rivers in several villages for mutual protection, these river Yuma groups and their languages/dialects used to be mistakenly referred to by Spaniards and Mexicans as &quot;Cocomaricopa&quot; and &quot;Opa&quot; respectively.

Only the descendants of the &quot;Piipaash&quot; and &quot;Halchidhoma&quot; (&quot;Xalychidom Piipaa / Xalychidom Piipaash&quot; - ″people who live toward the water″) were able to preserve their own tribal identity and refer to themselves in English as &quot;Maricopa&quot; or &quot;Maricopa of Lehi&quot;, the descendants of the other three (possibly four) River Yuma tribes, which found shelter on the Gila River and Salt River under the &quot;Piipaash&quot; in the 19th century - the &quot;Kavelchadom&quot; (&quot;Kavelchadom Piipaash / Kavelchidom Piipaash&quot; - &quot;downstream person/people&quot;, &quot;river people in the west&quot;), &quot;Opa/Piipaa Nyaa&quot; (&quot;Piipaa Nyaa / Thxpaa Nyaa&quot; - &quot;eastern people&quot;), &quot;Halyikwamai&quot; (&quot;Xalykawaam&quot;) and &quot;Kohuana/Kahwan&quot; (&quot;Kaxwaan&quot; - &quot;river people&quot;) – however, have not been able to preserve their own language as well as their separate identity and now generally identify themselves as &quot;Maricopa&quot;.

==History==

They formerly consisted of small groups of people who lived for generations along the banks of the Colorado River. In the 16th century, they migrated to the area around the Gila River, to avoid attacks by the Quechan and Mojave peoples. 

During the 1840s, epidemics of new infectious diseases took a toll on the tribe.

In 1825 a party of American trappers, James Ohio Pattie among them, massacred a group of 200 Maricopa in revenge for an earlier attack.

In the 19th century, the Maricopa formed a confederation with the Pima, and in 1857 they successfully defeated the Quechan and Mojave at the Battle of Pima Butte near Maricopa Wells. They became successful farmers, and in 1870, they produced three million pounds of wheat. Drought and water diversion by non-Indians brought widespread crop failures.

In the 19th and the 20th centuries, the Bureau of Indian Affairs implemented policies to try to assimilate the Maricopa into mainstream European-American society, and they brought Presbyterian missionaries into the communities. In 1914, the US federal government broke up communal tribal landholdings for distribution as individual allotments in order to encourage subsistence farming according to the European-American model. It was not appropriate for the geography and climate here. The Pima Advisory Council was formed by the BIA in 1926 to speak on behalf of the Pima and Maricopa communities. Following congressional passage of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, in 1936 the Pima and Maricopa agreed on a constitution to restore some measure of self-governance.

Through the 1930s, surface flow on the Gila River was reduced to nothing, and the tribe suffered greatly due to the loss of their river. But the BIA ignored water issues. The tribe resorted to using brackish well water, but it would not support growing edible crops. They began to cultivate cotton as a commodity crop.

==Language==
Their heritage language are/were dialects of the Maricopa and Cocopah language, which belong to the Yuman language family.

==Arts==

The Maricopa are known for their basket weaving and textiles, in particular, for their highly burnished red-on-redware pottery. Their traditional pottery practices enjoyed a revival from 1937 to 1940. Elizabeth Hart, a US Home Extension Agent, worked with a leading Maricopa potter, Ida Redbird, to form the Maricopa Pottery Cooperative. Redbird served as president of the cooperative, which had 17 to 19 master potters. Hart encouraged members to sign their work. Swastikas were a common traditional motif that was abandoned in the 1940s, due to the Nazi usurpation of the symbol. The paddle and anvil method of construction is used, and, while utilitarian cookware is tempered, decorative Maricopa pottery has no temper.

==Notable Maricopa==
* Ida Redbird (1892–1971) – Master potter of the Maricopa; instrumental in the 1937–1940 Maricopa pottery revival; first president of Maricopa Pottery Makers Association; translator and informant for Leslie Spier&#x27;s Yuma Tribes of the Gila River, thus helping to preserve her American Indian heritage.
* Robert &quot;Tree&quot; Cody – flutist. He is also an enrolled member of the Hunkpapa tribe.

<text>Pika Peak is a mountain located between Mount Richardson and Ptarmigan Peak in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada The mountain was named in 1928 after the pika, the small &quot;rock rabbit&quot; that inhabits alpine regions.

The Lake Louise Mountain Resort is developed on the southern slopes of the Merlin Ridge, which includes Mount Richardson, Ptarmigan Peak and Pika Peak. A campground is located at the foot of the mountain, near Hidden Lake.

The first ascent was made in 1911 by L.L. Delafield and L.M. Earle, who were guided by Rudolph Aemmer and Edward Feuz jr.

== Routes ==
The scrambling route via the Richardson-Pika col and the west ridge is rated difficult. Either gain the col by ascending Mt. Richardson (easy scramble) or by attacking the lower flanks of Pika Peak above Hidden Lake.

<text>Ferenc Kazinczy (), (in older English: Francis Kazinczy, October 27, 1759 – August 23, 1831) was a Hungarian author, poet, translator, neologist, an agent in the regeneration of the Hungarian language and literature at the turn of the 19th century. Today his name is connected with the extensive Language Reform of the 19th century, when thousands of words were coined or revived, enabling the Hungarian language to keep up with scientific progress and become an official language of the nation in 1844. For his linguistic and literary works he is regarded as one of the cultural founders of the Hungarian Reform Era along with Dávid Baróti Szabó, Ferenc Verseghy, György Bessenyei, Mátyás Rát and János Kis.

==Life==
===Early years===
Ferenc Kazinczy was born in Érsemjén, Bihar, Kingdom of Hungary (today Șimian, Romania). His father, József Kazinczy de Kazincz (1732-1784) came from an old noble family and worked as a magistrate at Abaúj County. His mother was Zsuzsanna Bossányi de Nagybossány (1740-1812). Ferenc had four brothers and four sisters. Until the age of eight he was brought up by his maternal grandfather, Ferenc Bossányi, the notary of Bihar County and parliamentary ambassador, where he did not hear any foreign word during his first seven years.

He wrote his first letters in December 1764 to his parents who lived in Alsóregmec at that time. In 1766 his aunt got sick, therefore they moved to Debrecen for three months for the healing treatment. Kazinczy studied during that time at the College of Debrecen. After the death of his aunt he returned to his parents where he learnt Latin and German from a student of the College of Késmárk (today Kežmarok, Slovakia). His well educated and enlightened father, experiencing rare susceptibility, was delighted with his son, so he also taught him and communicated with him in Latin and German. Kazinczy continued his language studies in Késmárk in 1768 in a preparatory class.

His father, József Kazinczy, initially wanted Ferenc to become a soldier, but Ferenc&#x27;s resistance and the development of his other especially literary talents diverged him from his intent, and then he wanted to see his son as a writer. However the father, as a pietistic educator, understood under the profession of a writer a religious one, and therefore ordered his fourteen-year-old son to translate Christian Fürchtegott Gellert&#x27;s dissertations on religion from Latin to Hungarian. Otherwise, the father provided his son advanced education: Ferenc was educated in foreign languages, could practice fine art and music, and for seeing the world, he brought him to county assemblies and for the lunch of the emperor, Joseph II when the ruler visited Sárospatak. In 1774 the father urged his son to continue his translations, but Ferenc preferred to spend time reading György Bessenyei&#x27;s Ágis tragédiája (1772), Ignác Mészáros&#x27;s Kártigám (1772) and other belles-lettres works. He broadened his knowledge with the idylls of Salomon Gessner and the poems of Vergilius, Horace, Anacreon.

He did not neglect his theological studies, and even at home they frequently debated over theological topics during lunch and dinner. After his father&#x27;s death in 1774, he continued to pursue the translation of Christian Fürchtegott Gellert&#x27;s &quot;De religione&quot; until his teacher of theology dismissed him to do it because he found Gellert&#x27;s works too difficult to interpret. Ferenc turned slowly from theological to more secular and national topics and prepared a short geographical description of the country. István Losonczi Hányoki&#x27;s &quot;Three Small Mirrors&quot; served as an example for his work. It was a childish compilation with the title &quot;Geography of Hungary...&quot; , which he later described as &quot;suddenly scribbled&quot; and was published in Kassa, Hungary (today Košice, Slovakia) at his mother&#x27;s expense in 1775.

===Sárospatak (1769-1779)===
On September 11, 1769, he became a student at the College of Sárospatak where he taught himself Ancient Greek. He studied philosophy and law during his first years. In 1773 he started to learn rhetoric. Even in the same year December he greeted General Count Miklós Beleznay as a member of the thanksgiving delegation of the college in Bugyi on a special reception for donating money toward the construction of the college. Then Kazinczy saw Pest for the first time. Until 1775 he attended the theology courses at the college and from a French soldier who came to Sárospatak learnt French.

He translated György Bessenyei&#x27;s short story written in German, &quot;Die Amerikaner&quot;, to Hungarian and published it in 1776 in Kassa with the title &quot;Az amerikai Podoc és Kazimir keresztyén vallásra való megtérése&quot; (&quot;&quot;). He recommended his translation to his mother. This work informed him about Deism and the principle of religious tolerance. In his translation Kazinczy used the word &quot;világosság&quot; (meaning &quot;clarity&quot;, &quot;lucidity&quot;) the first time in the history of the Hungarian language. Bessenyei welcomed it and his response was inspirational for Kazinczy. Kazinczy understood Bessenyei&#x27;s response as a liberating letter for the profession of an author. He was happy finding the contact with one of the most prominent authors in Hungarian literature of that time. But Kazinczy did not become a follower of Bessenyei, because Bessenyei as a culture politician and philosopher did not mature his works so much so that he could create a literary school.

Ferenc&#x27;s uncle was a member of the delegation of Zemplén County in Vienna at the royal court and he took the young Kazinczy along. This trip made a huge impact on him. It was the first time that Kazinczy saw the emperor&#x27;s city, whose magnificent collections, especially his pictures, completely enthralled him.

At that time Kazinczy followed the thoughts of Salomon Gessner, Christoph Martin Wieland and Dávid Baróti Szabó. Later he got Sándor Báróczi&#x27;s translation of Jean-François Marmontel&#x27;s &quot;Contes Moraux&quot; (&quot;&quot;) from the librarian of Sárospatak, which became his favourite book and he later took it along with him to the prison. So he decided to find a way to lay a wreath on Báróczi&#x27;s works. What fascinated him was the beautiful new style, the rhythmically arranged packing of sentences, the rigidity and purity of the language with a dramatic compactness, and the French strangeness which made the translation truly incomprehensible for amateur readers. It showed Kazinczy a sample for the cultivation of Hungarian belles-lettres. Thus after being primarily inspired by Bessenyi he discovered a life goal as a translator and cultivator of the Hungarian language.

===Kassa (1779-1780)===
After finishing his studies he travelled to Kassa on September 9, 1779, to meet Sámuel Milecz, the prosecutor of Tolna County, where he did his law degree and first met his young love, Erzsébet Rozgonyi and one of his role models, Dávid Baróti Szabó. He stayed there until October 18.

His world-view crises occurred during his stay in Kassa. He turned his back on the religious thesis and &quot;useless&quot; theological studies. Between 1779 and 1781 Kazinczy joined the laic, deist perception of religion which was free of dogmas. The artistic cult of beauty replaced the lost religious experience. His enthusiasm for beauty became his passion, consuming his whole personality and worldview. Sometime in 1780 he started his first major literary work, the translation of Salomon Gessner&#x27;s writings among others. Soon after that he published the Hungarian version of &quot;Siegwart&quot; in 1783. Because of his translations he came in contact with several foreign authors and corresponded with Gessner, Johann Kaspar Lavater and Daniel Chodowiecki. His connection with renowned European scholars made him feel chosen. So after Rousseau he stated his own conscious separation from ordinary people.

Meanwhile, in 1779, he met Miklós Révai in Nagyvárad, Hungary (today Oradea, Romania). Révai was a grammarian who acclimatized the analysing of words according to the rules of morphology in the Hungarian language. They became friends and often shared their own ideas about literature and grammar with each other.

===Eperjes (1781-1782)===

Between January 11, 1781 and June 2, 1782, he continued his practice of law in Eperjes, Hungary (today Prešov, Slovakia). Besides his job he spent a lot of time with arts, too: dancing, playing the flute, drawing, painting and reading. His favourites were especially the German writers. During this time in Eperjes he fell in love with an &quot;educated girl&quot;, the daughter of Ninos Steinmetz, who had a great influence on him.

===Pest (1782-1783)===
He continued his practice of law in August 1782 in Pest where he was sworn in as a hired clerk of József Bernáth. During his time in Pest he came in contact with two older, prominent authors, Lőrinc Orczy and . Ráday introduced him even more to knowledge of Western literature, but also to an appreciation of the old Hungarian writers, especially Miklós Zrínyi. This friendship greatly developed Kazinczy&#x27;s aesthetic sense and broadened his horizons. Kazinczy was still working on the translations of Salomon Gessner&#x27;s idylls and showed them to Ráday and Báróczi. Their enthusiastic acknowledgement greatly enhanced his writer ambition. The fact that Kazinczy was working a lot on the translations of Gessner&#x27;s maudlin, sentimental idylls, was partly brought by the sentimental trend at the time, but on the other hand, Kazinczy intended to practice the Hungarian prose in the depiction of emotions and expression of fond moods.

He found himself soon in a more lively intellectual and political life in Pest and became interested in the church policies of Joseph II which were born in the spirit of absolutism.

Miklós Beleznay, József Teleki, Gedeon Ráday and László Prónay were working on the preparation of the Patent of Toleration in 1781 just when Kazinczy became their trustworthy man. As a Protestant Kazinczy was glad to be so close to the &quot;champions of Protestant freedom&quot;. The policies of the emperor on religious tolerance, on the press, and on the permission for Protestants to hold office strengthened his beliefs in his Freemasonry convictions of believing in the illusion of the &quot;brightness&quot; coming from above. Already in Miskolc, he became a member of the secret society in early 1784 which generally supported the civilization process. It had a major role in the refinement of morals and tastes, unlike the former religiosity, it captured rather the recently alienated members of the biblical religions with a mystical, mostly naturalistic mysticism. Kazinczy later, in the beginning of the 1790s, started to sympathize with the ideas of the Illuminati order, and wrote about them enthusiastically to György Aranka: &quot;their goals are... evertere superstitionem, opprimere Tyrannismum, benefacere ()... is it not the sweetest happiness of life?&quot;.

===Legal career (1783-1785)===
In 1783 he returned to his mother in Alsóregmec, who encouraged him to travel to Tarnaörs to Baron Lőrinc Orczy to accept a job as honorary clerk. On October 13, 1784, he was appointed to this job and then in the same month to magistrate in Abaúj County. On November 29, he also gained a post of vice-notary in Zemplén County, but he had a disagreement with the chief notary and therefore almost immediately lost his position.

Count Lajos Török, the father of Ferenc&#x27;s prospective wife, was Director-General of the Kassa School District and the Grand Master of the Masonic lodge of Miskolc and a friend of Kazinczy. On January 16, 1784, Lajos took Kazinczy among the members of the lodge. As a freemason, Kazinczy got to know several intellectuals like Angelo Soliman and Ignaz Born.

===Inspector of education (1785-1790)===

In August 1785, he traveled to Vienna to introduce himself to the Minister of Public Education, Gottfried van Swieten, and to request the inspectorate of the county schools of the following Counties: Szepes, Sáros, Zemplén, Ung, Bereg, Gömör, Torna, Abaúj, Borsod, Heves and the autonomies of Jászság és Kiskunság. On November 11 he was nominated for this position, which he held for five years.

From 1785 to 1790 Kazinczy was known as the &quot;apostle of renewing Hungarian education&quot;. As a supervisor he had a well paid job and a wide range of power. But even his school-organizing practice turned him against the churches and his brothers of faith whom he had been friends with during the early eighties. He lived in Kassa, travelled a lot in Upper and Eastern Hungary, established and controlled schools. His superiors were satisfied with him and his results. He took over 79 functioning schools as he started working in his position. This number rose rapidly to 124 of which 19 were common schools where pupils belonging to different denominations received state-funded joint education.

Finally he finished the translations of Salomon Gessner&#x27;s idylls and published them in one book with the title &quot;Gessner Idylliumi&quot; in 1788 in Kassa. Its preface dates back to summer 1785 and was written to Gedeon Ráday. During his demanding works on the book, which he did with great care, he could count on the help of the author, Salomon Gessner and, after his death, on the help of his widow. It was Kazinczy&#x27;s first world-famous translation and brought him recognition and appreciation abroad. He paid particular attention to the content and stylistic fidelity, accuracy, and musical rhythm of the language.

Gessner&#x27;s classical idyllic world expresses Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock&#x27;s sentimentality in a pseudo environment. His middle-class optimism keeps all disturbances away from its reader. Its Roccoco emotions are remotely related to Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s world of thoughts, but it is rather a sweeter and simpler happiness offering version of that. By turning away from civilization and retreating into the &quot;ancient beautiful&quot; times, Gessner criticizes society, but at the same time brings us into a middle-class ideal world. As an enlightened, emotionally educated young man, this feeling of life was no stranger to him, but he was particularly delighted with the sophisticated style of the work.

His emotional world was refined by the saloon life of Kassa, whose social pleasures he felt as delightful as the Freemasonry ceremonies which he often attended. His desires were tense between Teréz Radvánszky and Zsuzsanna Kácsándy. For the &quot;nice companies&quot; gathered in the saloons of the Török, Kácsándy and Bárcsay families and for female members of the Freemasonry he addressed his () in 1789. It was a translation of Albrecht Christoph Kayser&#x27;s &quot;Adolfs gesammelte Briefe&quot; which was a pastiche of Werther. This form of translation, which differs from the principle of faithful translation followed during his works on the &quot;Gessner Idylliumi&quot;, was common in Hungarian literature at that time, but not in such a way as Kazinczy did in his . He moved the figure and scene of Kayser&#x27;s original novel into the role of his friends and into the scenes of their frequent gatherings which showed a rare example of personal self-expression in translation. In some cases his protagonist openly attacks the estates of the realm as a limitation of freedom for humans and emotions. The first edition was indeed a great success in Hungarian public life. Ádám Pálóczi Horváth, János Földi, Mihály Csokonai Vitéz, Sándor Kisfaludy, Mihailo Vitković and Benedek Virág enthusiastically welcomed it. However Kazinczy also received criticism from conservative writers and from his teachers in Sárospatak.

On November 13, 1787 Kazinczy together with Dávid Szabó Baróti and János Batsányi in order to organize the literary movements of the Hungarian literature of that era established the &quot;Magyar Museum&quot; periodical. This was the first literary magazine in Hungarian language. But already after the first edition Kazinczy got into a debate on what kind of direction do they want to give to their periodical. Kazinczy recommended the title &quot;Magyar Parnassus&quot; instead of &quot;Magyar Museum&quot; and thought of a belles-lettres-like magazine with translations and critics. Batsányi wanted to create a more general and practical journal. Their political disagreement was deepened by the debate. Kazinczy was a Josephinist, a follower of Joseph II. Unlike Batsányi who was known as a member of the reform movement. Kazinczy soon left the editorial of the periodical.

One of the most difficult time of his life came as Kazinczy became so seriously ill that on May 31, 1789 he had abandoned his life. In Kassa people already talked about his death. But he suddenly got better and quickly recovered.

In November 1789 Kazinczy established his own periodical and titled it &quot;Orpheus&quot; after his own Freemason name. During its operation between 1789 and 1792 only 8 numbers were published in 2 volumes. He wrote his essays under the name &quot;Vince Széphalmy&quot;. Kazinczy faced two problems that threatened the existence of his journal and led to its closure. Firstly beside his aim to improve the Hungarian language on a perfect level he also popularised the ideas of Voltaire and other Freemason philosophers. Secondly, his &quot;Orpheus&quot; was not so popular as the &quot;Magyar Museum&quot; and was financially unsustainable in the long run. Two years after the &quot;Orpheus&quot;, the &quot;Magyar Museum&quot; also ceased in 1794 because of its editors were accused being members of the Jacobin movement of Ignác Martinovics.

The Holy Crown was brought to Hungary in 1790. Kazinczy was a member of the Crown Guard. In the crown&#x27;s room, as a member of the Honor Guard of Abaúj County, he translated Friedrich Ludwig Schröder&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; and wrote his letter to László Prónay, Ispán of Csanád, in which he spoke in favor of Hungarian acting. He went to Kassa, and later to Buda when the efforts of Hungarian acting intensified there. Between September and October in 1790 he started to organize with the help of Pál Ráday the acting in Buda in Hungarian language. However, he had to travel home due to his official affairs.

In his &quot;Hadi és Más Nevezetes Történetek&quot; (&quot;&quot;) he took side against the &quot;student language&quot; (Latin language) and later published an impulsive article in favour of the introduction of the Hungarian language in schools and public life.

After the death of Joseph II the earlier system collapsed. The next emperor, Leopold II abolished the &quot;common schools&quot; in 1791 and Kazinczy&#x27;s office was cancelled. He lost his job for the reason that &quot;I am not a Roman Catholic&quot;, he wrote later in a letter.

He did not want to apply for a job as an officer again. But on request of his mother and his uncle, András Kazinczy, he travelled to Vienna on May 7 to meet the emperor who was then unfortunately in Pisa. Kazinczy returned to Pest on a ship, and after ten days he went to Székesfehérvár to meet Benedek Virág and Ádám Pálóczi Horváth. From there he came back to Vienna, where he was welcomed by the Crown Prince Francis on August 15, but his request was not heard. In Vienna Kazinczy made a friendship with József Hajnóczy. Kazinczy arrived home on September 10 and spent the winter in Alsóregmec.

===Alsóregmec (1791-1794)===
After the death of Leopold II his successor, Francis I, came to the throne. He convoked the National Assembly in Buda. In May 1792 Kazinczy sat in the Lower Chamber as an envoy of Baron Ferenc Vécsey. On June 17 he went to the emperor to apply for the secretary position of the chamber of the royal court. But this office was already reserved by József Hajnóczy.

After the end of the National Assembly Kazinczy returned home and worked in Alsóregmec for a year and a half until 1794. This time of his life was especially productive. He published one after another his translated and original pieces: &quot;Helikoni virágok 1791. esztendőre&quot; (, Pozsony 1791), &quot;Lanassza&quot; (tragedy in 4 acts, after Lemierre, Pozsony 1793), &quot;Sztella&quot; (drama 5 acts, after Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s work, Pozsony 1794.) &quot;A vak lantos&quot; (after Leonhard Wächter&#x27;s work). In addition, he published the tales of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in the translation of his friend János Aszalai with his own adaptation at his own expense. He translated also: &quot;Helikoni virágok&quot; volume 2, first 10 songs of Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock&#x27;s &quot;Der Messias&quot; in prose, one part of Christoph Martin Wieland&#x27;s &quot;Die Gratien&quot;, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing&#x27;s &quot;Emilia Galotti&quot;, William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Brüder&quot;, &quot;Egmont&quot; and &quot;Clavigo&quot;, two plays from Molière: &quot;Le Mariage forcé&quot; and &quot;Le Médecin malgré lui&quot;, Pietro Metastasio&#x27;s &quot;Temistocle&quot;; idylls from Salomon Gessner&#x27;s 15 times revised and a philosophical play from Samuel Christian Hollmann &quot;Die Oekonomie der Natur&quot;.

During that time he experienced that several enlightened policies of Joseph II which were born in the spirit of Absolutism had been repealed and he thought that the system shifted in the wrong direction. He made an intense attack on the existing order in his translation of Christoph Martin Wieland&#x27;s &quot;Sokrates mainomenos oder die Dialoge des Diogenes von Sinope&quot; which was published in 1793. His dominant worldview reflects in the book with the arrogance of the clerics, the abandonment of the existing society, and the escape from this world. It was quickly banned.

Menyhért Szulyovszky, a member of Ignác Martinovics&#x27;s Jacobin movement, handed over to him the &quot;Forradalmi Káté&quot; () during the county assembly. On the inauguration of the chief-ispán of Nagykároly (today Carei, Romania), Ferenc Kazinczy and his brother Dienes Kazinczy disputed, together with Ferenc Szentmarjay and György Szlávy, joining Ignác Martinovics&#x27;s Jacobin movement. In the beginning Kazinczy felt insecure to copy the &quot;Forradalmi Káté&quot;, but Szentmarjay dispelled his concerns. Kazinczy liked the idea of the &quot;bloodless revolution&quot; which the movement propagated.

===In captivity (1794-1801)===
He was arrested on December 14, 1794, at his mother&#x27;s house in Alsóregmec. He was brought to Buda and had to wait for the judgement in the Franciscan monastery of Buda. On May 8, 1795, the blood court sentenced him to death and his cattle had to be taken away. The decision was confirmed by the seven-person board. For three weeks he lived in the shadow of a sure death. Then partly by the intervention of his relatives, the emperor changed his sentence to imprisonment for an uncertain time.

He stayed in Buda until September 27. Then he was taken to Brünn (today Brno, Czech Republic), in the prison of the Špilberk Castle where he arrived on October 7. He lived in a damp, underground jail and got so sick that he could not get up from his bed. Sometimes his stationery were taken away from him; then he wrote with rust paint and rarely with his own blood. He used as pen a kneaded tin piece from the window. When he was allowed to use pen and ink he sat at his table and corrected his earlier translations or was working on new ones. Later his life conditions became better. On the order of Archduke Joseph he was placed on an upper floor on December 21 where he could live at his own expense and could use his books.

On January 6, 1796, he was brought to the Prison of Obrowitz (today Zábrdovice, Czech Republic) near Brno, and on June 22, 1799, he was transferred further to Kufstein Fortress.

On June 30, 1800, his captors fearing the approaching French armies, he was taken first to Bratislava and then to Pest and finally to Munkács (today Mukachevo, Ukraine).

On June 28, 1801, Kazinczy received amnesty from the king, who set him free and allowed him to return home. He spent a total of 2387 days (roughly 6½ years) in prison. He eternalized this part of his life in his book &quot;Fogságom naplója&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

===Later years===

Following his release from captivity his fellow writers welcomed him gladly. But Kazinczy withdrew from the public.

When he was imprisoned, the value of his property was about twenty thousand forints, of which a significant part was spent on the cost of his captivity. He had nothing more than his grapefield and his hill in Kisbányácska near Sátoraljaújhely which he called &quot;Széphalom&quot; (&quot;&quot;). In the winter of 1804 he again became seriously ill, but was luckily cured by József Szentgyörgyi, the chief doctor of Debrecen, in the same year. Szentgyörgyi became his friend and so they corresponded a lot in later years.

In 1806 he settled in Széphalom, where only three rooms were ready from the new mansion. The love of his mother and her joy in the growing family somewhat compensated for the sufferings that had not come to an end with his release. He was constantly struggling with financial difficulties, since after his imprisonment, he had to clear the accounts he was charged with, and later he had to raise his children.

Shortly afterwards he married , daughter of his former patron, and retired to his small estate at Széphalom or &quot;Fairhill&quot;, near Sátoraljaújhely (Széphalom is already a part of Sátoraljaújhely), in the county of Zemplén. In 1828 he took an active part in the conferences held for the establishment of the Hungarian academy, in the historical section of which he became the first corresponding member. He died of cholera at Széphalom.

==Legacy==

Kazinczy, known for possessing great beauty of style, was inspired greatly by the masterpieces of Lessing, Goethe, Wieland, Klopstock, Ossian, La Rochefoucauld, Marmontel, Molière, Metastasio, Shakespeare, Sterne, Cicero, Sallust, Anacreon, and many others. He also edited the works of (Pest, 1812, 8 vols.) and of the poet Zrínyi (1817, 2 vols.), and the poems of Dayka (1813, 3 vols.) and of John Kis (1815, 3 vols.).

A collected edition of his works, consisting for the most part of translations, was published at Pest, 1814-1816, in nine volumes. original productions (&quot;Eredeti Munkái&quot;), largely made up of letters, were edited by Joseph Bajza and Francis Toldy at Pest, 1836-1845, in five volumes. Editions of his poems appeared in 1858 and 1863.

In 1873, a neo-classicistic memorial hall (mausoleum) and graveyard was built in Széphalom in his memory, based on the plans of the architect Miklós Ybl. Today it belongs to the Ottó Herman Museum. The Museum of the Hungarian Language is intended to be built here, whose cornerstone has been laid in the park.

==Personal life==
On November 11, 1804, he married the daughter of his former principal, Count Lajos Török in Nagykázmér (today Kazimír, Slovakia). His wife, Sophie Török, was 21 years younger than Kazinczy and came from a rich and prominent family. Kazinczy regarded himself for years not appropriate to her. He writes in his diary why he chose Sophie:

Sophie married Kazinczy because of love, and her father regarded his daughter&#x27;s husband as a friend of his.

They lived together for almost 27 years, often struggling with serious financial problems, but according to their diaries and letters their life together was happy. They had four sons and four daughters. Unfortunately the firstborn daughter died in infancy in 1806.

* Eugenia (1807 - 1903)
* Thalia (1809 - 1866)

* Anna Iphigenia (1817 - 1890)
* Bálint Cecil Ferenc (1818 - 1873)
* Lajos (1820 - 1849)

While Kazinczy organized the Hungarian literary life, Sophie was most concerned with housekeeping and child rearing. She also taught other children of friends beside her own. According to Kazinczy&#x27;s writings she knew well the herbs and the preparation of home-made medicine and therefore she could help many infected people during the cholera epidemic of 1831.

The youngest son of Kazinczy became a soldier and later an army colonel. He fought in the Hungarian War of Independence of 1848-1849 and after the defeat of the uprising he was executed. He was afterwards named the Fifteenth Martyr of Arad.

<text>An effects cymbal is a cymbal used in a drum kit for a special effect or accent. Effects cymbals include splash cymbals, china cymbals and many other less common types.

This classification is widely accepted but enigmatic. When pang and swish cymbals are used as ride cymbals they are not considered effects cymbals, despite their exotic tone. On the other hand, the most common six-piece cymbal setup consists of hi-hats, ride cymbal, two crash cymbals of slightly different sizes and possibly weights, one splash and one china type, so effects cymbals must be considered a standard part of an extended drum kit.

==Varieties==

===Splash cymbals===
Splash Cymbals range from 6&quot; - 12&quot;. Traditional splash cymbals are relatively quiet and don&#x27;t last for long, but have a high pitch sound.

===China cymbals===

China Cymbals range from 12&quot; - 26&quot;. They are one of the loudest cymbals for the drum kit. Where you hit the china makes a huge difference to its sound. They are basically a smaller version of a Chinese gong (where its name originates from). China cymbals can be used up-side down to produce a &#x27;cleaner&#x27; noise. When used the right way up, china cymbals produce more &#x27;attack.&#x27;

===Others===

There are many other custom effect cymbals, in great variety from different makers.

Drumbal cymbals are designed to rest on the top skin of a snare drum to modify its tone.

Rocktagon cymbals by Sabian are a unique eight-sided design, midway between a crash and a china.</text><links>

<text>Calamis (fl. 5th century BC) was a sculptor of ancient Greece. He was possibly from Boeotia, but nothing certain is known of his life although he is credited with having lived in Athens, and his sculptures are representative of Athenian sculpture. Although none of his works survives, he is known for his talent and skill in sculpting animals, especially horses, as opposed to the human body. He is known to have worked in marble, bronze, gold, and ivory, and was famed for statues of horses, which Pliny says were unrivaled. 

According to Pausanias (9.16.1), Calamis produced a statue of Zeus Ammon for Pindar, and mentions a Hermes Criophorus for Tanagra (9.22.1), which was later depicted on Roman coins of the city. His statue of Apollo Alexikakos stood in front of the Temple of Apollo Patroos in Athens. He produced his most ambitious work, a 30-cubit statue of Apollo for Apollonia Pontica (on modern St. Ivan Island, Bulgaria; Pliny the Elder 4.92, 34.39, Strabo 7.6.1, p. 319). His Sosandra was praised by Lucian, and may have been copied for Aspasia, which in turn was copied by the Romans.

<doc id="736344" wikidata="Q17130833" url="?curid=736344" title="Tarbox Ramblers">
<text>The Tarbox Ramblers are a Boston-based roots and Americana band. The band&#x27;s sound originally centered on arrangements of early twentieth-century blues, gospel and Appalachian music. It later included bandleader Michael Tarbox&#x27;s original songs. The group&#x27;s albums on the Rounder label include a self-titled debut and a second release, A Fix Back East. The albums feature three-part vocal harmonies, a heavy rhythm section and the interplay of slide guitar and violin. 

The original line-up with Robbie Phillips (washtub bass), J. Place (harmonica), Mickey Bones (drums, washboard and bones) and Michael Tarbox was formed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1994.

The mid period group consisted of Tarbox (vocalist and guitarist), Daniel Kellar (violinist), Johnny Sciascia (upright bass fiddle), and Jon Cohan (drummer and percussionist). Since 2003 Nashville based musician, Scott McEwen plays (upright bass fiddle and percussion) with the Ramblers. Rob Hulsman (drums, Nine Pound Hammer) joined in 2003 and toured and recorded with the band through 2005.

Rounder Records released The Tarbox Ramblers&#x27; eponymous debut album in 2000. In summer 2001, Robert Plant contacted the group, to secure them as his opening act for his Boston appearance, and subsequently asked them to continue touring with him. They made the BBC&#x27;s list of top CDs in 2002. 

Tristram Lozaw, a reviewer from the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, described the group as follows:

:&quot;If the Rolling Stones had happened 10 years earlier, hailed from Memphis and been produced by Ike Turner, they might have sounded like The Tarbox Ramblers. The way the Ramblers lay down their backroads grit and raw hillbilly-rock jive, you&#x27;re unlikely to hear a more genuine blast of sandpaper rhythm and roots.&quot;

==Equipment==
Michael Tarbox plays a Supro Lockola solid-body electric guitar in G Tuning (DGDGBD); an Airline Town and Country solid-body electric in D (DADF#AD); and an Epiphone acoustic or Gibson L-4CES hollow-body electric guitar in Standard Tuning (EADGBE). He uses Fender Deluxe and Supro amps in combination with a Premier reverb tank.

==Michael Tarbox&#x27;s Solo work==
Tarbox has worked as a solo artist throughout his career, often favoring a drum-guitar duo format. In 2010 he released his first solo album, &quot;My Primitive Joy&quot;. Produced by Scott McEwen at The Fry Pharmacy Studio in Old Hickory, TN, its spare arrangements, acoustic sound and lyrical approach stand in contrast to The Tarbox Ramblers&#x27; aggressive amplified sound. A second solo album was slated for release in 2012.

Tarbox&#x27;s songs have been used in the television shows &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; and &quot;Supernatural&quot;. They include &quot;Ashes To Ashes,&quot; &quot;Already Gone,&quot; &quot;Were You There?&quot; and &quot;No Harm Blues.&quot;

<text>Georg Christian Karl Wilhelm Michahelles (5 May 1807, Nuremberg – 15 August 1834, Nauplia) was a German zoologist and physician originally from Bavaria.

From 1827, he studied medicine at the University of Munich, where he made the acquaintance of naturalist Lorenz Oken. In 1831 he received his doctorate of medicine and surgery with the thesis &quot;Das Malo Di Scarlievo in Historischer Und Pathologischer Hinsicht&quot;.

Michahelles travelled extensively in Dalmatia, Illyria and Croatia, becoming well known for his study of the birds of the area. He died after being affected with dysentery in Greece, aged only 27, where he went to practice medicine and study the wildlife.

He identified, amongst other Mediterranean species, the western rock nuthatch, ladder snake and the Iberian ribbed newt. The yellow-legged gull (&quot;Larus michahellis&quot;) was named after him by Johann Friedrich Naumann.

<doc id="736350" wikidata="Q5418947" url="?curid=736350" title="Ewe music">
<text>Ewe music is the music of the Ewe people of Togo, Ghana, and Benin, West Africa. Instrumentation is primarily percussive and rhythmically the music features great metrical complexity. Its highest form is in dance music including a drum orchestra, but there are also work (e.g. the fishing songs of the Anlo migrants), play, and other songs. Ewe music is featured in A. M. Jones&#x27;s &quot;Studies in African Music&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Jones describes two &quot;rules&quot; (p. 24 and p. 17, capitalization his):

# The Unit of Time Rule or the Rule of Twos and Threes: &quot;African [Ewe] phrases are built up of the numbers 2 or 3, or their multiples: or of a combination of 2 and 3 or of the multiples of this combination. Thus a phrase of 10 will be (2 + 3) + (2 + 3) or (2 + 2 + 2) + 4.
# The Rule of Repeats: &quot;The repeats within an African [Ewe] song are an integral part of it.&quot; If a song is formally &quot;A + A + B + B + B&quot; one cannot leave out, say, one of the B sections.

He also lists the following &quot;Features of African [Ewe] Music&quot; (p. 49):
# &quot;Songs appear to be in free rhythm but most of them have a fixed time-background.
# The rule of 2 and 3 in the metrical build of songs.
# Nearly all rhythms which are used in combination are made from simple aggregates of a basic time-unit. A quaver is always a quaver.
# The claps or other time-background impart no accent what-ever to the song.
# African [Ewe] melodies are additive: their time-background is divisive.
# The principle of cross-rhythms.
# The rests within and at the end of a song before repeats are an integral part of it.
# Repeats are an integral part of the song: they result in many variations of the call and response form (see summary).
# The call and response type of song is usual in Africa [sic].
# African [Ewe] melodies are diatonic: the major exception being the sequence dominant-sharpened subdominant-dominant.
# Short triplets are occasionally used.
# The teleological trend: many African [Ewe] songs lean towards the &quot;ends&quot; of the lines: it is at the ends where they are likely to coincide with their time-background.
# Absence of the &quot;fermata&quot;.&quot;

==Cross-rhythmic structure==
The ethnomusicologist David Locke states: &quot;Cross-rhythm pervades Ewe drumming.&quot; In fact, the overall rhythmic structure is generated through cross-rhythm. Cross-rhythm was first identified as the basis of sub-Saharan rhythm in the early writings of A.M. Jones, and was later explained in great detail in lectures by the Ewe master drummer and scholar C.K. Ladzekpo, and in the writings of Locke.

At the center of a core of rhythmic traditions within which the composer conveys his ideas is the technique of cross rhythm. The technique of cross rhythm is a simultaneous use of contrasting rhythmic patterns within the same scheme of accents or meter.

In Anlo-Ewe cultural understanding, the technique of cross rhythm is a highly developed systematic interplay of varying rhythmic motions simulating the dynamics of contrasting moments or emotional stress phenomena likely to occur in actual human existence.

As a preventive prescription for extreme uneasiness of mind or self-doubt about one&#x27;s capacity to cope with impending or anticipated problems, these simulated stress phenomena or cross-rhythmic figures are embodied in the art of dance-drumming as mind-nurturing exercises to modify the expression of the inherent potential of the human thought in meeting the challenges of life. The premise is that by rightly instituting the mind in coping with these simulated emotional stress phenomena, intrepidity is achieved.

Intrepidness, or resolute fearlessness, in Anlo-Ewe view, is an extraordinary strength of mind. It raises the mind above the troubles, disorders and emotions which the anticipation or sight of great perils is calculated to excite. It is by this strength that ordinary people become heroes, by maintaining themselves in a tranquil state of mind and preserving the free use of their reason under most surprising and terrible circumstances—Ladzekpo (1995: Web).

===3:2 (hemiola)===
The most fundamental cross-rhythm in Ewe music, and Sub-Saharan African music traditions in general, is three-against-two (3:2), or six-against-four (6:4), also known as a vertical hemiola. The cycle of two or four beats are the main beat scheme, while the triple beat scheme is secondary. Ladzekpo states: &quot;The term secondary beat scheme refers to a component beat scheme of a cross rhythm other than the main beat scheme. In a similar manner as a main beat, each secondary beat is distinguished by measuring off a distinct number of pulsations. A recurrent grouping of a number of these beats in a musical period forms a distinct secondary beat scheme.&quot;

We have to grasp the fact that if from childhood you are brought up to regard beating 3 against 2 as being just as normal as beating in synchrony, then you develop a two dimensional attitude to rhythm… This bi-podal conception is… part of the African&#x27;s nature—Jones (1959: 102)

Novotney observes: &quot;The 3:2 relationship (and [its] permutations) is the foundation of most typical polyrhythmic textures found in West African musics.&quot; 3:2 is the &quot;generative&quot; or &quot;theoretic form&quot; of sub-Saharan rhythmic principles. Agawu succinctly states: &quot;[The] resultant [3:2] rhythm holds the key to understanding . . . there is no independence here, because 2 and 3 belong to a single Gestalt.&quot;

===3:8===
The following bell pattern is used in the Ewe rhythm kadodo. The 24-pulse pattern &quot;crosses&quot; the barline, contradicting the meter with three sets of five strokes, across eight main beats (two measures of four main beats each). The three single strokes are muted. The kadodo bell pattern is an embellishment of three &quot;slow&quot; cross-beats spanning two measures, or three-over-eight (3:8). Within the context of a single four-beat cycle (single measure), the cross-rhythmic ratio is 1.5:4.


==Instruments==
===Bell and rattle===
The atoke, gankogui, and axatse sound the rhythmic foundation. The atoke is a high pitched gong played with an iron rod. The Gankogui is a clapperless double bell that is pounded in shape rather than cast. It produces much less audible high partials than western bells (&quot;purer&quot; fundamental) and is played with a stick. It produces two notes each of which vary and must vary among gankogui so they may be used together. The gankogui plays a key pattern, or guide pattern, which the orchestra builds upon, although the tempo is set by the master drummer. Many bell patterns from 8 to 24 pulses are used, but the most common key pattern is the 12-pulse &quot;basic Ewe&quot;, or &quot;standard pattern&quot;.

===Standard pattern===
The axatse is a rattle—a beaded gourd instrument. The axatse part which accompanies the standard pattern is: &quot;pa ti pa pa ti pa ti pa ti pa pa.&quot; The &quot;pa&#x27;s&quot; sound the standard pattern by striking the gourd against the knee. The &quot;ti&#x27;s&quot; sound pulses in between the bell strokes, by raising the gourd in an upward motion and striking it with the free hand. As is common with many African rhythms, the axatse part begins (first &quot;pa&quot;) on the second stroke of the bell (1a), and the last &quot;pa&quot; coincides with 1. By ending on the beginning of the cycle, the axatse part contributes to the cyclic nature of the overall rhythm.

Asiwui: Sogo, Kidi, Kagan, Bell, Shakers

Dagbamba: Talking drum, Brekete drum

<text>Mēn (Greek: &quot;month; Moon&quot;, presumably influenced by Avestan &quot;måŋha&quot;) was a lunar god worshipped in the western interior parts of Anatolia. He is attested in various localized variants, such as &quot;Mēn Askaenos&quot; in Antioch in Pisidia, or &quot;Mēn Pharnakou&quot; at Ameria in Pontus.

Mēn was probably a Phrygian deity, associated with the local descendant of the Hitto-Luwian moon god Arma, and is often found in association with Persianate elements, especially with the goddess Anahita.
Lunar symbolism dominates his iconography. The god is usually shown with the horns of a crescent emerging from behind his shoulders, and he is described as the god presiding over the (lunar) months. Strabo describes Mēn as a local god of the Phrygians.
Mēn may also be influenced by the Zoroastrian lunar divinity &quot;Mah.&quot;

==Mēn Pharnakou==
In the Kingdom of Pontus, there was a temple estate dedicated to Mēn Pharnakou and Selene at Ameria, near Cabira (Strabo 12.3.31). The temple was probably established by Pharnakes I in the 2nd century BC, apparently in an attempt to counterbalance the influence of the Moon goddess &quot;Ma&quot; of Comana.
The cult of &quot;Mēn Pharnakou&quot; in Pontus has been traced to the appearance of the star and crescent motif on Pontic coins at the time.

==Mēn Askaenos==

A similar temple estate dedicated to Mēn Askaenos existed in Pisidia, first centered around Anabura and then shifted to the nearby city of Pisidian Antioch after its founding by the Seleucids around 280 BC. The temple estate/sacred sanctuary (ἱερόs) was a theocratic monarchy ruled by the &quot;Priest of Priests,&quot; a hereditary title. According to Strabo, this &quot;temple state&quot; that the cult of Mên Askaenos controlled near Pisidian Antioch, persisted until the city was refounded by the Romans in 25 BC, becoming Colonia Caesarea Augusta. The colony was primarily settled by veterans from Legio V Alaudae and Legio VII Gemina.

Taşlıalan (1988) in a study of Antioch in Pisidia has remarked that the people who settled on the acropolis in the Greek colonial era carried the &quot;Mēn Askaenos&quot; cult down to the plain as &quot;Patrios Theos&quot; and in the place where the Augusteum was built, there are some signs of this former cult as bucrania on the rock-cut walls.

==Roman reception==
Autochthonous Mēn as attested in Anatolia is to be distinguished from his reception as a &quot;Phrygian god&quot; in Rome during the imperial period. Here, Mēn is depicted with a Phrygian cap and a belted tunic. He may be accompanied by bulls and lions in religious artwork. The Roman iconography of Mēn partly recalls that of Mithras, who also wears a Phrygian cap and is commonly depicted with a bull and symbols of the Sun and Moon.

The &quot;Augustan History&quot; has the Roman emperor Caracalla (r. 198–217) venerate Lunus at Carrhae; this, i.e. a masculine variant of Luna, &quot;Moon&quot;, has been taken as a Latinized name for Mēn. The same source records the local opinion that anyone who believes the deity of the Moon to be feminine shall always be subject to women, whereas a man who believes that he is masculine will dominate his wife. David Magie suggests that Caracalla had actually visited the temple of &quot;Sin&quot;, the Mesopotamian Moon god.

In later times, Mēn may also have been identified with both Attis of Phrygia and Sabazius of Thrace.

<doc id="736365" wikidata="Q1759222" url="?curid=736365" title="The Blow Monkeys">
<text>The Blow Monkeys are a British pop band formed in 1981. Their first single, &quot;Live Today Love Tomorrow&quot;, was released in 1982. They subsequently enjoyed a successful career with several hit singles and albums throughout the 1980s before splitting up at the beginning of the 1990s. Their first hit song was &quot;Digging Your Scene&quot; which hit No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 14 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in August 1986. They had four albums and eleven singles in the UK charts between 1986 and 1990.

In late 2007, the original band members reunited. They have subsequently released seven albums of new material.

==Career==
===Formation===
The Blow Monkeys formed in 1981 when lead singer, songwriter, guitarist, bassist, and piano player Dr. Robert (born Bruce Robert Howard, 2 May 1961, Haddington, Scotland) returned to the United Kingdom after having spent five years in Australia. Dr. Robert is named after the Beatles song Doctor Robert. The other band members are Mick Anker on bass guitar, Neville Henry on saxophone and Tony Kiley (born 16 February 1962) or Crispin Taylor on drums.

===Recording===
In 1984, the group released their debut album &quot;Limping for a Generation&quot;, but their first hit single came in 1986 with &quot;Digging Your Scene,&quot; from their second album &quot;Animal Magic&quot; (which reached number 21 in the UK Albums Chart). The single attracted attention for its topical lyrics, dealing with the AIDS-fueled backlash against gay people. It peaked at No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number 7 on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. In addition, it reached No. 12 in the UK Singles Chart, No. 24 in Italy, and No. 25 in Germany.

Their third album &quot;She Was Only a Grocer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (whose title is a reference to then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher), was released in January 1987. It reached No. 20 in the UK, thanks to its biggest hit, &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Have to Be This Way,&quot; which reached No. 5 in the UK and No. 28 in Italy, and is featured in the movie &quot;Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol&quot;. The record featured harmony vocals by singer-songwriter Grayson Hugh. It was released in the United States but failed to chart there.

The song &quot;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&quot; appears on the &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; soundtrack.

Outside the group, Robert Howard released a single, &quot;Wait&quot;, which featured early Chicago house singer Kym Mazelle on female lead vocals. It reached No. 7 on the UK chart and was included on The Blow Monkey&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Whoops! There Goes the Neighbourhood&quot;), and on their first greatest-hits album &quot;Choices – The Singles Collection&quot;. This was their highest-charting record, reaching No. 5 in the UK Albums Chart in 1989.

===Split and reunion===
The band split up in late 1990, shortly after the release of their fifth album &quot;Springtime for the World&quot; (an EP of the same name was also released, collecting all three singles from the album). After briefly recording with Dee C. Lee as Slam Slam, Dr. Robert went solo. He contributed to Paul Weller&#x27;s solo debut album, and co-wrote material with both Weller and Lee. Another notable collaborator was Beth Orton.

On 18 November 2007, the original band members announced the reunion of The Blow Monkeys, as well as a new album &quot;Devil&#x27;s Tavern&quot;, and a tour in 2008. Released on 8 September 2008, the album was funded by pre-orders placed by fans. &quot;Q&quot; magazine reviewed the album, saying, &quot;Their first album in 18 years still finds the frontman in fine voice; Robert continues to sound like he dresses only in velvet and smokes cigarillos.&quot;

In June 2009, the band released a special-edition double digipack CD and DVD of their performance at the 100 Club in London. It featured the original line-up performing fifteen songs including &quot;Digging Your Scene,&quot; &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Have to Be This Way,&quot; and &quot;Wait,&quot; plus other tracks from the band&#x27;s earlier work, and a few new songs from &quot;Devil&#x27;s Tavern&quot;.

January 2011 saw the release of the album &quot;Staring at the Sea&quot;, with &quot;Steppin&#x27; Down&quot; as the first single.

&quot;Feels Like a New Morning&quot; was released in April 2013, accompanied by a bonus CD containing 10 Blow Monkeys songs performed by Dr. Robert.

In 2013, Sony Music issued a comprehensive, three-disc box set, &quot;Halfway to Heaven: The Best of The Blow Monkeys &amp; Dr Robert&quot;, including a 1984 concert from the Hammersmith Palais.

In October 2014, the band went to Monnow Valley Studios, Rockfield, Monmouthshire, Wales to record a new album, with mixing and engineering by Jon Withnall. The resulting album &quot;If Not Now, When?&quot; was released in April 2015.

In October 2017, the band released their tenth studio album &quot;The Wild River&quot; on Monks Rd. Records. It was written and produced by Robert Howard and recorded and mixed at Gismo 7 Studio in Motril, Spain. The album features Crispin Taylor on drums and is a return to their soul/funk roots.

In October 2018, the band supported Level 42 on their Eternity Tour.

In September 2021, they released their 11th studio album &quot;Journey To You&quot;, produced and written by Dr. Robert.

In January 2024, they announced their 12th studio album &quot;Together/Alone&quot;, to be released in May.

<text>Mount Richardson is the highest mountain of the Slate Range located beside Pika Peak in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada. The mountain was named in 1859 by James Hector after Sir John Richardson who was the ship&#x27;s surgeon and naturalist on John Franklin&#x27;s 1819 and 1825 expeditions into the Arctic.

The Lake Louise Mountain Resort is developed on the southern slopes of the Merlin Ridge, which includes Mount Richardson, Ptarmigan Peak, Pika Peak. A backcountry campground is located at the foot of the mountain, near Hidden Lake.

The first ascent was made in 1911 by L.L. Delafield who was guided by Edward Feuz jr.

== Routes ==
The scrambling route (rated easy/moderate) begins from Hidden Lake and ascends the southern slopes to the top. The only real challenge on the ascent are a few rubbly gullies just above the lake. A traverse to Pika Peak can be made via the Richardson-Pika col and the west ridge, however this undertaking is much more difficult.

<text>Hydrolagus matallanasi, the striped rabbitfish, is a species of very rare, deep-water chimaera that lives in the ocean at depths to 600 m. It was discovered in 2001 by a team of Brazilian scientists.

These 40-cm-long fishes have an unusual appearance; they have wing-like pectoral fins, a pointed dorsal fin, and a long, whip-like tail. The fish can see in practically total darkness and sense electromagnetic radiation (outside of the visible spectrum) emitted by other marine creatures due to exposed nerves on the sides of its body.

The fish is named after Spanish scientist Jesus Matallanas.

<text>In cymbal making, taper refers to the gradual change in thickness from the bell to the rim of the cymbal. It is one of the key features that determines the tone of the cymbal.

This change is typically not uniform, and it is extremely difficult to generalise on the effects of taper, just to say that they are profound. Crash cymbals tend to have the most pronounced taper, with the faster crashes and the richer tones the most pronounced of all. The bell of a paperthin crash or a fast crash can be thicker than that of many ride cymbals. On the other hand, china cymbals tend to have little or no taper, as do the heavy to medium weights of splash cymbals.

<text>Ptarmigan Peak is a mountain located near Pika Peak in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada.

The mountain was named in 1909 by J.W.A. Hickson, who named it after encountering several rock ptarmigan in the meadows below the peak. Hickson, guided by Edward Feuz Jr., also completed the first ascent of the peak that same year.

The southern slopes of Merlin Ridge, which includes Ptarmigan Peak, Mount Richardson, and Pika Peak, are home to the Lake Louise Mountain Resort. A backcountry campground is located at the base of the mountain, near Hidden Lake.

==Routes==
The scrambling route to the summit of Ptarmigan Peak follows the southern slopes and begins from Hidden Lake.

==Geology==
Like other mountains in Banff National Park, Ptarmigan Peak is composed of sedimentary rock that was laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. This rock, originally formed in shallow seas, was later uplifted and pushed eastward over younger rock layers during the Laramide orogeny. 

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Ptarmigan Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone, characterized by cold, snowy winters and mild summers. During winter, temperatures can drop below −20 °C, with wind chill factors reaching below −30 °C.

<text>Hidden Lake is a small glacial lake in the Skoki Valley of Banff National Park, Canada. It is located in the Slate Range of the Canadian Rockies.

The lake can be reached by following a hiking trail for starting at Fish Creek, at the base of the Lake Louise Ski Area, near Lake Louise. A backcountry campground is situated one km before reaching the lake.
The lake is the starting point for possible ascents of Mount Richardson, Pika Peak and Ptarmigan Peak.

The glacial waters of the lake are drained by Corral Creek through the Sikoki Valley into the Bow River.

<doc id="736392" wikidata="Q238516" url="?curid=736392" title="5-HT receptor">
<text>5-HT receptors, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors, or serotonin receptors, are a group of G protein-coupled receptor and ligand-gated ion channels found in the central and peripheral nervous systems. They mediate both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. The serotonin (i.e., 5-hydroxytryptamine, hence &quot;5-HT&quot;) receptors are activated by the neurotransmitter serotonin, which acts as their natural ligand.

The serotonin receptors modulate the release of many neurotransmitters, including glutamate, GABA, dopamine, epinephrine / norepinephrine, and acetylcholine, as well as many hormones, including oxytocin, prolactin, vasopressin, cortisol, corticotropin, and substance P, among others. Serotonin receptors influence various biological and neurological processes such as aggression, anxiety, appetite, cognition, learning, memory, mood, nausea, sleep, and thermoregulation. They are the target of a variety of pharmaceutical and recreational drugs, including many antidepressants, antipsychotics, anorectics, antiemetics, gastroprokinetic agents, antimigraine agents, hallucinogens, and entactogens.

Serotonin receptors are found in almost all animals and are even known to regulate longevity and behavioral aging in the primitive nematode, &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;.

==Classification== 
5-hydroxytryptamine receptors or 5-HT receptors, or serotonin receptors are found in the central and peripheral nervous systems. 
They can be divided into 7 families of G protein-coupled receptors which activate an intracellular second messenger cascade to produce an excitatory or inhibitory response. The exception to this is the 5-HT3 receptor which is a ligand-gated ion channel. 
In 2014, a novel 5-HT receptor was isolated from the small white butterfly, Pieris rapae, and named pr5-HT8. It does not occur in mammals and shares relatively low similarity to the known 5-HT receptor classes.

===Families===

===Subtypes===

The 7 general serotonin receptor classes include a total of 14 known serotonin receptors. The 15th receptor 5-HT1P has been distinguished on the basis of functional and radioligand binding studies, its existence has never been definitely affirmed or refuted. The specific types have been characterized as follows:

Note that there is no 5-HT1C receptor since, after the receptor was cloned and further characterized, it was found to have more in common with the 5-HT2 family of receptors and was redesignated as the 5-HT2C receptor.

Very nonselective agonists of 5-HT receptor subtypes include ergotamine (an antimigraine), which activates 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1B, D2 and norepinephrine receptors. LSD (a psychedelic) is a 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT5A and 5-HT6 agonist.

==Expression patterns==
The genes coding for serotonin receptors are expressed across the mammalian brain. Genes coding for different receptors types follow different developmental curves. Specifically, there is a developmental increase of HTR5A expression in several subregions of the human cortex, paralleled by a decreased expression of HTR1A from the embryonic period to the post-natal one.
==5-HT-like==
A number of receptors were classed as &quot;5-HT-like&quot; - by 1998 it was being argued that, since these receptors were &quot;a heterogeneous population of 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D and 5-HT7&quot; receptors the classification was redundant.

<doc id="736394" wikidata="Q2616811" url="?curid=736394" title="2002 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 2002 Atlantic hurricane season was a near-average Atlantic hurricane season. It officially started on June 1, and ended on November 30, dates which conventionally limit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic Ocean. The season produced fourteen tropical cyclones, of which twelve developed into named storms; four became hurricanes, and two attained major hurricane status. While the season&#x27;s first cyclone did not develop until July 14, activity quickly picked up: eight storms developed in the month of September. It ended early however, with no tropical storms forming after October 6—a rare occurrence caused partly by El Niño conditions. The most intense hurricane of the season was Hurricane Isidore, a Category 3 storm with a minimum central pressure of 934 mbar; however, Hurricane Lili, with a minimum pressure of 938 mbar, attained higher winds and peaked at Category 4.

The season was less destructive than normal, causing an estimated $2.47 billion (2002 USD) in property damage and 50 fatalities.
Most destruction was due to Isidore, which caused about $1.28 billion (2002 USD) in damage and killed seven people in the Yucatán Peninsula and later the United States, and Hurricane Lili, which caused $1.16 billion (2002 USD) in damage and 15 deaths as it crossed the Caribbean Sea and eventually made landfall in Louisiana.

== Seasonal forecasts ==
Noted hurricane expert William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University issue forecasts of hurricane activity each year, separately from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Gray&#x27;s team determined the average number of storms per season between 1950 and 2000 to be 9.6 tropical storms, 5.9 hurricanes, and 2.3 major hurricanes (storms exceeding Category 3). A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 9 to 12 named storms, of which 5 to 7 reach hurricane strength and 1 to 3 become major hurricanes.

===Pre-season forecasts===
On December 7, 2001, Gray&#x27;s team issued its first extended-range forecast for the 2002 season, predicting above-average activity (13 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and about 2 of Category 3 or higher). It listed an 86 percent chance of at least one major hurricane striking the U.S. mainland. This included a 58 percent chance of at least one major hurricane strike on the East Coast, including the Florida peninsula, and a 43 percent chance of at least one such strike on the Gulf Coast from the Florida Panhandle westward. The potential for major hurricane activity in the Caribbean was forecast to be above average.

On April 5 a new forecast was issued, calling for 12 named storms, 7 hurricanes and 3 intense hurricanes. The decrease in the forecast was attributed to the further intensification of El Niño conditions. The estimated potential for at least one major hurricane to affect the U.S. was decreased to 75 percent; the East Coast potential decreased slightly to 57 percent, and from the Florida Panhandle westward to Brownsville, Texas, the probability remained the same.

===Mid-season forecasts===
On August 7, 2002, Gray&#x27;s team lowered its season estimate to 9 named storms, with 4 becoming hurricanes and 1 becoming a major hurricane, noting that conditions had become less favorable for storms than they had been earlier in the year. The sea-level pressure and trade wind strength in the tropical Atlantic were reported to be above normal, while sea surface temperature anomalies were on a decreasing trend.

On August 8, 2002, NOAA revised its season estimate to 7–10 named storms, with 4–6 becoming hurricanes and 1–3 becoming major hurricanes. The reduction was attributed to less favorable environmental conditions and building El Niño conditions.

==Seasonal summary==

The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 2002. It was a near-average season in which 14 tropical cyclones formed. Twelve depressions attained tropical storm status, and four of these reached hurricane status. Two hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes. Activity was suppressed somewhat by an El Niño, which was of near-moderate intensity by August. Five named storms made landfall in Louisiana, and even Four named storms was tied with 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, a record which was later tied in 2020. Overall, the Atlantic tropical cyclones of 2002 collectively resulted in 50 deaths and around $2.47 billion in damage. The season ended on November 30, 2002.

Tropical cyclogenesis began with Tropical Storm Arthur, which formed just offshore North Carolina on July 14. Following the storm&#x27;s extratropical transition on July 16, no further activity occurred until Tropical Storm Bertha developed near Louisiana on August 4. Cristobal formed on the next day, while Dolly developed on August 29. September featured eight named storms, a record which was later tied in 2007 and 2010 and surpassed in 2020. During that month, Gustav reached hurricane intensity on September 11, the latest date of the first hurricane in a season since 1941. While the long-lasting Kyle and Lili persisted into October, only one tropical cyclone developed that month, Tropical Depression Fourteen on October 14. The depression was absorbed by a cold front while crossing Cuba two days later, ending seasonal activity.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a low accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 67, the lowest total since 1997. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding , which is the threshold for tropical storm status.

==Systems==
===Tropical Storm Arthur===

A dissipating cold front stalled over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in early July 2002, producing a weak low-level circulation on July 9. The system meandered for the next few days, until a mid-level trough moved the circulation across the southeastern United States on July 13. On the next day, the system moved along the coast of the Carolinas, producing an organized area of convection over its center. Later that day, the system organized into Tropical Depression One about west-southwest of Hatteras, North Carolina. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was moving quickly to the east-northeast, due to a deepening mid-level low south of the Canadian Maritimes. The depression&#x27;s track over the Gulf Stream allowed for steady strengthening, and it intensified into Tropical Storm Arthur on July 15, as rainbands developed. Arthur attained peak winds of early on July 16 about south-southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Thereafter, the center became separated from the area of deepest convection, and Arthur transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on July 17. The storm turned northward around a larger mid-level low, moving over eastern Newfoundland. On July 19, the remnants of Arthur turned to a southeast drift between Newfoundland and Greenland, and by late in the day its winds decreased to below gale force.

The precursor tropical disturbance dropped rainfall across Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, peaking at in Weston, Florida. The system produced scattered precipitation across North Carolina, generally between . On July 16, Arthur passed north of Bermuda, where it brought gusty winds and of rainfall. As an extratropical storm, Arthur produced gusty winds and dropped about of rainfall in Newfoundland. Strong waves capsized a boat in the Conne River, killing one person. 
===Tropical Storm Bertha===
A surface trough of low pressure that would later spawn Tropical Storm Cristobal developed a tropical depression in the northern Gulf of Mexico on August 4. It quickly strengthened into a minimal tropical storm early on August 5, and made landfall near Boothville, Louisiana, just two hours later. Bertha weakened to a tropical depression, but retained its circulation over Louisiana. A high-pressure system built southward, unexpectedly forcing the depression to the southwest. It emerged back over the Gulf of Mexico on August 7, where proximity to land and dry air prevented further strengthening. Bertha moved westward and made a second landfall near Kingsville, Texas, on August 9 with winds of only . The storm dissipated about 10 hours later.

Across the Gulf Coast of the United States, Bertha dropped light to moderate rainfall; most areas received less than . Precipitation from the storm peaked at in Norwood, Louisiana. Minor flooding was reported, which caused light damage to a few businesses, 15 to 25 houses, and some roadways. Overall, damage was very minor, totaling to $200,000 (2002 USD) in damage. In addition, one death was reported due to Bertha, a drowning due to heavy surf in Florida.
===Tropical Storm Cristobal===

A trough extended from the northern Gulf of Mexico to the western Atlantic Ocean in early August, producing Tropical Storm Bertha in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as a low pressure area off the coast of South Carolina. The second low moved eastward and slowly organized, developing into Tropical Depression Three late on August 5, about 175 miles (280 km/h) east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. The developing depression had rainbands and outflow. It moved southeastward at first around the northeastern periphery of an anticyclone over Florida. Although the convection was confined to its southern half, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Cristobal on August 6. On August 7 the storm turned eastward, due to the influence of a large approaching mid to upper-level frontal zone. As the convection organized further, Cristobal intensified somewhat and attained peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). On August 8, increased dry air weakened the convection and caused Cristobal to accelerate east-northeastward. The low-level circulation interacted with the approaching frontal zone, and by 0000 UTC on August 9 Tropical Storm Cristobal was absorbed by the cold front about 350 miles (560 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The remnants continued northeastward, passing near Newfoundland on August 10 before weakening near Greenland on August 14.

As a tropical cyclone, Cristobal had minimal effects on land. However, its remnants brought unsettled conditions to Bermuda, including a 45 mph (72 km/h) wind gust at the Bermuda International Airport. The combination of moisture from Cristobal and cold front into which it was absorbed produced 2.78 inches (71 mm) of rain there in a 24‑hour period. An annual powerboat race circumnavigating Bermuda had to be postponed by a week because of the adverse weather. Although Cristobal remained offshore during its evolution, rough seas and rip currents were felt along portions of the U.S. East Coast. On August 9, lifeguards in Volusia County, Florida, rescued about 25 swimmers caught in rip currents. Offshore winds from the storm were credited with ending a widespread outbreak of jellyfish stings affecting bathers along the northern Atlantic coast of Florida. Some 1,000 stings had been reported. Later, the extratropical remnants of Cristobal continued to interact with a high pressure system over the Mid-Atlantic states to generate dangerous swimming conditions further north. Along the south shore of Long Island, New York, significant wave heights reached 4 feet (1.2 m), and rip currents resulted in three drowning deaths on August 10: one in Montauk; one just east of Moriches Inlet; and one off Rockaway Beach. In the latter case, the victim had become exhausted after swimming out to save his son-in-law, an inexperienced swimmer, from the rip current.
===Tropical Storm Dolly===

A tropical wave exited the African coast on August 27, and with low favorable conditions the system organized into Tropical Depression Four on August 29 about southwest of Cape Verde. Six hours later, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dolly after developing sufficient outflow and curved banding features. The storm continued to intensify as more convection developed, and Dolly reached peaked winds of on August 30. After peaking in intensity, the storm suddenly lost organization, and the winds decreased to minimal tropical storm force. After a brief re-intensification trend, Dolly again weakened due to wind shear. On September 4, Dolly weakened to a tropical depression, and later that day was absorbed by the trough; it never affected land.
===Tropical Storm Edouard===
Edouard formed out of an area of disturbed weather north of the Bahamas on September 2. It drifted northward, then executed a clockwise loop off the coast of Florida. Despite dry air and moderate upper-level shear, Edouard strengthened to a peak of winds, but the unfavorable conditions caught up with it. The storm weakened as it turned west-southwestward, and made landfall near Ormond Beach, Florida on September 5 as a minimal tropical storm. Edouard crossed Florida, and emerged over the Gulf of Mexico as a minimal depression. Outflow from the stronger Tropical Storm Fay caused Tropical Depression Edouard to weaken further, and Edouard was eventually absorbed by Fay.

Tropical Storm Edouard dropped moderate rainfall across Florida, peaking at in DeSoto County. Though it was a tropical storm at landfall, winds were light across the path of the storm over land. Several roads were flooded from moderate precipitation. No casualties were reported, and damage was minimal.
===Tropical Storm Fay===
In early September, a low pressure center developed along a trough of low pressure, and on September 5, the system had gained sufficient organization to be a tropical depression, to the southeast of Galveston. The depression drifted south-southwest while strengthening into Tropical Storm Fay, reaching its peak strength of on the morning of September 6. The system then abruptly turned to the west-northwest, and remained steady in strength and course until landfall the next day, near Matagorda. It quickly degenerated into a remnant low, which itself moved slowly southwestward over Texas. The low eventually dissipated on September 11 over northeastern Mexico.

The storm brought heavy rainfall in Mexico and Texas. The storm also caused six tornadoes, up to of rain, and extended periods of tropical storm force winds. The storm caused moderate flooding in some areas due to high rainfall amounts, which left about 400 homes with some form of damage. In total, 400 houses sustained damage from flooding. 1,575 houses were damaged from the flooding or tornadic damage, 23 severely, amounting to $4.5 million (2002 USD) in damage. No deaths are attributed to Fay.
===Tropical Depression Seven===

A tropical wave exited Africa on September 1, and after initial development became disorganized. It moved west-northwestward for a week, reorganizing enough by September 7 to be declared Tropical Depression Seven about east-southeast of Bermuda. At the time, the depression had persistent convection around a small circulation, and it moved steadily westward due to a ridge to its north. Shortly after forming, strong wind shear diminished the convection and left the center partially exposed. By September 8, there was no remaining thunderstorm activity, and the depression degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area. The storm dissipated shortly after as strong wind shear continued to cause the storm to deteriorate while located 980 mi (1580 mi) southeast of Bermuda. The depression never affected land.
===Hurricane Gustav===
An area of unsettled weather developed between the Bahamas and Bermuda on September 6, and over the next few days convection increased in intensity and coverage. On September 8, the system gained sufficient organization to be declared a subtropical depression off the Southeast United States coast; later that day, the system was named Subtropical Storm Gustav. After attaining tropical characteristics on September 10, Gustav passed slightly to the east of the Outer Banks of North Carolina as a tropical storm before. While moving northeastward, Gustav intensified into a hurricane on September 11 and briefly became a Category 2 hurricane, prior to making two landfalls in Atlantic Canada as a Category 1 hurricane on September 12. Gustav became extratropical over Newfoundland around 1200 UTC that day, though the remnants meandered over the Labrador Sea before dissipating on September 15.

The storm was responsible for one death and $100,000 (2002 USD) in damage, mostly in North Carolina. The interaction between Gustav and a non-tropical system produced strong winds that caused an additional $240,000 (2002 USD) in damage in New England, but this damage was not directly attributed to the hurricane. In Atlantic Canada, the hurricane and its remnants brought heavy rain, tropical storm and hurricane-force winds, as well as storm surges for several days. Localized flooding was reported in areas of Prince Edward Island, and 4,000 people in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island were left without power.
===Tropical Storm Hanna===
In early September, a tropical wave merged with a trough of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico and spawned a low-pressure system. Convection steadily deepened on September 11 east of the upper-level low and the surface low; it was classified as Tropical Depression Nine the next day. The disorganized storm moved westward, then northward, where it strengthened into Tropical Storm Hanna later that day. After reaching a peak with winds of , it made two landfalls on the Gulf Coast, eventually dissipating on September 15 over Georgia.

Because most of the associated convective activity was east of the center of circulation, minimal damage was reported in Louisiana and Mississippi. To the east on Dauphin Island, Alabama, the storm caused coastal flooding which closed roads and forced the evacuation of residents. Portions of Florida received high wind gusts, heavy rainfall, and strong surf that resulted in the deaths of three swimmers. Throughout the state, 20,000 homes lost electricity. The heavy rainfall progressed into Georgia, where significant flooding occurred. Crop damage was extensive, and over 300 structures were damaged by the flooding. Overall, Hanna caused a total of about $20 million (2002 USD) in damage and three fatalities.
===Hurricane Isidore===
On September 9, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa, and by September 14 it was classified as a tropical depression. The next day the storm was located just south of Jamaica, and it developed into Tropical Storm Isidore. On September 19, it intensified into a hurricane, and Isidore made landfall in western Cuba as a Category 1 storm. Just before landfall near Puerto Telchac on September 22, Isidore reached its peak intensity, with wind speeds of , making it a strong Category 3 storm. After returning to the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm, Isidore&#x27;s final landfall was near Grand Isle, Louisiana, on September 26. The storm weakened to a tropical depression over Mississippi early the following day, before becoming extratropical over Pennsylvania later on September 27 and then being absorbed by a frontal system.

Isidore made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula of southern Mexico as a Category 3 hurricane, leaving $950 million (2002 USD) in damage in the country. Despite dropping over of rainfall among other effects, only two indirect deaths were reported there. As a tropical storm, Isidore produced a maximum of of rainfall in the United States at Metairie, Louisiana. The rainfall was responsible for flooding that caused moderate crop damage, with a total of $330 million in damage (2002 USD).
===Tropical Storm Josephine===

A non-tropical low developed along a dissipating stationary front on September 16 in the central Atlantic and drifted north-northeastward. The National Hurricane Center classified it as Tropical Depression Eleven on September 17 about east of Bermuda, and initially the depression did not have significant deep convection. A wind report early on September 18 indicated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Josephine. The storm continued generally northeastward, steered between a subtropical high to the northeast and a frontal system approaching from the west. Josephine maintained a well-defined circulation, but its deep convection remained intermittent. Early on September 19 the storm began being absorbed by the cold front, and as a tropical cyclone its winds never surpassed . Later that day Josephine transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and suddenly intensified to winds of . The extratropical low was quickly absorbed by another larger extratropical system on the afternoon of September 19.
===Hurricane Kyle===
A non-tropical low formed into Subtropical Depression Twelve, well east-southeast of Bermuda on September 20. It became Subtropical Storm Kyle the next day, and Tropical Storm Kyle on September 22. Kyle drifted slowly westward, slowly strengthening, and reached hurricane strength on September 25; it weakened back into a tropical storm on September 28. The cyclone&#x27;s strength continued to fluctuate between tropical depression and tropical storm several times. Its movement was also extremely irregular, as it shifted sharply north and south along its generally westward path. On October 11, Kyle reached land and made its first landfall near McClellanville, South Carolina. While skirting the coastline of the Carolinas, it moved back over water, and made a second landfall near Long Beach, North Carolina later the same day. Kyle continued out to sea where it merged with a cold front on October 12, becoming the fourth longest-lived Atlantic hurricane.

Kyle brought light precipitation to Bermuda, but no significant damage was reported there. Moderate rainfall accompanied its two landfalls in the United States, causing localized flash flooding and road closures. Floodwaters forced the evacuation of a nursing home and several mobile homes in South Carolina. Kyle spawned at least four tornadoes, the costliest of which struck Georgetown, South Carolina; it damaged 106 buildings and destroyed seven others, causing eight injuries. Overall damage totaled about $5 million (2002 USD), and no direct deaths were reported. However, the remnants of Kyle contributed to one indirect death in the British Isles.
===Hurricane Lili===
On September 16, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and across the Atlantic. It developed a low level cloud circulation midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles on September 20. The next day, the system had become sufficiently organized to classify the system as a tropical depression about east of the Windward Islands and intensified into Tropical Storm Lili on September 23. After nearly reaching hurricane status over the eastern Caribbean, the storm degenerated into a tropical wave on September 25, before becoming a tropical depression again early on September 27. The cyclone re-intensified into a tropical storm several hours later. On September 30, Lili became a hurricane while passing over the Cayman Islands. After striking Cuba&#x27;s Isla de la Juventud and Pinar del Río Province as a Category 2, the storm attained Category 4 status in the Gulf of Mexico, However, Lili rapidly weakened to a Category 1 hurricane before making landfall near Intracoastal City, Louisiana, on October 3. The next day, it was absorbed by an extratropical low near the Tennessee – Arkansas border.

In Louisiana, wind gusts reaching , coupled with over of rainfall and a storm surge of , caused $1.1 billion (2002 USD) in damage. A total of 237,000 people lost power, and oil rigs offshore were shut down for up to a week.
===Tropical Depression Fourteen===

A weak tropical wave moved through the Lesser Antilles on October 9. As the system reached the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 12, convection increased, and a broad low-pressure area formed later that day. Over the next two days, the low significantly organized, and became Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200 UTC on October 14. The depression initially tracked west-northwestward, but then curved to the north-northeast. Due to vertical wind shear, the depression was unable to intensify, and remained below tropical storm status during its duration. By 1600 UTC on October 16, the depression made landfall near Cienfuegos, Cuba with winds of . While crossing the island, the depression was absorbed by a cold front early on October 17. Minimal impact was reported, which was limited to locally heavy rains over portions of Jamaica, Cuba, and the Cayman Islands.
==Storm names==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 2002. This was the same list used in the 1996 season, with the exception of the names &quot;Cristobal&quot;, &quot;Fay&quot; and &quot;Hanna&quot;, which replaced &quot;Cesar&quot;, &quot;Fran&quot; and &quot;Hortense&quot; respectively. Each of the three new names was used for the first time in 2002.
Beginning in 2002, subtropical cyclones were numbered and named following the same procedure as tropical cyclones. &quot;Gustav&quot; was the first subtropical system to be named under the new policy.

===Retirement===

In the spring of 2003, the World Meteorological Organization retired the names &quot;Isidore&quot; and &quot;Lili&quot; from its rotating Atlantic hurricane name lists due to the damage each caused, and they will never be used again in the Atlantic basin. Those names were replaced with &quot;Ike&quot; and &quot;Laura&quot; for the 2008 season.

==Season effects==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 2002 USD.

<doc id="736403" wikidata="Q3321458" url="?curid=736403" title="Mr. Clean">
<text>Mr. Clean (or Mr. Proper) is a brand name and mascot owned by Procter &amp; Gamble. It was used for an all-purpose cleaner and later also for a melamine foam abrasive sponge.

The all-purpose cleaner was originally formulated by Linwood Burton, a marine ship cleaning businessman with accounts throughout the east coast of the United States and his friend, Mathusan Chandramohan, a rich entrepreneur from Sri Lanka.

Mr. Clean made his television commercial debut in 1958, initially portrayed in the live-action versions by character actor House Peters Jr.

==International versions==
The name &quot;Clean&quot; is usually translated in languages:
* Don Limpio in Spain; originally Mr. Proper
* Maestro Limpio in Mexico
* Mastro Lindo in Italy
* Meister Proper in Germany
* Mr. Proper in the Netherlands and Eastern Europe, including Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine
* M. Net in French Canada
* Monsieur Propre in France
In the UK and Ireland, the product is sold under the brand name Flash; this is because a company exists that uses the &quot;Mr. Clean&quot; name. Furthermore, Flash does not use a mascot, unlike Mr. Clean. For many years Flash was advertised on UK television by Scottish actress Molly Weir, with the catchphrase &quot;Flash cleans floors WITHOUT scratching&quot;. Since 2016, adverts for Flash have included parodies of the song &quot;Flash&quot; by Queen.

In the 1980s, Uldarico L. Lacida of Secure Promotions promoted Mr. Clean products in Cebu, Philippines.

==Mascot==
The product&#x27;s mascot is the character Mr. Clean. In 1957, Harry Barnhart conceived the idea. Ernest C. Allen who was in the art department at the advertising agency Tatham-Laird &amp; Kudner in Chicago drew Mr. Clean as a muscular, tanned, bald man who cleans things very well.

According to Procter &amp; Gamble, the original model for the image of Mr. Clean was a United States Navy sailor from the city of Pensacola, Florida, although some people may think he is a genie based on his earring, folded arms, and tendency to appear magically at the appropriate time. (One of the live-action commercials has a character directly refer to Mr. Clean as a genie).

Hal Mason, the head animator at Cascade Studios in Hollywood, California modified the existing artwork in print-advertising to be more readily used for the television commercials written, produced, and directed by Thomas Scott Cadden. (Cadden also wrote the words and music for the original Mr. Clean jingle — see below.) The first actor to portray Mr. Clean in live action television commercials was House Peters Jr.

In a &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary for the original illustrator, Richard Black, the product Mr. Clean was referenced to as the &quot;Genie in a bottle&quot;.

Mr. Clean has always smiled, except for a brief time in the &quot;Mean Mr. Clean&quot; series of ads when he was frowning because he hated dirt. Although Mr. Clean is the strong, silent type, he did speak once in a few television commercials where actor Mark Dana appeared playing Mr. Clean in a suit-and-tie in the mid-1960s.

Mr. Clean&#x27;s first name, Veritably, originated from a &#x27;Give Mr. Clean a First Name&#x27; promotion in 1962.

In 2005, Mr. Clean was shown in MasterCard&#x27;s &quot;Icons&quot; commercial during Super Bowl XXXIX, which depicts advertising mascots having dinner together, where he is shown helping do the dishes, and receives some dirty ones from Charlie the Tuna.

Mr. Clean appeared on the September 2010 cover of &quot;Biz X Magazine&quot;.

Mr. Clean was redesigned by Chase Design Group.

On September 8, 2016, Procter &amp; Gamble announced a contest to find the replacement Mr. Clean. The contest was introduced with a new 60-second spot with actor Kellan Lutz spoofing an audition reel for the Mr. Clean role that took place in August 2016 Los Angeles, California. In addition to casting sessions at 404 NYC in New York on September 7, 2016, and Envision Studios LA in Los Angeles on September 14, 2016, contestants could also submit videos to the contest web site. The contest winner would receive $20,000 in mid-October, and be featured in the 2017 limited edition Mr. Clean calendar.

==Jingle==
Mr. Clean&#x27;s theme song, or jingle, has been around since the product&#x27;s introduction, initially sung as a popular-music style duet between a man (Don Cherry) and a woman (Betty Bryan). Thomas Scott Cadden wrote the jingle at his home in Skokie, Illinois in the spring of 1957 while working for Tatham-Laird &amp; Kudner Advertising Agency. The vocal and piano recording was made on a home tape recorder for presentation to the agency and later to Procter &amp; Gamble. Procter &amp; Gamble approved the jingle in the spring or summer of 1957. Thomas Scott Cadden produced the recording of the jingle at Universal Recording Corporation in Chicago in the summer or fall of 1957. Bill Walker was the arranger and Don Cherry and Betty Bryan were the singers. In January or February 1958, Cadden produced and wrote the first pool of television commercials — nine one-minute commercials and four 20-second &quot;lifts&quot;. Included was the original full 60-second jingle commercial and the 10-second jingle &quot;tag&quot; at the end of all the others. They were produced at Cascade Pictures in Hollywood, California. The first pool of commercials ran in August 1958 at WDTV/KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the year the product was introduced. The jingle is copyrighted under numbers EU 589219 &amp; EU 599220. The jingle is also registered with ASCAP under title code 570098598 &amp; 570006267.

In 2016, an updated reboot of the jingle was made for a television advertisement. It is the longest running advertising jingle used in television history.

Original lyrics by Thomas Scott Cadden:

Chorus:
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Mr. Clean gets rid of dirt and grime and grease in just a minute!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Mr. Clean will clean your whole house and everything that&#x27;s in it!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
Verse 1:
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Floors, doors, walls, halls, white sidewall tires, and old golf balls!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Sinks, stoves, bathtubs he&#x27;ll do, he&#x27;ll even help clean laundry too!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
(Repeat Chorus)
&lt;br&gt;
Verse 2:
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Can he clean a kitchen sink?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Quicker than a wink!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Can he clean a window sash?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Faster than a flash!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Can he clean a dirty mirror?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;He&#x27;ll make it bright &amp; clearer!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Can he clean a diamond ring?&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Mr. Clean cleans anything!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
(Repeat Chorus)
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean, Mr. Clean!&quot;
Reboot lyrics:

&quot;Mr. Clean gets tough on dirt and grime&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;And grease in just a minute&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Mr. Clean will clean your whole house&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;And every room that&#x27;s in it.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Floors, doors, walls, halls&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;He&#x27;s so tough he cleans them all&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Grimy tubs and tiles he&#x27;ll do&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;so your bathroom looks clean as new!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Mr. Clean gets tough on stuck on stuff&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;cleans kitchens in a minute&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Mr. Clean will clean your whole house&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;And every room that&#x27;s in it.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Mr. Clean!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Mr. Clean!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Mr. Clean!&quot;
In the Philippines, Mr. Clean has had multiple jingles in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s titled &quot;Kuskos Piga&quot; (transl. Scrub Squeeze), then &quot;Labadami Labanbango&quot;, performed by Sylvia La Torre (1984) and Nova Villa (1995), then &quot;Labadami Labango Labalinis&quot; by Ali Sotto and Manilyn Reynes in 1997 and 1998 respectively, and &quot;Walang Dagdag Fabcon, Walang Dagdag Gastos&quot; (transl. No Extra Fabcon, No Extra Cost) in 2009, performed by Sarah Geronimo. She is the last endorser before being replaced by Bonux in 2010.

==Mr. Clean scenes competition==
In 1998, Honda Motor Co. created an advertising campaign, including a television commercial, featuring Mr. Clean to represent Honda&#x27;s clean running Accord along with other Honda products including lawnmowers, string trimmers, motorcycles, and marine engines.

In March 2007, Mr. Clean launched an online competition with YouTube that gave consumers the opportunity to create a commercial advertising the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser.

The competition ran through June 30, 2007. In September 2007, the $10,000 prize was awarded to the creator of the winning video &quot;Here&#x27;s to Stains&quot;.

<doc id="736407" wikidata="Q421797" url="?curid=736407" title="Opioid receptor">
<text>Opioid receptors are a group of inhibitory G protein-coupled receptors with opioids as ligands. The endogenous opioids are dynorphins, enkephalins, endorphins, endomorphins and nociceptin. The opioid receptors are ~40% identical to somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). Opioid receptors are distributed widely in the brain, in the spinal cord, on peripheral neurons, and digestive tract.

== Discovery ==
By the mid-1960s, it had become apparent from pharmacologic studies that opioids were likely to exert their actions at specific receptor sites, and that there were likely to be multiple such sites. Early studies had indicated that opiates appeared to accumulate in the brain. The receptors were first identified as specific molecules through the use of binding studies, in which opiates that had been labeled with radioisotopes were found to bind to brain membrane homogenates. The first such study was published in 1971, using 3H-levorphanol. In 1973, Candace Pert and Solomon H. Snyder published the first detailed binding study of what would turn out to be the μ opioid receptor, using 3H-naloxone. That study has been widely credited as the first definitive finding of an opioid receptor, although two other studies followed shortly after.

== Purification ==
Purification of the receptor further verified its existence. The first attempt to purify the receptor involved the use of a novel opioid antagonist called chlornaltrexamine that was demonstrated to bind to the opioid receptor. Caruso later purified the detergent-extracted component of rat brain membrane that eluted with the specifically bound 3H-chlornaltrexamine.

==Major subtypes==
There are four major subtypes of opioid receptors. OGFr was originally discovered and named as a new opioid receptor zeta (ζ). However it was subsequently found that it shares little sequence similarity with the other opioid receptors, and has quite different function.

== Evolution ==
The opioid receptor (OR) family originated from two duplication events of a single ancestral opioid receptor early in vertebrate evolution. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that the family of opioid receptors was already present at the origin of jawed vertebrates over 450 million years ago. In humans, this resulting from a double tetraploidization event resulted in the receptor genes being located on chromosomes 1, 6, 8, and 20. Tetraploidization events often result in the loss of one or more of the duplicated genes, but in this case, nearly all species retain all four opioid receptors, indicating biological significance of these systems. Stefano traced the co-evolution of OR and the immune system underlying the fact that these receptors helped earlier animals to survive pain and inflammation shock in aggressive environments.

The receptor families delta, kappa, and mu demonstrate 55–58% identity to one another, and a 48–49% homology to the nociceptin receptor. Taken together, this indicates that the NOP receptor gene, OPRL1, has equal evolutionary origin, but a higher mutation rate, than the other receptor genes.

Although opioid receptor families share many similarities, their structural differences lead to functional difference. Thus, mu-opioid receptors induce relaxation, trust, satisfaction, and analgesia. This system may also help mediate stable, emotionally committed relationships. Experiments with juvenile guinea pigs showed that social attachment is mediated by the opioid system. The evolutionary role of opioid signaling in these behaviors was confirmed in dogs, chicks, and rats. Opioid receptors also have a role in mating behaviors. However, mu-opioid receptors do not just control social behavior because they also make individuals feel relaxed in a wide range of other situations.

Kappa- and delta-opioid receptors may be less associated with relaxation and analgesia because kappa-opioid receptor suppresses mu-opioid receptor activation, and delta-opioid receptor interacts differently with agonists and antagonists. Kappa-opioid receptors are involved in chronic anxiety&#x27;s perceptual mobilization, whereas delta-opioid receptors induce action initiation, impulsivity, and behavioural mobilization. These differences led some researches to suggest that up- or down-regulations within three opioid receptors families are the basis of different dispositional emotionality seen in psychiatric disorders.

Human-specific opioid-modulated cognitive features are not attributable to coding differences for receptors or ligands, which share 99% similarity with primates, but to regulatory changes in expression levels.

==Nomenclature==
The receptors were named using the first letter of the first ligand that was found to bind to them. Morphine was the first chemical shown to bind to &quot;mu&quot; receptors. The first letter of the drug morphine is m, rendered as the corresponding Greek letter μ. In similar manner, a drug known as ketocyclazocine was first shown to attach itself to &quot;κ&quot; (kappa) receptors, while the &quot;δ&quot; (delta) receptor was named after the mouse vas deferens tissue in which the receptor was first characterised. An additional opioid receptor was later identified and cloned based on homology with the cDNA. This receptor is known as the nociceptin receptor or ORL1 (opiate receptor-like 1).

The opioid receptor types are nearly 70% identical, with the differences located at the N and C termini. The μ receptor is perhaps the most important. It is thought that the G protein binds to the third intracellular loop of all opioid receptors. Both in mice and humans, the genes for the various receptor subtypes are located on separate chromosomes.

Separate opioid receptor subtypes have been identified in human tissue. Research has so far failed to identify the genetic evidence of the subtypes, and it is thought that they arise from post-translational modification of cloned receptor types.

An IUPHAR subcommittee has recommended that appropriate terminology for the 3 classical (μ, δ, κ) receptors, and the non-classical (nociceptin) receptor, should be MOP (&quot;Mu OPiate receptor&quot;), DOP, KOP and NOP respectively.

==Additional receptors==
Sigma (σ) receptors were once considered to be opioid receptors due to the antitussive actions of many opioid drugs&#x27; being mediated via σ receptors, and the first selective σ agonists being derivatives of opioid drugs (e.g., allylnormetazocine). However, σ receptors were found to not be activated by endogenous opioid peptides, and are quite different from the other opioid receptors in both function and gene sequence, so they are now not usually classified with the opioid receptors.

The existence of further opioid receptors (or receptor subtypes) has also been suggested because of pharmacological evidence of actions produced by endogenous opioid peptides, but shown not to be mediated through any of the four known opioid receptor subtypes. The existence of receptor subtypes or additional receptors other than the classical opioid receptors (μ, δ, κ) has been based on limited evidence, since only three genes for the three main receptors have been identified. The only one of these additional receptors to have been definitively identified is the zeta (ζ) opioid receptor, which has been shown to be a cellular growth factor modulator with met-enkephalin being the endogenous ligand. This receptor is now most commonly referred to as the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr).

=== Epsilon (ε) opioid receptor ===
Another postulated opioid receptor is the ε opioid receptor. The existence of this receptor was suspected after the endogenous opioid peptide beta-endorphin was shown to produce additional actions that did not seem to be mediated through any of the known opioid receptors. Activation of this receptor produces strong analgesia and release of met-enkephalin; a number of widely used opioid agonists, such as the μ agonist etorphine and the κ agonist bremazocine, have been shown to act as agonists for this effect (even in the presence of antagonists to their more well known targets), while buprenorphine has been shown to act as an epsilon antagonist. Several selective agonists and antagonists are now available for the putative epsilon receptor; however, efforts to locate a gene for this receptor have been unsuccessful, and epsilon-mediated effects were absent in μ/δ/κ &quot;triple knockout&quot; mice, suggesting the epsilon receptor is likely to be either a splice variant derived from alternate post-translational modification, or a heteromer derived from hybridization of two or more of the known opioid receptors.

== Mechanism of activation ==
Opioid receptors are a type of G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR). These receptors are distributed throughout the central nervous system and within the peripheral tissue of neural and non-neural origin. They are also located in high concentrations in the Periaqueductal gray, Locus coeruleus, and the Rostral ventromedial medulla. The receptors consist of an extracellular amino acid N-terminus, seven trans-membrane helical loops, three extracellular loops, three intracellular loops, and an intracellular carboxyl C-terminus. Three GPCR extracellular loops provide a compartment where signaling molecules can attach to generate a response. Heterotrimeric G protein contain three different sub-units, which include an alpha (α) subunit, a beta (β) subunit, and a gamma (γ) sub-unit. The gamma and beta sub-units are permanently bound together, producing a single Gβγ sub-unit. Heterotrimeric G proteins act as ‘molecular switches’, which play a key role in signal transduction, because they relay information from activated receptors to appropriate effector proteins. All G protein α sub-units contain palmitate, which is a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid, that is attached near the N-terminus through a labile, reversible thioester linkage to a cysteine amino acid. It is this palmitoylation that allows the G protein to interact with membrane phospholipids due to the hydrophobic nature of the alpha sub-units. The gamma sub-unit is also lipid modified and can attach to the plasma membrane as well. These properties of the two sub-units, allow the opioid receptor&#x27;s G protein to permanently interact with the membrane via lipid anchors.

When an agonistic ligand binds to the opioid receptor, a conformational change occurs, and the GDP molecule is released from the Gα sub-unit. This mechanism is complex, and is a major stage of the signal transduction pathway. When the GDP molecule is attached, the Gα sub-unit is in its inactive state, and the nucleotide-binding pocket is closed off inside the protein complex. However, upon ligand binding, the receptor switches to an active conformation, and this is driven by intermolecular rearrangement between the trans-membrane helices. The receptor activation releases an ‘ionic lock’ which holds together the cytoplasmic sides of transmembrane helices three and six, causing them to rotate. This conformational change exposes the intracellular receptor domains at the cytosolic side, which further leads to the activation of the G protein. When the GDP molecule dissociates from the Gα sub-unit, a GTP molecule binds to the free nucleotide-binding pocket, and the G protein becomes active. A Gα(GTP) complex is formed, which has a weaker affinity for the Gβγ sub-unit than the Gα(GDP) complex, causing the Gα sub-unit to separate from the Gβγ sub-unit, forming two sections of the G protein. The sub-units are now free to interact with effector proteins; however, they are still attached to the plasma membrane by lipid anchors. After binding, the active G protein sub-units diffuses within the membrane and acts on various intracellular effector pathways. This includes inhibiting neuronal adenylate cyclase activity, as well as increasing membrane hyper-polarisation. When the adenylyl cyclase enzyme complex is stimulated, it results in the formation of Cyclic Adenosine 3&#x27;, 5&#x27;-Monophosphate (cAMP), from Adenosine 5&#x27; Triphosphate (ATP). cAMP acts as a secondary messenger, as it moves from the plasma membrane into the cell and relays the signal.

cAMP binds to, and activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which is located intracellularly in the neuron. The PKA consists of a holoenzyme - it is a compound which becomes active due to the combination of an enzyme with a coenzyme. The PKA enzyme also contains two catalytic PKS-Cα subunits, and a regulator PKA-R subunit dimer. The PKA holoenzyme is inactive under normal conditions, however, when cAMP molecules that are produced earlier in the signal transduction mechanism combine with the enzyme, PKA undergoes a conformational change. This activates it, giving it the ability to catalyse substrate phosphorylation. CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) belongs to a family of transcription factors and is positioned in the nucleus of the neuron. When the PKA is activated, it phosphorylates the CREB protein (adds a high energy phosphate group) and activates it. The CREB protein binds to cAMP response elements CRE, and can either increase or decrease the transcription of certain genes. The cAMP/PKA/CREB signalling pathway described above is crucial in memory formation and pain modulation. It is also significant in the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation, which is a phenomenon that underlies synaptic plasticity - the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time.

Voltage-gated dependent calcium channel, (VDCCs), are key in the depolarisation of neurons, and play a major role in promoting the release of neurotransmitters. When agonists bind to opioid receptors, G proteins activate and dissociate into their constituent Gα and Gβγ sub-units. The Gβγ sub-unit binds to the intracellular loop between the two trans-membrane helices of the VDCC. When the sub-unit binds to the voltage-dependent calcium channel, it produces a voltage-dependent block, which inhibits the channel, preventing the flow of calcium ions into the neuron. Embedded in the cell membrane is also the G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel. When a Gβγ or Gα(GTP) molecule binds to the C-terminus of the potassium channel, it becomes active, and potassium ions are pumped out of the neuron. The activation of the potassium channel and subsequent deactivation of the calcium channel causes membrane hyperpolarization. This is when there is a change in the membrane&#x27;s potential, so that it becomes more negative. The reduction in calcium ions causes a reduction neurotransmitter release because calcium is essential for this event to occur. This means that neurotransmitters such as glutamate and substance P cannot be released from the presynaptic terminal of the neurons. These neurotransmitters are vital in the transmission of pain, so opioid receptor activation reduces the release of these substances, thus creating a strong analgesic effect.

<doc id="736409" wikidata="Q3179548" url="?curid=736409" title="2001 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 2001 Atlantic hurricane season was a fairly active Atlantic hurricane season that produced 17 tropical cyclones, 15 named storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. The season officially lasted from June 1, 2001, to November 30, 2001, dates which by convention limit the period of each year when tropical cyclones tend to form in the Atlantic Ocean basin. The season began with Tropical Storm Allison on June 4, and ended with Hurricane Olga, which dissipated on December 6.

The most damaging storms of the season were: Allison, which caused extensive flooding in Texas; Hurricane Iris, which struck Belize; and Hurricane Michelle, which left a trail of destruction across Cuba. Three tropical cyclones made landfall in the United States, three directly affected Canada, and three directly affected Mexico and Central America. Overall, the season caused 153 fatalities, and $11.44 billion (2001 USD) in damage. Due to their severe damage, the names &quot;Allison&quot;, &quot;Iris&quot;, and &quot;Michelle&quot; were retired by the World Meteorological Organization.

== Seasonal forecasts ==
Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts William M. Gray. Philip J. Klotzbach, and their associates at Colorado State University; and separately by NOAA forecasters.

Gray&#x27;s team defined the average number of storms per season (1950 to 2000) as 9.6 tropical storms, 5.9 hurricanes, 2.3 major hurricanes (storms reaching at least Category 3 strength in the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) and ACE Index 96.1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) defines a season as above-normal, near-normal or below-normal by a combination of the number of named storms, the number reaching hurricane strength, the number reaching major hurricane strength and ACE Index.

=== Pre-season forecasts ===
On December 7, 2000, Gray&#x27;s team issued its first extended-range forecast for the 2001 season, predicting above-average activity (13 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and about 4 of Category 3 or higher). It listed a 63 percent chance of at least one major hurricane striking the U.S. mainland. This included a 43 percent chance of at least one major hurricane strike on the East Coast, including the Florida peninsula, and a 36 percent chance of at least one such strike on the Gulf Coast from the Florida Panhandle westward. The potential for major hurricane activity in the Caribbean was forecast to near average.

On April 5, 2001, a new forecast was issued, calling for 12 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. The increase in the forecast was attributed to the warm sea surface temperatures, although the agency noted that the season would likely not be as active as previous ones due to the effect of a weak to moderate El Nino. The estimated potential for at least one major hurricane to affect the U.S. was upped slightly to 65 percent; the East Coast potential also went up slightly, and from the Florida Panhandle westward to Brownsville, Texas, the probability remained nearly the same.

=== Mid-season forecasts ===
On August 7, 2001, Gray&#x27;s team issued their first mid-season forecast for the 2001 season, keeping the forecast number at 12 named storms, with 7 becoming hurricanes and 3 becoming a major hurricane, noting that sea surface temperatures and sea level pressures continued to be favorable for above-average hurricane activity. The estimated potential for at least one major hurricane to affect the U.S. was upped slightly once again to 69 percent; the East Coast potential also went up slightly to 50%, and from the Florida Panhandle westward to Brownsville, Texas, the probability was also upped slightly.

On August 8, 2001, NOAA revised its season estimate slightly upwards to nine to twelve named storms, of which 6 to 8 were to be hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes. The agency noted that sea surface temperatures continued to be favorable for above-average hurricane activity, and due to the likelihood that El Nino would not develop during the peak of the season, there was a reduced likelihood of a below-average year.

== Seasonal summary ==
The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 2001. It was an above-average season in which 17 tropical cyclones formed. Fifteen depressions attained tropical storm status, and nine of these reached hurricane status. Four hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes. Favorable sea surface temperatures and sea-level pressures were the main factors in the season being above-average. The season would mark the end of a streak of four consecutive above-average seasons, beginning in 1998. This remained a record until six consecutive seasons featured above-average activity from 2016 to 2021. Four tropical cyclones during the season would degenerate in the deep tropics but later re-develop. Four other systems were classified as subtropical cyclones at some point in their duration, though each later became fully tropical systems. Overall, the Atlantic tropical cyclones of 2001 collectively resulted in 153 deaths and around $11.94 billion in damage. The season ended on November 30, 2001.

Tropical cyclogenesis began in June, with Tropical Storm Allison forming just offshore Texas on June 5. After Allison transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on June 17, no further activity occurred until Tropical Depression Two developed on July 11. However, the depression dissipated the following day. Another break in activity ensued, which ended on August 2, when Tropical Storm Barry formed in the Gulf of Mexico. August featured two other tropical storms, Chantal and Dean.

Five systems formed in September, of which four become a hurricane, while one remained a tropical depression. October featured an equal number of systems, of which all five attained at least tropical storm intensity. One, Hurricane Iris, attained the highest sustained winds of any storm in 2001, at , and devastated southern Belize on October 9. Another, Hurricane Michelle, attained the lowest barometric pressure of any storm that year, at , and cut a path of destruction across Cuba on November 4. Two additional systems developed in November, Hurricane Noel and Hurricane Olga. Olga dissipated on December 4, ending seasonal activity.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 110, above the 1950–2000 average of 96.1. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding , which is the threshold for tropical storm status.

== Systems ==

=== Tropical Storm Allison ===
A tropical wave over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico developed into Tropical Storm Allison at 12:00 UTC on June 5 about south of Galveston, Texas. The cyclone strengthened and peaked with winds of six hours later. At 21:00 UTC on June 5, Allison made landfall near Freeport, Texas. It drifted northward through the state, turned to the south, and re-entered the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical depression on June 10. Allison then transitioned into a subtropical depression. The storm continued towards the east-northeast, made landfall on Louisiana early on June 11, and briefly became a subtropical storm despite being inland. Crossing the southeast United States and Mid-Atlantic, Allison emerged into the Atlantic at the Delmarva Peninsula on June 17. After temporarily re-attaining subtropical storm status, Allison interacted with a cold front offshore New England and became extratropical. Early on June 19, the remnant extratropical low dissipated near Nova Scotia.

Allison was the first storm since Tropical Storm Frances in 1998 to affect the northern Texas coastline. A major flood disaster occurred throughout its path from Texas to the Mid-Atlantic. Houston, Texas, and its vicinity suffered the brunt of the impact, as over of rain fell there when Allison stalled over southeastern Texas. In this area, flooding related to Allison destroyed or severely damaged more than 14,000 homes, while at least 51,430 others experienced some degree of damage. Floodwaters also entered over 95,000 vehicles and 1,700 businesses. The storm killed 41 people, including 27 who drowned. Overall, Allison caused about $8.5 billion in damage (2001 USD), making it the costliest and second-deadliest tropical storm on record in the United States.
=== Tropical Depression Two ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on July 7. Moving westward, the system displayed signs of a weak low-level circulation beginning on July 10, and after deep convection formed on the following day, a tropical depression developed around 18:00 UTC about east of the Windward Islands. A subtropical ridge north of the depression caused it to move west-northwestward at roughly . Vertical wind shear prevented the cyclone from intensifying beyond sustained winds of and an atmospheric pressure of , with dissipation occurring late on July 12 approximately east of the Windward Islands. The remnant tropical wave reached the Lesser Antilles on July 13 and July 14.
=== Tropical Storm Barry ===
On July 24, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and tracked westward. The wave entered the Caribbean Sea on July 29 and gained in organization and convection, before reaching the Gulf of Mexico on August 1. By the following day, a tropical depression developed about west-northwest of Key West, Florida, and soon strengthened into Tropical Storm Barry. After fluctuations in intensity, including when it weakened to a tropical depression on August 4, the system attained peak winds of in the Gulf of Mexico late on August 5. Around 05:00 UTC on the next day, Barry made landfall near Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, at the same intensity. The storm weakened to a tropical depression over southern Alabama about seven hours later, before degenerating into a remnant low over Mississippi early on August 7. The remnant low continued north-northwestward until dissipating over Missouri on August 8.

The storm affected Florida; rainfall peaked at at Tallahassee, and winds gusts topped out at . Three people in Florida were killed by the storm, and total damage is estimated at $30 million (2001 USD).
=== Tropical Storm Chantal ===
On August 11, a tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa. Moving generally westward, the wave organized into a tropical depression about east of the Windward Islands on August 14. The depression moved rapidly westward and degenerated into an open wave sometime on August 16 while still well east of the Windward Islands. However, after reaching the southeast Caribbean, a circulation re-developed while the system was situated south of Saint Croix on August 17. With tropical storm-force winds, the system was reclassified as Tropical Storm Chantal. The cyclone strengthened to reach sustained winds of twice in the Caribbean. Early on August 21, Chantal made landfall near the Belize–Mexico border at that intensity. The cyclone weakened to a tropical depression over Campeche on August 22, before dissipating over Tabasco several hours later.

The tropical wave associated with Chantal caused two deaths in Trinidad due to a lightning strike. In Belize, abnormally high tides along the coast damaged piers and seawalls. The storm produced a wind gust of in Caye Caulker, although stronger winds were possible in a convective band to the north. Winds and flooding due to heavy rainfall left damage to agricultural and infrastructural sectors. Overall, Belize suffered nearly $4 million in damage. Heavy rain fell in parts of Mexico, particularly in Quintana Roo, with up to observed at Othón P. Blanco. This led to mudslides, leaving some areas isolated.
=== Tropical Storm Dean ===
Between August 14 and August 15, a large tropical wave passed over Dakar, Senegal. The wave gradually acquired convection as it moved westward across the Atlantic. While crossing the Leeward Islands on August 22, a reconnaissance aircraft observed tropical storm-force winds and a surface circulation. Thus, Tropical Storm Dean developed at 12:00 UTC near Saint Croix. After crossing the Virgin Islands and entering the Atlantic, strong wind shear caused Dean to degenerate into an open tropical wave near the Bahamas on August 23. The remnants turned northward, and redeveloped on August 26 to the north of Bermuda. Located over warm waters and in an area of favorable conditions, Dean steadily strengthened while moving to the northeast and peaked just below hurricane status on August 28. The storm subsequently weakened over cooler waters, and became extratropical southeast of Newfoundland later that day. A frontal low absorbed the extratropical system on August 29.

The precursor wave associated with Dean dropped heavy rainfall in the Lesser Antilles, particularly in Puerto Rico. There, up to of precipitation fell in Salinas, causing widespread flooding in the eastern and southern portions of the main island. Floodwaters inundated many highways and entered 1,320 homes. Damage in Puerto Rico totaled about $7.7 million. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, winds downed some trees, caused power outages, and damaged a few roads. Later, Dean produced tropical storm-force wind gusts and light to moderate rainfall in Bermuda and Newfoundland.
=== Hurricane Erin ===
A westward-moving tropical wave quickly organized into a tropical depression about of the Cape Verde Islands around 18:00 UTC on September 1. By early the next day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Erin and reached an initial peak with winds of on September 3. However, two days later, wind shear caused Erin to degenerate into a remnant low-pressure area. Erin re-generated into a tropical depression by 18:00 UTC on September 6 and re-intensified into a tropical storm about 24 hours later around north-northeast of the northernmost Leeward Islands. The cyclone strengthened into a hurricane on September 9 while moving northwestward. The hurricane quickly intensified and reached peak winds of later that day. Short-wave troughs turned Erin to the northeast by September 11. After passing just east of Cape Race, Newfoundland, Erin became extratropical on September 15. The extratropical remnant continued northeastward and lost its identity near Greenland on September 17.

Tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for Bermuda beginning on September 8, which were discontinued two days later after the storm bypassed the island. Wind gusts on Bermuda reached , felling several trees onto power lines. The storm produced large waves along the East Coast of the United States. Later, Erin brushed Newfoundland, producing sustained wind speeds of , with a gust of at Cape Race, while rainfall in the province peaked at on Sagona Island. Along the coast, the passage of the storm led to wave heights of up to .
=== Hurricane Felix ===

A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on September 7 near the Cape Verde islands, which degenerated back into a tropical wave the next day due to strong shear. It redeveloped back into a tropical depression on September 10, and intensified into Tropical Storm Felix the next day while tracking generally northward. By September 13, it intensified into a hurricane, and subsequently it underwent rapid deepening, becoming a major hurricane on September 14 with peak winds of . By that time, Felix had turned to the northeast, and subsequently entered an area of unfavorable conditions. The hurricane gradually weakened, deteriorating to a tropical storm on September 17. Cool waters and higher wind shear caused additional weakening while Felix nearly stalled to the southwest of the Azores. Late on September 18, the storm weakened to a tropical depression, and early the next day Felix dissipated.
=== Hurricane Gabrielle ===
A weak low- to mid-level trough remained nearly stationary offshore the Southeastern United States in early September. A cut-off low developed over Florida on September 9, while an associated surface low formed by late on September 11. The system became a tropical depression around 18:00 UTC about west-southwest of Naples, Florida. The depression drifted west-southwest and slowly intensified, before doubling-back to the east-northeast and strengthening into Tropical Storm Gabrielle on September 13. Gabrielle curved northeastward and reached sustained winds of before making landfall near Venice, Florida, on the following day. After weakening slightly, Gabrielle emerged into the Atlantic near Titusville on September 15, accelerated to the northeast, and strengthened, becoming a Category 1 hurricane two days later. Colder water temperatures then weakened Gabrielle to a tropical storm on September 18, followed by an extratropical transition on September 19 well south of Newfoundland. The extratropical low was absorbed by a larger extratropical low over the far north Atlantic on September 21.

Hurricane Gabrielle produced moderate winds along coastal areas of western Florida, reaching at Venice. The tide flooded the northern shoreline of Charlotte Harbor and at the entrance to the Peace River, while further to the south a surge of greater than inundated the barrier island at Fort Myers Beach and flooded some cars. Gabrielle brushed the eastern coast of Newfoundland; the rainfall set the all time six-hour precipitation record at St. John&#x27;s, with a total of . Hundreds of homes and buildings were damaged by the passage of Gabrielle, totaling several million Canadian dollars in damage.
=== Tropical Depression Nine ===

A tropical depression formed from a tropical wave in the Caribbean on September 19, north-northwest of San Andres Island. It attained a maximum strength of , and made landfall near Puerto Cabezas on September 20. After losing its closed circulation over land, it reformed into Hurricane Juliette in the East Pacific.

In El Salvador, heavy rains from the depression helped alleviate drought conditions; however, flooding also inundated 200 homes in San Salvador along the Acelhuate River. Fifteen farms were inundated by flooding, five of which were destroyed. Seventy people evacuated to shelters set up after the storm by the local Red Cross and armed forces. Military crews were quickly deployed to help clean up the damages on September 22.
=== Hurricane Humberto ===
Hurricane Humberto formed from an area of low pressure generated by Hurricane Gabrielle. The low formed into a tropical depression on September 21 while south of Bermuda, tracking northwest, and was named Tropical Storm Humberto the next day. It began moving north, and then northeast as it passed Bermuda and strengthened into a hurricane. Humberto headed over the colder waters of the far north Atlantic Ocean, and dissipated quickly on September 27.
=== Hurricane Iris ===
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa in late September. The wave moved generally westward across the Atlantic and organized into Tropical Depression Eleven approximately southeast of Barbados on October 4. It traveled across the Windward Islands, and intensified into Tropical Storm Iris while over the eastern Caribbean on October 5. Iris continued to the west and intensified. After passing just south of Jamaica, Iris reached Category 4 hurricane strength on October 8 to the north of Honduras. Around 02:00 UTC on October 9, the hurricane made landfall near Monkey River Town, Belize, with peak winds of . Iris rapidly weakened and dissipated over extreme southeastern Mexico several hours later. Although Iris&#x27;s circulation dissipated, its remnants contributed to the development of Tropical Storm Manuel in the eastern Pacific Ocean on October 10.

Rainfall from the outerbands of Iris caused flooding in the Dominican Republic, resulting in the evacuation of 35 families after rivers exceeded their banks. Three people died when a landslide destroyed a home in Santo Domingo. Iris destroyed two homes and deroofed two others in Jamaica. The storm produced an storm surge along the coast of Belize. A total of 3,718 homes were either damaged or destroyed, mostly in the Stann Creek and Toledo districts, rendering about 15,000 people homeless. Severe losses to agriculture was also reported, including the destruction of of bananas, of rice, and of corn. Iris caused 24 deaths in Belize – with 20 occurring when the dive boat &quot;Wave Dancer&quot; capsized near Big Creek – and at least $250 million in damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;appeal 33/01&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Flash floods and mudslides in Guatemala damaged 2,500 homes and 26 schools and killed 8 people. In Mexico, flooding due to heavy rains from Iris damaged 120 homes in Oaxaca and caused 2 deaths.
=== Tropical Storm Jerry ===

A tropical wave exited Africa on October 1, moving westward. Rainbands and convection gradually increased, and the NHC designated the system as Tropical Depression Twelve. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Jerry early on October 7, aided by low wind shear. Continuing westward due to a ridge to it north, Jerry strengthened further as it approached the Lesser Antilles, reaching peak winds of around . Forecast models indicated the system could reach hurricane status within two to three days under favorable conditions. Jerry passed just south of Barbados at its peak intensity, before its structure began to degrade. Reconnaissance aircraft indicated a possible reformation of the center, as data indicated multiple low-level rotations on a northeast to southwest axis. As Jerry entered the eastern Caribbean Sea early on October 8 after bypassing St. Vincent, its forward speed increased to . Moderate vertical wind shear from the northwest developed, disrupting the upper-level outflow. Jerry continued to deteriorate, and later on October 8, aircraft data indicated the system had weakened into a broad area of low pressure with scattered squalls mainly to the east of the remnant center. Jerry then dissipated shortly afterward approximately 230 miles south of Puerto Rico, with the remnants moving westward.

The threat of the storm prompted tropical storm warnings and watches in the Lesser Antilles. Jerry caused minimal damage as it moved through the Windward Islands and Lesser Antilles. A station at Martinique reported sustained ten-minute winds of on October 8. Some downpours and high winds were reported. No ships reported tropical storm-force winds, though Barbados reported a minimum pressure of 1007 mb.
=== Hurricane Karen ===
A cold front and an upper level trough interacted on October 10 to the south of Bermuda, and formed an extratropical storm. The storm passed near Bermuda on October 12, producing hurricane-force winds on the island. It then organized, becoming a subtropical cyclone on October 12 and a tropical cyclone on October 13. Karen strengthened to reach winds as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, and after weakening over cooler waters, it made landfall on Nova Scotia as a tropical storm. It quickly became extratropical.

Tropical Storm Karen produced light to moderate winds across Atlantic Canada, peaking at with a gust of in Cape George in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia, along with a report in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Later, in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, the storm system that absorbed Hurricane Noel produced strong winds that downed several trees and power lines which resulted in power outages.
=== Tropical Storm Lorenzo ===

An upper-level tropospheric trough persisted in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, developing a circulation by October 26 which quickly organized. On October 27, it developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about south-southwest of the western Azores. Moving westward, the depression was forecast to attain winds of at least , although it failed to reach that intensity. Banding features developed over the storm, and on October 30 it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Lorenzo. By early on October 31, convection had begun to separate from the circulation, and later in the day Lorenzo became extratropical. The remnants of Lorenzo merged with a frontal system about west of the Azores.
=== Hurricane Michelle ===
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on October 16. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic and the Caribbean, before developing into a tropical depression along the east coast of Nicaragua on October 29. Convection increased after the depression entered the Caribbean, and the system intensified into Tropical Storm Michelle on November 1. It strengthened further, becoming a hurricane on November 2 and reaching Category 4 status on November 4, becoming one of only four tropical cyclones on record to reach that intensity in the month of November. Michelle made landfall in Cuba twice, first on Cayo Largo del Sur with peak winds of and then on the mainland near the Bay of Pigs at a slightly weaker intensity. Michelle was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike Cuba since Hurricane Fox in 1952. The storm rapidly weakened and fell to Category 1 intensity as it emerged into the Atlantic early on November 5. Michelle then moved quickly northeastward through the Bahamas and struck Andros and Eleuthera before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. A frontal system absorbed the remnants of Michelle to the south of Bermuda by early on November 7.

The system that eventually became Michelle dropped torrential rains in several countries, causing at least six deaths in Honduras and four deaths in Nicaragua. An additional 26 people were reported missing in Central America. Torrential precipitation was also reported in Jamaica, with of rainfall observed at one location. Flooding and mudslides damaged about 500 homes beyond repairs, while 561 others were impacted to some degree. The storm caused five deaths and $18 million in damage in Jamaica. Michelle went on to affect Cuba, where the storm produced waves. Rainfall amounts up to were recorded across the island. Sustained winds peaked at at Cayo Largo del Sur, while wind gusts reached at at the same location and in Jagüey Grande. The hurricane demolished 12,579 homes and damaged 166,515 others. Overall, Michelle caused five deaths and about $2 billion in damage in Cuba. Major damage also occurred in the Bahamas, totaling about $300 million.
=== Hurricane Noel ===
A non-tropical frontal low developed from a cold front on November 1 to the west of the Azores. It intensified while moving west-northwestward and gradually dissipated its frontal structure. It became a subtropical storm on November 4 about south of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Operationally, the storm was considered a non-tropical low, and the National Hurricane Center did not begin issuing advisories until it became a tropical cyclone. It moved slowly northward as convection organized into a ring around the center. As a result of a ship reporting hurricane-force winds near the center, and due to the development of a weak mid-level warm core, the subtropical cyclone was reclassified as Hurricane Noel on November 5. Increasing westerly wind shear limited convection near the center, and Noel weakened to a tropical storm early on November 6. Progressively cooler water temperatures contributed to weakening, and Noel became extratropical later on November 6 about southeast of Newfoundland. The extratropical remnant continued to the northeast and was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm later that day.
=== Hurricane Olga ===
Hurricane Olga formed as a subtropical cyclone on November 24 and meandered westward where it reached hurricane status on November 26. The storm attained peak winds of before turning southeastward and weakening back into a tropical storm. Olga dissipated as a tropical cyclone on December 6 east of the Bahamas.
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the north Atlantic in 2001. This is the same list used for the 1995 season, except for &quot;Lorenzo&quot;, &quot;Michelle&quot;, &quot;Olga&quot;, and &quot;Rebekah&quot;, which replaced &quot;Luis&quot;, &quot;Marilyn&quot;, &quot;Opal&quot;, and &quot;Roxanne&quot;, respectively. Each new name except for &quot;Rebekah&quot; was used for the first (and only in the case of &quot;Michelle&quot;) time in 2001.

=== Retirement ===

The World Meteorological Organization retired the names &quot;Allison&quot;, &quot;Iris&quot;, and &quot;Michelle&quot; from the Atlantic hurricane name lists after the 2001 season on account of their destructiveness. They were replaced with &quot;Andrea&quot;, &quot;Ingrid&quot;, and &quot;Melissa&quot;, respectively, for the 2007 season. &quot;Allison&quot; became the first Atlantic tropical storm to have its name retired.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 2001 USD.

<text>The Mbochi (or M&#x27;Boshi) are a Bantu ethnic group in Central Africa. Their language originates from the regions of the African Great Lakes where they began, after a long migration from the east to the centre, over the years, until 1850. This central African ethnic group as a population is concentrated in the northern region of the Republic of the Congo. The current Congolese president, Denis Sassou-Nguesso, as well as many senior government officials, belong to this group. Mbochi is the traditional language spoken in the northern regions of la Cuvette (districts of Boundji; Ngoko; d&#x27;Owando, d&#x27;Oyo; Bokouélé; Tongo; Tchikapika and of Mossaka) also in the region of the Plateaux (districts of Olombo; Abala, Allembé and Ogogni).

<text>Zond 1 was a spacecraft of the Soviet Zond program. It was the second Soviet research spacecraft to reach Venus, although communications had failed by that time. It carried a spherical landing capsule, containing experiments for chemical analysis of the atmosphere, gamma-ray measurements of surface rocks, a photometer, temperature and pressure gauges, and a motion/rocking sensor in case it landed in water. An experimental Ion thruster was also carried for evaluation.

==History==
At least three previous Soviet planetary probes had been lost due to malfunctions of the ullage rockets (BOZ) on the Blok L stage, but an investigation found that the problem was easily resolved. The spacecraft, a &quot;Venera 3MV-1&quot;, was launched on April 2, 1964, from Tyuratam and this time the launch vehicle performed flawlessly. During the cruise phase, a slow leak from a cracked sensor window caused the electronics compartment to lose air pressure. This was a serious problem as Soviet electronics relied on vacuum tubes which would overheat without cooling air. An ill-timed command from ground control turned on its radio system while there was still a rarefied atmosphere inside, causing the electronics to short out by corona discharge. Chief Designer Sergei Korolev was upset at the failure of the mission and demanded higher quality control from the OKB-1 Bureau, including X-rays to test for pressure leaks.

By mid-April, the electronics in the main spacecraft had completely failed and all signal transmission ceased, but communication via the lander could still be performed, and space radiation and atomic-hydrogen spectrometer measurements were received. The experimental ion thruster-based attitude control system were also tested but found to operate erratically, possibly due to the loss of pressure in the electronics compartment. The star trackers in the spacecraft were also used to align it for a course-correction burn, but the second one was off by 65 feet per second (20 meters per second). Also one of the star trackers failed, forcing ground controllers to place Zond 1 into a spin-stabilization mode. However, all communications had failed by May 14. It passed from Venus on July 14, 1964.

A similar design of landing capsule was used in Venera 3.

===Naming===

Zond missions were presented as engineering tests by the Soviet Union and to an extent at least that may have been the case. Western observers at the time suggested that the name was used as a cover for failed missions in the same manner that Kosmos designations were used for missions that failed to leave Earth orbit. More recently it has been suggested that &quot;Zond&quot; was genuinely the internal program designation for engineering tests but Zond 1 would have been upgraded to Venera had it been more successful. Zond 1 was actually the second craft that was meant to carry the Zond name, but its predecessor failed to leave Earth orbit and was designated Kosmos 21.

<text>The Teke people or Bateke, also known as the Tyo or Tio, are a Bantu Central African ethnic group that speak the Teke languages and that mainly inhabit the south, north, and center of the Republic of the Congo, the west of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with a minority in the south-east of Gabon. Omar Bongo, who was President of Gabon in the late 20th century, was a Teke.

==History==
As part of the Bantu expansion, the Teke established a powerful kingdom in what is now the Republic of Congo in the first millennium C.E. with religion as the basis of legitimacy.

The Teke Kingdom flourished around the 12th and 13th centuries, but by the 15th had become a vassal of the Kingdom of Kongo and faced encroachment on their frontiers by numerous other peoples. Initially occupying the area between Manyanga and the Malebo Pool, the Teke were gradually pushed north by Kongolese raids and emigration, itself a product of the violence of the Atlantic slave trade, into the Batéké Plateau.

The French first arrived in what is now the Republic of Congo in the 1880s, and occupied the Congo until 1960. During this colonial period, traditional Teke ceremonies were very few. Under the French, the Teke people suffered heavily from colonial exploitation. The French government was gathering land for its own use and damaging traditional economies, including massive displacement of people. The Teke Kingdom signed a treaty with the French in 1883 that gave the French land in return for protection. Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza oversaw French interests. A small settlement along the Congo River was renamed Brazzaville and eventually became the federal capital of French Equatorial Africa. In the 1960s the Teke people started to regain their independence and traditional life started to flourish once again.

==Ethnography and traditions==
The name of the tribe shows what the occupation of the tribe was: trading. The word &quot;teke&quot; means &#x27;to sell&#x27;. The economy of the Teke is mainly based on farming maize, millet and tobacco, but the Teke are also hunters, skilled fishermen and traders. The Teke lived in an area across Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon. The mfumu was the head of the family and his prestige grew as family members increased. The Teke sometimes chose blacksmiths as chiefs. The blacksmiths were important in the community and this occupation was passed down from father to son. In terms of life of the Teke, the village chief was chosen as religious leader, he was the most important tribal member and he would keep all the potions and spiritual bones that would be used in traditional ceremonies to speak to the spirits and rule safety over his people. 

Teke masks are mainly used in traditional dancing ceremonies such as wedding, funeral and initiation ceremonies of young men entering adult hood. The mask is also used as a social and political identifier of social structure within a tribe or family. The Teke or Kidumu people are well known for their Teke masks, which are round flat disk-like wooden masks that have abstract patterns and geometric motifs with horizontal lines that are painted in earthly colors, mainly dark blue, blacks, browns and clays. The traditional Teke masks all have triangle shaped noses. The masks have narrow eye slits to enable the masker to see without being seen. They have holes pierced along the edge for the attachment of a woven raffia dress with feathers and fibers. The mask is held in place with a bite bar at the back that the wearer holds in his teeth. The dress would add to the mask&#x27;s costume and conceal the wearer. The masks originate from the upper Ogowe region.

==Notable Bateke and notable people associated with the Bateke==
*Omar Bongo (1935–2009), President of Gabon
*Patience Dabany, First Lady of Gabon (1967–1987)
*Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of Gabon (2009–2023)
*Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, Interim President of Gabon (2023–)
*Charles David Ganao (1928–2012), Prime Minister of the Republic of Congo (1996–1997)
*Ngalifourou (1864–1956), a queen of the Teke

==Bateke dogs and cats==
The Teke historically breed dogs and cats for domestic purposes. The &quot;chien Bateke&quot; is a small lean hunting dog with a short, medium gray coat. The &quot;chat Bateke&quot; is large cat with nearly the same coloring as the dog. These animals constitute landraces, rather than formal breeds (they are not recognized by any major fancier and breeder organizations). A majority of domesticated cats and dogs in areas bordering the Congo River are of these breeds, though ownership of domesticated animals in general is rare in the region.

<text>The Kösener Senioren-Convents-Verband (abbreviation: KSCV) is the oldest association of German, Austrian and Swiss Studentenverbindungen or students fraternities. It comprises roughly 105 German, Austrian and a Flemish (Belgian), Hungarian and Swiss &quot;Corps&quot;, all of which are based upon the principle of tolerance.

==History==
The KSCV was founded in Jena, Thuringia, Germany in 1848. It soon moved to Bad Kösen in the northernmost German wine growing area Saale-Unstrut. Its annual meetings are held Bad Kösen and in the nearby Rudelsburg.

=== Nazi rule ===
During the National Socialist regime of the Third Reich (Ger. Drittes Reich), a majority of member corps of the KSCV (namely , , , , and ) refused to exclude Jewish members or to cooperate with the National Socialist youth movements, which were intended to replace the corps and other non-compliant student associations. Inevitably, this policy resulted in the forced closure and disbandment of the corps and, eventually, the KSCV. 

The dissolution of the KSCV was further ensured by Hitler after May 1935, in which Corps Saxo-Borussia Heidelberg members had interfered with a broadcast speech by Hitler by singing satirical songs against the Nazis. The Hitler Youth was a rival organization which gained supremacy as the premiere youth organization in Germany under the Third Reich.

=== Reorganization ===
The KSCV, which had an ambivalent relationship with the Nazi government, was reconstituted by 1950 primarily in West Germany, with fraternities from the now-Soviet-occupied East Germany relocating to the West. Upon reunification, the Eastern fraternities returned to their original locations.

<doc id="736423" wikidata="Q1384109" url="?curid=736423" title="Exodus (Uris novel)">
<text>Exodus is a historical novel by American novelist Leon Uris about the founding of the State of Israel beginning with a compressed retelling of the voyages of the 1947 immigration ship &quot;Exodus&quot; and describing the histories of the various main characters and the ties of their personal lives to the birth of the new Jewish state.

Published by Doubleday in 1958, it became an international publishing phenomenon, the biggest bestseller in the United States since &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1936) and was still at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list eight months after its release.

Otto Preminger directed a 1960 film based on the novel, featuring Paul Newman as Ari Ben Canaan. It focuses mainly on the escape from Cyprus and subsequent events in Palestine.

==The origins of &quot;Exodus&quot;==

Uris covered the Suez Crisis as a war correspondent in 1956 and there are two stories told about how he came to write the work. The first suggests Uris, motivated by an intense interest in Israel, financed his own research for the novel by selling the film rights in advance to MGM and writing articles about the Sinai campaign. It has also been reported that the book involved two years of research, extensive travel including 12,000 miles within Israel, and 1,200 interviews.

Uris would say of his thinking:

There is a whole school of American Jewish writers who spend their time damning their fathers, hating their mothers, wringing their hands and wondering why they were born. This isn&#x27;t art or literature. It&#x27;s psychiatry. These writers are professional apologists. Every year you find one of their works on the best-seller list. Their work is obnoxious and makes me sick to my stomach. I wrote &quot;Exodus&quot; because I was just sick of apologizing—or feeling that it was necessary to apologize.

Others claim Uris was approached by a public relations firm in the mid-1950s with the idea of a writing a propaganda novel on behalf of Israel.

Whatever the genesis of the work, it initiated a new sympathy for the newly established State of Israel. The book has been widely praised as successful propaganda for Israel. Uris acknowledged writing from a pro-Israel perspective after the book&#x27;s publication, stating that: &quot;I set out to tell a story of Israel. I am definitely biased. I am definitely pro-Jewish,&quot; and the then–Prime Minister of Israel, David Ben-Gurion remarked that: &quot;as a piece of propaganda, it&#x27;s the greatest thing ever written about Israel&quot;.

The book also contributed greatly to general knowledge of the Holocaust for Jews and non-Jews alike, bringing more awareness to the general public of the plight of the Jews under Nazi Germany.

==Plot==
===Summary===
In 1946, American foreign correspondent Mark Parker and American nurse Kitty Fremont reunite as old friends. Kitty is an American volunteer at the Karaolos internment camp on Cyprus, where thousands of Jews—Holocaust survivors—are being held by the British, who will not let them go to Palestine. Separately, another pair of friends, Jewish fighters Ari Ben Canaan and David Ben Ami, also reunite.

Ari obtains a cargo ship, which became the SS Exodus, with the intention to smuggle 302 Jewish children out of the camp for an illegal voyage to Mandate Palestine before being discovered by military authorities. When the British learn the refugees are in a ship in the harbor of Famagusta, they blockade the harbor and prevent it from sailing. The refugees stage a hunger strike, during which the camp&#x27;s doctor dies. Ari has wired the ship with explosives and threatens to blow up the ship and the refugees if the British try to board. When the British attempt to gain time by trying to negotiate, Ari announces that every day 10 children will commit suicide on deck for the world to see. The British relent and allow the &quot;Exodus&quot; safe passage.

A generation previously, Ari&#x27;s father Jossi and uncle Yakov came to Palestine following the Pogroms in the Russian Empire. They are disappointed because the Jews don&#x27;t farm and they take money from overseas philanthropists. The brothers change their names to Akiva (Yakov) and Barak (Jossi). Jossi tries to understand the Palestinians, using demonstrations of force to gain their respect. The Balfour Declaration is issued during World War I. The two brothers become senior in the Jewish government, and debate using terrorism to fight the British authorities.

The United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine is approved, and the conflict with the Palestinians begins in earnest. The Haganah forces prevail over the three Arab generals who vie for fame. They adopt the tactic of siege warfare. Jewish victory at Safed, incorrectly rumored to be through use of an atom bomb, frightens the Palestinian fighters, who flee to Lebanon. Israel proclaims its independence and gradually defeats the Arab nations.

===Themes===
The main plot of the novel, writes Bonnie Helms, involves a &quot;story of great courage.&quot; Among the characters are &quot;freedom fighters&quot; Ari and Barak Ben Canaan and Dov Landau, whose stories are told in flashbacks. American nurse Kitty Fremont and German refugee Karen Hansen work alongside them to help defeat the British blockade of Palestine. The novel includes several love stories, although they often take place in surroundings of violence and terrorism. &quot;Uris gives the reader a strong sense of the past, present, and the future of the Jewish people,&quot; states Helms.

The personal stories in &quot;Exodus&quot; inspired its characters to seek their meaning and identity in relation to their social settings. Those settings were composed of their previous personal experiences, which were then grounded in both religion and geography. According to William Darby, &quot;The leading characters in &quot;Exodus&quot; only find romantic happiness when they understand that they must conjoin nationalistic, religious and personal aims.&quot;

Years after the success of the book, Uris explains why he thinks it received such an enthusiastic reception:
==Characters==
=== Ari Ben Canaan ===
Ari Ben Canaan, a sabra born and raised on a kibbutz, goes on to become one of the mainstays of the Israeli freedom movement. The handsome Ben Canaan is described as six feet and three inches tall, with dark hair and ice-blue eyes. 
His father, Barak Ben Canaan (formerly Jossi Rabinsky, born in the Russian Pale of Settlement), heads the Jewish Agency for Palestine. His uncle Akiva (formerly Yakov Rabinsky) leads the &quot;Maccabees&quot;, a militant organization (based on the Irgun). The brothers came to Palestine after their father was murdered in a pogrom.

As a young man, Ari was in love with a young woman, Dafna, who was tortured, raped, and murdered by Arabs. Dafna later becomes the namesake of the youth village, &quot;Gan Dafna&quot;, around which a large part of the story unfolds. As part of the Mossad Aliyah Bet (an organization which organized Jewish immigration to Palestine), Ari is extremely creative in devising techniques to bring Jews from all over the world to Palestine – more than allowed by the British quota. During World War II, he served as an officer in the Jewish Brigade of the British army, and he uses this experience to benefit his activities. This is his main occupation until Israel gains freedom, when he joins the Israeli army and is assigned to the Negev desert. He sees himself as part of a new breed of Jew who will not &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;. There are similarities to his character and Moshe Dayan, the Israeli military leader and politician; many parallels can be drawn between Ari and Dayan: both the fictional Ari and the real-life Dayan were trained by the same British General and had similar World War II experiences. Ben Canaan is also reported, however, to be based upon Yehudah Arazi. His character most likely was based on Yossi Harel, the commander of the &quot;Exodus 1947&quot; operation and a leading member of the Israeli intelligence community.

===Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Fremont===
Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Fremont is described in the novel as being tall, blonde, blue-eyed, and beautiful. An American nurse newly widowed, Kitty meets Ari Ben Canaan in Cyprus. Grieving for her lost husband and the recent death of her daughter from polio, Kitty develops a maternal attachment toward Karen Hansen Clement, a German refugee in a Cyprus displaced persons (DP) camp. This attachment and her attraction toward Ben Canaan result in her becoming, initially with reluctance, involved in the freedom struggle. She eventually becomes irritated at Ari&#x27;s lack of emotion towards violent deaths, but comes to understand and accept his dedication to Israel.

===Mark Parker===
Mark Parker is an American journalist and Kitty Fremont&#x27;s friend. He is credited as the whistleblower of the &quot;Exodus&quot; after it left on its voyage to Palestine, as a blackmail against the British.

===Bruce Sutherland===
Bruce Sutherland is a British military officer (rank of brigadier) whose mother was Jewish. After a lifetime of soldiering, he is posted to Cyprus, with instructions to maintain security at the detention camps. Like many British aristocrats he has a stifling, formal manner of speech. Internally, he is torn between his sympathies with the Jews he is required to guard and his duties as a British officer; the horrors he witnessed when his battalion liberated Bergen-Belsen is also a factor. He retires from the army at his own request after a mass escape engineered and led by Ari Ben Canaan. Despite this, he moves to Palestine to settle, becomes good friends with Ben Canaan, and acts as a very unofficial military advisor.

===Karen Hansen Clement===
Karen Hansen Clement, described as tall, with long brown hair and green eyes, is a German teenager who was brought up for a while by foster parents in Denmark. She was sent there by her family when Hitler rose to power in Germany. Her family was subsequently interned in concentration camps, where her mother and two younger brothers die. Before she is transported to Israel, Karen is placed in a Cypriot refugee camp and is one of the passengers on the &quot;Exodus&quot;. Karen does meet her father again in Israel, but he is a broken man who is unable to communicate or recognize his daughter; the experience leaves her unnerved and shattered. Despite this, she maintains her gentle and dainty personality. At the end of the novel she is murdered by &quot;fedayeen&quot; from Gaza.

===Dov Landau===
Dov Landau, described as being blond, blue-eyed, small, and young-looking for his age, is an angry teenager who lost his entire family to the Holocaust; he has not merely survived the horrors of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and of Auschwitz, but has learned from them to turn circumstances to his advantage. A master forger, he narrowly escapes the gas chamber by displaying his talent to the camp doctor. The doctor is not able to tell the difference between his own signature and the five copies that Dov makes. Dov works as a forger but is then assigned to work in a &quot;Sonderkommando&quot;, which he barely survives. After the camp is liberated, he ends up in Cyprus and eventually Israel as part of the escape organized by Ari Ben Canaan. He joins the Maccabees (based on the Irgun), a Jewish militant organization that is headed by Barak&#x27;s brother Akiva. He is driven by a thirst for revenge &quot;that only God or a bullet can stop&quot;. He falls in love with Karen and later becomes a Major in the Israeli army. He becomes unofficially engaged to Karen, but after she is murdered by the &quot;fedayeen&quot;, he forces himself to go on working for Israel, to make her proud of him.

===Jordana Ben Canaan===
Jordana Ben Canaan, described as tall, red-haired, and blue-eyed, is Ari&#x27;s fiery younger sister, a leader of the Palmach (Haganah elite unit), and the lover and fiancée of David Ben Ami. Jordana is typical of the young native-born girls and, initially hostile toward Kitty—believing that American women are no good for anything other than dressing up prettily—changes her opinion when Kitty saves Ari&#x27;s life and later becomes more identified with Israel&#x27;s struggle. After the death of David Ben Ami, Jordana sinks into depression but never mentions his name.

===Barak Ben Canaan===
Barak Ben Canaan (born Jossi Rabinsky) is 6 feet, 3 inches tall, red-haired, and blue-eyed and the father of Ari Ben Canaan. He was born in the Russian Pale of Settlement. After their father was murdered in a pogrom, he and his brother Yakov walked overland to Palestine, where they settled. There, he met and married his wife Sarah, and his son Ari and daughter Jordana were born. He became a kibbutz pioneer and eventually head of the Jewish Agency. After his brother Yakov/Akiva joins the Maccabees, he cuts off all contact with Akiva. Near the end of the novel, Barak dies of cancer and is buried next to Akiva.

===Akiva===
Akiva (born Yakov Rabinsky), is of medium height, brown-eyed, and dark haired. He is Barak Ben Canaan&#x27;s brother, a poet, and leader of the radical underground group the &quot;Maccabees&quot;. While Akiva&#x27;s organization bears some resemblance to the real-life Irgun (Etze&quot;l), the character himself may be inspired by Avraham Stern of Lehi. Near the end of the book, he is shot by the British during the Acre prison break; his brother Barak is later buried next to him.

===David Ben Ami===
David Ben Ami is black-haired and brown-eyed, and a close colleague of Ari Ben Canaan, both in the Haganah and later in the IDF. He is also Jordana&#x27;s lover and a friend of Kitty Freemont&#x27;s. He was born in Jerusalem, is university educated, and plans to take a doctorate. Steeped in religious and mystical lore, he is also a specialist in Biblical archaeology and warfare. In this regard, his knowledge is valuable in the relief of besieged Jerusalem. He is killed in action after leading a suicide mission to capture the Old City of Jerusalem.

===Rebecca Landau/Zev Gilboa===
Two Jewish suicide bombers who sacrifice themselves in acts of final desperation to kill their adversaries. Landau&#x27;s targets are German soldiers during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising during World War II; Gilboa&#x27;s are Arab fighters at the siege of Fort Esther during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

==Reviews and critical commentary==
The book became an international bestseller upon its release in 1958, and the biggest bestseller in the United States since &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in 1936. It remained number one on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for nineteen weeks. By the time it came out in paperback in 1965, the hardback had already sold more than five million copies and was among the top 10 in the &quot;New York Times&quot; best sellers list. The success of the book initiated sympathy for the newly established State of Israel.

Various reasons were cited by reviewers as to why &quot;Exodus&quot; was so well received. Among them was the fact that the book, a historical novel, came out ten years after the widely publicized Exodus Affair, which involved a ship named &quot;SS Exodus&quot;, from which the book took its title. In 1947 the British seized the ship as it was about to cross into the territorial waters of Palestine and deported all its passengers - Jewish refugees trying to immigrate illegally, many of them Holocaust survivors - back to Europe. When it came out, Uris&#x27;s book aroused the public&#x27;s interest in the fate of that ship and its passengers.

Others credited the book for being an &quot;antidote to the public silence of American Jews&quot; after Israel became a state ten years earlier. &quot;Something fundamental changed among American Jews as a result of the book,&quot; writes historian Matthew Silver. Jews were now able to reconnect to a &quot;resurrected&quot; Jewish homeland after two thousand years, he said.

The appeal of &quot;Exodus&quot; impacted Jews as well as non-Jews. Liberal Jews, writes anthropologist Jonathan Boyarin, used the &quot;Exodus&quot; narrative to connect their sympathy for the new state of Israel with their sympathy for the civil rights struggle of American blacks. Black author Julius Lester recalled that after reading the book its effect was &quot;so extraordinary that I wanted to go and fight for Israel, even die, if need be, for Israel.&quot; He explained:

The book also affected the political relationship of certain countries to their Jewish populations, most of whom died during the Holocaust. &quot;Exodus&quot; describes in detail the plight of Jews living in Eastern European countries, such as Poland. Poland had dozens of concentration camps while it was occupied by the Nazis. Its government saw Uris&#x27;s book as thereby &quot;anti-Polish&quot;, and defaming the country&#x27;s honor. The government subsequently began removing printed references to Polish informers and the country&#x27;s indifference to the fate of Jews, while describing accounts of Polish aid to Jews during those years.

The Jewish population in the Soviet Union was greatly inspired by &quot;Exodus&quot;. Those involved in the dissident samizdat movement had to make secret copies of the book after it was painstakingly translated. Translator Leah Pliner notes that some of the story had to be cut out, including romances between Jewish and non-Jewish characters, not to offend Jewish readers&#x27; expectations. She recalls having to make 300 copies on a mimeograph machine, and by the time tens of thousands had been distributed, the &quot;samizdat&quot; version of &quot;Exodus&quot; became a source of inspiration. &quot;The enormous significance of &quot;Exodus&quot; to the growth and stimulation of the Jewish movement,&quot; writes historian Leonard Schroeter, &quot;can hardly be overstated.&quot;

Historian Aviva Halamish notes that the book describes the emigration of Jews to Palestine with a &quot;heartrending story of genuine, unassuming heroism.&quot; Eileen Battersby of the &quot;Irish Times&quot; said the story &quot;cast an emotive, bombastic spell&quot; on readers, while journalist Quentin Reynolds said &quot;Exodus&quot; was exciting both &quot;as a novel and as a historical document.&quot;

Alan Elsner of the &quot;Jewish Journal&quot; describes his own re-reading of the book as &quot;disturbing and unsettling in many ways.&quot; He notes that parts of the novel were unfaithful to the actual events. For instance, while the novel describes children going on a hunger strike, which successfully forced the British to let the ship land in Palestine, in reality the British deported the Jewish passengers back to Germany. But although this did become an international incident by the press, which Elsner says discredited British policy, it &quot;did not fit Uris&#x27; dramatic purpose.&quot; Despite such inaccuracies, he adds, &quot;&quot;Exodus&quot; still packs an emotional wallop.&quot; The novel also perpetuates such historical myths as King Christian X donning a yellow star in solidarity with the Jews of Denmark.

Eric Homberger of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, describing Uris as a &quot;master storyteller&quot; and &quot;educator of the American public in the Zionist interpretation of modern Jewish history,&quot; noted some literary license with historical facts and some stereotypical characters. Writer Saul Bellow admits that while some reviewers feel that the book was not of high literary caliber, it was nonetheless effective as a document: &quot;We need such documents now,&quot; he said.

===Criticism===
The book was first criticized in 1960 by Aziz S. Sahwell of the Arab Information Center for historical inaccuracies and its depiction of Arabs. This criticism has been maintained by others. Edward Said suggested in 2001 that the novel still provides &quot;the main narrative model that dominates American thinking&quot; with respect to the foundation of Israel. British writer Robert Fisk wrote in 2014 that it was &quot;a racist, fictional account of the birth of Israel in which Arabs are rarely mentioned without the adjectives &#x27;dirty&#x27; and &#x27;stinking&#x27; [and] was one of the best pieces of Socialist-Zionist propaganda that Israel could have sought&quot;. Norman Finkelstein espoused a similar view as Robert Fisk, in his 2008 work &quot;Beyond Chutzpah&quot;. In addition, Rashid Khalidi has stated that the book has served &quot;to confirm and deepen preexisting prejudices&quot; about Palestinians and Arabs in general.

<text>V. C. Bird International Airport is an international airport located on the island of Antigua, northeast of St. John&#x27;s, the capital of Antigua and Barbuda.

== History ==

The airport originally was operated by the United States Army Air Forces.

The airport was built as a United States Army Air Forces base around 1941 and named Coolidge Airfield after Capt. Hamilton Coolidge (1895–1918), a United States Army Air Service pilot killed in World War I.

Flying units assigned to the airfield were:

* 35th Bombardment Squadron (25th Bombardment Group) 11 November 1941 until November 1942 
* 12th Bombardment Squadron (25th Bombardment Group) 23 November 1943 until 24 March 1944 
* 4th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (Antilles Air Command) 21 May until 5 October 1945

Renamed Coolidge Air Force Base (Coolidge AFB) in 1948, it was closed as a result of budgetary cutbacks in 1949, with the right of re-entry retained by the United States. Agreements were subsequently reached with the United Kingdom and, later, the Antigua government upon independence, for the establishment and maintenance of missile tracking facilities. Antigua Air Station was established on a portion of the former Coolidge AFB. , NASA continues to utilize the Antigua facility for launch tracking services on an as-needed basis; and did so for the launch of the Mars Science Laboratory on 26 November 2011.

Upon the closure of the base in 1949, it became a civil airport. It was known as Coolidge International Airport until 1985 when it was named in honour of Sir Vere Cornwall Bird (1909–1999), the first prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda.

In December 2005, the Antigua and Barbuda Millennium Airport Corporation announced it would invite tenders to construct the first phase of a new passenger terminal designed to serve the airport for 30 years. In 2012, they announced the construction of its second terminal.

The new terminal became operational on 26 August 2015. All flights operate from the new facility. The terminal covers 23,000 square meters (247,570 square feet), with four jet bridges, modern security screening facilities, up-to-date passenger processing and monitoring facilities, and a CCTV security system. It contains 46 check-in counters, 15 self-check-in kiosks, 5 baggage carousels, a mini food court, multiple VIP lounges, a bank, retail stores, first-class lounges, restaurants, and other facilities. Other improvements included a newly constructed car park; parallel to the old terminal, along with other airport offices.

==Ground transportation==
Taxis and rental cars are available at the airport, although there is no public bus service.

== Other facilities ==
* The Antigua Outstation of the Eastern Caribbean Civil Aviation Authority is on the airport property. 
*The airport includes a mural by Heather Doram, designer of Antigua and Barbuda&#x27;s national costume.

== Statistics ==
The airport was opened on 20 August 2015, and has a processing capacity of 1,700 passengers. The airport is open 24 hours a day and is serviced by more than 17 airlines.

== Accidents and incidents ==
*On 10 May 2004, a LIAT de Havilland Canada DHC-8-311 flight made an emergency landing after one of its wheels fell off shortly after takeoff. The flight operated by the Antigua-based airline had departed from St. Maarten en route to St. Kitts when one of its wheels reportedly fell off. The Dash 8-311 turboprop was diverted to Antigua and was able to land safely on its three remaining wheels, without causing damage to the aircraft. None of the 24 passengers and three crew members were injured.
*On 12 November 2008, a LIAT de Havilland Canada DHC-8-311 circled V. C. Bird International Airport in Antigua following reports of landing gear malfunction. The de Havilland Dash 8 -311 aircraft should have landed at the Robert Bradshaw International Airport in St Kitts but was diverted to Antigua because of the problem. It turned out that the landing gear was in order, but the indicators in the cockpit gave a reading that there was a fault. Firefighters, medical personnel and police were on alert but, after clearance, the aircraft landed safely with its 42 passengers and three crew members.
*On 7 October 2012, FlyMontserrat Flight 107, a FlyMontserrat Britten-Norman Islander took off and later crashed a few feet off the runway, killing the pilot and 2 of the 3 passengers on board. due to significant contamination of the aircraft&#x27;s fuel by water.

<text>71 Niobe is a stony Gallia asteroid and relatively slow rotator from the central regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered by the German astronomer Robert Luther on 13 August 1861, and named after Niobe, a character in Greek mythology. In 1861, the brightness of this asteroid was shown to vary by astronomer Friedrich Tietjen.

== Description ==

&quot;Niobe&quot; is a member of the Gallia family (), a small family of nearly 200 known stony asteroids.

In 2006, it was examined by radar using the Arecibo Observatory radio telescope in Puerto Rico. This was supplemented by optical observations intended to build a lightcurve. The resulting estimated rotation period of 35.6 hours, or 1.48 Earth days, superseded an earlier estimate of the rotation period as 14.3 hours. The radar data produced an estimate of a maximum equatorial diameter of 94 km, which is consistent with earlier estimates based upon infrared data if the shape is assumed to be slightly elongated.

The rotation period was further refined to during observations through 2010. Six stellar occultations of this asteroid between 2004 and 2007 produced chords ranging from 13 to 72 km (8–45 mi), which are statistically consistent with the published maximum diameter estimates.

<text>72 Feronia is a quite large and dark main belt asteroid. It was the first asteroid discovery by C. H. F. Peters, on May 29, 1861, from Hamilton College, New York State. It was initially thought that Peters had merely seen the already known asteroid 66 Maja, but T.H. Safford showed that it was a new body. Safford named it after Feronia, a Roman fertility goddess.

This asteroid is orbiting the Sun with a period of , having a semimajor axis of and an eccentricity of 0.121. The orbital plane is inclined by an angle of 5.4° to the plane of the ecliptic. This is a spectral type TDG asteroid with a cross-section size of 84 km. The asteroid has an estimated rotation period of 8.09 h. Hanuš et al. (2013) gives two possible solutions for the pole in ecliptic coordinates: (λ1, β1) = (287°, −39°) or (λ1, β1) = (102°, −55°).

<text>73 Klytia is a main-belt asteroid. It was the second and last asteroid discovery by the prolific comet discoverer Horace Tuttle, on April 7, 1862. It is named after Clytia, who loved Helios in Greek mythology. Of the first one hundred numbered asteroids, Klytia is the smallest.

Based upon photometry observations between 1984 and 2007, it has a sidereal rotation period of 8.283065 h with an amplitude that can range up to in magnitude. The lightcurve shows some shape irregularities. There are two valid solutions for the pole&#x27;s ecliptic coordinates: (λ1, β1) = (38°, +75°) and (λ2, β2) = (237°, +73°).

<doc id="736446" wikidata="Q2659460" url="?curid=736446" title="2000 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 2000 Atlantic hurricane season was a fairly active hurricane season, but featured the latest first named storm in a hurricane season since 1992. The hurricane season officially began on June 1, and ended on November 30. It was slightly above average due to a La Niña weather pattern although most of the storms were weak. It was also the only season to have two of the storms affect Ireland. The first cyclone, Tropical Depression One, developed in the southern Gulf of Mexico on June 7 and dissipated after an uneventful duration. However, it would be almost two months before the first named storm, Alberto, formed near Cape Verde; Alberto also dissipated with no effects on land. Several other tropical cyclones—Tropical Depression Two, Tropical Depression Four, Chris, Ernesto, Nadine, and an unnamed subtropical storm—did not impact land. Five additional storms—Tropical Depression Nine, Florence, Isaac, Joyce, and Leslie—minimally affected land areas.

The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Keith, which caused extensive damage in Central America. After remaining nearly stationary offshore, Keith moved inland over the Yucatán Peninsula and later made a second landfall in Mexico at hurricane intensity. It caused $319 million (2000 USD) in damage and 40 fatalities, mostly in Belize. The precursor to Tropical Storm Leslie brought severe flooding to South Florida, which losses reaching $950 million (2000 USD). Hurricane Gordon and Tropical Storm Helene both caused moderate damage in the Southeastern United States, mainly in Florida. Tropical Storm Beryl caused minor damage in Mexico and Hurricane Debby resulted in less than $1 million (2000 USD) in damage in the Greater and Lesser Antilles. Hurricane Michael brought widespread effects to Atlantic Canada, though a specific damage toll is unknown.

== Seasonal forecasts ==
=== Pre-season outlooks ===
Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert Dr. William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the U.S. Government&#x27;s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). According to CSU, the average season between 1950 and 2000 had 9.6 tropical storms, 5.9 hurricanes, and 2.3 major hurricanes (storms exceeding Category 3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale). A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 9 to 12 named storms, of which five to seven reach hurricane strength and one to three become major hurricanes.

Noted hurricane expert Dr. William M. Gray on April 7 predicted eleven named storms, with eight reaching hurricane strength and three of the eight reaching Category 3 strength. The prediction issued on June 7 was similar, increasing the named storms to twelve, eight hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. On May 10, NOAA issued a season outlook, which gave the indication of an above-average season. According to NOAA, the global scale atmospheric circulation pattern which was taking place was conducive to an above-average hurricane season. However, La Niña was present it the Eastern Pacific, which was a factor in the activity in the season. NOAA issued a 75% chance of above average activity.

=== Mid-season outlooks ===
After the season started on June 1, CSU issued a mid-season forecast on August 4, which predicted 11 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. Six days after the CSU prediction, NOAA also released a mid-season outlook, forecasting exactly the same amount of activity, 11 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. With a 75% chance of above-average activity, there was an elevated risk of landfalling hurricanes.

== Seasonal summary ==

The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 2000. It was an above average season in which 19 tropical cyclones formed. Fifteen depressions attained tropical storm status, and eight of these attained hurricane status. Three hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes. The season was above average most likely because of an ongoing La Niña in the Pacific Ocean. Three hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall during the season and caused 77 deaths and $1.2 billion in damage (2000 USD). Hurricane Florence and Isaac and Tropical Storm Leslie also caused damage and fatalities, though none of the three made landfall. The last storm of the season, an unnamed subtropical storm, dissipated on October 29, over a month before the official end of hurricane season on November 30.

Tropical cyclogenesis first occurred in the month of June, with two tropical depressions developing in the Atlantic. However, no tropical cyclones developed in the month of July, the first phenomenon since 1993. In August, five tropical cyclones developed, most notably, Hurricane Alberto. September was more active, with seven named storms forming; that month featured Hurricane Keith, the strongest system of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season. With seven named storms forming in September, this made it the most active September on record at the time. This record was surpassed two years later when eight storms formed in September. In addition, a quick succession of eight storms occurred in September, and lasted into early October. Six tropical cyclones existed in October and one additional subtropical storm developed in the last week of the month. Following an active October, no tropical cyclogenesis occurred in November, which is the final month of the season.

The season&#x27;s activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 119. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. Subtropical cyclones, including the unnamed storm as well as the initial stages of Florence, Leslie, and Michael, are excluded from the total.

== Systems ==

=== Tropical Depression One ===

A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on May 23 and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean. The system had entered into the Gulf of Mexico on June 6. Another tropical wave merged with the system on June 7 and developed into a low-pressure area in the Gulf of Mexico. Later that day, the National Hurricane Center began classifying the system as Tropical Depression One. Though the depression was predicted to intensify into a tropical storm, strong wind shear produced by an upper-anticyclone prevented significant strengthening.

The depression tracked slowly and erratically through the Gulf of Mexico. By late on June 8, a reconnaissance plane flight indicated that the depression had degenerated into a low-pressure area. The remnants of the depression produced gusty winds and light to moderate rainfall along the Gulf Coast of Mexico; some areas in the state of Tamaulipas reported precipitation amounts as high as . In addition, heavy precipitation was reported in south-central Texas.
=== Tropical Depression Two ===

A tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa and quickly developed into Tropical Depression Two on June 23. Although it was well-organized, the National Hurricane Center did not initiate advisories on the depression until 1500 UTC on June 24, since it operationally appeared that a surface circulation did not exist until then. However, the depression was less organized after the National Hurricane Center began advisories. Having formed at 19.8°W, it was one of the easternmost developing tropical cyclones in the month of June, even further east than Tropical Storm Ana in 1979 and Tropical Depression Two in 2003. Though light wind shear and marginally warm sea surface temperatures were in the path of the depression, no significant intensification occurred as it tracked generally westward. The depression began encountering a stable air mass, and degenerated back into a tropical wave on June 25.
=== Hurricane Alberto ===
A well-developed tropical wave was observed in satellite imagery over central Africa on July 30. The system tracked westward and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on August 3. Thereafter, the system rapidly organized, and developed into Tropical Depression Three at 1800 UTC that day. The depression moved west-northwestward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Alberto early on August 4. While briefly turning westward on August 6, Alberto reached hurricane status. It tracked west-northwestward, and by early the following day, the storm reached an initial peak with winds of . Shortly thereafter, Alberto re-curved northwestward. Wind shear then increased, which caused Alberto to weaken to a tropical storm on August 9. However, it quickly re-strengthened, and early on August 10, Alberto was upgraded to a hurricane again. Due to a break in a subtropical ridge, Alberto gradually curved northward and north-northeastward between August 11 and 12. While turning northeastward, Alberto strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane, becoming the first major hurricane of the season. By 1200 UTC on August 12, Alberto attained its peak intensity with winds of .

Increasing upper-level westerlies caused Alberto to weaken as it moved east-northeastward, with the cyclone losing most of its convection. Early on August 14, Alberto was downgraded to a tropical storm. A westerly trough that had been guiding Alberto outran the storm, and strong ridging developed to the north and west. As a result, Alberto turned southward on August 15, southwestward on August 16, and then to the west on August 17. While curving northwestward and then northward, Alberto began to re-strengthen, and was upgraded to a hurricane for the third occasion on August 18. Alberto reached a third peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of on August 20. After weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane, Alberto had completed a cyclonic loop, which it had started on August 13. Due to decreasing ocean temperatures, Alberto was again downgraded to a tropical storm on August 23 as it accelerated northeastward. Six hours later, Alberto transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while centered about south-southwest of Reykjavík, Iceland.
=== Tropical Depression Four ===

An area of low pressure detached from a frontal zone on August 4 and moved southwestward. After developing a minimal amount of deep convection, an Air Force Reserve Command reconnaissance aircraft found a well-defined low-level circulation on August 8. The depression then moved westward without intensifying for two days. On August 10, the depression was about east of Cape Canaveral, Florida when it abruptly turned northeastward in advance of a deep-layer trough over the eastern United States. After minimal strengthening, the depression dissipated to the north of the Bahamas on August 11. While a tropical cyclone, a reconnaissance flight reported winds of at . However, it was not upgraded to a tropical storm since the aforementioned wind speed did not represent the intensity of the depression.
=== Tropical Storm Beryl ===
A tropical wave emerged from the coast of Africa with a closed circulation on August 3. The system split, with the northern portion developing into Hurricane Alberto, while the southern portion of the wave continued westward. Minimal deep convection persisted until the wave reached the Yucatán Peninsula on August 12. After emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on the following day, satellite imagery and a reconnaissance aircraft flight indicated that the system developed into Tropical Depression Five at 1800 UTC. Early on August 13, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl. Despite predictions for Beryl to reach hurricane status, it remained disorganized and peaked as a tropical storm.

By 0700 UTC on August 15, Beryl made landfall about north of La Pesca, in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas with winds of . Beryl quickly weakened inland, and was downgraded to a tropical depression five hours after moving inland. Shortly thereafter, Beryl dissipated while centered near Monterrey. In Mexico, Beryl dropped light to moderate rainfall, especially in Tamaulipas, which peaked at . One person drowned due to flood waters in northeastern Mexico. Damage was light, totaling to $27,000 (2000 USD). In southern Texas, Beryl brought light precipitation to some locations. Cloud cover and rainfall in the Brownsville area resulted in the coldest maximum temperature recorded for the city on the date of August 15.
=== Tropical Storm Chris ===

A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on August 12. Although large amounts of deep convection accompanied the system, it was displaced from the poorly defined center. Over the next few days, convection consolidated and by 1200 UTC on August 17, the system began as Tropical Depression Six, while centered about east of the Lesser Antilles. Outflow was initially limited due to light wind shear, though the depression was forecast to become a strong tropical storm by August 20. It was &quot;highly surprising&quot; to the National Hurricane Center that the depression did not immediately begin to intensify, despite warm sea surface temperatures and light wind shear. Because of a burst in deep convection, as well as satellite imagery estimating winds of , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Chris at 1200 UTC on August 18.

Upon becoming a tropical storm, Chris attained its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Because wind shear was believed to be weak, further intensification seemed very likely. Unexpectedly, Chris weakened back to a tropical depression by 1800 UTC on August 18, after having been a tropical storm for only six hours. However, the National Hurricane Center operationally held Chris at tropical storm intensity until early on the following day. Convection was nearly non-existent early on August 19, though there were a few small bursts in convection. Later that day, a reconnaissance aircraft flight into the storm found no circulation, while a QuikSCAT pass indicated an open wave. As a result, Chris dissipated while east of the northernmost Leeward Islands at 1200 UTC on August 19.

=== Hurricane Debby ===
A strong tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on August 16. No development occurred until August 19, when convection began consolidating around a well-defined low-level circulation. As a result, the system became Tropical Depression Seven at 1800 UTC on that same day, while located about east of the Windward Islands. Favorable conditions allowed the depression to become Tropical Storm Debby early on August 20 and further strengthening into a hurricane occurred 24 hours later. At 1200 UTC on August 21, sustained winds peaked at . Debby made three landfalls on August 22, in Barbuda, Saint Barthélemy, and Virgin Gorda, before re-entering the Atlantic north of Puerto Rico. As Debby paralleled the north coast of Hispaniola late on August 23, it weakened to a tropical storm. Unexpectedly, the storm continued westward and weakened further, instead of approaching Florida and strengthening into a major hurricane. While south of eastern Cuba on August 24, Debby was downgraded to a tropical depression, six hours becoming completely dissipating.

Light rainfall and gusty winds caused minor damage in Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Trinidad and Tobago. Brief blackouts and damage reaching $200,000 was reported in the United States Virgin Islands. Effects were most severe in Puerto Rico, where some areas experienced more than of rainfall. Mudslides caused by flooding damaged roads, bridges, and houses. At 406 homes on the island were flooded, which five suffering at least moderate damage. In San Juan, slick roads caused several minor car accidents. One indirect fatality was attributed to the storm after a man fell off his roof while attempting to remove a satellite dish. Damage on the island of Puerto Rico reached $501,000. According to the Civil Defense Force of Dominican Republic, severe flooding in the northern portions of that country caused the evacuation of more than 700 people. In Haiti, squalls tore tin roofs off of numerous shanty homes and subsequently flooded a few. Rainfall in Cuba brought relief to an eight-month-long drought in eastern Cuba.
=== Tropical Storm Ernesto ===

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on August 28. While tracking west-northwestward, satellite imagery indicated a developing low-level circulation. After significant deep convection formed, the system was classified as Tropical Depression Eight at 1200 UTC on September 1. Because of potentially unfavorable wind shear, only slight intensification was forecast. The depression tracked west-northwestward under the influence of a subtropical ridge to its north. Because of satellite intensity estimates of sustained winds of , increased deep convection, and improvements in outflow, the depression became Tropical Storm Ernesto at 0600 UTC on September 2. However, the NHC noted in its Tropical Cyclone Report on Ernesto that it may not have been a tropical cyclone at all, as QuikSCAT surface wind estimates indicated that there was no closed circulation, although the data was dismissed as inconclusive.

As it strengthened into a tropical storm, Ernesto attained its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum pressure of . Because of vertical shear, the low-level circulation did not become well-defined. Because convection was being sheared away from the center, the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of Ernesto weakening back to a tropical depression, though forecasts indicated otherwise. Later that day, no significant change in intensity was predicted, as persistent wind shear seemed to be weakening Ernesto, though the SHIPS and GFDL computer models called for significant strengthening. Although deep convection re-developed near the center early on September 3, no intensification occurred. At 1800 UTC on September 3, Ernesto weakened to a tropical depression. Six hours later, Ernesto dissipated to the east-northeast of the Leeward Islands.
=== Tropical Depression Nine ===

A low-level trough and a cluster of convection associated with a tropical wave interacted in the Gulf of Mexico in early September 2000. A disorganized low-level center developed and, thus, the system was classified as Tropical Depression Nine while located south of Lake Charles, Louisiana on September 8. Due to proximity to land, the depression was unable to intensify into a tropical storm and attained a maximum wind speed of . The depression weakened slightly before making landfall near Sabine Pass, Texas on September 9. Eight hours later, the depression dissipated while barely inland.

The depression brought light to moderate rainfall to Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, and Texas, though it was generally less than . A few areas in southern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama reported precipitation in excess of ; rainfall associated with the depression peaked at in Buras-Triumph, Louisiana. However, the depression caused no damage or fatalities.

=== Hurricane Florence ===
A cold front moved off the continent of North America in early September. The system spawned a low-pressure area that gradually developed into a subtropical depression at 1800 UTC on September 10, while located about west-southwest of Bermuda. It rapidly acquired tropical characteristics and became Tropical Depression Ten at 0600 UTC on September 11. Thereafter, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Florence at 1200 UTC on that day and reached hurricane status only six hours later. Drier mid-tropospheric air weakened Florence to a tropical storm, but re-strengthened into a hurricane later on September 12.

Due to a combination of north-northwesterly shear and lower sea surface temperatures, Florence again weakened on September 13 and was downgraded to a tropical storm. After moving erratically for almost five days, Florence accelerated east-northeastward in response to a short-wave trough on September 15. The storm soon began to re-intensify, becoming a hurricane early on September 16. Shortly thereafter, Florence curved northeastward. However, colder sea surface temperatures weakened it to a tropical storm September 17. Early on the following day, Florence was absorbed by an extratropical low near Newfoundland. Rip current along the East Coast of the United States drowned three people in North Carolina. Tropical storm force winds were reported in Bermuda, though no damage occurred.
=== Hurricane Gordon ===
A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on September 4 and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean with minimal organization for four days. After slowly developing convection between September 8 and 14, an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft reported a closed circulation. As a result, the system was classified as Tropical Depression Eleven just offshore Quintana Roo. Shortly thereafter, the depression made landfall in Quintana Roo. On September 15, the system emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. Due to warm sea surface temperatures, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gordon on the following day and further to hurricane intensity on September 17 while tracking northeastward. However, vertical wind shear and dry air entrainment weakened Gordon to a tropical storm later that day. At 0300 UTC on September 18, Gordon made landfall near Cedar Key, Florida with winds of . Gordon rapidly weakened inland and was only a tropical depression when it was absorbed by a frontal system over Georgia about 15 hours later.

While passing through the Lesser Antilles, the precursor tropical wave caused locally heavy rainfall and wind gusts between . Shortly before developing into a tropical cyclone, flooding in mountainous areas of Guatemala caused 23 fatalities. In its early stages, Gordon produced locally heavy rainfall in Cuba and the Yucatán Peninsula. The storm produced abnormally high tides along the west coast of Florida, which caused widespread, but minor coastal flooding. At least 65 homes and businesses were flooded, while numerous coastal roads, including Bayshore Boulevard and the Courtney Campbell Causeway, were closed due to water inundation. One fatality occurred near Pensacola, after a surfer drowned in rough seas. Strong winds in the state caused damage to houses, businesses, power lines, and trees. Two tornadoes in Southwest Florida extensively damaged 2 condominiums and at least 24 houses. A third tornado along the east coast of Central Florida caused minimal damage to trees and roofs. Minor flooding occurred in some areas due to rainfall reaching in Mayo. In North Carolina, flooding caused two indirect fatalities when a car lost control and crashed into a tractor trailer. In other states, light rainfall caused mostly minor effects. Overall, Gordon was responsible for $10.8 million in damage.
=== Tropical Storm Helene ===
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September 10 and gradually developed into Tropical Depression Twelve on September 15, while located more than east of the Leeward Islands. It did not intensify and degenerated to a tropical wave on the following day. The remnants continued westward and crossed the Leeward Islands on September 17. Late on September 19, the remnants redeveloped into Tropical Depression Twelve near Grand Cayman. Around 1200 UTC on September 20, the depression crossed near the western tip of Cuba. Entering the Gulf of Mexico, the depression began strengthening, and became Tropical Storm Helene at early on September 21, while tracking northward. Later that day, Helene peaked with winds of , though due to increasing wind shear, the storm soon began to weaken. At 1200 UTC on September 22, Helene made landfall near Fort Walton Beach, Florida with winds of . Although the storm weakened slightly inland, it later began re-strengthening and became a tropical storm over North Carolina late on September 23. After re-emerging into the Atlantic Ocean, Helene re-intensified to near hurricane status, though the storm was absorbed by a cold front on September 26, while east-southeast of Newfoundland.

The remnant tropical wave produced strong winds and flooding in the Lesser Antilles. Effects were the worst in Puerto Rico, where flash flooding and mudslides destroyed one home and damaged at least one-hundred others. In addition, a bridge was also destroyed and many other roads were impassable due to flooding. Impact in Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola is unknown. A combination of gusty winds, locally heavy rainfall, and a few tornadoes in the Florida Panhandle caused about 5,000 power outages, damaged more than 220 homes, and destroyed two houses and four mobile homes. Heavy rainfall caused the Sopchoppy River to exceed its banks, flooding nearby houses. Outside of Florida, effects were most severe in South Carolina, where rainfall in excess of fell, and a tornado caused one fatality, six injuries, and damaged 12 houses. The other death in the state occurred when a car hydroplaned and crashed into a tree, which killed the driver. Throughout its path, Helene caused slightly more than $16 million in damage.
=== Hurricane Isaac ===
A well-defined tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September 20. The cloud pattern quickly became better-defined, and developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen on September 21 while centered south of Cape Verde. The depression quickly intensified due to low wind shear and became Tropical Storm Isaac early on September 22 as it headed west-northwestward. Isaac continued to strengthen and was upgraded to a hurricane on September 23. After reaching a preliminary peak with winds of , the structure of the storm became less organized, possibly due to slightly colder ocean temperatures and increased wind shear. By 1200 UTC on September 26, Isaac ceased weakening after winds dropped to . The storm began to re-strengthen on September 27 after wind shear decreased.

On September 28, Isaac peaked as a low-end Category 4 hurricane with winds of . Following its peak intensity, Isaac began to weaken immediately thereafter, while turning north-northwestward. Eventually, the storm turned northward before re-curving north-northeastward. Further weakening occurred after Isaac moved over decreasing sea surface temperatures and dropped down to Category 1 intensity by September 30, while accelerating northeastward. On October 1, Isaac was downgraded to a tropical storm shortly before transitioning into extratropical later that same day. The extratropical remnants affected the British Isles between October 3 and 4, before being absorbed into another extratropical storm to the north of Scotland on October 4. Minimal impact was reported from Isaac. One fatality occurred when a passenger drowned after his boat capsized due to large waves produced by Isaac offshore Long Island, New York.
=== Hurricane Joyce ===

A poorly organized tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September 22. Influenced by a powerful ridge that developed in the wake of Hurricane Isaac, the wave traveled a brisk westward path at . While in the deep tropics of the open Atlantic, the wave began to show indications of a closed circulation. On September 25, the NHC designated the system as Tropical Depression Fourteen, and a day later upgraded it to Tropical Storm Joyce. Deep convection and outflow improved, and Joyce developed an eye. On September 27, Joyce attained hurricane status, and early on September 28, Joyce reached a peak intensity of and a central pressure of . At the time, it was located about midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles, and had a fleeting pinhole eye. Soon after, wind shear increased, partially exposing Joyce&#x27;s center of circulation, and the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm on September 29. The storm still produced occasional bursts of convection, although it weakened further due to intrusion of Saharan air layer, causing Joyce to weaken into a tropical depression on October 1 as it crossed the Windward Islands on October 1. Although the NHC expected that the depression would reintensify, Joyce degenerated into an open tropical wave over the southeastern Caribbean Sea on October 2. 

The approach of the storm prompted tropical storm warnings and watches for the Windward Islands. While weakening, Joyce passed close to Tobago, producing sustained winds of . Barbados experienced sustained winds of , with gusts to . After degenerating into an open wave, Joyce&#x27;s remnants passed over the ABC Islands, where locally heavy thunderstorms and light winds were reported on October 2.
=== Hurricane Keith ===
A tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa on September 16. The system uneventfully crossed the Atlantic and Caribbean, before developing into Tropical Depression Fifteen while near Honduras on September 28. The depression gradually strengthened, and became Tropical Storm Keith on the following day. As the storm tracked westward, it continued to intensify and was upgraded to a hurricane on September 30. Shortly thereafter, Keith began to rapidly deepen and peaked as a Category 4 hurricane less than 24 hours later. Keith then began to meander erratically offshore of Belize, which significantly weakened the storm due to land interaction. By late on October 2, Keith made landfall in Ambergris Caye, Belize as a minimal hurricane. It quickly weakened to a tropical storm, before another landfall occurred near Belize City early on the following day. While moving inland over the Yucatán Peninsula, Keith weakened further, and was downgraded to a tropical depression before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on October 4. Once in the Gulf of Mexico, Keith began to re-strengthen and was upgraded to a tropical storm later that day, and a hurricane on the following day. By late on October 5, Keith made its third and final landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico as a moderately strong Category 1 hurricane. The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated as a tropical cyclone by 24 hours after landfall.

Keith brought heavy rainfall to several countries in Central America, which resulted in extensive flooding, especially in Belize and Mexico. In Guatemala, the storm flooded 10 towns, and caused one fatality. Similarly, one fatality also occurred in El Salvador, and at least 300 people were affected by flooding in that country. Thirteen communities in Nicaragua were completely isolated after Keith made roads impassable. Twelve deaths were reported in Nicaragua, all of which were flood-related. Five people were presumed dead in Honduras after an aircraft disappeared near Roatán; one other fatality occurred due to flooding. The storm brought torrential rainfall to Belize, with many areas reporting at least of rain, while highest reported amount of precipitation was in Belize City. In Belize, a village reported that only 12 houses remained, while elsewhere in the country, at least 60 homes were destroyed or damaged; several houses in Belize City suffered minor roof damage. At least 19 people were killed in Belize and damages totaled to $280 million (2000 USD). Heavy rainfall also occurred in Mexico, especially in the states of Nuevo León and Tamaulipas. Flooding by Keith caused several mudslides and a few rivers reached historic levels. Throughout Mexico, at least 460 houses were damaged or destroyed and other losses in infrastructure occurred. In addition, one person drowned due to heavy rainfall. Damages incurred in associated with Keith in Mexico totaled approximately $365.9 million (2000 MXN, $38.7 million 2000 USD). Overall, Keith was responsible for 40 deaths and $319 million (2000 USD) in damage.
=== Tropical Storm Leslie ===
A tropical wave, which likely spawned Hurricane Isaac, entered the eastern Caribbean Sea on September 27. The system slowly organized while tracking westward and later moved to the north-northwest around Hurricane Keith. Eventually, the system moved northward into the Gulf of Mexico and the Straits of Florida. The system interacted with a frontal boundary while crossing Florida on October 3 and 4, which caused torrential rainfall. Satellite imagery indicated the development of a circulation near Orlando. Because of its structure, the system became a subtropical depression at 1200 UTC on October 4. About six hours later, the subtropical depression emerged into the Atlantic and low-level circulation gradually moved toward the deep convection while tracking eastward. By 1200 UTC on October 5, the subtropical depression was reclassified as Tropical Storm Leslie. While fully tropical, Leslie strengthened slightly and peaked with winds of . However, it soon began interacting with a cold front and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October 7, while located northwest of Bermuda.

The system dropped heavy rainfall in Cuba, peaking at in the Havana Province. While the precursor crossed Florida, it produced torrential rainfall across southern Florida, especially in the Miami metropolitan area. In Miami-Dade County alone, 1,005 houses were destroyed, 1,358 were severely damaged, and 3,443 had minor damage. Throughout the state, at least 93,000 homes were flooded. Electrical stations were also damaged by floods, leaving more than 27,000 people without power. Extensive agricultural damage occurred, with of farmland inundated by water. Overall, the precursor system of Leslie resulted in about $950 million (2000 USD) in damage, slightly more than half of that figure was agriculture related. Additionally, three fatalities occurred, two of which due to drowning, while the third was a man that fell while attempting to unclog a roof drain. The remnants of Leslie caused near tropical storm force winds and waves up to in Newfoundland, though damage in the region was minimal.
=== Hurricane Michael ===
A low-pressure system developed after detaching from a cold front while between Florida and Bermuda. The low-pressure area slowly formed a circulation and began to deepen on October 14 as it drifted north-northeastward. By October 15, the system developed into a subtropical depression while centered about midway between Florida and Bermuda. Later that day, satellite classifications using the Hebert-Poteat technique indicated that the subtropical depression had strengthened into a subtropical storm, and it was upgraded at 0000 UTC on October 16. Due to SST&#x27;s in excess of , the subtropical storm developed persistent convection near the low-level center and it slowly acquired tropical characteristics. By 0000 UTC on October 17, the subtropical storm was re-classified as Tropical Storm Michael. Three hours later, the National Hurricane Center began advisories on Michael, though initially it was erroneously classified as Tropical Depression Seventeen.

Although Michael was predicted to intensify only modestly, it rapidly strengthened, and became a hurricane later on October 17. Michael fluctuated slightly in intensity while tracking over an area of decreasing SST&#x27;s. However, another brief period of rapid intensification occurred due to baroclinic effects, and Michael peaked as a minimal Category 2 hurricane. Shortly thereafter, Michael transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before making landfall near Harbour Breton, Newfoundland. Throughout Newfoundland, Michael and the remnant extratropical cyclone produced high winds, which tore off roofs, ripped off roof shingles, caused sporadic power outages, shattered windows, and uprooted trees in a few communities. Precipitation produced by the storm was light and peaked at in North Mountain, Nova Scotia. Michael also produced rainfall in Maine and Bermuda. There were no damage figures available, though damage was considered to be relatively light.
=== Tropical Storm Nadine ===

In mid-October, a strong upper-level trough and a tropical wave interacted while located in the central Atlantic. The system moved slowly westward and convection began increasing. By October 19, the system became stationary and developed a surface circulation. Later that day, Tropical Depression Eighteen developed about southeast of Bermuda. Initially, the depression lacked a well-defined center, though a broad circulation was evident. The depression tracked slowly northward and then northeastward around a subtropical ridge and ahead of a cold front. As wind shear decreased, convective activity became better organized on October 20. By 1200 UTC on that day, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Nadine. Although it was strengthening, QuikSCAT suggested that the low-level circulation was falling apart, as it appeared to be merging with the cold front.

At 0000 UTC on October 21, Nadine attained its peak intensity with winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Around the time of peak intensity, a possible eye-like feature and an impressive outflow were observed on satellite imagery. As a result, the National Hurricane Center noted the possibility, but did not exclusively forecast Nadine to strengthen into a hurricane. However, shortly thereafter, wind shear increased and the storm resembled a frontal wave and appeared to possibly be interacting with the cold front. The cloud pattern then became ragged, while the low-level circulation moved toward the southern edge of the deep convection. By 0000 UTC on October 22, Nadine transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and merged with a frontal low about 18 hours later.
=== Unnamed subtropical storm ===

On October 25, an extratropical low pressure system formed to the east of the Turks and Caicos Islands. It moved northwestward and gradually intensified, and by 1800 UTC the system transitioned into a subtropical storm. It turned to the north and later to the northeast. A burst of convection near the center allowed the storm to attain peak winds of ; due to its forward motion, it is possible the surface winds reached as high as . An approaching cold front caused the storm to become extratropical on October 29, and later that day a larger extratropical storm absorbed the previously subtropical storm near Nova Scotia.

The Marine Prediction Center issued some marine gale and storm warnings offshore, while the National Weather Service issued gale warnings for coastal North Carolina. It was not designated as a subtropical cyclone operationally. The storm produced tropical storm force winds in portions of Atlantic Canada, although it was associated with the larger extratropical storm at the time. Several ships also recorded tropical storm force winds, one of which recorded peak winds of .
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 2000. This was the same list used in the 1994 season. Storms were named &quot;Joyce&quot;, &quot;Leslie&quot;, &quot;Michael&quot;, and &quot;Nadine&quot; for the first time this year. &quot;Joyce&quot; was the replacement for &quot;Joan&quot; in 1988.

=== Retirement ===

In spring of 2001, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name &quot;Keith&quot; from the Atlantic hurricane name lists due to its high impact. It was replaced with the name &quot;Kirk&quot; for the 2006 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 2000 USD.

<doc id="736449" wikidata="Q1161827" url="?curid=736449" title="Macramé">
<text>Macramé is a form of textile produced using knotting (rather than weaving or knitting) techniques.

The primary knots of macramé are the square (or reef knot) and forms of &quot;hitching&quot;: various combinations of half hitches. It was long crafted by sailors, especially in elaborate or ornamental knotting forms, to cover anything from knife handles to bottles to parts of ships.

Cavandoli macramé is one variety that is used to form geometric and free-form patterns like weaving. The Cavandoli style is done mainly in a single knot, the double half-hitch knot. Reverse half hitches are sometimes used to maintain balance when working the left and right halves of a balanced piece.

Leather or fabric belts are another accessory often created via macramé techniques. Most friendship bracelets exchanged among schoolchildren and teens are created using this method. Vendors at theme parks, malls, seasonal fairs, and other public places may sell macramé jewelry or decoration as well.

== History ==

One of the earliest recorded uses of macramé-style knots as decoration appeared in the carvings of the Babylonians and Assyrians. Fringe-like plaiting and braiding adorned the costumes of the time and were captured in their stone statuary.

Arab weavers called this kind of decorated cloth embroidery migramah (مِقْرَمة). It involved knotting excess thread along the edges of hand-loomed fabrics such as towels, shawls, and veils into decorative fringes. The word &quot;macramé&quot; could be derived from the Andalusian-Arabic version &quot;makramīya&quot; (), believed to mean &quot;striped towel&quot;, &quot;ornamental fringe&quot; or &quot;embroidered veil&quot;. Another school of thought indicates that it came to Europe from Arabic but via the Turkish version &quot;makrama&quot;, &quot;napkin&quot; or &quot;towel&quot;. The decorative fringes also helped to keep flies off camels and horses in northern Africa.

The Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula took the craft to Spain, then Italy, especially in the region of Liguria, then it spread through Europe. In England, it was introduced at the court of Mary II in the late 17th century. Queen Mary taught it to her ladies-in-waiting.
Macramé was most popular in the Victorian era. It adorned most homes in items such as tablecloths, bedspreads and curtains. The popular &quot;Sylvia&#x27;s Book of Macramé Lace&quot; (1882) showed how &quot;to work rich trimmings for black and coloured costumes, both for home wear, garden parties, seaside ramblings, and balls—fairylike adornments for household and underlinens ...&quot;.

It was a specialty in Genoa, and was popular in the 19th century. There, &quot;Its roots were in a 16th-century technique of knotting lace known as &quot;punto a groppo&quot;&quot; 

Sailors made macramé objects while not busy at sea, and sold or bartered them when they landed. Nineteenth-century British and American sailors made hammocks, bell fringes, and belts from macramé. They called the process &quot;square knotting&quot; after the knot they used most often. Sailors also called macramé &quot;McNamara&#x27;s lace&quot;.

Macramé&#x27;s popularity faded, but resurged in the 1970s for making wall hangings, clothing accessories, small jean shorts, bedspreads, tablecloths, draperies, plant hangers and other furnishings. Macramé jewelry became popular in America. Using mainly square knots and granny knots, this jewelry often features handmade glass beads and natural elements such as bone and shell. Necklaces, anklets and bracelets have become popular forms of macramé jewelry. By the early 1980s, macramé again began to fall out of fashion, only to be revived by millennials.

==Materials and process==
Materials used in macramé include cords made of cotton twine, linen, hemp, jute, leather or yarn. Cords are identified by construction, such as a 3-ply cord, made of three lengths of fibre twisted together. Jewelry is often made in combination of both the knots and various beads (of glass, wood, and so on), pendants or shells. Sometimes &#x27;found&#x27; focal points are used for necklaces, such as rings or gemstones, either wire-wrapped to allow for securing or captured in a net-like array of intertwining overhand knots. A knotting board is often used to mount the cords for macramé work. Cords may be held in place using a C-clamp, straight pins, T-pins, U-pins, or upholstery pins.

For larger decorative pieces, such as wall hangings or window coverings, a work of macramé might be started out on a wooden or metal dowel, allowing for a spread of dozens of cords that are easy to manipulate. For smaller projects, push-pin boards are available specifically for macramé, although a simple corkboard works adequately. Many craft stores offer beginners&#x27; kits, work boards, beads and materials ranging in price for the casual hobbyist or ambitious crafter.

<doc id="736450" wikidata="Q1427269" url="?curid=736450" title="Kaibab National Forest">
<text>Kaibab National Forest (, ) borders both the north and south rims of the Grand Canyon, in north-central Arizona. Its 1.6 million acres (650,000 ha) is divided into three sections: the &quot;North Kaibab Ranger District&quot; (offices in Fredonia), the &quot;Tusayan Ranger District&quot; (offices in the Grand Canyon), and the &quot;Williams Ranger District&quot; (offices in Williams). It is managed by the United States Forest Service. Grand Canyon National Park separates the North Kaibab and the South Kaibab (Tusayan and Williams). The South Kaibab covers less than and the North Kaibab stretches over . Elevations vary on the forest from 5,500 feet (1,676 m) in the southwest corner to 10,418 feet (3,175 m) at the summit of Kendrick Peak on the Williams Ranger District. The forest as a whole is headquartered in Williams.

== North Kaibab ==
The Kaibab Plateau is an island surrounded by lower elevations. The plateau, with elevation up to 9,215 feet (2,800 m) is bordered on the south by the Grand Canyon, on the east and the west by tributary canyons of the Colorado River, and on the North by tiers of uplifted cliffs.

===North Kaibab history===
The North Kaibab Ranger District was part of the lands withdrawn from the public domain in 1893 and included in the Grand Canyon Forest Reserve. President Theodore Roosevelt created the Grand Canyon Game Preserve in 1906. The game preserve which includes of the Kaibab National Forest, is &quot;set aside for the protection of game animals and birds,&quot; and is &quot;to be recognized as a breeding place therefore.&quot; in 1908, the Forest Reserve north of the Grand Canyon, including the game preserve, was renamed Kaibab National Forest. In 1919, the National Park was created from the forest service lands surrounding the Grand Canyon. In 1934, the Tusayan National Forest south of the Grand Canyon was consolidated into the Kaibab National Forest, forming the present forest boundaries. Up until 1972, the North Kaibab consisted of two ranger districts, Big Springs and Jacob Lake. The headquarters of each were somewhat remote, particularly the Big Springs district. The two were combined and the forest area north of the canyon became the North Kaibab Ranger District and the district ranger station moved to Fredonia. The headquarters for the Kaibab National Forest is in Williams, Arizona.

===North Kaibab climate===
The climate of the North Kaibab, which encompasses the Kaibab Plateau, is a snowy highland climate, qualifying as &quot;Dsb/Csb&quot; under the Köppen climate classification, a type often described as Continental climate. There are two weather stations in this area: Jacob Lake, which is near the center of the plateau, and Bright Angel Ranger Station, which is located at a more southerly location and is higher in altitude. The higher altitude is reflected in Bright Angel&#x27;s lower temperatures and increased precipitation versus Jacob Lake. Using the isotherm between temperate and continental climates preferred by some climatologists, Bright Angel Ranger Station is &quot;Dsb&quot;, the dry-summer version of the warm summer humid continental climate. The North Kaibab is unusual for either a &quot;Csb&quot; or &quot;Dsb&quot; climate, featuring lower precipitation in early summer, with July and August being wetter (courtesy of the North American Monsoon). This is followed by a slightly drier period during the autumn months, and then a wetter period from December to March. Summers in this area feature warm days and cool nights. Winters are chilly, especially at night, and snowy. Jacob Lake averages of snow per annum, and Bright Angel Ranger Station .

== South Kaibab ==
The South Kaibab includes the Tusayan Ranger District and the Williams Ranger District. The Tusayan Ranger District is part of Baaj Nwaavjo I&#x27;tah Kukveni – Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument.

== Vegetation ==
Vegetation in the forest varies by elevation and exposure. Principal tree species are ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, aspen, blue spruce, oak, pinyon pine, and juniper. Among other things, they enhance the beauty of the landscape, hold soil in place, and provide cover and food for wildlife. As elevation decreases, trees give way to bitterbrush, Gambel oak, sagebrush, and cliffrose. Within the forest, there are irregular areas entirely free of tree growth.

== Wildlife ==
Commonly seen large wild animals include Coues white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, pronghorn, wild turkey and coyote. Cougar, bobcat, and black bear are seen less frequently. Bison that live in the forest and national park are owned by the state of Arizona that issues hunting permits within the national forest. Bison were introduced to northern Arizona in the early 1900s as part of a ranching operation to crossbreed them with cattle.

Common small animals in Kaibab National Forest include chipmunks, ground squirrels and Abert&#x27;s squirrels. Less common are porcupines, small lizards, and rattlesnakes. Most common birds are bluebirds, robins, Steller&#x27;s jays, nuthatches, flickers and other woodpeckers, crows, various hummingbirds, ravens, and a variety of hawks. Bats also occupy the park.

==Wilderness==
There are four designated wilderness areas in the Kaibab National Forest. Two in the North Kaibab Ranger District and two in the Williams Ranger District.
* Kanab Creek Wilderness (North Kaibab Ranger District)
* Kendrick Mountain Wilderness (Williams Ranger District) (partly in Coconino NF)
* Saddle Mountain Wilderness (North Kaibab Ranger District)
* Sycamore Canyon Wilderness (Williams Ranger District) (partly in Prescott NF and in Coconino NF)

==Attractions==

The historic Spring Valley Cabin, near Parks, Arizona in the Williams Ranger District, is available for rentals through the &quot;Rooms with a View&quot; Arizona Cabin Rental Program. The cabin was built in 1917. It served as the residence for rangers who worked at the guard station. The bunkhouse was the original office.

Located one mile south of the Grand Canyon, Hull Cabin is the oldest surviving historic cabin near the Grand Canyon’s south rim. This rustic cabin was built in 1889 as part of a sheep ranch, and was acquired by the Forest Service in 1907 for use as a ranger station. In 1985, the cabin was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Hull Cabin is also available for rentals through the &quot;Rooms with a View&quot; program.

A three-acre fishing facility, Perkins Tank is a blue ribbon trout fishing area. The tank was recently drained because of illegal green sunfish stocking.

(See Exploration of Mars) It was launched on November 30, 1964 at 13:12 UTC onboard Molniya 8K78 launch vehicle from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, USSR. The spacecraft was intended to survey Mars but lost communication before arrival.

==History==
Zond-2 carried a phototelevision camera of the same type later used to photograph the Moon on Zond 3. The camera system also included two ultraviolet spectrometers. As on Mars 1, an infrared spectrometer was installed to search for signs of methane on Mars.

Zond 2 also carried six Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (PPT) that served as actuators of the attitude control system. They were the first PPTs successfully used on a spacecraft. The PPT propulsion system was tested for 70 minutes on the 14 December 1964 when the spacecraft was 4.2 million kilometers from Earth.

Zond 2, a &quot;Mars 3MV-4A&quot; craft, was launched on November 30, 1964. During some maneuvering in early May 1965, communications were lost. Running on half power due to the loss of one of its solar panels, the spacecraft flew by Mars on August 6, 1965 at , away from the planet.

<text>74 Galatea is a large C-type main-belt asteroid. Its carbonaceous surface is very dark in color with an albedo of just 0.034. Galatea was found by the prolific comet discoverer Ernst Tempel on August 29, 1862, in Marseilles, France. It was his third asteroid discovery. It is named after one of the two Galateas in Greek mythology. A stellar occultation by Galatea was observed on September 8, 1987. The name Galatea has also been given to one of Neptune&#x27;s satellites.

Photometric observations of this asteroid made during 2008 at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico gave a light curve with a period of 17.270 ± 0.002 hours and a brightness variation of 0.08 ± 0.01 in magnitude. The curve displays four minima and four maxima. The spectra of the asteroid does not display evidence of aqueous alteration.

<doc id="736464" wikidata="Q312008" url="?curid=736464" title="Polyperchon">
<text>Polyperchon (sometimes written Polysperchon; ; b. between 390–380 BC – d. after 304 BC, possibly into 3rd century BC), was a Macedonian Greek general who served both Philip II and Alexander the Great and then played an active role in the ensuing battles for control between Alexander&#x27;s generals.

== Early career ==
Polyperchon was a son of Simmias from Tymphaia in Epirus. He served under Philip II and Alexander the Great, accompanying Alexander throughout his long journeys. After the Battle of Issus in 333, Polyperchon was given command of the Tymphaean battalion of the phalanx which he retained until 324.

After his return to Babylon, Polyperchon (along with other veterans) was sent back to Macedon with Craterus, but had only reached Cilicia by the time of Alexander&#x27;s death in 323. Craterus was to replace Antipater as Macedonia&#x27;s regent, but was of poor health. Polyperchon was to succeed Craterus in case the latter wouldn&#x27;t be able to govern. Polyperchon and Craterus continued onto Greece.

As Craterus&#x27; second in command Polyperchon acted as governor of Macedon and helped Antipater to defeat the Greek rebellion in the Lamian War. Polyperchon defeated the Thessalian cavalry of Menon, which was hitherto considered practically invincible.

Following the First War of the Diadochi, Polyperchon remained in Macedon while Antipater travelled to Asia Minor to assert his regency over the whole empire.

== Regent ==
Upon Antipater&#x27;s death in 319, Polyperchon was appointed regent and supreme commander of the entire empire but soon fell into conflict with Antipater&#x27;s son Cassander, who was to have been his chief lieutenant. The two fell into civil war, which quickly spread among all the successors of Alexander, with Polyperchon allying with Eumenes against Cassander, Antigonus and Ptolemy.

Although Polyperchon was initially successful in securing control of the Greek cities, whose freedom he proclaimed, he suffered a major setback at Megalopolis in 317 BC, a few months later his fleet was destroyed by Antigonus, and Cassander secured control of Athens the year after that. Shortly thereafter, Polyperchon was driven from Macedon by Cassander, who took control of the disabled king Philip Arrhidaeus and his wife Eurydice. Polyperchon fled to Epirus, where he joined Alexander&#x27;s mother Olympias, widow Roxana, and infant son Alexander IV. He formed an alliance with Olympias and King Aeacides of Epirus, and Olympias led an army into Macedon. She was initially successful, defeating and capturing the army of King Philip, whom she had murdered, but soon Cassander returned from the Peloponnesus and captured and murdered her in 316, taking Roxana and the boy king into his custody.

== Alliance with Antigonus ==
Polyperchon now fled to the Peloponnesus, where he still controlled a few strong points, and allied himself with Antigonus, who had by now fallen out with his former allies. Polyperchon surrendered the regency to Antigonus. Polyperchon soon controlled much of the Peloponnesus, including Corinth and Sicyon. Following the peace treaty of 311 between Antigonus and his enemies, and the murder of the boy-king Alexander and his mother, Polyperchon retained these areas, and when war again broke out between Antigonus and the others, Antigonus sent Alexander&#x27;s reputed illegitimate son Heracles to Polyperchon as a bargaining chip to use against Cassander. Polyperchon, however, decided to break with Antigonus and murdered the boy in 309.

== Later life ==
There is no certain date for Polyperchon&#x27;s death. He is last mentioned as being alive in 304, but the lack of further reference is only because Diodorus Siculus&#x27;s subsequent narrative is lost and no others cover this period in sufficient detail. A mention in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Pyrrhus&quot; 8.3 suggests that Polyperchon might have lived into the early 3rd century BC.

Polyperchon had a son named Alexander who participated in the Wars of the Diadochi, first under his father, then in league with Cassander.

<text>Mike Post (born Leland Michael Postil; September 29, 1944) is an American composer, best known for his television theme music for various shows, including &quot;The White Shadow&quot;; &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;; &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;; &quot;The A-Team&quot;; &quot;The Byrds of Paradise&quot;; &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;; &quot;Renegade;&quot; &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;; &quot;L.A. Law&quot;; &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;; &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;; &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, and &quot;Mammoth&quot;. He was also the producer of the &quot;Van Halen III&quot; album by the band Van Halen.

==Early musical career==
Post&#x27;s first credited work in music was cutting demos using two singing sisters, Terry and Carol Fischer. With Sally Gordon, they went on to become The Murmaids. Their first single, &quot;Popsicles and Icicles&quot; (written by David Gates), was a number 3 hit song in January 1964.

Post also provided early guidance for the garage rock band The Outcasts while in recruit training in San Antonio, Texas. He was the songwriter and producer for both songs on the band&#x27;s first single, released in 1965, and also arranged a local concert where they served as the back-up band.

He won his first of five Grammy Awards at age 23 for Best Instrumental Arrangement on Mason Williams&#x27; &quot;Classical Gas&quot;, a number 2 hit song in 1968. He is also credited as the record producer for Williams&#x27; LP that included that song, &quot;The Mason Williams Phonograph Record&quot;.

Billed as the Mike Post Coalition, their track &quot;Afternoon of the Rhino&quot; became a sought-after Northern soul track. The single peaked at number 47 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1975.

Post also worked with Kenny Rogers and produced the first three albums he recorded with his country/rock group Kenny Rogers and The First Edition (between 1967 and 1969). Post also produced Dolly Parton&#x27;s hit album &quot;9 to 5 and Odd Jobs&quot; in 1981. In 1997, he produced Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Van Halen III&quot; album.

==Television theme music==
One of his first jobs in television started when he was 24, as the musical director on &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;. Another early job was writing the theme music for the short-lived detective series &quot;Toma&quot; in 1973, but his big breakthrough (together with co-composer Pete Carpenter) came in the following year with his theme song for &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, another series by producer Stephen J. Cannell. The theme also got cross-over Top 40 radio airplay and earned a second Grammy for Post.

&quot;The Rockford Files&quot; theme became a Top 10 hit in both the U.S. (number 10) and Canada (number 8). It ranks as the 85th biggest U.S. hit of 1975, and the 84th biggest Canadian hit of 1975.

Post subsequently won Grammys for Best Instrumental Composition for the themes of the television shows &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; in 1981 and &quot;L.A. Law&quot; in 1988 as well as another Grammy in 1981 for Best Instrumental Performance for the &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; theme, which also reached number 10 in the U.S.
Post won an Emmy for his &quot;Murder One&quot; theme music, and had previously been nominated for &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, among others. He has won Broadcast Music, Inc. Awards for the music for &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, and the various &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; series. The theme for &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot; (co-written with Stephen Geyer) is one of the few television themes to reach as high as number 2 as a single record on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The &quot;dun, dun&quot; sound effect he created for the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise has entered popular culture and he has written variations on it for each new series.

At the peak of his career, Post was the go-to composer for all of the series created by Donald P. Bellisario, Steven Bochco, Stephen J. Cannell and Dick Wolf. Due to the considerable amount of music to be created, Post operated an office with multiple staff composers, among them Walter Murphy, Velton Ray Bunch, Frank Denson, Jerry Grant and Greg Edmonson, all composing side by side in cubicles. Each would write music cues to complement specific scenes from each show in Post&#x27;s signature style.

Other TV music works include &quot;The A-Team&quot;; &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot;; &quot;Blossom&quot;; &quot;The Commish&quot;; &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot;; &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot;; &quot;Hardcastle and McCormick&quot;; &quot;Hooperman&quot;; &quot;Hunter&quot;; &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;; &quot;NewsRadio&quot;; &quot;Profit&quot;; &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;; &quot;Renegade&quot;; &quot;Riptide&quot;; &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot;; &quot;Stingray&quot;; &quot;Tales of the Gold Monkey&quot;; &quot;Tenspeed and Brown Shoe&quot;; &quot;The White Shadow&quot;; &quot;Wiseguy&quot;; the BBC series &quot;Roughnecks&quot;; and &quot;Philly&quot;.

In 1994, Post scored the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;How To Murder Your Lawyer&quot;, designed as a backdoor pilot for a lawyer series.

In 2014, Post composed the score for the fake TV pilot &quot;Caged Heat&quot; in the &quot;All Hail the King&quot; short film for Marvel Studios.

In 2024, Post composed the theme music for BBC2 sitcom &quot;Mammoth&quot;, having initially met show creator Mike Bubbins when being interviewed on a BBC Radio Wales show.

==&quot;Inventions from the Blue Line&quot;==
In 1994, Post released a CD, called &quot;Inventions from the Blue Line&quot;. The CD contained several of his well-known themes, featuring &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; and also including &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot; and &quot;Renegade&quot;. In the liner notes, he discussed his late father, Sam Postil, and the admiration for law enforcement officers that Sam instilled in Mike. He also referred to police in the traditional nickname of &quot;blues&quot;, as in &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; (referring to the police in general and to police camaraderie). One of the tracks is called &quot;The Blue Line&quot;, which Post calls &quot;the theme&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The Pete Townshend song &quot;Mike Post Theme&quot;, which alludes to the ubiquity of Post&#x27;s work in television theme music, appears on The Who&#x27;s 2006 album, &quot;Endless Wire&quot;.

==BMI Foundation: &quot;The Pete Carpenter Fellowship&quot;==
In 1989, Broadcast Music, Inc. Foundation and Mike Post established &quot;The Pete Carpenter Fellowship&quot; in memory of the late Pete Carpenter, who was Post’s co-composer of television scores and themes including &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; (for which they won a Grammy), &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Riptide&quot;, &quot;Hardcastle and McCormick&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; and &quot;The A-Team&quot;. &quot;The Pete Carpenter Fellowship&quot; is an annual, competitive residency for aspiring television, film and video game composers.

<text>The Autobots are a fictional faction of sentient robots in the &quot;Transformers&quot; multimedia franchise. The Autobots are living robots from the planet Cybertron who, like most Transformers, are each imbued with a unique &quot;life force&quot; known as a &quot;spark.&quot; Led by Optimus Prime in most stories, the Autobots believe that &quot;freedom is the right of all sentient life&quot; and are often engaged in a civil war with the Decepticons, a faction of Transformers dedicated to military conquest and usually headed by Megatron. In a mirror universe portrayed in &quot;&quot;, the Autobots are villains opposed by the heroic Decepticons.

The transformation cog (&quot;T-cog&quot;) and the living metal of each transformer&#x27;s body allows them to change from their natural robotic body into an &quot;alternate mode&quot; based on some form of technology or life that they have scanned. When they were first introduced, most Autobots transformed into cars, trucks and other road vehicles. Over time, Autobots have been introduced with alternate modes that include aircraft, weapons, robotic animals, or a variety of devices (such as music equipment or microscopes). In most &quot;Transformers&quot; media, the Autobots originally transform into alien-style vehicles and technology native to their home planet Cybertron, but they later adopt alternate forms based on human technology after journeying to Earth.

In the live action films series, as well as in the CGI-animated series &quot;&quot;, the title Autobots is explained to be the short version of the title &quot;Autonomous Robotic Organisms.&quot; In Japan, the Autobots are called but are referred to as in the film series &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In Italy, they are called &quot;Autorobot.&quot; The Autobot insignia is also sometimes referred to as an &quot;Autobrand&quot;, a term that first appeared in issue #14 of the Marvel Comics series. The descendants of the Autobots, the Maximals from &quot;Transformers: Beast Wars&quot;, are also known as Cybertrons in Japan.

==Physical traits==
Autobots are living beings, sometimes referred to as &quot;bio-mechanical&quot; and often depicted as being forged from the same &quot;living metal&quot; that makes up their home planet Cybertron. This living metal can heal, grow, and regenerate like organic cell structures. Autobots, like all transformers, need to regularly feed on Energon (a form of energy they can produce from certain fuel sources) or they will grow weaker in health and eventually die. Autobots can also age, just much slower than humans, for example Optimus Prime is approximately 9 million years old. Whereas the first homo sapiens evolved 300,000 years ago.

Since the airing of the animated series &quot;&quot;, the franchise has consistently portrayed that what distinguishes a Transformer as &quot;living&quot; is that each of them is imbued with a &quot;spark&quot;, a charged mass of positrons that acts as a &quot;life force&quot; (said to be equivalent to a soul) and is unique to each transformer, granting them their basic personality and influencing certain physical traits. If a transformer dies, either from injury or a lack of Energon, their spark fades and might never be recovered again, as their spark typically returns to the source of positronic energy it originally came from. Some media portrays the source of these sparks as a pool of positronic energy located on Cybertron that is called the Well of All Sparks, while other media portrays the source to be an ancient artifact simply called the Allspark. Some stories have shown characters being able to preserve a dead transformer&#x27;s spark under the right circumstances, allowing that fallen transformer to return in a repaired body (though this possibility involves great risk and becomes more unlikely as more time passes).

When a transformer is first forged, they are in a &quot;Proto-form&quot; state that resembles either a featureless, mannequin-like robot or a being of liquid, shifting metal. As the transformer&#x27;s consciousness develops, the proto-form takes shape into a robotic form and an alternate mode is soon determined afterward. How long this process takes varies between different Transformers media. In some media, a Transformer can physically revert to a proto-form to make long space travel easier.

Along with their spark, each transformer has a mechanical &quot;brain module&quot; that houses their memories and regulates sensory input, as well as the transformation cog (or &quot;T-cog&quot;) which regulates and stabilizes their transformations. A transformer can have several parts of their body replaced or upgraded, but damage to the brain module or T-cog, as well as other more sensitive internal mechanics (such as eyes and voice boxes), are unique, difficult to upgrade, and can permanently affect or disable a transformer, as well as threaten their life, if seriously damaged.

Some transformers, including several Autobots, have traits that make them part of a subset of their species. Transformers who are so massive in size they are able to convert into fortresses or cities are known as Titans, some of whom (such as Metroplex) have allied themselves with the Autobots. &quot;City-speakers&quot; are transformers able to uniquely commune with Titans, such as the Autobot called Windblade. Like the Decepticons, the Autobots include &quot;combiners&quot; in their ranks, transformers who are able to merge with other specific transformers and become a gestalt, super-robot with greater power and its own distinct personality. In some stories, transformers are given the ability to become combiners by an ancient artifact called the Enigma of Combination. In Cybertron&#x27;s past, the Guardian Robots were large scale Transformers (though not as large as the Titans) who enforced authority and peace on their planet. While most Guardians are gone, one known as Omega Supreme serves alongside the Autobots. Mini-Cons (sometimes spelled Minicons) are small, human-sized transformers and, in some stories, are able to increase the power of larger transformers with whom they merge.

Due to their biological and sentient nature, Autobots are people, although humans constantly fail to acknowledge this due to their metal composition.

==Home planet==
In all &quot;Transformers&quot; stories, the Autobots and their adversaries, the Decepticons, originated on the planet Cybertron. The planet is almost always depicted as a metallic sphere covered in multi-level cities and structures. The capital of Cybertron is Iacon. Although there is no animal or plant life on Cybertron, animated cartoons have depicted it as having an atmosphere that human visitors can breathe, and some stories have shown the planet to experience weather, such as rainfall and storms.

Starting with the original series &quot;The Transformers&quot;, Cybertron is shown to house a seemingly living super-computer called Vector Sigma. At first, Vector Sigma is depicted to be the source of life for new transformers, imbuing the robots with life and personality. Later, media consistently portrays that Vector Sigma harnesses the power of another source known as the Allspark to imbue a transformer with its individual soul or &quot;spark.&quot; Different versions of Transformers media have also shown the life-giving energy of the Allspark to be an ancient artifact (either called the Allspark or the Cube) or have shown it to be a pool of positronic energy located on Cybertron known as the Well of AllSpark or Well of AllSparks.

The UK comic books written by Simon Furman established that Cybertron was once a god-like being named Primus. Following a battle with another god-like being known as Unicron, Primus transforms into Cybertron, a planet of &quot;living metal&quot;, and eventually uses his energies to grant life to living robots. In some stories, Primus does this in the hopes that these robots will become warriors who will defeat Unicron and similar threats. Following the introduction of Primus, it is said in some media that it is his mind that acts as the will of the super-computer Vector Sigma. Various stories depict the first living creations of Primus to be a group known as the &quot;original thirteen Primes&quot; or simply &quot;the Thirteen.&quot; Eventually, each of the thirteen Primes grants a copy of their nature and schematics into the Allspark energy source that will imbue later Cybertronians with life, making all later transformers their &quot;descendants&quot; who each inherit a unique combination of traits from at least some of the original Thirteen.

Although the transformer race originated on Cybertron, different groups of Cybertronians later left the planet and colonized other worlds. This has led to different factions of transformers with their own cultures and beliefs, some of whom become Autobots while others have no desire to involve themselves in Cybertron&#x27;s civil war.

==The Primes==
In the original toyline and animated series &quot;The Transformers&quot;, Optimus Prime (known as Convoy in Japan) is shown as the leader. Formerly named Orion Pax, his label of &quot;Prime&quot; is indicated to simply be part of the name he adopted when he became a soldier. Since the 1986 animated film &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; however, US and UK &quot;Transformers&quot; media have depicted &quot;prime&quot; as a title and rank given to the leader of the Autobots and sometimes all government of Cybertron (while Japanese media has portrayed &quot;convoy&quot; as a rank of military leadership in transformer society). Later media depicted earlier leaders of Cybertron to have names such as Nova Prime, Nominus Prime, and Sentinel Prime, along with others.

In several comics and cartoon stories, the Prime is a figurehead of a ruling council that governs Cybertron (or the entire transformer race that is scattered across different planets). Each Prime is chosen by and bonded to a powerful artifact called the Matrix of Leadership. The origin and nature of the Matrix differs across Transformers media, but it is consistently shown to be a powerful object that houses the memories and wisdom of previous Autobot leaders who wielded it. Often, the Matrix is shown to have a direct connection to Primus, a god-like being who became the planet Cybertron itself and created its race of living robots. Some media portray it as a conduit to the energy source of all transformer life and/or an access point to a dimension that acts as an afterlife for transformers. In some stories, being chosen by the Matrix of Leadership causes an immediate power enhancement and physical change in a transformer.

In several branches of the Transformers franchise, the title of &quot;Prime&quot; is a reference to Prima, a heroic warrior of Cybertron&#x27;s past. In these versions of canon, Prima is one of &quot;the original thirteen Primes (or &quot;the Thirteen&quot;) who are ancestors of the transformer race and direct creations of Primus, the god-like being who became Cybertron. Across Transformers media, Prima is the first to wield the Matrix of Leadership and his wisdom and essence are absorbed into it after he dies in battle with another ancient Prime known as Megatronus.

In some media, Optimus Prime eventually gives up his connection to the Matrix of Leadership and it is passed on to a new leader such as the Autobot soldier Ultra Magnus, the young Autobot fighter called Hot Rod (who becomes Rodimus Prime), or eventually Optimus Primal, a Maximal.

==&quot;Transformers: Generation 1&quot;==
==&quot;Transformers: Aligned&quot;==

A group of Autobots (referred to as Team Prime) appear in the 2010 animated series &quot;&quot;, led by Optimus Prime. The video game &quot;&quot; give a backstory to the Autobots days on Cybertron.
Set within an alternate timeline that parallels the show&#x27;s second season, the Autobots (Team Prime) appear in &quot;&quot;. Optimus Prime, Arcee, Bulkhead, Bumblebee, Ratchet, Jack, Miko and Raf embark on a journey to defeat the villainous Megatron and the Decepticons in his plan to use his secret new weapon. The Decepticons intercept a mysterious meteor approaching the Earth, and the Autobots arrive to try and thwart the Decepticons&#x27; plans. A massive eruption of power during the battle on the meteor breaks out, and the Autobots become separated from Jack, Miko and Raf, who are monitoring them at base. Unknown to the Autobots and their human friends, the Decepticons have uncovered Thunderwing, an ancient power that they will use to try to take over the Earth.

===&quot;Transformers: Prime&quot;===
In &quot;&quot;, with Cybertron dead, the Autobots scattered across the universe. A group landed on Earth consisting of Optimus Prime, Ratchet, Bumblebee, and Bulkhead and which Arcee and Cliffjumper join later. This small team of Autobots led by Optimus is rechristened Team Prime. During the final four episodes of the season, the Autobots unwillingly team up with Megatron to battle a legendary threat to Earth&#x27;s existence, Unicron.

==&quot;Transformers: EarthSpark&quot;==
Many years after the end of the war, the Autobots, now working with Megatron and the secret human organization G.H.O.S.T. to protect Earth from the remaining rogue Decepticons, reach out to the Malto family and offer the Terrans the chance to be mentored by Bumblebee. With new threats on the horizon, such as the mad scientist Dr. Meridian (Mandroid) and the various Decepticons still at large, the Autobots and Maltos work together to keep each other safe and find their place in the world while learning what it truly means to be a family. 

One year after the successful defeat and death of Mandroid, a group of Decepticons led by Starscream goes rogue sometime after the shattering of the Emberstone. It is up to the Terrans, the Autobots, the humans, and those Decepticons on their side (namely Megatron) to collect the shards before those Decepticons that sided with Starscream do. This leads to the creation of the Chaos Terrans and the discovery of some secrets about Witwicky itself; the secret includes an Earth-born female Titan Terran named Terratronus whose body was covered by mounds of rocks and soil that would later become the site of Witwicky.

The stakes eventually get higher when the Quintessons get involved and threaten the Maltos, the Autobots, and Earth following the Decepticons&#x27; departure from Earth on Prowl&#x27;s ship. Luckily the Autobots, and the Maltos along with the Chaos Terrans readily team up with Terratronus and successfully destroy the Quintessons for good so that the Quintessons would never harm anybody or anything on the planet Earth anymore.

== &quot;Transformers One&quot; ==

The Autobots were merely a group of Cybertronian miners without transformation cogs who mined Energon for the Quintessons, and they and all Cybertronians are led by their leader Sentinel Prime, having him as their trust. After discovering the truth about Sentinel by Orion Pax, they follow him to help him expose the truth against Sentinel&#x27;s crimes. Pax&#x27;s former friend D-16, kills Sentinel after letting Pax fall to his demise into the core of Iacon City, rechristening himself as Megatron. At the city&#x27;s core, Pax is blessed by the thirteen Primes and bestowed the Matrix of Leadership, becoming reborn as Optimus Prime. Prime returns to the city&#x27;s surface and successfully defeats Megatron and members of the High Guard who defect to his side, eventually banishing them for attempting to destroy Iacon. The miners are given their transformation cogs by Optimus Prime, who officially reforms them as the Autobots to protect Cybertron against the threat of the Quintessons, and promising they will maintain peace, order and will fight for justice throughout the galaxy.

<doc id="736491" wikidata="Q36280" url="?curid=736491" title="Marshallese language">
<text>Marshallese ( or ), also known as Ebon, is a Micronesian language spoken in the Marshall Islands. The language of the Marshallese people, it is spoken by nearly all of the country&#x27;s population of 59,000, making it the principal language. There are also roughly 27,000 Marshallese citizens residing in the United States, nearly all of whom speak Marshallese, as well as residents in other countries such as Nauru and Kiribati.

There are two major dialects, the western Rālik and the eastern Ratak.

== Classification ==
Marshallese, a Micronesian language, is a member of the Eastern Oceanic subgroup of the Austronesian languages. The closest linguistic relatives of Marshallese are the other Micronesian languages, including Gilbertese, Nauruan, Pohnpeian, Mokilese, Chuukese, Refaluwash, and Kosraean. Marshallese shows 50% lexical similarity with Gilbertese, Mokilese, and Pohnpeian.

Within the Micronesian archipelago, Marshallese—along with the rest of the Micronesian language group—is not as closely related to the more ambiguously classified Oceanic language Yapese in Yap State, or to the Polynesian outlier languages Kapingamarangi and Nukuoro in Pohnpei State, and even less closely related to the non-Oceanic languages Palauan in Palau and Chamorro in the Mariana Islands.

== Variation ==
The Republic of the Marshall Islands contains 34 atolls that are split into two chains, the eastern Ratak Chain and the western Rālik Chain. These two chains have different dialects, which differ mainly lexically, and are mutually intelligible. The atoll of Ujelang in the west was reported to have &quot;slightly less homogeneous speech&quot;, but it has been uninhabited since 1980.

The Ratak and Rālik dialects differ phonetically in how they deal with stems that begin with double consonants. Ratak Marshallese inserts a vowel to separate the consonants, while Ralik adds a vowel before the consonants (and pronounced an unwritten consonant phoneme before the vowel). For example, the stem &#x27;play&#x27; becomes in Rālik Marshallese and in Ratak Marshallese.

== Status ==

Marshallese is the official language of the Marshall Islands and enjoys vigorous use. As of 1979, the language was spoken by 43,900 people in the Marshall Islands. in 2020 the number was closer to 59,000. Additional groups of speakers in other countries including Nauru and the United States increase the total number of Marshallese speakers, with approximately 27,000 Marshallese-Americans living in the United States Along with Pohnpeian and Chuukese, Marshallese stands out among Micronesian languages in having tens of thousands of speakers; most Micronesian languages have far fewer. A dictionary and at least two Bible translations have been published in Marshallese.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
Marshallese has a large consonant inventory, and each consonant has some type of secondary articulation (palatalization, velarization, or rounding). The palatalized consonants are regarded as &quot;light&quot;, and the velarized and rounded consonants are regarded as &quot;heavy&quot;, with the rounded consonants being both velarized and labialized. (This contrast is similar to that between &quot;slender&quot; and &quot;broad&quot; consonants in Goidelic languages, or between &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; consonants in Slavic languages.) The &quot;light&quot; consonants are considered more relaxed articulations.
Although Marshallese has no voicing contrast in consonants, stops may be allophonically partially voiced (, , ), when they are between vowels and not geminated. (Technically, partially voiced stops would be , , , but this article uses voiced transcriptions , , for simplicity.) Final consonants are often unreleased.

Glides vanish in many environments, with surrounding vowels assimilating their backness and roundedness. That is motivated by the limited surface distribution of these phonemes as well as other evidence that backness and roundedness are not specified phonemically for Marshallese vowels. In fact, the consonant never surfaces phonetically but is used to explain the preceding phenomenon. ( and may surface phonetically in word-initial and word-final positions and, even then, not consistently.)

Bender (1968) explains that it was once believed there were six bilabial consonants because of observed surface realizations, , but he determined that two of these, , were actually allophones of respectively before front vowels and allophones of respectively before back vowels. Before front vowels, the velarized labial consonants actually tend to have rounded (labiovelarized) articulations , but they remain unrounded on the phonemic level, and there are no distinct phonemes. The pronunciation guide used by &quot;Naan&quot; (2014) still recognizes as allophone symbols separate from in these same conditions while recognizing that there are only palatalized and velarized phonemes. This article uses in phonetic transcriptions.

The consonant may be phonetically realized as , , , , , , or (or any of their voiced variants , , , , , , or ), in free variation. Word-internally it usually assumes a voiced fricative articulation as (or or ) but not when geminated. is used to adapt foreign sibilants into Marshallese. In phonetic transcription, this article uses and as voiceless and voiced allophones of the same phoneme.

Marshallese has no distinct phoneme.

The dorsal consonants are usually velar but with the tongue a little farther back , making them somewhere between velar and uvular in articulation. All dorsal phonemes are &quot;heavy&quot; (velarized or rounded), and none are &quot;light&quot; (palatalized). As stated before, the palatal consonant articulations , , and are treated as allophones of the palatalized &quot;coronal&quot; obstruent , even though palatal consonants are physically dorsal. For simplicity, this article uses unmarked in phonetic transcription.

Bender (1969) describes and as being &#x27;dark&#x27; &quot;r&quot;-colored, but is not more specific. The Marshallese-English Dictionary (MED) describes these as heavy dental nasals.

Consonants , and are all coronal consonants and full trills. is similar to Spanish with a trill position just behind the alveolar ridge, a postalveolar trill , but is a palatalized dental trill , articulated further forward behind the front teeth. The MED and Willson (2003) describe the rhotic consonants as &quot;retroflex&quot;, but are not clear how this relates to their dental or alveolar trill positions. (See retroflex trill.) This article uses , and in phonetic transcription.

The heavy lateral consonants and are dark &quot;l&quot; like in English &quot;feel&quot;, articulated and respectively. This article uses and in phonetic transcription.

The velarized consonants (and, by extension, the rounded consonants) may be velarized or pharyngealized like the emphatic consonants in Arabic or Mizrahi Hebrew.

===Vowels===
Marshallese has a vertical vowel system of just four vowel phonemes, each with several allophones depending on the surrounding consonants.

On the phonemic level, while Bender (1969) and Choi (1992) agree that the vowel phonemes are distinguished by height, they describe the abstract nature of these phonemes differently, with Bender treating the front unrounded surface realizations as their relaxed state that becomes altered by proximity of velarized or rounded consonants, while Choi uses central vowel symbols in a neutral fashion to notate the abstract phonemes and completely different front, back and rounded vowel symbols for surface realizations. Bender (1968, 1969), MED (1976) and Willson (2003) recognize four vowel phonemes, but Choi (1992) observes only three of the phonemes as having a stable quality, but theorizes that there may be a historical process of reduction from four to three, and otherwise ignores the fourth phoneme. For phonemic transcription of vowels, this article recognizes four phonemes and uses the front unrounded vowel notation of the MED, following the approach of Bender (1969) in treating the front vowel surface realizations as the representative phonemes.

On the phonetic level, Bender (1968), MED (1976), Choi (1992), Willson (2003) and &quot;Naan&quot; (2014) notate some Marshallese vowel surface realizations differently from one another, and they disagree on how to characterize the vowel heights of the underlying phonemes, with Willson (2003) taking the most divergent approach in treating the four heights as actually two heights each with the added presence (+ATR) or absence (-ATR) of advanced tongue root. Bender (1968) assigns central vowel symbols for the surface realizations that neighbor velarized consonants, but the MED (1976), Choi (1992) and Willson (2003) largely assign back unrounded vowel symbols for these, with the exception that the MED uses rather than cardinal for the close-mid back unrounded vowel, and Choi (1992) and Willson (2003) use rather than cardinal for the open back unrounded vowel. &quot;Naan&quot; (2014) is the only reference providing a vowel trapezium for its own vowels, and differs especially from the other vowel models in splitting the front allophones of into two realizations ( before consonants and in open syllables), merging the front allophones of and as before consonants and in open syllables, merging the rounded allophones of and as , and indicating the front allophone of as a close-mid central unrounded vowel , a realization more raised even than the front allophone of the normally higher . For phonetic notation of vowel surface realizations, this article largely uses the MED&#x27;s notation, but uses only cardinal symbols for back unrounded vowels.

Superficially, 12 Marshallese vowel allophones appear in minimal pairs, a common test for phonemicity. For example, (, &#x27;breadfruit&#x27;), (, &#x27;but&#x27;), and (, &#x27;taboo&#x27;) are separate Marshallese words. However, the uneven distribution of glide phonemes suggests that they underlyingly end with the glides (thus , , ). When glides are taken into account, it emerges that there are only 4 vowel phonemes.

When a vowel phoneme appears between consonants with different secondary articulations, the vowel often surfaces as a smooth transition from one vowel allophone to the other. For example, &#x27;shy&#x27;, phonemically , is often realized phonetically as . It follows that there are 24 possible short diphthongs in Marshallese:

These diphthongs are the typical realizations of short vowels between two non-glide consonants, but in reality the diphthongs themselves are not phonemic, and short vowels between two consonants with different secondary articulations can be articulated as either a smooth diphthong (such as ) or as a monophthong of one of the two vowel allophones (such as ), all in free variation. Bender (1968) also observes that when the would-be diphthong starts with a back rounded vowel and ends with a front unrounded vowel , then a vowel allophone associated with the back unrounded vowels (notated in this article as ) may also occur in the vowel nucleus. Because the cumulative visual complexity of notating so many diphthongs in phonetic transcriptions can make them more difficult to read, it is not uncommon to phonetically transcribe Marshallese vowel allophones only as one predominant monophthongal allophone, so that a word like can be more simply transcribed as , in a condensed fashion. Before Bender&#x27;s (1968) discovery that Marshallese utilized a vertical vowel system, it was conventional to transcribe the language in this manner with a presumed inventory of 12 vowel monophthong phonemes, and it remains in occasional use as a more condensed phonetic transcription. This article uses phonemic or diphthongal phonetic transcriptions for illustrative purposes, but for most examples it uses condensed phonetic transcription with the most relevant short vowel allophones roughly corresponding to Marshallese orthography as informed by the MED.

Some syllables appear to contain long vowels: &#x27;future&#x27;. They are thought to contain an underlying glide (, or ), which is not present phonetically. For instance, the underlying form of is . Although the medial glide is not realized phonetically, it affects vowel quality; in a word like , the vowel transitions from to and then back to , as . In condensed phonetic transcription, the same word can be expressed as or .

===Phonotactics===
Syllables in Marshallese follow CV, CVC, and VC patterns. Marshallese words always underlyingly begin and end with consonants. Initial, final, and long vowels may be explained as the results of underlying glides not present on the phonetic level. Initial vowels are sometimes realized with an onglide or but not consistently:
* &#x27;weave&#x27;

Only homorganic consonant sequences are allowed in Marshallese, including geminate varieties of each consonant, except for glides. Non-homorganic clusters are separated by vowel epenthesis even across word boundaries. Some homorganic clusters are also disallowed:
* Obstruent-obstruent, nasal-nasal, liquid-liquid, nasal-obstruent, and nasal-liquid clusters undergo assimilation of the secondary articulation except if the first consonant is a rounded coronal or a rounded dorsal. Then, the clusters undergo assimilation of the rounded articulation.
* †Obstruent-liquid and liquid-obstruent clusters besides and undergo epenthesis.
* Liquid-nasal clusters undergo nasal assimilation.
* Obstruent-nasal clusters undergo epenthesis (if coronal) or nasal assimilation (if non-coronal).
* Clusters involving any glides undergo epenthesis, including otherwise homorganic clusters of two of the same glide.

The following assimilations are created, with empty combinations representing epenthesis.




The vowel height of an epenthetic vowel is not phonemic as the epenthetic vowel itself is not phonemic, but is still phonetically predictable given the two nearest other vowels and whether one or both of the cluster consonants are glides. Bender (1968) does not specifically explain the vowel heights of epenthetic vowels between two non-glides, but of his various examples containing such vowels, none of the epenthetic vowels has a height lower than the highest of either of their nearest neighboring vowels, and the epenthetic vowel actually becomes if the two nearest vowels are both . &quot;Naan&quot; (2014) does not take the heights of epenthetic vowels between non-glides into consideration, phonetically transcribing all of them as a schwa . But when one of the consonants in a cluster is a glide, the height of the epenthetic vowel between them follows a different process, assuming the same height of whichever vowel is on the opposite side of that glide, forming a long vowel with it across the otherwise silent glide. Epenthetic vowels do not affect the rhythm of the spoken language, and can never be a stressed syllable. Phonetic transcription may indicate epenthetic vowels between two non-glides as non-syllabic, using IPA notation similar to that of semi-vowels. Certain Westernized Marshallese placenames spell out the epenthetic vowels:
* Ebeye, from earlier &quot;Ebeje&quot;, from 
* Erikub, from 
* Kwajalein, from 
* Majuro, from 
* Namorik, from 
* Omelek, from (&quot;&quot;)
* Rongelap, from 
* Rongerik, from 
* Ujelang, from 
* Uliga, from 
* Utirik, from 
Epenthetic vowels in general can be omitted without affecting meaning, such as in song or in enunciated syllable breaks. This article uses non-syllabic notation in phonetic IPA transcription to indicate epenthetic vowels between non-glides.

=== Timing ===
The short vowel phonemes and the approximant phonemes all occupy a roughly equal duration of time. Though they occupy time, the approximants are generally not articulated as glides, and Choi (1992) does not rule out a deeper level of representation. In particular, short vowels occupy one unit of time, and long vowels (for which is an approximant phoneme) are three times as long.

As a matter of prosody, each consonant and vowel phonemic sequence carries one mora in length, with the exception of in sequences where the vowel carries one mora for both phonemes. All morae are thus measured in or shut sequences:
* is two morae: . It is also the shortest possible length of a Marshallese word.
* is three morae: . Since approximants are also consonants, long vowel sequences of are also three morae.
* is four morae: .
* Prefixes like are sequences occupying only one mora but are attached to words rather than standing as words on their own.
* Suffixes like are sequences. The syllable itself occupies two morae but adds only one mora to the word because the vowel attaches itself to the last consonant phoneme in the word, changing into .

That makes Marshallese a mora-rhythmed language in a fashion similar to Finnish, Gilbertese, Hawaiian, and Japanese.

===Historic sound changes===
Marshallese consonants show splits conditioned by the surrounding Proto-Micronesian vowels. Proto-Micronesian *k *ŋ *r become rounded next to *o or next to *u except in bisyllables whose other vowel is unrounded. Default outcomes of *l and *n are palatalized; they become velarized or rounded before *a or sometimes *o if there is no high vowel in an adjacent syllable. Then, roundedness is determined by the same rule as above.

==Orthography==
Marshallese is written in the Latin alphabet. There are two competing orthographies. The &quot;old&quot; orthography was introduced by missionaries. This system is not highly consistent or faithful in representing the sounds of Marshallese, but until recently, it had no competing orthography. It is currently widely used, including in newspapers and signs. The &quot;new&quot; orthography is gaining popularity especially in schools and among young adults and children. The &quot;new&quot; orthography represents the sounds of the Marshallese language more faithfully and is the system used in the Marshallese–English dictionary by Abo et al., currently the only complete published Marshallese dictionary.

Here is the current alphabet, as promoted by the Republic of the Marshall Islands. It consists of 24 letters.


Marshallese spelling is based on pronunciation rather than a phonemic analysis. Therefore, backness is marked in vowels despite being allophonic (it does not change the meaning), and many instances of the glides proposed on the phonemic level are unwritten, because they do not surface as consonants phonetically. In particular, the glide , which never surfaces as a consonant phonetically, is always unwritten.

The letter is generally used only in three situations:
#To mark a rounded consonant (one of ) or approximant phoneme () before a vowel that precedes an unrounded consonant phoneme (). Even then, if the consonant phoneme comes after a back rounded vowel and before another vowel, it is common to write one of instead of , but the rounded dorsal consonants are still written with in these circumstances.
#To mark a velarized bilabial consonant (either or ) before a vowel that precedes a palatalized consonant phoneme ().
#To indicate a glide phonetically surfacing either word-initially or between two vowels.
 is never written out word-finally or before another consonant.

* &quot;Kwajalein&quot;.

The palatal glide phoneme may also be written out but only as before one of , or as before one of either . The approximant is never written before any of . A stronger raised palatal glide , phonemically analyzed as the exotic un-syllabic consonant-vowel-consonant sequence rather than plain , may occur word-initially before any vowel and is written . For historical reasons, certain words like may be written as with a , which does not otherwise exist in the Marshallese alphabet.

One source of orthographic variation is in the representation of vowels. Pure monophthongs are written consistently based on vowel quality. However, short diphthongs may often be written with one of the two vowel sounds that they contain. (Alternate phonetic realizations for the same phonemic sequences are provided purely for illustrative purposes.)
* &quot;all; every&quot;.
Modern orthography has a bias in certain spelling choices in which both possibilities are equally clear between two non-approximant consonants.
* is preferred over .
*: &quot;big&quot;, not 
* is preferred over .
*: &quot;small&quot;, not 
* Historically, both and have been common and sometimes interchangeable. It is still true today with some words. In the new orthography, is generally preferred over in most such situations.
*: &quot;atoll; island; land&quot;, not 
*: &quot;Ebadon&quot;, not 
*: &quot;Christmas&quot;, not 
*: &quot;Nell&quot;, not 
* However, after one of and before one of unrounded , the spelling is preferred over .
*: &quot;pencil&quot;, not 
* For the name of the Marshall Islands, the new orthography prefers , but the spelling with is still found.
*: or , &quot;Marshall Islands&quot;

In a syllable whose first consonant is rounded and whose second consonant is palatalized, it is common to see the vowel between them written as one of , usually associated with a neighboring velarized consonant:
* &quot;August&quot;.
* &quot;Ujelang&quot;.
The exception is long vowels and long diphthongs made up of two mora units, which are written with the vowel quality closer to the phonetic nucleus of the long syllable:
* &quot;kindness&quot;.
* &quot;will be&quot;.
* &quot;taxicab&quot;.
If the syllable is phonetically open, the vowel written is usually the second vowel in the diphthong: the word is usually not written any other way, but exceptions exist such as ( &quot;land; country; island; atoll&quot;), which is preferred over because the spelling emphasizes that the first (unwritten) glide phoneme is dorsal rather than palatal.

The spelling of grammatical affixes, such as () and () is less variable despite the fact that their vowels become diphthongs with second member dependent on the preceding/following consonant: the prefix may be pronounced as any of depending on the stem. The term (&quot;Marshallese people&quot;) is actually pronounced as if it were .

===Display issues===
In the most polished printed text, the letters always appear with unaltered cedillas directly beneath, and the letters always appear with unaltered macrons directly above. Regardless, the diacritics are often replaced by ad hoc spellings using more common or more easily displayable characters. In particular, the &quot;Marshallese-English Online Dictionary&quot; (but not the print version), or MOD, uses the following characters:

As of 2019, there are no dedicated precomposed characters in Unicode for the letters ; they must be displayed as plain Latin letters with combining diacritics, and even many Unicode fonts will not display the combinations properly and neatly. Although exist as precomposed characters in Unicode, these letters &quot;also&quot; do not display properly as Marshallese letters in most Unicode fonts. Unicode defines the letters as having a cedilla, but fonts usually display them with a comma below because of rendering expectations of the Latvian alphabet. For many fonts, a workaround is to encode these letters as the base letter followed by a zero-width non-joiner and then a combining cedilla, producing .

Both systems already require fonts that display Basic Latin (with ) and Latin Extended-A (with ). The standard orthography also requires Combining Diacritical Marks for the combining diacritics. The MOD&#x27;s alternative letters have the advantage of being neatly displayable as all-precomposed characters in any Unicode fonts that support Basic Latin, Latin Extended-A along with Latin-1 Supplement (with ) and Latin Extended Additional (with ). If a font comfortably displays both the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration and the Vietnamese alphabet, it can also display MOD Marshallese.

This chart highlights the display issues in common web fonts and common free Unicode fonts that are known to support standard or MOD Marshallese lettering. Distinct typefaces appear only if the operating environment supports them. Some fonts have combining diacritic alignment issues, and the vast majority of the fonts have the Latvian diacritic issue; of the fonts shown below, only the Noto series displays Marshallese correctly.
===Differences in orthography===
The old orthography was still very similar to the new orthography but made fewer phonological distinctions in spelling than the new orthography does. The new orthography attempts phonological consistency while adhering to most of the spelling patterns of the old orthography, especially in regard to vowels and . It has made the new orthography relatively easy for old orthography users to learn. The phonology of Marshallese was documented by Bender (1969) with written examples using the old orthography. Here are some differences between the new and old orthographies:
* The new orthography uses the cedillaed letters . The old orthography did not use cedillas and ambiguously wrote them .
* The new orthography uses for &quot;light&quot; and for &quot;heavy&quot; . The old orthography used for both.
*: Compare old vs. new , &#x27;pencil&#x27;.
* The new orthography consistently uses for &quot;light&quot; in all positions. The old orthography often wrote before vowels, and after vowels.
*: Compare old vs. new , &#x27;United States&#x27;.
*: Compare old or vs. new , &#x27;forever&#x27;.
* Except in certain affixes like whose spelling may be fixed, the new orthography spells the vowel monophthong allophone as in all positions. The old orthography had , but it was relatively less common, and was sometimes written instead.
*: Compare old vs. new , &#x27;Ebeye&#x27;.
* Except in certain affixes like whose the spelling of the vowels may be fixed, the new orthography spells the vowel monophthong allophone as in all positions. The old orthography spelled as between consonants.
*: Compare old vs. new , &#x27;Christmas&#x27;.
* The new orthography uses only for allophones of the vowel phoneme . In the old orthography, some words used , but other words used instead.
*: Compare old vs. new , &#x27;land&#x27;.
* The new orthography uses the letter for the vowel monophthong allophone along with many of its related diphthong allophones. The old orthography spelt as between consonants but at the ends of words.
*: Compare old vs. new , &#x27;hello; good bye; love&#x27;.
*: Compare old vs. new , &#x27;taboo&#x27;.
* The new orthography tries to consistently write long vowels and geminated consonants with double letters. The old orthography habitually wrote these as single letters.
*: Compare old vs. new , &#x27;study&#x27;.
*: Compare old vs. new , &#x27;no&#x27;.
* The word (&#x27;hello; goodbye; love&#x27;) and the phrase (&#x27;hello [to you]&#x27;) are a special case. The new orthography&#x27;s rules use , while the old orthography&#x27;s rules used . However, has been historically more entrenched in both orthographies, but the letter does not exist in the normal spelling rules of either orthography. That spelling has multilingual significance as well; is also the established spelling for the greeting when used in Marshallese-influenced English and by anglophones in the Marshall Islands.

==Bender&#x27;s orthography==
In his 1968 publication &quot;Marshallese Phonology&quot;, linguist Byron W. Bender designed a purely morphophonemic orthography, containing only non-IPA symbols corresponding to consonant phonemes, vowel phonemes and regular reflexes between the dialects, intended for use in dictionaries and language teaching. Besides also appearing in his 1969 tutorial &quot;Spoken Marshallese&quot;, it appeared in a modified form alongside the &quot;new&quot; orthography in the 1976 &quot;Marshallese-English Dictionary&quot; (MED) to which he contributed. Bender later collaborated with Stephen Trussel when the MED was adapted to website format as the &quot;Marshallese-English Online Dictionary&quot; (MOD), with Bender&#x27;s orthography appearing in an again-modified form.

The MOD&#x27;s version of Bender&#x27;s orthography uses under-dot diacritics instead of the cedillas used both by the &quot;new&quot; orthography and by the 1976 MED&#x27;s version of Bender&#x27;s orthography, for reasons specific to the MOD&#x27;s display issues.

In addition to plain sequences of phonemes, Bender&#x27;s orthography recognizes a few special sequences, many of which relate to regular differences between the Rālik and Ratak dialects of Marshallese.
* is for a &quot;passing over lightly&quot; version of the vowel allophone that occurs at the beginning of certain words, phonetically pronounced and existing on the phonemic level as . For example, is equivalent to &quot;hello; goodbye; love&quot;.
* is for a &quot;dwelling upon&quot; version of that occurs at the beginning of certain words, now generally written in the &quot;new&quot; orthography, phonetically pronounced and existing on the phonemic level as , effectively making it identical to . An example is , which is equivalent to &quot;reunion&quot;.
* at the beginning of a word, without apostrophes, indicates a version of whose reflex differs between the two dialects. In the Rālik dialect, this assumes the &quot;dwelling upon&quot; pronunciation, equivalent to . In the Ratak dialect, it instead assumes the &quot;passing over lightly&quot; pronunciation, equivalent to . An example is , equivalent to &quot;road&quot;:
** In the Rālik dialect, becomes and is often instead written as in the &quot;new&quot; orthography.
** In the Ratak dialect, becomes .
* at the beginning of a word (where &quot;V&quot; can be any vowel) indicates a back unrounded vowel that whose reflex differs between the dialects. In the Rālik dialect, becomes , lengthening the vowel. In the Ratak dialect, the second disappears, becoming , and the vowel remains short. An example is , equivalent to &quot;yes&quot;:
** In the Rālik dialect, becomes and is often instead written as in the &quot;new&quot; orthography.
** In the Ratak dialect, becomes .
* at the beginning of a word (where &quot;V&quot; can be any vowel) is usually equivalent to .
* at the beginning of a word (where &quot;V&quot; can be any vowel) usually becomes in the Rālik dialect, but usually becomes in the Ratak dialect.
* When a Bender orthography spelling begins with a doubled consonant other than , such as &quot;good&quot;, its reflex differs between the dialects.
** In the Rālik dialect, becomes , sprouting both a prothetic and a vowel. The dialect generally spells this &quot;good&quot; in the &quot;new&quot; orthography, making it homophonous with the phrase which means &quot;it is good&quot; in both dialects.
** In the Ratak dialect, becomes with only a prothetic vowel, appearing instead between the two consonants. The dialect generally spells this &quot;good&quot; in the &quot;new&quot; orthography.
** In both dialects, the prothetic vowel is equivalent to the first stem vowel unless it is , in which case the stem vowel is always paired with the prothetic vowel . But when spellings like take prefixes with a vowel, there are no prothetic vowels: &quot;person&quot; + &quot;good&quot; becomes , which the &quot;new&quot; orthography spells &quot;good person&quot;.

==Grammar==

===Morphology===
Nouns are not overtly marked as such, and do not inflect for number, gender, or case. Nouns are often verbalized and verbs nominalized without any overt morphological marker:

Marshallese has determiners and demonstratives which follow the noun they modify. These are marked for number, and in the plural also encode a human/nonhuman distinction. For example, in the singular &#x27;the pencil&#x27; and &#x27;the boy&#x27; take the same determiner, but in the plural &#x27;the pencils&#x27; and have different determiners. Indefinites are an exception; in the singular they are expressed with the word &#x27;one&#x27; before the noun (e.g. &#x27;a song&#x27;), and there is no plural indefinite determiner.

The Marshallese demonstrative system has five levels:
# near the speaker (sg. / pl. human / pl. nonhuman )
# near the speaker and listener ()
# near the listener ()
# away from both speaker and listener ()
# distant but visible ().


Marshallese possesses two sets of 1st and 2nd person singular pronouns, known as &quot;absolutive&quot; or &quot;emphatic&quot; pronouns and as &quot;objective&quot; pronouns. Marshallese 1st person plurals mark for clusivity. Third person objective pronouns may only be used for humans; nonhumans instead take a null pronoun:

The emphatic pronouns serve as subjects of equational sentences, as complements of prepositions, in order to emphasize objects, in coordination structures, and with topicalized or focused subjects. It is common in Oceanic languages for a special type of pronoun to be used in equational sentences and for topicalization or focus.

Marshallese has four verb tenses: present, past, near future, and future. The tenses are formed by adding a tense suffix to the personal pronoun in the sentence. If the subject is not a personal pronoun, a third-person pronoun is added with the appropriate tense suffix. The present tense is formed by attaching the suffix -j to the personal pronoun (-ij for kōm and koṃ). The suffix for the past tense is either -ar or -kar depending on the dialect. -naaj is the suffix used for the regular future tense and -itōn is used for the near future.

===Syntax===
Marshallese, like many Micronesian languages, divides sentences into two types: predicational sentences and equational sentences. Predicational sentences have SVO word order and a main verb:

In equational sentences, both the subject and predicate are noun phrases:

The airport was renovated in the 1980s with the development of a new terminal area, in order to meet domestic traffic demands within the Soviet Union.

When Armenia declared its independence from the Soviet Union in the 1990s, the growth of cargo shipments resulted in the construction of a new cargo terminal in 1998 that can handle about 100,000 tonnes of cargo annually. In 2001, a 30-year concession agreement for the management of operations at the airport was signed with Armenia International Airports CJSC, owned by Argentine company Corporación America, which is in turn owned by Armenian Argentine businessman Eduardo Eurnekian. As part of that agreement, Armenia International Airports CJSC renovated the runways, main taxiways, and ramps. In 2006, a new gate area and arrivals hall opened, followed by an overall improvement of the airport&#x27;s fire services, including replacing the entire fire-fighting fleet with new vehicles. A new departures and arrivals terminal, car-parking facility with a capacity of 600 vehicles, and a government delegation terminal all opened in 2011. On 30 January 2013, Zvartnots airport was named &quot;Best Airport In the CIS&quot; during the Emerging Markets Airports Award (EMAA) ceremonies held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

In March 2024, Armenia officially expelled Russian border guards who had been stationed at the airport. Their withdrawal was completed on 31 July.

==Overview==
The airport is able to accept aircraft up to and including the Antonov An-225, Boeing 747-400 and Airbus A380. Runway 08 is equipped with an ILS CAT II, which enables aircraft operations in low ceiling (30 meters) and visibility (350 metres).

Zvartnots International Airport recently implemented a new flight information display system (FIDS), a new automated and biometric-identification system for baggage check-in and passenger control, as well as the installation of 150 surveillance cameras across airport premises.

The access to the boarding area is highly secured with three steps, a pre-control, a passport control, and X-ray control. The airport features a Dufry duty-free shop after security, as well as the Converse Bank business class lounge, with a view overlooking the gate area and apron. In addition, the airport features a HayPost office, a pharmacy, several dining options and cafes, a Europcar, Beeline, VivaCell MTS, Ardshinbank, as well as, HSBC, VTB Bank, and Ameriabank ATMs.

In December 2019, yearly passenger flow at Zvartnots International Airport exceeded 3 million passengers for the first time in Armenia&#x27;s history. In 2023, passenger flow at Zvartnots exceeded 5 million passengers for the first time.

<text>Zond 4, part of the Soviet Zond program and an uncrewed version of Soyuz 7K-L1 crewed Moon-flyby spacecraft, was one of the first Soviet experiments towards crewed circumlunar spaceflight. It was launched to test the spaceworthiness of the new capsule and to gather data about flights in circumterrestrial space. It was the first Soviet spacecraft to possess a computer, the 34 kg Argon 11.

The spacecraft was successfully launched by a Proton D-1e on 2 March 1968 into a 400,000 km apogee orbit 180 degrees away from the Moon. It was launched away from the Moon probably to avoid trajectory complications with lunar gravity. However, on re-entry the L1&#x27;s guidance system failed. It hit the atmosphere precisely at the calculated time, but was not guided to generate lift and fly out of the atmosphere again. A ballistic re-entry would mean no recovery on Soviet soil, so the APO destruct system automatically blew up the capsule at 10 to 15 km altitude, 180–200 km off the African coast at Guinea.

The Zond 4 flight was in some ways similar to the American Apollo 4 and 6 missions as they were uncrewed test flights in highly elliptical Earth orbits.

<text>Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport is an airport that serves the nation of Belize&#x27;s largest city, Belize City along the eastern coast of Central America. It was named after politician Philip S. W. Goldson, who died in 2001. The airport is at an elevation of , which means both the airport and the entirety of Belize City are at risk of serious flooding due to its low elevation and coastal location. For this reason, Belize&#x27;s capital has been moved to Belmopan, but the airport remains the largest and busiest in the country. With stable passenger growth, Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport is currently the fifth busiest airport in Central America. Belize Airport covers 457 acres (185 ha) of land and has one runway.

The airport is about 30 minutes drive from Belize City&#x27;s centre, in Ladyville. In mid-2020, a new paved access road was completed from the George Price Highway, eight kilometres north, across the Belize River, directly to the side of the airfield where the passenger terminal is located.

==History==

Originally known as Belize International Airport, the airport was renamed in honor of Philip S. W. Goldson on 7 February 1988.

==Military use==

Due to the Belizean–Guatemalan territorial dispute, Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport has hosted several military units over the years since its construction. In 1984, a senior US Air Force General stated that it was &quot;the best defended airfield in Central America&quot;. Most notable residents have been Headquarters British Forces Belize, No. 1417 (Tactical Ground Attack) Flight RAF operating Harrier jump jets, No. 1563 (Helicopter support) Flight RAF, resident Anti-Aircraft Squadrons of the RAF Regiment, resident helicopter units of the Army Air Corps, HarDet Belize, Butcher Radar and Belize Defence Forces, among others. Price Barracks is a military installation located just north of the airport, which was formerly known as Airport Camp, the headquarters of British Forces Belize.

==Historical airline service==

In 1950, TACA Airlines (which is now Avianca Honduras) was operating weekly nonstop flights to New Orleans and San Salvador as well as weekly direct one stop service to Managua with Douglas DC-4 propliners. TACA subsequently began operating Vickers Viscount turboprops on a weekly southbound service flying a routing of New Orleans - Belize City - Guatemala City - San Salvador - Tegucigalpa - Managua - San Jose, Costa Rica - Panama City, Panama. In 1953, British West Indian Airways (BWIA, which is now Caribbean Airlines) in association with British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC, which is now British Airways) was operating one flight a week to Belize from Kingston, Jamaica via an intermediate stop in Grand Cayman with a Vickers VC.1 Viking twin-prop aircraft with this flight offering connecting service via Kingston from a BOAC flight that operated a routing from London, England via stops in New York City, Nassau, Bahamas and Montego Bay, Jamaica. BWIA in conjunction with BOAC would later operate weekly nonstop service between the airport and Kingston with Vickers Viscount turboprop aircraft. Thirty years later in 1983, four airlines were operating jet service into the airport according to the Official Airline Guide (OAG) including Air Florida with nonstop Boeing 737-200 flights from Miami and San Pedro Sula, Servicio Aereo de Honduras (SAHSA) with nonstop Boeing 727-100 flights from Houston (via Houston Intercontinental Airport), New Orleans and San Pedro Sula, TACA Airlines International with nonstop Boeing 737-200 and British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven flights from Houston (via Houston Intercontinental Airport), Miami, New Orleans and San Salvador, and Transportes Aereos Nacionales (TAN Airlines) with nonstop Boeing 737-200 flights from Miami and San Pedro Sula while local air carrier Maya Airways was operating domestic service in Belize with Britten-Norman Islander twin-prop aircraft. Also according to the OAG, by 1989 TACA had introduced wide body Boeing 767-200 nonstop service to Miami in addition to its Boeing 737-200 flights with other service to Miami at this time being operated by Eastern Airlines with Boeing 727-200s as well as TAN with Boeing 737-200s.

Belize Airways Ltd. was a scheduled passenger airline based at the airport which operated flights to Miami, San Pedro Sula, San Salvador and La Ceiba with Boeing 720 and stretched British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven series 500 jetliners operated at various times during its existence from 1977 to 1980 according to its timetables.

<text>The province of Reggio Emilia (; Emilian: &quot;pruvînsa ed Rèz&quot;) is a province in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. The capital city, which is the most densely populated &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in the province, is Reggio Emilia.

It has an area of around and, , has a population of 525,366. There are 42 &quot;comuni&quot; in the province. Rolo, the smallest &quot;comune&quot; in the province by area, is the &quot;comune&quot; farthest to the East. Ventasso is the &quot;comune&quot; farthest to the West. The border towns of the province are Ventasso, which is the smallest &quot;comune&quot; by population, to the south and Luzzara in the north. Luzzara is the second largest &quot;comune&quot; in Emilia-Romagna and has the highest number of foreign nationals in the region.

The province is home to the historical Canossa Castle, property of the countess Matilde; it is where the Walk to Canossa of Henry IV occurred. Representatives of the free municipalities of Reggio, Modena, Bologna and Ferrara met in Reggio Emilia&#x27;s Sala del Tricolore in 1797 to proclaim the &quot;Repubblica Cispadana&quot;, adopting the three colour green-white-red flag to represent their newly formed Republic; it was later adopted in 1848 as the national flag.

==Education==
Four faculties of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia are located in Reggio Emilia. The Faculty of Engineering and Agriculture was established in Reggio Emilia in 1998, followed by the Faculties of Communication Sciences and of Education Sciences. It is home to the Orto Botanico dell&#x27;Università di Modena e Reggio Emilia.

The Reggio Emilia approach to preschool education was started by the schools of Reggio Emilia after World War II and it&#x27;s well-known all over the world, being one of the most advanced systems at present times. It is based and inspired on theories of Malaguzzi, Bruner, Vygotsky, Dewey, Piaget and Gardner. Reggio Emilia holds the International Centre Loris Malaguzzi, a modern structure where the Reggio Emilia approach is implemented, exported and spread around the world.

==Sports==
With sports arenas including the Stadio Giglio and PalaBigi, Reggio Emilia is home to the basketball team Pallacanestro Reggiana. The Camparini Gioielli Cup is a yearly challenger-level tennis tournament played on clay in Reggio Emilia. AC Reggiana 1919 is the historical soccer team of Reggio Emilia; it currently plays in the second national soccer league Serie B. Stadio Giglio (actual attendance is 29,650) is the home play ground for AC Reggiana 1919.

<doc id="736528" wikidata="Q46479" url="?curid=736528" title="Zarah Leander">
<text>Zarah Leander (; 15 March 1907 – 23 June 1981) was a Swedish singer and actress whose greatest success was in Germany between 1936 and 1943, when she was contracted to work for the state-owned Universum Film AG (UFA). Although no exact record sales numbers exist, she was probably among Europe&#x27;s best-selling recording artists in the years prior to 1945. Her involvement with UFA caused some of her films and lyrics to be identified as Nazi propaganda. Though she had taken no public political position and was dubbed an &quot;Enemy of Germany&quot; by Joseph Goebbels, she remained a controversial figure for the rest of her life. As a singer, Leander was known for her confident style and her deep contralto voice, and was also known as a &quot;female baritone&quot;.

==Early career==
She was born as Sara Stina Hedberg in Karlstad, studying piano and violin as a child, and sang on stage for the first time at the age of six. She initially had no intention of becoming a professional performer and led an ordinary life for several years. As a teenager she lived two years in Riga, Latvia (1922–1924), where she learned German, took up work as a secretary, married Nils Leander (1926), and had two children (1927 and 1929). However, in 1929 she was engaged, as an amateur, in a touring cabaret by the entertainer and producer Ernst Rolf and for the first time sang &quot;Vill ni se en stjärna&quot; (&quot;Do You Want to See a Star?&quot;), which soon would become her signature tune.
In 1930, she participated in four cabarets in the capital, Stockholm, made her first records, including a cover of Marlene Dietrich&#x27;s &quot;Falling in Love Again&quot;, and played a part in a film. However, it was as &quot;Hanna Glavari&quot; in Franz Lehár&#x27;s operetta &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; that she had her definitive break-through (1931). By then she had divorced Nils Leander. In the following years, she expanded upon her career and made a living as an artist on stage and in film in Scandinavia. Her fame brought her proposals from the European continent and from Hollywood, where a number of Swedish actors and directors were working.

In the beginning of the 1930s she performed with the Swedish revue artist, producer, and songwriter Karl Gerhard who was a prominent anti-Nazi. He wrote a song for Zarah Leander, &quot;I skuggan av en stövel&quot; (&quot;In the shadow of a boot&quot;), in 1934 which strongly condemned the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany.

Leander opted for an international career on the European continent. As a mother of two school-age children, she ruled out a move to America, fearing the consequences of taking the children such a great distance and being unable to find employment. Despite the political situation, Austria and Germany were much closer to home, and Leander was already well-versed in German.

A second breakthrough, by contemporary measures her international debut, was the world premiere (1936) of &quot;Axel an der Himmelstür&quot; (Axel at the Gate of Heaven) at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, directed by Max Hansen. It was a parody of Hollywood and not the least a parody of Marlene Dietrich. It was followed by the Austrian film &quot;Premiere&quot;, in which she played a successful cabaret star.

==UFA star==
In 1936, she was introduced to Studio Head Ernst Correll by Director Douglas Sirk and landed a contract with UFA in Berlin. She became renowned as a very tough negotiator, demanding both influence and a high salary, half of which was to be paid in Swedish kronor to a bank in Stockholm. Even though Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels dubbed her an &quot;Enemy of Germany&quot; for her aforementioned behavior, as a leading film star at UFA, she participated in ten films, most of them great successes. Leander neither socialized with leading party members nor took part in official Nazi Party functions. A likely apocryphal meeting with Goebbels supposedly resulted in this exchange: &quot;Zarah... Isn&#x27;t that a Jewish name?&quot; &quot;Oh, maybe&quot;, the actress said, &quot;but what about Josef?&quot; &quot;Hmmm... yes, yes, a good answer&quot;, Goebbels reportedly replied. Involvement with the Nazi propaganda machine did not prevent her from recording in 1938 the Yiddish song &quot;Bei Mir Bistu Shein&quot;.
Many of her songs were composed by Michael Jary, with whom she had an affair, and Bruno Balz with music and lyrics, respectively. In her films, Leander repeatedly played independent, beautiful, passionate and self-confident women. Leander scored the two biggest hits of her recording career—in her signature deep voice, she sang her anthems of hope and survival: &quot;Davon geht die Welt nicht unter&quot; (&quot;This is not the end of the world&quot;) and &quot;Ich weiss, es wird einmal ein Wunder geschehen&quot; (&quot;I know that someday a miracle will happen&quot;). These two songs in particular are often included in contemporary documentaries as obvious examples of effective Nazi propaganda. Although no exact record sales numbers exist, it is likely that she was among Europe&#x27;s best-selling recording artists in the years prior to 1945. She pointed out in later years that what made her a fortune was not her salary from UFA, but the royalties from the records she released.

==Return to Sweden==

Her last film in Nazi Germany premiered on 3 March 1943. Her villa in Grunewald was hit in an air raid, and the increasingly desperate Nazis pressured her to apply for German citizenship. At this point she decided to retreat to Sweden, where she had bought a mansion at , not far from Stockholm. She was still contractually obligated for another film to UFA, but held up the film representatives by rejecting script after script.

Gradually she managed to land engagements on the Swedish stage. After the war she did eventually return to tour Germany and Austria, giving concerts, making new records and acting in musicals. Her comeback found an eager audience among pre-war generations who had never forgotten her. She appeared in a number of films and television shows, but she would never regain the popularity she had enjoyed before and into the first years of World War II. In 1981, after having retired from show business, she died in Stockholm of complications from a stroke.

==Controversy==
Leander was often questioned about her years in Nazi Germany. Though she would willingly talk about her past, she strongly rejected allegations of her having had sympathy for the Nazi regime. She claimed that her position as a German film actress merely had been that of an entertainer working to please an enthusiastic audience in a difficult time.

On the other hand, in an interview recorded shortly before his death in 1996 the senior Soviet intelligence officer Pavel Sudoplatov claimed that Leander had in fact been a Soviet agent with the codename &quot;Stina-Rose&quot;. Recruited by the Soviet Union before the outbreak of war, she was said to have refused payment for her work because she was a secret member of the Swedish Communist Party and therefore conducted the work for political reasons. Leander herself denied any suggestion that she had acted as a spy for any country.

==Legacy==
Leander continued to be popular in Germany for many decades after World War II. She was interviewed several times on German television before her death. In 1983, New Wave singer Nina Hagen, who had idolized Leander as a child, released the single &quot;Zarah&quot;, based on „Ich weiss, es wird einmal ein Wunder geschehen”. In 1987, two Swedish musicals were written about Zarah Leander. In 2003, a bronze statue was placed in Zarah Leander&#x27;s home town Karlstad, by the Opera house of Värmland where she first began her career. After many years of discussions, the town government accepted this statue on behalf of the local Zarah Leander Society. A Zarah Leander museum is open near her mansion outside Norrköping. Every year a scholarship is given to a creative artist in her tradition. The performer received the prize in 2010, the female impersonator in 2009, and Zarah&#x27;s friend and creator of the museum Brigitte Pettersson in 2008.

<text>UFA GmbH, shortened to UFA (), is a film and television production company that unites all production activities of the media conglomerate Bertelsmann in Germany. The original UFA was established as on December 18, 1917, as a direct response to foreign competition in film and propaganda. UFA was founded by a consortium headed by Emil Georg von Stauß, a former Deutsche Bank board member. In March 1927, Alfred Hugenberg, an influential German media entrepreneur and later minister of the economy and minister of agriculture and nutrition in Adolf Hitler&#x27;s cabinet, purchased UFA and transferred ownership of it to the Nazi Party in 1933.

In 1942, as a result of the Nazi policy of &quot;forcible coordination&quot; known as the Gleichschaltung, UFA and all of its competitors, including Tobis, Terra, Bavaria Film and Wien-Film, were bundled together with Nazi-controlled foreign film production companies to form the super-corporation UFA-Film GmbH (Ufi), with headquarters in Berlin. After the Red Army occupied the UFA complex in 1945 in Babelsberg, and after the privatization of Bavaria and UFA in 1956 in West Germany, the company was restructured to form Universum Film AG and taken over by a consortium of banks. However, in film production and distribution, it failed to revive and went into receivership.

In 1964, Bertelsmann&#x27;s Chief Representative, Manfred Köhnlechner, acquired the entire Universum Film AG holdings from Deutsche Bank, which had previously been the main UFA shareholder and which had determined the company&#x27;s business policy as head of the shareholders&#x27; consortium. Köhnlechner bought UFA, which was heavily in debt, on behalf of Reinhard Mohn for roughly five million Deutschmarks. (Köhnlechner: &quot;The question came up as to why not take the entire thing, it still had many gems.&quot;) Only a few months later, Köhnlechner also acquired the UFA-Filmtheaterkette, a movie theater chain, for almost eleven million Deutschmarks.

In 1997, UFA and the Luxembourgish rival CLT established the joint venture CLT-UFA, which, following the takeover of British rival Pearson Television, was restructured as RTL Group in 2000. Now, UFA GmbH (UFA) works as a subsidiary of RTL Group&#x27;s production division Fremantle, which had been formed out of Pearson TV, and is responsible for all production activities of Bertelsmann and Fremantle in Germany. Until August 2013, eight subsidiaries operated under the UFA umbrella: UFA Fernsehproduktion, UFA Entertainment, Grundy UFA, Grundy Light Entertainment, UFA Cinema, , Phoenix Film and UFA Brand Communication.

In August 2013, UFA underwent an organizational restructuring that simplified the company down to three production divisions. Today, &quot;UFA Fiction&quot;, &quot;UFA Serial Drama&quot;, &quot;UFA Show &amp; Factual&quot; and &quot;UFA Documentary&quot; are the four units responsible for production.

== History==

===Establishment from 1917===
An early step towards the founding of UFA was taken on January 13, 1917, with the creation of the Bild- und Filmamt (Bufa) by Germany&#x27;s Supreme Army Command. Formed as a reaction to the perceived advantage of Germany&#x27;s enemies in the realm of film propaganda, Bufa&#x27;s task was to use film for psychological warfare.

The plans envisaged by the German General Staff – especially those of Erich Ludendorff – went far beyond the creation of Bufa. Ludendorff foresaw a large-scale, state-controlled film corporation that would serve national interests. In this spirit, Universum-Film AG (UFA) was founded as a consolidation of private film companies on December 18, 1917 in Berlin. The company&#x27;s starting capital was 25 million Reichsmark (equivalent to million €): among the contributors were the German government, the War Ministry and Deutsche Bank. The board chairman of the new company was Deutsche Bank director Emil Georg von Stauß.

Prior to establishing the company, the General Staff had considered taking over the e. V. (DLG), which had been founded in 1916. This agency was too much under the influence of heavy industry and, in particular, of Alfred Hugenberg, chairman of Krupp. Hugenberg would later take over UFA in 1927.

Three main film companies formed the nucleus of UFA from the end of 1917:
* Messter Film, owned by Oskar Messter, a dominant German producer
* PAGU (Projektions Union), originally formed by Paul Davidson in Frankfurt, with the Templehof Studios in Oberlandstraße in Berlin-Tempelhof and in Weissensee; and the Union-Theater (U.T. or U.T- Lichtspiele) chain of some 50 cinemas 
* The entire German operation of Nordisk Film (founded in 1906 by Ole Olsen) including Nordische Films, the production company Oliver-Film of , cinemas, and a distribution company, was bought by UFA in 1918
More companies joined UFA not long after:
* Joe May&#x27;s May-Film company, with film duplicating plant and glass-house studios at Weissensee Studios (next door to PAGU). The studios were previously owned by Continental-Kunstfilm, whose production had slowed since 1915 and didn&#x27;t join UFA.
* Greenbaum-Film (previously Vitascope before its brief merger with PAGU in January 1914) joined in 1919, but the deal was disastrous for Jules Greenbaum who died in a mental institution in 1924.
* Decla-Bioscop. Originally founded by Jules Greenbaum in 1902 as Deutsche Bioskop AG, sold to Carl Moritz Schleussner in 1908 and moved to Neubabelsberg); merged in March 1920 with Erich Pommer&#x27;s Decla-Film which had been formed in 1915 out of the confiscated assets of the German branch of the French Éclair (Deutsche Éclair, thus Decla) to form Decla-Bioskop: Taken over by UFA in October 1921.

UFA continued to sign production agreements with various independent producers:
* Deulig from October 1920, previously (DLG)
* Cserépy Film, founded by Arzén von Cserépy, merged with UFA in 1922
* Gloria-Film AG, founded by Hanns Lippmann 
* Heinrich Bolten-Baeckers&#x27; BB-Film
* Rex-Film, founded in 1917 by Lupu Pick
* Fern-Andra Vertriebsgesellschaft, the film production company of Fern Andra
* Ossi-Oswalda-Film contracted to UFA from 1925
* The distributor Hansa-Film

===Silent era (1918–1930)===

Given that Germany had been – and continued to be – largely cut off from film imports due to World War I, the new company had ideal conditions for their conquest of the German market.

The mission of UFA at the time of its founding was the production of films – feature films, documentaries, cultural films and weekly headline (newsreel) films – designed to function as propaganda for Germany abroad. However, after mounting tensions between the company&#x27;s founding members, Deutsche Bank was able to prevail and implement their approach to film production as a business rather than for military objectives. Instead of propaganda films, UFA now produced elaborate entertainment films such as &quot;Sumurun&quot; (Ernst Lubitsch, 1920).

UFA was already in 1921 producing the lion&#x27;s share of German feature films, and in that year it was privatized. Starting in 1922, large ateliers in Neubabelsberg (today&#x27;s Babelsberg Studio) and on Oberlandstraße in Berlin-Tempelhof were made available for film production. In 1926, the facilities were expanded by means of the construction of the largest studio hall in Europe at the time. In 1923, after Decla-Bioscop AG and others were taken over, Erich Pommer became head of all production operations and discovered and fostered many stars, including Emil Jannings, Pola Negri, Conrad Veidt and Lya de Putti. During this era UFA was a leader in the time of the &quot;German Expressionism&quot;, experienced a further boom, and emerged as a direct competitor to Hollywood with films such as &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920), &quot;Dr. Mabuse the Gambler&quot; (1922), &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot; (1924), &quot;Variety&quot; (1925) and &quot;Faust&quot; (1926).

===Hugenberg (1927–1933)===

In 1927, UFA found itself in serious financial trouble. After the stabilization of the German currency starting in November 1924, the German film industry in general entered a period of crisis: foreign sales stalled due to low profit margins, and the German market became profitable once again for American film giants. The resulting concentration on a few large German film companies, which came together to unite production, distribution and presentation under one UFA&#x27;s managers made severe miscalculations with regard to two large-scale productions, &quot;Nibelungen&quot; and &quot;Metropolis&quot; in 1924-1926. This situation was made even worse as the result of a gag contract (the Parufamet agreement) they had entered into in 1925 with the American companies Paramount Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In March 1927, with the company facing bankruptcy, Alfred Hugenberg – Chairman of the German National People&#x27;s Party and owner of the Scherl-Gruppe, a powerful media corporation – bought the company. The new general director was Ludwig Klitzsch; Hugenberg himself took over the chairmanship of the supervisory board; his deputy was banker Emil Georg von Stauß.

At first, nothing changed in UFA&#x27;s production policy. In 1928, Erich Pommer was replaced as head of production by Ernst Hugo Correll, who led the company through the transition to talking pictures or &quot;talkies&quot;. UFA gained an advantage over smaller companies in the realm of talkie production as a result of a contract with Tobis-Klangfilm, which simplified the licensing situation for UFA.

Nevertheless, UFA has recorded unsurpassed artistic successes with films such as Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; (inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register, the first film thus distinguished) and &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot; to this day. &quot;Asphalt&quot; (&quot;German Realism&quot;) or entertainment movies such as &quot;Melody of the Heart&quot; or the musical film &quot;The Three from the Filling Station&quot; are produced by the UFA. In 1930, the company enjoyed worldwide success with the film &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;, starring Marlene Dietrich and Emil Jannings, directed by Joseph von Sternberg.

===Nazification (1933–1937)===

UFA experienced a new commercial boom in the Nazi era, not least due to the government&#x27;s protectionist measures, which freed the company from bothersome domestic and foreign competition, sometimes even incorporating their production facilities and staff (see also: National Socialist Film Policy). On top of that, by occupying almost all of Europe, the Nazi regime also provided UFA with new sales markets, as well as placing distribution outlets in such &quot;neutral&quot; countries as the United States. By 1938, after taking over foreign film production facilities in France, Belgium and other countries, one third of the company&#x27;s sales came from abroad. UFA&#x27;s economic boom made it possible to further expand the so-called &quot;star system,&quot; which had already been developed in the silent film era. The highest paid UFA stars in the Nazi era were Hans Albers and Zarah Leander. Veit Harlan was the highest-earning director.

In addition, as a result of the nationalist German spirit that already dominated the company, UFA was perfectly suited to serve the goals of National Socialist propaganda in film. Hugenberg had been named Reich Minister of Economics immediately following the Nazi takeover of January 30, 1933, and made UFA openly available for Joseph Goebbels&#x27; propaganda machine, even though Hugenberg was removed from his post shortly thereafter (June 1933) under pressure from Hitler. In an act of anticipatory obedience to the Nazi regime, UFA management fired several Jewish employees on March 29, 1933. In the summer of 1933, the Nazi regime created the Film Chamber of the Reich, which adopted regulations officially excluding Jewish filmmakers from all German studios.

===Nationalization (1937–1941)===

In 1936, Germany&#x27;s first film institute was founded in the form of the UFA-Lehrschau set up by Hans Traub at the Babelsberg Film Complex. Goebbels systematically brought UFA and all other media companies under the control of his Propaganda Ministry. On March 18, 1937, the Hugenberg Company was forced to sell all of its UFA shares for 21.25 million Reichsmark (equivalent to million €) to Cautio Treuhand GmbH, a quasi-governmental holding company that answered to Goebbels. This move meant that UFA was effectively nationalized. Emil Georg von Stauß was named Chairman of the Supervisory Committee, Ludwig Klitzsch remained general director, and Carl Opitz was named press officer. In May, an art committee headed by Carl Froelich – but in fact controlled by Goebbels – was founded. This committee proceeded to have a direct influence on UFA&#x27;s production planning; it also severely curtailed the work of production head Ernst Hugo Correll. In 1939, Correll was fired after refusing to join the Nazi Party.

At the time of its nationalization, among the production facilities belonging to UFA were 27 film studios, nine of which were in Neubabelsberg (Potsdam-Babelsberg), and seven of which were in Berlin-Tempelhof, including three that belonged to Carl Froelich-Film GmbH in name only. UFA also had two dubbing studios, a mixing studio, two animation studios, two ateliers for advertising films, one for cartoons and a small training atelier.

===State film monopoly: UFI (1942–1945)===

On January 10, 1942, UFA officially became the subsidiary of UFA-Film GmbH (UFI), into which all German film production was merged. Other companies were dissolved or integrated into UFA at the time, including Bavaria Film, Berlin-Film, Terra Film and Tobis AG, which became additional production units. Film production in the captured nations was also brought under its aegis. Profits reached 155 million Reichsmarks in 1942 () and 175 million ℛℳ in 1943 ().

At this point, the UFA staff hierarchy was reorganized according to the Nazi Führer principle. The coordination of individual sub-groups of the UFI Corporation was the job of the newly appointed Reich Film Director-General. The production heads worked for the administrative director general and were responsible for the overall planning of annual programming and content design all the way up to the actual shooting of the film: these heads were also responsible for giving instructions to the film line producers and directors. It was subsequently fully nationalized in mid-1944.

===Post-war period: Dissolution and Sovietization vs. re-privatization===
In late April 1945, the UFA ateliers in Potsdam-Babelsberg and Berlin-Tempelhof were occupied by the Red Army. After the German Wehrmacht issued its unconditional surrender on May 7 &amp; 9, 1945, the Military Government Law No. 191 initially halted and prohibited all further film production. On July 14, 1945, as a result of Military Government Law No. 52, all Reich-owned film assets of UFI Holding were seized. All activities in the film industry were placed under strict licensing regulations and all films were subject to censorship.

The Soviet military government, which was in favour of a speedy reconstruction of the German film industry under Soviet supervision, incorporated the Babelsberg ateliers into DEFA, the state-run film studio, subsequently the GDR&#x27;s state film studio, on May 17, 1946. &quot;Murderers Among Us&quot; was the first German feature film in the post-war era and the first so-called &quot;Trümmerfilm&quot; (&quot;Rubble Film&quot;). It was shot in 1945/46 by DEFA in the Althoff Studios in Babelsberg and the Jofa ateliers in Berlin-Johannisthal. Wolfgang Staudte directed the film and also wrote the screenplay. Additionally, the Soviets confiscated numerous UFA productions from the Babelsburg vaults and dubbed them into Russian for release in the USSR; and simultaneously began importing Soviet films to the same offices for dubbing into German and distribution to the surviving German theaters.

In contrast, the main film-policy goal of the Allied occupying forces, under American insistence, consisted in preventing any future accumulation of power in the German film industry. The Western powers also had more interest in opening up the German film market for their own products rather than in letting the national film industry regain its foothold. Thus the reorganization of Germany&#x27;s film industry outside the Soviet zone was very slow, in spite of the &quot;Lex UFI&quot; law issued in September 1949 by the American and British military regime and the Dissolution Law (June 1953) issued by the German Bundestag. The status of UFA was furthermore controversial, with doubts about whether it should be allowed to resume operations at all because of its identification with Nazi film production. Motion pictures produced after the war in the Allied zones were, for a decade, made by other, fledgling companies.

It was 1956 by the time Bavaria was outsourced and the remaining UFA re-privatized. A bank consortium led by Deutsche Bank was behind the founding of the new Universum-Film AG, whose production facilities included the Afifa-Kopierwerk and the ateliers in Berlin-Tempelhof. Its first board chairman was Arno Hauke who, until then, had been the General Trustee for UFI assets in the British zone. The first film made by Universum-Film AG, a short documentary film called &quot;Am Seidenen Faden&quot;, came out in 1955. In 1958, the first UFA feature film &quot;Stefanie&quot; came out: it starred Sabine Sinjen and was directed by Josef von Baky, who had directed the UFA&#x27;s large-scale 25th anniversary film &quot;Münchhausen&quot; in 1942. In 1969, after ten further feature films directed by leading artists such as Curtis Bernhardt, William Dieterle, Helmut Käutner and Wolfgang Liebeneiner – as well as such newcomers as Peter Beauvais, Rolf von Sydow and Georg Tressler – feature film production at UFA was ended.

===Bertelsmann (starting in 1964)===
In 1964, Bertelsmann acquired Universum-Film AG and all other divisions of UFA-Theater AG. In order to prevent the sale of film rights belonging to the old UFA, the Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation was set up in Wiesbaden on the initiative of the German Federal Government and representatives of the film industry. In 1966, the foundation acquired the rights to UFA and Bavaria Film – and they have been administering, storing and restoring ever since. In 1972, the Riech Group acquired UFA-Theater AG and continued operating the company with a license from Bertelsmann under the UFA&#x27;s trademark rhombus logo. The right to the UFA name remains, however, with Bertelsmann. Under the management of Werner Mietzner, the company experienced a renaissance in productions at UFA Fernsehproduktion. With the launch of private television in 1984, the Bertelsmann Group brought together its film and TV activities in a new holding – the UFA Film und Fernseh GmbH in Hamburg – which also held investments in radio and TV stations such as RTL and Premiere. They also established and marketed new film and sports rights.

The production companies belonging to UFA Berlin have been under the management of Wolf Bauer, Norbert Sauer and Axel Reick since autumn 1991. Using the rhombus logo again, this team developed UFA Film &amp; TV Produktion into the largest production company in Germany, now written in capital letters &quot;UFA&quot;. UFA&#x27;s many prize-winning TV films, light entertainment formats, popular soap operas, long-running TV series, sitcoms and non-fiction programs have made it the leader on the German television market. The company broadcasts over 2,800 hours of content each year. In early 1997, the holding society UFA Hamburg (today Cologne) merged with CLT in Luxemburg to form CLT-UFA. April 2000 saw a merger with Pearson TV and the creation of the RTL Group, in which Bertelsmann has held the majority (90.4%) since late 2001. All worldwide production activities of the RTL Group are consolidated in FremantleMedia, and UFA is the holding company of all FremantleMedia&#x27;s production activities in Germany. UFAInteractive, a small subsidiary directly associated with the holding company, was created to fulfill UFA&#x27;s need for constant innovation (e.g. program content for mobile devices and special-interest channels) as well as to assist the larger companies independently in an advisory function.

On August 9, 2013, the company underwent a major restructuring based on the new strategic goal and concept of &quot;One UFA&quot;. UFA&#x27;s organizational structure was simplified down to three production units.
