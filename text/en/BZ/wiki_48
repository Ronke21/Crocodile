<text>An enlarger is a specialized transparency projector used to produce photographic prints from film or glass negatives, or from transparencies.

==Construction==
All enlargers consist of a light source, normally an incandescent light bulb shining though a condenser or translucent screen to provide even illumination, a holder for the negative or transparency, and a specialized lens for projection, though some, such as the Rapid Rectilinear or Aplanat could be used in both camera and enlarger. Enlarger lenses, like the dialyte construction, are generally symmetrical in design or nearly so, optimised for sharp focus at 2x to 10x magnification. The light passes through a film holder, which holds the exposed and developed photographic negative or transparency.

Prints made with an enlarger are called &quot;enlargements&quot;. Typically, enlargers are used in a darkroom, an enclosed space from which extraneous light may be excluded; some commercial enlargers have an integral dark box so that they can be used in a light-filled room.

== History ==

Josef Maria Eder, in his &quot;History of Photography&quot; attributes the invention of photographic enlargement to Humphry Davy who realised the idea of using a solar microscope to project images onto sensitised paper. In June 1802, Davy published in the first issue of the &quot;Journals of the Royal Institution of Great Britain&quot; his &quot;An Account of a Method of Copying Paintings upon Glass, and of Making Profiles, by the Agency of Light upon Nitrate of Silver. Invented by T. Wedgwood, Esq. With Observations by H. Davy&quot; in which he described their experiments with the photosensitivity of silver nitrate. Eder credits the first mention of enlargements after the announcement of the daguerreotype (unique images on metal plates) to John William Draper who in 1840, wrote prophetically in the &quot;American Repository of Arts&quot;; &quot;Exposures are made with a very small camera on very small plates. These are subsequently enlarged to the required size in a larger camera on a rigid stand. This method will probably contribute very much to the practice of the art.&quot; In March 1843 Americans Wolcott and Johnson patented a means of copying and enlarging daguerreotypes. 

In June 1843, Henry Fox Talbot in his patent for an enlarger for his calotype process which produced a paper negative, mentions that using lenses it is possible to produce a large negative from a smaller one, so having made such enlargements has a priority claim to be the inventor of a system for making an enlarged print from a negative, though it did not go into production and was not practical given the lengthy exposures required. In 1848, Talbot recommended to fellow photographer Thomas Malon the enlarging camera made by Thomas Ross of lens manufacturers Ross, Andrew &amp; Thomas.

The advent of collodion negatives on glass in the 1850s made enlargement more practical. Achille Quinet&#x27;s invention of 1852 used artificial light, but was inefficient, requiring very extended exposures. David Acheson Woodward&#x27;s 1857 &#x27;solar enlarging camera&#x27; addressed that problem by tapping the brightest light-source then available – the Sun – with mirrors and a condenser.
=== Solar camera ===
Solar cameras, introduced in the late 1850s, and ancestors of the darkroom enlarger, were necessary because of the low light sensitivity of albumen and calotype materials used. A larger version of the 18th century solar microscope, they were first freestanding, a design analogous to picture-taking cameras but with the relative position of negative and lens reversed so that sunlight shone through the glass plate to be projected onto photo-sensitive paper inside the instrument. Mounted on a stand, they could be rotated to continuously face the sun. 

Woodward&#x27;s 1857 solar enlarging camera was a large instrument operated out-of-doors that could produce life size prints from quarter plate and half plate negatives with an exposure of about forty-five minutes, improved in the 1860s and 1870s with a clockwork heliostat to rotate the mirror in synchronisation with the sun&#x27;s passage to concentrate its light on the condenser lens, while Désiré van Monckhoven&#x27;s 1863 patent was for a modification of Woodward&#x27;s design that had an appearance more like a modern horizontal enlarger. 

The instrument was used by significant photographers Disderi and Nadar. By 1890, artificial light sources – gas, petroleum, limelight, magnesium, and electric light bulb – were commonly used in enlargers, but even at the turn of the century simple folding daylight enlargers still found a use among amateurs to easily produce prints of a fixed size. Some cameras were made convertible to use in a similar manner.

=== Commercial enlarging ===
In the 1870s hand-coloured enlargements from carte-de-visite prints and daguerreotypes as well as existing negatives were offered for sale in London, England for two shillings for an A4 print, and three pounds for a life size bust. R. L. Elliot &amp; Company, of King&#x27;s Road could print up to 25&quot; x 20&quot; from quarter plate negatives in 1878 using limelight, as suggested by John Benjamin Dancer. 

Fast bromide and chloride printing papers largely superseded albumen emulsions in the 1880s.

==Types of enlarger==

A condenser enlarger consists of a light source, a condensing lens, a holder for the negative and a projecting lens. The condenser provides even illumination to the negative beneath it. Condenser enlargers produce higher contrast than diffusion enlargers because light is scattered from its path by the negative&#x27;s image silver; this is called the Callier effect. The condenser&#x27;s increased contrast emphasises any negative defects, such as dirt and scratches, and image grain.

A point source enlarger is a variation of the condenser enlarger designed to cut light diffusion above the negative. Contrast is enhanced and grain in the resultant print is sharper than with a conventional enlarger, and the transition from light to dark at the edge of the shadow areas is dramatic.

An unfrosted clear lamp with a tiny filament is used without diffusers. As the illuminant is narrow, the lamp must be precisely positioned both vertically and horizontally, because the condensers project only that single small filament rather than light that fills the whole housing. However the lens must be kept at full aperture to avoid projecting an image of the light source restricted to the centre of the baseboard, which will cause vignetting and falloff in the print. Exposure is controlled through duration or using a variable transformer.

A diffusion enlarger&#x27;s light source is diffused by translucent glass or plastic, providing even illumination for the film. Diffusion enlargers produce an image of the same contrast as a contact print from the negative.

Cold light or cold cathode enlargers employ diffusion enlarger heads with a coiled Fluorescent lamp tube rather than a conventional light bulb. Their light is blue-rich, in an area of the spectrum to which silver gelatin paper is sensitive, and therefore exposure is shorter compared to other light sources, ideal for making large mural prints which require extended exposure, and heat is reduced which is beneficial in avoiding buckling or &#x27;popping&#x27; of negatives, and also are Newton&#x27;s rings&#x27; where a glass negative carrier is used. They produce a softer (less contrast) print. Color enlargers typically contain an adjustable filter mechanism – the color head – between the light source and the negative, enabling the user to adjust the amount of cyan, magenta and yellow light reaching the negative to control color balance. Other models have a drawer where cut filters can be inserted into the light path, synthesize colour by additive mixing of light from colored lamps with adjustable intensity or duty cycle, or expose the receiving medium sequentially using red, green and blue light. Such enlargers can also be used with variable-contrast monochrome papers.

Digital enlargers project an image from an LCD screen at the film plane, to produce a photographic enlargement from a digital file.

==Enlarger physical arrangements==
Most modern enlargers are vertically mounted with the lens pointing downward. Moving the head on the column up or down changes the size of the image projected onto the enlarger&#x27;s base, or a work table if the unit is mounted to the wall.

A horizontal enlarger consists of a trestle, with the head mounted on crossbars between two or more posts for extra stability. A horizontal enlarger structure is used when high quality, large format enlargements are required such as when photographs are taken from aircraft for mapping and taxation purposes.

The parts of the enlarger include baseboard, enlarger head, elevation knob, filter holder, negative carrier, glass plate, focus knob, girder scale, timer, bellows, and housing lift.

==Principles of operation==

The image from the negative or transparency is projected through a lens, typically fitted with an adjustable aperture marked with f/ stops, onto a flat surface bearing the sensitized photographic paper. By adjusting the ratio of distance from film to lens to the distance from lens to paper, various degrees of enlargement may be obtained, with the physical enlargement ratio limited only by the structure of the enlarger and the size of the paper. As the image size is changed it is also necessary to change the focus of the lens. Some enlargers, such as Leica&#x27;s &quot;Autofocus&quot; enlargers, perform this automatically.

An easel is used to hold the paper perfectly flat. Some easels are designed with adjustable overlapping flat steel &quot;blades&quot; to crop the image on the paper to the desired size while keeping an unexposed white border about the image. Paper is sometimes placed directly on the table or enlarger base, and held down flat with metal strips.

The enlargement is made by first focusing the image with the lamp on, the lens at maximum aperture and the easel empty, usually with the aid of a focus finder. The lamp is turned off, or in some cases, shuttered by a light-tight mechanism.

The image is focused by changing the distance between the lens and the film, achieved by adjusting the length of a light-tight bellows with a geared rack and pinion mechanism.
The lens is set to its working aperture. Enlarging lenses have an optimum range of apertures which yield a sharp image from corner to corner, which is 3 f/ stops smaller than the maximum aperture of the lens. For an enlarging lens with a maximum aperture of f/2.8, the optimal aperture would be f/8. The lens is normally set to this aperture and any color filtration dialed in, if making a color print or one on variable-contrast black-and-white paper.

A series of test strips, and/or a stepped series of exposures made on the one sheet of paper, are undertaken to determine ideal exposure, and then contrast or colour filtration. Alternatively a custom incident light meter (densitometer or &#x27;colour-&#x27; or &#x27;darkroom analyser&#x27;) may be used in setting exposure once the degree of enlargement has been decided, and in colour printing may also be used to establish a base neutral filtration from the negative rebate. 
The enlarger&#x27;s lamp or shutter mechanism is controlled either by an electronic timer, or by the operator – who marks time with a clock, metronome or simply by counting seconds – shuttering or turning off the lamp when the exposure is complete. The exposed paper can be processed immediately or placed in a light-tight container for later processing.

Digitally controlled commercial enlargers typically adjust exposure in steps known as printer points; twelve printer points makes a factor of two change in exposure.

If a greater or lesser enlargement from the same negative is then required, a calculator – analogue, digital or in app format – may be used to quickly extrapolate from the original settings the exposure without the need for labour-intensive re-testing.

==Paper processing==

After exposure, photographic paper is developed, fixed, washed and dried using the gelatin silver or C-print process.

==Automated print machines==
Automated photo print machines have the same basic elements and integrate each of the steps outlined above in a single complex machine under operator and computer control.

Rather than project directly from the film negative to the print paper, a digital image may first be captured from the negative. This allows the operator or computer to quickly determine adjustments to brightness, contrast, clipping, and other characteristics. The image is then rendered by passing light through the negative and a built-in computer-controlled enlarger optically projects this image to the paper for final exposure.

As a byproduct of the process a compact disc recording may be made of the digital images, although a subsequent print made from these may be inferior to an image made from the negative due to digitization noise and lack of dynamic range which are characteristics of the digitizing process.

For better images, the negatives may be reprinted using the same automated machine under operator selection of the print to be made.

==Advantages==

* The image may be printed to a size different from the negative or transparency. Without an enlarger, only a contact print would be possible, and large images would require large size negatives and hence very large cameras.
* Local contrast and density of various parts of the print can be easily controlled. Changing the amount of light exposing the paper in various areas will change the image density in those areas. A mask with a hole can be used to add extra light to an area &quot;burning&quot;, which will have the effect of darkening the regions with additional exposure, while the use of a small wand to reduce the total exposure to a region is called &quot;dodging&quot; and has the effect of lightening the regions with reduced exposure. The tool is kept moving to avoid producing a sharp edge at the region boundary. Using these techniques it is possible to make significant changes to the mood or emphasis of a photographic print. Similar methods are available with contact printing, but it is more difficult to see the image as it is being manipulated.
* The easel can be tilted to correct or change perspective. For example, a photograph of a building, when taken pointing the camera up, may make the building appear to lay back and not appear vertical. This can be corrected by tilting the easel and possibly using a higher f/ stop number to adjust provide greater depth-of-field to keep the entire easel within focus.
*It is also possible to make composite photographs, such as those by Jerry Uelsmann, by overlaying the print with a hand-cut mask, performing an exposure, and then using the inverse of that mask to perform another exposure with a different negative. This is much more difficult to do well using photographic methods than it is now by using the methods of modern digital image manipulation.

==Image enlargement limits==

The practical amount of enlargement (irrespective of the enlarger structure) will depend upon the grain size of the negative, the sharpness (accuracy) of both the camera and projector lenses, blur in the image due to subject motion, focus, and camera shake during the exposure.

The intended viewing distance for the final product is a consideration. For example, an enlargement from a certain negative as a 12 x 18 cm (approx. 5 by 7 inch) print may be sufficient for a scrapbook viewed at 50 cm (20 inches), but insufficiently detailed for an A4 print hung on a hallway wall to be viewed at the same distance, though usable at a larger 120 x 180 cm (ten times larger) on a billboard to be viewed no closer than 5 metres.

Since the inverse square law applies to illumination intensity at increasing distance, enlargement beyond a certain size becomes impractical, requiring extended exposure times and dependent on the extent to which dampening of enlarger supports may eliminate vibration causing blur in the resulting print.

=== Biggest enlargement ===
The claim for the biggest analogue enlargement ever made from a 35mm photograph is that for and Ernst Haas wildlife picture taken in Kenya in 1970. It required a 5-hour exposure using the Kodak Colorama process, for a giant transparency. The 508-times enlargement consisted of 20 vertical panels of 3 feet width and 18 feet height (91.4 x 548.6 cm) for a total size of 18 x 60 feet (5.48 m x 18.28 m). Displayed at Grand Central Station in New York city in 1977, it was Illuminated from behind with 61,000 watts of incandescent light; it was the first time a 35 mm picture had been used for an ongoing series of Kodak advertising displays there c.1950–1990. The transparency print was destroyed after exhibition.

==Manufacturers==

<text>The Nauvoo Legion was a state-authorized militia of Nauvoo, Illinois, United States from February 4, 1841 until January 29, 1845. Its main function was the defense of Nauvoo and surrounding Latter Day Saint settlements, but it was also occasionally used as local law enforcement and paraded at ceremonies such as the laying of the cornerstone for the Nauvoo Temple. The Nauvoo Legion was unique among contemporary militias for its chain of command structure, its expanded functions of the court martial, and for operating at a city level. 

The Legion&#x27;s presence was a significant factor in tensions between Nauvoo and its neighbors. The militia received criticism for its loyalty to Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement and mayor of Nauvoo. In 1843, Legion members controversially helped Smith avoid extradition into Missouri. In 1844, Joseph Smith ordered the Nauvoo Legion to destroy the &quot;Nauvoo Expositor&quot; newspaper. Smith was charged with inciting a riot and placed in Carthage Jail where he was killed by a mob. 

In 1845 the Legion lost its official sanction as an arm of the Illinois militia, though activities continued under command of Brigham Young until the expulsion of the Latter-day Saints from the state. The final conflict in Illinois involving remaining Legion members occurred in September 1846.

==Formation in Nauvoo==
In 1839, Joseph Smith relocated his followers from a hostile environment in Missouri to Commerce, Illinois, which he renamed Nauvoo. Aiming to win the Mormon voting bloc, Illinois Democrats and Whigs (including Abraham Lincoln) passed a bipartisan city-state charter for Nauvoo in 1840. On December 16, 1840 Governor Thomas Carlin approved the charter, which was certified by then Secretary of State Stephen A. Douglas. In February 1841 the law went into effect, granting Smith and the city of Nauvoo broad powers including the authority to create a militia. This military force was a militia similar to the Illinois State Militia, and it became known as the &quot;Nauvoo Legion&quot;. The Legion was organized into two brigades (called cohorts) of artillery/infantry and one of cavalry. A few light cannons were also attached. The names &quot;cohort&quot; and &quot;legion&quot; were uncommon designators for militia, and were chosen to emulate ancient Roman units of the same name.

By April 1841, over 600 men had enrolled in the Legion. By the end of 1841 that number had grown to around 1,500. At its peak, the militia had, by conservative estimates, at least 2,500 troops, in comparison to the approximately 8,500 troops within the entire United States Army as of 1845. On March 12, 1842 the growing city of Nauvoo was divided into four military districts (aligning with the four city wards), with four corresponding companies that would comprise the fourth regiment of the second brigade. On June 13, 1842, Charles C. Rich organized a fifth regiment of the second cohort.

The Legion was unique among American militia organizations for its disproportionate number of high-ranking officers to regular soldiers. At one point there were 13 major-generals and an even higher number of brigadier-generals. Other ranks commissioned for the Nauvoo Legion included Judge Advocate, Assistant Chaplain, and Herald and Armour-Bearer. Although the United States army and other contemporary militias held no office higher than a major-general, Joseph Smith held the rank of lieutenant-general, an honor that had not been bestowed on any American since George Washington. Historian Harold Schindler argues that the rank of Lieutenant General was granted to Smith by the State of Illinois in exchange for the Latter Day Saint vote in upcoming elections. Brigham Young remarked, &quot;If the war [with Mexico] broke out, he would have become commander-in-chief of the United States armies.&quot;

==Organizational chain of command==

Nauvoo forming a city militia was uncommon, as typical militias of the time were formed within the county or state. The Nauvoo Legion was a regular unit of the Illinois state militia. The state, rather than the county militia, provided arms to the legion, and service in the legion exempted members from mandatory service in the state or county militia. Officers in the legion were elected by the legion itself, but officers received their commission from the governor of the state.

The state governor or the President of the United States had the power to call on the Nauvoo Legion for public defense of the state and country. Uncommon for the time, the power to call upon the Legion extended to the mayor of Nauvoo for municipal defense, creating a measure of independence from the county militia and state government. Joseph Smith himself was Nauvoo&#x27;s second mayor, and the Nauvoo court martial also appointed him as highest-ranking officer of the Legion, a Lieutenant General. Gardner et al. argue that Joseph Smith&#x27;s use of this power was one of the direct causes for the later suppression of the Legion.

===Role of the court martial===
The Nauvoo Legion court martial differed in several ways from contemporary militias. Typical American courts-martial are exclusively judicial entities, created to try military personnel in accordance with military law. The state legislature granted the Nauvoo Legion additional legislative and executive powers: 1) the Nauvoo Legion court martial was granted the power to make, ordain, establish, and execute laws and ordinances and 2) The Nauvoo Legion was placed at the disposal of the city mayor to enforce city laws.

On February 8, 1841, in accordance with the city charter, the Nauvoo City Council further expanded the executive power of the court martial to internally nominate officers for original commissions and promotions at a municipal level. This was also a departure from typical procedure in contemporary state militias. Officers were chosen by popular election, and then commissioned at the state level. At the same time, it granted the court martial the legislative duty to mirror the United States army “so far as applicable” in terms of discipline, drill, uniform, rules, and regulations.

==Activities in Nauvoo==

===Laying of the cornerstone of the Nauvoo Temple===
On April 6, 1841 the Nauvoo Legion paraded in a full military display as part of the temple&#x27;s cornerstone ceremony. Nauvoo&#x27;s fourteen companies and two volunteer Mormon cohorts marched from assigned points to the temple grounds, led by Brigadier Generals William Law and Don Carlos Smith. Their entrances were marked by artillery fire. At 9:30 am, Lieutenant General Joseph Smith reviewed the Legion, surrounded by guard, staff, and field officers. His entrance was marked by distant cannon fire. He appeared on horseback in full military suita black cap with a red plume, a black coat, a red sash, and white pants, edged down the sides with red stripes. Emma Smith rode sidesaddle next to him, followed by a number of women on horseback; during the ceremonies Emma presented Joseph with a silk American flag. They were joined on stage by Major General John C. Bennett.

The ceremonies included religious services, public singing, dedicatory prayers, speeches by Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith, after which temple architects lowered the southeast corner stone into place. A hollow space in the cornerstone was filled with items such as a Bible, a Book of Mormon, a hymn book and silver money that had been coined that year. The ceremonies concluded with music from the military band and choir.

Local newspaper owner Thomas C. Sharp attended the ceremonies as a visiting dignitary. This event, combined with John C. Bennett&#x27;s appointment by Stephen Douglas to Master in Chancery in Hancock County, led Sharp to become a leading opponent of Joseph Smith. Sharp reflected a growing sentiment in Illinois that the combined military and religious Latter Day Saint community posed a threat to the democratic values of individual freedom and separation of church and state, writing, &quot;Every thing they say or do seems to breathe the spirit of military tactics. Their prophet appears, on all great occasions in his splendid regimental dress... Truly fighting must, be a part of the creed of these Saints!&quot;

===Junior Legion and Benjaminites===
Up to 600 boys from Nauvoo decided to form a military unit in imitation of their fathers, and would parade and drill whenever their fathers did so. Their mothers made uniforms for them; white pants, colorful blouse and a palm hat. Joseph Smith III as a boy carried a wooden sword and a banner that read, &quot;Our fathers we respect; our mothers we&#x27;ll protect.&quot; Other boys also had wooden guns. At one point, they decided to conduct a raid on Nauvoo, mustering outside of town and then rushing into the city. They used pots and pans to make noise as they marched in, causing the horses to panic. According to Joseph Smith III, Joseph Smith rode forward on his horse and the boys scattered.

Additionally, older men in Nauvoo organized into a group they called the &quot;Benjaminite Company&quot;, at one point asking the privilege of assembling with the Legion, writing to the court martial, &quot;we still feel the spirit of seventy-six burning in our bosom, and are willing to grasp the sling and hurl the stone like David of Old.&quot;
===Usage as local law enforcement===
Prior to 1843 Nauvoo did not have a police force, and the Nauvoo Legion was used as local law enforcement. According to John Lee Allaman, &quot;Prophet Joseph Smith and the Nauvoo City Council often used the legion as a primary agent for law and order.&quot;

On October 30, 1841, the city council ordered two companies of the Nauvoo Legion to destroy a local grog shop that was declared a public nuisance.

On December 15, 1841, the Nauvoo &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; reported the city watch was disbanded and reorganized as a Legion assignment.

From May to October 1842, Joseph Smith in his role as mayor established a night watch consisting of 8–16 members of the Nauvoo Legion. They maintained a shift from 6 pm–6 am and reported directly to the mayor.

On August 14 1842, Smith ordered Major General Wilson Law to &quot;preserve the peace of the city of Nauvoo&quot; in any emergency situation.

Governor Ford forbade the Legion from acting as a police force on December 12, 1843, leading to an expansion of the official police force, and limiting further police activities by the Nauvoo Legion.

===Removal of John C. Bennett as Major General===

The Nauvoo Legion would sometimes perform theatrical military displays to garner local support. On May 7, 1842 the Nauvoo Legion mustered as part of a “Programme Militaire.” They performed a sham battle and Joseph Smith gave an address. Special guests, including Judge Stephen A. Douglas, attended and were invited to Smith&#x27;s home for dinner. This event marked a breaking point in the strained relationship between Joseph Smith and John C. Bennett. 

During the sham battle, Bennett had asked Joseph to move to the rear of the cavalry without his usual guards; Albert Rockwood, commander of the prophet&#x27;s bodyguards, objected and Smith chose a different spot. Rumors spread that Bennett had attempted to assassinate Smith during the demonstration. Although not the only factor in the dissolution of their collaboration, by the end of the month Bennett resigned from office of mayor, was removed from leadership in the Nauvoo Legion, was expelled from the Nauvoo Masonic Lodge, and was excommunicated from the church.

On August 3, 1842, Wilson Law won a close election with Lyman Wight, and became the Major General of the Nauvoo Legion.

===Thwarted extradition of Joseph Smith===
On June 17, 1843, a warrant for Joseph Smith&#x27;s arrest was jointly issued by Illinois Governor Thomas Ford and Missouri Governor Thomas Reynolds on grounds of treason. On June 23 Joseph Smith was arrested in the town of Dixon and preparations made to extradite him to Missouri. In response, the Nauvoo City council enacted what amounted to martial law and Nauvoo Legion troops organized and waited for instruction.

On June 25, Joseph Smith sent a letter to Major General Wilson Law, asking him to bring a force to prevent his “being kidnapped into Missouri.” In all, between 100–300 men left Nauvoo to rescue Joseph Smith.
On June 27, Nauvoo Legion scouts intercepted the arresting party and Joseph Smith told his captors, “I am not going to Missouri this time. These are my boys!”

On June 29, Generals Wilson and William Law, 60 of the Nauvoo cavalry, and 100 additional men escorted the party to Nauvoo, where Joseph Smith was released by the municipal court. Smith spent the next few days greeting volunteer units of the Nauvoo Legion as they returned home, blessing them for their loyalty and efforts, and recounting the story of his kidnapping and triumphant return.

====Missouri response====

Reaction to the failed extradition from Missouri was swift and negative. Missouri Governor Thomas Reynolds felt the Legion had overreached its authority and demanded Illinois Governor Ford to call out the state militia to arrest Joseph Smith and extradite him to Missouri. Governor Ford did not comply, which increased tension between the two states and infuriated many of the non-Mormon residents of Hancock County. The &quot;Warsaw Signal&quot; published, &quot;It will be but a small matter to raise volunteers enough here to raze the city of Nauvoo to the ground; if the governor of Illinois fears to deliver up Jo Smith, there will be something serious between the two states.&quot;

In September 1843, a conference in Carthage, Illinois was organized to oppose growing Mormon political power. The conference believed that Smith had too much power over the Legion and Municipal Court. The conference resolved to resist &quot;peaceably if we can, but forcibly, if we must&quot;; to call on the Missouri Governor to once again demand the extradition of Joseph Smith, and to oppose any politician from any party that would &quot;truckle to the heads of the Mormon clan.&quot;

In Nauvoo, the Legion responded by drilling more intensely, requesting Governor Ford to provide more arms to the Legion, and a renewed recruitment push. In direct response to the Carthage conference, the citizenry of Nauvoo passed a resolution affirming Joseph Smith&#x27;s role as the General, Mayor and Prophet stating, &quot;if he has equals, he has no superiors.&quot; The resolution affirmed the professionalism of the Legion as a &quot;well disciplined and faithful band of invincibles&quot; and praised Governor Ford for not extraditing Smith.

====Impact on 1843 election====
Smith&#x27;s attorney, Congressional Whig candidate Cyrus Walker, had agreed to represent him in return for the Mormon vote. However, Smith later told his followers that while he would keep his word and vote for Walker, his brother Hyrum Smith had a revelation they should vote for the opponent Joseph Hoge. The Mormon bloc vote was a deciding factor and Hoge won the district by a margin of 547 votes. This was interpreted as a &quot;bait-and-switch maneuver&quot;, &quot;a flimsy ruse&quot; and a &quot;betrayal.&quot; It weakened Nauvoo&#x27;s political support from the Whigs, and curtailed attempts from all parties to court the Mormon vote. This reneged promise, along with Smith&#x27;s use of the Legion to avoid extradition, became the basis for growing anti-Mormon sentiment and a bipartisan political movement to revoke the Nauvoo Charter.

=== Arrest of Daniel and Philander Avery ===

On November 19, 1843 individuals from Missouri arrested Philander Avery and then on December 2, 1843 arrested his father Daniel Avery on charges of horse theft. With the assistance of Hancock County Illinois residents, they were taken to a Monticello, Missouri jail. The arrest was viewed as a kidnapping in Nauvoo generating a nervous atmosphere in the city of Nauvoo. Joseph Smith made a request to Governor Ford to call out the Legion, which was denied by Governor Ford in a letter dated December 12, who feared conflict with Missouri writing, &quot;I would advise your citizens to be strictly peaceable torwards the people of Missouri.&quot; On the same day, December 12, the Nauvoo City Council enacted an ordinance allowing for a municipal police force with Hosea Stout as its Chief of Police, greatly expanding an earlier &quot;city watch&quot; that had been created on January 30, 1843. The police force was under the authority of the city council, and could be ordered into action by the Mayor of Nauvoo, rather than the governor.

On December 18th Smith ignored the order from Governor Ford and called out both the city police force and members of the Legion to prepare against a rumored mob forming to the south in Warsaw, Illinois, tasking them to prepare to rescue the two men. The situation was defused when Philander Avery escaped, and on December 25 when Daniel Avery was released due to a writ of Habeas Corpus.

===Nauvoo under Mormon martial law===

Tensions between Nauvoo and surrounding non-Mormon settlements peaked by the summer of 1844, in part because the Nauvoo Legion came to be regarded as Smith&#x27;s private army. Governor Thomas Ford called the militia &quot;a military force at their own command.&quot; Tensions were further exacerbated by defectors from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, including Wilson Law, who was the Legion&#x27;s ranking Major General. Wilson Law was excommunicated from the church on April 18 over his opposition to the doctrine of plural marriage and a court martial was held that expelled Law from the Legion on April 29. At the same time on April 29, Charles C. Rich was ordered to take command of the Legion. For a while over the next months, Jonathan Dunham filled in for Rich as Major General while Rich was away in Michigan.

Wilson Law and his brother William Law were key in starting the &quot;Nauvoo Expositor&quot;, a newspaper critical of Joseph Smith and his doctrines of plural marriage. On June 10, 1844, the Nauvoo City council declared the &quot;Nauvoo Expositor&quot; to be a public nuisance. Joseph Smith, acting as mayor, ordered the city marshal to destroy the printing press and materials.

Acting as Lieutenant General, Joseph Smith ordered Major General Jonathan Dunham to use the Nauvoo Legion to assist the city marshal. Non-Mormons claimed the Legion was instrumental in destroying the press and called for the arrest of Joseph Smith and other members of the city council for riot. They were arrested but released by the Nauvoo city court on a writ of habeas corpus.
On Tuesday, June 18, 1844 Joseph Smith spoke to the Legion from the platform of a partially constructed building across from the Nauvoo Mansion. He stood in full military dress and spoke for an hour and a half to a group of about 4000. Raising his sword, he said: &quot;I call God and angels to witness that I have unsheathed my sword with a firm and unalterable determination that this people shall have their legal rights, and be protected from mob violence, or my blood shall be split upon the ground like water, and my body consigned to the silent tomb.&quot; He declared martial law and afterwards marched the troops through Main Street, deploying them across the city to protect from water or land invasions.

===Arrest and killing of Joseph Smith===
In response to Nauvoo&#x27;s military activity, an opposing force of armed Illinois Militia gathered, numbering between 1600–1800 men. Governor Ford offered protection to Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum Smith if they surrendered, but threatened to call out the state militia against Nauvoo if they did not. They agreed to submit to arrest on charges of inciting a riot and were taken to Carthage, Illinois. The judge in Carthage revoked bail based on a claim that the Mormons had tried to use the Nauvoo Legion against the state militia. Ford called off most of the Illinois militia and recalled state-issued arms in Nauvoo. In the late afternoon of June 27, 1844 the Carthage Jail where joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith were held was attacked and they were killed.

About two thirds of the Legion had assembled in Nauvoo at noon on the day of the killing, but disbanded after an emissary from the Governor indicated that there was no danger to the Smith&#x27;s. As word reached Nauvoo, the full Legion assembled on the parade grounds at 10:00 am on June 28, 1844, and accompanied the bodies of Joseph and Hyrum Smith to the Nauvoo Mansion. Leaders preached calm, and the Legion was not used at that time to avenge the deaths.

==Legion survival after death of Joseph Smith==

The death of Joseph Smith caused a succession crisis over who would lead the Church going forward. Brigham Young began to take on the roles Joseph Smith previously had, and on August 31, 1844 he was elected as the Legion&#x27;s &quot;Lieutenant General&quot;. Previously, Young had been an assistant chaplain. On September 27, Charles C. Rich was commissioned as the Major General of the Nauvoo Legion.

===Wolf Hunt and Legion parade without arms===
Tensions did not ease that summer between Mormon and anti-Mormons; while the Nauvoo City council issued writs against men accused of murdering the Smith brothers, plans were made to rid Hancock county of all Mormons. Distributed flyers invited all armed men to participate in a “wolf hunt” in Warsaw on September 26 and 27. Under the guise of a common practice to flush out animals along the prairie, this “wolf hunt” was a plan to attack Nauvoo. 

Forced to respond, Governor Ford called on Brigadier General John J. Hardin and Whig Major Edward D. Baker to lead five hundred volunteers from nine counties surrounding Hancock towards Nauvoo. This movement was intended to 1) disperse the wolf hunt militia, 2) attempt arrests of men connected to the killing of the Smith brothers, and 3) gather the Nauvoo Legion for military inspection. Hardin effectively dispersed the gathering militias, however their leaders escaped to Missouri and otherwise evaded arrest. Ford noted, &quot;The Carthage Greys fled almost in a body, taking their arms with them.” 

On September 28, Brigham Young reviewed the Legion with General Hardin and Governor Ford in the audience. Many of the officers paraded without weapons, to remind Ford that he had recalled state-issued arms prior to the events at Carthage. 

Throughout the fall of 1844 the Legion would occasionally parade and conduct sham battles.

===Repeal of the Nauvoo Charter===
On December 19th, the Illinois Senate voted to repeal the Nauvoo Charter, and on January 24th the Illinois House passed its own version of legislation. On January 29, 1845, the Illinois council of revision signed the repeal, and the Nauvoo Legion was no longer recognized as state militia.

===Whistling and Whittling Brigade===
With the repeal of the Nauvoo Charter, the city was left without an official militia or police force.
In response, in March 1845 Brigham Young organized the Bishops and Deacons to 1) &quot;take care of the poor&quot; and 2) guard the city at night, to keep everything straight.” Out of these efforts came an organization known as the Whistling and Whittling Brigade who used legal, nonviolent means to monitor apostates, strangers, &quot;Gentiles,&quot; or enemies and encourage them to leave town. Members would surround and follow suspicious individuals without engaging in conversation; They whittled pieces of wood, casting shavings in the person&#x27;s direction, all while whistling, gathering more members of the group. The organization lasted for less than two months and was phased out as Nauvoo regained law enforcement. Initially composed of adult men, the group attracted more and more youth until by April, boys as young as twelve took on active roles as Whittlers. This shift in demographic corresponded with increased criticism from within and without Nauvoo.

===Nauvoo arsenal===
After the recall of state-issued arms, the Legion rearmed themselves privately. While plans for an official arsenal had been discussed since at least June 10, 1843, it was not until September 16, 1844 that Lieutenant General Brigham Young dedicated a site near the temple “to the God of the armies of Israel” and broke ground. Prior to this point, the Nauvoo Masonic Hall had been used as a commissary and to store arms. Construction of the arsenal, in connection with construction of a gunsmith&#x27;s shop and a powder magazine, continued despite the repeal of the Nauvoo Charter and the recall of state-issued arms. According to Prince, “On June 23 1845 [Hosea Stout] wrote of going to see the arsenal, which is a clear inference that the Legion was storing weapons and military equipment.”
The arsenal was funded in part through non-attendance fines. Nauvoo Legion Association Scrip was also issued in $5 quantities. Records in the Nauvoo Legion Arsenal Account book indicate that local merchants were sometimes paid to procure and ship arms and ammunition for the Legion.

===Rising tensions===
Although no longer sanctioned, the Legion continued to function as though it still had authorization, including drills, parades, and new military appointments. Major General Rich stopped using his military rank and took on the title &quot;President of the Organized Quorums of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Hancock County.&quot;

At a September 9, 1845 meeting of the Anti-Mormon party, members were fired upon. In retaliation a group led by Levi Williams set fire to the Mormon settlements of Yelrome, Morley, and Lima and destroyed forty four homes. The morning of September 16, Lieutenant Frank Worrell of the nearby Carthage militia was shot and killed by Orrin Porter Rockwell after refusing an order to stop by non-Mormon Sherriff William Backenstos. Worrell had been the sergeant of the guard at Carthage when the Smiths were assassinated.

Backenstos and Rockwell went to Nauvoo and found Brigham Young, asking for assistance. Young offered 2,000 legionnaires to be commanded by Backenstos, who went through Hancock county burning &quot;Gentile&quot; property, and driving anti-Mormons from their homes, many of who fled across the border to Missouri and Iowa. Governor Ford wrote that &quot;they sallied forth and ravaged the country, stealing and plundering whatever was convenient to carry or drive away.&quot;

Governor Ford sent an army of 400 troops along with Judge Stephen A. Douglas to stop the violence on both sides. The army searched for bodies of two men believed to be murdered by Mormons, and after pressure from the Anti-Mormon party, arrested Sherriff Backenstos for the murder of Worrell (Rockwell went into hiding).

==Departure from Nauvoo==
On October 1, 1845 Brigham Young announced the Latter-day Saints would leave Nauvoo and travel west. On February 4, 1846 the first group of Latter-day Saints crossed the Mississippi River, with plans to evacuate the entire city by the fall of that year.

Sometime in the late winter or spring Governor Ford stationed a small militia unit in Nauvoo to preserve order as Mormons prepared to leave the city. He removed the unit on May 1, 1846, because of the expense and being outnumbered by those hostile and ready to attack the city.

On April 30, 1846 the Legion stood guard as the Nauvoo Temple was dedicated.

===Battle of Nauvoo===
On September 10, 1846, 1,000 members of the anti-Mormon party marched on Nauvoo to expel the remaining several hundred Mormon citizens. In response, 150 men of Nauvoo gathered to defend themselves while women and children sheltered near the Temple. They were divided into the Spartan Bandremnant members of the Nauvoo Legionand the Kill Devil Companya group of non-Mormon New Citizens who were weary of anti-Mormon antagonism and hoped to defend their newly purchased property. Over the next five days the band of 150 withstood the siege of 1,000 men through methods such as guerrilla warfare, placing mines called a “hell&#x27;s half acre”, and building up bulwarks. A steamboat shaft was turned into a makeshift cannon. Some women “gleaned” fields by collecting the anti-Mormon&#x27;s discharged cannonballs to be reused in Mormon cannons. Three Mormons were killed and several injured on both sides.

On September 16, 1846, the Mormons surrendered, knowing that they could not withstand the siege indefinitely. They agreed to leave Nauvoo within five days. Even with the treaty terms, anti-Mormon militia members harassed the Mormons by ordering some out of the city at the point of a bayonet, entering the temple and shouting obscenities from the belltower, interfering with the burials, and searching departing wagons to remove weapons and goods.

==Legacy==

The Mormon Battalion was a US military unit during the Mexican-American War formed in 1846 of 500 Mormon volunteers, many of whom had served in the Nauvoo Legion.

Many Mormon Battalion members would go on to become leaders in the Utah Territorial Militia organized in 1852 by the Provisional State of Deseret and the Territory of Utah law. This force was called the Nauvoo Legion interchangeably, out of respect to their heritage.

The Nauvoo Legion in Utah participated in the Black Hawk War and the Walker War.

On April 1, 1857 the Nauvoo Legion in Utah was reorganized, dividing the Utah Territory into thirteen military districts, in preparation to battle against the United States in the Utah War. In September the Iron County district (which included several former members of the Illinois Nauvoo Legion) participated in the Mountain Meadows Massacre.

Two cavalry units of the Nauvoo Legion were used by the federal government to protect mail and freight lines during the Civil War.

In 1887 the Nauvoo Legion in Utah was disbanded by the Edmunds-Tucker Act.

==Weapons and equipment==

Records are sparse regarding military readiness of the Nauvoo Legion in terms of uniforms, equipment, discipline, and armaments, making an accurate state difficult to ascertain.

As was common among militias at the time, members were generally equipped with personally owned firearms. Its estimated the state of Illinois provided the Legion with three pieces of cannon, and around 250 small arms. While it is unknown what type of rifles were issued, it was most likely Model 1817 common rifle. An effort by Hosea Stout in September 1843 to obtain more from the state was unsuccessful. In 1989 a document surfaced detailing the personnel and materiel readiness of the second cohort as it stood early 1844. At that time the second cohort had been provided by the state 2 cannons, 4 pistols, 98 swords, 133 rifles and 6 muskets. After the destruction of the Nauvoo Expositor and subsequent arrest of Joseph Smith, the legion was ordered to return its state issued arms, and surrendered three pieces of cannon and 220 small arms. 
Nauvoo was home to a gunsmith shop run by inventor Jonathan Browning, who repaired and built guns for citizens of Nauvoo and surrounding region. Browning invented a harmonica rifle around 1844, that became a sought after model by local Latter Day Saints.

After the forced return of arms to the state, the church began to acquire arms that it referred to as &quot;public arms&quot;. Brigham Young noted in his journal in September 1844 that &quot;some arms and ammunition&quot; had been received from St. Louis. Tithing money was used to purchase a six pound cannon in April 1845. Also in 1845 John Steele mentioned moving &quot;forty stands of muskets&quot; and a cannon &quot;Old Sow&quot; to the temple to be repaired. &quot;Old Sow&quot; was taken over the plains to Utah and is on display at the Church History Museum in Salt Lake City. 

In October 1845 the Legion purchased 100 muskets. In November 1845 Orson Pratt used tithing money to purchase four hundred dollars worth of Allen&#x27;s revolving six shooter pistols (pepperboxes). William Hickman remembered in a memoir that there were four artillery pieces and five hundred stands of small arms. A 12-pound howitzer carronade, a ship cannon, was purchased by the Legion in Nauvoo, to go along with one three-pounder and two six-ounder cannons. At least one cannon was drilled out by John Kay. For the final battle of Nauvoo five cannons were made out of hollow steamboat shafts.

<doc id="739371" wikidata="Q3940950" url="?curid=739371" title="Ron Athey">
<text>Ron Athey (born December 16, 1961) is an American performance artist associated with body art and with extreme performance art. He has performed in the U.S. and internationally (especially in the UK and Europe). Athey&#x27;s work explores challenging subjects like the relationships between desire, sexuality and traumatic experience. Many of his works include aspects of S&amp;M in order to confront preconceived ideas about the body in relation to masculinity and religious iconography.

==Life and work==
Ron Athey&#x27;s earliest work dates back to collaborations with Rozz Williams during the early 1980s. Athey and Williams performed as Premature Ejaculation, staging actions in clubs and galleries and producing experimental recordings and performances for camera. Their work together was photographed by Karen Filter and published in the punk magazine &quot;No Mag&quot; in 1982. The practice for which he is most known grows from performances developed for club contexts in Los Angeles, such as Club Fuck! and Sin-a-matic. In 1992, he staged his first major ensemble performance, &quot;Martyrs &amp; Saints&quot;. This is the first of what the artist calls his &quot;Torture Trilogy&quot;. It was followed by &quot;4 Scenes in a Harsh Life&quot; (1993-1996) and &quot;Deliverance&quot; (1995). These works were performed in the U.S., Mexico and in Europe. In 1998, he appeared in &quot;Sex/Life in L.A.&quot; Jochen Hick&#x27;s adult documentary about the sex lives of the guys who make L.A. adult movies.

His work has expanded into solo performances, collaborations, and into experimental theatre and opera. Solo performances include &quot;Solar Anus&quot; (1999), &quot;Self-Obliteration&quot; solos (2008-2011), a series of performances inspired by St. Sebastian (e.g. &quot;Sebastian Suspended&quot;, 1999; &quot;Sebastiane&quot;, 2014). His collaborative performances include the &quot;Incorruptible Flesh&quot; series, (1996-2013), commenced in collaboration with the late Chicago-based performance artist Lawrence Steger and continued in solo and collaborative installments. His most recent performances, such as &quot;Incorruptible Flesh (Messianic Remains)&quot; (2013) expand on aspects that define his earlier ensemble and collaborative work. &quot;Joyce&quot; (2002) is an experimental theatre work which uses projection and live performance to offer a portrait of the women who defined the artist&#x27;s childhood. He and the artist Juliana Snapper developed &quot;Judas Cradle&quot; (2004-2005), an experimental opera. In 2010 he initiated a series of works investigating the rituals of spiritualism and Pentecostalism, &quot;Gifts of the Spirit&quot;.

Athey has a significant curatorial and programming practice. In 2000 and 2001, he collaborated with Vaginal Davis on a performance-centered queer club night, G.I.M.P. Un-Ltd. These events were staged at a bar in Silver Lake (Zen Sushi) and featured performances by Athey and Davis, as well as John Fleck, Osseus Labyrint, Los Superelegantes, and Kembra Pfahler and The Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black. In 2001 and 2002, Athey and Vaginal Davis curated an eighteen-hour performance festival as a part of Outfest, the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Festival. Staged under the festival&#x27;s &quot;Platinum&quot; program, these events featured work by a range of artists, including Bruce LaBruce, Slava Mogutin, Brendan Mullen, JD Samson, Selene Luna, Mehmet Sander, and Glen Meadmore. Athey has collaborated with others (notably Lee Adams) on a curatorial project inspired by the writings of Georges Bataille, &quot;Visions of Excess&quot; (Birmingham, 2005 and 2008; Ljubljana, 2004; London, 2009). These performance programs have featured such artists such as Franko B, Julie Tolentino, Zackary Drucker, Nicole Blackman, Marisa Carnesky and Kira O&#x27;Reilly.

Through the 1990s and 2000s, Athey was a regular contributor to magazines and newspapers including &quot;Infected Faggot Perspectives&quot;, &quot;Honcho&quot; and the &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot;. Rick Castro interviewed and photographed Athey for AnotherMan UK, in November 2018. He occasionally teaches performance (most recently, at CalArts during the 2015–2016 academic year). He currently lives in Los Angeles, California.

==Influence==

The artist Catherine Opie, whose connections to Athey originate in Los Angeles&#x27;s queer club/underground scene, photographed the artist in 1994 as a part of her &quot;Portraits&quot; series. In 1999, the Estate Project for Artists with AIDS invited Opie to produce a series of works honoring of Ron Athey&#x27;s work. Opie and Athey collaborated to produce thirteen images from his performance practice, using the world&#x27;s largest Polaroid camera. This series is widely exhibited, including in exhibitions exploring the relationship between photography and performance. Athey (and his former home in Silver Lake Hills) makes a notable appearance as a macabre, cross-dressing mortician in Rick Castro and Bruce LaBruce&#x27;s 1996 film Hustler White. His work has also been referenced by mainstream artists. Athey was the art-director for Porno for Pyros&#x27;s video for &quot;Sadness&quot; (1994, remade as &quot;A Little Sadness&quot; in 2005); including performances by Athey and his company, the video adapts images and looks from his performance &quot;Four Scenes in a Harsh Life&quot;, including the contentious Human Printing Press scene, in which Athey cuts symbols on the back of company member Divinity Fudge (aka Darryl Carlton). David Bowie appropriated (without permission) aspects of Athey&#x27;s performances in the video for &quot;The Hearts Filthy Lesson&quot; (1995), in which porn performer Bud Hole stages signature piercing actions, and Bowie invoked Athey as an influence for his album &quot;1. Outside&quot; (1995), including in the cover notes.

The first book dedicated to Athey and his work, &quot;Pleading in the Blood: The Art and Performance of Ron Athey&quot; edited by Dominic Johnson, was published in 2013 by the Live Art Development Agency and Intellect. It includes writing about his work by major artists including Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Anohni, Robert Wilson, Lydia Lunch and Bruce LaBruce, and essays by scholars such as Amelia Jones, Jennifer Doyle, Adrian Heathfield, Homi K. Bhabha and others.

==NEA controversy==
In 1994 Athey became a figure in a culture war, as conservative politicians fought to bar artwork with visible gay and feminist content from receiving public funding. Controversy regarding the nature of his work was part of a series of battles regarding work by gay artists—such as a lawsuit filed by the NEA Four (Karen Finley, Holly Hughes, Tim Miller and John Fleck), and legal battles around the exhibition of work of Robert Mapplethorpe, David Wojnarowicz, Andres Serrano and Joel-Peter Witkin. Excerpts from &quot;Four Scenes in a Harsh Life&quot; were staged at Patrick&#x27;s Cabaret in Minneapolis on March 5, 1994, with support from the Walker Art Center. The Walker&#x27;s Performing Arts Director, John Killacky remembers that &quot;the sold-out performance was well received by an audience of about one hundred. Post-show discussions with the artist, attended by 80 people, were thoughtful and engaging. Theatre and dance critics had been invited, none chose to attend.&quot; During one scene in this performance, Athey made light cuts in co-performer Darryl Carlton&#x27;s (stage name Divinity Fudge) back, placed strips of absorbent paper towel on the cuts and then, using a pulley, hoisted the blood-stained cloths into the air. Local art critic/reporter Mary Abbe (who had not witnessed the performance) wrote a news account of complaints concerning the performance; this story appeared on the front page of the &quot;Minneapolis Star-Tribune&quot;. The report quoted the Walker&#x27;s director Kathy Halbreich and performing arts director John Killacky, audience members, and Minnesota state health officials. The supervisor of the AIDS epidemiology unit in Minnesota&#x27;s state health department said that &quot;it did not appear that audience members were endangered.&quot; That story was picked up by the Associated Press and quickly made national headlines. The then-widespread anxiety about AIDS combined with a shocked reaction from those unfamiliar with S&amp;M-related art: some critics and lawmakers, including Jesse Helms, falsely described his performances as exposing audience members to HIV-infected blood.

Although this 1994 performance was supported only indirectly (via the Walker Center) by $150 from the National Endowment for the Arts, Athey&#x27;s name was frequently invoked in criticism of the NEA. Athey was not alone in this: performance artists Tim Miller, John Fleck, Karen Finley and Holly Hughes would later become the NEA Four as they fought a case regarding funding for their work before the Supreme Court. Unlike these other artists, Athey has never applied for federal funds to support his work. Nevertheless, the controversy over this incident shaped public perception of his work. In a 2015 Artist Op-Ed for the Walker Art Center, the artist writes that he was &quot;more or less blacklisted&quot; from U.S. arts venues until 2005, when he and Snapper staged &quot;Judas Cradle&quot; at REDCAT in Los Angeles. His 2014 performance of &quot;Sebastiane&quot; at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles was his first performance inside an American museum.

<doc id="739372" wikidata="Q1863969" url="?curid=739372" title="Dial H for Hero">
<text>Dial H for Hero is a comic book feature published by DC Comics about a magical dial that enables an ordinary person to become a superhero for a short time, such as an hour, by selecting the letters H-E-R-O in order. Each time it is used, the dial causes its possessor to become a superhero with a different name, costume, and powers. These superheroes are usually new, but on one occasion the dial caused its user to become a duplicate of Plastic Man. Some versions of the dial, like the original, contain additional letters, allowing other kinds of transformations. The title of the series is a play on the title of the 1954 American crime mystery film directed by Alfred Hitchcock titled &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;.

==Original series==

The original series debuted in &quot;House of Mystery&quot; #156 (January 1966), and continued until issue #173 (March–April 1968). The art was by Jim Mooney (though he did not finish the run), with scripts by Dave Wood.

The original owner of the dial is Robert &quot;Robby&quot; Reed, a highly intelligent teenager with a penchant for exclaiming &quot;Sockamagee!&quot; He lives in the fictional town of Littleville, Colorado with his grandfather &quot;Gramps&quot; Reed and their housekeeper Miss Millie. While playing with his friends, Robby accidentally falls into a cavern and discovers the dial in one of its alcoves. The origins of the dial and how it came to be in the cavern are never revealed.

Resembling a rotary telephone dial, the device is hand-held with unknown symbols inside the dial&#x27;s finger- openings and along its outer rim, which Robby deciphers into modern English letters. In Mark Waid&#x27;s &quot;Silver Age&quot; mini-series, it is revealed that the symbols on the dial are Interlac. Each time he dials the letters H-E-R-O, Robby transforms into a different super-powered being; dialing O-R-E-H reverts him to his normal form. Robby soon uses the dial to protect Littleville under the guises of numerous superheroes.

The wide array of Robby&#x27;s superhero identities included the Squid, Quake-Master, King Coil, Hornet-Man, Shadow-Man, Mighty Moppet, King Kandy, Future-Man, Human Bullet, Super-Charge, the Mole, Mr. Echo, Hypno-Man, the Cometeer and the Human Starfish, among others.

==1980s series==

The second &quot;Dial H for Hero&quot; series debuted in the 1980s, in a special insert in &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; #272 (February 1981), then ran in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #479–490 and continued in &quot;New Adventures of Superboy&quot; #28–49; the duo also appeared alongside Superman in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #44. A new feature of this series was that the readers could submit new hero and villain characters, which were then used in the stories. The submitters were given credit for their creations (and a T-shirt with the series logo), but the characters became DC Comics&#x27; property. Some, however, only made cameo one-panel appearances. The original writer and artist in the series were Marv Wolfman and Carmine Infantino.

In this series, two other dials are discovered years later by teenagers Christopher &quot;Chris&quot; King and Victoria &quot;Vicki&quot; Grant of the New England town of Fairfax in a &quot;haunted house&quot;. These dials — disguised as a watch and a necklace — only have the letters H-E-R-O on them, and work only for an hour, after which they will not work for another hour. King and Grant begin protecting Fairfax from a number of menaces. Unknown to them, most of these villains are created by a mysterious villain known only as The Master (who is obsessed with the H-dials for reasons unknown for most of the series) who creates them from the cell samples of unknown people.

Eventually Chris and Vicki discover that a fellow student named Nick Stevens has been drawing up superheroes as a hobby — and somehow, the dials turn them into those heroes. With Nick&#x27;s help, they find out that their dials were created by a being called The Wizard (not to be confused with the DC Comics villain of the same name), whom the Master thought he&#x27;d killed years before. In truth, The Wizard faked his death while he looked for the original Hero Dial. With it, he merges with The Master — and transforms into Robby Reed.

Robby explains that years before, he had used the dial to split in two (dialing &quot;S P L I T&quot;) so that he could disarm a dead man&#x27;s switch, while his other self, the Wizard, defeated the villain who set it. However, the Wizard carried all of Robby&#x27;s inherent goodness, while the Robby that remained possessed only evil impulses; the original Hero Dial was lost when this Robby, renaming himself The Master, dialed &quot;hide yourself&quot;, causing the dial to vanish along with The Master&#x27;s and The Wizard&#x27;s memories of their former life as Robby Reed. While The Master learned genetic techniques that allowed him to create his army of super-villains, the Wizard was driven to create the new H-dials, unconsciously designing limitations into them to prevent what happened to Robby from recurring (only heroic identities, a time limit, and the exclusion of letters other than H-E-R-O; the latter, however, did not prevent Chris from experimenting on one occasion and dialing H-O-R-R-O-R, with disastrous results). With Nick developing the ability to actively influence the dials&#x27; results (rather than subconsciously as before), Robby passes his dial to Nick, and retires as a hero.

In &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; #45 (June 1988), Victoria and Chris&#x27; history after the end of their series is revealed. After the two teens graduated from high school Vicki was recruited to join a cult called the Children of the Sun, where she was physically and mentally abused, deranging her. She sought out her former partner Chris in order to kill him. With help from the Teen Titans, Chris rescued her in the following issue. Chris now finds that he changes into a new superhero every hour, without the dial, and remains that way until he expends an unspecified amount of energy. He decides to continue his superhero career, using a suit provided by S.T.A.R. Labs to monitor his changes.

In &quot;Superboy and the Ravers&quot; #5 (January 1997), Hero Cruz finds Vicki&#x27;s H-dial in the lair of Scavenger, and uses it to gain superpowers. A still deranged Vicki returns in issue #13 (September 1997) to get her dial back from Hero, but she regains her sanity once she uses the device. She is last seen in the care of the Forces, a family of metahumans.

==&quot;Silver Age&quot; event==
During the 2000 &quot;Silver Age&quot; cross-over event, Robby encountered his old &quot;House of Mystery&quot; co-star Martian Manhunter, in &quot;Silver Age: Dial H for Hero&quot; #1. Believing that he and the rest of the Justice League had gone bad, Robby turns into a superhero to stop him. Actually, Martian Manhunter has been mind-swapped with Dr. Light (the other Justice League have undergone similar mental transpositions, but those seen here are only Light&#x27;s illusions). Subsequently, in &quot;Silver Age 80-Page Giant&quot; #1 (July 2000), Robby lends the H-Dial to the now mind/body restored Justice League, allowing several of its members to transform themselves into new superheroes to defeat Agamemno&#x27;s Injustice League at a time when they had learned how to defeat the Justice League members in their normal forms:
* Superman becomes Doc Fission, a hero that can divide his enemies.
* Batman becomes Minuteman, a hero that can compress time and make punching hourglass.
* Flash becomes Marionette, a hero that can use a weapon - a boomerang that is shaped like the letter X.
* Atom becomes Mod-Man, a hero that is like Robbie Reed King Coil but with a whole body.
* Black Canary becomes Miss Fortune, a hero that uses a wand to make magic.
* Aquaman becomes Terra-Firma, a hero that looks like a brick forest Sasquatch.
* Green Arrow becomes Poltergeist hero that is a ghost that a can copy any attack.
* Martian Manhunter becomes Go-Go a teleporting hero.

In these new forms, the Justice League were able to defeat the Injustice League.

==2003 series==

DC relaunched &quot;Dial H for Hero&quot; again in 2003, this time simply titled &quot;H.E.R.O.&quot; Written by Will Pfeifer with art by Kano, the series focused on the effect the H-Dial has on a series of average people whose lives are usually ruined by the pressures of superherodom. Robby Reed, now grown old and bitter, is searching for the missing dial, determined to retrieve it and keep a serial killer from getting his hands on it. &quot;H.E.R.O.&quot; lasted 22 issues, ending with the H-Dial&#x27;s powers being internalized into Robby Reed and some other people who have come across it, and the H-Dial itself being sent back in time to 50,000 BC. Superman is featured in one of the stories.

==2012 series==

For The New 52 initiative, DC began publishing a reboot of the series titled &quot;Dial H&quot;, written by China Miéville with art by Mateus Santolouco. The series focuses on Nelson Jent, an out-of-shape, unemployed middle-age man who accesses superpowers by dialing seemingly random numbers in an old phone booth. Another main character is an older woman named Roxie Hodder who takes the identity of &quot;Manteau&quot; regardless of what powers the dial calls up and acts as an advisor to Nelson. Following the fight against Ex Nihilo and Abyss, Nelson and Roxie work to figure out the secrets of the H-Dials.

Later issues of the series introduces the S-Dial which turns anyone who uses it into a superhero sidekick to match the person&#x27;s superhero form.

When it comes to Nelson and Roxie&#x27;s encounter with the Fixer (who is associated with the different dials), both of them have an encounter with a group of superheroes called the Dial Bunch who have fought the Fixer before. There is also an introduction to the J-Dial (which enables the user to jump through worlds), the G-Dial (which can summon any technological gadget), the Dial-Tapper (which can copy any H-Dial in range), and the Auto-Dialer.

To tie-in with DC&#x27;s &quot;Villain&#x27;s Month&quot; event, DC published &quot;Justice League #23.3: Dial E&quot;, a coda to the series. It featured the Q-Dial in which a person must be evil to use it. The Q in Q-Dial is for &quot;Qued&quot; which is an old word for bad.

==2019 series==
A &quot;Dial H for Hero&quot; limited series was launched as part of the Wonder Comics imprint for younger readers, starring new protagonists Miguel Montez and Summer Pickens. The series was written by Sam Humphries and drawn by Joe Quinones. Issue #1 was released on March 27, 2019. Originally intended for a six-issue run, &quot;Dial H For Hero&quot; was extended to a total of 12 issues along with its fellow Wonder Comics limited series &quot;Wonder Twins&quot;. The final issue was released on February 26, 2020.

Miguel and Summer are teenagers living in the small town of Devil&#x27;s Canyon, California. Miguel is an orphan who works in his uncle Brant&#x27;s mayonnaise-themed food truck, and has engaged in daredevil stunts ever since he was saved by Superman from a near-death experience at age 10. Summer is a frequent runaway with a troubled home life. The H-Dial manifests itself in front of Miguel during a bicycle stunt gone wrong as he is plummeting into Devil&#x27;s Canyon – dialling &quot;H&quot; for &quot;Hero&quot;, Miguel is turned into a superhero called Monster Truck. When Miguel comes to and finds that he has trashed a car dealership, Summer arrives in Uncle Brant&#x27;s stolen food truck and the two flee town together along with the H-Dial.

Via the H-Dial, Miguel and Summer are in contact with a mysterious elderly man known as the Operator, who is soon revealed to be Robby Reed. Meanwhile, it also transpires that there are thousands of former users of the H-Dial across the country, many of whom are desperate for another chance to get superpowers – the mysterious villain Mister Thunderbolt has recruited many into his Thunderbolt Club and sent them to take the H-Dial. After being targeted by two Thunderbolt Club members, Miguel and Summer resolve to travel across the country to Metropolis and give the H-Dial to Superman as the only person they trust not to misuse it. It is later revealed that the Thunderbolt Club are in pursuit of four hero-dials, named in reference to the CMYK color model for printing: in addition to the magenta M-Dial that appeared before Miguel, there is the cyan C-Dial, the yellow Y-Dial and the black K-Dial, each with different functions. While the M-Dial transforms the user into a random superhero, the C-Dial transforms the user into their inner superhero, the Y-Dial was responsible for splitting Robby Reed into the Operator and Mister Thunderbolt, and the K-Dial sends its user into the K-Hole.

Snapper Carr appears in the series as a recurring supporting character, being identified as a past user of the H-Dial. Issue #10 shows Miguel and Summer traveling through various realities in the DC multiverse, including an extended sequence on Earth-32 where every superhero is an amalgam of two main-universe heroes (e.g. Super-Martian, Bat Lantern, Wonder Hawk). Issue #11 is primarily set on the planet Apokolips where the K-Dial is located, and features extended homages to the &quot;Reign of the Supermen&quot; and &quot;Superman Red/Superman Blue&quot; storylines. Granny Goodness stated that the scientists working for her that dialed the K-Dial never returned alive as it is &quot;a gateway to anguish, a pit of oblivion&quot;. In issue #12 when Miguel and Summer defeat Mister Thunderbolt, they dial up H-O-P-E on the Multiverse Dial and travel the Multiverse until they are brought back to the Heroverse through the Chromium H-Dial.

The series contains many other homages to significant works in comic books and manga, through shifting art style and the identities of various heroes summoned by the H-Dial. These include &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, various Vertigo Comics titles, and the works of Mike Allred, Rob Liefeld, Moebius, Frank Miller, Chris Ware and others. The series also examines the concept of a superhero&#x27;s &quot;secret origin&quot;, identifying it not as the moment where they acquired superpowers but instead as the moment of their decision to use their powers to do good.

==Other appearances==
* As an epilogue to the Chris King/Vicki Grant &quot;Dial H&quot; series, &quot;The New Adventures of Superboy&quot; #50 features a story in which Chris King&#x27;s watch is stolen from the Space Museum of the Legion of Super-Heroes&#x27; time period by a thief named Nylor Truggs, who flees with the dial to the ambiguous late 1960s/early 1970s era-Smallville of the original (Earth-One) Superboy by altering the dial&#x27;s functions in some unexplained manner, allowing him to travel in time. Truggs further alters the H-dial to break the restriction that users can only transform into heroic identities, changing the &quot;H&quot; in the center of the dial to &quot;V&quot; for &quot;villain&quot;. Truggs also makes the dial capable of changing individuals other than himself into villains if he desires; those transformed would then be under Truggs&#x27; control. Truggs transforms several of Clark Kent&#x27;s high school friends, and forms a temporary alliance with a teenaged Lex Luthor, in a scheme to plant seismic devices in their time period so that Truggs can use those devices against the people of his own future time upon his return. Truggs&#x27; plan is foiled by Superboy, several members of the Legion, and Krypto the Superdog, the latter of which destroys the stolen H-Dial by crushing it in his jaws. Vicki Grant&#x27;s H-Dial is also shown to have survived to the Legion&#x27;s time—it is slated to replace King&#x27;s dial in the museum display. As this story was published before the events of the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; (which erased the Earth-One Superboy from continuity) and the subsequent rebootings of the Legion of Super-Heroes&#x27; history, it is unlikely that any elements of this story exist in current continuity.
* In &quot;Legionnaires&quot; #69, Lori Morning uses an H-dial that was given to her by the Time Trapper to gain superpowers, and becomes a member of Workforce. Lori gives the H-dial to Brainiac 5.1 to use against the Rift; the device is destroyed in the process. This timeline was also erased in the Legion reboot.
* In a &quot;One Year Later&quot; storyline, the H-Dial comes into the possession of Father Time, who hopes to clone the device and create an entire army of &quot;one man Justice Leagues&quot;. However the device is stolen, and Johnny Mimic (the reformed Green Lantern villain called to act as a profiler) dupes Alan Scott into killing him while holding the device, destroying it for good.
* In &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #9 (February 2008), Robby Reed teamed up with the Metal Men, even lending the dial to Tin to allow him to transform into a more resilient superhero to defeat the monster conjured by the deranged alchemist Megistus. The dial, due to its transformative abilities, bore an optional part in Megistus&#x27; plans to draw the storm that brought about the genesis of Red Kryptonite upon Earth, warping it as to protect it from the events of the &quot;Final Crisis&quot;. Dial H appeared again in issue #27 of the same series, this time in a team-up with Batman. While staying at a hotel in Gotham City, Robby uses the dial to see the future but realizing that something will kill him while using the dial he decided to let the dial be stolen by a down on his luck young man named Travers Milton. After using the Dial to transform into a Superman-esque flying hero named the Star, Travers assists Batman in defending Gotham after the Joker arranges a series of violent crimes to be committed throughout the city in order to break Batman. After discovering that the final challenge for Batman is a remote-controlled bomb placed over a group of bound and gagged men and women, Travers heroically sacrifices his life by flying out into the night sky while clutching the bomb, saving Batman and the hostages seconds before it detonates. Afterwards, Batman returns the H-Dial to Robby who refused it because even though it prevents his eventual fate he didn&#x27;t want to let it affect to anyone else but Batman tells him that it gave Travers what he had always wanted; the chance to be a hero that Robby will do the same thing. There is no indication given as to where either of the &quot;Brave &amp; the Bold&quot; stories fit into Robby Reed&#x27;s personal timeline however.
* In &quot;&quot;, the H-Dial made a brief appearance when all time periods meld together. A hand can be seen barely clutching it.
* In the &quot;Watchmen&quot; sequel &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Robby Reed&#x27;s Human Starfish form is among the superheroes that confront Doctor Manhattan on Mars.
* Miguel Montez and Summer Pickens appear in the Wonder Comics series &quot;Young Justice&quot; issues #12-15 (March–August 2020). They also make a non-speaking appearance on the final page of the series, in issue #20 (January 2021).
* Miguel Montez is a recurring background character in the 2021–22 series &quot;Teen Titans Academy&quot;, where he shares a dorm room with Billy Batson.

==In other media==
===Miscellaneous===
* An alternate take on Robby Reed and &quot;Dial H For Hero&quot; was used in &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; #52. This version of the character unknowingly drew his powers from other heroes who were close by. As a result of discovering his power source, Robby gave up his dial and signed up for Cyborg&#x27;s new Teen Titans Training program. His identities in the issue were Changeling (the powers came from Beast Boy), Lagoon Boy (the powers came from Aqualad), Jesse Quick (the powers came from Kid Flash), Power Boy (the powers came from Wonder Girl), and Protector (the powers came from Robin). In issue #55, Robby Reed returned in a nightmare sequence of Cyborg&#x27;s (caused by the villainous Phobia). In the dream after having had his H-Dial taken away, he joined the &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; program under the guise of Protector.
* Marv Wolfman had pitched a &quot;Dial &quot;H&quot; for Hero&quot; TV show to Hanna-Barbera alongside the Teen Titans back in the 1980s.

===Web series===
* Machinima Inc. and DC Entertainment were producing a live-action web series based on an updated version of the original concept as of May 2015. Titled &quot;#4Hero&quot;, the VFX-heavy comedy was to be about a young woman named Nellie Tribble who discovers a smartphone app that allows her to temporarily gain semi-useful superpowers dictated by whatever is trending at the moment. The series status is unknown since their project wasn&#x27;t released yet.

==In popular culture==
* Dial B for Blog is an extensive, popular comics blog run by Kirk Kimball, who blogs under the name &quot;Robby Reed&quot;.
* &quot;Dial M for Monkey&quot; was a segment on &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; in which Dexter&#x27;s lab monkey would become the superhero Monkey whenever there was trouble, with Dexter unaware of this.
* In the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game&quot;, there is a set of cards that pay homage to this comic: H-Heated Heart, E-Emergency Call, R-Righteous Justice, O-Oversoul. The card HERO Flash uses these four cards to allow Elemental Hero normal Monsters to attack the opponent directly.
* In &quot;Simpsons Super Spectacular&quot; #12, there is a story called &quot;Dial M for Milhouse&quot; that parodies &quot;Dial H for Hero&quot;. In the story, Houseboy gets a phone that allows him to transform into various superheroes, but he goes power-mad and Bartman ends up trying to stop him. The identities he assumes include Flasherdasher, Electroshock, Capybara Man, the Falconator, Campfire Kid, Batboy, Rubber Lad and Forkupine Radioactive Boy, Bug Boy, Plasmo, Lure Lad, Purple Badge of Courage, Weasel Boy and Captain Squad.

<text>Netcraft is an Internet services company based in London, England. The company provides cybercrime disruption services across a range of industries. 

==History==
Netcraft was founded by Mike Prettejohn in Bath, Somerset. The company provides web server and web hosting market-share analysis, including web server and operating system detection. In some cases, depending on the queried server&#x27;s operating system, their service is able to monitor uptimes; uptime performance monitoring is a commonly used factor in determining the reliability of a web hosting provider.

The company is also known for its free anti-phishing toolbar for the Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Chrome browsers. Starting with version 9.5, the built-in anti-phishing filter in the Opera browser uses the same data as Netcraft&#x27;s toolbar, eliminating the need for a separately installed toolbar. A study commissioned by Microsoft concluded that Netcraft&#x27;s toolbar was among the most effective tools to combat phishing on the Internet, although this has since been superseded by Microsoft&#x27;s own Internet Explorer 7 with Microsoft Phishing Filter, possibly as a result of licensing Netcraft&#x27;s data. The service can only process public IPv4 servers at the exclusion of IPv6. The browser extensions will display security information for a domain&#x27;s IPv4 servers even when the user is connected to a different server over IPv6.

In November 2016, Philip Hammond, Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced plans for the UK government to work with Netcraft to develop better automatic defences to reduce the impact of cyber-attacks affecting the UK. As of 2022, Netcraft operated the UK government’s National Cyber Security Centre malicious website takedown service.

In 2023, Netcraft secured growth investment of $100 million from Spectrum Equity Management and appointed a new chief executive, Ryan Woodley. It also moved its headquarters from Bath to London. In September 2023, Netcraft announced the acquisition of Australian internet security analysts FraudWatch International, who have 70 staff.

In 2024, Netcraft released its innovative approach to combating online fraud. By leveraging its AI platform, Netcraft creates decoys to lure scammers, allowing it to monitor and analyze their tactics in real-time. This method enhances their ability to detect and counteract fraudulent activities, improving online security and safeguarding users.

<doc id="739379" wikidata="Q978114" url="?curid=739379" title="Zhang Dali">
<text>Zhang Dali (, born 1963, in Harbin, China) is an artist based in Beijing.

Zhang trained at the Central Academy of Fine Arts and Design, where he graduated in 1987. After his studies, he moved to Yuanmingyuan as a freelance artist (1987–1989) and started to show his works in independent exhibitions. He spent the years 1990–1995 in Italy, where he came into contact with graffiti art. He was the only graffiti artist in Beijing throughout the 1990s. His works cross a multitude of techniques including painting, sculpture, photography, and installations. In the four decades of his career his works were shown in more than 300 exhibitions all over the world.

==Biography==
From 1995 to 1998 he spray-painted over 2000 giant profiles of his own bald head on buildings throughout Beijing, placing the images alongside chāi () characters painted by the city authorities to indicate that a building is scheduled for demolition. The appearance of these images became the subject of media debate in Beijing in 1998.

He has shown work internationally in many exhibitions including the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, International Center for Photography in New York City, Les Rencontres d&#x27;Arles festival in France (2010), 18Gallery in Shanghai, Magda Danysz Gallery in Paris, Courtyard Gallery in Beijing, Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, Kunstnernes Hus in Oslo, the 2006 Gwangju Biennale in Korea and Pékin Fine Arts in Beijing. He is represented by Pékin Fine Arts in Beijing, Kiang Gallery in Atlanta, Klein Sun Gallery in New York City and Base Gallery in Tokyo.

In more recent years, his works were shown in large retrospective exhibitions such as: &quot;From Reality to Extreme Reality&quot; at the United Art Museum in Wuhan (2015), &quot;Body and Soul&quot; at Beelden aan Zee in The Hague (2017), &quot;Meta-morphosis&quot; at Palazzo Fava in Bologna (2018).

== Main works ==

=== Human World Red, Black, and White Series ===
These paintings in red, black and white are executed with oil colors, typical of western art, but on vertical paper with the dimensions and shapes, typical of Chinese traditional scroll painting. The subject is figurative, precise elements can be recognized, but at the same time not realistic. It seems like the representation of a dream, of a spiritual aspiration, of harmony between the natural and human worlds. The well-defined lines and the choice of colors refer to graphic art, which was also an essential part of Zhang&#x27;s curriculum at the academy.

This series of oil on paper paintings are representative of Zhang Dali&#x27;s last university years (1986–1987) and of his search for contamination between eastern and western art. Zhang Dali has already decided that he wants to be a “contemporary artist” and not a Chinese traditional painting artist. The education he received at the Central Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Beijing includes the study of European and Chinese classic art, and the study of the most influential movements of western art in the twentieth century, from Bauhaus to Pop Art.&quot; Formally, I have been deeply influenced by Wu Guanzhong. I was shocked the first time I saw Wu’s paintings, he used red to paint green trees. We were all shocked and thought he was colorblind. We told him the tree was green and he replied: “The tree is green, but can’t we paint it with other colors? You should paint with the color that expresses your inner most feelings.” It was then that I realized that the portrayal of natural setting landscapes and objects didn’t have to correspond to their actual form but could refer to my inner emotions. &quot;

=== Dialogue and Demolition ===
Zhang Dali&#x27;s encounter with graffiti first occurred in Europe. From 1989 to 1995, while he was living in Bologna, graffiti art presented itself as a means of dialogue between the artist and the people moving in the urban landscape. His first graffiti were painted in Bologna, and other European cities: Vienna, Ljubljana, Berlin. After returning to China in 1995, he witnessed the demolition of old alleys and neighborhoods, the forced relocation of the inhabitants and the propaganda to convince the citizens that “modernization” is good and necessary. He then started to wander the streets by night, on his bicycle with a spray can, leaving on the walls condemned to demolition a head profile and his signature AK-47 and 18K.

In a project that will last a decade, Zhang Dali not only establishes a dialogue with the city&#x27;s inhabitants, he also asks questions about the legitimacy of modernization, about the costs for the historical and cultural heritage, and the price of physical and psychological suffering. His graffiti were the spark which became a great conflagration in the public debate on the significance, modes and finality of urban modernization. With his graffiti, Zhang Dali turned into a public intellectual renown in China and all over the world. &quot; Urban expansion and its ambiguous spread fill us with excitement, unease and disquiet. Each and every corner of the city is a chaotic mess. Mounds of garbage are piling up and people eat, shit and sleep amongst the refuse. Children look for toys in the debris. River water runs ink black and stinks like hell, while plastic bags hang from tree branches and play catch on the grass, nodding and waving in the breeze like severed heads and hands. Men in pressing business suits enter the main gates of fancy hotels, while rivers of filth run from the hotels’ rear. &quot;

=== AK-47 ===
AK-47 is the name of an automatic rifle designed by Michail Kalashnikov, from whose name comes the abbreviation of AK (Avtomat Kalashnikova) and was produced for the first time in the Soviet Union in 1947. All over the world, the name AK-47 has become a symbol of wars, insurrections and gang criminality. Zhang Dali started to use this tag during the nineties in his graffiti as a synonym of the violence permeating the fast urbanization process.

From the year 2000, he started a series of portraits emerging from the chromatic contrast of &quot;AK-47&quot;s&#x27; shades. The paintings are acrylic on vinyl, a material widely used for advertisement boards, a feature becoming an integral part of the Beijing’s urban landscape in those years. The faces are copied from portrait photos Zhang Dali found in a pile of abandoned photo studio archives, sold in bulk at the flea market. The acronym is not painted on the faces, but it is used to portray the faces themselves: violence is not “on” people, it is the very material with which people are made of, not a washable coating, but integral part and connecting tissue of their existence.

=== Slogan ===
This is a series of portraits emerging from the repetition and color shade contrast of Chinese characters, similar to the &quot;AK-47&quot;, but now belonging to the slogans. In the year preceding the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, the capital was invaded by gigantic banners and boards of government propaganda slogans. Even though this feature has always been a part of Chinese urban and rural landscapes, so much so to become invisible to the passer-by eyes, in 2008 their presence was so ubiquitous to make Zhang Dali ponder on their meaning and on the subtle message implanted in people&#x27;s head. &quot; In 2000 I started the series AK-47. At the time I thought I was expressing the violence to which people are subjected to in society because of inequality. The Slogan series is a continuation of AK-47, and it is also the result of my observation of our own surrounding society. Our era is full of dramatic events and fast changes, in the main avenues and narrow alleys slogans are pervasive and ever changing. These slogans are standard sentences taken from government documents that have come to dominate our public space. Their aim is to educate us, tell us how we must behave just like a parent talking to an elementary school child – in the same way the parents of the People lecture their immature children. &quot;

=== Chinese Offspring ===
Zhang Dali&#x27;s research on human bodies as a collective depository of an era continues in this series of sculptures, cast in fiberglass from migrant workers. From 2004 to 2010, he has reproduced the bodies of farmers coming into the city in search of work; they became the document of both a specific period in the history of urbanization and a migration of unimaginable proportion. From the first exhibitions, the sculptures were hung upside down, to express the absence of control these people have on their lives. The name &quot;Chinese Offspring&quot; demands us to reflect on the present condition of a People who had lost the values of the wise men and heroes of the past, a People reduced to a sub-human state, cogs in a machine on which they have no control on, lacking ideals and without a purpose that goes beyond daily subsistence.

=== A Second History ===
&quot;A Second History&quot; was created in a seven-year span, from 2004 to 2011. Zhang Dali poses questions about the influence of new technologies on the visual mass culture and as a form of exercised power. The research on the history of image manipulation takes him to collecting thousands of illustrated volumes, magazines, and newspapers from the years 1950s to 1980s. He had access to the archives of some of the most known state publication houses, where he compared negative films and images published in those years.

This work consists of the archive created by Zhang Dali after seven years of researching and cataloging. It is made of 133 panels, each comparing images as published with different manipulations and/or their original negative. Image manipulation was born with photography itself. All over the world images are manipulated, in China such practices have been particularly pervasive since the foundation of the People&#x27;s Republic and is exposed in this work in its political and aesthetical significance.

=== World&#x27;s Shadows ===
The cyanotype is a type of photogram, a photo produced without a camera. It was invented by John Herschel in 1842 and quickly abandoned in favor of other more sophisticated photographic techniques. The characteristics of the cyanotype attract Zhang Dali for two reasons: it can not be altered or manipulated; it captures the image in a specific instant and it cannot be reproduced. The object and its shadow constitute an intrinsically bound couple and only in a precise instant. Zhang Dali has experimented with large size cyanotypes covering subjects such as natural landscapes, vegetations, and human bodies. This is one of the techniques the artist is still expanding and combining other materials. &quot; Shadows are very intriguing and differ greatly in form. Besides shadows’ ability to prove existence of material objects, shadows also carry their own intrinsic value and existence, not only as a reproduction or copy of the world of material things, but also as a type of “anti-matter” marking the space material objects occupy under the sun.&quot;

&quot;The material world shapes and controls our nervous system, and can make us feel agitated and troubled. When we keep calm and quiet we realize that the world under our control is only a small part of the universe, certainly not the whole. The shadows I document exist only for a very short time but through the photogram technique I capture them, so they can exist for a much longer time, in front of our eyes, and under our gaze. &quot;

=== Permanence ===
These sculptures in white marble (&quot;hanbaiyu&quot;) created in 2015 and 2016, represent a new stage of research and elaboration on the relevance of the human body as representative of a society and its dominant ideology. Bodies of common people, migrant laborers are shown to the public as classical statues made of marble, material associated to deities and heroes of the past.

In this new form, they transmigrate from impermanence to permanence, at the same time detaching from their daily reality of ignorance and suffering. Zhang Dali captures the spark of eternity presented in the life of each and every person. It is not the appanage granted to royals and nobles, Sublimity exists in everyone and transforms the bodies into monuments.

<text>Bremen-Verden, formally the Duchies of Bremen and Verden (; ), were two territories and immediate fiefs of the Holy Roman Empire, which emerged and gained imperial immediacy in 1180. By their original constitution they were prince-bishoprics of the Archdiocese of Bremen and Bishopric of Verden.

In 1648, both prince-bishoprics were secularised, meaning that they were transformed into hereditary monarchies by constitution, and from then on both the Duchy of Bremen and the Duchy of Verden were always ruled in personal union, initially by the royal houses of Sweden, the House of Vasa and the House of Palatinate-Zweibrücken, and later by the House of Hanover.

With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Bremen-Verden&#x27;s status as fiefs of imperial immediacy became void; as they had been in personal union with the neighbouring Kingdom of Hanover, they were incorporated into that state.

==Territory and insignia==

The territory belonging to the Duchies of Bremen and Verden covered a rough triangle of land between the mouths of the rivers Elbe and Weser on the North Sea, in today&#x27;s German federal states of Hamburg and Bremen (the Elbe-Weser Triangle). This area included most of the modern counties (German singular: &quot;Kreis&quot;) of Cuxhaven (southerly), Osterholz, Rotenburg upon Wümme, Stade and Verden, now in Lower Saxony; and the city of Bremerhaven, now an exclave of the State of Bremen. The city of Bremen and Cuxhaven (an exclave of Hamburg) did not belong to Bremen-Verden. The Land of Hadeln, then an exclave of Saxe-Lauenburg exclave around Otterndorf, was not part of Bremen-Verden until 1731. Stade was the capital.

Bremen-Verden&#x27;s coat of arms combined the arms of the Prince-Bishopric of Verden, a black cross on white ground, with those of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, two keys crossed &quot;Bremen-Verden&#x27;s&quot; seal), the symbol of Simon Petrus, the patron saint of Bremen.

==History==
At the beginning of the Thirty Years&#x27; War the predominantly Lutheran Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen maintained neutrality, as did most of the Protestant territories in the Lower Saxon Circle, a fiscal and military subsection of the Holy Roman Empire. The neighbouring Prince-Bishopric of Verden also tried to maintain neutrality, but, being part of the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle, which was troubled by confrontation between Calvinist, Catholic and Lutheran rulers and their territories, Verden soon became involved in the war.

In 1623 Verden&#x27;s cathedral chapter, consisting mainly of Lutheran capitulars, elected Frederick II, Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Verden to be the ruler of the bishopric. Since he was Lutheran, the Holy See denied him the title of bishop. Nevertheless, he and later administrators were often referred to as prince-bishops. Frederick II was a son of King Christian IV of Denmark and Norway.

In 1626, Christian IV, who was also Duke of Holstein, and thus a vassal of the Emperor, joined the anti-imperial coalition of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands and the Kingdom of England under James I. After Christian IV was defeated at the Battle of Lutter am Barenberge, on 27 August 1626, by the troops of the Catholic League under Johan &#x27;t Serclaes, Count of Tilly, he and his remaining troops fled to the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen and set up headquarters in Stade. Administrator John Frederick, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, who was also Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck, fled to Lübeck and left the Prince-Archbishopric to be ruled by the Chapter and the Estates.

In 1626, Tilly and his Catholic League troops occupied Verden, causing the Lutheran clergy to flee. He demanded that the Chapter of Bremen allow him to enter the Prince-Archbishopric and while the Chapter declared its loyalty to the Emperor, it delayed an answer to the request, arguing that it had to consult in a diet with the Estates, which would be a lengthy procedure.

Meanwhile, Christian IV arranged for Dutch, English and French troops to land in Bremen. The Chapter&#x27;s pleas for a reduction of the contributions, Christian IV commented by arguing once the Leaguists would take over, his extortions will seem little.

In 1627, Christian IV withdrew from the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, in order to fight Wallenstein&#x27;s invasion of his Duchy of Holstein. Tilly then invaded Bremen and captured its southern parts. The city of Bremen shut its city gates and entrenched behind its improved fortifications. In 1628, Tilly besieged Stade with its remaining garrison of 3,500 Danish and English soldiers. On 5 May 1628 Tilly granted them safe-conduct to England and Denmark-Norway and the whole of ecclesiastical Bremen was in his hands. Now Tilly turned to the city of Bremen, which paid him a ransom of 10,000 rixdollars in order to save itself from a siege. The city remained unoccupied.

The populations in both prince-bishoprics were subjected to measures of &quot;re-Catholicisation&quot; within the scope the Counter-Reformation, with Lutheran services suppressed and Lutheran pastors expelled. In July 1630, Tilly and most of the Catholic occupants were withdrawn, since on 26 June Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden had landed with 15,000 soldiers at Peenemünde, opening a new front in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. He had been won by French diplomacy to join a new anti-imperial coalition, soon also joined by the United Netherlands.

In February 1631 John Frederick, the exiled Lutheran administrator of the Prince-Archbishoprics of Bremen and Lübeck conferred with Gustavus II Adolphus and a number of Lower Saxon princes in Leipzig, all of them troubled by Habsburg&#x27;s growing influence wielded by virtue of the Edict of Restitution in a number of Northern German Lutheran prince-bishoprics. John Frederick speculated to regain the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen and therefore in June/July 1631 officially allied himself with Sweden. For the war being John Frederick accepted Swedish overlordship, while Gustavus Adolphus promised to restitute the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen to its exiled elected Administrator.

In October, an army newly recruited by John Frederick started to reconquer the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen and — supported by Swedish troops — to capture the neighboured Prince-Bishopric of Verden, de facto dismissing Verden&#x27;s intermittent Catholic Prince-Bishop Francis of Wartenberg who ruled 1630–1631, and causing the flight of the Catholic clergy wherever they arrived. The Prince-Bishopric of Verden was then subjected to Swedish military administration.

The reconquest of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, helped by forces from Sweden and from the city of Bremen, was completed by 10 May 1632. John Frederick was back in his office, only to realise what Swedish supremacy meant. The Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen continuously suffered from billeting and alimenting soldiers. The relation between the Estates, who had to maintain administration under Catholic occupation, and the returned Administrator were difficult. The Estates preferred to directly negotiate with the occupants, this time the Swedes.

After John Frederick&#x27;s death in 1634 Chapter and Estates regarded the dismissal of the Danish Prince Frederick as coadjutor bishop by Emperor Ferdinand II by virtue of the Edict of Restitution illegitimate. But the Swedish occupants had to be persuaded first, to accept Prince Frederick&#x27;s succession. So Chapter and Estates ruled the Prince-Archbishopric until the conclusion of the negotiations with Sweden. In 1635, he succeeded as Lutheran Administrator Frederick II in the sees of Bremen and of Verden. But he had to render homage to the minor Queen Christina of Sweden.

In 1635–1636 the Estates and Frederick II agreed with Sweden upon the prince-bishoprics&#x27; neutrality. But this didn&#x27;t last long, because in the Danish-Swedish Torstenson War of 1643–1645 the Swedes seized de facto rule in both prince-bishoprics. Christian IV of Denmark and Norway had to sign the Second Peace of Brömsebro on 13 August 1645, and a number of Danish territories, including the two Swedish occupied prince-bishoprics, were ceded into Swedish hands. So Frederick II had to resign as Administrator in both prince-bishoprics. He succeeded his late father on the Danish throne as Frederick III of Denmark in 1648.

With the impending enfeoffment of the military great power of Sweden with the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, as under negotiation for the Treaty of Westphalia, the city of Bremen feared falling under Swedish rule as well. Therefore, the city beseeched an imperial confirmation of its status of imperial immediacy from 1186 (). In 1646 Emperor Ferdinand III granted the Free Imperial City of Bremen the requested confirmation ().

===Transformation of prince-bishoprics into Bremen-Verden in 1648===
The political entities of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen and the Prince-Bishopric of Verden were transformed by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 into the &quot;Duchy of Bremen&quot; and the &quot;Principality of Verden&quot;, however, colloquially the Duchies of Bremen and Verden, without changing the territories&#x27; status of imperial immediacy and imperial estate. Every imperial estate, thus Bremen and Verden separately, was represented in the Diet () of the Holy Roman Empire. The formerly Free Imperial City of Verden upon Aller was mediatised by the Peace of Westphalia and incorporated into the Duchy of Verden.

The two neighbouring territories could not unite in a real union without finding support by the emperor and a majority among the imperial estates, which never happened. They were parts of two different imperial circles. From 1500 on the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen and thus its successor Duchy of Bremen belonged to the Saxon Circle (later the Lower Saxon Circle; ), a fiscal and military substructure of the Empire. The Prince-Bishopric of Verden and thus its successor, the Duchy of Verden, on the other hand, belonged to the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle (, colloquially Westphalian Circle).

The Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s taxes were collected and armies recruited and financed along the lines of the imperial circles. Bremen and Verden sent their representatives to the circle diet (Kreistag) of their respective imperial circle. The circle diet decided how to share the burden of the taxes to be levied among the member territories. Thus Bremen and Verden even conflicted on the border between each other — i.e. on who may levy taxes where — which were not solved, even though the two fiefs were ruled in personal union by Sweden.

Emperor Ferdinand III at first enfeoffed the Queen regnant Christina of Sweden and her legal heirs with the duchies, as Sweden&#x27;s reward from its participation in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Bremen-Verden provided Sweden a strategic advantage, because it would participate with them in recruiting and financing armies in two imperial circles already covering all of the northern and north-western parts of the Holy Roman Empire, with Swedish Pomerania, a member in the Upper Saxon Circle, covering the Empire&#x27;s North East.

===Personal union with Sweden (1648–1712) and under Danish occupation (1712–1715)===
The Swedes installed a new authority, &quot;Bremen-Verden&#x27;s General Government&quot; (), and chose Stade to be the new seat of government, with Bremervörde being the former Bremian capital, and Rotenburg upon Wümme being the former capital of the Prince-Bishopric of Verden.

The Swedish takeover in 1648 became a milestone for Bremen-Verden&#x27;s interior constitution. Bremen-Verden turned from two elective monarchies into a hereditary double monarchy, with a personal rule of the or administrator exchanged for a viceregent government bound by Swedish instructions. The lax administrative structures were replaced with strictly hierarchic authorities with fixed competences. The co-rule of the Estates was curtailed. Bremen and Verden declined from independent territories of imperial immediacy to a collectively governed dominion of a European great power with all the pertaining restrictions and opportunities.

For her new fief, the Duchy of Bremen, the Queen regnant Christina of Sweden, ruling from 1644 to 1654, from 1648 on simultaneously Duchess of Bremen and Verden, sought after annexing the Free Imperial City of Bremen for it would be an important taxpayer. Earlier the city of Bremen had de facto participated in the Diets of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. The latter&#x27;s successor state, the Swedish Duchy of Bremen, tried to regain the city, arguing the Treaty of Westphalia named the city of Bremen as part of the to-be-established Duchy.

As Duchess of Bremen and Verden Christina of Sweden installed her residence in the former Benedictine . She abolished witch-burning in Bremen-Verden. In 1650 Charles Gustav, Hereditary Duke of the Palatinate of Zweibrücken-Kleeburg, since 1649 declared and 1650 recognised heir to the Swedish throne and thereby simultaneously to Bremen-Verden&#x27;s dukedoms, came to Stade for interlocutions of unknown content. In 1650 the Lutheran clergy was subjected to a consistory, the new leading body after there was no Prince-Archbishop or Prince-Bishop anymore.

As to pastoring the tiny Catholic diaspora in Bremen-Verden the Holy See established apostolic vicariates (Vicariate of Nordic Missions, competent for Verden and Bremen since 1669 and 1670, respectively, until 1721, and again between 1780 and 1824, Vicariate of Upper and Lower Saxony, in charge between 1721 and 1780).

 Bremen-Verden&#x27;s Swedish government tried to militarily defeat the Free Imperial City of Bremen, provoking two wars. In 1381 the city of Bremen had captured de facto rule in an area around Bederkesa and westwards thereof up to the lower Weser stream near Lehe (aka Bremerlehe). Early in 1653 Bremen-Verden&#x27;s Swedish troops captured Lehe. In February 1654 the city of Bremen achieved that the Emperor granted it a seat and the vote in the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s Diet, thus accepting the city&#x27;s status as Free Imperial City.

Ferdinand III ordered Queen Christina of Sweden, who was his vassal as Duchess, to compensate the city for the damages caused and to restitute Lehe. When in March 1654, the city started to recruit soldiers in the area of Bederkesa, in order to prepare for further arbitrary acts by Swedish Bremen-Verden, the latter&#x27;s governor general, Hans Christoffer von Königsmarck enacted the First Bremian War (March to July 1654), arguing to act in self-defence. The Free Imperial City of Bremen had meanwhile urged Ferdinand III for support.
In July 1654, the emperor ordered his vassal, as duke, Charles X Gustav of Sweden, who had succeeded Christina after her abdication, to cease the conflict, which resulted in the in November 1654. This treaty left the main issue, accepting the city of Bremen&#x27;s imperial immediacy, unresolved. But the city agreed to pay tribute and levy taxes in favour of and cede its possessions around Bederkesa and Lehe to Swedish Bremen-Verden.

Sweden and Swedish Bremen-Verden protested sharply, when in December 1660 the city council of Bremen rendered homage to Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1663, the city gained seat and vote in the Imperial Diet, strongly opposed by the representatives of the Swedish Duchies of Bremen and Verden therein. In March 1664, the Swedish Diet came out in favour of waging war on the Free Imperial City of Bremen. Right after, Leopold I, busy with wars against the Ottoman Empire, had enfeoffed the minor King Charles XI of Sweden with Bremen-Verden, and with the neighbouring Brunswick and Lunenburg (Celle line) being paralysed by succession quarrels and France being not opposed, Sweden started from its Bremen-Verden the Second Bremian War (1665–1666).

The siege of the city by the Swedes under Carl Gustaf Wrangel brought Brandenburg-Prussia, Brunswick and Lunenburg (Celle), Denmark-Norway, Leopold I and the United Netherlands to the scene, all in favour of the city, with Brandenburgian, Brunswickian, Danish and Dutch troops at Bremen-Verden&#x27;s borders ready to invade. So Sweden had to sign on 15 November 1666 the Treaty of Habenhausen, obliging it to destroy the fortresses built close to Bremen while banning the Free City of Bremen from sending its representative to the Diet of the Lower Saxon Circle. From Bremen-Verden, no further Swedish attempts to violently capture the city sprang out. Asked in 1700 what to do by Charles XII of Sweden, Bremen-Verden&#x27;s General Government recommended to concede Bremen&#x27;s status as a Free Imperial City.

 A Danish attempt to conquer Bremen-Verden during the Dano-Swedish War (1657–1658) failed. But the Danish threat to Bremen-Verden turned more virulent in 1667. In that year the local branch of the House of Oldenburg ruling in the County of Oldenburg, adjacent to Bremen-Verden&#x27;s western border, died out with Anton Günther, Count of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst. Therefore, Christian Albert, Duke of Schleswig and Holstein at Gottorp inherited the county, but ceded it to his father-in-law Frederick III, King of Denmark and Norway, Administrator of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen and the Prince-Bishopric of Verden from 1635 until he had been expelled by the Swedish occupants in 1645.

So the Danes ruled territories clung around Bremen-Verden at its northern and western border. Both powers entered into a dangerous competition for the exclusive opportunity to levy the lucrative tolls from ships heading for Hamburg and Bremen, with the former at that time being a ducal Bremian and the latter a comital Oldenburgian privilege.

After a stay in Hamburg (1666–1668) with the administrators of her Swedish estates, and his son , in order to reorganise her revenues, in 1668 Christina of Sweden (after her Catholic conversion in 1655 Christina Alexandra), stopped by in Stade on her way home to Rome.

The rise of Swedish centralisation and absolutism found its way partially into Bremen-Verden&#x27;s practise. Bremen-Verden wasn&#x27;t streamlined as to its jurisdiction and its military system, but the latter strictly subjected to Stockholms generalty. Especially in jurisdiction, Bremen-Verden&#x27;s Estates maintained their stake. But Bremen-Verden&#x27;s tax-levying department, almost entirely manned with Swedes and using Swedish as administrative language, was directly subordinated to the finance ministry in Stockholm.

From 1675 to 1676, troops from Brandenburg-Prussia, Lüneburg-Celle, Denmark-Norway, and the Prince-Bishopric of Münster captured Bremen-Verden in the course of a &quot;Reichsexekution&quot; during the Scanian War. The allied forces occupied Bremen-Verden, until they withdrew — under French influence — according to the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye of 1679 and the favourable Treaty of Celle. By the latter Baron , the Prince-Bishop of Münster, granted Sweden a loan amounting to 100,000 rixdollars, for which in return Swedish Bremen-Verden had to pawn its exclave of the town of Wildeshausen and the pertaining adjacence to the Prince-Bishopric of Münster. In the 1690s, the usual practise, that tax laws had a certain maturity, was abolished, so that the Swedish and Bremen-Verden&#x27;s Estates had no chance any more to demand any concessions in return for a renewal of tax laws.

As in Sweden proper, the constitutional and administrative bodies in the Swedish dominions gradually lost de facto importance due to ever growing centralisation. Bremen-Verden&#x27;s Estates lost more and more influence, they less and less often convened. After 1692, the estates&#x27; say had almost vanished. This led to considerable unease among the Estates, so that in May 1694 representatives of the General Government of Bremen-Verden and the Estates met at the former convent of Zeven to confer on the status of the Duchies.

In 1700, Bremen-Verden introduced — like all Protestant territories of imperial immediacy — the Improved Calendar, as it was called by Protestants, in order not to mention the name of Pope Gregory XIII. So Sunday 18 February, Old Style, was followed by Monday 1 March, New Style, while Sweden proper only followed suit in 1753.

In 1712, in the course of the Great Northern War (1700–1721) against the Swedish supremacy in the Baltic, Denmark-Norway occupied plague stricken Bremen-Verden.

===Personal union with Great Britain and Hanover (1715–1803)===
In 1715, Frederick IV of Denmark, still fighting in the Great Northern War, gained a new ally in the anti-Swedish coalition, George I, King of Great Britain since 1714, and Elector of Hanover. In return for George I&#x27;s aid, Denmark-Norway sold to him Bremen-Verden, which it kept under occupation since 1712. So the Prince-Electorate of Brunswick and Lunenburg, or colloquially called after its capital, the Electorate of Hanover; () took de facto possession of Bremen-Verden and stipulated in the Treaty of Stockholm of 1719, settling the war with Sweden, to compensate the latter by 1 million rixdollars. 

In 1728, Emperor Charles VI enfeoffed George II Augustus, who in 1727 had succeeded his father George I Louis, with the reverted fief of Saxe-Lauenburg. By a redeployment of Hanoverian territories in 1731, Bremen-Verden was conveyed the administration of the neighboured Land of Hadeln at the Northern tip of Bremen-Verden, since 1180 an exclave, first of the younger Duchy of Saxony and from 1296 on of the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg. It took George II until 1733 to get the emperor to also enfeoff him with the Duchies of Bremen and Verden.

At both feoffments George II of Great Britain swore that he would respect the existing privileges and constitutions of the Estates in Bremen-Verden and in Hadeln, thus confirming 400-year-old traditions of Estate participation in their governments. Being a Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire and represented in its Diet by virtue of his Electorate of Hanover, George II Augustus didn&#x27;t bother about Bremen-Verden&#x27;s status of imperial estate. Since Bremen-Verden had turned Hanoverian, it never again sent its own representatives to a Diet.

In 1730, Bremen-Verden&#x27;s government was reorganised and retitled as &quot;Royal British and Electoral Brunswick-Lunenburgian Privy Council for Governing the Duchies of Bremen and Verden&quot;, which colloquially turned into the &quot;Royal Government&quot;. Stade remained the capital. In Hanover, the electoral capital, the Privy Council of Hanover installed a new ministry in charge of the Imperial Estates ruled in personal union by the electors, it was called the &quot;Department of Bremen-Verden, Hadeln, Lauenburg and Bentheim&quot;.

 In the course of the Anglo-French and Indian War (1754–1763) in the North American colonies, Britain feared a French Invasion of Hanover. Thus George II formed an alliance with his cousin Frederick II of Brandenburg-Prussia, combining the North American conflict with the Austro–Brandenburg-Prussian Third Silesian or Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763).

In the summer of 1757, the French invaders defeated Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, son of George II and leading the Anglo-Hanoverian army. The French troops drove him and his army into remote Bremen-Verden, where in the former convent of Zeven he had to capitulate on 18 September with the Convention of Klosterzeven. But King George II denied his recognition of the convention. In the following year, the British army, supported by troops from Brandenburg-Prussia, Hesse-Kassel and the Principality of Brunswick and Lunenburg (Wolfenbüttel) expelled again the occupants. Bremen-Verden remained unaffected for the rest of the war and after its end peace prevailed until the French Revolutionary Wars started.

The War of the First Coalition against France (1793–1797) with Britain and the Hanover Electorate and other war allies forming the coalition, didn&#x27;t affect Bremen-Verden&#x27;s territory, since the French First Republic was fighting on several fronts, even on its own territory. But also in Bremen-Verden men were drafted in order to recruit the 16,000 Hanoverian soldiers fighting in the Low Countries under British command against Revolutionary France. In 1795, the Holy Roman Empire declared its neutrality, which of course included the British Electorate of Hanover, and a peace treaty with France was under negotiation until it failed in 1799.

By this time the War of the Second Coalition against France (1799–1802) started and Napoléon Bonaparte urged Brandenburg-Prussia to occupy Hanover. In the Treaty of Basel of 1795 which Brandenburg-Prussia and France had stipulated, Brandenburg-Prussia would ensure the neutrality of the Holy Roman Empire in all the latter&#x27;s territories north the demarcation line of the river Main, including Hanover. To this end also Hanover had to provide troops for the so-called &quot;demarcation army&quot; maintaining the armed neutrality. But in 1801, 24,000 Prussian soldiers invaded Hanover, which surrendered without a fight.

In April 1801, Brandenburg-Prussian troops arrived in Bremen-Verden&#x27;s capital of Stade and stayed there until October the same year. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland first ignored Brandenburg-Prussia&#x27;s hostility, but when Brandenburg-Prussia joined the pro-French coalition of armed &#x27;neutral&#x27; powers such as Denmark-Norway and the Russian Empire, Britain started to capture Brandenburg-Prussian sea vessels. After the Battle of Copenhagen in April 1801, the coalition fell apart and Brandenburg-Prussia withdrew its troops.

===Napoleonic wars (1803–1813)===
After Britain — without any ally — had declared war on France on 18 May 1803, French troops invaded the Electorate of Hanover on 26 May and installed — among others — two occupation companies in Bremen-Verden&#x27;s capital Stade on 18 June. According to the Convention of Artlenburg from 5 July 1803, confirming the military defeat of Hanover, the Hanoverian army was disarmed and its horses and ammunitions were handed over to the French. The Privy Council of Hanover, with minister Friedrich Franz Dieterich von Bremer holding up the Hanoverian stake, had fled to the trans-Elbian Hanoverian territory of Saxe-Lauenburg on 30 May, taking seat in Lauenburg upon Elbe. In the summer of 1803, the French occupants raised their first war contribution with 21,165 rixdollars alone levied in Bremen-Verden. In 1803, the Duchy of Bremen had 180,000 inhabitants and an area of 5,325.4 square kilometres, the Principality of Verden 1,359.7 square kilometres and 20,000 inhabitants in 1806, while Hadeln comprised 311.6 square kilometres and had about 14,000 inhabitants.

In the autumn of 1805, at the beginning of the War of the Third Coalition against France (1805–1806) the French occupational troops left Hanover in a campaign against the Archduchy of Austria (End of the &quot;First French Occupation of Hanover&quot;, 1803–1805). British, Swedish and Russian coalition forces captured Hanover, including Bremen-Verden. In December, the First French Empire, since 1804 France&#x27;s new form of government, ceded Hanover, which it didn&#x27;t hold anymore, to Brandenburg-Prussia, which captured it early in 1806. But when the Kingdom of Prussia, after it had turned against France, was defeated in the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt (11 November 1806), the Privy Council of Hanover returned from Lauenburg to Hanover City for a month, only to have to flee again from the &quot;Second French Occupation of Hanover&quot; (November 1806-January 1810), including Bremen-Verden.

In 1807 France replaced the Privy Council and the Hanoverian estates of the realm, as announced on 20 September, by its own occupational government, the &quot;Commission du Gouvernement&quot; () under Governor General , and further installed a subdelegate, Peter Christian Dodt, replacing Bremen-Verden&#x27;s deputation (decision-taking body), however, allowing Bremen-Verden&#x27;s government (executive body) to work on. Napoleon I especially confiscated the Hanoverian electoral demesnes in order to enfeoff veterans with them. He retained exclusive access to the domains and their earnings, when on 1 March 1810 he allowed his brother King Jérôme Bonaparte to incorporate Bremen-Verden into his short-lived Kingdom of Westphalia, forming its &quot;Département Nord&quot;, only to annexe Bremen-Verden to the French Empire with effect from 1 January 1811, forming the &quot;Arrondissement Stade&quot; in the &quot;Département Bouches-de-l&#x27;Elbe&quot; and several cantons in the &quot;Département Bouches-du-Weser&quot;.

===From Restitution to incorporation into Hanover in 1823===
In 1813, the Duchies of Bremen and Verden were restored to the Electorate of Hanover, which transformed into the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814. Even though Bremen-Verden&#x27;s status as a territory of imperial immediacy had become void with the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Duchies were not right away incorporated in a real union into the Hanoverian state. Since the Hanoverian monarchs had moved to London, Hanover had become a state of very conservative and backward rule, with a local government recruited from local aristocrats adding much to the preservation of outdated structures. The administrative union with Hanover only followed in 1823, when a local government reform united Bremen-Verden and Hadeln to form the High-Bailiwick of Stade, administered according to unitarian modern standards, thereby doing away with various traditional government forms of Bremen, Verden and Hadeln.

For the further history see Stade Region (1823–1977), which emerged by the establishment of the High-Bailiwick of Stade in 1823, comprising the territories of the former Duchies of Bremen and Verden and the Land of Hadeln.

<text>Roosevelt &quot;Rosey&quot; Grier (born July 14, 1932) is an American former football player, bodyguard, actor, singer, Protestant minister, and motivational speaker.

He was a college All-American football player for Penn State, and earned a place in the NCAA 100th anniversary list of 100 most influential student athletes. A professional player for 12 seasons, Grier was a member of the New York Giants and the original Fearsome Foursome of the Los Angeles Rams. He played in the Pro Bowl twice, was select All-Pro three times, and won the 1956 NFL Championship with the Giants.

After Grier&#x27;s professional sports career, he worked as a bodyguard for Senator Robert Kennedy during the 1968 presidential campaign. Grier was guarding Ethel Kennedy when Senator Kennedy was shot. Although unable to prevent the assassination, Grier took control of the gun and subdued the shooter, Sirhan Sirhan.

Grier hosted his own Los Angeles television show and made approximately 70 guest appearances on various shows during the 1960s and 1970s.

Grier became an ordained Protestant minister in 1983. He founded American Neighborhood Enterprises, a nonprofit organization that serves inner city youth. He travels as an inspirational speaker.

Among Grier&#x27;s hobbies are crocheting, knitting, needlepoint and macramé. In 1972, Grier wrote &quot;Rosey Grier&#x27;s Needlepoint for Men&quot;, a book that was published by Walker and Company on January 1, 1973.

==Early life==
Grier was born on July 14, 1932, in Cuthbert, Georgia, one of twelve children. He was named after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

== Education ==
Grier played football at Abraham Clark High School in Roselle, New Jersey, graduating in 1951.

Grier attended Penn State University, where he was a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.
He played football for Penn State, and was All-American. He was also captain of the track team.
In track, he won the IC4A and Penn Relays shot put and discus, as well as qualifying for the javelin finals, and was a Track &amp; Field All-American in 1954 and 1955.

==Professional football career==
After playing college football at Penn State University, Grier was the 31st overall pick of the 1955 NFL draft, taken in the third round by the New York Giants. He played with the Giants from 1955 through 1962, which included an NFL Championship in 1956 and five Eastern Conference titles (1956, 1958, 1959, 1961, 1962). Grier was selected for the Pro Bowl in 1956 and 1960, and was named All-Pro at defensive tackle in 1956 and 1958–1962.

After eight seasons with New York, Grier was traded in July 1963 to the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for defensive tackle John LoVetere and a high future draft pick. He was part of the &quot;Fearsome Foursome&quot;, along with Deacon Jones, Merlin Olsen, and Lamar Lundy, considered one of the best defensive lines in football history. His career ended in 1967 due to a torn Achilles tendon. Despite being the oldest member of the Fearsome Foursome, Grier is the last surviving member following the passing of Jones on June 3, 2013.

==Post-football career==
===Television===

After his retirement, Grier hosted the &quot;Rosey Grier Show&quot; on KABC-TV, a weekly half-hour television show discussing community affairs in Los Angeles.

Grier served as a bodyguard for his friend, United States senator and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy. He was guarding Ethel Kennedy, the Senator&#x27;s wife, who was then expecting a child, the night that Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles in 1968. Grier and Olympic decathlon gold medalist Rafer Johnson heard shots fired ahead of them. As Grier caught up he saw men wrestling with gunman Sirhan Sirhan. Grier jumped into the fray. Grier states, &quot;So I see George Plimpton has the gun pointed at his face, and I&#x27;m concerned that it is going to go off, so I put my hand under the trigger housing and I pulled back the hammer so it couldn&#x27;t strike. I wrench the gun from Sirhan. I find the pin and I ripped it out and held it. Now I have the gun in my hand, so I shove it in my pocket.&quot; Grier later said, &quot;I grabbed the man&#x27;s legs and dragged him onto a table. There was a guy angrily twisting the killer&#x27;s legs and other angry faces coming towards him, as though they were going to tear him to pieces. I fought them off. I would not allow more violence.&quot;

===USO===
In December 1968, Grier accompanied Bob Hope on &quot;Operation Holly,&quot; Hope&#x27;s 1968 USO tour, Grier performed alongside headliner Ann-Margret and others at the U.S. bases at Long Bình, Cam Ranh Bay, Da Nang, Chu Lai, and Phù Cát, as well as aboard the carrier USS &quot;Hancock&quot; and the battleship USS &quot;New Jersey&quot;, and at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base and U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield in Thailand, along with stops in South Korea and Guam.

<text>The Virgin New Adventures (NA series, or NAs) are a series of novels from Virgin Publishing based on the British science-fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. They continued the story of the Doctor from the point at which the television programme went into hiatus from television in 1989.

From 1991 to 1997, all the books except the final one involved the Seventh Doctor, who was portrayed on television by Sylvester McCoy; the final book, &quot;The Dying Days&quot;, involved the Eighth Doctor, who was portrayed in the 1996 television film by Paul McGann. In further books published between 1997 and 1999, the New Adventures series focused on the character Bernice Summerfield and the Doctor did not appear.

==Publication history==

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
Virgin had purchased the successful children&#x27;s imprint Target Books in 1989, with Virgin&#x27;s new fiction editor Peter Darvill-Evans taking over the range. Target&#x27;s major output was novelisations of televised &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories, and Darvill-Evans realised that there were few stories left to be novelised. He approached the BBC for permission to commission original stories written directly for print, but such a licence was initially refused. However, after the television series ended at the end of 1989, Virgin were granted the licence to produce full-length original novels continuing the story from the point at which the series had concluded.

The range, titled the &quot;New Adventures&quot;, was launched in 1991 with a series of four linked novels, beginning with &quot;&quot; by John Peel, who had previously contributed to Target&#x27;s successful range of novelisations. Of the other three initial authors, Terrance Dicks had been both a regular contributor to the television series itself and the major contributor to Target&#x27;s book range; Nigel Robinson had been Darvill-Evans&#x27; predecessor as editor of the Target books; and Paul Cornell, although new to professional publishing, had been an active contributor to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fanzine scene and was beginning a career as a television scriptwriter.

The initial four &quot;Timewyrm&quot; books were successful, and the range quickly became a regular bi-monthly series. Starting with book #11, &quot;The Highest Science&quot;, in February 1993, Virgin switched to a monthly publication schedule. In July 1994, Virgin began a companion range of novels, the Missing Adventures, which told stories of previous incarnations of the Doctor.

Following the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie in 1996 the BBC chose not to renew Virgin&#x27;s licence to produce &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels, choosing instead to publish their own line of original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fiction. After 61 New Adventures and 33 Missing Adventures, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fiction came to an end at Virgin with &quot;The Dying Days&quot;, their only Eighth Doctor novel. However, the final &quot;Doctor Who&quot; book actually published by Virgin was &quot;So Vile a Sin&quot;, featuring the Seventh Doctor; it had been scheduled for release several months before &quot;The Dying Days&quot; but was delayed due to difficulties with the manuscript.

===Bernice Summerfield===
The New Adventures series continued with Bernice Summerfield, one of the new companions introduced for the New Adventures, as the lead character, starting with her taking up a job as professor of archaeology at the St Oscar&#x27;s University on the planet of Dellah.

A meeting was held at Virgin in mid-July 1996 with the New Adventures editorial team, Peter Darvill-Evans, Rebecca Levene and Simon Winstone, and several regular writers for the series: Paul Cornell, Gareth Roberts, Andy Lane, Lance Parkin and Justin Richards. This was to plan the basics of the Benny books. Parkin&#x27;s The Dying Days as then tasked with getting the character of Benny to 2593.

The new line was written by many of the writers that had written for the New Adventures and continued to feature elements of both the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; New Adventures and, to a lesser extent, television continuity. Indeed, its concluding arc – the so-called &quot;Gods arc&quot;, which sees an alien race with god-like powers devastating Dellah – ties in with concurrent events in the BBC Eighth Doctor line. The links between the NA &quot;Dead Romance&quot; (a standalone volume in which Bernice Summerfield does not actually appear) and the two-volume Eighth Doctor novel &quot;&quot; (all written by Lawrence Miles) are particularly close.

==Storytelling==
The New Adventures were self-described as being &quot;stories too broad and deep for the small screen,&quot; and purported to take &quot;Doctor Who&quot; into &quot;previously unexplored realms of time and space&quot;. What this meant, in practice, was a shift towards more adult-oriented science fiction writing, and use of the literary form to play around with the standard conventions of the series. From the beginning, the novels were controversial for their use of sex, violence and bad language, although this was never as frequent or as extreme as many people seemed to believe. As the series found its audience over time a greater share of fandom began to accept the new direction.

Among the developments were a &quot;hardening&quot; of Ace, with a story arc that had her leave the Doctor for three years (from her perspective) and returning as an older and more cynical character, more morally ambiguous endings and the introduction of new companions, such as Bernice and the Adjudicators Chris Cwej and Roz Forrester. Bernice, in particular, proved so popular that in addition to appearing in her own novels, she has gone on to star in her own audio plays as well.

The novels were guided by the so-called Cartmel Masterplan, which was the backstory that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story editor Andrew Cartmel had constructed for the television series when it was cancelled and never brought to fruition. Hints were therefore dropped about the &quot;true&quot; nature of the Seventh Doctor, which culminated in the penultimate novel in the Virgin series, &quot;Lungbarrow&quot;, written by Marc Platt. That said, neither of the main editors of the line, Peter Darvill-Evans or Rebecca Levene took the Masterplan as an absolute, preferring to develop those themes by tone rather than plot. Only a handful of books in the line are heavily based around the Masterplan.

One novel in the series, &quot;&quot;, was in fact a novelisation of an that had featured the Sontarans. The production team had licensed the use of the Sontarans and Rutans, but had not included the Doctor due to lack of copyright. The novelisation of &quot;Shakedown&quot;, however, was expanded to include the Doctor. (Similarly, the NA&#x27;s sister series, the Missing Adventures, included novelisations of the spin-off production, &quot;Downtime&quot; and the BBC Radio drama &quot;The Ghosts of N-Space&quot;.)

One novel in the series, &quot;All-Consuming Fire&quot;, written by Andy Lane, featured a crossover with Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s characters Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, and also with H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos. Editor Peter Darvill-Evans initially told Lane that Holmes and Watson were to become the Doctor&#x27;s new companions, but this did not happen.

==Writers==
As well as introducing new characters, the range also provided a showcase for new writing talent. Notable was Paul Cornell who wrote five of the novels, including the single most popular one (according to a &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; poll), &quot;Human Nature&quot;. Cornell went on to write for the 2005 revival of the television series: &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot; and &quot;Human Nature&quot;/&quot;The Family of Blood&quot;, the latter a two-part adaptation of the 38th New Adventure. Others who later worked on the revived television series include Mark Gatiss, Gareth Roberts, Matt Jones, Simon Winstone and Gary Russell. Even Russell T Davies contributed to the range with his novel &quot;Damaged Goods&quot;. Gatiss and Roberts both did their first ever professional fiction writing for the line, as did others who later found success elsewhere, including Daniel Blythe, Justin Richards, Andy Lane and Lance Parkin.

Several writers from the classic television series also got their chance to contribute – one of the best received novels was &quot;The Also People&quot; by Ben Aaronovitch. Terrance Dicks, the author of many Target episode novelizations and a writer and script editor for the TV series going back to the 1960s, contributed a number of novels. Barry Letts, former producer of the series during the Jon Pertwee era, contributed to the Virgin Missing Adventures line.

Despite moving to the BBC line of novels, the writers (many who cut their teeth with the Virgin series) attempted to maintain continuity with the Virgin range and many elements from this series appeared in later &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories. With Big Finish Productions acquiring the licence to produce both &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and Bernice Summerfield audio plays and short fiction, they have been able to set audio plays within the universe of the Virgin novel line, as is the case with &quot;The Shadow of the Scourge&quot; and &quot;The Dark Flame&quot;, for example. Although the continuity of the audio plays and the BBC&#x27;s Eighth Doctor Adventures diverge sharply from each other, they both broadly appear to maintain continuity with the Virgin series; Big Finish&#x27;s early Bernice Summerfield works did not.

==Legacy==
===Adaptations===
Paul Cornell&#x27;s 1995 novel, &quot;Human Nature&quot;, as noted above, formed the basis of a two-part episode of the television series broadcast in 2007. This was the first time a full-length original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel had been adapted for television, although Cornell (who also wrote the teleplay) had to make substantial changes to transform his Seventh Doctor novel into a story featuring the Tenth Doctor.

Big Finish Productions produced audio drama adaptations of the novels &quot;Birthright&quot; and &quot;Just War&quot;, altering them to remove the Doctor and his various companions and focus on the character of Benny Summerfield. In October 2012 a special adaptation of Benny&#x27;s debut story, &quot;Love and War&quot; was published with Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor and Sophie Aldred as Ace, to mark the 20th anniversary of the character&#x27;s début.

Due to the success of what was planned to be a one-off release, Big Finish continued the line with an adaptation of &quot;The Highest Science&quot;, again featuring Sylvester McCoy and Lisa Bowerman in their respective roles, in December 2014. Also produced were Russell T. Davies&#x27; novel &quot;Damaged Goods&quot;, starring Sylvester McCoy, Travis Oliver and Yasmin Bannerman as the Seventh Doctor, Chris Cwej and Roz Forrester respectively, released in May 2015; &quot;Theatre of War&quot; and &quot;All-Consuming Fire&quot; in December 2015; &quot;Nightshade&quot; in April 2016; and &quot;Original Sin&quot; and &quot;Cold Fusion&quot; in December 2016.

===Reprints===
The Bernice Summerfield novel &quot;Dead Romance&quot; was republished in 2004. In 2014, the novel &quot;Shakedown&quot; was republished by Penguin as part of &quot;The Monster Collection&quot;, followed in 2015 by &quot;Human Nature&quot;, republished as part of &quot;The History Collection&quot;. BBC Audio published audiobooks of &quot;Human Nature&quot; and &quot;Shakedown&quot; in 2015 and 2016, narrated by Lisa Bowerman and Dan Starkey respectively.

===Cwej: The Series===

Along with Bernice Summerfield, Chris Cwej would also receive a spin-off of his own published by Arcbeatle Press. The series would also cross over with Faction Paradox, a spin-off of the Eighth Doctor Adventures.

===Featuring the Doctor===

Notes:
===Featuring Bernice Summerfield===
The adventures of Bernice Summerfield continued in a series of novels and short story anthologies published by Big Finish Productions from 2000.

==Plot overview==

===Recurring elements===

The New Adventures significantly expanded the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; universe. The character of the Doctor was recast as Time&#x27;s Champion, which was sometimes interpreted figuratively and sometimes literally – Time, Death and Pain are occasionally seen as personified beings (possibly Eternals), who were worshipped as gods in Ancient Gallifrey. The Doctor was also shown to have a link to the Other, a figure from the time of Rassilon and Omega; the nature of this link was most explicitly shown in &quot;Lungbarrow&quot;.

Many new parts of the TARDIS were seen in the New Adventures, including a tertiary console room made of stone. The Doctor was also seen to have a house in Kent&quot;. Also appearing in &quot;Warhead&quot; and its sequels, &quot;Warlock&quot; and &quot;Warchild&quot; (all by Andrew Cartmel) are the ecological activist Justine and psychic Vincent Wheaton.

Alien races created for the New Adventures include the Chelonians (who first appear in &quot;The Highest Science&quot;) and the Pakhars (who first appear in &quot;Legacy&quot;). Another group of adversaries who appear in several New and Missing Adventures are the Great Old Ones, derived from H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos. In the New Adventures, these beings are survivors of the universe before this one, who therefore exist in accordance with a different set of physical laws. A being calling itself Azathoth in &quot;All-Consuming Fire&quot; turns out to be an impostor, but the novel identifies several other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; monsters with Lovecraftian entities: the Great Intelligence is Yog-Sothoth, the Animus is Lloigor, Fenric is Hastur the Unspeakable, and an Old One encountered in &quot;White Darkness&quot; is Cthulhu.

The early New Adventures were explicitly linked in story arcs, indicated in the books&#x27; titles. Later novels in the series were often, but not always, linked in looser story arcs, which were noted in publicity materials but not in the titles.

===Timewyrm===
:During a visit to Ancient Mesopotamia, the Doctor accidentally grants a cybernetically enhanced alien queen the ability to travel freely in time, thus creating the Timewyrm. The Doctor and Ace pursue the Timewyrm through time and space, from a Nazi-occupied Britain to the far future. Eventually, after a battle within his own mind, the Doctor is able to trap the Timewyrm in the body of a mindless baby, forcing it to relinquish its power and memories but giving it a new chance at life.

===Cat&#x27;s Cradle===

:The TARDIS is damaged by a three-way collision with an alien parasite and time explorers from ancient Gallifrey. While the TARDIS attempts to repair itself, the Doctor and Ace fight the sinister Butler Corporation in the early 21st century. The final repairs to the TARDIS&#x27;s link to the Eye of Harmony require organic material, which the Doctor eventually acquires after a visit to Wales and Tír na n-Óg, a planet inhabited by beings modelled after figures from Celtic mythology and English folklore. However, unbeknownst to the Doctor, the organic material is tainted with a demonic intelligence, which infects the TARDIS.

===Future History Cycle===

:On the planet Heaven, Ace falls in love with a Traveller named Jan. However, when Heaven is threatened by the deadly fungal Hoothi, the Doctor manipulates Jan into sacrificing himself to destroy the Hoothi. Furious, Ace leaves the Doctor&#x27;s company, and he is joined by archaeologist Bernice Summerfield. Benny and the Doctor travel through the history of Earth and its colonies from the 22nd through 26th centuries, having adventures alongside Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart and William Blake. Both the TARDIS and the Doctor begin behaving more and more erratic as a result of the TARDIS&#x27;s infection. As part of his plan to remove the infection, the Doctor brings Ace back on board the TARDIS, but she has spent three years fighting Daleks in Earth&#x27;s Spacefleet, and has been somewhat hardened by the experience. Ace rejoins the Doctor, and turns the tables on him by manipulating him into a mission on the planet Lucifer.

:The Doctor continues to stage manage events like a chess master playing on multiple boards. At one point he even deposits Benny and Ace in 1909 and the distant future, respectively, to defeat an alien invasion on their own, while he uses the TARDIS&#x27;s &quot;Jade Pagoda&quot; and defeats a Cyberman plot in 2006.

===Alternate History Cycle===

:The TARDIS lands in a tar pit in an Earth ruled by the Silurians. This is an alternate universe in which the Third Doctor died in a Silurian prison and was not able to prevent the Silurian plague from devastating the human race. The Doctor recognizes that this universe is draining energy from the real one, and creates a Time Ram with his counterpart&#x27;s TARDIS and his own, to destroy the altered reality; his own TARDIS is apparently destroyed, and he leaves in his counterpart&#x27;s. The Doctor realises that someone has been altering the past, including the Doctor&#x27;s own timeline. An alteration of the Doctor&#x27;s encounter with the Matrix allows an ancient Gallifreyan evil to be resurrected; the psychic force of a dead Aztec priest-king survives for much longer than it should; and the Land of Fiction survives the Doctor&#x27;s previous visit, with a new Writer (a young man named Jason) who traps the Doctor in a poorly constructed fictional world. Eventually the changes are revealed as the work of the Meddling Monk here named &quot;Mortimus&quot; and using a captured Chronovore to alter the timeline. He frees the Vardans from the time loop the Doctor had imprisoned them in, but the Doctor and UNIT are able to defeat an attempted Vardan invasion of Earth in 1976. Ace pretends to join the Monk and frees the Chronovore, who restores (most) of the altered realities to their &quot;status quo ante&quot;. Her encounter with the Monk also helps Ace to forgive the Doctor for his past manipulations.

:After a visit to Peladon, Benny briefly leaves the Doctor and Ace to join an Ice Warrior archaeological team on Phaester Osiris. She rejoins them in time for the trio to become involved in a complex scheme by Irving Braxiatel to defeat a civilization of theatre-obsessed conquerors who had been threatening the Braxiatel Collection. In 1887, the trio join forces with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson and encounter the Giant Rat of Sumatra before eventually traveling to Bombay and the planet Ry&#x27;leh to foil an alien impersonating the Great Old One Azathoth.

:After spending several months running a speakeasy in 1920s Chicago, the Doctor returns to E-Space to face a renewed Vampire threat, and is reunited with Romana, who returns with him to Gallifrey. At an Air Force base in 1957 New Mexico, the Doctor, Benny and Ace encounter the Master, who has used nanotechnology provided by a race known as the Tzun to restore and regenerate his body. Later, the three travelers meet one of the oldest beings in the universe, a &quot;grey man&quot; who tries to weaken the good-and-evil dualism which his people had instilled in the universe&#x27;s structure.

:On Earth in the 21st century, the Doctor, Benny and Ace investigate a new drug called &quot;warlock&quot; which has the power to enable the user to transfer his or her mind to another place or body; they discover that drug is actually an alien gestalt intelligence, and help it to leave the Earth. A series of rifts in time and space (created by a crude time machine used by Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart) sends Ace to Ancient Egypt, Benny to France in 1798, and the Doctor to the Paris Commune of 1871; the three are eventually reunited, but Ace decides to stay behind in Paris, keeping one of Kadiatu&#x27;s time hoppers. She takes the title of Time&#x27;s Vigilante.

:After Ace&#x27;s departure, Benny has a series of painful losses. First, her friend Darius Cheynor (a 24th century officer first encountered in &quot;The Dimension Riders&quot;) survives an encounter with powerful Sensopaths from the end of time, only to be killed in a conflict with the cybernetic Phractons. Shortly thereafter, Bernice falls in love with the 13th century Knight Templar Guy de Carnac, who apparently dies defending a Cathar village in the Albigensian Crusade. Unable to understand Benny&#x27;s grief on a human level, the Doctor purchases a device which alters his biodata, transforming him into a human named Dr. John Smith. Smith lives as a history teacher at an English public school, and falls in love with a fellow teacher named Joan. However, when alien Aubertides, hoping to acquire Time Lord abilities, attack the school, Smith sacrifices himself and becomes the Doctor once more; as the Time Lord, he is unable to love Joan in the way the human John Smith did. Joan gives the Doctor her cat Wolsey.

:Investigating a mysterious warning about Earth in the 30th century, the Doctor and Benny meet Adjudicators Roz Forrester and Chris Cwej. The four discover extensive corruption in the Earth Empire, and a trail which leads them to the Doctor&#x27;s old enemy Tobias Vaughn, who had survived his betrayal by the Cybermen and worked for centuries behind the scenes to ensure that Earth was victorious over alien foes. Vaughn is a driving force behind the Earth Empire, but is defeated by the Doctor. Roz and Chris cannot return to the corrupt Adjudicator force, and join the Doctor and Benny in the TARDIS.

:The four travellers have several adventures in quick succession, from a journey to the strange pocket dimension known as the System, to an encounter with Chelonians on a distant planet. They also stop the abduction of children from 1919 Earth to fight in an unending war on the planet Q&#x27;ell.

:The Land of Fiction and its new Writer, Jason, trouble the Doctor again, this time creating a fictional &quot;Dr. Who&quot; whose two-dimensional morality contrasts with the complex manipulations of Time&#x27;s Champion. In this adventure, the Doctor is temporarily reunited with both Ace and his former companion Mel, who is dismayed at the changes the Doctor has undergone since she knew him. The Land of Fiction&#x27;s energy had escaped into the real world as a side effect of Kadiatu Lethbridge-Stewart&#x27;s time travel, so the Doctor finds Kadiatu and takes her to the Dyson Sphere inhabited by the culture known as the People, who are so highly advanced that they have a non-aggression treaty with the Time Lords. While the Doctor, Roz and Chris investigate a possible murder, Benny helps Kadiatu overcome the programming which had turned her into a killing machine.

:Following this, the crews of both the TARDIS and the solar yacht &quot;Tiger Moth&quot; become involved in the ongoing Sontaran/Rutan conflict. In 1941, Benny spends several months incognito in Nazi-occupied Guernsey, investigating a German weapon which has the potential to change the course of the Second World War – a weapon inspired by a passing remark made by the Doctor to a German scientist in 1936.

===Psi-Powers Cycle===

:The TARDIS travellers next have several adventures involving humans with psychic abilities. Many of these involve a shadowy organization known as the Brotherhood. The first psi-powers encounter is a final encounter with Vincent Wheaton, who has lost his powers but is manipulating his psychic son Ricky. Next, the time travellers investigate an outbreak of psychic powers on the planet Yemaya 4 in the 23rd century, which turns out to be carrying the mind of a sentient computer. The travellers have several other adventures before their next encounter with the Brotherhood.

:In the distant Dagellan Cluster, while the Doctor attempts to mediate an interplanetary war between three stellar empires, a war which Roz and Chris become caught up in, Benny meets and falls in love with a displaced human drifter and con-artist named Jason Kane. The two decide to get married. The Doctor arranges a gala wedding in the English village of Cheldon Boniface, in the early 21st century, home of Ishtar Hutchings, the former Timewyrm. He invites and provides transportation for guests from points throughout time and space, including Ace, Kadiatu, Irving Braxiatel and Sherlock Holmes and Watson. The wedding is interrupted by the Master, who had stolen a Gallifreyan relic to build himself a new body, and had created a Fortean flicker to distract the Time Lords with improbable coincidences; however, his plan had backfired when the flicker caused the Doctor to coincidentally arrive to arrange Benny&#x27;s wedding. The Master&#x27;s backup plans are defeated with the help of Ishtar; the temporal energy she releases also rejuvenates the aging Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. The Fortean flicker also returns the Doctor&#x27;s original TARDIS from the alternate reality where it had been seemingly destroyed. The Doctor gives Benny and Jason two time rings as wedding presents.

:On Mars shortly before the Dalek invasion of Earth, the Doctor, Roz and Chris discover a plan by a rogue Ice Warrior faction to assemble an ancient Osirian weapon to wreak revenge on the human colonists who have driven them off their planet. Returning to his investigations of human psi-powers, the Doctor travels to New York State in 1799, where he battles Cacophany, the Carnival Queen, representative of the irrationality banished from the universe by the earliest Time Lords.

:Benny then contacts the Doctor, asking for his help in discovering what happened to her father Isaac Summerfield, a Spacefleet Admiral who disappeared during a crucial battle with the Daleks. The Doctor and Bernice discover that Isaac&#x27;s ship was caught in a time rift and ended up on Earth in the twentieth century. They find Isaac in an English village in 1983, running an underground railroad for stranded aliens. While Chris and Roz become closer, the Doctor and Benny deal with a plot to change human history.

:The Doctor recovers the trail of the mysterious Brotherhood in 1880s Paris, where several secret societies are using psychic powers to their own advantage. Investigating an unusually deadly shipment of cocaine in a London council estate in 1987, the Doctor, Roz and Chris discover that an ancient Gallifreyan weapon called an N-Form has been activated, in part by the distorted psychic bond between twins separated at birth. In the 2980s, while human nobles (including Roz&#x27;s sister Leabie Forrester) fight for control of the Earth Empire, the Brotherhood (which has become a powerful player in galactic politics) hopes to use another Gallifreyan artefact, the Nexus, to induce psychic powers in all human beings. While the Doctor and Chris focus on the threat posed by the Brotherhood, Roz joins her sister in her bid to reform the corrupt Empire. Although the Doctor is able to defeat the Brotherhood utterly, he is unable to save Roz from dying in battle. Leabie becomes Empress, and at Roz&#x27;s funeral the Doctor suffers a heart attack.

:While recovering from Roz&#x27;s death in 1958 London, the Doctor and Chris encounter Moriah, an alien king who has been creating artificial life-forms in an effort to bring back his dead wife, and the Doctor&#x27;s former companion Peri, who has been trapped in a loveless marriage to King Yrcanos since she and the Doctor parted. In 2003, when Benny and Jason join two archaeological teams searching for Noah&#x27;s Ark, a ruthless Iranian soldier accidentally causes a deadly biological agent to be released in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, killing hundreds of millions, including Liz Shaw. Benny and Jason agree to divorce.

:In 16th-century Japan, the Doctor meets Victorian time-traveller Penelope Gate (whom later BBC novels suggest may be his mother) and comes to terms with his recent losses and impending regeneration (of which he is aware). Chris also begins to heal and discover his own form of heroism. Finally, the Doctor returns to his family home on Gallifrey, where long-buried secrets are revealed. Chris decides to remain on Gallifrey and Romana, now Lady President, sends the Doctor to Skaro to retrieve the Master&#x27;s remains. This leads into the events of the television movie.

:The Eighth Doctor meets Benny at the house on Allen Road in 1997, and the two of them (alongside the Brigadier) defeat an Ice Warrior invasion. At the story&#x27;s end, the Doctor takes Benny to her new job in the 26th century, a position at St. Oscar&#x27;s University on the planet Dellah.

<doc id="739393" wikidata="Q595285" url="?curid=739393" title="Nubar Pasha">
<text>Nubar Pasha GCSI (; ; January 1825 – 14 January 1899) was an Egyptian-Armenian politician and the first Prime Minister of Egypt. He served as Prime Minister three times during his career. His first term was between August 1878 and 23 February 1879. His second term was served from 10 January 1884 to 9 June 1888. His final term was between 16 April 1894 and 12 November 1895.

==Early life==
Nubar was born Nubar Nubarian () in Smyrna in January 1825, the son of a Christian Armenian merchant named Mgrdich, who had married a relative of Boghos Bey Yusufian, an influential minister of Muhammad Ali. Boghos Bey had promised to interest himself in the future of his young relative, and at his suggestion he was sent first to Vevey, and then to Toulouse, to be educated by the Jesuits, from whom he acquired an excellent command of the French language.

==Khedival Secretary: 1843-1863==
Before he was eighteen he went to Egypt, and after some eighteen months training as secretary to Boghos Bey, who was then minister of both commerce and foreign affairs, he was made second secretary to Muhammad Ali. In 1845 he became first secretary to Ibrahim Pasha, the heir apparent, and accompanied him on a special mission to Europe.

Abbas Pasha, who succeeded Ibrahim in 1848, maintained Nubar in the same capacity, and sent him in 1850 to London as his representative to resist the pretensions of the Ottoman sultan, who was seeking to evade the conditions of the treaty under which Egypt was secured to the family of Muhammad Ali. Here he was so completely successful that he was made a bey; in 1853 he was sent to Vienna on a similar mission, and remained there until the death of Abbas in July 1854.

The new viceroy, Said, at once dismissed him from office, but two years afterwards appointed him his chief secretary, and later gave him charge of the important transport service through Egypt to India. Here Nubar was mainly instrumental in the completion of railway communication between Cairo and Suez, and exhibited strong organising ability combined with readiness of resource. After a second time falling a victim to Said&#x27;s caprice and being dismissed, he was again sent to Vienna, and returned as principal secretary to Said, a position he held till Said&#x27;s death in January 1863.

On the accession of Ismail Pasha, Nubar Bey was in the prime of life. He was already on friendly terms with him; he even claimed to have saved his life — at all events, it was a coincidence that the two had together refused to travel by the train an accident to which caused the death (on 14 May 1858) of the prince Ahmed, who would otherwise have succeeded Said. Ismail, himself a more capable man than his immediate predecessors, at once recognized the ability of Nubar, and charged him with a mission to Constantinople, not only to notify his accession, but to smooth the way for the many ambitious projects he already entertained, notably the completion of the Suez Canal, the change in title to that of khedive and the change in the order of succession.

In the first of these he was completely successful; the sultan, believing as little as every one else that the canal was anything more than a dream, gave his consent at a price the moderation of which he must afterwards have regretted. The gratified Ismail created Nubar a pasha, and the sultan himself, persuaded to visit Cairo, confirmed the title so rarely accorded to a Christian. Half the work was, however, yet to be done, and Nubar was sent to Paris to complete the arrangements, and to settle the differences between Egypt and the Canal Company. In what he used to call an expensive moment of enthusiasm, he left these differences to the arbitration of the emperor Napoleon III and cost Egypt four million pounds sterling.

==Cabinet Minister: 1864-1878==
On his return he was made Egypt&#x27;s first minister of public works, and was distinguished for the energy which he threw into the creation of a new department; but in 1866 he was made minister of foreign affairs, and at once went on a special mission to Constantinople, where he succeeded in the other two projects that had been left in abeyance since his last visit.

In June 1867 Ismail was declared khedive of Egypt, with succession in favor of his eldest son. Nubar now had a harder task to undertake than ever before. The antiquated system of capitulations which had existed in the Ottoman Empire since the 15th century had grown in Egypt to be a practical creation of seventeen &quot;imperia in imperio&quot;: seventeen consulates of seventeen different powers administered seventeen different codes in courts before which alone their subjects were amenable. A plaintiff could only sue a Frenchman in the French court, with appeal to Aix-en-Provence; an Italian in the Italian court, with appeal to Ancona; a Russian in the Russian court, with appeal to Moscow. Nubar&#x27;s bold design, for which alone he deserves the credit, was to induce these seventeen powers to consent to abandon their jurisdiction in civil actions, to substitute mixed International Courts and a uniform code binding on all. That in spite of the jealousies of all the powers, in spite of the opposition of the Sublime Porte, he should have succeeded, places him at once in the first rank of statesmen of his period. Nubar made no attempt to get rid of the criminal jurisdiction exercised by the consular representatives of the foreign powers — such a proposal would have had, at that time, no chance of success.
==Prime Minister: 1878-1879==
The extravagant administration of Ismail, for which perhaps Nubar can hardly be held wholly responsible, had brought Egypt to the verge of bankruptcy, and Ismail&#x27;s disregard of the judgments of the Court at last compelled Great Britain and France to interfere. Under pressure, Ismail, who began to regret the establishment of the International Courts, assented to a mixed ministry under Nubar, with Charles Rivers Wilson as minister of finance and the Marquis de Blignières as minister of public works. Nubar, finding himself supported by both Great Britain and France, tried to reduce Ismail to the position of a constitutional monarch, and Ismail, with an astuteness worthy of a better cause, took advantage of a somewhat injudicious disbandment of certain regiments to incite a military rising against the ministry. The governments of Great Britain and France, instead of supporting the ministry against the khedive, weakly consented to Nubar&#x27;s dismissal; but when this was shortly followed by that of Rivers Wilson and de Blignières they realized that the situation was a critical one, and they succeeded in obtaining from the sultan the deposition of Ismail and the substitution of his son Tawfiq as khedive (1879). Nubar remained out of office until 1884.

==Prime Minister: 1884 - 1888==
In the interval Great Britain had intervened in Egypt — the battle of Tel al-Kebir had been fought, Urabi Pasha had been banished, and Sir Evelyn Baring (afterwards Lord Cromer) had succeeded Sir Edward Baldwin Malet. The British government, under the advice of Baring, insisted on the evacuation of the Sudan, and Muhammad Sharif Pasha having resigned office, the more pliant Nubar was induced to become prime minister, and to carry out a policy of which he openly disapproved, but which he considered Egypt was forced to accept under British dictation. At this period he used to say, &quot;I am not here to govern Egypt, but to administer the British government of Egypt. I am simply the greaser of the official wheels.&quot;

It might have been well if Nubar had confined himself to this modest programme, but it was perhaps hardly to be expected of a man of his ability and restless energy. It must be admitted, however, that the characters of Nubar and Lord Cromer were not formed to run in harness, and it was with no surprise that the public learnt in June 1888 that he had been relieved of office, though his dismissal was the direct act of the khedive Tawfiq, who did not on this occasion seek the advice of the British agent.

==Prime Minister: 1894-1895==
Riyad Pasha, who succeeded him, was, with one interval of eight months, prime minister until April 1894, when Nubar returned to office. By that time Lord Cromer had more completely grasped the reins of administration as well as of government, and Nubar had realized more clearly the role which an Egyptian minister was called on to play: Lord Cromer was the real ruler of Egypt, and the death of Tawfiq in 1892 had necessitated a more open exercise of British authority.

In November 1895 Nubar completed his fifty years of service, and, accepting a pension, retired from office. He lived little more than three years longer, spending his time between Cairo and Paris, where he died in January 1899.

==Legacy==
Nubarashen, a suburb of Yerevan, was founded in 1930 with the help of Boghos Nubar, Nubar Pasha&#x27;s son, and is named after Nubar Pasha.

<doc id="739396" wikidata="Q1132604" url="?curid=739396" title="Fiat Tempra">
<text>The Fiat Tempra (Type 159) is a small family car produced by the Italian automaker Fiat from 1990 to 1996 in Italy. The Tempra was intended as a replacement for the Fiat Regata. The original project was called &quot;Tipo 3&quot;, being a mid-size car between the Fiat Tipo (project &quot;Tipo 2&quot;) and the bigger Fiat Croma (project &quot;Tipo 4&quot;). The Tempra shares its Type Three platform with the Lancia Dedra and Alfa Romeo 155.

The Tempra was named the 1991 Semperit Irish Car of the Year in Ireland. In Brazil, the Tempra was built from 1991 to 1998. The car was also assembled in Turkey by Tofaş and in Vietnam by Mekong Auto in complete knock down until 2000.

==Overview==
The saloon of the Tempra was shown for the first time in newspapers in November 1989, and introduced in March 1990 at the Geneva Motor Show, with the station wagon (marketed as the &quot;Tempra SW&quot;) arriving two months later in Turin. The initial engine range comprised 1.4, 1.6 and 1.8 petrol units and normally aspirated and turbocharged 1.9 litre diesel units.

The car began to be produced in Brazil for Latin American markets, after being introduced in Aruba, September 1991. First seen in September 1992, a two door coupé version of it, was produced exclusively for the market in Brazil. It was built until 1995, and a turbocharged petrol version was also available there.

==Mechanics==

The Tempra&#x27;s engine range was similar to that of the Tipo. Initially 1.4 and 1.6 litre models had carburetted engines. Both of these models were discontinued after 1992, due to the new European emission standards, and thus all models from 1993 onwards had catalytic converters and electronic fuel injection.

The standard transmission was a five-speed manual, and a continuously variable transmission was also offered as an option, a first on a midsize saloon. The CVT transmission was previously available on the Uno, Panda, Ritmo and Tipo.

The CVT transmission, called the &quot;Selecta&quot;, was available only with the 1.6-litre engine with either bodystyle. As of July 1991, the 2.0 litre SX model became available with an optional four speed automatic transmission.

At the March 1992 Geneva Motor Show, a version with permanent four-wheel drive was introduced. It was only available in the Station Wagon bodystyle, fitted with the two-litre engine. The four-wheel drive system has a slight front bias (56/44%).

During its six year production run, few changes were made apart from a minor facelift in April 1993, which resulted in a new front grille and other minor styling changes, as well as new equipment levels.

Main parts (most notably, the doors) were shared with the Fiat Tipo. Other vehicles, derived from the same platform were the Lancia Dedra (Tempra&#x27;s most similar cousin, sharing all mechanical components) and the Alfa Romeo 155.

The Tempra had two exclusive options in Brazil: a two-door coupé bodystyle for any engine option (from 1992 to 1994), and a 2.0-litre turbo, which was sold in the two-door bodystyle called &quot;Tempra Turbo&quot; (1994 to 1995) and with the four-door as &quot;Tempra Turbo Stile&quot; (1996 to 1997).

The engine delivered and of torque.

Period magazine tests registered in 8.2 seconds, and a top speed of for the two-door Tempra Turbo in 1994. The Tempra Turbo 1994 was only the second turbocharged car to enter series production in Brazil. The first one was the Uno Turbo, also in 1994.

==Equipment and trim levels==
Only two trim levels were available in the early years of production: standard (S) and SX, both reasonably equipped considering the Tempra&#x27;s low price.

SX models for example, featured power windows, power locks, adjustable seat belts and steering wheel, front fog lights, body coloured bumpers, velvet upholstery, a futuristic digital dashboard and many other standard extras. They were also available with optional extras like anti-lock brakes, alloy wheels, sunroof and electronic climate control.

A facelift in April 1993 featured more trim levels, now ranging from the standard models (&quot;L&quot; in the United Kingdom, where it was only available with 1.4-litre engine) via the S and SX to the top SLX, which was only available with 1.8, and 2.0 litre engines in the United Kingdom. An optional driver&#x27;s airbag was another innovation that year.

The four-wheel drive Station Wagons continued to be available in some markets, such as Switzerland.

In Turkey, where Tofaş built the car, there were also &quot;SX A&quot; and &quot;SX AK&quot; (climate control added) trims available. The 1,000,000th Tempra which Tofaş built was a 2.0 i.e. 16V model. The Turkish 16 valve Tempra was not sold in the rest of Europe; it was also available with station wagon bodystyle and has a engine.

There was also a panel van bodystyle sold in the domestic market of Italy called the Marengo, a name also used before with the Regata Weekend and later again with the Marea Wagon. This is a commercial version of the Tempra which was based on the Station Wagon bodystyle, but with basic equipment, heavily tinted rear windows, and no rear seats. The engines were most commonly the naturally aspirated diesel units.

==Known issues==
&quot;Quattroruote&quot;, a popular Italian motoring magazine, reported some failures and defects with the Tempra. The first issue to be reported was some water ingress through the windscreen seals, an issue that previously plagued some other Fiat vehicles, especially Alfa 33, which in rainy conditions would carry a significant quantity of water on board. This problem was reported from 1990–1992 and was resolved with using a higher quantity of sealant when fitting the glass.

Another reported problem was high oil consumption, especially the 1,581 cc engine, which was a common defect with the Tipo (with the same engine) and Panda (1000 FIRE engine). The same was reported for other Fiat vehicles but disappeared with the new 1.6 L engine.

On the same model, from 1994, the car started to show some electronic malfunctions, with items such as the electronic control unit, code key and electric system. A design flaw of the Tempra was that its rear window was too small and inclined and the tail too tall, so that rear visibility was poor. This issue was common with the 155 and Dedra, and was one of the reasons the estate had more success than the saloon, especially in the United Kingdom.

==Qualities==


Average range for a 55 kW 1.6 litre sedan was around (), and consumption at constant speed was of at and at . All these were aided by a favourable aerodynamic (Cx 0.297) and only 17.2 PS subtracted at , which was the best result among all the rivals.

Another advantage was the galvanized structure, which allowed the car to be resistant against rust over time, showing good resilience to weather and bad climate conditions after many years. Other qualities were the strength and reliability of the mechanics, thanks to the engine that could be used in urban, extra urban and highway driving conditions.

The luggage capacity, especially in the Marengo panel van, was also one of the favourites among corporations, especially with the 1,929 cc diesel engine, and the interior space was comfortable for five persons during long travels.

==F1 Safety Car==

A Brazilian produced version of the 16 valve Tempra had the honourable role of being used in Formula One as the Safety Car during the season of , most notably at the Brazilian Grand Prix.

==End of production==
The Tempra was discontinued in Europe in August 1996, and in Brazil in 1998. It was replaced by the Marea, which is based on the Bravo and Brava platform, the replacements for the Tempra&#x27;s sister car the Tipo. In Brazil, 204,795 Tempras were produced in eight years, and in Turkey, where the car was manufactured by Tofaş from November 1990 until 1999, 129,590 were made.

<text>Hürth is a town in the Rhein-Erft-Kreis, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Hürth shares borders with the city of Cologne and is about 6 km to the southwest of Cologne city centre, at the northeastern slope of the natural preserve Kottenforst-Ville. The town consists of thirteen districts, once independent villages, and is distributed over a relatively large area. The municipal area is interspersed with lakes and stretches of forest.

In former times, the Eifel Aqueduct, a Roman aqueduct which supplied the city of Cologne with drinking water, went through Hürth. Remnants of various aqueducts can still be found underground. It is also famous as the birthplace of Michael and Ralf Schumacher.

==Geography==
Hürth is situated about 6 km to the southwest of Cologne city centre, at the northeastern slope of the Kottenforst-Ville nature reserve.

The town, consisting of thirteen formerly independent villages, is essentially made up of numerous subdivisions and commercial centres distributed over a relatively large area. The municipal area is interspersed with lakes and stretches of forest.

==Coat of arms==
Hürth&#x27;s coat of arms shows an eagle from the family coat of arms belonging to the knight Hurth von Schönecken, the cross of Cologne and a cogwheel that refers to the heavy industry. It was awarded to the community on 26 October 1934 by a verdict of the Prussian Ministry of State.

==Districts==
* Alstädten/Burbach
* Alt-Hürth
* Berrenrath
* Efferen
* Fischenich
* Gleuel
* Hermülheim
* Hürth-Mitte
* Kalscheuren
* Kendenich
* Knapsack
* Sielsdorf
* Stotzheim

==History==

On 1 April 1930 the rural communities of Hürth (with Alstädten and Knapsack), Berrenrath, Fischenich, Gleuel (with Sielsdorf and Burbach), Hermülheim and Kendenich (with Kalscheuren) were united into a new country community called Hürth. After the same year&#x27;s failed attempt by the city of Cologne, with its then-mayor Konrad Adenauer, to incorporate Efferen, Efferen was associated to Hürth in 1933, in tandem with Stotzheim. This made Hürth the largest rural community of Germany until 1978, when Hürth ceased being a rural community and became a suburb of Cologne as new developments in Efferen closed the gap between the city of Cologne and Hürth.

The country administration of the rural district Cologne was seated in Hürth on 22 November 1963. From 1816, it had been seated in the city of Cologne itself. The administration moved to Bergheim on 3 September 1993.

Hürth is home to the Bundessprachenamt, which was founded on 4 July 1969.

===Alstädten===
Alstädten was first mentioned documentarily in 1185.

===Burbach===
Burbach was first mentioned documentarily in 1233. Nowadays, Alstädten and Burbach are one district named Alstädten-Burbach.

===Berrenrath===
Berrenrath was first mentioned documentarily in 922. The resettlement of Berrenrath onto a now-abandoned brown coal mine was decided on 27 February 1952. This was necessary due to mining plans of the Roddergrube AG. The resettlement was completed in September 1995.

===Efferen===
The Efferen district had its first documentary mention as a pastoral town in 1189. The Catholics first humbled themselves with a plain wooden church. On 6 June 1869 this church was replaced with a solid building, consecrated by auxiliary bishop Baudri.

On 31 October 1944 large parts of Efferen, including the church and the hospital, were destroyed in an air raid; thirty-six people died.

On 20 December 1953 Boue, a member of the church assembly, consecrated the newly built Evangelic church, designed by architect Jürgen Körber. Two years later, on 25 November 1956, a new Roman Catholic church, which was designed by the Cologne architects Wolfram Borgard and Fritz Volmer, was consecrated by auxiliary bishop Wilhem Cleven.

===Fischenich===
Fischenich was first mentioned documentarily in 1189.

===Gleuel===
Gleuel was first mentioned documentarily in 898.

===Hermülheim===
Hermülheim was first mentioned documentarily in 943.

In Hermülheim the town&#x27;s two grammar schools are located: the Ernst-Mach-Gymnasium and the Albert-Schweizer-Gymnasium.

===Hürth (Alt-Hürth)===
Hürth was first mentioned documentarily in 1185.

===Hürth-Mitte===
The building of the residential area Hürth-Mitte, that was begun in 1964 according to a decision by the municipal council in 1960, had the aim of establishing a &quot;city centre&quot; in the approximate geographic centre of Hürth. The decision was evidently benefitted by the constantly raising population in those times. This was partially completed by 1985, with the new town hall and community centre having been erected. Hürth-Mitte is also the site of the Hürth Park, a shopping mall, which serves as the town&#x27;s economic and social centre. Hürth-Mitte is not a district for itself, but officially belongs to Hermülheim.

===Kalscheuren===
Kalscheuren was first mentioned documentarily in 1305.

===Kendenich===
Kendenich was first mentioned documentarily in 941.

===Knapsack===
Knapsack, its first documentary mention in 1566, started to emerge into a notable town after 1900 due to establishment and development of industry (1906 the Knapsack-Griesheim AG, later known as the Hoechst AG; 1913 construction of the brown coal power plant Goldenberg-Werk).

Due to environmental constraints, 4,000 citizens had to be resettled between the years 1969 and 1979.

===Sielsdorf===
Sielsdorf was first mentioned documentarily in 898.

===Stotzheim===
Stotzheim was first mentioned documentarily in 1223.

==Sights==
In former times, the Eifel Aqueduct, a Roman aqueduct which supplied the city of Cologne with drinking water, went through Hürth. A couple of springs and streams in today&#x27;s municipal area were used for that purpose before the Eifel aqueduct was built. Remnants of the aqueducts can still be found in the underground of the city.

==Facility 4101, Tower 93==
Tower 93 of Facility 4101, situated north of Bleibtreusee at , is a 74.84 metres tall electricity pylon, capable of carrying four 380 kV-circuits, which was built in 1975 as strainer for the double-circuit 380 kV-line Oberzier-Sechtem. In 1977 a covered public observation deck, accessible by a staircase in the centre of the pylon, was installed at a height of 27 metres on this tower, which was in all probability the only observation deck ever installed on an electricity pylon. In 2002 two single-phase AC circuits of the 110 kV-line Cologne-Sindorf used by the German railway company, DB AG, were installed on its lowest crossbar.

In 2010 the observation platform, including the staircase, was removed, after repeated vandalism, which concerned also parts important for the integrity of the pylon. Today only a concrete plate between its legs and a pattern in the form of an inverted &quot;v&quot; in its lattice structure remember to the former observation deck.

<doc id="739408" wikidata="Q2398519" url="?curid=739408" title="Eat It">
<text>&quot;Eat It&quot; is a 1984 song by American comedy music artist &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. It is a parody of Michael Jackson&#x27;s 1983 single &quot;Beat It&quot;, with the contents changed to be about an exasperated parent attempting to get their picky child to eat anything at all, much less to eat properly. The track was both a commercial and critical success, earning Yankovic a Grammy Award. It peaked at number twelve in the United States, making it his first top 40 hit in that country, and reached number one in Australia.

==Production==
The famous guitar solo, performed by Eddie Van Halen on &quot;Beat It&quot;, was reproduced by Yankovic&#x27;s producer, Rick Derringer.

According to Yankovic, when he presented his lyrics to Jackson for review, he did not know how Jackson would react. Jackson allegedly thought it was amusing and agreed to allow the parody. On October 19, 1989, the RIAA certified &quot;Eat It&quot; as a gold single.

==Reception==
The single reached number 1 in Australia, and it was his highest-charting US single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 12 until &quot;White &amp; Nerdy&quot; peaked at number 9 in October 2006. &quot;Eat It&quot; earned Yankovic a 1984 Grammy Award in the Best Comedy Recording category. &quot;Eat It&quot; also outranked &quot;Beat It&quot; in overall highest position on the Australian singles chart, with its highest rank being number 1, while &quot;Beat It&quot;&#x27;s highest was third.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; reviewed the single, saying &quot;Rick Derringer’s production has remained true to the energy and appeal of Michael Jackson’s original version, and the lyrics...are actually very funny.&quot;

==Music video==
The video for &quot;Eat It&quot; is styled as a shot-for-shot remake of Jackson&#x27;s video for &quot;Beat It&quot;, but with elements being parodied in various silly ways and Yankovic dressed as Jackson. The video also features a few of the same dancers from Jackson&#x27;s video and Yankovic clumsily mimicking the dance moves from the original video. The video ends with Yankovic looking into the camera with yellow, slitted-pupil eyes, referencing the end of Jackson&#x27;s video for &quot;Thriller&quot;. Jackson received royalties from Yankovic for rights to cover the video so closely.

On June 20, 2022, Yankovic uploaded an alternative version of the music video on his YouTube channel, which consists of a single &quot;coverage take&quot;. The alternate take of Yankovic singing, dancing, and writhing on the bed in the bedroom was intended to be used as a backup if other shots were unusable or unable to be procured in time, although Yankovic said he believed none of the footage was used in the original 1984 cut.

The original 16mm footage of the video was digitized into 4K resolution and re-edited by Yankovic (during the 2022 The Unfortunate Return of the Ridiculously Self-Indulgent, Ill-Advised Vanity Tour) to recreate the original video frame-for-frame. This remaster was done for a scene in &quot;&quot;, which included a brief glimpse of the &quot;Eat It&quot; video with star Daniel Radcliffe&#x27;s face digitally superimposed on Yankovic&#x27;s.

==Legacy==
In 2019, Yankovic had pulled &quot;Eat It&quot; and his other Jackson song parody, &quot;Fat&quot;, from the setlist of his Strings Attached Tour in the wake of the HBO documentary &quot;Leaving Neverland&quot;, in which two men claimed Jackson had sexually abused them when they were children. &quot;I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s going to be permanent or not&quot;, Yankovic said of the decision. &quot;But we just felt that with what&#x27;s happened recently with the HBO documentaries, we didn&#x27;t want anybody to feel uncomfortable.&quot;

As part of a charity effort during the COVID-19 pandemic, David Cross and Bob Odenkirk held a &quot;Mr. Show&quot; online reunion show in May 2020 with many of their former cast members as well as other friends. The show concluded by having Cross, Odenkirk and their cast, as well as Yankovic, sing &quot;Eat It&quot;, in a purposely tone-deaf manner that parodied a prior cover performance of &quot;Imagine&quot; that Gal Gadot and other celebrities had done for COVID-19 awareness but which had been taken as ineffectual.

<text>European route E30 is an A-Class European route from the port of Cork in Ireland in the west to the Russian city of Omsk, near the border with Kazakhstan in the east. For much of the Russian stretch, it follows the Trans-Siberian Highway and, east of the Ural Mountains, with AH6 of the Asian Highway Network, which continues to Busan, South Korea. The total length is — from Cork to Moscow, and from Moscow to Omsk. The naming is by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).

The Russian stretch of this road coincides partly with the Asian Highway Network&#x27;s AH6 (though this latter highway passes through Petropavl, Kazakhstan in its stretch between Chelyabinsk and Omsk, unlike the E 30). The E 30 follows the Russian main road M1 Belarus-Moscow, M5 Moscow-Chelyabinsk, and R254 Chelyabinsk-Kurgan. It goes along minor roads past Ishim to avoid the Kazakh border towards Omsk.

== E30 in the United Kingdom ==
Throughout the UK, the Euroroute network is largely unsigned.

The E30 uses primary routes and motorways across the UK and is approximately between Felixstowe in East Anglia and Fishguard Harbour, Goodwick, in Wales.

=== Felixstowe - London ===
On mainland Europe, the E30 terminates at Hoek-van-Holland where a ferry is required to cross the North Sea to Felixstowe, United Kingdom. The Port of Felixstowe is a major UK freight port with limited passenger operations present. In 2014, Felixstowe handled 28.1 megatonnes of freight, demonstrating the importance of the port within UK import and export sectors, as well as within sectors responsible for the development of UK road infrastructure concerning the E30.

The route from Felixstowe to London:
* A14
* Ipswich - The Port of Ipswich handles approximately 2,000,000 tonnes of freight each year according to the Association of British Ports - Ipswich is the UK&#x27;s largest export port.
* E30 leaves A14 onto the A12.
* (Harwich ) - The A12 joins the A120/ north of Colchester. The A120 acts as a spur to the Port of Harwich, with Stena Line providing cross-sea access to the rest of Europe for passenger traffic.
* Colchester
* Chelmsford
* Brentwood
* E30 leaves A12 and joins M25 motorway junction 28.

=== London ===
The E30 avoids travelling through the centre of London by using the M25 to the north of London between junctions 28 and 15.

Major connections:
* M11
* A10
* A1(M) 
* A405
* M1 
* A41
* M40
* M4 - M25 junction 15

=== M4 Corridor: London - Bristol ===
To the west of London, the E30 uses the M4 motorway to South Wales. The destinations along this route are linked as part of the M4 corridor, named &quot;Britain&#x27;s Science Corridor&quot; by the New York Times upon its inception in 1983. This is because the destinations along the M4 route have become &quot;hubs for the UK bases of major global high-tech companies.&quot;

The London to Bristol route largely follows that of the Great Western Main Line, which serves as a major infrastructural passenger and freight route between some of the destinations along this section of the E30.

Major destinations along this route include:
* London Heathrow Airport
* Slough
* Maidenhead
* Reading
* Newbury 
* Swindon
* Bath
* Bristol

=== M4 Corridor: Bristol - Pont Abraham ===

West of Bristol, the E30 crosses the River Severn over the Second Severn Crossing. The Severn Bridge is used as an alternative to and from Chepstow, which is not directly accessible from the E30. In Wales, the roads which carry the E30 are managed by the South Wales Trunk Road Agent on behalf of the Welsh Assembly Government.

The E30 serves several major industrial destinations in Wales which are largely an extension of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Science Corridor&quot;. These include:
* Chepstow
* Newport
* Cardiff
* Bridgend
* Port Talbot
* Swansea
* Llanelli

Chepstow is home to several scientific research centres, for example, CreoMedical, a firm which develops medical technologies for hospitals across the UK.

Newport, Cardiff, Port Talbot, Swansea and Llanelli are coastal destinations with sea links. ABP maintains a presence at some of these destinations (not Llanelli, additionally at Barry), and handles over 12 million tonnes of freight each year, contributing over £1.5 billion to the economy. This has been developed thanks to the historic development of infrastructure relating to the South Wales Valleys mining industry in the 20th century, which has since declined in recent decades with the rising imports of foreign oil. This can be shown in the closure of South Wales&#x27; last deep mine in 1994.

Cardiff is the capital city of Wales and serves as Wales centre for governance, business and culture. The devolved government of Wales is housed in Cardiff Bay.

In November 2016, Brexit supporter David Rowlands AM (UKIP) argued that the Welsh Government should use trans-European Highways Access funds to maintain the M4 following the UK&#x27;s departure from the EU. This would be in addition to those which Wales have already received to develop the M4 motorway in Wales. He justified his viewpoint by claiming that a large proportion of all Irish exports, both to the UK and the EU, pass along this route.

=== Pont Abraham - Fishguard ===
The E30 is carried by the A48 and A40 from Pont Abraham - the western terminal of the M4 - to Fishguard.

Destinations along the A40 are:
* Carmarthen
* Haverfordwest
* (Pembroke Dock)
* (Milford Haven)
* Fishguard
At Fishguard, sea connections can be made to Ireland.

<text>Mohamed Sherif Pasha GCSI (February 1826 – 20 April 1887) () was an Egyptian statesman. He served as Prime Minister of Egypt three times during his career. His first term was between 7 April 1879 and 18 August 1879. His second term was served from 14 September 1881 to 4 February 1882. His final term was served between 21 August 1882 and 7 January 1884.

== Biography ==
Sherif, who was a Turk from Kavala in the Ottoman Empire (now in northern Greece), filled numerous administrative posts under Sa&#x27;id Pasha and Isma&#x27;il Pasha. He was better educated than most of his contemporaries, and had married Nazli al-Faransawi Hanim, a daughter of Colonel Joseph Anthelme Sèves, the French non-commissioned officer who became Suleiman Pasha under Mehmet Ali, and wife Maria Myriam Hanem. They were the maternal grandparents of Queen consort Nazli of Egypt and Regent Sherif Sabri Pasha.

As minister of foreign affairs he was useful to Ismail, who used Sherif&#x27;s bluff bonhomie to veil many of his most insidious proposals. Of singularly lazy disposition, he yet possessed considerable tact; he was in fact an Egyptian Lord Melbourne, whose policy was to leave everything alone.

Sherif&#x27;s favorite argument against any reform was to appeal to the Pyramids as an immutable proof of the solidity of Egypt financially and politically. His fatal optimism rendered him largely responsible for the collapse of Egyptian credit which brought about the fall of Ismail.

Upon the military insurrection of September 1881 under Urabi Pasha, Sherif was summoned by the khedive Tawfiq to form a new ministry. The impossibility of reconciling the financial requirements of the national party with the demands of the British and French controllers of the public debt, compelled him to resign in the following February.

After the suppression of the Urabi Revolt he was again installed in office (August 1882) by Tawfiq, but in January 1884 he resigned rather than sanction the evacuation of the Sudanese regions of the Khedivate of Egypt. As to the strength of the Mahdist movement he had then no conception. When urged by Sir Evelyn Baring (Lord Cromer) early in 1883 to abandon some of the more distant parts of the Sudan, he replied with characteristic light-heartedness: &quot;Nous en causerons plus tard; d&#x27;abord nous allons donner une bonne raclée à ce monsieur&quot; (We&#x27;ll talk about that later, first we&#x27;re going to give this gentleman (i.e. the self declared Mahdi, Muhammad Ahmad) a good thrashing). Hicks Pasha&#x27;s expedition was at the time preparing to march on El Obeid.

Sherif died in Graz, Austria-Hungary, on 20 April 1887.

<text>Psara (, , ; known in ancient times as /, /) is a Greek island in the Aegean Sea. Together with the small island of Antipsara (population 4) it forms the municipality of Psara. It is part of the Chios regional unit, which is part of the North Aegean region. The only town of the island and seat of the municipality is also called Psara.

Psara had 420 inhabitants according to the 2021 census. It has a small port linking to the island of Chios and other parts of Greece.

In the Psara massacre on the island, thousands of Greeks were massacred by Ottoman troops during the Greek War of Independence in 1824.

==Geography==
Psara lies northwest of Chios, from the northwestern point of the island of Chios and east-northeast of Athens. The length and width of the island are about and the area is . The highest point on the island is &quot;Profitis Ilias&quot; (). The municipality has total area of .

==Flag==
The modern flag of Psara is based largely on the island&#x27;s famous revolutionary flag created by Psariot locals in 1824. The original flag, carried during the War of Independence by Psariot ships, was made of white cloth bordered with red. It bore the symbols of in red (a large cross atop a crescent, a spear, and an anchor). A snake was wrapped around the anchor, often depicted with a bird flying near its mouth. On either side of the symbols, in red capital letters, were the words and in some cases, the island&#x27;s name, spelled or An original 1824 flag of Psara is preserved at the National Historical Museum of Greece.

The flag of Psara currently in use has a very similar design but omits the island&#x27;s name and bears a star below the crescent.

==History==
Psara has been inhabited since the Mycenaean period, its inhabitants relying on the sea to make a living as the island is treeless and rocky with little shrubbery.

Homer, Strabo, Cratinus, Suda and Stephanus of Byzantium referred to the island as &quot;Psyra&quot; () and &quot;Psyrian&quot; ().
The island had a city also called Psyra.

The islanders&#x27; sole source of livelihood has always been fishing, mainly for the locally abundant slipper lobsters, and shipping, with some tourist development in recent years.

The Greek ancient proverb &quot;Psyra celebrating Dionysos&quot; () originated from the fact that Psyra was a poor and small island which could not produce its own wine, and was used in reference to people who were reclining at a symposium but not drinking. Another ancient Greek proverb, &quot;You regard Sparta as Psyra&quot; (), also expressed the poverty of the island.

During the Middle Ages Psara had a very small population, which abandoned the island for Chios after the Fall of Constantinople. Between the 14th and second half of the 15th century, a small group of Albanians settled on the island and developed an Arvanite community, but it was quickly assimilated into the local Greek population. In the 16th century, under the Ottoman rule, the Psariots who had previously left, returned to their homeland along with other settlers and established a settlement around the Palaiokastro fort which they repaired. They turned to trade, amassing great profits. By the beginning of the 19th century the Psariots had the third largest trade fleet in Greece after Hydra and Spetses, numbering some 45 ships.

==Destruction==

Psara joined the Greek War of Independence on April 10, 1821. Future Prime Minister Konstantinos Kanaris, Dimitrios Papanikolis, Andreas Pipinos and Nikolis Apostolis distinguished themselves as naval leaders, using fire ships to combat the more powerful Ottoman Navy. Psara&#x27;s native population of people was further augmented by refugees from Thessaly, Macedonia, Chios, Moschonisia and Kydonies.

On July 3 (June 21 O.S.), 1824, the island was invaded by the Turks. The resistance of the Psariots ended the next day with a last stand at the town&#x27;s old fort of Palaiokastro (alternative name &quot;Mavri Rachi&quot;, literally &quot;black ridge&quot;). Hundreds of soldiers and also women and children had taken refuge there when an Ottoman force of stormed the fort. The refugees first threw a white flag with the words &quot;Ἐλευθερία ἤ Θάνατος&quot; (&quot;Eleftheria i Thanatos&quot;, &quot;Freedom or Death&quot;). Then, the moment the Turks entered the fort, the local Antonios Vratsanos lit a fuse to the gunpowder stock, in an explosion that killed the town&#x27;s inhabitants along with their enemies — thus remaining faithful to their flag to their death. A French officer who heard and saw the explosion compared it to a volcanic eruption of Vesuvius.

A part of the population managed to flee the island, but those who did not were either sold into slavery or killed. As a result of the invasion, thousands of Greeks met a tragic fate. The island was deserted and surviving islanders were scattered through what is now Southern Greece. Theophilos Kairis, a priest and scholar, took on many of the orphaned children and developed the famous school the Orphanotropheio of Theophilos Kairis. Psara remained in the hands of the Ottomans until it was recaptured by the Greek navy on 21 October 1912 during the First Balkan War.

<doc id="739423" wikidata="Q2706504" url="?curid=739423" title="Riyad Pasha">
<text>Riyad Pasha GCMG (1835 or 1836–1911) was an Egyptian statesman. His name can also be spelled Riaz Pasha and Riyāḍ Bāshā (). He served as Prime Minister of Egypt three times during his career. His first term was between September 21, 1879 and September 10, 1881. His second term was from June 9, 1888 to May 12, 1891. His final term lasted from January 17, 1893 to April 16, 1894.

==Origin and ascension==
Riyad was of a Circassian family, but was said to be of Jewish ancestry. Little is known of his early life, except that, until the accession of Isma&#x27;il Pasha to the Khedivate of Egypt in 1863, he occupied a humble position.

Ismail, recognizing in this obscure individual a capacity for hard work and a strong will, made him one of his ministers, to find, to his chagrin, that Riyad was also an honest man possessed of a remarkable independence of character. When Ismail&#x27;s financial straits compelled him to agree to a commission of inquiry, Riyad was the only Egyptian of known honesty sufficiently intelligent and patriotic to be named as a vice-president of the commission. He filled this office with distinction, but not to the liking of Ismail.

Khedive Ismail, however, felt compelled to nominate Riyad as a member of the first Egyptian cabinet, when, as a sop to his European creditors, he assumed the position of a constitutional monarch in 1878. For the few months this government lasted (September 1878 - April 1879) Riyad was minister of the interior. When Ismail dismissed the cabinet and attempted to resume autocratic rule, Riyad fled the country.

==Administration==
Upon the deposition of Ismail, in June 1879, Riyad was sent for by the British and French controllers, and he formed the first ministry under Khedive Tawfiq. His administration, marked by much ability, lasted only two years, and was overthrown by the agitation which had Urabi Pasha as its figurehead. Riyad treated the beginnings of this movement as of no consequence. In reply to a warning of what might happen he said, &quot;But this is Egypt; such things do not happen; you say they have happened elsewhere, perhaps, but this is Egypt.&quot; He held the additional titles of Minister of Finance and Minister of Interior from 1879 to 1881. On the evening of 9 September 1881, after the military demonstration in Abdin Square, Riyad was dismissed; broken in health he went to Europe, remaining at Geneva until the fall of Urabi.

After Urabi&#x27;s fall, Riyad accepted office as minister of the interior under Muhammad Sharif Pasha. Had Riyad had his way, Urabi and his associates would have been executed forthwith; so when the British insisted that clemency should be extended to the leaders of the revolt, Riyad refused to remain in office as interior minister, resigning in December 1882.

He took no further part in public affairs until 1888, when, on the dismissal of Nubar Pasha, he was summoned to form a government. He now understood that the only policy possible for an Egyptian statesman was to work in harmony with the British agent, Sir Evelyn Baring (later known as Lord Cromer). This he succeeded in doing to a large extent, witnessing if not initiating the practical abolition of the corvée and many other reforms. The appointment of an Anglo-Indian official as judicial adviser to the khedive was, however, opposed by Riyad, who resigned in May 1891.

In January 1893, he again became prime minister under Abbas II, being selected as comparatively acceptable both to the khedivial and British parties. In April 1894 Riyad finally resigned office on account of ill-health.

==Personality==
Superior, probably, both intellectually and morally to his great rival Nubar, he lacked the latter&#x27;s broad statesmanship as well as his pliability. Riyad&#x27;s standpoint was that of the benevolent autocrat; he believed that the Egyptians were not fitted for self-government and must be treated like children, protected from ill-treatment by others and prevented from injuring themselves. In 1889 he was made an honorary GCMG. A worthy tribute to Riyad was paid by Lord Cromer in his farewell speech at Cairo on 4 May 1907.

: Little or no courage is now required on the part of a young Egyptian who poses as a reformer, but it was not always so. Ismail Pasha had some very drastic methods of dealing with those who did not bow before him. Nevertheless, some thirty years ago Riaz Pasha stood forth boldly to protest against the maladministration that then prevailed in Egypt. He was not afraid to bell the cat.

<doc id="739425" wikidata="Q123487" url="?curid=739425" title="Daniel Spoerri">
<text>Daniel Spoerri (; 27 March 1930 – 6 November 2024) was a Romanian-born Swiss visual artist and writer. Spoerri is best known for his &quot;snare-pictures,&quot; a type of assemblage or object art, in which he captured a group of objects, such as the remains of meals eaten by individuals, including the plates, silverware, and glasses, all of which are fixed to the table or board, which is then displayed on a wall. He also is widely acclaimed for his book, &quot;Topographie Anécdotée* du Hasard&quot; (&quot;An Anecdoted Topography of Chance&quot;), a literary analog to his snare-pictures, in which he mapped all the objects located on his table at a particular moment, describing each with his personal recollections evoked by the object. 
==Early life==

Spoerri was born Daniel Isaac Feinstein, on 27 March 1930, in Galați, Romania. Although his father, Isaac Feinstein, had converted from Judaism to Christianity, after Romania entered the War on the side of Nazi Germany he was arrested and killed in 1941. His mother, born Lydia Spoerri, was Swiss and was therefore able to emigrate with her family of six children to Switzerland in 1942. There, he was adopted by his maternal uncle Professor Theophil Spoerri and registered as Daniel Spoerri, a name he retained.

In the 1950s he was active in dance, studying classical dance with Olga Preobrajenska and in 1954 becoming the lead dancer at the State Opera of Bern, Switzerland. He later staged several avant-garde plays including Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot; and Picasso&#x27;s surrealist &quot;Desire Trapped by the Tail.&quot; During that period he met a number of Surrealist artists, including Jean Tinguely, Marcel Duchamp, and Man Ray, and also a number of artists subsequently associated with the Fluxus movement, including Robert Filliou, Dieter Roth, and Emmett Williams. In the late 1950s, Spoerri married Vera Mertz.

==Editions MAT==
In 1959 Spoerri founded Editions MAT (&quot;Multiplication d&#x27;art Transformable&quot;), a venture which produced and sold copies of three-dimensional constructed artworks by artists such as Marcel Duchamp, Dieter Roth, Jean Tinguely, and Victor Vasarely. One of the best known works produced by Editions MAT was Man Ray&#x27;s Indestructible Object. Spoerri is credited with coining the term &quot;multiples&quot; for such works.

==Snare-Pictures (Tableaux-Pièges)==
In 1960, Spoerri made his first &quot;snare-picture&quot;. Spoerri later explained snare-pictures as follows: &quot;objects found in chance positions, in order or disorder (on tables, in boxes, drawers, etc.) are fixed (‘snared’) as they are. Only the plane is changed: since the result is called a picture, what was horizontal becomes vertical. Example: remains of a meal are fixed to the table at which the meal was consumed and the table hung on the wall.&quot; His first &quot;snare-picture&quot;, &quot;Kichka&#x27;s Breakfast&quot; was created from his girlfriend&#x27;s leftover breakfast. The piece is now in the collection in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. One snare-picture, made in 1964, consists of the remains of a meal eaten by Marcel Duchamp. This work holds the auction price record for Spoerri, selling for €136,312 ($200,580) in January 2008, distantly followed by another snare-picture from 1972, which sold for €44,181 ($69,860) in April 2008.

==&quot;An Anecdoted Topography of Chance&quot;==
 In connection with a one-man show of his snare-pictures at the Galerie Lawrence in Paris in 1962, Spoerri wrote his &quot;Topographie Anécdotée* du Hasard&quot; (Anecdoted Topography of Chance). Spoerri was then living at the Hotel Carcassonne in Paris, in room number 13 on the fifth floor. To the right of the entrance door was a table which his wife Vera had painted blue. Spoerri drew on a ‘map&quot; the overlapping outlines of all the 80 objects that were lying on the table on 17 October 1961 at exactly 3:47 p.m. Each object was assigned a number and Spoerri wrote a brief description of each object and the memories or associations it evoked. The descriptions cross referenced other objects on the table which were related. The &quot;Topographie Anécdotée* du Hasard&quot; was printed as a small pamphlet of 53 pages plus a fold out map and index and was distributed as an advertisement for the exhibit. The &quot;Topographie Anécdotée* du Hasard&quot; is more than just a catalog of random objects, however; read in its entirety, it provides a coherent and compelling picture of Spoerri&#x27;s travels, friends, and artistic endeavors.

&quot;The Anecdoted Topography of Chance&quot; has been called a &quot;quasi-autobiographical &quot;tour de force&quot;.&quot; In 1966, the Something Else Press in New York City published an English translation of the &quot;Topographie Anécdotée* du Hasard&quot; by Emmett Williams, entitled &quot;An Anecdoted Topography of Chance (Re-Anecdoted Version)&quot;. Roland Topor added sketches of each object and additional annotations were added &quot;at random&quot; by Williams and others and by Spoerri himself. A number of appendices were added to the work and a greatly expanded index. The &quot;Topographie Anécdotée* du Hasard&quot; became a cult classic and was published in German translation by Dieter Roth in 1968 as &quot;Anekdoten zu einer Topographie des Zufalls&quot;. Roth increased in fact the volume of the book by almost a third by adding his own poetic annotations. In 1990, the original French version was reprinted by the Centre Pompidou in Paris, and in 1995, an expanded English version was published by the Atlas Press in London, with additional material and annotations, and all of Dieter Roth&#x27;s texts.

==New Realism==
Spoerri was one of the original signers of the manifesto creating the Nouveau réalisme (New Realism) art movement, an avant garde endeavor begun in 1960. His use of everyday life as the main subject-matter of his art reflects his involvement in the New Realism movement.

==Fluxus==
Spoerri is also closely associated with the Fluxus art movement, a movement formed in the early 1960s, &quot;characterized by a strongly Dadaist attitude, [whose] participants were a divergent group of individualists whose most common theme was their delight in spontaneity and humor.&quot; It has been said that his &quot;Anecdoted Topography of Chance&quot; &quot;seems perfectly to embody aspects of its spirit.&quot;

==Eat Art==
A major theme of Spoerri&#x27;s artwork is food, and he called this aspect of his work &quot;Eat Art.&quot; One form of food art has been his &quot;snare-pictures of eaten meals.&quot; As mentioned earlier, in a &quot;snare-picture&quot; related to food, Spoerri might take the leftovers of a meal on a table, mount the leftovers to the table, using, for one thing, a special spray, and hang the table on a wall, turning it from a horizontal surface to a vertical one. Additionally, for example, in 1961, he sold in an art-gallery in Copenhagen store-bought canned food which he had signed and rubber-stamped &quot;Attention: Work of Art.&quot; In 1963, he enacted a sort of performance art called &quot;Restaurant de la Galerie J&quot; in Paris, for which he cooked on several evenings. Art-critics took over the role of waiters, playing on the idea of the critic bringing the art to the consumers and giving them an understanding of the work. On June 18, 1968, Spoerri opened the Restaurant Spoerri in Düsseldorf, and on September 18, 1970, he opened the Eat-Art-Gallery upstairs. He also published in 1970, a diary of his life on the Greek island of Symi, in which he included numerous recipes of the dishes he ate there. Originally titled &quot;A Gastronomic Itinerary&quot;, it was later republished under the title &quot;Mythology &amp; Meatballs&quot;.

==Subsequent work==
Spoerri continued to make snare-pictures, including snares of eaten meals, into the 1990s. He also created assemblage works, mounting objects on reproductions of 19th century medical illustrations as backgrounds. Spoerri also produced serigraph and bronze versions of his works.

Spoerri led a nomadic life, living variously in Bern, Paris, the Greek island of Symi, Düsseldorf, Basel, Munich, and Vienna. In 1997, he moved to the Tuscan town of Seggiano where he opened &quot;Il Giardino di Daniel Spoerri&quot; (the Garden of Daniel Spoerri), a sculpture garden, where works by a number of artists are displayed.

==Death==
Spoerri died on 6 November 2024, at the age of 94.

<text>Mahmoud Sami Al Baroudi (; June 11, 1839 – December 11, 1904) was a significant Egyptian political figure, and a prominent poet. He served as 5th Prime Minister of Egypt from 4 February, 1882 until 26 May, 1882. He was known as &quot;rab alseif wel qalam&quot; رب السيف و القلم (&quot;lord of sword and pen&quot;). His father belonged to an Ottoman-Egyptian family while his mother was a Greek woman who converted to Islam upon marrying his father.

== Works ==
He wrote more than 370 poems, for instance: &quot; Everyone who is alive, will die.&quot; (In Arabic:كُلّ حيّ سيموت).

<text>LZX is an LZ77 family compression algorithm, a slightly improved version of DEFLATE. It is also the name of a file archiver with the same name. Both were invented by Jonathan Forbes and Tomi Poutanen in the 1990s.

==Instances of use of the LZX algorithm==
===Amiga LZX===
LZX was publicly released as an Amiga file archiver in 1995, while the authors were studying at the University of Waterloo in Canada. The software was shareware, which was common for compression software at the time. The registered version contained fixes and improvements that were not available in the evaluation version. In 1997, the authors gave away a free keyfile, which allowed anyone to use the registered version, as they had stopped work on the archiver and stopped accepting registrations.

===Microsoft Cabinet files===
In 1996, Forbes went to work for Microsoft, and Microsoft&#x27;s cabinet archiver was enhanced to include the LZX compression method. Improvements included a variable search window size; Amiga LZX was fixed to 64 KB, and Microsoft LZX could range on powers of two between 32 and 2048 kilobytes (32,768 to 2,097,152 bytes). A special preprocessor was added to detect Intel 80x86 &quot;CALL&quot; instructions, converting their operands from relative addressing to absolute addressing, thus calls to the same location resulted in repeated strings that the compressor could match, improving compression of 80x86 binary code. (This technique is later generalized as Branch-Call-Jump [BCJ] filtering.)

===Microsoft Compressed HTML Help (CHM) files===
When Microsoft introduced Microsoft Compressed HTML Help, the replacement for their classic Help file format, they chose to compress all of the HTML data with the LZX algorithm. However, in order to improve random access speed, the compressor was altered to reset itself after every 64 kilobyte (65,536 bytes) interval and re-align to a 16-bit boundary after every 32 kilobyte interval. Thus, the HTMLHelp software could immediately seek the nearest 64 kilobyte interval and start decoding from there, rather than decoding from the beginning of the compressed datastream at all times.

===Microsoft Reader (LIT) files===
Microsoft LIT files for Microsoft Reader are simply an extension of the CHM file format, and thus also use LZX compression.

===Windows Imaging Format (WIM) files===
Windows Imaging Format, the installation/drive image file format of Windows Vista and Windows 7, uses LZX as one of the compression methods.

=== CompactOS NTFS file compression ===
In Windows 10, LZX compression from Windows Imaging Format is used for the new CompactOS NTFS file compression.

===Xbox Live Avatars===
Microsoft uses LZX compression on Xbox Live Avatars to reduce their disk and bandwidth requirements.

==Decompressing LZX files==
The unlzx program and XAD can unpack Amiga LZX archives. The cabextract program can unpack Microsoft cabinet files using the LZX method. There are a multitude of cross-platform tools for decompiling or viewing CHM files, as stated in the CHM article. LIT files can be unpacked using the Convert LIT software.

<text>Dwight Michael &quot;Dewey&quot; Evans (born November 3, 1951) is an American former professional baseball right fielder and right-handed batter who played with the Boston Red Sox (1972–1990) and Baltimore Orioles (1991) in Major League Baseball (MLB). He was a three-time All-Star, won eight Gold Glove Awards, and won two Silver Slugger Awards. Evans played the second-most career games for the Red Sox of any player, surpassed only by Carl Yastrzemski.

==Early years==

Evans was born in Santa Monica, California. He played Pony League and Colt League baseball in Northridge, California, with Doug DeCinces. Dwight attended Granada Hills High School in the tenth grade, but was not happy with the poor treatment he received from the baseball coaches. He then transferred to Chatsworth High School, from which he graduated in 1969.

==Playing career==
Evans was drafted in the fifth round of the 1969 MLB draft by the Red Sox, with the 107th overall pick, and then played in Boston&#x27;s minor league system from 1969 through 1972. He played for the Florida Instructional League Red Sox (1969), short season Class A Jamestown Falcons (1969), Single-A Greenville Red Sox (1970), Single-A Winston-Salem Red Sox (1971), and Triple-A Louisville Colonels (1972).

Evans acquired the nickname &quot;Dewey&quot; while playing for Winston-Salem in 1971. It was coined by manager Don Lock who had already called Don Newhauser &quot;Newie&quot; and another teammate &quot;Louie&quot;. In 1972, with Louisville, Evans was named MVP of the International League.

===Boston Red Sox===
Evans made his major league debut with the Red Sox on September 16, 1972, during a Red Sox 10–0 win over the Cleveland Indians. Evans appeared in a total of 18 games late in that season, batting 15-for-57 (.263) with one home run and six RBIs.

Early in his major league career, Evans was primarily a defensive standout (he would eventually receive eight Gold Glove Awards) with a modest bat. In the second half of his career, he became a powerful hitter, twice winning a Silver Slugger Award.

Originally, Evans was assigned uniform number 40, although quietly he really wanted to wear number 24, the number of his idol Willie Mays. In 1973, the Red Sox gave him number 24, the number he wore for the remainder of his career.

Evans was the Red Sox regular right fielder starting in 1973, a role he would have until 1987. In 1973 he batted .223 with 10 home runs and 32 RBIs, and in 1974 he batted .281 with 10 home runs and 70 RBIs. In 1975, the Red Sox won the AL East and then swept the Oakland Athletics in the 1975 ALCS. Evans batted 1-for-10 against Oakland, being held to a double in the first game. In the 1975 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds, Evans batted 7-for-24 (.292) with a home run and five RBIs. In the historic sixth game, with the score tied 6–6 in the 11th inning, he made a spectacular catch of a drive hit by Reds second baseman Joe Morgan, then threw to first base to complete an inning-ending double play. Then, Carlton Fisk hit his famous walk-off home run in the 12th inning to win the game for the Red Sox, 7–6, forcing a seventh game, which was won the next day by the Reds.

From 1976 through 1980, Evans batted an overall .260 with 94 home runs and 279 RBIs; he was limited to 73 games in 1977 by a knee injury; in each of the other years he appeared in at least 146 games. He was named an All-Star in 1978; he would be an All-Star twice more during his career. In 1981, despite the strike-shortened season, Evans had his best all-around year. He paced the league in total bases (215), OPS (.937), walks (85), times on base (208), and tied Eddie Murray, Tony Armas and Bobby Grich for the home run title with 22. He also ranked second in runs scored (84) and on-base percentage (.415), and third in slugging percentage (.522). He added a .296 batting average with 71 RBIs, was an All-Star for the second time, and received his first Silver Slugger Award.

On Opening Day of 1982, the Red Sox were visiting the Milwaukee Brewers, where Evans watched Sixto Lezcano&#x27;s famous walk off grand slam in the bottom of the Ninth sail over his head. Brewers announcer Bob Uecker called the homerun as follows: &quot;Here&#x27;s a drive to deep right-center, way back goes Evans. It&#x27;s got a chance to gooooo, GOOOONE !!!!!&quot;.

From 1982 through 1985, Evans batted an overall .274 with 115 home runs and 338 RBIs; in both 1982 and 1984 he played in every Red Sox game. On June 28, 1984, he hit for the cycle, in a 9–6 extra-innings win over the Seattle Mariners.

In 1986, Evans hit a home run on opening day, April 7, on the first pitch of the MLB season, as Boston and the Detroit Tigers were playing the first game that day. His home run eclipsed the mark held by the Chicago Cubs&#x27; Bump Wills, who hit the second pitch for a home run on April 5, 1982. Evans hit a home run on opening day four times during his career. The Red Sox went on to win the AL East, and defeated the California Angels in seven games in the 1986 ALCS; Evans batted 6-for-28 (.214) with a home run and four RBIs. Boston then lost the 1986 World Series to the New York Mets in seven games; Evans batted 8-for-26 (.308) with two home runs and nine RBIs. As recently as 2016, Evans has said publicly that he has never watched any highlight films of that World Series because the memory remains too painful for him to bear.

In 1987, at age 35, Evans recorded career highs in batting average (.305), home runs (34) and RBIs (123). He was named an All-Star for the third time of his career, won his second Silver Slugger Award, and finished fourth in MVP voting. Defensively, he started 77 games at first base, 71 games in right field, and four games as designated hitter (DH). In 1988, he batted .293 with 21 home runs and 111 RBIs, while starting 78 games in right field, 61 games at first base, and 6 games as DH. In 1989, he started 76 games in right field and 69 games at DH, while batting .285 with 20 home runs and 100 RBIs. In his final season with Boston, 1990, he started 121 games, all as DH, and batted .249 with 13 home runs and 63 RBIs. After the season ended, Evans was released by the Red Sox.

In his 19 years with Boston, Evans batted .272 with 379 home runs and 1,346 RBIs in a total of 2,505 games played. Only Carl Yastrzemski played more games for the Red Sox (3,308). Evans won eight Gold Gloves, two Silver Sluggers, and three All-Star honors.

===Baltimore Orioles===
Evans signed a one-year contract with the Baltimore Orioles on December 6, 1990. He batted .270 with six homers and 38 RBIs in 101 games in his only season with the Orioles. Based on his uncertain medical status, Evans was released by the Orioles in spring training on March 15, 1992.

===Career stats===
In his 20-year career, Evans batted .272, with 385 home runs, 1384 RBIs, 1470 runs, 2446 hits, 483 doubles, 73 triples, and 78 stolen bases in 2606 regular season games. He compiled a .986 fielding percentage. In postseason batting, Evans batted .239 with four home runs and 19 RBIs, in 32 games played. In three All-Star Game appearances, Evans batted an overall 3-for-5, and had two walks and one run scored.

Evans earned a reputation as an outfielder with one of the strongest arms in the American League. For his career, he had 157 outfield assists, including 15 in 1975, 1976 &amp; 1979 and 14 in 1978.

==Post-playing career==
Evans spent two seasons as an MLB hitting coach; 1994 with the Colorado Rockies, and 2002 with the Red Sox. Evans was named a Player Development Consultant for the Red Sox in 2003; , he was still listed in that role by the Red Sox.

In 2000, Evans was inducted to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame.

===Hall of Fame consideration===
Evans was dropped from the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot when he did not receive the minimum five percent of votes in his third year of eligibility. Evans received 5.9% in , 10.4% in , and 3.6% in . Evans&#x27; low vote total in 1999 is attributed to the appearance of future Hall of Fame players Nolan Ryan, George Brett, Robin Yount, and Carlton Fisk on the 1999 ballot. Based on his win shares metric, baseball statistician Bill James has argued that Evans is a worthy candidate for induction. In 2016, Evans commented, &quot;I just don&#x27;t understand the mentality of the voting.&quot; In November 2019, Evans was included as a Modern Baseball Era finalist as part of the 2020 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting. To gain admission to the Hall, finalists must obtain 75 percent of the votes from its 16-member Modern Baseball Era Committee; Evans received eight votes, falling short of the threshold by four votes. In January 2021, Evans was ranked 10th by Joe Posnanski of &quot;The Athletic&quot; in a listing of the 100 greatest eligible players not in the Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Evans and his wife, Susan, have three children; Timothy, Kirstin, and Justin. Their youngest child, Justin, died in April 2019 at age 42 of complications from neurofibromatosis. Their son Timothy died ten months later from complications of the same disease. Evans and his wife have been long-time supporters of the non-profit organization Neurofibromatosis Northeast. Both Justin and his brother, Timothy, were diagnosed with the disease in the 1980s.

Evans&#x27; grandson, Ryan Berardino, was drafted by the Red Sox in the 34th round of the 2019 Major League Baseball draft out of Bentley University. Berardino&#x27;s other grandfather is former player and coach Dick Berardino.

In 2011, Evans appeared in the Farrelly brothers film &quot;Hall Pass&quot; as Maggie&#x27;s father.

<doc id="739442" wikidata="Q240312" url="?curid=739442" title="Symphony No. 5 (Vaughan Williams)">
<text>Ralph Vaughan Williams wrote his Symphony No. 5 in D major between 1938 and 1943. In style it represents a shift away from the violent dissonance of his Fourth Symphony, and a return to the gentler style of the earlier &quot;Pastoral Symphony&quot;.

Many of the musical themes in the Fifth Symphony stem from Vaughan Williams&#x27;s then-unfinished operatic work, &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. This opera, or &quot;morality&quot; as Vaughan Williams preferred to call it, had been in gestation for decades, and the composer had temporarily abandoned it at the time the symphony was conceived. Despite its origins, the symphony is without programmatic content.

The work was an immediate success at its premiere in 1943, and is frequently performed in concert and on record.

==History==

===Background===
In 1935 Vaughan Williams had caused surprise and even shock with his Fourth Symphony, a strident and dissonant piece in great contrast with its quiet and contemplative predecessor, &quot;A Pastoral Symphony&quot; (1922). After this he experienced a temporary writer&#x27;s block, before he began writing his Fifth Symphony in 1938. He had been working intermittently for more than thirty years on what became his opera (or &quot;Morality&quot;) &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. Believing that the opera might never be completed he decided to incorporate some of its ideas and themes into other works, most notably the Fifth Symphony.

The symphony was complete enough by the end of 1942 for the composer to prepare a two-piano transcription, which two friends played for him in late January 1943. Any doubts he had about the piece were allayed when he heard the first orchestral run-through on 25 May. He found that the symphony said what he meant it to.

===Dedication===
Vaughan Williams dedicated the symphony to Jean Sibelius. The musicologist J. P. E. Harper-Scott has called Sibelius &quot;the influence of choice&quot; among British symphonists in the years between the two World Wars, citing Walton&#x27;s First Symphony, all seven of Bax&#x27;s and the first five of Havergal Brian. The wording of the dedication differs between the manuscript and the published score: the ascription on the manuscript reads &quot;Dedicated without permission and with the sincerest flattery to Jean Sibelius, whose great example is worthy of all imitation&quot;; this was abbreviated on the published score to &quot;Dedicated without permission to Jean Sibelius&quot;. The lack of &quot;permission&quot; may have resulted from problems of communication during World War II, given that Finland was at war with the Soviet Union, a British ally, at the time. Sir Adrian Boult subsequently secured permission, corresponding with Sibelius through an intermediary (Kurt Atterberg) in a neutral country (Sweden). After listening to a broadcast of the work, Sibelius wrote to Atterberg, &quot;I heard Dr. Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27; new Symphony from Stockholm under the excellent leadership of Malcolm Sargent ... This Symphony is a marvellous work ... the dedication made me feel proud and grateful ... I wonder if Dr. Williams has any idea of the pleasure he has given me?&quot; 

The wording of the dedication led to speculation as to whether the work contains any direct quotations or imitations of Sibelius. Vaughan Williams made a study of Sibelius&#x27;s music, notably his Symphony No. 4, before working on his own Symphony No. 5. Similarities in orchestration are evident, such as the atmospheric string writing midway through the first movement of the Vaughan Williams work, noted in the following section. A case for an actual quotation has been made by Robert Matthew-Walker, who notes a subtle similarity in the opening bars of the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies of Sibelius and Vaughan Williams, respectively, concealed by the contrasting moods of the two pieces (in each case, the motif spanning a tritone C–D–F is followed by the repeated interval E–F over a pedal C).

==Composition==
The symphony is scored for two flutes (one doubling piccolo), oboe, cor anglais, two clarinets, two bassoons, two French horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani and strings. This is a smaller orchestra than Vaughan Williams used in his four earlier symphonies, with only two horns, no tuba, no harps and no percussion except timpani. The symphony is in the customary four-movement form. The composer provided metronome markings for all four movements, but they are widely regarded as dubious: the composer did not observe them when he conducted the work, and he expressed approval of Boult&#x27;s tempi, which were similar to his own. His musical assistant Roy Douglas has suggested that Vaughan Williams simply miscalculated because he did not possess a metronome.

In addition to the &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; allusions, the score has echoes of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s hymn tune &quot;Sine nomine&quot;, in the second subject of the first movement and at the end of the fourth movement.

===I: Preludio===
The first movement, in Frank Howes&#x27;s analysis (1954), can be seen either as &quot;an elaborate ternary form with coda&quot; or &quot;an exposition of two big groups of themes succeeded without development by a condensed recapitulation&quot;. This movement owes something to sonata form, but does not display all its characteristics; the second subject has been derived from the first subject. The movement opens with a pedal C in the bass, answered by a horn call outlining a D major chord in a dotted rhythm, which implies mixolydian D. &lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; { \new PianoStaff « \new Staff \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key g \major \tempo &quot;Moderato&quot; 4 = 80 r2 &lt;fis d&gt;4.\p( &lt;e a,&gt;8 | &lt;fis d&gt;4. &lt;e a,&gt;8 &lt;fis d&gt;2) } \new Staff \relative c { \clef bass \key g \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 &lt;c c,&gt;1~ | &lt;c c,&gt;2. s4 } » } &lt;/score&gt; The violins use the notes of the pentatonic scale, making the key ambiguous. Wilfrid Mellers believes this is why Vaughan Williams billed the movement as a Preludio, &quot;which suggests an emergent state&quot;. The horn call motif fluctuates from major to minor, outlining the tonal ambiguity, moving between the mixolydian and dorian modes, which becomes a characteristic of the movement. The bass&#x27;s C pedal becomes the tonic when the key changes to either the aeolian or dorian modes. The modality then moves to E, with a new melody in the violins, which, although it does not include a sharpened seventh, outlines E major. The bass, now played pizzicato, supports the melody both melodically and harmonically and the texture incorporates suspensions and passing notes, making the harmony richer. A sudden descent of a semitone, an idea previously used in Vaughan Williams&#x27;s works Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis and &quot;&quot;, marks a key change to three flats and also the development section.

The tempo accelerates to allegro for the development. The strings are used to imply the winds of nature, in a similar vein to that of Sibelius. This is punctuated by the brass and woodwind with the falling semitone motif, which gets larger intervallically to a major second and then a minor third. This section is a canon; the polyphony of which Mellers believes shows the randomness of nature. The key shifts down mediants, until it reaches D minor, when the strings imitate Sibelius again, this time using tremolo effects.

For the recapitulation the tempo slows and the dynamics are reduced. The C pedal is reintroduced, but this time in a more melodic fashion. There is more development in the recapitulation. The movement ends in a similar way to the opening, with the horn call, but the key signature of two flats rather than one sharp is used. The bases descend to C via E, leaving the tonality of the movement still in question.

Arnold Whittall argues that &quot;With respect to D Major, the Preludio might be regarded as a clear case of Schoenbergian &#x27;Schwebende Tonalität&#x27; (&#x27;fluctuating: suspended, not yet decided&#x27; tonality)&quot;, although Vaughan Williams stated that Schoenberg&#x27;s music meant nothing to him.

===II: Scherzo===
Vaughan Williams uses rhythm in the Scherzo to convey different effects. The focus of the movement is centred on the rhythm rather than the ambiguous tonality of the Preludio. Lionel Pike comments that &quot;at times it seems more like a counterpoint of rhythms than of pitches.&quot; The movement begins with three dotted minims in a fast time ( = 120), and then minims for four bars, which create hemiolas and then crotchets. This gives the illusion that the music is accelerating, and so the pulse does not settle. When the melodic line begins, the music is divided into five bar phrases. A sense of stability is established when the theme is repeated by the viola and double bass in stable two bar phrases. However the violins enter with phrasing that does not conform to either pattern, thus adding more confusion. Using this rhythmic phrasing, the dorian line played on the violins and the aeolian woodwind line are differentiated rhythmically, as well as tonally. The rhythmical confusion is halted when the wind and strings alternate downward runs antiphonally.

===III: Romanza===
In the manuscript score Vaughan Williams headed this movement with words taken from Bunyan:
&lt;poem&gt;
 Upon that place there stood a cross
 And a little below a sepulchre … Then he said
 &quot;He hath given me rest by his sorrow and
 Life by his death&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
The third and fourth lines were later sung in the opera by Pilgrim. The inscription was omitted from the published score in accordance with the composer&#x27;s wish that the symphony should be regarded as absolute music. The movement may be considered the spiritual core of the work: Frank Howes calls it &quot;the heart of the symphony&quot; and David Cox calls it &quot;a profound meditation on the three main musical elements presented at the outset&quot;. It is not clear why the composer called it &quot;Romanza&quot;. Howes comments that with its spiritual, meditative nature there is nothing &quot;romantic&quot; about this movement; Michael Kennedy observes that with Vaughan Williams the term &quot;is always a signal that the music was of special significance to him&quot;.

The opening cor anglais solo is taken virtually without change. &lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \clef treble \time 3/4 \tempo &quot;Lento&quot; 4 = 66 r4 \times 2/3 { c8\p(-- c-- c-- } c-- d-- | e2) e4( | g4. f8 e[ d] | e d e4) fis( | g f! e8 d | e2)~\&gt; e8\! } &lt;/score&gt; Rising fourths again appear as connecting passages.

===IV: Passacaglia===
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c { \clef bass \time 3/4 \key d \major \tempo &quot;Moderato&quot; 4 = 120 d\p( b8 a e&#x27;4 | d2 cis4) | b( a8 fis e4 | b&#x27;2 a4) | g4( fis8 e d4 | e b&#x27; a) | b2( cis4) | d } &lt;/score&gt;
Although this movement begins with the repetitive bass line characteristic of the passacaglia form, Vaughan Williams eventually abandons it. The triumphant primary melody of the passacaglia is used as Pilgrim&#x27;s dialogue with Interpreter in the second half of &quot;The House Beautiful&quot; scene, while the fanfare motif recalls of &quot;The Arming of the Pilgrim&quot; in Act II Scene 1. This ushers in a return of the themes from the first movement of the symphony, which are resolved into a quiet valediction played first by the woodwind and then by the upper strings.

==Premieres and publication==
The Fifth Symphony was premiered on 24 June 1943 at a Prom concert in the Royal Albert Hall, London, by the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by the composer. Sir Henry Wood, the founder and presiding figure of the Proms, was originally intended to conduct the performance but was not well enough and the composer was persuaded to take the baton. The American premiere was given in Carnegie Hall on 30 November 1944 by the New York Philharmonic under Artur Rodziński.

The score of the symphony was published by Oxford University Press (OUP) in 1946. Vaughan Williams lightly revised the score in 1951, but that revision was not published during his lifetime. It was published in 1961, re-engraved with corrections in 1969, and in 2008 OUP issued a new edition, edited by Peter Horton, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the composer&#x27;s death.

==Reception==
In a survey of Vaughan Williams&#x27;s nine symphonies, Elliott Schwartz writes:

Hubert Foss comments that public appreciation of the symphony &quot;was more immediate than that of perhaps any other single work by the composer&quot;.

The response of music critics was generally enthusiastic. The anonymous reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that the symphony &quot;belongs to that small body of music that, outside of late Beethoven, can properly be described as transcendental … this is music not only of contemplation but of benediction&quot;. A grudging note was struck by William Glock, a proponent of avant-garde music, who commented in &quot;The Observer&quot; that the symphony was &quot;like the work of a distinguished poet who has nothing very new to say, but says it in exquisitely flowing language&quot;. Neville Cardus wrote, &quot;The Fifth Symphony contains the most benedictory and consoling music of our time.&quot; When the first recording came out in 1944 (see below) &quot;The Observer&quot; was more welcoming than Glock had been the year before, saying that the Fifth was to the Fourth Symphony as &quot;The Tempest&quot; is to &quot;King Lear&quot; … ideal beauty.&quot;

After its premiere at a Prom concert in June 1943, the symphony was given in each of the following four seasons, conducted by Boult (1944 and 1947) and Basil Cameron (1945 and 1946). Eighteen further performances were given in subsequent Prom seasons between 1949 and 2020. In 1994 the composer Anthony Payne wrote of the symphony:
==Recordings==
The symphony was first recorded within a year of the premiere, under the auspices of the British Council. More than thirty recordings have been issued subsequently.

<text>The Nimbus is a Danish motorcycle produced from 1919 to 1959 by Fisker and Nielsen of Copenhagen, Denmark, also manufacturers of &quot;Nilfisk&quot; brand vacuum cleaners (now Nilfisk). Three basic models were produced, all with a 750 cc four-cylinder, air-cooled in-line engine.

==History==
In partnership with Hans Marius Nielsen, Peder Andersen Fisker produced electric motors, some electric tools and from around 1910, the first electric vacuum cleaners in Europe. However, Nielsen was not keen to develop this line and the partnership was dissolved. Fisker believed he could produce a motorcycle superior to that generally available and in late 1918 constructed a prototype to his own design.

===&quot;Stovepipe&quot;===

The first Nimbus motorcycle had a four-cylinder inline engine of capacity, which drove the rear wheel through a shaft drive rather than the belt usually used at that time and had a power output of approximately 10 hp. Its top speed was around with a sidecar fitted. It had front wheel leading link sprung suspension and a technically advanced rear wheel swinging arm arrangement. The machine soon acquired the nickname of &quot;Kakkelovnsrør&quot; (&quot;Stovepipe&quot;) due to the large diameter, round pipe between the saddle and handlebars which as well as forming the top tube of the bike’s frame, served as the fuel tank. Two more machines were constructed in 1919, but series production did not begin until &#x27;Fisker &amp; Nielsen&#x27; became a limited liability company in 1920. 

Disappointed by poor sales of the Type &#x27;A&#x27; machine, Fisker began entering the Stovepipe in all the races that he could, often with a sidecar attached and built up a good reputation for the model. The &#x27;Stovepipe&#x27; was technically improved along the way, mainly in details, but also with the two main types of fronts forks, which distinguished the Type &#x27;A&#x27; (shown) from the Type &#x27;B&#x27; which had trailing links. However, the introduction of a sales tax on motorcycles in 1924 and an economic recession resulted in production being discontinued from 1926 after some 1,300 machines had been produced.

===Type C===
With his son Anders, Fisker started designing a new machine in 1932 and in 1934 they demonstrated a new Nimbus motorcycle, the Type &#x27;C&#x27;. This retained the shaft drive but had a completely redesigned ohc engine (distinguished by its exposed valves) of 18 (later 22) hp fitted in a frame made from 40mm X 8mm steel flat bar using riveted construction. The frame was shaped to go around the fuel tank, much like the pressed steel frames on several other motorcycles of the period, e.g. Zündapp and BMW. Front suspension was by telescopic fork with the pressed steel handlebars forming the top yoke; although these forks were introduced a year before the BMW R12, the R12&#x27;s fork had hydraulic damping upon introduction whereas the Nimbus&#x27;s forks did not have hydraulic damping until 1939. Its distinctive humming exhaust note led to it being nicknamed &quot;Humlebien&quot; (&quot;Bumblebee&quot;).

The first customer received his Type &#x27;C&#x27; in the summer of 1934 and thanks to an efficient dealer network, the &quot;Bumblebee&quot; soon became the best-selling motorcycle in Denmark. The Danish Post Office, Army and Police purchased substantial numbers of this model and in 1939 as war loomed, the Danish government spent DKK 50 million on motorising the army and many Type &#x27;C&#x27;s were included in this expenditure.

During the occupation by German forces from 1940 to 1945, it was difficult for Fisker &amp; Nielsen to obtain the materials needed for motorcycle production and only about 600 machines were made during this period.

Shortly after World War II, an ohv engine was built and tested. However, given that the factory had no difficulty in selling every motorcycle it could manufacture, it was decided not to make any major investments in new tooling for a successor model. Instead, for 1948 the front forks were redesigned and minor improvements were introduced to the existing model, it usually being possible to upgrade existing models. The Danish Army bought around 20% of Fisker &amp; Nielsen&#x27;s total production and this, no doubt, influenced the decision not to introduce a Type &#x27;C&#x27; replacement; the military would be unlikely to want an enlarged spares inventory to support an additional model. 

The Postal Service bought many Type &#x27;C&#x27; models, using them as recently as 1972. The Danish police force also was a large fleet customer but phased out their Nimbuses in the late 1950s and early 1960s when they became too slow to keep up with modern cars and motorcycles; the top speed of a stock solo bike was only , and that for brief bursts only. Almost none were exported.

In the 1950s some further prototypes were built, including a four-cylinder engine with rotary valves and carbon seals as well as a two-cylinder model with sprung rear suspension; neither of these reached production. Anders Fisker, who spent the final years of his life in poor health and no longer with the enthusiasm to propel new ideas into quantity production, died in 1964.

Many detail features of the &quot;Bumblebee&quot; were changed during its lifespan; e.g. a switch from hand to foot gear change and larger brakes (150mm to 180mm). Nevertheless, the basic design was never altered and as interest in motorcycles declined in the late 1950s due to the increasing availability of cheap cars such as the Volkswagen Beetle and the Fiat 500, production ceased in 1959 when the last contract from the army was delivered.

The Nimbus now has attained almost iconic status, not only in Denmark but also abroad where its very individual character makes it a machine of unusual technical and visual interest.

==Surviving examples==
Of around 12,500 &quot;Bumblebees&quot; produced, today more than 4,000 are registered and running in Denmark alone with likely a few hundreds used outside Denmark - mainly in Sweden, Germany and a few in the US. Other Type &#x27;C&#x27; examples exist, either in museums or not currently registered for road use.

Even today, most spare parts (although not &quot;tinware&quot;) are readily available as well as being relatively inexpensive. Thanks to the design&#x27;s inherent reliability, using a Nimbus on a daily basis is still considered easy and economical. Nevertheless (and with some notable exceptions), today most Nimbus owners rarely ride more than a few thousand kilometers a year. Also, as the Nimbus often came from the factory with a sidecar attached, many of the ones on the road have recently been fitted with such as this combination was very popular with sole traders.

==In popular culture==
The 1948 short film by the great Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer, &quot;De nåede færgen&quot; &quot;(They Made it to the Ferry&quot;), is regarded by film enthusiasts as a masterpiece of suspense and rhythm. Though it was formally an educational short flick about road safety, the young couple involved in a race with death (a sinister grim reaper figure driving recklessly an old fashioned hearse-style sort of van) while speeding to catch the Nyborg ferry in time, is riding a 1948 Type &#x27;C&#x27; Nimbus 750 sports model. The rider&#x27;s brag for 120 km/h top speed to a young petrol pump maid may be over-optimistic for this kind of workhorse, especially with a passenger on the pillion seat, but the couple nevertheless finally take the ferry over River Styx...in twin coffins.

<text>The Corinium Museum, in the Cotswold town of Cirencester in England, has a large collection of objects found in and around the locality. The bulk of the exhibits are from the Roman town of Corinium Dobunnorum, but the museum includes material from as early as the Neolithic and all the way up to Victorian times.

Opened on 26 November 1974 by the Duke of Gloucester, the museum has a collection of 2nd- and 4th-century Roman mosaic floors and carvings, as well other Roman objects, large and small. Additionally there are displays covering prehistory, the Iron Age, Saxon and medieval Cirencester and the wool trade.

The building, which was built in the mid 18th century, was previously a house. It is a Grade II listed building

<doc id="739458" wikidata="Q6872489" url="?curid=739458" title="Miracle of the gulls">
<text>The miracle of the gulls is an 1848 event often credited by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for saving the second harvest of the Mormon pioneers in the Salt Lake Valley. While absent in contemporary accounts, later accounts stated seagulls miraculously saved the 1848 crops by eating thousands of insects that were devouring their fields. The first crop was planted in 1847 a few days after the pioneers entered the valley, which was very late in the growing season and produced a meager but usable harvest. Next spring, using seed from the first harvest, they planted their second crop, only to watch in dismay as the crickets attacked. Less than two years earlier, in October 1846, many of them were saved by quail that flew into their camp, on their trek to the Great Salt Lake and made available as food.

==Traditional story==

After Brigham Young led the first band of Latter-day Saints into what is now Salt Lake City, Utah, the pioneers had the good fortune of a relatively mild winter. Although late frosts in April and May destroyed some of the crops, the pioneers seemed to be well on their way to self-sufficiency. However, large swarms of insects appeared in the valley beginning in late May.

These insects, now called &quot;Mormon crickets&quot; because of this incident, are not true crickets, but instead belong to the katydid family. Having ornamental wings, they are unable to fly, but instead can travel in huge swarms. Mormon crickets eat all plant material in their path, but they also eat any insects that die on the way, including their own species. They are known to cyclically swarm in some areas of the Mountain West, especially in Utah, Nevada, and southern Idaho. These insects threatened the livelihood of the Mormon pioneers; stomping on the pests did not dissuade them from entering farms as others would advance. This is a reproductive strategy similar to mast reproduction in oaks, overwhelming predators with sheer numbers allowing a percentage of the population to survive to reproduce. Latter-day Saints often cast this disaster in Biblical terms like the 8th plague of locusts.

According to traditional accounts, legions of gulls appeared by June 9, 1848, following fervent prayers by the pioneer farmers. It is said that these birds, native to the Great Salt Lake, ate mass quantities of crickets, drank some water, regurgitated, and continued eating more crickets over a two-week period. The pioneers saw the gulls&#x27; arrival as a miracle, and the story was recounted from the pulpit by church leaders such as Orson Pratt and George A. Smith (; ). The traditional story is that the seagulls annihilated the insects, ensuring the survival of some 4,000 Mormon pioneers who had traveled to Utah. For this reason, the Seagull Monument was erected and the California gull is the state bird of Utah.

==Historical review==

In 1970, William Hartley published an article about the 1848 cricket war. The following section is a summary of the opinions and research he put forward in that article. 

* Seagulls did come and eat many of the crickets in 1848. Contemporary records describe the event as a blessing from God; Henry Bigler upon hearing of the event a few months after the fact in 1849 recorded that: [...] all looked upon the gulls as a God send, indeed, all acknowledged the hand of the Lord was in it, that He had sent the white gulls by scores of thousands to save their crops, 
* The church&#x27;s First Presidency, while mentioning the crop damage, frost, and crickets, made no mention of the gulls in their official summary of the first few years of the Mormons living in the Salt Lake Valley. Gulls regularly returned to feast on the crickets for years afterwards. 
* Records predating the arrival of the Mormon pioneers show that various types of gulls, including the California gull, inhabited the Great Salt Lake area. These gulls fed on various insects, including crickets.
* Gulls regurgitate the indigestible parts of insects, similar to how an owl regurgitates pellets. While this behavior seemed strange to the pioneers, it is normal for gulls.
* The crickets did major damage to the crops prior to the arrival of the gulls. Then after the arrival of the gulls, even after weeks of the gulls feasting on the crickets, the crickets were still a massive problem.
* The damage to the crops in 1848 was due to frost, crickets, and drought, and the gulls only had a minor impact on one of those factors.
* With that said, the gulls did have a real effect in alleviating the suffering of the 1848 Mormon pioneers, both physical and psychological: The fact remains, nonetheless, that the 1848 Mormon pioneers would have suffered more than they did, had not the gulls come to their aid. Physically, the gulls helped avert a complete agricultural disaster; the amount of crickets which thousands of gulls could consume in two or three weeks would be a staggering figure. And the birds did relieve hardpressed farmers from ardous toil against the crickets. More importantly perhaps, the gulls provided mental and emotional rejuvenation. Undoubtedly threats of leaving for California were diminished by the sudden appearance of the gull flocks...The &#x27;Miracle of the Gulls&#x27; story remains appropriate as an expression of the faith held by Mormon pioneers and their descendants.

<text>Karl J. Lieberherr is a professor of Computer Science at Northeastern University, in Boston.

He did his studies at ETH Zurich, obtaining an M.S. in 1973 and a Ph.D. in 1977.

He wrote the first book about adaptive programming. The work on this theme was one of several secondary influences on the development of aspect-oriented programming.

Adaptive programming tries to create applications that are easy to maintain and evolve, creating a new abstraction layer in the design and implementation of Object-Oriented Applications. This concept takes encapsulation to a new level allowing changes in the way an object works without changing the interface with other objects. This technique solves the situations where an object takes assumptions about how other objects work and a change in this object takes down that assumption creating a chain effect in the rest of the system.

Aspect oriented programming affects the way an application is created. Following the directives of this concept, one could create separate objects that treat data and process in a separated way. This allows a flexible application that can change and evolve easily.

<text>The ASEAN Championship (formerly known as the AFF Championship or the AFF Cup), currently known as the ASEAN [[Mitsubishi Electric]] Cup for sponsorship reasons, is the biennial football tournament organized by the ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) for men&#x27;s national teams in Southeast Asia.

A biennial international competition, it is contested to determine the sub-continental champion of Southeast Asia. The competition has been held every two years since 1996, scheduled to be in the even-numbered year, except for 2007, and 2020.

Four national teams have won the ASEAN Championship title; Thailand has won seven titles, Singapore four, Vietnam three, and Malaysia one. To date, Thailand and Singapore are the only teams to have won consecutive titles. Thailand did it three times: in 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2020, and 2022, while Singapore did it once in 2004 and 2007. Australia, an AFF member outside Southeast Asia, has not played the ASEAN Championship due to the initial agreement. It is one of the most watched football tournaments in the region. The ASEAN Championship has also been recognized as an official tournament by FIFA since 7 December 2024, having previously been recognized as a Category A tournament since 2016.

Since 2018, the championship winners would compete in the following AFF–EAFF Champions Trophy, against the winner of the EAFF E-1 Football Championship (East Asia).

The defending tournament champions are Vietnam, after a 5-3 aggregate victory over Thailand in the 2024 ASEAN Championship final

==History==
The first ASEAN Championship took place in 1996 with the six founding members of the ASEAN Federation competing with four nations being invited that came in that region. The final saw Thailand becoming the first champions of ASEAN as they defeated Malaysia 1–0 in Singapore. The top four nations automatically qualified through to the finals in the following edition. This meant the other six nations had to compete in qualifying for the remaining four spots. Myanmar, Singapore, Laos and Philippines all made it through to the main tournament. The tournament has been the only regional competition for national teams since men&#x27;s football at the SEA Games was for U23 in 2001. No country has ever won the AFF Championship title three times in a row. Singapore (2004 and 2007) and Thailand (2000 and 2002 and again in 2014 and 2016) have won twice in a row.

Although having joined the AFF on 27 August 2013, Australia, a member outside Southeast Asia, has not played the ASEAN Championship as part of the initial agreement, though Australia has started searching for ways to enter the tournament in recent years due to growth of various Southeast Asian national teams, due to internal pressures, and due to Southeast Asian interests in seeing more competitive football to improve consistency.

==Organisation==
Sports marketing, media, and event management firm, Sportfive (formerly Lagardère Sports) has been involved in the tournament since the inaugural edition in 1996.

===Title sponsorship===
It was founded as the Tiger Cup, after Singapore-based Asia Pacific Breweries brand Tiger Beer sponsored the competition from its inauguration in 1996, until the 2004 edition. After Asia Pacific Breweries withdrew as title sponsor, the competition was known simply as the AFF Championship for the 2007 edition. In 2008, Japanese auto company Suzuki bought the naming rights for the competition, and the competition was named the AFF Suzuki Cup until the 2020 edition. On 23 May 2022, AFF announced a new title sponsorship deal with Japanese company Mitsubishi Electric and the competition was named the AFF Mitsubishi Electric Cup starting in the 2022 edition.

On 29 February 2024, AFF and Mitsubishi Electric, who is the title partner of the championship, launched a new logo and brand identity for the event. As part of the rebranding, the region’s premier competition formerly known as the AFF Mitsubishi Electric Cup was also renamed to the ASEAN Mitsubishi Electric Cup.
==Format==
Since 2004, the knockout stage has been played over two legs in a home-and-away format. Since the 2007 edition, there was no third-place match; semi-finalists are listed in alphabetical order. The away goals rule has been applied for the knockout stage since the 2010 edition. 

Starting with the 2018 edition, a new format was applied. The nine highest-ranked teams qualified automatically while the 10th and 11th ranked teams played in a two-legged qualifier to determine the final team to qualify. The 10 teams were split into two groups of five and played a round-robin system, with each team playing two home and two away fixtures. A draw was made to determine where the teams play while the format of the knockout round remained unchanged.

<text>1632 (2000) is an alternate history novel by American author Eric Flint, the initial novel in the best-selling series of the same name.

The flagship novel kicked off a collaborative writing effort that has involved hundreds of contributors and dozens of authors. The premise involves a small American town of three thousand, sent back to May 1631, in Holy Roman Empire during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

==Plot summary==

In the fictional town of Grantville, West Virginia (modeled on the real West Virginia town of Mannington), Mike Stearns, former boxer and president of the local chapter of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), attends the wedding of Mike&#x27;s sister when a large &quot;ring of fire&quot; transports a hemispherical section of land about three miles in radius measured from the town center from April 2000 to May 1631, from North America to the central Holy Roman Empire. The town is thrust into the middle of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, in the German province of Thuringia in the Thuringian Forest, near the fictional German village of Badenburg. Once the Ring of Fire dissipates, Mike Stearns and several UMWA members arm themselves and travel to the outskirts of town to investigate, where they rescue a farmer&#x27;s family from being raped and killed by mercenaries. Shortly afterward, they rescue Jewish nobleman Balthazar Abrabanel and his daughter, Rebecca, from marauding soldiers who are part of Count Tilly&#x27;s army. 

Having to confront the surrounding raging war, language barriers, and numerous social and political issues, the people of Grantville elect Mike their temporary leader and elect a provisional council, including Rebecca, to create policies to promote farming, increase energy output, and restart the mining of natural resources in the town in preparation for winter. A battalion of Scottish mercenaries sent by Sweden to find the Abrabanels discover Grantville and quickly align themselves with the Americans, hoping to defend the village of Badenburg from an approaching division of Tilly&#x27;s soldiers. The Americans and Scots devastate the Catholic soldiers with their modern weaponry and take the survivors prisoner, bringing them and other German refugees into Grantville to act as farmers and manual labor, exposing them to modern culture and democracy in the process, which they celebrate with the marriage of Jeff Higgins, a young American soldier, to Gretchen, a villager rescued from Brandenburg. 

Three months later, as Grantville prepares for winter with their new Scot and German allies, King Gustavus Adolphus leads the Swedish army to victory over Tilly&#x27;s forces in the Battle of Breitenfeld outside of Leipzig, rapidly moving the war theater to Franconia and Bavaria, just south of Grantville. Mike leads the new U.S army to the nearby village of Jena, where they quickly defeat a legion of soldiers who broke off from Tilly&#x27;s retreat and enticed the city into joining the new United States of Europe. Mike and the council draft a new constitution and hold elections in Grantville, where Mike and the other council members are elected to their current roles. Rebecca, now Mike&#x27;s wife, is elected Grantville&#x27;s senator and chief diplomat. Winter passes by quickly for Grantville, as trade with nearby towns and increased food production prevent any starvation, and the immigration of German merchants and Rebecca&#x27;s wealthy relatives to the town increased Thuringia&#x27;s population and wealth substantially.

By April of 1632, the United States has grown to incorporate several neighboring cities as new states, catching the attention of King Gustavus. Rebecca leads a delegation to meet with Gustavus at the Lech river, who, upon realizing the U.S.&#x27;s wealth and power, happily accepts an alliance and trade deal with the new nation. Using micrometers provided by the Americans for improving his artillery, Gustavus is able to defeat Tilly&#x27;s army on the other side of the Lech, killing him and routing his army. 

Meanwhile, Cardinal Richelieu of France, upon hearing of the U.S.E., becomes greatly disturbed at the prospect of a Swedish power base in central Europe. To fight this, Richelieu works with Albrecht von Wallenstein, head of the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s imperial army, to destroy Grantville, removing Sweden&#x27;s main financial and logistical base in the continent. Wallenstein sends a mediocre imperial division and directs a Spanish brigade to the towns of Suhl and Eisenach to distract the American army while a Croat mercenary force enters Grantville and massacres the population. Mike leads the U.S army in a siege against the Spanish army, while Rebecca and Jeff narrowly survive a Croat scout force, allowing them to warn the town. The heavily armed townspeople massacre a Croat force sent into the town and several Americans are killed when the main Croat force storms the barricaded high school, though they are saved by the townspeople and a Swedish brigade led by Gustavus under the guise of the soldier &quot;Captain Gars&quot;.

Mike and Rebecca sit down with Gustavus and decide to unite Sweden&#x27;s German territories into the Confederated Principalities of Europe (CPoE) under the Swedish throne, though the U.S.E at its center is allowed to maintain its autonomy. A month later, after a joint U.S.-Swedish force storm Burgstall and successfully kill Wallenstein, the CPoE is formed as Rebecca gives birth to her and Mike&#x27;s daughter.

==Reception==
&quot;F&amp;SF&quot; reviewer Charles de Lint received the novel favorably, describing it as &quot;a fine, thoroughly engaging story about real people in an extraordinary situation.&quot;

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called the book a &quot;[s]inewy shoot-&#x27;em-up, with pikes and muzzle-loaders squared off against modern automatics and 20th-century tactics: a rollicking, good-natured, fact-based flight of fancy that should appeal to alternate-history buffs as well as military-fantasy fans.&quot;

A reviewer for the Tech Republic called the book &quot;relentlessly positive, celebrating honest, hardworking folk of two eras who come together to make a better world&quot; and should &quot;appeal to fans of many subgenres&quot;. The reviewer also wrote that &quot;Flint succeeds at making the whole adventure palatable by populating his tale with thoughtful, likeable, fallible characters with well drawn motivations.&quot;

RT Book Reviews called the novel &quot;an outstanding, positive reading experience for those who appreciate living history, indomitable courage and the unsung gallantry of the everyday man.&quot;

&quot;Library Journal&quot; praised the author, saying he &quot;convincingly re-creates the military and political tenor of the times in this imaginative and unabashedly positive approach to alternative history.&quot;

A reviewer for SFRevu wrote &quot;1632 is a fun read and marks Flint as an author to watch for&quot;.

In contrast to the other reviews, the reviewer for The New York Review of Science Fiction criticized the book for being &quot;almost pure mind candy&quot; by appearing to be a comedy at times and later appearing to be very serious work by &quot;seriously explore anachronism shock by injecting highly dramatic, life-altering decisions filled with much introspection&quot; at other times.

&quot;1632&quot; was listed on the &quot;Locus&quot; Hardcovers Bestsellers List for two months in a row during 2000, topping at number 4, and also later on the Paperbacks Bestsellers List for a single month in 2001 at number 3.

As of February 2020, twenty years after it was first released, the book has remained in print while still generating small annual royalty payments to the author for print copies sold even though free electronic copies have also been available directly from the publisher for most of that time.

==Legacy==

The book generated an unusual amount of fan involvement. When first contemplating a sequel, Flint decided to throw open the universe—perhaps instigated by reception of fan-fiction on 1632 Tech Manual—and invited other authors to help shape the series milieu and fictional canon and began putting together the anthology Ring of Fire.

The market for anthologies in fiction is but a small percentage of the market for novels, and the alternate history genre is a smallish niche to begin with—leading publisher Jim Baen to &quot;hold up&quot; the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; collection to see if the series would get a boost from New York Times best selling author David Weber, who had just contracted to do five novels with Flint. Flint had to set aside several planned projects (the Assiti Shards novels were in outline form at the time) and do some additional co-writing with Weber as &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; gestated.

<text>The Susan River (, &quot;bush creek&quot;) is a northeastern California river of approximately length that drains from an arid plateau of volcanic highlands along the Great Basin Divide to intermittent Honey Lake. The river flows from eastern Lassen County from east of Lassen Volcanic National Park generally east past Susanville and emerging into a ranching valley to enter the north end of Honey Lake. Along with Fredonyer Pass, the Susan River is the northern boundary of the Sierra Nevada.

==History==
Susan River and the town of Susanville were named for Susan Roop, daughter of early settler Issac Roop, in 1857.

==Watershed==
Susan River begins at Caribou Lake at elevation , which is dammed by Caribou Lake 234 Dam. It flows eastward, curving southeasterly as it enters the Great Basin, where it is joined on the left by Bridge Creek and dammed to form McCoy Flat Reservoir, approximately 11 miles northwest of Susanville. It next receives order from the right (heading downstream) Crazy Harry Gulch, Willard Creek, and Williams Creek before entering Susanville, where it receives Piute Creek from the left. Below Susanville, it receives from the left Gold Run Creek, Lassen Creek and Sand Slough, the latter at Johnstonville. At Johnstonville, the Lake Leavitt Inlet Canal diverts Susan River flows south to Lake Leavitt. After being joined by Willow Creek from the left, the Susan River passes below Litchfield and is extensively modified by a complicated system of canals and levees for irrigation of the surrounding ranching areas. Next, the river reaches the Honey Lake State Wildlife Area and finally Honey Lake itself at elevation .

<doc id="739486" wikidata="Q266452" url="?curid=739486" title="Percy Cox">
<text>Major-General Sir Percy Zachariah Cox, (20 November 1864 – 20 February 1937) was a British Indian Army officer and Colonial Office administrator in the Middle East. He was one of the major figures in the creation of the current Middle East.

==Family and early life==

Cox was born in Harwood Hall, Herongate, Essex, one of seven children born to Julienne Emily ( Saunders) Cox and cricketer Arthur Zachariah Cox ( Button). He was educated initially at Harrow School where he developed interests in natural history, geography, and travel. In February 1884, being his father&#x27;s third son and therefore without significant inheritance, Cox joined the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and was commissioned as a Lieutenant into the Cameronians, joining their 2nd Battalion in India. In November 1889, an outstanding planner, he transferred to the Bengal Staff Corps. On 14 November 1889 he married Louisa Belle, youngest daughter of Irish-born surgeon-general John Butler Hamilton.

==British Somaliland and Muscat (1893–1903)==
After holding minor administrative appointments in Kolhapur and Savantvadi in India, Cox was posted to British Somaliland, which was then administered from India, as Assistant Political Resident at Zeila. He transferred to Berbera in 1894. He was promoted to captain in February 1895. In May 1895 he was given command of an expedition against the Rer Hared clan, which had blocked trade routes and was raiding the coast. With only 52 Indian and Somali regulars and 1,500 poor quality, untrained local irregulars, he defeated the Rer Hared in six weeks. Later that year 1895, he was promoted to be assistant to the Viceroy of India&#x27;s agent in Baroda.

For 1899 he had intended to join the US expedition under A Donaldson Smith between the River Nile and Lake Rudolf, but in October 1899, the new Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon appointed Cox Political Agent and consul at Muscat, Oman, inheriting a tense situation between the British, French and Arabs who regarded the area as under their influence. The French had leased a coaling station from Sultan Feisal, the local ruler, for the French Navy. The French also gave protection to the local slave trade, which the British opposed. Feisal was ordered by the British under Cox to board the British merchantman SS &quot;Eclipse&quot;, whose guns were trained on his palace and reprimanded and informed that his annual subsidy could be withdrawn by the British government.

Cox managed to successfully end French influence in the area; turning the subsidy around, and agreeing that Feisal&#x27;s son could receive an education in England and visit the Delhi Durbar. When Lord Curzon, visited Muscat in 1903, he judged that Cox virtually ran the place. Cox was promoted to the rank of major on 6 February 1902, and was invested Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire; whereas Feisal was rewarded for loyalty with Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire in Curzon&#x27;s gift.

==Political Resident in Persian Gulf (1904–1919)==
In June 1904, Major Cox was appointed first British Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and Consul-General for Fars province, Lurestan and Khuzestan and the district of Lingah, residing in the Persian side of the gulf at the city of Bushehr. He began a remarkable correspondence and friendship with Captain William Shakespear, appointed Cox&#x27;s deputy Political Resident to Persia. Their frank exchange of views at Bandar Abbas was a major element of pre-war policy in the near east. Cox considered peace the priority, in the maintenance of good relations with the Ottomans, who held all the tribal loyalties, whilst prompting India to change policy towards Ibn Saud, the Wahhabi ruler of Nejd and later king of Saudi Arabia, from 1906.

One of the few allies was Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait, whose shared intelligence eventually aided the desert war. Cox was assiduous with his briefs: he prepared in great detail, in fluent Arabic, when he wrote Shaikhs. Warned by the former ambassador to Constantinople of Turkish escalation; preparations were made to make Arabian friends. British forces were called into Bushehr in 1909, and then again to Shiraz in 1911. Cox promised Sheikh Khazal of Muhammarah that troops would protect when the Turks threatened to invade. Khazaal leased the Shatt al-Arab waterway on the Euphrates to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for the construction of refineries. In 1910 Cox wrote a full report on Shakespear&#x27;s findings to India, which was passed to London. He was promoted to Lieutenant-colonel in February 1910. Cox promoted trade in the Persian Gulf which doubled between 1904 and 1914, suppressed the illegal arms trade; and improved communications. In 1911 he was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1908 oil fields were discovered in the region of Abadan. On 16 July 1909, after secret negotiation with Cox, assisted by Arnold Wilson, Sheik Khaz&#x27;al agreed to a rental agreement for the island including Abadan.

He was confirmed as Resident, a post which he occupied highly successfully until 1914, when he was appointed Secretary to the British Raj. Cox feared reprisals in Arabia would make the tribes turn towards Germany. But the Foreign Office was engrossed with events in Europe. Among his other achievements while at Bushire was the establishment of the state of Kuwait as an autonomous kaza within the Ottoman Empire by the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913, where he improved relations with local ruler, Mubarak, by opening negotiations with Ibn Saud.

The Turks signed a treaty in London on 29 July 1913 concerning Royal Navy patrols in the Persian Gulf littoral, when Cox met then at the Port of Uqair on 15 December 1913. Cox noted their &quot;intractability&quot; and also warned the Foreign and Commonwealth Office about Ibn Saud; the &quot;increased authority of the Wahhabi Chief&quot;. Captain Shakespear&#x27;s letter had passed via Riyadh to the Suez Canal in which his secret War-camp negotiations with Ibn Sa&#x27;ud, had revealed the latter&#x27;s deep hatred of the Turks, who brutalised his people and threatened his ancestral rights. Shortly after his return to India, Sir Percy was sent back to the Persian Gulf as Chief Political Officer with the Indian Expeditionary Force when World War I broke out in August 1914, still with a brief to prevent Turkish entry on the German side. The Islamic Jihad to crush the British and seize Mesopotamia coincided with Turkey&#x27;s declaration of war in October 1914.

Ibn Saud&#x27;s mortal enemy, Ibn Rashid, was in the Turkish coalition. Cox sent his deputy to protect Ibn Saud, whose army was attacked at the Battle of Jarrab on 19 January 1914. Shakespear was in command of the artillery when he was charged down and killed in the melee. Sir Percy received immediate authorisation to draft a Treaty of Khufaisa with the Wahhabi ruler with the aim of forming a broader Arab alliance. By April 1915 Cox was based at Basrah where he received a significant Treaty between Ibn Saud and his enemy Ibn Rashid; partition of Arabia in a spirited alliance to rid the peninsula of the Ottomans. They finally met on Boxing Day 1915 at Darin, an island of Tarut, in the bay of Qatif, just north of Bahrain, where they signed the Treaty of Darin.

===A local difficulty in Mesopotamia===
Cox was Secretary to the Government of India, its chief civil servant, and third in order of precedence. He was despatched to the Gulf as Chief Political Officer with the rank of honorary major-general. The arrival of General Nixon from Simla was &quot;shabby...jobbing&quot; as the military build-up enclosing India&#x27;s plan to capture Baghdad troubled the veteran political time-servers, morally responsible to humanity and to civilization.

For want of a more bland administration, Cox complained to Viceroy Lord Curzon that Barrett, whom Nixon replaced, had not wanted to go to Amara in pursuit of a policy of annexation. In a surprise attack upriver on Qurna before midnight on 6 December 1914, Commander Nunn and a small fleet managed to link up with Brigadier Fry&#x27;s units of the 45th to force the Turk to surrender; ultimately, by land and by sea, a typical pincer movement in combined operations enabled only 45 officers and 989 men to take a garrison of 4,000 men. At 1.30 pm on 9 December, Sir Percy and Fry took the formal handover from Head of Vilayet, Vali of Basra, Subhi Bey, ending the Battle of Qurna. Cox was not one for sentimentality: but the Turkic rulers had been guilty of several barbarisms: stoning women, and severing thieves&#x27; hands off; traitors and spies were buried up to their necks in sand.

During 1915 he saw action with Major General Charles Townshend&#x27;s expeditionary force. Throughout the Great War Cox masterminded the Imperial relationship with Turkic Mesopotamia/Iraq. By December 1915, Townshend&#x27;s division had been defeated at Battle of Ctesiphon and retreated to be besieged in Kut al-Amara. Cox left with Brigadier Leachman&#x27;s cavalry brigade sent back to Basra. General Townshend came to hate &quot;this accursed country&quot;; fly-blown. Historians point to his brilliant defence of the fort at Chitral on the North-West Frontier in 1895, as evidence of suitability for appointment. Townshend, although promised a relief force from Nixon, knew that it was an unrealistic prospect. Although substantial redoubts were constructed during September to December 1915, the cross-river route remained vulnerable to attack. Townshend blamed Cox for the failure to evacuate civilians in time. Cox was firmly against exposing them to the winter cold. In this assessment he was supported by Arnold Wilson, who wrote that a general was not competent to judge what protection civilians needed. On reflection Cox suggested that the 500 departing unit should turn back; but Colonel Gerard Leachman told him the roads being drenched and muddy were impassable. These men had left on 6 December to be transported downriver to safety. 2,000 would-be fit cavalry men and officers remained behind with the infantry.

==Influence in Iraq==

Aged 25, Cox first travelled in the Middle East. In 1915 he was sent by the British army to negotiate: On 6 October he met Leachman at Aziziyeh to discuss how to free Baghdad. An emissary was sent into the city to see Nuri al-Said. The Iraqi commander in the pay of the Ottomans was responsible to Talaat Pasha, one of the Young Turks whose coup d&#x27;état had seized power in Constantinople/Istanbul. Cox was deeply sceptical about &quot;conciliating with the Arabs&quot;.

Nuri&#x27;s Basra Reform Society were negotiating with Cox when the British appointed the violent and intemperate Sayyid Talib as governor of the province. He was eager to work with the Imperial forces, but was deeply unpopular with local Shias. Cox ordered Talib and Nuri to be arrested; they were promptly deported to prison in India for treasonous attempts to stir up revolt. The general turned statesman-diplomat disapproved of army plans to extend the autonomous region; advising against plans to invade into the interior, which he knew to be fraught with dangers. In January 1915, Sir John Nixon&#x27;s appointment to head a new division with orders from Shimla encouraged the diplomat to draft a similar text for General Nixon that launched the fateful mission to Kut al-Amara. &quot;This would create endless problems for Great Britain...&quot; wrote Gerard Leachman in March 1915, explorer, traveller from India.

Cox early on spotted the important alliance that lay with Ibn Saud. In his capacity as the senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office official, Cox received secret intelligence reports on Ottoman troop movements. In his dealings he was &quot;stoic, patient and tolerant, never allowing any hint of frustration no matter how perverse the commands of his government or the action of his people...&quot;.

In January 1915, he was alerted to the Banu Lam and Bani Turuf tribes mobilising for war, declaring Jihad in Persia. Cox was confident that &quot;Qurna was strong&quot; and would hold against an assault. It was imperative to protect the oil pipelines into the Gulf at Abadan; the government ordered a brigade to this duty. Cox was well aware from his own experiences of the vulnerability of the frontier. He was highly respected as a quick, efficient, tireless and energetic soldier-diplomat, as well as being incorruptible. He held a genuine interest in local people, the Arabs and Persians, and was a shrewd and patient listener. As a politician he was a good speaker of Arabic and Turkish. But he knew when to shut up: he kept silent often in the Bedu presence, yet knew when to speak up, which impressed the Arab sensibilities. To Gertrude Bell he became an indispensable and close friend; whom she fondly admired.

By 1914, Cox was a champion of Arab nationalism, working closely with Gertrude Bell, and T. E. Lawrence to that end. During April 1916, Kitchener offered a series of blatant bribes up to £2 million via General Halil &quot;to the people of Kut&quot;, disgusted Cox left with Leachman&#x27;s cavalry brigade sent back to Basra. Gertrude Bell reported she was staying with Sir Percy and Lady Cox in March 1916, living next door to the Military GHQ. On 8 March, Cox had returned from Bushire wherefore gathering intelligence. By May, George Lloyd had joined the unit from London because their work was &quot;political not military,&quot; the &quot;Egyptian link&quot; being with the new Arab Bureau.

===Triumph and capture of Baghdad===
Cox&#x27;s main priority was to protect and prevent Ibn Saud from joining the Turkish side in the war. He met the Arab Sheikh at Al-Ahsa Oasis where a Treaty was signed guaranteeing a subsidy of £5,000 per month. Cox knew that Sir Mark Sykes was the champion of Sharif Husein, a rival candidate for the desert kingdoms. The delicate diplomatic balance arose as General Maude took Baghdad in March 1917; and Allenby Jerusalem that December. Taking part in the campaigns in Mesopotamia and Palestine, he was promoted to Honorary Major-General in May 1917. During this time he established strong relations with Ibn Saud, the powerful ruler of the Nejd, with whom he had already had dealings while Resident, and when he gained the nickname Kokus.

For the next year Cox was of central importance to the Government of Baghdad, living in a large house where he entertained high society Sheikhs; the arrival of Fahad Bey, Sheikh of Amareh, and others instilled confidence in the British Residency. On 8 September 1918, he visited Tehran, for the first time. The negotiations largely completed Cox was installed as Britain&#x27;s first ambassador at Tehran in November 1918. At the end of hostilities with the Ottoman Empire, Cox was appointed Acting Minister in Tehran, negotiating the Anglo-Persian Agreement. That winter he returned to Europe, attending the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919.

==Appointment as High Commissioner of Iraq and Iraqi Revolt (1920)==
Following the Iraqi Revolt of 1920, British colonial administrators felt a more effective and cheaper method to rule the area would be to create an Iraqi government in which British influence was less visible. It was in this environment that Sir Percy Cox took up residence in Baghdad as the first High Commissioner under the Iraqi Mandate, travelling via Kut el-Amara.

Later, reflecting on Britain&#x27;s new policy and the difficulties involved, Cox wrote to Lady Bell: The task before me was by no means an easy or attractive one. The new line of policy which I had come to inaugurate involved a complete and necessarily rapid transformation of the facade of the existing administration from British to Arab and, in the process, a wholesale reduction in the numbers of British and British-Indian personnel employed.

Acting as High Commissioner, Cox collaborated with former Ottoman officials and tribal, sectarian, and religious leaders and oversaw the creation of a largely Arab provisional government, or &quot;Council of State,&quot; with the purpose of seeing the young country through the turbulent period following the revolt. Cox selected as president the (Sunni) religious leader Abd Al-Rahman Al-Gillani, the Naqib of Baghdad. Council members were culled from local elites whom Cox felt could be relied upon to support the British agenda. The satisfactory functioning of this interim government allowed Cox to attend the Cairo Conference, convened by the new Colonial Secretary Winston Churchill in 1921.

==The 1921 Cairo Conference and the crowning of King Faisal==

Among the points Cox considered salient coming into the 1921 Cairo Conference was the reduction of British spending in Iraq and the selection of a ruler for the country. To satisfy the first item, Cox proposed a plan to cut immediately expenditure and withdraw troops from Mesopotamia. On the question of who should rule Iraq, Cox considered the best option to be one of the sons of the Sharif of Mecca, with whom the British had a special relationship during the war due to promises made during the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence. At the conference, the Sharif&#x27;s son Faisal emerged as the preferred choice, with Cox noting that Faisal&#x27;s military experience in World War I as well as his vast political skills made him the most qualified to raise an army and rule Iraq effectively.

Cox would later write that the decision in favour of Faisal was &quot;easiest to arrive at ... by the process of elimination,&quot; reasoning that local candidates for the throne would split the support of the major parties in Iraq while Faisal, as a result of his experience and his respected family name, would enjoy the &quot;general if not the universal support of inhabitants.&quot; After arranging an election of sorts of Faisal&#x27;s asking, Cox would go on to proclaim Faisal as King of Iraq on 23 August 1921 in Baghdad, upon which event the provisional cabinet formed by Cox resigned. ...For some time past letters have been passing between Sir Percy and Ibn Saud The Conquest of Hayil by the latter in November makes his frontiers continuous with the Iraq. Sir Percy is anxious to arrange a treaty between him and Faisal.

For his remaining years as the High Commissioner of Iraq, Cox continued to greatly influence Iraqi government and events in the country, using his power behind the throne to advise and put pressure on Faisal where necessary, including lavish festivities. On 2 June 1922, King Faisal&#x27;s court was entertained at the High Commissioner&#x27;s residency in Baghdad to celebrate the royal birthday. In his subsequent eulogy on his friend Gertrude&#x27;s death, Cox recalled that &#x27;On 20 April 1923 a treaty was signed with Turkey with proviso that &quot;Nothing in this Protocol shall prevent a fresh agreement from being concluded...and negotiations shall be entered into between them before expiration of the above period.&quot; The parenthesis did not preclude the uncovering and exposure of the fraudulent Protocols of the Elders of Zion, later used by the Nazis, which International Jewry explicitly refuted. Yet the San Remo Treaty with Turkey included explicit acceptance of the British Mandate of Palestine – the Zionist home land.

==Remaining term as High Commissioner of Iraq, Ambassador in Baghdad (1920–1923)==
King Feisal&#x27;s election had been confirmed by referendum in July 1921. British executive officers were removed from power. On 23 August 1922, King Faisal was struck with appendicitis and rendered unable to rule for several weeks. At this moment, a debate was raging over the nature and extent of British control over Iraqi affairs through treaty obligations. In perhaps the boldest action of his political career, Cox seized control and instituted direct British rule. Cox, in effect, became acting King of Iraq and undertook such measures as jailing and transporting those hostile to foreign intervention; silencing opposition parties and media; and even ordering the bombing of tribal insurgents.

Interpretation of these events varies greatly depending on the source: John Townsend writes that Cox&#x27;s actions &quot;demonstrated British infallibility, illusory though it might have been&quot; and that what transpired amounted to &quot;perhaps [Cox&#x27;s] greatest single achievement.&quot; Ahmad Shikara is not as kind, calling Cox&#x27;s measures &quot;severe and unpopular&quot; and noting that Faisal himself held &quot;strong objections to the High Commissioner&#x27;s actions.&quot; Cox&#x27;s own account contradicts, as he writes that not only were his actions necessary for the stability of the state, but that Faisal, upon recovery, &quot;thanked me cordially for the action taken during the interregnum.&quot; Whatever the case, Cox&#x27;s actions succeeded in preserving the status quo for the British, and Faisal resumed his rule in September after being a reluctant signatory to a twenty-year treaty.

==Acting Political Resident at Tehran==
Cox was the acting British Minister in Tehran when the Anglo-Iranian Agreement was concluded on 9 August 1919. He exchanged formal letters with Vosuq. The Iranians wanted three main concessions: territory, trade and tariff agreements all to be accepted. Iran did not necessarily share with Britain their multi-country approach to diplomacy. The first approach made to Britain was at the Paris Conference. The Iranians wanted to adopt Wilsonian self-determination principles.
The Empire provided loans, financial and military expertise, and infrastructure development e.g. building ports, harbours, bridges and railways. By the end of September 1919, the situation had worsened for the Whites, and so Vosuq approached the British embassy, while Firuz in Paris spoke to the British ambassador. In London Curzon warned the Russians off Iran, after Firuz&#x27;s visit had concluded only five days before on 15 October 1919. Vosuq would make himself the class enemy by siding with Britain. In October 1919 a special mission warned the Whites off Baku. And the following month Cox requested British troops to defend the province of Khorasan. Cox&#x27;s relations with the Persians were somewhat spare. On the one hand the vast country was supposedly acting as a barrier to Russian threats of invasion and Turkish activity in Mesopotamia, and on the other it was a long way from both India and London. The Foreign Secretary, Lord Curzon was forced to write to Cox on 17 May 1920, that there was little or no military help that could be sent to the small British mission.

Meanwhile, Britain attempted to secure guarantees from the Soviets that territorial integrity of Britain&#x27;s trading and military interests in the region would be respected. Curzon was far from happy that any negotiations should be entered with Soviet Russia. They could not be trusted, and so he simply failed to inform Cox that the Iranians would be negotiating a separate pre-arranged treaty. The Persians were themselves apprehensive about their own prospects; and Curzon typically toughed it out with stiff upper lip, reassuring Cox that things would work out. But Curzon thought that trade embargoes and sanctions were the way to put pressure on Russia. What was worse for Curzon, was Firuz contentment with turning instead to France for help. Their agreement was dubbed &quot;renversement des alliances&quot; – an oblique reference to the perceived snub to British interests. In Tehran they sang the praises of French Foreign Minister, Stephen Pichon. If Curzon was said to be arrogant, it was because he was more aware than most of the consequences for India of destabilizing the region by powers seeking the oil.

The new Prime Minister of Iran was now obliged to continue an agenda already set by his predecessor, to conclude the Anglo-Persian Agreement on Oil. But the British were posed with a constitutional impasse: how could Parliament ratify an agreement when the Russian invaders now occupied the territory? The Iranians were content to reciprocate by demanding the removal of British contingents, to be placatory to Moscow at the end of the year from 3 December 1920.

===A conclusion for the kingdoms of the east?===
The remainder of Cox&#x27;s term as High Commissioner was spent negotiating the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, years 1921 and 1922, which established &quot;the infant State of Iraq&quot;. Faisal&#x27;s objection to the British Mandate of Iraq and his insistence on formal independence were in need of a fine diplomatic touch. Britain wished to keep its interests alive in Iraq while at the same time appearing to have no control over its government..

To this end, Cox negotiated the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, which forced many of the original terms of the Mandate system on Iraq but avoided the term &quot;mandate&quot; and granted British protection to Faisal against rivals such as Ibn Saud. This treaty was signed on 10 October 1922; but not before an incident in August in the Palace grounds that amounted to an attempted coup d&#x27;état against the High Commissioner. In his absence the Naqib of Baghdad had signed a number of complaints for opponents. They were immediately arrested for treason. Shortly thereafter, Cox utilized his good relationship with Ibn Saud at Uqair to establish the boundaries between the Saudi kingdom, Iraq, and Kuwait in order to ensure that Britain would not have to defend Iraq from the Saudis. He was appointed GCMG. In her letters, the famed adventurer, archaeologist, and author Gertrude Bell writes of the effectiveness of Cox&#x27;s diplomacy: &quot;Ibn Saud is convinced that the future of himself and his country depends on our goodwill and that he will never break with us. In point of fact the treaty is on exactly the lines that Sir Percy stipulated.&quot; This was to be Cox&#x27;s final significant act as High Commissioner since he retired on 4 May 1923 and was succeeded by Sir Henry Dobbs, High Commissioner to the Kingdom of Iraq until 1929. He received a roving commission to be Plenipotentiary in the negotiations with Turkey over the border with northern Iraq. There was a great deal of animosity. The Turks resented British censoriousness over the alleged Armenian massacres of 1919, and the fate of the Kurds in Eastern Anatolia. Cox though was in contact with Halil Beg Bedir Khan and members of the Society for the Rise of Kurdistan and argued the Kurdish demands should be considered as well. The following year he was the Plenipotentiary at the Geneva Conference. He worked with Lloyd George in May 1925 framing the legal parameters for illegal arms shipments known as the Convention for Control of Arms Traffic. Oxford university awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Civil Laws in 1925, and then four years later Manchester university granted an Honorary Doctorate of Law.

==Relationship with Gertrude Bell==

Throughout his career in Iraq, Cox was in close connection with his aforementioned colleague Gertrude Bell. Their relationship seems unambiguously to be one of mutual admiration and respect. In her writing, Bell describes Cox as possessing an &quot;air of fine and simple dignity,&quot; praising his &quot;kindness and consideration,&quot; and claiming that his disposition towards her amounted to &quot;an absurd indulgence.&quot; Bell describes Cox&#x27;s political and diplomatic prowess, calling him &quot;a master hand at the game of politics.&quot; She notes the respect that he enjoyed with the peoples of Iraq and when writing about Cox&#x27;s dealings with Ibn Saud even declares, &quot;It&#x27;s really amazing that anyone should exercise influence such as his...I don&#x27;t think that any European in history has made a deeper impression on the Oriental mind.&quot; Cox, for his part, returns the high regard, referring to Bell&#x27;s &quot;indefatigable assistance&quot;. He continued...to the greater degree to which Gertrude enjoyed my confidence and I her devoted co-operation, a co-operation which I know from my successor she rendered with the same singleness of purpose for him – Sir Henry Dobbs that is.

==Marriage and children==
Lady Cox (Louisa Belle Cox, née Hamilton) was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 1923 Birthday Honours.

The couple&#x27;s only son, Derek Percy Cox, was killed in action in 1917 aged twenty one, and their only daughter died at birth. Their only grandchild was Derek&#x27;s son, Derek Percy Zachariah Cox (1918–1942), of the Royal Navy, formerly a flight lieutenant.

==Retirement and death==
After Cox&#x27;s departure from Baghdad, he was never again employed in any official position by the British government, but served as a delegate to several conferences. Cox devoted much of the rest of his life to the Royal Geographical Society, serving as its president from 1933 to 1936.

Sir Percy Cox died suddenly while out hunting at Melchbourne, Bedfordshire, in 1937. He apparently felt ill and dismounted, collapsing on the road beside his horse; by the time he was found by another huntsman, Lord Luke, he was already dead. The coroner recorded a verdict of heart failure.

<text>The K-tool, also known as a &quot;K-spreader&quot; or a &quot;K-tool spreader,&quot; is a specialized forcible entry tool used by firefighters to gain access to buildings or other structures in emergency situations. It is named for its distinctive &quot;K&quot; shape, which allows it to be used for a variety of purposes. It is used in conjunction with a Halligan bar and a flat-headed axe or maul (commonly referred to as &quot;irons&quot; or (with a maul instead of an axe) &quot;heavy irons&quot; ) to remove a cylinder lock with a protruding cylinder. It consists of a steel block roughly 3 inches by 3 inches by 1 inch thick with a K-shaped notch on one side, having sharp edges that grip the end of the cylinder, and a socket to fit the adze of the halligan bar on the other side. The notch is slipped over the lock cylinder, then forced down by striking with the flat side of the axe or maul. The cylinder is forced into the angle of the notch, between the &quot;leg&quot; and &quot;back&quot; of the K. The hard steel bites into the softer metal and provides the needed purchase. The halligan is then inserted into the socket and used to pry the K-tool off the door, thereby pulling the entire key cylinder out. The bolt is then retracted by reaching into the empty cylinder hole with a turning tool, such as a screwdriver.

Some cylinder locks include additional shields (outside and internally) that will make this type of entry more difficult and time-consuming, and there may be additional (non-cylinder) locks to deal with. Flush cylinder locks provide nothing for the K-tool to grab onto.

The K-tool can be used on most styles of door, although it is often faster to use the irons (combination of an axe and halligan tool) or a hydraulic ram on a solid door. The benefit of a K-tool comes where it is impractical or dangerous to break the door, for example, the large plate-glass doors in front of a commercial building will quickly yield to a well-placed blow from an axe, but may send fragments of glass flying, and will result in a pile of broken glass. The K-tool can be used to pull the core from the lock without damaging the door itself. The K-tool is also useful during investigations where no fire is readily evident. The core can be pulled from a lock, which can often be repaired at lower cost than replacing a door and jamb damaged by other, more energetic entry methods.

<doc id="739493" wikidata="Q1237299" url="?curid=739493" title="Southern France">
<text>Southern France, also known as the south of France or colloquially in French as , is a geographical area consisting of the regions of France that border the Atlantic Ocean south of the Marais Poitevin, Spain, the Mediterranean Sea and Italy. It includes southern Nouvelle-Aquitaine in the west, Occitanie in the centre, the southern parts of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes in the northeast, Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur in the southeast, as well as the island of Corsica in the southeast. Southern France is generally considered part of southern Europe because of its association with the Mediterranean Sea.

The term derives from (&#x27;middle&#x27;) and (&#x27;day&#x27;) in Old French, comparable to the term to indicate southern Italy, which is a synonym for south in Romanian, or which is a synonym for the south direction in Spanish. The time of midday was synonymous with south because in France, as in the rest of the Northern Hemisphere north of the Tropic of Cancer, the sun is in the south at noon. The synonymy has existed since Middle French as well; could refer to both &quot;midday&quot; and &quot;south&quot;. The Midi is considered to start at Valence, hence the saying (&quot;At Valence the Midi starts&quot;).

==Geography==
The area corresponds in large part to Occitania (&quot;Occitanie&quot;) in southern Europe, the historical and cultural region in which Occitan (), as distinct from the of northern France, was the predominant language. Despite being part of Occitania, the regions of Auvergne and Limousin are not normally considered part of southern France. The largest cities of southern France are Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Nice and Montpellier. The Pyrenees and French Alps are also located in the area, in respectively its southwestern and eastern parts. Corsica, which is south of Continental France and just north of Sardinia, Italy, may also be included.

==Tourism==
Notable touristic landmarks include the Roman-era Pont du Gard and the Arena of Nîmes; the Verdon Gorge, in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence; the Canal du Midi, linking Toulouse by to the Mediterranean Sea; and the natural regions of Larzac, Luberon and Camargue. The French Riviera is in southern France&#x27;s southeastern quadrant. Several towns in southern France are renowned for their architecture and surroundings, such as Roussillon, Ménerbes, Cordes-sur-Ciel, Gordes, Rocamadour, Rennes-le-Château, Les Baux-de-Provence, Lourmarin, Gassin, Saint-Paul-de-Vence, L&#x27;Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, Seillans, Crillon-le-Brave and Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.

==Cuisine==
Southern France has a cuisine that is different from those of northern France and other Mediterranean countries. The major difference from the rest of France is in the use of olive oil, instead of butter. Local agriculture supplies the olives for consumption as well as cooking, the ducks and geese to make foie gras, haricot beans that are used in cassoulet, the sheep whose milk produces Roquefort cheese, tomatoes and melons. To accompany the richer food, the area also supplies much stronger wines, from Bordeaux, Cahors, Madiran, and Languedoc, all of which are washed down with brandy from Armagnac.

==Films==
The following films are set in southern France:

<text>James Gould Cozzens (August 19, 1903 – August 9, 1978) was a Pulitzer prize-winning American writer whose work enjoyed an unusual degree of popular success and critical acclaim for more than three decades. His 1949 Pulitzer win was for the WWII race novel &quot;Guard of Honor&quot;, which more than one critic considered one of the most important accounts of the war. His 1957 Pulitzer nomination was for the best-selling novel &quot;By Love Possessed&quot;, which was later made into a popular 1961 film.

Culturally conservative critics&#x27; widespread acclaim for &quot;By Love Possessed&quot;, along with a controversial 1957 interview that Cozzens gave to &quot;Time&quot;, led to an aggressive backlash by author Irving Howe in the &quot;New Republic&quot; and avant-garde critic Dwight Macdonald in &quot;Commentary&quot;. Macdonald&#x27;s essay is still considered &quot;the most persuasively devastating review of the century&quot; more than fifty years later. The criticism, aimed as much at critics catering to a middle- rather than highbrow sensibility as the author himself, did extensive damage to Cozzens&#x27; reputation, both during the last 20 years of his life, and posthumously.

In recent years, there have been multiple attempts at resuscitating Cozzens&#x27; place in the literary pantheon. D.G. Myers called him &quot;perhaps America&#x27;s best forgotten novelist.&quot; Writer Joseph Epstein has offered similar praise, both in an essay for &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine, as well as in a chapter for his book &quot;Plausible Prejudices&quot;. The late biographer and academic editor Matthew J. Bruccoli extended those efforts in a biography and related scholarly work. There has also been recent interest in screenplays based on his work: in 2018, the &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that the rights to Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s screenplay &quot;Castaway&quot;, based on Cozzens&#x27; novella, had been acquired by a producer.

==Writing==

Cozzens published his first novel &quot;Confusion&quot;, in 1924 while still a student at Harvard. A few months later, ill and in debt, he withdrew from school and moved to New Brunswick, where he wrote &quot;Michael Scarlett&quot;, a second novel. Neither book sold well or was widely read, and to sustain himself, Cozzens traveled to Cuba to teach children of American residents, which is where he began to write short stories and gather material for the novels &quot;Cock Pit&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Son of Perdition&quot; (1929).

He met Sylvia Bernice Baumgarten, a literary agent with Brandt &amp; Kirkpatrick, whom he married at city hall in New York City on December 27, 1927, and who successfully edited and marketed his books. Except for military service during World War II, the Cozzenses lived in semi-seclusion near Lambertville, New Jersey, and shied away from all but local contact. Other early novels include &quot;S.S. San Pedro&quot; (1931) which won the Scribner&#x27;s Prize, &quot;The Last Adam&quot; (1933), and &quot;Castaway&quot; (1934).

During World War II, Cozzens served in the U.S. Army Air Forces, at first updating manuals, then in the USAAF Office of Information Services, a liaison and &quot;information clearinghouse&quot; between the military and the civilian press. One of the functions of his office was in controlling news, and it became Cozzens&#x27;s job to defuse situations potentially embarrassing to Gen. Henry H. Arnold, the chief of the Army Air Forces. In the course of his job, he became arguably the best informed officer of any rank and service in the U.S., and he had achieved the rank of major by the time he was discharged at the end of the war. These experiences formed the basis of his 1948 novel &quot;Guard of Honor,&quot; which won the 1949 Pulitzer Prize.

His 1957 novel &quot;By Love Possessed&quot; became a surprise success, with 34 weeks on &quot;the New York Times Best Seller list&quot;, rating #1 on September 22, 1957, three weeks after its release. It was also the top-selling novel of 1957. The novel was also very loosely adapted into a movie in 1961. By that time, however, a hostile review of the novel which Dwight Macdonald wrote for &quot;Commentary&quot; Magazine had already effectively ruined Cozzens&#x27;s literary career, and few of his later works either received similar critical acclaim or achieved comparable best-seller status. His last novel, &quot;Morning, Noon and Night,&quot; was published in 1968, but sold poorly.

Throughout his life, Cozzens maintained extensive correspondence, with several literary figures, including American writers Carlos Baker, Saul Bellow, Erskine Caldwell, Granville Hicks, Oliver La Farge, John O&#x27;Hara, as well as the publisher William Jovanovich, and academic author-editor and biographer Matthew J. Bruccoli.

==Style and themes==
Philosophical in nature, his novels take place during the course of just a few days, exhibit little action, and explore a variety of concepts such as love, duty, racial sensitivities, and the law. Cozzens&#x27; novels disregarded modernist literary trends, and are characterized by the use of often unfamiliar, archaic words, traditional literary structures, and conservative themes. As a result, many contemporary critics regarded his work as old-fashioned or moralistic, and he was viciously attacked as a reactionary by his harshest critics.

His prose is crafted meticulously and has an objective, clinical tone and subtle, dry humor. His work is at times complex, using multi-level layering and double voicing as narrative techniques for expressing viewpoint. The main characters of his books are primarily professional, middle-class white men — assistant district attorney Abner Coates in &quot;The Just and the Unjust&quot;, doctor George Bull in &quot;The Last Adam&quot;, Episcopal priest Ernest Cudlipp in &quot;Men and Brethren&quot;, Col. Norman Ross in &quot;Guard of Honor&quot;, and lawyer Arthur Winner in &quot;By Love Possessed&quot;, for example — who confront issues such as duty and ethics in their careers while attempting to reconcile these principles with the emotional demands of their personal lives, usually by compromising their principles. In almost every instance, they are based on persons he observed in his own experience.

Cozzens once said, &quot;I have no theme except that people get a very raw deal from life.&quot;

==Controversy==

Cozzens eschewed both fame and publicity, to the point that he stated publicly he would refuse a Nobel Prize when speculation that he was being considered for one became prominent. During 1957, however, he broke with his long-standing penchant for privacy (for which he was dubbed &quot;the Garbo of U.S. letters&quot; in the article that resulted) and granted &quot;Time&quot; magazine an interview, over the objections of his wife, as the basis for its cover article of September 2, 1957, marking the release of &quot;By Love Possessed&quot;.

Short story writer and critic Patrick J. Murphy wrote that Cozzens&#x27; responses during the interview were verbalizations of his writing style: often using parody and sarcasm, quoting other works without attribution, and punctuated by laughter. As sometimes happened with his prose, this style did not translate well into print, and the results were further distorted because the information seemed to be gathered by one reporter but the article written by someone different.

An immediate barrage of readers&#x27; letters followed and were published, attacking Cozzens as being a snob, an elitist, anti-Catholic, racist and sexist — criticisms that were soon used by critics including Irving Howe, Frederick Crews, and Dwight Macdonald. Cozzens also became a symbol of &quot;The Establishment&quot; and the antithesis of the growing counterculture of the 1960s because his works negatively portrayed or lampooned those against authority and &quot;the system.&quot;

Detractors described Cozzens as a hardcore political and religious conservative; in fact, he was largely apolitical and not particularly religious. His attempts to counter this incorrect image met with little success, and he soon forfeited whatever fan base he had gained from &quot;By Love Possessed&quot;. His reputation was further lambasted during 1968 by critics (in particular John Updike) of his final book, &quot;Morning, Noon, and Night&quot;, which had a nearly unreadable style (even by the author&#x27;s usual standards) and a protagonist that was not interesting or compelling.

As a result, sales of all his books suffered, and Cozzens has become virtually unknown to the general public; he remains, however, fairly well known among those familiar with the literary criticism of George Steiner John Derbyshire and Matthew Bruccoli, all of whom have praised his work.

== Legacy ==
Today, Cozzens is often grouped with his contemporaries John O&#x27;Hara and John P. Marquand, but his work is generally considered more challenging. His biographer Matthew J. Bruccoli, noted the following qualities in Cozzens&#x27; prose style, by describing his language use in the best seller &quot;By Love Possessed&quot; this way:

Cozzens was a critic of modernism, and of realism more leftist than his own, and he was quoted in a featured article in &quot;Time&quot; as saying (perhaps somewhat in jest), &quot;I can&#x27;t read ten pages of Steinbeck without throwing up.&quot;

== Personal background ==

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Cozzens grew up on Staten Island. His father, Henry William Cozzens Jr., who died when Cozzens was 17, was an affluent businessman and the grandson of William C. Cozzens, a governor of Rhode Island. His mother, Mary Bertha Wood, came from a family of Connecticut Tories who left for Nova Scotia following the American Revolution. Cozzens grew up in the same privileged lifestyle that formed the background of his most acclaimed works.

An Episcopalian, Cozzens attended the Episcopal Kent School in Connecticut from 1916 to 1922, and after graduation attended Harvard University. A few months later, ill and in debt, he withdrew from school and moved to New Brunswick. From there, Cozzens went to Cuba to teach children of American residents, and there began to write short stories and gather material. After a year he accompanied his mother to Europe, where he tutored a young polio patient in order to earn money.

During World War II, Cozzens served in the U.S. Army Air Forces, at first updating manuals, then in the USAAF Office of Information Services, a liaison and &quot;information clearinghouse&quot; between the military and the civilian press. One of the functions of his office was in controlling news, and it became Cozzens&#x27;s job to defuse situations potentially embarrassing to Gen. Henry H. Arnold, the chief of the Army Air Forces. In the course of his job, he became arguably the best informed officer of any rank and service in the U.S., and he had achieved the rank of major by the time he was discharged at the end of the war.

He met Sylvia Bernice Baumgarten, a literary agent with Brandt &amp; Kirkpatrick, whom he married at city hall in New York City on December 27, 1927, and who successfully edited and marketed his books. She was his apparent antithesis — Jewish and a liberal Democrat — but their marriage lasted successfully until both died in 1978. They had no children. During 1958, they relocated to another country home near Williamstown, Massachusetts. Cozzens was on the Harvard Board of Overseers&#x27;s Visiting Committee for the English Department from 1960 to 1966. Except for military service during World War II, the Cozzenses lived in semi-seclusion near Lambertville, New Jersey, and shied away from all but local contact.

James and Bernice Cozzens spent their last years in relative obscurity in Martin County, Florida, where they lived in Rio, but used a Stuart post office box as their address. After Bernice&#x27;s death in January 1978, Cozzens&#x27;s health deteriorated rapidly. He died on August 9, 1978, of complications from spinal cancer and pneumonia, 10 days short of his 75th birthday.

<doc id="739497" wikidata="Q193568" url="?curid=739497" title="Nuno Gomes">
<text>Nuno Miguel Soares Pereira Ribeiro (born 5 July 1976), known as Nuno Gomes, is a Portuguese former professional footballer who played as a striker.

He was given the nickname &quot;Gomes&quot; during childhood after Fernando Gomes, and was regarded as one of the country&#x27;s most recognisable attacking players in the 1990s and 2000s; he consistently scored for both club and country, and was also capable of being a good link-up player, accumulating a number of assists throughout his career, which was spent mainly with Benfica, for which he netted 166 goals in 398 games over the course of 12 seasons.

Gomes represented Portugal in two World Cups and three European Championships. He helped the national team finish second at Euro 2004 and third at Euro 2000, and won 79 senior caps.

==Club career==
===Boavista and Benfica===
Born in Amarante, Gomes established his reputation with Boavista, where he made his Primeira Liga debut in the 1994–95 season, aged 18. He collected his first silverware as his team beat Benfica to lift the Taça de Portugal in 1997, scoring a goal and winning a penalty kick in a 3–2 win in the final; he and fellow scorer Erwin Sánchez had already agreed to transfer to the opponents.

Gomes ranked joint-fourth top scorer in his last year at the Estádio do Bessa, before moving to Benfica. In the 1998–99 campaign he netted 34 times in all competitions, in an eventual third-place finish in the league.

===Fiorentina===
After three seasons at Benfica, his Euro 2000 exploits earned Gomes a €17 million move to Fiorentina. He won the Coppa Italia over Parma in his first year, scoring in a 1–1 draw in the second leg of the final at home, which allowed his team to clinch the title 2–1 on aggregate; however, his second season was less successful, as financial collapse by the &quot;Viola&quot; and their subsequent relegation precipitated a 2002 return to his previous club on a four-year deal as a free agent.

===Return to Benfica===
A series of injuries limited Gomes to under 70 games from 2002 to 2005, but he still helped Benfica win the domestic cup in 2003–04 and the league the following season – in the latter, he contributed seven goals from 23 appearances. He enjoyed his best season in 2005–06, scoring 15 goals in the league, including two in an away win over Porto (2–0) and a hat-trick against União de Leiria, finishing second in the scorers&#x27; list and adding the subsequent Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira, where he netted the game&#x27;s only goal against Vitória de Setúbal.
From 2006–07 onwards, Gomes faced tough competition for a starting place: he only netted six times in the league, and would suffer even more after the signing of Paraguayan Óscar Cardozo the following summer. However, still a valuable member of the squad, he finished the campaign with nine overall goals, handing the captain armband to legendary Rui Costa in the process.

On 2 October 2008, Gomes scored his 150th goal for Benfica in a UEFA Cup game against Napoli (2–0 home win, 4–3 aggregate victory) with a fine header. Following the arrival of Argentine Javier Saviola in June 2009, he further fell down the striker pecking order.

Again a reserve player in 2010–11 – but playing even less – the 34-year-old Gomes made the most with the minutes provided to him by manager Jorge Jesus. He scored his first goal in the season on 14 November 2010 in a 4–0 home defeat of Naval, the 200th in the competition, and dedicated it to his father Joaquim who had died in August. In two consecutive league games in March 2011, he scored three goals, one at home against Portimonense (1–1 draw) and two in a 5–1 away rout of Paços de Ferreira, appearing as a late substitute in all three matches.

===Braga===
Gomes was released by Benfica on 30 June 2011, after the club decided not to renew his contract; he was, however, offered a position in the managerial structure, effective immediately or when he eventually retired. Shortly after, he signed with fellow top-division Braga.

On 11 September 2011, Gomes scored a brace in a 3–1 home win against Gil Vicente. During his only season with the Minho side, he was mostly used as a backup.

===Blackburn Rovers===
On 3 July 2012, Gomes signed a two-year deal at Blackburn Rovers in the EFL Championship, becoming their third signing of the 2012–13 summer transfer window. On 18 August he made his league debut for his new club, against Ipswich Town, scoring his first goal the following round in the 2–1 home victory over Leicester City.

On 28 June 2013, aged 36, Gomes was released. After retiring, he was appointed director of Benfica&#x27;s academy at Futebol Campus in Seixal, leaving his position in September 2017.

==International career==
Gomes represented Portugal at every level, earning 143 caps across all youth levels and scoring at an excellent rate. He helped the under-20s to third place in the 1995 FIFA World Youth Championship by netting four goals in as many games, including two in the third-place match against Spain. The following year, he appeared at the 1996 Summer Olympics, finishing fourth.

Gomes made his senior debut at 19, in a 1996 friendly against France. He scored his first goal in Portugal&#x27;s opening match at the UEFA Euro 2000, marking his fourth start with the winner as the side came from two goals down to beat England 3–2. He finished the competition with four goals as the national team reached the last four, but earned a seven-month international ban after pushing referee Günter Benkö following the semi-final defeat by France, in which he had opened the score; he was selected to the UEFA team of the tournament.

With seven goals in only six matches, Gomes helped Portugal qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup – this included four in a 7–1 away demolition of Andorra. He would struggle to hold a starting place in the finals in South Korea and Japan, only appearing twice from the bench. On 19 November 2003 he scored his second hat-trick, in only 21 minutes of play against Kuwait.

Things went better for Gomes at Euro 2004, where he played each game and, after coming on as a half-time substitute, scored the winning goal against Spain to send the hosts through to the quarter-finals. He was often injured during the nation&#x27;s 2006 World Cup qualifying campaign, only managing to play four times, with one goal; he found limited time at the final stages and only made two appearances, but managed to find the back of the net with a header against hosts Germany in the third-place playoff, a 3–1 defeat.

After the retirement of Pauleta, Gomes was expected to become his successor in the striker role. He played ten matches and scored three times in the Euro 2008 qualifiers, captained Portugal at the finals and scored against Germany in the quarter-finals, thus becoming the fourth player to achieve the feat at three straight European Championships.

Following the appointment of Carlos Queiroz as coach, Gomes was constantly overlooked due to his lack of minutes at Benfica. During the 2010 World Cup qualification, he only took part in four out of 12 fixtures, all as a substitute, with Liédson and Hugo Almeida being preferred; he was one of the 50 preliminary players but was left out of the 23-men squad for the final stages in South Africa, this being the first time the player was left out of a major tournament.

On 7 October 2011, after more than two years out of international play, the 35-year-old Gomes replaced Hélder Postiga in the last minute of a 5–3 home victory over Iceland for the Euro 2012 qualifiers. Four days later, he played against Denmark in what was his last full appearance; due to little playing time for his club in 2011–12, he was left out of Paulo Bento&#x27;s squad for the finals in Poland and Ukraine.

==Personal life==
Gomes&#x27; younger brother, Tiago (born 1981), was also a footballer and a striker. He spent most of his career in the lower leagues but, from 2004 to 2007, competed in the Segunda Liga with Marco (two seasons) and Olivais e Moscavide (one), totalling 30 games and one goal.

Gomes was married twice, first to Isméria with whom he had a daughter, Laura, born in 1999. In July 2006 he married lawyer Patrícia Aguilar, with whom he also fathered another child, Nuno, born in July 2010.

He was featured on the cover of the Portuguese edition of &quot;FIFA Football 2002&quot;.

<text>The talent (Ancient Greek: , &quot;talanton&quot;, Latin ) was a unit of weight used in the ancient world, often used for weighing gold and silver, but also mentioned in connection with other metals, ivory, and frankincense. In Homer&#x27;s poems, it is always used of gold and is thought to have been quite a small weight of about , approximately the same as the later gold stater coin or Persian daric.

In later times in Greece, it represented a much larger weight, approximately 3,000 times as much: an Attic talent was approximately . The word also came to be used as the equivalent of the Middle Eastern &quot;kakkaru&quot; or &quot;kikkar&quot;. A Babylonian talent was . Ancient Israel adopted the Babylonian weight talent, but later revised it. The heavy common talent, used in New Testament times, was . A Roman talent (divided into 100 librae or pounds) was Attic talents, approximately . An Egyptian talent was 80 librae, approximately .

== Akkadian talent ==
The Akkadian talent was called kakkaru in the Akkadian language, corresponding to Biblical Hebrew &quot;kikkar&quot; כִּכָּר (translated as Greek τάλαντον &#x27;talanton&#x27; in the Septuagint, English &#x27;talent&#x27;), Ugaritic &quot;kkr&quot; (𐎋𐎋𐎗), Phoenician &quot;kkr&quot; (𐤒𐤒𐤓), Syriac &quot;kakra&quot; (ܟܲܟܪܵܐ), and apparently to &quot;gaggaru&quot; in the Amarna Tablets. The name comes from the Semitic root &quot;KKR&quot; meaning &#x27;to be circular&#x27;, referring to round masses of gold or silver. The &quot;kakkaru&quot; or talent weight was introduced in Mesopotamia at the end of the 4th millennium BC, and was normalized at the end of the 3rd millennium during the Akkadian-Sumer phase. The talent was divided into 60 minas, each of which was subdivided into 60 shekels (following the common Mesopotamian sexagesimal number system). These weights were used subsequently by the Babylonians, Sumerians and Phoenicians, and later by the Hebrews. The Babylonian weights are approximately: shekel (), mina () and talent ().

The Greeks adopted these weights through their trade with the Phoenicians along with the ratio of 60 minas to one talent. A Greek mina in Euboea around 800 BC weighed 504 g; other minas in the Mediterranean basin, and even other Greek minas, varied in some small measure from the Babylonian values, and from one to another. The Bible mentions the unit in various contexts, like Hiram king of Tyre sending 120 talents of gold to King Solomon as part of an alliance, or the building of the candelabrum necessitating a talent of pure gold.

===Origin===
William Ridgeway speculates that the &quot;kakkaru&quot;/&quot;kikkar&quot; was originally the weight of a load which could be carried by a man. Thus in the Book of Kings we read that Naaman “bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him”. He notes that in Assyrian cuneiform, the same ideogram or sign was used for both &quot;tribute&quot; and &quot;talent&quot;, which might be explained if a load of corn was the regular unit of tribute.

==Homeric talent==
In Homer, the word in the plural is sometimes used of a pair of scales or a balance; it is used especially of the scales in which Zeus weighed the fortunes of men (&quot;Iliad&quot; 8.69, 19.223, 22.209). The word is also used as a measurement, always of gold. &quot;From the order of the prizes in Il. 23.262 sq. and other passages its weight was probably not great&quot;.

According to Seltman, the original Homeric talent was probably the gold equivalent of the value of an ox or a cow. Homer describes how Achilles set an ox as 2nd prize in a foot race, and a half-talent of gold as the third prize, suggesting that the ox was worth a talent. Based on a statement from a later Greek source that &quot;the talent of Homer was equal in amount to the later daric [... i.e.] two Attic drachmas&quot; and analysis of finds from a Mycenaean grave-shaft, a weight of about can be established for this original talent. The later Attic talent was of a different weight than the Homeric, but represented the same value in copper as the Homeric did in gold, with the price ratio of gold to copper in Bronze Age Greece being 1:3000.

==Attic talent==

An Attic talent was the equivalent of 60 minae or 6,000 drachmae.

An Attic weight talent was about . Friedrich Hultsch estimated a weight of 26.2 kg, and offers an estimate of 26.0 kg.
An Attic talent of silver was the value of nine man-years of skilled work, according to known wage rates from 377 BC. In 415 BC, an Attic talent was a month&#x27;s pay for a trireme crew. Hellenistic mercenaries were commonly paid one drachma per day of military service.

==Aeginetan talent==
The Aeginetan talent weighed about 37 kg. The German historian Friedrich Hultsch calculated a range of 36.15 to 37.2 kg based on such estimates as the weight of one full Aeginetan &quot;metretes&quot; of coins, and concluded that the Aeginetan talent represented the water weight of a Babylonian &quot;ephah&quot;: 36.29 kg by his reckoning (the &quot;metretes&quot; and the &quot;ephah&quot; were units of volume). Percy Gardner estimated a weight of 37.32 kg, based on extant weights and coins.

An Aeginetan talent was worth 60 Aeginetan minae, or 6,000 Aeginetan drachmae.

==Talent in late Hebrew antiquity==
The talent (, &quot;kikkar&quot;; Aramaic: , ) in late Hebrew antiquity (c. 500 CE) was the greatest unit of weight in use at the time, and which weight varied depending on the era. According to the Jerusalem Talmud (&quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 9a, &quot;Pnei Moshe Commentary&quot;, s.v. ), the weight of the talent at the time of Moses was double that of the Roman era talent, which latter had the weight of either 100 &quot;maneh&quot; (), or 60 &quot;maneh&quot; (Roman ), each &quot;maneh&quot; (&quot;libra&quot;) having the weight of 25 &quot;sela&quot;s (&quot;sela&quot; being a term used for the biblical Shekel of Tyrian coinage, or &#x27;shekel of the Sanctuary&#x27;, and where there were 4 provincial &quot;denarii&quot; or &quot;zuz&quot; to each &quot;sela&quot;; 25 &quot;sela&quot;s being equivalent to 100 &quot;denaria&quot;).

The standard talent during the late Second Temple period was the talent consisting of 60 &quot;maneh&quot;. According to Talmudic scholars, the talent (&quot;kikkar&quot;) of 60 &quot;maneh&quot; (and which sum total of 60 &quot;maneh&quot; equals 1,500 &quot;sela&quot;s, or 6,000 &quot;denarii&quot; (the &quot;denarius&quot; also being known in Hebrew as &quot;zuz&quot;), had a weight of 150 &quot;dirham&quot; for every 25 &quot;sela&quot;s. The anatomic weight of each &quot;dirham&quot; at that time was put at 3.20 grammes, with every &quot;sela&quot; or &#x27;shekel of the sanctuary&#x27; weighing-in at 20.16 grammes. The sum aggregate of the 60 &quot;maneh&quot; talent (or 1,500 &quot;sela&quot;s) came to c. . According to Adani, in the silver coinage known as the Mughal India &quot;rupaiya&quot;, minted during British colonial rule (each with a weight of grammes (1 tola), of which weight only 91.7% was of fine silver), one talent (Heb. &quot;kikkar&quot;) would have amounted to 2,343 of these silver coins in specie (), in addition to the minuscule weight of 12 &quot;ma’in&quot; (10.08 grammes).

==Other talents==

The talent as a unit of value is mentioned in the New Testament in Jesus&#x27; Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25:14–30). The use of the word &quot;talent&quot; to mean &quot;gift or skill&quot; in English and other languages originated from an interpretation of this parable sometime late in the 13th century. Luke includes a different parable involving the mina. According to Epiphanius, the talent is called &quot;mina&quot; (&quot;maneh&quot;) among the Hebrews, and was the equivalent in weight to one-hundred denarii. The talent is found in another parable of Jesus where a servant who is forgiven a debt of ten thousand talents refuses to forgive another servant who owes him only one hundred silver denarii. The talent is also used elsewhere in the Bible, as when describing the material invested in the Ark of the Covenant. Solomon received 666 gold talents a year.

In Revelation 16:21, the talent is used as a weight for hail being poured forth from heaven and dropping on mankind as punishment in the end times: &quot;And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.&quot; (KJV) Various definitions are provided in different translations:
*NIV: a footnote says &quot;Talent: 75 or 100 pounds.&quot;
*NLT: text reads &quot;weighing as much as seventy-five pounds&quot;.
*ESV: text reads &quot;about one hundred pounds each&quot;.

<text>Dmitri Sergeyevich Kirichenko (; born 17 January 1977) is a Russian football coach and a former player who played as a striker. He is the manager of Tekstilshchik Ivanovo.

As of 10 March 2014, he is the 3rd all-time top scorer in the Russian Premier League (129 goals), and the 5th player by league appearances (377).

==Club career==
Kirichenko started his career playing for small clubs such as Lokomotiv Mineralnye Vody, Iskra Novoaleksandrovsk and Torpedo Taganrog. In 1998, he joined Rostselmash, following impressive performance for Taganrog club during the previous year.

He became one of the most promising Russian strikers during the next years, and joined CSKA Moscow in 2002. With the &quot;army men&quot; Kirichenko managed to become the league top scorer in 2002 (along with his teammate Rolan Gusev), won the Russian Premier League twice, and got the Russian Cup.

In 2005, he left for FC Moscow. Playing for the new team, he repeated his success, becoming the top scorer again.

He played for Saturn from 2007 to 2010. In 2008 in the first match of his team in the UEFA Intertoto Cup, in the victory 7–0, he scored 4 goals. He did not play in the second match of that round. At the next round he scored a goal at the first match in a 1–0 victory against 2007 German champions VfB Stuttgart. With 5 goals at total he became the top scorer of the UEFA Intertoto Cup 2008.

In 2011, after Saturn were dissolved due to financial problems, Kirichenko returned to Rostov, the club where he had made a name for himself back in the 1990s.

==International career==
He played for his country at Euro 2004, scoring in the second minute against Greece as Russia defeated the eventual European champions 2–1 in a consolation match as Russia were already eliminated. The goal stood as the fastest goal ever in a European Championship until Nedim Bajrami of Albania scored against Italy in 23 seconds at Euro 2024. 

==Managerial career==
He was appointed the caretaker manager of FC Rostov on 6 August 2016 following the resignation of Kurban Berdyev. His caretaking spell ended on 9 September 2016.

He was appointed the caretaker manager of FC Ufa on 7 November 2018. Ufa won their first game under his management against FC Spartak Moscow, but in the next 6 games the club only achieved 2 draws and 4 losses, and on 27 March 2019 Kirichenko left Ufa by mutual consent.

<text>Dmitri Olegovich Bulykin (; born 20 November 1979) is a retired Russian footballer. Between 2003 and 2005, he played regularly for the Russian national team.

==Club career==

===Lokomotiv Moscow===
Bulykin began his football career with Lokomotiv Moscow in 1997. He stayed with Lokomotiv for three years scoring 28 goals in 94 appearances and attracted quite a bit of attention.
In Lokomotiv Moscow Bulykin won Silver medals (1999, 2000), Bronze (1997) and 3 times Russian Cup (1997, 2000, 2001).

===Dynamo Moscow===
In 2001, Bulykin signed with Dynamo Moscow and quickly established himself as the first team player for the next three seasons. He scored a total of 29 goals in 90 appearances for the club. In 2003 was invited to the Russian national team.

With improving performances for both club and country, Bulykin, who had never hidden his desire to move to a foreign club, was expected to move abroad. In January 2004 he spent two weeks on trial with Everton, but he did not have enough caps for a work permit. In 2005, hoping move to England, Bulykin went on trials in Portsmouth but that transfer did not happen. As a result, Bulykin remained with Dynamo, and was quickly relegated to play in the second team, and eventually excluded from training process altogether.
While almost breaking his relationship with Dynamo, he re-signed for the 2006 season, after the former Russia manager Yuri Syomin was appointed as the club&#x27;s manager. On 31 March, when Bulykin was ready to come as a substitute against Saturn, Syomin shouted at him, &quot;Take off the mittens!&quot;, a moment that was televised live. Syomin later said that he considers wearing gloves when the weather is relatively mild to be a sign of unwillingness to work hard, while Bulykin himself took Syomin&#x27;s shout as an emboldening, albeit a bit over the top one. Syomin was sacked mid season and under the next manager, Andrei Kobelev, Bulykin was placed on the transfer list, where he spent the end of 2006. Trying to resolve Bulykin&#x27;s deadlock with Dynamo, its general manager, Dmitri Ivanov, stated that the club would release Bulykin with no transfer cost, should there be any interest from anyone.

===Bayer Leverkusen===

On 28 August 2007, Bulykin secured a one-year contract with German club Bayer Leverkusen, after scoring a goal in two friendly matches during his trial for the Bundesliga club. On 19 December 2007, he scored for the first time for the club, netting two goals against FC Zürich in the UEFA Cup, and was declared &quot;man of the match&quot; by UEFA. In round 20, Bulykin, starting for the first time in his Bayer career, broke the Bundesliga record for the fastest yellow card received (in the 12th second). He played 19 official games in this 2007–08 season and he scored five goals for Bayer Leverkusen.

===Anderlecht===
On 19 August 2008, he moved to Belgian club Anderlecht, hoping to gain more game time as a striker. After initial success where he scored two headers in his debut in the Belgian Pro League, he was quickly benched by the coach Ariël Jacobs and had marginal appearances through the rest of 2008. He played 10 games only and scored 3 goals.

===Fortuna Düsseldorf===
After being idle for most of 2009, Bulykin was loaned back to Germany, this time to a Bundesliga second division team Fortuna Düsseldorf. He started with an impressive play in his first match against Hamburger SV in the German Cup. He had bad luck with a serious injury that took him five months to recover from, which made this whole season very unlucky.

===ADO Den Haag===
While Anderlecht won the Belgian Supercup, Bulykin was on trial at ADO Den Haag. The Dutch Eredivisie team decided to loan him for the 2010–11 season. He scored 21 league goals and became popular among ADO Den Haag fans. After the season ADO Den Haag tried to buy Bulykin, but an agreement couldn&#x27;t be reached and he returned to Anderlecht after his season in the Netherlands.

===Ajax===

On 31 August 2011, it was announced that RSC Anderlecht and Ajax had come to terms on the move of Bulykin to the Amsterdam club as a free transfer. Bulykin signed a one-year contract with an option for the club to extend it for one more year. In his first competition match, against rivals PSV Eindhoven, he scored the second Ajax goal, deciding the game on a 2–2 draw.

On 7 December 2011, Dmitri Bulykin was voted &quot;Best Russian Football Player abroad&quot; by the Russian Football Union, but was unable to attend the Gala in Moscow to receive his award, due to the event being scheduled at the same time as the UEFA Champions League home match against Real Madrid.

===Twente===
After his Ajax contract expired in the summer of 2012, and was not extended, free agent Bulykin signed a one-year deal, with option for another year at FC Twente, who just had seen striker Luuk de Jong leave for Borussia Mönchengladbach.

===Volga Nizhny Novgorod===
On 18 September 2013, Bulykin joined Russian Premier League side Volga Nizhny Novgorod, signing a one-year contract.

==International career==
Bulykin made his debut for Russia on 9 September 2003 in the Euro 2004 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland under manager Georgi Yartsev. He made quite an impression in his only second appearance by scoring three goals in Russia&#x27;s next qualifier against Switzerland. Russia eventually won 4–1 to subsequently qualify for the final tournament.

In the final tournament Bulykin struggled in Russia&#x27;s two losses against Spain and Portugal. Bulykin finally made an impact against Greece by scoring a header off a Rolan Gusev corner in a game where Russia emerged victorious 2–1 to console their fans being the only team able to beat the eventual champions.

Bulykin was called up for the 2006 World Cup qualifiers and scored in the very first round against Slovakia in a 1–1 draw. He played for Russia in 15 games and scored 7 goals.

<doc id="739512" wikidata="Q163437" url="?curid=739512" title="Zisis Vryzas">
<text>Zisis Vryzas (; born 9 November 1973) is a Greek former professional footballer who played as a forward for various teams in Greece and abroad, as well as for Greece, when they won the Euro 2004. After his retirement, he worked for PAOK as technical director, and for a brief period, took up the position of president, following Theodoros Zagorakis&#x27; resignation. On 16 August 2010, Vryzas became the assistant coach of the Greece national team.

==Club career==

===Skoda Xanthi===
Born in Kavala, Vryzas started his football career at Skoda Xanthi where his talent attracted the interest of stronger domestic as well as foreign Clubs.

===PAOK===
In 1996, Vryzas was signed by PAOK, where he enjoyed great popularity among PAOK fans for his power, determination and devotion with which they describe his game and for scoring a handful of very important goals. The most significant memory of his career at PAOK occurred in the first round second leg of the 1997–98 UEFA Cup. It was the equaliser (1–1 on the night, 2–1 on aggregate) he scored in the 87th minute against Arsenal at Highbury, which resulted in a notable, historic qualification for PAOK against the English team who managed to win the double in the Premier League that same season.

===Perugia===
In 2000, while PAOK were struggling with endless financial problems due to the ineffective policy of debts and mismanagement of the main share-holder, consequently Vryzas was sold to the Italian Serie A relegation battlers Perugia. In Perugia, he once again gained popularity among the local fans for his work-rate and immediate adjustment to the new environment, which proved to be a key-factor for Perugia&#x27;s constant presence in the Serie A, under the management of Serse Cosmi.

===Fiorentina===
His very positive performances with Perugia earned him a more lucrative contract at the once mighty Fiorentina in 2003, at that time struggling in Serie B; ironically, the Viola returned to Serie A at the expense of Perugia, through a two-legged play-off, as they had finished sixth in Serie B that season, while Perugia had finished at 15th place in Serie A.

====Loan to Celta Vigo====
In 2004, the Greek striker joined Celta Vigo in a loan deal from Fiorentina with an option for the deal to become permanent.

===Torino===
In January 2006 the Greek striker eventually departed again to join another popular Club of northern Italy, Torino until the end of his contract.

===Return to Skoda Xanthi===
In the summer of 2006, Vryzas returned to Greece and in particular to the club where he started his professional career, Skoda Xanthi.

===Return to PAOK===
In June 2007, he finally decided to join the &quot;club of his heart&quot; and signed a two-year contract with PAOK. There he found his old companion and team-mate, at both PAOK and Greece during the 1990&#x27;s, Theodoros Zagorakis, who had only just taken the presidency of the club. Vryzas stated upon his return that PAOK was an emotional choice for him, and the last stop in his career should only be in the club he loved and supported since childhood. On 6 January 2008, Vryzas played his last game of his football career at the home game against AEL, where PAOK won with 1–0, with a goal by Lazaros Christodoulopoulos, who dedicated his goal to Vryzas. Vryzas, actually came in as a substitution at the 82nd minute to replace Christodoulopoulos and was honoured by the fans with a standing ovation and with a long singing of his name, which lasted until the end of the match, as he thanked them during his &quot;goodbye round&quot; of the stadium.

==International career==
Vryzas debuted for Greece in October 1994 in a home Euro 1996 qualifier against Finland, a 4–0 victory. He scored his first goal three months later, in a friendly against Cyprus at Larnaca, but had to wait until 2004 in Portugal to take part in a final stage of a tournament.

Although not a very prolific scorer, Vryzas&#x27; tenacious work ethic, his restless battles with the opposing defenders, his talent to create chances and open spaces for his attacking partners, in addition to his aerial ability and passing skills made him a valuable member of all the Clubs he played for, as well as the Greece national team when they won the European Championship in 2004. He was a notable member of the starting eleven in Greece&#x27;s victorious team and scored a tremendously important goal, a fine chip over the keeper, in Greece&#x27;s 2–1 loss to Russia. That goal sent the tournament underdogs into the quarter-final, on an equal goal difference (0) against contenders Spain (Greece progressed scoring four goals to Spain’s two)

==Post-playing career==
On 8 January 2008, Vryzas was officially appointed as the Technical Director of PAOK. He joined the club&#x27;s board along with former team-mate and current chairman of the club, Theodoros Zagorakis. During his first steps in his new career he succeeded in bringing to PAOK Pablo Contreras, Zlatan Muslimović, Vieirinha, Lino and Pablo Garcia in 2008.
He succeeded selling Lazaros Christodoulopoulos and Christos Melissis to Panathinaikos for €4,300,000 and Daniel Fernandes to Bochum for €1,100,000.

In July 2009, he continued and succeeded in bringing to PAOK Mirko Savini, Olivier Sorlin, Lucio Filomeno, Bruno Cirillo, Mohammed Abubakari and Vasilios Koutsianikoulis.

On 9 October 2009, Vryzas was appointed as the chairman of PAOK, following the resignation of Zagorakis for personal reasons.

On 11 August 2010, Vryzas resigned from the position of director of football from PAOK.

Five days later, he became a colleague of Fernando Santos, the head coach of Greece.

In 2012 he returned to PAOK as president and from the summer of 2014 he became their technical director. Vryzas is a misunderstanding figure in the history of the club. On 2010 PAOK were on the verge of economic collapse. There was also the scenario of the collapse of the Association in lower categories, under the weight of debts. With smart moves created a low budget team coached by Giorgos Donis, which could cope economically keeping the prestige of the club up after playing in European competitions, namely the UEFA Europa League. Somewhere in mid summer of 2012, and while he had erected a Greek-Russian namely Ivan Savvides entered the club. What happened was considered as a movement from God, after Savvides had several million euro in his pocket and intended to combine its presence in Greece with sporting activities and in particular with PAOK FC. Nevertheless, Vryzas, managed and made smart moves by bringing all these years from different positions (President, Technical Director) international players who became a major asset for the club.

On 18 February 2015, few days after the heavy defeat from Atromitos, Zisis Vryzas was made available by Ivan Savvides his resignation from the post of technical director of PAOK. However, formal notice to terminate the cooperation did not exist. However, some time ago it became known through information that the club has completed all the nominal procedures for his withdrawal from the Board of Directors. He later joined Veria as technical director. On 4 July 2016, he resigned from his position.

On 9 December 2016, the Temporary Administrative Committee of Hellenic Football Federation stated that Vryzas takes all responsibilities of the Directorate of Competition, which, among other things, is also responsible for the organization of the Greek Cup. On 7 November 2018, Vryzas solved his contract with Hellenic Football Federation.

<doc id="739521" wikidata="Q301353" url="?curid=739521" title="Keokuk (Sauk leader)">
<text>Keokuk (circa 1780–June 1848) was a leader of the Sauk tribe in central North America, and for decades was one of the most recognized Native American leaders and noted for his accommodation with the U.S. government. Keokuk moved his tribe several times and always acted as an ardent friend of the Americans. His policies were contrary to fellow Sauk leader Black Hawk, who led part of their band to defeat in the Black Hawk War, was later returned by U.S. forces to Keokuk&#x27;s custody, and who died a decade before Keokuk.

==Early and family life==
Keokuk was born around 1780 on the Rock River in what soon became Illinois Territory to a Sauk warrior of the Fox clan and his wife of mixed lineage. He lived in a village near what became Peoria, Illinois on the Illinois River, and although not of the traditional ruling elite, was elected to the tribal council as a young man. He had a wife, who may be buried in Schuyler County, Missouri.

==Career==

During the War of 1812, Keokuk convinced fellow tribal members not to leave their principal village, Saukenuk, and also not to fight for the British and war chief Black Hawk. However, many warriors had already left to do so, so Keokuk was also elected a war chief and successfully protected his village through oratory. In 1824, he visited Washington, D.C., with other Native American leaders, including Chief Wapello also of the Meskwaki people (sometimes called the Fox tribe).

Keokuk was noted for his personal bravery as well as oratorical skill. On several occasions, he persuaded tribal assemblies, although before he spoke every member but himself had been firmly determined to the contrary. At one time, in May 1832, Keokuk broke in upon a war dance that his band was holding preparatory to uniting with Black Hawk against the whites, and convinced the warriors in the heat of their fury that such would be suicidal and must not be undertaken.
Keokuk moved his tribe across the Mississippi River to a site on the Iowa River by 1828, and the following year Caleb Atwater met him:


In July 1830, Keokuk was one of several native leaders who entered into the Fourth Treaty of Prairie du Chien with Indian Agent William Clark. This ceded territory including Saukenuk (Black Hawk&#x27;s home village) to the United States (and white settlers). When Black Hawk returned from a foray (or attempted settlement in Iowa) and found white settlers in his ancestral village, he took up arms, and solicited general co-operation from his tribe. However, Keokuk succeeded in keeping the majority of the band at peace, and he became one of three &quot;money chiefs&quot; who distributed payments under this and other treaties. Keokuk took every opportunity to attempt to persuade Black Hawk to withdraw from his aggressive position before it was too late, but the U.S. Army and Illinois militia soon defeated Black Hawk&#x27;s warriors. A four hundred square mile strip surrounding Keokuk&#x27;s village in Iowa was exempted from the 1832 Black Hawk Purchase, a treaty which ended the war and which was negotiated at Fort Armstrong, Illinois (near Rock Island) in September 1832. In August 1833, U. S. authorities formally delivered Black Hawk (who had been taken as a captive to Washington, D.C., and eastern cities), to the custody of Keokuk, who had been officially recognized as the principal chief of the Sauks and Foxes in that treaty.

In 1837, with several of his nation&#x27;s village chiefs, Keokuk visited Washington, where a peace was arranged between his people and their old-time adversaries, the Sioux. They also visited New York City, Boston, and Cincinnati, where Keokuk&#x27;s speeches attracted attention. Black Hawk was with the party, as Keokuk feared leaving him to scheme during his own absence. Black Hawk died the following year. In August 1842, Keokuk and several tribal members (including wives), visited Nauvoo, Illinois, and he soon negotiated the sale of the tribe&#x27;s land across the river in Iowa (his friend Chief Wapello having died in March). Thus, in 1845, despite the land reservation in the 1832 treaty, Keokuk&#x27;s band was moved further west into Kansas.

==Death and legacy==

Keokuk and his people arrived at their new reservation near Ottawa, Kansas in 1845, and Keokuk there died in June 1848. Alternate sources describe the cause of his death as dysentery, alcoholism, or poison administered by a disaffected surviving member of the Black Hawk band who was soon executed. His son Moses Keokuk succeeded him as chief, and would later move the tribe to Oklahoma Territory.

Keokuk County, Iowa and the town of Keokuk, Iowa are named after him, although chief Keokuk had never visited the town before it was incorporated in 1834. Keokuk Street in Petaluma, California is also named after him. Pursuant to the efforts of Iowa judge Caleb Davis, a collector of Native American relics, Chief Keokuk was reburied in Keokuk in 1883, although modern forensics have determined that the remains thus interred were of a much younger man. The Chief Keokuk Statue, designed by Nellie Walker and erected in 1913, stands in Keokuk&#x27;s Rand Park, as erected by the Keokuk chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

In May 1832 Scottish traveller William Richard Grahame, facilitated by his acquaintance with Governor Coles of Illinois whom he had met on board a steamer, was able to observe two conferences between Governor Clark and Keokuk in St. Louis and records his impressions in his diary: &quot;Keokuk, the fine looking man..., whom I spoke of yesterday, was the principal speaker... They all spoke without embarrassment, and fluently, but I thought Keokuk was an orator. His countenance was really noble, intellectual and firm, occasionally relaxing with grace, and altogether commanding. ... He was five feet eleven, erect and stout, with a stately step and free. ... His voice was manly and full volumed as he spoke, and his utterance peculiarly distinct and rapid. His eyes and whole face were calm as he spoke, inspiring respect.&quot; ... Last evening Keokuk...went up the river in a steamboat. ... (he) had a long weapon...a spear...he...vociferated...His gestures and the tones of his voice were those of defiance and menace: to me it was a splendid piece of pantomime and rhapsody, but to his companions it appeared from the cheers to be a splendid piece of eloquence. ... I have been told that (Keokuk said that the Americans have been helpful and friendly to the Indians) and that by deeds as well as words he and his tribe would prove their gratitude to the Americans... (The) interpreter tells me that Keokuk&#x27;s speeches are more easily translated than those of any other of his tribe...that he is not rash, but is willing to take advice and consults... In the last war he took the part of the British and killed four Americans with his own hand... Keokuk is not a head chief having rank by inheritance, but a warrior chief which rank is attained by prowess. ... He has three sisters for wives and I was told he has a fourth from a different family. He is a prudent fellow and came over to the Americans before the war ended, when he saw the British losing ground.&quot;

<text>John Victor Aspinall (11 June 1926 – 29 June 2000) was an English zoo and casino owner. From upper class beginnings he used gambling to move to the centre of British high society in the 1960s. He was born in Delhi during the British Raj, and was a citizen of the United Kingdom.

==Early life==
John Victor Aspinall, known to all his friends as &quot;Aspers&quot;, was born in Delhi, British India on 11 June 1926, the son of Lt-Col. Dr Robert Stivala Aspinall (1895–1954), a British Army surgeon of British parentage and Maltese origin; he had added &quot;Aspinall&quot; to his original surname &quot;Stivala&quot; after joining the Indian Medical Service, being known for some time as Robert Aspinall-Stivala.

His mother was Mary Grace Horn (died 1987), the daughter of engineer Clement Samuel Horn, of Goring-by-Sea, Sussex.

Years later, when he pressed his father for money to cover his gambling debts, he discovered that his biological father was George Bruce, a soldier of Nordic descent.

Aspinall attended Felsted School in 1939 but after his parents divorced, his stepfather Sir George Osborne sent him to Rugby School, from which he was expelled for inattention. Aspinall later went to Jesus College, Oxford, but on the day of his final exams he feigned illness and went to the Gold Cup at Ascot racecourse instead. As a consequence, he never earned a degree.

==Gambling impresario==
Aspinall became a bookmaker; at that time the only gambling permitted by UK law was with cash and credit on the premises of racecourses and dog tracks, with credit by an account with a bookmaker, and on football pools. Casino gambling was not permitted at the time. However, between races Aspinall returned to London and hosted private gaming parties. He believed that games of Chemin de Fer, known as Chemie (Chemmy), were within the law in certain circumstances, and on average the owner of the house was able to make a 5% profit on the turnover of games.

Aspinall targeted his events at the rich, sending out embossed invitations. Gambling houses were defined then in British law as places where gambling had taken place more than three times. With his Irish-born accountant John Burke, Aspinall rented upper class flats and houses, never used them more than three times, and had his mother pay off local Metropolitan Police officers.

Among the gamblers were the Queen&#x27;s racehorse trainer Bernard van Cutsem, who brought with him friends including the Earl of Derby and the Duke of Devonshire. The standard bet was £1,000, which would be £25,000 accounting for inflation in 2007 figures. Chemie games were quick and played every 30 seconds, with £50,000 changing hands per game. On his first such event Aspinall made a profit of £10,000, a sum roughly equivalent to £300,000 in 2017 money.

In 1958, Aspinall was living at Howletts Zoo, in Kent; at one point his mother Mary (Lady Osborne) had forgotten to pay off corrupt police officers, so the police raided his game that night.

Aspinall, John Burke and Lady Osborne were all charged with gaming offences but won the subsequent court case, the outcome of which is known as &quot;Aspinall&#x27;s Law&quot;. The win created a vast increase in Chemie games, during which:
*The landowner, Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby, lost over £20,000; and then returned on another night and lost £300,000.
*William Stirling, older brother of the founder of the Special Air Service, Colonel Sir David Stirling, lost £173,500 on Aspinall&#x27;s tables, writing out an IOU at the end of the night.

In response to Aspinall&#x27;s win in court, the British Government brought forward the Betting and Gaming Act 1960, which when enacted allowed commercial bingo halls to be set up, provided they were established as members-only clubs and made their profit from membership fees and charges, and not from a percentage of the money staked. Casinos were required to operate under the same rules, with a licence from the Gaming Board of Great Britain (now the Gambling Commission), and to be members-only. The passing of these laws brought Aspinall&#x27;s Chemie-based 5% business model to a close, and he had to find a new business.

===Casinos===
In 1962, Aspinall founded the Clermont Club in London&#x27;s Mayfair. The club was named after Lord Clermont, a gambler who had previously owned the building in Berkeley Square. The club&#x27;s original members included five dukes, five marquesses, twenty earls and two cabinet ministers. Overheads were higher, and under the new laws, Aspinall was required to pay tax, only making a table charge which produced much smaller revenue for the house.

In Douglas Thompson&#x27;s book &quot;The Hustlers&quot;, and the later documentary on Channel 4, &quot;The Real Casino Royale&quot;, the club&#x27;s former financial director John Burke and gangster Billy Hill&#x27;s associate John McKew, claimed that Aspinall worked with Hill to employ criminals to cheat the players. Some of the wealthiest people in Britain were swindled out of millions of pounds, thanks to a gambling con known as &quot;the Big Edge&quot;.

John Burke quit in late 1965, a year into the scam. After two years operation the Big Edge was closed. Hill respected Aspinall&#x27;s decision and the two parted. The passing of the 1968 Gaming Act boosted profits, and he sold The Clermont in 1972.

The need for revenue to support his zoos prompted Aspinall to return to running gambling clubs in London, and he set up two new successful ones in Knightsbridge (in 1978) and Mayfair. In 1983, he made $30 million from their sale, but a decade later he was in financial difficulties once more, and in 1992 he set up yet another gambling spot, Aspinalls.

==Animal parks==
In his years at Oxford, Aspinall had loved the book &quot;Nada the Lily&quot; by H. Rider Haggard, about an illegitimate Zulu prince who lived outside his tribe among wild animals. In 1956, Aspinall moved into an Eaton Place apartment with his first wife. In the back garden, Aspinall built a garden shed housing a capuchin monkey, a 9-week-old tiger, and two Himalayan brown bears.

Later that year, with proceeds from his gambling, Aspinall purchased Howletts country house and estate near Canterbury, Kent. He lived in the house and set up a private zoo, Howletts Zoo, in the grounds. In 1973, because of need for further space for his collection of animals, Aspinall bought Port Lympne near Hythe, Kent. He opened Howletts to the public in 1975, and Port Lympne Zoo in 1976. He embarked on a 10-year programme to restore Port Lympne Mansion previously owned by Sir Philip Sassoon. Both Howletts and Port Lympne have been run by The Aspinall Foundation since 1984.

The zoos are known for the encouragement of close personal relationships between staff and animals, for their breeding of rare and endangered species and for the deaths of keepers who have been killed by the animals in their care.

==Politics==
Aspinall ran unsuccessfully for Parliament at the 1997 general election as the candidate of Sir James Goldsmith&#x27;s single-issue (against Britain&#x27;s involvement in the European Union) Referendum Party in the Folkestone and Hythe constituency, where he was defeated by senior Conservative Michael Howard. Aspinall received over 4,000 votes and 8% of the vote (thus saving his deposit), which was one of the Referendum Party&#x27;s best results. 

In private, Aspinall would express antisemitic views, including hatred towards Jews, and an admiration for Adolf Hitler. He was known to enjoy being provocative and believed an outrageous remark could provoke full-blooded responses and spirited debate, something he very much enjoyed. In Douglas Thompson&#x27;s book &quot;The Hustlers&quot; former Clermont Club financial director John Burke states: 

==Lucan connection==
Aspinall claimed that Lord Lucan, whose 1974 disappearance remains unresolved, had committed suicide by scuttling his motorboat and jumping into the English Channel with a stone tied around his body. According to the journalist Lynn Barber, in an interview in 1990, Aspinall made a slip of the tongue indicating Lucan had remained Aspinall&#x27;s friend beyond the date of the alleged suicide.

On 18 February 2012, Glenn Campbell of BBC News reported that John Aspinall&#x27;s ex-secretary (using the pseudonym of Jill Findlay) had disclosed that she was invited into meetings where Aspinall and Goldsmith discussed Lucan. She further said, that on two occasions, between 1979 and 1981, Aspinall instructed her to book trips to Kenya and Gabon for Lucan&#x27;s children. The arrangement was so Lucan could see his children from a distance, but he was not to meet them or speak to them.

==Marriages and family==
In 1956, he married Jane Gordon Hastings, a Scottish model (sister of Pye Hastings and Jimmy Hastings); the couple had one son, Damian Aspinall. Aspinall divorced her in 1966. In the same year, on 13 December, he married his second wife Belinda Mary Musker (b. 27 November 1942), daughter of Major Anthony Dermot Melloney Musker (killed in a motor racing accident on 8 August 1959) and wife (m. 2 November 1940) The Hon. Mary Angela FitzRoy, without issue.

In 1972, he divorced his second wife and married Lady Sarah-Marguerite &quot;Sally&quot; Curzon (b. 25 January 1945), daughter of Francis Curzon, 5th Earl Howe, and Sybil Boyter Johnson. She was a widow who was previously married to the racing driver Piers Raymond Courage. John and Sally had a son Bassa Wulfhere Aspinall (b 1972). He also had a daughter, Amanda, and two stepsons, Jason and Amos Courage. Amanda was married to musician Daryl Hall (of the musical duo Hall &amp; Oates); she died in 2019 from alcohol intoxication.

Through his stepfather Sir George Francis Osborne, 16th Baronet, he is step-uncle to George Osborne, former Chancellor of the Exchequer of the UK, who is in line to inherit the title of the Osborne baronets of Ballintaylor and Ballylemon from his father, Sir George&#x27;s son, Sir Peter Osborne, 17th Baronet.

Aspinall died of cancer, in Westminster, London, on 29 June 2000, aged 74.

==Media==
A 1977 documentary, &quot;Echo of the Wild&quot;, by Roy Deverell told the story of the Aspinall Foundation and featured Damian and John Aspinall. Another Deverell documentary, 1983&#x27;s &quot;A Passion to Protect&quot; chronicled Aspinall&#x27;s life up to that point. A book that same year, &quot;The Passion of John Aspinall,&quot; was written by Brian Masters.

Aspinall was portrayed by Christopher Eccleston in the 2013 TV series &quot;Lucan&quot;.

<text>Laurence Carbee Craigie (January 26, 1902 – February 27, 1994), was an American aviator and United States Air Force general. He became the first U.S. military jet pilot in 1942 when he piloted the Bell XP-59. With Orval R. Cook he is also known as one half of the Cook-Craigie plan, a method of producing aircraft.

==Biography==
Born in Concord, New Hampshire, on January 26, 1902, Laurence Craigie grew up in Concord, Somerville, Massachusetts and Keene, New Hampshire. He graduated from Stoneham, Massachusetts High School in 1919, and the U.S. Military Academy in June 1923, being commissioned a second lieutenant in the Air Service. He took flying training at Brooks Field and Kelly Field, Texas, and was a flying instructor at both places. He was promoted to first lieutenant in December 1927.

==Service==
In February 1929, Craigie went to France Field, Panama Canal Zone, where he was an Engineering Officer with the 7th Observation Squadron. He returned to Brooks in May 1931 and went to Randolph Field, Texas the following October for varied assignments. In 1935, Craigie graduated as a captain from the Air Corps Engineering School at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Training and Transport Engineering Unit of the Materiel Division there.

He was named assistant chief of the Engineering Section in July 1937. In June 1939, he graduated from the Army Industrial College and assigned as assistant executive of the Experimental Engineering Section at Wright-Patterson with rank of major. He then attended the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama, graduating in March 1941. Named assistant of the Aircraft Projects Branch at Wright-Patterson he became chief of the branch in July 1941 and was promoted lieutenant colonel that November.

In October 1942, Craigie, then a colonel, became the first pilot of the Armed Forces to fly a jet-propelled plane when he piloted the XP-59 on its initial flight at Muroc Dry Lake, California, March 1943 he was assigned briefly to the 1st Fighter Command at Mitchel Field, New York, and the following month took command of the Boston Air Defense Wing in Massachusetts. Three months later he commanded the New York Fighter Wing and was advanced to brigadier general in September.

That November he returned to Mitchel as commanding general of the 87th Fighter Wing. He went to Corsica in the North African Theater in March 1944 as commander of the 12th Air Force&#x27;s 63rd Fighter Wing. He was in command when the invasion of southern France was launched from Corsica in August 1944. In November 1944, he was back at Wright-Patterson as deputy chief of the Air Technical Service&#x27;s Engineering Division. He became chief of the division in August 1945 and was promoted to major general in July 1946.

In 1947, he became chief of the Research and Engineering Division at Headquarters Army Air Force. That October he was appointed Director of Research and Development under the deputy chief of staff for material at Headquarters U.S. Air Force, and the following September returned to Wright-Patterson as commandant of the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology. During the first year of the Korean War Craigie became vice commander of the Far East Air Forces in Tokyo, and for three months in 1951 served as the Air Force delegate on the United Nations Armistice Negotiations Team at the truce talks. In November 1951, he returned to U.S. Air Force Headquarters in Washington as Deputy Chief of Staff for Research and Development. He was promoted to lieutenant general July 5, 1952. In April 1954, he took command of NATO&#x27;s Allied Air Forces Southern Europe (Italy, Greece and Turkey), at Naples, Italy.

==Awards==
Craigie received the Air Medal and two awards of the Legion of Merit for his World War II service. He received the Silver Star, Distinguished Flying Cross and two awards of the Distinguished Service Medal for his Korean War service.

==In retirement==
Following a heart attack in the Bavarian Alps, he retired from the Air Force on June 30, 1955. In December, he and his wife Victoria moved to Burbank, California, where he began a 25-year career in private industry. In 1956, he was a vice president of Hydro-Aire, Inc, and the following year a vice president of American Machine &amp; Foundry Co. From 1957 to 1964 he was director of the Air Force requirements section for Lockheed Aircraft Corp.

Since 1963, he was a director of the Flying Tiger Line (a freight airline), and was on the board of Hungry Tiger, Inc. He was also on the board of directors of the Falcon Foundation since 1965. In 1971, he was with the International Science Foundation. He was self-employed as a consultant after 1971.

In May 1990, he and his wife moved into a retirement community for retired service people in Riverside, California, where he died on February 27, 1994. He was cremated, and his ashes were divided between West Point Cemetery and the United States Air Force Academy Cemetery.

==Family==
Laurence Craigie&#x27;s brother, Second Lieutenant Karl Harrold Craigie (1898–1973), A.S.A., U.S.A., was a World War I aviator. His other brother also served during the Great War—Hugh H. Craigie, Corp., Co. L, 33d U.S. (Reg.) Infantry. He was also the grandfather of folk singer John Craigie.

<text>José Mário dos Santos Mourinho Félix (; born 26 January 1963) is a Portuguese professional football manager and former player who is currently the head coach of Süper Lig club Fenerbahçe. Dubbed “The Special One” by the media, he is one of the most decorated managers and is widely considered to be among the greatest managers of all time. Mourinho has won league championships in four countries, is one of only six managers to have won the European Cup with two clubs, and is the only manager to have won all three current UEFA club competitions.

After an uneventful career as a midfielder in the Portuguese leagues, Mourinho finished playing at age 24 and moved into coaching. He was first an interpreter for Bobby Robson at Sporting CP and Porto, before gaining success as an assistant at Barcelona under Robson and then his successor, Louis van Gaal. After brief stints as manager at Benfica and União de Leiria, Mourinho returned to Porto in 2002, winning two Primeira Liga titles, the Taça de Portugal, the UEFA Cup and the UEFA Champions League. That success earned him a move to England with Chelsea in 2004, where he famously remarked &quot;I think I&#x27;m a special one&quot; at his first press conference, which led to the British media dubbing him &quot;The Special One&quot;. With Chelsea, Mourinho won two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and two League Cups in three seasons, before he departed in 2007 amid reports of disagreements with owner Roman Abramovich.

In 2008, Mourinho joined Italian club Inter Milan. He led them to the Serie A title in his first season before winning a continental treble of Serie A, the Coppa Italia and the UEFA Champions League in 2010, a first in history for an Italian club. This made him one of five coaches to have won the European Cup with two clubs, and later that year saw him crowned the inaugural FIFA World Coach of the Year. Mourinho then moved to Real Madrid in Spain, where he won the La Liga title in 2011–12, breaking numerous domestic records including for most points, goals and wins in a season, and becoming the fifth coach to win league titles in four countries. Mourinho left Real Madrid in 2013 and rejoined Chelsea, where he won another league title and League Cup, but was dismissed in 2015 after a poor run of results.

Mourinho was appointed at Manchester United in 2016 and Tottenham Hotspur in 2019, but his tenures at both clubs ended acrimoniously. Despite this, Mourinho won the UEFA Europa League and League Cup with Manchester United and led Tottenham to a League Cup final, but was fired less than a week before it. He was the manager of Roma between 2021 and 2024, where he won the inaugural UEFA Europa Conference League in his first season: it was the club&#x27;s first European title and first trophy since 2008 and made Mourinho the first manager to win a major European competition with four clubs and the third manager to win all UEFA club competitions. He then joined Fenerbahçe.

Mourinho was named Portuguese Coach of the Century by the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) in 2015. Due to his tactical knowledge, charismatic and controversial personality, and a reputation for prioritising results over attractive football, he has drawn comparisons, by both admirers and critics, with Argentine manager Helenio Herrera.

==Early life, playing career and education==
Mourinho was born in 1963 to a large middle-class family in Setúbal (a city in the Lisbon metropolitan area), Portugal, the son of José Manuel Mourinho Félix, who was known by the name Félix Mourinho, and his wife, Maria Júlia Carrajola dos Santos. His father played football professionally for Belenenses and Vitória de Setúbal, earning one cap for Portugal in the course of his career. His mother was a primary school teacher from an affluent background; her uncle funded the construction of the Vitória de Setúbal football stadium. The Carnation Revolution leading to the fall of António de Oliveira Salazar&#x27;s &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime in April 1974 also led to the family losing all but a single property in nearby Palmela.

Mourinho wanted to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and joined the Belenenses youth team. Graduating to the senior level, he left the club in 1980 to sign for Rio Ave, where he played for the reserve team, and in 1981, was joined by his father, who was named first team manager. There, he struck up a prolific partnership with veteran striker Mário Reis. According to former teammate Baltemar Brito (who would become an assistant to Mourinho early on his managerial career), the duo scored around 100 goals, with Mourinho netting forty-seven times. In addition to playing for the reserves, Mourinho was usually tasked with scouting other teams for his father. He was rarely selected by his father, but he made his debut for the club in the third round of the Taça de Portugal, in a 2–1 extra time win over Salgueiros. On the final day of the campaign against champions-elect Sporting CP, a defender was injured in the pre-match warm up, so he was told to get changed. Club president José Maria Pinho, fearing the threat of nepotism, overruled the decision to do so; the incident saw the pair leave to join Belenenses in the summer. Mourinho mostly spent the season playing for the reserve team, and he played for the first team in the second round of the Taça de Portugal against Clube Desportivo de Vila Franca, an amateur club from Vila Franca do Campo, São Miguel Island, Azores. With Belenenses 8–0 up at half-time, Mourinho came on as a second-half substitute and scored a hat-trick as the team won 17–0, which remains the club&#x27;s biggest ever victory in the tournament. When his father returned to Rio Ave, Mourinho did not go with him and continued to play in the lower levels of the Portuguese football league system, first with Sesimbra, and then for Comércio e Indústria, where he finished his career. At the latter club, he was captain of the team and would save the life of a teammate who had gotten trapped in a car that had caught on fire. Mourinho decided that he lacked the requisite pace and power to become a professional and chose to focus on becoming a football coach instead.

=== Education ===
Mourinho failed in the subject of mathematics during the final year of high school, and this prevented him from finishing high school in time to enroll at the physical education college as was his wish, but later on, after finishing high school in the special examination period of September, his mother enrolled him in a private business school because there were no vacant seats for him in the physical education college and, in addition, his mother believed business school would bring him to a more successful career path. Mourinho dropped out of business school on his first day, deciding he would rather focus on sport, and chose to attend the Instituto Superior de Educação Física (ISEF) to study physical education. After 1989, the Higher Institute of Physical Education (ISEF) became the Faculdade de Motricidade Humana (FMH), or Faculty of Human Kinetics, in English, and since then it has been a part of the Technical University of Lisbon that would award a honoris causa doctorate degree to Mourinho in 2009. After he concluded his education in ISEF, he attended coaching courses held by the English and Scottish Football Associations. In this period of his life, former Scotland manager Andy Roxburgh took note of the young Portuguese&#x27;s drive and attention to detail. Mourinho sought to redefine the role of coach in football by mixing coaching theory with motivational and psychological techniques.

==Coaching career==
After leaving his job as a physical education school teacher, Mourinho looked for a path into professional football management in his hometown and became youth team coach at Vitória de Setúbal in the early 1990s. Later, he accepted the position of assistant manager at Estrela da Amadora, then was a scout at Ovarense. Then, in 1992, an opportunity arose to work as a translator for a top foreign coach: Bobby Robson had been appointed as the new manager of Lisbon club Sporting CP and needed an English-speaking local coach to work as his interpreter. His presentation was on 7 July, alongside president Sousa Cintra, manager Robson and Manuel Fernandes.

Mourinho began discussing tactics and coaching with Robson in his interpreting role. Robson was sacked by the club in December 1993. When Porto appointed him as their head coach, Mourinho moved with him, continuing to coach and interpret for players at the new club. The Porto team, consisting of players like Ljubinko Drulović, Domingos, Rui Barros, Jorge Costa and Vítor Baía, went on to dominate Portuguese football the following years. With Robson as head coach and Mourinho as his assistant, Porto reached the 1993–94 UEFA Champions League semi-finals and won the 1993–94 Taça de Portugal, the 1994–95 and 1995–96 Portuguese championship, and the 1994, 1995 and 1996 Portuguese Super Cup, the latter with a 5–0 victory over arch-rivals Benfica, in what proved to be Robson&#x27;s last game at Porto, earning Robson the nickname &quot;Bobby Five-O&quot; in Portugal.

After two years at Porto, the duo moved again, joining Barcelona in 1996. Mourinho gradually became a prominent figure of the club&#x27;s staff by translating at press conferences, planning practice sessions and helping players through tactical advice and analyses of the opposition. Robson and Mourinho&#x27;s styles complemented each other: the Englishman favoured an attacking style, while Mourinho covered defensive options, and the Portuguese&#x27;s love of planning and training combined with Robson&#x27;s direct man-management. The Barcelona attack was led by a prime Ronaldo – whom Mourinho regards as the best player post-Diego Maradona. The partnership was fruitful and Barcelona finished the season by winning the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, the Copa del Rey and Supercopa de España. Robson moved clubs the following season but this time Mourinho did not follow, as Barcelona were keen to retain him as assistant manager. The two remained good friends and Mourinho later reflected on the effect Robson had had upon him:

He began working with Robson&#x27;s successor, Louis van Gaal, and he learned much from the Dutchman&#x27;s conscientious style. Both assistant and head coach combined their studious approach to the game and Barcelona won La Liga twice in Van Gaal&#x27;s first two years as coach. Van Gaal saw that his number two had the promise to be more than a skilled assistant. He let Mourinho develop his own independent coaching style and entrusted him with the coaching duties of Barcelona B. Van Gaal also let Mourinho take charge of the first team (acting as Mourinho&#x27;s assistant himself) for certain trophies, like the Copa Catalunya, which Barcelona won in 2000.

==Managerial career==

===Benfica===
The chance to become a top-tier manager arrived in September 2000 when Mourinho was appointed as the replacement for Benfica manager Jupp Heynckes after the fourth week of the Primeira Liga.

The Benfica hierarchy wanted to appoint Jesualdo Ferreira as the new assistant coach, but Mourinho refused and picked Carlos Mozer, a retired Benfica defender, as his right-hand man instead. Mourinho was highly critical of Ferreira, whom he had first encountered as his teacher at ISEF and later lambasted the veteran coach by stating, &quot;This could be the story of a donkey who worked for 30 years but never became a horse.&quot;

Only weeks after being given the job at Benfica, Mourinho&#x27;s mentor, Bobby Robson, offered him the assistant manager&#x27;s role at Newcastle United. Such was Robson&#x27;s desperation for Mourinho to join him he offered to step down after two years in charge and hand over the reins to Mourinho. Mourinho turned the offer down and said he knew Robson would never step down at the club he loved.

Mourinho and Mozer proved a popular combination, enjoying a 3–0 win against rivals Sporting CP in December. Their reign appeared to be at risk after Benfica&#x27;s election turned against club president João Vale e Azevedo and the newly elected Manuel Vilarinho said that he would instate ex-Benfica player Toni as his new coach. Although Vilarinho had no intention of firing him immediately, Mourinho used the victory over Sporting to test the president&#x27;s loyalty and he asked for a contract extension. Vilarinho refused the demand and Mourinho resigned from his position immediately. He left the club on 5 December 2000 after just nine league games in charge. Upon later reflection, Vilarinho rued his poor judgement and expressed his frustration at losing Mourinho:

===União de Leiria===
Mourinho found a new managerial post in July 2001 with União de Leiria. During his time at União de Leiria, the team was on a run contesting places as high as third and fourth. After a 1–1 draw against Santa Clara on 20 January 2002, Mourinho recorded eight matches unbeaten in the league (six wins, two draws) since 25 November 2001. And the team was in fourth place, one point ahead of Porto, one point behind Benfica and six points behind the top of the league table. Mourinho&#x27;s successes at Leiria did not go unrecognised and he caught the attention of larger Portuguese clubs.

===Porto===
Mourinho was then chosen by Porto to replace Octávio Machado on 23 January 2002. At this time, Porto was in fifth place in the Liga (behind Sporting CP, Boavista, União de Leiria and Benfica), had been eliminated from the Taça de Portugal and was in last place in their UEFA Champions League second group stage. Mourinho guided the team to third place that year after a strong 15-game run (including 11 wins) and gave the promise of &quot;making Porto champions next year&quot;.

He quickly identified several key players as the backbone of what he believed would be a perfect Porto team: Vítor Baía, Ricardo Carvalho, Costinha, Deco, Dmitri Alenichev and Hélder Postiga. He recalled captain Jorge Costa after a six-month loan to Charlton Athletic. Signings from other clubs included Nuno Valente and Derlei from União de Leiria; Paulo Ferreira from Vitória de Setúbal; César Peixoto from Belenenses; Pedro Emanuel from Boavista; and Edgaras Jankauskas and Maniche, who both had been out of contract at Benfica.

====2002–03: First league title and European treble====
In 2003, Mourinho won his first Primeira Liga with a 27–5–2 record, 11 points clear of Benfica, the team he quit two years earlier. The total of 86 points out of the possible maximum of 102 was a Portuguese record, until the 2015–16 season won by Benfica (88 points), since the rule of three points per win was introduced. Mourinho also won the Taça de Portugal, beating former club Leiria in the final, and the UEFA Cup final against Celtic, both in May 2003.

====2003–04: Final season and Champions League title====
The following season witnessed further successes: he led Porto to victory in the one-match Portuguese Super Cup, beating Leiria 1–0. They lost the UEFA Super Cup 1–0 to Milan, with Andriy Shevchenko scoring the only goal. The team was dominant in the Primeira Liga and finished the season with a perfect home record, an eight-point advantage and a 27-match unbeaten run that ran from the start of the season until early April, when they lost to Gil Vicente. They secured the title five weeks before the end of the season. Porto lost the 2004 Taça de Portugal Final to Benfica in May 2004, but two weeks later, Mourinho won a greater prize: the UEFA Champions League, with a 3–0 win over Monaco in Germany. The club had eliminated Manchester United, Lyon and Deportivo de La Coruña and their sole defeat of the competition came against Real Madrid in the group round.

In the first leg between Manchester United and Porto, United manager Alex Ferguson confronted Mourinho after Roy Keane received a red card for stamping on Vítor Baía. In the second leg at Old Trafford, Porto were on the verge of an away-goals defeat when Costinha scored in the 89th minute to win the tie. Mourinho flamboyantly celebrated the goal by leaving his dugout, punching the air as he sprinted down the sideline near to his celebrating players. Mourinho&#x27;s Porto win over Ferguson&#x27;s United was a preview of his move to the Premier League managing Chelsea, where the two men would enjoy a competitive but respectful relationship. In 2005, after Chelsea clinched the Premier League title, Ferguson had his players form a guard of honour at Chelsea&#x27;s next game at Old Trafford, a favour that Mourinho returned in 2007 at Stamford Bridge, after Ferguson&#x27;s squad were confirmed league champions.

Liverpool offered their managerial position to Rafael Benítez, and Mourinho instead accepted a large offer from Roman Abramovich and pledged his immediate future to Chelsea.

===Chelsea===
On 2 June 2004, Mourinho moved to Chelsea on a three-year contract, after a £1.7 million compensation package was agreed with Porto, making him the first Portuguese manager in the Premier League. In a press conference upon joining the English side, Mourinho spoke on Chelsea&#x27;s credentials, stating: &quot;We have top players and, sorry if I&#x27;m arrogant, we have a top manager&quot;, before adding,

This comment resulted in the media dubbing him &quot;The Special One&quot;, and his braggadocio was widely recognised during his early managerial career. Mourinho recruited his backroom staff from Porto, consisting of assistant manager Baltemar Brito, fitness coach Rui Faria, chief scout André Villas-Boas and goalkeeping coach Silvino Louro. He retained Steve Clarke, a long-serving former player at Chelsea, who had also performed an assistant managerial-type role under previous managers at the club. In terms of spending, Mourinho carried on where his predecessor Claudio Ranieri left off, as, bankrolled by Roman Abramovich, he spent in excess of £70 million in transfer fees on players such as Tiago (£10 million) from Benfica, Michael Essien (£24.4 million) from Lyon, Didier Drogba (£24 million) from Marseille, Mateja Kežman (£5.4 million) from PSV and Porto pair Ricardo Carvalho (£19.8 million) and Paulo Ferreira (£13.3 million).

====2004–06: First trophies in England====
Under Mourinho, Chelsea built on the potential developed in the previous season. By early December, they were at the top of the Premier League table and had reached the knock-out stages of the Champions League. He secured his first trophy by winning the League Cup against Liverpool 3–2 (AET) in Cardiff. Towards the end of the match, Mourinho was escorted from the touchline after putting his finger to his mouth in the direction of Liverpool fans, as a response to taunts directed towards him whilst Liverpool were leading, before the equalising goal.

Chelsea met Barcelona in the Champions League round of 16, a highly contested match where the Blues lost away in the first leg 2–1 but advanced on aggregate, winning at home 4–2. In the quarter-finals against Bayern Munich, Mourinho who was banned from attending the stadium, waited in the dressing room before the match to talk to his players, then he hid in a laundry basket to leave the stadium. Later on, he missed the chance of back-to-back Champions League successes when Chelsea were knocked out of the competition by a controversial goal in the semi-finals by eventual winners Liverpool. Under Mourinho, Chelsea secured their first top-flight domestic title in 50 years, setting a string of English football records in the process, including the most points ever achieved in the Premier League (95) and the fewest goals conceded (15).

Chelsea started the next season well: they defeated Arsenal 2–1 to win the 2005 FA Community Shield and topped the Premier League from the first weekend of the 2005–06 season. Chelsea beat rivals Manchester United 3–0 to win their second consecutive Premier League title and Mourinho&#x27;s fourth domestic title in a row. After the presentation of his championship medal, Mourinho threw Robert Huth&#x27;s and blazer into the crowd. Mourinho was awarded a second medal for Huth within minutes, which he also threw into the crowd.

====2006–07: Continued domestic success====
The 2006–07 season saw growing media speculation that Mourinho would leave the club at the season&#x27;s conclusion due to alleged poor relations with owner Roman Abramovich and a power struggle with sporting director Frank Arnesen and Abramovich advisor Piet de Visser. Mourinho later cleared doubts regarding his future at Stamford Bridge, stating that there would only be two ways for him to leave Chelsea: if Chelsea did not offer him a new contract before the expiry of his current deal in June 2010, or if Chelsea were to sack him.

Didier Drogba had the highest scoring season of his career that year and this led to his newly signed strike partner Andrey Shevchenko to be dropped from the starting line-up towards the end of the season by Mourinho. Notably, in the Champions League semi-final match against Liverpool at Anfield, Shevchenko was not even included on the bench. The other high-profile arrival besides Shevchenko was German captain Michael Ballack, a free agent from Bayern Munich who was signed to strengthen the midfield. The Icelandic striker Eiður Guðjohnsen departed the club for Barcelona.

Despite the unrest, Chelsea won the League Cup again by defeating Arsenal at the Millennium Stadium. The possibility of the quadruple was brought to an end on 1 May 2007 when Liverpool eliminated Chelsea from the Champions League on penalties at Anfield, following a 1–1 aggregate draw. Days later, Chelsea drew 1–1 with Arsenal at the Emirates, which secured the Premier League title for Manchester United. This was Mourinho&#x27;s first season without a league title win in five years. Mourinho led Chelsea to a 1–0 victory against Manchester United in the 2007 FA Cup Final, winning in the first final to be played at the rebuilt Wembley. This was his first FA Cup win which meant that he had won every domestic trophy available to a Premier League manager.

There was to be further friction between Mourinho and Abramovich when Avram Grant was appointed as director of football, despite objections from Mourinho. Grant&#x27;s position was further enhanced by being given a seat on the board. In spite of these tensions, the 2007–08 transfer season would see the departure of Dutch winger Arjen Robben to Real Madrid and the arrival of French midfielder Florent Malouda from Lyon.

====2007–08: Departure====
In the first match of the 2007–08 season, Chelsea beat Birmingham City 3–2 to set a new record of 64 consecutive home league matches without defeat. Despite surpassing the record set by Liverpool between 1978 and 1981, the start to the 2007–08 season was less successful than previous starts. The team lost at Aston Villa and followed this with a goalless draw at home to Blackburn Rovers. Their opening game in the UEFA Champions League saw them only manage a 1–1 home draw against the Norwegian team Rosenborg in front of only 24,973 (an almost half-empty stadium), which included an unimpressed owner Roman Abramovich.

Mourinho unexpectedly left Chelsea on 20 September 2007 &quot;by mutual consent&quot;, although there had been a series of disagreements with owner Abramovich. The Chelsea board held an emergency meeting and decided it was time to part with their manager. Mourinho left as the most successful manager in Chelsea&#x27;s history, having won six trophies for the club in three years. He was also undefeated in all home league games. Avram Grant succeeded Mourinho as Chelsea manager but failed to win any trophies in his year in charge and would be sacked at the end of the 2007–08 season. Grant&#x27;s squad managed to reach the final of the Champions League (something Mourinho failed to achieve in his three years at Chelsea), reach the final of the League Cup and maintained the unbeaten home streak at Stamford Bridge. Grant&#x27;s Chelsea also finished second in the Premier League.

===Inter Milan===
On 2 June 2008, Mourinho was appointed the successor of Roberto Mancini at Inter Milan on a three-year contract and brought along with him much of his backroom staff who had served him at both Chelsea and Porto. He chose Giuseppe Baresi, a former Inter player and ex-head coach of their youth academy, as his assistant. He spoke solely in Italian in his first press conference as Inter boss, claiming to have learnt it &quot;in three weeks&quot;. Mourinho stated that he only intended to make a few major signings in the summer. By the end of the transfer window, he had brought three new players to the side: Brazilian winger Mancini (€13 million), Ghanaian midfielder Sulley Muntari for a reported €14 million and Portuguese winger Ricardo Quaresma for a cash/player exchange fee of €18.6 million plus young Portuguese midfielder Pelé.

====2008–09: First Serie A title====
In his first season as Inter head coach, Mourinho won the Supercoppa Italiana, beating Roma on penalties, and finished top of Serie A. Inter were eliminated 2–0 on aggregate by Manchester United in the first knock-out round of the Champions League, and he also failed to win the Coppa Italia, losing 3–1 on aggregate to Sampdoria in the semi-finals. As UEFA was beginning to push the larger clubs in top leagues to play more homegrown players, Mourinho regularly played 18-year-old Italian forward Mario Balotelli and promoted academy defender Davide Santon to the first team permanently, installing an Italian contingent into a team previously composed of mostly foreign players. Both teenagers played a part in the &quot;Scudetto&quot;-winning season and played enough games to earn their first senior trophy.

Despite his domestic successes in winning the &quot;Scudetto&quot; by a 10-point margin, Mourinho&#x27;s first season in Italy was viewed as disappointing by some Inter fans, as the club failed to improve on the performances of his predecessor Roberto Mancini in the Champions League. Inter put in a series of lacklustre group stage performances that included a shock 1–0 home loss to Panathinaikos and an away draw with Cypriot minnows Anorthosis Famagusta. Inter qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League but failed to make it to the quarter-finals after being defeated by Manchester United.

On 16 May 2009, Inter mathematically won the Serie A title after runners-up Milan lost to Udinese. This loss left the &quot;Nerazzurri&quot; seven points above their crosstown rivals with only two games remaining. They would eventually finish 10 points clear of Milan.

====2009–10: Final season in Italy and historic treble====
On 28 July 2009, Mourinho was reported to have shown interest in taking over at Manchester United when Alex Ferguson retired. He was quoted as saying, &quot;I would consider going to Manchester United but United have to consider if they want me to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson. If they do, then of course.&quot;

Adriano left Inter in April 2009, and the exit of the Brazilian striker was followed by the Argentine duo Julio Cruz and Hernán Crespo. Legendary Portuguese attacking midfielder and veteran Luís Figo retired. Figo was on the verge of leaving Inter under Mancini due to a lack of playing time, but in his final season Mourinho used him frequently. Mourinho signed Argentine striker Diego Milito, who fell just one goal short of winning the top scorer award with Genoa, as well as Thiago Motta and Wesley Sneijder, to bolster the midfield. Perhaps his most notable signing of the summer of his second season was a swap deal of Zlatan Ibrahimović in exchange for Barcelona&#x27;s Cameroonian striker Samuel Eto&#x27;o and a reported £35 million. This transfer was the second most expensive in the history of the transfer market, after Cristiano Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid earlier in the summer. Eto&#x27;o got off to a promising start with Inter by scoring two goals in the first two matches of the season.

Ricardo Quaresma&#x27;s signing from Mourinho&#x27;s old club Porto was viewed as providing a previously missing link in the Inter squad, but his play disappointed the club and led him to be loaned out to Chelsea midway through the season, ironically Mourinho&#x27;s other former club. Mancini also failed to dominate in the midfield and addressing these shortcomings in the transfer market became a priority for Inter. Inter&#x27;s lack of a creative playmaker, or &quot;trequartista&quot;, had been blamed for the Champions League failure. In an attempt to deal with this issue, Inter signed Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder from Real Madrid.

Inter struggled in their first two matches of the new season. The team lost the Supercoppa to Lazio 2–1 and drew 1–1 with newly promoted Bari at the San Siro. Mourinho&#x27;s team improved dramatically after that, as he built a formidable midfield with Sneijder at the heart of it and the likes of new signing Thiago Motta and veterans Javier Zanetti and Dejan Stanković. Inter went on to score more than 30 goals before the end of November, thrashing derby rivals Milan 4–0, with new signings Diego Milito and Motta both scoring, and hammering Genoa 5–0, the largest margin of victory in the Serie A that season. Mourinho was sent off in the December &quot;Derby d&#x27;Italia&quot; away fixture after he sarcastically applauded the referee for what he felt was a dubious free-kick given to Juventus and Inter went on to lose 2–1, courtesy of a Claudio Marchisio winner in the second half.

Mourinho achieved what was hailed as one of his career highlights after Inter managed to progress to the Champions League quarter-finals by defeating his former team Chelsea in both legs (2–1 win at San Siro, then followed by a 1–0 win at Stamford Bridge). His difficult relationship with young striker Mario Balotelli and the team&#x27;s loss of form that led Inter to achieve only seven points in six games (with three of those games, including a shock 1–3 defeat at the hands of Sicilian minnows Catania, happening during Mourinho&#x27;s ban) were heavily criticised by the media and pundits.

On 6 April 2010, Mourinho became the first manager in history to take three teams to the semi-finals of the Champions League (this record was equalled by Bayern Munich manager Louis van Gaal a day later) after Inter managed to overcome a 1–0 defeat to CSKA Moscow in Russia in the second leg of their quarter-final tie, which ended 2–0 on aggregate, with Wesley Sneijder&#x27;s goal in the sixth minute proving decisive. This marked the first time in seven years that Inter managed to make the semi-finals of the competition. On 13 April, Inter continued their success in the season by reaching the Coppa Italia final, for the first time under Mourinho, in a 1–0 away (2–0 on aggregate) victory over Fiorentina.

On 28 April 2010, José Mourinho reached the Champions League final for the second time in his career after Inter beat holders Barcelona 3–2 on aggregate, despite losing 1–0 at Camp Nou (which Mourinho called &quot;the most beautiful defeat of my life&quot;). This brought Inter back into a European Cup final 38 years after their last final appearance (a defeat to Ajax). Mourinho was involved in a brief confrontation with Barcelona goalkeeper Víctor Valdés while attempting to join in with the Inter celebrations. Mourinho afterwards stated that &quot;anti-Madridismo&quot; had motivated the Barça fans, suggesting that they were obsessed with reaching the final and winning the tournament on their arch-rival&#x27;s home ground. &quot;Marca&quot; proclaimed that Mourinho had passed the test to become the next head coach of Real Madrid, as their fans celebrated the elimination of Barcelona.

On 2 May, after a 2–0 away win in Rome against Lazio, Inter almost secured the Serie A title. On 5 May 2010, the team won the Coppa Italia, defeating Roma 1–0, and on 16 May 2010, Inter beat Siena 1–0 to secure the domestic double, accomplishing the feat of winning all trophies available for a manager in the Serie A. On 22 May 2010, Inter won the 2010 Champions League after beating Bayern Munich 2–0, and in doing so became the first Italian club to complete the treble, with Mourinho personally celebrating the second Champions League title in his managerial career.

The day after having won the Champions League, Mourinho said that he was &quot;sad, as almost for sure it&#x27;s my last game with Inter&quot;. He then added that &quot;if you don&#x27;t coach Real Madrid then you will always have a gap in your career&quot;. After days of discussions between Real Madrid and Inter, a world-record-breaking compensation package was successfully agreed on 28 May 2010, and Mourinho was consequently released by Inter.

===Real Madrid===
On 28 May 2010, it was confirmed that Mourinho would take over from Manuel Pellegrini at the Santiago Bernabéu. On 31 May 2010, Mourinho was unveiled as the new manager of Real Madrid after signing a four-year contract, and became the eleventh manager at the club in the previous seven years. Mourinho was appointed sporting manager as well as first-team coach, and he was referred to as a &quot;Galáctico&quot;, a term more often used for star players instead of coaches.

Prior to Mourinho&#x27;s arrival, Real Madrid had underperformed, despite paying record transfer fees for &quot;Galácticos&quot; such as Kaká and Cristiano Ronaldo. Their 2009–10 season was marked by disappointments such as &quot;Alcorconazo&quot;, a shock 2009–10 Copa del Rey round of 32 defeat to Segunda División B team Alcorcón, and elimination from the Champions League by Lyon in the round of 16, though they finished second in La Liga with a club record 96 points. By the end of the transfer window, after the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Mourinho had brought four new players to the squad: the Germans Sami Khedira (€13 million) and Mesut Özil (€15 million), Portuguese defender Ricardo Carvalho (€8 million) and Argentine winger Ángel Di María (€25 million plus €11 million on incentives).

====2010–11: First season in Spain====
On 29 August 2010, Real Madrid drew 0–0 at Mallorca in Mourinho&#x27;s first La Liga game as manager. When asked about all the missed opportunities against Levante in La Liga and Auxerre in the Champions League, Mourinho said, &quot;One day some poor rival is going to pay for the chances we&#x27;ve missed today.&quot; The following match at the Bernabéu ended with a 6–1 victory over Deportivo de La Coruña. The following league games confirmed Mourinho&#x27;s statement, defeating Málaga 4–1 and Racing Santander 6–1.

On 29 November 2010, Mourinho&#x27;s Madrid were defeated in his first &quot;El Clásico&quot; encounter against Barcelona. The match, held in Camp Nou, ended 5–0 to the hosts, with Real Madrid director Florentino Pérez regarding it the worst game in the history of Real Madrid. Sporting director Jorge Valdano also criticised Mourinho for his &quot;inability to bring a major correction to the game&quot; and &quot;not leaving his bench for the [majority] of the match&quot;. When asked by a media reporter, Mourinho refused to call the loss a humiliation.

On 30 November 2010, Mourinho was fined £33,500 for appearing to instruct Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos to attempt to receive a tactical second yellow card in the 4–0 Champions League win against Ajax. He was also banned for two Champions League matches. On 22 December 2010, Mourinho won a match by the widest margin in his career, winning 8–0 against Levante, also of La Liga, in the first leg of their quarter-final of the Copa del Rey.

On 20 April 2011, Mourinho won his first trophy in Spanish football as Real Madrid defeated arch-rivals Barcelona 1–0 in the Copa del Rey final held at the Mestalla in Valencia, ending Real Madrid&#x27;s 18-year-long Copa del Rey drought. It was also Real&#x27;s first trophy since their 2007–08 La Liga title. One week later, the two teams met again in the first leg of the semi-finals of the Champions League, Real Madrid&#x27;s furthest progress in the tournament since the 2003 semi-finals, as the club was knocked out in the 2004 quarter-finals, and then from 2005 to 2010 the club had suffered six consecutive exits at the round of 16. At the Bernabéu, Real&#x27;s Pepe was dismissed in the 61st minute and Mourinho was sent to the stands for protesting; afterward, Barça&#x27;s Lionel Messi scored two late goals to take control of the tie. The second leg at Camp Nou finished 1–1, which eliminated Real from the tournament.

====2011–12: Record breaking La Liga title====
On 7 December 2011, Real Madrid defeated Ajax with a 3–0 scoreline and concluded the Champions League group stage with six victories, becoming the fifth team in Champions League history to accomplish the feat. The victory was the team&#x27;s 15th consecutive win to equal a club record set 50 years earlier, in 1961. On 21 April 2012, Real Madrid won 2–1 against Barcelona in &quot;El Clásico&quot; at Camp Nou, extending their lead in La Liga to seven points with four matches remaining. This was the first victory for Real Madrid in La Liga against their archrivals since 2008 and the first overall at Camp Nou since 2007. Also, in this match Real Madrid broke the record for most goals scored in the championship, with 109. Barça manager Pep Guardiola conceded the title to Real Madrid.

Mourinho&#x27;s side advanced to the semi-finals of the Champions League for the second consecutive year. The first leg away finished with a 2–1 win to Bayern Munich. In the second leg at home, Real Madrid took a 2–0 lead from two Cristiano Ronaldo goals but Bayern&#x27;s Arjen Robben (a former Real player whom Mourinho previously managed at Chelsea) converted a penalty to level the aggregate score at 3–3, and Madrid was eliminated in the shootout with Ronaldo, Kaká and Ramos all failing to convert their spot kicks. Bayern manager Jupp Heynckes said that Mourinho &quot;came to the dressing room to congratulate my players and coaching staff after the game. It was very noble&quot;.

On 2 May 2012, Real Madrid won 3–0 against Athletic Bilbao to clinch the Liga title for the first time in four years. On 13 May 2012, Real Madrid defeated Mallorca 4–1 in their last league match of the season, which set records for most games won in a La Liga season (32), most away wins (16), most points obtained in any of the top European leagues (100), improving the most goals scored record they already had set earlier (121) and finishing the season with the highest goal difference (+89). Real Madrid topped the league nine points clear of runners-up Barcelona.

====2012–13: Final season in Madrid====
On 22 May 2012, Mourinho signed a new four-year contract to remain as Real Madrid manager through to 2016. After losing 3–2 in Barcelona in the first leg of the 2012 Supercopa de España, Real Madrid won the return leg in Madrid 2–1. Real Madrid won the competition on the away goals rule after a tie of 4–4 on aggregate. This meant Mourinho had won every domestic title available for a manager in the Spanish top division within two years. He became the only coach who has won the national super cups in four European countries. This also made Mourinho the first manager in history to win every domestic title, the league championship, cup, super cup and league cup (if available) in four European leagues.

Real Madrid reached the semi-finals of the Champions League for the third consecutive year under Mourinho&#x27;s management. The club was defeated 4–1 in the first leg away at Borussia Dortmund. In the second leg at home, Real managed to score two goals in the last 10 minutes, but the team could not get the third goal that would have levelled the aggregate score and sent them through on away goals.

In the post-game press conference after the second leg with Dortmund, Mourinho hinted that the 2012–13 season with Real Madrid would be his last, saying, &quot;I am loved by some clubs, especially one. In Spain it is different, some people hate me, many of you in this [press] room.&quot; Mourinho&#x27;s fraught relationships with Sergio Ramos and club captain Iker Casillas (a popular player whom Mourinho sidelined in 2013) caused divisions between fans in the &quot;Mourinhistas&quot; and &quot;Madridistas&quot; (the more traditional Real Madrid fans) camps. His relationship with Cristiano Ronaldo became difficult because, according to Mourinho, the player &quot;maybe thinks that he knows everything and that the coach cannot improve him anymore&quot;, so was unwilling to accept constructive criticism. Mourinho was also criticised for controversial incidents, including poking Tito Vilanova (then assistant coach at Barcelona) in the eye during a brawl, continual complaints about refereeing bias, clashes with journalists and Real officials, and frequent hints that Barça received favourable treatment from UEFA.

Following the 2013 Copa del Rey final loss to Atlético Madrid on 17 May, Mourinho called the 2012–13 season &quot;the worst of my career&quot;. Three days later, Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez announced Mourinho would leave the club at the end of the season by &quot;mutual agreement&quot;, a year after signing a contract extension to 2016.

===Return to Chelsea===
On 3 June 2013, Chelsea appointed Mourinho as manager for the second time, on a four-year contract. Mourinho told Chelsea TV, &quot;In my career I&#x27;ve had two great passions – Inter and Chelsea – and Chelsea is more than important for me.&quot; &quot;It was very, very hard to play against Chelsea, and I did it only twice which was not so bad.&quot; &quot;Now I promise exactly the same things I promised in 2004 with this difference to add: I&#x27;m one of you.&quot; On 10 June 2013, Mourinho was officially confirmed as Chelsea manager for the second time at a press conference held at Stamford Bridge.

====2013–15: Return and Third Premier League title====
Mourinho&#x27;s first competitive game back in charge of Chelsea ended in a 2–0 home victory against Hull City on 18 August 2013. On 30 August Mourinho faced defending UEFA Champions League winners Bayern Munich in the UEFA Super Cup, which was his second as a manager. Despite taking the lead Chelsea lost to Bayern on penalties as Romelu Lukaku saw his decisive penalty getting saved by Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer. Following the loss to Pep Guardiola&#x27;s Bayern Munich he said, &quot;They take the cup and the best team lost. Even with ten men we played fantastically. Pride is OK but we lost.&quot;

On 29 January 2014, following a 0–0 draw at home to West Ham United, Mourinho described the Hammers as playing &quot;19th century football&quot;, saying, &quot;This is not the best league in the world, this is football from the 19th century,&quot; and, &quot;The only [other] thing I could bring was a Black and Decker to destroy the wall.&quot; In March, recognizing his contributions to the club, Mourinho was given share number 1 by the Chelsea Pitch Owners Association which owns the Stamford Bridge freehold.

On 19 April 2014, Mourinho suffered his first ever home league defeat as Chelsea manager in a 2–1 loss to Sunderland at Stamford Bridge. He consistently played down Chelsea&#x27;s title chances throughout the season and referred to it as a transitional season, slowly moulding his squad and most significantly dropping (and eventually selling) Chelsea&#x27;s player of the year of the two previous seasons, Juan Mata. Chelsea went on to finish third in the 2013–14 Premier League, four points behind champions Manchester City, and was eliminated in the semi-finals of the 2013–14 Champions League by Atlético Madrid.

Chelsea started their 2014–15 Premier League campaign with a 3–1 victory against Burnley on 18 August at Turf Moor. This match marked the first competitive action for new signings Diego Costa, Cesc Fàbregas and Thibaut Courtois, the latter starting in goal after a three-year loan spell at Atlético Madrid. Didier Drogba also made his return appearance to the Chelsea squad, coming off the bench in the second half.

On 24 January 2015, Chelsea were knocked out of the fourth round of the FA Cup with a surprise 2–4 defeat to League One side Bradford City, ending their hopes of a potential quadruple. Mourinho described the defeat as a &quot;disgrace&quot;. On 1 March 2015, Chelsea defeated Tottenham Hotspur 2–0 in the League Cup final to claim their first trophy of the season, and Mourinho&#x27;s first trophy since returning to Chelsea. On 11 March 2015, Chelsea were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League round of 16 after losing to Paris Saint-Germain on away goals.

On 3 May 2015, Chelsea were crowned Premier League champions after beating Crystal Palace with three games to spare. Mourinho was subsequently named as Premier League Manager of the Season, with Chelsea losing just three matches all season.

====2015–16: Second departure====
On 7 August 2015, Mourinho signed a new four-year contract with Chelsea that would have kept him at Stamford Bridge until 2019. On 29 August, Mourinho reached his 100th Premier League home match at Chelsea, which ended in a 2–1 loss to Crystal Palace. Chelsea started the season by picking up just eleven points in their first twelve games in the Premier League. They also went out of the League Cup to Stoke City on penalties on 27 October.

On 17 December 2015, after losing nine of 16 Premier League matches, Chelsea announced that they had parted company with Mourinho &quot;by mutual consent&quot;. The club went on to state: &quot;The club wishes to make clear Jose leaves us on good terms and will always remain a much-loved, respected and significant figure at Chelsea.&quot;

===Manchester United===
====2016–17: Europa League title and double====

On 27 May 2016, Mourinho signed a three-year contract with Manchester United, with an option to stay at the club until at least 2020. On 7 August 2016, Mourinho won his first trophy, the FA Community Shield, beating reigning Premier League champions Leicester City 2–1. Mourinho was victorious in his first Premier League game as United boss, winning 3–1 away to AFC Bournemouth on 14 August 2016.

On 11 September 2016, Mourinho lost his first Manchester derby as a manager in a 2–1 defeat to Manchester City; this was also his eighth loss against his rival manager while with Real Madrid, former Barça manager Pep Guardiola.

On 23 October 2016, Mourinho made his first visit back to Chelsea with Manchester United since leaving in December 2015. The match ended in a 4–0 defeat which left them six points off the top of the table. Mourinho won his second Manchester derby as a manager on 26 October 2016 in a 1–0 victory at Old Trafford in the EFL Cup. Juan Mata scored the only goal of the game in the 54th minute, with the victory being Mourinho&#x27;s fourth against Guardiola (four wins, six draws, eight losses).

Following the charges made by the FA over Mourinho&#x27;s comments about referee Anthony Taylor, Mourinho once again got into trouble with a referee on 29 October when he was sent to the stands by Mark Clattenburg during the 0–0 home draw against Burnley. On 29 January 2017, despite a 2–1 second leg loss away to Hull City, Mourinho&#x27;s United reached the final of the EFL Cup by virtue of a 3–2 aggregate win. Manchester United won 3–2 over Southampton in the EFL Cup Final at Wembley. With the victory, he became the first United manager to win a major trophy in his debut season.

On 24 May 2017, Manchester United won the Europa League courtesy of a 2–0 win over Ajax. This was Mourinho&#x27;s second major trophy of his first season as Manchester United manager. It also maintained his 100% record of winning every major European Cup final as a manager.

====2017–18: Premier League and FA Cup runner-up====
Mourinho strengthened his side further in the summer of 2017, with the signings of Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku, defender Victor Lindelöf and midfielder Nemanja Matić. United made a strong start to the season before a difficult winter schedule widened the gap between them and city rivals Manchester City.

Mourinho was criticised for Manchester United&#x27;s Champions League exit to Sevilla at the last-sixteen stage, which resulted in a surprise twelve minute rant from Mourinho defending his United career. Manchester United finished second in the table – the club&#x27;s best result since the departure of Alex Ferguson five years prior – after a 1–0 home defeat to West Bromwich Albion, finishing nineteen points behind Manchester City. United also lost the 2018 FA Cup Final to Mourinho&#x27;s former club Chelsea after an Eden Hazard penalty sealed a 1–0 win for the Blues.

====2018–19: Final season in Manchester====
After a poor start to the 2018–19 season which saw Manchester United lose two of their opening three league games for the first time in 26 years, including a 3–0 home loss to Tottenham Hotspur – the heaviest home defeat of his career – an animated Mourinho demanded &quot;respect&quot; from critical journalists and held up three fingers (one for each Premier League trophy he had won as coach), adding: &quot;I won more Premier Leagues alone than the other 19 managers [in the league] together.&quot; At his next press conference four days later, he said: &quot;I am the manager of the one of the greatest clubs in the world but I&#x27;m also one of the greatest managers in the world.&quot;

At the end of a Manchester United league game at Mourinho&#x27;s former club Chelsea on 20 October 2018, Mourinho was involved in a tunnel incident. With Chelsea&#x27;s Ross Barkley scoring a 96th-minute equaliser, a Chelsea coach, Marco Ianni, celebrated the goal by running across the Manchester United bench and clenching his fists close to Mourinho&#x27;s face. An incensed Mourinho leapt up and attempted to chase Ianni down the tunnel, with security intervening. As he sat back down, some Chelsea fans repeatedly (and loudly) started chanting against Mourinho. At full-time, Mourinho walked over to United fans and applauded, and on his way back to the tunnel he held up three fingers towards Chelsea fans, reminding them he won three Premier League titles for the club.

After starting the 2018–19 season with just seven wins in the first 17 Premier League games, leaving Manchester United 19 points behind the league leaders, Mourinho was sacked by the club on 18 December 2018.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
On 20 November 2019, Mourinho was appointed as the manager of Tottenham Hotspur on a four-year contract, replacing the sacked Mauricio Pochettino.

====2019–20: First season with Tottenham====
On 23 November 2019, Mourinho managed his first match with Tottenham Hotspur in a 3–2 away win against West Ham United. He later sparked media attention on 26 November 2019, when he claimed that ball boy Callum Hynes &#x27;assisted&#x27; Spurs&#x27; second goal in a 4–2 win over Olympiacos in the Champions League. In the Champions League round of 16, Tottenham Hotspur lost both matches to be defeated 0–4 on aggregate against RB Leipzig.

Mourinho recorded his 300th win in English football when Tottenham beat West Ham United 2–0 on 23 June 2020. He secured his first ever win as a manager at St James&#x27; Park on 15 July 2020 when Tottenham defeated Newcastle by a scoreline of 3–1. Mourinho finished his first season with Tottenham Hotspur at sixth position in the Premier League.

====2020–21: Cup final and dismissal====
On 4 October 2020, Mourinho managed Tottenham Hotspur to a 6–1 win against his former club Manchester United at Old Trafford. A 2–0 victory over Arsenal on 6 December 2020 put Tottenham on top of the Premier League and meant Mourinho was only the club&#x27;s second manager to win his first two North London derbies. A last-minute 2–1 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield saw them drop to second place, three points off the top.

On 10 February 2021, Tottenham were knocked out of the FA Cup, losing 5–4 after extra time to Everton in the quarter-finals; this was the first time since 2010 that a José Mourinho-led team had conceded five goals in a match. On 23 February 2021, Tottenham lost 1–0 to Chelsea, marking the first time in his career that Mourinho had lost two consecutive home games. On 18 March, Tottenham lost 3–0 to Dinamo Zagreb after extra time in the second leg of the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League round of 16, being eliminated from the competition 3–2 on aggregate.

On 19 April 2021, Mourinho was sacked by Tottenham Hotspur after 17 months in charge of the club, days before the EFL Cup Final against Manchester City. This marked the first time Mourinho had departed a club without winning a trophy since 2002. He was replaced by former Tottenham player Ryan Mason as interim manager.

===Roma===

On 4 May 2021, Mourinho was appointed head coach of Roma from the start of the 2021–22 season, replacing compatriot Paulo Fonseca.

====2021–22: Ending Roma&#x27;s trophy drought and UEFA Treble====
In his first transfer window at Roma, Mourinho brought in several significant signings in the summer. His first move in the transfer market was the permanent signing of Atalanta defender Roger Ibañez for a fee of €8m on 1 July. He also identified some areas in which the team required improvement, leading Roma to sign Portuguese goalkeeper Rui Patrício (€11.5 million), Uruguayan defender Matías Viña (€13 million) and two strikers Uzbek Eldor Shomurodov (€17.5 million) and English Tammy Abraham (€40 million). To offset this spending, and to adhere to UEFA Financial Fair Play regulations, Mourinho sanctioned the departure of several players, including first-team players Juan Jesus, Edin Džeko, Pedro, and Javier Pastore, while also incorporating academy players into the first team such as Pietro Boer, Edoardo Bove and Nicola Zalewski, with the latter replacing Leonardo Spinazzola, after he ruptured his Achilles tendon during the UEFA Euro 2020.

On 19 August 2021, Mourinho managed his first match with Roma in a 2–1 away win against Trabzonspor in the first leg of the UEFA Europa Conference League play-off round. Three days later, he made his return to Serie A, after eleven years, managing a 3–1 home victory over Fiorentina at Stadio Olimpico. On 26 August, Mourinho secured qualification for the Europa Conference League, after overseeing a 3–0 home win against Trabzonspor in the play-off second leg. Mourinho reached 1,000 games as a manager in a 2–1 win against Sassuolo on 12 September 2021. On 26 September against Lazio, Roma lost 2–3, and Mourinho became the first Roma manager to lose his first Serie A Roma&#x27;s derby since Luis Enrique in 2011. On 21 October, in a Conference League game against Bodø/Glimt, Roma suffered a humiliating 1–6 defeat, marking the first time that one of Mourinho&#x27;s sides conceded 6 goals in a single match; Mourinho blamed the defeat on &#x27;not having a very good squad&#x27;.
Ten days later against Milan, Mourinho suffered his first home defeat in league games in Italy; before this match, he was unbeaten in 43 consecutive games matches.

On 4 December, against Inter, Roma was defeated 3–0, marking was the first time in Mourinho&#x27;s career that one of his teams was 3–0 down at half-time; he said after the match that Inter &#x27;are stronger than Roma in normal conditions; in non-normal conditions, they are much stronger&#x27;. In order to reinforce the team for the second part of the season, in the winter transfer window, Roma signed Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Sérgio Oliveira, both on loan from Arsenal and Porto, respectively. On 20 March 2022, Mourinho won his first &quot;Derby della Capitale&quot; after managing a 3–0 win over Lazio.

On 5 May, Mourinho guided Roma to their first European final since 1991 by beating Leicester City 2–1 on aggregate in the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League, making him the first manager to reach the final of all three current major European competitions and the first manager to reach a major European final with four clubs. On 24 May, Mourinho won his first title with Roma by defeating Feyenoord in the 2022 UEFA Europa Conference League Final. This was Roma&#x27;s first trophy in 11 years, making him the third manager – after Udo Lattek and Giovanni Trapattoni – to have won all three existing major European trophies, and the first to achieve the UEFA treble by winning the Champions League, UEFA Cup/Europa League, and Europa Conference League (in place of the defunct UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup). It was also the first time a Serie A team won a continental championship since Inter Milan&#x27;s 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, achieved under Mourinho himself as coach.

====2022–23: Back-to-back European finals====

In his second transfer window at Roma to prepare for the 2022–23 season, due to UEFA&#x27;s Financial Fair Play regulations, the club only spent €7 million in the market with incomings players being signed by free transfers and loans, including Turkish defender Zeki Çelik from Lille, the Serbians Nemanja Matić and Mile Svilar, and Italian striker Andrea Belotti on free transfers, and Dutch midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum on loan from Paris Saint-Germain. The most notable signing of Roma&#x27;s transfer window was the acquisition of Argentine forward Paulo Dybala on a free transfer after his contract with Juventus had expired.

The club began their league season with a 1–0 away win over Salernitana on 14 August 2022. Afterwards, Roma embarked on a four-game unbeaten streak, before suffering their first defeat of the season, losing 4–0 against Udinese, on 4 September, marking Mourinho&#x27;s largest defeat in his Serie A&#x27;s career and the third time that he had lost with a margin of more than four goals in a top-flight league match in his career. After the match, he said that he &quot;preferred losing one match 4–0 than four matches 1–0&quot;. On 1 October, Roma recorded their first win against Inter since February 2017.

Prior to deadline day, following Wijnaldum&#x27;s injury and the departures of Matías Viña and Nicolò Zaniolo, with the latter falling out with the club&#x27;s hierarchy, Roma delved into the winter transfer market to sign Norwegian forward Ola Solbakken on a free transfer, Guinean midfielder Mady Camara on loan from Olympiacos and Spanish defender Diego Llorente on loan from Leeds United. On 1 February 2023, Roma were knocked out of the Coppa Italia, losing 2–1 at home to Cremonese. On 28 February, Roma was beaten again by Cremonese, the latter&#x27;s first win in Serie A in 27 years. After drawing with Juventus earlier in the season, a 1–0 win over them at Stadio Olimpico on March 5 meant for the first time that Roma stayed unbeaten against Juventus in a Serie A season since 2003–04 campaign.

Despite a challenging season for Mourinho due to inconsistencies and injuries to key players, on 18 May he guided Roma to their second consecutive European final, beating former Real Madrid player Xabi Alonso&#x27;s Bayer Leverkusen 1–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals of the Europa League, repeating the same feat during his time at Porto of reaching back-to-back European finals in 2003 and 2004. Following a 2–2 home draw to Salernitana in Serie A, Mourinho admitted that &quot;Champions League qualification would be more than a miracle&quot; for Roma, after disagreeing with Roma&#x27;s sporting director Tiago Pinto comments that Champions League qualification was the main goal for Roma&#x27;s season, adding that &quot;we can write history and want to continue doing it, but qualifying for the Champions League when spending €7 million on the transfer market is more than history, more than a miracle. It&#x27;s Jesus Christ coming to Rome and having a walk around the Vatican.&quot;

According to &quot;Corriere dello Sport&quot;, the relationship between Mourinho and Roma directors had turned frosty as the two parties had different views on the club&#x27;s future, with Mourinho becoming increasingly frustrated over a lack of financial backing at Roma, due to the club&#x27;s Financial Fair Play restrictions, leading to some disagreements over potential transfers, as he wanted reassurances from the Roma owners before committing his future to the club, amid reports that Mourinho was in advance negotiations to become Paris Saint-Germain&#x27;s new manager.

In the Europa League final on May 31, Mourinho managed his sixth European final, as Roma faced Sevilla, losing 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw in extra-time. This was Mourinho&#x27;s first loss in a European final. After the presentation of his runner-up medal, Mourinho gave his medal to a young Roma supporter. In the press conference after the match, Mourinho said that &quot;he wanted to stay&quot; at Roma but that he also &quot;wanted conditions to give more&quot;, as he was &quot;tired of acting as a manager, director of communications and complain about referee&#x27;s decisions&quot;.

==== 2023–24: Struggles and fourth consecutive early departure====
In his third season, due to Roma&#x27;s limited transfer budget due to Financial Fair Play regulations, following the same transfer policy as the previous season, various players were signed on free transfers or loans, including Argentine midfielder Leandro Paredes and Renato Sanches from Paris Saint-Germain, Houssem Aouar and Evan Ndicka on free transfers, and the loan of Romelu Lukaku from Chelsea, whom Mourinho had previously managed at Manchester United.

After enduring a difficult start to the season, with the club near the relegation zone, on 17 September, Mourinho registered the biggest win in Serie A since April 1961, when Roma thrashed Empoli 7–0 at home.

Following a negative string of results that left Roma in ninth place, five points behind the UEFA Champions League qualification spots, and two consecutive losses against Lazio in the 2023–24 Coppa Italia quarter-finals and AC Milan in the league, Roma announced on 16 January 2024 that they parted ways with Mourinho with immediate effect.

=== Fenerbahçe ===
On 1 June 2024, Turkish side Fenerbahçe confirmed that Mourinho had officially begun negotiations with the club over their head coach role. The following day, he was officially unveiled as the club&#x27;s new manager and presented to the fans during a special ceremony at the Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium. Following the team&#x27;s 1–1 draw with Manchester United in the Europa League, and the fact that his team was denied a second half penalty, he protested the decision and received a red card.

==Manager profile==
===Tactics===
Mourinho has been noted for his tactical prowess, game management, and adaptability to different situations. Teams under Mourinho&#x27;s management typically demonstrate great defensive awareness as well as a quick transition ability with the ball through midfield, in particular down the flanks. A common feature of his teams is playing with three or more central midfielders, as Mourinho has stressed midfield superiority as crucial in winning games. As a Porto manager, Mourinho employed a diamond 4–4–2 formation, with his midfield – consisting of Costinha or Pedro Mendes as defensive midfielder; Maniche and Dmitri Alenichev as wide central midfielders; and Deco on the tip – acting as a cohesive unit rather than a collection of individuals, providing Porto with midfield superiority while allowing the full-backs to move forward. Defensively, the team played with a high defensive line and were known for their fitness and use of heavy pressing high up the pitch.

During his first two years at Chelsea, Mourinho employed a fluid 4–3–3 formation, having Claude Makélélé play the role of deep-lying midfielder. This gave Chelsea a three-against-two midfield advantage over most English teams playing 4–4–2 at the time, and helped Chelsea win Premier League titles in 2004–05 and 2005–06. Mourinho explained:

Look, if I have a triangle in midfield – Claude Makélélé behind and two others just in front – I will always have an advantage against a pure 4–4–2 where the central midfielders are side by side. That&#x27;s because I will always have an extra man. It starts with Makelele, who is between the lines. If nobody comes to him he can see the whole pitch and has time. If he gets closed down it means one of the two other central midfielders is open. If they are closed down and the other team&#x27;s wingers come inside to help, it means there is space now for us on the flank, either for our own wingers or for our full-backs. There is nothing a pure 4–4–2 can do to stop things.

Andrei Shevchenko&#x27;s signing forced Mourinho to switch to a 4–1–3–2 for the 2006–07 season. At Inter, he won his first Serie A title alternating between a 4–3–3 and a diamond, and in his second season, the signings of Samuel Eto&#x27;o, Diego Milito, Wesley Sneijder and Goran Pandev, along with that of Thiago Motta, enabled him to play a 4–2–3–1 formation, after initially using a 4–3–1–2 formation with little success in Europe, despite being effective domestically. In this formation, Cameroonian striker Eto&#x27;o was used out of position as a left-winger, and the 4–2–3–1 effectively became a pure 4–5–1 without the ball; the tactical switch proved to be effective in European competitions in particular, as Inter went on to win the treble that season.

As Real Madrid manager from 2010 to 2013, Mourinho utilised an even more flexible 4–2–3–1 formation, with Xabi Alonso and Sami Khedira as holding midfielders, Mesut Özil as the attacking midfielder, and Cristiano Ronaldo and Ángel Di María flanking Karim Benzema as the lone striker. This formation allowed for rapid counter-attacks, with the four attackers being able to play any of the four offensive positions. Consequently, Benzema would often drop deep to act as a false 9, thus creating space for Cristiano Ronaldo to make runs off the ball into the centre from the left flank and get on the end of passes. In the 2011–12 season, Madrid won La Liga nine points clear of second-placed Barcelona, breaking many records, including points collected (100) and goals scored (121). In all of Mourinho&#x27;s three seasons at Madrid, the team consistently reached the semi-finals of the Champions League. The counter-attacking system pioneered by Mourinho continued, with its variations, to be used to further success at Madrid by his successors Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane.

Mourinho is praised for his quick reactions to a game&#x27;s events. In a 2012–13 Champions League round of 16 second leg encounter with Manchester United at Old Trafford, and with Real Madrid losing 1–0 and facing imminent elimination, United&#x27;s Nani was sent off for a harsh charge on Álvaro Arbeloa. Mourinho quickly introduced Luka Modrić and moved Sami Khedira to the right flank, where Manchester United had a numerical disadvantage due to Nani&#x27;s red card. This forced United manager Alex Ferguson to move Danny Welbeck from the midfield to that flank, thus freeing Xabi Alonso, and two quick goals turned the game in Madrid&#x27;s favour. In the second leg of the 2009–10 Champions League semi-final against Barcelona, Motta&#x27;s controversial sending off led Mourinho to sit deep and narrow in order to defend their lead from the first leg away from home, while Barcelona were allowed to control possession. Mourinho also used his left winger Eto&#x27;o as a makeshift left-sided attacking wing-back. Although Inter lost the second leg 1–0, they advanced to the final 3–2 on aggregate; Mourinho later described the match as &quot;the most beautiful defeat of [his] life.&quot;

Mourinho is also renowned for always being well-informed about his next opponent and tactically outwitting other managers in games. In a 2004 Champions League knockout stage home game between Porto and Alex Ferguson&#x27;s Manchester United, Mourinho had already asserted that United&#x27;s weakness was on the flanks, especially on the left where Quinton Fortune was protected by Ryan Giggs. The central pairing of Maniche and Deco targeted that flank with their threaded passes, and Dmitri Alenichev wreaked havoc. He set up Benny McCarthy&#x27;s equaliser in the first half, then with United focussed on defending the left, Porto switched to the other side, where McCarthy was able to beat Gary Neville and Wes Brown to score the winner.

Mourinho is also acknowledged for his attention to detail, organisational planning and in-game communication. In a 2013–14 Champions League knockout game against Paris Saint-Germain, when Chelsea needed one goal within 10 minutes to progress, he played a risky 4–1–2–3 in the last quarter, which led to Demba Ba&#x27;s winning goal. After the game, Mourinho said that his team had worked excessively on three alternative formations in training:

We trained yesterday with the three different systems we used, the one we started with, the one without [Frank] Lampard and finally the one with Demba and Fernando [Torres] in, and the players knew what to do.

When Ba hit the winner, Mourinho darted down the touchline &quot;in celebration&quot;, but afterwards he said he was primarily running to tell Torres and Ba their positional instructions for the remaining six minutes of the contest, which is backed up by the pictures. Ba&#x27;s job was to sit in front of the defence and mark Alex if he ventured forward, Torres&#x27; to man-mark Maxwell.

On 16 April 2017, Mourinho&#x27;s Manchester United beat league leaders Chelsea 2–0. During the game, Mourinho instructed Ander Herrera to man-mark Eden Hazard. This tactic proved effective as Hazard, and Chelsea, were nullified for large portions of the game. A previously untested strike partnership of Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard also caused the Chelsea defence problems, with the former opening the scoring in the 7th minute. Mourinho&#x27;s tactical organisation throughout the match drew praise within the footballing world.

===Reception===

Since the self proclamation in 2004, Mourinho is often nicknamed &quot;The Special One&quot;. He is widely regarded by several players and coaches to be one of the best managers of his generation and one of the greatest ever managers. In 2010, Pep Guardiola described Mourinho as &quot;probably the best coach in the world&quot;. Pundit Nicky Bandini praised Mourinho for his ability to motivate his players and a create a united team environment during Inter&#x27;s 2009–10 treble winning season, noting that throughout the course of the season playmaker Sneijder went as far to say that he would &quot;kill and die&quot; for Mourinho, views which were later also echoed by the club&#x27;s former striker Ibrahimović, who had worked under Mourinho the previous season, while Dejan Stanković instead said that he &quot;would have thrown [himself] into a fire&quot; for his manager. Eto&#x27;o also praised Mourinho for his player management skills during their time at the club together, describing him as a &quot;unique&quot; head coach, who &quot;...perfectly understood every player and the sentiments of the Inter fans. He knew how to combine these two things, he was perfect.&quot; Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard has stated that Mourinho is the best manager he has ever worked for.

A plethora of Mourinho&#x27;s tactical decisions have been met with criticism. Throughout his career, he has sometimes been accused of playing defensive, dull football to grind out results. In 2011, Morten Olsen concluded that he doesn&#x27;t &quot;like his persona or the way he plays football negatively&quot;. Additionally, Johan Cruyff stated that same year, &quot;Mourinho is a negative coach. He only cares about the result and doesn&#x27;t care much for good football.&quot; Mourinho, along with his compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo, is credited with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in and .

==Media attention and controversies==
===Chelsea===
Following a Champions League tie between Chelsea and Barcelona in March 2005, Mourinho accused referee Anders Frisk and Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard of breaking FIFA rules by having a meeting at half-time. Mourinho said that this biased the referee and caused him to send off Chelsea striker Didier Drogba in the second half. Frisk stated that Rijkaard had tried to speak to him but said that he had sent him away. The situation intensified when Frisk began to receive death threats from angered fans, causing the referee to retire prematurely. UEFA referees chief Volker Roth labelled Mourinho an &quot;enemy of football&quot;, although UEFA distanced themselves from the comment. After an investigation of the incident, Mourinho was given a two-match touchline ban for his behaviour and both Chelsea and the manager were fined by UEFA, though the body confirmed that it did not hold Mourinho personally responsible for Frisk&#x27;s retirement.

On 2 June 2005, Mourinho was fined £200,000 for his part in the meeting with then Arsenal full-back Ashley Cole in January of that year. The pair had met to discuss transfer terms while Cole was still under contract to Arsenal, which was in breach of the Premier League rules. His fine was later reduced to £75,000 after a hearing in August. Later that year, he labelled Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger &quot;a voyeur&quot; after being irked at what he saw as the latter&#x27;s apparent obsession with Chelsea. Wenger was furious with the remark and considered taking legal action against Mourinho. The animosity died down, and the two managers made peace after Mourinho admitted that he regretted making the comment. In February 2014, Mourinho referred to Wenger as a &quot;specialist in failure&quot;.

===Inter Milan===
====Presentation====
On 3 June 2008, during the press conference introducing him as new Inter manager, Mourinho spoke almost perfect Italian. When asked about how he would see players like Frank Lampard or Michael Essien in Italian Serie A, Mourinho realised that this was a way of making him speak about Chelsea players, something he had refused to do in previous questions. Consequently, he replied &quot;&quot; (Milanse Italian for &quot;I&#x27;m not stupid!&quot;).

====Lo Monaco comments====
After Inter defeated Catania 2–1 on 13 September 2008, the opponents&#x27; CEO Pietro Lo Monaco resented the fact that Mourinho had underlined Inter&#x27;s superiority in the match, especially by saying that he could have played in goal for Inter. Lo Monaco stated: &quot;Mourinho andrebbe preso a bastonate sui denti&quot; (Italian for &quot;Mourinho should be beaten on his teeth&quot;). Lo Monaco later clarified that he did not mean to encourage violence, but that it was just a way of saying that Mourinho should shut up. When asked about Lo Monaco&#x27;s statements, Mourinho replied that he did not know him, saying that he only knew other Monacos such as the principality, or Bayern Munich, known in Italy as Bayern Monaco.

====Comparison with Mancini====
On 9 November 2008, after Inter defeated Udinese 1–0 via a late Julio Ricardo Cruz goal, Mourinho had a discussion with the journalist Mario Sconcerti. As the Portuguese manager had underlined on the day before that he was collecting more points during his first Serie A campaign with Inter compared to Roberto Mancini&#x27;s first season, basically with the aim of defending his work, which media considered below expectations, Sconcerti invited Mourinho to avoid comparisons with the Italian manager, who could not respond directly. An annoyed Mourinho replied to Sconcerti asking for honest comparisons and emphasising once again that he was doing better than Mancini.

====Wild celebration against Siena====
On 20 December 2008, after Maicon scored the late winning goal in a difficult away match against Siena, which ended 2–1, Mourinho wildly ran in front of the tiers reserved to Inter supporters to celebrate, hugging the Brazilian himself. In the post-match interview, the journalist Maurizio Pistocchi showed his surprise for Mourinho&#x27;s behaviour, which he considered exaggerated and possibly a lack of respect to Siena supporters. The Portuguese manager replied that he was used to that, recalling his iconic celebration in Old Trafford in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 against Manchester United in 2004, when his team eventually won.

====Statement about the 2006 &quot;Scudetto&quot;====
During the halftime of a January 2009 match against Atalanta, Mourinho was quoted as saying: &quot;The first &quot;Scudetto&quot; was given to you in the secretariat [referencing the controversial 2005–06 Serie A title awarded to third-placed Inter in the aftermath of the &quot;Calciopoli&quot; scandal], the second you won it because there was no one there [to compete against], the third [you won it] at the last minute. You are a shitty team.&quot; Although Mourinho justified himself by stating that &quot;[s]ometimes you need to tell lies to stimulate the players, to piss them off&quot;, he admitted having said the statement.

====&quot;Zeru tituli&quot; conference====
During a press conference on 3 March 2009, Mourinho said that Milan and Roma would end the season with no honours and alleged that Juventus had collected a lot of points thanks to referees&#x27; mistakes; he also accused Italian sport journalists of &quot;intellectual prostitution&quot; on their behalf, as they were focusing on a possible mistake regarding a penalty conceded to Inter against Roma instead of talking about the failures of Inter&#x27;s rivals.

His rant promptly became popular in Italy, especially regarding the &quot;zero titles&quot; quote used by Mourinho, and incorrectly pronounced by him as &quot;zeru tituli&quot; (in correct Italian it would have been &quot;zero titoli&quot;), which was later extensively referred to by football journalists in Italy. It also became the title&#x27;s catchphrase used by fans to celebrate Inter&#x27;s 17th &quot;Scudetto&quot; later that season. The catchphrase was even used by Nike to present the celebration shirts for Inter&#x27;s Serie A title. After the Coppa Italia final in May, fans of Roma&#x27;s cross-town rivals Lazio, the new Coppa Italia winners, quoted Mourinho&#x27;s &quot;zeru tituli&quot; statement by wearing shirts with &quot;Io campione, tu zero titoli&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m a champion, you have no honours&quot;) on them.

During the same press conference, Mourinho also directly attacked Roma manager Luciano Spalletti and Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri: the former as he was used to continuously releasing interviews, in contrast with Mourinho, who disliked that in spite of the fact that he was considered good at it; the latter as he rejected Mourinho&#x27;s claims that his team had taken advantage of referees&#x27; mistakes. Mourinho said that the single time Inter benefitted was an offside goal against Siena.

====Italy national team representatives====
Mourinho once again sparked controversy in the summer with his argument with Italy national team coach Marcello Lippi. Lippi predicted that Juventus would win the &quot;scudetto&quot; in the 2009–10 season, which Mourinho viewed as a disrespectful statement to Inter coming from a national team manager. Lippi responded by saying that it was just a prediction.

After the row with Lippi, he clashed with Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro over Davide Santon&#x27;s place in the Inter squad. Cannavaro had said that Santon might have to leave Inter to get regular playing time to gain selection for Italy in the upcoming World Cup. Mourinho responded by saying that Cannavaro was acting like &quot;a coach, a sporting director or a president&quot;.

====Incident with Ramazzotti====
After Inter drew 1–1 with Atalanta on 13 December 2009, Mourinho attacked the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; journalist Andrea Ramazzotti, who was not allowed to stay near Inter bus according to the Portuguese manager. Ramazzotti had obtained the authorization from both Inter and Atalanta press offices to attend players&#x27; interviews in that spot. Allegedly, Mourinho not only insulted the journalist but also grabbed him, thus causing controversy. A lot of colleagues sided with Ramazzotti, defending the general right to report news without fearing to be attacked and considering the incident very serious. Subsequently, Inter president Massimo Moratti phoned Ramazzotti in order to apologise to him. Furthermore, the Federal Prosecutor referred Mourinho &quot;for having said, towards the sports journalist Andrea Ramazzotti, offensive remarks as well as for having grabbed his forearms&quot;. Inter was also referred for strict liability.

A few days after, Mourinho confronted the journalists in the press conference preceding the Coppa Italia match against Livorno. The Inter manager explained his behaviour and denied he had physically assaulted Ramazzotti, admitting he had said offensive words he was not proud of. In addition, Mourinho admired the solidarity of Ramazzotti&#x27;s colleagues and said that he was not supposed to apologize in public as the situation had not happened in public, trying to play down the incident itself.

====Two draws in a row====
After two away draws in a row against Parma (1–1 on 10 February 2010) and Napoli (0–0 on 14 February), Mourinho defended Inter&#x27;s performances, stating that he was satisfied with collecting two more points on the road to the league title, despite those results not being positive themselves. In particular, the Inter manager used some sharp words regarding Walter Mazzarri and Aurelio De Laurentiis, Napoli&#x27;s respective manager and president.

====Handcuffs gesture====
During the Serie A game against Sampdoria on 22 February 2010, which ended in a 0–0 draw, with two Inter players being sent off in the first half, Mourinho was disappointed by Paolo Tagliavento&#x27;s refereeing. At the end of the first half, the Inter manager made a handcuffs gesture towards a camera which was considered by the Italian Football Federation as violent and critical of the refereeing performance, and caused a three-game ban against Mourinho. Further complaining happened in the second half, when the referee denied Inter a penalty, booking Samuel Eto&#x27;o for diving instead, causing Mourinho to laugh ironically as a sign of complaint. All the supporters in San Siro sided with Mourinho with a &quot;&quot;, a very unusual form of protest in Italy.

====Parames statement====
In February 2010, both Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri and Napoli equivalent Walter Mazzarri released some comments critical of Mourinho: the former said that it was too easy to switch from Chelsea under Roman Abramovich to Massimo Moratti at Inter; the latter stated that he had won more than Mourinho in proportion. Despite Moratti&#x27;s decision to order a press blackout for Inter following controversial refereeing decisions, Mourinho managed to reply to those managers through his spokesman Eladio Parames.

===Real Madrid===
In a 2010–11 Champions League match at Ajax in November 2010, late in the match when Real Madrid were leading 4–0, two Real Madrid players received late second yellow cards related to time-wasting. The result of this meant they were suspended for the final group match even though Madrid would come first in the group, but would benefit by entering the round of 16 without any accumulated yellow cards. It was suggested after an investigation by UEFA that this was a deliberate ploy under Mourinho&#x27;s instruction via two players in a substitution. As a result, UEFA charged Mourinho along with the four related players with improper conduct regarding the dismissals. Although Mourinho denied the allegations, he was fined £33,500 and received a one-match Champions League ban.

On 17 August 2011, in the final of the 2011 Supercopa de España, Mourinho was seen gouging the eye of Barcelona&#x27;s assistant coach Tito Vilanova during a brawl at the end of the game. After the game, Mourinho did not comment on the incident except to claim that he did not know who &quot;Pito&quot; Vilanova was, with &quot;pito&quot; being Spanish slang for penis.

===Manchester United===

The Football Heritage speech was made by Mourinho on March 16, 2018, during a press conference after his Manchester United side lost to Sevilla in the UEFA Champions League. The 2–1 loss was the first time that Manchester United lost to Sevilla in European competition. During his 12-minute speech, Mourinho made various remarks and criticized the management of Manchester United, implying that a club&#x27;s success stems from the caliber of players they sign. Mourinho defended his record of Champions League success in a subsequent press conference before an FA Cup tie against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.

On 23 October 2016, while Mourinho&#x27;s Manchester United was trailing 4–0 against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte waved up the home crowd, urging them to make more noise to support the team. At the end of the match, Mourinho shook Conte&#x27;s hand and whispered into his ear, with media reports claiming Mourinho had accused Conte of trying to humiliate United with his actions. Both managers refused to confirm or deny the report, but Conte disputed claims that he was trying to antagonise Mourinho. Chelsea midfielder Pedro supported Conte, claiming Mourinho&#x27;s reaction was out of context. The two managers continued to trade insults in January 2018, with Conte calling Mourinho &quot;a little man&quot;.

===Roma===
On 26 September 2021, after a loss to Lazio, Mourinho blamed the VAR and the referee for the result. On 24 October, in a goalless draw against Napoli, Mourinho was sent off due to frequent protests against the referee. On 31 October against Milan, the &quot;Giallorossi&quot; coach was fined €10,000 for his &quot;ironic and disrespectful&quot; conduct towards the match official after the final whistle.

On first of December, Roma lost an away game against Bologna. Angry about the referee&#x27;s decisions, Mourinho confronted him after the match to discuss the match incidents. After the match, Mourinho gave a quick press statement in which he advised Roma&#x27;s attacker Nicolò Zaniolo to leave Serie A, hinting on presumed unfair treatment by the referees, Mourinho himself was given a yellow card for frequent protests.

On 5 February 2022, the referee disallowed a final minute goal for Roma against Genoa due to a supposed foul by Tammy Abraham, Mourinho said about the incident &quot;If that is a foul, the game is not the same. You have to change the name of football.&quot; On 19 February against Hellas Verona, Mourinho was red-carded again after kicking the ball and making a telephone gesture toward the referee. Mourinho reportedly told the referee &quot;Juventus sent you&quot;. He was given a two-match touchline ban by the Italian FA and fined 20,000 Euros following the incident.

On 28 February 2023, Mourinho got yet another red card two minutes into the second half during a 2–1 loss to Cremonese, where he was supposedly spoken to and provoked by the fourth official in a disrespectful manner, which resulted in him having the reaction that had him penalised. He said he went to find the official after the game, but he &quot;appears to have forgotten [what he said]&quot;. He was given a two-game ban and fined 10,000 euros for the incident.

===Fenerbahçe===

On November 8, 2024, Mourinho received a 1 game suspension for comments made at a press conference regarding the Süper Lig. Mourinho was quoted attacking the league by asking &quot;Nobody abroad wants to watch the Turkish league. Who wants to watch this Turkish league abroad?” he said. “Why should they see this? It’s too grey, it’s too dark, smells bad.&quot; During the press conference, Mourinho also claimed that referees in Turkey are biased, saying that &quot;It’s more difficult because we play against our opponents…but we play against the system, and to play against the system is the most difficult thing.&quot;

On February 25, 2025, following a 0-0 draw between Mourinho&#x27;s Fenerbahçe and rival Galatasary, Galatasary announced that they had initiated criminal proceedings against comments they claimed to be racist statements. During the post-game press conference, Mourinho had praised that a Slovenian, Slavko Vinčić, had been the head referee, stating that he told a Turkish referee &quot;If you are the referee...would be a disaster. When I say him, I say the general tendency.&quot; Later in the conference, he praised Vinčić for an incident which occurred involving centre back Yusuf Akçiçek; &quot;I have to thank the referee because with a Turkish referee after the big dive and the first minute and their bench jumping like monkeys on top of the kids.&quot; After the incident, Mourinho&#x27;s ex players such as Drogba, Essien and Gallas voiced their supports for Mourinho on their social media accounts.

==Media==
Mourinho signed up to cover the 2018 FIFA World Cup as an analyst on RT. In 2019, he began hosting a show on the RT network called &quot;On the Touchline with José Mourinho&quot; which covered the 2019 UEFA Champions League. In August 2019, Mourinho joined UK broadcaster Sky Sports as a pundit on their Premier League coverage.

In collaboration with DAZN, in 2019 Mourinho appeared in &quot;The Making Of&quot; series, a 3 part documentary which relives the significant games that helped define football&#x27;s greatest modern icons. Mourinho was involved in the 2020 Amazon Prime sports docuseries &quot;All or Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur&quot; (narrated by Tom Hardy) during his spell managing the club.

In October 2022, Mourinho&#x27;s famous phrase &quot;park the bus&quot; was added to the Oxford English Dictionary. Mourinho had used this phrase to describe Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s negative, defensive tactics following a 0–0 draw with his Chelsea side in 2004, stating &quot;they brought the bus and left the bus in front of the goal as we say in my country&quot;.

==Personal life==
Mourinho met his wife Matilde &quot;Tami&quot; Faria, born in Portuguese Angola, when they were teenagers in Setúbal, Portugal, and the couple married in 1989. Their first child, daughter Matilde, was born in 1996 and they had their first son, José Mário Jr four years later. Mourinho, whilst dedicated to football, describes his family as the centre of his life and has said that the &quot;most important thing is my family and being a good father.&quot; He was selected as the &quot;New Statesman&quot; Man of the Year 2005 and was described as a man devoted to both his family and his work.

Mourinho has also been a part of social initiatives and charity work, helping with a youth project, bringing Israeli and Palestinian children together through football and donating his lucky jacket to Tsunami Relief, earning £22,000 for the charity. Since his appointment in 2014, he acts as a Global Ambassador of the United Nations&#x27; World Food Programme.

Widely known for his strong personality, refined dress sense, and quirky comments at press conferences, Mourinho has experienced fame outside of football circles, featuring in European advertisement campaigns for Samsung, American Express, Braun, Jaguar and Adidas, amongst others. An unofficial biography of Mourinho, titled &quot;O Vencedor – De Setúbal a Stamford Bridge&quot; (The Winner – from Setúbal to Stamford Bridge), was a best seller in Portugal. Mourinho did not authorise the biography and unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the book from being published.

Mourinho was part of an unusual event in May 2007 when he was arrested for preventing animal welfare officials from putting his dog into quarantine. The dog had not been sufficiently inoculated but the situation was resolved after it was returned to Portugal and Mourinho received a police caution.

Mourinho is a Roman Catholic, saying, &quot;I believe totally, clearly. Every day I pray; every day I speak with Him. I don&#x27;t go to the church every day, not even every week. I go when I feel I need to. And when I&#x27;m in Portugal, I always go.&quot; In April 2022, he expanded upon his faith and its relationship with his career, proclaiming: &quot;People think football is my life, but no. There are more important things, including the relationship with God. For me, God is love.&quot; Apart from his native Portuguese, Mourinho speaks Spanish, Italian, French, Catalan and English to varying degrees of fluency. Mourinho was chosen to voice Pope Francis in a Vatican-approved Portuguese animated film marking the 2017 centenary of the apparition of Our Lady of Fátima.

On 23 March 2009, Mourinho was awarded a doctorate &quot;honoris causa&quot; degree by the Technical University of Lisbon for his accomplishments in football. In December 2011, he was named &quot;Rockstar of the Year&quot; by the Spanish &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

<doc id="739555" wikidata="Q660917" url="?curid=739555" title="Walter Crane">
<text>Walter Crane (15 August 184514 March 1915) was an English artist and book illustrator. He is considered to be the most influential, and among the most prolific, children&#x27;s book creators of his generation and, along with Randolph Caldecott and Kate Greenaway, one of the strongest contributors to the child&#x27;s nursery motif that the genre of English children&#x27;s illustrated literature would exhibit in its developmental stages in the later 19th century.

Crane&#x27;s work featured some of the more colourful and detailed beginnings of the child-in-the-garden motifs that would characterize many nursery rhymes and children&#x27;s stories for decades to come. He was part of the Arts and Crafts movement and produced an array of paintings, illustrations, children&#x27;s books, ceramic tiles, wallpapers and other decorative arts. Crane is also remembered for his creation of a number of iconic images associated with the international socialist movement.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and influences ===

Crane was the second son of Thomas Crane, a portrait painter and miniaturist, and Marie Crane (&quot;née&quot; Kearsley), the daughter of a prosperous malt-maker. His elder brother Thomas would also go into illustration, and sister Lucy was a noted writer. He was a fluent follower of the newer art movements and he came to study and appreciate the detailed senses of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and was also a diligent student of the renowned artist and critic John Ruskin. A set of coloured page designs to illustrate Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Lady of Shalott&quot; gained the approval of wood-engraver William James Linton to whom Walter Crane was apprenticed for three years in 1859–62. As a wood-engraver he had abundant opportunity for the minute study of the contemporary artists whose work passed through his hands, of Pre-Raphaelites Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais, as well as Sir John Tenniel, the illustrator of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, and Frederick Sandys. He was a student who admired the masters of the Italian Renaissance, however he was more influenced by the Elgin marbles in the British Museum. A further and important element in the development of his talent was the study of Japanese colour-prints, the methods of which he imitated in a series of toy books, which started a new fashion.

=== Political activity ===
From the early 1880s, initially under William Morris&#x27;s influence, Crane was closely associated with the socialist movement. He did as much as Morris himself to bring art into the daily life of all classes. With this object in view he devoted much attention to designs for textiles and wallpapers, and to house decoration; but he also used his art for the direct advancement of the Socialist cause. As a member of the Socialist League, he created the 1885 cover illustration for their manifesto. For a long time he provided the weekly cartoons for the socialist organs &quot;Justice&quot;, &quot;Commonweal&quot; and &quot;The Clarion&quot;. Many of these were collected as &quot;Cartoons for the Cause&quot;. 

Crane also devoted much time and energy to non-political societies, such as the Art Workers Guild, of which he was master in 1888 and 1889 and to the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, which he helped to found in 1888. He was a Vice President of the Healthy and Artistic Dress Union, a movement begun in 1890, whose aim was to promote loose-fitting clothing, in opposition to &quot;stiffness, tightness and weight&quot;. They produced numerous pamphlets setting out their cause, including one entitled &quot;How to Dress Without a Corset&quot; which Crane illustrated.

Although not himself an anarchist, Crane contributed to several libertarian publishers, including Liberty Press and Freedom Press. He is credited with the design and decoration of the front façade of &quot;The Bomb Shop&quot;, Henderson&#x27;s bookshop at 66 Charing Cross Road specializing in left-wing and radical literature.

Crane was controversial in his support of the four Chicago anarchists executed in 1887 in connection with the Haymarket affair. Visiting the United States for the first time in connection with an exhibition of his work in 1891, Crane scandalized polite society by appearing at a Boston anarchist meeting and expressing the opinion that the Haymarket defendants had been put to death wrongfully. Returning to his hotel, Crane found a letter stating that he faced &quot;hopeless ruin&quot; among American patrons of the arts owing to his support of those who were commonly considered to be terrorist conspirators in public opinion of the day. Financial support was withdrawn and planned dinners in Crane&#x27;s honour were cancelled. In response to the controversy, Crane wrote a letter to the press explaining that he had not meant to cause insult and did not himself favour the use of explosives, but had merely been expressing his principled opinion that those convicted were innocent of the crime for which they were charged. The incident was memorialized in the press as &quot;probably the most dramatic episode&quot; in the artist&#x27;s career. Crane publicly criticised the British government for the Second Boer War and joined the Stop the War Committee.

=== Personal life ===
Walter Crane married embroiderer Mary Frances Andrews in 1871 and they proceeded on a two-year honeymoon. In Italy, the newlyweds made contact with artists from other countries, while Crane&#x27;s illustrations were published in England. The couple went on to have three children with Crane featuring himself, his wife and one of their sons in his 1885 watercolour, &quot;The Apotheosis of Italian Art&quot;. Both he and his wife enjoyed giving enormous costume parties, so that the couple&#x27;s New Year parties were considered a major event in London&#x27;s artistic social calendar. Late in 1914, at the age of 68, Frances Crane went on a rest cure in Kingsnorth, Kent, but committed suicide in a tragic train incident. The coroner&#x27;s jury ruled it to be a case of temporary insanity.

=== Death and legacy ===

Walter Crane died on 14 March 1915 in Horsham Hospital, West Sussex, three months after his wife. His body was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium, where his ashes remain. He was survived by their three children, Beatrice, Lionel and Lancelot.

== Artistic work ==

=== Paintings and illustrations ===

In 1862, his picture &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; was exhibited at the Royal Academy, but the academy steadily refused his maturer work and after the opening of the Grosvenor Gallery in 1877, he ceased to send pictures to Burlington House. In 1863 the printer Edmund Evans employed Crane to illustrate yellowbacks, and in 1865 they began to collaborate on toy books of nursery rhymes and fairy tales. From 1865 to 1876 Crane and Evans produced two to three toy books each year.

These are a few of his illustration suites: In 1864 he began to illustrate a series of sixpenny toy books of nursery rhymes in three colours for Edmund Evans. He was allowed more freedom in a series beginning with &quot;The Frog Prince&quot; (1874) which showed markedly the influence of Japanese art, and of a long visit to Italy following on his marriage in 1871. His work was characterized by sharp outlines and flat tints. &quot;The Baby&#x27;s Opera&quot; was a book of English nursery songs available in 1877 with Evans, and a third series of children&#x27;s books with the collective title &quot;Romance of the Three R&#x27;s&quot; provided a regular course of instruction in art for the nursery. In his early &quot;Lady of Shalott&quot;, the artist had shown his preoccupation with unity of design in book illustration by printing in the words of the poem himself, in the view that this union of the calligrapher&#x27;s and the decorator&#x27;s art was one secret of the beauty of the old illuminated books.

He followed the same course in &quot;The First of May: A Fairy Masque&quot; by his friend John Wise, text and decoration being in this case reproduced by photogravure. &quot;The Goose Girl&quot; illustration taken from his beautiful &quot;Household Stories from Grimm&quot; (1882) was done again as a big watercolour and then reproduced in tapestry by William Morris. &quot;Flora&#x27;s Feast, A Masque of Flowers&quot; had lithographic reproductions of Crane&#x27;s line drawings washed in with watercolour; he also decorated in colour &quot;The Wonder Book&quot; of Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Margaret Deland&#x27;s &quot;Old Garden&quot;. During the eighties and nineties he illustrated 16 children&#x27;s novels by Mrs. Molesworth in black and white. In 1894 he collaborated with William Morris in the page decoration of &quot;The Story of the Glittering Plain&quot;, published at the Kelmscott Press, which was executed in the style of 16th-century Italian and German woodcuts. Crane illustrated editions of Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Faerie Queene&quot; (19 pts., 1894–1896) and &quot;The Shepheard&#x27;s Calendar&quot;, as well as &quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&quot; (1873), &quot;The Happy Prince and Other Stories&quot; by Oscar Wilde (1888), an edition of &quot;Arthurian Legends&quot;, &quot;A Flower Wedding&quot;. and in 1900 Judge Parry&#x27;s re-narration of Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote of the Mancha&quot;.

Crane also illustrated Nellie Dale&#x27;s books &quot;On Teaching English Reading&quot;, &quot;Steps to Reading&quot;, &quot;First Primer&quot;, &quot;Second Primer&quot;, &quot;Infant Reader&quot;, &quot;Book I&quot;, and &quot;Book II&quot;. These were most probably completed between 1898 and 1907.

===Poetry===
Crane wrote and illustrated three books of poetry, &quot;Queen Summer&quot; (1891), &quot;Renascence&quot; (1891), and &quot;The Sirens Three&quot; (1886).

===Stained glass===
Crane&#x27;s earliest stained glass window designs were some American commissions with glass made by William Morris. He then had a British commission – the windows for the new Agapemonite church of the Ark of the Covenant in London. These designs are a mixture of Art Nouveau floral works on the side windows and depictions of sin, shame and the translations of Enoch and Elijah. They were completed by Sylvester Sparrow and have been described by English Heritage as Crane&#x27;s &quot;most significant work in this medium&quot;, and in the justification for listing the church as Grade II* &quot;the stained glass is extraordinary and has more than special interest in the context of Arts and Crafts stained glass&quot;.

=== Mature work ===
His own easel pictures, chiefly allegorical in subject, among them &quot;The Bridge of Life&quot; (1884) and &quot;The Mower&quot; (1891), were exhibited regularly at the Grosvenor Gallery and later at the New Gallery. &quot;Neptune&#x27;s Horses&quot; was exhibited at the New Gallery in 1893, and with it may be classed his &quot;Rainbow and the Wave&quot;.

His varied work includes examples of plaster relief, tiles, stained glass, pottery, wallpaper, and textile designs, in all of which he applied the principle that in purely decorative design &quot;the artist works freest and best without direct reference to nature, and should have learned the forms he makes use of by heart&quot;. An exhibition of his work of different kinds was held at the Fine Art Society&#x27;s galleries in Bond Street in 1891, and taken to the United States in the same year by the artist himself. It was afterwards exhibited in Germany, Austria and Scandinavia.

Crane was elected a member of the Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1882, resigning in 1886; two years later he became an associate of the Water Colour Society (1888); he was an examiner for the Science and Art Department at the South Kensington Museum; director of design at the Manchester Municipal School (1894); art director of Reading College (1896); and in 1898 for a short time principal of the Royal College of Art, where he planned a new curriculum intended to bring students into closer contact with tools and materials. His lectures at Manchester were published with illustrated drawings as &quot;The Bases of Design&quot; (1898) and &quot;Line and Form&quot; (1900). &quot;The Decorative Illustration of Books, Old and New&quot; (2nd ed., London and New York, 1900) is a further contribution to theory. A well-known portrait of Crane by George Frederick Watts was exhibited at the New Gallery in 1893.

In 1887, Crane was commissioned by Emilie Barrington to paint a series of murals to decorate the newly constructed Red Cross Hall in Southwark, a project conceived by the housing campaigner Octavia Hill. Crane produced designs for nine panels, which were displayed at the 1890 Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society show. Ultimately, only three designs were converted into full-size murals, these being: &quot;Alice Ayres&quot; (1890), depicting the heroine of the Union Street fire which had occurred in 1885 just a few streets away; &quot;Jamieson&quot; (1892), depicting two Scottish railway workers, Alex Jamieson and his nephew Alexander, who lost their lives in 1874 while working on the Glasgow and Paisley line; and&quot; Rescue from a Well&quot; (1894), depicting George Eales, a 58-year-old labourer who in December 1887 at Dummer, near Basingstoke in Hampshire, descended into a well to rescue a five-year-old child. After 1894, no further murals were created, partly due to shortages in funding and other commitments, but also because it was discovered that the gas lighting in the hall was damaging the paintings. The Red Cross Hall is now in private hands and the status of the murals is unknown.

A large mosaic, &quot;The Sphere and Message of Art&quot;, designed by Crane, was intended for the façade of the Whitechapel Art Gallery at the time of its construction in 1898. Sadly, sufficient funds were not forthcoming, resulting instead in a frontage clad in buff terracotta tiles. (The drawing still exists.)

Crane was much admired in Hungary and in 1900 , the director of the Budapest Museum of Applied Arts, organised a retrospective of his work there. Crane visited the city in the autumn, was feted, gave lectures and visited Transylvania. He went to Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca), Bánffyhunyad (now Huedin), and Kalotaszeg (now Țara Călatei) in search of Hungarian traditional art. He recorded the visit in &quot;Ideals in Art&quot;. Zsuzsa Gonda in her review of Crane’s visit says that it is one of the most extensively documented events in the artistic life of the country in that period. The welcome extended to him was not entirely personal, however: he was the representative of England, the nation that sheltered Kossuth and took him to its heart.

One of Crane&#x27;s last major works was his lunettes at the Royal West of England Academy, which were painted in 1913.

<doc id="739562" wikidata="Q681464" url="?curid=739562" title="Winthrop M. Crane">
<text>Winthrop Murray Crane (commonly referred to as W. Murray Crane or simply Murray Crane; April 23, 1853October 2, 1920) was an American businessman and Republican Party politician who served as the 40th governor of Massachusetts from 1900 to 1903 and represented that state in the United States Senate from 1904 to 1913.

In 1879, he secured his family company, paper manufacturer Crane &amp; Co., an exclusive government contract to supply the paper for United States currency, a monopoly the company holds to this day. During the 1890s he became increasingly active in state Republican politics, and became a dominant figure in the local, state, and national party. He was successively elected the 37th lieutenant governor of Massachusetts (in 1896) and 40th governor (in 1899). In 1904, he was appointed to the United States Senate and served until 1913.

Crane advised Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft. His success as Governor in defusing a Teamsters strike prompted Roosevelt to bring him in as a negotiator to resolve the Coal Strike of 1902. He refused repeated offers for cabinet-level positions and was known to dislike campaigning and giving speeches. Near the end of his career, he served as a political mentor to future President Calvin Coolidge, who was elected vice president one month after Crane&#x27;s death.

==Early life==
Winthrop Murray Crane was born in Dalton, Massachusetts on April 23, 1853. His mother was Louise Fanny Laflin. His father, Zenas Marshall Crane, was owner of the Crane Paper Company, a dominant economic force in the small community and a major producer of paper products.

==Early career==

===Crane &amp; Co.===
In 1870, Crane entered the family business and, with his brother Zenas Jr., presided over a period of significant growth of the company.

In 1872, Crane secured a major contract for the supply of wrapping paper to the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, and followed this up in 1879, with an exclusive contract to paper for the Federal Reserve Notes, the currency of the United States. The Crane Company continues to be the sole supplier of currency paper to the federal government today.

The company continued to grow throughout the 1890s, and Crane amassed a significant fortune by investing in the Otis Elevator Company and in American Telephone and Telegraph Company.

===Entry to politics===
In 1892, Crane was elected as a delegate to the Republican National Convention as a candidate of the &quot;Young Republican Club,&quot; a faction of Massachusetts Republicans, organized in 1888, who would come to dominate the state party apparatus and political landscape.

After the convention, Crane was elected Chairman of the Massachusetts Republican Party. Although he was from western Massachusetts, he was viewed by the party&#x27;s mainly eastern leadership as a &quot;safe&quot; and moderate choice, who would be good at fundraising. Although Crane was politically conservative, he was adept at negotiating the differences between the wings of the party and refused to become deeply entrenched into either the progressive or conservative wing. He was also well known as a somewhat taciturn politician, who did not make stump speeches while campaigning, and is not recorded as having made speeches on the floors of the legislative bodies in which he served.

==Governor of Massachusetts==
In 1896, Crane was elected Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, serving under another Young Republican, Roger Wolcott. The office was part of a traditional &quot;cursus honorum&quot; in Massachusetts Republican politics, with the next step being the Governorship. When Wolcott retired after his traditional third one-year term, Crane ran for Governor. He won a comfortable victory against a disorganized Democratic opposition and was reelected the next two years by wide margins.

Crane&#x27;s tenure as governor was marked by fiscal conservatism, business-like management, and relatively little reform. His leadership was characterized as non-partisan and was viewed with favor even by Democrats.

In 1902, Crane successfully negotiated a Teamsters strike, and was then called in by President Theodore Roosevelt to mediate the 1902 Coal Strike, which threatened national winter coal supplies.

He vetoed legislative authorization of a merger between the Boston Elevated Railway and the West End Street Railway, in part because it did not contain a clause calling for a referendum by the affected populations. He did, however, sign legislation authorizing the lease of the Fitchburg Railroad to the Boston and Maine Railroad, and of the Boston and Albany Railroad to the New York Central Railroad. Crane was a major shareholder in the New York Central.

Crane was hosting President Roosevelt in Pittsfield on September 3, 1902, when a speeding trolley car rammed into the open-air horse carriage carrying Roosevelt. The accident killed the president&#x27;s Secret Service agent, William Craig.

==United States Senator==
Crane was appointed October 12, 1904 by Governor John L. Bates to continue the U.S. Senate term of the late George F. Hoar. He was then elected in a January 18, 1905 special election to finish the term. He was re-elected in 1907 and served until 1913.

As Senator, Crane was famous for his lack of public statements and behind-the-scenes maneuvering. Senator from New York Chauncey Depew wrote that Crane &quot;never made a speech. I do not remember that he made a motion. Yet he was the most influential member of that body.&quot; Calvin Coolidge observed that &quot;his influence was very great, but that it was of an intangible nature.&quot; He was also known to often choose inaction over action on many matters, with a common answer to requests for advice being &quot;Do nothing. As U.S. Senator, he used his influence to help secure the state&#x27;s approval of a merger of the Boston and Maine with the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.

He was an opponent of reciprocity (reduced tariffs) with Canada and the Dominion of Newfoundland, working to water down provisions of a proposed treaty.

In 1905, Crane may have been instrumental in denying Democrat William L. Douglas a second term as governor. Douglas, a successful and widely-known shoe manufacturer, won election in 1904 with labor support and high name recognition. According to Charles S. Hamlin, Republicans discovered that Douglas had apparently fraudulently acquired an honorable discharge after deserting during the Civil War. The &quot;quid pro quo&quot; for this information not being revealed, supposedly engineered by Crane and Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, was that Douglas would not run again.

In the 1908 presidential election, Crane expressed early support for William Howard Taft, but later came to oppose Taft, believing him a weak candidate. This placed him in opposition to fellow Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, a strong Taft supporter, in a struggle for control of the state delegation to the national convention. Crane preferred to leave the delegates without formal instruction as to how they should vote, while Lodge preferred that they be required to pledge for Taft. Crane won Lodge&#x27;s support for an uncommitted delegation in exchange for the election of John Davis Long, a Taft supporter, as an at-large delegate. Crane ultimately reconciled with both Taft and Lodge. He became one of Taft&#x27;s closest advisors after his election and worked to secure Lodge&#x27;s reelection in 1911.

In the 1912 general election, the Republican Party was divided by Roosevelt&#x27;s defection, and conservative elements of the party dominated the state legislature&#x27;s caucus. This resulted in the election in early 1913 of the ultraconservative John W. Weeks over Crane for the Senate seat.

==Personal life and death==
In 1880, Crane married Mary Benner. She died in 1884 giving birth to their only child, Winthrop Murray Crane Jr.

In 1906, Crane married socialite Josephine Porter Boardman. She was 20 years his junior and from a politically connected family. They had three children:

* Stephen
* Bruce Crane (b. 1909), who later served as president of Crane &amp; Co. and a member of the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council
* Louise Crane (b. 1913), poet, publisher, and philanthropist

Crane died at his home in Dalton on October 2, 1920.

<doc id="739566" wikidata="Q225643" url="?curid=739566" title="Cardan grille">
<text>The Cardan grille is a method of writing secret messages using a grid.

==History==
This technique was used in ancient China.

In 1550, Girolamo Cardano (1501–1576), known in French as , proposed a simple grid for writing hidden messages. He intended to cloak his messages inside an ordinary letter so that the whole would not appear to be a cipher at all.

Such a disguised message is considered to be an example of steganography, which is a sub-branch of general cryptography. But the name Cardan was applied to grilles that may not have been Cardan&#x27;s invention, and, so, &quot;Cardan&quot; is a generic name for cardboard grille ciphers.

Cardinal Richelieu (1585–1642) was reputed to be fond of the Cardan grille and to have used it in both private and diplomatic correspondence. Educated men in 17th century Europe were familiar with word games in literature, including acrostics, anagrams, and ciphers.

Although the original Cardan grilles were little used by the end of the 17th century, they still appeared occasionally in the form of &quot;masked letters&quot; and as literary curiosities. George Gordon Byron, for example, claimed to have written Cardan-grille verse – but as a demonstration of verbal skill rather than a serious cipher.

Alternative grilles possess apertures for single letters only and can be used quickly. Messages are filled out with a jumble of letters or numbers and are clearly cryptograms whereas Cardano intended to create steganograms.

These single-letter grilles may be named after Cardano, but they are also called simply &quot;cardboard ciphers&quot;.

A further variation is a turning grille or trellis, based on the chess board, which was used in the latter 16th century.

The turning grille reappeared in a more sophisticated form at the end of the 19th century; but, by this time, any connection with Cardano was in name alone.

==Construction==

A Cardan grille is made from a sheet of fairly rigid paper or parchment, or from thin metal. The paper is ruled to represent lines of handwriting and rectangular areas are cut out at arbitrary intervals between these lines.

An encipherer places the grille on a sheet of paper and writes his message in the rectangular apertures, some of which might allow a single letter, a syllable, or a whole word. Then, removing the grille, the fragments are filled out to create a note or letter that disguises the true message. Cardano suggested drafting the text three times in order to smooth any irregularities that might indicate the hidden words.

The recipient of the message must possess an identical grille. Copies of grilles are cut from an original template, but many different patterns could be made for one-to-one correspondence.

The grille can be placed in four positions – face up and face down, upright and reversed – which increases the number of possible cell positions fourfold.

In practice it can be difficult to construct an innocent message around a hidden text. Stilted language draws attention to itself and the purpose of the Cardan grille is to create a message &quot;“without suspicion”&quot; in the words of Francis Bacon. But the task was easier for Cardano, because 16th century spelling was not standardised and left much room for contractions and adornments of penmanship.

== Detection of messages ==
When executed badly, a Cardan message stands out because of stilted language and uneven writing. An analyst may attempt to reconstruct the grille when there are several examples of suspect messages from a correspondent.

When executed well, a Cardan message can be difficult to spot. Even when an analyst suspects the presence of a message, an innocent letter can contain apparently hidden text. So, in practice, the only solution is to obtain the grille itself.

== Disadvantages ==
The method is slow and requires literary skill. Above all, any physical cipher device is subject to loss, theft and seizure; so to lose one grille is to lose all secret correspondence constructed with that grille. Possession of a grille may be incriminating.

The Cardan grille, in its original form, is of more literary than cryptographic interest. For example, controversy surrounds the Voynich manuscript which could be a 16th-century fake cipher text, possibly constructed with a Cardan grille which was used to generate pseudo-random nonsense from a pre-existing text.

<doc id="739568" wikidata="Q5508804" url="?curid=739568" title="Functional constituency (Hong Kong)">
<text>In the political systems of Hong Kong, a functional constituency is a professional or special interest group involved in the electoral process. Eligible voters in a functional constituency may include natural persons as well as other designated legal entities such as organisations and corporations. (See: legal personality)

== History ==
The concept of functional constituencies (FC) in Hong Kong was first developed in the release of &quot;Green Paper: A Pattern of District Administration in Hong Kong&quot; on 18 July 1984 when indirect elections were introduced to the Legislative Council for the first time. The paper suggested that the Legislative Council create 24 seats with 12 seats from different professional interest groups. The 11 original functional constituencies created in 1985 were:

* First Commercial (HKGCC)
* Second Commercial (CGCC)
* First Industrial (FHKI)
* Second Industrial (CMAHK) 
* Financial (HKAB)
* Labour (2 seats)
* Social Services (HKCSS) 
* Medical (HKMA)
* Teaching 
* Legal 
* Engineering, Architectural, Surveying and Planning
In 1988, the Financial constituency was enlarged into Financial and Accountancy constituencies and the Medical constituency was enlarged into Medical and Health Care constituencies respectively.

In 1991, the functional constituencies were more developed. With 9 directly elected geographical constituencies created, 20 functional constituencies consisting of 11 types of industry in which 7 new functional constituencies including Heung Yee Kuk, Urban Council and Regional Council were also set up. The 7 new functional constituencies added in 1991 were:

* Engineering
* Real Estate and Construction
* Tourism
* Financial Services
* Urban Council
* Regional Council
* Rural
In 1992, Chris Patten suggested additional political reform adding nine additional functional constituencies with a much expanded voter base to the existing system. The changes were implemented in the 1995 legislative election. The 9 new functional constituencies added in 1995 were:

* Primary Production, Power and Construction
* Textiles and Garment
* Manufacturing
* Import and Export
* Wholesale and Retail
* Hotels and Catering
* Transport and Communication
* Financing, Insurance, Real Estate and Business Services
* Community, Social and Personal Services
After transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, there were 28 functional constituencies consisting of the following. Corporate voting was restored after it was abolished in 1995. It reduced the number of eligible voters by almost 90 percent, from over 1.1 million in 1995 to fewer than 140,000 in 1998:

* Heung Yee Kuk
* Agriculture and Fisheries
* Insurance
* Transport
* Education
* Legal
* Accountancy
* Medical
* Health Services
* Engineering
* Architectural, Surveying, Planning and Landscape
* Labour (3 seats)
* Social Welfare
* Real Estate and Construction
* Tourism
* Commercial (First)
* Commercial (Second)
* Industrial (First)
* Industrial (Second)
* Finance
* Financial Services
* Sports, Performing Arts, Culture and Publication
* Import and Export
* Textiles and Garment
* Wholesale and Retail
* Information Technology
* Urban Council*
* Regional Council*

The Labour constituency returns 3 seats and the others return one each.

By 2000, the seat held by Urban Council and Regional Council were dissolved by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, the two seats were replaced by Catering and District Council. The District Council would be renamed to District Council (First) by 2012, as a result of the addition of a special Functional Constituency having candidates from District Council but with a different range of electors, named District Council (Second).

In 2021, the National People&#x27;s Congress initiated a decision to change the electoral rule in Hong Kong. As a result of this decision, the five District Council (Second) seats were abolished alongside the District Council (First) and Information Technology constituencies, while Health Services was merged with Medical to form the Medical and Health Service FC. Three new constituencies were created, namely the Commercial (Third), the Technology and Innovation, and the HKSAR deputies to the National People&#x27;s Congress, HKSAR members of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, and representatives of relevant national organisations.

The following table charts the evolution of functional constituencies of the LegCo:

== Present ==
Under the 2021 Hong Kong electoral changes, 28 functional constituencies (FC) return 30 members. The Labour Functional Constituency returns three members by plurality block voting. The other FCs return one member each with first-past-the-post voting.

The electoral base is non-uniform, and there may be institutional votes or individual votes. Fourteen seats were uncontested in 2008; of the 16 contested seats, the number of electors, corporate and individuals combined, ranged from between 112 and 52,894 voters. Four of the FC legislators – mostly those returned in fiercely contested elections – are aligned with the parties which support universal suffrage; two are independent and the rest (24) are pro-government.

The Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPCSC) refers to the participation of the business block vote in the affairs of Hong Kong as &quot;balanced participation&quot;. On 26 April 2004, the NPCSC published its decision that:
In 2021, the Government published details of the electoral base of the functional constituencies as follows:
== Criticisms ==

Pro-democracy supporters criticise the functional constituency system for giving a minority too much power and influence. The right of corporations and legal entities to vote is also controversial, as it gives some individuals multiple votes. For example, in 1998, Sino Group chairman Robert Ng and companies he controlled held roughly 3-4% of the votes in the real estate constituency, according to an analysis by the &quot;Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor&quot;; they described this as being equivalent in voting power to 15,940 people in a geographical constituency.

In some functional constituencies, the entire body of eligible voters comprises legal entities that are not natural persons. This is known as corporate voting.

In 2009, there were applications for judicial review to challenge the legality of corporate voting on the grounds that it contravened the right to vote enshrined in Article 26 of the Basic Law or was discriminatory in nature. Mr. Justice Andrew Cheung (as the Chief Justice then was) dismissed the applications, emphasising that his judgment was solely concerned with the constitutionality of corporate voting rather than the political wisdom of corporate voting or functional constituencies.

There have been calls to abolish the functional constituencies from pan democrats. The May 2010 by-election was triggered by the resignation of 5 pan-democrats from the Legislative Council who put themselves up for re-election to the Legislative Council. The &#x27;Five Constituencies Referendum&#x27; concept to use a by-election as a de facto referendum on universal suffrage and the abolition of functional constituencies was hatched by the League of Social Democrats.

== Reform proposals ==
Following the consultations on the 2009 political reform package, where an additional five legislative seats for District Councils were proposed (in addition to Geographical seats) the government unveiled the revised package in mid-April 2010. It was proposed that the five additional Legco seats for the district council constituencies will be elected by proportional representation instead of block voting. With the proposals looking likely to be vetoed, the Democratic Party said they would support the measures if the five new District Council functional seats, and the one existing seat, would return candidates nominated by district councillors and elected by all registered voters.

<doc id="739569" wikidata="Q8069581" url="?curid=739569" title="Zero-crossing control">
<text>Zero-crossing control (or burst-fire control) is an approach for electrical control circuits that starts operation with the AC load voltage at close to 0 volts in the AC cycle. This is in relation to solid-state relays, such as TRIACs and silicon controlled rectifiers. The purpose of the circuit is to start the TRIAC conducting very near the time point when the load voltage is crossing zero (at the beginning or the middle of each AC cycle represented by a sine wave), so that the output voltage begins as a complete sine-wave half-cycle. In other words, if the controlling input signal is applied at any point during the AC output wave other than very close to the zero-voltage point of that wave, the output of the switching device will &quot;wait&quot; to switch on until the output AC wave reaches its next zero point. This is useful when sudden turn-on in the middle of a sine-wave half-cycle could cause undesirable effects like high-frequency spikes, for which the circuit or the environment is not expected to handle gracefully.

The point where the AC line voltage is zero is the &quot;zero cross point&quot;. When a TRIAC is connected in its simplest form, it can clip the beginning of the voltage curve, due to the minimum gate voltage of the triac. A works to correct this problem, so that the TRIAC functions as well as possible. This is typically done with thyristors in two of the three phases.

Many opto-TRIACs come with zero-cross circuits built in. They are often used to control larger, power TRIACs. In this setup TRIAC turn-on delays compound, so quick turn-on times are important.

The corresponding phase-angle circuits are more sophisticated and more expensive than zero-cross circuits.

<doc id="739570" wikidata="Q358042" url="?curid=739570" title="Feeble-minded">
<text>The term feeble-minded was used from the late 19th century in Europe, the United States and Australasia for disorders later referred to as illnesses or deficiencies of the mind.

At the time, &quot;mental deficiency&quot; encompassed all degrees of educational and social deficiency. Within the concept of mental deficiency, researchers established a hierarchy, ranging from idiocy, at the most severe end of the scale; to imbecility, at the median point; and to feeble-mindedness at the highest end of functioning. The last was conceived of as a form of high-grade mental deficiency.

The development of the ranking system of mental deficiency has been attributed to Sir Charles Trevelyan in 1876, and was associated with the rise of eugenics. The term and hierarchy had been used in that sense at least 10 years previously.

==History==
The earliest recorded use of the term in the English language dates from 1534, when it appears in one of the first English translations of the New Testament, the Tyndale Bible. A biblical commandment to &quot;Comforte the feble mynded&quot; is included in 1 Thessalonians.

A London &quot;Times&quot; editorial of November 1834 describes the long-serving former Prime Minister Lord Liverpool as a &quot;feeble-minded pedant of office&quot;.

==Definition==
The British government&#x27;s Royal Commission on the Care and Control of the Feeble-Minded (1904–1908), in its &quot;Report&quot; in 1908 defined the feeble-minded as:

Despite being pejorative, in its day the term was considered, along with &quot;idiot&quot;, &quot;imbecile&quot;, and &quot;moron&quot;, to be a relatively precise psychiatric classification.

The American psychologist Henry H. Goddard, who coined the term &quot;moron&quot;, was the director of the Vineland Training School (originally the Vineland Training School for Backward and Feeble-minded Children) at Vineland, New Jersey. Goddard was known for strongly postulating that &quot;feeble-mindedness&quot; was a hereditary trait, most likely caused by a single recessive gene. Goddard rang the eugenic &quot;alarm bells&quot; in his 1912 work, &quot;The Kallikak Family: A Study in the Heredity of Feeble-Mindedness&quot;, about those in the population who carried the recessive trait despite outward appearances of normality.

In the first half of the 20th century, a diagnosis of &quot;feeble-mindedness, in any of its grades&quot; was a common criterion for many states in the United States, which embraced eugenics as a progressive measure, to mandate the compulsory sterilization of such patients. In the 1927 US Supreme Court case &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot;, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes closed the 8–1 majority opinion upholding the sterilization of Carrie Buck, with the phrase, &quot;Three generations of imbeciles are enough.&quot; Buck, her mother and daughter were all classified as feeble-minded.

==Representation in other media==
Jack London published a short story, &quot;Told in the Drooling Ward&quot; (1914), which describes inmates at a California institution for the &quot;feeble-minded&quot;. He narrates the story from the point of view of a self-styled &quot;high-grade feeb&quot;. The California Home for the Care and Training of Feeble-minded Children, later the Sonoma Developmental Center, was located near the Jack London Ranch in Glen Ellen, California.

<text>Braxton Craven (August 22, 1822 – November 7, 1882) was an American educator. He served as the second president of the institution that became Duke University from 1842 to 1863 and then again from 1866 to 1882. The institution was known as Union Institute from 1841 to 1851, Normal College until 1859, and Trinity College until 1924. He taught ancient languages, ethics, philosophy, law, rhetoric, and logic at Duke.

==Life and career==
Craven was born in Randolph County, N.C., in 1822, and was licensed to preach by the Methodist Church in 1840. He earned an A.B. (Hon.) in 1849 from Randolph-Macon College, and received various other degrees during his lifetime. His career included the following educational and administrative positions: Student-teacher, Union Institute (1841-1842); Principal of Union Institute (1842-1851); President of Normal College (1851-1859); President of Trinity College (1859-1863, 1866-1882).

Braxton Craven&#x27;s connection with the school began at age 19 in 1841 when he was asked to enroll both as a student and assistant teacher at Union Institute. He succeeded Brantley York as principal in 1842 and lead the institution until his death in 1882. Well versed in educational theory, in 1851 he had the school chartered by the state as Normal College to train teachers for the state’s common schools. An ordained minister, he later turned to the Methodist Church for support resulting in the change of name to Trinity College in 1859. Under his leadership the school became well known, drawing its student body mostly from central Carolina, but also from all Southern states including some students from as far away as Arkansas and Missouri. 

The break in Craven&#x27;s presidency from 1863 to 1865 was caused by divisions in the Methodist Conference over his management of the school that led to his resignation. Professor William Trigg Gannaway was appointed president pro tempore. After the Civil War, Craven was persuaded to resume his office. A highly respected educator, Craven concurrently served as President, and Professor of Ancient Languages, Mental and Moral Science, Metaphysics, Rhetoric and Logic, National and Constitutional Law, and Biblical Literature.

He married Irene Leach on September 26, 1844. Irene Leach was the first female graduate of Brown’s Schoolhouse (predecessor to Union Institute), and taught arithmetic at Union Institute before their marriage. In 1881, when Charlie Soong was studying at Trinity College, he spent much of his time in the Craven home, where he was tutored by Mrs. Craven.

Craven was a slave owner.

Braxton Craven died in 1882.

Braxton Craven Middle School, an all-sixth-grade school located on the site of what was once Trinity College and, later, Duke University, is named for him.

==Fictional writing==
Braxton Craven also wrote fiction under the pen name of Charlie Vernon. One novel titled &quot;Mary Barker&quot;, published by Branson and Farrar in 1865, is described as “A thrilling narrative of early life in North Carolina.” It is listed in the catalog of the Library of Congress, call no. PS1449.C88 M3 1865, and a digital reproduction made from a microform copy is held by Indiana University

Another story, “Naomi Wise, or the Victim”, with an appended ballad purporting to be the original song composed about Naomi Wise’s murder, was first published in the January and February editions of the 1851 &quot;Evergreen&quot; newspaper. It was reprinted on April 29, 1874 in the &quot;Greensboro Patriot&quot; and several times thereafter in pamphlet form. In 1944 and again in 1962, the Rotary Club of Randleman, North Carolina published this same story along with the History of Randleman. It is a fabrication based on the death of Naomi Wise, but accepted as a true account for many years by most people who read it, including Braxton Craven’s biographer, Jerome Dowd.
