<text>Kenneth Arnold Chesney (born March 26, 1968) is an American country singer. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, he released his debut, &quot;In My Wildest Dreams&quot;, in 1994, and has since released 19 follow-ups. His albums spawned 27 singles that have peaked within the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Chesney has received twelve Country Music Association Awards, including the Country Music Association Award for Entertainer of the Year honor four times, and eleven Academy of Country Music Awards, including four consecutive Academy of Country Music Award for Entertainer of the Year from 2005 to 2008, as well as six Grammy Award nominations. He has remained one of the most popular touring acts in United States country music.

==Early life==
Chesney was born on March 26, 1968, in Knoxville, Tennessee, United States, at St. Mary&#x27;s Medical Center and was raised in Luttrell. He is of English and Irish descent. He is the son of David Chesney, a former elementary school teacher, and Karen Chandler, a hair stylist in the Knoxville area. Chesney has one sibling, a younger sister named Jennifer Chandler. In 1986, Chesney graduated from Gibbs High School, where he played baseball and football. He received his first guitar for Christmas and began teaching himself how to play it.

Chesney studied advertising at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City, where he was a member of the ETSU Bluegrass Program and the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity and graduated in 1990. In 1989, he recorded a self-released demo album, &quot;Good Old Boy At Heart&quot; at the Classic Recording Studio in Bristol, Virginia. He sold 1,000 copies while performing at the local clubs in Johnson City and used the money from album sales to help himself buy a new guitar.

After graduation from East Tennessee State in 1990, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he performed at several local clubs. In March 1991, he passed an audition to sing at The Bluebird Cafe. He became the resident performer at The Turf, a honky tonk bar in the city&#x27;s historic district.

==Career and awards==

In 1992, the head of writer relations at BMI, Clay Bradley, recommended Chesney to his friend, Troy Tomlinson, at Opryland Music Group. Chesney performed five songs during his audition for Tomlinson. Chesney left the audition with a songwriter&#x27;s contract. A year later, an appearance at a songwriter&#x27;s showcase led to a contract with Capricorn Records, which had recently started a country division.

Chesney&#x27;s debut album, &quot;In My Wildest Dreams&quot;, was released on the independent Capricorn Records label in April 1994. The album&#x27;s first two singles, &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; and &quot;The Tin Man&quot;, both reached the lower regions of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks chart. The album sold approximately 10,000 copies before Capricorn Records closed its country music division in Nashville later that year and moved to Atlanta.

In June 1995, Chesney signed with BNA Records, and released his second studio album &quot;All I Need to Know&quot;. The album produced three singles. &quot;Fall in Love&quot; and the title track both reached the Top 10, while &quot;Grandpa Told Me So&quot; peaked at number 23. That same year, Chesney co-wrote Confederate Railroad&#x27;s single &quot;When He Was My Age&quot; from their album &quot;When and Where&quot;. Chesney utilized musicians playing the fiddle and pedal steel guitar throughout this album, as he felt this would highlight the open-country, &quot;down-home&quot; feelings in his music; fiddle and pedal steel further helped to compliment his eastern-Tennessean accent and &quot;twang&quot; heard in his singing and inflections. One of the intentions behind the record was to capture the &quot;traditional&quot; spirit that had made early country music so popular.

Chesney&#x27;s third studio album and his second major-label one, titled &quot;Me and You&quot;, was released in June 1996. Its first single, &quot;Back In My Arms Again&quot;, peaked just outside the Top 40 on the country charts, while both the title track (which Chesney had recorded on his previous album) and &quot;When I Close My Eyes&quot; (previously recorded by Keith Palmer on his 1991 debut album and then by Larry Stewart on his 1993 debut album &quot;Down the Road&quot;) peaked at number 2. &quot;Me and You&quot; was Chesney&#x27;s first album to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). A cover of Mac McAnally&#x27;s 1990 single &quot;Back Where I Come From&quot; was also included on this album. Even though Chesney&#x27;s version was never released as a single, it has been regularly performed during his concerts.

Chesney was honored with the 1997 Academy of Country Music&#x27;s New Male Vocalist of the Year award.

&quot;I Will Stand&quot;, Chesney&#x27;s fourth album and his third from BNA Records, followed in July 1997. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;She&#x27;s Got It All&quot;, became Chesney&#x27;s first number one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts and spent three weeks at that position. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;A Chance&quot;, peaked just shy of the Top 10. The third single, &quot;That&#x27;s Why I&#x27;m Here&quot;, peaked at number 2 in 1998.

&quot;Everywhere We Go&quot;, Chesney&#x27;s fourth album from BNA, was released in March 1999. That album produced two consecutive number one hits with &quot;How Forever Feels&quot; and &quot;You Had Me from Hello&quot; (the latter inspired by a line in the movie &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;). The album also produced two more singles with &quot;She Thinks My Tractor&#x27;s Sexy&quot; and &quot;What I Need to Do&quot;, which peaked at numbers 11 and 8 on the country charts, respectively. &quot;Everywhere We Go&quot; was Chesney&#x27;s first album to be certified platinum. The album marked a departure from his original neotraditional country sound, to his more familiar country pop/trop rock/Gulf and Western sound he has since become known for.

In September 2000, Chesney released his &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation album. It included four new tracks, as well as updated versions of &quot;Fall in Love&quot;, &quot;The Tin Man&quot;, and &quot;Back Where I Come From&quot;. The new version of &quot;The Tin Man&quot; was one of the disc&#x27;s three singles, along with two of the new tracks, &quot;I Lost It&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Happen Twice&quot;. In 2001, he performed with Kid Rock at a Waylon Jennings tribute concert covering Waylon&#x27;s song &quot;Luckenbach Texas&quot;.

The album &quot;No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems&quot; was released in April 2002. Its lead-off single, &quot;Young&quot;, peaked at number 2, while the follower &quot;The Good Stuff&quot; spent seven weeks at number 1 and became &quot;Billboard&quot;″s number one country song of the year for 2002. In June 2002, the video for &quot;Young&quot; was honored by CMT with the Video of the Year and Male Video of the Year awards. A Lot of Things Different originally written by Bill Anderson, was the third single from the album and peaked at number 6. Big Star, released January 2003, was the fourth single released from the album and peaked at number 2 seven weeks later. In May 2003, ACM honored Chesney as Top Male Vocalist of the Year, while &quot;The Good Stuff&quot; received the award for Single Record of the Year. In April 2004, title track won the Hottest Video of the Year at the CMT awards, given to the fan-voted &quot;sexiest&quot; clip.

In October 2003, Chesney recorded &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is a Real Good Tan&quot;. The album&#x27;s title track peaked at No. 30 on the country charts from holiday airplay. Other notable work Chesney did in 2003 is that he co wrote Kid Rock&#x27;s single &quot;Cold and Empty&quot; from his self-titled 6th studio album &quot;Kid Rock&quot;.

In February 2004, Chesney released &quot;When the Sun Goes Down&quot;. Its lead-off single, &quot;There Goes My Life&quot;, spent seven weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts. On April 21, 2004, the accompanying music video for that song was honored by CMT with the Male Video of the Year award. The album&#x27;s title track, a duet with Uncle Kracker, also went to number one. The music video for the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;I Go Back&quot;, was honored on April 11, 2005, with Country Music Television&#x27;s Male Video of the Year Award. This song, along with the album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;The Woman with You&quot;, both peaked at number two. The fifth single, &quot;Anything But Mine&quot;, reached number one, and the final single, &quot;Keg in the Closet&quot;, peaked to number six.

&quot;When the Sun Goes Down&quot; was honored with the 2004 CMA award for Album of the Year while Chesney was honored as the Entertainer of the Year. He was also presented with AMA&#x27;s 2004 Artist of the Year award. 

In 2004, Chesney collaborated with one of his personal heroes, Jimmy Buffett, on a remake of Hank Williams&#x27; single &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27; (with Clint Black, Alan Jackson, Toby Keith, and George Strait), and a second song &quot;License To Chill&quot;. Both songs are on Buffett&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;License To Chill&quot;.

In January 2005, Chesney released the album &quot;Be as You Are (Songs from an Old Blue Chair)&quot;, supporting it with his Somewhere in the Sun Tour. &quot;Be as You Are&quot; is composed mostly of ballads. The album qualified for RIAA Platinum and entered the top of both mainstream country and pop music.

In May 2005, Chesney was honored with the prestigious Triple-Crown Award presented by the Academy of Country Music. This award was presented after Chesney&#x27;s 2004 Academy of Country Music&#x27;s Entertainer of the Year award was combined with 1997&#x27;s New Male Vocalist of the Year award and 2003&#x27;s Top Male Vocalist of the Year award.

Chesney&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Road and the Radio&quot;, released in November 2005, debuted at number one the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and produced five singles. &quot;Living in Fast Forward&quot;, &quot;Summertime&quot;, and &quot;Beer in Mexico&quot; all reached number one, while &quot;Who You&#x27;d Be Today&quot; and &quot;You Save Me&quot; both broke the Top 5. Chesney promotes his beliefs of perfection, as getting songs right in the studio, ultimately leads to performing it right on the road and on the radio.
In May 2006, Chesney was honored with his second Entertainer of the Year at the Academy of Country Music Awards.

&quot;Live: Live Those Songs Again&quot;, Chesney&#x27;s first live album was released in September 2006, via BNA Records. This album includes live renditions of 15 songs, 11 of which were singles. &quot;Live Those Songs&quot;, &quot;Never Gonna Feel Like That Again&quot;, &quot;On the Coast of Somewhere Beautiful&quot;, and &quot;Back Where I Come From&quot; were never released by Chesney as singles, although &quot;Back Where I Come From&quot; was released as a single from Mac McAnally&#x27;s 1990 album &quot;Simple Life&quot;.

In 2006, Chesney, along with Tim McGraw, contributed to a version of Tracy Lawrence&#x27;s single &quot;Find Out Who Your Friends Are&quot;, which can be found on his album &quot;For the Love&quot;. The official single version, only featuring Lawrence&#x27;s vocals, was released in August 2006 but did not reach the Top 40 on the country charts until January 2007, when &#x27;the album was released. After the album&#x27;s release, the version with him, Chesney, and McGraw began receiving significant airplay, boosting the single to No. 1 on the country charts. The song became Lawrence&#x27;s first No. 1 single in 11 years, as well as the second-slowest climbing No. 1 single in the history of the &quot;Billboard&quot; music charts.

In 2007, with Neil Thrasher and Wendell Mobley, Chesney also co-wrote Rascal Flatts&#x27; 2007 single &quot;Take Me There&quot;, which served as the lead-off single to their album &quot;Still Feels Good&quot;.

In 2007, Chesney also recorded a duet with Reba McEntire on her album &quot;&quot;. &quot;Every Other Weekend&quot; peaked at No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart and No. 104 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. The album has sold 2.1 million copies world-wide and is certified Platinum by the RIAA for sales of over 1 million. &quot;Every Other Weekend&quot; was the final single from the album.

In November 2007, Chesney was named the CMA Entertainer of the Year for the third time in four years. Also in November 2007, the compilation &quot;Super Hits&quot; album was released as part of Sony BMG&#x27;s &quot;Super Hits&quot; series.

In September 2007, Chesney released the album &quot;Just Who I Am: Poets &amp; Pirates&quot;. This album represented a move to a more Gulf and Western sound with a number of &quot;breezy, steel-drum island songs&quot;. It placed third in album sales that week, behind &quot;Graduation&quot; by Kanye West and &quot;Curtis&quot; by 50 Cent. The lead-off single from the album was &quot;Never Wanted Nothing More&quot;, written by Ronnie Bowman and Chris Stapleton. It reached number one &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts. On the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart dated for the week ending on September 15, 2007, the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Don&#x27;t Blink&quot; debuted at No. 16, setting a new record for the highest debut on that chart since the inception of SoundScan electronic tabulation in 1990, although the record was broken the following week by &quot;More Than a Memory&quot; by Garth Brooks. The third single, &quot;Shiftwork&quot; (a duet with George Strait) peaked at No. 2 on the country charts. In June 2008, the fourth and final single, &quot;Better as a Memory&quot;, became Chesney&#x27;s fourteenth number one hit.
Chesney started his &quot;Poets and Pirates Tour&quot; on April 26, 2008, at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, South Carolina. During the introduction of his set, his boot got caught between a hydraulic lift and the lip of the stage surface, which crushed his foot causing a severe hematoma in the ankle; most of the damage was centering within his toes. It took about 30 seconds for Chesney to pry his foot loose as he squatted down on the stage while the band continued to play an extended introduction of the song. When Chesney finally freed himself, he stood up and held his hand on his knee as he began singing. Chesney did not acknowledge the injury during the early part of his performance. However, he was visibly limping and seemed to rest near a drum riser while leaning over and holding his knee during the instrumental breaks of his songs. As he came offstage, a doctor from the University of South Carolina cut off Chesney&#x27;s cowboy boot and immediately began treating the foot injury. X-rays that were taken afterwards revealed several crushed bones in his right foot. Chesney did not cancel any shows due to the injury.

On May 19, 2008, just a day after being honored as the ACM Entertainer of the Year at the 43rd Annual Academy of Country Music Awards, Chesney criticized the change in the awards process to awarding the honor based on fan votes and not determined by music industry professionals.
In August 2008, Chesney released a song titled &quot;Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven&quot;, which reached number one &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart. The album &quot;Lucky Old Sun&quot; was released on October 14, 2008. It was followed by a cover of Mac McAnally&#x27;s 1990 single &quot;Down the Road&quot;.

Chesney&#x27;s 2009 tour was titled the &quot;Sun City Carnival Tour&quot; and featured both small and large venues in order to keep his ticket prices down.

In May 2009, Chesney released his second compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot;. This album included the No. 1 hit, &quot;Out Last Night&quot;, as the lead single. On February 9, 2010, this album was re-released with two new tracks &quot;This Is Our Moment&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Back Yet&quot;, with the latter becoming the album&#x27;s third single in February 2010. Also included on this album is one that Willie Nelson recorded before Chesney did, &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;. Chesney later recorded a version of the song as a duet with Dave Matthews. This version was released in August 2009 as the album&#x27;s second single.

In July 2010, Chesney released &quot;The Boys of Fall&quot; as the lead-off single from his album &quot;Hemingway&#x27;s Whiskey&quot;, which was released in September 2010. The song reached No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart for the week of October 9, 2010. That year, Chesney produced a documentary for ESPN titled &quot;The Boys of Fall&quot; based on his song of the same name.

In November 2010, Chesney performed at the 44th Annual Country Music Awards.

The second single from &quot;Hemingway&#x27;s Whiskey&quot;, &quot;Somewhere with You&quot;, was released in November 2010. The song debuted at No. 35 on the country chart for the week of November 6, 2010. Both it and its followup, &quot;Live a Little&quot;, reached number 1 on the country charts. The next single was &quot;You and Tequila&quot;, co-written and originally recorded by Deana Carter. Chesney&#x27;s rendition, which featured Grace Potter on backing vocals, reached number 3. &quot;Reality&quot; reached number 1.

Chesney produced and narrated a biographical film, &quot;The Color Orange&quot;, on his favorite football player growing up, Tennessee Volunteers football quarterback and Canadian Football League hall-of-fame Condredge Holloway. The film was produced for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Year of the Quarterback&quot; series, and premiered on February 20, 2011.

Chesney released his fourteenth studio album, &quot;Welcome to the Fishbowl&quot;, on June 19, 2012. Its lead-off single, a Tim McGraw duet titled &quot;Feel Like a Rock Star&quot;, debuted at number 13 on the country charts, making it the second-highest debuting country song since the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts were first tabulated via Nielsen SoundScan, and the highest-debuting duet on that chart. The song peaked at number 11.

BNA Records closed in June 2012. As a result, Chesney was transferred to Columbia Nashville, now Sony Music Nashville. His first release under Columbia was the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Come Over&quot;, which went to number 1. The album&#x27;s third and final single was &quot;El Cerrito Place&quot;, which was written by Keith Gattis and originally recorded by Charlie Robison. Chesney&#x27;s rendition, which featured Grace Potter on backing vocals, reached number 10 on the country charts.

Chesney released his fifteenth studio album, &quot;Life on a Rock&quot;, on April 30, 2013. The first single from the album, &quot;Pirate Flag&quot;, was released to iTunes on February 5, 2013, and peaked at number 3 on the Country Airplay chart in May 2013. Pirate Flag peaked at number 7 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Country Songs chart, May 25, 2013. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;When I See This Bar&quot;, was released to country radio on June 10, 2013. When I see This Bar peaked at number 25 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Country Songs chart, September 14, 2013. This specific album was a drastic change from his regular country feel, to an all beach and island touch.

In June 2014, Chesney released the song &quot;American Kids&quot;, written by Rodney Clawson, Luke Laird, and Shane McAnally. This song served as the lead-off single from his sixteenth studio album &quot;The Big Revival&quot;, which was released on September 23, 2014. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Til It&#x27;s Gone&quot;, was released in mid-October. It reached number one on the Country Airplay chart the week of January 31, 2015. The third single &quot;Wild Child&quot;, which is a duet with Grace Potter, was released two days later. It reached number one on the Country Airplay chart the week of June 27, 2015. The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Save It for a Rainy Day&quot;, was released to country radio on June 29, 2015. It reached number one on the Country Airplay chart.

On October 24, Chesney announced his 2015 tour &quot;The Big Revival Tour&quot;, which began on March 26, 2015 and included ten shows with Jason Aldean.

The album &quot;Cosmic Hallelujah&quot;, was released on October 28, 2016. It included the single &quot;Noise&quot;, released in March 2016, and &quot;Setting the World on Fire&quot;, featuring singer P!NK, released in July 2016.

On August 25, 2012, at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, Kenny Chesney announced &quot;No Shoes Nation&quot; as the name of his fan club. The term No Shoes Nation originated from Chesney&#x27;s hit song &quot;No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problem&quot;. The symbol of No Shoes Nation is a black flag with a white skull and crossbones. The name was accompanied by a live album called &quot;Live in No Shoes Nation&quot;, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 after its release in late 2017. No Shoes Nation inspired the name of Chesney&#x27;s Sirius XM channel, No Shoes Radio.

In January 2018, Chesney ended his contract with Sony Music Nashville and signed to Warner Records Nashville. Chesney released his first album with Warner, entitled &quot;Songs for the Saints&quot;, in July 2018.

In May 2020, Chesney released &quot;Here and Now&quot;, which features the title track and &quot;Tip of My Tongue&quot;, a leadoff single that was released in mid-2019. The album debuted at number one and became Chesney&#x27;s 16th top 10 album on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with 233,000 units.

==Personal life==
In 2000, Chesney and Tim McGraw were involved in a scuffle with police in Orchard Park, New York, after Chesney attempted to ride a police horse. McGraw came to Chesney&#x27;s aid after police officers nearby believed the horse was being stolen. The two were arrested and charged, Chesney for disorderly conduct and McGraw for assault, but were acquitted in 2001.

On May 9, 2005, Chesney married actress Renée Zellweger in a ceremony on the island of St. John. They had met in January at a relief event for the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. On September 15, 2005, after only four months of marriage, they announced their plans for an annulment. Zellweger cited fraud as the reason in the related papers, and after media scrutiny of her use of the word &quot;fraud,&quot; she qualified the use of the term, stating that it was &quot;simply legal language and not a reflection of Kenny&#x27;s character&quot;. Chesney later suggested the failure of his marriage was due to &quot;the fact that I panicked&quot;. In an interview by &quot;60 Minutes&quot; with Anderson Cooper, Chesney commented on the failed marriage, &quot;The only fraud that was committed was me thinking that I knew what it was like… that I really understood what it was like to be married, and I really didn&#x27;t.&quot; The annulment was finalized in late December 2005.

Since 2012, Chesney has been dating Mary Nolan.

Chesney follows a strict diet that includes avoiding eating carbohydrates after 5 pm.

In 2018, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Chesney&#x27;s annual income at $37 million.

In 2017, Chesney&#x27;s house on Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands was destroyed by Hurricane Irma. He fell in love with the island after shooting the music video for &quot;How Forever Feels&quot;. In January 2022, Chesney sold his 12,600 square foot home on 56 acres in Franklin, Tennessee for $11.5 million, which represented a loss in real terms; he paid $9.2 million for it in 2009.

On religion, Chesney has stated: &quot;There&#x27;s things about religion that I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with or understand, but I&#x27;m a big believer in spirituality – I&#x27;ve seen songs change people, and that&#x27;s spiritual.&quot;

===Philanthropy===
In September 2017, in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, Chesney donated use of his private jet to reunite two teenage boys, who were stranded, with their mother. Chesney set up a charitable fund, Love for Love City, to help victims of the storm. Chesney donated all proceeds from his album &quot;Songs for the Saints&quot; to the fund.

==Tours==
Chesney won the &quot;Billboard&quot; Touring Award for Top Package Tour five consecutive years between 2005 and 2009, and again in 2011, 2012, and 2015.

<text>Viktor Fyodorovich Yerin (; 17 January 1944 – 19 March 2018) was a Russian politician and General of the Army who served as the country&#x27;s first post-Soviet Minister of Internal Affairs (1992—1995). Hero of the Russian Federation (1993).

== Biography ==
Viktor Yerin began his career in Soviet security forces (police). Working in Tatarstan police, he participated in investigating especially dangerous criminal bands. Since 1991 Yerin served as the first deputy minister of interior of the RSFSR. In January 1992, he became Russia&#x27;s interior minister. In November 1992, he led an operative staff for re-establishing constitutional order in the Ossetian-Ingush conflict region. From December 1994 to January 1995 he was in charge of the activities of the Internal Troops of Russia in Chechnya. On 30 June 1995, after the failed operation to free hostages taken by Chechen terrorists in Budyonnovsk, Yerin had to resign (as did the then-FSB director Stepashin). On 5 July 1995, Yerin was assigned the position of deputy director of Russia&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Service. 

In 1993, Viktor Yerin was awarded the title Hero of the Russian Federation for his part in quelling the anti-Yeltsin rebellion in October 1993.

<doc id="727918" wikidata="Q1444495" url="?curid=727918" title="Frank Yerby">
<text>Frank Garvin Yerby ( – ) was an American writer, best known for his 1946 historical novel &quot;The Foxes of Harrow&quot;.
==Early life==
Yerby was born in Augusta, Georgia, on September 5, 1916, the second of four children of Rufus Garvin Yerby (1886–1961), a hotel doorman, and Wilhelmina Ethel Yerby (née Smythe) (1888–1960), a teacher. Yerby&#x27;s ancestry was Black, White, and Native American. Yerby would later refer to himself as &quot;a young man whose list of ancestors read like a mini-United Nations.&quot; One of Yerby&#x27;s siblings was Alonzo Yerby, Associate Dean of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston and New York City Hospitals Commissioner.

As a child, Yerby attended Augusta&#x27;s Haines Institute, a private school for African Americans founded by Lucy Laney, from which he graduated in 1933. In 1937, he graduated from Paine College with a B.A. in English, and earned his M.A. in Dramatic Arts from Fisk University in 1938.

In 1938, he began courses for a doctorate in English at the University of Chicago, but left school for financial reasons in 1939. He was a professor of English at Florida A&amp;M University from 1939 - 1940 and then Southern University in Louisiana from 1940 - 1941, before moving to Detroit and New York, where he worked in wartime defense industries.

He began his literary career while he was a student at Paine College by publishing poetry, starting with the poems &quot;Miracles&quot; and &quot;Brevity&quot; in the September 1934 issue of &quot;New Challenge&quot;, a literary magazine published by Dorothy West. Two years later, Yerby would publish his first short story, &quot;Salute to the Flag,&quot; in the November 1936 issue of &quot;The Paineite&quot;, the student newspaper of Paine College. He would continue to publish poetry and short stories while he was a student at Paine College and Fisk University. While he was a student at the University of Chicago, he worked for the Federal Writers Project, writing about religious groups he observed on the south side of Chicago as part of the social history &quot;The Negro in Illinois&quot; under the supervision of the dancer, choreographer, and anthropologist Katherine Dunham.

Yerby continued to publish short stories and wrote the manuscript of a protest novel, &quot;This is My Own,&quot; about a black steel worker turned boxer who comes to a tragic end while he worked in the defense industry. That manuscript was rejected, but the editor Muriel Fuller of &quot;Redbook&quot; encouraged him to send her something else. He sent her the short story &quot;Health Card.&quot; She decided it was unsuitable for &quot;Redbook&quot;, but she sent it to &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, which published it in 1944. &quot;Health Card&quot; won the prestigious O. Henry Memorial Prize for best short story. The success of &quot;Health Card&quot; earned Yerby a book contract with Dial Press. The rejection of &quot;This is My Own&quot; caused Yerby to abandon protest literature in favor of historical fiction.

==Novelist==

Yerby was originally noted for writing romance novels set in the antebellum South. In mid-century, he began writing a series of best-selling historical novels ranging from the Athens of Pericles to Europe in the Dark Ages. Yerby took considerable pains in research and often end-noted his historical works. In all, he wrote 33 novels.

In 1946, he published &quot;The Foxes of Harrow&quot;, a Southern historical romance, which became the first novel by an African American to sell more than a million copies. In this work he faithfully reproduced many of the genre&#x27;s most familiar features, with the notable exception of his representation of African-American characters, who bore little resemblance to the &quot;happy darkies&quot; that appeared in such well-known works as &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; (1936). That same year he also became the first African American to have a book purchased for screen adaptation by a Hollywood studio, when 20th Century Fox optioned &quot;Foxes&quot;. Ultimately, the book became a 1947 film of the same name starring Rex Harrison and Maureen O&#x27;Hara which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Production Design (Lyle R. Wheeler, Maurice Ransford, Thomas Little, Paul S. Fox).

In some quarters, Yerby is best known for his masterpiece &quot;The Dahomean&quot; (1971). The novel, which focuses on the life of an enslaved African chief&#x27;s son who is transported to America, serves as the culmination of Yerby&#x27;s efforts toward incorporating racial themes into his works. Prior to that, Yerby was often criticized by blacks for the lack of focus on African-American characters in his books.

In 2012, &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote an article featuring an at-risk child whose life was turned around by reading Yerby books that one of his teachers was secretly providing to him.

==Private life==
Yerby married Flora Helen Claire Williams (1921 - 2001) in 1941. They had four children. The couple separated in 1955, and their divorce was finalized in 1956.

Yerby left the United States in 1952, in protest against racial discrimination, and moved to Nice, France, for three years. In 1955, he moved to Madrid, Spain where he remained for the rest of his life. Yerby married Blanca Calle-Perez in 1956.

Yerby died from liver cancer in Madrid and was interred there in the Cementerio de la Almudena, the biggest Spanish cemetery.

==Posthumous honors==
In 2006, Yerby was posthumously inducted into the Georgia Writers Hall of Fame.

In 2013, the Augusta Literary Festival created an award to honor Frank Yerby. This award is given to three fiction authors from a submission pool.

In 2023, the Georgia Historical Society, in partnership with the Lucy Craft Laney Museum of Black History, Haines Alumni Association, and Paine College, erected a Georgia historical marker in Augusta, Georgia recognizing the life and career of Frank Yerby.

==In popular media==
Uncle Percy in Thomas Mullen&#x27;s &quot;Darktown&quot; is partly based on Frank Yerby.

George R. R. Martin cites Frank Yerby as an influence on his own writing.

<doc id="727920" wikidata="Q6135815" url="?curid=727920" title="Stephanie Cheng">
<text>Stephanie Cheng (born 10 October 1984) is a Hong Kong cantopop singer. She debuted under Go East Entertainment with the song &quot;Grown Up&quot; in 2003 and has since released more than six albums and EPs. She is best known for her song &quot;Traffic Light&quot; 紅綠燈 released in 2006; the song topped all four major radio stations in Hong Kong and garnered many year-end chart awards.

== Life and career ==

=== 2003–2006: Career beginnings and breakthrough ===
She was born in Hong Kong and studied at Heep Yunn School and the Australian International School. After her graduation, she began modeling jobs until she was invited to be a singer. She took singing lessons from veteran singer Teresa Carpio. She signed a record deal with Go East Entertainment and a management contract with Starz People. In 2003, she made her debut with the single &quot;Grown Up&quot; 成人對待. She released her EP &quot;Grown Up&quot; on 27 November 2003. She released her first studio album &quot;Step by Step&quot; on 24 September 2004, promoted by the lead single &quot;Red Flower Club&quot; 紅花會. She returned the next year with the album &quot;Beat Beat,&quot; released on 18 October 2005.

In 2006, she signed with the record label East Asia Music 東亞唱片. The album &quot;Honey&quot; was released on 9 November 2006, preceded by the release of chart-topping single, &quot;Traffic Light&quot;. The song reached number one on all four major Hong Kong stations (903, RTHK, Metro, and TVB&#x27;s JSG).

=== 2007–2010: &quot;Super Girl,&quot; compilation album, and hiatus ===
In 2007, Cheng changed labels and signed with Star Entertainment 星娛樂. She returned to the charts with &quot;Big Girl&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Department Store&quot;, earning five number-ones between the two singles. The album &quot;Super Girl&quot; was released on 19 September 2007. In 2008, she collaborated with Pakho Chau in the duet &quot;Nothing Done&quot; 一事無成, and with MC Jin on &quot;Useless Love Song&quot;. Both these tracks were released in the album &quot;23&quot;, released 30 October 2008. The album also contained the singles &quot;Me Vs Me&quot;, &quot;Health Education&quot;, and &quot;Pay Back&quot;. In 2009, Cheng released her first greatest hits album, &quot;Stephanie Cheng New + Best Collection&quot;, containing 25 tracks, including three new singles. Cheng for the most part of 2010 took a hiatus from music, only releasing a duet (愛得起) with Linda Chung and &quot;Queen of Karaoke&quot; K歌之后.

=== 2011–2013: &quot;Spring/Summer 2011, EVO,&quot; 10-year anniversary ===
In 2011, Stephanie signed a management contract with Star Entertainment. She returned with the album &quot;Spring/Summer 2011&quot; on 18 May 2011, with the intention of releasing a part two titled &quot;Fall/Winter 2011&quot; containing dance tracks. &quot;Spring/Summer 2011&quot; was supported by the release of &quot;Kiss Kiss Kiss&quot; and &quot;Four Seasons&quot; (written by Justin Lo), the former being a three-chart number one song. The album also featured songs composed by singers Ivana Wong, Pong Nan, and G.E.M. In 2012, she released her second EP &quot;EVO&quot; which spawned the singles &quot;The Fifth Kind&quot;, &quot;Gradually&quot;, and &quot;I Just Wanna Dance&quot;. &quot;The Fifth Kind&quot; topped the RTHK and JSG charts.

Celebrating 10 years in the industry, Cheng released two compilation albums, &quot;Live Like 18 New + Best Selections Part One&quot; and &quot;Live Like 18 New + Best Selections Part Two&quot; in August and November 2013, respectively. Cheng&#x27;s popularity rose again with chart-topping singles &quot;Explode&quot; and &quot;Extraordinary Life&quot;. Cheng held her first concert Live Like 18 Concert on 6–7 December in Star Hall at the Kowloonbay International Trade &amp; Exhibition Centre.

=== 2014–present: Chessman and HMV Music ===
In 2014, Cheng signed a five-year deal with the label Chessman Hong Kong. Her music at Chessman was noted by a deviation from her ballads, experimenting with electro and dance music.

In 2016, she returned to her first manager Starz People and signed with HMV Music, citing differences between her and Chessman. She co-headlined concert SS 2017 Live with singer-actress Shiga Lin at the Macpherson Stadium on 9–10 September 2017. In December 2017, she returned to the charts with the single &quot;Unbreakable&quot; 死不了的. The song reached number one on Ultimate 903 in 2018.

In 2019, Stephanie Cheng launched the title song &quot;The Big Stupid Elephant on the 13th Floor&quot;, which was widely praised in online discussion areas and major media after sending the channel, and the trend on the pop song chart was very strong, becoming Stephanie Cheng&#x27;s second song with four championships. Two years later, Cheng used the same team to release her next highly anticipated single &quot;Drink More Water&quot;. The song was acclaimed by fans and major media immediately after it was released in early 2021. It was Cheng&#x27;s third four-channel champion song.

== Controversies ==
On 4 June 2012, at a Metro Radio event, Cheng was interviewed by TVB host Shermaine Wong. Cheng was asked about her relationship with her boyfriend; she swore at Wong after the interview. This caused outrage with TVB and the interview was pulled from the broadcast. Wong later interviewed Cheng again and showed to the media Cheng&#x27;s apology by text message.

<doc id="727925" wikidata="Q152767" url="?curid=727925" title="Brad Renfro">
<text>Brad Barron Renfro (July 25, 1982 – January 15, 2008) was an American actor. He made his film debut at age 11 with a starring role in &quot;The Client&quot; (1994). Renfro went on to appear in 21 feature films and won several awards. 

Prior to being cast in &quot;The Client&quot;, Renfro had no acting background and was living with his grandmother in a trailer park. Wanting to cast a &quot;tough kid&quot; who had the life experience to understand the character he would portray, director Joel Schumacher chose Renfro to play the role of Mark Sway. Renfro soon attracted a large fanbase as he continued to star in films such as &quot;The Cure&quot;, &quot;Tom and Huck&quot;, &quot;Sleepers&quot;, &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;, &quot;Bully&quot; and &quot;Ghost World&quot;.

Beginning in the late 1990s, Renfro experienced difficulties in his private life, including drug addiction and a series of arrests. He died at age 25 of acute heroin and morphine intoxication.

==Early childhood==
Renfro was born on July 25, 1982, in Knoxville, Tennessee, the son of Angela Denise Olsen (née McCrory) and Mark Renfro, a factory worker. He was raised from the age of five by his paternal grandmother, Joanne Renfro, a church secretary, after his parents divorced. The actor reportedly did not have a close relationship with his father.

==Acting career==
At the age of 10, Renfro was discovered by Mali Finn, a casting director for Joel Schumacher. He was recommended to Finn by a former D.A.R.E. officer of his, who was captivated by Renfro&#x27;s charm and street smarts. He had no prior acting experience or training at the time. Finn had contacted various agencies that worked with youth; she was looking to cast a &quot;tough&quot; kid and settled on Renfro after looking at 5,000 such boys all over the United States. At the time, Renfro had been living in a trailer park outside Knoxville with his grandmother. &quot;I wanted a kid who understood in the marrow of his psyche what it was like to grow up too soon,&quot; Schumacher later told &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Renfro was cast by Finn in the lead role of Mark Sway in Schumacher&#x27;s &quot;The Client&quot;. His casting was announced in May 1993, and the movie was filmed in the summer of that year. Based on the bestselling John Grisham novel, &quot;The Client&quot; became one of the top-grossing films of 1994. In 1995, he won &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s &quot;Young Star&quot; award, and in 1996 was nominated as one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;30 Under 30&quot; list.

Renfro played Huckleberry Finn in 1995&#x27;s &quot;Tom and Huck&quot;. He also won a second &quot;Young Star&quot; award, as well as a &quot;Young Artist&quot; award, for his performance in &quot;The Cure&quot;.

In 1996, Renfro appeared in &quot;Sleepers&quot;, which was based on the novel of the same name by Lorenzo Carcaterra. The film was directed by Barry Levinson and Renfro played the younger version of co-star Brad Pitt&#x27;s character. The following year, Renfro starred in &quot;Telling Lies in America&quot;, directed by Guy Ferland.

In 1998, he starred in &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;, directed by Bryan Singer, for which he won the Best Actor award at Tokyo International Film Festival and was also nominated for a Saturn Award. The several films Renfro starred in that followed gained little attention, with the majority going straight to video. He played Leon S. Kennedy in a live-action ad for &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; directed by George A. Romero, which aired in Japan. He went on to act in other films, including 2001&#x27;s &quot;Ghost World&quot;, &quot;Bully&quot;, &quot;Happy Campers&quot;, &quot;Tart&quot;; 2002&#x27;s &quot;American Girl&quot;; and 2005&#x27;s &quot;The Jacket&quot;. He also appeared in the 2006 &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; episode &quot;Watch&quot; and completed filming on the film &quot;The Informers.&quot;

Renfro appeared in the first version of the music video for the 10 Years song &quot;Wasteland&quot;; his cousin, Jesse Hasek, is the band&#x27;s lead singer. He was also featured in the video for the N.E.R.D song &quot;Provider&quot;, playing the part of a petty drug dealer.

==Personal life==
Renfro had a son, who was born in Japan in 2003 and was raised there by his mother, a Japanese citizen. Prior to Renfro&#x27;s death, the public had been unaware he had a son, and mention of him did not appear in his obituary, though his son was eventually named in the obituary of Renfro&#x27;s mother, Angela, who died in 2012.

===Substance abuse and criminal record===
On June 3, 1998, Renfro, then 15, and his 19-year-old cousin were arrested near Knoxville and charged with drug possession. Renfro was carrying two small bags of cocaine in a cigarette box and a bag of marijuana in his sock. He entered into a plea bargain in which he agreed to random drug tests.

By the age of 18, Renfro had already been in drug rehabilitation more than once. On August 28, 2000, he and a friend attempted to steal a yacht from the Fort Lauderdale harbor. Renfro was charged with grand theft and criminal mischief; in January 2001, he was sentenced to two years&#x27; probation and ordered to pay investigative costs and yacht repair costs. By this time, his encounters with the law had given him a complicated reputation: while still seen as a teenage idol, he was also known for his drug abuse. Renfro criticized the press and reporters who tried to interview him, saying, &quot;You can just feel the slime on them&quot;, and called movie critics &quot;the fat kids in high school that nobody liked, so they&#x27;re out there to get you&quot;.

Renfro violated his probation in May 2001 when he was arrested for underage drinking. On January 14, 2002, he violated his probation again and was arrested on charges of public intoxication and driving without a valid license in Knoxville. He was placed into a three-month substance abuse treatment program as a result.

On November 24, 2005, Renfro was arrested in Los Angeles and charged with a misdemeanor count of driving under the influence and two counts of driving with a suspended license, leading to 10 days in jail and 18 months of alcohol education classes. He was arrested by LAPD officers on December 22, 2005, during an undercover drug sweep of Skid Row. Following that arrest, he was charged with attempted possession of heroin. A photograph showing him in handcuffs made the front page of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Renfro admitted to a detective that he was using heroin and methadone. He pleaded guilty, was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation, and was fined $450. In May 2006, he spent 10 days in jail for driving while under the influence and attempted heroin possession.

In June 2007, Renfro was found to have violated his probation by failing to enroll in a long-term drug treatment program. A judge warned him that if he violated probation twice more he could be sentenced to a live-in rehabilitation program or to jail.

Following Renfro&#x27;s death in January 2008, his cousin Jesse Hasek stated that Renfro and his son had visited him several days earlier and that Renfro had made positive changes in his life. According to Hasek, &quot;He had hit rock bottom and had come way back up.&quot;

== Death ==
Renfro was found dead on January 15, 2008, in his Los Angeles apartment, at the age of 25. His body was returned to Tennessee, where he was buried on January 22, 2008, at Red House Cemetery in the small town of Blaine, Tennessee. On February 8, 2008, the Los Angeles County Coroner&#x27;s office ruled his death accidental, attributing it to acute heroin/morphine intoxication.
Seventeen days after Renfro&#x27;s death, his grandmother Joanne—who had accompanied him regularly during his early acting career—died at her home at the age of 76. Local officials said she died of natural causes.

== Legacy ==
Renfro was omitted from the &quot;In Memoriam&quot; tribute montage at the 80th Academy Awards in the year following his death. Perceived by the press as a &quot;snub&quot;, his omission from the Oscars received widespread media coverage.

Renfro&#x27;s roommate, Mark Foster of Foster the People, wrote a song about his death called &quot;Downtown&quot;. The song was included on a deluxe edition of the band&#x27;s 2011 debut album &quot;Torches&quot;.

In 2012, the art magazine &quot;The Thing Quarterly&quot; reported that actor James Franco had the name &quot;Brad&quot; tattooed on his right shoulder in memory of Renfro. Franco also produced a limited-edition series of switchblades bearing the words &quot;Brad Renfro&quot; and &quot;Forever.&quot;

In 2018, 10 years after Renfro&#x27;s death, and again the following year, the website &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; devoted a long article to recounting his rise and descent. The article discussed whether the film industry adequately protects the welfare of at-risk child actors. &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; found no evidence that laws or contractual provisions had been violated on Renfro&#x27;s films, but suggested that the industry had failed the actor by not ensuring that he was appropriately supervised when he was off the movie set.

Fernando Altschul, the first assistant director of &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;, told &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; that he saw a 14-year-old Renfro at an on-set party where alcohol was available. According to Altschul, Renfro was the only underage attendee.

During Renfro&#x27;s early career, his worldliness and self-confidence caused many adults who came into contact with him to believe that he was some years older than his actual age. Gemma Jackson, production designer on &quot;Tom and Huck&quot;, remembered Renfro as being 15 or 16 years of age during filming when he was actually 13. Jackson recounted to &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; that during production, Renfro had a girlfriend who was several years his senior. He developed an ardent following among adolescent girls; Peter Horton, director of &quot;The Cure&quot;, recalled that Renfro—who had just turned 12—received cards from girls in Stillwater, Minnesota, that contained sexually suggestive messages.

Renfro&#x27;s apparent maturity was reflected in his onscreen portrayals. In his early roles, he was often sexualized and shown shirtless. In &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;, Renfro was shown showering. He also performed scenes with sexual and violent content.

<doc id="727932" wikidata="Q467414" url="?curid=727932" title="Mary Lou McDonald">
<text>Mary Louise McDonald (born 1 May 1969) is an Irish politician who has served as Leader of the Opposition in Ireland since June 2020, as President of Sinn Féin since February 2018, and as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin Central constituency since 2011. She previously served as vice president of Sinn Féin from 2009 to 2018 and as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Dublin constituency from 2004 to 2009.

On 10 February 2018, following a special (party conference) in Dublin, McDonald succeeded Gerry Adams to become Sinn Féin&#x27;s first new leader since 1983 and the party&#x27;s first female leader since Margaret Buckley (president from 1937 to 1950). She led the party into the 2020 general election, in which Sinn Féin delivered its best ever general election performance, attaining 24.5 percent of the vote and winning 37 seats in Dáil Éireann, one fewer than Fianna Fáil and two more than Fine Gael.

Following Micheál Martin&#x27;s appointment as Taoiseach in June 2020, after the formation of a Fianna Fáil, Green Party and Fine Gael coalition government, McDonald became Leader of the Opposition. She is the first woman to occupy that position and the first to come from a party other than Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael since the Labour Party&#x27;s Thomas Johnson in 1927.

==Early life and education==
Born into a middle-class family in south Dublin to builder and surveyor Patrick McDonald and housewife Joan, her parents separated when she was nine years old and she stayed with her mother in Rathgar. She has three siblings, one older and two younger. Her sister Joanne was involved with the socialist republican party Éirígí in the late 2000s and is a teacher. McDonald&#x27;s great-uncle, James O&#x27;Connor, was a member of the Anti-Treaty IRA who was executed at the Curragh Camp during the Irish Civil War. He was charged with illegally possessing firearms, which carried the death penalty at the time. O&#x27;Connor was 24 years old at the time. In January 2023, McDonald said that one of her siblings had transitioned from male to female in 2021, and that she was on a &quot;learning curve&quot; about transgender issues.

McDonald was educated at Rathgar National School and at the Catholic all-girls, Notre Dame Des Missions in Churchtown, South Dublin, where she was involved in debating.

After school, McDonald attended Trinity College Dublin, from which she received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English Literature. She later studied industrial relations at Dublin City University, and also received a Master of Arts degree in European Integration Studies from the University of Limerick in 1995. She worked as a researcher for the Institute of European Affairs, a consultant for the Irish Productivity Centre (a human resources consultancy that was jointly operated by Ibec and ICTU) and a trainer in the Partnership Unit of the Educational and Training Services Trust.

McDonald became involved with the Irish National Congress, a cross-party republican organisation, and became chairperson in 2000, leading a protest in Dublin against the involvement of the city&#x27;s Lord Mayor in the unveiling of a plaque at the location where the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland held its first meeting in 1798.

==Political career==
McDonald started her political career by first joining Fianna Fáil in 1998, but she left the party after a year due to core policy differences, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland and social justice. Asked in 2014 about her participation in Fianna Fáil, McDonald stated she had been &quot;in the wrong party&quot; and quickly realised that Sinn Féin was a more appropriate party for her Republican views after meeting Sinn Féin members through the Irish National Congress.

===European Parliament and early Dáil attempts===
McDonald has been a member of the Sinn Féin party leadership since 2001.

She first ran for office when she unsuccessfully contested the Dublin West constituency for Sinn Féin at the 2002 general election, polling 8.02% of first preference votes.

In September 2003, McDonald attracted criticism when she spoke at a rally in Dublin to commemorate Seán Russell, an IRA leader who had actively collaborated with Nazi Germany, offered the Nazis the IRA&#x27;s support during WWII, and met with Joachim von Ribbentrop.

In 2004, McDonald became Sinn Féin&#x27;s first MEP in Ireland, when she was elected at the 2004 European Parliament election for the Dublin constituency, receiving over 60,000 first preference votes. She served as one of two Sinn Féin MEPs, the other being Bairbre de Brún who was representing Northern Ireland. In 2007, she was shortlisted for the &#x27;MEP of the Year&#x27; award by the European Parliament magazine for &quot;making the most valuable contribution in the field of employment policy&quot;. McDonald sat as a member of the European Parliament&#x27;s Employment and Social Affairs Committee, and as a substitute of the Civil Liberties Committee.

She was an unsuccessful candidate in the Dublin Central constituency at the 2007 general election. In 2009 she became the vice president of Sinn Féin.

For the 2009 European Parliament election, the number of seats for Dublin in the European Parliament was reduced from four to three. McDonald was in a tight race for the last seat against Fianna Fáil&#x27;s Eoin Ryan and the Socialist Party leader Joe Higgins. McDonald lost her seat to Higgins, being eliminated at the fifth count. Her first preference vote had declined to nearly 48,000.

In June 2009, McDonald faced criticism after it emerged her campaign office was selling IRA souvenirs and memorabilia.

McDonald has voiced her opposition to the Treaty of Lisbon and has said that the &quot;EU/IMF deal must be turned down&quot;.

===Dáil Éireann (2011–present)===

McDonald contested the Dublin Central constituency again at the 2011 general election, this time picking up 13.1% of first preference votes; she was successful in taking the last seat in the constituency. Following the election she became Sinn Féin&#x27;s Spokesperson for Public Expenditure and Reform and was a member of the Public Accounts Committee from then until 2017.

In 2012, McDonald was awarded &#x27;Opposition Politician of the Year&#x27; by TV3&#x27;s &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot; political talk show.

In November 2014, McDonald refused to leave the Dáil chamber after a vote resulted in her suspension. McDonald had questioned Tánaiste Joan Burton as to whether the government would allow payments to be taken from citizens&#x27; wages or social welfare payments if they did not comply with the payment of newly introduced water charges. McDonald argued that Burton failed to directly answer her questions and was being deliberately evasive and intractable. She, along with a number of Sinn Féin colleagues, remained in the chamber for four and a half hours in protest of Burton&#x27;s alleged refusal to answer her questions. In response, the Ceann Comhairle Seán Barrett adjourned the Dáil for a number of days.

In December 2015, McDonald initially backed Thomas &quot;Slab&quot; Murphy, whom she described as a &quot;good republican&quot; despite his having just been convicted on nine charges of tax evasion following a trial that was held in the Special Criminal Court in part because, after a 1999 court case in Dublin, the last person to testify against Murphy in that case was bludgeoned to death. She later failed to back party leader Gerry Adams&#x27; assertion that Thomas Murphy is a &quot;good republican&quot; after a BBC Spotlight investigation accused Murphy of being a &quot;mass murderer&quot;.

After her re-election to the Dáil in 2016 general election, in which she topped the poll in Dublin Central, she became Sinn Féin&#x27;s All-Ireland Spokesperson for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, which she held until being elected president of Sinn Féin in 2018.

===Leader of Sinn Féin (2018–present)===

At a Sinn Féin party conference on 18 November 2017, Gerry Adams was re-elected party leader, but announced that he would ask the Sinn Féin party leadership to call for a special Ard Fheis to be held within three months to choose a new president, and that he would not stand for re-election as TD for the Louth constituency in the next election.

At the close of nominations to succeed Adams on 20 January 2018, McDonald was announced as the president-elect of Sinn Féin, as she was the sole nominee to enter the race. She was confirmed as president at a special Ard Fheis on 10 February 2018 in Dublin.

In March 2019, McDonald was criticised by some, including Fine Gael politician Simon Coveney, for walking behind a banner in the New York City St. Patrick&#x27;s day parade which read &quot;England Get Out of Ireland&quot;. In the immediate aftermath of the incident support for Sinn Féin in opinion polls dropped from 18% to 13%, with McDonald apologising for her actions shortly afterwards, but stated she believed the message to be directed at the British state, not the English people.

Shortly afterwards on 24 May 2019, the 2019 European Parliament election in Ireland and 2019 Irish local elections were held simultaneously. In the European elections, Sinn Féin lost 2 MEPs and dropped their vote share by 7.8%, while in the local elections the party lost 78 (almost half) of their local councillors and dropped their vote share by 5.7%. The result was considered &quot;disastrous&quot; for Sinn Féin. McDonald stated &quot;It was a really bad day out for us. But sometimes that happens in politics, and it’s a test for you. I mean it’s a test for me personally, obviously, as the leader&quot;.

However, at the 2020 general election, the party rebounded and attained 24.5% of the first preference votes, placing them ahead of Fine Gael by 3.6% and Fianna Fáil by 2.3%. It was the best general election result in the modern history of Sinn Féin. In the Dublin Central constituency, McDonald topped the poll with 35.7% of the first preference votes.

McDonald touted the party&#x27;s electoral success as a &quot;revolution&quot; and expressed her desire to form a coalition government, declaring that Ireland &quot;is no longer a two-party system&quot;. Sinn Féin TD Matt Carthy credited McDonald&#x27;s leadership and her ability to clarify Sinn Féin&#x27;s policies to the electorate with contributing to the stark turn around between the May elections of 2019 and the general election result of 2020. McDonald&#x27;s high satisfaction rating as party leader was also cited by others as another contributing factor in Sinn Féin&#x27;s result.

===Leader of the Opposition (2020–present)===
McDonald was nominated as Taoiseach on 20 February 2020, but was defeated 45 to 84. On 26 June 2020, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, and the Green Party formed a coalition government, leaving Sinn Féin as the largest opposition party, and McDonald as Leader of the Opposition. She dismissed the coalition agreement as a &quot;marriage of convenience&quot;, and accused Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael of conspiring to exclude Sinn Féin from government.

In March 2023, McDonald told &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; that she expected an Irish unity referendum to be &#x27;within this Decade&#x27;.

At the 2024 general election, McDonald was re-elected to the Dáil topping the poll in Dublin Central with Sinn Feín increased their seat share by 2 seats remaining the second largest party by representation in the Dáil and attained 19% of the first preference votes a fall of 5.5% from 2020 and fell behind Fianna Fáil by 2.9% and Fine Gael by 1.8%. 

McDonald was nominated as Taoiseach on 18 December 2024, but was defeated 44 to 110.

==Public image==
McDonald has been credited with being part of a new generation of Sinn Féin members, who have broadened its appeal and increased its vote since she first held public office. She became the party&#x27;s first MEP in 2004, receiving more than triple the percentage of votes the party had received five years earlier. Writing on McDonald and the 2004 election success for Sinn Féin (using the subheading &#x27;&quot;Shopaholic Trinity girl is face of new Sinn Fein&quot;), &quot;The Times&quot; described McDonald as &quot;more Brown Thomas beret than balaclava&quot; and &quot;part of a new generation of Sinn Féiners.&quot; The paper continued by stating that &quot;another Trinity graduate was elected in Donaghmede, while party candidates in Dublin also included a philosophy student and somebody called Pembroke, an unlikely name for a republican. The irony is that the smoked-salmon socialists are just as effective at mopping up working-class votes as the middle-aged Sinn Fein men who saw &#x27;action&#x27; in the 1980s or served time in prison. McDonald stretched the Sinn Fein constituency to the full, attracting votes and transfers from leafy suburbs as well as ghettoes.&quot;

McDonald has been credited for her leadership ability and popular appeal. Kathy Sheridan of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; wrote of McDonald: &quot;It is a cliche to say that Mary Lou McDonald is an enigma but it&#x27;s nonetheless true. Likable, warm and approachable yet never quite revealing herself. A straight-talker who appears to shoot from the hip yet says nothing that has not been thoroughly considered.&quot; Sheridan also claimed that she was &quot;the embodiment of educated, Dublin 6 middle-class privilege who peddles a persuasive anti-establishment line and attracts the kind of adoring scrums last seen in Bertie Ahern’s heyday.&quot; Sheridan summarised that she had brought Sinn Féin into the mainstream of Irish politics.&quot; As of November 2021, Sinn Féin, under her leadership, was the most popular party in opinion polls.

Those critical of McDonald&#x27;s public image point to her handling of allegations of bullying and other abuses within Sinn Féin. Critics have negatively responded to her reaction to the Máiría Cahill affair of the 2010s, in which Cahill alleged that members of the Provisional IRA had sexually abused her as a teenager and subsequently that this information was suppressed by members of Sinn Féin. McDonald&#x27;s handling in 2022 of allegations of bullying within the party from Violet-Anne Wynne have also been met with criticism, with journalist Jennifer Bray describing the situation as putting McDonald and her leadership &quot;in a very unflattering light&quot;. From 2015 onwards, McDonald has had to distance herself from former Sinn Féin councillor Jonathan Dowdall, who in 2018 was found guilty of the kidnap and torture of a man, and in 2022 plead guilty to the killing of David Byrne. Dowdall became a Sinn Féin councillor in 2014 in McDonald&#x27;s constituency and has been described by &quot;the Guardian&quot; as a McDonald &quot;protege&quot; during the year-long period in which he worked as a councillor. &quot;The Guardian&quot; went on to suggest that the Dowdall connection had &quot;tainted&quot; McDonald&#x27;s image.

==Harassment== 
In July 2024, a death threat was made against McDonald in a video posted on TikTok by a man who said he would shoot and kill her. McDonald described the threat on her life as &quot;very shocking and very disturbing&quot; and reported the matter to the Garda Síochána. A 28-year-old man was later arrested.

==Personal life==
McDonald&#x27;s husband, Martin Lanigan, works as a gas control superintendent for the emergency dispatch division of Gas Networks Ireland, a state infrastructure provider. They have two children. She lives in Cabra, Dublin. She learned Transcendental Meditation &quot;for resilience and for keeping myself grounded and calm.&quot;

===Health===
McDonald has asthma. In April 2020, she announced that she had tested positive for COVID-19 following a test she took on 28 March. In a statement she said that she had recovered from the condition but had developed pleurisy in her right lung. She said that the Public Health Doctor had told her that she was no longer infected or infectious. In 2023, McDonald confirmed she had undergone a hysterectomy, to remove her ovaries and womb. Her recovery went well and she soon returned to her political work.

<doc id="727936" wikidata="Q1090696" url="?curid=727936" title="Muttley">
<text>Muttley is a fictional dog created in 1968 by Hanna-Barbera Productions; he was originally voiced by Don Messick. He is the sidekick (and often foil) to the cartoon villain Dick Dastardly, and appeared with him in the 1968 television series &quot;Wacky Races&quot; and its 1969 spinoff, &quot;Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines&quot;. The character is known best for his mischievous, rasping laugh.

==Characterization==
Muttley first appeared in &quot;Wacky Races&quot; in 1968, as the sidekick of the accident-prone villain Dick Dastardly. While Dick was created as the equivalent of Professor Fate from the 1965 movie &quot;The Great Race&quot;, Muttley mirrored the film&#x27;s character of Max Meen. Dastardly and Muttley were paired together in various later Hanna-Barbera series as bumbling villains.

As his name implies, Muttley is a mixed breed dog, identified in the &quot;Wacky Races&quot; segment &quot;Dash to Delaware&quot; as a mix of bloodhound, pointer, Airedale, and hunting dog. During &quot;Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines&quot;, in the episode &quot;Sappy Birthday&quot;, Muttley shows a calendar where April 16 is marked; his birthday. In an audio commentary for &quot;Dastardly and Muttley&quot;, the designers comment that they conceived of Muttley&#x27;s shape as what a dog would look like if he were a tank-styled vacuum cleaner.

Muttley does not really talk; his main examples of speech are his trademark &quot;wheezy snicker&quot; (usually at Dick&#x27;s expense, who sometimes retaliates by thumping him on the head) and a mushy, &quot;sotto voce&quot; grumble against an unsympathetic or harsh Dick (usually along the lines of &quot;Snazza frazza rashin&#x27; fashin&#x27; Rick Rastardly!&quot;). 

Don Messick had previously used Muttley&#x27;s distinctive laugh in other Hanna-Barbara productions. In the Huckleberry Hound cartoons, Messick voiced a black-and-white dog who enjoyed antagonizing Huck the mailman, dog catcher, barbecuer, etc. Messick also used the same snickering chortle for &quot;Snuggles,&quot; a mischievous dog who tormented Quick Draw McGraw; then for &quot;Griswold&quot; in an episode of &quot;Top Cat&quot;; then for &quot;Mugger&quot; appearing in the 1964 movie &quot;Hey There, It&#x27;s Yogi Bear&quot;; and again for &quot;Precious Pupp&quot; in 1966. He also repurposed the characterization for Alexandra Cabot&#x27;s cat Sebastian on &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; in 1970.

Muttley (who turned from a &quot;bluish hue&quot; to a &quot;dusty brown&quot;) wore only a collar in &quot;Wacky Races&quot;, but in &quot;Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines&quot;, he donned a World War I style aviator&#x27;s cap and scarf, and served as a flying ace along with Dastardly and two other pilots as members of the &quot;Vulture Squadron&quot;. In this spinoff, he also sported many medals and constantly demanded new ones from Dastardly for following his commands. Similarly, Dastardly frequently ripped medals off Muttley&#x27;s chest as punishment for his incompetence. And it was upon joining &quot;Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines&quot; that Muttley gained the ability to fly in brief spurts by spinning his tail like a helicopter rotor blade.

Muttley also enjoyed his own short segment in the series &quot;Magnificent Muttley&quot;, where he would engage in Walter Mitty-style fantasies. The designers speculated that Muttley was popular that the producers wanted to give Muttley some time as a solo character.

==Muttley vs. Mumbly==
Muttley is sometimes confused with the crime-fighting dog Mumbly from &quot;The Mumbly Cartoon Show&quot;. Mumbly looked very similar to Muttley and had the same wheezy snicker, but their ears were different and Mumbly had blue fur and wore a trenchcoat. Mumbly later showed up as the captain of the villainous Really Rottens in &quot;Laff-a-Lympics&quot; along with his accomplice, &quot;The Dread Baron,&quot; who resembles Dick Dastardly. The Dread Baron and Mumbly later appeared in the TV movie &quot;Yogi Bear and the Magical Flight of the Spruce Goose&quot;. It is not certain why Mumbly was retconned as a villain, neither is it certain why he and Dread Baron were apparently used as substitutes for Dastardly and Muttley, especially in the Yogi Bear movie where Paul Winchell voiced the Baron instead of Dastardly (and in the scene where the Baron&#x27;s crashed plane is shown, it is Dick&#x27;s plane from &quot;Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines&quot;, complete with the &quot;D&quot; on the side). In that story, Mumbly had once utilized his tail to fly just like Muttley does in &quot;Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines&quot;. The reason most suggested is that the Wacky Races characters (including Dastardly and Muttley) were not fully owned by Hanna-Barbera as the show was a co-production with Heatter-Quigley Productions.

An early version of the Muttley/Mumbly character appears in the 1964 Hanna-Barbera feature film &quot;Hey There, It&#x27;s Yogi Bear!&quot;. This prototype Muttley (&quot;Mugger&quot;) is a mean-spirited dog with a travelling circus who has a penchant for biting his owners on the leg. The character may also have been inspired by &quot;The Atom Ant Show&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Precious Pupp&quot;, who was known for laughing the same way. Muttley and his master returned in the Wacky Races video game with Billy West voicing the dog.

==Other appearances==

* Muttley and Dick Dastardly also starred as the villains in &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Treasure Hunt&quot; in their submarine the SS. Dirty Tricks.
* Muttley appeared briefly in &quot;The Good, the Bad, and Huckleberry Hound&quot;.
* In the &quot;Fender Bender 500&quot; segment of &quot;Wake, Rattle, and Roll&quot;, he and Dick Dastardly are paired up as they were in the &quot;Wacky Races&quot; TV show. The car they drove looked similar to The Mean Machine, but was called &quot;The Dirty Truckster&quot;. 
* Muttley appeared as a teenager in &quot;Yo Yogi!&quot; alongside Dick Dastardly.
* In the &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; episode &quot;MMORPD&quot;, one of the forms that Duck Dodgers turns himself into is Muttley. In this brief appearance, Muttley&#x27;s vocal effects are done by Joe Alaskey.
* Muttley has made at least one brief appearance in &quot;Dynomutt&quot;.
* Muttley appears alongside Dick Dastardly as one of the main characters in the 2016 &quot;Wacky Raceland&quot; comic book. In this version, Muttley is reimagined as a mangy rabid dog with several robotic prosthetics and a taste for mutant flesh. It is revealed that he was a guinea pig in a lab experiment conducted by Professor Pat Pending and that its original codename was &quot;SC-BB-02&quot;.
** Another version of Muttley appeared in &quot;Dastardly &amp; Muttley&quot;, also published by DC Comics under the &quot;Hanna-Barbera Beyond&quot; initiative. This version is Cpt. Dudley &quot;Mutt&quot; Muller, a United States Air Force navigator and partner of Lt. Col. Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Atcherly, who is fused with his pet dog by the mysterious element &quot;unstabilium&quot;.
* In the 2000 &quot;Wacky Races&quot; video game, Muttley was voiced by Billy West.
* Muttley appeared alongside Dick Dastardly in the animated &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; film &quot;Scoob!&quot; (2020), where Billy West reprised his role, though the film used archival recordings of Messick for Muttley&#x27;s laugh. In the film, Muttley was trapped in the underworld after an attempt by Dastardly to steal Alexander the Great&#x27;s treasure from the Underworld through a dimensional portal serving as a back door. The plan backfired when the portal turns out to be one-way. Dastardly spent most of the film trying to save Muttley by going after the Skulls of Cerberus, and managed to do so in the film&#x27;s climax. They were both captured by Dastardly&#x27;s reformed robot henchmen the Rottens and taken away by Blue Falcon, Dynomutt, and Dee Dee Skyes to be handed over to the police. During the end credits, Muttley is shown breaking Dick Dastardly out of prison.
* Muttley makes a brief cameo appearance in the 2021 film &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;. When the Warner Bros. Serververse inhabitants were making their way to the site of the basketball game between the Tune Squad and the Goon Squad, Muttley is seen trying to lunge at The Great Gazoo only to miss as the latter teleports away. Muttley&#x27;s design is the same as the design seen in &quot;Scoob!&quot;
* Muttley is mentioned in the &quot;Jellystone!&quot; season 2 episode &quot;Lady Danjjer: Is It Wrong to Long for Kabong?&quot; He is mentioned to be Loopy de Loop&#x27;s ex-boyfriend. Muttley appears in season 3, voiced by Dana Snyder.

<text>M*A*S*H (an acronym for Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) is an American media franchise consisting of a series of novels, a film, several television series, plays, and other properties, and based on the semi-autobiographical fiction of Richard Hooker.

The franchise depicts a group of fictional characters who served at the fictional &quot;4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (M*A*S*H)&quot; during the Korean War, loosely based on the historic 8055th MASH unit. Hawkeye Pierce is featured as the main character, played by Donald Sutherland in the 1970 film &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and by Alan Alda on the television series also titled &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. Later spin-offs involve characters who appeared in the series, but were set after the end of the war. Almost all versions of the series fit into the genre of black comedy or dramedy; the lead characters were doctors, nurses and patients, and the practice of medicine was at the center of events. However, to relieve the pressures of duty in a field hospital close to the front and the attendant horrors of war, the staff engage in humorous hijinks, frivolity, and petty rivalries off-duty.

The franchise effectively ended with the conclusion of &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot; in September 1986. A large fanbase for the series continues to exist; the show has never been out of syndication worldwide, and 20th Century Fox has had notable success selling the film and seasons of the TV series on DVD.

==Novels==

Richard Hooker wrote &quot;&quot; (1968) based on his experiences as a surgeon at the 8055th MASH in South Korea. He published several other novels based on that group. A total of 15 M*A*S*H novels were published between 1968 and 1977, some co-authored by William E. Butterworth.

==Film==

&quot;M*A*S*H&quot; is a 1970 feature film adaptation of the original novel. The film was directed by Robert Altman and starred Donald Sutherland as Hawkeye Pierce and Elliott Gould as Trapper John McIntyre. Although the title had no punctuation onscreen, i.e. &quot;MASH&quot;, in posters for the movie and in the trailer, it was rendered as &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;.

==Television==

&quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, a TV adaptation of the film, ran from 1972 to 1983, more than three times as long as the war it chronicled. It starred Alan Alda as Hawkeye Pierce and Wayne Rogers as Trapper John McIntyre. After the third season, Rogers left the show and was replaced by Mike Farrell as B. J. Hunnicutt. That same year, Harry Morgan replaced McLean Stevenson. Morgan, a veteran character actor and former Universal contract player, portrayed Colonel Sherman T. Potter. This series is the most popular and best-known version of the franchise and was ranked #25 in &quot;TV Guide&quot;&#x27;s &quot;50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time&quot;. Its final episode in 1983 was the most-watched in television history.

&quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot; featured the character of Trapper John McIntyre, played by Pernell Roberts, twenty-eight years after the events of the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; film and television series. It was the first spin-off to feature a character from the series in civilian life after the war. Legally, &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot; is a direct spin-off of the &quot;MASH&quot; film rather than the television series due to licensing issues. The pilot episode briefly shows a photograph of Rogers and Alda.

&quot;AfterMASH&quot; was a successor to the original &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; television series, featuring Harry Morgan, Jamie Farr, and William Christopher after the war, as the same characters they played in the original television series. Gary Burghoff and Edward Winter also appeared as guests. The series was canceled after two seasons.

&quot;W*A*L*T*E*R&quot; was the pilot for a television series that was not picked up. It would have featured Gary Burghoff reprising the role of Walter O&#x27;Reilly. The pilot was shown as a &quot;CBS Special Presentation&quot; on July 17, 1984.

==Plays==
In 1973, a play by Tim Kelly, based on the book, television show, and film, was published in both one-act and full versions. The play incorporates many of the characters but omits more of the dark comedy aspects. It is occasionally produced by community theater and high school theater companies.

==Elsewhere==
The cast from the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; series appeared in advertising for IBM products, such as the PS/2 line that introduced the PS/2 connector for keyboards and mice.

Fox developed a &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; video game that was released for the Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit computers, and TI-99/4A. Players alternate between controlling a helicopter picking up wounded soldiers from the front and a surgeon removing shrapnel from a soldier, similar to &quot;Microsurgeon&quot;. &quot;InfoWorld&quot; called &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; &quot;the exception&quot; among the TI 99/4A&#x27;s generally poor game library.

<text>Kathy Sinnott (; born 29 September 1950) is an American-Irish disability rights activist and politician who served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the South constituency from 2004 to 2009.

==Early life==
Sinnott was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1950. She married Irishman Declan Sinnott when they were both aged twenty one. The couple settled in County Cork and have three daughters and six sons together; they are now separated.

==Career==
She is secretary of the Hope Project, a charity that helps people with disabilities. Sinnott founded the Hope Project in 1996. In 2000, she took a court case to force the Government of Ireland to provide a primary school education for her son Jamie who has multiple disabilities. In 2001, the High Court ruled that every person in Ireland had a constitutional right to free appropriate primary education based on need. The judgment confirmed that this was a fundamental right which was not limited by the availability of resources. The government did not challenge the High Court decision for children 18 years and younger, but successfully appealed its application to persons over 18 years of age in the Supreme Court.

==Public office==
Sinnott was elected as an MEP for the South constituency at the 2004 European Parliament election. She campaigned on disability, education, anti-abortion, euroscepticism and social conservatism issues.

She had stood previously at the 2002 general election for a seat in the Cork South-Central constituency, and narrowly lost the fifth and final seat to John Dennehy of Fianna Fáil. In the election count, she was initially ahead by 3 votes but lost by 6 votes after two recounts. She was an unsuccessful candidate at the subsequent Seanad Éireann election, after she had been nominated by four sitting independent TDs, losing out by three votes to a Fine Gael candidate. She required a High Court judgment to allow her to run for the Seanad on the Labour Panel.

She is a former co-chair of the European Parliament&#x27;s Eurosceptic Independence/Democracy group. Sinnott was a member and vice-president of the EUDemocrats – Alliance for a Europe of Democracies.

She was featured in a German TV exposé where MEPs were filmed signing up at 7am for their daily attendance allowance prior to then leaving parliament for the day, in 2008.

On 8 June 2009, Sinnott lost her seat in the European Parliament. She received 30% fewer votes than in the 2004 European Parliament election.

On 21 September 2009, her son Kevin drowned in a swimming accident in the US state of Georgia. He was a final year philosophy student at the Southern Catholic College in Dawsonville, Georgia.

In 2012, Sinnott campaigned against the Children&#x27;s referendum, claiming it would &quot;lock in&quot; the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to the Irish Constitution and claiming that a &quot;child is six times more likely to die in care at the hands of the State, than in the care of their parents.&quot; Her statistics drew criticism from the Minister Leo Varadkar who labelled them &quot;incredible&quot; and &quot;made up.&quot;

In 2015, Sinnott campaigned against the 2015 referendum on same-sex marriage as part of the &quot;First Families First&quot; campaign group, alongside John Waters.

, she is the host of Celtic Connections, a programme on EWTN Radio.

<text>Estádio Adelmar da Costa Carvalho, commonly known as Estádio Ilha do Retiro, Ilha do Retiro or simply Ilha, is a football stadium situated in Recife, State of Pernambuco, in Northeastern Brazil, and owned by Sport Club do Recife.

The stadium&#x27;s official name is Estádio Adelmar da Costa Carvalho, and it was inaugurated on July 4, 1937. The stadium&#x27;s common name, Ilha do Retiro, is the name of the neighborhood where it is located. The stadium&#x27;s official name, Adelmar da Costa Carvalho, is in honor of the Sport Club do Recife president who presided over the first major renovation of the stadium.

== History ==

Ilha do Retiro was the first stadium to be built in Recife, after Sport Recife bought a 17-hectare small ranch.

In the 1950 World Cup, the match between Chile and the United States was played at the stadium.

In 1987, fans watched Sport win a historical match against “paulista” side Guarani, that gave the Lion their first national trophy, the Campeonato Brasileiro of 1987, even though Flamengo claim to have won it too. The case went to the Supreme Federal Court and Sport won.

In 2008, the stadium was once again the stage of an epic match, this time at the final of the 2008 Copa do Brasil, against Corinthians. They had lost the first leg on Parque São Jorge by 3x1, with the leonine goal being scored on the final moments of the match. Now playing in Recife, Sport managed to get a 2x0 win, and won on away goals. The victory was so unexpected, that Corinthians had signed a trophy afterparty before the match, only for the party to be cancelled later on.

<doc id="727981" wikidata="Q4751124" url="?curid=727981" title="Analytic capacity">
<text>In the mathematical discipline of complex analysis, the analytic capacity of a compact subset &quot;K&quot; of the complex plane is a number that denotes &quot;how big&quot; a bounded analytic function on C \ &quot;K&quot; can become. Roughly speaking, &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) measures the size of the unit ball of the space of bounded analytic functions outside &quot;K&quot;.

It was first introduced by Lars Ahlfors in the 1940s while studying the removability of singularities of bounded analytic functions.

==Definition==
Let &quot;K&quot; ⊂ C be compact. Then its analytic capacity is defined to be

:formula_1

Here, formula_2 denotes the set of bounded analytic functions &quot;U&quot; → C, whenever &quot;U&quot; is an open subset of the complex plane. Further,

:formula_3
:formula_4

Note that formula_5, where formula_6. However, usually formula_7.

Equivalently, the analytic capacity may be defined as
:formula_8
where &quot;C&quot; is a contour enclosing &quot;K&quot; and the supremum is taken over &quot;f&quot; satisfying the same conditions as above: &quot;f&quot; is bounded analytic outside &quot;K&quot;, the bound is one, and formula_9

If &quot;A&quot; ⊂ C is an arbitrary set, then we define

:formula_10

==Removable sets and Painlevé&#x27;s problem==
The compact set &quot;K&quot; is called removable if, whenever Ω is an open set containing &quot;K&quot;, every function which is bounded and holomorphic on the set Ω \ &quot;K&quot; has an analytic extension to all of Ω. By Riemann&#x27;s theorem for removable singularities, every singleton is removable. This motivated Painlevé to pose a more general question in 1880: &quot;Which subsets of C are removable?&quot;

It is easy to see that &quot;K&quot; is removable if and only if &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) = 0. However, analytic capacity is a purely complex-analytic concept, and much more work needs to be done in order to obtain a more geometric characterization.

==Ahlfors function==
For each compact &quot;K&quot; ⊂ C, there exists a unique extremal function, i.e. formula_11 such that formula_12, &quot;f&quot;(∞) = 0 and &quot;f′&quot;(∞) = &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;K&quot;). This function is called the Ahlfors function of &quot;K&quot;. Its existence can be proved by using a normal family argument involving Montel&#x27;s theorem.

==Analytic capacity in terms of Hausdorff dimension==
Let dim&quot;H&quot; denote Hausdorff dimension and &quot;H&quot;1 denote 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Then &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;K&quot;) = 0 implies &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) = 0 while dim&quot;H&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) &gt; 1 guarantees &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) &gt; 0. However, the case when dim&quot;H&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) = 1 and &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;K&quot;) ∈ (0, ∞] is more difficult.

===Positive length but zero analytic capacity===
Given the partial correspondence between the 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure of a compact subset of C and its analytic capacity, it might be conjectured that &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) = 0 implies &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;K&quot;) = 0. However, this conjecture is false. A counterexample was first given by A. G. Vitushkin, and a much simpler one by John B. Garnett in his 1970 paper. This latter example is the linear four corners Cantor set, constructed as follows:

Let &quot;K&quot;0 := [0, 1] × [0, 1] be the unit square. Then, &quot;K&quot;1 is the union of 4 squares of side length 1/4 and these squares are located in the corners of &quot;K&quot;0. In general, &quot;Kn&quot; is the union of 4&quot;n&quot; squares (denoted by formula_13) of side length 4−&quot;n&quot;, each formula_13 being in the corner of some formula_15. Take &quot;K&quot; to be the intersection of all &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot; then formula_16 but &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;K&quot;) = 0.

===Vitushkin&#x27;s conjecture===
Let &quot;K&quot; ⊂ C be a compact set. Vitushkin&#x27;s conjecture states that

:formula_17

where formula_18 denotes the orthogonal projection in direction θ. By the results described above, Vitushkin&#x27;s conjecture is true when dim&quot;H&quot;&quot;K&quot; ≠ 1.

Guy David published a proof in 1998 of Vitushkin&#x27;s conjecture for the case dim&quot;H&quot;&quot;K&quot; = 1 and &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;K&quot;) &lt; ∞. In 2002, Xavier Tolsa proved that analytic capacity is countably semiadditive. That is, there exists an absolute constant &quot;C&quot; &gt; 0 such that if &quot;K&quot; ⊂ C is a compact set and formula_19, where each &quot;K&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a Borel set, then formula_20.

David&#x27;s and Tolsa&#x27;s theorems together imply that Vitushkin&#x27;s conjecture is true when &quot;K&quot; is &quot;H&quot;1-sigma-finite.

In the non &quot;H&quot;1-sigma-finite case, Pertti Mattila proved in 1986 that the conjecture is false, but his proof did not specify which implication of the conjecture fails. Subsequent work by Jones and Muray produced an example of a set with zero Favard length and positive analytic capacity, explicitly disproving one of the directions of the conjecture. As of 2023 it is not known whether the other implication holds but some progress has been made towards a positive answer by Chang and Tolsa.

<text>Staats Island is an uninhabited island of the Beaver Island Group in the Falkland Islands. It lies between Beaver Island and Weddell Island, parallel to Tea Island and is in area.

==Wildlife==
The island is known for its Patagonian foxes and guanacos, both introduced species; the former is not to be confused with the closely related Falkland Islands fox now extinct. The introduction of guanaco has led to overgrazing of the tussac while the introduction of foxes has had a negative effect on the resident birds and there is an eradication programme to eliminate foxes from this and other islands in the Beaver Island Group

The guanaco population, from 15 animals introduced in 1938-39, rapidly grew to around 275 by 1956, when culling began in order to replace them with sheep. By the early 1960s, they had been reduced to around 10-20 animals. The population oscillated between a few hundred and a few dozen, with repeated culling; as of 2004, the population had risen back to around 400 animals. Other introduced species in the 1930s included a pair of lesser rheas (known to Falklanders as &quot;ostriches&quot;) and a number of Humboldt&#x27;s hog-nosed skunks; the rheas did not establish themselves, as their nests were raided by the foxes, but the skunks lasted until at least 1956.

Other wildlife on the island includes Magellanic penguins and other seabirds.

<doc id="727988" wikidata="Q4040290" url="?curid=727988" title="HP LaserJet">
<text>LaserJet is a line of laser printers sold by HP Inc. (originally Hewlett-Packard) since 1984. The LaserJet was the world&#x27;s first commercially successful laser printer. Canon supplies both mechanisms and cartridges for most HP laser printers; some larger A3 models use Samsung print engines.

These printers (and later on all-in-one units, including scanning and faxing) have, as of 2020, a three decade plus history of serving both in offices and at home for personal/at home use.

In 2013, Advertising Age reported that HP had &quot;78 different printers with 6 different model names.&quot;

==Technology==
Most HP LaserJet printers employ xerographic laser-marking engines sourced from the Japanese company Canon. Due to a tight turnaround schedule on the first LaserJet, HP elected to use the controller already developed by Canon for the CX engine in the first LaserJet. In spring of 1989 &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that HP &quot;dominates&quot; the PC laser printer market.

The first LaserJet and the first Apple LaserWriter used the same print engine, the Canon CX engine. HP chose to use their in-house developed Printer Command Language (PCL) as opposed to Apple, which adopted the PostScript language, as developed by Adobe Systems. The use of a less-ambitious and simpler Page description language allowed HP to deliver its LaserJet to the market about a year before Apple&#x27;s CX based product, and for $1000 less. The sharing of an identical Canon engine in two competing products continued with the LaserJet II/III and the Apple LaserWriter II, which both used the Canon LBP-SX print engine.

==History==

===1980s===
HP introduced the first laser printer for IBM PC compatible personal computers in May 1984 at the Computer Dealers&#x27; Exhibition (COMDEX). It was a 300-dpi, 8 ppm printer that sold for $3,495 with the price reduced to $2,995 in September 1985. It used an 8 MHz Motorola 68000 processor and could print in a variety of character fonts. It was controlled using PCL3. Due to the high cost of memory, the first LaserJet only had 128 kilobytes of memory, and a portion of that was reserved for use by the controller.

The LaserJet printer had high print quality, could print horizontally or vertically and produce graphics. It was ideal for printing memos, letters, and spreadsheets. It was quiet compared to other contemporary printers, hence people could use the telephone while sitting near the LaserJet.

The first LaserJet was a high-speed replacement for text-only daisy wheel impact printers and the noisy dot matrix printers. By using control codes it was possible to change the printed text style using font patterns stored in permanent ROM in the printer. Although unsupported by HP, because the Laserjet used the same basic PCL language (PCL Level III) spoken by HP&#x27;s other printers it was possible to use the Laserjet on HP 3000 multiuser systems.

The LaserJet Plus followed in September 1985, priced at US$3,995. It introduced &quot;soft fonts&quot;, treatments like bold and italic and other features including a parallel (Centronics) interface. It also included 512 kilobytes of memory, which was sufficient to print graphics at 300 dpi that covered about 70% of the letter-size page area.

* In March 1986 HP introduced the LaserJet D+, which included the LaserJet print engine and formatter but with two paper trays. The original MSRP was $4,495. In 1986, desktop publishing came to the world of IBM PCs and compatibles, after its origin on the Apple Macintosh and Apple LaserWriter. The LaserJet family, along with Aldus PageMaker and Microsoft Windows, was central to the PC-based solution and while the design was more plebeian than Apple&#x27;s product, this multi-vendor solution was available to a mass audience for the first time.
* HP introduced the mass-market laser printer, the LaserJet series II, in March 1987. The LaserJet II was designed as a laser printer with correct order page output as opposed to being leveraged from the Canon PC-20 personal copier. The LaserJet II used PCL4, improved features, more memory and fonts for a market price of $2,695.
* Also in March 1987, the LaserJet 2000 was launched. A high-end, networkable printer, the LaserJet 2000 offered a duty cycle of 70,000 pages per month and the standard 300-dpi output, initially priced at $19,995. In the same month, the company unveiled the ScanJet, their first image scanner. It allowed them to round out their portfolio of desktop publishing products and itself was very successful commercially.

The LaserJet IID was released in the fall of 1988, It was the first desktop laser printer capable of duplexing. It was also the first LaserJet with an HP-designed and manufactured formatter.

In September 1989, HP introduced the first &quot;personal&quot; version of the LaserJet printer series, the LaserJet IIP. Priced at US$1,495 by HP, and half the size and price of its predecessor, the LaserJet II, it offered 300-dpi output and 4 ppm printing with PCL 4 enhancements such as support for compressed bitmapped fonts and raster images. It was also the first no ozone print engine. Retailers predicted a street price of $1000 or less, making it the world&#x27;s first sub-$1,000 laser printer. The LaserJet IIP (and its very similar successor, the IIIP) were reliable.

Aftermarket replacement scanner assemblies remain available today. 

===1990s===
In March 1990 HP introduced the LaserJet III, priced at US$2,395, with two new features: Resolution Enhancement technology (REt), which dramatically increased print quality, and HP PCL 5. Thanks to PCL 5, text scaling became easy, and thus customers were no longer restricted to 10- and 12-point type sizes. This had a dramatic effect on word processing software market.

The LaserJet IIID was the same as the LaserJet III except it had 2 paper trays and duplex printing. It sold for $4,995 in the fall of 1990.

The first mass-market Ethernet network printer, the LaserJet IIISi, debuted in March 1991. Priced at $5,495, it featured a high-speed, 17 ppm engine, 5MB of memory, 300-dpi output, Image REt and such paper handling features as job stacking and optional duplex printing. The LaserJet IIISi also was HP&#x27;s first printer to offer onboard Adobe PostScript emulation as opposed to the font-cartridge solution offered on earlier models.

In October 1992, HP introduced the LaserJet 4 featuring a Canon EX engine with native 600-dpi output and Microfine toner for US$2,199. This model also introduced TrueType fonts to LaserJets which ensured that the printer fonts exactly matched the fonts displayed on the computer screen. (TrueType fonts could print on an original LaserJet Plus or later, but they would be printed as graphics, making the printing slow and restricted to a limited page area or reduced resolution.) Some competitors also utilized the Canon EX engine, including Apple (LaserWriter Pro 600 and 630), Digital Equipment Corporation (DEClaser 5100), and Canon.
By installing an HP JetDirect print server card, a LaserJet 4 / 4M printer could be connected to a network, for example as a departmental printer in companies instead of the larger III Si and 4 Si models.

In 2020 &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;by the 1990s, it was a staple of offices around the world.&quot; The flagship of the family was the LaserJet 4 SiMX, launched in May 1993. It had several network interfaces by default, both Ethernet, Appletalk and TokenRing. Instant-on fusing was introduced with the LaserJet 4L in the spring of 1993. It included a new low cost print engine. It sold for $1,229.

* In April 1994 HP shipped its 10-millionth LaserJet printer.
* In September 1994 HP introduced the Color LaserJet, the corporation&#x27;s first color laser printer. The printer had an average cost per page of less than 10 cents. The Color LaserJet offered 2 ppm color printing and 10 ppm for black text, 8MB of memory, 45 built-in fonts, a 1,250-sheet paper tray and enhanced PCL 5 with color. It was priced at $7,295.
* In March 1995 HP introduced the LaserJet 5 family of printers. They supported HP PCL 6, a printer-language which gave noticeably faster output – especially with complex, graphics-intensive documents. They also featured 600-dpi output with REt, and a 12 ppm engine. Prices started from $1,629. The models were updated next year.

The Color LaserJet 5 and 5M were introduced in March 1996, with 1200 dpi resolution. The LaserJet 6P and 6MP were introduced October 1996. They included infrared technology, for wireless printing.

In November 1996 HP introduced the network-ready LaserJet 5Si, a major revision and upgrade to the 3Si (IIISi) and 4Si, which had used the Canon NX engine. The 5Si, based on the Canon WX engine, could thus provide 11&quot;x17&quot; printing at an unprecedented 24 pages per minute and at 600 dpi with resolution enhancement. An internal duplexer enabled full-speed double-sided printing. Automatic personality switching (between PCL and PostScript), a feature that first appeared on the 4SiMX, was standard on the 5SiMX. The 5Si series were true workhorses, but initial production models were somewhat hobbled by a vulnerability to slightly low voltage (i.e. crashing if mains voltage was less than 120 Volts) as well as a weak clutch in Tray 3 (thus resulting in paper jamming for Tray 3 as well as the optional 2,000-sheet Tray 4), and also a weak solenoid in the manual feed tray (Tray 1). These paper-handling issues were easily dealt with, and many 5Si LaserJets remain in service today. The HP 5Si Mopier, a 5Si equipped with all available options, was marketed as the first network printer that was optimized to produce multiple original prints (mopies). It had a 100,000 copies-per-month duty cycle, and 24 ppm print speed.
In 1997, HP introduced the LaserJet 4000 family of printers. They included features from the LaserJet 5 plus higher resolution of 1200 dpi. These are mostly used in offices, and most recently in people&#x27;s homes mainly to replace the LaserJet 4/5 series if the user had them previously. In 1999, HP released the LaserJet 4050 series, which was identical to the HP 4000 but with a faster formatter and an easily accessible paper registration area (where the paper is stopped, registered, and then advanced for printing; a flip-up cover here made clearing of this component easier.) The 4000 series, as well as the 4050 and the 4100, used partly external duplexers.

The world&#x27;s first mass market all-in-one laser device, the LaserJet 4101 MFP, debuted in April 1998. Users could print, fax, copy, and scan with a single appliance. In July 1998 HP shipped its 30-millionth LaserJet printer.

In February 1999, HP introduced the LaserJet 2100 printer series 
– the world&#x27;s first personal laser printers in their class to offer high-quality 1200x1200-dpi resolution without significant performance loss.

In the network laser-printer market, the 5Si series was succeeded by the 8000, and later by the 8100 and 8150. The 8000 brought 1200x1200-dpi resolution, which was continued in the 8100 and 8150. The 8100 and 8150 brought faster printing (32 pages per minute), but this speed was only realized for single-sided (simplex) printing; double-sided printing remained at 24 pages per minute. These models, which used the Canon WX engine, provided durability and good maintainability.

===2000s===
In December 2000 HP shipped its 50-millionth LaserJet printer.

In September 2001 HP entered the low-end laser printer market with the introduction of the LaserJet 1000: the first sub-$250 LaserJet and the lowest-priced monochrome (black and white) LaserJet printer to date. It offered 10 ppm, an HP Instant-on fuser, 600 dpi with HP REt boosting output effectively to 1200 dpi, a 2.5-cent cost per page, and a 7,000-page monthly duty cycle.

In 2002, the 8150 was discontinued and was replaced by the 9000 series, which produced 50 pages per minute and used an internal duplexer. Meanwhile, the 4100 was replaced by the 4200 (later 4250) and 4300 (later 4350), which brought speeds of up to 55 pages per minute. In 2003 HP shipped its 75-millionth LaserJet printer.
In November 2003, HP entered the $24-billion copier market with the LaserJet 9055/9065/9085 MFPs(multifunction printers), a copier-based line of high-volume multifunction printers.

In 2006, total LaserJet sales had reached 100 million.

 HP has several lines of monochrome and color printers and multifunction products (copy, scan, and/or fax included) that range from 20 to 55 ppm and range in price from $149 to several thousand dollars.

===Evolution of control panel===

The 1992 LaserJet 4L marked the transition between a control panel evolved for an informed operator and one evolved for a casual user. The 4L&#x27;s predecessor, the IIIP, had an array of buttons and a cryptic numerical LCD. The 4L shipped with 4 LEDs, each with an icon to indicate a different condition, and a single pushbutton whose purpose varied depending on context (i.e. Hold down during printing, the printer will cancel the job. Hold down when off, the printer will power up and print a test page including total number of pages printed. A short press would provide a form feed or tell the printer to resume from a paper jam or out-of-paper condition. The actual application of the button was supposed to be far more intuitive than any possible written description – basically, the button tells the printer &quot;whatever you&#x27;re doing now, do the next most logical thing&quot;). This interface was supposed to be easier for new and casual users to understand and use, but it was also much less powerful, as in any case there is only one thing a user can make the printer do. Until the user becomes familiar with the printer&#x27;s behavior, they have to guess what that one thing is, or else consult the manual.

A 4L&#x27;s four status LEDs will also light in unusual patterns to indicate service requirements; for example, a lit error light and a lit ready light would indicate a fuser problem (usually just needs to be reseated – most 4L problems can be resolved by simply disassembling the printer, cleaning it, then reassembling it). This was much more cryptic than the alphanumeric display of earlier models like the II/IID III/IIID, IIP, and IIIP, as it was impossible to determine the meaning of the patterns of LEDs without comparing them against a manual (or having their meaning memorized, which some technicians exposed to them often might actually do, intentionally or not). The 4L used early light pipes, with surface-mounted LEDs on the control board on the left side of the printer, and plastic channels to conduct light from the lit status LEDs to the top of the printer. The LaserJet 4/4 Plus/4M/4M Plus retained an alphanumeric display, and in fact upgraded from the LCD displays of earlier models by using a 16-character alphanumeric dot-matrix vacuum fluorescent display. To this day, professional-grade LaserJets retain more comprehensive displays.

Before the 4L, the control panel typically had buttons with names like Online, Menu, Shift, Continue, Reset, +, -, and Form Feed. It also included status indicators like Online and Ready. Users without a technical background, especially those who had not used a printer before the late 1990s, might not understand these indicators, or might think they are conflicting or ambiguous. It may not be intuitive to new users that a printer that is ready but offline does not print, and while being able to take the printer off line (effectively disconnecting it from the computer) without shutting it down can be very useful, this distinction may appear as an extra complication to users who want to casually use the printer merely as an information appliance.

When a Windows PC controls a LaserJet, the &quot;Form Feed&quot; button seldom does anything when pressed. It has a small indicator light, and was usually used with very simple DOS programs that did not eject the last page after sending data to the printer, though it could also be useful to print the data in the printer&#x27;s memory if a program failed in the middle of sending a page to be printed. (In certain cases, this might be the only way to recover one&#x27;s data in the event of a system crash that occurred while printing.) The Form Feed button would print whatever was remaining in memory and prepare the printer to accept any new data as the start of a new page. For at least some LaserJet models, notably the LaserJet 4[M][Plus], the printer must be switched off-line before the Form Feed button will work. Most users of dot-matrix printers in the 1980s probably found the Online and Form Feed functions obvious, as most dot-matrix printers had these buttons and they worked similarly. The indicator on the Form Feed button illuminates when there is received data in the printer&#x27;s buffer; this makes it much easier to predict what will happen if the printer is put online and a new job is sent to it, or if sending of a job in progress is resumed.

Also, the &quot;Online&quot; button is actually a toggle switch, such that if the printer is already online, pressing Online makes the printer go offline and can be used to stop a runaway print job. Pressing Shift-Reset will then reset the printer, clearing the remainder of the unwanted document from the printer&#x27;s memory, so that it will not continue to print it when brought back on line. (Before resetting the printer, it is necessary to make the computer stop sending data for the print job to the printer, if it has not already finished sending that job, through the computer&#x27;s software. Otherwise, when the printer is put back online, it will start receiving the job from somewhere in the middle, which will likely cause the same runaway problem to recur.)

But by 1999 personal computers had embraced the Windows 95 era and many of the original manual control buttons like Form Feed were no longer necessary, because the Windows 95 print-spooler subsystem offered even simple Windows applications a much greater control over the printer than was available to DOS applications, which had to each independently rebuild and re-engineer basic printer management systems from scratch. This new Windows-oriented interface was highly intuitive and obvious to the casual user, who needed little familiarization with the printer to use it effectively.

Raw, unformatted, text-only support still exists, but the professional LaserJet printers keep it hidden away. Most professional LaserJet printers include a PCL menu where the number of copies, the font style, portrait or landscape printing, and the number of lines-per-page can be defined. These settings are ignored by graphical PCL/Postscript print drivers, and are only used for those rare situations where a LaserJet is used to emulate a lineprinter.

With the advent of the LaserJet 4000 in 1997, the control panel was completely redesigned. The Shift button, which might have been confusing, was gone. There was a Menu, an Item and a Value button. Each of these might be clicked left or right. There was a Select button, a large green Go button, and a small orange Cancel Job button. Configuration through the control panel was easier and more intuitive: menus could be navigated with the Menu button. Then, items within the menu selected with the Item button. The Value button – which had - (decrease) and + (increase) indications – could be used to select a specific setting or value. The Select button was used to select or confirm a particular choice. The display was adapted to a blue-backlit two-line LCD display.

Newer models such as the LaserJet 600 series now include a full color LCD display. Two directional arrow buttons and a Ok button replace the multiple menu navigation buttons of the 4000 series. A numeric keypad and other specialized buttons are also included for job storage, copy, and fax usage on models with those features.

==Models==
The model numbers do not necessarily have anything to do with the order of product development or the type of print-engine technology. For example, the LaserJet 1018 printer has newer, smaller, and more energy-efficient technology than the LaserJet 4000. The 1018 also features USB while the older 4000 does not.

===Model suffixes===
Printers with factory-installed options have different model-numbers to denote the different options included and to differentiate a specific model from others in its series. These suffixes include:

* D for a duplexer, enabling automatic double-sided printing.
* T for an additional paper-tray (enables two different paper types to be kept available, or in certain models, to load paper while the printer is printing). (Some D models, with no T suffix, had two trays built in, as did the LaserJet 500 Plus.)
* S for a Paper Stacker, a device which increases the output bin capacity.
* N for built-in, MIO or EIO slot JetDirect (network) card and usually also PostScript
* W for built-in wireless network card
* F for fax capability (multifunction units only)
* H for High-capacity (heavy-duty model, sometimes combined with M to indicate Heavy Media) or HP High-Performance Secure Hard Disk
* L for Light (only 1 paper tray)
* P for Personal, meant for &quot;personal or small workgroup&quot; use 
* ph+ for Paper handling (e.g. Stapler-stacker), or S/SL for stapler/stacker.
* M for Macintosh (PostScript module and Mini DIN-8 serial port present); also extra memory to support PostScript (as in 4M/4M Plus)
* V for 11-inch wide paper path, to support 8.5x11R and 11&quot;x17&quot; paper. (as in 4MV)
* X for combination duplexing, networkable printer with additional tray. Replaced the DTN suffix.
**Example: A LaserJet 4000&quot;X&quot; would come with a duplexer and a built in JetDirect card, as well as an extra paper tray.
* E previously stood for HP ePrint, now it stands for HP+ enabled models that require an internet connection and the HP Smart device app to work.

==Upgrading memory of older models==

Many older LaserJets and other HP printers (including LaserJet 4+, 4MV, 4MP, 4P, 5, 5M, 5MP, 5N, 5P, 5se, 5Si MOPIER, 5Si, 5Si NX, 6MP, 6P, 6Pse, 6Pxi, C3100A; DesignJet 330, 350C, 700, 750C, 750C Plus; DeskJet: 1600C, 1600CM, 1600CN; and PaintJet XL300) used proprietary 72-pin HP SIMMs for memory expansion. These are essentially industry-standard 72-bit SIMMs with non-standard Presence Detect (PD) connections. One can often adapt a standard 72-pin SIMM of appropriate capacity to support HP PD by soldering wires to pads, a simple task. HP printers of this type specify that RAM not faster than 70ns be used; this is probably due to a limitation of the PD decoding, and faster RAM can actually be used so long as the PD encoding indicates a speed of 70ns or slower. All printers will work with FPM (Fast Page Mode) memory; many, but not all, will work with EDO (Extended Data Out) memory.

Some even older models, such as the LaserJet II, IIP, IID, III, IIID, and 4/4M (i.e. not 4 Plus/4M Plus), used proprietary memory expansion boards. For example, the II and IID models used a roughly 4&quot; square memory expansion board populated with DIP DRAM chips and a two-row header connector (with pins on standard 0.1&quot; centers), while the 4/4M used 72 pin parity memory (and would fail to POST with non-parity memory). For the 4/4M (and the 4 Plus/4M Plus) memory modules of 4, 8, 16 and 32 MB were available.

==Vulnerabilities==
In November 2011, researchers at Columbia University announced the discovery of widespread vulnerabilities in LaserJet printers that allowed malicious firmware to be uploaded to the printers remotely. Using weaknesses in the printers&#x27; Web-based control interface, attackers could traverse the directory tree of an unpatched computer&#x27;s data storage, and then locate cached copies of otherwise restricted information, moments before or even after it has been printed. This information can then be forwarded to hackers for accumulation to facilitate harmful actions.

The malicious firmware could also be crafted to exfiltrate printout data over the network, to attack other computers on the network, or even to cause a printer to intentionally overheat. Security update patches were strongly urged by HP. As of late 2011, Computerworld stated that &quot;Millions of HP LaserJet printers&quot; still had &quot;a security weakness that could allow attackers to take control of&quot; their hardware.

In September 2015, HP added new features to its printers to address security vulnerabilities, releasing what they called the &quot;World&#x27;s Most Secure Printers&quot;.

==Repairs==
HP offers a standard one-year warranty on all of its LaserJet printers. Owners of its products can contact HP directly or any of its Authorized Service Providers to fulfill warranty service. After the first year an extended warranty can be purchased to continue coverage.
After 7 years has passed since a model has been discontinued, manufacturers are no longer obligated to produce new parts to repair printers. HP has generally continued to produce parts after this time to continue support for their LaserJet printers, but there are a number of models for which new parts are no longer available from the original manufacturer:
Mono: 1100, 1150, 1160, 1200, 1300, 1320, 2100, 2300, 3015, 3020, 3030, 3050, 3052, 3055, 3100, 3150, 3200, 3300, 3310, 3320, 3330, 3380, 3390, 4, 4+, 4000, 4050, 4100, 5, 5+, 5si, 5000, 5100, 6, 6L, 6P, 8150, 9000, M1522, M2727; 
Color: 1500, 1600, 2500, 2550, 2600, 2820, 2840, 3500, 3550, 3600, 3700, 3800, 4500, 4550, 4600, 4650, 8500, 8550, 9500, 9550, CM4730, CP3505. Third-party maintenance companies may have limited supplies of parts from their own stocks or from cannibalized equipment, but eventually recommend migrating to newer equipment.

<text>Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi (; 26 June 1930 – 22 November 2016) was a Pakistani American economist and civil servant who served as caretaker prime minister of Pakistan from July to October 1993. Qureshi also served as the senior vice president of World Bank.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Moeenuddin Ahmad Qureshi was born in Lahore, Punjab, British India, on 26 June 1930. He hailed from a distinguished family that was originally from Kasur. His father, Mohyeddin Ahmad Qureshi, was a civil servant in the British government and his mother, Khursheed Jabin, was a housewife. He attended the Islamia College in Lahore and made a transfer to the Government College University in Lahore where he gained B.A. (Honors) in Economics and received an M.A. in Economics from the Punjab University.

He received the Fulbright scholarship and went to the United States to attend the Indiana University Bloomington in Indiana, where he earned a PhD in Economics in 1955.

===Public service, IMF, and World Bank===
In 1955, he returned to Pakistan and joined the country&#x27;s civil service and was initially posted at the Planning Commission. In 1956, he resigned from the Planning Commission and went to the United States to join the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He enjoyed a distinguished career at the IMF, eventually serving as economic adviser to Ghana in 1960. Thereafter, he moved on to join the International Finance Corporation and eventually become its Executive Vice President from 1974 until 1977. Qureshi oversaw the global operations which involved the financing of private enterprises and investments, including joint ventures and capital market operations in developing countries.

In 1981, he was invited by the then President of the World Bank, Robert McNamara, to join the World Bank and become the senior vice president of finance, which he remained until 1987. Eventually, he was appointed the Senior Vice President of the World Bank and oversaw its financial operations all over the world. In 1991–92, he left the World Bank and settled in the United States and formed a private Hedge fund, the Emerging Market Associates.

===Acting Prime Minister of Pakistan===

In 1993, Pakistan averted a major constitutional crisis when both Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan resigned from their respective offices after an agreement brokered by the Pakistani military. The resolution was unique because an elected government had voluntarily stepped down in order to avoid possible military intervention and the resignations came through a constitutional process.

The Chief of Army Staff, General Abdul Waheed Kakar, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, General Shamim Alam, witnessed the implementation of the agreement as President Ghulam Ishaq was to be replaced by the Chairman of the Senate, Wasim Sajjad, who took over as the Acting President.

Meanwhile, Qureshi, who was visiting Singapore in 1993, received a telephone call from President Ghulam Ishaq asking him to form a caretaker, but technocratic, government. He reluctantly accepted the offer and returned to Islamabad soon after. At the time of his appointment, Qureshi was largely unknown to the public and political circles. It was, however, felt that, being a political outsider, he would remain neutral.

His tenure lasted for a three-month period but saw extensive reforms made by him that were supported by an IMF standby arrangement and significant World Bank lending. He initiated a process of &quot;payment culture&quot; that targeted the tax evaders and loan defaulters. He also ordered the publication of the list of taxpayers that showed that the country had a small tax base and only a few paid taxes. He devaluated the national currency and increased the prices on food and common items. He also inaugurated the National Library and highlighted its importance in the political culture of the country. Qureshi passed the decree that made the State bank of Pakistan an autonomous body with a view to keep the bank&#x27;s business operations free from political interference. He downsized the administrative machinery, and abolished the discretionary powers of the Prime Minister and the Chief Ministers which allowed them to a lot residential flats and plots to their &quot;favorites&quot;.

The state television, PTV, and Radio Pakistan were made independent and were given the opportunity to air elections freely and impartially. It goes to his credit that he undertook various endeavors in such a short period of time and made a serious effort to recover Government dues.

Despite his attempts to harmonize the economy, Qureshi&#x27;s main task was to hold nationwide general elections in 1993 to make way for an elected government to form the government. In 1993, he oversaw the general elections held that year that witnessed the return of the Pakistan Peoples Party led by Benazir Bhutto.

===Health and death===
In 2014, Qureshi was diagnosed with the Parkinson&#x27;s disease and reportedly underwent treatment for the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a local hospital.

On November 23, 2016, his family announced that Qureshi had died in Washington, D.C., following a long illness that he was undergoing treatment for in a local hospital. He had had a lung infection and buried in Washington D.C.

==Legacy==
===EMP Global and private sector===
After congratulating and witnessing Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s oath administered by the Acting President Wasim Sajjad alongside the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Qureshi returned to New York, United States, in 1993 to establish the private hedge fund equity, the EMP Global. Qureshi was involved in forging an affiliation with the international insurance company, American International Group (AIG), for a number of years. AIG held a minority stake in EMP and served as a sponsor of, as well as a major investor in, a number of funds bearing its name for which EMP served as Principal Adviser. EMP bought out AIG&#x27;s stake and became an independent company in 2005.

After his departure from Pakistan, Qureshi received criticism that, in his last days at the office, he made a large number of promotions and other administrative decisions in favor of his relatives. In 2014, his name was reportedly mentioned by Imran Khan when he led the Azadi March against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

===Personal life and wealth===
Qureshi was married to an American citizen, Lilo Elizabeth Richter, and has four children: two sons and two daughters. He enjoyed playing tennis and was reportedly a collector of classic cars and antiques. His mansion went on the market for $8 million in May 2016. It was purchased by President Donald Trump&#x27;s counselor Kellyanne Conway for $7.785 million.

<text>Hundun () is both a &quot;legendary faceless being&quot; in Chinese mythology and the &quot;primordial and central chaos&quot; in Chinese cosmogony, comparable with the world egg.

==Linguistics==
&quot;Hundun&quot; was semantically extended from a mythic &quot;primordial chaos; nebulous state of the universe before heaven and earth separated&quot; to mean &quot;unintelligible; chaotic; messy; mentally dense; innocent as a child&quot;.

While &quot;hùndùn&quot; &quot;primordial chaos&quot; is usually written as in contemporary vernacular, it is also written as —as in the Daoist classic &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;—or —as in the &quot;Zuozhuan&quot;. &quot;Hùn&quot; &quot;chaos; muddled; confused&quot; is written either &quot;hùn&quot; () or &quot;hún&quot; (). These two are interchangeable graphic variants read as &quot;hún&quot; ( ) and &quot;hùn&quot; &quot;nebulous; stupid&quot; (&quot;hùndùn&quot; ). &quot;Dùn&quot; (&quot;dull; confused&quot;) is written as either &quot;dùn&quot; () or &quot;dūn&quot; ().

Isabelle Robinet outlines the etymological origins of &quot;hundun&quot;.
Semantically, the term &quot;hundun&quot; is related to several expressions, hardly translatable in Western languages, that indicate the void or a barren and primal immensity – for instance, &quot;hunlun&quot; , &quot;hundong&quot; , &quot;kongdong&quot; , &quot;menghong&quot; , or &quot;hongyuan&quot; . It is also akin to the expression &quot;something confused and yet complete&quot; (&quot;huncheng&quot; ) found in the &quot;Daode jing&quot; 25, which denotes the state prior to the formation of the world where nothing is perceptible, but which nevertheless contains a cosmic seed. Similarly, the state of &quot;hundun&quot; is likened to an egg; in this usage, the term alludes to a complete world round and closed in itself, which is a receptacle like a cavern (&quot;dong&quot; ) or a gourd (&quot;hu&quot; or &quot;hulu&quot; ).
Most Chinese characters are written using &quot;radicals&quot; or &quot;semantic elements&quot; and &quot;phonetic elements&quot;. &quot;Hùndùn&quot; is written with the &quot;water radical&quot; or and phonetics of &quot;kūn&quot; and &quot;tún&quot; . &quot;Hùndùn&quot; &quot;primordial chaos&quot; is cognate with Wonton (&quot;húntun&quot;, ) &quot;wonton; dumpling soup&quot; written with the &quot;eat radical&quot; . Note that the English loanword &quot;wonton&quot; is borrowed from the Cantonese pronunciation &quot;wan4tan1&quot;. Victor H. Mair suggests a fundamental connection between &quot;hundun&quot; and &quot;wonton&quot;: &quot;The undifferentiated soup of primordial chaos. As it begins to differentiate, dumpling-blobs of matter coalesce. … With the evolution of human consciousness and reflectiveness, the soup was adopted as a suitable metaphor for chaos&quot;. This last assertion appears unsupported however, since wonton soup is not attested in Chinese sources dating earlier than the Han dynasty, although the linguistic connection of the soup to the larger concept certainly appears real.

&quot;Hundun&quot; has a graphic variant &quot;hunlun&quot; (using &quot;lún&quot; see the &quot;Liezi&quot; below), which etymologically connects to the mountain name Kunlun (differentiated with the &quot;mountain radical&quot; ). Robinet says &quot;Kunlun and &quot;hundun&quot; are the same closed center of the world.&quot;
Girardot quotes the Chinese philologist Lo Mengci , who says that reduplicated words like &quot;hundun&quot; &quot;suggest cyclic movement and transformation&quot;, and speculates:
Ritually mumbling the sounds of &quot;hun-tun&quot; might, therefore, be said to have a kind on incantatory significance that both phonetically and morphologically invokes the mythological and ontological idea of the Tao as the &quot;creatio continua&quot; process of infinitely repeated moments of change and new creation.

The &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; does not enter &quot;dun&quot; (which apparently lacked a pre-Han Seal script). It defines &quot;hun&quot; as &quot;fengliu&quot; &quot;abundantly flow&quot;, &quot;hun&quot; as the sound of &quot;hunliu&quot; &quot;abundantly-flowing flow&quot; or &quot;seemingly impure&quot;, &quot;dun&quot; as &quot;anger, rage; scolding&quot; or &quot;who&quot;, and &quot;lun&quot; as &quot;ripples; eddies&quot; or &quot;sink into; disappear&quot;.

English &quot;chaos&quot; is a better translation of &quot;hundun&quot; in the classical sense of &quot;Chaos&quot; or &quot;Khaos&quot; in Greek mythology meaning &quot;gaping void; formless primordial space preceding creation of the universe&quot; than in the common sense of &quot;disorder; confusion&quot;. The latter meaning of &quot;hundun&quot; is synonymous with Chinese &quot;luàn&quot; (). Their linguistic compound &quot;hùnluàn&quot; ( lit. &quot;chaos-chaos&quot;, meaning &quot;chaos; disorder; confusion) exemplifies the &quot;synonym compound&quot; category in Chinese morphology.

==Early textual usages==
In the Chinese written record, &quot;hundun&quot; first appears in classics dating from the Warring States period. The following summary divides them into Confucianist, Daoist, and other categories, and presents them in roughly chronological order, with the caveat that many early textual dates are uncertain.

===Confucian texts===
&quot;Hundun&quot; only occurs in one Confucian classic, the &quot;Zuo zhuan&quot; commentary to the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;. Most early Confucianist ancient texts (&quot;Lunyu&quot;, &quot;Book of Documents&quot;, &quot;I Ching&quot;, etc.) do not use &quot;hun&quot;, with four exceptions. One, the &quot;Mengzi&quot;, uses &quot;hun&quot; in its original meaning &quot;sound of flowing water&quot;. Mencius explains why Confucius praised water, &quot;There is a spring of water; how it gushes out!&quot;. The other three use &quot;hun&quot; as what Girardot calls &quot;a term of opprobrium and condemnation related to the suppression of the &quot;barbarians&quot; or the &quot;legendary rebels&quot;.&quot;

The &quot;Shijing&quot; (237) mentions Hunyi &quot;ancient Hunni tribe in Turan&quot;. When King Wen of Zhou opened up the roads, &quot;The hordes of the Keun [sic] disappeared, Startled and panting&quot;. The &quot;Chunqiu&quot; mentions the Luhun tribe of the Rong people, &quot;the Jung of Luh-hwăn&quot; The &quot;Zuozhuan&quot; commentary to the &quot;Chunqiu&quot; notes they were originally from western Gansu and forced into northern Henan.

Another &quot;Zuozhuan&quot; context refers to Hundun as a worthless son of the Yellow Emperor, one of the mythical &quot;Sixiong&quot; &quot;Four Fiends&quot; banished by Shun.
 The ancient emperor Hung [Hwang-te] had a descendant devoid of ability [and virtue]. He hid righteousness from himself, and was a villain at heart; he delighted in the practice of the worst vices; he was shameless and vile, obstinate, stupid, and unfriendly, cultivating only the intimacy of such as himself. All the people under heaven called him Chaos. … When Shun became Yaou&#x27;s minister, he received the nobles from the four quarters of the empire, and banished these four wicked ones, Chaos, Monster, Block, and Glutton, casting them out into the four distant regions, to meet the spite of the sprites and evil things.
The other &quot;fiends&quot; are Qiongqi , Taowu , and Taotie . Legge notes this passage &quot;is worthy of careful study in many respects.&quot;

Girardot contrasts these rare Confucian usages of &quot;hundun&quot; pejoratively suggesting the forces thwarting civilization, &quot;the &quot;birds and beasts,&quot; barbarian tribes, banished ministers, and legendary rebels)&quot; with the common Daoist usages in a &quot;paradise lost theme&quot;.

===Taoist texts===
&quot;Hundun&quot; commonly occurs in classics of philosophical Taoism. The &quot;Daodejing&quot; does not mention &quot;hundun&quot; but uses both &quot;hun&quot; graphic variants. One section uses &quot;hun&quot; &quot;bemuddle&quot;: &quot;The sage is self-effacing in his dealings with all under heaven, and bemuddles his mind for the sake of all under heaven&quot;. Three other sections use &quot;hun&quot; (): 
*&quot;These three cannot be fully fathomed, Therefore, They are bound together to make unity&quot;.
*&quot;plain, as an unhewn log, muddled, as turbid waters, expansive, as a broad valley&quot;
*&quot;There was something featureless yet complete, born before heaven and earth&quot;

The &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; (ca. 3rd-2nd centuries BCE) has a famous parable involving emperors &quot;Hundun&quot; , &quot;Shu&quot; (), and &quot;Hu&quot; (). Girardot cites Marcel Granet on Shu and Hu synonymously meaning &quot;suddenness; quickness&quot; and &quot;etymologically appear to be linked to the images of lightning and thunder, or analogously, flaming arrows.&quot; The &quot;Heavenly Questions&quot; chapter of the &quot;Chu Ci&quot; uses Shu and Hu as one name: &quot;Where are the hornless dragons which carry bears on their backs for sport? Where is the great serpent with nine heads and where is the Shu-Hu?&quot;
The emperor of the South Sea was called Shu [Brief], the emperor of the North Sea was called Hu [Sudden], and the emperor of the central region was called Hun-tun [Chaos]. Shu and Hu from time to time came together for a meeting in the territory of Hun-tun, and Hun-tun treated them very generously. Shu and Hu discussed how they could repay his kindness. &quot;All men,&quot; they said, &quot;have seven openings so they can see, hear, eat, and breathe. But Hun-tun alone doesn&#x27;t have any. Let&#x27;s trying boring him some!&quot; Every day they bored another hole, and on the seventh day Hun-tun died.
Compare Watson&#x27;s renderings of the three characters with other &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; translators.
*Change, Suddenness, Confusion (or Chaos) — Frederic H. Balfour 
*Shû, Hû, Chaos — James Legge 
*Change, Uncertainty, Primitivity — Yu-Lan Fung 
*Shu, Hu, Hun Tun — Herbert Giles 
*Immediately, Suddenly, Undifferentiation — James R. Ware 
*Light, Darkness, Primal Chaos — Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English 
*Fast, Furious, Hun-t&#x27;un — A.C. Graham 
*Lickety, Split, Wonton — Victor H. Mair
*Change, Dramatic, Chaos — Martin Palmer 
*Helter, Skelter, Chaos — Wang Rongpei

Two other &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; contexts use &quot;hundun&quot;. Chapter 11 has an allegory about Hong Meng &quot;Big Concealment&quot; or &quot;Silly Goose&quot;, who &quot;was amusing himself by slapping his thighs and hopping around like a sparrow&quot;, which Girardot interprets as shamanic dancing comparable with the &quot;Shanhaijing&quot; below. Hong Meng poetically reduplicates &quot;hunhun-dundun&quot; () in describing Daoist &quot;mind-nourishment&quot; meditation.
&quot;You have only to rest in inaction and things will transform themselves. Smash your form and body, spit out hearing and eyesight, forget you are a thing among other things, and you may join in great unity with the deep and boundless. Undo the mind, slough off spirit, be blank and soulless, and the ten thousand things one by one will return to the root – return to the root and not know why. Dark and undifferentiated chaos – to the end of life none will depart from it. But if you try to know it, you have already departed from it. Do not ask what its name is, do not try to observe its form. Things will live naturally and of themselves.&quot;
Chapter 12 tells a story about the Confucian disciple Zigong becoming dumbfounded after meeting a Daoist sage. He reported back to Confucius, who denigrated &quot;Hundun Shi zhi shu&quot; &quot;the arts of Mr. Chaos [Hundun]&quot;:
&quot;He is one of those bogus practitioners of the arts of Mr. Chaos. He knows the first thing but doesn&#x27;t understand the second. He looks after what is on the inside but doesn&#x27;t look after what is on the outside. A man of true brightness and purity who can enter into simplicity, who can return to the primitive through inaction, give body to his inborn nature, and embrace his spirit, and in this way wander through the everyday world – if you had met one like that, you would have had real cause for astonishment. As for the arts of Mr. Chaos, you and I need not bother to find out about them.&quot;

The &quot;Huainanzi&quot; has one occurrence of &quot;hundun&quot; in a cosmological description.
Heaven and earth were perfectly joined [&quot;tung-t&#x27;ung&quot; ], all was chaotically unformed [&quot;hun-tun wei p&#x27;u&quot; ]; and things were complete [&quot;ch&#x27;eng&quot; ] yet not created. This is called [the time or condition] of the Great One. [&quot;t&#x27;ai-i&quot; ]. All came from this unity which gave to each thing its differences: the birds, fish, and beasts. This is called the lot [or division, &quot;fen&quot; ] of things.
Three other &quot;Huainanzi&quot; chapters use &quot;hun&quot;, for example, the compound &quot;hunhun cangcang&quot; ()
The world was a unity without division into classes nor separation into orders (lit: a disorganised mass): the unaffectedness and homeliness of the natural heart had not, as yet, been corrupted: the spirit of the age was a unity, and all creation was in great affluence. Hence, if a man with the knowledge of I [ A mythical person of great powers] appeared, the world had no use for him.

The &quot;Liezi&quot; uses &quot;hunlun&quot; for &quot;hundun&quot;, which is described as the confused state in which &quot;qi&quot; &quot;pneuma; breath&quot;, &quot;xing&quot; &quot;form; shape&quot;, and &quot;zhi&quot; &quot;matter; substance&quot; have begun to exist but are still merged as one.
There was a Primal Simplicity, there was a Primal Commencement, there were Primal Beginnings, there was a Primal Material. The Primal Simplicity preceded the appearance of the breath. The Primal Beginnings were the breath beginning to assume shape. The Primal Material was the breath when it began to assume substance. Breath, shape and substance were complete, but things were not yet separated from each other; hence the name &quot;Confusion.&quot; &quot;Confusion&quot; means the myriad things were confounded and not yet separated from each other.

===Other texts===
The &quot;Shanhaijing&quot; collection of early myths and legends uses &quot;hundun&quot; as an adjective to describe a &quot;shen&quot; &quot;spirit; god&quot; on Tian Shan &quot;Heaven Mountain&quot;.
There is a god here who looks like a yellow sack. He is scarlet like cinnabar fire. He has six feet and four wings. He is Muddle Thick. He has no face and no eyes. He knows how to sing and dance. He is in truth the great god Long River.
In the above passage, 渾敦 is translated as &quot;Muddle Thick&quot;, and the name of the god (Di-Jiang) is translated as &quot;great god Long River&quot;. Toshihiko Izutsu suggests that singing and dancing here and in &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; refers to shamanic trance-inducing ceremonies, &quot;the monster is said to be a bird, which is most probably an indication that the shamanistic dancing here in question was some kind of feather dance in which the shaman was ritually ornamented with a feathered headdress.&quot;

The &quot;Shen yi jing&quot; &quot;Classic of Divine Wonders&quot; records a later variation of Hundun mythology. It describes him as a divine dog who lived on Mt. Kunlun, the mythical mountain at the center of the world.
It has eyes but can&#x27;t see, walks without moving; and has two ears but can&#x27;t hear. It has the knowledge of a man yet its belly is without the five internal organs and, although having a rectum, it doesn&#x27;t evacuate food. It punches virtuous men and stays with the non-virtuous. It is called. Hun-tun.

Quoting the Zuo zhuan, Hun-tun was Meng-shih&#x27;s untalented son. He always gnaws his tail, going round and round. Everyone ridiculed him.

A poem in the Tang dynasty collection Hanshan refers to the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; myth and reminisces about &quot;Hundun&quot;.
 How pleasant were our bodies in the days of Chaos, Needing neither to eat or piss! Who came along with his drill And bored us full of these nine holes? Morning after morning we must dress and eat; Year after year, fret over taxes. A thousand of us scrambling for a penny, We knock our heads together and yell for dear life.
Note the addition of two holes (anus and penis) to the original seven (eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth).

==Interpretations==
&quot;Hundun&quot; myths have a complex history, with many variations on the &quot;primordial chaos&quot; theme and associations with other legends.

The sociologist and historian Wolfram Eberhard analyzed the range of various &quot;hundun&quot; myths. He treated it as a world egg mythic &quot;chain&quot; from the southern Liao culture, which originated in the Sichuan and Hubei region.

# &quot;Hundun&quot; creation myths involving humanity being born from a &quot;thunder-egg&quot; or lump of flesh, the son of an emperor, the Thunder god represented as a dog with bat wings, localized with the Miao people and Tai peoples.
# &quot;The animal Lei&quot; &quot;is a creature like a lump, without head, eyes, hands, or feet. At midnight it produces noises like thunder.&quot;
# &quot;The hundun dumplings&quot;, etymologically connected with &quot;round&quot;, &quot;unorganized; chaotic&quot;, and perhaps the &quot;round mountain&quot; Kunlun.
# &quot;The world-system huntian&quot; in ancient Chinese astronomy conceptualized the universe as a round egg and the earth as a yolk swimming within it.
# &quot;The sack and the shooting of the god&quot; connects sack-like descriptions of &quot;hundun&quot;, perhaps with &quot;sack&quot; denoting &quot;testicles&quot;, legends about Shang dynasty king Wu Yi who lost a game of chess with the god Heaven and suspended a sack filled with blood and shot arrows at it, and later traditions of shooting at human dolls.
# &quot;Pangu&quot; is the mythological creator of the universe, also supposedly shaped like a sack, connected with dog mythologies, and who grew into a giant in order to separate Heaven and Earth. 
# &quot;Heaven and earth as marital partners&quot; within the world-egg refers to the theme of Sky father and Earth Mother goddess.
# &quot;Zhongli&quot; is identified with Zhu Rong &quot;god of fire&quot;, which is a mythology from the southern state Chu, with variations appearing as two gods Zhong and Li.
# &quot;Zhongli&quot; clan, which has variant writings, originated in the Ba (state), near present-day Anhui. 
# &quot;The brother-sister marriage&quot; is a complex of myths explaining the origins or mankind (or certain families), and their first child is usually a lump of flesh, which falls into pieces and populates the world. In later mythology, the brother Fu Xi and sister Nüwa, who lived on Mt. Kunlun, exemplify this marriage.

Norman J. Girardot, professor of Chinese religion at Lehigh University, has written articles and a definitive book on &quot;hundun&quot;. He summarizes this mythology as follows.

# The &quot;hun-tun&quot; theme in early Taoism represents an ensemble of mythic elements coming from different cultural and religious situations. 
# The symbolic coherence of the &quot;hun-tun&quot; theme in the Taoist texts basically reflects a creative reworking of a limited set of interrelated mythological typologies: especially the cosmic egg-gourd, the animal ancestor-cosmic giant, and primordial couple mythologies. The last two of these typologies are especially, although not exclusively, linked to what may be called the deluge cycle of mythology found primarily in southern local cultures.
# While there may also be a cultural connection between the southern deluge cycle and the cosmogonic scenario of the cosmic egg (i.e., via the &quot;thunder-egg,&quot; &quot;origin of ancestors [culture hero] from egg or gourd,&quot; and &quot;origin of agriculture and mankind from gourd&quot; myths), the fundamental linkage for all these typologies is the early Taoist, innovative perception of a shared symbolic intention that accounts for, and supports, a particular cosmogonic, metaphysical, and mystical vision of creation and life.

Interpretations of &quot;Hundun&quot; have expanded from &quot;primordial chaos&quot; into other realms. For instance, it is a keyword in &quot;Neidan&quot; &quot;Chinese internal alchemy&quot;. explains that &quot;Alchemists begin their work by &quot;opening&quot; or &quot;boring&quot; &quot;hundun&quot;; in other words, they begin from the Origin, infusing its transcendent element of precosmic light into the cosmos in order to reshape it.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In the 2013 film &quot;Pacific Rim&quot;, the second kaiju to make landfall was named Hundun, though only a brief glimpse of it is seen and it doesn&#x27;t have a major role in the plot. However, concept art of the film does show it with a rounded body akin to the mythological Hundun.

In the Marvel Cinematic Universe movie &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot;, the character Morris (vocal effects provided by Dee Bradley Baker) is a Hundun and acts as a companion of Trevor Slattery at the time when he was a jester for Wenwu. As Morris entered Ta Lo in a car with Shang-Chi, Xialing, Katy, and Trevor Slattery, he appeared excited to see other Hunduns and they waved their wings at each other.

A Hundun is featured as an optional final boss in the video game Spelunky 2. In the game, Hundun takes the form of a large egg with two legs, two wings, a snake head, a bird head, and a large eye in the center of the egg. Hundun&#x27;s interpretation in Spelunky 2 is comparable to a world egg, as his body contains the final and largest world of the game.

<text>Chaos () is the mythological void state preceding the creation of the universe (the cosmos) in ancient near eastern cosmology and early Greek cosmology. It can also refer to an early state of the cosmos constituted of nothing but undifferentiated and indistinguishable matter.

==Etymology==
Greek &quot;kháos&quot; () means &#x27;emptiness, vast void, chasm, abyss&#x27;, related to the verbs &quot;kháskō&quot; () and &quot;khaínō&quot; () &#x27;gape, be wide open&#x27;, from Proto-Indo-European &quot;&quot;, cognate to Old English &quot;geanian&quot;, &#x27;to gape&#x27;, whence English &quot;yawn&quot;.

It may also mean space, the expanse of air, the nether abyss, or infinite darkness. Pherecydes of Syros (fl. 6th century BC) interprets &quot;chaos&quot; as water, like something formless that can be differentiated.

 (; ), also described as a &quot;combat myth&quot;, is generally used to refer to a widespread mythological motif involving battle between a culture hero deity with a chaos monster, often in the form of a sea serpent or dragon. The term was first used with respect to the destruction of the chaos dragon Tiamat in the Enūma Eliš, although it has been observed that the primeval state is one of a peaceful existence between Abzu and Tiamat and chaos only ensues when Tiamat enters combat with Marduk.

Today, the &#x27; concept is plagued by a lack of consistent definition and use of the term across many studies. Nicolas Wyatt defines the &#x27; category as follows:

The &quot;&quot; myth is a category of divine combat narratives with cosmogonic overtones, though at times turned secondarily to other purposes, in which the hero god vanquishes a power or powers opposed to him, which generally dwell in, or are identified with, the sea, and are presented as chaotic, dissolutory forces.

It may also be used to refer to a dualistic battle between two gods; in that context, an alternative term that has been proposed is &quot;theomachy&quot; whereas &#x27; may be restrained to refer to cosmic battles in the context of creation. For example, a &#x27; may be found in the Enuma Elish (the only ancient near eastern text to place a cosmic battle in the context of a creation narrative), but not in the Baal Cycle or Psalm 74 where a theomachy ensues between Baal/Yahweh and the sea serpent Yam/Leviathan without being followed by creation. The notion of &quot;&quot; may be further distinguished from a divine battle between a god and the enemy of his people.

Parallel concepts appear in the Middle East and North Africa, such as the abstract conflict of ideas in the Egyptian duality of Maat and Isfet or the battle of Horus and Set, or the more concrete parallel of the battle of Ra with the chaos serpent Apophis.
==Greco-Roman tradition==

Hesiod and the Pre-Socratics use the Greek term in the context of cosmogony. Hesiod&#x27;s Chaos has been interpreted as either &quot;the gaping void above the Earth created when Earth and Sky are separated from their primordial unity&quot; or &quot;the gaping space below the Earth on which Earth rests&quot;. Passages in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; suggest that Chaos was located below Earth but above Tartarus. Primal Chaos was sometimes said to be the true foundation of reality, particularly by philosophers such as Heraclitus.

===Cosmology in early Greece===
In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Chaos was the first thing to exist: &quot;at first Chaos came to be&quot; (or was), but next (possibly out of Chaos) came Gaia, Tartarus, and Eros (elsewhere the name Eros is used for a son of Aphrodite). Unambiguously &quot;born&quot; from Chaos were Erebus and Nyx. For Hesiod, Chaos, like Tartarus, though personified enough to have borne children, was also a place, far away, underground and &quot;gloomy&quot;, beyond which lived the Titans; and, like the earth, the ocean, and the upper air, it was also capable of being affected by Zeus&#x27;s thunderbolts.

The notion of the temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality. The main object of the first efforts to explain the world remained the description of its growth, from a beginning. They believed that the world arose out from a primal unity, and that this substance was the permanent base of all its being. Anaximander claims that the origin is apeiron (the unlimited), a divine and perpetual substance less definite than the common elements (water, air, fire, and earth) as they were understood to the early Greek philosophers. Everything is generated from &quot;apeiron&quot;, and must return there according to necessity. A conception of the nature of the world was that the earth below its surface stretches down indefinitely and has its roots on or above Tartarus, the lower part of the underworld. In a phrase of Xenophanes, &quot;The upper limit of the earth borders on air, near our feet. The lower limit reaches down to the &quot;apeiron&quot; (i.e. the unlimited).&quot; The sources and limits of the earth, the sea, the sky, Tartarus, and all things are located in a great windy-gap, which seems to be infinite, and is a later specification of &quot;chaos&quot;.

===Classical Greece===
In Aristophanes&#x27;s comedy &quot;Birds&quot;, first there was Chaos, Night, Erebus, and Tartarus, from Night came Eros, and from Eros and Chaos came the race of birds.

In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus,&quot; the main work of Platonic cosmology, the concept of chaos finds its equivalent in the Greek expression &quot;chôra&quot;, which is interpreted, for instance, as shapeless space (&quot;chôra&quot;) in which material traces (&quot;ichnê&quot;) of the elements are in disordered motion (Timaeus 53a–b). However, the Platonic &quot;chôra&quot; is not a variation of the atomistic interpretation of the origin of the world, as is made clear by Plato&#x27;s statement that the most appropriate definition of the chôra is &quot;a receptacle of all becoming – its wetnurse, as it were&quot; (Timaeus 49a), notabene a receptacle for the creative act of the demiurge, the world-maker.

Aristotle, in the context of his investigation of the concept of space in physics, &quot;problematizes the interpretation of Hesiod&#x27;s chaos as &#x27;void&#x27; or &#x27;place without anything in it&#x27;. Aristotle understands chaos as something that exists independently of bodies and without which no perceptible bodies can exist. &#x27;Chaos&#x27; is thus brought within the framework of an explicitly physical investigation. It has now outgrown the mythological understanding to a great extent and, in Aristotle&#x27;s work, serves above all to challenge the atomists who assert the existence of empty space.&quot;

===Roman tradition===
For Ovid, (43 BC – 17/18 AD), in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Chaos was an unformed mass, where all the elements were jumbled up together in a &quot;shapeless heap&quot;.

According to Hyginus: &quot;From Mist (&quot;Caligo&quot;) came Chaos. From Chaos and Mist, came Night (&quot;Nox&quot;), Day (&quot;Dies&quot;), Darkness (&quot;Erebus&quot;), and Aether.&quot; An Orphic tradition apparently had Chaos as the son of Chronus and Ananke.

==Biblical tradition==
Since the classic 1895 German work &quot;Schöpfung und Chaos in Urzeit und Endzeit&quot; by Hermann Gunkel, various historians in the field of modern biblical studies have associated the theme of chaos in the earlier Babylonian cosmology (and now other cognate narratives from ancient near eastern cosmologies) with the Genesis creation narrative. Besides Genesis, other books of the Old Testament, especially several Psalms, some passages in Isaiah and Jeremiah and the Book of Job are relevant.

One locus of focus has been with respect to the term &quot;abyss&quot; / &quot;tohu wa-bohu&quot; in Genesis 1:2. The term may refer to a state of non-being before creation or to a formless state. In the Book of Genesis, the spirit of God is moving upon the face of the waters, displacing the earlier state of the universe that is likened to a &quot;watery chaos&quot; upon which there is &quot;choshek&quot; (which translated from the Hebrew is darkness/confusion). Some scholars, however, reject the association between biblical creation and notions of chaos from Babylonian and other (such as Chinese) myths. The basis is that the terms themselves in Genesis 1:2 are not semantically related to chaos, and that the entire cosmos exists in a state of chaos in Babylonian, Chinese, and other myths, whereas at most this can be said of the earth in Genesis. The presence of &quot;Chaoskampf&quot; in the biblical tradition is now contentious.

The Septuagint makes no use of in the context of creation, instead using the term for , &quot;cleft, gorge, chasm&quot;, in Micah 1:6 and Zachariah 14:4. The Vulgate, however, renders the χάσμα μέγα or &quot;great gulf&quot; between heaven and hell in Luke 16:26 as &quot;chaos magnum&quot;.

This model of a primordial state of matter has been opposed by the Church Fathers from the 2nd century, who posited a creation &quot;ex nihilo&quot; by an omnipotent God.

==Hawaiian tradition==
In Hawaiian folklore, a triad of deities known as the &quot;Ku-Kaua-Kahi&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Fundamental Supreme Unity&quot;) were said to have existed before and during Chaos ever since eternity, or put in Hawaiian terms, &quot;mai ka po mai&quot;, meaning &quot;from the time of night, darkness, Chaos&quot;. They eventually broke the surrounding &quot;Po&quot; (&quot;night&quot;), and light entered the universe. Next the group created three heavens for dwelling areas together with the Earth, Sun, Moon, stars, and assistant spirits.

==Gnosticism==
According to the Gnostic &quot;On the Origin of the World&quot;, Chaos was not the first thing to exist. When the nature of the immortal aeons was completed, Sophia desired something like the light which first existed to come into being. Her desire appears as a likeness with incomprehensible greatness that covers the heavenly universe, diminishing its inner darkness while a shadow appears on the outside which causes Chaos to be formed. From Chaos, every deity including the Demiurge is born.

==Alchemy and Hermeticism==

The Greco-Roman tradition of &quot;prima materia&quot;, notably including the 5th- and 6th-century Orphic cosmogony, was merged with biblical notions (&quot;Tehom&quot;) in Christianity and inherited by alchemy and Renaissance magic.

The cosmic egg of Orphism was taken as the raw material for the alchemical magnum opus in early Greek alchemy. The first stage of the process of producing the philosopher&#x27;s stone, i.e., nigredo, was identified with chaos. Because of association with the Genesis creation narrative, where &quot;the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters&quot; (Gen. 1:2), Chaos was further identified with the classical element of Water.

Ramon Llull (1232–1315) wrote a &quot;Liber Chaos&quot;, in which he identifies Chaos as the primal form or matter created by God. Swiss alchemist Paracelsus (1493–1541) uses &quot;chaos&quot; synonymously with &quot;classical element&quot; (because the primeval chaos is imagined as a formless congestion of all elements). Paracelsus thus identifies Earth as &quot;the chaos of the &quot;gnomi&quot;&quot;, i.e., the element of the gnomes, through which these spirits move unobstructed as fish do through water, or birds through air. An alchemical treatise by Heinrich Khunrath, printed in Frankfurt in 1708, was entitled &quot;Chaos&quot;. The 1708 introduction states that the treatise was written in 1597 in Magdeburg, in the author&#x27;s 23rd year of practicing alchemy. The treatise purports to quote Paracelsus on the point that &quot;[t]he light of the soul, by the will of the Triune God, made all earthly things appear from the primal Chaos&quot;. Martin Ruland the Younger, in his 1612 &quot;Lexicon Alchemiae&quot;, states, &quot;A crude mixture of matter or another name for &quot;Materia Prima&quot; is &quot;Chaos&quot;, as it is in the Beginning.&quot;

The term &quot;gas&quot; in chemistry was coined by Dutch chemist Jan Baptist van Helmont in the 17th century directly based on the Paracelsian notion of chaos. The &quot;g&quot; in &quot;gas&quot; is due to the Dutch pronunciation of this letter as a spirant, also employed to pronounce Greek χ.

==Modern usage==
The term &quot;chaos&quot; has been adopted in modern comparative mythology and religious studies as referring to the primordial state before creation, strictly combining two separate notions of primordial waters or a primordial darkness from which a new order emerges and a primordial state as a merging of opposites, such as heaven and earth, which must be separated by a creator deity in an act of cosmogony. In both cases, chaos referring to a notion of a primordial state contains the cosmos &quot;in potentia&quot; but needs to be formed by a demiurge before the world can begin its existence.

The use of &quot;chaos&quot; in the derived sense of &quot;complete disorder or confusion&quot; first appears in Elizabethan Early Modern English, originally implying satirical exaggeration. &quot;Chaos&quot; in the well-defined sense of chaotic complex system is in turn derived from this usage.

<text>Juan Facundo Quiroga (27 November 1788 – 16 February 1835) was an Argentine caudillo (military strongman) who supported federalism at the time when the country was still in formation.

==Early years==
Quiroga was born in San Antonio, La Rioja, the son of a traditional but impoverished Riojan family of cattle breeders descended from the Visigothic king Reccared I. Quiroga was sent at a young age to San Juan to be educated. Early in his life, he became a problem child, and escaped from school. During wanderings in the desert between San Juan and La Rioja, he purportedly encountered and killed a cougar, earning him the nickname &quot;El Tigre de los Llanos&quot; (&quot;the Tiger of the Plains&quot;, after the &quot;Llanos&quot;, the region of his birth).

After the May Revolution proclaimed the self-rule of the country, Quiroga tried to enter the independentist army. He travelled to San Luis to enter the &quot;Granaderos a Caballo&quot; Regiment, led by General José de San Martín. He was imprisoned and eventually expelled due to his bad temper.

He moved back to La Rioja and became a businessman until 1820. That year the central government of Buenos Aires fell, and the province became autonomous.

==Governor of La Rioja and federalist leader==

Quiroga entered the provincial army and quickly rose to its command, gaining control of the government through his charisma. During the time of the Constitutional Congress of 1824, Quiroga led its forces through the Andean provinces to oppose the centralist tendencies of President Bernardino Rivadavia and the officers of the National Army, which were carrying away a compulsory levy for the upcoming Cisplatine War (1825–1827). 

Advised by monarchist priest Pedro Ignacio de Castro Barros, Quiroga declared a religious war on Buenos Aires under the flag of &quot;Religión o Muerte&quot; (Religion or Death) as a reaction to various anti-clerical laws passed by the president which aimed at creating a regalist national church independent from Rome, promoted the expropriation of clerical properties by the state, suppressed religious orders and granted religious tolerance to minorities. He overthrew the centralist governor of San Juan shortly after the central government signed a series of treatises with Great Britain by which religious freedom was enforced and La Rioja mines were given in usufruct to British enterprises. A devout catholic who would quote the Bible from memory, Quiroga considered Rivadavia a &quot;persecutor of the Church&quot; and joined federalist rebels who would later overthrow the national government.

After the Cisplatine war, the officers of the returning army (of centralist tendencies, known as &quot;unitarios&quot;) deposed the federalist governments in an attempt to restore the centralised rule of Buenos Aires. General José María Paz took over its province of Córdoba and his officers campaigned through the interior provinces. Quiroga tried to oppose them, but without success, and after defeat in the Battle of La Tablada, he went into self-imposed exile in Buenos Aires. From there, where the coup was quickly defeated, Quiroga led an army towards Córdoba but was defeated in the Battle of Oncativo by Paz&#x27;s more disciplined forces. Quiroga decided not to give up and tried a more ambitious attempt, marching through territories still occupied by native aboriginals, in order to bypass Córdoba, and attack directly Mendoza, where it succeeded. He took his campaign north along the Andean provinces, until he finally defeated General Gregorio Aráoz de Lamadrid, who led the last remaining unitary forces, in Salta.

After the war, Quiroga established himself as one of the leaders of federalism in Argentina (along with Juan Manuel de Rosas and the caudillo of Santa Fe, Estanislao López), although he declared in his correspondence with Rosas that his ideas were in fact unitarian, but that he became a champion of federalism because people wanted federalism.

== Quiroga&#x27;s Religion ==
For most of the first years as a powerful caudillo, Facundo Quiroga had very little to say about his own personal religion, hoping to stay out of the conflict over control of the masses between Catholicism and the emerging Argentine government. In 1826, however, this shifted as one of Quiroga&#x27;s key motives in his intervention in the civil wars was to come to the defense of Catholicism. He announced that he desired to stop the attacks on &quot;the Catholic Apostolic Roman Religion, which our lord Jesus Christ constructed at the cost of much bitterness.&quot; While it remains mostly unclear what Quiroga&#x27;s personal beliefs were, he publicly supported the Catholic faith hoping to move the church&#x27;s support to the Federalist side in the wars against the Unitarians. 

==Quiroga&#x27;s death and its consequences==

In 1834, Quiroga was appointed by the governor of Buenos Aires (and Representative of Foreign Relations of the Argentine Confederation) Manuel Vicente Maza to mediate between the governors of Tucumán and Salta, but Salta governor De la Torre died before Quiroga could arrive. He was advised that there were plans to murder him on his way back, but Quiroga, disregarding the advice, returned to Buenos Aires through the same way. At Barranca Yaco, a watering place between Córdoba and Santiago del Estero, a party of gunmen ambushed the carriage in which he travelled. Quiroga, confident in his charisma and that his mere presence and resolution would discourage the attackers, appeared through the carriage door and shouted at the gunmen, asking for their commander to confront him. The leader of the party, Santos Pérez, however, did not take chances and killed Quiroga by shooting him through the left eye.

The political crime created a huge crisis in all the Confederation, forcing Maza to resign, and led to the establishment of Rosas&#x27; government. Rosas, as the Confederation leader, led the criminal investigation that ended with the prosecution of the governor of Córdoba, José Vicente Reinafé, and his brother as the intellectual perpetrators of the crime. They were hanged along with Santos Pérez in 1837 in Buenos Aires.

After Facundo&#x27;s death, the execution of his will revealed that he never seized nor inherited any wealth or property from his father. Instead, Ariel De La Fuente states in his 2000 book, &quot;Children of Facundo&quot;, that he: &quot;accumulated his fortune during eighteen years of married life, a period that coincides, almost exactly, with his entire political career (1818-1835).&quot;. In addition, Facundo&#x27;s family would inherit his properties in Buenos Aries, and all in all, his fortune would total to be around 200,000 pesos. This mass sum is attributed almost entirely as a result of his political career and not from his lifestyle as a caudillo rancher.

In 1845, Domingo F. Sarmiento wrote &quot;Facundo, Civilization and Barbarism&quot;, a book that reviews the influence of &quot;caudillo&quot; leaders, which he defines as &quot;barbarism&quot;, in the Argentine political and social life, but also as a protest to Rosas&#x27; regime, and a call for European education and life style. Sarmiento’s &quot;Facundo&quot; was also expanded upon in a book titled &quot;Children of Facundo: Caudillo and Gaucho Insurgency During the Argentine State-Formation Process (La Rioja, 1853-1870)&quot;, written by Ariel de la Fuente. De la Fuente argues that the struggles in La Rioja encompassed more than the upper-class divisions between Unitarian and Federalist, and he suggests viewing the conflicts from the perspective of the lower-class gauchos to see these differences. 
&quot;Children of Facundo&quot; further depicts Facundo as a complex leader. His relationship with the gauchos was presented as a double-edged sword, where the gauchos are responsible for the caudillo&#x27;s notoriety, and the caudillo (Facundo) is responsible for the gauchos&#x27; supply of necessities. 

Quiroga is buried in La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires.
== In literature ==
Jorge Luis Borges wrote an imaginary dialogue between Quiroga and Rosas in &quot;Dead Men&#x27;s Dialogue&quot;, in &quot;Dreamtigers&quot;.

<doc id="728008" wikidata="Q5943523" url="?curid=728008" title="Hungry Hungry Hippos">
<text>Hungry Hungry Hippos (or Hungry Hippos in some UK editions) is a tabletop game made for 2–4 players, produced by Hasbro, under the brand of its subsidiary, Milton Bradley. The idea for the game was published in 1967 by toy inventor Fred Kroll and it was introduced in 1978. The objective is for each player to collect as many marbles as possible with their toy hippopotamus model. The game was, at one point, marketed under the &quot;Elefun and Friends&quot; banner, along with Elefun, Mouse Trap and Gator Golf.

== Gameplay ==

The game board is surrounded by four colorful plastic mechanical hippopotamuses operated by levers on their backs. When the lever is pressed, the hippo opens its mouth and extends its head forwards on a telescopic neck. When the lever is released, the head comes down and retracts. Plastic marbles are dispensed into the board by each player, and the players repeatedly press the lever on their hippo in order to have it &quot;eat&quot; the marbles, which travel down from under the hippo into a small scoring area for each player. Once all marbles have been captured, the player who has collected the most is the winner.

==Advertising==
The original late-&#x27;70s and &#x27;80s television advertisements for the game featured a memorable jingle:

: &quot;If you wanna win the game you&#x27;ve gotta take good aim&quot;
: &quot;And get the most marbles with your hippo&quot;
: &quot;Playin&#x27; Hungry Hungry Hippos&quot;
: &quot;Hungry Hungry Hippos&quot;

The 1990s-era advertisements featured a series of brightly colored cartoon hippos dancing in a conga line and singing, &quot;Hungry Hungry Hip-&quot;pos&quot;!&quot; to the beat:

: &quot;It&#x27;s a race, it&#x27;s a chase, hurry up and feed their face!&quot;
: &quot;Who will win? No one knows! Feed the hungry hip-ip-pos!&quot;
: &quot;Hungry hungry hippos! (open up and there it goes!)&quot;

In 2009, the song in the commercial was the &quot;Elefun and Friends&quot; theme song.

==Video games==
In 1991, Innovative Concepts in Entertainment (ICE) created a redemption arcade version of the game, a supersized resemblance of the board game version. The amount of marbles consumed was displayed at the top of the dome for each player. The more marbles a hippo consumed, the more tickets that hippo&#x27;s player received.

The previous year, Sinclair User published a game called &quot;Piggy Punks&quot;, written by Hellenic Software for the ZX Spectrum, which was inspired by the board game. The game showed an overhead view of a board with four pigs, each controlled by a separate player, in place of the four hippos.

Recently, another arcade game was released in the style of the 2012 edition. The hippos themselves are rideable, and their heads are controlled by big levers with handlebars.

==Film adaptation==
In 2012, film studio Emmett/Furla Films announced that they were working on an animated film adaptation of &quot;Hungry Hungry Hippos&quot;, along with Monopoly and Action Man. The movie&#x27;s plot and other details were being kept secret. Production was originally scheduled to start in early 2016, but the film entered development hell. 

==Tournaments==
Rogue Judges, a volunteer judging group at Gen Con, ran a &quot;1st Annual Hungry Hungry Hippos World Championship&quot; in August 2015 and have continued to hold one every year since at the Indiana Convention Center.

A Hungry Hungry Hippos Tournament was also hosted at Smash the Record 2017.

==In popular culture==

The game has been referenced in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (1992), &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (2001), &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010), &quot;My Little Pony: The Movie&quot; (2017), &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot; (2017), &quot;Safe Havens&quot; (2018), &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Space Force&quot; (2020), &quot;The Afterparty&quot; (2022), and Monday Night Football (2024-10-07). There is also a battle level based on the game in the 2016 &quot;Micro Machines&quot; game. Mike Ehrmantraut loses a round of the game against his granddaughter, Kaylee, in &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;.

<text>Akhenaten, Dweller in Truth is a novel written and published by Nobel Prize-winning Egyptian author Naguib Mahfouz in 1985. It was translated from Arabic into English in 1998 by Tagreid Abu-Hassabo.

The form and subject of the book is the basis for a cello concerto of the same title by Mohammed Fairouz.

==Plot summary==

On the way from Sais to Panopolis with his father, the scribe Meriamun points out the ruins of Akhetaten, the city that the &quot;heretic pharaoh&quot; Akhenaten built for his One and Only God. Seeking a balanced perspective on the events of that time, which split Egypt politically and religiously, Meriamun gets a letter of introduction from his father to many members of Akhenaten&#x27;s court, among them the High Priest of Amun, his chief of security Haremhab, and his queen Nefertiti. Each tale adds a new dimension to the enigma that is Akhenaten and the thoughts of those that were close to him allow Meriamun – and the reader – to judge for themselves whether Akhenaten was a power politician or a true believer.

<text>&lt;/math&gt;
 | vertex_config = formula_1
 | dual = Associahedron formula_2

The triaugmented triangular prism, in geometry, is a convex polyhedron with 14 equilateral triangles as its faces. It can be constructed from a triangular prism by attaching equilateral square pyramids to each of its three square faces. The same shape is also called the tetrakis triangular prism, tricapped trigonal prism, tetracaidecadeltahedron, or tetrakaidecadeltahedron; these last names mean a polyhedron with 14 triangular faces. It is an example of a deltahedron, composite polyhedron, and Johnson solid.

The edges and vertices of the triaugmented triangular prism form a maximal planar graph with 9 vertices and 21 edges, called the Fritsch graph. It was used by Rudolf and Gerda Fritsch to show that Alfred Kempe&#x27;s attempted proof of the four color theorem was incorrect. The Fritsch graph is one of only six graphs in which every neighborhood is a 4- or 5-vertex cycle.

The dual polyhedron of the triaugmented triangular prism is an associahedron, a polyhedron with four quadrilateral faces and six pentagons whose vertices represent the 14 triangulations of a regular hexagon. In the same way, the nine vertices of the triaugmented triangular prism represent the nine diagonals of a hexagon, with two vertices connected by an edge when the corresponding two diagonals do not cross. Other applications of the triaugmented triangular prism appear in chemistry as the basis for the tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry, and in mathematical optimization as a solution to the Thomson problem and Tammes problem.

==Construction==

The triaugmented triangular prism is a composite polyhedron, meaning it can be constructed by attaching equilateral square pyramids to each of the three square faces of a triangular prism, a process called augmentation. These pyramids cover each square, replacing it with four equilateral triangles, so that the resulting polyhedron has 14 equilateral triangles as its faces. A polyhedron with only equilateral triangles as faces is called a deltahedron. There are only eight different convex deltahedra, one of which is the triaugmented triangular prism. More generally, the convex polyhedra in which all faces are regular polygons are called the Johnson solids, and every convex deltahedron is a Johnson solid. The triaugmented triangular prism is numbered among the Johnson solids 

One possible system of Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a triaugmented triangular prism, giving it edge length 2, is:
formula_3

==Properties==
A triaugmented triangular prism with edge length formula_4 has surface area
formula_5
the area of 14 equilateral triangles. Its volume,
formula_6
can be derived by slicing it into a central prism and three square pyramids, and adding their volumes.

It has the same three-dimensional symmetry group as the triangular prism, the dihedral group formula_7 of order twelve. Its dihedral angles can be calculated by adding the angles of the component pyramids and prism. The prism itself has square-triangle dihedral angles formula_8 and square-square angles formula_9. The triangle-triangle angles on the pyramid are the same as in the regular octahedron, and the square-triangle angles are half that. Therefore, for the triaugmented triangular prism, the dihedral angles incident to the degree-four vertices, on the edges of the prism triangles, and on the square-to-square prism edges are, respectively,
formula_10

== Fritsch graph ==

The graph of the triaugmented triangular prism has 9 vertices and 21 edges. It was used by as a small counterexample to Alfred Kempe&#x27;s false proof of the four color theorem using Kempe chains, and its dual map was used as their book&#x27;s cover illustration. Therefore, this graph has subsequently been named the Fritsch graph. An even smaller counterexample, called the Soifer graph, is obtained by removing one edge from the Fritsch graph (the bottom edge in the illustration here).

The Fritsch graph is one of only six connected graphs in which the neighborhood of every vertex is a cycle of length four or five. More generally, when every vertex in a graph has a cycle of length at least four as its neighborhood, the triangles of the graph automatically link up to form a topological surface called a Whitney triangulation. These six graphs come from the six Whitney triangulations that, when their triangles are equilateral, have positive angular defect at every vertex. This makes them a combinatorial analogue of the positively curved smooth surfaces. They come from six of the eight deltahedra—excluding the two that have a vertex with a triangular neighborhood. As well as the Fritsch graph, the other five are the graphs of the regular octahedron, regular icosahedron, pentagonal bipyramid, snub disphenoid, and gyroelongated square bipyramid.

==Dual associahedron==

The dual polyhedron of the triaugmented triangular prism has a face for each vertex of the triaugmented triangular prism, and a vertex for each face. It is an enneahedron (that is, a nine-sided polyhedron) that can be realized with three non-adjacent square faces, and six more faces that are congruent irregular pentagons. It is also known as an order-5 associahedron, a polyhedron whose vertices represent the 14 triangulations of a regular hexagon. A less-symmetric form of this dual polyhedron, obtained by slicing a truncated octahedron into four congruent quarters by two planes that perpendicularly bisect two parallel families of its edges, is a space-filling polyhedron.

More generally, when a polytope is the dual of an associahedron, its boundary (a simplicial complex of triangles, tetrahedra, or higher-dimensional simplices) is called a &quot;cluster complex&quot;. In the case of the triaugmented triangular prism, it is a cluster complex of type formula_11, associated with the formula_11 Dynkin diagram , the formula_11 root system, and the formula_11 cluster algebra. The connection with the associahedron provides a correspondence between the nine vertices of the triaugmented triangular prism and the nine diagonals of a hexagon. The edges of the triaugmented triangular prism correspond to pairs of diagonals that do not cross, and the triangular faces of the triaugmented triangular prism correspond to the triangulations of the hexagon (consisting of three non-crossing diagonals). The triangulations of other regular polygons correspond to polytopes in the same way, with dimension equal to the number of sides of the polygon minus three.

==Applications==
In the geometry of chemical compounds, it is common to visualize an atom cluster surrounding a central atom as a polyhedron—the convex hull of the surrounding atoms&#x27; locations. The tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry describes clusters for which this polyhedron is a triaugmented triangular prism, although not necessarily one with equilateral triangle faces. For example, the lanthanides from lanthanum to dysprosium dissolve in water to form cations surrounded by nine water molecules arranged as a triaugmented triangular prism.

In the Thomson problem, concerning the minimum-energy configuration of formula_15 charged particles on a sphere, and for the Tammes problem of constructing a spherical code maximizing the smallest distance among the points, the minimum solution known for formula_16 places the points at the vertices of a triaugmented triangular prism with non-equilateral faces, inscribed in a sphere. This configuration is proven optimal for the Tammes problem, but a rigorous solution to this instance of the Thomson problem is not known.

<text>Edward McKay Cheever Jr. (born January 10, 1958) is an American former racing driver who raced for almost 30 years in Formula One, sports cars, CART, and the Indy Racing League. Cheever participated in 143 Formula One World Championship races and started 132, more than any other American, driving for nine different teams from 1978 through 1989. In 1996, he formed his own IRL team, Team Cheever, and won the 1998 Indianapolis 500 as both owner and driver. The team later competed in sports cars.

His younger brother Ross Cheever, nephew Richard Antinucci and son Eddie Cheever III also became racing drivers.

==Early life==
Though born in Phoenix, Arizona, Cheever lived in Rome, Italy, as a child and attended St. George&#x27;s British International School and later The New School of Rome. He was introduced to motorsports at age eight when his father took him to a sports car race in Monza. He soon began racing go-karts and won both the Italian and European Karting Championships at age 15. He worked his way up through the levels of European Formula racing, teaming with fellow American Danny Sullivan in Formula Three in 1975. He scored a significant win against Gunnar Nilsson and Rupert Keegan at the end of 1975 and then driving for Ron Dennis&#x27; Project Four team in Formula Two in 1976, 1977, and 1978, finishing runner-up to René Arnoux in the 1977 championship. By the end of 1977, he was considered the most promising driver in the world outside F1, scoring wins in 1977 in F2 at Nurburgring and Rouen.

==Formula One==
Cheever first entered Formula One in , shortly after his 20th birthday. After failing to qualify for the first two races of the year in Argentina and Brazil in a Theodore, he made the grid in South Africa in a Hesketh, but retired early. He then concentrated on Formula Two for the rest of 1978 and 1979.

For the 1979 F2 championship, Cheever left Project Four and joined the Italian Osella team, taking three wins and fourth overall in their BMW-powered FA2. In Osella moved up to Formula One, Cheever piloting the team&#x27;s Cosworth-powered FA1. However, the car was unreliable and Cheever managed just one finish all year, twelfth place at the team&#x27;s home race in Italy. Switching teams repeatedly as he tried to climb his way up the grid, Cheever had five points-scoring finishes for the Tyrrell team in , and three podiums for Ligier the following year, including a second-place at the 1982 Detroit Grand Prix.

The season proved to be Cheever&#x27;s high point in Formula One. He signed with the factory Equipe Renault team alongside Frenchman Alain Prost, both of whom were among the year&#x27;s Championship favorites. Cheever earned four more podiums and 22 Championship points driving the Renault RE30C for the first two races before driving its much better replacement, the RE40, for the remainder of the season. But the team&#x27;s disappointment after losing both the Drivers&#x27; (Prost) and Constructors&#x27; titles late in the season brought about the replacement of both Cheever and Prost. His best finish for Renault was second in the Canadian Grand Prix at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, while earlier in the season he achieved his highest career qualifying position when he was second to teammate Prost at the French Grand Prix at the Paul Ricard Circuit. Unconfirmed rumors had Renault signing Cheever as the French manufacturer was looking to sell more cars in North America, and having an American driver in the factory-backed Formula One team would help that cause (there were three F1 races in North America in 1983 – Long Beach, Detroit and Canada).
In six more seasons, he never drove another truly competitive F1 car. After leaving Renault, Cheever had two unsuccessful seasons with Alfa Romeo as a teammate to Italian Riccardo Patrese. The thirsty and underpowered 890T V8 turbo engine used in the Alfas generally saw results few and far between, though it was generally believed Cheever outperformed his teammate despite failing to qualify for the 1984 Monaco Grand Prix. Patrese, though, scored the only podium finish for the team in those two years when he finished third in the 1984 Italian Grand Prix. Cheever had been third with six laps remaining but his Alfa ran out of fuel, handing the place to Patrese (the team had set Cheever&#x27;s 890T engine for speed while setting Patrese for an economy run in the hope of a good finish). was not helped by the team&#x27;s car, the Alfa Romeo 185T, which proved to be extremely uncompetitive, forcing the team to upgrade its car, the 184T to 1985 specifications and use it for the last half of the season, though the old car did not improve results despite proving slightly faster as the fuel issue remained. Late in the 1985 season, Alfa announced they were pulling out of F1 at the end of the year, leaving Cheever without an F1 drive, while Patrese went back to Brabham in place of Nelson Piquet, who was moving to Williams.While racing in the World Sportscar Championship for Tom Walkinshaw Racing&#x27;s Jaguar team, Cheever raced in only one F1 Grand Prix in . This was for the American owned and sponsored Haas Lola team at Detroit, as a replacement for the injured Patrick Tambay. Cheever actually qualified the unfamiliar Lola THL2 with its turbocharged Ford V6 engine in tenth position. Regular team driver, World Champion Alan Jones, could only qualify his car 21st. Both Lolas retired with steering damage in the race, Jones on lap 33, Cheever 4 laps later. Cheever was only the third choice to replace Tambay for the race. Team owner Carl Haas had originally asked the lead driver in his CART team, World Champion Mario Andretti to drive. Mario declined however but recommended his son Michael as a replacement. However, when Michael was unable to obtain a FIA Superlicence for the race, Haas turned to the experienced Cheever, who quickly agreed to an F1 comeback.

For , he was signed by Arrows team boss Jackie Oliver to partner British driver Derek Warwick (Cheever&#x27;s appointment coincided with the U.S.-based USF&amp;G financial group becoming the team&#x27;s major sponsor). Cheever and Warwick (who had been teammates at TWR the previous year) were evenly matched and would have many on-track battles throughout 1987 and . He secured third place at the 1988 Italian Grand Prix at Monza; at one stage, he was almost disqualified when his Arrows A10B&#x27;s 150-liter fuel tank was found to actually contain 151 liters. Luckily, further examination revealed the tank size to be 149 liters and his third-place stood. The podium cost him a new pair of sunglasses for the chief mechanic. Monza, won by the Ferrari of Gerhard Berger, was the only time the McLaren-Hondas of Alain Prost and 1988 World Champion Ayrton Senna did not win a race in 1988. Cheever&#x27;s third place in the 1988 Italian Grand Prix was also the final podium for the turbocharged I4 BMW M12 engine (badged as &quot;Megatron&quot; in 1987 and 1988). At the time, it was the oldest turbo engine in use in Formula One, having been first used by the Brabham team in 1982.

His final podium finish came at the 1989 United States Grand Prix in his birthplace of Phoenix, where he was involved in a race-long battle with the Williams-Renault of former Alfa Romeo teammate Riccardo Patrese for second place, but then had to give way at the later stages of the race when his brakes started to fade (he claimed that one of his front brakes had actually stopped working). Cheever&#x27;s last race in Formula One was at the very wet 1989 Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide. During the last seconds of qualifying, he got out of shape coming out of the Fosters Hairpin onto the pit straight and clouted the wall hard with his Arrows A11-Ford, destroying the rear of the car. In the race he was the last to retire, spinning off on lap 42 after driving for many laps with another car&#x27;s front wing lodged in his Arrows&#x27; sidepod.

During his final season in Formula One, Cheever remained competitive (when he finished, his average finishing place was seventh), but he became increasingly bemused by his inability to qualify well (his average qualifying position was 23rd, compared to Warwick&#x27;s 14th). His best qualifying position for the season with 16th in both Canada and Hungary, and he even failed to qualify for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone and the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, where he had finished third the previous year.

In all, he participated in 143 Grands Prix, achieved nine podiums, and scored a total of 70 championship points. His best year was 1983, when he finished seventh in the championship, scored three podium finishes and one front row start for Renault.

==CART==
From 1986 to 1988, while still driving in Formula One, Cheever won ten sports car races for Jaguar. In 1990 he moved to the US to drive for Chip Ganassi Racing in the CART series. In his first attempt at the Indianapolis 500, he finished eighth and was named the race&#x27;s Rookie of the Year, as well as CART&#x27;s Rookie of the Year. In 1992, he qualified second for the race and finished fourth. In total, he scored four podium finishes in the series but never won. Driving for A. J. Foyt&#x27;s team, Cheever came closest to victory at Nazareth in 1995: he was leading the race on the last lap when he ran out of fuel. In the Indy 500, Cheever was involved in a nasty lap 1 crash with Stan Fox, Carlos Guerrero and Lyn St. James. Fox was severely injured in the crash.

==Indianapolis 500 and Indy Racing League==

In 1996 the Indy Racing League began, and Cheever moved there from CART. Cheever ran for Team Menard for the three-race series, and at the 1996 Indianapolis 500, he set the fastest race lap to date at . Cheever then set up his own team and had his first race as a driver/owner at New Hampshire later that year in August, which was the first race of the next season.

In 1998, all the pieces came together for Cheever when he took the biggest win of his career. He started from 17th position and led 76 of 200 laps to win the 82nd Indianapolis 500, despite sliding in the first turn of the race&#x27;s first lap, helping bring out the race&#x27;s first caution period. He was the first owner/driver to win the race since A. J. Foyt (one of Cheever&#x27;s former bosses) in 1977.

Cheever&#x27;s IRL team, active until July 2006, ran cars for Alex Barron and Patrick Carpentier in 2005. Having hung up his helmet in 2002, except for occasional instances such as the 2006 24 Hours of Daytona where he competed in the first race with his new Grand-Am series team, Eddie announced on February 21, 2006, he would come out of retirement to run his own car in the IRL&#x27;s first four races, including the Indianapolis 500. He shut his team down after the eighth race of the season due to lack of sponsorship. The team continued to compete in the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series.

Cheever provided television commentary on ABC for the IndyCar Series and the Indianapolis 500 from 2008 to 2018 with Allen Bestwick and Scott Goodyear, a former three-time runner-up in the Indy 500 who also drove for Team Cheever in 2001.

==GP Masters==

In 2005 Cheever competed in the GP Masters series which is open to former Formula One drivers over the age of 45. In the championship&#x27;s first-ever event at Kyalami International Raceway in South Africa, Cheever finished in eighth position. Cheever finished fourth in the second GP Masters race on April 29, 2006, at the Losail International Circuit in Qatar.

In the third GP Masters race on August 13, 2006, at the Silverstone Circuit in England, he took the victory under wet track conditions.

== Personal life ==
Cheever shares a daughter and a son, driver Eddie Cheever III, with ex-wife Rita Cheever. He has a son from his previous relationship with Heather Handley. In 2013, Cheever married his wife, Dianna, and their daughter was born later that same year.

<text>Jeremy Harris (born December 7, 1950) is an American politician who served as The 11th Mayor of Honolulu, Hawaii from 1994 to 2005. A biologist by training, Harris started his political career as a delegate to the 1978 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention. While Harris served as chief executive of the City &amp; County of Honolulu, the city was named &quot;America&#x27;s Greatest City&quot; by the official American governance journal, &quot;Governing Magazine&quot;. Harris is the founder of the China-U.S. Conference of Mayors and Business Leaders and the Japan-American Conference of Mayors and Chamber of Commerce Presidents. He lives in Kalihi Valley on the island of O&#x27;ahu.

==Early years==

Born and raised in Wilmington, Delaware, Harris moved to Honolulu to study at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, where he obtained dual undergraduate degrees in related biology fields. Upon graduation, Harris went on to the University of California at Irvine, where he obtained his master&#x27;s degree in population and environmental biology, specializing in urban ecosystems. He returned to Hawaii and settled on the island of Kauai, where he was a professor at Kauai Community College and marine advisor with the University of Hawaii Sea Grant Program.

==Political career==

Harris was elected by his fellow Kauai residents to serve as their delegate to the 1978 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention. The convention of 1978 came to be recognized as one of the most important events in Hawaii history as from its body of delegates, many would become future &quot;giants of Hawaii politics&quot; as the media would later recall. Harris debated alongside John D. Waihee III, future governor of Hawaii, as well as future legislative leaders Carol Fukunaga, Helene Hale, Les Ihara, Jr., Barbara Marumoto and Joseph M. Souki.

In 1979, Harris was elected to the Kauai County Council where he served a single two-year term. In 1984, he joined the City &amp; County of Honolulu as executive assistant to Mayor Frank F. Fasi. He was soon promoted to deputy managing director and then managing director. In 1994, Fasi resigned as mayor of Honolulu and in the line of succession, Harris assumed the office.

==Mayor of Honolulu==

Harris won a special election to become mayor of Honolulu outright in September 1994. He was re-elected in 1996 and 2000, appealing mostly to Chinese American, Filipino American and Japanese American communities. During his tenure, Honolulu residents voted to limit mayors to two four-year terms and thus made Harris ineligible for re-election in 2004. Former members of the Honolulu City Council Duke Bainum and Mufi Hannemann and former mayor Frank F. Fasi ran to succeed Harris, with Hannemann ultimately the victor.

Harris is recognized as having executed the most complete government system overhaul in Honolulu history. He reorganized all municipal departments mostly by mergers to streamline all services provided by the city and county. He also curtailed urban sprawl by reforming the system of land use planning to preserve open spaces and agricultural districts. Particularly during his first term, his management skills and those of his chief assistants were marginal and millions of dollars were embezzled or wasted as a result.

Harris&#x27;s most ambitious and controversial project was 21st Century Oahu: A Shared Vision for the Future. 21st Century Oahu is a community based visioning program where neighborhoods would be given some control and CIP funding priority over their own community development, urban planning and beautification projects. Hundreds of public safety, environment, transportation, cultural and recreation construction projects were initiated and many completed as an outgrowth of Harris&#x27;s 21st Century Oahu project.

Harris was considered a favorite to win the 2002 race for governor of Hawaii. However, high-level Democratic Party insiders who had backed fellow Democrats against Harris in 1994, 1996 and 2000 did not want to relinquish the governorship and party leadership to this independent-minded Democrat, and thus fought against his candidacy, beginning with a public campaign demanding Harris resign as mayor if he intended to run for governor. In the spring of 2002, local news media reported allegations of campaign finance wrongdoing by some of Harris&#x27;s staffers. Despite polling close to presumptive Republican nominee Linda Lingle, Harris bowed out of the gubernatorial race. Hawaii Democratic leaders then backed incumbent Lieutenant Governor Mazie Hirono, a favorite of Sen. Daniel Inouye, for the nomination instead.

==Legacy==

He built the Marine Education Center at the Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve, continued the Waikiki Revitalization project started by Mayor Fasi that changed the look of Waikiki&#x27;s main thoroughfares, Queen&#x27;s Surf Beach, Kuhio Beach and Kapiolani Park Bandstand, established torchlighting ceremonies and hula performances every night at Waikiki, and started Brunch on the Beach. However, critics of Harris, including his successor Mufi Hannemann, contend that these programs came at the expense of basic city services and infrastructure.

Harris has the distinction of being the only mayor to be elected more than once as United States Public Administrator of the Year by the American Society of Public Administration. Twice, Honolulu&#x27;s &quot;The Bus&quot; was honored as America&#x27;s best transportation system. Other foremost national societies named Honolulu first on the list of Kid Friendly Cities as well as the most digitally and technologically advanced city in the United States.

Harris made waves on the international stage as the founder of the Mayors&#x27; Asia-Pacific Environmental Summit. Delegates in 1999, who included over 400 leaders from the Asia-Pacific Rim nations, voted to establish a permanent secretariat in Honolulu in Harris&#x27;s honor. Harris also established the Pacific Islands Environmental Symposium, the China-U.S. Conference of Mayors and Business Leaders, the Asia Pacific Urban Technology Institute and the Japan-American Conference of Mayors and Chamber of Commerce Presidents.

==Personal life==

Harris met Ramona Sachiko Akui while they were both working for the City and County of Honolulu, and they married in June 1989. They divorced in 2008.

<text>Fernando Quijano (1805–1871) was a Uruguayan actor and songwriter.

== Noted achievements ==

He was the assistant of composer Francisco José Debali.

=== Uruguayan National Anthem ===
Quijano was credited with the authorship of the Uruguayan national anthem. This came about through the governmental decree that adopted Debali&#x27;s composition as such in 1848.

== Death and reputation ==

Quijano&#x27;s death in 1871 came 12 years after the death of his more eminent fellow- composer Debali, with whom he collaborated, but, given the facts that he lived longer than Debali in the young Oriental Republic of Uruguay and that Debali spoke little Spanish, these factors served to enhance his reputation.

 | dual = pentagonal prism
 | angle = As a Johnson solid: 
 | properties = convex,&lt;br&gt;composite,&lt;br&gt;face-transitive
The pentagonal bipyramid (or pentagonal dipyramid) is a polyhedron with ten triangular faces. It is constructed by attaching two pentagonal pyramids to each of their bases. If the triangular faces are equilateral, the pentagonal bipyramid is an example of deltahedra, composite polyhedron, and Johnson solid.

The pentagonal bipyramid may be represented as four-connected well-covered graph. This polyhedron may be used in the chemical compound as the description of an atom cluster known as pentagonal bipyramidal molecular geometry, as a solution in Thomson problem, as well as in decahedral nanoparticles.

== Special cases ==
=== As a right bipyramid ===
Like other bipyramids, the pentagonal bipyramid can be constructed by attaching the base of two pentagonal pyramids. These pyramids cover their pentagonal base, such that the resulting polyhedron has ten triangles as its faces, fifteen edges, and seven vertices. The pentagonal bipyramid is said to be right if the pyramids are symmetrically regular and both of their apices are on the line passing through the base&#x27;s center; otherwise, it is oblique.

Like other right bipyramids, the pentagonal bipyramid has three-dimensional symmetry group of dihedral group formula_2 of order twenty: the appearance is symmetrical by rotating around the axis of symmetry that passing through apices and base&#x27;s center vertically, and it has mirror symmetry relative to any bisector of the base; it is also symmetrical by reflecting it across a horizontal plane. Therefore, the pentagonal bipyramid is face-transitive or isohedral.

The pentagonal bipyramid is four-connected, meaning that it takes the removal of four vertices to disconnect the remaining vertices. It is one of only four four-connected simplicial well-covered polyhedra, meaning that all of the maximal independent sets of its vertices have the same size. The other three polyhedra with this property are the regular octahedron, the snub disphenoid, and an irregular polyhedron with 12 vertices and 20 triangular faces.

The dual polyhedron of a pentagonal bipyramid is the pentagonal prism. More generally, the dual polyhedron of every bipyramid is the prism, and the vice versa is true. The pentagonal prism has two pentagonal faces at the base, and the rest are five rectangular.

=== As a Johnson solid ===
If the pyramids are regular, all edges of the triangular bipyramid are equal in length, making up the faces equilateral triangles. A polyhedron with only equilateral triangles as faces is called a deltahedron. There are only eight different convex deltahedra, one of which is the pentagonal bipyramid with regular faces. More generally, the convex polyhedron in which all faces are regular is the Johnson solid, and every convex deltahedra is a Johnson solid. The pentagonal bipyramid with the regular faces is among the numbered Johnson solids as formula_3, the thirteenth Johnson solid. It is an example of a composite polyhedron because it is constructed by attaching two regular pentagonal pyramids.

A pentagonal bipyramid&#x27;s surface area formula_4 is 10 times that of all triangles, and its volume formula_5 can be ascertained by slicing it into two pentagonal pyramids and adding their volume. In the case of edge length formula_6, they are:
formula_7

The dihedral angle of a pentagonal bipyramid with regular faces can be calculated by adding the angle of pentagonal pyramids:
* the dihedral angle of a pentagonal bipyramid between two adjacent triangles is that of a pentagonal pyramid, approximately 138.2°, and
* the dihedral angle of a pentagonal bipyramid with regular faces between two adjacent triangular faces, on the edge where two pyramids are attached, is 74.8°, obtained by summing the dihedral angle of a pentagonal pyramid between the triangular face and the base.

== Applications ==
In the geometry of chemical compounds, the pentagonal bipyramid can be used as the atom cluster surrounding an atom. The pentagonal bipyramidal molecular geometry describes clusters for which this polyhedron is a pentagonal bipyramid. An example of such a cluster is iodine heptafluoride in the gas phase.

The Thomson problem concerns the minimum-energy configuration of charged particles on a sphere. One of them is a pentagonal bipyramid, a known solution for the case of seven electrons, by placing vertices of a pentagonal bipyramid inscribed in a sphere.

Pentagonal bipyramids and related five-fold shapes are found in decahedral nanoparticles, which can also be macroscopic in size when they are also called fiveling cyclic twins in mineralogy.

<text>El Salvador is divided into 14 departments (Spanish: &quot;departamentos&quot;) for administrative purposes, subdivided into 44 municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;) and 262 districts. The country is a unitary state.

== History ==

June 12, 1824: The first Salvadoran constitution within the Federal Republic of Central America establishes a territorial division of four departments, Sonsonate, San Salvador, San Vicente, and San Miguel. Sonsonate was formerly part of Guatemala before this point.

1833-1834: A short lived Department of Tejutla was established from the districts of Metapan and Tejutla in San Salvador.

January 22, 1835: The Federal District of San Salvador is separated both from San Salvador department and from the State of Salvador. The remainder of San Salvador department is renamed to Cuscatlan, and Metapan district is transferred to Sonsonate department.

May 17, 1839: Cuscatlan&#x27;s Olocuitla district and San Vicente&#x27;s Zacatecoluca district are combined into the new department of La Paz.

July 30, 1839: The Federal District of San Salvador is dissolved, and San Salvador department is reconstituted, combining the former federal district with Opico district of Cuscatlan.

March 15, 1847: La Paz department is abolished and reincorporated into San Vicente.

February 21, 1852: La Paz department is restored.

February 8, 1855: Santa Ana department is separated from Sonsonate.

February 14, 1855: Chaltenango department is separated from Cuscatlan.

January 26, 1865: La Libertad department is separated from San Salvador.

June 22, 1865: Usulutan and La Union departments are separated from San Miguel.

February 12, 1869: Ahuachapan department is separated from Santa Ana.

February 10, 1873: Cabañas department is created from parts of Cuscatlan and San Vicente.

July 14, 1875: Gotera department is separated from San Miguel. It would be renamed to Morazan department on March 14, 1887.

<text>James Henry Quello (April 21, 1914 – January 24, 2010) was a broadcaster and government official who notably served as acting Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1993. Described as a &quot;conservative Democrat&quot;, Quello was first appointed to the FCC by Republican president Richard Nixon. Quello&#x27;s term as acting chairman ended when Reed Hundt was confirmed by the Senate, and he stepped down from the FCC entirely in 1998. 

Quello was a World War II veteran during the European conflict in 1941–1945 and was a friend of President Gerald Ford. At the time of his death he was the chairman of James H. Quello and Mary B. Quello Center for Telecommunication Management and Law at Michigan State University which was named in honor of the former commissioner and his wife. Up until his death Quello was also working as a consultant in the Government Affairs law office of Wiley Rein.

== Early life, education and marriage ==

Quello hailed from Laurium, Michigan, in the Upper Peninsula (often called &quot;U.P.&quot;), where his parents settled after immigrating from northern Italy; he also had a sister, Alice, who later settled in Pennsylvania. Quello, along with his future wife Mary (who died in October 1999), were undergraduate students at Michigan State University in the 1930s. James graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree and he and Mary were married September 14, 1937. In 1998, Michigan State University honored both with the creation of the James H. Quello and Mary B. Quello Center for Telecommunication Management and Law. James served on the Board of the Center and was also affiliated with Wiley Rein, a prominent Washington, D.C. law firm. In addition to numerous awards for his public service, Quello received awards and honorary degrees from Northern Michigan University and Michigan State University.

== World War II ==
During World War II, Quello served as a lieutenant and lieutenant colonel in the United States Army (1941–45). He took part in six infantry amphibious assault landings in the war theater in Europe and Africa and fought in Africa, Sicily, Italy, France, and Germany. Quello earned several decorations and campaign ribbons and served as a trustee of the Michigan Veterans Trust Fund, having been appointed in turn by four different governors of Michigan. He is the author of &quot;My Wars, Surviving WWII &amp; the FCC&quot;, published in March 2001.

== Broadcasting career ==
Quello started his career in radio broadcasting immediately after returning from Europe in 1945. He worked in the promotions department at WXYZ/Detroit. Two years later, Quello moved to rival station WJR and became vice president and general manager in 1960. When Capital Cities Broadcasting purchased WJR, Quello became WJR station manager and a Capital Cities vice president. For 21 years he served on the Detroit Housing and Urban Renewal Commission.

== Federal Communications Commission ==

He was first appointed commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission by then U.S. president Richard M. Nixon in 1974. He served there until 1997 when he stepped down. His nomination at first sparked controversy as Ralph Nader accused Quello of &quot;being a pawn for broadcasters&quot;. Fellow Michiganian, House minority leader and future United States Vice President and President Gerald Ford supported Quello&#x27;s nomination by Nixon.

For several months in 1993 Quello was the acting chairman of the FCC, succeeded by Bill Clinton nominee Reed E. Hundt. Despite his brief tenure as FCC chairman, The New York Times described his term with the headline &quot;Temporary Chief Proves More Than a Fill-In&quot;. He also was once characterized as &quot;Trumanesque&quot; for his forthright and down-to-earth, approach to government deliberations.

As FCC commissioner and chairman, Quello became known for his independent thinking. He has been a champion of preserving free universal television. His decisions contributed to the transition of the FCC and the UAmerican broadcasting market into the Information Age during a period of revolutionary technological and economic change. He argued for deregulation (he took a position against financial-interest and syndication rules) but was supportive for regulation as well. &quot;I do deregulation, I don&#x27;t do anarchy&quot;, The New York Times quoted Quello as saying.

In the early 1980s, he opposed the FCC&#x27;s move to let owners of TV stations sell their licenses after owning them a year. He called for legislation that would allow the commission to keep closer watch on the level of violence on TV.

== Awards ==
Quello earned numerous accolades during his career, including a Distinguished Service Award from the National Association of Broadcasters (1994) and the first Milestone Award from the Institute for Communications Law Studies at the Catholic University of America. James H. Quello was inducted into the Michigan Association of Broadcasters, Broadcasting/Cable Hall of Fame in 1995 and the next year into the Museum of Broadcast Communications’ Radio Hall of Fame. James Quello received a record 41 lifetime achievement and distinguished service awards for his service to the FCC.

In 1997 Quello received the Distinguished Service Award from both ALTV and NCTA, where Ted Turner presented the award, &quot;for uncommon devotion to his country in peace and war.&quot; On his 23rd anniversary at the FCC, Quello was honored by Chairman Hundt and Commissioners Ness and Chong at a laudatory dinner attended by over 1,200 devoted friends and family, as well as many distinguished members of the community. Later that year he was presented the Ellis Island Medal of Honor Award and Tom Murphy, former CEO of Capital Cities/ABC, presented the International Radio and Television Society Foundation, Inc.&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award.

== Death ==
On January 24, 2010, Quello died of heart and kidney failure while surrounded by his family at his home in Alexandria, Virginia. He was 95.

<doc id="728050" wikidata="Q14686731" url="?curid=728050" title="Morgan Falls Dam">
<text>Morgan Falls Dam is a small hydroelectric dam located along the Chattahoochee River at the northern end of Sandy Springs, Georgia, and crossing the river westwards into eastern Cobb County in north metro Atlanta. Originally constructed in 1904 by Georgia Power to provide electricity for Atlanta&#x27;s streetcars, it now provides enough power for about 4,400 homes; upon completion the dam created Bull Sluice Lake. It was named for then recently deceased Georgia Power president S. Morgan Smith&#x27;s mother whose maiden name was Morgan. At the time it was by far the largest hydroelectric plant in the state. In 1924 it was rebuilt as a 60 cycle plant with 15,000 kilowatts (up from the original 10,500 kW). In 1957 it was raised to regulate the flow from the larger Buford Dam, upstream, in order to give Atlanta water during the hours it was needed most. It is long, and tall. The dam&#x27;s license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) was issued in May 2008, and expires in February 2039 which authorizes a capacity of 16,800 kW.

The construction of the dam changed the river upstream from a narrow river with rapids into a wetland. The wetland serves as a habitat for migrating birds, waterfowl, songbirds, beavers, muskrats, and numerous species of reptiles and amphibians.

<doc id="728058" wikidata="Q880822" url="?curid=728058" title="Preston Smith (governor)">
<text>Preston Earnest Smith (March 8, 1912 – October 18, 2003) was an American entrepreneur and politician who served as the 40th governor of Texas from 1969 to 1973. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 35th lieutenant governor from 1963 to 1969.

==Early life==
Smith was born into a tenant farming family of 13 children in Corn Hill, a town in Williamson County, Texas, that has since been absorbed into nearby Jarrell. The family later moved to Lamesa, Texas, where Smith graduated in 1928 from Lamesa High School. In 1934, he graduated from Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) in Lubbock with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration. Staying in Lubbock, he founded a movie theater business and invested in real estate.

==Political career==

Smith was first elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1944 and then to the Texas State Senate in 1956.

Smith&#x27;s inauguration on January 21, 1969, had what was called &quot;the flavor of the South Plains&quot;. The Texas Tech University marching band led the parade just behind the marshal and the color guard. A mounted masked Red Raider rode with the band. Governor and Mrs. Smith, both Tech graduates, followed in an open convertible. Other Smith family members rode in the parade, followed by the new lieutenant governor, Ben Barnes. The band of Lamesa High School, Smith&#x27;s alma mater, was the first among the high school groups. Before the oath taking, the first to be televised in Texas history, Smith had been feted with a $25-per-place victory dinner in the Austin Municipal Auditorium, now the Long Center for the Performing Arts.

In 1971 and 1972, Smith was embroiled in the Sharpstown scandal stock fraud scheme, which eventually led to his downfall. Smith lost his third-term bid for the governorship of Texas to Dolph Briscoe of Uvalde in the Democratic primary in 1972.

==Later life and attempted political comeback==
After leaving office, Smith returned to Lubbock, Texas, where he was active in civic and business affairs. Although he attempted a political comeback in the 1978 Texas gubernatorial election, he was defeated in the primary.

In his later life, Smith chaired the Higher Education Coordinating Board. He died in Lubbock, Texas, on October 18, 2003, at the age of 91.

<doc id="728059" wikidata="Q914058" url="?curid=728059" title="Cabañas Department">
<text>Cabañas () is a department of El Salvador in the north central part of the country. Its capital is Sensuntepeque and it is one of coldest parts of El Salvador. Classified as a department in February 1873, it covers an area of and has over 164,900 inhabitants. The other major city of the department is Ilobasco. Agricultural produce includes coffee, sugar cane and sesame seeds, as well as dairy products. Gold, silver and copper are the principal minerals mined in the department. Its main industrial activity is oriented to manufacture of potteries, cheese, lime and distilleries.

==History==
The department takes its name from the Central-American hero General José Trinidad Cabañas who served as a minister in El Salvador in his later life. From the early 18th century, the town of Ilobasco, one of the oldest pottery centres of El Salvador, attracted Creole and Spanish inhabitants, many of which were of Cuban origin. The blue dye indigo has also been produced there in substantial quantities since at least 1735.

By the beginning of the 19th century, Ilobasco was a thriving community with the establishment of markets, pharmacies, blacksmiths and saddlers. Tourists have recently been attracted to Ilobasco where clay dolls and other types of pottery are a major attraction in addition to a lakeside recreation area. By the early 20th century, the department had two cities, Sensuntepeque and Ilobasco, as well as five towns, Victoria, Dolores, San Isidro, Jutiapa, and Tejutepeque. The Flag of the Cabañas Department is made up of blue-red colours painted vertically and separated by a S-like wavy white line.

==Geography==
Cabañas Department is located in the northern centre of the country, bordered on the north by the Chalatenango Department, to the northeast by Honduras, on the east by the San Miguel Department, to the south by the San Vicente Department, and to the west by the Cuscatlan Department. Of note is the long Lempa River (), reservoirs of the Cerrón Grande hydroelectric dam, the La Cruz hills () and the Ocotillo (). The department includes parts of the highland district of Cojutepeque and shares a border with the plateau district in the west. Small streams drain from the Jiboa River, Titihuapa River, and Acahuapa River, while others drain to the Lempa River. Most of the area consists of mountain ranges and chains, though the eastern and northern parts of the Department are desolate. There are also fertile valleys, which produce agricultural crops such as indigo, rice, corn, and many other grains.

<doc id="728060" wikidata="Q442258" url="?curid=728060" title="Marilyn Quayle">
<text>Marilyn Tucker Quayle (born July 29, 1949) is an American lawyer and novelist. She is married to the 44th vice president of the United States, Dan Quayle, and served as the second lady of the United States from 1989 until 1993.

==Early life and education==
Marilyn Tucker was born in the Meridian-Kessler area of Indianapolis, Indiana, to Mary Alice (née Craig, d. 1975) and Warren Samuel Tucker (d. 2004). The fourth of six children, she has three sisters (Nancy, Sally, and Janet) and two brothers (James and William). Her parents were both doctors. Her maternal grandfather was born in Maybole, Scotland. She had a strict Christian upbringing. The Tuckers were longtime admirers of Colonel Robert B. Thieme, Jr., the founder and former pastor of Berachah Church in Houston. Years later, when media attention focused on her family&#x27;s religious beliefs, Marilyn Quayle said in an NBC interview: &quot;I grew up with my mother listening to (Thieme&#x27;s) tapes. ... I have never listened to him on social issues. I didn&#x27;t even know that he espoused any.&quot; She does defend his biblical teachings.

She attended Broad Ripple High School and subsequently received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from Purdue University. While attending college, she served as a pompom girl and as treasurer of her freshman class. She later attended law school at night and earned a J.D. at Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law. There, she met Dan Quayle, the son of a newspaper publisher. The two were assigned to work together on a draft version of Indiana&#x27;s death penalty law. A courtship quickly developed, and they were married by their law school dean just a few weeks later, on November 18, 1972. In 1974, they both passed the bar exam; she had given birth to their first child just a few days before the exam.

==Career==
Marilyn and Dan moved back to Huntington, Indiana and opened a joint law practice, Quayle and Quayle. She did most of the legal work; he worked for his father&#x27;s newspaper and prepared to enter politics. In 1976, he was elected to Congress as a Republican, whereupon they suspended their law practice. In 1980, he was elected to the Senate. 

In 1988, Dan was elected Vice President on George H. W. Bush&#x27;s ticket. Throughout her husband&#x27;s political career, Marilyn was &quot;always her husband&#x27;s closest and most candid advisor.&quot; She campaigned independently during the presidential campaign. During the 1988 campaign, she was often portrayed in the press as smart, cold, and tough – the power behind her husband. But as second lady, she played a mostly traditional role as hostess, while being an active and involved mother to their three young children. She also worked for causes such as early diagnosis of breast cancer (her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 56). With her sister Nancy, she also published a novel, &quot;Embrace the Serpent&quot;, a thriller about the wife of a vice president.

During the 1992 presidential campaign, Marilyn was an active campaigner, delivering a speech at the Republican National Convention and spending more than 40 days on the campaign trail. In her speeches, she took a strong &quot;family values&quot; theme, and she was very popular with conservatives. Ultimately, Bush and Quayle lost reelection that year, and the Quayles returned to Huntington, where she joined an Indianapolis law firm. The couple later moved to Arizona, where the former Vice President had spent much of his formative years.

In 1996, Quayle narrated an advertisement for Indiana gubernatorial candidate Stephen Goldsmith. In 2010, she narrated an advertisement for Georgia gubernatorial candidate Karen Handel.

In 2011, she was reported to have phoned Arizona governor Jan Brewer about an Arizona redistricting plan that was detrimental to her son, Congressman Benjamin Quayle.

==Personal life==
The Quayles live in Paradise Valley, Arizona. They have three children: two sons, Tucker, founder of an investment company called Tynwald Capital, and Benjamin, who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Arizona&#x27;s 3rd Congressional District from 2011 to 2013; and a daughter, Corinne.

<doc id="728062" wikidata="Q150863" url="?curid=728062" title="31 Euphrosyne">
<text>31 Euphrosyne is one of the largest asteroids (approximately tied for 7th place, to within measurement uncertainties). It was discovered by James Ferguson on September 1, 1854, the first asteroid found from North America. It is named after Euphrosyne, one of the Charites in Greek mythology. In 2019 a small companion was discovered. It is the third-roundest known asteroid (after 1 Ceres and 10 Hygiea); this is thought to be due to having re-accreted after being disrupted by a collision, and it is not close to hydrostatic equilibrium.

==Observations==
Euphrosyne is a fairly dark body near the belt&#x27;s outer edge. Consequently, it is never visible with binoculars, having a maximum apparent magnitude at the best possible opposition of around +10.2 (as in November 2011), which is fainter than any of the thirty asteroids previously discovered.

Euphrosyne has a high orbital inclination and eccentricity having nodes near perihelion and aphelion, Euphrosyne&#x27;s perihelion lies at the northernmost point of its orbit. During perihelic oppositions, Euphrosyne is very high in the sky from northern latitudes and invisible from southern countries such as New Zealand and Chile.

==Surface==
Euphrosyne is a C-type asteroid with a primitive surface possibly covered by thick ejecta blanket from the collision that created its moon and collisional family. There are no deep basins. Any craters larger than 40 km in diameter must have flat floors to not be visible in the VLT images, consistent with an icy C-type composition. The lack of craters could also be due to the young age of the surface.

==Mass and density==
The discovery of its satellite enabled the first accurate measure of Euphrosyne&#x27;s mass in 2020, at , and thus a density of . The low density suggests that Euphrosyne is half water ice if internal porosity is 20%.

==Family==

Euphrosyne is the namesake of a complex family of about two thousand asteroids that share similar spectral properties and orbital elements. They are thought to have arisen from a recent collision approximately 280 million years ago. All members have relatively high orbital inclinations. The second largest body in this group, 895 Helio, is most likely an interloper.

==Satellite==
In 2019 a small satellite was discovered, likely resulting from the same collisional event that created the family. Preliminary orbit computations indicated an orbital period of approximately 1.2 days and a semi-major axis of 670 km. VLT images indicate that the moon is 4 km in diameter, assuming it has the same albedo as Euphrosyne.

<doc id="728064" wikidata="Q522221" url="?curid=728064" title="Chalatenango Department">
<text>Chalatenango () is a department of El Salvador located in the northwest of the country. The department&#x27;s capital city is the city of Chalatenango, which shares the same name as the department. Chalatenango covers a land area of 779 sq mi (2,017 km2) and contains over 192,000 inhabitants. Chalatenango&#x27;s maximum elevation, located at Cerro El Pital (the country&#x27;s highest point), is .

Amílcar Iván Monge Monge of Nuevas Ideas has been the governor of Chalatenango since 2020.

== Etymology ==

The name Chalatenango derives from the Nawat words or meaning &quot;sand&quot;, meaning &quot;water&quot; or &quot;river&quot;, and meaning &quot;valley&quot;. In its entirety, &quot;Chalatenango&quot; means &quot;valley of sandy waters&quot;.

== History ==

The indigenous peoples of the Americas had lived in the region of the modern-day Chalatenango department for over one thousand five hundred years before the arrival of the Spanish in the 1500s. The indigenous people of the area lived in densely populated communities and cultivated maize. From 1524 to 1539, the Spanish conquered the territories of modern-day El Salvador, including Chalatenango.

In 1790, Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet, the colonial intendant of the Intendancy of San Salvador, recruited laborers from the Spanish regions of Asturias, Cantabria, and Galicia to work in the production of indigo in the modern-day region of the Chalatenango department. The laborers were recruited due to a decrease in the indigenous population in the area. As a result, Chalatenango saw a significant increase of a lighter-skinned populace compared to the rest of El Salvador.

Chalatenango was made a department in 1855.

During the 1700s and 1800s, Chalatenango was mostly dependent on indigo production, however, the fall of indigo prices in the 1860s led to the department falling into a state of impoverishment. Since then, Chalatenango was one of the country&#x27;s poorest departments, as most impoverished peasant farmers in El Salvador lived in the department, especially during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1961, 56 percent of the urban population was literate, while only 27 percent of the rural population was literate. During the 1970s, Chalatenango only had one hospital, and only 57 percent of the population had access to any type of medical clinic; only one third of households had running water and only 16 percent had access to electricity. In 1971, the local minimum wage in Chalatenango was SVC₡1.00 to 2.50 per day, compared to the national minimum wage of SVC₡2.75 per day, and in 1975, Chalatenango had an unemployment rate of 40 percent, the highest of any department.

The Chalatenango department was a military stronghold for the Farabundo Martí Popular Liberation Forces (FPL) and the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Bloc (BPR), two Marxist armed organizations, during the 1970s due to the department&#x27;s mountainous terrain. The department continued to be a military stronghold for the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), a left-wing guerrilla group which the FPL was a founding member of, during the Salvadoran Civil War (1979–1992). Due to its nature as a guerrilla stronghold, several military operations conducted by both sides of the civil war occurred in Chalatenango. During the civil war, many refugees fled south to the shore of Lake Suchitlán or left the department entirely for either Honduras or the United States. Many mayors in northern Chalatenango also fled their municipalities, leaving them to be effectively controlled by the FMLN; during and after the civil war, references were made by locals that there were &quot;two Chalatenangos&quot;, one under government control and one under guerrilla control. By 1983, the FMLN held 15 of the department&#x27;s 13 municipalities. Several civil war massacres occurred in Chalatenango, including the 1980 Sumpul River massacre and the 1982 Santa Rita massacre.

From 1992 to 1995, following the conclusion of the civil war, the Municipalities-in-Action (MEA) program listed 20 out of the department&#x27;s 33 municipalities as &quot;reconstruction municipalities&quot; as they were severely damaged during the civil war, most of which were located in territories controlled by the FMLN. The MEA allocated SVC₡85 million (equivalent of USD$9.75 million) to Chalatenango to help built schools, clinics, roads, and water systems, the highest amount given to any department.

== Geography ==

Chalatenango covers a land area of 779 sq mi (2,017 km2). It lies along the Tamulasco and Cholco rivers at an elevation of 1,660 feet (506 metres).

== Demographics ==

The population of Chalatenango increased by over 50 percent between 1770 and 1892, compared to national figure of 32 percent; the department&#x27;s population in 1892 totaled around 54,000 people. By 1971, the department&#x27;s population had increased to 172,075, but by then, its population growth had fallen to 2.3 percent per year, the lowest of any department. During the 1970s, Chalatenango had the highest rate of internal migration at –16.1 percent. In 2007, Chalatenango had a population of 192,788, the fourth smallest department by population.

On 13 June 2023, 67 of the 84 deputies of the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador voted in favor of a bill proposed by President Nayib Bukele to reduce the total number of the country&#x27;s municipalities from 262 to 44. As a result, Chalatenango&#x27;s 33 municipalities were consolidated into 3, known as Chalatenango Norte, Chalatenango Centro, and Chalatenango Sur; the 33 municipalities remained extant as districts, and the change went into effect on 1 May 2024.

== Agriculture ==

The department heavily relies on agriculture to sustain its population. Crops such as maize, beans, and vegetables are cultivated on around 3.5 percent of the department&#x27;s land, meanwhile, cattle are raised on around 35 percent of its land.

== Infrastructure ==

Chalatenango has two main roads which travel through the department. The first, the Northern Trunk Highway (CA4), connects San Salvador, the country&#x27;s capital city, in the south with the Honduran border in the north. The second, the Longitudinal Trunk Highway (CA3), connects the departments of Santa Ana in the west and Cabañas in the east. Other highways include the Arcatao Highway (CHA07) connecting the city of Chalatenango with Arcatao, the La Montañona Perimeter Ring (CHA07) connecting the Concepción Quezaltepeque with Ojos de Agua via the city of Chalatenango, and the Dulce Nombre de María–San Fernando Road (CHA13) which connects the two aforementioned municipalities.

== Crime ==

Chalatenango used to be under in influence of the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) criminal gang, specifically its Fulton Locos Salvatruchos cell, until May 2023 when the Salvadoran government began the Siege of Nueva Concepción, an operation in Nueva Concepción (the gang&#x27;s primary stronghold) to extract and arrest as many gang members as possible as a part of the country&#x27;s gang crackdown. The Texis Cartel also operated out of Chalatenango. Common crimes which were committed in Chalatenango included arms trafficking, drug trafficking (such as cocaine and marijuana), human trafficking, and extortion.

<text>Jan Eduard de Quay (26 August 1901 – 4 July 1985) was a Dutch politician of the defunct Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP) now the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) party and psychologist who served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 19 May 1959 until 24 July 1963.

De Quay studied Applied psychology and Literature at the Utrecht University obtaining Master of Psychology and Letters degree&#x27;s followed by a postgraduate education in Clinical Psychology at the Stanford University obtaining a Master of Social Science degree and worked as a researcher and associate professor of Applied psychology at the University of Tilburg from September 1927 until August 1939 before finishing his thesis at his alma and graduated as a Doctor of Psychology in Applied psychology and worked as a professor of Applied psychology, business administration and business theory at the University of Tilburg from March 1933 until August 1939. De Quay also served as Rector Magnificus of the university from January 1938 until January 1939. During World War II De Quay was co-founder of the controversial Dutch Union in July 1940 but the organisation was disbanded by the German occupation authority in December 1941. Shortly before the end of the War De Quay was appointed as Minister of War in the Cabinet Gerbrandy III, the last government-in-exile taking office on 4 April 1945. After a cabinet formation De Quay was not included in the new cabinet. De Quay continued to be active in politics and in September 1946 was nominated as the next Queen&#x27;s Commissioner of North Brabant taking office on 1 November 1946. After the election of 1959 De Quay was persuaded to lead a new cabinet. Following a successful cabinet formation De Quay formed the Cabinet De Quay and became Prime Minister of the Netherlands taking office on 19 May 1959.

Before the election of 1963 De Quay indicated that he would not serve another term as Prime Minister or not stand for the election. De Quay left office following the installation of the Cabinet Marijnen on 24 July 1963. De Quay was elected as a Member of the Senate after the Senate election of 1963 taking office on 25 June 1963 serving as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Foreign Affairs. After the Night of Schmelzer De Quay was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport and Water Management in the caretaker Cabinet Zijlstra taking office on 22 November 1966. Shortly thereafter De Quay announced that he would decline to serve in new cabinet and returned to the Senate serving from 13 June 1967 until 16 September 1969.

De Quay retired from active politics at 68 and became active in the private and public sectors as a corporate and non-profit director and served on several state commissions and councils on behalf of the government. De Quay was known for his abilities as an effective team leader and consensus builder. During his premiership, his cabinet was responsible for major reforms to the education system, the public sector, social security and dealing with several major crises such as the West New Guinea dispute. De Quay withdrew from public life and lived in retirement until his death in July 1985 at the age of 83. He holds the distinction as the leading the first cabinet to have completed a full term after World War II and his premiership is consistently regarded both by scholars and the public to have been average.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Jan Eduard de Quay was born in ’s-Hertogenbosch on 26 August 1901. After attending a Jesuit school in Katwijk, he graduated in psychology from the University of Utrecht in 1926. The following year he was awarded a doctorate for his thesis on the contribution of sensory and motor factors to the learning and labour process.


In 1928 he was appointed lecturer in psychotechnology at the Catholic college of higher education in Tilburg (now the University of Tilburg) and in 1933 professor of business economics and psychotechnology at the same institution. During the pre-war mobilisation of the Netherlands (1939-1940) De Quay became a lieutenant in the reserve. In July 1940 he formed the Triumvirate of the controversial nationalist Dutch Union with Louis Einthoven and Hans Linthorst Homan. This Union was controversial because its leaders suggested partial collaboration with the German occupiers. In August 1940 De Quay started secret meetings with the fascistic Nationaal Front in order to fuse the two organisations. During these talks De Quay called himself a fascist, the Union a fascistic organisation and said that he rejected democracy. In May and June of the same year he was government commissioner for labour at the Ministry of Social Affairs. In this position he encouraged the Dutch population to seek employment in Germany. From July 1942 to June 1943 he was interned in Haaren, after which he went into hiding from the occupation authorities. This lasted until June 1943, when he went into hiding. Following the liberation of the area south of the rivers in late 1944, he became chairman of the Board of Commissioners for Agriculture, Industry, Trade and Commerce set up to restore the national economy.

===Politics===
From 5 April until 23 June 1945, De Quay was Minister of War in the second Gerbrandy cabinet. On 1 November 1946 he became Queen&#x27;s Commissioner of North Brabant until 19 May 1959.

He served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 19 May 1959 until 24 July 1963. The free Saturday was introduced (for civil servants, in 1961), as well as laws for education (mammoetwet), unemployment benefit (bijstandwet) and child benefit (kinderbijslagwet). Natural gas was discovered in Slochteren, which would later turn out to be one of the biggest gas reserves in the world and a major source of income for the Netherlands in the decades to come. On 23 December 1960 the cabinet fell over extra public housing (woningwetwoningen), but Gaius de Gaay Fortman reconciled matters and the cabinet resumed on 2 January 1961. In August/September 1962, New Guinea was handed over to Indonesia, under supervision of the UN.

Shortly after the installation of the new government, minister of defence Ven den Bergh resigned for personal reasons (family affairs with his United States wife and children). In 1962, the new minister of defence Visser also had to resign after protests against his dismissal of a critical civil servant. In 1961 minister Van Rooy of social affairs resigned after criticism of how he dealt with the new child benefit law. His post was taken over by former state secretary Veldkamp, whose now vacant former position in turn was taken over by Gijzels. In 1963, a proposal to install commercial television was not accepted.

He served as a Member of the Senate from 25 June 1963 until 22 November 1966. During the Cabinet Zijlstra he served as Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management and Deputy Prime Minister from 22 November 1966 until 5 April 1967. On 13 June 1967 he again was a Member of the Senate until 16 September 1969.

==Personal life==
On 8 August 1927, De Quay married Maria van der Lande (29 August 1901 – 6 November 1988). De Quay died on 4 July 1985 in Beers, he was 83.

<text>32 Pomona ( ;) is a stony main-belt asteroid that is in diameter. It was discovered by German-French astronomer Hermann Mayer Salomon Goldschmidt on October 26, 1854, and is named after Pōmōna, the Roman goddess of fruit trees.

Photometric observations of this asteroid gave a light curve with a synodic rotation period of 9.448 hours. The data was used to construct a model for the asteroid, revealing it to be an angular object that is spinning about a pole with ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (+58°, 267°). The ratio of the major to minor axes&#x27; lengths is roughly equal to 1.3.

The spectrum of 32 Pomona matches an S-type in the Tholen classification system, and is similar to primitive achondrite meteorites. Measurements of the thermal inertia of 32 Pomona give a value of around 20–120 m−2 K−1 s−1/2, compared to 50 for lunar regolith and 400 for coarse sand in an atmosphere.

==Observations==
Australian amateur astronomer Jonathan Bradshaw recorded an unusual asteroid occultation by 32 Pomona on 16 August 2008. The expected maximum duration of the occultation was 7.1 secs; however, the video recording shows two separate occultations of equal depth each lasting 1.2 seconds, separated by 0.8 secs. Those durations convert to chord lengths at the asteroid of 15 km, 10 km, and 15 km – for a total length of 40 km. The IRAS diameter for Pomona is 80.76 ± 1.6 km. The most likely explanation for this observation is that the asteroid is either binary (including a contact binary), or is a unitary asteroid with a significant concave region on its surface. The video of this occultation can be viewed on YouTube.

<text>La Libertad () is one of the departments of El Salvador and is located in the southwest of the country. The capital is Santa Tecla. It has an area 1,653 km² and a population of 765,879 people. 

==History==
It was classified as a department on January 28, 1865. The population was settled on the Ulliman Plains, which is where rubber is harvested. The city was called &quot;Nueva Ciudad de San Salvador&quot; (New City of San Salvador) and made the department&#x27;s capital on the same date as the department was declared. The department&#x27;s capital was renamed Santa Tecla on December 22, 2003. The agricultural products that are cultivated are the basic grains, balsam, sugar cane, coffee, grass, hortensia, cocoa, and fruits. They also develop the bovine, equine and pig cattle, the raising of poultry and beekeeping. It also stands out in the textile industry and the production of candles, soaps, furniture, clothes, footwear, dairy products, and many diverse products and liquors.

At 12 km. to the west of the capital city, in a valley at 923 meters above sea level, is located the town of Santa Tecla whose official name is Nueva San Salvador. Because it is between on the sides of Quezaltepeque or Volcano of San Salvador and a low and picturesque mountain, in poetic language it is designated as “The city of the hills”. The earthquake of April 16, 1854, destroyed the capital city from its foundations. Facing the moving debris, the President José María San Martín settled the government&#x27;s new headquarters in the plain of Santa Tecla. The decree was emitted the following August 8, but it was not until Christmas Day of the same year that the neighbours took possession of the place and they swore vicinity. It was ascended to the category of departmental head on January 28, 1865.

The parks “Daniel Hernandez”, with the bust in marble of the educator, and “San Martín”, with a monument erected celebrating the centennial of the city of Nueva San Salvador, are located in Santa Tecla. It has modern and old churches: The parish of Concepción and the neo-Gothic Carmen&#x27;s Church, built at the end of the past century by the architect, sculptor, and painter Pascacio Gonzales.

Also, the cluster of tourism of the port of La Libertad celebrates the Gastronomic Festival which is distinguished annually because each restaurant exposes its best menu for sale. During the Festival, combo music livens up the whole day in the sector of the beaches.

==Archeological ruins==

=== Archeological Site &quot;Joya De Cerén&quot; ===
This archeological site is considered the most important all over the Mayan world since it is the only place that reflects the way in which our ancestors lived 1,400 years ago. It was declared “World Heritage” by UNESCO in 1993. Joya de Cerén was a village that was buried by the eruption of the volcano Loma Caldera in the year 600 AD. The volcanic lava petrified the houses of the residents and it was until 1976 when it was accidentally discovered.

=== Archeological site &quot;The Bell Of San Andres&quot; ===
San Andrés is a pre-Columbian archaeological site located in San Juan Opico municipality. This site consists of three Mesoamerican pyramids, the tallest of which is of in height.

<text>William J. Quarter (January 21, 1806 – April 10, 1848) was an Irish-born Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Chicago from 1844 to 1848.

==Biography==

===Early years===
William Quarter was born on January 21, 1806, in Killurin, King&#x27;s County, in Ireland to Michael and Ann (née Bennet) Quarter. The third of four sons, he had three brothers: John, Walter and James Quarter. Walter and James also joined the priesthood, but James died before his ordination.

As a youth, William Quarter studied the classics at private academies in Tullamore, Ireland from 1814 to 1822. While preparing to enter St. Patrick&#x27;s College, the main Irish seminary in Maynooth, Quarter met a priest who had served as a missionary in the United States. The priest told Quarter that many of the Irish immigrants there were not receiving the sacraments of the Catholic Church due to the shortage of priests and churches. At that point, Quarter decided to enter a seminary in the British Colony of Quebec with the goal of becoming a missionary.

With permission from Bishop James Doyle of Kildare and Leighlin, Quarter sailed from from Ireland in April 1822, arriving in Quebec City. He then applied for admission to seminaries operated by the Archdiocese of Quebec and the Diocese of Montreal, but they rejected him because he was only 16 years old.

Quarter then traveled to Emmitsburg, Maryland, in the United States to apply to Mount St. Mary&#x27;s College, the first seminary in the United States; he was accepted there. While at Mount St. Mary&#x27;s, Quarter became professor of Greek and Latin, as well as sacristan in 1823. He completed his theological studies in 1829 at Mount St. Mary&#x27;s and then traveled to New York City.

=== Priesthood ===

Quarter was ordained into the priesthood by Bishop John Dubois in New York on September 19, 1829, for the Diocese of New York. Since Quarter was only 23 years old, he needed a special dispensation for his ordination.

After his ordination, the diocese assigned Quarter as a curate at St. Peter&#x27;s Parish in Manhattan, the oldest parish in the state. During the cholera epidemic of the summer of 1832, Quarter ministered to the sick and dying. He placed the children who had been orphaned by the epidemic under the care of the Sisters of Charity.

In 1833, the diocese appointed Quarter as pastor of the new St. Mary&#x27;s Parish on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He opened a parish school there. In 1840, Quarter began conversing with Maximilian Oertel, a former Lutheran minister from the Kingdom of Bavaria who had become disillusioned with his church. After receiving spiritual guidance from Quarter, Oertel converted to Catholicism that year.

===Bishop of Chicago===

On November 28, 1843, Quarter was appointed the first bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Chicago by Pope Gregory XVI. He received his episcopal consecration on March 10, 1844, from Bishop John Hughes, with Bishops Benedict Fenwick and Richard Whelan serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Manhattan

While still in New York City, Quarter met Mother Frances Ward, who was arriving with several religious sisters of the Sisters of Mercy from Ireland. He asked Ward to establish a convent in Chicago. Accompanied by his brother Walter (who later became vicar general), Quarter arrived in Chicago on May 5, 1844.

Quarter&#x27;s most immediate need on becoming bishop was resolving the $5,000 debt passed down to the new diocese. Using his own money and contributions from his family, Quarter paid the diocesan debt. The next big problem was a shortage of priests. Previous to 1843, the eastern part of Illinois was part of the Diocese of Vincennes in Indiana. With the creation of a new diocese in Illinois, the bishop of Vincennes started recalling all his priests back to Indiana. Quarter requested that the bishop delay their return, but it was denied.

To prepare more priests, Quarter in June 1844 opened the University of Saint Mary of the Lake in temporary quarters in Chicago with six seminarians and two professors. This was the first seminary in Chicago. At the end of June, then began touring parishes throughout the diocese. At this time, the diocese included the entire state of Illinois. He went to Joliet, Ottawa and Kaskaskia, ending up in St. Louis, Missouri.

Another problem that Quarter faced was the ownership of church property in the diocese. As in other dioceses, the trustees in many parishes were unwilling to allow bishops to control churches and other parish property. In February 1845, the Illinois General Assembly passed a bill that incorporated the bishop of Chicago, allowing him to &quot;hold real and other property in trust for religious purposes.&quot;

In April 1845, Quarter and his brother Walter traveled to New York City to solicit donations from parishes in the diocese for the Diocese of Chicago. Spending three months in New York, Quarter raised $3,0000. Quarter consecrated St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in October 1845, although not all of it was finished.

During 1845, contractors started building a permanent structure for Saint Mary of the Lake. The project ran into trouble later that year when the contractor was jailed for failing to pay a lumber bill. The diocese in January 1846 received a letter that threatened the burning of the building if the workers were not paid. The new campus finally opened in July 1846.

During the 1840s, the majority of Catholics in Illinois were German immigrants. Many of them had been upset that the Vatican had appointed an Irish bishop. In August 1846, three German congregants in the diocese wrote a letter to the Chicago newspapers saying that the pope should appoint a German-speaking coadjutor bishop to run the diocese. Quarter summoned the men to his office and threatened to declare them as schismatics if they continued these actions.

In September 1846, Quarter accompanied six sisters from the Sisters of Mercy from their convent in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Chicago. This was the first women&#x27;s religious order to reside in Chicago. That same year, they founded Saint Xavier College for women, the first Catholic institution of higher learning in Chicago. Quarter opened parish schools for boys and girls at St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral parish in 1846. These became the first parochial schools in the diocese.

In November 1846, Quarter held the first theological conference in the diocese.

=== Death and legacy ===
On April 10, 1848, Quarter woke up complaining of pain in his heart and his head, then died suddenly; he was 42. Doctors suspected that he had suffered a brain hemorrhage.

Quarter&#x27;s body was on viewing for two days, attracting many Protestants and city officials as well as Catholics. He was interred in the vault under St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral. During his four-year tenure, he founded 30 churches and ordained 29 priests.

<doc id="728080" wikidata="Q753942" url="?curid=728080" title="Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway">
<text>The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway , often referred to as the Santa Fe or AT&amp;SF, was one of the largest Class 1 railroads in the United States between 1859 and 1996.

The Santa Fe was a pioneer in intermodal freight transport; at various times, it operated an airline, the short-lived Santa Fe Skyway, and the Santa Fe Railroad tugboats. Its bus line extended passenger transportation to areas not accessible by rail, and ferryboats on the San Francisco Bay allowed travelers to complete their westward journeys to the Pacific Ocean. The AT&amp;SF was the subject of a popular song, Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer&#x27;s &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe&quot;, written for the film &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; (1946).

The railroad officially ceased independent operations on December 31, 1996, when it merged with the Burlington Northern Railroad to form the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway.

==History==
===Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway===

The railroad was chartered in February 1859 to serve the cities of Atchison and Topeka, Kansas, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. The railroad reached the Kansas–Colorado border in 1873 and Pueblo, Colorado, in 1876. To create a demand for its services, the railroad set up real estate offices and sold farmland from the land grants that it was awarded by Congress for laying track.

As the railroad was first being built, many of the tracks were laid directly over the wagon ruts of the Santa Fe Trail. In 1869, the first general office building of the company was built in Topeka. This building also served as a passenger station and freight depot. When the line was extended to Newton, Kansas in 1871, the railroad became a major cattle shipper to ensure a steady revenue stream, at the end of Texas cattle drive trails.

Despite being chartered to serve the city, the railroad chose to bypass Santa Fe, due to the engineering challenges of the mountainous terrain. Eventually a branch line from Lamy, New Mexico, brought the Santa Fe railroad the 20 miles to its namesake city. It continued to connect with the Southern Pacific at Deming. 

The system was eventually expanded with branch lines into California, Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Illinois. It reached Arizona and California by acquiring control of the western portion of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad in 1880. It reached Chicago by acquiring the Chicago and St. Louis Railway in 1887. By 1887 the mainline had been completed from Chicago to Los Angeles, making it one of the country’s most important railroads and one of the few that directly connected the Midwest with the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean under one corporation. The principal lines consisted of:
* Chicago to Kansas City to La Junta, Colorado, to Los Angeles; 
* Emporia, Kansas, to Oklahoma City to Fort Worth to Houston; 
* Emporia, Kansas, to Dalies, New Mexico; 
* Barstow to Richmond, California (the Valley Division); 
* Temple to Farwell, Texas; 
* Denver to La Junta, Colorado; 
* Albuquerque, New Mexico, to El Paso, Texas; 
* Dallas to Presidio, Texas; and 
* Kansas City to Tulsa.

The primary back shops at Topeka, Kansas, were first established in the 1860s. The original shops were relocated in 1878 to the south side of Seward Avenue and expanded in 1902 to double the repair capacity. The shops at Albuquerque, New Mexico, were built in 1880 and materially expanded in 1925. Another shop site was established at San Bernardino, California, in 1886. To maintain rolling stock in the state of Texas, a fourth major shop facility was built in Cleburne, Texas, in 1899.


Physical confrontations led to two years of armed conflict that became known as the Royal Gorge Railroad War. Federal intervention prompted an out-of-court settlement on February 2, 1880, in the form of the so-called &quot;Treaty of Boston&quot;, wherein the D&amp;RG was allowed to complete its line and lease it for use by the Santa Fe.

Building across Kansas and eastern Colorado was simple, with few natural obstacles, but the railroad found it almost economically impossible because of the sparse population. It set up real estate offices in the area and promoted settlement across Kansas on the land granted to it by Congress in 1863.

The Santa Fe entered Texas by starting what became the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railway in 1886 and acquiring the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway in 1887. The Santa Fe reached San Francisco by buying the San Francisco &amp; San Joaquin Valley Railway in 1891. They completed a Grand Canyon branch in 1901. The Santa Fe acquired the properties of the Southern California Railway in 1906. They acquired a Phoenix branch with the purchase of the Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railway in 1911.

===Expansion===

In 1928, the Santa Fe acquired the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railway.

On , the railway was one of many companies that sponsored attractions in Disneyland with its five-year sponsorship of all Disneyland trains and stations until 1974.

In 1960, AT&amp;SF bought the Toledo, Peoria &amp; Western Railroad (TP&amp;W); then sold a half-interest to the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). The TP&amp;W cut straight east across Illinois from near Fort Madison, Iowa (Lomax, IL), to a connection with the PRR at Effner, Indiana (Illinois–Indiana border), forming a bypass around Chicago for traffic moving between the two lines. The TP&amp;W route did not mesh with the traffic patterns Conrail developed after 1976, so AT&amp;SF bought back the other half, merged the TP&amp;W in 1983, then sold it back into independence in 1989.

===Attempted Southern Pacific merger===
AT&amp;SF began merger talks in the 1980s. The Southern Pacific Santa Fe Railroad (SPSF) was a proposed merger between the parent companies of the Southern Pacific and AT&amp;SF announced on December23, 1983. As part of the joining of the two firms, all rail and non-rail assets owned by Santa Fe Industries and the Southern Pacific Transportation Company were placed under the control of a holding company, the Santa Fe–Southern Pacific Corporation. The merger was subsequently denied by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) on the basis that it would create too many duplicate routes.

The companies were so confident the merger would be approved that they began repainting locomotives and non-revenue rolling stock in a new unified paint scheme. While Southern Pacific (railroad) was sold off to Rio Grande Industries, all of the SP&#x27;s real estate holdings were consolidated into a new company, Catellus Development Corporation, making it California&#x27;s largest private landowner, of which Santa Fe remained the owner. In the early 1980s, gold was discovered on several properties west of Battle Mountain, Nevada along I-80, on ground owned by the Santa Fe Railroad (formerly SP). The Santa Fe Pacific Corporation (a name correlation of Santa Fe and Southern Pacific) was to develop the properties. They were sold to Newmont during 1997 in preparation for the merger with Burlington Northern). Sometime later, Catellus would purchase the Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s interest in the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal (LAUPT).

===Burlington Northern merger===

On September22, 1995, AT&amp;SF merged with Burlington Northern Railroad to form the Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway (BNSF). Some of the challenges resulting from the joining of the two companies included the establishment of a common dispatching system, the unionization of AT&amp;SF&#x27;s non-union dispatchers, and incorporating AT&amp;SF&#x27;s train identification codes throughout. The two lines maintained separate operations until December31, 1996, when it officially became BNSF.

==Passenger service==

AT&amp;SF was widely known for its passenger train service in the first half of the 20th century. AT&amp;SF introduced many innovations in passenger rail travel, among these the &quot;Pleasure Domes&quot; of the &quot;Super Chief&quot; (billed as the &quot;...only dome car[s] between Chicago and Los Angeles&quot; when they were introduced in 1951) and the &quot;Big Dome&quot; Lounge cars and double-decker Hi-Level cars of the &quot;El Capitan&quot;, which entered revenue service in 1954. The railroad was among the first to add dining cars to its passenger trains, a move which began in 1891, following the examples of the Northern Pacific and Union Pacific railroads. The AT&amp;SF offered food on board in a dining car or at one of the many Harvey House restaurants that were strategically located throughout the system.

In general, the same train name was used for both directions of a particular train. The exceptions to this rule included the &quot;Chicagoan&quot; and &quot;Kansas Cityan&quot; trains (both names referred to the same service, but the &quot;Chicagoan&quot; was the eastbound version, while the &quot;Kansas Cityan&quot; was the westbound version), and the &quot;Eastern Express&quot; and &quot;West Texas Express&quot;. All AT&amp;SF trains that terminated in Chicago did so at Dearborn Station. Trains terminating in Los Angeles arrived at AT&amp;SF&#x27;s La Grande Station until May 1939, when Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal was opened.

The Santa Fe was the only railroad to run trains from Chicago to California on its own tracks. The railway&#x27;s extensive network was also home to a number of regional services. These generally couldn&#x27;t boast of the size or panache of the transcontinental trains, but built up enviable reputations of their own nonetheless. Of these, the Chicago-Texas trains were the most famous and impressive. The &quot;San Diegans&quot;, which ran from Los Angeles to San Diego, were the most popular and durable, becoming to the Santa Fe what New York City-Philadelphia trains were to the Pennsylvania Railroad. But Santa Fe flyers also served Tulsa, Oklahoma, El Paso, Texas, Phoenix, Arizona (the &quot;Hassayampa Flyer&quot;), and Denver, Colorado, among other cities not on their main line.

To reach smaller communities, the railroad operated mixed (passenger and freight) trains or gas-electric doodlebug rail cars. The latter were later converted to diesel power, and one pair of Budd Rail Diesel Cars was eventually added. After World War II, Santa Fe Trailways buses replaced most of these lesser trains. These smaller trains generally were not named; only the train numbers were used to differentiate services.

The ubiquitous passenger service inspired the title of the 1946 Academy-Award-winning Harry Warren tune &quot;On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe.&quot; The song was written in 1945 for the film &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot;, a story about the waitresses of the Fred Harvey Company&#x27;s restaurants. It was sung in the film by Judy Garland and recorded by many other singers, including Bing Crosby. In the 1970s, the railroad used Crosby&#x27;s version in a commercial.

AT&amp;SF ceased operating passenger trains on May1, 1971, when it conveyed its remaining trains to Amtrak. These included the &quot;Super Chief&quot; / &quot;El Capitan&quot;, the &quot;Texas Chief&quot; and the &quot;San Diegan&quot; (though Amtrak reduced the &quot;San Diegan&quot; from three daily round trips to two). Discontinued were the &quot;San Francisco Chief&quot;, the ex-&quot;Grand Canyon&quot;, the &quot;Tulsan&quot;, and a Denver–La Junta local. ATSF had been more than willing to retain the &quot;San Diegan&quot; and its famed &quot;Chiefs.&quot; However, any railroad that opted out of Amtrak would have been required to operate &quot;all&quot; of its passenger routes until at least 1976. The prospect of having to keep operating its less-successful routes, especially the money-bleeding 23/24 (the former &quot;Grand Canyon&quot;) led ATSF to get out of passenger service altogether.

Amtrak still runs the &quot;Super Chief&quot; and &quot;San Diegan&quot; today as the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; and &quot;Pacific Surfliner,&quot; respectively, although the original routes and equipment have been modified by Amtrak.

Occasionally, a special train was chartered to make a high-profile run over the Santa Fe&#x27;s track. These specials were not included in the railroad&#x27;s regular revenue service lineup, but were intended as one-time (and usually one-way) traversals of the railroad. Some of the more notable specials include:
* &quot;Cheney Special&quot;: Colton, California – Chicago, Illinois (a one-time train that ran in 1895 on behalf of B.P. Cheney, a director of the Santa Fe).
* &quot;Clarke Special&quot;: Winslow, Arizona – Chicago, Illinois (a one-time train that ran in 1904 on behalf of Charles W. Clarke, the son of then-Arizona senator William Andrew Clarke).
* &quot;David B. Jones Special&quot;: Los Angeles, California – Chicago, Illinois, and on to Lake Forest, Illinois (a one-time, record-breaking train that ran between May5 to 8, 1923, on behalf of the president of the Mineral Point Zinc Company).
* &quot;Huntington Special&quot;: Argentine, Kansas – Chicago, Illinois (a one-time train that ran in 1899 on behalf of Collis P. Huntington).
* &quot;H.P. Lowe Special&quot;: Chicago, Illinois – Los Angeles, California (a one-time, record-breaking train that ran in 1903 on behalf of the president of the Engineering Company of America).
* &quot;Miss Nellie Bly Special&quot;: San Francisco, California – Chicago, Illinois (a one-time, record-breaking train that ran in 1890 on behalf of Nellie Bly, a reporter for the &quot;New York World&quot; newspaper).
* &quot;Peacock Special&quot;: Los Angeles, California – Chicago, Illinois (a one-time train that ran in 1900 on behalf of A.R. Peacock, vice-president of the Carnegie Steel and Iron Company).
* &quot;Scott Special&quot;: Los Angeles, California – Chicago, Illinois (the most well-known of Santa Fe&#x27;s &quot;specials&quot;, also known as the &quot;Coyote Special&quot;, the &quot;Death Valley Coyote&quot;, and the &quot;Death Valley Scotty Special&quot;: a one-time, record-breaking train that ran in 1905, essentially as a publicity stunt).
* &quot;Wakarusa Creek Picnic Special&quot;: Topeka, Kansas – Pauline, Kansas (a one-time train that took picnickers on a 30-minute trip, at a speed of , to celebrate the official opening of the line on April26, 1869).

==Signals==

The Santa Fe employed several distinctive wayside and crossing signal styles. In an effort to reduce grade crossing accidents, the Santa Fe was an early user of wigwag signals from the Magnetic Signal Company, beginning in the 1920s. They had several distinct styles that were not commonly seen elsewhere. Model 10&#x27;s, which had the wigwag motor and banner coming from halfway up the mast with the crossbucks on top, were almost unique to the Santa Fe–the Southern Pacific had a few as well. Upper quadrant Magnetic Flagmen were used extensively on the Santa Fe as well–virtually every small town main street and a number of city streets had their crossings protected by these unique wigwags. Virtually all the wigwags were replaced with modern signals by the turn of the 21st century.

The railroad was also known for its tall &quot;T-2 style&quot; upper quadrant semaphores which provided traffic control on its lines. Again, the vast majority of these had been replaced by the beginning of the 21st century, with fewer than 10 still remaining in use in New Mexico as of 2023.

==Paint schemes==
===Steam locomotives===

The Santa Fe operated a large and varied fleet of steam locomotives. In 1899, the company owned 1,036 locomotives. Among them was the 2-10-2 &quot;Santa Fe&quot;, originally built for the railroad by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1903. The railroad would ultimately end up with the largest fleet of them, at over 300. Aside from the 2-10-2, Santa Fe rostered virtually every type of steam locomotive imaginable, including 4-4-2 &quot;Atlantics&quot;, 2-6-0 Moguls, 2-8-0 &quot;Consolidations&quot;, 2-8-2 &quot;Mikados&quot;, 2-10-0 &quot;Decapods&quot;, 2-6-2 &quot;Prairies&quot;, 4-8-4 &quot;Heavy-Mountains&quot;, 4-6-4 &quot;Heavy-Pacifics&quot;, 4-6-2 &quot;Pacifics&quot;, 4-8-2 &quot;Mountains&quot;, 2-8-4 &quot;Berkshires&quot;, and 2-10-4 &quot;Texas&quot;. The railroad also operated a fleet of heavy articulated Mallet locomotives, including 1158 class 2-6-6-2s, 2-8-8-0s, 2-10-10-2s, 2-8-8-2s, and the rare 4-4-6-2. The railroad retired its last steam locomotive in 1959.

During the twentieth century, all but one of these was painted black, with white unit numbers on the sand domes and three sides of the tender. Cab sides were lettered &quot;AT&amp;SF&quot;, also in white. The subsidiary Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe often painted all or part of the smokebox (between the boiler and the headlight) white or silver. In 1940, the circle and cross emblem was applied to the tenders of a few passenger locomotives, but these were all later painted over. After World War II, &quot;Santa Fe&quot; appeared on tender sides of mainline road locomotives in white, above the unit number. Locomotives were delivered from Baldwin with white paint on the wheel rims, but the road did not repaint these &quot;whitewalls&quot; after shopping the locomotives. After World WarII, side rods and valve gear were painted chrome yellow. For a short time, Pacific types 1369 and 1376 were semi-streamlined for &quot;Valley Flyer&quot; service, with a unique paint scheme in colors similar to those used on the new passenger diesels. Unique was the two-tone light blue over royal blue scheme of streamlined Hudson type 3460.

=== Diesel locomotives ===
====Passenger====

Santa Fe&#x27;s first set of diesel-electric passenger locomotives was placed in service on the &quot;Super Chief&quot; in 1936, and consisted of a pair of blunt-nosed units (EMC 1800 hp B-B) designated as Nos. 1 and 1A. The upper portion of the sides and ends of the units were painted gold, while the lower section was a dark olive green color; an olive stripe also ran along the sides and widened as it crossed the front of the locomotive.

Riveted to the sides of the units were metal plaques bearing a large &quot;Indian Head&quot; logo, which owed its origin to the 1926 &quot;Chief&quot; &quot;drumhead&quot; logo. &quot;Super Chief&quot; was emblazoned on a plaque located on the front. The rooftop was light slate gray, rimmed by a red pinstripe. This unique combination of colors was called the &quot;Golden Olive&quot; paint scheme. Before entering service, Sterling McDonald&#x27;s General Motors Styling Department augmented the look with the addition of red and blue striping along both the sides and ends of the units in order to enhance their appearance.
In a little over a year, the EMC E1 (a new and improved streamlined locomotive) would be pulling the &quot;Super Chief&quot; and other passenger consists, resplendent in the now-famous &quot;Warbonnet&quot; paint scheme devised by Leland Knickerbocker of the GM Art and Color Section. Its design was protected under a U.S. design patent, granted on November9, 1937. It is reminiscent of a Native American ceremonial head-dress. The scheme consisted of a red &quot;bonnet&quot; that wrapped around the front of the unit and was bordered by a yellow stripe and black pinstripe. The extent of the bonnet varied according to the locomotive model and was largely determined by the shape and length of the car body. The remainder of the unit was either painted silver or was composed of stainless-steel panels.

All units wore a nose emblem consisting of an elongated yellow &quot;Circle and Cross&quot; emblem with integral &quot;tabs&quot; on the nose and the sides, outlined and accented with black pinstripes, with variances according to the locomotive model. &quot;SANTA FE&quot; was displayed on the horizontal limb of the cross in black, Art Deco-style lettering. This emblem has come to be known as the &quot;cigar band&quot; due to its uncanny resemblance to the same. On all but the &quot;Erie-built&quot; units (which were essentially run as a demonstrator set), GE U28CG, GE U30CG, and FP45 units, a three-part yellow and black stripe ran up the nose behind the band.

A &quot;Circle and Cross&quot; motif (consisting of a yellow field, with red quadrants, outlined in black) was painted around the side windows on &quot;as-delivered&quot; E1 units. Similar designs were added to E3s, E6s, the DL109/110 locomotive set, and ATSF 1A after it was rebuilt and repainted. The sides of the units typically bore the words &quot;SANTA FE&quot; in black, 5&quot;– or 9&quot;–high extra extended Railroad Roman letters, as well as the &quot;Indian Head&quot; logo, with a few notable exceptions.

Railway identity on diesel locomotives in passenger service:


In later years, Santa Fe adapted the scheme to its gas-electric &quot;doodlebug&quot; units. The standard for all of Santa Fe&#x27;s passenger locomotives, the &quot;Warbonnet&quot; is considered by many to be the most-recognized corporate logo in the railroad industry. Early after Amtrak&#x27;s inception in 1971, Santa Fe embarked on a program to repaint the red bonnet on its F units that were still engaged in hauling passenger consists with yellow (also called &quot;Yellowbonnets&quot;) or dark blue (nicknamed &quot;Bluebonnets&quot;), as it no longer wanted to project the image of a passenger carrier.

====Freight====

Diesels used as switchers between 1935 and 1960 were painted black, with just a thin white or silver horizontal accent stripe (the sills were painted similarly). The letters &quot;A.T.&amp; S.F.&quot; were applied in a small font centered on the sides of the unit, as was the standard blue and white &quot;Santa Fe&quot; box logo. After World War II, diagonal white or silver stripes were added to the ends and cab sides to increase the visibility at grade crossings (typically referred to as the &quot;Zebra Stripe&quot; scheme). &quot;A.T.&amp; S.F.&quot; was now placed along the sides of the unit just above the accent stripe, with the blue and white &quot;Santa Fe&quot; box logo below.

Due to the lack of abundant water sources in the American desert, the Santa Fe Railway was among the first railroads to receive large numbers of streamlined diesel locomotives for use in freight service, in the form of the EMD FT. For the first group of FTs, delivered between December 1940 and March 1943 (#100–#119), the railroad selected a color scheme consisting of dark blue accented by a pale yellow stripe up the nose, and pale yellow highlights around the cab and along the mesh and framing of openings in the sides of the engine compartment; a thin red stripe separated the blue areas from the yellow.
The words SANTA FE were applied in yellow in a 5&quot;–high extended font, and centered on the nose was the &quot;Santa Fe&quot; box logo (initially consisting of a blue cross, circle, and square painted on a solid bronze sheet, but subsequently changed to baked steel sheets painted bronze with the blue identifying elements applied on top). Three thin, pale yellow stripes (known as &quot;Cat Whiskers&quot;) extended from the nose logo around the cab sides. In January, 1951, Santa Fe revised the scheme to consist of three yellow stripes running up the nose, with the addition of a blue and yellow &quot;Cigar Band&quot; (similar in size and shape to that applied to passenger units); the blue background and elongated yellow &quot;SANTA FE&quot; lettering were retained.

The years 1960 to 1972 saw non-streamlined freight locomotives sporting the &quot;Billboard&quot; color scheme (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Bookends&quot; or &quot;Pinstripe&quot; scheme), where the units were predominantly dark blue with yellow ends and trim, with a single yellow accent pinstripe. The words &quot;Santa Fe&quot; were applied in yellow in large bold serif letters (logotype) to the sides of the locomotive below the accent stripe (save for yard switchers which displayed the &quot;SANTA FE&quot; in small yellow letters above the accent stripe, somewhat akin to the &quot;Zebra Stripe&quot; arrangement).

In late 1975 and early 1976, on the occasion of the American Independence Bicentennial, Santa Fe repainted five SD45-2s with a special Bicentennial scheme at its San Bernardino Shops. These locomotives, numbered #5700 to #5704 they were placed at the front of the &quot;Super C&quot; high priority freight trains operating between Chicago and Los Angeles, although they were also seen leading the American Freedom Train&#x27;s national tour on the Santa Fe lines and also participated in special events such as the grand opening, that same year 1976, of the new Railroad&#x27;s Barstow Classification Yard. In the early 1980s these units were repainted in the company&#x27;s standard blue and yellow scheme.

From 1972 to 1996, and even on into the BNSF era, the company adopted a new paint scheme often known among railfans as the &quot;Freightbonnet&quot; or &quot;Yellowbonnet&quot;, which placed more yellow on the locomotives (reminiscent of the company&#x27;s retired &quot;Warbonnet&quot; scheme); the goal again was to ensure higher visibility at grade crossings. The truck assemblies, previously colored black, now received silver paint.
In 1965, the road took delivery of ten GE U28CG dual-service road switcher locomotives equally suited to passenger or fast freight service. These wore a variation of the &quot;Warbonnet&quot; scheme in which the black and yellow separating stripes disappeared. The &quot;Santa Fe&quot; name was emblazoned on the sides in large black letters, using the same stencils used on freight engines; these were soon repainted in red. In 1989, Santa Fe resurrected this version of the &quot;Warbonnet&quot; scheme and applied it to two SDFP45 units, #5992 and #5998. The units were re-designated as #101 and #102 and reentered service on July4, 1989, as part of the new &quot;Super Fleet&quot; campaign (the first Santa Fe units to be so decorated for freight service). The six remaining FP45 units were thereafter similarly repainted and renumbered. From that point forward, most new locomotives wore red and silver, and many retained this scheme after the Burlington Northern Santa Fe merger, some with &quot;BNSF&quot; displayed across their sides.

For the initial deliveries of factory-new &quot;Super Fleet&quot; equipment, Santa Fe took delivery of the EMD GP60M and General Electric B40-8W which made the Santa Fe the only US Class I railroad to operate new 4-axle (B-B) freight locomotives equipped with the North American Safety Cab intended for high-speed intermodal service.

Several experimental and commemorative paint schemes emerged during the Santa Fe&#x27;s diesel era. One combination was developed and partially implemented in anticipation of a merger between the parent companies of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific (SP) railroads in 1984. The red, yellow, and black paint scheme with large yellow block letters on the sides and ends of the units of the proposed Southern Pacific Santa Fe Railroad (SPSF) has come to be somewhat derisively known among railfans as the &quot;Kodachrome&quot; livery, due to the similarity in colors to the boxes containing slide film sold by the Eastman Kodak Company under the same name. Santa Fe units repainted in this scheme were labeled &quot;SF&quot;, Southern Pacific units &quot;SP&quot;, and some (presumably new) units wore the letters &quot;SPSF&quot;. After the ICC&#x27;s denial of the merger, railfans joked that SPSF really stood for &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t Paint So Fast.&quot;

== Preserved locomotives ==

While most of the Santa Fe&#x27;s steam locomotives were retired and sold for scrap, over fifty were saved and donated to various parks and museums, a handful of which have either been restored to operating condition or are pending future restoration.

Some of the more notable locomotives include:
* 5 (0-4-0), located in the CTRC trolley barn at the San Jose Historical Museum.
* 132 (2-8-0), Built by Baldwin in 1880 and located at the Kansas Museum of History in Topeka. Named for Cyrus K. Holliday. Was used often by the Santa Fe for promotions and special events until it was donated to the Kansas State Historical Society in 1977. It is the second oldest locomotive from the Santa Fe that is preserved close to its original appearance.
* 643 (2-8-0), Originally built by Hinkley Locomotive Works in 1879 as #73 with a 4-4-0 arrangement. The oldest preserved locomotive of the Santa Fe, although not as originally configured. It was converted by the railroad to a 2-8-0 configuration following an accident in 1897. It had several upgrades over the years while working on the Gulf Division. It was formerly located at the then-new Oklahoma State Fairgrounds, following its donation from the Santa Fe to the people of Oklahoma in 1953. The locomotive was relocated again in 2015 to the Oklahoma Railway Museum in Oklahoma City, where it received a badly needed cleaning and thorough cosmetic restoration, and is currently on display.
* 769 (2-8-0), located at the Old Coal Mine Museum in Madrid, New Mexico. It is waiting to be moved to the Santa Fe Southern Railway in Santa Fe for future restoration to operating condition.
* 870 (2-8-0), located at Heritage Park in Santa Fe Springs, California.
* 940 (2-10-2), located at the Union depot in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. It is the only surviving steam locomotive from the Santa Fe with a 2-10-2 wheel arrangement.
* 1010 (2-6-2), located at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento, California. It is planned to go under restoration to operating condition.
* 1129 (2-6-2), located at Las Vegas, New Mexico.
* 1316 (4-6-2), formerly located at Fort Concho, Texas: the sole survivor of the 1309 class was restored to operating condition by the Texas State Railroad in the early 1980s as its No. 500. It is currently displayed at Palestine for another restoration for future excursion service.
* 2913 (4-8-4), located in Riverview Park at Fort Madison, Iowa.
* 2926 (4-8-4), formerly located in Coronado Park in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This locomotive had been undergoing restoration for operational purposes by New Mexico Heritage Rail, which has expended 114,000 man-hours and $1,700,000 in donated funds on its restoration since 2002. It was restored in July 2021. Performed her first mainline travel on September 30, 2023.
* 3415 (4-6-2), formerly located at Eisenhower Park in Abilene, Kansas, until it was acquired by the Abilene and Smoky Valley Railroad and has been restored for excursion service since 2009. The locomotive is expected to be taken out of service for a 15 year boiler inspection later in 2023.
* 3416 (4-6-2), currently preserved at Great Bend, Kansas.
* 3417 (4-6-2), formerly preserved at Hulen Park, in Cleburne, Texas.
* 3423 (4-6-2), located at the Railroad &amp; Heritage Museum in Temple Texas, it is currently preserved.
* 3424 (4-6-2), Preserved in Kinsley, Kansas.
* 3450 (4-6-4), the sole survivor of the 3450 class, this locomotive is the gateway of the RailGiants Train Museum in Pomona, California.
* 3463 (4-6-4), the sole survivor of the 3460 class, this locomotive is located at the Kansas Expocentre in Topeka, Kansas, awaiting a cosmetic restoration.
* 3751 (4-8-4), the Santa Fe&#x27;s and Baldwin&#x27;s very first 4-8-4, was once on display at Viaduct Park near the AT&amp;SF depot in San Bernardino, California. The locomotive was moved out of the park in 1986 to be restored and, after almost 5 years later, No. 3751 made its first run on a 4-day trip from Los Angeles to Bakersfield and return in December 1991. This trip marked the beginning of No. 3751&#x27;s career in excursion service. Beginning in 2017, 3751 underwent a federally required 15-year overhaul until September 2022. On the same month, it&#x27;s federally required 15-year overhaul was complete, and after that, it attended the Amtrak Track Safety Event in Fullerton, California, on September 24, 2022, and September 25, 2022.
* 3759 (4-8-4): This locomotive is known for pulling the &quot;Farewell to Steam Excursion&quot; for the Santa Fe in 1955 before it was donated to the City of Kingman, Arizona, where it is currently on static display. It was almost acquired by the Grand Canyon Railway in the early 1990s.
* 3768 (4-8-4), after retiring in 1958, it was donated to the city of Wichita, Kansas, where it is currently preserved at the Great Plains Museum of Transportation.
* 5000 &quot;Madame Queen&quot; (2-10-4), the second-oldest preserved steam locomotive with a 2-10-4 wheel arrangement, &quot;Madame Queen&quot; is located in Amarillo, Texas, awaiting possible relocation elsewhere.
* 5011 (2-10-4), the first of the 5011 class, is on static display at the National Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri.
* 5017 (2-10-4), located at the National Railroad Museum in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
* 9005 (0-6-0), located in the historic train depot in Clovis, New Mexico
*5704 (EMD SD45-2): After being removed from active service by BNSF, it was saved from being scrapped thanks to the efforts of Stephen Priest, a Kansas City railroad historian, and Eric Goodman, a member of BNSF management, who got the company to donate the locomotive to the Southern California Railroad Museum in Perris. After being repainted in the Bicentennial scheme at the Mid-America Car and Locomotive shops in Kansas City, and a public presentation at the Union Station located in the same City, the locomotive was taken to Los Angeles, and finally to Perris, where the Museum is taking care of the final details to get it back in operation.

== Ferry service ==

Santa Fe maintained and operated a fleet of three passenger ferry boats (the &quot;San Pablo&quot;, the &quot;San Pedro&quot;, and the &quot;Ocean Wave&quot;) that connected Richmond, California, with San Francisco by water. The ships traveled the eight miles between the San Francisco Ferry Terminal and the railroad&#x27;s Point Richmond terminal across San Francisco Bay. The service was originally established as a continuation of the company&#x27;s named passenger train runs such as the &quot;Angel&quot; and the &quot;Saint&quot;. The larger two ships (the &quot;San Pablo&quot; and the &quot;San Pedro&quot;) carried Fred Harvey Company dining facilities.

Rival SP owned the world&#x27;s largest ferry fleet (which was subsidized by other railroad activities), at its peak carrying 40 million passengers and 60 million vehicles annually aboard 43 vessels. Santa Fe discontinued ferry service in 1933 due to the effects of the Great Depression and routed their trains to Southern Pacific&#x27;s ferry terminal in Oakland. The San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge opened in 1936, initiating a slow decline in demand for SP&#x27;s ferry service, which was eventually discontinued ; starting in 1938, SF-bound passengers could board buses across the bridge at the Santa Fe Oakland depot (located in Emeryville).

The Warsaw University of Technology has about 5,000 graduates per year. According to the 2008 &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot; newspaper survey, engineers govern Polish companies. Warsaw Tech alums make up the highest percentage of Polish managers and executives. Every ninth president among the top 500 corporations in Poland is a graduate of the Warsaw University of Technology. Professor Kurnik, the rector, explained that the school provides a solid basis for the performance of managers by equipping its students with an education at the highest level and a preparation with the tools and information, including knowledge of foreign languages.

The origins of Warsaw University of Technology date back to 1826 when engineering education was begun in the Warsaw Institute of Technology.

In 2018, Times Higher Education ranked the university within the global 601–800 band.

==History ==
=== 1826–1831 ===
The origins of Polish universities of technology go back to the 18th century. They were related to either military technology or mining, which demanded complicated technological processes as a result of the exploitation of deeper seams. The model school of technology, a university of technology, was designed by the French, who in 1794 founded the Ecole polytechnique, in Paris. In the beginning of the 19th century, universities of technology were opened in Prague (in 1806), Vienna (1815), and Karlsruhe (1824).

In Poland, the first multidisciplinary university of technology was the Preparatory School for the Institute of Technology, which opened on 4 January 1826. The Warsaw University of Technology still cultivates its traditions. The man who played the most important part in creating the school and writing its charter was Stanisław Staszic. Kajetan Garbiński, a mathematician and Warsaw University professor became the director. The school was closed in 1831, after the November Insurrection.

=== 1898–1914 ===
In 1898, the Technological Section of the Warsaw Society for Russian Commerce and Industry, whose director was engineer Kazimierz Obrębowicz, collected funds for the opening of Emperor Nicolas II University of Technology. Classes, with Russian as the language of instruction, started on 5 September in the building at 81 Marszałkowska Street. They were soon moved to new buildings, built especially for the institute. They were designed by Bronisław Rogóyski and Stefan Szyller.

On the day of its opening, the university had three faculties: Mathematics, Chemistry, as well as Engineering and Construction. In June 1902, the Faculty of Mining was opened. Poles constituted the majority of students until 1905 when their number reached 1,100.

=== 1915–1939 ===

After German troops entered Warsaw on 5 August 1915, they wanted to gain the sympathy of Poles and allowed University of Warsaw and the Warsaw University of Technology to open with Polish as the language of instruction. The grand opening of both universities was held on 15 November 1915. Zygmunt Straszewicz was the first rector of the Warsaw University of Technology. World War I, together with the events connected with the restitution of the Polish State and the Polish-Bolshevik war, did not help the development of the school. Daily lectures only started in November 1920. The school taught the young future engineers at the faculties of Mechanics, Electrical Engineering, Chemistry, Architecture, Civil Engineering, Aquatic Engineering, and Geodesy (or, since 1925, Measuring). The last three faculties were merged on the basis of the new Academic Schools Law of 13 March 1933. The Polish Cabinet issued a decree on 25 September 1933, in which the new Faculty of Engineering was created.

The number of the Warsaw University of Technology students in the 20 years between the wars grew from 2,540 in the 1918/1919 academic year to 4,673 just before the outbreak of World War II. In the same period, the school granted more than 6,200 diplomas, including 320 for women. The Warsaw University of Technology became the most important scientific centre of engineering in Poland and gained international prestige. At that time, 66 graduates earned Doctor of Philosophy degrees, and 50 qualified as assistant professors. The university was a centre of scientific research for people whose achievements were fundamental for world science and technology, including Karol Adamiecki, Stefan Bryła, Jan Czochralski, Tytus Maksymilian Huber, Janusz Groszkowski, Mieczysław Wolfke and many others.

=== 1939–1945 ===
During World War II, despite enormous material losses and repressive measures, the Warsaw University of Technology continued to operate underground. Teaching continued in clandestine and open courses, in vocational schools, and from 1942, in a two-year State Higher Technical School. Approximately 3,000 students took part in the clandestine courses and 198 earned engineer diplomas. Scientific research was conducted, as 20 PhD and 14 assistant-professorship qualifying theses were written. Considerable work served the reconstruction of Poland after the war and constitute the foundation for the development of science. Students and professors secretly worked on projects. Professors Janusz Groszkowski, Marceli Struszyński, and Józef Zawadzki conducted a detailed analysis of the radio and steering devices of the German V-2 rockets, at the request of Polish Home Army Intelligence.

=== 1945–present ===

After German troops were dislodged from Warsaw, classes started in improvised conditions on 22 January 1945. By the end of the year, all the pre-war faculties were re-opened. Old and war-damaged buildings were rebuilt quickly; new ones were erected. In 1951 the Warsaw University of Technology incorporated the Wawelberg and Rotwand&#x27;s School of Engineering.

The Academic and Research Centre in Płock was created in 1967.

In 1945 there were 2,148 students in six faculties (divisions). By 1999 there were 22,000 students enrolled in 16 faculties. The Warsaw University of Technology granted over 104,000 Bachelor of Science and Master of Science engineer degrees between the years 1945 and 1998.

Over the years, the university was an important scientific centre, educating academic staff for its own purposes and for other Polish schools of technology. Between 1945 and 1998, 5,500 PhD theses were written. There were almost 1,100 theses qualifying for assistant professorships. The number of academic staff grew significantly. In 1938, the university had 98 tenured professors and associate professors, as well as 307 assistant professors and teaching assistants; in 1948 there were 87 and 471; while in 1999 there were 371 professors, 1,028 tutors, 512 lecturers, and 341 teaching assistants.

== Geography ==
Bosque Santa Clara is a coastal forest of the La Paz Department, to the east of the town of Playa El Pimental.

==Dance and traditions==

This department is one of the oldest in the country; hence it adopted many of ancestral customs and dances including “The Tiger and the Deer”, &quot;The Ascension Bulls”, “The Levers of Santa Cruz”, and others.

The dance of The Tiger and the Deer goes back to 1868, when San Juan Nonualco was inhabited by natives that lived off the hunting of deer that were plentiful in the area. However, there was a tiger that devoured the animals. The dance presents the story of a married couple that left to hunt the tiger; however, he was attacked by the animal and he had to request aid to some timber men that were close and to beg to the Señor de la Caridad, protector of the municipality, to save them of the danger. The hunters killed the tiger. The dance is carried out in the party of May 2. It consists of four characters: “the old ones” that represent the couple that go with the shotgun and the bow; the tiger and the Lord of the drum that mark the steps of the dance. The spectators watch when the tiger attacks the old ones, but these behead it. The most amusing part is the “repartition” of the portions of the animal, which is called “behead the priest”, “the forehead for Vicente”, “the head for Teresa”... until all the residents are beheaded.

The Ascension Bulls tradition belongs to San Juan Nonualco. It speaks of a character called Isidro Labrador. They tell that on Thursday of Ascension, the day that celebrates Christ&#x27;s ascent to Heaven, Isidro began to work the field and when he arrived to the oxen, he heard one of them say: “Isidro, today we won&#x27;t work”. He fell on his knees, begging forgiveness to God for not having remembered the date. Based on this event, the celebration is kept on Thursday of Ascension like the day dedicated to the bulls. In the six neighborhoods of San Juan Nonualco, the inhabitants manufacture a bull that they walk through the streets. The hermitages are adorned with altars and the Rosario is prayed. When concluding the prayer, the competition or fights of the bulls begin.

===Food traditions===
Among the typical food that you can find there is the atol, made from cashews. This atol has been done in the same manner, transmitted from generation to generation, for about 20 years. Some common dishes include pupusas, empanadas de leche or frijoles (banana on the outside and inside is pureed milk or beans).

<doc id="728092" wikidata="Q7873028" url="?curid=728092" title="USS Porpoise (SS-172)">
<text>USS &quot;Porpoise&quot; (SS–172), the fifth United States Navy ship to bear her name, was the lead ship of her class of submarines.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Porpoise&quot; was laid down at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, on 27 October 1933. She was launched on 20 June 1935, sponsored by Miss Eva Croft, and commissioned on 15 August 1935, Lieutenant Commander Stuart S. Murray in command.

==Service history==

===Inter-War Period===
After shakedown, &quot;Porpoise&quot; transited the Panama Canal and joined the Pacific Fleet at San Diego on 1 September 1936. After gunnery and torpedo practice off the west coast of the United States, she participated in Fleet Problem XVIII in the Hawaiian area, April–May 1937, and toward the end of the year underwent extensive overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard. In January 1938, she returned to Pearl Harbor for fleet exercises, and on 19 November 1939 got underway for Manila to join the Asiatic Fleet. From December 1939-December 1941, she was engaged in various exercises with Submarines, Asiatic Fleet.

===World War II===
At the outbreak of the war with Japan with the japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 
1941, &quot;Porpoise&quot;, commanded by Joseph A. Callaghan, was at Olongapo in the Philippine Islands, undergoing a refit. With all four main engines being overhauled and her entire after battery out, the required work was accomplished in record time. She moved to Manila on 20 December, and two days later was underway on her first war patrol - which lasted from 22 December 1941 to 31 January 1942 - in Lingayen Gulf and the South China Sea off French Indochina. Retiring by way of Balikpapan, Borneo, where the Dutch were demolishing their oil wells, &quot;Porpoise&quot; attacked two ships without result before ending her patrol at Surabaya, Java.

Conducting her second war patrol in the Netherlands East Indies from 9 February to 30 March 1942, &quot;Porpoise&quot; scored on a cargo ship before anchoring at Fremantle, Western Australia. Then, with the ultimate destination of Pearl Harbor, she returned to the Netherlands East Indies for her third war patrol, which lasted from 26 April to 17 June 1942. She made one unsuccessful attack on a cargo ship and rescued five airmen off the enemy held island of Ju before heading out across the Pacific.

After a major overhaul at Mare Island, &quot;Porpoise&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for her fourth war patrol - from 30 November 1942 to 15 January 1943 - off the coast of Honshū, Japan. On 1 January 1943, she sank &quot;Renzan Maru&quot;, then set course for Midway where she completed the patrol. Her fifth war patrol - which lasted from 6 February to 15 April 1943 - off Jaluit Atoll, was highlighted by the sinking of &quot;Koa Maru&quot; on 4 April.

After refit at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Porpoise&quot; sailed on her sixth patrol - which lasted from 20 June to 28 July 1943 - performing reconnaissance of Taroa Island and in the Marshall Islands. Scoring hits on two cargo ships early in her patrol, she then sank &quot;Mikage Maru No. 20&quot; on 19 July 1943 before returning to Pearl Harbor.

Due to leaky fuel oil tanks &quot;Porpoise&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 12 August 1943 bound for New London, Connecticut, where she was to be used as a training vessel. During her voyage, an Allied tanker mistakenly opened gunfire on her in the Pacific Ocean on 13 August 1943, but &quot;Porpoise&quot; maneuvered away southward on the surface and sustained no damage. She arrived at New London in September 1943, and interrupted only for overhaul at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from May to June 1944, she served on training duty there until inactivated. She decommissioned on 15 November 1945 at Boston, Massachusetts, and remained in reserve until 8 May 1947, when she was placed in service and assigned to the 8th Naval District. For the next nine years she trained United States Naval Reserve personnel in the Houston, Texas, area. Stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 August 1956, she was sold for scrap to Southern Scrap Material Company, Ltd., of New Orleans, Louisiana, on 14 May 1957.

<doc id="728093" wikidata="Q189947" url="?curid=728093" title="Nick Clegg">
<text>Sir Nicholas William Peter Clegg (born 7 January 1967) is a British retired politician and media executive who served as Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2015 and as Leader of the Liberal Democrats from 2007 to 2015. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Sheffield Hallam from 2005 to 2017. An &quot;Orange Book&quot; liberal, he has been associated with both socially liberal and economically liberal policies.

Born in Buckinghamshire, Clegg was educated at Westminster School before going on to study at the University of Cambridge, University of Minnesota and College of Europe. He worked as a journalist for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; before becoming a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) in 1999. After his election to the House of Commons in 2005, Clegg served in a variety of leadership roles in the Liberal Democrats, most notably as spokesperson for Home Affairs, before being elected to succeed Menzies Campbell as party leader in 2007. During his tenure as leader, Clegg said that the Liberal Democrats had transcended left and right-wing politics and described the party as radical centrist. He supported reduced taxes, electoral reform, cuts on defence spending and an increased focus on environmental issues.

As a result of the 2010 general election, Clegg&#x27;s Liberal Democrats found themselves with 57 seats in the House of Commons. The Conservative Party, which failed to receive a majority, formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, and Clegg was appointed by Conservative leader David Cameron to serve as his Deputy Prime Minister. In this capacity, he became the first leader of the Liberal Democrats to answer for the Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, and used his influence in the position to pass the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. Controversy arose during this time surrounding the Liberal Democrats&#x27; decision to abandon their pledge to oppose increases in tuition fees, which had previously been a key issue that won the party support from students. During the party&#x27;s time in coalition, the Liberal Democrats saw a significant drop in support, and the 2015 general election left the party with just 8 seats, which resulted in Clegg&#x27;s ousting as Deputy Prime Minister and his resignation as party leader.

In 2016, following a referendum in which a majority supported leaving the European Union, Clegg returned to the Liberal Democrat frontbench, concurrently serving as Spokesperson for Exiting the European Union and for International Trade from July 2016 to June 2017. In the 2017 general election, Clegg was defeated in his constituency of Sheffield Hallam by Jared O&#x27;Mara of the Labour Party. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for political and public service.

Clegg left politics after losing his seat and relocated to the United States, where in October 2018 he became vicepresident of global affairs and communications at Facebook, Inc. (renamed Meta Platforms in 2021). He was promoted to president for global affairs in 2022. Clegg announced he would step down from the role and leave Meta in 2025.

==Early life and family==

Nick Clegg was born in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, the third of four children of Hermance van den Wall Bake and Nicholas Peter Clegg, chairman of United Trust Bank and a former trustee of the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation (where Ken Clarke was an adviser).

Clegg has one-quarter Baltic-German ancestry. His paternal grandmother, Baroness Kira von Engelhardt, of Smolensk, was a Baltic-German noblewoman, niece of Moura Budberg, adventuress and suspected double agent, and the granddaughter of attorney general of the Imperial Russian Senate, Ignatiy Platonovich Zakrevsky. Through this Russian connection, Clegg is distantly related to Michael Ignatieff, leader of the Liberal Party of Canada from 2008 to 2011.

His English grandfather was Hugh Anthony Clegg, editor of the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; for 35 years.

Clegg&#x27;s mother is Dutch and was interned, along with her family, by the Japanese military in Batavia (Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) during the Second World War. She met Clegg&#x27;s father during a visit to England in 1956, and they married on 1 August 1959.

Clegg is multilingual. He speaks English, French, Dutch, German, and Spanish. His background has informed his politics. He says, &quot;There is simply not a shred of racism in me, as a person whose whole family is formed by flight from persecution, from different people in different generations. It&#x27;s what I am. It&#x27;s one of the reasons I am a liberal.&quot; His Dutch mother instilled in him &quot;a degree of scepticism about the entrenched class configurations in British society&quot;.

==Education==

Clegg was educated at two private schools: at Caldicott School in Farnham Royal in South Buckinghamshire, where he was joint Head Prefect in 1980, and later at Westminster School in Central London. As a 16-year-old exchange student in Munich, he and a friend drunkenly set fire to what he called &quot;the leading collection of cacti in Germany&quot;. When news of the incident was reported during his time as Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesperson, Clegg said he was &quot;not proud&quot; of it. He was arrested and not formally charged, but performed a type of community service.

Clegg spent a gap year working as a skiing instructor in Austria, before going on to Cambridge in 1986, where he studied Archaeology and Anthropology at Robinson College. He was active in the student theatre, acting in a production of &quot;The Normal Heart&quot; under the director Sam Mendes. He was also captain of his college&#x27;s tennis team, and campaigned for the human rights organisation Survival International. Clegg spent the summer of 1989 as an office junior in Postipankki bank in Helsinki.

It has been alleged that Clegg joined the Cambridge University Conservative Association between 1986 and 1987. Clegg has maintained he has &quot;no recollection of that whatsoever&quot;. However, Conservative MP Greg Hands has a record of CUCA members for 1986–1987, and Clegg&#x27;s name appears on the list. Hands noted that &quot;for the avoidance of any doubt, there was only one &#x27;N Clegg&#x27; at Robinson College ... [he] is listed in the &#x27;Robinson College Record&#x27;, under &#x27;Freshmen 1986&#x27;. He graduated with an upper second class honours (2:1) degree in social anthropology.

After university, he was awarded a scholarship to study for a year at the University of Minnesota, where he wrote a thesis on the political philosophy of the Deep Green movement. He then moved to New York City, where he worked as an intern under Christopher Hitchens at &quot;The Nation&quot;, a progressive liberal magazine, where he fact-checked Hitchens&#x27;s articles.

Clegg next moved to Brussels, where he worked alongside Guy Spier for six months as a trainee in the G24 coordination unit which delivered aid to the countries of the former Soviet Union. After the internship he studied for a master&#x27;s degree at the College of Europe in Bruges, a university for European studies in Belgium, where he met his wife, Miriam González Durántez, a lawyer and the daughter of a Spanish senator. Nick Clegg is an alumnus of the &quot;Mozart Promotion&quot; (1991–92) of the College of Europe.

==Careers before politics==
Between 1992 and 1993, he was employed by GJW Government Relations Ltd, which lobbied on behalf of Libya.

In 1993, Clegg won the inaugural &quot;Financial Times&quot;″ David Thomas Prize, in remembrance of an &quot;FT&quot; journalist killed on assignment in Kuwait in 1991. He was later sent to Hungary, where he wrote articles about the mass privatisation of industries in the former communist bloc.

He took up a post at the European Commission in April 1994, working in the TACIS aid programme to the former Soviet Union. For two years, Clegg was responsible for developing direct aid programmes in Central Asia and the Caucasus worth €50 million. He was involved in negotiations with Russia on airline overflight rights, and launched a conference in Tashkent in 1993 that founded TRACECA—an international transport programme for the development of a transport corridor for Europe, the Caucasus and Asia. Vice-President and Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan then offered him a job in his private office, as a European Union policy adviser and speechwriter. As part of this role, Clegg was in charge of the EC negotiating team on Chinese and Russian accession talks to the World Trade Organization.

===Written publications===
Clegg has written extensively, publishing and contributing to a large number of pamphlets and books. With Dr Richard Grayson he wrote a book in 2002 about the importance of devolution in secondary education systems, based on comparative research across Europe. The final conclusions included the idea of pupil premiums so that children from poorer backgrounds receive the additional resources their educational needs require.

He wrote a controversial pamphlet for the Centre for European Reform advocating devolution and evolution of the European Union, and contributed to the 2004 &quot;Orange Book&quot;, where he offered market liberal solutions for reform of European institutions. He co-authored a pamphlet with Duncan Brack arguing for a wholesale reform of world trade rules to allow room for a greater emphasis on development, internationally binding environmental treaties, and parliamentary democracy within the WTO system.

==Member of the European Parliament (1999–2004)==
In 1998, Clegg was selected as the lead Liberal Democrat candidate for the European Parliament in the East Midlands constituency; the following year, Paddy Ashdown was first to tip him as a politician to watch. On his election in 1999, he was the first Liberal parliamentarian elected in the East Midlands since Ernest Pickering was elected MP for Leicester West in 1931, and was credited with helping to significantly boost the Liberal Democrat poll rating in the region in the six months after his election. Clegg worked extensively during his time as an MEP to support the party in the region, not least in Chesterfield where Paul Holmes was elected as MP in 2001. Clegg helped persuade Conservative MEP Bill Newton Dunn to defect to the Liberal Democrats, with Newton Dunn subsequently succeeding him as MEP for the East Midlands.

As an MEP, Clegg co-founded the Campaign for Parliamentary Reform, which led calls for reforms to expenses, transparency and accountability in the European Parliament. He was made Trade and Industry spokesman for the European Liberal Democrat and Reform group (ELDR). In December 2000, Nick Clegg became the Parliament&#x27;s Draftsman on a complex new EU telecoms law relating to &quot;local loop unbundling&quot;—opening-up telephone networks across Europe to competition. Clegg decided to leave Brussels in 2002, arguing in an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper that the battle to persuade the public of the benefits of Europe was being fought at home, not in Brussels.

In 2004, Clegg explained to the Select Committee on European Union that the aim of MEPs like himself, who had been active in the debate on the EU&#x27;s negotiating mandate, was to obtain the right to ratify any major WTO deal entered into by the European Union. That same year he chaired a policy working group for the Liberal Democrats on the Third Age, which focused on the importance of ending the cliff-edge of retirement and providing greater opportunities for older people to remain active beyond retirement. The group developed initial proposals on transforming post offices to help them survive as community hubs, in particular for older people. He served on Charles Kennedy&#x27;s policy review, &quot;Meeting the Challenge&quot;, and the &quot;It&#x27;s About Freedom&quot; working parties.

Clegg, for four years whilst an MEP, wrote a fortnightly column for &quot;Guardian Unlimited&quot;. One particular article in 2002 accused Gordon Brown of encouraging &quot;condescension&quot; towards Germany. In an article, Clegg wrote that &quot;all nations have a cross to bear, and none more so than Germany with its memories of Nazism. But the British cross is more insidious still. A misplaced sense of superiority, sustained by delusions of grandeur and a tenacious obsession with the last war, is much harder to shake off&quot;. The article was dusted down during the 2010 general election campaign when the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; interpreted the article as being a &quot;Nazi slur on Britain&quot; and Clegg had begun to feel the full heat of the British tabloid press following his success during the first leaders&#x27; debate.

==Parliamentary candidate==
On leaving the European Parliament, Clegg joined political lobbying firm GPlus in April 2004 as a fifth partner:

Clegg worked on GPlus clients including The Hertz Corporation and British Gas.

In May 2003, Richard Allan, the then Liberal Democrat MP for Sheffield Hallam, announced his intention to stand down from the House of Commons. Clegg was selected as the prospective parliamentary candidate. He took up a part-time teaching position in the politics department of the University of Sheffield, combining it with ongoing EU consultancy work with GPlus. He also gave a series of seminar lectures in the international relations Department of the University of Cambridge.

==Member of Parliament (2005–2017)==
Clegg worked closely with Allan throughout the campaign in Sheffield Hallam—including starring in a local pantomime—and won the seat in the 2005 general election with over 50% of the vote, and a majority of 8,682. This result represents one of the smallest swings away from a party in a seat where an existing MP has been succeeded by a newcomer (4.3%). He also served as treasurer and secretary of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on National Parks, a particular interest given that his constituency includes part of the Peak District National Park.

Following his election to parliament, Clegg was promoted by leader Charles Kennedy to be the party&#x27;s spokesperson on Europe, focusing on the party&#x27;s preparations for an expected referendum on the European constitution and acting as deputy to Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Menzies Campbell. Clegg&#x27;s ability to articulate liberal values at a very practical level quickly lent him prominence, with many already seeing him as a future Liberal Democrat leader. Following the resignation of Kennedy on 7 January 2006, Clegg was touted as a possible leadership contender. He was quick to rule himself out however instead declaring his support for Menzies Campbell ahead of his former colleague in the European Parliament Chris Huhne, with Campbell going on to win the ballot. Clegg had been a signatory to the letter circulated by Vince Cable prior to Kennedy&#x27;s resignation, which stated his opposition to working under Kennedy&#x27;s continued leadership.

===Liberal Democrats&#x27; Home Affairs spokesperson===
Following the 2006 leadership election, Clegg was promoted to be Home Affairs spokesperson, replacing Mark Oaten. In this job he spearheaded the Liberal Democrats&#x27; defence of civil liberties, proposing a Freedom Bill to repeal what he described as &quot;unnecessary and illiberal legislation&quot;, campaigning against Identity Cards and the retention of innocent people&#x27;s DNA, and arguing against excessive counter-terrorism legislation. He has campaigned for prison reform, a liberal approach to immigration, and defended the Human Rights Act against ongoing attacks from across the political spectrum. In January 2007, Clegg launched the &#x27;We Can Cut Crime!&#x27; campaign, &quot;proposing real action at a national level and acting to cut crime where the Liberal Democrats are in power locally&quot;.

===Sir Menzies Campbell&#x27;s resignation===
Clegg caused a degree of controversy when, at the Liberal Democrat party conference in 2007, he admitted his leadership ambitions to journalists at a fringe event. The admission followed a period of increased media speculation about Sir Menzies Campbell&#x27;s leadership, which the admission by Clegg did nothing to reduce and resulted in a rebuke by some of his frontbench colleagues. This followed a report from Kevin Maguire in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; that Clegg had failed to hide his disloyalty to Campbell&#x27;s leadership. Campbell eventually resigned on 15 October 2007, saying that questions about his leadership were &quot;getting in the way of further progress by the party&quot;.

==Leader of the Liberal Democrats (2007–2015)==

===Election to the leadership===

After Campbell&#x27;s resignation, Clegg was regarded by much of the media as front-runner in the leadership election. The BBC&#x27;s Political Editor Nick Robinson stated the election would be a two-horse race between Clegg and Chris Huhne who had stood against Campbell in the 2006 election. On Friday 19 October 2007, Clegg launched his bid to become leader of the Liberal Democrats. Clegg and Huhne clashed in the campaign over Trident but were largely in agreement on many other issues. It was announced on 18 December that he had won. Clegg was appointed to the Privy Council (PC) on 30 January 2008, and affirmed his membership on 12 March 2008.

In his acceptance speech upon winning the leadership contest, Clegg declared himself to be &quot;a liberal by temperament, by instinct and by upbringing&quot; and that he believes &quot;Britain [is] a place of tolerance and pluralism&quot;. He has stated that he feels &quot;a profound antagonism for prejudice of all sorts&quot;. He declared his priorities as: defending civil liberties; devolving the running of public services to parents, pupils and patients; and protecting the environment.

In an interview on BBC Radio 5 Live on the morning after his election to the leadership, Clegg stated that he does not believe in God, but that he has &quot;an immense amount of respect for people of faith&quot;. In 2010, Clegg elaborated on this question, stating: &quot;I was asked a question once in one of those questions where you&#x27;re only allowed to answer &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27;, and I was asked &#x27;Do you believe in God?&#x27; As it happens I don&#x27;t know whether God exists. I&#x27;m much more of an agnostic.&quot;

Clegg resigned as the leader of the Liberal Democrats after the 2015 general election. He said the results were &quot;immeasurably more crushing and unkind than he feared&quot;. He was succeeded by Tim Farron after a leadership election.

====&quot;GQ&quot; magazine interview controversy====
In March 2008, &quot;GQ&quot; magazine ran with an interview conducted by Piers Morgan in which Clegg admitted to sleeping with &quot;no more than 30&quot; women. Senior Lib Dem MPs defended his comments; Lembit Öpik said it showed &quot;you can be a human being and a party Leader&quot;, and Norman Lamb that &quot;Nick tries to be absolutely straight in everything that he does, and that might sometimes get him into trouble but he will build a reputation for being honest and straightforward.&quot; Speaking to the BBC about the interview Clegg said &quot;wisdom with hindsight is an easy thing&quot; as what had been a split second response had been &quot;taken out of context, interpreted, over interpreted and so on&quot;.

===Relationships with the frontbench===
Upon his election Clegg appointed leadership rival Huhne as his replacement as Home Affairs spokesperson and following his strong performances as acting party leader, Vince Cable was retained as the main Treasury spokesperson. Media commentators noted that the Clegg-Huhne-Cable triumvirate provided the Liberal Democrats with an effective political team for the coming years. On 5 March 2008, Clegg suffered a real test following the resignation of three of his front bench team. David Heath, Alistair Carmichael and Tim Farron had been told to abstain in the vote for a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty but had wanted to vote in favour and so defied the whip. In addition to the three frontbenchers, a further 12 more backbench LibDem MPs also defied the whip and voted &quot;yes&quot;. Clegg said &quot;though we have disagreed on this issue I fully understand and respect their strongly held views on the subject... However, as they have recognised, the shadow cabinet cannot operate effectively unless the principle of collective responsibility is maintained.&quot;

The resignations happened not long after Michael Martin, the Speaker of the House of Commons, had on 26 February 2008 blocked calls by the Liberal Democrats for an &quot;in or out&quot; referendum on Britain&#x27;s EU membership. The Speaker&#x27;s authority was called into question when, led by Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrats marched out of the House of Commons, calling the Speaker&#x27;s decision a constitutional &quot;outrage&quot;. Just moments earlier, frontbench foreign affairs spokesman for the party Ed Davey had been expelled from the chamber by the Speaker&#x27;s deputy, Sir Michael Lord, for further challenging the ruling.

In November 2008, Clegg suffered more allegations of difficulties with the front bench following an article in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; that reported that Clegg had criticised senior members of his front bench whilst on a plane journey. He told the BBC&#x27;s Politics Show that &quot;a lot of it is, frankly, fiction&quot;.

===Attitudes to other parties===
In the Commons, Clegg initially concentrated most of his fire on Labour and Prime Minister Gordon Brown, but in the autumn of 2009 began also focusing on David Cameron and the Conservatives. Clegg rejected an appeal from Cameron for their two parties to work together. Clegg argued that the Conservatives were totally different from his party, and that the Lib Dems were the true &quot;progressives&quot; in UK politics. At the 2009 party conference in Bournemouth, he accused the Conservatives of &quot;simply believing it is their turn&quot; and claimed that come the election the &quot;choice before people is the choice between fake, phoney change from Cameron&#x27;s Conservatives, and real change the Liberal Democrats offer&quot;.

===Parliamentary expenses===

Clegg became the first party leader in modern political history to call for a Speaker of the House of Commons to resign, describing then-Speaker Michael Martin, following his handling of the expenses scandal, as a defender of the status quo and an obstacle to the reform of Parliament.

In response to revelations about MPs&#x27; expenses, Clegg set out his plans for reform of Parliament in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Speaking about the plans, he said: &quot;let us bar the gates of Westminster and stop MPs leaving for their summer holidays until this crisis has been sorted out, and every nook and cranny of our political system has been reformed.&quot; He argued for the &quot;reinvention of British politics&quot; within 100 days, calling for a commitment to accept the Kelly expenses report in full; the power to recall members suspended for misconduct; House of Lords reform; reform of party funding; fixed-term parliaments; enabling legislation for a referendum on AV+; and changes to House of Commons procedure to reduce executive power.

Shortly ahead of the election, Clegg was asked about his own expenses by Andrew Neil of the BBC. Clegg allegedly claimed the full amount permissible under the Additional Cost Allowance, including claims for food, gardening and redecorating his second home. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; also said Clegg claimed £80 for international call charges, a claim he said he would repay.

===Perspective===
Clegg aimed to modernise the Liberal Democrat Party at the same time as maintaining its traditions of political and philosophical liberalism. In 2011, he told a party conference that the Liberal Democrats were radical centrist in orientation: &quot;Our opponents try to divide us with their outdated labels of left and right. But we are not on the left and we are not on the right. We have our own label: Liberal. We are liberals and we own the freehold to the centre ground of British politics. Our politics is the politics of the radical centre.&quot;

===Policies===
When he became leader of the Liberal Democrats, Clegg called for more choice for patients on waiting lists in the National Health Service (NHS), giving them the option to go private and to be funded by the NHS if they wish; a substantial tax cut to &quot;put more money back into the pockets of people&quot;, better action on the environment, the abandonment of Britain&#x27;s Trident missile-defence system, fixed-term parliaments; devolving more power to local councils; giving constituents the power to force a by-election if their MP was found responsible for serious wrongdoing; and a slimming of government across the board. Clegg campaigned to cut spending on defence projects such as Eurofighter as well as the UK Trident programme. As regards public spending, at the party&#x27;s 2009 conference in Bournemouth Clegg argued for &quot;savage&quot; spending cuts and said politicians need to treat voters &quot;like grown ups&quot; whilst accusing the Labour and Conservative parties of indulging in &quot;childish games&quot; over the &quot;c-word&quot;.

===Gurkha campaign===
On 29 April 2009 the Liberal Democrats proposed in the House of Commons to offer all Gurkhas an equal right of residence; the motion resulted in a defeat for the Government by 267 votes to 246. It was the only first day motion defeat for a government since 1978. On speaking about the result Clegg said &quot;this is an immense victory [...] for the rights of Gurkhas who have been waiting so long for justice, a victory for Parliament, a victory for decency&quot;. He added that it was &quot;the kind of thing people want this country to do&quot;.

On 21 May 2009, the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced that all Gurkha veterans who retired before 1997 with at least four years&#x27; service could settle in the UK. The actress and daughter of Gurkha corps Major James Lumley, Joanna Lumley, who had highlighted the treatment of the Gurkhas and campaigned for their rights, commented: &quot;This is the welcome we have always longed to give&quot;.

==Deputy Prime Minister (2010–2015)==
The morning after the 2010 general election presented the country with no single political party able to form a government that would command a majority in the House of Commons. In light of this reality, Cameron went public and gave a &quot;big, open and comprehensive offer&quot; to the Liberal Democrats&#x27; leader and said that he wanted to open up negotiations with them to form Britain&#x27;s first coalition government since Winston Churchill&#x27;s war ministry during the Second World War. In reply, Clegg said that he had always maintained that the party with the most seats and the most votes should have the right to seek to govern. Clegg, as Deputy Prime Minister, took Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions (PMQs) when Cameron was unavailable.

Following the announcement, teams of negotiators from both parties formulated what would become the Coalition Agreement which would form the basis of their partnership together. Gordon Brown&#x27;s resignation on 11 May 2010 meant that Cameron was invited by the Queen to form a government and a coalition with the Liberal Democrats was agreed, with Clegg as the Deputy Prime Minister and Lord President of the Council. He was also made Minister for Constitutional and Political Reform, which was a key point for the Liberal Democrats during the creation of the coalition. Of the 57 Liberal Democrat MPs, only two (Charles Kennedy and John Leech) refused to support the Conservative Coalition agreement.

On 5 July 2010, Clegg unveiled plans to have fewer MPs and to hold a referendum on the voting system so that the next general election would be contested under the Alternative Vote system. The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill if successful would see the date of the referendum set for 5 May 2011. The bill also introduced plans to reduce the number of MP&#x27;s in the House of Commons from 650 to 600, something the Labour party attacked as gerrymandering, as to do this there would need to be boundary changes. The referendum on AV was to ask voters if they wish to &quot;adopt the &#x27;alternative vote&#x27; system instead of the current &#x27;first past the post&#x27; system&quot; for electing MPs&quot;. The question required a yes or no answer. The result of the referendum was that the alternative vote proposal was defeated by a margin of 2:1.

Clegg also confirmed that the government planned to introduce legislation for five-year fixed-term parliaments, with elections to be held on the first Thursday in May of the fifth year after the previous general election, starting with 7 May 2015. The corresponding bill was presented to parliament on 22 July 2010 and the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 received Royal Assent on 15 September 2011.

On 21 July 2010, Clegg became the first Liberal Democrat leader to answer for Prime minister&#x27;s questions. He courted controversy during the exchange when at the despatch box he attacked Shadow Secretary of State for Justice and Shadow Lord Chancellor Jack Straw for the decision to invade Iraq, saying &quot;perhaps one day you could account for your role in the most disastrous decision of all, which is the illegal invasion of Iraq.&quot; Despite having long-held views about the issue, the comment was controversial, as it did not reflect the policy of the government, which was that the legality of the war in Iraq was currently being studied by the Iraq inquiry.

The issue of student financing had been considered one of the flagship policies of the Liberal Democrats with all of the party&#x27;s MPs, including Clegg, signing the Vote for Students pledge to oppose any increase in student tuition fees prior to the 2010 general election. As part of the coalition agreement the Lib Dems abandoned their pledge to oppose any increase in tuition fees but gained permission to abstain on any vote relating to the increase of tuition fees. Clegg wrote to his MPs saying that he had &quot;struggled endlessly&quot; with the issue and said that departing from the pledge he had made prior to the election would be &quot;one of the most difficult decisions of my political career&quot;. Defending recommendations of the Browne Review, Clegg said that poorer students would pay less since the income level at which students needed to earn before beginning to pay off their student loan would rise from £15,000 to £21,000. On 19 September 2012, Clegg apologised, not for breaking his pledge, but for having &quot;made a promise we weren&#x27;t absolutely sure we could deliver&quot;. The apology was parodied in a song.

On 14 October 2010, Clegg delivered a speech at a school in Chesterfield, at which he announced the government&#x27;s intention to spend £7 billion on a &#x27;fairness premium&#x27; designed to see extra support going to the poorest pupils over the course of the parliament. The package announced would provide 15 hours a week free nursery education for the poorest two-year-olds and a &#x27;pupil premium&#x27; which would be given to schools to help those pupils eligible for free school meals worth £2.5 billion a year. On 20 October 2010, the plans for the &#x27;fairness premium&#x27; were introduced by the Treasury as part of the spending review which said that the money would be introduced over the period of the review which &quot;will support the poorest in the early years and at every stage of their education&quot;.

In June 2011, Clegg proposed that more than 46 million people would be handed shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group under the &quot;people&#x27;s bank&quot; plan. The plan proposes that ordinary voters would be able to profit from any increase in the value of their shares once the Treasury has recouped taxpayers&#x27; money used for the bail-out – an offer that could eventually be worth up to £1,000 to householders. Clegg said that it was &quot;psychologically immensely important&quot; for people to be given a stake in the banks in the wake of the financial crisis.

In August 2012, after reform of the House of Lords was abandoned, Clegg said the Conservatives had defied the Coalition agreement by trying to &quot;pick and choose&quot; which items of Government policy they support. Clegg also revealed the Conservatives rejected his suggestion of a &quot;last ditch&quot; compromise to save both policies. In September 2012, Clegg formally announced that he was &quot;regrettably&quot; withdrawing proposals to reform the Lords in the face of overwhelming opposition from Conservative MPs. He signalled he would exact his revenge by refusing to sack any Liberal Democrat minister who voted against changes to MPs&#x27; boundaries – which is Government policy – in retaliation over the Lords reform débâcle. Traditionally party leaders are offered peerages when they leave the House of Commons. When asked in the House of Commons if he would take a seat in the Lords, he said: &quot;No&quot;, adding: &quot;I personally will not take a seat in an unreformed House of Lords. It just sticks in the throat.&quot;

==Opposition (2015–2017)==
Clegg retained his Sheffield Hallam seat in the 2015 election, despite a strong campaign from Labour with a 17% swing in the vote. Clegg supported the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign in the 2016 European Union membership referendum, as did all other Liberal Democrat MPs, and became the Lib Dem spokesperson for Exiting the European Union and International Trade. In the 2017 general election, Clegg was defeated in his constituency of Sheffield Hallam by Jared O&#x27;Mara of the Labour Party.

==Career after Parliament==
===Brexit===

In October 2017, Clegg wrote &quot;How to Stop Brexit (And Make Britain Great Again)&quot;, which made the case that Brexit was not inevitable.

In May 2018, he joined David Miliband and Nicky Morgan calling for a soft Brexit. The next month he appeared at a People&#x27;s Vote march in London to mark the second anniversary of the EU referendum of 2016. People&#x27;s Vote was a campaign group calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between Britain and the EU.

In July 2019, Clegg said that &quot;aggressive and regressive English nationalism&quot; had taken over the Conservative Party in their competition with Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit Party (later rebranded Reform UK) established in November 2018. When asked how he expected the next few years to unfold, Clegg told the &quot;New Statesman&quot; that &quot;the clock is now ticking for the end of the union of the United Kingdom&quot;.

===Broadcasting and media===

From January 2013 until 2015, Clegg presented a weekly radio show on LBC called &quot;Call Clegg&quot;. Initially broadcast in the London area, the programme went national along with LBC in February 2014. The programme was nominated for two Radio Academy Awards in 2014.

Between April and October 2018, Clegg fronted a podcast called &quot;Anger Management with Nick Clegg&quot;, in which he interviewed known persons about the politics of anger. Since the first episode, it has been featured in &quot;The Guardian&quot; under Podcast of the Week.

A party political broadcast in which Clegg apologised for the Liberal Democrats breaking the promise over tuition fees was remixed into a song, &quot;Nick Clegg Says I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; by The Poke and Alex Ross, and sold on iTunes as a charity single. The song charted on 23 September 2012 at number 143 in the Official UK Singles Charts before climbing to 104 the following week. In his 2010 production Dandelion Mind, comedian Bill Bailey sang &quot;Nick Clegg you don&#x27;t have to wear that dress tonight, walk the streets for money, you don&#x27;t have to sell your body to the right&quot; to the tune of &quot;Roxanne&quot;.

=== Facebook ===
In June 2018, vice-president of global affairs and communications at Facebook, Inc. Elliot Schrage resigned his position. After talks with the Facebook leadership and Richard Allan, Baron Allan of Hallam, Facebook&#x27;s Director of Policy in Europe and the Liberal Democrat MP for Sheffield Hallam before Clegg, in October 2018 Clegg was hired as a lobbyist and public relations officer, replacing Schrage as Vice-President, Global Affairs and Communications. He joined Facebook because he was &quot;convinced that the culture is changing&quot; and that &quot;lawmakers need to have a serious conversation about whether data-intensive companies allow other companies to share and use data&quot;. He admitted that the Cambridge Analytica data scandal had &quot;rocked Facebook to its very foundations&quot; and told the BBC that the company &quot;hadn&#x27;t done enough in the past&quot; in regards to data privacy.

In April 2019, Clegg was accused by Věra Jourová, European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, in a letter signed by a number of senior EU civil servants, of misunderstanding EU law, stating that proposed new Facebook guidelines on political advertising would &quot;hinder the exercise of EU electoral rights.&quot; In May 2019, he rejected calls by American presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, as well as Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes to break Facebook up, saying that Facebook was &quot;a great American success story&quot; and that &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a very American tradition to start penalizing success.&quot; In June 2019, Clegg said there was &quot;absolutely no evidence&quot; that Russia had influenced the outcome of the EU referendum using Facebook. He said that the company was working towards greater regulation of technology firms. In October 2019, Damian Collins, chair of the British House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, formally asked Clegg to explain why Facebook had exempted political statements from fact-checking guidelines.

In 2020, Clegg helped lead the creation of the Facebook Oversight Board, which reported to him, convincing former Danish Prime Minister and former College of Europe friend Helle Thorning-Schmidt to serve as its co-chair. He then played a role in Facebook&#x27;s deplatforming of U.S. President Donald Trump in mid-2021.

Ahead of the release of the whistleblown Facebook Files in October 2021, Clegg authored an internal memo saying that there was no evidence Facebook was a main cause in polarisation and that the company does not &quot;profit from polarization, in fact, just the opposite.&quot; He later posted a public statement saying that the reporting on the Files &quot;conferred egregiously false motives to Facebook&#x27;s leadership and employees,&quot; saying that it was &quot;just plain false&quot; that Facebook ignored its own internal research. After the release of the Files, he then made a number of public interviews defending the company. In one of the interviews, he stated that &quot;I can&#x27;t give you a yes or no answer&quot; when asked if Facebook played a role in amplifying extremist content ahead of the 2021 United States Capitol attack. Clegg faced criticism for his role in defending the company, with the &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist John Harris dubbing him &quot;the fall guy for Facebook&#x27;s failures&quot;. In February 2022, Clegg was promoted to president of global affairs.

In January 2025, Clegg announced he would step down from his role as president of global affairs and leave Meta within &quot;the next few months&quot;. He is set to be succeeded by his current deputy Joel Kaplan, a Republican who previously served as White House Deputy Chief of Staff under George W. Bush. The leadership change has been described as an attempt to improve Meta&#x27;s relations with Donald Trump, who is set to begin his second term as U.S. president 17 days after the announcement. At the time of the announcement, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Clegg had sold some $18.4 million (£14.8 million) of Meta shares, while retaining a holding worth $21m.

=== Electoral performance and standing in the polls ===

After Clegg became leader, the polls were mixed; the Liberal Democrats occasionally polled above 20 points, averaging around 19%. In May 2009, the party overtook Labour in an opinion poll (25%–22%) for the first time since the days of its predecessor, the SDP–Liberal Alliance, in 1987. Clegg thus became the first Liberal Democrat leader to out-poll Labour in an opinion poll. After Clegg&#x27;s performance in the first of three general election debates on 15 April 2010, there was an unprecedented surge of media attention and support for the Liberal Democrats in opinion polls. ComRes reported the Liberal Democrats at 24% on the day, and on 20 April in a YouGov poll, the Liberal Democrats were on 34%, one point above the Conservatives, with Labour in third place on 28%. This success was described as by journalists.

Following the formation of the coalition, support for the Liberal Democrats fell. On 8 December 2010, the eve of a House of Commons vote on changes in the funding of higher education, an opinion poll conducted by YouGov recorded voting intention figures of Conservatives 41%, Labour 41%, other parties 11% and Liberal Democrats 8%, the lowest level of support recorded for the Liberal Democrats in any opinion poll since September 1990.

===Parliamentary by-elections (2008–2010)===
Five parliamentary by-elections were held during Clegg&#x27;s leadership prior to the 2010 general election. At Crewe and Nantwich the party&#x27;s share of the vote decreased by 4%. In the subsequent Henley by-election the party achieved a 1.8% increase in their vote. At the Norwich North by-election the party came third with a 2.2% fall in their vote share. The two Scottish by-elections, Glenrothes and Glasgow East, saw decreases in the Liberal Democrat vote, 8% and 10% respectively.

===2008 and 2009 local elections===
The local election results for the Liberal Democrats during the same period were mixed. In the 2008 local elections the Liberal Democrats took second place with 25% of the vote making a net gain of 34 councillors and took control of Sheffield City Council, but their share of the vote was down 1%. The next year the Liberal Democrats gained Bristol but lost both Somerset and Devon producing a net loss of councils and a net loss of one councillor. The party however did increase its share of the vote by 3% to 28% beating the Labour Party into third place. In the European Parliament elections held on the same day, the Liberal Democrats gained a seat but had a slight decrease in their share of the vote, staying in 4th place compared to the previous European elections, behind the two main parties and UKIP.

===2008 London elections===
In the 2008 London Assembly elections the Liberal Democrats were the only one of the three main parties to see a decrease in their share of the vote, and in the mayoral election the Liberal Democrat candidate Brian Paddick came third again with a decreased share of the vote.

===2010 general election===
At the 2010 general election, the Liberal Democrats won 23% of the vote, an improvement of 1%, however they only won 57 seats, 5 fewer than in 2005. No political party had an overall majority, resulting in the nation&#x27;s first hung parliament since February 1974. Talks between Cameron, the Conservative Party leader, and Clegg led to an agreed Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition, enabling the Queen to invite Cameron to form a government.

===Parliamentary by-elections (2010–2015)===
From the 2010 general election to the 2015 general election, Clegg&#x27;s Liberal Democrats contested 13 by-elections in Great Britain. The party scored their first by-election win of Clegg&#x27;s leadership at Eastleigh in 2013, with Mike Thornton holding the seat for the Liberal Democrats, despite a 19% swing away from the party. Clegg described the result as an election in which Liberal Democrats &quot;overcame the odds with a stunning victory.&quot;

Earlier by-elections in the parliament had proven less successful. They failed to win Oldham East and Saddleworth in January 2011, after they had successfully petitioned to overturn the general election result. They polled 32% of the vote, a small increase on 2010, but lost out to Labour whose vote was up by 10 percentage points. The Liberal Democrats also came second at Leicester South (which they had held between 2004 and 2005) in May 2011 with 23% (down 4% on 2010), and at Manchester Central in November 2012 where they polled 9% (down 17%).

In the remaining nine contests, Liberal Democrats have finished no higher than third place (and in Rotherham finished in an unprecedented 8th position, with just 451 votes, or 2% of the total). In every by-election except Oldham East and Saddleworth their vote has fallen, with decreases of over 10% recorded at eight of the contests. In six of the 13 by-elections, the party have lost their deposit after failing to poll 5% of the vote – an unusually high number of such lost deposits for a major party.

===2011 local, Scottish and Welsh elections===
A year following the formation of the Coalition Clegg&#x27;s Liberal Democrats faced poor results in the local elections. In Scotland the party lost all its mainland constituency seats, holding only the Shetland and Orkney islands. Their constituency vote share also fell from 16% to just 8% In the Welsh elections the party held just one of its 3 constituency seats, that of Welsh leader Kirsty Williams, but gained a regional seat. In the 2011 local elections, the Lib Dems lost over 700 councillors, and slumped from 25% to 17% in the share of the local council vote, also losing control of Sheffield City Council with the LibDems dropping to the lowest number of councillors in more than 20 years.

In the AV referendum, the Yes vote, supported by the Liberal Democrats, was defeated by 67.9% to 32.1%. In the face of the election results, Clegg told the BBC that Liberal Democrats must &quot;get up, dust ourselves down and move on&quot;.

===2012 local and London elections===
Local elections were held in May 2012 to 185 local authorities in Great Britain, including all 32 councils in Scotland and 21 out of 22 in Wales.

Results again proved poor for the Liberal Democrats, as they won 431 seats in total, a loss of over 300 on the pre-election position. They also lost overall control of one council (Cambridge, though the Liberal Democrats hold 21 out of 42 seats, so they exercise control with the mayor&#x27;s casting vote). They retained control of the other six councils they were defending in England. Despite the losses, the Liberal Democrat vote share saw a modest increase compared to 2011.

Elections were also held for the Mayoralties of Salford and Liverpool. Liberal Democrat candidates polled 5% and 6% respectively, with Labour winning both contests.

In London, elections were held to the London Assembly and Mayoralty. The Liberal Democrats again selected Brian Paddick as their Mayoral candidate. He polled just 4% of the vote (down from 10% in 2008), and finished fourth behind the Green Party. In the Assembly, the Liberal Democrats also finished behind the Greens across London, and failed to win any of the individual constituency seats. They polled 7% of the vote on the London-wide list (which elects &quot;top-up&quot; candidates to the assembly under a form of proportional representation), which represented a decline of 5% on the previous contest. This meant that the party lost one seat, and was reduced to just two assembly seats, their smallest representation since the formation of the assembly in 2000.

In the aftermath of the results, Clegg again faced calls to quit as leader, with former MP Lembit Öpik suggesting that Clegg retain his Cabinet position while relinquishing leadership of the party, saying &quot;My empirical view is that we would have done better with a different leader&quot;.

===2012 Police and Crime Commissioner elections===
As part of the Coalition Agreement, directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners were introduced to replace Police Authorities. Elections to the new posts took place in November 2012. Liberal Democrats contested 24 of the 41 police force areas, and failed to win any of the contests (and in fact never progressed to the second round of the two-stage count in any of the elections they fought). Their best performance was in Cumbria, where they polled 22%, while their worst was Surrey where the took just 6% of the vote.

Despite not winning any contests under their official party label, one Liberal Democrat, Winston Roddick was elected as Police and Crime Commissioner for North Wales having stood as an Independent. Roddick claimed that he had never hidden his party membership and that his campaign was &quot;financed by himself with no donations or backing from any political party and he was an independent candidate in every sense of the word&quot;. His campaign also dismissed as &quot;sour grapes&quot; claims from the Labour Party that &quot;the only way in which the Lib Dems thought they could win the election was by presenting themselves as independent.&quot;

===2015 and 2017 general elections===
In the 2015 general election, the Liberal Democrats were reduced from 57 seats to 8. Clegg held his Sheffield Hallam seat with a reduced majority. After his party&#x27;s result, he resigned the party leadership the day after the election.

In the 2017 general election, Clegg lost his constituency to Labour candidate Jared O&#x27;Mara by a margin of 2,125 votes (4.2%).

==Personal life==

In September 2000, Clegg married Miriam González Durántez, from Valladolid, Spain. They have three sons. While Clegg has stated that he does not believe in God, his wife is a Roman Catholic and they are bringing up their children as Catholics. On 16 September 2010, during Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s visit to the United Kingdom, Clegg attended the State reception in the grounds of Holyrood Palace and was introduced to the Pope by Her Majesty the Queen. Clegg identifies as a feminist.

Clegg lives in Atherton, California, having previously lived in Parkfields, Putney, south west London. He also has a house in his former constituency close to the Peak District, and often walked with his wife near Stanage Edge, which he describes as &quot;one of the most romantic places in the world&quot;. In May 2010 Downing Street announced that Clegg and the Foreign Secretary William Hague would share use of Chevening, which is typically the official country residence of the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom. In August 2022, Clegg announced he was returning to live in London for personal reasons, including being closer to elderly parents, dividing his working time between London and California.

When he appeared on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in October 2010, his choice of discs included Johnny Cash, Prince and Radiohead and his luxury was a &quot;stash of cigarettes&quot;. In an interview in April 2011, Clegg stated he dealt with the pressures of political office by reading novels late at night and he &quot;cries regularly to music&quot;. He supports Arsenal F.C.

== Honours ==

Clegg was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for political and public service.

<text>The River Kwai (), more correctly Khwae Noi (, , &#x27;small tributary&#x27;) or Khwae Sai Yok (, ), is a river in western Thailand. It rises to the east of the Salween in the north–south spine of the Bilauktaung range near, but not over the border with Burma. It begins at the confluence of Ranti, Songkalia and Bikhli Rivers. At Kanchanaburi it merges with the Khwae Yai River to form the Mae Klong River, which empties into the Gulf of Thailand at Samut Songkhram.

The river is chiefly known for its association with the Pierre Boulle novel, &quot;The Bridge over the River Kwai&quot; and David Lean&#x27;s film adaptation of the novel, &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, in which Australian, Dutch, and British prisoners of war and indigenous peoples were forced by the Japanese to construct two parallel bridges spanning a river as part of the Burma Railway, also called the &quot;Railway of Death&quot; or &quot;Thai-Burma Death Railway&quot;, due to the many lives lost in its construction. One bridge was wooden and temporary. The other was made of concrete and steel and still exists. The bridges actually spanned the Mae Klong, but as the railway subsequently follows the Khwae Noi Valley, the bridges became famous under the wrong name. In the 1960s, the upper part of the Mae Klong was renamed the &quot;Khwae Yai&quot; (&#x27;big tributary&#x27;).

The river was also used in Michael Cimino&#x27;s Academy Award-winning film, &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. The prison camp and initial Russian roulette scene was filmed on the Kwai.

A military history of the building of the bridges during World War II can be found in Professor Peter Davies&#x27;s biography of the British officer Philip Toosey, &quot;The Man Behind the Bridge: Colonel Toosey and the River Kwai&quot;. The book, and an associated BBC Timewatch documentary, challenge many of the inaccuracies portrayed in Boulle&#x27;s novel and Lean&#x27;s film.

The Vajiralongkorn Dam (formerly named Khao Laem Dam) and Srinagarind Dams are hydroelectric dams on the river.

<text>Morazán () is a department of El Salvador. Located in the northeast part of the country, its capital is San Francisco Gotera. It covers a total surface area of 1,447 km2 (558.8 mi² Square Miles).

==History==

Gotera was made a department in 1875, with its capital at Osicala. On February 8, 1877, Gotera was made the capital. The department changed its name from Gotera to Morazán on March 14, 1877.

Morazán was a major stronghold of the guerrilla movement during the 1979-1992 civil war. The infamous El Mozote massacre took place in this department in the village of El Mozote on December 11, 1981, when Salvadoran armed forces killed an estimated 900 civilians in an anti-guerrilla campaign. Originally dismissed by the Salvadoran and United States governments as an invention of anti-government propaganda, the massacre was confirmed in the early 1990s through exhumation of bodies buried at the site. A museum commemorating the Salvadoran civil war, the Museum of the Revolution, was established in the municipality of Perquín.

==Agriculture==
Among the agricultural products that stand out are the basic grains, sugar cane, henequen, grass, orchard plants, bananas, cocoa, and coffee. Livestock cultivation of cattle, horses, donkeys and sheep is also common.

<text>Faerie Tale is a supernatural thriller, falling within the subgenre of contemporary fantasy, by American writer Raymond E. Feist, first published in 1988.

It was translated and published in Dutch as &quot;Een Boosaardig Sprookje&quot; in 1989.

==Plot synopsis==
Phil Hastings and his family have just moved back to his hometown for some much-needed peace and quiet from the Hollywood scene. As Phil&#x27;s twin sons, Sean and Patrick, soon discover, there is more to their new home than was expected. Gloria, their mother, senses something, but simply dismisses her concern as stress from their recent move. Gabbie, their older half-sister, meets the man of her dreams, but is also tempted by other men.

Deep in the woods, the Bad Thing and his Master are ready to break free of the centuries-old compact made to keep the Faerie world and the human world at peace. Only through believing the insane and impossible can Sean and Patrick save both worlds from colliding again.

==Critical views==

The story was reviewed in the &quot;Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts&quot; and the subject of a master thesis. Professor Jack Zipes at the University of Minnesota, who has published and lectured on the subject of fairy tales, wrote &quot;This message is at the heart of a recent bestseller entitled simply &quot;Faerie Tale&quot; by Raymond E. Feist. The plot concerns a successful screenwriter by the name of Phil Hasting, who moves into a huge house in rural upstate New York with his wife and three children.&quot; Zipes goes on to say: &quot;Feist&#x27;s novel contains long-winded expositions about magic, Celtic tradition, and fairies and has a secondary plot concerned with Hastings teenage princess daughter, a rich heiress, who falls in love with an all-American graduate student writing his dissertation on a topic related to the occult and magic&quot;.

Romance novel author Shona Husk wrote &quot;However, the scary book that has really stayed with me is &quot;Faerie Tale&quot; by Raymond E. Feist which I also read as a teenager. Some of the images stayed with me for years. I reread it as an adult not that long ago and it is still really creepy.&quot;

<text>Qian Qichen (; 5 January 1928 – 9 May 2017) was a Chinese diplomat and politician. He served as Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Politburo member from 1992 to 2002, China&#x27;s Foreign Minister from April 1988 to March 1998, and as Vice Premier from March 1993 to March 2003. Since then, no other diplomat-turned-politician has attained such a lofty status in China&#x27;s political hierarchy. Qian played a critical role in shaping China&#x27;s foreign policy during CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin&#x27;s administration, and was a key player handling the return to Chinese sovereignty of Hong Kong and Macau. He was in charge of border negotiations with the Soviet Union in the 1980s, resulting in a successful settlement of the border dispute and the thawing of the relations between China and Russia. He was also instrumental in handling China&#x27;s normalization of relations with the West in the difficult period after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.

==Life and career==
Qian Qichen hailed from a prominent scholarly family from Waigang (), Jiading, Jiangsu province (now in Shanghai). He was a descendant of the celebrated Qing dynasty historian Qian Daxin. He was born in Tianjin on 5 January 1928.

From 1942 to 1945, Qian attended the Utopia University High School in Shanghai. He secretly joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1942 at the age of 14. From 1945 to 1949 he worked at the &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; newspaper. After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, he was member of the Party Committee and Secretary of the Communist Youth League Committees of the Xuhui, Changning, and Yangpu districts of Shanghai.

Qian left for the Soviet Union and studied at the Komsomol Central School in Moscow from 1954 to 1955. From 1955 to 1963, he worked as a diplomat in Moscow. He successively served as Second Secretary in the Chinese Embassy, Director of Department of Overseas Chinese Students and Deputy Director General of the Foreign Department of the Ministry of Higher Education, and Counsellor in the Chinese Embassy.

During the Cultural Revolution, Qian was persecuted and sent to perform hard labour at a May Seventh Cadre School from 1966 to 1972. After his political rehabilitation, he served as Ambassador to Guinea (1974–76) and concurrently Ambassador to Guinea-Bissau (1974–75). He went to work at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1977 and was vice-minister of foreign affairs from 1982 to 1988 and minister from 1988 to 1998. He was Vice Premier of the State Council, under Premiers Li Peng and Zhu Rongji, from 1993 until his retirement in 2003.

While serving as Director of the Information Department of the Foreign Ministry from 1977 to 1982, he proposed establishing a spokesperson system and became the first spokesperson of the Ministry.

Qian became Foreign Minister in April 1988. As Foreign Minister, Qian played a critical role in shaping China&#x27;s foreign policy during CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin&#x27;s administration, and was a key player handling the return to Chinese sovereignty of Hong Kong and Macau. He was in charge of border negotiations with the Soviet Union in the 1980s, which resulted in a successful settlement of the border dispute and the thawing of the bilateral relations between China and Russia. 

He was also instrumental in handling China&#x27;s normalization of relations with the West in the difficult period after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989; his meeting with then British Foreign Secretary John Major in July 1989 was the first such contact. In October 1989, Qian engaged in low-profile outreach when he attended the annual UN General Assembly in New York, seeking to reassure his listeners that China would proceed with reform.

He was the first Chinese diplomat to attend an ASEAN event, going to the 1991 ASEAN Foreign Ministers Meeting in Malaysia. This marked the first time China formally acknowledged ASEAN as an institution and laid the groundwork for future ASEAN-China cooperation, like the ASEAN+3 mechanism and the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA).

In 1992, he was tasked with traveling to Pyongyang, North Korea to inform Kim Il Sung that China would be establishing formal diplomatic relations with South Korea.

Qian was a member of the 12th to 15th CCP Central Committee. He was a member of the 14th and 15th CCP Politburo.

In November 2005, Qian was awarded the Order of the Polar Star, the highest civilian award of Mongolia, for his contributions to China–Mongolia relations.

==Personal life==
Qian was fluent in Russian and English, and understood some French. He was married to Zhou Hanqiong (). They had a son and a daughter. He published a memoir in 2004, entitled &quot;Ten Episodes in China&#x27;s Diplomacy&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

==Death==
Qian died of illness on 9 May 2017 in Beijing, at the age of 89. His funeral and subsequent cremation at Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery was attended by CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping, former CCP General Secretary Hu Jintao, Premier Li Keqiang, former Premier Li Peng and other CCP Politburo Standing Committee members including Zhang Dejiang, Yu Zhengsheng, Liu Yunshan, Wang Qishan and Zhang Gaoli, and Chief Executive of Hong Kong Leung Chun-ying and Hong Kong and Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office director Wang Guangya. Former CCP General Secretary Jiang Zemin did not attend Qian&#x27;s funeral ceremony, but sent a wreath.

He was officially eulogized as &quot;an excellent Communist Party member, a time-tested and loyal communist soldier, a proletarian revolutionist, and an outstanding diplomat.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Pollack&quot; (SS-180), a &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the pollack, a food fish resembling the true cod, but with the lower jaw projecting and without the barbel.

==Construction and commissioning==
The first &quot;Pollack&quot; was laid down 1 October 1935 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard, in Kittery, Maine; launched 15 September 1936; sponsored by Miss Anne Carter Lauman; and commissioned 15 January 1937.

==Service history==
=== 1937–1941 ===

&quot;Pollack&quot; stood out of Portsmouth Navy Yard 7 June 1937 for a Caribbean shakedown cruise. She returned from this cruise to Portsmouth 4 September and was underway 29 November for the West Coast of the United States. She reached her new base at San Diego, California, 19 December and spent the next 11 months in a rigorous schedule of maneuvers along the western seaboard with Submarine Division 13, Scouting Force. &quot;Pollack&quot; shifted to Pearl Harbor 28 October 1939. Except for periods of overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard, she remained in Hawaiian waters until the outbreak of World War II. She was underway from San Francisco to Hawaii when the Japanese attacked on 7 December, and she entered Pearl Harbor two days later.

=== 1942 ===

&quot;Pollack&quot; (commanded by Stanley P. Moseley, Class of 1925), and departed Pearl Harbor on 13 December and were off the coast of Honshū, Japan, a few hours before midnight on 31 December, the first American warships to reach Japanese waters in World War II. &quot;Pollack&quot; damaged the 2,700-ton cargo ship &quot;Heijo Maru&quot; on 5 January 1942 and two days later sent the 2,250-ton cargo ship &quot;Unkai Maru No. 1&quot; to the bottom, the first officially confirmed victim of the Pacific Fleet Submarine Force. On 9 January she sank the 5,387-ton freighter &quot;Teian Maru&quot; by a night surface attack, and ended her first war patrol at Pearl Harbor on 21 January.

&quot;Pollack&quot; got underway from Pearl Harbor on 18 February to intercept enemy cargo ships carrying war material to Nagasaki by way of the Formosa Channel. On 11 March she torpedoed and sank the 1,454-ton cargo ship &quot;Fukushu Maru&quot;. After midnight on 11 March she sank two sampans with gunfire;. She sank a second cargo ship, the 5,266-ton &quot;Baikal Maru&quot; with gunfire before returning to Pearl Harbor on 8 April.

&quot;Pollack&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 2 May and was in waters of the Japanese home islands on 12 May when she battle-surfaced to riddle a 600-ton patrol vessel with  and .50 cal (12.7 mm) fire. This target settled by the stern and burned furiously at every point above the waterline. &quot;Pollack&quot; returned from her third war patrol to Pearl Harbor on 16 June.

Following four months of overhaul at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Pollack&quot; put to sea for her fourth war patrol on 10 October. Before she reached her assigned area she was ordered back to Midway, arriving on 23 October. She fueled to capacity and stood out of the Midway channel that same day to patrol the approaches to Truk in an attempt to intercept crippled enemy ships believed en route to that enemy stronghold from sea battles in the Solomon Islands. There were no contacts with enemy shipping during the entire patrol and &quot;Pollack&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 29 November.

=== 1943 ===

&quot;Pollack&quot;″s fifth war patrol was again spent in waters off the Japanese home islands. After departing Pearl Harbor on 31 December, she sighted only one target on 21 January 1943 which fired three shells at the submarine; &quot;Pollack&quot; fired four torpedoes at a range of -results were &quot;undetermined&quot; before terminating her fifth war patrol at Pearl Harbor on 10 February 1943.

&quot;Pollack&quot; spent her sixth war patrol between the Gilbert and Marshall Islands. She put to sea from Pearl Harbor 6 March and intercepted a freighter in the sealane between Jaluit and Makin Atolls on the afternoon of 20 March, damaging her with one of three torpedoes. &quot;Pollack&quot; ended her sixth war patrol at Midway on 18 April.

Underway for her seventh war patrol, &quot;Pollack&quot; departed Midway on 10 May to reconnoiter Ailuk Atoll and Wotje Atoll, then patrolled to the south and west towards Schischmarev Strait. On 18 May she torpedoed and sank the 3,110-ton ex-gunboat &quot;Terushima Maru&quot;. Off Jaluit Atoll the next afternoon, she torpedoed and sank the 5,350-ton converted light cruiser &quot;Bangkok Maru&quot;, which was carrying 1,200 Japanese troops intending to reinforce the garrison at Tarawa. &quot;Pollack&quot; received a depth charge attack and was lightly damaged. The timing of this attack was important in reducing the number of Japanese troops garrisoned on Tarawa, which was attacked by American forces several months later in the Battle of Tarawa. &quot;Pollack&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 June.

Sailing on 20 July, &quot;Pollack&quot; spent her eighth war patrol off the east coast of Kyūshū, Japan. On 6 August she scored a torpedo hit on one ship in a convoy. Early on 27 August 1943, &quot;Pollack&quot; picked out one of five merchant ships off the coast of Kyūshū and pressed home an attack which sank the 3,520-ton passenger/cargo ship &quot;Taifuku Maru&quot;. On 3 September she sank the 3,521-ton cargo ship &quot;Tagonoura Maru&quot;. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 16 September.

=== 1944 ===

&quot;Pollack&quot; got underway from Pearl Harbor on 28 February 1944 and battled heavy seas as she entered the assigned area of her ninth war patrol off Nanpō Islands 18 March. Two days later she made a night surface attack and watched two torpedo hits blow the 1,327-ton patrol boat &quot;Hakuyo Maru&quot; to pieces. On 25 March she sank the 300-ton &quot;No. 13-class&quot; &quot;Submarine Chaser No. 54&quot;, and damaged two freighters. On 3 April she sank passenger-cargo ship &quot;Tosei Maru&quot;. She returned to Midway on 11 April.

&quot;Pollack&quot;″s tenth war patrol was conducted off the Nanpō Islands. She cleared Midway on 6 May and was sixteen days out to sea when she moved in on about ten merchant ships with several escorts. She scored torpedo hits which sank the 1,270-ton but was held down by a fierce counter-attack while the remaining ships of the convoy escaped. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 7 June.

&quot;Pollack&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for her eleventh war patrol on 15 July. She touched at Majuro, Marshall Islands, and then steamed on lifeguard station in support of the air strikes made on Woleai island on 1 August. She was off Yap Island from 4–5 August for similar duty, then patrolled in the Yap-Palau area, taking time out to shell the phosphate plant on Fais Island on 27 August and 30 August. On 27 August, a United States Army Air Forces B-24 Liberator bomber strafed her with machine-gun fire in the Pacific Ocean off Yap in the Caroline Islands in the vicinity of , but &quot;Pollack&quot; suffered no damage or casuatties. She returned to Brisbane, Australia, on 12 September 1944.

&quot;Pollack&quot; underwent a refit period at Brisbane, then got underway on 6 October for exercises with until 10 October. She then steamed by way of Mios Woendi, Schouten Islands, to Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 18 November for training operations off Oahu with units of the Pacific Fleet destroyer force.

=== 1945 ===

She was underway from Oahu 25 January 1945, in company with to the East Coast of the United States, reaching the Sub Base at New London, Connecticut, 24 February. The remainder of her career was spent as a training ship for men of the Submarine School at that base. She entered the Portsmouth Navy Yard on 14 June for inactivation and was decommissioned there on 21 September 1945. Her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 29 October 1946 and she was sold for scrapping on 2 February 1947 to Ship-Shape, Inc. of Philadelphia.

== History ==
During the Salvadoran Civil War, the region was considered a stronghold for the rebel Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front. In August 1982, the Salvadoran Army began a campaign in the area, moving in with ground troops after several days of bombing. On August 21–22, the Atlácatl Battalion surprised a group of hundreds of refugees at El Calabozo beside the Amatitán river, opening fire at close range. More than two hundred are reported to have died, among them infants and elderly, leading the incident to be called El Calabozo massacre.

==Volcano of San Vicente==

One of the most imposing volcanoes of the coastal chain is the Chinchontepec, or volcano of San Vicente, located in the confines of the department of the same name. Its almost perfect cone, as sugar pile, finishes off in two hill tops and this peculiarity gives origin to its nahuatl name “Hill of two tits”.

The oriental summit was called “volcano of Zacatecoluca”, is the highest one at 2,173 meters over sea level and it presents a well formed and conserved crater whose bottom at 1,990 meters has a swamp in the stormy season.

The western summit, smaller at 2,083 meters, exhibits an open crater to the east.

Dense vegetation covers both summits. To the northeast, at 820 meters in a ravine of 180 meters of longitude, there are fumaroles; fountains of clear and muddy water or small volcanoes of mud. The most important is to the south of the geological fissure. These groups of phenomenon of geological action are called “infiernillos”. In them, the water is at temperatures of 60 °C to 98 °C and they contain great quantities of water vapor, sulfuric acid, sulfuric hydrogen, and carbonic acid.

The Valley of Jiboa expands to the northeast and north of the western summit. It is also called Valley of Millers.

Chichontepec Volcano has also in the midst of the valley, an important archaeological site called &quot;Tehuacan.&quot; This was a place of adoration to the Aztec gods, and the found structures demonstrates the type of hierarchical organization their tribes had.

==Products==
San Vicente is known for the variety of typical sweets made with coconut preserves, nance, and tamarindo. In San Esteban Catarina, sweets of panela and pilon sugar are manufactured. San Sebastian is known for its textile production.

<text>The Bear River is the largest tributary of the Great Salt Lake, draining a mountainous area and farming valleys northeast of the lake and southeast of the Snake River Plain. It flows through northeastern Utah, southwestern Wyoming, southeastern Idaho, and back into northern Utah, in the United States. Approximately long it is the longest river in North America that does not ultimately reach the sea.

==History==

===Late Pleistocene===
The Bear River was a tributary of the Snake River until 140,000 years ago when a volcanic eruption north of Soda Springs, Idaho, diverted it into what was then Lake Bonneville.

===Recent history===
The river valley was inhabited by the Shoshone people. Fur trappers from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company began to penetrate the area, exploring south from the Snake River as early as 1812. John C. Frémont explored the area in 1843, and the Mormon Trail crossed the Bear River south of Evanston.

The California and Oregon Trails followed the Bear River north out of Wyoming to Fort Hall in Idaho. Some of the travelers on the trails chose to stay, populating the Bear River Valleys of Idaho and Utah. The Cache Valley was an early destination for Mormon pioneers in the late 1840s.

On January 29, 1863, troops of the United States Army attacked a Shoshone winter village in the Cache Valley, slaughtering most of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone. The incident has come to be known as the Bear River massacre.

The Bear River was surveyed through the Cache Divide for diversion and irrigation in 1868. After the First transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, the Central Pacific was given over a third of the land in the Bear River Valley through land grants. Alexander Toponce purchased of this land in 1883 for $65,000. He and John W. Kerr created the Corinne Mill, Canal and Stock Company and ultimately owned of land in the area. John R. Bothwell purchased much of this land in 1888. Bothwell created the Jarvis-Conklin Mortgage and Trust Company with Samuel M. Jarvis and Roland R. Conklin, with $2 million on mortgage bonds. The majority of these bonds were bought by Quaker societies in Scotland, England, and Ireland. This money was used to create a diversion dam and irrigation canals, employing 7000 men in late 1889. The company also bought the Ogden City Water Works.

The company went bankrupt by 1893, and bondholders reorganized into the Bear River Irrigation and Ogden Water Works Company with W. H. Rowe as president. Part of the canal project was then purchased by the Bear River Land Company, and part of the irrigation project by the Bear River Irrigation Company.

After the success of the Utah Sugar Company growing operations and factory in Lehi, farmers in the Bear River Valley began to experiment with growing sugar beets. This was successful, so Thomas R. Cutler, George Austin, and Mosiah Evans, executives at the Utah Sugar Company, purchased a portion of the Bear River Irrigation Company and organized the Bear River Land, Orchard and Sugar Beet Company in 1900. Cutler authorized the purchase of the entire Bear River Irrigation Company, plus an option on of land from the Bear River Land Company in 1901. This was financed by issuing and selling $500,000 in new stock in the Utah Sugar Company. Shortly, were being irrigated and farmed.

Utah Sugar expanded the east canal between 1902 and 1905, installed a hydroelectric plant on the Bear River, and installed a 2700-horsepower water pump on the west canal. They also negotiated with the Oregon Short Line to construct a railroad from Corinne north to Garland, which was completed in 1903. Utah Sugar built a sugar beet processing factory in 1903, also using the newly constructed rail line to transport the necessary machinery.

In 1911 a dam was constructed at Wardboro, Idaho, that diverted the majority of the flow of the Bear River into Bear Lake, via Mud Lake to act as a reservoir for the irrigation district. Water rejoins the river via an outlet canal a short distance downstream from the diversion

Utah Sugar&#x27;s water rights, dams, hydroelectric plant, and transmission lines were purchased by Utah Power &amp; Light, now known as Rocky Mountain Power, in December 1912 for $1.75 million. Utah Sugar purchased the canals on both sides of the Bear River in 1920 and controlled them at least through the 1960s.

==Course==
Since the river was diverted 140,000 years ago, the course of the river essentially makes a large inverted U around the north end of the Wasatch Range. It rises in northeastern Utah in several short forks on the north side of the high Uinta Mountains in southern Summit County. The main stem Bear River begins at the confluence of two tributaries, Hayden Fork and Stillwater Fork. The Hayden Fork originates north of Hayden Pass, just west of Hayden Peak. The Stillwater Fork originates in the Middle Basin, a plateau with an elevation of about and surrounded by high peaks of Mount Agassiz, Hayden Peak, and Spread Eagle Peak. One of the Stillwater Fork&#x27;s tributaries is called Main Fork, which originates in another high–altitude basin called Hell Hole.

From its source, the Bear River flows north, cutting across the southwest corner of Wyoming, passing through Evanston then weaving along the Utah-Wyoming state line as it flows north. It turns northwest into Bear Lake County, Idaho, and flows through the Bear Lake Valley in Idaho. There, the majority of the river flow is diverted into Bear Lake, which straddles the Idaho-Utah border, before rejoining the main river course near Montpelier via the Bear Lake Outlet Canal a short distance downstream from the diversion. At Soda Springs, near the north end of the Wasatch Range, the Bear River turns abruptly south, flowing past Preston in the broad Cache Valley that extends north from Logan, Utah. It re-enters northern Utah, meandering south past Cornish and Newton. It is impounded to form the Cutler Reservoir, where it receives the Little Bear River from the south. From the west end of Cutler Reservoir, it flows south through the Bear River Valley of Utah past Bear River City. It receives the Malad River from the north just before emptying into the mud flats of a broad bay on the east side of the Great Salt Lake; approximately southwest of Brigham City.

==Uses and protected areas==
The river is used extensively for irrigation in the farming valleys through which it flows in its lower reaches in Idaho and northern Utah.

The lower of the river near its delta on the Great Salt Lake are protected as part of Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge.

<text>Carl Sanford Joslyn &quot;Sandy&quot; Petersen (born September 16, 1955) is an American game designer. He worked at Chaosium, contributing to the development of &quot;RuneQuest&quot; and creating the acclaimed and influential horror role-playing game &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;. He later joined id Software where he worked on the development of the &quot;Doom&quot; franchise and &quot;Quake&quot;. As part of Ensemble Studios, Petersen subsequently contributed to the &quot;Age of Empires&quot; franchise.

==Biography==
Petersen was born in St. Louis, Missouri and developed a love for dinosaurs at age 3. He studied zoology at Brigham Young University and later attended the University of California, Berkeley, majoring in entomology.

==Work==
===Chaosium===
He became a full-time staff member at Chaosium in 1982. His interest for role-playing games and H. P. Lovecraft were fused when he became principal author of Chaosium&#x27;s game &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;, published 1981, and many scenarios and background pieces thereafter.

He authored several critically acclaimed &quot;RuneQuest&quot; supplements for Avalon Hill and Games Workshop. Petersen served as co-designer for West End Games&#x27;s &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; role-playing game.

===MicroProse===
He worked some time for MicroProse, where he is credited for work on &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates!&quot; and &quot;Sword of the Samurai&quot;. Between 1989 and 1992 he worked on the video games &quot;Darklands&quot;, &quot;Hyperspeed&quot;, and &quot;Lightspeed&quot;. He made some contributions to &quot;Civilization&quot;. Petersen was laid off in 1992 and was jobless for 5 months. He considered that period as one of the worst times of his life.

===id Software===
Petersen was hired by id Software in August 1993. During his interview, John Romero introduced him to DoomEd and simply asked him to build a level. Romero was ultimately happy with the results, so Petersen was brought on to production for &quot;Doom&quot;. The level from Petersen&#x27;s interview eventually became E2M6. He was a fast level designer and produced all maps for the third episode of &quot;Doom&quot;, Inferno. Petersen designed 17 levels for &quot;Doom II&quot;, a little over half of the 32 total. An 18th, &quot;Dead Simple&quot;, was redesigned by American McGee before release. 

Petersen was then involved with &quot;The Ultimate Doom&quot; in 1995 as well as the R&amp;D phase for &quot;Quake&quot;. At the time, &quot;Quake&quot; was based on an id staff D&amp;D campaign. Petersen was enthusiastic about the project, though he had not been a player in the original campaign as it was before his arrival at the company. With id Software&#x27;s designers waiting for the Quake engine to be ready for its design team, the studio sent Petersen to work temporarily at Rogue Entertainment, which was licensing the Doom engine to develop &quot;Strife&quot;. Romero also credits Petersen with coming up with the title for the &quot;&quot; expansion &quot;Deathkings of the Dark Citadel&quot;. When &quot;Quake&quot; was reformulated as a first-person shooter in late 1995, id removed Petersen from the &quot;Strife&quot; team to focus on the game. The revised &quot;Quake&quot; storyline is credited to Petersen, along with 7 levels.

===Ensemble Studios===
He left id Software for Ensemble Studios in June 1997. There, he worked as a game designer on several of their &quot;Age of Empires&quot; titles, including &quot;Rise of Rome&quot;, &quot;Age of Kings&quot;, and &quot;The Conquerors&quot;. During this time, he was a frequent poster on the HeavenGames forums under the username ES_Sandyman. He ran a popular series of threads, &quot;Ask Sandyman&quot;, where forum members could ask him about anything they wanted.

===Other works===
Petersen was the executive producer for the 2011 film &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; which was nominated for awards at the Chicago International Film Festival and Warsaw International Film Festival. It was produced by H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society Motion Pictures in the style of a 1930s black and white horror film.

In April 2011 he served as the publisher of horror magazine &quot;Arcane: Penny Dreadfuls for the 21st Century&quot;.

Petersen took a professorship at The Guildhall at SMU in 2009 following the closure of Ensemble Studios, where he taught several courses on game design.

Petersen worked at Barking Lizards Technologies as their creative director, after leaving The Guildhall, and worked on their iOS release &quot;Osiris Legends&quot;.

In mid-2013 Petersen led a successful Kickstarter campaign by his company, Green Eye Games, to produce the boardgame &quot;Cthulhu Wars&quot;. Over US$1,400,000 was raised achieving over 3,500% of the initial target. This success allowed the creation of more figures (60), map expansions and additional scenario options. Green Eye Games also produced the unsuccessful kickstarter &quot;Cthulhu World Combat&quot; (iOS, Android, Windows, PSN, Xbox Live).

In June 2015, it was announced that Petersen and Greg Stafford returned to Chaosium Inc. Petersen retired from the board in 2019, but continues to do occasional freelance work for the company.

Peterson has a website, Peterson Games, where he had sold various tabletop games, often based on his work with Call of Cthulhu. Although the site remains active, sales are now handled through Quimbly&#x27;s Toys and Games. As part of his ongoing work with Call of Cthulhu content he has published sourcebooks for Dungeons and Dragons 5e, Pathfinder, and Pathfinder 2e. Those books adapt the Cthulhu mythos for those systems to allow for several mythos-based player character options, many monsters, new insanity rules, and much more.

== Personal life ==
Petersen is a practicing member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but sees no conflict between his faith and his design of games involving Satanic elements. While working on &quot;Doom&quot;, he said to John Romero, &quot;I have no problems with the demons in the game. They&#x27;re just cartoons. And, anyway, &quot;they&#x27;re&quot; the bad guys.&quot;

Sandy is married, has five children, and 15 grandchildren.

<doc id="728147" wikidata="Q212540" url="?curid=728147" title="Sonsonate Department">
<text>Sonsonate () is a department of El Salvador in the western part of the country. The capital is Sonsonate.

The department has an area of 1,226 km².

Created on June 12, 1824. The El Salvador National Parliament decided on January 29, 1859 to separate from the department the cities of Apaneca, San Pedro Puxtla, Guaymango and Jujutla and give these cities to Santa Ana Department.

Sonsonate City was the second capital of the Federal Republic of Central America in 1834.

The department remains the heart of the Pipil culture in the country, home to several ancient traditions and to most of the few remaining Nahuatl speakers in El Salvador.

It is an overwhelmingly agricultural area, with extremely fertile volcanic soils that once were the most valuable resource in Central America for the Spanish conquistadors who profited from its ancient cacao plantations. Its name appropriately means &quot;Place of 400 rivers&quot; or &quot;Place of many waters&quot; as it receives well over 2,000mm (79 inches) of rain a year.

==History==
It is located at 65 Kilometers of San Salvador and at a height of 225 meters. It is in the margins of Centzunat, Sensunapan, or Grande River of Sonsonate. It is joined to the capital and Port of Acajutla through modern highways, as well as to Santa Ana and Ahuachapán.

Sonsonate was founded in 1552, with the title and name of Villa of Sagrado Espiritu, by Antonio Rodriguez. In 1553, Pedro Ramirez de Quiñonez and the bishop Francisco Marroquin gave it the name of Villa de la Santísima Trinidad. On April 1, 1824, it obtained the title of city and on June 12 of the same year, that of Departmental Head. In 1834, it was capital of the Central American Federation under the command of President Senator Jose Gregorio Salazar.

Its parochial church, although inspired by colonial style, is from a later date to the independence, since it was blessed on April 1, 1887. On the other hand, the church of Santo Domingo, of calicanto, brick, and tile, was built in 1726 under the advocacy of the Santo Angel de la Guarda. In 1834 it was seat to the federal authorities of Central America and from 1841 to 1846, to a school of 2nd teaching that was directed by Friar Jeronimo Zelaya.

In the park “Rafael Campos”, a column with the marble bust of the ex-president Rafael Campos (1813–1890) was erected in 1913. He was called the “Salvadoran Aristides”. During his administration, the first map of El Salvador (1858) was raised. The national army, under the command of General Ramón Belloso, fought and defeated the filibusters of General William Walker in the battles of Masaya and Granada, in Nicaragua.

Sonsonate is a corruption of Centzunat, slang in pipil that means: Big River and literally “Four hundred waters”.

==Notable people==
Rafael Barrientos was born in Armenia, department of Sonsonate in July, 1919. He was founder of the Orchestra of “Lito Barrientos”. Among the prizes received are: “The Congo of gold”, in Barranquilla, Colombia; “The Order of José Matías Delgado” and “Prodigal Son of El Salvador”.

Prudencia Ayala was born in Sonzacate on April 28, 1885. An influential women&#x27;s suffragist, she was the first woman to run for President of El Salvador, at a time when women weren&#x27;t even allowed the right to vote. She was supportive of labor unions and women&#x27;s rights, and supported the peasant&#x27;s uprising of 1932.

Jose Roberto Cea was born in Izalco on April 10, 1939. He is poet, novelist, narrator, and editor. He was part of the Committed Generation. In theater, his most well-known works are: Las escenas cumbres, Teatro de y una comarca Centro Americana. His novels: En este paisito nos tocó y no me corro. And in narrative: Chumbulúm el pececito de Darwin y Sihuapil Taqueisali.

Irma Dimas of Sonsonate was Miss El Salvador in 2005.

Claudia Lars was born in Armenia on December 20, 1899, and died in San Salvador on July 22, 1974. Her true name is Margarita del Carmen Brannon Vega. She was a poet that cultivated the sonnet and romance. She is considered the greatest lyrical voice of El Salvador of the 20th century. Her works: Estrellas en el pozo, Canción redonda, La casa de vidrio, Donde llegan los pasos, Tierra de infancia, Sobre el ángel y el hombre, and Nuestro pulsante mundo.

Francisco Malespín was born in Izalco on September 28, 1806 and was murdered in 1846. He was defender of culture and art. He was president of El Salvador in 1844.

Óscar Osorio was born in Sonsonate on December 14, 1910, and died in The United States on March 6, 1969. Corruption and repression reigned during his government, but the achievements in external politics were duly recognized. During his government, the Code of Work, the promulgation of the Defense Law of the Democratic and constitutional order were passed, and the “Chorrera del Guayabo” or the “November 5th” Dam, the Port of Acajutla, and the Institute of Urban Housing were constructed.

Salvador Salazar Arrué (Salarrué) was born in Sonsonate on October 22, 1899, and died in Los Planes de Renderos on November 28, 1975. He wrote stories, novels, poetry, and he painted. He liked the humbleness of rural people and belonged to the so-called Native movement. Among his plastic works are: La monja Blanca, La isla roja, La ciguanaba. In literature: Cuentos de barro, Cristo Negro, El Señor de la burbuja, O’yyarkandal, Eso y más, Cuentos de cipotes, Mundo nomasito-una isla en el cielo.

==Agriculture==

The most cultivated agricultural products are the basic grains, coffee, cotton, sugar cane, coconut, fruits, balsam trees, palm, tulle, and orchard plants.

Among the most remarkable manufacturing industries are those of dairy products, panela, sugar, tiles and bricks of mud, clothes, footwear, candles, soaps, and leather articles. Coconut trees are plentiful in the suburbs and thus the city is known poetically by the epithet “the city of the palms”.

The average annual temperature is 25 °C.

==Traditions==

Years ago, there was an exchange of products between the inhabitants of Cuisnahuat (Sonsonate) and Jayaque (La Libertad) during which these towns did a mutual visit; Cuisnahuat during the rainy season and Jayaque during the dry season. If the visit was not completed, it became a reason for war between these towns.

To celebrate this event, two pilgrimages are carried out each year; from Cuisnahuat to Jayaque in July (rainy season) and of Jayaque to Cuisnahuat in November (dry season). In these months, each town celebrates its patron festivities which get richer with the presence of the “Cumpas” to the level of Santos and Siblings.

Another of the traditions of Sonsonate is the “candle of the stick”, which happens during the last section of the year. The mayor of the city chooses the “mayor of the night festivities”. The mayor of the city gives authority to the mayor of the night festivities to rule the city during one night. Then, the mayor&#x27;s first order is to capture everybody who is outside of their house in the city. The captured citizens must pay the “pasayuba bosu” (nahuat expression for ‘pay the ticket’). All the collected money is dedicated for charity institutions.

==Typical Food==

In Sonsonate there is also a diversity of typical food, but let us point out like traditional: the yucca, which is generally eaten boiled or fried. In both boiled or fried, “pepescas” (or small fish) and the fritada are used.

Corn tamales, as well as hen tamales, have their own taste and you have them together with corn atol or a cup of coffee, depending on the time of the day.

Another one of the traditional foods in Sonsonate is the “sopa de patas” eaten with a beer or soda, depending on the person&#x27;s choice.

<text>Usulután (; from the Nawat language, meaning &quot;city of the ocelots&quot;) is a department of El Salvador in the southeast of the country (Lenca region). The capital is Usulután.

Created on June 22, 1865, it is El Salvador&#x27;s largest department. It has an area of 2,130 km².

On October 26, 1948, the Alegria district was abolished and a new one called Santiago de Maria was created; it contains the cities of Santiago de Maria, which is the main city, as well as Alegria, Tecapan and California.

The city of Usulutan, the department&#x27;s capital, was founded by the Lenca tribes but it was conquered by the Pipil tribes. Some of the best beaches in El Salvador are located in Usulutan, and others such as El Espino are now under development. For its high migration of its residents to the United States, it is known as Shulton city.

The department is home to Jiquilisco Bay and Puerto El Triunfo.

Bosque Nancuchiname is a forest of the Usulután Department, framing the eastern bank of the Lempa River and the town of El Zamoran on its southeastern border.

<doc id="728158" wikidata="Q151273" url="?curid=728158" title="33 Polyhymnia">
<text>33 Polyhymnia is a main belt asteroid that was discovered by French astronomer Jean Chacornac on October 28, 1854 and named after Polyhymnia, the Greek Muse of sacred hymns.

== Rotation ==
Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico during 2008 gave a light curve with a period of 18.609 ± 0.002 hours and a brightness variation of 0.15 ± 0.02 in magnitude. This result is in good agreement with a previous study performed during 1980. These results were re-examined with additional observations in 2011, yielding a refined estimate of 18.608 ± 0.001 hours and a brightness variation of 0.18 ± 0.02 magnitude. In 2020, an analysis of photometric data of Polyhymnia from 2008-2019 determined a more precise rotation period of . Two possible north pole orientations of Polyhymnia were also determined, with both solutions indicating an axial tilt of 151–155° (ecliptic latitudes –61° to –65°) with respect to the ecliptic.

== Orbit ==
On its highly eccentric (0.338) orbit around the Sun, 33 Polyhymnia appears brightest (apparent magnitude 10) at its minimum distance from Earth of 0.91 AU. Its orbit puts it in a 22:9 mean-motion resonance with the planet Jupiter. The computed Lyapunov time for this asteroid is 10,000 years, indicating that it occupies a chaotic orbit that will change randomly over time because of gravitational perturbations of the planets. Measurements of the position for this asteroid from 1854 to 1969 were used to determine the gravitational influence of Jupiter upon 33 Polyhymnia. This yields an inverse mass ratio of 1,047.341 ± 0.011 for Jupiter relative to the Sun.

== Mass and density ==
In 2012, a study by Benoît Carry gave a meta-estimate of a mass of for Polyhymnia, based on a single study of its gravitational influence on other Solar System bodies. However, given Polyhymnia&#x27;s diameter of , this mass implies an extremely high density of . Such a high density is unrealistic, so this mass and density estimate of Polyhymnia was considered unreliable by Carry. Several other asteroids with diameters similar to Polyhymnia were also measured to have extremely high densities in Carry&#x27;s study, and were rejected for being unrealistic. Because of Polyhymnia&#x27;s small size, its gravitational influence on other bodies is extremely difficult to detect and may lead to highly inaccurate mass and density estimates. For example, the -diameter asteroid 675 Ludmilla was originally measured to have a density of in Carry&#x27;s study, but improved orbit calculations in 2019 showed that it had a much lower density of .

No other peer-reviewed study has attempted to determine a mass and density for Polyhymnia since Carry&#x27;s study, though in 2023, researcher Fan Li performed a preliminary analysis of Polyhymnia&#x27;s close approaches with other asteroids and determined a lower mass of . Depending on the diameter used for Polyhymnia, this mass estimate suggests a density of or , for an occultation-derived diameter of and infrared-derived diameter of , respectively.

== Composition ==
Visible light spectroscopy of Polyhymnia from 1995 and 2002 show that it is an S-type asteroid, meaning it is mainly composed of rocky silicates. In particular, Polyhymnia&#x27;s spectrum exhibits an absorption band at 0.67 μm wavelengths, which indicates olivine and pyroxene on its surface, similar to Q-type asteroids. Since Polyhymnia shares both characteristics of S- and Q-type asteroids, it is further classified as an Sq-type asteroid according to the SMASS classification. Radio telescopes have studied Polyhymnia by radar in 1985.

In 2023, researchers Evan LaForge, Will Price, and Johann Rafelski speculated the possibility that Polyhymnia could be composed of high-density superheavy elements near atomic number 164, if Polyhymnia&#x27;s extremely high density were correct and superheavy elements could be sufficiently stable. However, as noted above, Polyhymnia very likely does not have such a high density.

<text>Devils Lake Regional Airport is a public use airport located two nautical miles (4 km) west of the central business district of Devils Lake, a city in Ramsey County, North Dakota, United States. It is owned by the Devils Lake Airport Authority and was formerly known as Devils Lake Municipal Airport. A new terminal recently opened for business at the airport. DVL is mostly used for general aviation but is also served by one commercial airline, with flights two times daily. Scheduled passenger service is subsidized by the Essential Air Service program.

As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 3,216 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 3,984 enplanements in 2009, and 5,242 in 2010. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a &quot;non-primary commercial service&quot; airport (between 2,500 and 10,000 enplanements per year).

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Devils Lake Regional Airport covers an area of 730 acres (295 ha) at an elevation of 1,456 feet (444 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways with asphalt surfaces: 13/31 is 6,400 by 100 feet (1,951 x 30 m) and 3/21 is 4,314 by 75 feet (1,315 x 23 m).

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2021, the airport had 23,780 aircraft operations, an average of 65 per day: 83% general aviation, 10% air taxi, 5% airline, and 2% military. At that time there were 28 aircraft based at this airport: 24 single-engine 3 multi-engine, and 1 jet.

<text>34 Circe is a large, very dark main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by French astronomer J. Chacornac on April 6, 1855, and named after Circe, the bewitching queen of Aeaea island in Greek mythology.

The spectrum of this object matches a C-type asteroid, suggesting a carbonaceous composition. It has a cross-section size of 113 km and is orbiting the Sun with a period of 4.40 years. Photometric observations of this asteroid made during 2007 at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico gave an asymmetrical bimodal light curve with a period of 12.176 ± 0.002 hours and a brightness variation of 0.17 ± 0.02 in magnitude. The spectra of the asteroid displays evidence of aqueous alteration.

<doc id="728168" wikidata="Q392440" url="?curid=728168" title="Monstrous moonshine">
<text>In mathematics, monstrous moonshine, or moonshine theory, is the unexpected connection between the monster group &quot;M&quot; and modular functions, in particular the &quot;j&quot; function. The initial numerical observation was made by John McKay in 1978, and the phrase was coined by John Conway and Simon P. Norton in 1979.

The monstrous moonshine is now known to be underlain by a vertex operator algebra called the moonshine module (or monster vertex algebra) constructed by Igor Frenkel, James Lepowsky, and Arne Meurman in 1988, which has the monster group as its group of symmetries. This vertex operator algebra is commonly interpreted as a structure underlying a two-dimensional conformal field theory, allowing physics to form a bridge between two mathematical areas. The conjectures made by Conway and Norton were proven by Richard Borcherds for the moonshine module in 1992 using the no-ghost theorem from string theory and the theory of vertex operator algebras and generalized Kac–Moody algebras.

== History ==
In 1978, John McKay found that the first few terms in the Fourier expansion of the normalized J-invariant could be expressed in terms of linear combinations of the dimensions of the irreducible representations formula_1 of the monster group &quot;M&quot; with &quot;small&quot; non-negative coefficients. The J-invariant is 
formula_2
with formula_3 and &quot;τ&quot; as the half-period ratio, and the &quot;M&quot; expressions, letting formula_1 = 1, 196883, 21296876, 842609326, 18538750076, 19360062527, 293553734298, ..., are

formula_5

The LHS are the coefficients of formula_6, while in the RHS the integers formula_1 are the dimensions of irreducible representations of the monster group &quot;M&quot;. (Since there can be several linear relations between the formula_1 such as formula_9, the representation may be in more than one way.) 

McKay viewed this as evidence that there is a naturally occurring infinite-dimensional graded representation of &quot;M&quot;, whose graded dimension is given by the coefficients of &quot;J&quot;, and whose lower-weight pieces decompose into irreducible representations as above. After he informed John G. Thompson of this observation, Thompson suggested that because the graded dimension is just the graded trace of the identity element, the graded traces of nontrivial elements &quot;g&quot; of &quot;M&quot; on such a representation may be interesting as well.

Conway and Norton computed the lower-order terms of such graded traces, now known as McKay–Thompson series &quot;T&quot;&quot;g&quot;, and found that all of them appeared to be the expansions of Hauptmoduln. In other words, if &quot;G&quot;&quot;g&quot; is the subgroup of SL2(R) which fixes &quot;T&quot;&quot;g&quot;, then the quotient of the upper half of the complex plane by &quot;G&quot;&quot;g&quot; is a sphere with a finite number of points removed, and furthermore, &quot;T&quot;&quot;g&quot; generates the field of meromorphic functions on this sphere.

Based on their computations, Conway and Norton produced a list of Hauptmoduln, and conjectured the existence of an infinite dimensional graded representation of &quot;M&quot;, whose graded traces &quot;T&quot;&quot;g&quot; are the expansions of precisely the functions on their list.

In 1980, A.O.L. Atkin, Paul Fong and Stephen D. Smith produced strong computational evidence that such a graded representation exists, by decomposing a large number of coefficients of &quot;J&quot; into representations of &quot;M&quot;. A graded representation whose graded dimension is &quot;J&quot;, called the moonshine module, was explicitly constructed by Igor Frenkel, James Lepowsky, and Arne Meurman, giving an effective solution to the McKay–Thompson conjecture, and they also determined the graded traces for all elements in the centralizer of an involution of &quot;M&quot;, partially settling the Conway–Norton conjecture. Furthermore, they showed that the vector space they constructed, called the Moonshine Module formula_10, has the additional structure of a vertex operator algebra, whose automorphism group is precisely &quot;M&quot;.

In 1985, the Atlas of Finite Groups was published by a group of mathematicians, including John Conway. The Atlas, which enumerates all sporadic groups, included &quot;Moonshine&quot; as a section in its list of notable properties of the monster group.

Borcherds proved the Conway–Norton conjecture for the Moonshine Module in 1992. He won the Fields Medal in 1998 in part for his solution of the conjecture.

==The moonshine module==
The Frenkel–Lepowsky–Meurman construction starts with two main tools:

# The construction of a lattice vertex operator algebra &quot;V&quot;&quot;L&quot; for an even lattice &quot;L&quot; of rank &quot;n&quot;. In physical terms, this is the chiral algebra for a bosonic string compactified on a torus R&quot;n&quot;/&quot;L&quot;. It can be described roughly as the tensor product of the group ring of &quot;L&quot; with the oscillator representation in &quot;n&quot; dimensions (which is itself isomorphic to a polynomial ring in countably infinitely many generators). For the case in question, one sets &quot;L&quot; to be the Leech lattice, which has rank 24.
# The orbifold construction. In physical terms, this describes a bosonic string propagating on a quotient orbifold. The construction of Frenkel–Lepowsky–Meurman was the first time orbifolds appeared in conformal field theory. Attached to the –1 involution of the Leech lattice, there is an involution &quot;h&quot; of &quot;V&quot;&quot;L&quot;, and an irreducible &quot;h&quot;-twisted &quot;V&quot;&quot;L&quot;-module, which inherits an involution lifting &quot;h&quot;. To get the Moonshine Module, one takes the fixed point subspace of &quot;h&quot; in the direct sum of &quot;V&quot;&quot;L&quot; and its twisted module.

Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman then showed that the automorphism group of the moonshine module, as a vertex operator algebra, is &quot;M&quot;. Furthermore, they determined that the graded traces of elements in the subgroup 21+24.&quot;Co&quot;1 match the functions predicted by Conway and Norton ().

==Borcherds&#x27; proof==
Richard Borcherds&#x27; proof of the conjecture of Conway and Norton can be broken into the following major steps:

# One begins with a vertex operator algebra &quot;V&quot; with an invariant bilinear form, an action of &quot;M&quot; by automorphisms, and with known decomposition of the homogeneous spaces of seven lowest degrees into irreducible &quot;M&quot;-representations. This was provided by Frenkel–Lepowsky–Meurman&#x27;s construction and analysis of the Moonshine Module.
# A Lie algebra formula_11, called the monster Lie algebra, is constructed from &quot;V&quot; using a quantization functor. It is a generalized Kac–Moody Lie algebra with a monster action by automorphisms. Using the Goddard–Thorn &quot;no-ghost&quot; theorem from string theory, the root multiplicities are found to be coefficients of &quot;J&quot;.
# One uses the Koike–Norton–Zagier infinite product identity to construct a generalized Kac–Moody Lie algebra by generators and relations. The identity is proved using the fact that Hecke operators applied to &quot;J&quot; yield polynomials in &quot;J&quot;.
# By comparing root multiplicities, one finds that the two Lie algebras are isomorphic, and in particular, the Weyl denominator formula for formula_11 is precisely the Koike–Norton–Zagier identity.
# Using Lie algebra homology and Adams operations, a twisted denominator identity is given for each element. These identities are related to the McKay–Thompson series &quot;T&quot;g in much the same way that the Koike–Norton–Zagier identity is related to &quot;J&quot;.
# The twisted denominator identities imply recursion relations on the coefficients of &quot;T&quot;g, and unpublished work of Koike showed that Conway and Norton&#x27;s candidate functions satisfied these recursion relations. These relations are strong enough that one only needs to check that the first seven terms agree with the functions given by Conway and Norton. The lowest terms are given by the decomposition of the seven lowest degree homogeneous spaces given in the first step.

Thus, the proof is completed (). Borcherds was later quoted as saying &quot;I was over the moon when I proved the moonshine conjecture&quot;, and &quot;I sometimes wonder if this is the feeling you get when you take certain drugs. I don&#x27;t actually know, as I have not tested this theory of mine.&quot; 

More recent work has simplified and clarified the last steps of the proof. Jurisich (, ) found that the homology computation could be substantially shortened by replacing the usual triangular decomposition of the Monster Lie algebra with a decomposition into a sum of &quot;gl&quot;2 and two free Lie algebras. Cummins and Gannon showed that the recursion relations automatically imply the McKay-Thompson series are either Hauptmoduln or terminate after at most 3 terms, thus eliminating the need for computation at the last step.

== Generalized moonshine ==

Conway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that perhaps moonshine is not limited to the monster, but that similar phenomena may be found for other groups. While Conway and Norton&#x27;s claims were not very specific, computations by Larissa Queen in 1980 strongly suggested that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln from simple combinations of dimensions of irreducible representations of sporadic groups. In particular, she decomposed the coefficients of McKay-Thompson series into representations of subquotients of the Monster in the following cases:

* &quot;T&quot;2B and &quot;T&quot;4A into representations of the Conway group Co0
* &quot;T&quot;3B and &quot;T&quot;6B into representations of the Suzuki group 3.2.&quot;Suz&quot;
* &quot;T&quot;3C into representations of the Thompson group &quot;Th = F&quot;3
* &quot;T&quot;5A into representations of the Harada–Norton group &quot;HN = F&quot;5
* &quot;T&quot;5B and &quot;T&quot;10D into representations of the Hall–Janko group 2.&quot;HJ&quot;
* &quot;T&quot;7A into representations of the Held group &quot;He = F&quot;7
* &quot;T&quot;7B and &quot;T&quot;14C into representations of 2.&quot;A&quot;7
* &quot;T&quot;11A into representations of the Mathieu group 2.&quot;M&quot;12

Queen found that the traces of non-identity elements also yielded &quot;q&quot;-expansions of Hauptmoduln, some of which were not McKay–Thompson series from the Monster. In 1987, Norton combined Queen&#x27;s results with his own computations to formulate the Generalized Moonshine conjecture. This conjecture asserts that there is a rule that assigns to each element &quot;g&quot; of the monster, a graded vector space &quot;V&quot;(&quot;g&quot;), and to each commuting pair of elements (&quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;) a holomorphic function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, τ) on the upper half-plane, such that:

# Each &quot;V&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) is a graded projective representation of the centralizer of &quot;g&quot; in &quot;M&quot;.
# Each &quot;f&quot;(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, τ) is either a constant function, or a Hauptmodul.
# Each &quot;f&quot;(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, τ) is invariant under simultaneous conjugation of &quot;g&quot; and &quot;h&quot; in &quot;M&quot;, up to a scalar ambiguity.
# For each (&quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;), there is a lift of &quot;h&quot; to a linear transformation on &quot;V&quot;(&quot;g&quot;), such that the expansion of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, τ) is given by the graded trace.
# For any formula_13, formula_14 is proportional to formula_15.
# &quot;f&quot;(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;τ&quot;) is proportional to &quot;J&quot; if and only if &quot;g&quot; = &quot;h&quot; = 1.

This is a generalization of the Conway–Norton conjecture, because Borcherds&#x27;s theorem concerns the case where &quot;g&quot; is set to the identity.

Like the Conway–Norton conjecture, Generalized Moonshine also has an interpretation in physics, proposed by Dixon–Ginsparg–Harvey in 1988 (). They interpreted the vector spaces &quot;V&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) as twisted sectors of a conformal field theory with monster symmetry, and interpreted the functions &quot;f&quot;(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, τ) as genus one partition functions, where one forms a torus by gluing along twisted boundary conditions. In mathematical language, the twisted sectors are irreducible twisted modules, and the partition functions are assigned to elliptic curves with principal monster bundles, whose isomorphism type is described by monodromy along a basis of 1-cycles, i.e., a pair of commuting elements.

== Modular moonshine ==
In the early 1990s, the group theorist A. J. E. Ryba discovered remarkable similarities between parts of the character table of the monster, and Brauer characters of certain subgroups. In particular, for an element &quot;g&quot; of prime order &quot;p&quot; in the monster, many irreducible characters of an element of order &quot;kp&quot; whose &quot;k&quot;th power is &quot;g&quot; are simple combinations of Brauer characters for an element of order &quot;k&quot; in the centralizer of &quot;g&quot;. This was numerical evidence for a phenomenon similar to monstrous moonshine, but for representations in positive characteristic. In particular, Ryba conjectured in 1994 that for each prime factor &quot;p&quot; in the order of the monster, there exists a graded vertex algebra over the finite field F&quot;p&quot; with an action of the centralizer of an order &quot;p&quot; element &quot;g&quot;, such that the graded Brauer character of any &quot;p&quot;-regular automorphism &quot;h&quot; is equal to the McKay-Thompson series for &quot;gh&quot; ().

In 1996, Borcherds and Ryba reinterpreted the conjecture as a statement about Tate cohomology of a self-dual integral form of formula_10. This integral form was not known to exist, but they constructed a self-dual form over Z[1/2], which allowed them to work with odd primes &quot;p&quot;. The Tate cohomology for an element of prime order naturally has the structure of a super vertex algebra over F&quot;p&quot;, and they broke up the problem into an easy step equating graded Brauer super-trace with the McKay-Thompson series, and a hard step showing that Tate cohomology vanishes in odd degree. They proved the vanishing statement for small odd primes, by transferring a vanishing result from the Leech lattice (). In 1998, Borcherds showed that vanishing holds for the remaining odd primes, using a combination of Hodge theory and an integral refinement of the no-ghost theorem (, ).

The case of order 2 requires the existence of a form of formula_10 over a 2-adic ring, i.e., a construction that does not divide by 2, and this was not known to exist at the time. There remain many additional unanswered questions, such as how Ryba&#x27;s conjecture should generalize to Tate cohomology of composite order elements, and the nature of any connections to generalized moonshine and other moonshine phenomena.

==Conjectured relationship with quantum gravity==
In 2007, E. Witten suggested that AdS/CFT correspondence yields a duality between pure quantum gravity in (2 + 1)-dimensional anti de Sitter space and extremal holomorphic CFTs. Pure gravity in 2 + 1 dimensions has no local degrees of freedom, but when the cosmological constant is negative, there is nontrivial content in the theory, due to the existence of BTZ black hole solutions. Extremal CFTs, introduced by G. Höhn, are distinguished by a lack of Virasoro primary fields in low energy, and the moonshine module is one example.

Under Witten&#x27;s proposal (), gravity in AdS space with maximally negative cosmological constant is AdS/CFT dual to a holomorphic CFT with central charge &quot;c=24&quot;, and the partition function of the CFT is precisely &quot;j&quot;-744, i.e., the graded character of the moonshine module. By assuming Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman&#x27;s conjecture that moonshine module is the unique holomorphic VOA with central charge 24 and character &quot;j&quot;-744, Witten concluded that pure gravity with maximally negative cosmological constant is dual to the monster CFT. Part of Witten&#x27;s proposal is that Virasoro primary fields are dual to black-hole-creating operators, and as a consistency check, he found that in the large-mass limit, the Bekenstein-Hawking semiclassical entropy estimate for a given black hole mass agrees with the logarithm of the corresponding Virasoro primary multiplicity in the moonshine module. In the low-mass regime, there is a small quantum correction to the entropy, e.g., the lowest energy primary fields yield ln(196883) ~ 12.19, while the Bekenstein–Hawking estimate gives 4 ~ 12.57.

Later work has refined Witten&#x27;s proposal. Witten had speculated that the extremal CFTs with larger cosmological constant may have monster symmetry much like the minimal case, but this was quickly ruled out by independent work of Gaiotto and Höhn. Work by Witten and Maloney () suggested that pure quantum gravity may not satisfy some consistency checks related to its partition function, unless some subtle properties of complex saddles work out favorably. However, Li–Song–Strominger () have suggested that a chiral quantum gravity theory proposed by Manschot in 2007 may have better stability properties, while being dual to the chiral part of the monster CFT, i.e., the monster vertex algebra. Duncan–Frenkel () produced additional evidence for this duality by using Rademacher sums to produce the McKay–Thompson series as (2 + 1)-dimensional gravity partition functions by a regularized sum over global torus-isogeny geometries. Furthermore, they conjectured the existence of a family of twisted chiral gravity theories parametrized by elements of the monster, suggesting a connection with generalized moonshine and gravitational instanton sums. At present, all of these ideas are still rather speculative, in part because 3d quantum gravity does not have a rigorous mathematical foundation.

==Mathieu moonshine==
In 2010, Tohru Eguchi, Hirosi Ooguri, and Yuji Tachikawa observed that the elliptic genus of a K3 surface can be decomposed into characters of the superconformal algebra, such that the multiplicities of massive states appear to be simple combinations of irreducible representations of the Mathieu group M24. This suggests that there is a sigma-model conformal field theory with K3 target that carries M24 symmetry. However, by the Mukai–Kondo classification, there is no faithful action of this group on any K3 surface by symplectic automorphisms, and by work of Gaberdiel–Hohenegger–Volpato, there is no faithful action on any K3 sigma-model conformal field theory, so the appearance of an action on the underlying Hilbert space is still a mystery.

By analogy with McKay–Thompson series, Cheng suggested that both the multiplicity functions and the graded traces of nontrivial elements of M24 form mock modular forms. In 2012, Gannon proved that all but the first of the multiplicities are non-negative integral combinations of representations of M24, and Gaberdiel–Persson–Ronellenfitsch–Volpato computed all analogues of generalized moonshine functions, strongly suggesting that some analogue of a holomorphic conformal field theory lies behind Mathieu moonshine. Also in 2012, Cheng, Duncan, and Harvey amassed numerical evidence of an umbral moonshine phenomenon where families of mock modular forms appear to be attached to Niemeier lattices. The special case of the &quot;A&quot; lattice yields Mathieu Moonshine, but in general the phenomenon does not yet have an interpretation in terms of geometry.

==Origin of the term==
The term &quot;monstrous moonshine&quot; was coined by Conway, who, when told by John McKay in the late 1970s that the coefficient of formula_18 (namely 196884) was precisely one more than the degree of the smallest faithful complex representation of the monster group (namely 196883), replied that this was &quot;&quot; (in the sense of being a crazy or foolish idea). Thus, the term not only refers to the monster group &quot;M&quot;; it also refers to the perceived lunacy of the intricate relationship between &quot;M&quot; and the theory of modular functions.

== Related observations ==
The monster group was investigated in the 1970s by mathematicians Jean-Pierre Serre, Andrew Ogg and John G. Thompson; they studied the quotient of the hyperbolic plane by subgroups of SL2(R), particularly, the normalizer Γ0(&quot;p&quot;)+ of the Hecke congruence subgroup Γ0(&quot;p&quot;) in SL(2,R). They found that the Riemann surface resulting from taking the quotient of the hyperbolic plane by Γ0(&quot;p&quot;)+ has genus zero exactly for &quot;p&quot; = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59 or 71. When Ogg heard about the monster group later on, and noticed that these were precisely the prime factors of the size of &quot;M&quot;, he published a paper offering a bottle of Jack Daniel&#x27;s whiskey to anyone who could explain this fact ().
These 15 primes are known as the supersingular primes, not to be confused with the use of the same phrase with a different meaning in algebraic number theory.

<text>35 Leukothea is a large, dark asteroid from the asteroid belt. It was discovered by German astronomer Karl Theodor Robert Luther on April 19, 1855, and named after Leukothea, a sea goddess in Greek mythology. Its historical symbol was a &quot;pharos&quot; (ancient lighthouse); it is in the pipeline for Unicode 17.0 as U+1CED0 𜻐 ().

Leukothea is a C-type asteroid in the Tholen classification system, suggesting a carbonaceous composition. It is orbiting the Sun with a period of and has a cross-sectional size of 103.1 km.

Photometric observations of this asteroid from the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico during 2010 gave a light curve with a rotation period of hours and a brightness variability of in magnitude. This is consistent with previous studies in 1990 and 2008.

The computed Lyapunov time for this asteroid is 20,000 years, indicating that it occupies a chaotic orbit that will change randomly over time because of gravitational perturbations of the planets.

<text>Tupiniquim (also Tupinã-ki, Topinaquis, Tupinaquis, Tupinanquins; plural: Tupiniquins) are an indigenous people of Brazil of the Tupi family, who now live in three indigenous territories (&quot;Terras Indígenas&quot; in Portuguese). The indigenous territories (Caieiras Velhas, Pau-Brasil and Comboios) are located near the cities of Santa Cruz and Vila do Riacho in the municipality of Aracruz in northern Espírito Santo state, southeastern Brazil. Caieiras Velhas Indigenous Territory is located along the banks of the Piraquê-Açu River. The Pau-Brasil Indigenous Territory is near Sahy Creek. The Comboios Indigenous Territory is located on the banks of the Comboios River. A 2010 census determined the population of Tupiniquim in all three indigenous territories as 2,630.

==Territory==
Historically, the Tupiniquim inhabited a large tract of land along Brazil&#x27;s coastline from approximately 200 km south of Salvador down to the São Mateus River. This area is north of the present-day Indigenous Territories and extended for about 600 km. The Tupiniquim have inhabited these Indigenous Territories since the founding of Santa Cruz and Nova Almeida (then Reis Magos). During the first two centuries after the arrival of Europeans, indigenous populations were the predominant majority in both Santa Cruz and Nova Almeida. Their tribe was one of the first to meet the Portuguese in April 1500 at Porto Seguro.

==Etymology and usage of the word==
The expression &quot;Tupin-i-ki&quot; means &quot;the Tupi next door, side neighbor&quot;. &quot;Tupinã-ki&quot; means a parallel situated tribe or branch of the Tupi.

In Brazil, the term &quot;Tupiniquim&quot; has come to colloquially mean &quot;Brazilian&quot; or &quot;national&quot;. The term is used as both a noun and an adjective: &quot;cinema tupiniquim&quot; (Brazilian cinema), &quot;cantor tupiniquim&quot; (Brazilian singer), and &quot;filosofia tupiniquim&quot; (Brazilian philosophy).

<text>Dickinson Theodore Roosevelt Regional Airport , formerly Dickinson Municipal Airport, is six miles south of Dickinson, in Stark County, North Dakota. It is owned by the Dickinson Airport Authority.

The airport serves western North Dakota, eastern Montana and northwest South Dakota, home to Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The airport sees one airline, SkyWest Airlines operating on behalf of United Express, flying an Bombardier CRJ200 to Denver; Delta Connection flew to Minneapolis-St. Paul until November 30, 2015. The first airline flights were Frontier DC-3s in 1959.

Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 9,164 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 8,924 in 2009 and 10,383 in 2010.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2021–2025 categorized it as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.

The airport is named for Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., the 26th President of the United States.

==Facilities==

The airport covers 626 acres (253 ha) at an elevation of 2,592 feet (790 m). It has two runways: 14/32 is a concrete runway that is 7,301 by 100 feet (2,225 x 30 m) and 7/25 is an asphalt runway that is 4,700 by 75 feet (1,433 x 23 m). In the early 2020s, runway 14/32 was rebuilt and extended with a $5,388,889 FAA Airport Improvement Program grant.

In the year ending October 25, 2019, the airport had 17,114 aircraft operations, average 47 per day: 85% general aviation, 9% airline, 6% air taxi, and &lt;1% military. In October 2021, 34 aircraft were based at the airport: 28 single-engine, 4 multi-engine, 1 jet, and 1 helicopter.

<doc id="728185" wikidata="Q444372" url="?curid=728185" title="Marian Harkin">
<text>Marian Harkin (born 26 November 1953) is an Irish independent politician who has been a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Sligo–Leitrim constituency since the 2020 general election, and previously from 2002 to 2007. She previously served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 2004 to 2019.

==Early and family life==
Harkin was born in Ballintogher, County Sligo, in 1953. She studied at University College Dublin, where she attained a Bachelor of Science degree in geology. She worked as a maths teacher at Mercy College secondary school in Sligo for 25 years, before entering into politics.

==Community activism==
While living in Manorhamilton, Harkin became active in the voluntary and community sector and developed the view that people living in disadvantaged areas such as Connacht had to rely on their own initiative and energy to progress development of their region. Her work at local level led to her appointment to &quot;Developing the West Together&quot;, which evolved into the &quot;Council for the West&quot;, of which Harkin became chairperson.

==Irish politics==
She was elected to Dáil Éireann as an Independent TD for the Sligo–Leitrim constituency at the 2002 general election, receiving the highest number of first preference votes in the constituency.

==Member of the European Parliament, 2004–2019==

At the 2004 European Parliament election, she was returned as an MEP for the North-West constituency topping the poll and being elected on the fourth count. She had previously contested the 1999 European Parliament election in the same constituency (then called Connacht–Ulster), but had narrowly failed to be elected, losing out to Dana Rosemary Scallon for the third seat in the constituency. However, in 2004, the position was reversed and Harkin was returned at Scallon&#x27;s expense.

Harkin did not contest the 2007 general election to concentrate on her role as an MEP.

She was a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group (ALDE) in the European Parliament. Harkin was a member of the European Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the delegation for relations with the United States. She has been European Democratic Party Vice-president since December 2012. In addition, she served as vice-chairwoman of the European Parliament Intergroup on Integrity (Transparency, Anti-Corruption and Organized Crime). She is also a supporter of the MEP Heart Group, a group of parliamentarians who have an interest in promoting measures that will help reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD).

She was re-elected to the European Parliament at the 2009 European Parliament election topping the poll in her constituency. She was again re-elected at the 2014 European Parliament election, taking the fourth seat in the new Midlands–North-West constituency.

On 1 April 2019, she announced that she was not standing for re-election in the 2019 European Parliament election.

==Return to Dáil (2020–present)==
In January 2020, she announced she was standing in the Sligo–Leitrim constituency at the 2020 general election, where she was elected.

At the 2024 general election, Harkin was re-elected to the Dáil.

<doc id="728186" wikidata="Q206993" url="?curid=728186" title="36 Atalante">
<text>36 Atalante is a large, dark main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by the German-French astronomer H. Goldschmidt on October 5, 1855, and named by French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier after the Greek mythological heroine Atalanta (of which &quot;Atalante&quot; is the French and German form, pronounced nearly the same as &#x27;Atalanta&#x27; in English). It was rendered &#x27;Atalanta&#x27; in English sources in the 19th century. This asteroid is classified as C-type (carbonaceous), according to the Tholen classification system.

Observation of the asteroid light curve indicates it is rotating with a period of . During this interval, the magnitude varies by an amplitude of 0.12 ± 0.02. By combining the results of multiple light curves, the approximate ellipsoidal shape of the object can be estimated. It appears to be slightly elongated, being about 28.2% longer along one axis compared to the other two. Atalante was observed by Arecibo radar in October 2010.

This asteroid shares a mean-motion resonance with the planets Jupiter and Saturn. The computed Lyapunov time for this asteroid is only 4,000 years, indicating that it occupies a highly chaotic orbit that will change randomly over time because of gravitational perturbations of the planets. This is the shortest Lyapunov time of the first 100 named asteroids.

<doc id="728190" wikidata="Q7872954" url="?curid=728190" title="USS Plunger (SS-179)">
<text>, a Porpoise-class submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named &quot;plunger&quot; after a diver or a daring gambler. Unlike most American submarines of the day, she was not named for a fish or other sea-dwelling creature.

The second &quot;Plunger&quot; was laid down 17 July 1935 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; launched 8 July 1936 and sponsored by Miss Edith E. Greenlee, eldest daughter of Captain Halford R. Greenlee, Acting Commandant of the Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was commissioned 19 November 1936, Lt. George L. Russell (later commander of Submarine Squadron 10) in command.

&quot;Plunger&quot; departed Gravesend Bay, N.Y. 15 April 1937 for a shakedown cruise to Guantanamo Bay, the Canal Zone, and Guayaquil, Ecuador. In November, following post-shakedown alterations at Portsmouth, she steamed to San Diego to join SubDiv 14, SubRon 6 (Submarine Division 14, Submarine Squadron 6). Continuing operations in the San Diego area for the next several years, &quot;Plunger&quot; joined (AS–3) and five &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class boats 15 March 1938 for a cruise to Dutch Harbor, Alaska. Training cruises to waters off Panama and Hawaii occupied the next several years. On 30 November 1941, she reported to Pearl Harbor and was off Diamond Head when Japanese planes attacked 7 December. Stricken from the Navy Register 6 July 1956, she was sold to Bethlehem Steel Co., Bethlehem, Pa. on 22 April 1957, and scrapped. Plunger received 14 battle stars for World War II service.

== First and second war patrols, December 1941 – July 1942 ==

&quot;Plunger&quot;, commanded by David Charles White (Class of 1927) set out on her first patrol less than a week after the Pearl Harbor attack, but had to turn back due to a pressure hull leak. Repaired, she set out again on 14 December.

Along with and , &quot;Plunger&quot; was part of the first US Navy offensive operation of World War II. Her orders sent her to Kii Suido, a principal entrance into the Inland Sea and an important funnel to industrial bases in the area. The three boats took two important technological devices into enemy waters: the Mark VI magnetic exploder for their Mark 14 torpedoes, and the primitive SD radar set. 
Shortly after White arrived on station, &quot;Plunger&quot; was seen by a Japanese destroyer which came on using powerful echo-ranging sonar—or &quot;pinging&quot;. Hearing the pinging was a jolt. The submarine force had not known for certain, until now, that the Japanese had such gear. The Japanese not only had it, they knew how to use it. The destroyer found &quot;Plunger&quot; and unleashed twenty-four close depth charges. It was a vicious, determined attack, the first for both the hunter and the hunted in Empire waters. It jarred the boat and crew severely. White was thankful that he had put back into Pearl Harbor to repair the weakness in the hull. Had he not, &quot;Plunger&quot; might not have survived.
She sank Japanese cargo ship &quot;Eizon Maru&quot; 18 January 1942.

After returning to Pearl Harbor, &quot;Plunger&quot; was docked on the Marine Railway at Pearl Harbor for repairs when, on 17 February 1942, she slid off the trolley and onto the dock floor. She was salvaged and refloated, after some effort, and returned to service.

&quot;Plunger&#x27;s&quot; second war patrol, 5 June to 15 July, took her off Shanghai. On this patrol, she sank the 4,700-ton cargo ship &quot;Ukai Maru No. 5&quot; on 30 June and &quot;Unyo Maru No. 3&quot; on 2 July before returning to Midway 15 June.

While on this patrol, White nearly sank a ship by accident that would have caused an international uproar. Through diplomatic channels, President Roosevelt had arranged an exchange of political prisoners trapped in the United States and Japan by the outbreak of war, including U.S. Ambassador to Japan Joseph C. Grew. They were put aboard the neutral vessels &quot;Asama Maru&quot; and S.S. &quot;Conte Verde&quot; for transfer from Japan to the United States. They were to sail with lights and other markings on a prearranged route, as would the vessels returning the Japanese.
&lt;br&gt;
On 5 June, [COMSUBPAC] English had sent instructions to his submarines, describing these ships, the routes, and the markings. Later, on 25 June, when the vessels actually got under way, English sent further messages, designed to assure immunity from submarine attack. Dave White failed to receive these messages. In the early morning hours of 30 June, he picked up &quot;Conte Verde&quot; and began an approach, somewhat astonished to find a ship all lighted up.
&lt;br&gt;
Back at Pearl Harbor, George &quot;Turkey Neck&quot; Crawford was on duty that night in submarine headquarters. &quot;The Communications Officer,&quot; Crawford remembered, &quot;came in to see me and wanted to send the immunity message again. I checked through the files and discovered that we had sent it four nights in a row. I questioned the need to send it again. However, the Communications Officer thought it might be a good idea, so, somewhat reluctantly, I put it on the air.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;
On &quot;Plunger&quot;, White had &quot;Conte Verde&quot; fixed in his periscope hairs and the crew at battle stations when his communications officer, having picked up and just decoded this fifth immunity message, rushed up into the conning tower. White broke off the attack at the last minute, settling for a photograph taken through the periscope from a range of 800 yards.
== Third and fourth war patrols, October 1942 – January 1943 ==

In October, as U.S. forces pushed on to Matanikau and Cape Esperance, &quot;Plunger&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 12 October on its third war patrol to reconnoiter the area and to block the &quot;Tokyo Express.&quot; On 2 November while patrolling off of Maringe Lagoon, lookouts sighted an airplane and &quot;Plunger&quot; submerged to avoid detection. Charts showed deep water at this location, dive depth was set at 55 feet. However, &quot;Plunger&quot; hit an uncharted reef at 52 feet, Q.C. head hit first, jamming. Immediately thereafter &quot;Plunger&#x27;s&quot; hull hit midship on the coral reef destroying her sound gear and damaging her bottom. &quot;Plunger&#x27;s&quot; third patrol was terminated by order of the Task Force Commander after the vessel had been on station for only five days. This action was taken due to the probability of serious oil and or air leaks as a result of the accident.

After repairing at Brisbane, &quot;Plunger&quot; returned to the Guadalcanal area for her fourth war patrol and operated off Munda, where Japanese barges were coming in at night, unloading troops and supplies, and departing by daybreak. On the night of 16 – 17 December she slipped past four destroyers and attacked two others unloading at Munda Bar. After seeing two of her &quot;fish&quot; explode, she slipped away from a counterattack. After another attack with unknown results the next night, and a bomber attack while heading home 8 January 1943, she arrived Pearl Harbor 12 January.

== 1943 ==

&quot;Plunger&quot; continued reconnaissance patrols throughout the spring and summer. She sank &quot;Taihosan Maru&quot; 12 March, and &quot;Tatsutake Maru&quot; and &quot;Kinai Maru&quot; 10 May. In June, she joined and in the first U.S. penetration into the Sea of Japan, an area abounding with Japanese shipping. Crossing the southern end of the Sea of Okhotsk, the ships returned to Midway 26 July but departed again 6 August to return to the Sea of Okhotsk. &quot;Plunger&quot; sank 3,404-ton &quot;Seitai Maru&quot; there 20 August and 4,655-ton &quot;Ryokai Maru&quot; 22 August. Returning to Pearl Harbor 5 September, the ships were the only U.S. vessels to complete two patrols to this area until the final weeks of the war.

In October, &quot;Plunger&quot; reconnoitered in the Marshalls area. She added lifeguard duties to her resume as U.S. bombers hit the islands, picking up a downed aviator 15 November. During the rescue, a Zero strafed the boat, seriously wounding the executive officer and five bluejackets. Nevertheless, the submarine rescued Lt. (j.g.) Franklin G. Schramm.

==1944–1945==

Frequent depth charge attacks pursued &quot;Plunger&quot; in January 1944 as she patrolled off the Japanese main islands. The risk was profitable, however, as she sank &quot;Toyo Maru No. 5&quot; and &quot;Toyo Maru No. 8&quot; on 2 February and &quot;Kimishima Maru&quot; on 23 February. Returning to Pearl Harbor 8 March, &quot;Plunger&quot; departed again 8 May to patrol the Bonin Islands. In July, she patrolled in and around Truk.

On 19 September 1944 she reported to Pearl Harbor for overhaul. She departed 15 February 1945 for New London, to serve in a training capacity until 25 October, when she reported to New Haven for Navy Day celebrations. On 30 October she reported to the Boston Navy Yard, where she decommissioned 15 November 1945.

== Post-war service ==

Retained in an inactive status, &quot;Plunger&quot; was fitted for service as a Naval Reserve Training vessel and reported to Brooklyn, N.Y. in May 1946, remaining there until 8 May 1952, when she departed for Jacksonville, Florida to support the Naval Reserve Training Program. Returning to New York 18 February 1954, she was declared inessential 5 July 1956. Stricken from the Navy Register 6 July 1956, she was sold to Bethlehem Steel Co., Bethlehem, Pa. 22 April 1957, and scrapped.

<text>Big Joe 1 (Atlas-10D) launched an uncrewed boilerplate Mercury capsule from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 9 September 1959. The purposes of the Big Joe 1 were to test the Mercury spacecraft ablative heat shield, afterbody heating, reentry dynamics attitude control and recovery capability. It was also the first launch of a spacecraft in Project Mercury.

Two flight readiness firings (FRF) were performed on Big Joe 1. The first, on 1 September 1959, ended immediately after T-0 because the ignition stage delay timer commanded shutdown of the rocket engines when neither sustainer nor main engine ignition followed normal vernier ignition. There was no booster or stand damage. The second FRF was successfully completed on 3 September 1959, with normal ignition, transition to main stage and shutdown by the engine timer after approximately 19 seconds of running time.

The prelaunch countdown went relatively smoothly, with one delay caused by the Atlas&#x27;s LOX fill and drain valve failing to close. At 08:19 GMT on 9 September, Big Joe lifted from LC-14 atop Atlas-10D. All went well until the two-minute mark when telemetry readouts indicated that the booster section had failed to jettison. The dead weight from the booster engines resulted in below normal velocity, and consequently the guidance system did not generate the planned SECO (&quot;Second Engine Cut-Off&quot;) signal at T+270 seconds because the required altitude and velocity had not been achieved. SECO was instead caused by LOX depletion at T+293 seconds. The Range Safety manual fuel cutoff command was received by the booster, but had no effect because the late SECO had resulted in depletion of helium control gas needed to close the propellant valves. All valves remained open, causing residual engine thrust and bumping of the Mercury capsule following separation. In addition, the guidance system did not generate the separation signal for the capsule due to insufficient altitude and velocity, so ground crews had to repeatedly fire the RCS (Reaction Control System) thrusters to tear the capsule free and in doing so exhausted the propellant supply. Navy recovery crews hurried to locate the capsule following splashdown and after a few hours, did so. The boilerplate Mercury, having landed some short of the target point, was found to have survived the mission in good condition and verified the ablative heat shield. Plans for a beryllium heat shield in the event the ablative one did not work were scrapped.

The Mercury capsule flew a ballistic flight to the altitude of . The capsule was recovered and studied for the effect of re-entry heat and other flight stresses from its 13-minute flight. Since the data from Big Joe 1 satisfied NASA requirements, a second launch, Big Joe 2 (Atlas-20D), which had been scheduled for the fall of 1959, was canceled and the launch vehicle was transferred to the Atlas-Able program.

While the Mercury team was satisfied with the flight, Convair Division engineers were not. The Atlas had failed to stage its booster section and overall vehicle performance was rather marginal. They listed the flight in official records as a failure. The staging problem was traced to a probable failure of the electrical circuit that provided power to the Conax separation valves, so additional instrumentation would be fitted to them on subsequent flights. Convair&#x27;s morale was soon raised however by the successful launch of Atlas-12D from Vandenberg Air Force Base on the West Coast followed by the vehicle being declared officially &quot;operational&quot;.

The Mercury spacecraft used in the Big Joe 1 mission is displayed at the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia.

<text>37 Fides () is a large main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by German astronomer Karl Theodor Robert Luther on October 5, 1855, and named after Fides, the Roman goddess of loyalty. Fides was the last of the main-belt asteroids to be assigned an iconic symbol, a Latin cross U+271D ✝ (). 37 Fides is also a S-type asteroid in the Tholen classification system.

Photometric observations of this asteroid at multiple observatories during 1981–82 gave an unusual light curve with three minima and maxima. The curve changed with varying phase angle of the asteroid relative to the viewer and the position of the Sun, indicating the changing influence of shadows cast by surface features. The composite light curve has a best fit period estimate of 7.33 hours. Austrian astronomer Hans Josef Schober has suggested that the multiple minima and maxima during each period may be an indication of a binary nature.

<text>Ernest Paul Bushmiller Jr. (August 23, 1905 – August 15, 1982) was an American cartoonist, best known for creating the comic strip character Nancy in 1933, now in print for 90 years. His work is noted for its simple graphic style. In 1976, he received the Reuben Award from the National Cartoonists Society for his work on &quot;Nancy&quot;.

==Childhood and training==
Born in the South Bronx, New York, Bushmiller was the son of immigrant parents, Ernest George Bushmiller Sr. and Elizabeth Hall, originally from Germany and Northern Ireland respectively. His father was an artist, vaudevillian and bartender. He briefly attended Theodore Roosevelt High School before leaving at 14 to work as a copy boy at the &quot;New York World&quot; newspaper, while attending evening art classes at the National Academy of Design. He ran errands for the staff cartoonists and was given occasional illustration assignments, including a Sunday feature by Harry Houdini.

==Comic strips==
In May 1925, cartoonist Larry Whittington, creator of the comic strip &quot;Fritzi Ritz&quot;, left to produce another strip, &quot;Mazie the Model&quot;. Bushmiller then took over, his name first appearing on the May 18 strip. &quot;Fritzi Ritz&quot; was expanded to a Sunday strip on October 6, 1929. Bushmiller had already been producing a comic strip for the &quot;New York Evening Graphic&quot; titled &quot;Mac the Manager&quot;.

Once he began to move away from Whittington&#x27;s depiction of Fritzi, Bushmiller began to model her after his fiance, Abby Bohnet, the daughter of a train conductor. The couple, who married July 9, 1930, had no children. In 1931, they headed for Hollywood, where Bushmiller wrote gags for Harold Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;Movie Crazy&quot;, continuing to draw &quot;Fritzi Ritz&quot; at the same time. A year later, they returned to the Bronx.

Bushmiller claimed in 1948 that &quot;All my characters are conceived in desperation.&quot; He introduced Nancy, Fritzi&#x27;s niece, to the strip on January 2, 1933. The character proved popular, so she appeared more often. As Aunt Fritzi was seen less frequently, the strip was eventually retitled &quot;Nancy&quot; in 1938. The popular strip was translated into various languages, including Italian, German, Swedish and Norwegian. &quot;Phil Fumble&quot; is a Bushmiller strip which ran from 1932 through 1938.

Bushmiller started working each day about 2pm, and he often sat at his drawing table well into the early morning hours of the next day. He usually began a strip with the last panel and then worked back toward the first panel. In 1960 he told a reporter:
The simplicity of his style brought praise from Art Spiegelman and other artists. Tom Smucker, writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, observed:
As Paul Karasik and Mark Newgarden noted in their essay, &quot;How to Read Nancy&quot;: 
Comics theorist Scott McCloud described the essence of Bushmiller and his creation:
In 1979, Bushmiller was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, but he continued to produce the strip with the help of assistants Will Johnson and Al Plastino. He lived in Stamford, Connecticut, where he died in 1982.

==Commissions==
Art-book publisher Harry N. Abrams commissioned twenty newspaper cartoonists, including Bushmiller, to create a museum-quality lithograph. The 1978 publication was limited to a set of 100 signed and numbered sets. The price was $250 per print or $6000 for the full set.

==Awards==
Bushmiller, one of the founding members of the National Cartoonists Society, received its Humor Comic Strip Award and its Reuben Award in 1976 for his work on &quot;Nancy.&quot; In 2011, Bushmiller was listed as a Judges&#x27; Choice for The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame.

Nancy remains a recognised and popular character, drawn by other artists since Bushmiller&#x27;s death, most recently by the pseudonymous &#x27;Olivia Jaimes&#x27;. Bushmiller&#x27;s work has been repeatedly addressed by other artists: Andy Warhol made a 1961 painting based on &quot;Nancy&quot;, and Joe Brainard made numerous works based on &quot;Nancy&quot;. Many cartoonists have produced work directly inspired by or commenting on Bushmiller&#x27;s art, including Art Spiegelman, Mark Newgarden, Chris Ware and &quot;Zippy&quot; cartoonist Bill Griffith, who has also written an essay on Bushmiller. Griffith revealed in the August 19, 2020 &quot;Zippy&quot; strip that he was writing and drawing a graphic biography of Bushmiller; it was published in August 2023.

The 1973 edition of the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot; uses a Bushmiller &quot;Nancy&quot; strip to illustrate its entry for &quot;comic strip&quot;.

<text>Outpost is a video game developed and published by Sierra On-Line in 1994. The game was noteworthy for having a hard science fiction approach, with one of the main designers being a former NASA scientist.

&quot;Outpost&quot; was released for Windows 3.1 and the Macintosh. It was followed by a loosely related sequel, &quot;Outpost 2: Divided Destiny&quot;.

==Story==
A massive asteroid named Vulcan&#x27;s Hammer is detected to be on a collision course with Earth, and all attempts to divert it from this path have failed. The last attempt, firing a large nuclear warhead at the asteroid, actually ended up splitting it not into five chunks (which would have averted disaster) as humanity hoped, but rather two asteroids. Now, instead of destroying the earth, it will simply wipe out nearly all life on Earth&#x27;s surface. Extinction is not an option, and so a mission is organized to create a colony on a world elsewhere in the galaxy as the last hope for mankind&#x27;s survival. The player is in charge of that mission.

==Reception==
Initial reviews of &quot;Outpost&quot; were enthusiastic about the game. The American version of PC Gamer rated the game at 93%, one of its highest ratings ever for the time. It was later made known that the reviewers had in fact played beta versions of the game, and had been promised certain features would be implemented, but never were.

James V. Trunzo reviewed &quot;Outpost&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #49 (Nov., 1994), rating it a 5 out of 5 and stated that &quot;&quot;Outpost&quot; excels in every way. It plays like a great science fiction novel reads. The graphics, sound and game play are state-of-the-art. I am extremely impressed with the game&#x27;s depth and variety of approaches to problem solving. The game is also educational without being intrusive. I learned amazing (almost frightening) facts about our space program&#x27;s capabilities. It was almost like looking into the future.&quot;

Indeed, many of the features described in the game&#x27;s own documentation simply do not exist in the finished game at all. These include the ability to enter diplomatic relations with the rebel colony and the ability to build roads, orbital colonies, or the mass driver. Many of these gameplay aspects were later patched in, though in appearance only, as many of them failed to have any meaningful effect on gameplay.

Following the release of the game, the game&#x27;s general bugginess and perceived mediocre gameplay, along with the lack of features described in most of the game&#x27;s reviews and the game&#x27;s own documentation, led to a minor backlash against the computer game magazines of the time by consumers who bought the game based on their reviews.

In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;Outpost&quot; the worst computer game ever released.

<text>(&quot;Our Best&quot;) is a television series shown on German public television (ZDF) in November 2003, similar to the BBC series &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot; and that program&#x27;s spin-offs.

In subsequent years, a dozen similar rankings were compiled, mostly titled the &quot;favourite (topic) of the Germans&quot;, with topics including books, places, songs, actors, comedians, sports persons (extra list for football players), inventions, and TV broadcasts (extra list for Olympic games).

== Greatest Germans ==
The intention initially was to find out &quot;Who are the greatest Germans?&quot; (&quot;Wer sind die größten Deutschen?&quot;), with more rankings to follow later. The German public was allowed to vote (via postcard, SMS or Internet) for the most important Germans—historical or contemporary—from a list of more than 300 people, plus additional suggestions.

This pre-determined list of candidates was created for two reasons:
#to exclude controversial figures from certain eras of German history, like Adolf Hitler and Erich Honecker;
#to decide beforehand who was to be considered as &quot;German&quot; in the first place, due to the complications of German history and its changing frontiers, which could have excluded such people as Mozart and Romy Schneider (Austria) or Albert Schweitzer (France).

However, the inclusion of Nikolaus Kopernikus, who spoke and wrote German, in the list of scientists caused controversy in Poland where he is revered as a national hero – the Polish Senate declared him an &quot;exceptional Pole&quot; on 12 June 2003. Similarly the inclusion of Mozart and Freud was criticized in Austria.

For the final Top Ten, an additional round was held, in which each candidate was promoted by an &quot;ambassador&quot; (most of them journalists) that would explain the work and importance of his or her favourite.

* Guido Knopp for Konrad Adenauer
* Margot Käßmann for Martin Luther
* Gregor Gysi for Karl Marx
* Alice Schwarzer for &quot;die Geschwister Scholl&quot;, Sophie and Hans Scholl
* Friedrich Nowottny for Willy Brandt
* Götz Alsmann for Johann Sebastian Bach
* Peter Sodann for Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
* Wolf von Lojewski for Johannes Gutenberg
* Helmut Markwort for Otto von Bismarck
* Nina Ruge for Albert Einstein

There was controversy over the televoting because of the high call charges associated with the programme.

The final list appeared as shown below (in descending order). Several rather unknown figures ranked relatively high, no doubt because of temporary popularity and organized votes from fan groups (#15), or in case of #125, just an entry by organized Internet forum members to honour one of their members.

<doc id="728209" wikidata="Q5641621" url="?curid=728209" title="Half-period ratio">
<text>In mathematics, the half-period ratio τ of an elliptic function is the ratio

:formula_1

of the two half-periods formula_2 and formula_3 of the elliptic function, where the elliptic function is defined in such a way that

:formula_4
is in the upper half-plane.

Quite often in the literature, ω1 and ω2 are defined to be the periods of an elliptic function rather than its half-periods. Regardless of the choice of notation, the ratio ω2/ω1 of periods is identical to the ratio (ω2/2)/(ω1/2) of half-periods. Hence, the period ratio is the same as the &quot;half-period ratio&quot;.

Note that the half-period ratio can be thought of as a simple number, namely, one of the parameters to elliptic functions, or it can be thought of as a function itself, because the half periods can be given in terms of the elliptic modulus or in terms of the nome.
See the pages on quarter period and elliptic integrals for additional definitions and relations on the arguments and parameters to elliptic functions.

<doc id="728215" wikidata="Q116550861" url="?curid=728215" title="List of cathedrals in England">
<text>This is a list of [[cathedral]]s in [[England]], the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Jersey, as well as Gibraltar. Former and intended cathedrals are listed separately. Cathedrals in overseas territories can be found at List of cathedrals in British Overseas Territories.

A [[cathedral]] [[church (building)|church]] is a Christian place of worship that is the chief, or &quot;mother&quot; church of a diocese and is distinguished as such by being the location for the &quot;cathedra&quot; or bishop&#x27;s seat. In the strictest sense, only those Christian denominations with an episcopal hierarchy possess cathedrals. However, notable churches that were formerly part of an episcopal denomination are still often informally called cathedrals.

It is a common misconception that the term &quot;cathedral&quot; may be applied to any particularly large or grand church. A cathedral may be a relatively small building, particularly if it is located in a sparser or poorer community. Modern cathedrals frequently lack the grandeur of those of the Medieval and Renaissance times, focusing more on the functional aspect of a place of worship. However, many of the grand and ancient cathedrals that remain today were originally built to much smaller plans, and have been successively extended and rebuilt over the centuries.

Some cathedrals were purpose-built as such. Some were formerly abbeys or priories, whilst others were parochial, or parish churches, subsequently promoted in status due to ecclesiastical requirements such as periodic diocesan reorganisation.

For the other parts of the United Kingdom, see
List of cathedrals in Northern Ireland; List of cathedrals in Scotland; List of cathedrals in Wales

For the Falkland Islands, which has a similar constitutional status to Gibraltar, see Christ Church Cathedral (Falkland Islands)

==Contents of this list==
The following list comprises all locations of current cathedral churches, or former cathedral churches, including those locations where no trace remains of the structure, indeed where the precise location is no longer known.

Also included are those structures or sites of intended cathedrals as well as pro-cathedrals, which are churches serving as an interim cathedral, (for instance whilst a permanent cathedral is acquired), or as a co-cathedral where the diocesan demographics/geography require the bishop&#x27;s seat to be shared with a building in another location.

The inclusion of dependencies is strictly for ecclesiastical reasons—the included dependencies are those that share a province with the mainland of England.

N.B. The Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham, a diocese-like structure under canon law, is currently headed by a married man, who is therefore an ordinary but not a bishop; hence the central church of the Ordinariate is not technically a cathedral. However, it will be a cathedral whenever the ordinary is a bishop. It is therefore included here. The Cathedral of Our Lady of Walsingham (Houston) is in the same position.

<text>In computing, a memory barrier, also known as a membar, memory fence or fence instruction, is a type of barrier instruction that causes a central processing unit (CPU) or compiler to enforce an ordering constraint on memory operations issued before and after the barrier instruction. This typically means that operations issued prior to the barrier are guaranteed to be performed before operations issued after the barrier.

Memory barriers are necessary because most modern CPUs employ performance optimizations that can result in out-of-order execution. This reordering of memory operations (loads and stores) normally goes unnoticed within a single thread of execution, but can cause unpredictable behavior in concurrent programs and device drivers unless carefully controlled. The exact nature of an ordering constraint is hardware dependent and defined by the architecture&#x27;s memory ordering model. Some architectures provide multiple barriers for enforcing different ordering constraints.

Memory barriers are typically used when implementing low-level machine code that operates on memory shared by multiple devices. Such code includes synchronization primitives and lock-free data structures on multiprocessor systems, and device drivers that communicate with computer hardware.

==Example==
When a program runs on a single-CPU machine, the hardware performs the necessary bookkeeping to ensure that the program executes as if all memory operations were performed in the order specified by the programmer (program order), so memory barriers are not necessary. However, when the memory is shared with multiple devices, such as other CPUs in a multiprocessor system, or memory-mapped peripherals, out-of-order access may affect program behavior. For example, a second CPU may see memory changes made by the first CPU in a sequence that differs from program order.

A program is run via a process which can be multi-threaded (i.e. a software thread such as pthreads as opposed to a hardware thread). Different processes do not share a memory space so this discussion does not apply to two programs, each one running in a different process (hence a different memory space). It applies to two or more (software) threads running in a single process (i.e. a single memory space where multiple software threads share a single memory space). Multiple software threads, within a single process, may run concurrently on a multi-core processor.

The following multi-threaded program, running on a multi-core processor gives an example of how such out-of-order execution can affect program behavior:

Initially, memory locations codice_1 and codice_2 both hold the value codice_3. The software thread running on processor #1 loops while the value of codice_2 is zero, then it prints the value of codice_1. The software thread running on processor #2 stores the value codice_6 into codice_1 and then stores the value codice_8 into codice_2. Pseudo-code for the two program fragments is shown below.

The steps of the program correspond to individual processor instructions.

In the case of the PowerPC processor, the codice_10 instruction ensures, as memory fence, that any load or store operations previously initiated by the processor are fully completed with respect to the main memory before any subsequent load or store operations initiated by the processor access the main memory.

In the case of the ARM architecture family, the codice_11, codice_12 and codice_13 instructions are used.

Thread #1 Core #1:

 while (f == 0);
 // Memory fence required here
 print x;
Thread #2 Core #2:

 x = 42;
 // Memory fence required here
 f = 1;
One might expect the print statement to always print the number &quot;42&quot;; however, if thread #2&#x27;s store operations are executed out-of-order, it is possible for codice_2 to be updated codice_1, and the print statement might therefore print &quot;0&quot;. Similarly, thread #1&#x27;s load operations may be executed out-of-order and it is possible for codice_1 to be read codice_2 is checked, and again the print statement might therefore print an unexpected value. For most programs neither of these situations is acceptable. A memory barrier must be inserted before thread #2&#x27;s assignment to codice_2 to ensure that the new value of codice_1 is visible to other processors at or prior to the change in the value of codice_2. Another important point is a memory barrier must also be inserted before thread #1&#x27;s access to codice_1 to ensure the value of codice_1 is not read prior to seeing the change in the value of codice_2.

Another example is when a driver performs the following sequence:

 prepare data for a hardware module
 // Memory fence required here
 trigger the hardware module to process the data

If the processor&#x27;s store operations are executed out-of-order, the hardware module may be triggered before data is ready in memory.

For another illustrative example (a non-trivial one that arises in actual practice), see double-checked locking.

==Multithreaded programming and memory visibility==
Multithreaded programs usually use synchronization primitives provided by a high-level programming environment—such as Java or .NET—or an application programming interface (API) such as POSIX Threads or Windows API. Synchronization primitives such as mutexes and semaphores are provided to synchronize access to resources from parallel threads of execution. These primitives are usually implemented with the memory barriers required to provide the expected memory visibility semantics. In such environments explicit use of memory barriers is not generally necessary.

==Out-of-order execution versus compiler reordering optimizations==
Memory barrier instructions address reordering effects only at the hardware level. Compilers may also reorder instructions as part of the program optimization process. Although the effects on parallel program behavior can be similar in both cases, in general it is necessary to take separate measures to inhibit compiler reordering optimizations for data that may be shared by multiple threads of execution.

In C and C++, the keyword was intended to allow C and C++ programs to directly access memory-mapped I/O. Memory-mapped I/O generally requires that the reads and writes specified in source code happen in the exact order specified with no omissions. Omissions or reorderings of reads and writes by the compiler would break the communication between the program and the device accessed by memory-mapped I/O. A C or C++ compiler may not omit reads from and writes to volatile memory locations, nor may it reorder read/writes relative to other such actions for the same volatile location (variable). The keyword to enforce cache-consistency. Therefore, the use of alone is not sufficient to use a variable for inter-thread communication on all systems and processors.

The C and C++ standards prior to C11 and C++11 do not address multiple threads (or multiple processors), and as such, the usefulness of depends on the compiler and hardware. Although guarantees that the volatile reads and volatile writes will happen in the exact order specified in the source code, the compiler may generate code (or the CPU may re-order execution) such that a volatile read or write is reordered with regard to non-volatile reads or writes, thus limiting its usefulness as an inter-thread flag or mutex.

<text>The king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla) surmayi or kingfish, is a migratory species of mackerel of the western Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. It is an important species to both the commercial and recreational fishing industries.

==Description==
The king mackerel is a medium-sized fish, typically encountered from to , but is known to exceed . The entire body is covered with very small, hardly visible, loosely attached scales. The first (spiny) dorsal fin is entirely colorless and is normally folded back into a body groove, as are the pelvic fins. The lateral line starts high on the shoulder, dips abruptly at mid-body and then continues as a wavy horizontal line to the tail. Coloration is olive on the back, fading to silver with a rosy iridescence on the sides, fading to white on the belly. Fish under show yellowish-brown spots on the flanks, somewhat smaller than the spots of the Atlantic Spanish mackerel, &quot;Scomberomorus maculatus&quot;. Its cutting-edged teeth are large, uniform, closely spaced and flattened from side to side. These teeth look very similar to those of the bluefish, &quot;Pomatomus saltatrix&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The king mackerel is a subtropical species of the Atlantic Coast of the Americas. Common in the coastal zone from North Carolina to Brazil, it occurs as far south as Rio de Janeiro, and occasionally as far north as the Gulf of Maine and found in Western coast of India predominantly in the Arabian Sea as well as in the East coast of India Bay of Bengal, Indian Ocean. Nonetheless, a preference for water temperatures in the range of may limit distribution.

King mackerel commonly occur in depths of , where the principal fisheries occur. Larger kings (heavier than 9 kg or 20 lb) often occur inshore, in the mouths of inlets and harbors, and occasionally even at the depths at the edge of the Gulf Stream.

==Migration patterns==

King mackerel migrate with seasonal changes in water temperature and with changes in food availability.
They migrate to the northern part of their range in the summer and to the southern part in the winter, swimming in large schools.
Both the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico stocks congregate in a winter mixing zone in an area of Monroe County, Florida, south of the Florida Keys, between November and March.

==Life history==
Eggs and sperm are shed into the sea and their union is by chance. Depending on size, a female may shed from 50,000 to several million eggs over the spawning season. Fertilized eggs hatch in about 24 hours. The newly hatched larva is about long with a large yolk sack. Little is known about king mackerel in their first year of life. Yearling fish typically attain an average weight of and a fork length of . At age seven, females average , males . King mackerel may attain , but any over is almost certainly a female.

==Feeding habits==
King mackerel are voracious, opportunistic carnivores. Their prey depends on their size. Depending on area and season, they favor squid, menhaden and other sardine-like fish (Clupeidae), jacks (Carangidae), cutlassfish (Trichiuridae), weakfish (Sciaenidae), grunts (Haemulidae), striped anchovies (Engraulidae), cigar minnows, threadfin, northern mackerel, and blue runners. They do not attack humans but will defend themselves against perceived threats, including humans flailing or thrashing in man-overboard and similar situations, by biting.

==Fisheries==
===Fishing gear and methods===
King mackerel are among the most sought-after gamefish throughout their range from North Carolina to Texas. Known throughout the sportfishing world for their blistering runs, the king mackerel matches its distant relative, the wahoo, in speed.
They are taken mostly by trolling, using various live and dead baitfish, spoons, jigs and other artificial lures. Commercial gear consists of run-around gill nets. They are also taken commercially by trolling with large planers, heavy tackle and lures similar to those used by sport fishers. Typically when using live bait, two hooks are tied to a strong metal leader. The first may be a treble or single and is hooked through the live bait&#x27;s nose and/or mouth. The second hook (treble hook) is placed through the top of the fish&#x27;s back or allowed to swing free. This must be done because king mackerel commonly bite the tail section of a bait fish. When trolling for kings using this method, it is important to make sure the baitfish are swimming properly. Typical tackle includes a conventional or spinning reel capable of holding of test monofilament and a , class rod.

Several organizations have found success in promoting tournament events for this species because of their popularity as a sport fish. The most notable are the Southern Kingfish Association (SKA) and the FLW Outdoors tour. These events are covered in several outdoors publications, both in print and online.

==As food==

===Processing===
As of 2005, king mackerel are primarily marketed fresh. They may be sold as fillets, steaks, or in the round (whole). Their raw flesh is grayish, due to its high fat content. They are best prepared by grilling, frying, baking or, especially for large &quot;smoker&quot; king, by smoking.
===Nutrition===

According to the United States Food and Drug Administration, king mackerel is one of four fishes, along with swordfish, shark, and tilefish, that children and pregnant women should avoid due to high levels of methylmercury found in these fish and the consequent risk of mercury poisoning.

==Similar species==
Small king mackerel are similar in appearance to Atlantic Spanish mackerel, &quot;Scomberomorus maculatus&quot;, and cero mackerel, &quot;Scomberomorus regalis&quot;, all three species being similar in shape and coloration. They may be distinguished as follows:

The lateral line on Atlantic Spanish mackerel and cero slopes gradually from the top edge of the gill to the tail. In contrast, that of the king mackerel takes an abrupt drop at mid-body (see illustration).

The first (spiny) dorsal fin on Atlantic Spanish mackerel and cero has a prominent black patch. The king mackerel does not. As all three species normally keep the first dorsal folded back in a body groove, this difference is not immediately evident.

Atlantic Spanish mackerel have prominent yellow spots on the flanks at all sizes. In addition to such spots, cero have one or more yellow stripes along the centerline. Young king mackerel have similar, but slightly smaller spots; these fade away on individuals weighing over , but may still be seen as slightly darker green spots toward the back from some angles of view.

Worldwide, many fish of these three species are quite similar to one or another. Off Mexico, Atlantic Spanish mackerel may be confused with Serra Spanish mackerel, &quot;Scomberomorus brasiliensis&quot;.

<text>38 Leda is a large, dark main-belt asteroid that was discovered by French astronomer J. Chacornac on January 12, 1856, and named after Leda, the mother of Helen of Troy in Greek mythology. In the Tholen classification system, it is categorized as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid, while the Bus asteroid taxonomy system lists it as a Cgh asteroid. The spectra of the asteroid displays evidence of aqueous alteration.

Leda has been studied by radar. During 2002, 38 Leda was observed by radar from the Arecibo Observatory. The return signal matched an effective diameter of 116 ± 13 km. This is consistent with some asteroid dimensions computed through other means. Based upon a light curve that was generated from photometric observations of this asteroid at Pulkovo Observatory, it has a rotation period of 12.834 ± 0.001 hours and varies in brightness by 0.15 ± 0.01 in magnitude.

<text>Adolf Friedrich Johann Butenandt (; 24 March 1903 – 18 January 1995) was a German biochemist. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1939 for his &quot;work on sex hormones.&quot; He initially rejected the award in accordance with government policy, but accepted it in 1949 after World War II. He was President of the Max Planck Society from 1960 to 1972. He was also the first, in 1959, to discover the structure of the sex pheromone of silkworms, which he named bombykol.

==Education and early life==
Born in Lehe, near Bremerhaven, he started his studies at the University of Marburg. For his PhD he joined the working group of the Nobel laureate Adolf Windaus at the University of Göttingen and he finished his studies with a PhD in chemistry in 1927. His doctoral research was on the chemistry of the insecticidal toxin found in the roots of &quot;Derris elliptica&quot; which he isolated and characterized. After his Habilitation he became lecturer in Göttingen 1931. 

== Professional career ==
He became a professor ordinarius at the Technical University of Danzig 1933–1936. In 1933 Butenandt signed the &quot;Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State&quot;. In 1936 he applied for the directorship of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut (later the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry) in Berlin-Dahlem while also joining the NSDAP on 1 May 1936 (party member No. 3716562). The earlier director of the Kaiser Wilhelm institute was Carl Neuberg, who had been removed for being a Jew. His work on rotenones was considered useful by the Nazi leadership as it could be useful for controlling lice among soldiers in the trenches. As the head of a leading institute, he applied for government funding on concentrated research labeled &quot;kriegswichtig&quot; (important for the war), some of which focused on military projects like the improvement of oxygen uptake for high-altitude bomber pilots.
Adolf Windaus and Walter Schöller of Schering gave him the advice to work on hormones extracted from ovaries. This research lead to the discovery of estrone and other primary female sex hormones, which were extracted from several thousand liters of urine. While working as professor in Danzig at the &quot;Chemisches Institut&quot; he was continuing his works over hormones extracting progesterone in 1934 and testosterone a year later, the research results were along with the synthesis of steroids by Leopold Ružička considered significant enough to be awarded later by Nobel Committee in 1939. In 1940 he was involved in research on a hormone treatment to make long submarine voyages more comfortable for submariners in the Kriegsmarine.

Butenand&#x27;s involvement with the Nazi regime and various themes of research led to criticism after the war, and even after his death the exact nature of his political orientation during the Nazi era has never been fully resolved. When the institute moved to Tübingen in 1945 he became a professor at the University of Tübingen. In 1948 he was considered for the chair for physiological medicine at the University of Basel. He entered in negotiations but eventually was convinced by the chemical industry to stay in Germany. In 1956, when the institute relocated to Martinsried, a suburb of Munich, Butenandt became a professor at the University of Munich. He also served as president of the Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science following Otto Hahn from 1960 to 1972.

Butenandt is credited with the discovery and naming of the silkworm moth pheromone Bombykol in 1959.

Butenandt died in Munich in 1995, at the age of 91. His wife , born in 1906, died in 1995 at 88. They had seven children.

<doc id="728233" wikidata="Q387593" url="?curid=728233" title="Bismarck Municipal Airport">
<text>Bismarck Municipal Airport is in Burleigh County, North Dakota, United States, three miles southeast of the City of Bismarck, North Dakota, which owns it. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport.

==History==

The original terminal, a single-story Modernist building, was designed in 1963 by Ritterbush Brothers, a local architectural firm. A two-story addition was constructed in 1982. The original building was demolished in 2003 to make way for the present building, and the addition was demolished in summer of 2005, after the completion of the new $15 million terminal. It was designed by Tvenge Associates, another Bismarck firm, and opened in May 2005. A parking lot is just south of the new terminal.

Bismarck Airport had its 7th consecutive year of record passenger boardings in 2016, with 271,020 passengers boarding commercial airline flights at the airport. Airport Director Greg Haug &quot;...was pleased to see the year-end numbers come in and attributes these record boardings to Bismarck’s strong economy.&quot;

==Facilities==
Bismarck Municipal Airport covers 2,425 acres (981 ha) at an elevation of 1,661 feet (506 m). It has two runways, both asphalt: 13/31 is 8,794 by 150 feet (2,680 x 46 m) and 3/21 is 6,600 by 100 feet (2,012 x 30 m).

In the year ending December 31, 2020, the airport had 28,004 aircraft operations, average 77 per day. 93 aircraft were then based at the airport: 49 single-engine aircraft, 16 multi-engine aircraft, 15 military aircraft, 11 jet aircraft, and 2 helicopters.

On April 7, 1998, a &quot;Corporate Air&quot; Cessna 208B Super Cargomaster impacted terrain 1.6 miles SE of Bismarck Municipal Airport due to the pilot&#x27;s failure to maintain airspeed during the approach, icing conditions and low level experience with the aircraft type. The sole occupant, the pilot, was killed.

==Ground transportation==
Bis-Man Transit buses provide service directly to the terminal. The 3 Green Route travels from downtown Bismarck to the airport and the University of Mary.

<text>39 Laetitia is a large main-belt asteroid that was discovered by French astronomer Jean Chacornac on 9 February 1856 and named after Laetitia, a minor Roman goddess of gaiety. The spectrum matches an S-type, indicating a stony (silicate) composition. It is orbiting the Sun with a period of and is spinning on its axis once every 5.1 hours.

Photometric observations of this asteroid gathered between 1968 and 1974 were used to build a light curve that provided shape and rotation information. It has the general shape of an elongated triaxial ellipsoid with ratios between the lengths of the axes equal to 15:9:5. Major surface features are on a scale of 10 km and the surface color does not vary significantly across the surface. In the ecliptic coordinate system, the pole of rotation is estimated to be oriented to the coordinates (λ0, β0) = (, ).

In 1988 a search for satellites or dust orbiting this asteroid was performed using the UH88 telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatories, but the effort came up empty. Photometric observations collected during 2006–08 were used to measure time variations of the asteroid light curve. This data suggests that the asteroid may have a complex shape or it could be a binary asteroid system. Observations of an occultation on 21 March 1998, produced several chords indicating an ellipsoidal cross-section of .
