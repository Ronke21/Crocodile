<text>State Route 72 (SR 72) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Arizona. It runs from SR 95 near Parker southeast to U.S. Route 60 (US 60) in Hope. Along its route in La Paz County, the highway is mostly parallel to the Arizona and California Railroad and runs through the community of Bouse in desert terrain. The route was established in 1930 from its current eastern terminus all the way to the California state line, but was truncated in 1965. The route was completely paved by 1940.

== Route description ==
SR 72 begins at a T-intersection at which SR 95 turns from north–south to east–west south of Parker. The highway heads eastward into desert terrain. Turning southeastward, the route enters the town of Bouse, running parallel to the Arizona and California Railroad. SR 72 enters Bouse as Broadway Avenue. As it runs through the community, the railroad to its northeast cuts most of the town in half, with a commercial areas both southwest and northeast of the roadway, but none along the railroad. Exiting Bouse, the highway enters an area dotted with farms spread among the desert, passing the communities of McVay and Utting. SR 72 crosses over the Central Arizona Project aqueduct southeast of McVay. Near a junction with Vicksburg Road in Vicksburg, the railroad turns away from SR 72 as the roadway heads southeast. The route ends at a junction with US 60 near Hope.

The highway is maintained by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), which is responsible for constructing and maintaining highways in the state. As part of this role, ADOT surveys volumes of traffic on their highways. These surveys are most often presented in the form of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is the number of vehicles that travel a road during an average day during the year. In 2009, ADOT calculated that around 2,600 vehicles used the road daily near Bouse, and around 2,000 daily near Vicksburg. No part of the highway has been listed in the National Highway System, a system of roads in the United States important to the nation&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==
SR 72 was first established in 1930 from US 60 through Bouse to the California state boundary along the Colorado River at Parker, with a spur . At the time, it was a dirt road. Between 1935 and 1939, the section of the route from Parker to Bouse had been paved, as was a section slightly north of Vicksburg. The rest of the highway had been graveled at the time, and was paved the next year. In 1962, SR 72 was removed from the SR 95 junction near the southern city limit of Parker to the California state line. This section was added as part of a northern extension of SR 95, with the section north of then-SR 172 becoming a spur of SR 95. A section of the highway just east of the western terminus was widened in 2008. A new traffic signal was installed at the SR 95 junction in 2010.

<text>Erling Sven Lorentzen (28 January 1923 – 9 March 2021) was a Norwegian shipowner and industrialist. He founded Aracruz Celulose in 1968. He was the widower of Princess Ragnhild, the eldest child of King Olav V of Norway. In addition to being a Norwegian princess, his wife was in the line of succession to the British throne and occupied the 18th place at the time of her birth. Erling Lorentzen was a member of the Lorentzen family of shipping magnates.

==Life and career==

Lorentzen was born in Oslo as the son of Øivind Lorentzen (1882–1980) and Ragna (née Nilsen; 1885–1976). He worked for the Norwegian Independent Company 1, a British military unit, during World War II.

He owned 28% of Aracruz Celulose, which he sold for approximately US$1.7 billion in July 2008.

His family was in the merchant marine business, and the Lorentzens had a line from the Gulf of Mexico to the east coast of Brazil and Argentina. In the early 1950s, Erling planned a visit to Brazil to meet with his representatives. At the time, they transported liquefied petroleum gas from the Gulf of Mexico to Brazil. On the way to Brazil, Erling learned that Esso wanted to sell its gas distribution company in Brazil. So instead of visiting their representatives, Erling sought to know more about such a company that was for sale, which would expand the LPG transportation business. When Lorentzen bought the company, Erling moved to Brazil permanently. The company grew considerably, but Lorentzen sold it in 1972. After the sale, he started other businesses, such as Aracruz Celulose.

==Marriage and children==

Lorentzen married Princess Ragnhild, elder granddaughter of the then-reigning King Haakon VII, on 15 May 1953 in Asker, Norway. He was thus the brother-in-law of King Harald V, Queen Sonja and Princess Astrid.

The couple had three children:

* Haakon Lorentzen (born 23 August 1954), married Martha Carvalho de Freitas (born 1958) on 14 April 1982, and had three children, each born in Rio de Janeiro:
** Olav Alexander Lorentzen (born 11 July 1985), married Ingrid Kraus de Andrade Nogueira (born 1988) on 4 December 2021, and has one son:
*** Salvador Lorentzen (born 1 April 2023).
** Christian Frederik Lorentzen (born 23 May 1988) married Mariah de Oliveira Pedrosa (born 1991) on 19 March 2022, and has one son:
*** Thomas Lorentzen (born December 2022).
** Sophia Anne Lorentzen (born 28 June 1994).
* Ingeborg Lorentzen (born 27 February 1957), married Paulo César Ribeiro Filho (born 1956) on 4 June 1982, and has one daughter:
** Victoria Ragna Lorentzen Ribeiro (born 19 December 1988), married Felipe Sampaio Octaviano Falcão on 9 August 2014, and has two children:
*** Frederik Sven Lorentzen Falcão (born 28 September 2016).
*** Alice Eva Lorentzen Falcão (born 21 October 2022)
* Ragnhild Alexandra Lorentzen (born 8 May 1968), married Aaron Matthew Long on 21 November 2003, and has two daughters.
** Alexandra Joyce Lorentzen Long (born 14 December 2007).
** Elizabeth Patricia Lorentzen Long (born March 2011).

<text>In computational complexity theory, a generalized game is a game or puzzle that has been generalized so that it can be played on a board or grid of any size. For example, generalized chess is the game of chess played on an formula_1 board, with formula_2 pieces on each side. Generalized Sudoku includes Sudokus constructed on an formula_1 grid.

Complexity theory studies the asymptotic difficulty of problems, so generalizations of games are needed, as games on a fixed size of board are finite problems.

For many generalized games which last for a number of moves polynomial in the size of the board, the problem of determining if there is a win for the first player in a given position is PSPACE-complete. Generalized hex and reversi are PSPACE-complete.

For many generalized games which may last for a number of moves exponential in the size of the board, the problem of determining if there is a win for the first player in a given position is EXPTIME-complete. Generalized chess, go (with Japanese ko rules), Quixo, and checkers are EXPTIME-complete.

<text>Running with Scissors (RWS) is an American video game developer based in Tucson, Arizona. It was founded in 1996 by Vince Desi through a business decision of Riedel Software Productions, a maker of child-friendly games. RWS created and maintains the &quot;Postal&quot; franchise, which has often caused controversy for its use of violence. RWS&#x27; first game was &quot;Postal&quot; in 1997, which caused much controversy and a trademark lawsuit from the United States Postal Service that lasted until 2003. A potential second game, &quot;Flesh and Wire&quot;, was canceled in 1999. The company followed up &quot;Postal&quot; with &quot;Postal 2&quot; in 2003. The third game in the series, &quot;Postal III&quot;, was co-developed by RWS and an internal team of publisher Akella, and RWS distanced itself from the game due to poor critical reception. RWS most recently worked on &quot;Postal 4: No Regerts&quot;, which was released in 2022, and the spin-off &quot;Postal: Brain Damaged&quot;.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Running with Scissors (RWS) was founded by Vincent James Desiderio Jr., a native of Brooklyn with Italian roots. Early in his life, he picked up a high-school teaching career before quitting a semester later and working several different jobs, including taxi driver and manager of a recording studio. While a recruiter on Wall Street, he adopted the short name &quot;Vince Desi&quot; upon request from his boss. Eventually, while seeking to hire workers in the computer industry, Desi became involved with and later a consultant for the video game company Atari. He befriended one of his hires, recent Rochester Institute of Technology dropout Mike Riedel, with whom he founded Riedel Software Productions (RSP) after Atari faced financial instability. RSP specialized in developing edutainment games for children and games based on licensed properties on a work-for-hire basis, with its early games including &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot; (its first game, developed for the magazine &quot;Mad&quot; in 1985), &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry&quot;, and &quot;Bobby&#x27;s World&quot;, as well as other games developed for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, Hanna-Barbera, The Walt Disney Company, Warner Bros., and the World Wrestling Federation, among others. Because Desi had no knowledge of programming and little interest in video games, he handled business affairs for the company, while Riedel was in charge of creative operations.

By the early 1990s, when Desi was 39, several factors led him to wish to relocate; Desi and Riedel discussed several potential cities—including Phoenix, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and Seattle—before they settled on Tucson, Arizona. Desi, Riedel and RSP moved to Tucson in 1991. At the time, RSP consisted of the two founders and two further employees, however, one of the employees did not turn up at John F. Kennedy International Airport, where the team was supposed to meet for the relocation, while the other employee quit two weeks following the relocation and moved back to New York. RSP was welcomed to the city by officials and the Greater Tucson Economic Council. The company was among the list of companies (others including Hughes Electronics) honored for moving to the city in 1992. In Tucson, RSP continued its prior business of developing child-friendly games and licensed games, though by 1996–1997, Desi and much of RSP&#x27;s team were bored of developing them, wherefore RSP set up RWS as a separate company to develop games targeted at adults. This formation was announced on March 13, 1997. Initially, RWS was to be run alongside RSP, drawing funding from RSP&#x27;s sales and acting as RSP&#x27;s edgier label. Shared between the two companies were three development teams: One, consisting of seven people, developed the first RWS game, one creating an edutainment game based on the film &quot;Free Willy&quot;, and another making an edutainment game for an academic publisher.

=== &quot;Postal&quot; ===
According to Desi, the RWS team wanted to make an original game, the most outrageous game they could. Inspired by the game &quot;&quot;, which had been playable at the RSP offices, RWS began work on &quot;Postal&quot;. The game saw the Postal Dude engage in mass murder, and it was named after the slang term &quot;going postal&quot;, referring to murders performed by United States Postal Service (USPS) employees. In 1997, RWS filed a trademark for the word &quot;Postal&quot; in the area of electronic gaming. In response, the USPS counter-filed that trademark, alleging that it was moving into video games, and Marvin Travis Runyon, the United States Postmaster General at the time, sent RWS a letter condemning the game&#x27;s theme. The legal battle was eventually dismissed with prejudice in June 2003. The theme also caused wider controversy within the media and the video game industry, to the surprise of Desi, who considered &quot;Postal&quot; to be more comical and &quot;over-the-top&quot; and stated that the game was not to be taken seriously. &quot;Postal&quot; was released in 1997 for Windows and Mac OS as the first game of Ripcord Games, a publishing label of Matsushita Electric&#x27;s Panasonic Interactive Media division. Following the release, the game was targeted by senator Joe Lieberman, who labeled it as one of the worst things in America, while retail chains CompUSA and Wal-Mart refused to sell the game. In its first week, &quot;Postal&quot; was sold over 10,000 times in the United States, and sales in Europe (where the game was released by Take-Two Interactive) were expected to reach 100,000. Desi estimated that the game generated roughly in revenue. RWS followed up with &quot;Special Delivery&quot;, an add-on of four levels released in August 1998 that allowed the player to murder lawyers, homeless people, and American Red Cross workers, among others. A Japan-exclusive version of &quot;Postal&quot;, titled &quot;Super Postal&quot;, was released in 2000, and &quot;Postal Plus&quot;, a bundle composed of &quot;Postal&quot; and &quot;Special Delivery&quot;, came out in 2002.

=== &quot;Postal 2&quot; and other projects ===
With &quot;Postal&quot; released, RWS conceived &quot;Flesh and Wire&quot;, an original three-dimensional sci-fi-themed game in which the player controls a blob-shaped character; Desi described the game as unintentionally funny. However, the game was canceled by Ripcord in 1999 alongside two unannounced games, and RWS turned to focus only on &quot;Postal&quot;. Consequently, RWS soon picked up development on &quot;Postal 2&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Postal&quot;. The company attempted to make its humor more evident than it was in the original game so it would reach a wider audience. When brainstorming ideas for the game, the team considered Gary Coleman, a former child actor known for his role in the show &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;, as a good fit for the game&#x27;s theme. Desi called up Coleman, who agreed to his inclusion and performed himself in the game. &quot;Postal 2&quot; was released in April 2003 through publisher Whiptail Interactive. &quot;Postal 2&quot; was shortly banned in 13 countries; New Zealand banned it in 2004 and Australia in 2005. Desi later struck a deal with the company Softwrap to have the game distributed online, which bypassed the bans. Due to the popularity of &quot;Postal 2&quot;, Whiptail released &quot;Postal: Classic and Uncut&quot;, containing the original &quot;Postal&quot; and &quot;Special Delivery&quot;, as well as a demo version of &quot;Postal 2&quot;, in August that year. This was followed by &quot;Share the Pain&quot;, a version of &quot;Postal 2&quot; that introduced online multiplayer to the game. In Europe, this version was published by Greek company Hell-Tech. A separate expansion, &quot;Apocalypse Weekend&quot;, was released in 2005. The &quot;Postal Fudge Pack&quot;—a compilation containing the original &quot;Postal&quot;, &quot;Share the Pain&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Weekend&quot;, the fan-made total conversion &quot;Eternal Damnation&quot;, and the fan-made mod &quot;A Week in Paradise&quot;—was released in November 2006. A similar compilation, &quot;Postal: 10th Anniversary Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, was released the following year.

During &quot;Postal 2&quot; development, RWS got in contact with Uwe Boll, a director of video game-based films like &quot;House of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot;, and &quot;BloodRayne&quot;. Although Boll&#x27;s films were usually received poorly, Desi believed that Boll&#x27;s independent and anti-establishment attitude was a good fit for the &quot;Postal&quot; series. The resulting film was shot in the Vancouver area, with Desi playing himself as well as Krotchy, an anthropomorphic scrotum from the &quot;Postal&quot; universe. The film faced several issues, such as overlength and poor editing and marketing efforts.

=== &quot;Postal III&quot;, &quot;Postal Redux&quot;, and &quot;Postal 4&quot; ===
RWS&#x27; next game was &quot;Postal III&quot;; the company struck a deal with Russian publisher Akella that saw RWS create the script, music, design and character development for the game, which was then moved to Akella&#x27;s in-house developers, Trashmasters, for programming and art production. During the development, however, the Russian economy fell and the development was mostly ramped down. &quot;Postal III&quot; was released in December 2011 to very bad reception, leading RWS to pull it from its online store the following year. Desi stated that the finished &quot;Postal III&quot; was &quot;a product that should have never been published&quot;. In response, RWS developed &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, a new add-on for &quot;Postal 2&quot; that was released in April 2015, twelve years after &quot;Postal 2&quot; original release. In May 2016, the company released a remake of the original &quot;Postal&quot; titled &quot;Postal Redux&quot;. Another compilation, &quot;Postal XX: 20th Anniversary Edition&quot;, was released in 2017. RWS then released &quot;Postal 4: No Regerts&quot;, first as an early access game in October 2019 and then fully in April 2022. The company worked with developers Hyperstrange and CreativeForge Games on the spin-off &quot;Postal: Brain Damaged&quot;.

<text>Tokhtamysh (Turki/Kypchak and Persian: توقتمش; ; ; – 1406) was Khan (ruler) of the Golden Horde, who briefly succeeded in consolidating the Blue and White Hordes into a single polity.

Tokhtamysh belonged to the House of Borjigin, tracing his ancestry to Genghis Khan. Spending most of his younger years fighting against his father&#x27;s cousin Urus Khan and his sons, Tokhtamysh sought help from the Turco-Mongol warlord Timur, with whose help he succeeded in defeating his enemies. 

Tokhtamysh rose to power during a tumultuous period in the Golden Horde, which was severely weakened after a long period of division and internecine conflict. From a fugitive, Tokhtamysh had become a powerful monarch, quickly solidifying his authority in both wings of the Golden Horde. Encouraged by his success, as well as the growth of his manpower and wealth, Tokhtamysh went on a military expedition to the Russian principalities, sacking Moscow in 1382. He reasserted the Tatar–Mongol hegemony over its Russian vassals and brought about the recommencement of tribute payments.

A turning point in Tokhtamysh&#x27;s rule was the military confrontations with his former protector Timur, who invaded the Golden Horde and defeated Tokhtamysh twice. Crushing defeats for the Golden Horde undid all of Tokhtamysh&#x27;s previous achievements and ultimately led to his destruction. 

Tokhtamysh has often been called the last great ruler of the Golden Horde.

== Ancestry ==
According to the detailed genealogies of the &quot;Muʿizz al-ansāb&quot; and the &quot;Tawārīḫ-i guzīdah-i nuṣrat-nāmah&quot;, Tokhtamysh was a descendant of Tuqa-Timur, the thirteenth son of Jochi, the eldest son of Genghis Khan. They provide the following ancestry: Tūqtāmīsh, son of Tuy-Khwāja, the son of Qutluq-Khwāja, the son of Kuyunchak, the son of Sārīcha, the son of Ūrung-Tīmūr, the son of Tūqā-Tīmūr, the son of Jūjī. According to Muʿīn-ad-Dīn Naṭanzī (previously known as the &quot;Anonymous of Iskandar&quot;), Tokhtamysh&#x27;s mother was Kutan-Kunchek of the Khongirad tribe. Older scholarship followed the inaccurate testimony of Naṭanzī in making Urus Khan and, by extension, Tokhtamysh, descendants of Jochi&#x27;s son Orda. This erroneous view has only gradually been abandoned, first for Tokhtamysh, and later for Urus. Although Urus and Tokhtamysh are often described as uncle and nephew, they were in fact fourth cousins.

==Opposition to Urus Khan==
Tokhtamysh&#x27;s father, Tuy Khwāja, was the local ruler of the Mangyshlak peninsula. He refused to join the forces of his cousin and suzerain, Urus, the khan of the former Ulus of Orda centered on Sighnaq, for a campaign to subdue Sarai, the traditional capital of the Golden Horde. Offended and wary of any opposition to his authority, Urus had Tuy Khwāja executed. The young Tokhtamysh fled, then submitted to his father&#x27;s murderer, and was forgiven on account of his youth. In 1373, while Urus was asserting himself at Sarai, Tokhtamysh gathered a group of Urus&#x27; opponents and attempted to make himself khan in Sighnaq. Urus immediately advanced against them, and Tokhtamysh fled, only to return, submit, and be forgiven again. When Urus took over Sarai in 1375, Tokhtamysh took the opportunity to flee again. He sought refuge at the court of Timur (Tamerlane), where he arrived in 1376. Winning his favor and support, Tokhtamysh installed himself at Otrar and Sayram on the Syr Darya in 1376, raiding into Urus Khan&#x27;s territory. Urus&#x27; son Qutluq Buqa attacked and defeated Tokhtamysh, although he himself suffered a fatal wound. Tokhtamysh fled to Timur once more, and returned with an army to fight his enemies. However, he was defeated again, this time by Urus&#x27; son Toqtaqiya. Wounded, Tokhtamysh escaped by swimming across the Syr Darya and once more went to Timur&#x27;s court, at Bukhara. Here he discovered that Urus was advancing in his pursuit, and soon Urus&#x27; envoys arrived, demanding Tokhtamysh&#x27;s extradition. Timur refused to do so and gathered his own forces to oppose Urus. Following a three-month standoff in the winter of 1376–1377, Urus returned home, while Timur&#x27;s forces succeeded in taking Otrar. Learning of Urus&#x27; death, Timur declared Tokhtamysh the new khan, and returned to his own capital, Samarkand.

==Rise to power==
Urus was succeeded as khan by his son Toqtaqiya, who died after two months, and then by his other son, Tīmūr Malik. As before, Tokhtamysh had little luck fighting against a son of Urus, and he was easily defeated by Tīmūr Malik. Tokhtamysh fled to Timur&#x27;s court once again. Hearing that Tīmūr Malik spends his time in drinking and pleasures and ignores affairs of importance, and that the exasperated people desire Tokhtamysh to rule them, Timur sent his forces to Sawran and Otrar, which surrendered. Advancing on Sighnaq, they defeated the enemy at Qara-Tal, and captured and executed Tīmūr Malik, betrayed by his own emirs, in 1379. Tokhtamysh was now installed as khan in Sighnaq, and he spent the rest of the year establishing his authority and harnessing his resources for his next target, Sarai.

In 1380, Tokhtamysh advanced westward, intent on taking over Sarai and the central and western portions of the Golden Horde. His military power intimidated his former host Qāghān Beg in the Ulus of Shiban and Qāghān Beg&#x27;s cousin, the reigning khan ʿArab Shāh, who both submitted to Tokhtamysh. Now khan at Sarai, he crossed the Volga to eliminate the powerful beglerbeg Mamai, master of the westernmost portions of the Golden Horde. Weakened by his defeat at the hands of the Russians at the Battle of Kulikovo earlier that year, and by the death of his puppet khan Tūlāk, Mamai was defeated by Tokhtamysh on the Kalka river in the autumn of 1381, after Tokhtamysh had enticed away a number of Mamai&#x27;s emirs. Mamai fled to the Crimea, but was eventually eliminated by Tokhtamysh&#x27;s agents, who had followed in pursuit, in late 1380 or early 1381.

From a fugitive, Tokhtamysh had become a powerful monarch, the first khan in over two decades to rule both halves (wings) of the Golden Horde. In the space of a little over a year, he had made himself master of the left (eastern) wing, the former Ulus of Orda (called White Horde in some Persian sources and Blue Horde in Turkic ones), and then also master of the right (western) wing, the Ulus of Batu (called Blue Horde in some Persian sources and White Horde in Turkic ones). This promised to restore the greatness of the Golden Horde after a long period of division and internecine conflict. Tokhtamysh proceeded to solidify his authority with wisdom and restraint. Already in early 1381, he restored peace with the Genoese of the Crimea, ensuring himself a steady income. He similarly sought the cooperation of the emirs and tribal chieftains by confirming the privileges that had been conferred to them in the past.

==Campaign against Moscow==
Encouraged by his success, as well as the growth of his manpower and wealth, Tokhtamysh next turned to the Russian principalities, although he did not necessarily seek a conflict from the start. Similarly, the Grand Prince of Vladimir-Suzdal, Dmitry Donskoy had recently defeated Mamai at great cost at Kulikovo, and was not looking for a confrontation, as he would have had difficulty to muster a great army again. He duly acknowledged Tokhtamysh as the new khan and his suzerain, but although he sent rich gifts, Dmitrij withheld the payment of tribute. When Tokhtamysh&#x27;s envoy, Āq Khwāja, came to invite the Russian princes to the khan&#x27;s court for the confirmation of their diplomas of investiture, he was faced with so much hostility by the population, that he turned back after reaching Nižnij Novgorod.

Tokhtamysh prepared for war in 1382. Intending to catch his enemy by surprise, he began by ordering the arrest and robbing of Russian merchants on the Volga and the confiscation of their boats. Crossing the river with his entire army, he attempted to advance secretly, but attracted much attention. Seeking to ingratiate himself with the khan, Grand Prince Oleg Ivanovič of Rjazan&#x27; placed himself at the khan&#x27;s disposal, pointing out the fords over the Oka river; Grand Prince Dmitrij Konstantinovič of Nižnij Novgorod also submitted readily and sent his sons Vasilij and Semën to join Tokhtamysh&#x27;s campaign as guides. Grand Prince Dmitrij of Moscow did not submit, but left a strong garrison in his capital under the Lithuanian prince Ostej and sought out the greater safety of Kostroma, from where he hoped to gather greater forces. After taking Serpukhov, Tokhtamysh&#x27;s forces reached and besieged Moscow on 23 August 1382. Three days later, the citizens were tricked into surrendering by Vasilij and Semën of Nižnij Novgorod, and Tokhtamysh&#x27;s troops stormed into the city, slaughtering, plundering and finally razing it for the insubordination of its ruler. Other cities taken by the Mongols during the campaign included Vladimir, Zvenigorod, Jur&#x27;ev, Perejaslavl&#x27;-Zalesskij, Dmitrov, Kolomna, and Možajsk. On his way back, Tokhtamysh also sacked Rjazan&#x27;, despite the cooperation of its prince.

==Later relations with the Russian principalities==
After the submission of the Russian princes and the resumption of their tribute, Tokhtamysh adopted more conciliatory policies toward them. Dmitrij of Moscow razed Rjazan&#x27; in vengeance for Oleg Ivanovič&#x27;s collaboration with Tokhtamysh against Moscow, but suffered no punishment for it. Mihail Aleksandrovič of Tver&#x27; was invested as Grand Prince of Vladimir and visited Tokhtamysh&#x27;s court with his son Aleksandr, but never succeeded in entering into possession of the Grand Principality, as Tokhtamysh soon forgave Dmitrij of Moscow. Dmitrij had submitted, surrendered his eldest son Vasilij Dmitrievič as hostage, and promised to pay tribute, duly dispatched in 1383. When Dmitrij Konstantinovič of Nižnij Novgorod died the same year, Tokhtamysh granted that principality to his brother Boris Konstantinovič, but gave Suzdal&#x27; to Dmitrij&#x27;s sons Semën and Vasilij. In 1386, Dmitrij of Moscow&#x27;s son Vasilij, hostage at Tokhtamysh&#x27;s court, escaped to Moldavia and made his way to Moscow via Lithuania. Despite some tension, Moscow did not suffer any consequences. On the contrary, when Dmitrij left his son Vasilij the Grand Principality of Vladimir in his will in 1389, Tokhtamysh sanctioned it through his envoy, Shaykh Aḥmad. Semën and Vasilij of Suzdal&#x27; expelled their uncle Boris from Nižnij Novgorod, but he tracked down Tokhtamysh on campaign and returned with a new investiture from the khan in 1390. Russian recruits subsequently served Tokhtamysh in Central Asia. In 1391 Tokhtamysh sent his commander Beg Tut to ravage Vjatka, presumably in response to the depredations of the Ushkuyniks, buccaneers along the Volga; but the buccaneers launched a revenge raid on the area of Bolghar. Seeking cooperation against this and other threats, Tokhtamysh received Vasilij I of Moscow in his camp and invested him with the domain of Nižnij Novgorod despite the protests of its princes. Despite his sack of Moscow in 1382, Tokhtamysh had strengthened the power and wealth of its ruler in the end, helping set it on the path to annexing other Russian, and later Mongol polities.

==Initial conflict with Timur==

In 1383, taking advantage of Timur&#x27;s preoccupation with affairs in Persia, Tokhtamysh restored the Golden Horde&#x27;s authority over the semi-autonomous Ṣūfī Dynasty in Khwarazm, apparently without provoking his former patron. Under pressure from his emirs to provide profitable campaigns for plunder and perhaps possessed by the traditional ambitions of his predecessors, Tokhtamysh crossed the Caucasus with a large force (5 &quot;tumens&quot;, 50,000 troops) during the winter of 1384–1385, invading Jalayirid Azerbaijan. He captured the capital, Tabriz, by storm and ravaged the neighboring area for ten days, before retiring with his plunder, including some 200,000 slaves, among them thousands of Armenians from the districts of Parskahayk, Syunik, and Artsakh. Either to take advantage of Jalayirid weakness or to preempt the expansion of the Golden Horde into the area, Timur proceeded to conquer Azerbaijan in 1386. He was wintering in nearby Karabakh in 1386–1387, when Tokhtamysh crossed the mountains in the spring of 1387 and headed straight for him. Despite being taken by surprise and being nearly defeated, Timur&#x27;s commanders rallied and succeeded in repelling Tokhtamysh&#x27;s attack with the help of timely reinforcements led by Timur&#x27;s son Mīrān Shāh. Timur showed remarkable leniency to the captured warriors of Tokhtamysh, feeding and clothing them and allowing them to return home. Whether this was a sign of respect toward a royal descendant of Chinggis Khan or an attempt to defuse an unnecessary conflict on an unwanted front is unclear.

Despite his defeat and a subsequent message seeking to defuse the hostility, Tokhtamysh continued to provoke his former protector. While Timur remained in Persia, in the winter of 1387–1388, Tokhtamysh overran Central Asia, where part of his forces besieged Sawran, while another crossed Khwarazm to besiege Bukhara. Timur&#x27;s commanders prepared to defend Samarqand and other towns against the expected continued advance of Tokhtamysh, and Timur himself headed back from Shiraz to Samarqand with his main forces in February 1388. Learning of the enemy&#x27;s movements, Tokhtamysh&#x27;s forces retreated. Timur was now convinced that a serious contest with Tokhtamysh was inevitable. He overthrew the Ṣūfī Dynasty of Khwarazm for its collusion with Tokhtamysh and razed to the ground its capital, (old) Gurgānj, in 1388. Increasingly aware that he was outmatched, Tokhtamysh sought to create an anti-Timurid coalition, reaching out to neighboring rulers (including the Mamluk sultan Barqūq) concerned by Timur&#x27;s power. Tokhtamysh attempted to take Sawran again in 1388, was driven off by Timur in the snowy January of 1389, but made another attack on Sawran later in the year. It also failed, but Tokhtamysh&#x27;s forces pillaged the neighborhood and plundered the town of Yasī (now Turkistan) before retreating to safety when Timur defeated Tokhtamysh&#x27;s vanguard and crossed the Syr Darya in pursuit. Timur seized Sighnaq but then diverted his attention to Tokhtamysh&#x27;s allies farther east.

==First Timurid invasion into the Golden Horde and its aftermath==
Timur determined to take the initiative and strike decisively into Tokhtamysh&#x27;s core territories. Gathering a large army, he set out in February 1391 from Tashkent, ignored Tokhtamysh&#x27;s envoys seeking peace, and struck into the territories of the former Ulus of Orda. But for four months of traveling and hunting, Timur failed to catch up with Tokhtamysh, who had seemingly retreated northwards. Only after reaching the headwaters of the Tobol did Timur discover that Tokhtamysh was regrouping to the west, across the Ural and planning to defend the crossing. Timur advanced on the Ural and crossed it farther upstream, causing Tokhtamysh to retreat in the direction of the Volga, where he could expect the arrival of reinforcements from the Crimea, Bolghar, and even Russia. Determined to preempt this, Timur caught up with Tokhtamysh and forced him to give battle at the Kondurcha river, on 18 June 1391. The hard-fought battle ended in the rout of Tokhtamysh&#x27;s forces and his flight from the battlefield; many of his soldiers, trapped between the enemy and the Volga, were captured or slaughtered. Timur and his victorious army celebrated for over a month by the banks of the Volga. Surprisingly, he did not attempt to consolidate his control over the area before heading for home.

At their request, Timur left behind two princes descended from Tuqa-Timur, Tīmūr Qutluq (son of Qutluq Tīmūr) and Kunche Oghlan (Tīmūr Qutluq&#x27;s paternal uncle), as well as the Manghit emir Edigu (Tīmūr Qutluq&#x27;s maternal uncle). This is sometimes interpreted as Timur&#x27;s investiture of Tīmūr Qutluq as khan, but that seems unlikely: the three were supposed to recruit additional troop for the Timurid army. Only Kunche Oghlan remained faithful to his vow, and returned to Timur with his recruits, before deserting Tokhtamysh the next year. Meanwhile, Tīmūr Qutluq and Egidu struck out on their own with a growing following and appear to have declared Tīmūr Qutluq khan in the left (eastern) wing of the Golden Horde. One of Tokhtamysh&#x27;s commanders, Beg Pūlād (possibly a grandson of Urus Khan), who had escaped from the Battle of Kondurcha, had declared himself khan at Sarai in the expectation that Tokhtamysh had perished.

Tokhtamysh had survived and still commanded sufficient authority and manpower to strike back. Defeating and expelling Beg Pūlād from Sarai, Tokhtamysh chased him into the Crimea and, after besieging him in Solkhat, finally killed him. Another would-be challenger in the Crimea, Tokhtamysh&#x27;s second cousin Tāsh Tīmūr, temporarily recognized Tokhtamysh&#x27;s rule but retained some autonomy. Tokhtamysh dealt similarly with Edigu, coming to terms with him in exchange for his submission, and leaving him with autonomous authority in the east, greatly weakening the position of Tīmūr Qutluq. Tokhtamysh felt powerful enough to demand tribute from the Polish King Władysław II Jagiełło in 1393 for the lands his father, Grand Duke Algirdas of Lithuania, had taken from the Golden Horde in the past. His demands were met. Tokhtamysh sought to create an anti-Timurid coalition once more, reaching out to the Mamluk sultan Barqūq, the Ottoman sultan Bayezit I, and the Georgian king Giorgi VII. Timur retaliated by invading Georgia. Although he seems to have had troubles with his own emirs in the summer of 1394, that autumn Tokhtamysh was able to raid across the Caucasus into Shirvan. The approach of Timur caused an immediate retreat.

==Second Timurid invasion into the Golden Horde and its aftermath==
Timur now determined that a second campaign into the Golden Horde was necessary. After some diplomatic dissimulation on both sides, Timur set out with a great army towards Derbent in March 1395. After crossing the pass, Timur&#x27;s army ravaged the area up to the Terek, where it encountered the forces of Tokhtamysh. After Timur&#x27;s troops destroyed Tokhtamysh&#x27;s vanguard, the main battle took place on 15–16 April 1395. Like the battle on the Kondurcha four year earlier, it was a hard-fought engagement between nearly equal forces. Although Timur, who fought like a common warrior, was nearly captured or killed, he once again emerged victorious, after a dissension among Tokhtamysh&#x27;s emirs. Tokhtamysh fled north to Bolghar and later perhaps to Moldavia. Part of Timur&#x27;s forces gave chase, catching up with some of the enemy by the Volga and driving them into it; Timur&#x27;s local allies, led by the Jochid prince Quyurchuq, a son of Urus Khan, advanced on the opposite, left bank of the Volga, to take over the area. Timur probed north, as far as Yelets, before turning to ravaging the cities of the Golden Horde. At Tana, he was happy to receive rich gifts from the Italian merchants before enslaving all Christians and destroying their facilities. Passing though Circassia, he proceeded to pillage and destroy the cities along the Volga, from (old) Astrakhan to Sarai, to Gülistan, in the winter of 1395–1396; the surviving inhabitants were enslaved and &quot;driven like sheep.&quot; Timur set out for Samarkand via Derbent in the spring of 1396, laden with plunder and accompanied by herds and captives, including merchants, artists, and craftsmen, leaving the Golden Horde exhausted and pillaged.

Tokhtamysh survived Timur&#x27;s onslaught, but his position was far more tenuous than before. The ruined capital, Sarai, was in the hands of Timur&#x27;s protégé Quyurchuq, while the area of Astrakhan and the eastern portions of the Golden Horde were under the control of Tīmūr Qutluq and Edigu, who had joined forces once again. They soon expelled or eliminated Quyurchuq, taking over Sarai in 1396 or 1397, but mollified Timur by assuring him of their submission through an embassy in 1398. Meanwhile, Tokhtamysh had set about reasserting his authority in the southwestern portions of the Golden Horde, killing his cousin Tāsh Tīmūr, who had declared himself khan in the Crimea, and fighting the Genoese there, besieging Kaffa in 1397. In late 1397 or early 1398, Tokhtamysh briefly triumphed over his rivals, taking over Sarai and the Volga towns, and sent out jubilant missives through his envoys all round. But his success was short-lived: Tokhtamysh was defeated in battle by Tīmūr Qutluq and fled first to the Crimea, where he was met with hostility, then via Kiev to Grand Prince Vytautas of Lithuania. Vytautas settled Tokhtamysh and his followers near Vilnius and Trakai, although many of them abandoned him, making their way to the Balkans to enter the service of the Ottoman sultan Bayezit I. Tokhtamysh and Vytautas signed a treaty in which Tokhtamysh confirmed Vytautas as a rightful ruler of Ruthenian lands that were once part of the Golden Horde, and now belonged to Lithuania, and promised him the tribute of the Russian principalities, in exchange for military assistance to recover his throne. Possibly the treaty still stipulated that Vytautas would pay tribute from these the Ruthenian lands once the khan regained his throne. Vytautas was possibly planning to establish himself as overlord in the lands of the Golden Horde.

==Exile==
Tīmūr Qutluq sent an envoy to demand Tokhtamysh&#x27;s extradition from Lithuania, but received an ominous answer from Vytautas: &quot;I will not give up Tsar Tokhtamysh, but wish to meet Tsar Temir-Kutlu in person.&quot; Vytautas and Tokhtamysh prepared their Lithuanian and Mongol forces for a joint campaign, supported by Polish volunteers under Spytek of Melsztyn. In the summer of 1399, Vytautas and Tokhtamysh set out against Tīmūr Qutluq and Edigu with a large army. On the Vorskla River they encountered the forces of Tīmūr Qutluq, who opened negotiations, intending to delay the engagement until Edigu could arrive with reinforcements. In the process, Tīmūr Qutluq pretended to agree to submit to Vytautas and pay him annual tribute but requested a three-day delay to consider Vytautas&#x27; further demands. This was sufficient for Edigu to arrive with his reinforcements. Edigu could not resist the temptation to bandy words with the Lithuanian ruler himself, and arranged a meeting, separated by the course of the river. Further negotiations having proven pointless, the two forces engaged in the Battle of the Vorskla River on 12 August 1399. Using a feigned retreat tactic, Tīmūr Qutluq and Edigu were able to envelop the forces of Vytautas and Tokhtamysh, inflicting a serious defeat on them. Tokhtamysh fled the battlefield and made his way east to Sibir; Vytautas survived the battle, although some twenty princes, including two of his cousins fell in the fight. The defeat was disastrous, ending Vytautas&#x27; ambitious policy in the Pontic steppes.

==Death==

Reduced to the position of an adventurer, Tokhtamysh made his way across the territory of the Golden Horde to its peripheral Siberian possessions. Here he succeeded in bringing parts of the area under his control in 1400, and by 1405 was attempting to ingratiate himself with his protector-turned-enemy, Timur, who had just quarreled with Edigu. Timur&#x27;s death in February 1405 made any rapprochement moot. Throughout this period, Tokhtamysh naturally attracted the hostility of Edigu and his new puppet khan, Shādī Beg. Edigu is said to have fought Tokhtamysh on sixteen separate occasions between 1400 and 1406; in the final instance, after a reverse at the hands of Tokhtamysh, Edigu spread a rumor about his own death to draw Tokhtamysh out into the open and have him killed in a hail of darts and spears, late in 1406, near Tyumen. Khan Shādī Beg apparently claimed or was given credit for the death of Tokhtamysh, while others credited Edigu or Edigu&#x27;s son Nūr ad-Dīn. Russian chroniclers recorded his death in 1406:

==Legacy==
When he reunified the Golden Horde in 1380–1381, Tokhtamysh promised to revitalize and stabilize it after two decades of chronic civil war. He was the last khan of the Golden Horde who minted coins with Mongolian script. His sack of Moscow in 1382 undid the setback suffered by the Golden Horde in its domination over the Russian principalities at the Battle of Kulikovo two years earlier. Finally, the invasion of Azerbaijan followed in the path of the aspirations of earlier khans for the exploitation or conquest of that region. In 1385, Tokhtamysh was at the height of his power and his future, as well as that of the Golden Horde, looked bright.

However, in entering into and exacerbating the conflict with his former protector Timur, Tokhtamysh set a course for the undoing of all his achievements and for his own destruction. Seeking allies, after he had weakened Moscow, he strengthened it with the concession of making the Grand Principality of Vladimir a hereditary possession of the Prince of Moscow in 1389, and by allowing it to take over Nižnij Novgorod in 1393. Similarly, he helped Lithuania establish a precedent for involving itself in the government and politics of the Golden Horde, and making and unmaking khans, several of them Tokhtamysh&#x27;s sons, for decades to come. Neither of these alliances saved Tokhtamysh, whose authority was dealt severe setbacks by the two great invasions of Timur into the core territories of the Golden Horde in 1391 and 1395–1396. These left Tokhtamysh competing with rival khans, ultimately driving him out definitively, and hounding him to his death in Sibir in 1406. Tokhtamysh&#x27;s relative solidification of the khan&#x27;s authority survived him only briefly, and largely due to the influence of his nemesis Edigu; but after 1411 it gave way to another long period of civil war that ended in the disintegration of the Golden Horde. Moreover, Timur&#x27;s destruction of the Golden Horde&#x27;s main urban centers, as well as the Italian colony of Tana, dealt a severe and lasting blow to the trade-based economy of the polity, with various negative implications for its future prospects for prosperity and survival.

==Family==

Among others, Tokhtamysh had married the widow of Mamai, probably identical with a daughter of Berdi Beg and with the Tulun Beg Khanum who had briefly ruled at Sarai in 1370–1371; in 1386 he had her executed, apparently for participating in an obscure conspiracy. According to the &quot;Muʿizz al-ansāb&quot;, Tokhtamysh had eight sons and five daughters, as well as six grandchildren, as follows.

<text>Tempest is a 1981 arcade video game by Atari, Inc., designed and programmed by Dave Theurer. It takes place on a three-dimensional surface divided into lanes, sometimes as a closed tube, and viewed from one end. The player controls a claw-shaped &quot;blaster&quot; that sits on the edge of the surface, snapping from segment to segment as a rotary knob is turned, and can fire blaster shots to destroy enemies and obstacles by pressing a button.

&quot;Tempest&quot; was one of the first games to use Atari&#x27;s Color-QuadraScan vector display technology. It was also the first to let players choose their starting level (a system Atari called &quot;SkillStep&quot;). This feature increases the preferred starting level, which could also be used to let the player continue the previous game if they wished. &quot;Tempest&quot; was one of the first video games that had a progressive level design where the levels themselves varied rather than giving the player the same layout with increasing difficulty.

==Gameplay==
The goal in &quot;Tempest&quot; is to survive and score as many points as possible, by clearing the screen of enemies that appear on the playing field. The player controls an articulating, claw-shaped ship at the near end of the field (referred to as a &quot;blaster&quot;, or in some sources as the &quot;Live Wire&quot;), moving it left and right using a rotary knob. The player can rapid-fire shots down individual lanes of the field, destroying any enemies or projectiles within the same lane. The blaster is also equipped with a &quot;Superzapper&quot; which, once per level, destroys all enemies currently on the field. A second use of the Superzapper in the same level destroys one random enemy. The Superzapper is recharged between each level.

The game features sixteen unique levels of different shapes, including geometric shapes, a flat line, and the symbol for infinity. Some levels are closed tubes that allow the player to loop throughout it continuously, while others have definite left and right endpoints. When all sixteen levels have been played, the sequence repeats with a different color scheme and higher difficulty. One set of levels (65 through 80) is &quot;invisible&quot; (black). After reaching Stage 99, the level counter stops increasing and each successive level shape is picked randomly.

Enemies first appear on the screen as swirling dots beyond the far end of the field, initially showing up one at a time, but coming faster and in greater numbers the more the game progresses. There are seven types of enemies in the game, each with their own behavior pattern. Flippers, shaped like pairs of linked chevrons, attempt to catch the player&#x27;s blaster and drag it to the far end of the field, costing a life if successful. Pulsars, shaped like wavy lines, periodically electrify the lane which they occupy; if the player&#x27;s ship is in the lane at that moment, it is destroyed. Fuseballs, white spheres with multiple tendrils, jump forward and back unpredictably along the edges of each lane, destroying the player&#x27;s ship on contact. They move slowly between the lanes which gives the player a brief opportunity to shoot them. Spikers are spirals that move up and down a lane, leaving a line of &quot;spikes&quot; which may be worn down by shooting it. After the first few levels, each level has a short line of spikes at the far end of every lane. Tankers, rhomboid in shape, slowly advance up the field in a particular lane, splitting into two Flippers upon destruction or reaching the player&#x27;s ring. Later levels also feature Fuseball and Pulsar Tankers, which split into two Fuseballs or two Pulsars when hit, respectively. Aside from the Fuseball and Pulsar, enemies can shoot destructible projectiles up the lane they reside in, which will destroy the player&#x27;s ship if they impact.

When all enemies on the field have been destroyed, the player &quot;warps&quot; to the next level by traveling down the field and into the space beyond it. The player must avoid or destroy any spikes that are in the way; hitting one will destroy the player&#x27;s ship and the warp will have to be retried.

The player loses a life when their ship is destroyed or captured, and the game ends when all lives are lost. Extra lives (up to six at a time) are awarded at certain score intervals.

==Development==
The game was initially meant to be a first-person remake of &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, but early versions had many problems, so a new design was used. Theurer says the design came from a nightmare where monsters crawled out of a hole in the ground. This led to him coming up with the design concept, stating he &quot;basically just took &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and wrapped the surface into a circle,&quot; while monsters &quot;come down the tunnel at you, out of the hole, and you [try] to kill them before they [get] out.&quot; During the prototype stages the game was called &quot;Aliens&quot;, then &quot;Vortex&quot;, and finally &quot;Tempest&quot;.

Three different cabinet designs exist for &quot;Tempest&quot;. The most common is an upright cabinet that, viewed from the side, is in the shape of a right triangle sitting on a rectangle. This cabinet sported colorful side art. A shorter, less flashy cabaret-style cabinet was also released with optional side art. A cocktail-style table cabinet allowed two players to play at opposite ends of the table; the screen automatically flipped for each player.

In the first games Atari shipped, there were glitches in one or more of the ROM chips. The problem code allowed the player to do unintended things when ending their score in certain two-digit combinations. According to &quot;Joystik&quot; magazine, which detailed these combinations, the most useful were the ones that earned the player 40 free credits (06, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18) and the &quot;jump to green&quot; trick (46). Another useful combination mentioned was 05 which allowed the player to play the game in the attract mode. In this scenario, pausing at one the combinations would cause the effect to take place immediately without losing the balance of the player&#x27;s lives. Also, in the attract mode, pausing at an end score of 48 gave the player 255 extra lives. After this issue was discovered, Atari corrected the problem so that future machines were incapable of allowing the end score tricks. It was also noted in &quot;Joystik&quot; that Atari shipped updated chips to be replaced in the field.

==Ports==
An official port was released for the Atari ST. An official port that bears the Atari logo was released by Superior Software for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron in 1985, and another by Electric Dreams for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC in 1987. Versions for the Atari 2600 and 5200 were in the works in Atari, Inc. during 1984, and unfinished prototypes exist for both of them. The game was released for Microsoft Windows 3.x as part of the &quot;Microsoft Arcade&quot; package. It has 14 secret levels. The original &quot;Tempest&quot; was included as part of &quot; Arcade&#x27;s Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 1&quot; for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and Super NES. In 2001, Infogrames and Digital Eclipse ported 12 Atari arcade games (one of them being the original &quot;Tempest&quot;) under the compilation title &quot;Atari Anniversary Edition&quot;, released for PC and Dreamcast. A PlayStation compilation titled &quot;Atari Anniversary Edition Redux&quot; was also released with the same number of games plus two exclusives to the Redux edition. A handheld compilation, titled &quot;Atari Anniversary Advance&quot;, was released in 2002 for the Game Boy Advance with half the games of the console compilation, including &quot;Tempest&quot;. In 2005, the original &quot;Tempest&quot; is part of &quot;Atari Anthology&quot; for the Xbox and PlayStation 2; the PC version also includes the Atari 2600 prototype. The 2600 port was also released as part of the &quot;Atari Greatest Hits&quot; compilation for Nintendo DS and iOS devices. Also in 2005, a port and graphical &quot;remix&quot; of the original &quot;Tempest&quot; was included as part of &quot;Retro Atari Classics&quot; for the Nintendo DS. This version deviates significantly from the basic rules and experience of the original game. &quot;Tempest&quot; was released for Xbox 360 on December 19, 2007, which was available for purchase through Xbox Live Arcade for 400 MS Points. This version includes the original arcade game (emulated) and an &quot;evolved&quot; version with updated graphics.

After the unfinished Atari 5200 prototype was found in 1999, its original programmer, Keithen Hayenga, resumed work on finishing the port. It was published by AtariAge in 2013 for US$50.

In 2022, &quot;Tempest&quot; became a part of &quot;Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration&quot;.
==Reception==

Chris Crawford wrote in 1982 that unlike &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Tempest&quot; &quot;intimidates many beginners because it appears to be unwinnable&quot;; its smoothly increasing difficulty, however, encourages players to continue playing. In 1995, Flux magazine ranked the game 6th on their Top 100 Video Games. They lauded the game saying: &quot;The best vector coin-up machine for white knuckle intensity, bar none, was Tempest.&quot; In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the arcade version as number 74 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting &quot;it&#x27;s very fast, it has abstract, color vector graphics that remain unequaled to this day, and its novel &#x27;paddle&#x27; controller makes playing &quot;Tempest&quot; effortless. The game&#x27;s difficulty advances smoothly, and the play is extremely well balanced&quot;. &quot;Tempest&quot; is #10 on the KLOV&#x27;s list of most popular games, tied with &quot;Centipede&quot;.

The game has been cited as an influence on the careers of video game designers Jeff Minter and John O&#x27;Neill. Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell has said it is his favorite game to be published by the company.

==Legacy==
Shortly after the original game was released, an arcade owner named Duncan Brown hacked the level data and made an altered, harder version: &quot;Tempest Tubes&quot;. It was eventually included with &quot;Tempest&quot; in the Hasbro compilation &quot;Atari Arcade Hits: Volume 1&quot; for Microsoft Windows in 1999.

===Sequels===
Jeff Minter created two authorized games, released long after the original: &quot;Tempest 2000&quot; (1994) for the Atari Jaguar (renamed &quot;Tempest X3&quot; for the PlayStation port), and &quot;Tempest 3000&quot; (2000) for Nuon enhanced DVD players. In July 2018, &quot;Tempest 4000&quot; was released for multiple platforms. Minter also wrote two games inspired by &quot;Tempest&quot;: &quot;Space Giraffe&quot; (2007) and &quot;TxK&quot; (2014). After &quot;TxK&quot; was released for the PlayStation Vita, the current incarnation of Atari blocked release of the game for additional platforms until it was reworked as &quot;Tempest 4000&quot; some years later.

===Clones===

1980s home computer clones include &quot;Web War&quot; for the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro published by Artic Computing in 1985, &quot;Tubeway&quot; (1982) for the Apple II, &quot;Storm&quot; (1984) for the Tandy Color Computer, and &quot;Livewire!&quot;, a type-in game for Atari 8-bit computers printed in &quot;ANALOG Computing&quot; in 1983. The &quot;Tempest&quot;-inspired &quot;Axis Assassin&quot; (1983) was one of the first five releases from Electronic Arts.

&quot;Arashi&quot; is a 1992 freeware clone for classic Mac OS. &quot;Whirlwind&quot; (1994) is a commercial game that &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described as &quot;a clone of &quot;Tempest&quot;&quot;.

===In popular culture===
*&quot;Tempest&quot; is part of a plot thread in the 1984 film &quot;Night of the Comet&quot;.
*&quot;Tempest&quot; is featured prominently in the music video for Rush&#x27;s 1982 song &quot;Subdivisions&quot;.

* In the pilot episode of the television series &quot;Numbers&quot;, Larry Fleinhardt plays &quot;Tempest&quot; while advising someone on a mathematical problem. Larry is later seen playing the game in the season four episode &quot;End Game&quot;.
* Tempest is one of the video games in the TV comedy &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;.
* Tempest is seen in &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; played by Jeremy Licht as Anthony in the Segment 3 remake of the original Episode &quot;It&#x27;s A Good Life&quot; and later, the game&#x27;s sounds can be heard when Anthony&#x27;s powers fully manifest.

<text>Fairway is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa. Situated in the northern suburbs, it is found adjacent to the Wanderers Club. It is located in Region E of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality.

==History==
Prior to the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand in 1886, the suburb lay on land on one of the original farms called &quot;Syferfontein&quot;. It became a suburb on 29 June 1955 and the suburbs name originates after the nearby Wanderers Golf Club.

<doc id="746577" wikidata="Q7752136" url="?curid=746577" title="The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief">
<text>The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief is the fourth album by the comedy group Monty Python, released in 1973. Most of the material was newly written for the album along with a handful of sketches from the third series of &quot;Flying Circus&quot;, one from the second (&quot;Bruces&quot;) and another from the first (&quot;Pet Conversions&quot;). The team were once again joined by Neil Innes, who provided a trio of rock music parodies for &quot;The Background to History&quot;. The album was famously mixed and edited in a garden shed belonging to the father of producer Andre Jacquemin.

== Background ==
The initial pressings were designed to resemble a box containing a tie and handkerchief, the concept being that the record was merely a &#x27;free gift&#x27; included with the package. It was also notable for its inner artwork, which was visible through a cutaway hole in the album&#x27;s outer sleeve. It appeared to be a simple Terry Gilliam artwork of a tie and handkerchief, but when the card insert was pulled out it revealed that the tie and handkerchief were actually on a man hanging from a gallows. A second insert featured the album credits and the text to &quot;The Background to History&quot; sketch. The US release had a different cover design with the two insert sheets printed on either side of a card inner sleeve. Later releases of the album would have just a picture of the clothing on the front cover, without the inserts.

The album&#x27;s original LP edition is particularly notable in that it was mastered with two concentric grooves on side two, so that different material would be played depending on where the stylus was put down on the record&#x27;s surface. For this reason it is sometimes referred to as a &quot;three-sided&quot; record. The album did not have a track listing, so that this feature would come as a complete surprise to listeners, who might on a subsequent listening hear material they had never heard before, creating genuine confusion. To further confuse the listener, both sides of the record label were labelled &quot;FREE RECORD Given away with the Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief – Side 2&quot; – only the matrix numbers identify which are the first and second sides. The cutting was carried out by George &quot;Porky&quot; Peckham, who became known for etching messages into runout grooves. This was the first of many Python albums to bear one of these so-called &quot;Porky Prime Cuts&quot; – a brief message on Side 2 which reads: &quot;&quot;. 

Since the record had two concentric grooves, they were spaced considerably apart, halving the length of the playing time. Subsequent editions of the vinyl incorporated both grooves sequentially as separate tracks, eliminating the double groove. Likewise with promotional copies for radio stations, as they were banded for airplay. However, when Virgin reissued the album in the UK in 1985, the double groove was retained, but with the &quot;Great Actors&quot; sketch cut from the end of Side 1 and moved onto the start of the second side which previously began with &quot;The Background to History&quot;. This meant the two B-sides no longer had equal length, resulting in a long silence following the &quot;Phone-In&quot; sketch at the end of the second Side B.

== Release ==
The album reached No. 49 on the UK album chart.

No single was released from the album in the UK but the belated US release (the group&#x27;s first on Arista) in 1975 was promoted by a 7&quot; single entitled &quot;The Single&quot; (AS 0130) which consisted of three excerpts from the album tracks &quot;Elephantoplasty&quot;, &quot;Mrs Niggerbaiter&quot; and &quot;Pet Conversions&quot;. Both sides of the record were labelled Side B, with the other side containing &quot;The Cheese Shop&quot; in its entirety.

The 2006 reissue featured new sound effects on some sketches as well as four previously unreleased bonus tracks, although these date from the 1980 &quot;Contractual Obligation Album&quot; sessions.

The 2014 LP reissue by Virgin Record Ltd. contains the original version of the album without bonus tracks. It also restores the two concentric grooves on Side 2. The new lacquer has been cut by Abbey Road Studios engineer Sean Magee.

== Legacy ==
Post-punk band Department S took the name of their 1981 hit single &quot;Is Vic There?&quot; from a line of dialogue from the album&#x27;s closing &quot;Phone-In&quot; sketch.

== Track listing ==
The following sketches are from the TV series: &quot;Dead Bishop&quot;, &quot;Bruces&quot;, &quot;Cheese Shop&quot;, &quot;Boxing Tonight&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Niggerbaiter&quot;, &quot;Oscar Wilde&quot;, and &quot;Pet Conversions&quot;. The remainder are exclusive to this album.

<text>USL League Two (USL2), formerly the Premier Development League (PDL), is a semi-professional soccer league sponsored by United Soccer Leagues in the United States and Canada, forming part of the United States soccer league system. The league will feature 144 teams for the 2025 season, split into nineteen regional divisions across four conferences. USL League Two is headquartered in Tampa, Florida.

The Seacoast United Phantoms are the current champions, having defeated Peoria City 3–2 in extra time to win the 2024 USL League Two Championship final on August 3, 2024.

==Competition format==
USL League Two is divided into 4 conferences (Eastern, Central, Southern, and Western), comprising 19 divisions. The league season runs from May through July, with the playoffs decided through July and August. All teams play a regular season schedule of 12-14 games, up to seven home and seven away, within their division, depending on the size of the division.

===Playoffs===
The USL2 playoffs see division winners and each conference&#x27;s best second-place finishers advance to the conference quarter finals. All matches in the playoffs are played in single match elimination format, with each conference winner hosting a four-team conference championship weekend. The four conference champions advance to national semi-finals and the league Championship, both played at the home of the higher seed.

==History==
===1990s===
In 1995 the United States Interregional Soccer League (USISL) changed its name to the United States International Soccer League, and split into two leagues, one professional (the &#x27;Professional League&#x27;, which ultimately became the USL Second Division) and one amateur (the Premier League). The purpose for the split was to expand into and improve the soccer capabilities of many urban areas throughout the United States and Canada, while offering current college soccer players the opportunity to continue playing during the summer months without losing their college eligibility. The inaugural season of the new USISL Premier League featured 27 teams, and the Richmond Kickers won the first title, beating the Cocoa Expos 3–1 in the championship game. Gabe Jones of the Austin Lone Stars was the league&#x27;s top scorer and MVP.

The United States International Soccer League changed its name again in 1996, to the United Systems of Independent Soccer Leagues, and before the season, there was substantial movement of teams between the Pro League, the Premier League and the newly created Select League (which would later merge with the A-League, and eventually become the USL First Division). The Premier League grew to 34 teams in its second year, with the Central Coast Roadrunners from San Luis Obispo, California, beating the San Francisco Bay Seals in the championship game to take the title. Pasi Kinturi of the Nashville Metros was the league&#x27;s top scorer and MVP.
The Premier League renamed itself the Premier Development Soccer League (PDSL) in 1997, and the Central Coast Roadrunners repeated as national champions, the first team to do so, beating the Cocoa Expos in the PDSL championship game. Lester Felicia of the Jackson Chargers was the league&#x27;s MVP, while Rodrigo Costa of the Detroit Dynamite was the leading scorer and the league&#x27;s Rookie of the Year, tallying 21 goals and 2 assists for 44 points. In 1998 the PDSL took to the field with 33 teams, including four associate members from the Pacific Coast Soccer League who played shortened schedules after their PCSL season was over. In the championship game the San Gabriel Valley Highlanders upset regular season champions Jackson Chargers 3–2, taking the trophy to California for the third straight year. Rodrigo Costa of the Detroit Dynamite was the league MVP, Boniventure Manati of the Jackson Chargers was the league&#x27;s top scorer, and a young striker by the name of Brian Ching from the Spokane Shadow was named Rookie of the Year.

In 1999 the umbrella USISL changed its name to the United Soccer Leagues, and the Premier Development Soccer League dropped the &#x27;soccer&#x27; part of its name and became known as the USL Premier Development League, or PDL. The league took in several teams from the D3 Pro league, expanding to 42 teams in six divisions. Expansion franchise Chicago Sockers ultimately won the league, beating Spokane Shadow 3–1 for the title in a tight championship game. Fabio Eidenwein of the Sioux City Breeze was named League MVP and was the top scorer, with 20 goals.

===2000s===

The PDL expanded by a further eight franchises in 2000, and the Chicago Sockers won their second straight title, beating the Mid-Michigan Bucks in a close 1–0 championship game. The single goal was scored by Rodrigo Costa who, having received a pass from teammate Hamid Mehreioskouei, chipped Bucks goalkeeper Eric Pogue from 18 yards through a crowded penalty area. Fernando Salazar of the Los Angeles-based San Fernando Valley Heroes was the league&#x27;s MVP, while his teammate Arshak Abyanli took the honors as top goalscorer.

The league grew from 41 to 44 teams in 2001 through the usual mix of relegation from D3Pro, teams folding and new franchises being added. In the semi-finals, the Westchester Flames defeated Sioux Falls Spitfire 5–1 and Calgary Storm defeated Des Moines Menace 2–1; in the final, Westchester defeated Calgary 3–1 to take their first league title. Des Moines and Chicago Fire Reserves dominated the 2002 regular season, but both teams stuttered in the playoffs; the PDL final saw the Cape Cod Crusaders defeating the Boulder Rapids Reserve 2–1 to bring the title to the Northeast for the second year in a row. 2002 also saw the debut of the soon-to-be PDL legend, Tomas Boltnar of Des Moines Menace, who secured an unprecedented triple-crown of PDL MVP, Top Scorer and Rookie of the Year.

The mid-2000s was a period of steady growth and consolidation for the PDL. A TV agreement with Fox Soccer Channel saw the PDL Championship game being broadcast live on national television in North America for the first time, and professional teams began investing in the league by adding U-23 development sides as an addition to their senior rosters. Cape Cod repeated as PDL champs in 2003, beating the Chicago Fire Reserves in the final (and despite the presence of Jürgen Klinsmann playing for Orange County Blue Star), while 2004 saw the title head to Florida for the first time as the Central Florida Kraze overcame perennial bridesmaids Boulder Rapids Reserve.

Des Moines Menace took the PDL Championship trophy back to Iowa in 2005 after beating the El Paso Patriots 6–5 on penalty kicks, following a 0–0 draw in the PDL Championship game. 2006 saw the beginning of two seasons of dominance for two teams: the Michigan Bucks and the Laredo Heat. Both teams made the PDL Final in 2006 and 2007, with the Bucks emerging victorious in &#x27;06 with a 2–1 win thanks to goals by Kenny Uzoigwe and Ty Shipalane, only for Laredo to get their revenge the following year with an epic penalty kicks win after a 0–0 tie in regulation time.

Laredo became the first team to make three consecutive PDL championship games in 2008, but fell at the final hurdle to Thunder Bay Chill, who became the first ever Canadian side to win the PDL following their 4–1 penalty shootout victory. The PDL had grown to 68 teams by 2009, and to reflect their growing reputation, introduced a new scheme called PDL-Pro, whereby certain teams would be allowed to act as professional clubs, paying players, while still adhering to NCAA collegiate eligibility rules, and the USL&#x27;s own age restriction policy. Ventura County Fusion returned the PDL title to Southern California for the first time in over a decade with a stoppage-time victory over Chicago Fire Premier, and in doing so became the lowest-seeded team to claim the national title.

===2010s===

The 2010s began with a record, as the Portland Timbers U23s ended the season as national champions, beating Thunder Bay Chill 4–1 in the 2010 PDL Championship game. The Timbers also had the best regular season record, winning all their 16 games, scoring 53 goals and conceding just six along the way. In doing so the Timbers became the first team to post a perfect PDL regular season record since the Jackson Chargers in 1998, the first regular season champion to win the playoffs since the Central Coast Roadrunners in 1996, and the first team in PDL history to go through an entire PDL regular season and playoff campaign without posting a loss or a tie. Portland Timbers U23s striker Brent Richards was named League MVP and Rookie of the Year for his stellar campaign with the national champions. Players from Canadian side Thunder Bay Chill led the majority of the statistical categories, with striker Brandon Swartzendruber leading the league with 15 goals, while his teammate Gustavo Oliveira led the league with 13 assists. Portland Timbers U23s goalkeeper Jake Gleeson enjoyed the best goalkeeping statistics, allowing just five goals in 15 games and earning with a 0.360 GAA average.

Western Conference teams dominated the league in 2011 for the third year in a row, with the Kitsap Pumas ending the season as national champions, beating Laredo Heat 1–0 in the 2011 PDL Championship game. Kitsap, who lost just one game and conceded just ten goals all season, were the second team from the Northwest Division to win the national title in a row, while Laredo were contesting their fourth championship game in six years. Kitsap also were the first PDL-Pro team to win the championship, a milestone for the league. Kitsap&#x27;s Western Conference rivals Fresno Fuego had the best regular-season record, posting an unbeaten 13–0–3 record. Fresno midfielder Milton Blanco was named League MVP, after leading the league in points (38) and assists (14) and helping his team to the Southwest Division title. Two Michigan Bucks players – Stewart Givens and Mitch Hildebrandt – were given end-of-season awards as Defender of the Year and Goalkeeper of the Year respectively, while their coach Gary Parsons was named Coach of the Year. Jake Keegan of the Westchester Flames was named Rookie of the Year after tallying 16 goals in 16 games to take the league goal-scoring crown. Keegan accounted for 64 percent of Westchester&#x27;s goals in 2011 and also finished third in the league in points with 34.

The 2012 PDL season would see a resurgence of the Eastern Conference, as the Michigan Bucks would claim the regular season title, with Canadian rivals Forest City London winning their first ever PDL Championship in an East coast contest, defeating Carolina Dynamo 2–1. Canadian clubs would also have another strong season in 2013, with four of eight Canadian clubs finishing in the final eight and two, the Victoria Highlanders and Thunder Bay Chill, advancing to the semi-finals. After a final four finish in 2012, The Chill would repeat their strong season, winning the 2013 regular season title but falling to the Austin Aztex in the Championship final 3–1 in front of a crowd of 4,253 fans, the largest attendance for a final since 2007.

In 2014, the Michigan Bucks would claim their second PDL Championship, defeating the Kitsap Pumas 1–0 on August 3, 2014, following a strong regular season campaign with a record of 9–2–3.

With USL Pro re-branding as the United Soccer League in February 2015, the PDL dropped the &quot;USL&quot; descriptor from their name, simply operating as the &quot;Premier Development League&quot;.

The 2015 season would see league newcomers, New York Red Bulls U-23, put forth a very strong showing, finishing first in the Mid Atlantic Division and making it all the way to the Championship Final, before falling to the lower-seeded K-W United FC, who emerged from the very competitive Great Lakes Division, fending off perennial contenders and rivals Forest City London and the defending champions Michigan Bucks on their path to the final. United would come away winners 4–3 over the Red Bulls on August 3, 2015, at Starfire Stadium in Tukwila, Washington, to claim their first-ever championship and the third for a Canadian club.

In May 2018, the league did not permit Calgary Foothills FC to sign Stephanie Labbé, a goalkeeper for the Canadian women&#x27;s team, even though the team had offered her a position. The decision was made due to her gender. Lubbe filed a lawsuit against the league.

In 2018, it was announced that the PDL would be renamed as USL League Two in advance of the 2019 season.

===2020s===
The league was forced to cancel the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The league returned for the 2021 season, although the Southwest division elected not to play due to concerns over COVID-19. The 2022 season saw the Southwest division return and thus was the first full season for the league since 2019. There were two new divisions added for the 2023 season, the Nor Cal and South Florida divisions, which were formed with expansions and former clubs from the Southwest and Southeast divisions respectively.

The Northwest Division underwent a major expansion for the 2024 season by adding three new teams from the state of Washington.

==Organization==
As USL League Two seasons take place during the summer months, the player pool is drawn mainly from elite college soccer players seeking to continue playing high-level soccer during their summer break, which they can do while still maintaining their college eligibility, as USL2 is not considered a professional league.

Formerly, teams such as Laredo Heat, New Orleans Jesters, Vancouver Whitecaps FC U-23, Kitsap Pumas and the Hollywood United Hitmen had embraced partial professionalism through the PDL-Pro program, whereby teams could choose to employ players who were paid for their performances, but who still met the age eligibility criteria. This did not contravene NCAA rules, which state that college players cannot play &quot;alongside&quot; professionals, but may play &quot;against&quot; them. What this also meant, however, is that PDL-Pro teams could not have any active NCAA players on their rosters, but could employ NAIA and community college players, ex-NCAA players who have already graduated, or other local players who do not play college soccer at all.

Currently, all USL2 teams field amateur U-23 squads. Additionally, USL2 squads often also include standout high school and junior club players, as well as former professionals seeking to continue competing at a high level, often having been forced to retire from top flight competition due to age or injury. League rules dictate that a maximum of eight players on each team&#x27;s 26-man roster can be over 23 years old, while at least three players on each team&#x27;s roster must be 18 or younger.

Increasingly, League Two is seen as a &#x27;shop window&#x27; for professional clubs looking to discover and identify aspiring professional players who may enter the MLS SuperDraft in future years. Many of the players currently playing in Major League Soccer and elsewhere began their careers in the league.

<doc id="746586" wikidata="Q449978" url="?curid=746586" title="M-28 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-28 is an east–west state trunkline highway that traverses nearly all of the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan, from Wakefield to near Sault Ste. Marie in Bruce Township. Along with US Highway 2 (US 2), M-28 forms a pair of primary highways linking the Upper Peninsula from end to end, providing a major access route for traffic from Michigan and Canada along the southern shore of Lake Superior. M-28 is the longest state trunkline in Michigan numbered with the &quot;M-&quot; prefix at . The entire highway is listed on the National Highway System, while three sections of M-28 are part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour. M-28 also carries two memorial highway designations along its route.

Throughout its course across the Upper Peninsula, M-28 passes through forested woodlands, bog swamps, urbanized areas, and along the Lake Superior shoreline. Sections of roadway cross the Ottawa National Forest and both units of the Hiawatha National Forest. Some of the other landmarks accessible from M-28 include the Seney Stretch, Seney National Wildlife Refuge and several historic bridges.

M-28 is an original trunkline designation, dating to the 1919 formation of the state&#x27;s trunkline system. The original highway was much shorter than the current version. M-28 was expanded eastward to the Sault Ste. Marie area in the late 1920s. The western end has been expanded twice to different locations on the Wisconsin state line. Other changes along the routing have led to the creation of three different business loops at various times, with one still extant. Future changes, proposed by Marquette County but not accepted by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), could see M-28 rerouted over County Road 480 (CR 480).

== Route description ==

M-28 is a major highway for Michigan and Canadian traffic along the south shore of Lake Superior. It forms the northern half of a pair of primary trunklines linking the Upper Peninsula from end to end; US 2 is the southern partner. The highway comprises mostly two lanes, undivided except for sections that are concurrent with US 41 near Marquette. The &quot;Marquette Bypass&quot; portion of US 41/M-28 is a four-lane expressway, and segments of the highway in Marquette County have four lanes. The entire route is part of the National Highway System, and three sections of the trunkline are part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour.

=== Western terminus to Shingleton ===
In the west, M-28 begins at a signalized intersection with US 2 in Wakefield. Heading north, the highway passes Sunday Lake heading out of town. After crossing into southwestern Ontonagon County and the Eastern Time Zone, the trunkline highway skirts the northern shore of Lake Gogebic, running concurrently with M-64. The first section of M-28 designated as a part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour is from the western terminus to the eastern junction with M-64 in Bergland, where the Circle Tour turns north along M-64, leaving M-28. Here, M-28 has its lowest traffic counts; within the 2013 MDOT survey, the road is listed with only an average annual daily traffic (AADT) of 1,425 vehicles on a section of highway between Bergland and the US 45 intersection in Bruce Crossing. The trunkline runs through heavily forested areas of southern Houghton and Baraga counties. At the eastern junction with US 41 near Covington, M-28 receives the Circle Tour designation again and exits the Ottawa National Forest.

In Baraga and Marquette counties, US 41/M-28 passes through hilly terrain before entering the urban areas of Ishpeming, Negaunee and Marquette. Approximately 13,000–17,000 vehicles use this section from Ishpeming eastward through Negaunee. West of the city of Marquette, US 41/M-28 had a peak 2013 AADT of 32,805 vehicles in Marquette Township along a retail and business corridor. This peak level is sustained until the start of the Marquette Bypass, where the traffic returns to the 16,500-vehicle and higher levels seen in Ishpeming and Negaunee. South of the city of Marquette, traffic counts once again climb to 19,620 vehicles. In Chocolay Township the AADT drops to 8,840 vehicles before tapering off to 3,065 vehicles by the county line.

At the Ishpeming–Negaunee city line, M-28 changes memorial highway designations. From the western terminus to this point, M-28 is called the &quot;Veterans Memorial Highway&quot;, but it becomes the &quot;D. J. Jacobetti Memorial Highway&quot; to honor the longest-serving member of the Michigan Legislature, Dominic J. Jacobetti. The Jacobetti Highway designation ends at the eastern M-123 junction in Chippewa County.
Between Marquette and Munising, M-28 closely parallels the Lake Superior shoreline, providing scenic views of the lake and its &quot;lonesome sandy beaches&quot;. The Lakenenland sculpture park is located in Chocolay Township near Shot Point in eastern Marquette County. This roadside attraction is owned by Tom Lakenen and features fanciful works of art made of scrap iron. Near the community of Au Train, M-28 crosses into the western unit of the Hiawatha National Forest. West of Munising is a ferry dock offering transport to the Grand Island National Recreation Area, and at Munising there is easy access to Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. The roadway also features variable-message signs to warn motorists of winter weather-related traffic closures along the lakeshore. Installed at the US 41 and M-94 junctions, the signs advise motorists which sections of roadway are closed. Per MDOT policy, only snowplows are allowed on these sections during a closure. The highway exits the Hiawatha National Forest at the Alger County–Schoolcraft County line along the Seney Stretch.

=== Seney Stretch ===

The portion of M-28 between Seney and Shingleton, called the Seney Stretch, is of &quot;straight-as-an-arrow highway&quot; across the Great Manistique Swamp, &quot;though others claim it&#x27;s , only because it seems longer.&quot; The Seney Stretch is the longest such section of highway in the state, and &quot;one of the longest stretches of curveless highway east of the Mississippi.&quot; The highway is often cited as the &quot;state&#x27;s most boring route&quot; according to the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) and &quot;Hunts&#x27; Guide&quot;. The straightness and flatness over a great distance are given as reasons for the reputation of this stretch as boring.

The road across the swamp was constructed parallel to the line of the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway (later the Soo Line Railroad). It was first numbered as a part of M-25 when that designation was used along today&#x27;s M-28 east of US 41. The most significant changes made to the stretch since its original construction were the addition of passing relief lanes and a full-scale, year-round rest area in 1999.

Part of the Seney Stretch forms the northern border of the Seney National Wildlife Refuge. Established in 1935, this refuge is a managed wetland in Schoolcraft County. It has an area of , and contains the Strangmoor Bog National Natural Landmark within its boundaries.

=== Seney to eastern terminus ===

Past Seney, M-28 once again enters woodlands on the eastern end of the Upper Peninsula. In Luce County, the roadway passes through the community of McMillan en route to Newberry. The Circle Tour departs M-28 to follow M-123 at Newberry, looping north to the Tahquamenon Falls State Park. East of town, the road passes Luce County Airport off of Luce CR 399. From there, M-28 crosses the east and west branches of the Sage River and passes south of Soo Junction, before the Chippewa County border.

In Chippewa County, M-28 begins bending slightly east-northeastward. Hulbert Lake is located south of Hulbert; north of the lake, the highway enters the eastern unit of the Hiawatha National Forest. At the eastern junction of M-28 and M-123 near Eckerman and Strongs, the Circle Tour returns to M-28 and the D.J. Jacobetti Memorial Highway designation ends. The highway leaves the eastern unit of the Hiawatha National Forest between the communities of Raco and Brimley. M-221 leads north from the main highway on an old routing of M-28 to connect to the community of Brimley and the Bay Mills Indian Community. Brimley State Park is just east of Brimley on the old 6 Mile Road alignment of M-28. The highway meets Interstate 75 (I-75) at exit 386, and the Lake Superior Circle Tour departs M-28 to follow I-75. This interchange is just west of H-63/Mackinac Trail, a former segment of US 2. M-28 continues farther to its eastern terminus with M-129.

=== Services ===

Along the routing of M-28, MDOT has established several roadside parks and rest areas. Two of these are in Ontonagon County near Ewen and Trout Creek. A park with a picnic area and a footbridge lies near Tioga Creek in Baraga County east of the US 41 junction. In Michigamme a scenic turnout and a roadside park overlook Lake Michigamme, and along Lake Superior south of Marquette is a tourist information center built as a log cabin. East of the H-01 junction in Au Train is a roadside park that includes Scott Falls. Further east, a year-round rest area is located on the western end of the Seney Stretch. Three other roadside parks lie east of Harvey in Shelter Bay, on the shores of Deer Lake and west of Newberry.

== History ==

=== Mainline history ===
Formed by July 1, 1919, M-28 began in Wakefield at a junction with then M-12 and ran roughly along the current alignment to end at M-15, east of Covington. These two termini roughly correspond to the modern US 2 and western US 41 junctions respectively. M-28 was extended in 1927 along US 41 into Marquette County and east over M-25 through Chatham, Munising, and Newberry, before ending in downtown Sault Ste. Marie. At Negaunee, M-28 took the former routing of M-15 between Negaunee and Marquette for while US 41 ran along a portion of M-35. This southern loop routing of M-28 lasted until approximately 1936, when M-28 was moved to US 41, and the former route became CR 492. A new routing of M-28 in the Newberry area opened later that year, and a new M-28A (later Bus. M-28) existed until 1953. Another realignment in 1937 marked the transfer of M-28 out of downtown Ishpeming and Negaunee. This former routing later became Bus. M-28.
In the late 1930s, a highway numbered M-178 was designated between M-28 south of Munising to M-94 in town. In 1941, the routings of M-28 and M-94 were reversed between Harvey and Munising, and M-28 supplanted the M-178 designation completely. Since then, M-28 has run along the lakeshore through Au Train. M-28 was extended along US 2 to the state line at Ironwood, and the eastern end of M-28 through Brimley was moved to a new alignment ending at US 2, in Dafter in 1942. The eastern end was moved along US 2 back to Sault Ste. Marie in 1948, though the terminus was returned to Dafter in 1950.
From 1952 to 1962, M-28 crossed US 2 at Wakefield going south and stopped at the Wisconsin border, connecting with a county road. This segment of the highway (now Gogebic CR 519) was transferred back to the county in 1962. M-94 previously looped along Munising-Van Meer-Shingleton Road (now H-58 and H-15) north of M-28 between Munising and Shingleton. This routing was abandoned on November 7, 1963 in favor of the current concurrency. The last significant change to the M-28 routing occurred on March 3, 1989, when the eastern terminus was moved east to M-129.
MDOT unveiled plans on March 31, 2009, to rebuild the intersection between Front Street and the eastern end of the Marquette Bypass during 2010. The previous intersection configuration dated back to the 1960s and had been labeled as &quot;dangerous and [causing] significant traffic delays&quot; by the designers of the replacement. A traffic study concluded in 2007 that the intersection would need either the roundabout or a traffic signal with several turning lanes to accommodate the traffic needs in the area. MDOT decided in favor of a two-lane, roundabout retaining the right-turn lanes from the previous intersection layout. These lanes will be used by right-turning traffic to bypass the circle at the center of the intersection.

Construction started on the project in May. A section of the intersection was opened in July to traffic from the south that turns west. The lanes northbound into downtown were opened in the beginning of August, and the city held a ribbon cutting ceremony on August 19, 2010. The remaining lanes were opened the next day.

=== Historic bridges ===
MDOT has highlighted five historic bridges along the route of M-28 on the MDOT website. In Interior Township, Ontonagon County, the highway crosses the Ontonagon River over a bridge built in 1929. Designed by the State Highway Department and built by the firm of Meads and Anderson, the Ontonagon River Bridge is one of only three steel arch bridges in Michigan. The main span arch is long. A former routing of M-28 in Covington Township crosses the Rock River. Although this section was bypassed by a new alignment of the trunkline in 1924, the bridge remains complete &quot;with corbeled bulkheads and six panels recessed in the concrete spandrel walls.&quot; The corbels and spandrels are decorative features found in the concrete sides of the bridge.

Today, drivers cannot use the Peshekee River Bridge south of US 41/M-28 in western Marquette County&#x27;s Michigamme Township. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999 as &quot;Trunk Line Bridge No. 1&quot; for its engineering and architectural significance. MDOT has listed it as &quot;one of Michigan&#x27;s most important vehicular bridges.&quot; It was the first bridge designed by the Michigan State Highway Department, the forerunner to MDOT, in 1914. It was bypassed by a newer bridge built over the Peshekee River on US 41/M-28 subsequently abandoned as a roadway. The replacement bridge was bypassed and demolished in 1995.

The next historic bridge listed by MDOT along M-28 is over the Sand River in Onota Township in Alger County. While not visible to motorists, the bridge, constructed in 1939, is the longest rural rigid-frame span in Michigan. Most bridges of this type were built in urban locations, and soil conditions in the state limit locations for this style of bridge. The bridge over the East Branch of the Tahquamenon River in Chippewa County was built in 1926 as a &quot;formative exercise in what would evolve into a state standard design.&quot; The bridge was built with nine lines of I-beams encased in concrete. Only one other bridge in Michigan was built with such concrete encasement.

== Future ==

In the August 24, 2005 edition, the Marquette &quot;Mining Journal&quot; reported that the Marquette County Board and the County Road Commission were negotiating with MDOT to transfer the jurisdiction of Marquette County Road 480 to the state. Several routing options have been discussed, though all would make CR 480 a part of M-28. Cost was the primary reason given behind rerouting M-28 along CR 480. &quot;The road commission receives about $50,000 a year in state gas tax money but spends about $100,000 to maintain CR 480 because of the type and volume of traffic it receives.&quot; Handing CR 480 over to the state would shift the maintenance costs to the state, as well.

MDOT has indicated that it has not requested jurisdiction, but rather if it assumed control of the route, the community would need to support a through-route. Several proposals have arisen, including creating a &quot;spur&quot; from US 41/M-28 through the east end of Ishpeming to meet CR 480 west of Negaunee. This spur would pass through recently reopened former mining &quot;caving grounds&quot;, and to the south of the Mather A &amp; B Mine complex. According to Gerry Corkin, Marquette County Board Chairman, &quot;the land that was purchased by Ishpeming and Negaunee, the mining company land, this has the potential to help in the development of that if this is compatible. I think both cities will be interested in taking a look at what the land uses are and where this [spur] would push through.&quot;

The spur proposal would open land to development between the downtown areas of the two cities. If jurisdiction is transferred, and M-28 is routed over CR 480 as proposed, M-28 would leave the concurrency with US 41 near Teal Lake in Negaunee, and cross the caving grounds west of downtown to connect to Rail Street. Rail Street would serve as the connector to CR 480, which ends at the intersection of Rail and Ann streets and Healey Avenue. Proposals indicate two routing options for the east end of CR 480. One would route M-28 back along US 41 from Beaver Grove north of the CR 480 eastern terminus to the existing M-28 in Harvey. A second would route it along CR 551/Cherry Creek Road from CR 480 to M-28 in Harvey.

== Business loops ==

There have been three business loops for M-28: Ishpeming–Negaunee, Marquette and Newberry. Only the business loop serving Ishpeming and Negaunee is still a state-maintained trunkline. US 41/M-28 was relocated to bypass the two cities&#x27; downtowns in 1937. The highway through downtown Ishpeming and Negaunee later carried the ALT US 41/ALT M-28 designation before being designated Bus. M-28 in 1958. The western end of the business loop was transferred to local government control when Bus. M-28 was moved along Lakeshore Drive in 1999.
Bus. US 41 in Marquette was first shown on a map in 1964 after the construction of the Marquette Bypass. It was later designated Bus. US 41/Bus. M-28 on a map in 1975; this second designation was removed from maps by 1982. The entire business loop was turned back to local control in a &quot;route swap&quot; between the City of Marquette and MDOT announced in early 2005. The proposal transferred jurisdiction on the unsigned M-554 and the business route from the state to the city. The state would take jurisdiction over a segment of McClellan Avenue to be used to extend M-553 to US 41/M-28. In addition, MDOT would pay $2.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) for reconstruction work planned for 2007. The transfer would increase Marquette&#x27;s operational and maintenance liability expenses by $26,000 (equivalent to $ in ) and place the financial burden of the future replacement of a stop light on the city. On October 10, 2005, MDOT and Marquette transferred jurisdiction over the three roadways. As a result, Bus. US 41 was decommissioned when the local government took control over Washington and Front streets. As a result of the decommissioning, the 2006 maps did not show the now former business loop.

The Newberry Bus. M-28 was designated from 1936 until 1952 as M-28A. The MSHD maps of the time showed it signed as Bus. M-28 in 1952 before it was turned back to local control in 1953.

<text>Attila József (; 11 April 1905 – 3 December 1937) was one of the most famous Hungarian poets of the 20th century. Generally not recognized during his lifetime, József was hailed during the communist era of the 1950s as Hungary&#x27;s great &quot;proletarian poet&quot; and he has become the best known of the modern Hungarian poets internationally.

==Biography==
Attila József was born in Ferencváros, a poor district of Budapest, in 1905 to Áron József, a soap factory worker of Székely and Romanian origin from Banat, and Borbála Pőcze, a Hungarian peasant girl with Cuman ancestry; he had two elder sisters, Eta and Jolán. When Attila was three years old, he was sent to live with foster parents after his father abandoned the family and his mother became ill. At the time of his birth, Attila was not a well known name; because of this, his foster parents called him Pista, a nickname for the Hungarian version of Stephen.

From ages seven to fourteen, Attila returned to living with his mother until she died of cancer in 1919, aged only 43. While also attending school, he worked many odd jobs and was a self-described street urchin. After the death of his mother, the teenage Attila was looked after by his brother-in-law, Ödön Makai, who was relatively wealthy and could pay for his education in a good secondary school.

In 1924, Attila entered Franz Joseph University to study Hungarian and French literature, with the intention of becoming a secondary school teacher. He was expelled from the university, deemed unfit to be a teacher, after he wrote the provocative and revolutionary poem, &quot;Tiszta szívvel&quot; (&quot;With clear heart&quot; or &quot;With all my heart&quot;). With his manuscripts, he traveled to Vienna in 1925 where he made a living by selling newspapers and cleaning dormitories, and then to Paris for the following two years, where he studied at the Sorbonne. During this period he read Hegel and Karl Marx, whose call for revolution appealed to him as well as the work of François Villon, the famous poet and thief from the 15th-century. Financially, József was supported by the little money he earned by publishing his poems as well as by his patron, Lajos Hatvany. He returned to Hungary and studied at Pest University for a year. József then worked for the Foreign Trade Institute as a French correspondent and, later, was the editor of the literary journal &quot;Szép Szó&quot; (&quot;Beautiful Word&quot;.)

A supporter of the working class, Attila joined the illegal Communist Party of Hungary (KMP) in 1930. His 1931 work &quot;Döntsd a tőkét&quot; (&quot;Blow down the block/capital&quot;) was confiscated by the public prosecutor. József&#x27;s later essay &quot;Literature and Socialism&quot; (&quot;Irodalom és szocializmus&quot;) led to indictment. In 1936, he was expelled from the Hungarian Communist Party due to his independence and interest in Freud.

Beginning in childhood, Attila began showing signs of mental illness and was treated by psychiatrists for depression and schizophrenia. In adulthood, he was sent by the state to a sanatorium and was diagnosed with &quot;neurasthenia gravis.&quot; Modern scholars believe that he likely had borderline personality disorder. He never married and only had a small number of affairs, but frequently fell in love with the women who were treating him.

Attila József died on 3 December 1937, aged 32, in Balatonszárszó. At the time, he was staying at the house of his sister and brother-in-law. He was killed while crawling through railway tracks where he was crushed by a starting train. There is a memorial to him not far from the location where he died. The most widely accepted view is that he committed suicide, which he had previously attempted; he wrote five farewell letters that day.

==Poetry==
József published his first volume of poetry &quot;A szépség koldusa&quot; (&quot;Beauty&#x27;s beggar&quot;) in 1922; at the time of publishing, he was seventeen and still in school.

In 1925, József published his second collection of poems, &quot;Nem én kiáltok&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s not me who shouts&quot;). József&#x27;s works were praised by such internationally known Hungarian researchers and critics as Béla Balázs and György Lukács. In 1927, several French magazines published József&#x27;s poems.

József&#x27;s third collection of poems, &quot;Nincsen apám se anyám&quot; (1929) (&quot;I have neither father nor mother&quot;), showed the influence of French surrealism and Hungarian poets Endre Ady, Gyula Juhász and Lajos Kassák.

In the 1930s, József turned his focus from a search for beauty to the plight of the working class and reflected his interest in Communism. In 1932, &quot;Külvárosi éj&quot; (&quot;Night in the outskirts&quot;), a mature collection of poems, was published. His most famous love poem, &quot;Óda&quot; (&quot;Ode&quot;), from 1933, took the reader for a journey around and inside the body of the beloved woman.

József&#x27;s last two books were &quot;Medvetánc&quot; (&quot;Bear dance&quot;) and &quot;Nagyon fáj&quot; (&quot;It hurts very much&quot;), published in 1934 and 1936 respectively. With these works he gained wide critical attention. Ideologically, he had started to advocate humane socialism and alliance with all democratic forces. It was Attila József who first formulated the &quot;ars poetica&quot; of transrealism in his 1937 poem &quot;Welcome to Thomas Mann&quot;. József&#x27;s political essays were later included in Volume 3. of his &quot;Collected Works&quot; (1958).

<doc id="746594" wikidata="Q5543300" url="?curid=746594" title="George Peckham">
<text>George &quot;Porky&quot; Peckham (born 1942) is an English record engineer, widely recognised as among the most accomplished in the business. He has been responsible for producing the master discs from which many vinyl records have been pressed over the last 40 years.

His master discs, and the records that were produced from them, often bear either the motto &quot;A Porky Prime Cut&quot; or a cryptic or a humorous comment, etched onto the run-out grooves in his handwriting. Other inscriptions attributed to him include &quot;Pecko&quot; and &quot;Pecko Duck&quot;.

One of his most technically demanding achievements was the so-called &quot;three-sided&quot; album, &quot;The Monty Python Matching Tie and Handkerchief&quot; (1973), mastered with two concentric grooves on side two, so that different material would be played depending on where the stylus was put down on the record&#x27;s surface.

== Biography ==
Peckham was born in Blackburn, Lancashire and brought up in Liverpool. In school, he formed a band with friends called &#x27;The Renegades&#x27;, where he played guitar. The band later also enrolled his younger brother Derek on the bass guitar. Peckham started dabbling with audio electronics when he had to build a bass amplifier for Derek. According to Peckham, The Renegades played support to The Beatles, then an up-and-coming band. Paul McCartney, whose bass amplifier had failed, borrowed Derek&#x27;s and afterwards offered to buy it.

Peckham later played and toured with The Pawns, which he knew from the music circuit, and the group recorded sessions for Decca. After a stint playing in Germany, Peckham returned to Britain, and was asked to join Billy Kelly (stage name &#x27;Earl Royce&#x27;) and his group, the Olympics.

Peckham was poached from Royce to join The Fourmost, where he replaced Mike Millward, who had health issues. Keen on the recording side of the business, he left the Fourmost to join Apple Studios when the Beatles acquired the property at 3 Savile Row where they would open their own studio.

George Peckham started his career in disc cutting as a trainee disc cutter at Apple Studios in November 1968 before assuming the chief disc cutting role there a year later. Whilst working at Apple, Peckham began adding short messages on the run-out grooves of records he mastered. The messages, along with the phrase &quot;A PORKY PRIME CUT&quot;, become his professional signature. After various stints at other studios he went on to establish Porky&#x27;s Mastering Services where he was responsible for cutting some of the most influential English records during the &#x27;80s. He is now retired.

<doc id="746606" wikidata="Q940102" url="?curid=746606" title="Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)">
<text>Amazing Stories is an American anthology television series created by Steven Spielberg, that originally ran on NBC in the United States from September 29, 1985, to April 10, 1987.

The series was nominated for 12 Emmy Awards and won five. The first-season episode &quot;The Amazing Falsworth&quot; earned writer Mick Garris an Edgar Award for Best Episode in a TV Series. It was not a ratings hit (ranking 40th in Season 1 and 52nd in Season 2), however, and the network did not renew it after the two-year contract expired. The 1987 science fiction film &quot;Batteries Not Included&quot; was originally intended as a story for &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, but Spielberg liked the idea so much that he decided to make it a theatrical release.

The series title licensed the name of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, the first dedicated science fiction magazine created by Hugo Gernsback in April 1926.

The title sequence was made by computer-generated imagery (CGI) firm Robert Abel and Associates.

On March 6, 2020, a revival of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; premiered on Apple TV+.

==Episodes==
All episodes have a running time of around 24 minutes, with the exceptions of &quot;The Mission&quot; and &quot;Go to the Head of the Class&quot; (both running 46 minutes).
===Season 1 (1985–86)===
===Season 2 (1986–87)===
==Soundtrack==
In 1999, Varèse Sarabande released a CD containing a rerecording of the scores for the episodes &quot;The Mission&quot; and &quot;Dorothy and Ben&quot; (John Williams and Georges Delerue respectively) plus Williams&#x27; opening and closing themes, performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and conducted by Joel McNeely.

In 2006–2007, Intrada released three volumes of original music from the series, covering the impressive lineup of composers who worked on it and featuring all of the most noteworthy scores (with the exception of Danny Elfman and Steve Bartek&#x27;s &quot;The Family Dog,&quot; because the masters could not be found – a brief suite is on &quot;Music for a Darkened Theatre: Vol. 2&quot;, however), as well as two alternate versions of Williams&#x27; main title theme, one used just once (Alternate #1, on &quot;Alamo Jobe&quot;) and the other never used. The album is also notable for the premiere release of the music Williams composed for the Amblin Entertainment logo (although the logo music is not heard on the show itself).

Other than Williams, Bruce Broughton and Billy Goldenberg are the only composers to be represented on all three volumes. The running times below indicate the cumulative time for each score rather than the time of each track.

==Reception==

The series gained a number of positive reviews. However, some reviewers were unimpressed with the show, with Jeff Jarvis of &quot;People&quot; saying &quot;Amazing Stories is one of the worst disappointments I&#x27;ve ever had watching TV.&quot;

===Primetime Emmy Awards===
==Spin-offs==
One episode of the show, &quot;Family Dog&quot;, was spun off into its own series. Six years after &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; finished its run, &quot;Family Dog&quot; ran on CBS for ten episodes before being pulled off the schedule.

The video game &quot;The Dig&quot; originated as an idea Spielberg had for &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, but decided it would be too expensive to film.

In 1986, Steven Bauer wrote two novelizations of the series which were both published by Charter Books in the US and Futura Books in the UK. The first book, &quot;Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Amazing Stories&quot; (October 1986, ), adapted episodes 5, 12, 9, 2, 7 and 12, while the second book, &quot;Volume II of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Amazing Stories&quot; (December 1986, ), adapted episodes 7, 20, 8, 11, 18, 25, 4, 3, 21, 17 and 19.

In 1985–86, TSR published six tie-in novels under the &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; banner. They were branching (&quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; style) books where the reader chose where to jump at key points.

# &quot;The 4-D Funhouse&quot; by Clayton Emery and Earl Wajenberg. Cover by Jeff Easley. 
# &quot;Jaguar!&quot; by Morris Simon. Cover by Jeff Easley. 
# &quot;Portrait in Blood&quot; by Mary L. Kirchoff (credited as Mary Kirchoff). Cover by Jeff Easley. 
# &quot;Nightmare Universe&quot; by Gene DeWeese and Robert Coulson. Cover by Jeff Easley. 
# &quot;Starskimmer&quot; by John Betancourt. Cover by Doug Chaffee.
# &quot;Day of the Mayfly&quot; by Lee Enderlin. Cover by Doug Chaffee.

The 1987 film &quot;Batteries Not Included&quot; was originally planned to be a segment for the series, but Spielberg thought the story would work better on the big screen instead of television.

==Reboot==

On October 23, 2015, it was announced that NBC was developing a reboot of the series with Bryan Fuller writing the pilot episode and executive producing alongside Justin Falvey and Darryl Frank. Production companies involved with the series were set to include Universal Television. Steven Spielberg was not expected to be involved with the new series. On May 5, 2017, NBC and Universal Television were formally notified that their option rights to the &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; properties had been withdrawn. Rights for the development of a genre television series under the name &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; were subsequently sold to Experimenter Media LLC.

On October 10, 2017, it was announced that Apple Inc. made a deal with Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Television and NBC Universal to develop a new, ten-episode series on Apple&#x27;s streaming service, Apple TV+. On February 7, 2018, it was announced that Fuller had stepped down as showrunner of the series over creative differences. It was further reported that it was unclear whether he would have a different role on the project going forward. He had not delivered a script to Apple before his amicable departure. Later that day, it was also announced that executive producer Hart Hanson was exiting the series as well. On May 22, 2018, it was announced that &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz had joined the production as executive producers and showrunners.

==Home media==
===VHS===

===DVD===
Between 2006 and 2009, &quot;The Complete First Season&quot; was released on DVD in the US, UK, France, Holland, Italy, Scandinavia, Spain and Australia. In 2009, both seasons were released in Germany and Japan only. In Germany both seasons were released as 12 separate DVDs or a complete box set, which was also reissued in 2011. All countries&#x27; DVDs contain the original English soundtrack, while Italy, Germany, France, Spain and Japan have a second soundtrack, dubbed in their respective languages. The second season was never released in any video format in America despite much demand by collectors.

===Apple iTunes===
On January 8, 2018, Seasons 1 and 2 were released on Apple iTunes in standard definition.

==Foreign broadcasts==
In 1992, the series was somewhat erratically screened in Britain by BBC1 and BBC2 – billed in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; as &quot;Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Amazing Stories&quot; – with episodes airing at any time from early on Sunday morning (such as &quot;The Family Dog&quot;) to weekday evenings (like &quot;Such Interesting Neighbors&quot;) to very late at night (for instance &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;); it later received a more coherent run on Sci-Fi. Three of the episodes (&quot;The Mission&quot;, &quot;Mummy Daddy&quot; and &quot;Go to the Head of the Class&quot;) were packaged together as an anthology film and released theatrically in several European countries such as Spain, France (July 10, 1986) or Finland (June 26, 1987), and also in Australia on September 17, 1987. It later appeared on LaserDisc in Japan as &quot;Amazing Stories: The Movie&quot; shortly afterwards.

Until 2006, the Sci Fi Channel in the United States showed episodes on an irregular schedule. The MoviePlex channel also showed the series as a collection of &quot;movies,&quot; which are blocks of three episodes.

<text>The Meteosat series of satellites are geostationary meteorological satellites operated by EUMETSAT under the Meteosat Transition Programme (MTP) and the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) program.

The MTP program was established to ensure the operational continuity between the end of the successful Meteosat Operational Programme in 1995 and Meteosat Second Generation (MSG), which came into operation at the start of 2004 using improved satellites. The MSG program will provide service until the MTG (Meteosat Third Generation) program takes over.
==First generation==

The first generation of Meteosat satellites, Meteosat-1 to Meteosat-7, provided continuous and reliable meteorological observations from space to a large user community. Meteosat-1 to -7 have all now retired. 

When operational, the Meteosat First Generation provided images every half-hour in three spectral channels (Visible, Infrared) and Water Vapour, via the Meteosat Visible and Infrared Imager (MVIRI) instrument. Until 1 February 2017, Meteosat-7 provided the primary imagery coverage over the Indian Ocean and provided a service relaying data from Argos Data Collection Platforms (DCP), such as buoys, in support of the Tsunami Warning System for the Indian Ocean. A range of processed meteorological products were also produced. The last disseminated Meteosat-7 image was on 31 March 2017. Moving Meteosat-7 to its ultimate resting place in a graveyard orbit commenced on 3 April 2017 and the spacecraft final command sent on 11 April 2017.

The satellites were manufactured by a consortium COSMOS, with Aérospatiale in its Cannes Mandelieu Space Centre, as Prime, and included Matra, MBB, Selenia Spazio, Marconi Company.

They are 2.1 metres in diameter and 3.195 metres long. Its initial mass in orbit is 282 kg, and in orbit, the satellite spins at 100 rpm around its main axis.

==Second Generation (&quot;MSG&quot;)==
The contract for the second generation was awarded to Aérospatiale in its Cannes Mandelieu Space Centre (now Thales Alenia Space), with main subcontractors as Matra, Messerschmitt, Alenia.

Meteosat Second Generation was designed in response to user requirements to serve the needs of nowcasting applications and numerical weather prediction. In addition, the GERB instrument provides important data for climate monitoring and research.

The satellites are spin-stabilised like the previous generation, but with many design improvements. The more frequent and comprehensive data collected by MSG also aids the weather forecaster in the swift recognition and prediction of dangerous weather phenomena such as thunderstorms, fog, and explosive development of small, but intense, depressions, which can lead to devastating wind storms.

The MSG satellites are 3.2 m in diameter and 2.4 m high and spin anti-clockwise at 100 rpm at an altitude of 36,000 km.

On 29 January 2004 the first Meteosat Second Generation satellite MSG-1, renamed to Meteosat-8 once operational, commenced routine operations. In addition to the main optical payload SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager), Meteosat-8 also carries the secondary payload GERB (Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget) instrument.

The launch of MSG-2 (renamed to Meteosat-9) took place on 21 December 2005. The launch of MSG-3 (renamed to Meteosat-10) took place on 5 July 2012.

Meteosat-8 is stationed over the Indian Ocean, arriving at 41.5°E on 21 September 2016 and it took over as prime Indian Ocean Data Coverage (IODC) spacecraft on 1 February 2017 (replacing Meteosat-7). Meteosat-8 was retired from operational service on 1 July 2022 and finally decommissioned on 13 October 2022 after twenty years in orbit. The spacecraft was disposed of in compliance with ISO-24113 guidelines (although not designed with this in mind) having been raised 740km above the geostationary ring and spun down to 20rpm. The propulsion system was then passivated and the satellite deactivated.

Meteosat-9 is also stationed over the Indian Ocean, arriving at 45.5°E on 20 April 2022 and it took over as prime IODC spacecraft on 1 June 2022 (replacing Meteosat-8).

Meteosat-10 and -11 are located over Africa with various differences in operational configuration. Since 20 March 2018, Meteosat-10 provides an operational European &#x27;rapid scan&#x27; mode service (the MSG RSS service first commenced in May 2008), with images of Europe every 5 minutes. Since 20 February 2018, Meteosat-11 provides the main full Earth imagery service over Europe and Africa (with images every 15-minutes).

MSG-4 was successfully launched into space on 15 July 2015 at 18:42 local time on top an Ariane 5 Rocket from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. Like MSG-1, MSG-2 and MSG-3, MSG-4 was launched by Arianespace. The MSG-4 commissioning was successfully completed in December 2015 at which time the spacecraft was placed into in-orbit storage as planned, and renamed to Meteosat-11.

===Secondary Payloads===
Meteosat-8, -9, -10, and -11 each carry a GERB Instrument, DCP capable service equipment and a Search and Rescue signal Processor (SARP) that is capable of detecting 406 MHz distress signals from emergency position-indicating radiobeacon stations. For SARP, see more under Cospas-Sarsat.

==Third Generation (&quot;MTG&quot;)==
Considering the long development cycle for a new observational space system, EUMETSAT has been working on the definition and the planning for a Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) system since the year 2000. MTG components providing continuity of MSG services need to be available before the end of the nominal lifetime of MSG. MTG preparatory activities started end of 2000 in cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA), following the decision of the EUMETSAT Council to proceed with a Post-MSG User Consultation Process. The process is aimed at capturing the foreseeable needs of users of EUMETSAT&#x27;s satellite data in the 2015-2025 timeframe.

On 19 March 2010, ESA chose Thales Alenia Space for a final negotiation leading to a contract to be signed during June.

On 22 June 2010, EUMETSAT confirmed the choice of Thales Alenia Space.

On 24 February 2012, the development contract between ESA and Thales Alenia Space was signed by Mr. Liebig and Mr. Seznec. Thales Alenia Space leads the industrial consortium that is now building the MTG family. Along with being the prime contractor, Thales Alenia Space is responsible for the MTG-I imaging satellite, including the primary payload, the Flexible Combined Imager. Bremen-based OHB is responsible for the MTG-S satellites and provision of the common satellite platforms, supported by Astrium GmbH as the System Architect.

A total of 6 satellites are being developed under the MTG contract. Four MTG-I imaging satellites, as well as two MTG-S sounder satellites. The launch of the first MTG satellite, Meteosat-12 (MTG-I1), occurred on 13 December 2022, at 20:30 UTC and has been operational since December 2024.

Comala () is a town and municipality located in the Mexican state of Colima, near the state capital of Colima, being the northernmost and second smallest municipality in Colima behind Villa de Álvarez. It has been nicknamed the &quot;White Village of America&quot; as the façades of the buildings in town have all been painted white since the 1960s. The historic center of the town was declared a Historic Monument Zone and the town became a Pueblo Mágico in 2002. It is the municipal seat of the Comala Municipality, the local governing authority for over 400 other communities, including the former Nogueras Hacienda, the home of artist Alejandro Rangel Hidalgo.

==Comala municipality==
The town of Comala is the municipal seat of Comala Municipality, the local governing authority for over four hundred other communities, which together cover a territory of 254km2. The area was originally called Ajuchitlán or Valley of the Flowers with indigenous settlements located near water flowing down from the Colima Volcano . Aside from the municipal seat, the main communities of the municipality are Suchitlán, Zacualpan and the Cofradía de Suchitlán. The municipal government consists of a municipal president, a general secretary, one officer called a “síndico” and nine officers called “regidores.” The municipality borders the municipalities of Cuauhtémoc, Minatitlán and Villa de Álvarez with the state of Jalisco to the north.

As of 2005, there are only 68 people who speak an indigenous language in the municipality. Most speak Nahuatl or Maya with Nahuatl speakers found in the communities of Suchitlán and Zacualpan. From 1980 to 2005, the population of the municipality grew from 15,823 to 19,485 with an average growth rate of over 3.5%. Over 97% of the population is Catholic. There is also a small community of Evangelist Christians.

As of 2005, the municipality had 4,776 residential units with almost all owned by their residents. Basic infrastructure such as running water, street lighting, and sewerage and garbage collection is available to over 90% of the population. However, only 75% have police services and 80% have paved roads. The municipality has seventeen preschools, thirty primary schools, seven middle schools, three high schools and one vocational school. Less than ten percent of the population over the age of 15 is illiterate.

The main road through the municipality is a four lane boulevard that extends from Villa de Alvarez for a length of 6.5 km. Another important road connects the municipal seat with the San Antonio hacienda along with the communities of Suchitlán, Cofradía de Suchitlán, La Nogalera before heading north into Jalisco. The state Carrizalillos-Quesería highway also passes through connected to Zacualpan. There are about twenty km of dirt roads mostly found in the communities of La Caja, El Remudadero, Los Colomos, El Remate and Cofradía de Suchitlán.

The Nogueras Cultural Center belongs to the University of Colima. It features an area dedicated to pre Hispanic ceramics.

Other buildings which have been named historic monuments include the Nogueras Church from the 18th century, the former Nogueras hacienda from the 19th century, the former hacienda of San Antonio and its aqueduct from the 19th century, the parish church from the beginning of the 20th century, the Los Aguajes Bridge from the 20th century, the municipal palace from the 20th century, the Máquinas House from the 20th century, El Fortín from the 20th century and the former Los Colonos hacienda from the 19th century.

The Zacualpan Cultural Center was constructed in 1996 by the state government through the Instituto Colimense de Cultura. It is dedicated to the community history and indigenous identity and includes agrarian implements and documents, arms from the Mexican Revolution, pieces of the old railroad and testimonies from the Cristero War. There are also documents related to the Indio Alonso, who was assassinated here, and photographs related to the medicinal plants in the area.

The Suchitlán Community Museum was established the local community and the municipal government, located in the arches alongside the main garden area of the community. It consists of a single hall with murals of the town, wooden masks, traditional tools, musical instruments and dolls representing traditional dances. The museum also contains documents related to the establishment of the Suchitlán ejido.

Local religious festivals include the feast of the Virgin of Candelaria in Suchitlán on 2 February, Saint James on 25 January and Isidor the Laborer on 15 May in Zacualpan. Suchitlán is known for its traditional dances, such as “morenos,” “gallitas,” “negros,” “sonjaeros” and “del rebozo.” Zacualpan&#x27;s noted dance is the Danza de Conquista. Suchitlán has an annual carnival, celebrated with foods and drink such as nejayote, pinole and sour oranges. The opening ceremony features people with crowns and scepters made of bread, flowers and necklaces who give solemn and emotional speeches. One special guest treated this was Rigoberta Menchú. During festivals in Comala, it is traditional for women to dress up in costumes meant to imitate indigenous dress, and form a procession to announce rodeos called jaripeos as well as an event called Día de los Hijos Ausentes. During the festival of La Caja, dancing horses create a show accompanied by music. In various locations in the municipality, Independence Day is celebrated with horse and foot races by people of all ages. During the Feast of Saint John in Zacualpan, the winners receive prizes such as pigs, hens and turkeys.

Mostly modern pop and norteño music is popular in the municipality. However, it does have nine well-known bands that play traditional music on wind instruments. One event in which this music is commonly played is at bullfights.

==The town==
Historically, Comala has been a small agricultural village/town. At the beginning of the 20th century, the town had only three streets around the main square. It is also associated with Juan Rulfo’s novel &quot;Pedro Páramo&quot;, although it is not known if Rulfo was referring to the town directly in the novel. The town is still surrounded by papaya, banana, mamey, almond and palm orchards, with orange and palm trees found within for decoration. It is possible to see the Volcano of Colima from the town. Many of the older buildings, especially in the town center have walls made of adobe, and many of the houses have small yards with flowers guarded by iron fences. The historic center of the town was declared a Historic Monument Zone by presidential decree in 1988 and is distinguished by streets paved with river stone. In 1961, the town decided to paint itself white as a way to distinguish itself from the surrounding communities. Today, it is filled with structures with white walls and red tile roofs.

The town is centered on a main square or plaza, dedicated to Benito Juárez, and renovated several times during its history. In the center of the plaza, there is a white kiosk with a stone base topped with a metal roof structure, manufactured in the early 20th century. Surrounding the kiosk are garden areas with palm trees and rose bushes, four fountains in each of the corners and Gothic style iron benches created by Alejandro Rangel Hidalgo. Just off the square on two opposing sides, there are arcades which contain businesses. These businesses sell local products and restaurants serves local cuisine. This includes a dish called tatemado, which is pork in a thick sauce made with guajillo chili peppers, as well as pozole and white menudo .

One important beverage sold here is ponche. It has been made for generations in Comala with at least twenty families currently involved in its production although there are thought to be more who produce it clandestinely. The drink has been given a certification of the name so that products called “ponche de Comala” must be from the area, similar to tequila. Ramon Salazar Salazar was one of the pioneers in the making of ponche, and his son Ramiro Salazar Trujillo is still involved into the craft. Ponche has been made in at least fourteen different flavors with the most traditional being pomegranate, coconut and nuts such as pistachio and almond. Other common flavors include coffee, peanut, tamarind, blackberry, plum, and rompope. The drink has a relatively low alcohol content and is drunk as an aperitif cold or at room temperature. Another beverage is called bate, which is a type of atole served with an ice made with sugar cane.

Also facing the main square on opposite sides are the municipal palace and the parish church. The municipal palace dates from the beginning of the 20th century, on which are a clock and the coat of arms of the municipality. In 2000, the clock in the tower of the municipal palace was replaced but not after some controversy. The building is a historic site, as part of the historic center of the town and there was conflict between municipal authorities and INAH as to whether the work should proceed. In the end, the clock was replaced with the old one preserved by the municipality. The parish church is named San Miguel del Espiritu Santo. The current building was constructed in the early 20th century. The arch that leads into the atrium is older, dating from 1832. One distinguishing feature of the church is that one of its towers is unfinished which can plainly be seen. Between the two towers, there is a white statue of the Archangel Michael.

Comala was named a Pueblo Mágico in 2002 and in 2006 on it has invested about ten million pesos in projects to promote the town image for tourism. The town hosted the 2011 convention of Mexico&#x27;s forty Pueblos Mágicos to exchange ideas of how to increase tourism.

===Tourist activities===
Its main tourist attractions are the &quot;Alejandro Rangel Hidalgo&quot; and the &quot;Eco park&quot;, of the University of Colima, as well as the same &quot;Ex hacienda de Nogueras&quot;, famous for its &quot;chacuaco&quot; of the extinct sugar mill.

The Nogueras eco-park is dedicated to the preservation of flora and fauna research in the region, where you can see medicinal plants, fruit trees and compost, an area where the use of alternative energy is shown, recycling workshops and environmental training . .

In the Alejandro Rangel University Museum, the University of Colima shows the prehispanic ceramic collection selected by the artist Alejandro Rangel Hidalgo. You can also see an excellent sample of personal work as a set designer painter, designer and graphic illustrator.

The Nogueras Cultural Center is located in the building of the Ex Hacienda de Nogueras. Nowadays the restaurant industry is developing.

==Nogueras Hacienda==

In addition to the historic center of the town of Comala, the most important attraction is the former hacienda of Nogueras, a restored hacienda located just outside the town and belonged to artist Alejandro Rangel Hidalgo .

Nogueras was granted by Hernán Cortés to a now-forgotten general, and over the next centuries the land changed hands several times. The Nogueras estate was founded by the Spanish Juan de Noguera at the beginning of the 18th century; at the time it was one of the most renowned sugar companies in the region.

Currently, the main construction of the Hacienda is part of the University of Colima and its facilities have been remodeled to be a Study Center, an Eco park and the Alejandro Rangel Hidalgo University Museum, where Alejandro Rangel Hidalgo and his painter lived. brothers, the architect Juan Rangel and the engineer Javier Rangel. The Nogueras hacienda chapel was founded by the Franciscans and services are still held here.

By 1873, the hacienda was bankrupt and eventually sold to the Rangel family, who ran the sugar cane mill until the Mexican Revolution. They lost all but a few hectares of the original hacienda, changing from sugar cane to limes, which could be intensively cultivated. After the Revolution Alejandro Rangel inherited the property and helped to keep it running through his talents as an artist. He renovated the hacienda and established a museum to house his collection of antiques, art and furniture. This museum, which still exists, also contains numerous examples of his artwork and furniture designs. Another section of the museum is dedicated to local pre Hispanic ceramics, mostly funerary offerings from shaft tombs. Prominent among these are the &quot;Colima dogs&quot;, depictions of xoloizcuintles.

Upon his death, Rangel donated the hacienda to the University of Colima, allowing the art and the pre-Hispanic artifact to remain on the land on which they were created. The university runs the hacienda as a center for archaeological, historical and anthropological studies. The complex is called the Centro Cultural Nogueras with the main house dedicated as the Alejandro Rangel Hidalgo Museum. This museum features Rangel&#x27;s artwork as well as a large collection of pre Hispanic ceramics from the area. There are also rooms dedicated to the recreation of a traditional hacienda and another dedicated to Rangel&#x27;s furniture designs. This furniture has made its way to many Mexican embassies and the style is known as Rangelino. The gift shop sells prints of Rangel&#x27;s work including those made for Christmas cards for UNICEF in the 1960s. The museum also has exhibitions of furniture, ironwork, glass and more from local artisans.
Zacualpan

It is an indigenous community on the slopes of Cerro Grande, on the edge of the ravine that has carved the Armería River in the sand and rock deposits thrown by the Volcán de Fuego.

There is an ancient tradition in Zacualpan about herbal medicine, a practice that has been inherited by family members as a family, it is interesting to find among the inhabitants those families or women who know the most about it.

It is the only population in the State where communal property is still recognized. It is perhaps also the only case of survival of the ancient tradition of the &quot;cacicas&quot;, reason that several towns in the region bears the name of Cihuatlán, &quot;place of women&quot;, which made Hernán Cortés believe that he had discovered the mythical land of the Amazons. The last cacica of Zacualpan carried in life the name of Piedra Peña Vázquez (1876–1979).

The mountain offers views of the Colima Valley and the volcanoes. The summit is accessible by automobile. Some areas of the Colima Volcano allow for hiking and even skiing. At the edge of the municipality, where Colima borders Jalisco, there is a large canyon that forms the border.

The Amería River divides the municipality into two regions. The west is more rugged with the Cerro Grande and the Sierra de Manatlán. The southeast is more level as it is part of the Valley of Colima. The two volcanos form part of the municipality&#x27;s and state&#x27;s northern border.

==History==
The name means &quot;place of comals&quot;, a type of cooking vessel. Comala means place of comals derived from the word comalli with the suffix –an meaning place from Nahuatl. The municipal seal was created by Alvaro Gabrial Rivera Muñoz and chosen during a contest held in 1984. It contains emblematic images related to the municipality such as the volcano, a walnut tree, the former hacienda of San Antonio, the Carrizalillos Lake, a glyph for a comal and the ceramic dog figures that characterize Colima.

The first humans to Colima were estimated to arrive around 3,000 years ago. The area has evidence of Olmec, Nahua, Toltec and Chichimeca habitation or influence. However, after the 12th century, the dominant culture here was the Purépecha culture until the Spanish arrived. The town of Comala has pre Hispanic roots along with neighboring Suchitlán and Zacualtipan in the municipality.

After the Conquest, the Comala area became an encomienda under Bartolomé López in 1527. The area was evangelized by the Franciscans, establishing the chapel of Ajuchitlán. By 1554, the villages of Comala, Suchitlán and Zacualpan were officially established under Spanish rule. Sometime before 1815, it became a semi autonomous Indian Republic with its own governor. It became a municipality in 1820 with Cayetano Pizarro as the first mayor under Spanish law, and again in 1857 under that year&#x27;s constitution. It has conserved this political organization to the present day.

In 1883, a German businessman by the name of Arnold Vogel established the first coffee plantation in the municipality. This plantation would spur agricultural and industrial development in the area.

The first electrical plant in the state of Colima called El Remate was built in 1906, supplying electricity to Comala, Colima and Villa de Alvarez.

A train line connecting the city of Colima to the Cerro Grande to ship lumber began to function in 1910.

Suchitlán was the site of the area&#x27;s first ejido in 1918.

The Cristero War in the mid 1920s was particularly divisive in the state of Colima. The municipality has two strongholds of Cristeros, those who opposed the liberal reforms of the area against the Catholic Church. One was located in the Cerro Grande and the other near the edge of the Colima Volcano.

In 1961, the town decided to paint itself white as a way to distinguish itself from the surrounding communities. Today, it is filled with structures with white walls and red tile roofs.

The Vasco de Quiroga School of Social Work was established in the town, the first of its kind in the state. The Escuela de Artesanías con Diseños (School of Handcrafts with Design) was established in 1969, and the Centro Estatal de Menors was established in 1981.

The historic center of the town was declared a Historic Monument Zone by presidential decree in 1988.

In the 1990s, the Zacualpan–Colima aqueduct was built through the municipality to supply water to the capital.

==Economy==
The municipality has a low level of socioeconomic marginalization. Agriculture employs over 42 percent of the population. Principle crops include corn, tomatoes, sorghum, coffee, sugar cane and animal feed. Other crops include tomatillos, rice, green chili peppers, beans, cucumbers, jicama, limes, mangos, tamarind, avocados, mamey and guava. Livestock is principally of cattle, pigs and domestic fowl with some sheep, goats and horses. There is small scale fishing in the rivers and lakes of the municipality, mostly for carp and bass.

Industry and construction employs just over twenty percent. Industry is limited to handcrafts with the most important workshop being the “Artesanías Pueblo Blanco” which makes furniture. There are also some coffee and dairy processing along with the production of some construction materials. Handcrafts include baskets, carved wooden masks for traditional dances, palm frond hands, tarrallas, chiquihuites and comals.

Thousands of visitors come each year to the municipal seat and some of the natural attractions around it. Hiking is popular in the areas on and around the Cerro Grande and the slopes of the volcano. Tourism is supported by a number of restaurants serving local dishes and hotels.

Just over 35% commerce, services and tourism. Comala is the second most important tourist destination in the state after Manzanillo, with an average 400,000 visitors each year. In addition to the historic center of the town of Comala, the most important attraction is the former hacienda of Nogueras, a restored hacienda located just outside the town and belonged to artist Alejandro Rangel Hidalgo.

Tourist attractions include the former hacienda of San Antonio, the Jabalí, La María and Carrizalillos Lakes. These have hotel and restaurant services along with boating and fishing at the lakes. La Maria Lake is surrounded by oaks and pines and has cabins and restaurants. The El Remate reserve is part of a project to protect the cultural history and ecology of the area while promoting it for tourism. Here the first electrical power plant for the state was constructed. There is a retreat called the “Centro de Reflexión” in Suchitlán, construction along the ravine of the Suchitlán River. It can accommodate 100 people, with special dining options as well as motivational speeches. It is located near the city of Colima in an area chosen for its climate and natural landscapes.

<text>Helen O&#x27;Hara (born Helen Bevington; 5 November 1956) is a British musician. She was a member and violinist of Dexys Midnight Runners from 1982 to 1987, including performing on songs such as &quot;Come on Eileen&quot;, and in 2021 rejoined the band.

==Early years==
Helen Bevington began her music career in her home town of Bristol joining Gunner Kade, a band led by Ken Pustelnik, drummer from The Groundhogs. She then joined a band called Wisper, which combined their solo career with backing various artists. Wisper evolved into Uncle Po (1976–78), which won the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Quiz Kid&quot; band competition in 1977 and subsequently released a single on the BEEB label entitled &quot;Use My Friends&quot; (so rare that a copy sold in 2006 on eBay for over £80). Uncle Po consisted of Rob Williams on guitar, Gavin King on vocals, Lyndon Parry on bass and vocals, Andy Wills on sax. flute, and vocals, O&#x27;Hara (as Helen &quot;Spike&quot; Bevington) on violin and keyboards, and Steve &quot;Basher&quot; Bennett and Jimmer Hill on drums.

==Dexys Midnight Runners==
O&#x27;Hara left Uncle Po in late 1977 to study music at Birmingham School of Music (now UCE Birmingham Conservatoire), graduating in 1982 with an offer to join the Bilbao Symphony. However, after she recorded some demos with the Blue Ox Babes, a band founded by Dexys founder Kevin &#x27;Al&#x27; Archer, Archer recommended her to his former partner Kevin Rowland, who was also experimenting with adding strings.

She was offered a place with Rowland&#x27;s new line-up of Dexys—the result of a session she and two other violinists from the university had carried out as part of Rowland&#x27;s decision to revamp the band&#x27;s sound and image. Rowland has said that he saw O&#x27;Hara standing at a bus stop with her violin case and stopped to meet her. The more prosaic truth is that of the three violinists at the session she was the only one with any rock and roll experience, and therefore the only one to be able to play a solo by feel. This she did well enough to be immediately drafted into Dexys.
To fit in with Dexys&#x27; Celtic image, she took the stage last name of &quot;O&#x27;Hara&quot;.

Within months she was touring the UK, followed by the US, as &quot;Come On Eileen&quot; reached No. 1 in the charts in both countries. She also began a personal relationship with Rowland.

With the singles &quot;Jackie Wilson Said (I&#x27;m in Heaven When You Smile)&quot; (a Van Morrison cover) and &quot;Let&#x27;s Get This Straight (From the Start)&quot; maintaining their popularity, the group continued to tour through 1983 with a nucleus of Rowland, O&#x27;Hara and Billy Adams, augmented by other musicians.
Beginning in 1984, and with the assistance of both studio musicians and former members, Dexys wrote and recorded &quot;Don&#x27;t Stand Me Down&quot;, which was released in late 1985. Earlier in 1985, Rowland appointed O&#x27;Hara as Dexys&#x27; musical director. O&#x27;Hara later commented that the American musicians that they worked with &quot;couldn&#x27;t quite make out my position in the band, and the whole thing.&quot; Some of the lyrics and songs from that album, especially &quot;This Is What She&#x27;s Like&quot;, were written by Rowland about her, which she said made them &quot;pretty uncomfortable&quot; to record.

The lengthy, contentious sessions for that album strained both her relationship with Rowland and the core of that version of Dexys. Although Dexys returned to the charts with &quot;Because of You&quot; (co-written by Rowland, O&#x27;Hara, and Adams) in 1986, and O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s &quot;fan club&quot; letter in November 1986 discussed imminent recording sessions for a new Dexys album, she later said that at that point &quot;Dexys were finished really&quot; and the band broke up in 1987.

After Dexys was reformed by Rowland in 2003, O&#x27;Hara appeared as a guest artist on Dexys&#x27; fifth album &quot;Let the Record Show: Dexys Do Irish and Country Soul&quot; in 2016, and she temporarily rejoined the band for its two live performances and one television performance that year in place of Dexys&#x27; current violinist, Lucy Morgan, who was unavailable.

==Later career==

After leaving Dexys, O&#x27;Hara worked with rock performers such as Graham Parker, Tanita Tikaram (with whom she recorded &quot;Good Tradition&quot; and toured from 1988 to 1990) and Mary Coughlan.

In 1990, she released a solo album entitled &quot;Romanza&quot;, with a backing band including keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, which was later reissued as &quot;Southern Hearts&quot;, and in 1998, she released her second solo album, &quot;A Night in Ireland&quot;. After a 25-year gap, O&#x27;Hara and Tikaram resumed performing live together in 2015.

<text>Francis William Webb (21 May 1836 – 4 June 1906) was an English railway engineer, responsible for the design and manufacture of locomotives for the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). As the LNWR&#x27;s chief mechanical engineer, he also exercised great influence in political and public life in the Cheshire town of Crewe, once being described as the &#x27;King of Crewe&#x27;.

== Early life ==
Webb was born in Tixall Rectory, near Stafford, the second son of William Webb, Rector of Tixall.
==Career==
===Crewe Works===
Showing early interest in mechanical engineering, on 11 August 1851 at the age of fifteen he was articled as a pupil of Francis Trevithick at Crewe Works. Webb joined the drawing office in 1856, at the end of his training. He became Chief Draughtsman on 1 March 1859. On 1 September 1861 he was appointed Works Manager at Crewe and Chief Assistant to John Ramsbottom. Whilst Works Manager, Webb was responsible for the installation of Bessemer converters and the start of steel production at Crewe.

===Bolton Iron and Steel Company===
In July 1866 Webb resigned from the LNWR and moved to the Bolton Iron and Steel Co. as the manager. It has been suggested that this move was arranged by the LNWR management to enable him to gain experience of steel making.

===Return to Crewe===
Ramsbottom gave 12 months notice of his resignation in September 1870. Shortly afterwards the Works Manager, Thomas Stubbs, died aged 34. Stubbs may have been Ramsbottom&#x27;s intended successor. The Chairman of the LNWR, Richard Moon, contacted Webb and invited him to return to Crewe. In October 1870 Moon was able to inform Webb that his appointment as Locomotive Superintendent had been approved. Webb&#x27;s salary was set at £2,000 for the first year, and £3,000 for the second and subsequent years. Webb took up his position on 1 October 1871. Webb became Chief Mechanical Engineer when the post of Locomotive Superintendent was renamed. It appears that this happened soon after Webb took up his duties. At the same time he also became President of the Crewe Mechanics&#x27; Institute, where he had for some time taught engineering drawing during his first stay at Crewe. Webb remained as CME of the LNWR until 1 July 1903, having tendered his resignation in November 1902. His successor, George Whale, was appointed in April 1903. Whale took over Webb&#x27;s position somewhat earlier than planned, as Webb became seriously ill in June.

===Locomotive classes===

Webb was responsible throughout his career for some highly successful standard locomotive classes, all built at Crewe in considerable numbers. Notable amongst these is the &quot;Precedent&quot; class of 2-4-0 (known as &quot;Jumbos&quot;), an 0-6-0 general purpose freight design, (&quot;Coal Engine&quot;) and its 0-6-2 (&quot;Coal Tank&quot;) variant, a celebrated 0-6-0 mixed traffic design (&quot;Cauliflowers&quot;), and an 0-8-0 freight locomotive with two compound variants and a simple expansion version produced in parallel, The last-mentioned was continuously developed and built down to LMS days, most earlier locomotives being rebuilt to conform.

====Controversy====
There does however remain some controversy over Webb&#x27;s own two distinct compound systems applied to a number of locomotive designs, which are reputed to have given considerable trouble in service. The Webb &quot;Experiment&quot; or &quot;Improved Precedent&quot; class were withdrawn by his successor George Whale soon after he succeeded Webb in 1903.

An obituary in The Engineer (8 June 1906) criticised his express compound design, which used un-coupled high and low pressure cylinders, a design promoted by Webb alone. The article caused open debate in the pages of the journal, mostly based on the perceived flaw of not utilising coupling rods. In the 20 June edition the editor of the journal continued the attack on the deceased engineer, stating:

===Other work===
Webb was also responsible for the remodelling of Crewe station which involved the building of four tracks in underpasses on the west side of the station to carry freight trains.

He made numerous inventions and received over 80 patents. He was Vice-President of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

==Local political and public life==
Webb took a great interest in local politics and was an Alderman on the Crewe Town Council and was Mayor twice, in 1887 and 1888. He was also an Alderman on Cheshire County Council - useful for the LNWR as the council controlled matters relating to the railway, including the rates the company paid. Webb also served as a magistrate.

In the late 19th century, as the chief mechanical engineer at LNWR&#x27;s Crewe works, Webb was &quot;the most influential individual in the town&quot;. &quot;... it was during the &#x27;reign&#x27; of F. W. Webb, between 1872 and 1903, that the power of this office was its height. Described just before his retirement as &#x27;the King of Crewe&#x27;, Webb came to exercise control over the working lives of over 18,000 men - one third of the total LNWR workforce. Over half these lived in Crewe, around 8,000 being employed at the locomotive works. Several recreational and sporting organisations were a direct result of Webb&#x27;s influence and others received benefit from his support.&quot; These included the LNWR Cricket Club (established in 1850) and the Crewe Alexandra Athletic Club (established in 1867).

However, Webb&#x27;s influence in Crewe allegedly extended to intimidation of Liberal Party sympathisers during the 1880s. In September 1885, the editor of the &quot;Crewe Chronicle&quot; published charges against Webb, saying &quot;That through the action, direct and indirect, of Tory railway officialism, the political life of Crewe is cramped and hindered beyond recognition&quot;. In November 1889, Crewe Town Council debated a motion which accused the Works managers of working with Crewe Tories &quot;to crush Liberalism altogether out of the town&quot;: &quot;... by intimidation and persecution of your Liberal workmen, and by making the chances of promotion depend upon subserviency to the Tory political demands of the Management, they have created a state of political serfdom in the works.&quot; In December 1889, Liberal statesman William Ewart Gladstone wrote a letter to the &quot;Chronicle&quot; condemning the company&#x27;s behaviour.

===Philanthropy===
In Crewe he was for very many years remembered as a major benefactor of the &quot;Webb Orphanage&quot;, a beautiful red-brick building with extensive playing fields behind the railway works and fronting on to Victoria Avenue. &quot;Frank Webb Avenue&quot;, a much later Crewe residential street, also recalls his name.

In 1887, together with Richard Moon, chairman of the LNWR, he presented to the Crewe Corporation, on behalf of the railway company, Queen&#x27;s Park, a large and beautifully landscaped park with attractive entrance gates and lodges (complete with inscribed decoration mentioning both Moon and Webb) and also fronting on Victoria Avenue. He also helped Crewe Alexandra athletic and cricket clubs relocate from the Alexandra Recreation Ground on Nantwich Road to a new ground off Earle Street in 1898.

==Retirement and death==
He retired in 1903 to Bournemouth, where he died in 1906, aged 70. He had never married.

<text>Skansen (; &quot;the Sconce&quot;) is the oldest open-air museum and zoo in Sweden located on the island Djurgården in Stockholm, Sweden. It was opened on 11 October 1891 by Artur Hazelius (1833–1901) to show the way of life in the different parts of Sweden before the industrial era.

The term &quot;skansen&quot; has become a generic term referring to other open-air museums and collections of historic structures, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, but also in the United States, e.g. Old World Wisconsin and Fairplay, Colorado.

== History ==

The 19th century was a period of great change throughout Europe, and Sweden was no exception. Its rural way of life was rapidly giving way to an industrialised society and many feared that the country&#x27;s many traditional customs and occupations might be lost to history. Artur Hazelius, who had previously founded the Nordic Museum on the island of Djurgården near the centre of Stockholm, was inspired by the open-air museum, founded by King Oscar II in Kristiania in 1881, when he created his open-air museum on the hill that dominates the island. Skansen became the model for other early open-air museums in Scandinavia and later ones elsewhere.

Skansen was originally a part of the Nordic Museum, but became an independent organisation in 1963. The objects within the Skansen buildings are still the property of the Nordic Museum.

After extensive travelling, Hazelius bought around 150 houses from all over the country (as well as one structure from Telemark in Norway) and had them shipped piece by piece to the museum, where they were rebuilt to provide a unique picture of traditional Sweden. Only three of the buildings in the museum are not original, and were painstakingly copied from examples he had found. All of the buildings are open to visitors and show the full range of Swedish life from the Skogaholm Manor house built in 1680, to the 16th century Älvros farmhouses.

== The open-air museum ==
Skansen attracts more than 1.3 million visitors each year. The many exhibits over the 75 acre (300,000 m²) site include a full replica of an average 19th-century town, in which craftsmen in traditional dress such as tanners, shoemakers, silversmiths, bakers and glass-blowers demonstrate their skills in period surroundings. There is even a small patch growing tobacco used for the making of cigarettes. There is also an open-air zoo containing a wide range of Scandinavian animals including the brown bear, moose, grey seal, Eurasian lynx, wolf, fox, otter, reindeer, harbour seal, Eurasian eagle owl, great grey owl and wolverine, as well as some non-Scandinavian animals. There are also farmsteads where rare breeds of farm animals can be seen.

In early December the site&#x27;s central Bollnäs square is host to a popular Christmas market that has been held since 1903, attracting around 25,000 visitors each weekend. In the summer there are displays of folk dancing and concerts.

== Funicular railway ==
Since 1897, Skansen has been served by the Skansens Bergbana, a funicular railway on the northwest side of the Skansen hill. The funicular is 196.4 meters long, with a total rise of 34.57 meters.

Skansen is also served by trams on line 7.

<text>HMS &quot;Express&quot; was an E-class minelaying destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36 during the Abyssinia Crisis. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, she spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict.

&quot;Express&quot; spent most of the first year of World War II laying minefields in British, Dutch and German waters. She participated in the evacuation of Allied soldiers from Dunkirk in May–June 1940, but resumed minelaying afterwards. The ship was one of five British destroyers that inadvertently entered a German minefield off the Dutch coast a few months later, leading to the sinking of two destroyers and &quot;Express&quot; having her bow blown off, incapacitating her for over a year of repairs. Two months after returning to duty, &quot;Express&quot; escorted the battleship and the battlecruiser (Force Z) to Singapore in late 1941, in an unsuccessful attempt to deter Japanese aggression against British possessions in the Far East. She escorted the capital ships in an attempt to intercept landings in British Malaya in December and rescued their survivors after they were sunk by Japanese bombers. &quot;Express&quot; was then assigned convoy escort duties in and around Singapore and the Dutch East Indies under the control of American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM) as the Japanese advanced. She escaped from the East Indies and rejoined the main body of the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean. The ship played a minor role in Battle of Madagascar as she screened an aircraft carrier during the late stages of the campaign in 1942.

&quot;Express&quot; returned home in early 1943 to begin conversion into an escort destroyer. Upon its completion in June, the ship was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and renamed &quot;Gatineau&quot;. She was assigned to convoy escort duties with the Mid-Ocean Escort Force and participated in sinking a German submarine in March 1944. &quot;Gatineau&quot; was transferred to Northern Ireland in preparation in May for the Invasion of Normandy and was sent to Canada in July to begin a lengthy refit. The ship was only operational for a few months before the war ended in May 1945 and she returned to Canada shortly afterwards. &quot;Gatineau&quot; was paid off in early 1946 and was sold the following year. The ship became part of a breakwater on the coast of British Columbia in 1948.

==Description==
The E-class ships were slightly improved versions of the preceding D class. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The ships carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave them a range of at . Their complement was 145 officers and ratings.

The ships mounted four 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple mounts for the Vickers AA machinegun. The E class was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. To compensate for the weight of her 60 Mark XIV mines and their rails, two of &quot;Express&quot;″s 4.7-inch guns, their ammunition, both sets of torpedo tubes, her Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping paravanes, and her large boats and their davits had to be removed. She was given small sponsons at the stern to ensure smooth delivery of her mines.

===Wartime modifications===
&quot;Express&quot; had her rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12-pounder (76 mm) AA gun in July 1940. In February–June 1943, she was converted into an escort destroyer. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar was fitted and a Type 271 target indication radar was installed above the bridge, replacing the director-control tower and rangefinder. The ship also received a HF/DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast. Her short-range AA armament was augmented by four Oerlikon guns and the .50-calibre machine guns were replaced by a pair of Oerlikons. A split Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar was installed abreast &#x27;A&#x27; gun and stowage for 60 depth charges provided; &#x27;Y&#x27; gun and the 12-pounder had to be removed to compensate for their weight. By the end of the war, a Type 277 radar had replaced the Type 271, and the Type 286 had been superseded by a Type 291.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Express&quot;, the eighth ship of that name to serve with the Royal Navy, was ordered 1 November 1932, from Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson at Wallsend under the 1931 Naval Programme, for use as a destroyer that could quickly be converted for use as a minelayer when required. She was laid down 24 March 1932, and launched on 29 May 1934. The ship was commissioned on 2 November 1934, at a total cost of £247,279, excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament.

&quot;Express&quot; and her sister ships were assigned to the 5th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet. She remained at home for the next nine months while her armament was adjusted at Sheerness Dockyard from 13 December to 5 January 1935. The ship was attached to the Mediterranean Fleet, together with most of the rest of her flotilla, beginning in September 1935, during the Abyssinian Crisis, and returned home in March 1936. Upon her arrival, &quot;Express&quot; was refitted at Portsmouth Dockyard 23 March–4 May. The ship was then temporarily assigned to Gibraltar for the next two months as tensions rose before the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. She then spent the rest of the year at home, before patrolling Spanish waters in the Mediterranean in January–March 1937, enforcing the edicts of the Non-Intervention Committee. After a brief refit, &quot;Express&quot; then conducted minelaying trials for two months and was refitted again at Portsmouth between 9 August–2 October. Shortly afterwards, the ship had a fire in her forward boiler room that badly damaged her electrical cabling; she was repaired at Gibraltar from 24 October to 3 December. &quot;Express&quot; spent most of 1938 at home other than one period in Spanish waters, where she was based out of Gibraltar. During her time at Portsmouth, the ship operated as a minelayer from 15 August to 4 October, before beginning a refit there on 21 November that lasted to 16 January 1939. Upon its completion, &quot;Express&quot; returned to Gibraltar for several months. After returning to the UK, the ship escorted the President of France, Albert François Lebrun, across the English Channel on 21 March en route to his state visit to the UK. She was earmarked for conversion to a boy&#x27;s and anti-aircraft training ship in June, but shortages of crewmen put paid to the idea. &quot;Express&quot; was present at the Reserve Fleet Review on 5 August.

=== World War II ===
Shortly after the outbreak of war in September, &quot;Express&quot; joined her sister at Immingham on the North Sea on 8 September, operating under the direct control of the Commander-in-chief, Home Fleet, Admiral Sir Charles Forbes. The two destroyers made their first minelaying sortie in the Heligoland Bight on the night of 9/10 September. and did it again a week later without being detected. They then reverted to ordinary duties for the next several months, before beginning to lay defensive minefields off the English coast in November. On 12 December, the Admiralty formed the 20th Destroyer Flotilla with &quot;Express&quot; as the flotilla leader; the other ships assigned were &quot;Esk&quot; and the newly converted destroyers, and . The four destroyers laid 240 mines off the mouth of the Ems on the night of 17–18 December and the two sisters then began a refit at Portsmouth.

&quot;Express&quot; and &quot;Esk&quot; began to lay more defensive minefields in February 1940, often with the large auxiliary minelayers and . On the night of 2/3 March, the sisters were joined by the newly converted destroyers and in laying mines near Horns Reef, in the Heligoland Bight, that sank the in March, and later the submarines , , and . After resuming defensive minelaying later that month, &quot;Express&quot; was damaged in a collision with the fishing trawler &quot;Manx Admiral&quot; off Kinnaird Head on 23 March and was under repair until 24 April.

On the night of 9/10 May, &quot;Express&quot;, &quot;Esk&quot; and &quot;Intrepid&quot; laid another minefield in the Heligoland Bight and were diverted on their return voyage to escort &quot;Princess Victoria&quot; as she mined Dutch waters off Egmond the following night after the Germans invaded the Netherlands on 10 May. This began an intensive series of minelaying sorties in Dutch waters during the rest of the month that saw three German minesweepers sunk on 26 July. The minelaying, however, was interrupted at the end of the month by the need to evacuate the British Expeditionary Force from Dunkirk. On 29 May, &quot;Express&quot; towed the disabled destroyer clear of a wreck in Dunkirk harbour and transferred many of her evacuees aboard before she could repair her engines later that day. The following day, Rear-Admiral Frederic Wake-Walker, commanding the ships involved in the evacuation, briefly hoisted his flag aboard her. She was lightly damaged by bomb splinters on 31 May, but continued to ferry soldiers back to England. The ship and the destroyer were the last ships to leave Dunkirk with troops on 4 June when the evacuation ended. She brought out 3,419 troops over the course of the operation.
The ships of the 20th Flotilla resumed minelaying operations on 15 June, although most of these over the next several months were defensive in nature. On the evening of 31 August 1940, &quot;Express&quot;, &quot;Esk&quot;, &quot;Icarus&quot;, &quot;Intrepid&quot;, and &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; departed Immingham to lay an offensive minefield off Texel, with cover provided by three destroyers of the 5th DF. At 23:07 it became clear that the ships of the 20th Flotilla had entered a German minefield when &quot;Express&quot; struck a mine abreast &#x27;B&#x27; gun, losing her entire bow up to the bridge. The detonation killed 4 officers and 54 ratings; one officer and 7 crewmen were later rescued by the Germans. &quot;Esk&quot; and &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, the closest ships to &quot;Express&quot;, closed to render assistance, while the other two destroyers turned hard to starboard and retraced their route to exit the minefield, according to standing orders. Five minutes after the first mine detonated, &quot;Esk&quot;″s bow struck a mine and she came to a stop. Five minutes later &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; struck another mine that badly damaged her bow. At about 23:20, &quot;Esk&quot; struck another mine amidships that detonated her magazines. By 01:40, &quot;Express&quot; had managed to raise steam again and steamed astern to minimise the pressure of the water on her shored-up bulkheads.

The Admiralty dispatched nine motor torpedo boats (MTB) to go to the assistance of &quot;Express&quot; and &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; once they had been notified of the incident by &quot;Intrepid&quot; and ordered that the destroyers of the 5th DF were not to enter the minefield. Captain Louis Mountbatten of the 5th DF complied until he received the report of a Royal Air Force Lockheed Hudson bomber that had spotted the two damaged destroyers about 07:00 about east of his position. The MTBs reached the ships first, around 08:00, and evacuated all of &quot;Express&quot;″s crew. Mountbatten&#x27;s destroyers spotted &quot;Express&quot; around 08:40, and took her in tow, stern first, twenty minutes later. The tow cable, however, fouled one of &quot;Kelvin&quot;″s propellers and had to be cut. then took over the tow. The threat of aerial attack at 19:45 forced &quot;Jupiter&quot; to slip her tow and allow one of the attending tugboats to take over the task. &quot;Express&quot; finally arrived at Hull at 17:30 on 2 September 1940. The ship was under repair at Chatham Dockyard until 4 October 1941.

==== To the Far East ====
&quot;Express&quot; was ordered to escort the battleship &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; to the Far East with her sister where the ships would form the nucleus of a new Eastern Fleet intended to deter Japanese aggression. The trio departed Greenock on 25 October and arrived at Colombo, Ceylon, on 28 November. The following day, the destroyers and &quot;Jupiter&quot; joined them from the Mediterranean Fleet as did the battlecruiser &quot;Repulse&quot;. The force then set course for Singapore, where they arrived on 2 December.

===== Force Z =====
After receiving the reports of the attack on Pearl Harbor and landings in Malaya by the Japanese, Force Z put to sea in the late afternoon of 8 December in an attempt to intercept the invasion convoys. This consisted of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot;, escorted by four destroyers, &quot;Electra&quot;, &quot;Express&quot;, , and the Australian . The ships were spotted during the afternoon of 9 December by the , and floatplanes from several Japanese cruisers spotted the British ships later that afternoon and shadowed them until dark. Admiral Sir Tom Phillips decided to cancel the operation as the Japanese were now alerted. Force Z turned back during the evening, after having tried to deceive the Japanese that they were heading to Singora. At 00:50 on 10 December Admiral Philips received a signal of enemy landings at Kuantan and correspondingly altered course so that he would arrive shortly after dawn.

The crew of the spotted Force Z at 02:20, reported their position, and fired five torpedoes, all of which missed. Based on this report the Japanese launched 11 reconnaissance aircraft before dawn to locate Force Z. Several hours later 86 bombers from the 22nd Air Flotilla based in Saigon were launched carrying bombs or torpedoes. Once the British ships reached Kuantan around 07:50, &quot;Express&quot; was sent to investigate the area, but there was nothing to find. The crew of a Mitsubishi G3M &quot;Nell&quot; reconnaissance bomber spotted the British at 10:15 and radioed in several reports; the first bombers arrived less than an hour later. They ignored the destroyers and sank both &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; by 13:20. &quot;Electra&quot; and &quot;Vampire&quot; moved in to rescue survivors of &quot;Repulse&quot;, while &quot;Express&quot; rescued survivors of the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. All told, the three destroyers rescued over 2,081 survivors.

Afterwards, &quot;Express&quot; escorted the minelayers &quot;Teviot Bank&quot;, , and the Dutch as they laid defensive minefield around Singapore. On 24 December, she laid 18 mines of her own to block Japanese access to the harbour of Penang. The ship also escorted convoys to and from Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. &quot;Express&quot; was transferred to the China Force, which controlled all convoys in the ABDACOM area, on 20 January 1942. Despite a boiler room fire on 6 February that damaged some of her electrical cabling and fuel tanks, the ship remained on escort duties until she arrived at Simonstown, South Africa, on 25 April to begin repairs that lasted until 26 June.

&quot;Express&quot; was assigned to the 12th DF of the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean after her repairs were completed. She escorted the aircraft carrier on 10 September as her aircraft supported the landings at Majunga that were intended to facilitate the complete occupation of Madagascar and then returned home in February 1943 to be converted into an escort destroyer.

==== Canadian service ====
The conversion was completed on 2 June; the following day, &quot;Express&quot; was loaned to the Royal Canadian Navy and commissioned with the name &quot;Gatineau&quot;. On 15 June, the ship was given to Canada where she was assigned to Escort Group C3 and assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force for convoy duties in the North Atlantic. While protecting Convoy HX 280, she helped to sink the on 6 March 1944. Two months later, &quot;Gatineau&quot; was transferred to the 11th Escort Group, based at Derry, to prepare for the invasion of France (Operation Overlord) by patrolling British waters. She sailed to Halifax in July to begin a lengthy refit that lasted from 3 August to 16 February 1945. The ship spent March working up at the Anti-Submarine Training School at Tobermory before beginning anti-submarine patrols in British waters until the end of the war in May. &quot;Gatineau&quot; returned to Canada in June and was refitted in Halifax 11–19 July before she was transferred to the West Coast. The ship was paid off into reserve at Esquimalt on 10 January 1946 and struck from the Navy List on 1 April 1947. &quot;Gatineau&quot; was then sold to Capital Iron &amp; Steel Metals of Victoria, British Columbia; her hulk was used to form a breakwater at Royston, British Columbia () in 1948. She remained visible for many years, but little remained of her hull by 2004.

<doc id="746638" wikidata="Q4083121" url="?curid=746638" title="White armour">
<text>White armour, or &quot;alwyte armour&quot;, was a form of plate armour worn in the Late Middle Ages characterized by full-body steel plate without a surcoat. Around 1420 the surcoat, or &quot;coat of arms&quot; as it was known in England, began to disappear, in favour of uncovered plate. Areas not covered by plate were protected by mail sewn to the gambeson underneath.

During the fifteenth century national styles of armour emerged. &#x27;White armour&#x27; was a term used synonymously with Italian design, which was innovative in expanding the use of plate armour to cover joints that had been previously protected by mail. The descriptive term &quot;white armour&quot; referred both to the absence of a surcoat and the absence of decorative trimmings: the rival German style was fluted, both for aesthetic reasons and for structural advantage in resisting crushing blows. Unlike its predecessors, white armour had a very plain and simple finish, as opposed to intricate patterns or symbols emblazoned on its plates. White armour was also exclusively worn by nobles, or those with money, as full plate armour was extremely expensive to create.

Suits of white armour were composed of a helmet, a gorget (or bevor), pauldrons with gardbraces in Italian and French armour to cover the armpits, or besagews (also known as rondels) which were mostly used in Gothic Armour, couters, vambraces, gauntlets, a cuirass (back and breastplate) with a fauld, tassets and a culet, a mail skirt, cuisses, poleyns, greaves, and sabatons.
Unlike its predecessors, white armour provided almost complete invulnerability to all sword strikes except a strong thrust from the tip. Additionally, since white armour was a later version of plate armour, it was fairly light and provided its wearer a comfortable range of motion.

These two approaches to armouring remained recognizable throughout the fifteenth century. Eventually each borrowed the other&#x27;s innovations. By the early sixteenth century the distinction became obsolete.

Black and white armour is a different term, for late 16th and 17th century armour that uses a contrast between highly burnished &quot;white&quot; and unpolished &quot;black&quot; areas for decorative effect in large bold patterns over the armour.

<text>The Bedford Institute of Oceanography (BIO) is a major Government of Canada ocean research facility located in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. BIO is the largest ocean research station in Canada. Established in 1962 as Canada&#x27;s first, and currently largest, federal centre for oceanographic research, BIO derives its name from the Bedford Basin, an inland bay comprising the northern part of Halifax Harbour, upon which it is located.

Spread out over 40 acres (160,000 m2) of a former Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) property near Shannon Park in Dartmouth, BIO consists of a series of interconnected buildings housing research labs and offices, as well as docks for Canadian Coast Guard and RCN research vessels.

As the federal government seeks to concentrate its operations in the Halifax Regional Municipality, BIO is being considered for additional office buildings to house other non-oceanographic and non-research organizations and their employees. As such, new buildings have been built for the Canadian Coast Guard as well as Environment Canada in recent years.

==History==

Following World War II, the principal marine research facility of the Government of Canada was the St. Andrews Biological Station. Dr. W.E. van Steenburgh, Director-General of Scientific Services of the Department of Mines and Technical Surveys, championed the establishment of a modern oceanographic institute on Bedford Basin. The Bedford Institute of Oceanography and its research vessel, the CCGS &quot;Hudson&quot;, were both inaugurated in 1962.

A chemical spill occurred on the premises on January 22, 2025. Residents within a 250-meter area were required to evacuate. This also closed the MacKay Bridge. 

==Current operations==
BIO houses several organizations from various federal departments which perform targeted research mandated by government or in partnership, advise on marine environments, provide navigational charts covering Georges Bank to the Canadian Arctic, and respond to environmental emergencies.

A team led by Dr. John Smith at BIO published the first paper on the spread of radioactivity across the Pacific Ocean following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The scientists gathered samples of water as far as off the coast of British Columbia to ascertain how long it took traces of cesium 137 and cesium 134 to reach the west coast of North America.

In 2015 the institute received $3.5 million in federal funding for facilities upgrades. Much of the funding will be used to upgrade the fish lab, to upgrade the facilities of the Geological Survey of Canada, and for general building repairs.

==Federal departments and agencies==
The following departments and agencies of the Government of Canada maintain facilities at BIO:

* Fisheries and Oceans Canada (Maritime Region)
** Canadian Coast Guard (Maritime Region)
** Canadian Hydrographic Service (Atlantic)
* Natural Resources Canada (Atlantic Region)
** Geological Survey of Canada (Atlantic)
* Environment Canada
* National Defence
** Working with CHS Atlantic.
* Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada
** Canadian Food Inspection Agency

==Facilities==
In addition to office and research space, BIO has extensive laboratories, particularly for performing research into aquatic species. Tours of BIO are offered for visitors during the summer months and a popular tour destination are some of the large aquariums and tanks used for research. There are also &quot;touch tanks&quot; in a facility called the Sea Pavilion where visitors are permitted to handle North Atlantic lobster, snow crabs, rock crabs, clams (also known as pea clams), sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and other species. Some tanks are transparent and allow visitors to view giant mackerel and sturgeon as well as other rare and interesting specimens such as a lobster that is half male and half female. The Sea Pavilion contains information concerning leatherback sea turtles, Atlantic whitefish, northern right whales, sharks, lake whitefish, largemouth bass, brook trout, Atlantic wolffish, and Atlantic pickerel. There are also displays featuring protected areas such as Sable Island and The Gully and special interest areas such as Halifax Harbour and the Bay of Fundy.

==Transportation==
The Bedford Institute of Oceanography is served by a public bus route, Halifax Transit route 51. It links BIO to the Bridge Terminal and Burnside, via Windmill Road, at peak hours only.

:Supplement X: Über die Composition der binären quadratische Formen (On the composition of binary quadratic forms)
:Supplement XI: Über die Theorie der ganzen algebraischen Zahlen (On the theory of algebraic integers)

Chapters 1 to 4 cover similar ground to Gauss&#x27; , and Dedekind added footnotes which specifically cross-reference the relevant sections of the . These chapters can be thought of as a summary of existing knowledge, although Dirichlet simplifies Gauss&#x27;s presentation, and introduces his own proofs in some places.

Chapter 5 contains Dirichlet&#x27;s derivation of the class number formula for real and imaginary quadratic fields. Although other mathematicians had conjectured similar formulae, Dirichlet gave the first rigorous proof.

Supplement VI contains Dirichlet&#x27;s proof that an arithmetic progression of the form &quot;a&quot;+&quot;nd&quot; where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are coprime contains an infinite number of primes.

===Importance===
The can be seen as a watershed between the classical number theory of Fermat, Jacobi and Gauss, and the modern number theory of Dedekind, Riemann and Hilbert. Dirichlet does not explicitly recognise the concept of the group that is central to modern algebra, but many of his proofs show an implicit understanding of group theory.

The contains two key results in number theory which were first proved by Dirichlet. The first of these is the class number formulae for binary quadratic forms. The second is a proof that arithmetic progressions contains an infinite number of primes (known as Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem); this proof introduces Dirichlet L-series. These results are important milestones in the development of analytic number theory.

==Kronecker&#x27;s book==

Leopold Kronecker&#x27;s book was first published in 1901 in 2 parts and reprinted by Springer in 1978. It covers elementary and algebraic number theory, including Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem.

==Landau&#x27;s book==

Edmund Landau&#x27;s book &quot;Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie&quot; was first published as a 3-volume set in 1927. The first half of volume 1 was published as 
&quot;Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie. Aus der elementare Zahlentheorie&quot; in 1950, with an English translation in 1958 under the title &quot;Elementary number theory&quot;. In 1969 Chelsea republished the second half of volume 1 together with volumes 2 and 3 as a single volume. 

Volume 1 on elementary and additive number theory includes the topics such as Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem, Brun&#x27;s sieve, binary quadratic forms, Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture, Waring&#x27;s problem, and the Hardy–Littlewood work on the singular series. Volume 2 covers topics in analytic number theory, such as estimates for the error in the prime number theorem, and topics in geometric number theory such as estimating numbers of lattice points. Volume 3 covers algebraic number theory, including ideal theory, quadratic number fields, and applications to Fermat&#x27;s last theorem. Many of the results described by Landau were state of the art at the time but have since been superseded by stronger results.

==Hasse&#x27;s book==

Helmut Hasse&#x27;s book &quot;Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie&quot; was published in 1950, and is different from and more elementary than his book &quot;Zahlentheorie&quot;. It covers elementary number theory, Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem, and quadratic fields.

<text>During the 1950s and 1960s the Soviet space program used dogs for sub-orbital and orbital space flights to determine whether human spaceflight was feasible. These dogs, including Laika, the first animal to orbit Earth, were surgically modified to provide the necessary information for human survival in space. The Soviet space program typically used female dogs due to their anatomical compatibility with the spacesuit. Similarly, they used mix-breed dogs due to their apparent hardiness.

In this period, the Soviet Union launched missions with passenger slots for at least 57 dogs. Some dogs flew more than once. Most survived; those that died were lost mostly through technical failures, according to the parameters of the test. Laika was an exception and was expected to die during her Earth-orbiting 3 November 1957 Sputnik 2.

==Training==
Dogs were the preferred animal for the experiments because scientists felt dogs were well suited to endure long periods of inactivity. As part of their training, they were confined in small boxes for 15–20 days at a time. Stray dogs, rather than animals accustomed to living in a house, were chosen because the scientists felt they would be able to tolerate the rigorous and extreme stresses of space flight better than other dogs. Female dogs were used because of their temperament and because the suit the dogs wore in order to collect urine and feces was equipped with a special device, designed to work only with females.

Their training included standing still for long periods of time, wearing space suits, being placed in simulators that acted like a rocket during launch, riding in centrifuges that simulated the high acceleration of a rocket launch and being kept in progressively smaller cages to prepare them for the confines of the space module. Dogs that flew in orbit were fed a nutritious jelly-like protein. This was high in fiber and assisted the dogs to defecate during long periods of time while in their small space module. More than 60% of dogs to enter space were reportedly suffering from constipation and gallstones on arrival back to base.

==Sub-orbital flights==

Dogs were flown to an altitude of on board 15 scientific flights on R-1 rockets (itself a copy of the German V-2) from 1951 to 1956. The dogs wore pressure suits with acrylic glass bubble helmets. From 1957 to 1960, 11 flights with dogs were made on the R-2A series (developed from the R-1 missile) which flew to about . Three flights were made to an altitude of about on R-5A rockets in 1958. In the R-2 and R-5 rockets, the dogs were contained in a pressured cabin.

===Dezik, Tsygan, and Lisa-1===

Dezik (Дезик) and Tsygan (Цыган, &quot;Gypsy&quot;) were the first dogs to make a sub-orbital flight and successfully recovered on 22 July 1951. Both dogs were recovered unharmed after travelling to a maximum altitude of . Dezik made another sub-orbital flight in 1951 with the first dog named Lisa (Лиса, &quot;Fox&quot;), although neither survived because the parachute failed to deploy. After the death of Dezik, Tsygan was adopted as a pet by Soviet physicist Anatoli Blagonravov.

===Lisa-2 and Ryzhik===
Lisa-2 (Лиса, &quot;Fox&quot; or &quot;Vixen&quot;) and Ryzhik (Рыжик, &quot;Ginger&quot; (red-haired)) flew to an altitude of on 2 June 1954.

===Smelaya and Malyshka===
Smelaya (Смелая, &quot;Brave&quot; or &quot;Courageous&quot;, &quot;fem.&quot;) was due to make a flight in September but ran away the day before the launch. She was found the next day and went on to make a successful flight with a dog named Malyshka (Малышка, &quot;Baby&quot;). They both crashed after the rocket failed to deploy a parachute, and were found the next day by the recovery team.

===Bobik and ZIB===
Bobik (Бобик, common Russian name for a small dog) ran away just days before her flight was scheduled to take place on 15 September 1961. A replacement named ZIB (ЗИБ, a Russian acronym for &quot;Substitute for Missing Bobik&quot;, &quot;Замена Исчезнувшему Бобику&quot; &quot;Zamena Ischeznuvshemu Bobiku&quot;), who was an untrained street dog found running around the barracks, was quickly located and made a successful flight to 100 km and back.

===Otvazhnaya and Snezhinka===
Otvazhnaya (Отважная, &quot;brave one&quot;, &quot;fem.&quot;) made a flight on 2 July 1959 along with a rabbit named Marfusha (Марфуша, &quot;little Martha&quot;) and another dog named Snezhinka (Снежинка, &quot;Snowflake&quot;). She went on to make 5 other flights between 1959 and 1960.

===Albina and Tsyganka===
Albina (Альбина) and Tsyganka (Цыганка, &quot;Gypsy girl&quot;) made a flight on June 7, 1958, and were both ejected out of their capsule at an altitude of and landed safely. Albina was one of the dogs shortlisted for Sputnik 2, but never flew in orbit.

===Damka and Krasavka===
Damka (Дамка, &quot;queen of checkers&quot;) and Krasavka (Красавка, &quot;little beauty&quot; or &quot;Belladonna&quot;) were to make an orbital flight on 22 December 1960 as a part of the Vostok programme which also included mice. However their mission was marked by a string of equipment failures.

The upper-stage rocket failed and the craft re-entered the atmosphere after reaching a sub-orbital apogee of . In the event of unscheduled return to the surface, the craft was to eject the dogs and self-destruct, but the ejection seat failed and the primary destruct mechanism shorted out. The animals were thus still in the intact capsule when it returned to the surface. The backup self-destruct mechanism was set to a 60-hour timer, so a team was quickly sent out to locate and recover the capsule.

Although the capsule was reached in deep snow on the first day, there was insufficient remaining daylight to disarm the self-destruct mechanism and open the capsule. The team could only report that the window was frosted over in the degree temperatures and no signs of life were detected. On the second day, however, the dogs were heard barking as the capsule was opened. The dogs were wrapped in sheepskin coats and flown to Moscow alive, though all the mice aboard the capsule were found dead because of the cold.

Damka was also known as Shutka (Шутка, &quot;Joke&quot;) or Zhemchuzhnaya (Жемчужная, &quot;Pearly&quot;) and Krasavka was also known as Kometka (Кометка, &quot;Little Comet&quot;) or Zhulka (Жулька, &quot;Cheater&quot;). After this incident Krasavka was adopted by Oleg Gazenko, a leading Soviet scientist working with animals used in space flights. She went on to have puppies and continued living with Gazenko and his family until her death 14 years later.
After the incident Sergey Korolyov, who was the designer of the rocket, wanted to make the story public, but was prevented from doing so by state censorship.

===Bars and Lisichka===
Bars (Барс (&quot;pron.&quot; &quot;Barss&quot;); &quot;snow leopard&quot;) and Lisichka (Лисичка, &quot;little fox&quot;) were also on a mission to orbit as a part of the Vostok programme, but died after their rocket exploded 28.5 seconds into the launch on 28 July 1960. Bars was also known as Chayka (Чайка, &quot;seagull&quot;).

Other dogs that flew on sub-orbital flights include Dymka (Дымка, &quot;smoky&quot;), Modnitsa (Модница, &quot;fashionista&quot;) and Kozyavka (Козявка, &quot;booger&quot;).

At least four other dogs flew in September 1961, and two or more were lost.

==Orbital flights==

===Laika===
On 3 November 1957 Laika (Лайка, &quot;barker&quot;) flew to space on Sputnik 2 to become the first Earth-born creature (other than microbes) to orbit the planet. Many sub-orbital flights with animal passengers had already been to space, such as the 1949 mission of the rhesus macaque Albert II. Laika was also known as Zhuchka (Жучка, &quot;Little Bug&quot;) and Limonchik (Лимончик, &quot;Little Lemon&quot;). The American media dubbed her &quot;Muttnik&quot;, making a play on words for the canine follow-on to the first orbital mission, Sputnik. She died between five and seven hours into the flight from stress and overheating.

Laika&#x27;s true cause of death was not made public until October 2002; officials previously gave reports that she died when the oxygen supply ran out. At a Moscow press conference in 1998 Oleg Gazenko, a senior Soviet scientist involved in the project, stated &quot;The more time passes, the more I&#x27;m sorry about it. We did not learn enough from the mission to justify the death of the dog...&quot;.

===Belka and Strelka===
Belka (Белка, literally, &quot;squirrel&quot;, or alternatively &quot;Whitey&quot;) and Strelka (Стрелка, &quot;little arrow&quot;) spent a day in space aboard Korabl-Sputnik 2 (Sputnik 5) on 19 August 1960 before safely returning to Earth. They are the first higher living organisms to survive orbit in outer space.

They were accompanied by a grey rabbit, 42 mice, two rats, flies and several plants and fungi. All passengers survived. They were the first Earth-born creatures to go into orbit and return alive, and gave birth to many descendants.

===Pchyolka and Mushka===
Pchyolka (Пчёлка, &quot;little bee&quot;) and Mushka (Мушка, &quot;little fly&quot;) spent a day in orbit on 1 December 1960 on board Korabl-Sputnik-3 (Sputnik 6) with &quot;other animals&quot;, plants and insects. Due to a reentry error when the retrorockets failed to shut off when planned, their spacecraft was intentionally destroyed by remote self-destruct to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule.

Mushka was one of the three dogs trained for Sputnik 2 and was used during ground tests. She did not fly on Sputnik 2 because she refused to eat properly.

===Chernushka===
Chernushka (Чернушка, &quot;Blackie&quot;) made one orbit on board Korabl-Sputnik-4 (Sputnik 9) on 9 March 1961 with a cosmonaut dummy (whom Soviet officials nicknamed Ivan Ivanovich), mice and a guinea pig. The dummy was ejected out of the capsule during re-entry and made a soft landing using a parachute. Chernushka was recovered unharmed inside the capsule.

===Zvyozdochka===

Zvyozdochka (Zvezdochka, Звёздочка, &quot;starlet&quot;), who was named by Yuri Gagarin, made one orbit on board Korabl-Sputnik 5 on 25 March 1961 with a wooden cosmonaut dummy, and other animals in the final practice flight before Gagarin&#x27;s historic flight on 12 April. Again, the dummy was ejected out of the capsule while Zvezdochka remained inside. Both were recovered successfully.

===Veterok and Ugolyok===

Veterok (Ветерок, &quot;light breeze&quot;) and Ugolyok (Уголёк, &quot;ember&quot;) were launched on 22 February 1966 on board Cosmos 110, and spent 21 days in orbit before landing on 16 March. This spaceflight of record-breaking duration was not surpassed by humans until Soyuz 11 in June 1971 and still stands as the longest space flight by dogs. The two dogs showed signs of &quot;cardiovascular deconditioning&quot; with dehydration, weight loss, loss of muscle and coordination and took several weeks to fully recover, though they showed no long-term issues.

<doc id="746652" wikidata="Q542291" url="?curid=746652" title="Red Terror">
<text>The Red Terror () was a campaign of political repression and executions in Soviet Russia which was carried out by the Bolsheviks, chiefly through the Cheka, the Bolshevik secret police force. It officially started in early September 1918 and it lasted until 1922, though violence committed by Bolshevik soldiers, sailors, and Red Guards had been ongoing since late 1917.

Decreed after assassination attempts on Vladimir Lenin along with the successful assassinations of Petrograd Cheka leader Moisei Uritsky and party editor V. Volodarsky in alleged retaliation for Bolshevik mass repressions, the Red Terror was modeled on the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution, and sought to eliminate political dissent, opposition, and any other threat to Bolshevik power.

More broadly, the term can be applied to Bolshevik political repression throughout the Russian Civil War (1917–1922). Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky justified the repressive measures as a necessary response to the White Terror initiated in 1917.

==History==
===Background===
When the Revolution took power in November 1917, many top Bolsheviks hoped to avoid much of the violence which would come to define this period. Through one of its first decrees on 8 November 1917, the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Deputies abolished the death penalty. It had first been canceled by the February Revolution and then restored by the Kerensky&#x27;s government. Not a single death sentence was issued in the first three months of Lenin&#x27;s government, which consisted in fact of a coalition with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who, albeit terrorists in the tsarist era, were staunch opponents of the death penalty. However, as pressure mounted from the White Armies and from international intervention, the Bolsheviks moved closer to Lenin&#x27;s harsher perspective.

The Bolsheviks had employed terror before the official declaration of September 5, 1918. This early phase of the terror was mainly carried out by sailors, soldiers, and Red Guards. Their methods included confiscations, fines, executions, and hostage-taking. On January 14, 1918, Bolshevik sailors from the Black Sea Fleet killed some 300 victims at Yevpatoriya by breaking their limbs and throwing them from the steamship Romania.

Targets at the early period of violence were chiefly officers, cadets, and &#x27;bourgeois&#x27;. In mid-January in Odessa sailors killed officers and junkers (officer cadets) by throwing them from Russian cruiser Almaz. According to another account a colonel was roasted alive within the engine of a locomotive.

Several unsanctioned incidents of mob violence were perpetrated by civilian supporters of the Bolsheviks. Shortly after the Bolshevik takeover of Rostov in November 1917, workers in Taganrog surrounded fifty officer cadets, who surrendered on the understanding that their lives were to be spared. They were taken to a metal factory and thrown one at a time into the blast furnace.

The Bolsheviks also used terror as a means to dissuade unrest. On August 20, 1918 Lenin wrote to Nikolai Semashko, &#x27;I congratulate you on your energetic suppression of the kulaks and White Guards in the district. We must strike while the iron&#x27;s hot and not lose a minute, organize the poor of the district, confiscate all the grain and all the property of the rebellious kulaks, hang the kulak ringleaders, mobilize and arm the poor under reliable leaders out of our own unit, arrest hostages from among the wealthy and hold them.

Several prominent figures also fell victim to this phase of violence. On November 20th (December 3rd), 1917, General Nikolai Dukhonin surrendered himself to the Bolshevik Krylenko in Mogilev. Despite Krylenko&#x27;s efforts to defend the general, Dukhonin was lynched by a mob of Bolshevik sailors from the Baltic Fleet.

The decision to enact the Red Terror was also driven by the initial &quot;massacre of their &#x27;Red&#x27; prisoners by the office-cadres during the Moscow insurrection of October 1917&quot;, allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, and the large-scale massacres of Reds during the Finnish Civil War in which 10,000 to 20,000 revolutionaries had been killed by the Finnish Whites.
In December 1917, Felix Dzerzhinsky was appointed to the duty of rooting out counterrevolutionary threats to the Soviet government. He was the director of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission (aka Cheka), a predecessor of the KGB that served as the secret police for the Soviets.

On 21 February 1918, the death penalty was also formally re-established, as an exceptional revolutionary instrument, with the famous decree &quot;Socialist Homeland is in Danger!&quot;. In article 8, it read as follows: &quot;Enemy agents, profiteers, marauders, hooligans, counter-revolutionary agitators and German spies are to be shot on the spot&quot;.

Starting around April 1918, Russian anarchists were among the first revolutionary socialist victims of the precursors of Red Terror. Anarchists harshly criticized Bolsheviks&#x27; centralization of political power by creating the Bolshevik-dominated Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (Sovnarkom), nationalizing the land, subordinating the factory committees to the state-controlled network of trade unions, and creating the secret police organization Cheka; later, anarchists widely opposed the &quot;Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia&quot; and Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as betrayals of revolutionary internationalism and the stateless ideal. Some militant Bakuninist anarchists even advocated armed struggle against the dictatorship. Meanwhile, Bolsheviks associated violent anti-Bolshevik rhetoric and such crimes as robberies, expropriations, and murders committed by nominally anarchist criminals with all anarchists and perceived the increasingly militant and resistant anarchists as legitimate threat. Subsequently, the Sovnarkom decided to liquidate anarchist-associated criminal recklessness and disarm and disband all anarchist organizations. In Moscow and Petrograd the Cheka largely succeeded in disbanding all anarchist organizations; particularly, on 12 April 1918, the Cheka raided 26 anarchist centres in Moscow, including the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups&#x27; headquarters, namely House of Anarchy. In almost all cases the anarchists surrendered without a fight, yet in the Donskoi Monastery and at the House of Anarchy the anarchists fiercely resisted the Cheka; as a result a dozen Chekists were killed while 40 anarchists were killed or wounded, and approximately 500 more were imprisoned.

In 1922, anarchist activists Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman recounted the Cheka raid against anarchists in April 1918 thus:

Later, Goldman acknowledged many anarchists&#x27; opposition the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, yet drew no causal link between such opposition and later persecutions of anarchists by Bolsheviks.

On 16 June 1918, more than two months prior to the events that would officially catalyze the Terror, a new decree re-established the death penalty as an ordinary jurisdictional measure by instructing the Revolutionary People&#x27;s Courts to use it &quot;as the only punishment for counter-revolutionary offences&quot;.
Also prior to the events that would officially catalyze the Terror, Lenin issued orders and made speeches which included harsh expressions and descriptions of brutal measures to be taken against the &quot;class enemies&quot;, which, however, often were not actual orders or were not carried out as such. For example, in a telegram, which became known as &quot;Lenin&#x27;s hanging order&quot;, he demanded to &quot;crush&quot; landowners in Penza and to publicly hang &quot;at least 100 kulaks, rich bastards, and known bloodsuckers&quot; in response to a peasant revolt there; yet, only the 13 organizers of the murder of local authorities and the uprising were arrested, while the uprising was ended with a number of propaganda activities; in 1920, having received information that in Estonia and Latvia, with which Soviet Russia had concluded peace treaties, volunteers were being enrolled in anti-Bolshevik detachments, Lenin offered to &quot;advance by 10–20 miles (versts) and hang kulaks, priests, landowners&quot; &quot;while pretending to be greens&quot;, but instead, Lenin&#x27;s government confined itself to sending diplomatic notes; Lenin even urged to &quot;hang&quot; Anatoly Lunacharsky and &quot;Communist scum&quot;. Russian historian explains that while relatively peaceful resolutions of conflicts following Lenin&#x27;s brutal declarations and &quot;harsh words&quot; and &quot;orders&quot; offering hard measures took place &quot;not always and not everywhere&quot;, Lenin complained in his letters that his bureaucratic &quot;apparatus has already become gigantic — in some places excessively so — and under such conditions a “personal dictatorship” is entirely unrealizable and attempts to realize it would only be harmful.&quot; Loginov explains that Lenin attempted to compensate this &quot;lack of real power&quot; with either with &quot;abundance of decrees&quot; or &quot;simply with strong words.&quot;

Lenin had justified the state response to the kulak revolts due to the preceding 258 uprisings that had occurred in 1918 and the threat of the White Terror. He summarised his view that either the &quot;kulaks massacre vast numbers of workers, or the workers ruthlessly suppress the revolt of the predatory kulak minority... There can be no middle course&quot;.

===Beginnings===
Leonid Kannegisser, a young military cadet of the Imperial Russian Army, assassinated Moisey Uritsky on August 17, 1918, outside the Petrograd Cheka headquarters in retaliation for the execution of his friend and other officers.

On August 30, Socialist Revolutionary Fanny Kaplan unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate Vladimir Lenin.

During interrogation by the Cheka, she made the following statement:

Kaplan referenced the Bolsheviks&#x27; growing authoritarianism, citing their forcible shutdown of the Constituent Assembly in January 1918, the elections to which they had lost. When it became clear that Kaplan would not implicate any accomplices, she was executed in Alexander Garden, near the western walls of the Kremlin. &quot;Most sources indicate that Kaplan was executed on 3 September, the day after her transfer to the Kremlin&quot;. In 1958 the commander of the Kremlin, the former Baltic sailor Pavel Dmitriyevich Malkov (1887–1965) revealed he had personally executed Kaplan on that date upon the specific orders of Yakov Sverdlov, chief secretary of the Bolshevik Central Committee. She was killed with a bullet to the back of the head. Her corpse was bundled into a barrel and set alight so that her &quot;remains [might] be destroyed without a trace&quot;, as Sverdlov had instructed.

These events persuaded the government to heed Dzerzhinsky&#x27;s lobbying for greater terror against opposition. The campaign of mass repressions would officially begin thereafter. The Red Terror is considered to have officially begun between 17 and 30 August 1918.

===Implementation===


While recovering from his wounds, Lenin instructed: &quot;It is necessary – secretly and &quot;urgently&quot; to prepare the terror.&quot; In immediate response to the two attacks, Chekists killed approximately 1,300 &quot;bourgeois hostages&quot; held in Petrograd and Kronstadt prisons.

Bolshevik newspapers were especially integral to instigating an escalation in state violence: on August 31, the state-controlled media launched the repressive campaign through incitement of violence. One article appearing in &quot;Pravda&quot; exclaimed: &quot;the time has come for us to crush the bourgeoisie or be crushed by it... The anthem of the working class will be a song of hatred and revenge!&quot; The next day, the newspaper &quot;Krasnaia Gazeta&quot; stated that &quot;only rivers of blood can atone for the blood of Lenin and Uritsky.&quot;

The first official announcement of a Red Terror was published in &quot;Izvestia&quot; on September 3, titled &quot;Appeal to the Working Class&quot;: it had been drafted by Dzerzhinsky and his assistant Jēkabs Peterss and called for the workers to &quot;crush the hydra of counter-revolution with massive terror!&quot;; it would also make clear that &quot;anyone who dares to spread the slightest rumor against the Soviet regime will be arrested immediately and sent to a concentration camp&quot;. &quot;Izvestia&quot; also reported that, in the 4 days since the attempt on Lenin, over 500 hostages had been executed in Petrograd alone.

Subsequently, on September 5, the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars issued a decree &quot;On Red Terror&quot;, prescribing &quot;mass shooting&quot; to be &quot;inflicted without hesitation;&quot; the decree ordered the Cheka &quot;to secure the Soviet Republic from the class enemies by isolating them in concentration camps&quot;, as well as stating that counter-revolutionaries &quot;must be executed by shooting [and] that the names of the executed and the reasons of the execution must be made public.&quot;

According to official numbers, the Bolsheviks executed 500 &quot;representatives of overthrown classes&quot; (kulaks) immediately after the assassination of Uritsky. Soviet commissar Grigory Petrovsky called for an expansion of the Terror and an &quot;immediate end of looseness and tenderness.&quot;

In October 1918, Cheka commander Martin Latsis likened the Red Terror to a class war, explaining that &quot;we are destroying the &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; as a class.&quot;

On October 15, the leading Chekist Gleb Bokii, summing up the officially-ended Red Terror, reported that, in Petrograd, 800 alleged enemies had been shot and another 6,229 imprisoned. Casualties in the first two months were between 10,000 and 15,000 based on lists of summarily executed people published in newspaper &quot;Cheka Weekly&quot; and other official press. A declaration &quot;About the Red Terror&quot; by the Sovnarkom on 5 September 1918 stated:

As the Russian Civil War progressed, significant numbers of prisoners, suspects and hostages were executed because they belonged to the &quot;possessing classes&quot;. Numbers are recorded for cities occupied by the Bolsheviks:

In Kharkov there were between 2,000 and 3,000 executions in February–June 1919, and another 1,000–2,000 when the town was taken again in December of that year; in Rostov-on-Don, approximately 1,000 in January 1920; in Odessa, 2,200 in May–August 1919, then 1,500–3,000 between February 1920 and February 1921; in Kiev, at least 3,000 in February–August 1919; in Ekaterinodar, at least 3,000 between August 1920 and February 1921; In Armavir, a small town in Kuban, between 2,000 and 3,000 in August–October 1920. The list could go on and on.

In Crimea, Béla Kun and Rosalia Zemlyachka, with Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s approval, had 50,000 White prisoners of war and civilians summarily executed by shooting or hanging after the defeat of general Pyotr Wrangel at the end of 1920. They had been promised amnesty if they would surrender. This is one of the largest massacres in the Civil War. The figures related to the massacre in Crimea remain contested. Anarchist and Bolshevik Victor Serge gave a lower figure for White officers around 13,000 which he claims were exaggerated. Yet, he condemned Kun for his treacherous actions towards allied anarchists and surrendering whites. According to social scientist, Nikolay Zayats, from the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus the large, “fantastic” estimates derived from eyewitness accounts and White army emigre press. A Crimean Cheka report in 1921 showed that 441 people were shot with a modern estimation that 5,000–12,000 people in total were executed in Crimea.

At the same time, Lenin took measures even at the peak of the civil war to prevent the abuse of power by the Cheka. The case of Mrs. Pershikova may be symbolic: in 1919, she was arrested for defacing a picture-portrait of Lenin, but Lenin ordered to liberate her:
8 March 1919, Myshkin, Chairman of the Gubernia Extraordinary
Commission, Tsaritsyn. You cannot arrest people for disfiguring a portrait.
Free Valentina Pershikova at once, and if she is a counterrevolutionary,
keep an eye on her.
Kamenev says-and declares that several most prominent Cheka men confirm it-that the Chekas in the Ukraine have brought a host of evils, having been set up too early and having allowed a mass of hangers-on to get in ... It is necessary at all costs to discipline the Cheka men and throw out the alien elements. 

On 16 March 1919, all military detachments of the Cheka were combined in a single body, the Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic (a branch of the Cheka), which numbered at least 200,000 in 1921. These troops policed labor camps, ran the Gulag system, conducted prodrazverstka (requisitions of food from peasants), and put down peasant rebellions, riots by workers, and mutinies in the Red Army (which was plagued by desertions).

One of the main organizers of the Red Terror for the Bolshevik government was 2nd-Grade Army Commissar Yan Karlovich Berzin (1889–1938), whose real name was Pēteris Ķuzis. He took part in the October Revolution of 1917 and afterwards worked in the central apparatus of the Cheka. During the Red Terror, Berzin initiated the system of taking and shooting hostages to stop desertions and other &quot;acts of disloyalty and sabotage&quot;. As chief of a special department of the Latvian Red Army (later the Russian 15th Army), Berzin played a part in the suppression of the Red sailors&#x27; uprising at Kronstadt in March 1921. He particularly distinguished himself in the course of the pursuit, capture, and killing of captured sailors.

==Affected groups==

Among the victims of the Red Terror were tsarists, liberals, non-Bolshevik socialists, anarchists, members of the clergy, ordinary criminals, counter-revolutionaries, and other political dissidents. Later, industrial workers who failed to meet production quotas were also targeted.

The first victims of the Terror were the Socialist Revolutionaries (SR). Over the months of the campaign, over 800 SR members were executed, while thousands more were driven into exile or detained in labor camps. In a matter of weeks, executions carried out by the Cheka doubled or tripled the number of death sentences pronounced by the Russian Empire over the 92-year period from 1825 to 1917. While the Socialist Revolutionaries were initially the primary targets of the terror, most of its direct victims were associated with the preceding regimes.

===Peasants===
The Internal Troops of the Cheka and the Red Army practiced the terror tactics of taking and executing numerous hostages, often in connection with desertions of forcefully mobilized peasants. According to Orlando Figes, more than 1 million people deserted from the Red Army in 1918, around 2 million people deserted in 1919, and almost 4 million deserters escaped from the Red Army in 1921. Around 500,000 deserters were arrested in 1919 and close to 800,000 in 1920 by Cheka troops and special divisions created to combat desertions. Thousands of deserters were killed, and their families were often taken hostage. According to Lenin&#x27;s instructions,

In September 1918, in just twelve provinces of Russia, 48,735 deserters and 7,325 brigands were arrested: 1,826 were executed and 2,230 were deported. A typical report from a Cheka department stated:

Estimates suggest that during the suppression of the Tambov Rebellion of 1920–1921, around 100,000 peasant rebels and their families were imprisoned or deported and perhaps 15,000 executed. During the rebellion, Mikhail Tukhachevsky (chief Red Army commander in the area) authorized Bolshevik military forces to use chemical weapons against villages with civilian population and rebels. Publications in local Communist newspapers openly glorified liquidations of &quot;bandits&quot; with the poison gas.

This campaign marked the beginning of the Gulag, and some scholars have estimated that 70,000 were imprisoned by September 1921 (this number excludes those in several camps in regions that were in revolt, such as Tambov). Conditions in these camps led to high mortality rates, and &quot;repeated massacres&quot; took place. The Cheka at the Kholmogory camp adopted the practice of drowning bound prisoners in the nearby Dvina river. Occasionally, entire prisons were &quot;emptied&quot; of inmates via mass shootings prior to abandoning a town to White forces.

===Industrial workers===
On 16 March 1919, Cheka stormed the Putilov factory. Hundreds of workers who went to a strike were arrested, of whom around 200 were executed without trial during the next few days. Numerous strikes took place in the spring of 1919 in cities of Tula, Oryol, Tver, Ivanovo, and Astrakhan. Starving workers sought to obtain food rations matching those of Red Army soldiers. They also demanded the elimination of privileges for Bolsheviks, freedom of the press, and free elections. The Cheka mercilessly suppressed all strikes, using arrests and executions.

In the city of Astrakhan, a revolt led by the White Guard forces broke out. In preparing this revolt, the Whites managed to smuggle more than 3000 rifles and machine guns into the city. The leaders of the plot decided to act on the night 9–10 March 1919. The rebels were joined by wealthy peasants from the villages, which suppressed the Committees of the Poor, and committed massacres against rural activists. Eyewitnesses reported atrocities in villages such as Ivanchug, Chagan, Karalat. In response, Soviet forces led by Kirov undertook to suppress this revolt in the villages, and together with the Committees of the Poor restored Soviet power. The revolt in Astrakhan was brought under control by 10 March, and completely defeated by the 12th. More than 184 were sentenced to death, including monarchists, and representatives of the Kadets, Left-Socialist Revolutionaries, repeat offenders, and persons shown to have links with British and American intelligence services. The opposition media with political opponents like Chernov, and Melgunov, and others would later say that between 2,000 and 4,000 were shot or drowned from 12 to 14 of March 1919. 

However, strikes continued. Lenin had concerns about the tense situation regarding workers in the Ural region. On 29 January 1920, he sent a telegram to Vladimir Smirnov stating &quot;I am surprised that you are putting up with this and do not punish sabotage with shooting; also the delay over the transfer here of locomotives is likewise manifest sabotage; please take the most resolute measures.&quot;

At these times, there were numerous reports that Cheka interrogators used torture. At Odessa, the Cheka tied White officers to planks and slowly fed them into furnaces or tanks of boiling water; in Kharkiv, scalpings and hand-flayings were commonplace: the skin was peeled off victims&#x27; hands to produce &quot;gloves&quot;; the Voronezh Cheka rolled naked people around in barrels studded internally with nails; victims were crucified or stoned to death at Yekaterinoslav; the Cheka at Kremenchuk impaled members of the clergy and buried alive rebelling peasants; in Oryol, water was poured on naked prisoners bound in the winter streets until they became living ice statues; in Kiev, Chinese Cheka detachments placed rats in iron tubes sealed at one end with wire netting and the other placed against the body of a prisoner, with the tubes being heated until the rats gnawed through the victim&#x27;s body in an effort to escape.

Executions took place in prison cellars or courtyards, or occasionally on the outskirts of town, during the Red Terror and Russian Civil War. After the condemned were stripped of their clothing and other belongings, which were shared among the Cheka executioners, they were either machine-gunned in batches or dispatched individually with a revolver. Those killed in prison were usually shot in the back of the neck as they entered the execution cellar, which became littered with corpses and soaked with blood. Victims killed outside the town were moved by truck, bound and gagged, to their place of execution, where they sometimes were made to dig their own graves.

According to Edvard Radzinsky, &quot;it became a common practice to take a husband hostage and wait for his wife to come and purchase his life with her body&quot;. During decossackization, there were massacres, according to historian Robert Gellately, &quot;on an unheard of scale&quot;. The Pyatigorsk Cheka organized a &quot;day of Red Terror&quot; to execute 300 people in one day, and took quotas from each part of town. According to the Chekist , the Cheka in Kislovodsk, &quot;for lack of a better idea&quot;, killed all the patients in the hospital. In October 1920 alone more than 6,000 people were executed. Gellately adds that Communist leaders &quot;sought to justify their ethnic-based massacres by incorporating them into the rubric of the &#x27;class struggle.

===Clergy===
Members of the clergy were subjected to particularly brutal abuse. According to documents cited by Alexander Yakovlev, then head of the Presidential Committee for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Political Repression, priests, monks and nuns were crucified, thrown into cauldrons of boiling tar, scalped, strangled, given Communion with melted lead and drowned in holes in the ice. An estimated 3,000 were put to death in 1918 alone.

==Number of deaths==
There is no consensus among the Western historians on the number of deaths from the Red Terror. James Ryan writes that there were &quot;at lowest estimates&quot; &quot;on average&quot; 28,000 executions per year from December 1917 to February 1922., and that the number of people shot during the initial period of the Red Terror is at least 10,000. Estimates for the whole period range from of 50,000 executions to an upper of 140,000 to 200,000 people (plus an additional 400,000 killed in prisons or in suppressions of local rebellions - the latter (highest) figures were presented by Robert Conquest. The lowest among the estimates &quot;of those who died at the hands of the Soviet government&quot; cited by Evan Mawdsley is a figure of 12,733 executed by the Cheka between 1917 and 1920 as estimated by Martin Latsis; Mawdsley writes that &quot;Latsis&#x27;s figures seem too low, and Conquest&#x27;s too high, but one can only guess&quot;, implying the figures of 50,000 victims presented by William Henry Chamberlin and 140,000 victims presented by George Leggett to be more plausible. Ronald Hingley wrote that Chamberlin&#x27;s estimate &quot;must be nearer the truth&quot; than &quot;1,700,000, which appears to be a considerable exaggeration.&quot;

Some contemporary historians present figures exceeding a million of victims: believes the number of victims of the Red Terror to be &quot;up to 1.3 millions&quot; compared to between 20,000 and 100,000 of the White Terror, while a Russian historian V. Erlikhman, whose estimates are cited by Jonathan D. Smele, presents the figure of 1,200,000 deaths caused by the Red Terror compared to 300,000 victims of the White Terror.

In 1924, Popular Socialist, Sergei Melgunov (1879–1956), published a detailed account on the Red Terror in Russia, where he cited Professor Charles Saroléa&#x27;s counts of 1,766,188 executions. He questioned the accuracy of the figures, but endorsed Saroléa&#x27;s &quot;characterisation of terror in Russia&quot;, stating it &quot;in general matches reality&quot;. Other sources have also characterized the widely circulated claim of 1,700,000 deaths to be a &quot;wild exaggeration&quot; and placed estimations closer to 50,000 over the three year Civil War period. British historian Ronald Hingley attributed the exaggerated claim of 1,700,000 to a quoted statement from White Army leader Anton Denikin. However, according to historian W. Bruce Lincoln (1989), the best estimations for the number of executions in total put the number at about 100,000.

According to Robert Conquest, a total of 140,000 people were shot in 1917–1922, but Jonathan D. Smele estimates they were considerably fewer, &quot;perhaps less than half that many&quot;. According to others, the number of people shot by the Cheka in 1918–1922 is about 37,300 people, shot in 1918–1921 by the verdicts of the tribunals – 14,200, although executions and atrocities were not limited to the Cheka, having been organized by the Red Army as well.

==Justification by Bolsheviks==

The Red Terror in Soviet Russia was justified in Soviet historiography as a wartime campaign against counter-revolutionaries during the Russian Civil War of 1918–1922, targeting those who sided with the Whites (White Army). In his book, &quot;Terrorism and Communism: A Reply to Karl Kautsky,&quot; Trotsky also argued that the reign of terror began with the White Terror under the White Guard forces and the Bolsheviks responded with the Red Terror. Kautsky pleaded with Lenin against using violence as a form of terrorism because it was indiscriminate, intended to frighten the civilian population and included the taking and executing hostages: &quot;Among the phenomena for which Bolshevism has been responsible, terrorism, which begins with the abolition of every form of freedom of the Press, and ends in a system of wholesale execution, is certainly the most striking and the most repellent of all.&quot;

Martin Latsis, chief of the Ukrainian Cheka, stated in the newspaper &quot;Krasny Terror&quot; (&quot;Red Terror&quot;):

Lenin in response mildly criticized Latsis&#x27; determination:

The Red Terror was described succinctly from the Bolshevik point of view by Grigory Zinoviev in mid-September 1918:

From an opposite point of view to the Bolsheviks&#x27;, in November 1918, Left Socialist Revolutionary leader Maria Spiridonova, while being in prison and awaiting trial, condemned the Red Terror in her Open Letter to the Central Executive of the Bolshevik party. She wrote:
==Interpretations by historians==
Historians such as Stéphane Courtois and Richard Pipes have argued that the Bolsheviks needed to use terror to stay in power because they lacked popular support; Pipes is a representative of &#x27;neo-traditionalist&#x27; historians who oppose &#x27;revisionists&#x27;, who put an emphasis on the &#x27;popular&#x27; nature of the Bolshevik Revolution, and follow &#x27;totalitarian&#x27; approach which continued the &#x27;traditionalist&#x27; approach which dominated during the Cold War; for &#x27;traditionalists&#x27; and &#x27;neo-traditionalists&#x27;, the Revolution was something imposed &#x27;from above&#x27; by the revolutionaries with political guile and brute force. Although the Bolsheviks dominated among workers, soldiers and in their revolutionary soviets, they won less than a quarter of the popular vote in elections for the Constituent Assembly held soon after the October Revolution, since they commanded much less support among the peasantry. The Constituent Assembly elections predated the split between the Right SRs, who had opposed the Bolsheviks, and the Left SRs, who were their coalition partners, consequentially many peasant votes intended for the latter went to the SRs. Massive strikes by Russian workers were &quot;mercilessly&quot; suppressed during the Red Terror.

According to Pipes, terror was inevitably justified by Lenin&#x27;s belief that human lives were expendable in the cause of building the new order of communism. Pipes has quoted Marx&#x27;s observation of the class struggles in 19th-century France: &quot;The present generation resembles the Jews whom Moses led through the wilderness. It must not only conquer a new world, it must also &quot;perish&quot; in order to make room for the people who are fit for a new world&quot;; yet, Pipes noted that neither Karl Marx nor Friedrich Engels encouraged mass murder.

Eric Hobsbawm, despite his sympathy for the October Revolution and Communist movements, also recognized Lenin&#x27;s beliefs, like his view of political struggle as a total war and a zero-sum game, as one of the reasons of the Red Terror and the mass violence carried out by the Bolsheviks, although he writes that &quot;it was not so much the belief that a great end justifies all the means necessary to achieve it..., or even the belief that the sacrifices imposed on the present generation, however large, are as nothing to the benefits which will be reaped by the endless generations of the future&quot;, but &quot;the application of the principle of total war to all times. Leninism, perhaps because of the powerful strain of voluntarism which made other Marxists distrust Lenin as a &#x27;Blanquist&#x27; or &#x27;Jacobin,&#x27; thought essentially in military terms, as his own admiration for Clausewitz would indicate, even if the entire vocabulary of Bolshevik politics did not bear witness to it.&quot;

Orlando Figes&#x27; view was that Red Terror was implicit, not so much in Marxism itself, but in the tumultuous violence of the Russian Revolution. He noted that there were a number of Bolsheviks, led by Lev Kamenev, Nikolai Bukharin, and Mikhail Olminsky, who criticized the actions and warned that thanks to &quot;Lenin&#x27;s violent seizure of power and his rejection of democracy,&quot; the Bolsheviks would be &quot;forced to turn increasingly to terror to silence their political critics and subjugate a society they could not control by other means.&quot; Figes also asserts that the Red Terror &quot;erupted from below. It was an integral element of the social revolution from the start. The Bolsheviks encouraged but did not create this mass terror. The main institutions of the Terror were all shaped, at least in part, in response to these pressures from below.&quot;

The Hungarian historian supports the view that terror was rather a result of objective processes, and notes that Lenin, as Trotsky wrote earlier, formed his more differentiated position regarding terror over a period of years, and in the period of the First Russian Revolution, Lenin objected terror as a means of &quot;expropriating private property&quot;, since the revolutionary forces were not at war with individuals, but with the system, and viewed terror only as a secondary tool of countering state violence in the moments of revolutionary upheaval, and in 1907, the Bolsheviks accepted a resolution which denounced terror and rejected it as a method in advance; Krausz writes that terror was not something rooted in revolutionary theory, but a result of a combination of Russian traditions of political violence with the cult of violence brought by World War I and the escalation of struggle into a civil war, in which both sides sought to annihilate each other, and likely with Mikhail Bakunin&#x27;s idea of a &quot;collective Razin&quot; embodied both in the popular rebellion and in the popular leader &quot;at the head of the masses&quot;, a concept spread among Russian revolutionaries, and the Marxist concept of &#x27;dictatorship of proletariat&#x27;; Lenin also drew the idea of a necessity of terror from his reading of the histories of the French Revolution and American Civil War.

Leszek Kołakowski wrote that while Bolsheviks (especially Lenin) were very much focused on the Marxian concept of &quot;violent revolution&quot; and dictatorship of the proletariat long before the October Revolution, implementation of the dictatorship was clearly defined by Lenin as early as in 1906, when he argued it must involve &quot;unlimited power based on force and not on law,&quot; power that is &quot;absolutely unrestricted by any rules whatever and based directly on violence.&quot; In &quot;The State and Revolution&quot; of 1917, Lenin once again reiterated the arguments raised by Marx and Engels calling for use of terror. Voices such as Kautsky calling for moderate use of violence met &quot;furious reply&quot; from Lenin in &quot;The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky&quot; (1918). Another theoretical and systematic argument in favor of organized terror in response to Kautsky&#x27;s reservations was written by Trotsky in &quot;The Defense of Terrorism&quot; (1921). Trotsky argued that in the light of historical materialism, it is sufficient that the violence is successful for it to justify its rightness. Trotsky also introduced and provided ideological justification for many of the future features characterizing the Bolshevik system such as &quot;militarization of labor&quot; and concentration camps.

A number of historians, such as Pipes and Nicolas Werth (&quot;The Black Book of Communism&quot;), contrasted the Red and White Terrors, claiming that while Red Terror was a political strategy and a &quot;revolutionary&quot; means of reconstructing the world, ideological and instrumental, the White Terror was restorative, arbitrary and a temporary measure, mere &quot;repressive violence&quot; to re-establish a previous status quo. Robert Conquest was convinced that &quot;unprecedented terror must seem necessary to ideologically motivated attempts to transform society massively and speedily, against its natural possibilities&quot;, while Werth wrote:
The Bolshevik policy of terror was more systematic, better organized, and targeted at whole social classes. Moreover, it had been thought out and put into practice before the outbreak of the civil war. The White Terror was never systematized in such a fashion. It was almost invariably the work of detachments that were out of control, and taking measures not officially authorized by the military command that was attempting, without much success, to act as a government. If one discounts the pogroms, which Denikin himself condemned, the White Terror most often was a series of reprisals by the police acting as a sort of military counterespionage force. The Cheka and the Troops for the Internal Defense of the Republic were a structured and powerful instrument of repression of a completely different order, which had support at the highest level from the Bolshevik regime.
Such notion is refuted by Peter Holquist and Joshua Sanborn. Holquist wrote that &quot;White violence may have been less centralized and systematic, but it did not lack ideological underpinnings. [...] It is hard to imagine that the massacre of tens of
thousands of Jews by the anti-Soviet armies during the civil wars... could have occurred without some form of ideology – and particularly the virulent linkage drawn between Jews and Communists.&quot; According to Sanborn, the terror carried out by the Russian Imperial Army and the Whites was as &#x27;revolutionary&#x27; as their Red counterpart:
James Ryan claims that Lenin never advocated for the physical extermination of the entire bourgeoisie as a class, just the execution of those who were actively involved in opposing and undermining Bolshevik rule. He did intend to bring about &quot;the overthrow and complete abolition of the bourgeoisie&quot; through non-violent political and economic means, but he also noted that in reality the period of transition from capitalism to communism &#x27;is a period of un unprecedentedly violent class struggle in unprecedentedly acute forms, and, consequently, during this period the state must inevitably be a state that is democratic in a new way (for the proletariat and propertyless in general) and dictatorial in a new way (against the bourgeoise)&#x27;.

==Historical significance==

The Red Terror was significant because it was the first of numerous communist terror campaigns which were waged in Soviet Russia and many other countries. It also triggered the Russian Civil War according to historian Richard Pipes. Menshevik Julius Martov wrote about the Red Terror:

The beast has licked hot human blood. The man-killing machine is brought into motion ... But blood breeds blood ... We witness the growth of the bitterness of the civil war, the growing bestiality of men engaged in it.

The term &quot;Red Terror&quot; was later used in reference to other campaigns of violence which were waged by communist or communist-affiliated groups. Some other events which were also called &quot;Red Terrors&quot; include:
* Finnish Red Terror – executions and political violence carried out by the Finnish Reds during the 1918 Civil War in Finland.
* Hungarian Red Terror – executions of up to 590 people accused in counter-revolutionary activities against the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919.
* Red Terror in Bavaria – assassinations of 12 men in the Bavarian Soviet Republic by the Socialist and Communist revolutionaries during the German revolution of 1918–1919.
* Spanish Red Terror – assassinations and actions of violence carried out during the Spanish Civil War by Republican groups.
* Yugoslavian Red Terror – another name for the &quot;Leftist errors&quot;, the period of political violence by the Yugoslav Partisans from 1941 to 1942 in Yugoslavia during its occupation by the Axis.
* Greek Red Terror – a campaign of repression which was waged in Greece by the communist organizations of the Greek resistance (during the Axis occupation of Greece which coincided with World War II) and the Greek Civil War (1943–49).
* Ethiopian Red Terror – a campaign of repression which was waged by the Derg during the rule of Mengistu Haile Mariam.
* Chinese Red Terror – a campaign of repression in Maoist China during the Cultural Revolution which is believed to have begun with the Red August of 1966. According to Mao Zedong himself: &quot;Red terror ought to be our reply to these counter-revolutionaries. We must, especially in the war zones and in the border areas, deal immediately, swiftly with every kind of counter-revolutionary activity.&quot;

<text>The Chiesa di San Giacomo dall&#x27;Orio () (or San Giacomo Apostolo - Saint James the Apostle) is a church located in the &quot;sestiere&quot; (quarter) of Santa Croce in Venice, northern Italy.

The origin of the church&#x27;s name is unknown. Possibilities include being named after a laurel (&quot;lauro&quot;) that once stood nearby, a version of &quot;dal Rio&quot; (&quot;of the river&quot;), or once standing on an area of dried-up swamp (&quot;&quot;). It was founded in the 9th century and rebuilt in 1225. The campanile dates from this period. There have been a number of rebuildings since that time (including a major renovation in 1532) and the ship&#x27;s keel roof dates from the 14th century. Two of the columns were brought back from the Fourth Crusade, after the sacking of Constantinople.

San Giacomo dall&#x27;Orio is a parish church of the Vicariate of San Polo-Santa Croce-Dorsoduro. The other churches in the parish are the churches of San Stae and San Zan Degolà.

San Giacomo dell&#x27;Orio was the parish church of the painter Giambattista Pittoni who was buried there in 1767.

<text>Sex clubs, also known as swinger clubs or lifestyle clubs, are formal or informal groups that organize sex-related activities, or establishments where patrons can engage in sex acts with other patrons. A sex club or swinger club differs from a brothel in that while sex club patrons pay an entrance fee and may pay an annual membership fee, they only have an opportunity to have sex with other patrons, not with sex workers.

==Genres==

A similar type of club is a masturbation club in which members, either single-gender or mixed, masturbate together in public or private rooms. Sexual intercourse is generally prohibited in such clubs.

There is also a very large and growing group of private sex clubs that, to avoid legal problems, do not operate in a specified location. These organizations focus on private parties in homes or rented facilities and make use of the Internet to build their membership. There is usually a small door fee and most are invitation-only. In addition to sexual orientation, these smaller groups often stratify on specific criteria, e.g., men with beards or those who are interested in BDSM and kinks. The first sex club of this type exclusively for African American gay men was Black Jack, started in 1986 by Alan Bell.

Many sex clubs have some form of online presence. Additionally, most adult dating and swinger social networks often provide listings of sex clubs, resorts and events. There is no non-profit impartial overarching organization of sex clubs &quot;per se&quot;, although NASCA International serves as an umbrella organization for swinging groups in general.

== Organizations ==
Most sex clubs cater to the swinging lifestyle. Most major cities in North America and Western Europe have sex clubs, many in a permanent location, but they often keep a low profile. Thousands of swinging clubs are listed on various adult websites and swinger social networks, but there are believed to be many other small neighborhood clubs, which are known among members of the lifestyle community, without a website. The rules of these clubs vary considerably, and admissions are not necessarily limited to married couples.

Most clubs are upscale and professional places that provide a safe place to meet other swingers. There are some differences however among clubs, and one should not confuse swinger clubs with social clubs, swinger groups or Meet-and-Greets. The easiest and simplest way to know the difference between swinger clubs and socials, groups or Meet-n-Greets is that swinger clubs are usually bricks-and-mortar physical locations where people meet other swingers. Socials, groups, and Meet-and-Greets may often meet in the same location, but it is often either a residence or some space that they have secured to meet. However, swinger clubs are typically permanent places that are specifically established for catering to swingers.

One of the biggest differences among clubs is the distinction between &quot;On-Premises&quot; and &quot;Off-Premises&quot; swinger clubs. On-Premises swingers lifestyle clubs are ones that offer rooms or areas that permit couples to engage in sex either alone or with others. Off-Premises clubs are ones that allow for couples to meet and often dance or can socialize, but have no areas or rooms where any sexual activity can occur. Larger establishments may include the facilities of an ordinary nightclub such as a bar and a dance floor. Each club sets the rules for activities which take place at club organized events. Some clubs organize events which cater to heterosexual couples or individuals, others to gay men or (rarely) lesbians, and others have no orientation policy. Some cater to non-conventional activities, such as gang bangs, BDSM or fetish.

Many swinger clubs will have a dozen or more rooms for sexual activity. The lifestyle clubs are also often decorated in themes, with furniture to match. Rooms may be decorated like a tropical oasis to Arabian Nights to caves to rooms with mirrors everywhere. Most clubs will also have voyeur rooms that have windows where patrons can engage in sex and know that they are being watched by other patrons of the club.

Some sex clubs have formal membership and requirements that can include membership fees, showing proof of identity, attending a formal orientation, possibly providing STI test results or showing that one is part of a stable, long-term relationship and is attending with that partner (intended to minimize the number of single males or cheating husbands). Other clubs are open to any person willing to pay an admission fee.

Sex clubs normally do not directly advertise to the general public, but typically rely on their own websites, swinger social networking, vertical integration in the adult entertainment industry, or through affiliate promotions on other adult venues. Many clubs, websites, publications, travel agencies, resorts, and events catering to the lifestyle promote each other to their mutual financial benefit but also with the altruistic intent of encouraging the dissemination of accurate information about the swinging lifestyle.

== Subgroups ==

=== Bisexuality and same-sex activity===
Attitudes to same-sex activity and bisexuality vary by culture and locale, and by gender.

Female bisexuality and bicuriosity are common in swinging and tend to be the norm among participants; Similarly, the online swinger site Swinger Social Network demonstrates that their female membership approximates a 50% population of bisexual females. By contrast, male same-sex activity is usually, though not always, unwelcome. One source, covering &quot;Chicago&#x27;s first and only all bisexual [club],&quot; stated that in the founders&#x27; view &quot;The [swinging] lifestyle is pretty homophobic&quot; and &quot;male bisexuality was erased&quot;, although an &quot;underground market&quot; existed. Swing clubs and other facilities exist for gay and bisexual interests in both genders, but differ – for example bathhouses for gay men, many of which were forced to close because of concerns over AIDS transmission, whereas women&#x27;s clubs are &quot;comparatively rare&quot; and tend to be organized as private events, or niche clubs with high popularity for their events.
=== Selective swinging ===
Most swingers&#x27; clubs do not bar entrance into their facilities based on race, national origin, physical appearance or age. The average swinger is married, professional, middle-class and in their 40s.

However, younger swingers seeking peer group options find this is not always possible at conventional swingers&#x27; clubs because of normal demographics. Similarly, those individuals who seek to specifically exclude others they personally view as unattractive are often disappointed at many swingers&#x27; clubs because the patrons are not screened to their standards. This desire by some has given rise to exclusive parties and clubs that exclude people based on looks or impose an upper age limit.

&#x27;Selective swinging&#x27; or &#x27;urban swinging&#x27; events include mostly childless, unmarried young graduates whose average ages are as low as the late 20s, a group sometimes derided as &quot;Ken and Barbie in the lifestyle&quot; because of the emphasis on youth and physical attractiveness. Selective parties are often derided by other swingers as &quot;exclusive&quot; or &quot;elitist&quot; and contrary to the open and accepting nature that they feel swinging should be about.

==By region==

===United States===
There are hundreds of sex clubs in the United States, ranging from ongoing house parties and meet-up groups to fully licensed businesses. It is estimated that there are over 3,000 swingers lifestyle clubs in North America. Since there is no relevant federal legislation, the legal requirements and legality of such establishments varies from state to state and even from locality to locality. Zoning laws regulating proximity to schools or religious buildings, local norms, and other factors have all played a role. Most sex clubs in the U.S. and Canada do not serve alcohol because of restrictive state requirements associated with a liquor license, but some allow customers to bring their own.

One of the first major &quot;mainstream&quot; sex/swinger clubs in the US was Plato&#x27;s Retreat in NYC. It opened in 1977 and gained some notoriety because celebrities, porn stars, and well-to-do couples attended.

===Canada===
A court ruling in 2005 decriminalizing private sex clubs in Canada has allowed many to open.

===Germany===
In Germany, there were around 340 swinger clubs listed in 2017.
===UK===
Swinging is popular in the UK, with upwards of 150 clubs in existence; these vary from specially designed premises to hotels and leisure clubs that have been adapted to the lifestyle. Some offer accommodation alongside food and beverage to complement the swinging experience. As well as clubs, the UK has many online special interest groups that focus on a particular fetish or aspect of a sexually liberated lifestyle; these groups often hold pop-up events in swingers clubs or private venues. Conservative estimates suggest that there are around 1 million swingers in Britain. The popular social networking swinger site Fab Swingers attract over 25 million hits each month, with 90% being from the UK.

<doc id="746663" wikidata="Q1030389" url="?curid=746663" title="Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni">
<text>is a joint Japan Maritime Self-Defense Forces and United States Marine Corps air station located in the Nishiki river delta, southeast of Iwakuni Station in the city of Iwakuni, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan.

==History==
The Japanese government bought a large portion of what is today MCAS Iwakuni in 1938, with the view of establishing a naval air station. They commissioned the new base on 8 July 1940. When World War II started, the Iwakuni Air Station was used as a training and defense base. The station housed 96 trainers and 150 Zero fighter planes on the airstrip. In September 1943, a branch of the Etajima Naval Academy was established here, with approximately 1,000 cadets undergoing training in the Basic, Junior, and Senior Officer&#x27;s schools at any one time. American B-29&#x27;s bombed Iwakuni in May and August 1945, concentrating on the oil refinery and Rail Transport Office or train station areas. The last air raid took place just a day before the war was brought to a close.

The first allies to reach Iwakuni at the war&#x27;s end were a group of U.S. Marines who had signed papers ending the conflict for the Japanese air base. After the end of World War II, various military forces from the United States, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand occupied the base and it was repaired by No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron RAAF and designated a Royal Australian Air Force Base in 1948. The Americans first occupied the base in 1950 to use it as a springboard for aircraft heading to the Korean War. In 1952, the base officially became a United States military base.
Iwakuni had scheduled international service by private airlines from 1952 to 1964, during which time it had the IATA airport code IWJ. This code was later reassigned to Iwami Airport in neighboring Shimane Prefecture.

Nuclear weapons were moved from Okinawa to the base for storage during a brief period in 1966. When U.S. ambassador to Japan Edwin O. Reischauer learned of the presence of the weapons, which was a violation of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, he told the United States Department of State that if the weapons were not removed within 90 days he would resign and go public with the information. The weapons were removed shortly thereafter, and their presence at the base did not become publicly known until 2010.

It is currently home to around 10,000 United States Marines, sailors, and family members. The base is detailed for Marine pilot training and air patrol, using F/A-18 Hornet fighter-attack aircraft among others in compliance with the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security obligations to protect Japan. MCAS Iwakuni is also shared with the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force. MCAS Iwakuni is home to a Department of Defense school, Matthew C. Perry (Elementary, Middle School, and High School).
A new off-shore runway opened at the base on 30 May 2010. The new runway is 2,440 meters in length.

On 22 November 2017, a C-2A Greyhound cargo plane with 11 crew and passengers aboard crashed southeast of Okinawa after departing the base for the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan. Eight of the 11 were rescued.

On 6 December 2018, a F/A-18D Hornet (callsign &quot;Profane 12&quot;) belonging to VMFA(AW)-242 collided mid-air with a KC-130 (callsign &quot;Sumo 41&quot;) from VMGR-152 during a nighttime training exercise. The crew of Sumo 41 were killed in the collision along with the pilot of Profane 12. The co-pilot of Profane 12 was rescued by JMSDF Search &amp; Rescue in Japanese waters. An investigation into the accident was led by the Marine Corps. ProPublica later conducted their independent investigation after finding the Marine Corps&#x27;s initial results to be inaccurate.

===USN Carrier Air Wing 5 relocation to MCAS Iwakuni===
Since at least 2005 there had been plans to relocate Carrier Air Wing Five&#x27;s fixed wing aircraft from Naval Air Facility Atsugi in Kanagawa Prefecture to Iwakuni. Yamaguchi governor Sekinari Nii said there was &quot;no way&quot; Yamaguchi prefecture would accept this. In 2006 Iwakuni voters rejected the plan in a plebiscite and Iwakuni mayor Katsusuke Ihara urged Tokyo to drop the plan. In 2007 the Japanese government passed legislation to prepare for the relocation of US Forces in Japan including subsidies for local affected areas.

The move was planned to have been done in 2014, but after construction delays the move was delayed by three years, to 2017.

The move did not include the wing&#x27;s two helicopter squadrons. The first CVW-5 squadron, VAW-125 flying the E-2D Hawkeye arrived in January 2017. The Boeing E/A-18G Growlers of VAQ-141 &quot;Shadowhawks&quot; completed relocation in January, 2018. By March 2018, all fixed wing aircraft of Carrier Air Wing 5 had completed relocation from NAF Atsugi.

===USMC F-35B aircraft===
The first aircraft of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 121 &quot;Green Knights&quot; (VMFA-121) arrived on 18 January 2017. This became the first forward deployed F-35B Lightning II squadron in the United States Marine Corps. They have since flown show of force sorties against North Korea.

== Role and operations ==

==Commercial services==
Regular commercial service started from 13 December 2012 with a civilian airport terminal built to accommodate commercial flights. It was initially projected that up to 430,000 passengers would use the airport each year, and in the first seven months of operations the airport handled over 200,000 passengers, with average load factors between Iwakuni and Tokyo exceeding 70% during June 2013.

Since the IATA airport code IWJ, formerly assigned to Iwakuni, was reassigned to Iwami Airport, a new IATA code of IWK was assigned to Iwakuni. The inaugural flight was operated by All Nippon Airways from Haneda Airport. Iwakuni Airport is called by its official nickname &quot;Iwakuni Kintaikyo Airport&quot;, named after the Kintaikyo bridge near the airport. In the future, the airport plans to serve international flights to China and South Korea, as well as more cities within Japan.

<text>Karl Theodor Keim (December 17, 1825 – November 17, 1878) was a German Protestant theologian.

He was born at Stuttgart. His father, Johann Christian Keim, was headmaster of a gymnasium. Here Karl Theodor received his early education, and then proceeded to the Stuttgart Obergymnasium. In 1843 he went to the university of Tübingen, where he studied philosophy under J. F. Reiff, a follower of Hegel, and Oriental languages under Heinrich Ewald and Heinrich Meier. F. C. Baur, the leader of the new Tübingen school, was lecturing on the New Testament and on the history of the church and of dogma, and by him in particular Keim was greatly impressed.

The special bent of Keim&#x27;s mind is seen in his prize essay, &quot;Verhältniss der Christen in den ersten drei Jahrhunderten bis Konstantin zum römischen Reiche&quot; (1847). His first published work was &quot;Die Reformation der Reichstadt Ulm&quot; (1851). In 1850 he visited the University of Bonn, where he attended some of the lectures of Friedrich Bleek, Richard Rothe, C. M. Arndt, and Isaak Dorner. He taught at Tübingen from June 1851 until 1856, when, having become a pastor, he was made deacon at Esslingen am Neckar, in Württemberg.

In 1859 he was appointed archdeacon, but a few months later he was called to the University of Zürich as professor of theology (1859-1873), where he produced his important works. Before this he had written on church history (e.g. &quot;Schwäbische Reformationsgeschichte bis zum Augsburger Reichstag&quot;, 1855). His inaugural address at Zürich on the human development of Jesus, &quot;Die menschliche Entwicklung Jesu Christi&quot; (1861), and his &quot;Die geschichtliche Würde Jesu&quot; (1864) were preparatory to his chief work, &quot;Die Geschichte Jesu von Nazara in ihrer Verkettung mit dem Gesamtleben seines Volkes&quot; (3 volumes, 1867–1872; Eng. trans., &quot;Jesus of Nazareth, and the National Life of Israel&quot;, 6 volumes), 1873–1882. In 1873 Keim was appointed professor of theology at Gießen. This post he resigned, through ill-health, shortly before his death. He belonged to the &quot;mediation&quot; school of theology.

Chief works, besides the above: &quot;Reformationsblätter der Reichsstadt Esslingen&quot; (1860); &quot;Ambrosius Blarer, der Schwäbische Reformator&quot; (1860); &quot;Der Übertritt Konstantins d. Gr. zum Christenthum&quot; (1862); his sermons, &quot;Freundesworte zur Gemeinde&quot; (2 volumes, 1861–1862); and &quot;Celsus&#x27; wahres Wort&quot; (1873). In 1881 H. Ziegler published one of Keim&#x27;s earliest works, &quot;Rom und das Christenthum&quot;, with a biographical sketch.

<doc id="746673" wikidata="Q860167" url="?curid=746673" title="Bicuspid aortic valve">
<text>Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a form of heart disease in which two of the leaflets of the aortic valve fuse during development in the womb resulting in a two-leaflet (bicuspid) valve instead of the normal three-leaflet (tricuspid) valve. BAV is the most common cause of heart disease present at birth and affects approximately 1.3% of adults. Normally, the mitral valve is the only bicuspid valve and this is situated between the heart&#x27;s left atrium and left ventricle. Heart valves play a crucial role in ensuring the unidirectional flow of blood from the atria to the ventricles, or from the ventricle to the aorta or pulmonary trunk. BAV is normally inherited.


== Signs and symptoms ==
In many cases, a bicuspid aortic valve will cause no problems. People with BAV may become tired more easily than those with normal valvular function and have difficulty maintaining stamina for cardio-intensive activities due to poor heart performance caused by stress on the aortic wall.

=== Complications ===

==== Calcification ====
BAV may become calcified later in life, which may lead to varying degrees of severity of aortic stenosis that will manifest as murmurs. If the leaflets do not close correctly, aortic regurgitation can occur. If these become severe enough, they may require heart surgery. The heart is put under more stress in order to either pump more blood through a stenotic valve or attempt to circulate regurgitation blood through a leaking valve. Ultimately there is a risk of rupture in the aortic valve due to bicuspid aortopathy which is a result of progressive aortic dilation from the stress of having only two valve leaflets where three are normal.

==== Aortic lesions ====
One of the most notable associations with BAV is the tendency for these patients to present with ascending aortic aneurysmal lesions.
The extracellular matrix of the aorta in patients with BAV shows marked deviations from that of the normal tricuspid aortic valve, specifically reduced Fibrillin-1.
It is currently believed that an increase in the ratio of MMP2 (Matrix Metalloproteinases 2) to TIMP1 (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase) may be responsible for the abnormal degradation of the valve matrix and therefore lead to aortic dissection and aneurysm. However, other studies have also shown MMP9 involvement with no differences in TIMP expression. The size of the proximal aorta should be evaluated carefully during the workup. The initial diameter of the aorta should be noted and annual evaluation with CT scan, or MRI to avoid ionizing radiation, should be recommended to the patient; the examination should be conducted more frequently if a change in aortic diameter is seen. From this monitoring, the type of surgery that should be offered to the patient can be determined based on the change in size of the aorta.

==== Aortic narrowing ====
A bicuspid aortic valve may cause the heart&#x27;s aortic valve to narrow (aortic stenosis). This narrowing prevents the valve from opening fully, which reduces or blocks blood flow from the heart to the body. In some cases, the aortic valve does not close tightly, causing blood to leak backward into the left ventricle.

Coarctation of the aorta (a congenital narrowing in the region of the ductus arteriosus) has also been associated with BAV.

==Pathophysiology==

Fusion of aortic valve leaflets occurs most commonly (≈80%) between the right coronary and left coronary leaflets (RL), which are the anterior leaflets of the aortic valve. Fusion also occurs between the right coronary and noncoronary leaflets (RN, ≈17%), and least commonly between the noncoronary and left coronary leaflets (≈2%). In comparison to other fusion patterns, RN leaflet fusion has a stronger association with future complications such as aortic valve regurgitation and stenosis. However, all fusion patterns associate with a specific area or areas of dilated enlargement in either the root of the ascending aorta, the ascending aorta, or the transverse aortic arch.

===Hemodynamics===
Identifying hemodynamic patterns in the aorta after left ventricle systole aids in predicting consequential complications of bicuspid aortic valve. The patient-specific risk of developing complications such as aortic aneurysms is dependent on the particular aortic leaflet fusion pattern, with each pattern varying in 4D MRI measurements of wall shear stress (WSS), blood flow velocity, asymmetrical flow displacement and flow angle of the aorta.

BAV outflow is helical and occurs at high velocities (&gt;1 m/s) throughout the ascending aorta. This is potentially more damaging to the aorta in comparison to the streamline flow and short-lived burst of high velocity at the beginning of the aorta, as seen within a healthy tricuspid valve. This eccentric outflow from the BAV results in blood hitting and reflecting off the aortic wall in a non-streamline fashion. The specific zones where blood hits is dependent on the varying BAV leaflet fusion patterns and consequently correlates with increases in WSS. WSS measurements in RL fusion indicate an increase in pressure applied predominantly to the right-anterior side of the vessel wall, while RN fusion increases WSS on the right-posterior wall. The resulting rise in WSS is supported by the asymmetrical displacement of blood flow produced by an increased angle of outflow from the BAV. Displacement is measured as the distance in millimeters from the center of the aorta to the center of the high velocity outflow. Blood does not flow centrally through the aorta in BAV, but along the right-anterior and right-posterior vessel wall for RL and RN leaflet fusion respectively.

===Aortic disease===
Identification of hemodynamics for RL, RN, and left coronary and noncoronary leaflet fusion patterns enables detection of specific aortic regions susceptible to dysfunction and the eventual development of disease. Specifically, RL and RN fusion patterns are more likely to develop into these aortic disease states. The blood flow information associated with RL fusion causes dilation of the mid-ascending aorta, while RN fusion is associated with dilation in the root, distal ascending aorta and transverse arch. BAV helical and high velocity outflow patterns are consistent with aortic dilation hemodynamics seen in those with tricuspid aortic valves. However, it is the increase and variance in WSS and flow displacement in BAV that demonstrate the importance of aortic leaflet morphology. Flow displacement measurements taken from 4D MRI may be best for detecting irregularities in hemodynamics. Displacement measurements were highly sensitive and distinguishable between different valve morphologies. Hemodynamic measurements from 4D MRI in patients with BAV are advantageous in determining the timing and location of repair surgery to the aorta in aortopathy states.

Most patients with bicuspid aortic valve whose valve becomes dysfunctional will need careful follow-up and potentially valve replacement at some point in life. Regular EchoCG and MRI may be performed. If the valve is normally functioning or minimally dysfunctional, average lifespan is similar to that of those without the anomaly.

==Diagnosis==

A bicuspid aortic valve can be associated with a heart murmur located at the right second intercostal space. Often there will be differences in blood pressures between upper and lower extremities. The diagnosis can be assisted with echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Four-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (4D MRI) is a technique that defines blood flow characteristics and patterns throughout the vessels, across valves, and in compartments of the heart. Four-dimensional imaging enables accurate visualizations of blood flow patterns in a three-dimensional (3D) spatial volume, as well as in a fourth temporal dimension. Current 4D MRI systems produces high-resolution images of blood flow in just a single scan session.

===Classification===
Bicuspid aortic valves may assume three different types of configuration:
# &quot;Real&quot; bicuspid valves with two symmetric leaflets
# A tricuspid architecture with a fusion of two leaflets
# A tricuspid architecture with a fusion of three leaflets

== Treatment ==
Complications stemming from structural heart issues are most often treated through surgical intervention, which could include aortic valve replacement, or balloon valvuloplasty.

==Prognosis==
BAV leads to significant complications in over one-third of affected individuals. Notable complications of BAV include narrowing of the aortic valve opening, backward blood flow at the aortic valve, dilation of the ascending aorta, and infection of the heart valve.

If aortic regurgitation and dilation of the ascending aorta are noted in someone, they should undergo yearly surveillance with transthoracic echocardiograms if the aortic root measures 4.5 centimeters or greater in diameter.

==Epidemiology==
Bicuspid aortic valves are the most common cardiac valvular anomaly, occurring in 1–2% of the general population. It is twice as common in males as in females.

Bicuspid aortic valve is a heritable condition, with a demonstrated association with mutations in the NOTCH1 gene. Its heritability (formula_1) is as high as 89%. Both familial clustering and isolated valve defects have been documented. Recent studies suggest that BAV is an autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetrance. Other congenital heart defects are associated with bicuspid aortic valve at various frequencies, including coarctation of the aorta.

Bicuspid aortic valve abnormality is also the most observed cardiac defect in Turner syndrome.

<doc id="746681" wikidata="Q353917" url="?curid=746681" title="Mark Rypien">
<text>Mark Robert Rypien (born October 2, 1962) is a Canadian-American former professional football quarterback for 14 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Washington State Cougars and was selected by the Washington Redskins in the sixth round of the 1986 NFL draft. He was the first Canadian-born quarterback to both start in the NFL and be named Super Bowl MVP, doing so in Super Bowl XXVI with the Redskins. He also played for several other NFL teams. His nephew Brett plays in the NFL for the Minnesota Vikings.

==Early life==
Born in Calgary, Alberta on October 2, 1962, Rypien&#x27;s family moved to the United States when he was three, settling in Spokane, Washington. He was a star three-sport athlete at Shadle Park High School. All three of his varsity numbers (football, basketball, and baseball) were later retired by the school.

He earned Parade All-American honors as a high school senior and received scholarship offers from across the country before accepting a football scholarship to Washington State University in Pullman, and joined the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. A knee injury in spring drills in 1982 redshirted him for that season and he nearly left football and WSU in November 1983 but stayed and earned first-team All-Pac-10 honors in 1984 and led WSU&#x27;s fabled RPM offense in 1985. He was inducted into WSU&#x27;s Athletics Hall of Fame in 1993. He played in the 1986 Senior Bowl.

==Professional career==

===Washington Redskins===
Rypien was selected by the Washington Redskins in the sixth round (146th overall) of the 1986 NFL draft. He spent his first two years as a professional on the injured reserved list, first with a bad knee in 1986, then a bad back in 1987. He watched from the sidelines as the Redskins won Super Bowl XXII under coach Joe Gibbs in January 1988 behind the quarterbacking of veteran Doug Williams.

Rypien became the second stringer after Jay Schroeder, who lost his job to Williams late in the 1987 season, was traded to the Los Angeles Raiders. In Week 4 against the newly relocated Phoenix Cardinals, Rypien got his first chance to start for an injured Williams and threw for 303 yards and two touchdowns in a 30–21 loss. In six starts, he went 3–3 and he appeared in nine games overall, including a four-touchdown game in a rematch against the Cardinals. He threw for 1,730 yards in those games and finished with three more touchdowns than Williams had, by a count of 18–15.

Rypien was named the starter for 1989 ahead of the injured and aging Williams, Rypien emerged as a star quarterback as he threw for 3,768 yards with 22 touchdowns and led the Redskins to a 10–6 record. The team missed the playoffs but Rypien received a bid as an injury replacement for Joe Montana and Don Majkowski in that year&#x27;s Pro Bowl (NFC coach John Robinson elected to bring only one injury replacement for his intended starter and #2 quarterback).

Rypien was best known for his phenomenal accuracy as a deep passer. He made the Pro Bowl in his first full season as a starter, doing so as an injury replacement.

The 1991 season was Rypien&#x27;s best: he threw for 3,564 yards and 28 touchdowns with 11 interceptions, leading the Redskins to Super Bowl XXVI after recording a 14–2 regular season record. He was named the MVP (Most Valuable Player) of the game, passing for 292 yards and 2 touchdowns and leading his team to a 37–24 win over the Buffalo Bills. Rypien, a native of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, became the first foreign-born player to earn the honor. Rypien was named to the Pro Bowl in both 1989 and 1991.

Rypien was one of several players to benefit from the team&#x27;s success following their championship season. The Redskins signed him to a 3-year, $9 million deal entering the 1992 season. However, the team battled age and injuries and finished the regular season with a 9–7 record, barely making the playoffs. His passing yardage was a respectable 3,282 yards, but his passer rating fell from 97.9 in 1991 to 71.7 in 1992 and his interceptions outnumbered his touchdowns 17–13. Although a dominant team performance in the playoffs brought victory over the Minnesota Vikings in an NFC Wild Card away game, the Redskins eventually lost on a rainy, muddy field in a bruising game vs. the San Francisco 49ers, and the Rypien era was essentially over. Under new head coach Richie Petitbon, Rypien had his best training camp in 1993 and expectations were high following a Monday Night win over the defending Super Bowl Champion Dallas Cowboys. However, Rypien injured his knee in Week 2 against the Arizona Cardinals and the team began a precipitous slide toward a 4–12 season finish.

When he was healthy enough to return, Rypien performed spot duty, sharing time with the newly acquired Rich Gannon. The Redskins hired Norv Turner as their head coach in 1994. Rypien participated in offseason workouts, but the team later released him.

===Cleveland Browns===
On May 11, 1994, Rypien signed with the Cleveland Browns to backup Vinny Testaverde. He played in six games for the Browns that year, starting three of them. In those three games he went 2–1, including a 26–7 win over the Eagles.

===St. Louis Rams (first stint)===
On May 6, 1995, Rypien signed with the St. Louis Rams, this time to backup Chris Miller. He started the final three games of the season, going 0–3 in that span to finish a disappointing season for the team. He had his best performance against the Buffalo Bills in his first start where he went 31 of 55 for 372 yards and two touchdowns despite the team&#x27;s 45–27 loss to Jim Kelly.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
On October 3, 1996, Rypien signed with the Philadelphia Eagles due to an injury to starter Rodney Peete. His last NFL touchdown pass came in relief of Eagles quarterback Ty Detmer, an 8-yarder to Irving Fryar with five seconds remaining in a 37–10 loss to the Indianapolis Colts.

===St. Louis Rams (second stint)===
On March 4, 1997, Rypien re-signed with the Rams. He played in five games and did not score any touchdowns.

=== Atlanta Falcons ===
He signed with the Atlanta Falcons for the 1998 season but never played in Atlanta. His son&#x27;s death from a malignant brain tumor that August caused Rypien to retire.

===Indianapolis Colts===
After a three-year hiatus, Rypien unretired and signed with the Indianapolis Colts on August 1, 2001. He would appear in four games for the Colts. He made his first appearance in week three against the New England Patriots in relief of Peyton Manning. He would attempt his only passes of the season that game going five of nine for 57 yards in the 44–13 loss.

=== Seattle Seahawks ===
On August 19, 2002, Rypien signed with the Seattle Seahawks to be the backup for Matt Hasselbeck and Trent Dilfer. He played in two preseason games and finished 13 of 21 passing for 97 yards, but was ultimately cut on September 3, 2002.

=== Rochester Raiders ===
Rypien&#x27;s last professional game was on June 10, 2006; as part of a promotional gig for the Rochester Raiders of the Great Lakes Indoor Football League (GLIFL).

In 11 NFL seasons, Rypien completed 1,466 of 2,613 passes for 18,473 yards, 115 touchdowns, and 88 interceptions. He rushed 127 times for 166 yards and 8 touchdowns.

==NASCAR==

Rypien had a brief stint in NASCAR racing as a team owner, and was the original owner of the 2004 Nextel Cup championship-winning No. 97 team driven by Kurt Busch, having sold it to Jack Roush&#x27;s Roush Racing in 1997.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Personal life==
On June 8, 2006, Rypien was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.

Rypien&#x27;s cousins include NHL players Rick Rypien and Shane Churla, and his nephew is NFL quarterback Brett Rypien.

Rypien&#x27;s daughter, Angela, played in the 2011 season for the Seattle Mist of the Lingerie Football League.

An avid golfer, Rypien has been known to participate in charity tournaments at various locations across the nation. He has played in one PGA Tour event (Kemper Open in 1992), and one Web.com Tour event (Buy.com Tri-Cities Open in 2000), and missed the 36-hole cut by a substantial margin both times.

He has been a regular competitor at the American Century Championship, the annual competition at Lake Tahoe to determine the best golfers among American sports and entertainment celebrities. Rypien won the inaugural event in 1990, and won his second crown 24 years later in 2014; he has a total of 11 top ten finishes. Televised by NBC in July, the tournament is played at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course in Stateline, Nevada.

In a 2018 interview with the Spokane &quot;Spokesman-Review&quot;, Rypien&#x27;s wife stated that she believes he is suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) from football, with bizarre behavior occurring from time to time. Rypien himself confirmed that he has struggled with mental health issues since his retirement from football, even attempting suicide by overdosing on pills before his wife stopped him. On June 30, 2019, he was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with fourth-degree assault. The charge was dismissed on August 30, 2019.

In 2020, he was featured in the documentary &quot;Quiet Explosions: Healing the Brain&quot; produced and directed by Jerri Sher.

<doc id="746699" wikidata="Q1927465" url="?curid=746699" title="Michael Freund (historian)">
<text>Michael Freund (1902–1972) was a German historian and professor at the University of Kiel.

Freund&#x27;s view was that Louis Napoleon was the only real revolutionist in 1848. Freund wrote, &quot;After the solemn republican respectability of 1848 it seemed that only with the Napoleonic experiment did a great revolutionary élan appear on the stage of history&quot;. &quot;The state created by Napoleon was anti-socialist, but it was not the laissez-faire state of capitalism. The social ideals of the disciples of Saint-Simon were given by Napoleon, for the first time, a military and authoritarian aspect.&quot;

<doc id="746702" wikidata="Q1381580" url="?curid=746702" title="Ithala Game Reserve">
<text>Ithala Game Reserve is situated in 290 km2 of rugged, mountainous thornveld, about 400 km north of Durban, in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It is one of the youngest game parks in South Africa. The altitude varies from 400 m along the Phongolo River to 1,450 m along the Ngotshe Mountain escarpment. The reserve consequently encompasses a great variation of terrain, from densely vegetated river valleys and lowveld to sourveld, high-lying grassland plateaus, mountain ridges and cliff faces.

==Game==
Grazers include impala, red hartebeest, tsessebe, blue wildebeest, eland and reedbuck. With the exception of reedbuck, these species have been observed to produce young seasonally around November to December in Ithala, when ample green forage is available. The browsers include duiker, bushbuck, nyala, kudu, giraffe and zebra, which deliver their young at any time of the year.

===Reintroductions===
All the big game species have been re-established with the exception of lion. Locally extinct red-billed oxpeckers were reintroduced from the Kruger Park, c. 1994, when 175 birds were released.

==Plants==
This reserve is likely the only place in KwaZulu-Natal where the rare tree &quot;Protea comptonii&quot; grows.

== History ==
* In the late 1800s land was given by King Dinizulu to boer farmers.
* In 1973 the then Natal Parks Board started buying up farms in this area to make up this Reserve.

== Trivia ==
* There are two abandoned gold mines in Ithala.

<text>Adrianne Therese León (born March 15, 1987) is an American singer-songwriter and actress. She is the co-founder and lead vocalist of the rock band Caught Crimson. León began her career writing songs for the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; and went on to have a role as the punk rock teen Brook Lynn Ashton, which earned her a Daytime Emmy nomination and a Soap Opera Digest Award. She left the show for the CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, where she took over the role of Colleen Carlton.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Adrianne León was born in San Diego, California; she is of Ecuadorian and Puerto Rican descent and lived in Ecuador as a child. After moving to the US, León began modeling and performing. After completing the seventh grade, she was homeschooled by her mother and then rapidly advanced through high school. She is a member of the ASCAP and AFTRA.

===Career===
León voiced over a Glamma Jammas commercial and was also in a public service announcement for Vons, a supermarket chain.

León was hired in 2002 to write songs alongside Rick Krizman for the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. In 2003, she performed two songs for the documentary &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Magical Island: Catalina&quot;: &quot;Everlasting Dream&quot; and &quot;She Heals You&quot;. She formed Caught Crimson with the help of Murray Yates, lead vocalist of the Canadian rock band Forty Foot Echo. León later recruited former Artension bassist Kevin Chown, former Alien Ant Farm guitarist Terry Corso, and former Forty Foot Echo drummer Rob Kurzretier. She provided vocals for a Glamma Jammas commercial song titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Me Started&quot;, written and produced by Kendall Marsh. She also sang &quot;Favor Me&quot; and &quot;Falling In&quot;, both written and produced by Jody Whitesides. On October 4, 2003, Adrianne León performed at the California Avocado Festival and on August 23, 2003, she played at the Aloha Festival, where she opened for Dishwalla. Both festivals were held in Carpinteria, California.

In May 2004, León was cast as the feisty and rebellious teen Brook Lynn Ashton in the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. She portrayed the character as a talented punk rock singer and songwriter who constantly fights against her mother Lois Cerullo&#x27;s pressure to become a rock star. Léon was named &quot;Outstanding Performer of the Week&quot; of September 13, 2004, by &quot;Soap Opera Weekly&quot; for her performance. The role earned her a Soap Opera Digest Award for &quot;Outstanding Female Newcomer&quot; as well as a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for &quot;Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series&quot; later in 2005.

She also guest-starred on the ABC prime-time sitcom &quot;Hot Properties&quot; as the young music VJ Courtney alongside Harry Hamlin, as his much younger fiancée. In early 2006, León took over the role of Colleen Carlton on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

She returned as the character Brook Lynn Ashton in &quot;General Hospital&quot; on May 21, 2010. She was on the show until April 2011, when the character was written off. León told &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; in August 2019 that she would love to return to &quot;General Hospital&quot; to reprise the role someday. In November 2019, Amanda Setton debuted in the role of Brook Lynn.

<text>The JMA Wireless Dome, originally the Carrier Dome (1980–2022), is a domed stadium in Syracuse, New York, United States. Located on the campus of Syracuse University in the University Hill neighborhood, it is home to the Syracuse Orange football, basketball, and lacrosse teams. In 2006–07, the women&#x27;s basketball team began playing home games in the Carrier Dome. In May 2022, Syracuse University announced in April 2022 that Carrier Global Corp. would no longer hold naming rights to the venue. When Syracuse University and JMA Wireless announced the new naming rights in May 2022, it marked the first time the venue&#x27;s name would change since the opening in 1980.

Since its opening in September 1980, the Syracuse men&#x27;s basketball team has led the NCAA in average attendance 16 times and holds the NCAA records for highest total home court attendance in a season (537,949, 1990), highest average home court attendance in a season (29,918, 1989), and the largest home court single game attendance (35,642, vs. Duke, 2019).

The JMA Wireless Dome is the largest domed stadium of any college campus, and the largest domed stadium in the northeastern United States. It is also the largest on-campus basketball arena in the nation, with a listed capacity of 35,642. In addition, the venue hosts high school football state championships, the annual New York State Field Band Conference championships, and occasional concerts.

==History==
Toward the end of the 1970s, Syracuse University was under pressure to improve its football facilities in order to remain a Division I-A football school. Its on-campus stadium, Archbold Stadium, opened in 1907 and had not aged well. The stadium could not be expanded; earlier in the decade the capacity of the stadium had been reduced from 40,000 seats to 26,000 due to stricter enforcement of fire codes. Therefore, the university decided to build a new stadium on the site of Archbold, which, appropriately for the region&#x27;s often cold weather, was to have a domed Teflon-coated, fiberglass inflatable roof.

Because it was built in-season in 1979 on the previous stadium&#x27;s site, Syracuse played &quot;home&quot; games at three different locations—New Jersey&#x27;s Giants Stadium, home of the National Football League&#x27;s New York Giants; Rich Stadium, home of the Buffalo Bills; and Schoellkopf Field, home of the Cornell Big Red. When it opened in September 1980, it was made clear just how loud it was inside; that night the new stadium&#x27;s nickname, &quot;the Loud House&quot;, was coined. The original inflatable roof, since replaced by a fixed roof, caused the sound produced to echo many times, multiplying the loudness produced inside.

The stadium also became the home of the men&#x27;s basketball team, as a replacement for Manley Field House.

===Dedications===
In 2002, the basketball court was dedicated to Jim Boeheim, the longtime head coach of the men&#x27;s basketball team.

In 2009, the field turf was dedicated to Ernie Davis, the first African American Heisman Trophy winner, in 1961. The field now reads &quot;Ernie Davis Legends Field&quot; between the 45-yard lines on the home side. Davis&#x27;s number 44 was also placed along that yard line. The dedication took place during the game against West Virginia on October 10.

==Financing==
The Carrier Dome was constructed between April 1979 and September 1980. The total construction cost was $26.85 million, including a $2.75 million naming gift from the Carrier Corporation. It was speculated at the time that political considerations helped this project advance. The State of New York provided a $15 million grant in 1978 for the Carrier Dome&#x27;s construction. Democratic incumbent Governor Hugh Carey was thought to have trouble in his re-election campaign with upstate voters. He visited the site of the old Archbold stadium and was convinced by local officials and SU administrators on the utility of a dome. Carey won re-election to a second term following the approval of state funds, although the extent to which it helped him is unknown.

==Design==
===Construction===
Huber, Hunt and Nichols, Inc. was the general contractor and Birdair Structure Inc. was in charge of construction of the inflatable roof. The original 220-ton roof was supported by sixteen diameter fans, each capable of generating of air movement per minute, located in mechanical rooms on the north and south sides of the building. The fans directed over one million cubic feet of air per minute upward through the Dome&#x27;s 36 main columns and under the roof. To avoid the accumulation of snow, air heated to was pumped into the dead air space between the two layers of its roof to melt any snow before it could accumulate. The project involved more than 80 companies and transformed of concrete and 880 tons of steel into the fifth largest domed stadium in the United States at the time of completion.

===Renovations===
The Dome has been upgraded several times throughout the past 25 years. The inflatable roof was replaced in 1999 at a cost of $14 million; university officials sought to replace the inflatable roof with a cable-supported roof similar to the Georgia Dome but was ruled out due to costs and the time-frame needed for construction. FieldTurf was installed at the beginning of the 2005 football season, replacing the outdated AstroTurf. Additionally, the Dome received orange paint and banners between its decks, and its corridors were lined with historic photographs. In 2012, the university installed large end zone video displays, a 360-degree LED ribbon display, and an upgraded play clock.


In May 2018, the university announced a major renovation to the Carrier Dome as the central portion of a larger campus update. The renovation, estimated to cost $118 million, was expected to be completed in 2022. The most significant changes are the replacement of the original air-supported roof with a fixed roof, two-thirds of which is translucent, along with the installation of air conditioning. The new roof was designed and engineered by Geiger Engineers - the same firm that was the structural engineer for the original stadium. The new roof was finished in September 2020; air conditioning was added for some spaces in 2020 and was completed in 2021. The upgrade also included a new scoreboard (that will be center hung over the football field and can be moved to be over the basketball court), new lighting and sound systems, Wi-Fi improvements, accessibility upgrades, improved restrooms, and new concession spaces. Unlike the original air-supported roof, the new roof does not require snow removal during winter storms. The new roof is also expected to make the Dome a more viable venue for major concerts; the original air-supported roof required the stadium have air locks, making it difficult to move equipment in and out. The high-profile renovation project was named a winner of NCSEA&#x27;s 2021 Excellence in Structural Engineering Award for Forensic / Renovation / Retrofit / Rehabilitation Structures over $20 Million

The school announced the next phase of its work to enhance, elevate and expand the stadium experience in April 2022. This included an upgrade of the entire digital infrastructure, including latest 5G technology and wireless connectivity. In December 2022, the university announced the next phase of its work towards enhanced stadium experience, which will include a complete replacement of benches with individual seats; a construction of a new publicly accessible event facility adjacent to the Dome; and an upgrade of the entire digital infrastructure. This phase two work will begin in spring 2023 following Commencement and will be completed ahead of the 2024 football season.

===Naming rights===
The stadium was initially called the Carrier Dome, after the Carrier Corporation, who had a manufacturing campus in the area, gave the university $2.75 million naming rights grant towards its completion in 1979. This gift represented the first naming agreement for a college sports stadium and one of the first in all of sports.

On May 19, 2022, Syracuse University announced the signing of a 10-year naming rights deal of the iconic on-campus stadium with locally based networking equipment manufacturer JMA Wireless, ending its 42-year deal with Carrier. For the first time since the venue opened its doors in 1980, the stadium had a new name, only the second in its history—the JMA Wireless Dome, referred to as the JMA Dome.

==Accessibility and transportation==
The JMA Wireless Dome is served by CENTRO buses. Shuttle buses transport fans to and from remote parking lots. Dedicated drop-off and pickup points for ride-hailing apps are maintained during game times.

OnTrack, the city&#x27;s suburban rail line, served the Dome via its Syracuse University-Carrier Dome Station from 1994 to 2008. Service north to Armory Square and Destiny USA was offered year round, and south to Jamesville Beach seasonally. On game days, a special &quot;Orange Express&quot; service was offered.

==Notable events==

===Attendance records===
Syracuse University&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball per-game and single-season attendance numbers are annual contenders for the top rank in the nation. Lacrosse crowds are not as large, but the venue allows Syracuse&#x27;s lacrosse teams to play home games throughout the February–May regular season. During the construction, Athletic Director Jake Crouthamel, to much protest from basketball head coach Jim Boeheim, decided to install a basketball court underneath the turf subsurface. This change, along with creation of the Big East conference, catapulted the attendance from around 9000 at Manley Field House to routinely topping 30,000, making the program NCAA leader in attendance for 11 consecutive seasons starting in 1985.

The Carrier/JMA Wireless Dome has seen many of NCAA basketball&#x27;s largest crowds. On February 1, 2014, the attendance record for an NCAA men&#x27;s basketball on-campus game was broken by a few hundred spectators in the Duke vs. Syracuse ACC matchup. Attendance was announced as 35,446, as Syracuse went on to win 91–89, in dramatic fashion in overtime. This win marked the 21st straight win of the season for the Orange, breaking a school record for the longest unbeaten streak to start a season. The previous attendance record was set February 23, 2013 (35,012), the final game vs. long-standing Big East Conference rivals Georgetown Hoyas, as a member of the Big East. The Orange were defeated 57–46, ending the Orange&#x27;s home win-streak at 38 games. Prior to the Georgetown Hoyas attendance record, Syracuse University held the previous attendance record also. On February 27, 2010, an announced attendance of 34,616 came to see the Orange beat the Villanova Wildcats 95–77. University officials briefly considered moving the basketball court to the middle of the football field for the 2014 regular season game with Duke- a move that could have pushed the attendance over 50,000. It was decided, to appease season ticket holders, that the court would stay in its usual location. However, the university did reconfigure the stadium to hold a new record capacity of 35,446.


For the 2018–19 season, Syracuse modified the stadium&#x27;s basketball configuration to allow a maximum crowd of 35,642, and on February 23, 2019, the Orange drew that exact number for the visit of then top-ranked Duke, setting a new single-game record for on-campus college basketball attendance. This number ultimately surpassed the entire regular-season home attendance of 180 different NCAA Division I men&#x27;s teams in that same season—more than half of the 353 teams that played in Division I.

On March 19, 2007, a new NIT attendance record was set, at 26,752, in the second-round men&#x27;s basketball game against the San Diego State University Aztecs.

On November 22, 2014, the Syracuse Crunch of the American Hockey League set a new &quot;United States Indoor Professional Hockey&quot; record by playing in front of 30,715 fans at the Carrier Dome for the &quot;Toyota Frozen Dome Classic&quot;. Syracuse defeated the Utica Comets 2–1. The (SUNY) Oswego State Lakers also hosted a game against the Utica Pioneers, establishing an NCAA record attendance for a Division III hockey game at 7,074 fans. Oswego tied Utica with a final score of 4-4.

===Tournaments===
The 1981 Big East Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament was held there, as were the 1988 and 1991 Division I NCAA Men&#x27;s Lacrosse Championships. The Men&#x27;s NCAA basketball tournament East Regional semi-finals and finals have been held at the JMA Wireless Dome seven times (1983, 1997, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2010, and 2015). The NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships were held there in 1984 and 1985.

===Performing artists===
Artists who have performed at the stadium include Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Chainsmokers, Paul McCartney, Prince, Bon Jovi, David Bowie, Van Halen, Elton John, Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen, Garth Brooks, Rod Stewart, U2, Genesis, the Rolling Stones, The Police, Frank Sinatra, the Who, Neil Diamond, Kid Cudi, Kanye West, Grateful Dead, Metallica, Santana, Duran Duran, Kenny Chesney, Ludacris, Rick Ross, Meek Mill, Taylor Swift, Pink Floyd, Zac Brown Band, Macklemore Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis, Kesha, Kaskade, 50 Cent, Trey Songz, Drake, and Travis Scott among others.

===Other events===

The March 28, 1981, WBC world Welterweight boxing championship contest between champion Sugar Ray Leonard and challenger Larry Bonds, won by Leonard by tenth-round technical knockout, was held at the Carrier Dome, as the main event of a program that also featured Tony Ayala Jr., Bernard Taylor, Alex Ramos and future world champions Johnny Bumphus and Davey Moore.

On August 23, 1981, the Carrier Dome hosted an NFL exhibition game between the New Orleans Saints and the Philadelphia Eagles.

Each October, the stadium hosts the New York State Field Band Conference marching band championships. It also hosts the New York State High School Football Championships each November. A Billy Graham crusade took place at the JMA Wireless Dome in 1989. WWE have held numerous wrestling events at the JMA Wireless Dome going back to their WWF days. Since 2011, the stadium has been a stop on Monster Jam&#x27;s stadium tour schedule.

On October 14, 2014, the Carrier Dome held an NBA preseason game between the New York Knicks and Philadelphia 76ers, which was a homecoming for the latter team, as they originated in Syracuse as the Nationals, departing Central New York in 1963.

On November 22, 2014, the Syracuse Crunch and Utica Comets hosted an American Hockey League game inside the Carrier Dome as part of the &quot;Frozen Dome Classic&quot;, which served as the 2014–15 edition of the AHL Outdoor Classic. This event was part of a day-long hockey event that also included the Utica College Pioneers and Oswego State Lakers, both based in NCAA Division III. Also, the cities of Syracuse and Utica participated in a law enforcement charity game.

The New York Mets conducted a pre-season practice at the Carrier Dome on March 26, 2019. It was the first baseball event staged at the Carrier Dome.

The stadium has also been used as a large classroom as well as for academic research projects.

==Accidents==
The Carrier Dome has also been the site of a fatal accident. In June 1999, worker Bryan Bowman was killed when he fell through the dome roof to the bleachers below. He had been working with a crew from Birdair Incorporated, to replace the roof. The next month an electrician named Dave Paduana fell down a shaft while installing cables for a new speaker system. He survived with injuries to his leg, arm, back and ribs.

<doc id="746720" wikidata="Q1031547" url="?curid=746720" title="Marine Corps Air Station Futenma">
<text>is a United States Marine Corps base located in Ginowan, Okinawa, Japan, northeast of Naha, on the island of Okinawa. It is home to approximately 3,000 Marines of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing and other units, and has been a U.S. military airbase since the defeat of the Japanese Imperial Army in the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. Marine Corps pilots and aircrew are assigned to the base for training and providing air support to other land and sea-based Marines in Okinawa and throughout the Asia-Pacific region. MCAS Futenma is part of the Marine Corps Installations Pacific command.

MCAS Futenma is situated in Ginowan City (pop. 93,661). The base includes a runway at 75 meters elevation, as well as extensive barracks, administrative and logistical facilities. The air station is tasked with operating a variety of fixed wing, rotary wing and tilt rotor aircraft in support of the III Marine Expeditionary Force, the Japan U.S. defense alliance and many allies and treaty partners in the region. The base is also used as a United Nations air distribution hub facility for response to disaster or other crisis requiring air supplies, due to the length of the runway and elevation.

==History==
Futenma Airfield was constructed by the US military following the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. According to Ginowan City records, the joint population of what was then Ginowan Village (now Ginowan City) was 12,994 in 1944. It was initially allocated for Eighth Air Force use to station B-29 Superfortress strategic bombers in the planned Invasion of Japan. With the end of the war, the airfield became a United States Air Force Far East Air Force installation known as Futenma Air Base, and was used as a support airfield for the nearby Kadena Air Base, hosting fighter-interceptor squadrons as part of the air defense of the Ryukyu Islands. The base was transferred to the United States Navy on 30 June 1957 and was subsequently developed into a United States Marine Corps air station by Seabees from USN Mobile Construction Battalion 3 augmented by a detachment from MCB 2. When the Seabees were done they had also made facilities on the base for Navy Communications Unit 37 Futenma to transfer from Kadena. In 1957 the name changed to Naval Security Group Activity Futenma and changed again in 1960 to Naval Security Group Hanza. The group decommissioned on Futenma in 1999.

Each year, MCAS Futenma opens its gates for the Futenma Flight Line Fair, which includes U.S. band performances, entertainment, static displays of all aircraft, military vehicles and demonstrations.
==Capability==

Futenma&#x27;s 75 m elevation provides a safe and effective location to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations in the event of a tsunami, which would render the sea-level Naha international airport inoperable. The 9,000 ft (2,743.2 m) runway also gives the capability of safely landing the largest commercial and military cargo planes in the world, including the Antonov An-124 Ruslan, which has landed at Futenma multiple times. Futenma has a high record of safety with well established procedures.

==Community==
The airbase has become a focal point of various political controversies in recent years. Due to population growth and encroachment around the base, concerns surrounding flights over residential areas causing noise, air pollution and endangering public safety also became controversial issues in Ginowan City, as the airport is surrounded all around by residential areas, very similar to Hong Kong&#x27;s old airport before relocation in 1998. Safety concerns were raised after the August 2004 crash of a Marine Corps CH-53D transport helicopter on the campus of Okinawa International University after the aircraft suffered mechanical issues. Three crew members had minor injuries, but there were no injuries on the ground. &quot;The Guardian&quot; has stated that the location of MCAS Futenma in Ginowan &quot;would be like having F22s landing in Hyde Park [in London].&quot;
Local residents also became concerned over pollution and ground water and soil contamination caused by the base&#x27;s activities: for example, Lt. Col. (Ret.) Kris Roberts (USMC) told &quot;The Japan Times&quot; that his base maintenance team unearthed leaking barrels of Agent Orange at the base in 1981. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) states that Agent Orange was never present on Okinawa, and an investigation commissioned by the DoD found no evidence that Agent Orange was ever on Okinawa (See Agent Orange: Okinawa, Japan for more details.) In 2019, high levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were found in the waters near the installation as well as in Ginowan residents&#x27; blood but the USMC did not grant permission to Okinawa Prefectural authorities to inspect the base.
Special interest groups, including supporters and protestors, often gather outside the gates of Futenma. Local Okinawan citizens clean vandalism and debris left by protest groups weekly.

Mayor Atsushi Sakima of Ginowan City and Col. James G. Flynn, commanding officer of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, signed a bilateral agreement 26 June 2013 at MCAS Futenma specifying procedures for the evacuation of Okinawa residents in the event a natural disaster and provisions for evacuation drills to maintain readiness. Immediately before, during or following a natural disaster, especially a tsunami, MCAS Futenma can use the procedures to open one or more of the station&#x27;s gates to allow evacuees immediate and direct passage to higher ground or shelter. This agreement comes after thorough collaboration between Ginowan City and MCAS Futenma and signifies the importance that the city and air station place on mutual safety and cooperation, said officials.

The base, along with its impact on families living nearby and local cultural heritage, are the subject of the short story collection &quot;To Futenma&quot; by Okinawan author Tatsuhiro Oshiro.

==Relocation==
There have been various plans to relocate Marine Corps Air Station Futenma base—first off the island and then within the island—however, the future of any relocation is uncertain with the election of base-opponent Onaga as Okinawa governor. Onaga won against the incumbent Nakaima who had earlier approved landfill work to move the base to Camp Schwab in Henoko. However, Onaga has promised to veto the landfill work needed for the new base to be built and insisted Futenma should be moved outside of Okinawa. In August 2015, the Japanese government agreed to halt construction activities temporarily while talks with Okinawan officials continued. US sources insist nothing about their approach has changed.

<text>Kohl&#x27;s (stylized in all caps) is an American department store retail chain, operated by Kohl&#x27;s Corporation. It currently has 1,165 locations, operating stores in every U.S. state except Hawaii. The company was founded by Polish immigrant Maxwell Kohl, who opened a corner grocery store in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1927. It went on to become a successful chain in the local area, and in 1962 the company branched out by opening its first department store. British American Tobacco Company took a controlling interest in the company in 1972 while still managed by the Kohl Family, and in 1979, the corporation was sold to BATUS Inc. A group of investors purchased the company in 1986 from British American Tobacco and took it public in 1992.

Kohl&#x27;s is headquartered in the Milwaukee suburb of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. It became the largest department store chain in the United States in May 2012, surpassing its competitor JCPenney. The company is listed on both the S&amp;P 400 and the Fortune 500. In terms of revenue, the chain was the 23rd-largest retailer in the United States in 2019.

As of January 2025, the CEO of Kohl&#x27;s is Ashley Buchanan. He replaced Tom Kingsbury, who had been CEO since replacing Michelle Gass in 2022. Kingsbury will remain in an Executive Advisory Role and keep a Board Seat until his retirement in May 2025.

==History==
Maxwell Kohl, who had operated traditional grocery stores since 1927, built his first supermarket in 1946, the first in what would become a southeastern Wisconsin chain known as Kohl&#x27;s Food Stores. In September 1962, after building Kohl&#x27;s Food Stores into the largest supermarket chain in the Milwaukee area, Kohl opened his first department store in Brookfield, Wisconsin. He positioned Kohl&#x27;s between the higher-end department stores and the discounters, selling everything from candy to engine oil to sporting equipment.

In 1972, the British American Tobacco Company&#x27;s U.S. retail division, Batus Inc., bought a controlling interest in Kohl&#x27;s Corporation, which at the time operated 50 grocery stores, six department stores, three drug stores, and three liquor stores. The Kohl family, led by Allen Kohl and Herb Kohl, continued to manage the company. Herb Kohl left the management in 1979, eventually becoming a United States senator and owner of the Milwaukee Bucks. The firm then expanded Kohl&#x27;s presence from 10 to 39 stores in Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana. The grocery stores were sold to A&amp;P in 1983, operating under the name Kohl&#x27;s Food Store, and later Kohl&#x27;s Food Emporium. In February 2003, A&amp;P put the Kohl&#x27;s Food Stores up for sale, as part of an effort to reduce debt. That same year, A&amp;P closed all Kohl&#x27;s Food Stores locations and the Kohl family left remaining management.

A group of investors, led by the senior management, purchased the company in 1986. Building on the existing 40 department stores, the company added 27 more stores over the next two years. In 1988, the chain acquired 26 locations from the Chicago-based retailer MainStreet, gaining several stores in Chicago&#x27;s suburbs, the Twin Cities, and Michigan. Kohl&#x27;s completed its initial public offering on May 19, 1992, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KSS.
During the 2000s, Kohl&#x27;s expanded nationwide to 49 states. Building from 76 stores in the Midwest in 1992, Kohl&#x27;s expanded into the New York metropolitan area in 2000 after Caldor was liquidated. The chain later expanded into the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, California in 2003 with 28 new stores, the Pacific Northwest in 2006 with 10 new stores, and the Southeast with 43 new stores opening between 2005 and 2008. To raise money to repurchase its stock and open new stores, Kohl&#x27;s sold its credit card division in 2006 to J.P. Morgan Chase for $1.5 billion. In 2011, Kohl&#x27;s replaced Chase with Capital One as their private credit card processing partner for an undisclosed sum. In 2016, Kohl&#x27;s added the Capital One backed private label Kohl&#x27;s Card to the Kohl&#x27;s App to create Kohl&#x27;s Pay - the first integrated mobile checkout solution for a retailer in US, combining Kohl&#x27;s Card, Kohl&#x27;s Cash, Kohl&#x27;s Yes-2-You Rewards and Kohl&#x27;s coupons into a single QR Code Payment, with technology powered by Omnyway, Inc (né OmnyPay), a Silicon Valley startup. That same year, Kohl&#x27;s became the first retailer to include Kohl&#x27;s Card and Kohl&#x27;s Rewards in one tap payments with Apple Pay.

Kohl&#x27;s hired New York City advertising agency DeVito/Verdi in 2009 to strengthen the Kohl&#x27;s brand via a series of national television, online, and social media campaigns. The same year, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine ranked the company 18th overall and first in its industry in its &quot;Green Rankings&quot;, an examination of 500 of the largest corporations on their environmental track records. &quot;Newsweek&quot; remarked that Kohl&#x27;s had the largest solar power program of any retailer globally, it pursues green building certification, and over 78 locations in six states have solar panels. Kohl&#x27;s had also begun to sell reusable shopping bags the previous year.

Kohl&#x27;s was awarded $62.5 million in tax credits from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation in 2012. The retailer was to create 3,000 jobs with the funds, but only created 473. In the same year, Kohl&#x27;s requested financing from the village of Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, to fund the construction of its new headquarters there. Kohl&#x27;s received $2 million, the first of five installments that was to equal a total payout of $12 million, but ultimately backed out of the transaction.

In 2015, the company opened the first test store of Off/Aisle, a chain built around selling like-new clothing, home goods, jewelry, and accessories that were purchased and returned at Kohl&#x27;s stores. The stores sold items at discounted prices, and had a more restrictive return policy than typical Kohl&#x27;s stores. The Off/Aisle stores were ultimately closed in 2019.

In early January 2017, Kohl&#x27;s shares fell 19% in value, in what &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; said was &quot;the stock&#x27;s worst day on record,&quot; and noted that it was a noticeable exception to the overall declining volatility of the market. The company ranked 157th on the 2018 Fortune 500, the annual list of the largest United States corporations, having earned revenues of $19.095 billion in 2017. In that year, Kohl&#x27;s entered into a partnership with Amazon, which included a program where select stores would accept Amazon returns; in 2019 it was expanded nationwide. In 2018, Kohl&#x27;s announced a pilot program to lease space to grocer Aldi and, the following year, to fitness center Planet Fitness, alongside up to 10 stores each.

On March 16, 2022, it was announced that Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and Sycamore Partners were considering bids to buy Kohl&#x27;s, which its shares jumped 17%. On April 25, 2022, it was announced that Simon Property Group and Brookfield Asset Management, the owners of JCPenney, had set an offer to buy Kohl&#x27;s. In June 2022, the Franchise Group considered making a bid for the ownership of Kohl&#x27;s which might result in the sale of the real estate that Kohl&#x27;s owns to fund the acquisition by the Franchise Group. Kohl&#x27;s ultimately withdrew from the deal after Franchise Group lowered their bid for the company after finding out that Kohl&#x27;s had downgraded its outlook for the second fiscal quarter for the company as a result of &quot;softer consumer spending amid decades-high inflation&quot;.

Despite declining sales of furniture and home goods (the 6.3% decline in February 2024 was the 12th consecutive quarter of decline) Kohl&#x27;s is enlarging its home assortment by 40% in March 2024.

In 2024, Kohl&#x27;s struck a deal with Babies R Us to add baby supplies, furniture, Graco, Carter&#x27;s, Fisher-Price and other brands.

==Brands and store layout==
Kohl&#x27;s store brands include diffusion lines from high-end designers such as Dana Buchman, Vera Wang, Narciso Rodriguez, and Peter Som. Celebrities such as Avril Lavigne, Lauren Conrad, Daisy Fuentes, Paula DeAnda, Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears, Marc Anthony, and Tony Hawk have sold branded clothing exclusively through Kohl&#x27;s.

Kohl&#x27;s private brands generate nearly half of the firm&#x27;s $19 billion in annual sales. These include in-house clothing brands such as American Beauty, Apt. 9, Croft &amp; Barrow, Jumping Beans, So, Tek Gear, and Urban Pipeline. The Sonoma Goods for Life brand of apparel and home goods alone is worth over a billion dollars, and Kohl&#x27;s announced relaunch plans for the brand in 2016. Kohl&#x27;s has also purchased the exclusive retail rights to existing brands such as Candie&#x27;s and Mudd Jeans.

In 2021, Kohl&#x27;s made a deal with makeup retailer Sephora, to have certain Kohl&#x27;s locations have Sephora stores inside of the stores. This is a move to replace their in-house beauty selection. 

In 2024, Haus Labs by Lady Gaga announced that they had joined the Sephora at Kohl’s assortment.

Kohl&#x27;s uses a &quot;racetrack&quot; layout with a single aisle that circles the entire store, a layout borrowed from discount stores.

<text>Karl Heinz Bremer (16 November 1911 – 2 May 1942) was a German historian who died during the Second World War.

He had taught German at the Sorbonne and the Ecole Normale before the Second World War. He joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) 1 May 1937. 
Following the fall of France, Bremer was the associate director of the German Institute in Paris, from its creation in the fall of 1940 until he was sent to the Russian front 27 February 1942. The German Institute was responsible for editing the French press, and for controlling newly published French books during the occupation.

Bremer is known for the friendship he developed with the French collaborator and journalist Robert Brasillach. This friendship prospered because both men were eager to exchange knowledge of each other&#x27;s country and culture. But Bremer got involved very much in the policy of the Nazis in Paris. Together with Gerhard Heller, he became the main censor of the German embassy in Paris. Bremer also translated several works of Henry de Montherlant.

After a change in the personal policy of the Auswärtiges Amt, Bremer was sent to the Eastern front as many men servicing not in the army. He died shortly later at a battle near Lake Ilmen.

In April 1943, Henry de Montherlant wrote an obituary for Bremer in the journal &quot;&quot;Germany-France. Quarterly Journal of the German Institute in Paris&quot; (&quot;Deutschland-Frankreich. Vierteljahrsschrift des Deutschen Instituts Paris&quot;&quot;), which was titled „Souvenirs sur Karl Heinz Bremer“.

Bremer diagnosed, in 1938, in an article at the German magazine Die Tat the situation of the Second Republic in the following manner. While the republicans of 1848 were trying to solve the constitutional question, he observed, Louis Napoleon realized that the social question was the most important one. Parliamentarism, with its conflicting political parties and class struggles, was incapable of solving the social question. Only a dictatorship with a social outlook, in the view of Napoleon, could solve it. His great aim was to establish a political system based upon the unity of all classes and of all interests in France. It was Napoleon, according to Bremer, who first created the new type of state in the form of authoritarian, plebiscitarian leadership.&quot; Napoleon was seen by Bremer as the predecessor of Hitler.

Bremer also said that Proudhon popularized a social idea that was anti-liberal in order to give a social significance to the Second Empire. Proudhon developed a social idea for Louis Napoleon that was to bring workers into the Second Empire. Because Proudhon advocated slow changes over time, Napoleon rejected this solution.

<doc id="746737" wikidata="Q4837505" url="?curid=746737" title="Babar's Kingdom">
<text>Created by Jean de Brunhoff between 1931 and 1937, Babar&#x27;s Kingdom, also known as the Elephant Country (French: &quot;le pays des Éléphants&quot;), is a fictional country supposedly in West Africa with French characteristics that is composed of elephants and other animals, which are usually bipedal and &quot;civilized&quot;. As its name implies, it is ruled by its first civilized citizen, Babar himself. The political regime is an elective monarchy, as described in the book &quot;The Story of Babar&quot;, which explains his election as king after the previous king dies from eating a bad mushroom. The court consists of King Babar, Queen Celeste, Royal Princes and Princesses (Pom, Flora, Alexander, Isabelle, and Badou), Arthur, Pompadour, Troubadour, and Cornelius, who also serves as Secretary of Defense and a Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Old Lady and her monkey Zephyr complete the court.

The capital is Celesteville, which was built by Babar and named after his Queen. The name of the city is sometimes used for the country.

A neighboring country is Rhino Land, ruled by the (sometimes) tyrannical King Rataxes. The relations between Celesteville and Rhinoland have occasionally flared into war, although it is usually just a statement and peace is restored before much damage or casualties are suffered. The elephant army is under the direct command of King Babar (and likewise the rhino army is under the command of Rataxes). Some stories feature the two countries working together against common threats, such as when the area is infiltrated by poachers, and the two will help each other during times of need or crisis. In the television series, after working together to defend the region against a group of poachers, the two countries, along with other nearby animal-controlled territories, form a united jungle coalition, a concept similar to the United Nations, which prevents major conflicts between the animal countries thereafter. The militaries of the countries are considered simple and rely mostly on simple hand weaponry, such as spears and staffs. Guns are strictly forbidden by all the animals, due to their disgust with the poachers who would use the weapons. Not even Rataxes dares to think of arming his country with such things after seeing their effects first-hand.

The countries do seem to have at least some trade and commerce with each other, as well as with other kingdoms and countries, both animal- and human-controlled.

==Celesteville==
Celesteville is the capital of Babar&#x27;s Kingdom. The city is ruled by King Babar and named after his wife, Queen Celeste.

Celesteville is described differently in several places in the series. In the original incarnation, Babar built Celesteville after he returned from France, and began Westernizing his kingdom. He named his new city Celesteville, after the female elephant he had fallen in love with. The city lies in the middle of a jungle plain, surrounded by mountains, and is connected to a nearby sea or ocean, and is a port city.

Early on, like the rest of Babar&#x27;s Kingdom, Celesteville is primarily populated by elephants. Minorities include monkeys, lions, crocodiles, hippos, and at least one human. Though they are minority populations, they are treated as equals with the elephants and are given the same rights, liberties, and respects that the elephants have and are fully incorporated into the elephant society. However, this has drastically changed later on, with the city having a vast number of other animals besides elephants, possibly due to the taming of wild jungle animals.

Known citizens of Celesteville include:
* Babar – king of Celesteville.
* Celeste – Babar&#x27;s wife and cousin and the queen of the realm.
* Arthur – Celeste&#x27;s brother, Babar&#x27;s 2nd cousin.
* Pom, Flora, Alexander, and Isabelle – Babar&#x27;s children. Pom, Flora and Alexander are triplets. Isabelle and Alexander are the youngest. Pom is the oldest. Several years later, he grew up and became the father of Badou.
* Cornelius – an elephant, he is the prime minister of the kingdom. He wears a military uniform and has the role of an entire cabinet, acting as a Minister of Defense and a Minister of Foreign Affairs. During his time in the army, he served as a medic. In &quot;Babar and the Adventures of Badou&quot;, he is the legal guardian of the orphaned Jake and spends his free time trying to learn more about Jake&#x27;s origins in the hope of finding Jake&#x27;s real family.
* Pompadour – an elephant who dresses in 18th century attire, including wig. He usually acts as a Chamberlain to Babar.
* Troubadour – a companion to Pompadour, but he doesn&#x27;t speak.
* Zephir – a monkey and a personal friend of Babar. He is the father of Chiku and son-in-law of Monkeyville&#x27;s General Huc.
* Madame (The Old Lady) – a woman whom Babar befriended in France and returned with him when he became king. She taught him many things, was kind and caring, and in many ways became a surrogate mother of sorts to him. She is the only mentioned human who lives in Celesteville. Since she does not appear in &quot;Babar and the Adventures of Badou&quot;, it is possible that she has either moved away or more likely has since died (justified that she was very elderly when Babar was a child and likely passed away since), as Pom has now grown up and became a father and Babar himself is a grandfather of Badou by this point.
* General Huc – a general representing Monkeyville and happens to be Zephir&#x27;s father-in-law and Chiku&#x27;s grandfather.
* Truffles – a palace cook.
* André – a circus elephant who comes traveling through Celesteville along with a circus and later comes to live with Babar. Later on he joins the circus again.
* Marie – Flora&#x27;s friend who ran off when Flora wanted to keep playing hopscotch instead of skipping.
* Samantha – thought to be Celeste&#x27;s friend, Celeste greets her right before her riding accident with Zephir.
* Felipe – training to be the leading man in Mademoiselle Soretoza&#x27;s ballet, but quit after being fed up with Soretoza&#x27;s behavior.
* Ursula – Celeste&#x27;s friend and an actress in &quot;All Played Out&quot;.
* Badou – Babar&#x27;s grandson and Pom&#x27;s son, he is the main protagonist of &quot;Babar and the Adventures of Badou&quot;.
* Chiku – Zephir&#x27;s daughter and the maternal granddaughter of Monkeyville&#x27;s General Huc. She is one of Badou&#x27;s close friends. 
* Munroe – a young porcupine and one of Badou&#x27;s close friends. Dreams of one day becoming a member of the Royal Guard and is currently training to become one as a Junior Royal Cadet, a training program to prepare children who aspire to join the Royal Guard when they grow up.
* Zawadi – a female zebra and one of Badou&#x27;s friends.
* Jake – an orphaned young fox who was adopted by Cornelius. As a young kit on the Savannah, he was briefly raised by three friendly lionesses named Hannah, Ramsey, and Skylar, although a monsoon washed him out of their den and Jake eventually ended up in Celesteville where he met Badou and was adopted by Cornelius. Hopes to learn more about where he came from and find his real parents, though still cares for Cornelius and enjoys playing with Badou and his friends. 
* Cory – Flora&#x27;s husband and Babar&#x27;s son-in-law.
* Lulu – Babar&#x27;s granddaughter, Badou&#x27;s cousin.
* Periwinkle – the town&#x27;s doctor; Pom&#x27;s wife, Babar&#x27;s daughter-in-law and Badou&#x27;s mother.
* Crocodylus – ambassador of the Alligator and Crocodile kingdom.
* Dilash and Tersh – Crocodylus&#x27;s nephews, brought over to make him seem more important. Dilash is the oldest of the two and is both mean and scheming like his uncle. Tersh is kind and friendly, as well as a little bit naïve. Despite his relation to Crocodylus, Tersh usually goes along with his uncle&#x27;s plans due to his naïveté, which Dilash and his uncle take advantage of. He eventually becomes friends with Badou and the other kids, and at times even helps foil his uncle&#x27;s schemes. On one occasion, however, he asks Badou to keep his Uncle&#x27;s actions a secret as he Crocodylus is still Tersh&#x27;s family. In some episode, Badou and his friends occasionally join Tersh on his visits to the slogs of the Crocodile and Alligator kingdom.
* Gallop – a wise old tortoise who lives just outside Celesteville.
* Miss Strich – the ostrich and a palace teacher, guide for tourists, and also organizes most of Celesteville&#x27;s events.
* Prospero – a cape buffalo and a bush pirate. Officially banned from the kingdom, but still sneaks about.
* Dandy Andi – a wild lion who lives in the savanna but they joined the palace.
* Sleek – a wild black leopard who lives in the deep jungle who chases civilized animals.
* Hannah, Ramsey and Skylar – the trio of wild lionesses who live in the savanna but they raised from Jake as a kit.
* Hoot – a wild hyena who lives in the savanna and a friend of Dandy Andi.
By Babar&#x27;s decrees, a number of public institutions, schools, hospitals, parks, museums, libraries, an opera house, and other works of infrastructure have been built. The kingdom has a rail line, and Celesteville itself is connected to a large body of water (presumably a sea or ocean), making it a port city. Vehicle traffic is common in the kingdom, especially Celesteville, but most of the residents still seem to prefer to travel on foot or by bicycle, since many of the city&#x27;s amenities seem to be fairly close to each other. The city is wired with electricity and phone service, which are commonplace, and there also appears to be a limited amount of radio and television services. Fresh water and sewage systems are also abundant. The kingdom has a policy of free press, and is serviced in large part by newspaper. Literacy and schooling is high, and it appears that nearly 100 percent of the population is educated. Crime, poverty, and the penal system are rarely featured in the series, and are presumed to be rare in Babar&#x27;s Kingdom though criminals like Prospero and the pirate Blacktrunk occasionally appear to cause trouble. The Royal Guard acts as both the Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Guard and occasionally functions as Celesteville&#x27;s police force likely because of crime being a rarity in the kingdom and are often called in to defend the palace and Celesteville from attack or theft by the likes of Prospero and Blacktrunk. Besides the palace, it also protects valuable objects and other important places around Celesteville.

Babar and his family, as well as his advisors and some royal staff, live in a large palace in the center of the city. The palace is the kingdom&#x27;s largest structure, contains several stories, dozens of rooms, and a very large garden complex. It also houses a home for the Old Lady, the first building completed in Celesteville.

<text>Sphinx Systems Limited was a Swiss-based manufacturer of high quality pistols used mainly by special forces, elite police units and sports shooters. Sphinx was founded in 1976, specializing in tooling and machining, and then diversified into the firearms industry during the 1980s. Sphinx is best known for its development work on the original Czech-designed CZ 75 pistol, which evolved into the Sphinx 2000, Sphinx 3000 custom competition pistol, and Sphinx SDP Compact. Sphinx went out of business in July 2016.

== History ==

Sphinx started its work with pistols based on the CZ 75 design when they redesigned the ITM AT-84 licensed copy of the Czech CZ 75 and ITM AT-88, a first evolution of the CZ 75 that had been developed in Switzerland by ITM.

Sphinx originally manufactured all pistols in Switzerland. Slides are made from solid billet steel, frames from casts, forgings or also from billet, and each pistol is fitted with high-quality barrels. Earlier Sphinx pistols were not mass-produced and were hand-fitted to tight tolerances, making them more expensive than mass-produced products. All custom-made Sphinx pistols except the AT380 were shipped with an actual test target, confirming the specific firearm&#x27;s accuracy.

In 2010 Sphinx joined KRISS Group and began production of the SDP Compact in 2012. The US-built SPD Compact, based largely on the 3000 Series, was Sphinx&#x27;s first mass-produced firearm. Initial reviews were positive.

Sphinx products were historically imported to the United States by SILE corporation, and until 2008 by SABRE Defense Industries. From 2010 Sphinx products were imported into the US by KRISS USA in Virginia Beach, Virginia.

Sphinx Systems AG was declared bankrupt on 30 November 2015. The parent company, KRISS Group SA, has been in financial trouble as well. KRISS USA, an independently operated subsidiary of KRISS Group SA, has since taken over production and other business activities.

In July 2016 Sphinx went out of business, due primarily to a Federal Council ban on the supply of weapon parts to the Arab region.

== Sphinx pistols ==
;AT380 Series: A sub-compact pistol. Slightly smaller in general overall dimension than the Walther PPK/S, it also has a larger magazine capacity (10/11/15). The sights are adjustable. Safeties include: 1. an automatic firing-pin block type which precludes the striker from being hit unless the trigger is pulled, eliminating slam-fires etc. 2. Manual firing-pin block safeties on &quot;M&quot; models (similar in function to the Beretta 92F). Due to tighter firearms trade restrictions, the AT .380 is no longer imported into the United States.
;Sphinx 2000 Series: A full- and medium-sized defense and sports pistol that shows its CZ 75/AT-88 heritage.
;Sphinx 3000 Series: A full- and medium-sized defense and sports CNC machined pistol made out of various metals such as stainless steel, aluminium and titanium. The Sphinx 3000 was designed as a modern combat pistol with features like a Picatinny accessory rail, a low bore line, extended magazine release, various safety system options, various finishes, sights, pistol sizes and materials to choose from.
;Sphinx SDP Series
: SubCompact (6.55&quot;), Compact (7.40&quot;), and Standard (8.19&quot;) size 9mm pistol introduced from 2013-2015. Mass-produced version of the 3000 Series. All models have a DA/SA trigger, ambidextrous decocker and a TIAIN-coated steel slide. 
: Frame materials vary. Black, Krypton and Sand lines features hard anodized aluminium upper and lower frames, and weigh 29.06-29.72 oz (Compact). The Alpha line use hard anodized aluminium upper frame and polymer lower frames, and weigh 24.90 oz (SC), 28.18-28.39 oz (C), or 31.43 oz (Std). The Duo-Tone and Stainless Steel models use all steel upper and lower frames (42.43-42.64 oz, Compact).
: The Compacts are also available with threaded barrels. All metal Compacts all have interchangeable polymer grips. Unlike its larger cousins, the SubCompact does not have interchangeable backstraps. 
: It made its US debut during the first quarter of 2013 as the Compact Alpha model, followed in 2014 by other Compact models. SubCompact Alpha and Standard Alpha models were introduced in late 2014/early 2015. Although slated for manufacture, Standard and Production-sized models have yet to be imported into the US by the distributor, KRISS USA.

<text>151 Abundantia is a stony main belt asteroid. It was discovered by Johann Palisa on 1 November 1875, from the Austrian Naval Observatory in Pula. The name was chosen by Edmund Weiss of the Vienna Observatory; although the name refers to Abundantia, a Roman goddess of luck, it was also chosen to celebrate the increasing numbers of asteroids that were being discovered in the 1870s.

Information from A. Harris as of 1 March 2001 indicates that 151 Abundantia is an S class (stony) asteroid with a diameter of 45.37 km and H = 9.24 .1728 and albedo of 0.03. The light curve collected over 6 nights from 2/16/2002 to 3/10/2002 confirmed the rotational period to be 19.718h.

Data from 2001 shows a diameter of 45.37 km. An occultation by the asteroid was observed on 10 December 2017, showing the asteroid to be highly elongated, with dimensions of roughly 24 x 52 km.

<doc id="746748" wikidata="Q2668502" url="?curid=746748" title="3rd Ring Road (Beijing)">
<text>The 3rd Ring Road () is a -long city ring road that encircles the city center of Beijing.

When Beijing first became the capital of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the road existed only in segments encircling the northern, eastern, and southern parts of the city. At the time, its segments were known as Beihuan (North Ring), Donghuan (East Ring), and Nanhuan (South Ring), respectively. The 3rd Ring Road was finally finished in 1994 with the completion of the western segment. There are 52 flyovers, including Sanyuanqiao, which links it to the Airport Expressway. The speed limit is a uniform 80 km/h.

The ring road runs through the busy CBD section in the east through Panjiayuan and Fenzhongsi, linking up with the Jingjintang Expressway. It continues south toward Muxiyuan and Yuquanying, linking up with the Jingkai Expressway. It then proceeds west, linking up with the Jingshi Expressway before running into the western segment, which is linked with the Wukesong residential area, TV broadcasting centers, and, in the northwest, Zhongguancun IT zone. The northern segment is equally busy, running through Beitaipingzhuang, with links to the Badaling Expressway and the Jingcheng Expressway.

Line 10 of the Beijing Subway has been constructed under the eastern segments of the 3rd Ring Road and was completed in 2008.

== Traffic congestion ==

The 3rd Ring Road is notorious for its traffic jams. The eastern segment, which runs through Beijing&#x27;s central business district (CBD), is regularly gridlocked during rush hour. The interchanges of this segment are modified diamond interchanges, consisting of openings of the road barrier on the right that separates the main lanes from the frontage roads. These interchanges can often back up traffic since they cannot easily handle the huge traffic volumes of Beijing. The situation is often worsened by the bus stops that are located right adjacent to the exits.

== Location ==
The 3rd Ring Road is from the 2nd Ring Road and from the city center. The 3rd Ring Road goes through mostly residential and some commercial areas (except for the CBD) that were created during Beijing&#x27;s first wave of rapid expansion.

== Surface conditions ==

Until 2003, the entire 3rd Ring Road was very bumpy, and trips were very unpleasant. Following the renovation of the 2nd Ring Road in 2001, a similar project was conducted in 2003 and the road surface has been much smoother since then.

<doc id="746751" wikidata="Q1465300" url="?curid=746751" title="OpenMath">
<text>OpenMath is the name of a markup language for specifying the meaning of mathematical formulae. Among other things, it can be used to complement MathML, a standard which mainly focuses on the presentation of formulae, with information about their semantic meaning. OpenMath can be encoded in XML or in a binary format.

== Coverage ==

OpenMath consists of the definition of &quot;OpenMath Objects&quot;, which is an abstract datatype for describing the logical structure of a mathematical formula and the definition of &quot;OpenMath Content Dictionaries&quot;, or collections of names for mathematical concepts. The names available from the latter type of collections are specifically intended for use in extending MathML, and conversely, a basic set of such &quot;Content Dictionaries&quot; has been designed to be compatible with the small set of mathematical concepts defined in Content MathML, the non-presentational subset of MathML.

== History ==

OpenMath has been developed in a long series of workshops and (mostly European) research projects that began in 1993 and continues through today. The OpenMath 1.0 Standard was released in February 2000, and revised as OpenMath 1.1 in October 2002. Two years later, the OpenMath 2.0 Standard was released in June 2004. OpenMath 1 fixed the basic language architecture, while OpenMath2 brought better XML integration, structure sharing and liberalized the notion of OpenMath Content dictionaries.

== OpenMath Society ==

The OpenMath Effort is governed by the OpenMath Society, based in Helsinki, Finland. The Society brings together tool builders, software suppliers, publishers and authors. Membership is by invitation of the Societies Executive Committee, which welcomes self-nominations of individuals who have worked on OpenMath-related issues in research or application. As of 2007, Michael Kohlhase is president of the OpenMath society. He succeeded Arjeh M. Cohen, who was the first president.

== Example ==

The well-known quadratic formula:
:formula_1

would be marked up like this in OpenMath (the representation is an expression tree made up from functional elements like for function application or for variables):
&lt;OMOBJ xmlns=&quot;http://www.openmath.org/OpenMath&quot;&gt;
 &lt;OMA cdbase=&quot;http://www.openmath.org/cd&quot;&gt;
 &lt;OMS cd=&quot;relation1&quot; name=&quot;eq&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;OMV name=&quot;x&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;OMA&gt;
 &lt;OMS cd=&quot;arith1&quot; name=&quot;divide&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;OMA&gt;
 &lt;OMS cdbase=&quot;http://www.example.com/mathops&quot; cd=&quot;multiops&quot; name=&quot;plusminus&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;OMA&gt;
 &lt;OMS cd=&quot;arith1&quot; name=&quot;unary_minus&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;OMV name=&quot;b&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/OMA&gt;
 &lt;OMA&gt;
 &lt;OMS cd=&quot;arith1&quot; name=&quot;root&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;OMA&gt;
 &lt;OMS cd=&quot;arith1&quot; name=&quot;minus&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;OMA&gt;
 &lt;OMS cd=&quot;arith1&quot; name=&quot;power&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;OMV name=&quot;b&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;OMI&gt;2&lt;/OMI&gt;
 &lt;/OMA&gt;
 &lt;OMA&gt;
 &lt;OMS cd=&quot;arith1&quot; name=&quot;times&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;OMI&gt;4&lt;/OMI&gt;
 &lt;OMV name=&quot;a&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;OMV name=&quot;c&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/OMA&gt;
 &lt;/OMA&gt;
 &lt;/OMA&gt;
 &lt;/OMA&gt;
 &lt;OMA&gt;
 &lt;OMS cd=&quot;arith1&quot; name=&quot;times&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;OMI&gt;2&lt;/OMI&gt;
 &lt;OMV name=&quot;a&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/OMA&gt;
 &lt;/OMA&gt;
 &lt;/OMA&gt;
&lt;/OMOBJ&gt;
In the expression tree above symbols—i.e. elements like —stand for mathematical functions that are applied to sibling expressions in an which are interpreted as arguments. The element is a generic extension element that means whatever is specified in the content dictionary referred to in the attribute (this document can be found at the URI specified in the innermost attribute dominating the respective element. In the example above, all symbols come from the content dictionary for arithmetics (, see below), except for the , which comes from a non-standard place, hence the attribute here.

== OpenMath Content Dictionaries ==

Content Dictionaries are structured XML documents that define mathematical symbols that can be referred to by OMS elements in OpenMath Objects. The OpenMath 2 standard does not prescribe a canonical encoding for content dictionaries, but only requires an infrastructure sufficient for unique referencing in OMS elements. OpenMath provides a very basic XML encoding that meets these requirements, and a set of specific content dictionaries for some areas of mathematics, in particular covering the K-14 fragment covered by content MathML.

For more richly structured content dictionaries (and generally for arbitrary mathematical documents) the OMDoc format extends OpenMath by a “statement level” (including structures like definitions, theorems, proofs and examples, as well as means for interrelating them) and a “theory level”, where a theory is a collection of several contextually related statements. OMDoc&#x27;s theories are designed to be compatible to OpenMath content dictionaries, but they can also be set into inheritance and import relations.

==Criticism==

OpenMath is criticised for being inadequate for general mathematics, exposing not enough formal precision to capture the intricacies of numerics, lacking a proof-of-concept and as an inferior technology to already established approaches of encoding mathematical semantics, amongst other presumed shortcomings.

<doc id="746756" wikidata="Q1821304" url="?curid=746756" title="Portia Faces Life">
<text>Portia Faces Life is an American soap opera first broadcast as a radio series from 1940 to 1953, and then on television for a single season in the mid-1950s. It began in syndication on April 1, 1940, and was broadcast on some stations that carried NBC programs, although it does not seem to have been an official part of that network&#x27;s programming. The original title was &quot;Portia Blake Faces Life&quot;.

Stations airing the series, according to newspaper advertisements, included WNAC in Boston, WLS in Chicago, KRLD in Dallas, KGW in Portland, Oregon and KFI in Los Angeles.

The series became part of the CBS Radio Network, on October 7, 1940, and its title was changed to &quot;Portia Faces Life&quot;. It was sponsored by the company General Foods.

&quot;Portia Faces Life&quot; continued on CBS until April 25, 1941. Three days later, it moved to NBC where it continued until March 31, 1944. It then returned to CBS as a summer series from April 3 to September 29, 1944. Heard on NBC from October 3, 1944 to June 29, 1951, the series continued until 1953, according to scriptwriter Mona Kent, who wrote every episode. General Foods remained the sponsor through all 13 years of the radio series.

The programme was launched to television as a series by CBS, airing from April 5, 1954, until July 1, 1955. The TV series version stars Frances Reid as Portia Blake Manning. Reid was replaced by Fran Carlon from July 5, 1954. The program was also retitled as &quot;The Inner Flame&quot; in March 1955.

==Characters and story==

The title character Portia Blake (Lucille Wall) is an attorney who faced hardships as she fought corruption in the small town of Parkersburg. She was a widow with a ten-year-old son named Dickie; her husband Richard had been murdered by criminal elements he had fought to expose. The idea of a woman lawyer as a protagonist was unusual for the time, and newspaper advertisements described Blake as &quot;a courageous woman attorney who battles forces of crime, injustice, and civic corruption&quot; in a typical American city. Also part of the storyline was the character of crusading journalist Walter Manning (played by Myron McCormick), who was secretly in love with her. Manning was trying to expose the criminals responsible for the death of Portia&#x27;s husband.

==Australian version==

A localized version of &quot;Portia Faces Life&quot; was launched in Australia in 1952 and began transmission from the radio station 3UZ in Melbourne. It was introduced by American expatriate Grace Gibson.

It stars Lyndall Barbour as the title character, who was renamed &quot;Portia Manning&quot;.

It was broadcast for 3,544 quarter-hour episodes until 1970. Every episode started with the introduction, &quot;A story taken from the heart of every woman who has ever dared to love.&quot;

The series also was broadcast from the ZB radio network in New Zealand.

Following the conclusion of &quot;Portia Faces Life&quot;, Lyndall Barbour was cast as Portia again in four smaller shows: &quot;Partners in Jeopardy&quot;, &quot;The Silent Witness&quot;, &quot;The Haverlock Affair&quot; and &quot;The Seed of Evil&quot;. Portia Manning also had cameo appearances in &quot;Violets are Blue&quot;, &quot;Clayton Place&quot; and &quot;Thirty Days Hath September&quot;.

<text>152 Atala is a large main belt asteroid that was discovered by brothers Paul Henry and Prosper Henry on 2 November 1875, but the discovery was credited to Paul. It is a type D asteroid, meaning that it is composed of carbon, organic rich silicates and possibly water ice.

The asteroid is named for the eponymous heroine of the 1801 novella &quot;Atala&quot; by François-René de Chateaubriand. The Henry brothers also named the last of their discoveries, 186 Celuta, after another Chateaubriand heroine. Both Atala and Céluta are American Indian fictional characters.

An occultation of a star by Atala was observed from Japan on 11 March 1994. Subsequent occultations have been observed as recently as 2006.

Photometric of this asteroid made in 1981 gave a light curve with a period of 5.282 ± 0.004 hours with a brightness variation of 0.50 in magnitude.

<text>Chaos Strikes Back is an expansion and sequel to &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;, the earlier 3D role-playing video game. &quot;Chaos Strikes Back&quot; was released in 1989 and is also available on several platforms (including Atari ST, Amiga, X68000, PC-98, FM Towns). It uses the same engine as &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;, with new graphics and a new, far more challenging, dungeon.

==Development==
Wayne Holder of FTL said in 1994 that &quot;Chaos Strikes Back&quot; was developed after the success of the first game, and reused its look and style. He said &quot;I wish we&#x27;d done the whole thing differently ... some people were expecting more. It certainly wasn&#x27;t in the same class as Dungeon Master&quot;.

== Gameplay ==

Although &quot;Chaos Strikes Back&quot; describes itself as an expansion pack, the original &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; is not required. Whereas the first game saw the player following a fairly linear path through the adventure, with the completion of each flat level marked by a staircase leading down onto a new slightly harder level below, &quot;Chaos Strikes Back&quot; features a choice of paths which twist back and forth over all levels. The puzzles are far more convoluted, often demanding quick mastery of the control system to deal with intense combat, along with brain vexing riddles and room layouts.

The game is therefore pitched at a much higher difficulty level than its predecessor. The player can choose from a selection of moderately high-level characters or can import characters from a &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; saved game. In an indication of the game&#x27;s uncompromising toughness, the player&#x27;s very first task is to get out of a dark, enclosed room filled with ferociously toothed man-eating giant worms. The game is made a little easier by the inclusion of a separate program which dispenses cryptic hints based on the player&#x27;s current saved game. Another new, useful feature is an ingame real time map of the dungeon, which makes use of the GOR magic glyph (It had no use in the first game though it&#x27;s said it was used to create FUL bomb attack potions, which wasn&#x27;t kept as a spell for the released game) The original had countless guides but the much harder sequel did not, perhaps due to the game itself having an inbuilt map as well as the &#x27;oracle&#x27; hint feature, even so though a shorter game it is a lot harder.

The player&#x27;s task is to collect four pieces of corbum, a magical material from which the eponymous Lord Chaos draws his power. This requires the traversing of four separate paths each leading to a piece of corbamite and each themed around one of the disciplines open to characters in the game. These disciplines are fighter, wizard, priest and ninja.

=== Champion Editor ===

&quot;Chaos Strikes Back&quot; comes with a utility for editing the portraits and names of the four-character party. This utility allows custom character portraits to be created for both &quot;Chaos Strikes Back&quot; and for &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;.

For users who do not want to draw new characters, but who would like more powerful looking versions of the existing characters (to better represent the higher levels), the game&#x27;s utility disk also comes with &quot;enhanced&quot; versions of the game&#x27;s prepackaged character art.

==Reception==
“Computer Gaming World stated that &quot;With the release of &quot;Chaos Strikes Back&quot;, FTL still has one foot in the winner&#x27;s circle.&quot;

The game was reviewed in 1991 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #171 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.

Niko Nirvi reviewed the game in MikroBitti and gave 98 points (out of 100) calling the difficulty level insane and mentioned a disappointing ending but nevertheless called the game &quot;bewitching&quot; and &quot;classic&quot;.

<text>Harold Jacob &quot;Hecky&quot; Rome (May 27, 1908 – October 26, 1993) was an American composer, lyricist, and writer for musical theater.

==Biography==
Rome was born in Hartford, Connecticut and graduated from Hartford Public High School. Originally, he chose to go to Trinity College, but transferred because he felt like a &quot;townie.&quot; Rome played piano in local dance bands such as Eddie Wittstein&#x27;s and was already writing music while studying architecture and law at Yale University. While at Yale, he also pledged to Tau Epsilon Phi. He graduated in 1929 with a Bachelor of Arts, and continued into Yale Law School.

After graduation, he worked as an architect in New York City, but continued to pursue his musical interests, arranging music for local bands, and writing material for revues at Green Mansions, a Jewish summer resort in the Adirondacks. Much of the music Rome was writing at this time was socially conscious and of little interest to Tin Pan Alley.

In 1937, he made his Broadway debut as co-writer, composer, and lyricist of the topical revue &quot;Pins and Needles&quot;, which was originally written for a small theatrical production directed by Samuel Roland. After a two-week professional run, it was adapted for performances by members of the then-striking International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union (ILGWU) as entertainment for its members. 

As Roland was associated with left-wing causes, he was asked by ILGWU president David Dubinsky to withdraw. The show was a huge success, running for 1108 performances, and prompted George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart to invite Rome to collaborate on another topical revue, &quot;Sing Out the News&quot;, in 1938.

In 1949, he wrote the English lyrics of the French song &quot;Mais qu’est-ce que j’ai?&quot;. The title song became &quot;What Can I Do?&quot; and the song was recorded by Madelyn Russell with Mitch Miller and his Orchestra.

During World War II, Rome wrote English lyrics to a tune composed by the Soviet Dmitri Shostakovitch. The song was titled &quot;United Nations on the March&quot; and served as the unofficial anthem of the Allied Powers in World War II.

In the early 1940s, Rome wrote songs for several revues and shows, but it was not until after the end of World War II that he had his next real success with &quot;Call Me Mister&quot;. His first full-fledged musical was &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; in 1952. 

Additional Broadway credits include &quot;Fanny&quot; (1954), &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; (1959), &quot;I Can Get It for You Wholesale&quot; (1962), in which Barbra Streisand made her Broadway debut, and &quot;The Zulu and the Zayda&quot; (1965), which dealt with racial and religious intolerance. He also wrote the lyrics for &quot;La Grosse Valise&quot; (composer Gérard Calvi), which enjoyed a short run at the 54th Street Theater in 1965.

In 1970, he wrote a musical adaptation of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; entitled &quot;Scarlett&quot; for a Tokyo production with a Japanese cast. It later was staged in English with little success in London and Los Angeles.

Rome&#x27;s music and/or lyrics can be heard in such films as &quot;Babes on Broadway&quot; (1941), &quot;Thousands Cheer&quot; (1943), &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; (1945), and &quot;Rear Window&quot; (1954).

In 1991, Rome was presented with a special Drama Desk Award for his &quot;distinctive contribution to musical theater&quot;. Later that same year, he was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

Rome died of a stroke in New York City at the age of 85.

<text>Junio Valerio Scipione Ghezzo Marcantonio Maria Borghese (6 June 1906 – 26 August 1974), nicknamed The Black Prince, was an Italian Navy commander during the regime of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s National Fascist Party and a prominent hardline neo-fascist politician in post-war Italy. In 1970, he took part in the planning of a neo-fascist coup, dubbed the Golpe Borghese, that was called off after the press discovered it; he subsequently fled to Spain and spent the last years of his life there.

==Early life and early career==

Junio Valerio Borghese was born in Artena, Province of Rome, Kingdom of Italy. He was born into a prominent noble family of Sienese origin, the House of Borghese, of which Pope Paul V was a notable member. His father, Livio Borghese, was the 11th Prince of Sulmona and younger brother to the more famous Scipione Borghese. Borghese was the second son of the prince and, as such, had the title of Patrician of Rome, Naples and Venice and the style of &quot;Don Junio Valerio Borghese&quot;. However, the press and the English-language historiography routinely used the courtesy style &quot;Prince Junio Valerio Borghese&quot;. Borghese was first educated in London, England, and, from 1923, he attended the Royal Italian Navy Academy (&quot;Accademia Navale&quot;) in Livorno.

In 1929, the naval career of Borghese began. By 1933, he was a submarine commander. Borghese took part in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. During the Italian intervention in the Spanish Civil War, he was in command of the submarine &quot;Iride&quot;, where he allegedly lost two seamen after his unit was depth-charged by the British destroyer HMS &quot;Havock&quot;.

==World War II==
At the start of the Second World War, Borghese took command of submarine &quot;Vettor Pisani&quot;, and in August 1940 was in command of submarine &quot;Sciré&quot;, which was modified to carry the new secret Italian weapon, the human torpedo. Known as &quot;slow speed torpedoes&quot; (&quot;siluri a lenta corsa&quot;, or SLC), and nicknamed &quot;pigs&quot; (&quot;maiali&quot;) for their poor maneuverability, these were small underwater assault vehicles with a crew of two.

These were part of the &quot;1ª Flottiglia Mezzi d&#x27;Assalto&quot; (MAS), the &quot;First Assault Vehicle Flotilla&quot; (later called &quot;Decima Flottiglia MAS&quot;), an elite naval sabotage unit of the Royal Italian Navy (&quot;Regia Marina Italiana&quot;).

As commander of &quot;Sciré&quot; Borghese took part in several raids using SLC. The first of these, in September and October 1940, were directed at Gibraltar. The September raid was abandoned when the harbour was found to be empty. In the October raid, Borghese took &quot;Sciré&quot; deep into Gibraltar Bay, making a difficult submerged passage in order to release the SLC as close to the target as possible. For this he received the Medaglia d&#x27;Oro al Valor Militare (MOVM), despite the mission&#x27;s overall lack of success.

In May 1941 a further attempt ended in failure, but on 20 September 1941, a successful mission damaged three merchant ships in the harbour. After this last attack, he was promoted to &quot;Capitano di Fregata&quot;, and named commander of the &quot;Decima MAS&quot;&#x27; sub-surface unit.

On 18 December 1941, he reached Alexandria in &quot;Sciré&quot; and launched the daring raid by three SLCs that heavily damaged the two Royal Navy battleships and and two other ships in the harbour. The six Italian Navy crew that attacked Alexandria harbour all received the &quot;Medaglia d&#x27;Oro al Valor Militare&quot;, and Borghese was named &quot;Cavaliere dell&#x27;Ordine Militare di Savoia&quot;.

In May 1943, Borghese took command of the &quot;Decima Flottiglia MAS&quot; (&quot;10th Assault Vehicle Flotilla&quot;), or &quot;Xª MAS&quot; with Roman numerals, which continued active service in the Mediterranean and pioneered new techniques of commando assault warfare. The Roman numeral was in memory of Caesar&#x27;s famous Decima Legio.

===8 September 1943: the Armistice===

After Italy&#x27;s surrender to the Allies on 8 September 1943, the &quot;Xª MAS&quot; was disbanded. While some of its sailors joined the Allies, Borghese chose to continue fighting with the Italian Social Republic (RSI) alongside the German Armed Forces (&quot;Wehrmacht&quot;).

On 12 September 1943, he signed a treaty of alliance with Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. Many of his colleagues volunteered to serve with him, and the Decima Flottiglia was revived, headquartered in &quot;Caserma del Muggiano&quot;, La Spezia. By the end of the war, it had over 18,000 members, and Borghese conceived it as a purely military unit. The X Flottiglia gained a reputation for never firing a shot at any Italian military units fighting with the Allied forces.

In April 1945 when the US command discovered that the British had granted permission to Marshal Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, and his Communist troops, to occupy northeastern Italy from Venice to the east, Borghese moved the bulk of the X Flottiglia from the Ligurian and Piedmontese area to the Veneto. The X Flottiglia built a line of defence on the Tagliamento river where they resisted until the arrival of the Allied troops.

In this action, the X Flottiglia lost over eighty per cent of the fighting sailors dispatched to the front against Tito&#x27;s troops, and the Italian Communist Partisans allied with Tito.

At the end of the war, Borghese was rescued by Office of Strategic Services officer James Angleton, who dressed him in an American uniform and drove him from Milan to Rome for interrogation by the Allies. Borghese was then tried and convicted of collaboration with the Nazi invaders, but not of war crimes, by the Italian Court. He was &quot;sentenced to 12 years imprisonment, discounted to 3 years, due to his glorious expeditions during the war, his defence of northeast borders against Tito&#x27;s &quot;IX Corps&quot; and his defence of Genoa harbour&quot;. He was released from jail after four years&#x27; imprisonment by the Supreme Court of Cassation in 1949.

==Political activism after the war==
With his record as a war hero and his support of Fascism, he became a figurehead for pro-fascist, anti-communist groups in the immediate post-war period, acquiring the nickname &quot;Black Prince&quot;.

Borghese wrote a supportive introduction, affirming his political ideology of an idealistic neo-fascist new aristocracy meritocratically based purely on character, to far right revolutionary-conservative theorist Julius Evola&#x27;s book &quot;Men Among the Ruins&quot; . He later wrote a memoir of his wartime exploits, published as &quot;Sea Devils&quot; in 1954. He was associated with the Movimento Sociale Italiano (MSI), the neo-fascist party formed in the post-World War II period by former supporters of the dictator Benito Mussolini.

Later, advocating a harder line which the MSI was not able or willing to uphold, he broke from the MSI to form an even stauncher neofascist formation, known as the Fronte Nazionale.

===Attempted coup===
Following a last minute aborted &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; plot which fizzled out on the night of 8 December 1970 (the Feast of the Immaculate Conception), referred to as the Golpe Borghese, he was forced to cross the border to avoid arrest and interrogation. In 1984, ten years after Borghese&#x27;s death, the Supreme Court of Cassation ruled that no &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; attempt had happened, in the sense that it was just a &quot;meeting of four or five sixty-year-olds&quot;.

Nevertheless, the attempt is well known in Italy and film director Mario Monicelli made a biting satire of it called &quot;Vogliamo i colonnelli&quot; (1972) (&quot;We want the Colonels&quot;, as the Fascist Greek colonels were pulling the strings behind the scenes). The main character (played by Ugo Tognazzi) is a bombastic neo-fascist politician called Tritoni (Triton), a clear allusion to Borghese, who was sometimes called the &quot;frog prince&quot; in Italy, after his time in the Frogmen assault Unit &quot;Dècima MAS&quot;.

===Final years and death===

Latterly regarded as a political outcast and shunned by his ancestrally blue blood social connections for his &quot;heretical&quot; political extremism and disregard for the external norms of modern aristocratic etiquette and behaviour, Borghese died under mysterious circumstances in Cádiz, Spain, on 26 August 1974, aged 68. The death certificate records the cause of death as &quot;acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis&quot;; however, since Borghese was visited by a physician who found him in good shape just a few days before, it has been suggested that the circumstances of his death, characterized by a sudden onset of abdominal pain immediately after supper, could be compatible with arsenic poisoning.

He is buried in the Borghese family chapel in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome.

== Family ==
He was born as Junio Valerio Scipione Ghezzo Marcantonio Maria of the Borghese princes in Rome, in one of the most important families of the Roman nobility, of ancient Sienese origins, with 4 cardinals, a pope and Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s sister, Paolina, among his ancestors. He was the second son of Prince Livio Borghese of Sulmona (1874–1939), Prince of Rossano, Prince of Vivaro Romano, Prince of Monte Compatri, Duke of Palombara, Duke of Poggio Nativo and Castelchiodato; his mother was Princess Valeria Maria Alessandra Keun (Smyrna, 1880 – Catania, 1956), daughter of Alfred August Keun and Virgina Amirà. His parents separated in Rome on 31 May 1911. As a consequence of the fact that his father was a diplomat (with the rank of plenipotentiary minister), Junio Valerio spent the first years of his life travelling between Italy and the main foreign capitals, staying in China, Egypt, Spain, France and Great Britain. In Italy, he mostly spent his time in and around Rome. He married in Florence, on 30 September 1931, the Russian countess Darya Vasilyevna Olsufeeva (Moscow, 1909 – Rome, 1963), sister of Alexandra &quot;Assia&quot; Vasilyevna Olsufeeva, wife of Andrea Busiri Vici. They had four children:

* Elena Maria Nives (born in Rome in 1932);
* Paolo Valerio Livio Vasilj Michele Scipione Romano Maria (Rome, 1933 – Rome, 1999), who married Niké Arrighi, with whom he had his daughter Flavia;
* Livio Giuseppe Maria della Neve (Rome, 1940 – Sperlonga, 1989), who married Piera Loreta Rita Vallone (1941), with whom he had: Daria (1968), who married Carmelo Tibor Salleo of the Barons of San Filippo, Livia, Marcantonio (Rome, 1970), who married Francesca d&#x27;Amore and Niccolò;
* Andrea Scirè Maria della Neve [78] (Rome, 1942 - Wollongong, 2024), who married Marisa Canti, with whom he had: Luca, Alessio (twins), Karen and Valerio.

<text>Roy Rudolf Romer (born October 31, 1928) is an American politician who served as the 39th Governor of Colorado from 1987 to 1999, and subsequently as the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District from 2000 to 2006. Romer was a member of the Democratic Party. He is the father of Paul Romer, a recipient of the 2018 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.

==Background and personal life==
Romer was born in Garden City, Kansas, on October 31, 1928, the son of Margaret Elizabeth (Snyder) and Irving Rudolph Romer. He grew up in the southeastern Colorado town of Holly. Romer received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in agricultural economics from Colorado State University in 1950, where he served for one year as President of the Associated Students of Colorado State University. He later received a law degree from the University of Colorado School of Law in 1952. He also studied ethics for one year at Yale Divinity School, and was a legal officer in the U.S. Air Force. 

Romer was married to Beatrice Miller Romer for 70 years, until her death in 2023. They had seven children, including Paul Romer, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, and Chris Romer, who was elected to a Colorado State Senate seat from Denver in 2006. His granddaughter, Rachel Romer is the co-founder and CEO of Guild Education.

==Early professional activities==
In the 1950s and 1960s, Romer was an attorney in Denver. He was also active in the management of his family&#x27;s agricultural operations throughout Colorado.

==Political career==

===Colorado state government===

Romer served in the Colorado House of Representatives from 1958 to 1962 and in the Colorado Senate from 1962 to 1966. In 1966, Romer unsuccessfully challenged Republican U.S. Senator Gordon Allott.

Romer was Colorado State Treasurer from 1977 to 1987 (winning re-election to full four-year terms in 1978 and 1982), and a member of the governor&#x27;s cabinet. Romer was first elected as governor in 1986, and re-elected in 1990 and 1994; he was the second Colorado governor to serve three terms. In 1997, Romer, along with Utah Governor Michael O. Leavitt and Wyoming Governor Jim Geringer, led a bipartisan team of 19 state governors in the founding of Western Governors University.

===National political positions===
Romer chaired the Democratic Governors Association in 1991. In 1992, he was co-chairman of the Democratic National Platform Committee. Romer served as national vice chair of the Democratic Leadership Council, and was a national co-chairman of the Clinton-Gore &#x27;96 campaign. In 1997, Romer was elected to serve as general chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

From 1992 to 1993, Romer served as chair of the National Governors Association. In 1994–1995 he chaired the Education Commission of the States, and in 1995, was part of a bipartisan effort by the nation&#x27;s governors to reform Medicaid.

In law, his name is associated with the anti-discrimination suit &quot;Romer v. Evans&quot; that was brought to the Supreme Court during his tenure as Governor of Colorado. Though he was opposed to the amendment to the Constitution of Colorado in question, he defended the law, which prevented protected status based upon homosexuality or bisexuality, in state and federal court in his position as Governor during litigation. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled against the state&#x27;s defense of Amendment 2, that it had “a rational relationship to legitimate state interests&quot;. The Court then invalidated Amendment 2 under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. The state ultimately failed to give a &quot;rational basis&quot; to the purpose of the law. The case did not go as far to ruling that gays and lesbians are protected as intermediate or strict scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment and left that question to lower federal and state courts to decide.

===&quot;Romer v. Grant&quot;===
In October 2004, Roy Romer and the Los Angeles Unified School District filed suit in the United States District Court, Central District of California against David Grant, a former student of the Los Angeles Unified School District. The suit cited false endorsement of the Lanham Act, violation of the Can-Spam Act, California Statutory Cyber Piracy, violation of the right of publicity under California statutory and common law, and California statutory unfair competition.

The lawsuit alleged David Grant attempted to lure the district&#x27;s 700,000 students to a pornographic website. Roy Romer and the Los Angeles Unified School District subsequently settled the suit by paying Grant $360,000.00 in exchange for the domain name royromer.com.

==Professional activities==
On June 7, 2000, he became Superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, where he served for six years. On October 12, 2006, the Los Angeles Board of Education unanimously named David L. Brewer III as his successor.

On April 25, 2007, Roy Romer began his service as the chairman and lead spokesman for Strong American Schools, a nonprofit project responsible for running Ed in 08, an information and initiative campaign funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Eli and Edythe Broad foundation, aimed at encouraging 2008 presidential contenders to include education in their campaign policies.

==Honors and awards==
In 2008, Roy Romer Middle School in Los Angeles was named after him and it was first opened to students in September of that year.

<doc id="746782" wikidata="Q4876098" url="?curid=746782" title="Beagling">
<text>Beagling is mainly the hunting of hares and rabbits by beagles using their strong sense of smell. A beagle pack (10 or more hounds) is usually followed on foot, but in a few cases mounted. Beagling is often enjoyed by &#x27;retired&#x27; fox hunters who have either sustained too many injuries or lost the agility to ride horseback, or who enjoy the outdoors and the camaraderie of the hunt. It is also traditionally a way for young men and women to learn how to handle hounds on a smaller scale before they go on to hunt with foxhounds.

==Quarry==
In the UK and Ireland, the traditional quarry of beagle packs has been the hare. In the UK, the brown hare was hunted, whereas in Ireland the Irish hare is hunted. It was estimated that before the Hunting Act 2004 beagle packs in the UK collectively caught 1,650 hares per season, meaning each pack caught 20 hares. That Act banned hare hunting in its traditional style, like fox hunting, in England and Wales. It bans the hunting of most wild mammals (including hares) with certain exemptions, which include the retrieval of hares that have been shot.

==People==
Hunts are managed very similarly to foxhound packs - generally governed by one or more Masters, who typically take much of the financial responsibility for the overall management of the hunt. A hunt will traditionally have a Huntsman, a full-time employee of the hunt, who is responsible (in conjunction with assistants, known as &quot;whippers-in&quot;) for directing and controlling the hounds during the course of the day.

The attire for traditional beagling on foot normally consists of a green coat and stockings, white breeches and a cap (similar in style to those worn when riding a horse), or a green flat cap. Many packs have a coloured collar to distinguish themselves from other packs. As with foxhounds a handful of packs have a different coloured uniform, either red or blue coats being worn, while in a few hunts the huntsman&#x27;s coat may be a different colour from those worn by the whippers in. Beagles generally have a higher pitched &quot;cry&quot; when hunting a line than foxhounds do.

== Beagling in the United States ==

Modern beagling is done both for hunt as well as sport. Organized clubs under the American Kennel Club track points in events called field trials. Dogs run as packs, often in groups of 5–8.

Presently, the Northeast Beagle Gundog Federation represents 39 clubs. The current president is Blaine Grove and the vice president is John Jarzynski.

== Beagle packs in the UK ==

At one time, many famous public schools and universities had packs of beagles. Now, however, only four schools (Eton, Radley, Stowe, and Marlborough) have a pack, whilst only three university packs remain (the Christ Church and Farley Hill Beagles of Oxford University, the Trinity Foot and South Herts Beagles of the University of Cambridge, and the Royal Agricultural University Beagles). Some packs of beagles also have associations with the British armed forces, such as the Purbeck and Bovington Beagles (Junior Leaders Regiment, Royal Armoured Corps); the Pimpernel (Royal Signals) Beagles; the Catterick Garrison Beagles; the Colchester Garrison Beagles (amalgamated with the Sproughton Foot Beagles in 1994 to form the Stour Valley Beagles); Per Ardua Beagles (RAF) and Britannia Beagles (Royal Navy). The harrier and beagle packs are represented by the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles (AMHB). There are currently over sixty packs of beagles registered with the Association based in England and Wales.

In the last thirty years there have been a number of amalgamations between packs, mostly brought about by the reduction in the amount of country available for hunting due to roads and associated urban development. This means that some packs, particularly in more built up areas of southern England, cover parts of several counties.

Following the 2004 Hunting Act, packs of beagles, bassets and harriers have switched to hunting artificial (rabbit or hare scent) pre-laid trails, hunting rabbits, flushing hares to guns or birds of prey or retrieval of injured hares following hare shoots (the last three are legal under exemptions within the Act).

==Other forms of hare hunting==

===Hunting with basset hounds===

In the United Kingdom, there are also a handful of basset hound packs, which formerly hunted hare. Despite being less thorough and &quot;checking&quot; less frequently, bassets work more slowly than beagles, but are admired by many for their strong and deep voice, and for their considerable stamina. They are more independent and headstrong hounds; it has been said that they hunt &quot;less as a pack, and more as a collection of like-minded individuals&quot;. Most packs have opted to breed the &#x27;English Basset&#x27;, which is considerably longer in the leg and lighter boned than the traditional variety. This gives them greater speed and endurance when hunting, but many also have a slightly higher pitch when speaking on a line (scent). The UK governing body for basset hound packs is the Masters of Basset Hounds Association (MBHA), separate from the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles.

===Hunting with Harriers===
Harriers are normally followed on horseback as the hounds, being larger than beagles, could push a hare faster and straighter, enabling a mounted following to pursue the hounds as in foxhunting.

====United Kingdom====
Most packs of hare hunting harriers in the last 30 years have been based in East Anglia, where hares have always been far more plentiful than foxes, and in the Pennines of Yorkshire and Lancashire.

At the start of the 20th century there were many more packs of harriers in the UK than beagles. The proportions are now reversed, largely because many packs of harriers have changed to hunting foxes over the last 80 years or so. In the south west of England some packs still hunt with West Country Harriers, although they hunted foxes rather than hares before the ban, while many current packs of foxhounds started off as hare hunting harrier packs.

Some packs in the first part of the 20th century used a heavier, more old-fashioned type of hound to hunt hares, and were followed on foot. This continued to some extent until the Second World War, while the last pack of foot harriers, the Windermere, which hunted in the Lake District, disbanded in the early 1990s. Some foot harrier packs disbanded, but many changed over to beagles as suitable harrier bloodlines died out.

In 2022 there are currently only 13 Harrier Packs (8 Stud Book, 5 West Country) meaning that there are now under 750 Harriers left in the UK and only 300 West Country Harriers left in the World.

====Ireland====
In Ireland there are more harrier packs than foxhound or beagle packs, with the greatest concentration in the south of the country. In Ireland a sub-species of the mountain hare is endemic and hunted in lieu of the European hare of Great Britain.

====New Zealand====
There are no land based mammals native to New Zealand; all species found there were introduced. The hare was introduced as a quarry species in 1851; the fox was never introduced, so there are no fox hunting packs in New Zealand; instead all hunts there are mounted hare hunts or drag hunts which hunt with harriers.

The first hounds to be brought to New Zealand were beagles, imported in 1868 by Governor George Grey. The first pack of harriers was imported in 1873, becoming the Pakuranga Hunt, followed by the Christchurch Hunt in 1880.

Today there are 28 packs of harriers in New Zealand; predominantly they are hare hunts, but the Waitemata Hunt is a drag hunt.

<doc id="746783" wikidata="Q140489" url="?curid=746783" title="153 Hilda">
<text>153 Hilda is a large asteroid in the outer main belt, with a diameter of 170 km. The spectrum matches that of a P-type asteroid. It was discovered by Johann Palisa on 2 November 1875, from the Austrian Naval Observatory at Pula, now Croatia. The name was chosen by the astronomer Theodor von Oppolzer, who named it after one of his daughters. It is the largest member of the hilda family, a collisional family of asteroids in the Hilda region.

== Orbit and family ==
Hilda gives its name to an asteroid group called the Hilda group (or &quot;Hildas&quot; for short). It is not a true asteroid family, since the members are not physically related, but rather share similar orbital elements. The Hildas are locked in a 2:3 orbital resonance with Jupiter; since Jupiter takes 11.9 years to orbit the Sun while Hilda takes 7.9 years, Jupiter orbits the Sun twice for every 3 orbits that Hilda completes. There are over 1,100 other objects known to be in a 2:3 resonance with Jupiter. The asteroid is, however, the largest member of the ancient physically related Hilda family within the dynamical group of the same name.

The orbital plane of 153 Hilda is inclined at an angle of 7.82° to the plane of the ecliptic. It has an orbital eccentricity (ovalness) of 0.13971. Multiple light curves of the asteroid provide a consistent rotation period of approximately

<text>Ocular synechia is an eye condition where the iris adheres to either the cornea (i.e. &quot;anterior synechia&quot;) or lens (i.e. &quot;posterior synechia&quot;). Synechiae can be caused by ocular trauma, iritis or iridocyclitis and may lead to certain types of glaucoma. It is sometimes visible on careful examination but usually more easily through an ophthalmoscope or slit-lamp.

Anterior synechia causes closed angle glaucoma, which means that the iris closes the drainage way of aqueous humour which in turn raises the intraocular pressure. Posterior synechia can be observed in cases of anterior uveitis secondary to severe to moderate bacterial keratitis. Posterior synechia also cause glaucoma, but with a different mechanism. In posterior synechia, the iris adheres to the lens, blocking the flow of aqueous humor from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber. This blocked drainage raises the intraocular pressure.

==Management==
Mydriatic or cycloplegic agents, such as topical homatropine, which is similar in action to atropine, are useful in breaking and preventing the formation of posterior synechia by keeping the iris dilated and away from the crystalline lens. Dilation of the pupil in an eye with synechia can cause the pupil to take an irregular, non-circular shape (dyscoria) as shown in the photograph. If the pupil can be fully dilated during the treatment of iritis, the prognosis for recovery from synechia is good. This is a treatable status.

To subdue inflammation, topical corticosteroids can be used. A prostaglandin analogue, such as travoprost, may be used if the intra-ocular pressure is elevated.

<text>A muleta is a stick with a red cloth hanging from it that is used in the final third (&quot;tercio de muleta&quot; or &quot;de muerte&quot;) of a bullfight. It is different from the cape used by the matador earlier in the fight (&quot;capote de brega&quot;). 

The muleta obscures the sword; and as in his earlier work with the cape, the bullfighter uses it to attract the bull in a series of passes, thus demonstrating his control over it. The red color of the muleta is actually irrelevant since bulls are dichromatic, meaning neither the cape nor the muleta color can be accurately discerned by the bull. The color is retained merely for tradition.

There are a number of distinct styles of pass, each with its own name. With the cape for instance, the verónica is a pass in which the matador slowly swings the cape away from the charging bull while keeping his feet in the same position. The faena is the final series of passes before the kill in which the matador uses the muleta to maneuver the bull into a position to stab it between its shoulders, cutting the aorta. If this fails, the matador must then cut the bull&#x27;s spinal cord with a second sword, killing it instantly. The task of killing the bull is given to the matador alone; his title means literally &quot;killer&quot;.

<text>III Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) is a formation of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force of the United States Marine Corps. It is forward-deployed and able to rapidly conduct operations across the spectrum from humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) to amphibious assault and high-intensity combat.

It maintains a forward presence in Japan and Asia to support the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan (1960) and other alliance relationships of the United States. III MEF also conducts combined operations and training throughout the region in support of the National Security Strategy for Theater Security Cooperation.

The Marines and sailors of III MEF engage in more than 65 combined, bilateral and multilateral training exercises annually throughout the Asia-Pacific region, in countries including treaty allies Japan, Thailand, South Korea, the Philippines, and Australia. These exercises build partner capacity, develop and maintain strong regional alliances and military-to-military contacts. These exercises prepare III MEF to conduct operations ranging from major combat operations to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.

III MEF has played a significant role in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions throughout the region. The MEF assisted the relief efforts led by the Government of Japan during Operation Tomodachi after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. III MEF also conducted HA/DR missions in Thailand in October 2011, the Philippines in October 2010, and Indonesia in October 2009. Most recently in response to the resulting humanitarian crisis from Typhoon Haiyan which struck the Philippines in 2013, III MEF activated as Joint Task Force 505 to conduct humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations in support of the Philippine government. More than 2,495 tons of relief supplies were delivered, and over 21,000 people were evacuated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lum/Margesson&quot;&gt;Lum and Margesson, &quot;Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda): U.S. and International Response to Philippines Disaster&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
Commanded by a lieutenant general with its headquarters at Camp Courtney, III MEF&#x27;s mission is to provide forward based and deployed forces to the commander, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, to conduct Phase 0 engagement and theater security cooperation events, support contingencies and emergent requirements, and prepare to rapidly execute existing operations plans in support of the theater and national military strategies.

III MEF is organized as a Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) to provide a rapidly deployable, flexible self-contained fighting force. The Marines combine air, ground, and logistics forces to operate as a coherent, self-sufficient force. Each mission dictates the MAGTF&#x27;s scale and structure, giving the Marine Corps the flexibility to respond to any crisis and making a &quot;force in readiness.&quot; A MEF is the largest of all MAGTFs.

==History==
III Marine Expeditionary Force was activated as I Amphibious Corps 1 October 1942 in Camp Elliott, San Diego, California. Later that month, they were deployed to Noumea, New Caledonia. The unit was redesignated as III Amphibious Corps 15 April 1944. III Amphibious Corps was deactivated on 10 June 1946.

III Marine Expeditionary Force was activated 6 May 1965 at Da Nang, Republic of Vietnam. III MEF was re-designated to III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF) 7 May 1965.

III Marine Amphibious Force deployed to Camp Courtney, Okinawa April 1971. III MAF was redesignated to III Marine Expeditionary Force 5 February 1988.

===World War II===
During World War II, III MEF was known as I Marine Amphibious Corps. It was renamed III Amphibious Corps on 15 April 1944, and took part in fighting against the Japanese Empire in the Pacific theater during World War II. It fought in some of the bloodiest battles, including the Solomon Islands campaign, the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the Volcano and Ryukyu Islands campaign (namely the Battle of Okinawa). III Amphibious Corps redeployed to Tianjin, China, in September 1945, where it participated in the occupation of Northern China until June 1946. III Amphibious Corps was deactivated on 10 June 1946.

===Vietnam War===
III MEF was reactivated 6 May 1965 in Da Nang, Republic of Vietnam under Major General William R. Collins. 7 May 1965, III MEF was re-designated as III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF) and consisted of the 1st Marine Division, 3rd Marine Division and the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. The III MAF&#x27;s area of operations was in the northern I Corps Tactical Zone. III MAF participated in the Vietnam War from May 1965 – April 1971 operating from Quang Tri, Thua Thien, Quang Nam, Quang Tin, and Quang Ngai. III MAF deployed to Camp Courtney, Okinawa in April 1971.

===1990s–2010s===
Since III MAF was redesignated to III Marine Expeditionary Force (III MEF) 5 February 1988, they have participated in many different operations. These operations include the Persian Gulf War&#x27;s Operation Desert Shield, Operation Desert Storm, as well as Operation Provide Comfort in Southwest Asia and Iraq from Sept. 1990 – April 1991 and May–June 1991. III MEF elements have also played a vital role in Operation Sea Angel in Bangladesh from May–June 1991; Operation Fiery Vigil in the Philippines June 1991; Operation Restore Hope and Operation Continue Hope in Somalia from December 1992 to March 1994. III MEF elements have also had a significant impact on the Iraq War&#x27;s Operation Iraqi Freedom as well as the Global War on Terrorism&#x27;s Enduring Freedom.

One of the biggest roles III MEF plays in the Asia-Pacific region is humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR). III MEF elements participated in Operation Unified Assistance in response to the tsunami disaster in Southeast Asia from December 2004 to February 2005. III MEF has also assisted with the 2005 Kashmir earthquake response from October 2005 to March 2006; Philippine mudslide response in March and April 2006; 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake response in May and June 2006; Legazpi typhoon recovery in March 2007; 2007 Solomon Islands earthquake and tsunami response in April 2007; Operation Sea Angel II in Bangladesh from November to December 2007; Operation Caring Response in Burma from May and June 2008; Taiwan typhoon relief in August 2009; Philippine typhoon and Indonesian earthquake relief in October 2009; Philippine typhoon relief in October 2010; Operation Tomodachi in May 2011; Thailand flood relief from October through November 2011; and Philippine typhoon relief in December 2012 and again in November 2013.

==III MEF Band==
As the Eastern Hemisphere’s sole musical representative of the United States Marine Corps, the III MEF Band enjoys a busy schedule filled with performances across Okinawa and the Indo-Pacific region each year. The band capitalizes on this unique position by making it a priority to present community outreach performances and by participating in bi-lateral engagements with partner and allied nations throughout Asia and the Pacific. Consisting of musicians trained in a variety of musical styles, the III MEF Band is able to provide a number of small ensembles for civilian events, including brass and woodwind quintets, jazz combo, rock band, and brass band. The band was awarded the title of &quot;2018 Marine Corps Band of the Year&quot; in February 2018. The III MEF Band was most recently award the &quot;2023 Colonel George S. Howard Citation of Musical Excellence for Military Concert Bands&quot;.

The following comprises the leadership of the band:

*Bandmaster – Master Gunnery Sergeant J. Michael Stanley
*Instrument Repair Technician – Gunnery Sergeant Mathew Medina
*Enlisted Conductor – Gunnery Sergeant Martin Arreola, Jr.
*Drum Major – Gunnery Sergeant Benjamin J. McNichol-Bernal
*Production Manager – Gunnery Sergeant Joshua W. Waldie

Uniquely, the band used to have its own mascot. The history of the use of a mascot dates back to 1974, when the Commanding General of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing presented a Golden Retriever to the 1st MAW Band. Since then, the 1st MAW and 3D MARDIV Bands combined to form the III MEF Band and five mascots have served the unit. Since November of 2012, Sgt Chopper V continued this unique tradition and retired in 2024 after serving the Marines of the III MEF Band faithfully and honorably.

<text>Donald Drake Hogestyn (; September 29, 1953 – September 28, 2024) was an American actor best known for his long-running role as John Black on the American soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

== Early life ==
Hogestyn was born on September 29, 1953, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where he graduated from North Side High School. He attended the University of South Florida in Tampa on a baseball scholarship, majoring in pre-dentistry. He graduated with a double major in microbiology and applied sciences. He was then drafted by two professional baseball organizations: the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Yankees. Hogestyn signed with the Yankees and played third base for one of their farm teams until he was injured in 1977.

== Career ==
Hogestyn began his acting career by entering a Columbia Pictures talent search that included 75,000 people. Hogestyn was among the 30 selected, and his first starring role was on the prime time series &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;. After a few minor roles (one as Kort, leader of the Micro Workers in the episode &#x27;Princess Metra&#x27; on the 80s television series &quot;Otherworld&quot;), Hogestyn joined the cast of &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; in 1986. He initially played a mystery man referred to simply as &quot;The Pawn.&quot; However, it was soon revealed The Pawn was the presumed dead Roman Brady. Hogestyn quickly became a fan favorite and enjoyed many pairings, the most popular of which was with longtime co-star Deidre Hall. In 1998, while starring on &quot;Days&quot;, Shelley Long enlisted Hogestyn to join her for the upcoming series &quot;Kelly, Kelly&quot;. He was set to star in both until the filming of the pilot episode of &quot;Kelly, Kelly&quot; conflicted with his schedule on &quot;Days&quot;, and the role went to Robert Hays.

In 1991, Wayne Northrop agreed to return to &quot;Days&quot; to reprise his role of Roman. In order to keep both actors on the show, Drake&#x27;s story was retconned, and his past was rewritten. Despite this change, Hogestyn remained one of the show&#x27;s most popular actors. The pairing of John Black and Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall) is one of the show&#x27;s enduring supercouples.

In November 2008, it was announced Hogestyn, along with Hall, had been fired from &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, with budget cuts cited as reason for their exits. In July 2011, it was announced Hogestyn and Hall would reprise their roles as John and Marlena, respectively, in an attempt to &quot;refresh&quot; the soap. Hogestyn made his final appearance in the role during the episode released on September 9, 2024, due to the soap&#x27;s advanced taping schedule and his death on September 28 of the same year.

== Personal life and death ==
Hogestyn and his wife Victoria had four children.

Hogestyn died from pancreatic cancer at his home in Malibu, California, on September 28, 2024.

<text>154 Bertha is a main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by the French brothers Paul Henry and Prosper Henry on 4 November 1875, but the credit for the discovery was given to Prosper. It is probably named after Berthe Martin-Flammarion, sister of the astronomer Camille Flammarion.

Observations performed at the Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado Springs, Colorado in during 2007 produced a light curve with a period of 22.30 ± 0.03 hours and a brightness range of 0.10 ± 0.02 in magnitude. A 1998 measurement gave a value of 27.6 hours, which doesn&#x27;t fit the PDO data. In 2011, observations from the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico were used to determine a rotation period of 25.224 ± 0.002 hours with a brightness variability of 0.10 ± 0.01 magnitude, ruling out previous studies.

This is classified as a C-type asteroid and it has an estimated diameter of about 187 km.

<doc id="746821" wikidata="Q603244" url="?curid=746821" title="Thyroglossal duct">
<text>The thyroglossal duct is an embryological anatomical structure forming an open connection between the initial area of development of the thyroid gland and its final position. It is located exactly mid-line, between the anterior 2/3 and posterior 1/3 of the tongue.

The thyroid gland starts developing in the oropharynx in the fetus and descends to its final position taking a path through the tongue, hyoid bone and neck muscles. The connection between its original position and its final position is the thyroglossal duct. This duct normally atrophies and closes off as the foramen cecum before birth but can remain open in some people.

==Clinical significance==
A thyroglossal duct that fails to atrophy is called a persistent thyroglossal duct, a condition that may lead to the formation of a thyroglossal duct cyst.

<text>StarLogo is an agent-based simulation language developed by Mitchel Resnick, Eric Klopfer, and others at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab and Scheller Teacher Education Program in Massachusetts. It is an extension of the Logo programming language, a dialect of Lisp. Designed for education, StarLogo can be used by students to model or simulate the behavior of decentralized systems.

The first StarLogo ran on a Connection Machine 2 parallel computer. A subsequent version ran on Macintosh computers. It was later renamed MacStarLogo, and now is named MacStarLogo Classic. The current StarLogo is written in the language Java and works on most computers.

StarLogo is also available in a version named &quot;OpenStarLogo&quot;. Its source code is available online, but the license under which it is released is not an open-source license according to The Open Source Definition, because of restrictions on the commercial use of the code.

==TNG version==
&quot;StarLogo TNG&quot; (The Next Generation) version 1.0 was released in July 2008. It provides a 3D world using OpenGL graphics and a block-based graphical language to increase ease of use and learnability. It is written in C and Java. StarLogo TNG uses &quot;blocks&quot; to put together puzzle-like pieces. StarLogo TNG reads the blocks in the order that they fit together, and sets the program in the Spaceland view.

StarLogo is a primary influence for the &quot;Kedama&quot; particle system, programmed by Yoshiki Oshima, found in the Etoys educational programming environment and language, which can be viewed as a Logo done originally in Squeak Smalltalk.

==Nova version==
The latest version of StarLogo, &quot;StarLogo Nova&quot;, was released in beta form in the summer of 2014. StarLogo Nova takes the blocks language and 3D visualization engine of StarLogo TNG and brings them to the web browser. StarLogo Nova&#x27;s execution engine is built on the Adobe Flash runtime and includes a purpose-built instancing rendering engine, using the Adobe Molehill 3D graphics application programming interface (API), able to render tens of thousands of independently moving agents on current hardware. The programming area is built on ScriptBlocks, a JavaScript-based blocks library. As of 2019, StarLogo Nova under development by the MIT Scheller Teacher Education Program, directed by Eric Klopfer, with lead designer and developer Daniel Wendel.

StarLogo Nova introduces several notable design changes relative to TNG, particularly with the introduction of a &quot;World&quot; agent, reminiscent of StarLogo 2.2&#x27;s &quot;Observer&quot;. In StarLogo Nova, any command can be run by any agent, but each &quot;breed&quot; has its own program and can have its own set of breed-specific &quot;traits&quot;. This brings StarLogo Nova closer to an object-oriented programming design, in an effort to improve the ease with which students can transfer skills in StarLogo Nova to other, more mainstream languages. Other changes include the use of embedded arguments for blocks (similar to the language Scratch), &quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot; (WYSIWYG) editing of the simulation interface, and splitting the collision primitive into its component halves, with each breed having collision code on its own program page.

<text>Mark Andrew Consuelos (; born March 30, 1971) is an American actor and talk show host. He rose to prominence as a television actor on the ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; for his portrayal of Mateo Santos (1995–2002, 2010), and subsequently as Hiram Lodge on The CW drama &quot;Riverdale&quot; (2017–2023). Consuelos currently co-hosts the daytime talk show &quot;Live with Kelly and Mark&quot; with his wife Kelly Ripa.

==Early life==
Mark Consuelos was born in Zaragoza, Spain, to an Italian mother, Camilla, and a Mexican father, Saul Consuelos. He is the youngest of three children: he has one older brother, who is a doctor, and one older sister, who is a lawyer. Consuelos was raised in Italy and the United States since childhood, growing up in Lebanon, Illinois, and later in Brandon, Florida. He attended Bloomingdale Senior High School in Valrico, Florida, and then went to University of Notre Dame before transferring to and graduating from the University of South Florida with a degree in marketing in 1994.

==Career==
Consuelos had a starring role in the educational serial &quot;Connect With English&quot;, which aired on public television stations as part of the Annenberg/CPB Project.

In the early 1990s, Consuelos was a dancer with the Suncoast Calendar Men, based in Clearwater, Florida. He left in 1995 when he got the part on &quot;All My Children&quot;.

In February 1995, Consuelos had his breakthrough when he landed the role of Mateo Santos on the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. There, he fell in love with his on-screen love interest Kelly Ripa, and secretly married her in Las Vegas, in May 1996. At the time, he lived on co-star Winsor Harmon&#x27;s sofa; Harmon was one of the few to know that co-stars Ripa and Consuelos were not only dating, but married.

Ripa and Consuelos continued to tape episodes of &quot;All My Children&quot; until 2002, when Ripa wished to focus more on her other job: taking over for Kathie Lee Gifford as host of what then became &quot;Live! with Regis and Kelly&quot; (later known as &quot;Live! with Kelly&quot;, and subsequently as &quot;Live! with Kelly and Michael&quot; and even later became &quot;Live with Kelly and Ryan&quot;). Consuelos was a regular guest co-host. On April 17, 2023, Consuelos became the regular co-host, and the show was renamed &quot;Live! with Kelly and Mark&quot;.

Since leaving &quot;All My Children&quot;, Consuelos has starred in the feature film &quot;The Great Raid&quot;, which debuted in theatres in 2005. In 2006, he appeared in the movies &quot;My Super Ex-Girlfriend&quot;, as Steve, and &quot;Wedding Daze&quot;. He has been seen on the Lifetime series &quot;Missing&quot;, with Vivica A. Fox. He also had a part in &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;.

Consuelos hosted two reality dating shows, &quot;Age of Love&quot; and &quot;Science of Love&quot;, both airing on NBC in 2007. He guest-starred on &quot;Third Watch&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;American Family,&quot; &quot;Fortune Hunter&quot;, &quot;SeaQuest&quot; and &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot;.

A weekly live episode of the &quot;Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; premiered in the show&#x27;s 23rd season with a panel consisting of Mark Consuelos, Ali Wentworth, Oprah Winfrey, and Gayle King. The panel discussed the week&#x27;s news and highlighted events in the media and on the show.
In the 2009–10 season, Winfrey hosted this segment on her own. Fridays Live did not return for the show&#x27;s 25th season.

In 2010, Consuelos attended the &quot;Cop Out&quot; premiere in New York where he had a pleasant conversation with Bryan Johnson in view of a spying Walt Flanagan.

In 2012, Consuelos guest-starred on an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; titled &quot;Justice Denied&quot;. He played Michael, the prime suspect in a brutal rape during Fleet Week. Consuelos is not new to the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise, he had guest-starred in the sixth-season episode &quot;Albatross&quot; of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; as the U.S. Attorney involved in a case where the judge&#x27;s life is threatened.

Consuelos portrayed Spivey, a recurring character, in &quot;American Horror Story: Asylum&quot;, the second season of the anthology horror series.

In 2013, Consuelos co-starred as Florida Senator Andy Guzman in Amazon&#x27;s &quot;Alpha House&quot;, a political comedy written by &quot;Doonesbury&quot; creator Garry Trudeau. Along with John Goodman, Consuelos plays one of four Republican senators living together in a house on Capitol Hill. He has spent the summer of 2014 filming the second season.

In 2016, Consuelos landed a role on a new FOX series, &quot;Pitch&quot;, as Oscar Arguella.

In 2017, Consuelos was cast in the series regular role of Hiram Lodge on The CW drama &quot;Riverdale&quot;. His oldest son, Michael Consuelos, plays a younger Hiram Lodge starting on the third season. His final episode as a series regular was the fifth season finale, departing after four seasons.

On February 16, 2023, Consuelos was announced as Ryan Seacrest&#x27;s successor as co-host of &quot;Live&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1995, Consuelos met Kelly Ripa, his co-star on &quot;All My Children&quot;. The two eloped on May 1, 1996. The couple have three children: Michael Joseph (born June 2, 1997), Lola Grace (born June 16, 2001) and Joaquin Antonio (born February 24, 2003).

On October 3, 2008, he performed the marriage ceremony for Howard Stern and model/actress Beth Ostrosky at the Le Cirque restaurant in New York City. The two couples had grown close, which was why Stern asked Consuelos to officiate. Consuelos agreed, and took it upon himself to seek ordination to make it an official ceremony for Stern and Ostrosky. The guest list for the wedding included Joan Rivers, Barbara Walters, Chevy Chase, Billy Joel and wife Katie Lee, Jimmy Kimmel, Sarah Silverman, and Stern&#x27;s radio co-host Robin Quivers.

For many years, Consuelos and Ripa lived on Crosby Street in SoHo, Manhattan. They sold the apartment in 2015 for $20 million and moved to a townhouse on East 76th Street. They had bought the townhouse in 2013, though it was never officially listed on the market, from fashion designer Luca Orlandi and his wife, Oluchi Onweagba, for $27 million, making it the second-most expensive townhouse sold in New York City that year.

==Awards and honors==
In 1998 and 1999, Consuelos won the American Latino Media Arts Award for &quot;Outstanding Actor in a Daytime Soap Opera.&quot; Consuelos won &quot;Hottest Romance&quot; along with Ripa in 1997 at the Soap Opera Awards. He also won the Teen&#x27;s Choice Award for Choice TV Villain in 2018.

<doc id="746832" wikidata="Q502785" url="?curid=746832" title="Thyroglossal cyst">
<text>A thyroglossal cyst or thyroglossal duct cyst is a fibrous cyst that forms from a persistent thyroglossal duct. Thyroglossal cysts can be defined as an irregular neck mass or a lump which develops from cells and tissues left over after the formation of the thyroid gland during developmental stages.

Thyroglossal cysts are the most common cause of midline neck masses and are generally located caudal to (below) the hyoid bone. These neck masses can occur anywhere along the path of the thyroglossal duct, from the base of the tongue to the suprasternal notch. Other common causes of midline neck masses include lymphadenopathy, dermoid cysts, and various odontogenic anomalies.

Thyroglossal cysts develop at birth. Many diagnostic procedures may be used to establish the degree of the cyst.

==Signs and symptoms==
Thyroglossal duct cysts most often present with a palpable asymptomatic midline neck mass usually below [65% of the time] the level of the hyoid bone. The mass on the neck moves during swallowing or on protrusion of the tongue because of its attachment to the tongue via the tract of thyroid descent. Some patients will have neck or throat pain, or dysphagia.

The persistent duct or sinus can promote oral secretions, which may cause cysts to become infected. Up to half of thyroglossal cysts are not diagnosed until adult life. The tract can lie dormant for years or even decades, until some kind of stimulus leads to cystic dilation. Infection can sometimes cause the transient appearance of a mass or enlargement of the cyst, at times with periodic recurrences. Spontaneous drainage may also occur. Differential diagnosis are ectopic thyroid, enlarged lymph nodes, dermoid cysts and goiter.

Thyroglossal cyst usually presents as a midline neck lump (in the region of the hyoid bone) that is usually painless, smooth and cystic, though if infected, pain can occur. There may be difficulty breathing, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), or dyspepsia (discomfort in the upper abdomen), especially if the cyst becomes large.

The most common location for a thyroglossal cyst is midline or slightly off midline, between the isthmus of the thyroid and the hyoid bone or just above the hyoid bone. A thyroglossal cyst can develop anywhere along a thyroglossal duct, though cysts within the tongue or in the floor of the mouth are rare.A thyroglossal cyst will move upwards with protrusion of the tongue.Thyroglossal cysts are associated with an increased incidence of ectopic thyroid tissue. Occasionally, a lingual thyroid can be seen as a flattened strawberry-like lump at the base of the tongue.

=== Complications ===

==== Infection ====
An infected thyroglossal duct cyst can occur when it is left untreated for a certain amount of time or simply when a thyroglossal duct cyst hasn&#x27;t been suspected. The degree of infection can be examined as major rim enhancement has occurred, located inferior to the hyoid bone. Soft tissue swelling occurs, along with airway obstruction and trouble swallowing, due to the rapid enlargement of the cyst. With infections, there can be rare cases where an expression of fluid is projected into the pharynx causing other problems within the neck.
==== Thyroglossal Fistula ====

A thyroglossal duct cyst may rupture unexpectedly, resulting in a draining sinus known as a thyroglossal fistula. Thyroglossal fistula can develop when the removal of the cyst has not been fully completed. This is usually noticed when bleeding in the neck occurs, causing swelling and fluid ejection around the original wound of removal.

==== Thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma ====

Rarely (in less than 1% of cases), cancer may be present in a thyroglossal duct cyst. These tumors are generally papillary thyroid carcinomas, arising from the ectopic thyroid tissue within the cyst.

== Causes ==

Thyroglossal Duct Cysts are a birth defect. During embryonic development, the thyroid gland is being formed, beginning at the base of the tongue and moving towards the neck canal, known as the thyroglossal duct. Once the thyroid reaches its final position in the neck, the duct normally disappears. In some individuals, portions of the duct remain behind, leaving small pockets, known as cysts. During a person&#x27;s life, these cyst pockets can fill with fluids and mucus, enlarging when infected, presenting the thyroglossal cyst.

==Embryology==
The thyroglossal tract arises from the foramen cecum at the junction of the anterior two-thirds and posterior one-third of the tongue. Any part of the tract can persist, causing a sinus, fistula or cyst. Most fistulae are acquired following rupture or incision of the infected thyroglossal cyst. A thyroglossal cyst is lined by pseudostratified, ciliated columnar epithelium while a thyroglossal fistula is lined by columnar epithelium.

== Diagnosis ==

Diagnosis of a thyroglossal duct cyst requires a medical professional, and is usually done by a physical examination. It is important to identify whether or not the thyroglossal cyst contains any thyroid tissue, as it can define the degree of cyst that is being dealt with.

Diagnostic procedures for a thyroglossal cyst include:
===Clinical features===
Clinical features can be found in the subhyoid portion of the tract and 75% present as midline swellings. The remainder can be found as far lateral as the lateral tip of the hyoid bone.

Typically, the cyst will move upwards on protrusion of the tongue, given its attachment to the embryonic duct, as well as on swallowing, due to attachment of the tract to the foramen caecum.

==Treatment==
Although generally benign, the cyst must be removed if the patient exhibits difficulty in breathing or swallowing, or if the cyst is infected. Even if these symptoms are not present, the cyst may be removed to eliminate the chance of infection or development of a carcinoma,

Thyroid scans and thyroid function studies are ordered preoperatively; this is important to demonstrate that normally functioning thyroid tissue is in its usual area.

Surgical management options include the Sistrunk procedure, en bloc central neck dissection, suture-guided transhyoid pharyngotomy, and Koempel&#x27;s supra-hyoid technique. Cystectomy is an inadequate approach.

=== Sistrunk Procedure ===
The Sistrunk procedure is the surgical resection of the central portion of the hyoid bone along with a wide core of tissue from the midline area between the hyoid and foramen cecum. It involves excision not only of the cyst but also of the path&#x27;s tract and branches, and removal of the central portion of the hyoid bone is indicated to ensure complete removal of the tract. The original Sistrunk papers (the &quot;classic&quot; procedure described in 1920, and the &quot;modified&quot; procedure described in 1928) are available on-line with a modern commentary.

In general, the procedure consists of three steps:
# incision
# resection of cyst and hyoid bone
# drainage and closure

There are several versions of the Sistrunk procedure, including:
* &quot;classic&quot;: excision of the center of the hyoid bone along with a thyroglossal duct cyst, removal of one-eighth inch diameter core of tongue muscle superior to the hyoid at a 45-degree angle up to the foramen cecum to include mucosa, removal of one-quarter inch of the center of the hyoid bone, closure of the cut ends of the hyoid bone, and placement of a drain.
* modified: dissection through the tongue base but not through the mucosa. The modified Sistrunk procedure is the procedure of choice in both primary and revision cases.
* hyoid cartilage division: In cases without mature ossification of the hyoid bone, the non-fused cartilage portion can be divided by monopolar Bovie electro-cauterization or scissors. There were no statistical differences between this modified Sistrunk and the conventional Sistrunk procedure.
The procedure is relatively safe. In a study of 35 pediatric patients, Maddalozzo et al. found no major complications, but did observe minor complications (6 patients presented with seroma and 4 patients with local wound infections). A more recent paper analyzed 24 research studies on different treatment complications of thyroglossal cyst, and reported a total minor complications rate of 6% for the Sistrunk operation (classical or modified) and simple cystectomy treatment modalities. The Sistrunk procedure also showed better outcomes concerning the rate of overall recurrence, i.e. has the lowest rate of recurrence.

Sistrunk procedure results in a 95% cure rate and 95–100% long-term survival.

== Epidemiology ==

# 90% of cases are presented in children before the age of 10 
# 70% of neck anomalies are from Thyroglossal cysts 
# Thyroglossal Duct Cysts are the second most common neck abnormalities after lymphadenopathy
# A person can live with a Thyroglossal Duct Cyst without any problems, until a pathology develops.
# Approximately 7% of the population has thyroglossal duct remnants 
# Thyroglossal duct carcinoma occurs in approximately 1 to 2% of Thyroglossal cyst cases.

<text>George Whale (7 December 1842 – 7 March 1910) was an English locomotive engineer who was born in Bocking, Essex, and educated in Lewisham, London. He worked for the London and North Western Railway (LNWR).

==Career==

In 1858 he entered the LNWR&#x27;s Wolverton Works under James Edward McConnell, and when in 1862 the LNWR Board decided to concentrate locomotive construction and repair at Crewe Works under John Ramsbottom, Whale was one of around 400 workers transferred from Wolverton to Crewe. In 1865 he entered the drawing office at Crewe Works, and in 1867 joined the LNWR running department under J. Rigg. In 1898 he was made responsible for the running of all LNWR locomotives.

Francis William Webb, the LNWR Locomotive Superintendent, gave twelve months notice of retirement to the LNWR Board in November 1902. On 22 April 1903, the Board announced that Whale had been chosen to succeed Webb, who was to retire at the end of July 1903. Webb&#x27;s health was failing, and Whale soon took up some of his duties, and began signing official documents on 25 May; by 30 May, Webb was too ill to work.

Webb&#x27;s compound locomotives were generally considered a failure and Whale commenced the programme of converting some of these to simple-expansion locomotives, and replacing others. In 1904 he introduced the 4-4-0 &quot;Precursor&quot; class, an entirely new design which was in production within nine months of Whale&#x27;s appointment; by June 1906, there were 110 in service. The &quot;Precursors&quot; were able to keep time when handling greater loads than their predecessors. They were followed by the 4-6-0 &quot;Experiment&quot; class, and these two formed the basis for several subsequent LNWR locomotive classes.

===Locomotives===
Whale introduced four new classes of locomotive; a fifth design was ordered by Whale but not delivered until after his retirement.

The &quot;Precursor&quot; class was developed by C.J. Bowen Cooke into the &quot;George the Fifth&quot; and &quot;Queen Mary&quot; classes, whilst the &quot;Experiment&quot; class was developed by Bowen Cooke into the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; class.

Webb had built 282 freight locomotives of the 0-8-0 wheel arrangement. All except the first one were compounds, which were of two types: there were 111 with two high-pressure cylinders outside the frames and a single low-pressure cylinder between the frames, which were known as Class A from 1911; and there were 170 with two outside high-pressure cylinders and two inside low-pressure cylinders, which were later known as Class B. Production ended in August 1904, over a year after Whale had succeeded Webb.

Whale began rebuilding the Webb 0-8-0s in August 1904, and the alterations took several forms. The first to appear were converted from Class B, which Whale considered to have an excessive front overhang: the principal change was the addition of a pony truck, making a 2-8-0; they remained as four-cylinder compounds, and between August 1904 and October 1908, 36 locomotives were converted. 26 of these retained their original boilers and were later designated Class E; ten of those converted from May 1906 were provided with larger boilers (of the type used on the &quot;Experiment&quot; class) and were later designated Class F. Two of those initially converted to Class E were later given the larger boiler, and joined Class F.

The next conversions were from Class A, and were rebuilt as simples, retaining the 0-8-0 wheel arrangement: two inside cylinders were fitted in place of the original centre cylinder, and the outside cylinders were removed. Between November 1904 and March 1906, 15 locomotives were converted, using cylinders of diameter; these retained their original boilers and were later designated Class C. Between March 1906 and March 1909, 62 locomotives were converted, these were also given cylinders but were provided with larger (&quot;Experiment&quot; class) boilers and were later designated Class D. In December 1906 the original Webb 0-8-0, no. 2524 (which had never been a compound) was also given a large boiler and joined Class D. From March 1909 until September 1912, the last 34 conversions from Class A again retained their original boilers, but the new cylinders were of diameter; they were later designated Class C1.

From November 1906, rebuilding of Class B as 0-8-0 simples began. The outside high-pressure cylinders were removed, whilst the former low-pressure inside cylinders were retained. Large (&quot;Experiment&quot; class) boilers were fitted, and these were later designated Class G. Conversions to Class G continued until June 1917, by which time 32 had been rebuilt; a further 60 to this design were built new between January and September 1910.

==Retirement and death==
Whale&#x27;s retirement was announced at the end of 1908, and on 1 March 1909, C.J. Bowen Cooke became Chief Mechanical Engineer. Whale died at Hove, Sussex on 7 March 1910, aged 67. Bowen Cooke named two of his 4-4-0 &quot;Queen Mary&quot; class locomotives after his predecessors: no. 238 &quot;F.W. Webb&quot; and no. 896 &quot;George Whale&quot; both entered service in October 1910. The latter was rebuilt to the &quot;George the Fifth&quot; class in January 1914, became LMS no. 5332 in November 1926, was allotted no. 25332 in 1934 (which was never applied), and was withdrawn on 29 February 1936.

<text>Hoelderlin were a German progressive rock band that was formed in 1970 as Hölderlin by brothers Joachim and Christian von Grumbkow with Nanny de Ruig, whom Christian was married to. They were influenced by rock, jazz, and folk music. 

== History ==

The group started out as a folk group, but after the release of their first album in 1972 and the departure of Nanny in 1973, the group began to change musical direction, incorporating jazz and rock. They changed their name to Hoelderlin in 1973 and took legal action against Rolf-Ulrich Kaiser, the head and founder of the label Pilz, which eventually led to the record label going out of business. In 1975 they got a new record contract with the label Spiegelei and released their second album the same year. After the release of three more albums, almost all of the founding members left the group, leaving Joachim to be the only remaining founding member. This led to both a significant change in lineup and another significant change in musical direction. The group was introduced to Dave Hutchins, who was an engineer for the Genesis album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and subsequently decided to develop an anglo-american commercial sound that later resulted in two more albums before their split in 1980. The album Fata Morgana was then put together and released by Spiegelei the following year. The group reunited in 2005 with only Hans Bäär and Michael Bruchmann as former members. However, Christoph and Nanny made special guest appearances for a few of their subsequent performances. Upon the release of their eighth album, the group then split up again in 2009.

<text>155 Scylla is a main belt asteroid. It was discovered by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at the Austrian Naval Observatory on 8 November 1875, and named after the monster Scylla in Greek mythology. Two weeks after its discovery this asteroid became lost and was not recovered for 95 years. It was finally found by Paul Wild of Berne, Switzerland with the aid of an ephemeris created in 1970 by Conrad M. Bardwell at Cincinnati Observatory.

Photometric observations of this asteroid during 2008 at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico, gave an asymmetrical, bimodal light curve with a period of 7.9597 ± 0.0001 hours and a brightness variation of 0.46 ± 0.03 in magnitude.

<text>Cliffhanger is a 1993 American action thriller film directed and co-produced by Renny Harlin and co-written by and starring Sylvester Stallone alongside John Lithgow, Michael Rooker and Janine Turner. Based on a concept by climber John Long, the film follows Gabe (Stallone), a mountain climber who becomes embroiled in a heist of a U.S. Treasury plane flying through the Rocky Mountains.

The film premiered at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival, and was released in the United States on May 28, 1993, by TriStar Pictures. It received generally positive reviews and earned $255 million worldwide, becoming the 7th highest-grossing film of 1993. It was the last film to use the 1984–1993 TriStar Pictures logo.

== Plot ==

Mountain rescue rangers Gabe Walker, his girlfriend Jessie Deighan, and Frank attempt to rescue their fellow ranger, Hal Tucker, and his girlfriend, Sarah, stranded in the Colorado Rockies. Sarah&#x27;s harness breaks loose and she falls to her death, and Hal blames a guilt-stricken Gabe, who leaves the ranger service.

Eight months later, Gabe returns to collect his belongings and to persuade Jessie to leave with him. Meanwhile, psychopathic former military intelligence operative Eric Qualen orchestrates the robbery of over $100 million in three suitcases of uncirculated bills. Turncoat U.S. Treasury agent Richard Travers hijacks the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 carrying the money, shooting his team members and attempting to transfer the cases in midair to Qualen and his team of mercenaries aboard a Lockheed JetStar. One of the wounded agents shoots at the thieves before the DC-9 is blown up, forcing the JetStar to crash land in the Rockies and scattering the cases across the mountainside.

Hal remains bitter over Sarah&#x27;s death, and responds to a fake distress call from the mercenaries, while Jessie convinces Gabe to help. He and Hal are taken prisoner by Qualen, Travers, and their accomplices Kristel, Kynette, Delmar, Ryan, and Heldon. Using Travers&#x27; beacon locator, Hal and Gabe are ordered to track down the first case atop a steep rock face. Gabe is tethered and forced to climb and retrieve the case, but Hal warns that Qualen will kill him, and Gabe severs his rope before he can be yanked down. Heldon opens fire and is killed by the ensuing avalanche, which leads Qualen to believe the case is lost and Gabe is dead.

While Hal is forced to lead the mercenaries onward, Gabe races ahead and finds Jessie at an old ranger station. They recover mountaineering gear and reach the second case before Qualen arrives at nightfall, burning the money to stay warm and leaving him a taunting message, &quot;Want to trade?&quot; Using night-vision goggles, Ryan spots Gabe and Jessie, but Gabe blinds him with a flare and the two slide down a slope, Ryan careens over the edge a cliff to his death in a gorge. The next morning, Gabe and Jessie race to beat Qualen to the last case, while Hal tries to warn away two young climbers, Evan and Brett, before Qualen&#x27;s men open fire. Brett is killed, but a wounded Evan base jumps off the mountain and parachutes to safety.

Frank, scouting the mountain by helicopter in search of his friends, rescues Evan. Kynette confronts Gabe in a brutal fistfight in a cave, but Gabe impales him on a stalactite. Hal alerts him that the gang has rigged explosives above the cave, and Gabe and Jessie narrowly escape. The mercenaries flag down Frank in his rescue helicopter, and Delmar fatally shoots him. When Travers attempts to betray the others, Qualen forces him to stay by killing Kristel, leaving Qualen as their only pilot.

As the mercenaries split up to look for the last case, Hal stabs Delmar in his right leg with Frank&#x27;s knife, then kills Delmar with his shotgun and escapes, while Gabe recovers the money from the last case. He plants the tracking beacon on a rabbit to frustrate an increasingly unhinged Travers, who rants at Qualen by walkie-talkie, allowing the authorities to track their position. Pursued by Travers, Gabe falls into a frozen river but kills Travers through the ice with a climbing-bolt gun, and is rescued by Hal.

Jessie signals to the rescue helicopter, believing it to be Frank, and is taken hostage by Qualen, who demands that Gabe and Hal surrender the money. Meeting high atop the cliffs, Qualen frees Jessie, but Gabe throws the bag of money into the helicopter&#x27;s rotor blades, shredding the cash, and tethers the helicopter&#x27;s winch cable to a cliffside ladder. Hal helps shoot down the helicopter, which hangs over the cliff with Gabe and Qualen atop the wreckage. Gabe fights off Qualen and climbs to safety as the wreckage falls off the cliff, killing Qualen. The authorities arrive as Gabe reunites with Jessie and Hal.

== Production ==
=== Development and writing ===
Carolco Pictures had originally signed Sylvester Stallone to appear opposite John Candy in a comedy about feuding neighbors titled &quot;Bartholomew vs. Neff&quot;, which was going to be written and directed by John Hughes. When that project was dropped, Stallone became involved in two other Carolco projects.

The first one was the futuristic science-fiction horror film &quot;Isobar&quot;, which was about a genetically-created monster who breaks free on a high-speed runaway train: between 1987, when Carolco first bought the original script by Jim Uhls for $400,000, and 1991, directors Ridley Scott and Roland Emmerich were each at different points in time attached to direct the film which would have had a $90 million budget with Stallone and Kim Basinger playing the main roles; however, due to disagreements between them and Carolco and producer Joel Silver about the script changes and lack of artistic freedom, both Scott and Emmerich gave up on the project, which in the end was cancelled.

The second Carolco project in which Stallone was involved was an action disaster thriller entitled &quot;Gale Force&quot;, described as &quot;&quot;Die Hard&quot; in a hurricane&quot;, which Renny Harlin was going to direct, and in which Stallone would play an ex-Navy SEAL who has to fight against a group of modern pirates who attack a coastal town during a large, catastrophic hurricane. The first version of the script for the film was written by David Chappe in 1984, who then wrote six more drafts between 1987 and 1989, and after his final draft received some praise and following the bidding war between several studios for it in 1989, Carolco bought his final draft for $500,000, with a promise of an additional $200,000 if the movie were made. Harlin was paid $3 million for directing the film, but because his contract also gave him full control of the project, he demanded many re-writes of the script to, amongst other things, increase the number of action sequences and make them bigger. Between 1990 and 1991 while they were working on the project, Carolco spent over $4 million on all the different screenwriters and versions of the script. One of the screenwriters who worked on it, Joe Eszterhas, was paid $500,000 to write his version. He re-wrote it as an erotic thriller, similar to his previous screenplays, so it was rejected.

Carolco, believing the intended $40 million budget would be too big, and unable to figure out how to make special effects for the film, cancelled that project two weeks before production was supposed to begin; but Harlin still kept his $3 million, and he and Stallone and everyone else involved in it then moved on to &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, another Carolco project, which had a budget of $70 million, almost double that of &quot;Gale Force&quot;.

Harlin wanted David Bowie and Bryan Ferry for the role of Qualen, scheduling problems prevented Bowie from taking it, and the role eventually went to John Lithgow.

Reviewers have suggested that the 1956 dramatic film &quot;The Mountain&quot; provided some of the inspiration for &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, which has multiple similarities.

Before production began, Stallone rewrote Michael France&#x27;s script: his work changed the film significantly enough that Carolco petitioned the Writers Guild of America for him to get credit.

Half of the film&#x27;s budget was provided by TriStar Pictures in exchange for distribution rights in North America, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, and France. Seed funding was provided by Carolco shareholders Rizzoli-Corriere della Sera, Le Studio Canal+, and Pioneer Electric Corporation. The balance of the production costs were obtained through a production loan provided by a syndicate of banks led by Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland (CLBN). The credit of US$46,553,000 was, at the time, one of the largest project loan facilities ever to be made for the production of an independent film, and was fully repaid from the movie’s distribution proceeds.

The financing arrangement was the result of Carolco&#x27;s serious debt issues, and as a result, Carolco would ultimately receive very little of the box office gross. During principal photography, production was shut down twice when Carolco could not afford to pay the crew; the movie went $40 million over budget. Stallone reportedly had to forego $2 million of his $15 million salary as a result.

=== Filming ===
The large majority of the film&#x27;s scenes were shot in the Dolomites in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy. For example, the bridge scene was shot on Monte Cristallo in the via ferrata VF Ivano Dibona, which was reconstructed immediately after the movie. The climbing was mostly on the Tofane cliffs, and in some scenes toward the end of the movie the audience clearly sees the three Tofane, the Croda da Lago, and the town of Cortina; the location of this is on top of Mount Faloria, at the arrival of the funivia Faloria. In other scenes are the sentiero ferrato Astaldi, over the Rifugio Dibona. The small house has been constructed on the sand of the river Boite, in Fiames, close to the heliport. Some filming took place in Durango, Colorado. The credits of the film also thank the Ute Tribe for filming in the Ute Mountain reservation.

&quot;Cliffhanger&quot; is in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for the costliest aerial stunt ever performed. Stuntman Simon Crane was paid $1 million to perform the aerial transfer scene, where he crossed between two planes at an altitude of .

The principal climbing doubles were Ron Kauk and Wolfgang Güllich. Kauk performed as Stallone&#x27;s climbing double after Güllich died in a car accident in 1992. The doubles filled in for Stallone on most of the climbing scenes due to the actor&#x27;s fear of heights; an injury to Stallone&#x27;s hand, reported to have occurred on one of the cliffs, actually occurred on a soundstage.

When asked about the director&#x27;s cut, Stallone explained that &quot;the director&#x27;s cut was met with a lot of disapproval at the screening and received some alarmingly low scores. Mainly because the stunts were absurdly overblown. For example, the average man can jump maybe twelve feet across a gorge, and the stunts had me leaping maybe three hundred feet or more, so situations like that had to be pared down and still then were fairly extreme...so you&#x27;re probably better off with this cut. By the way, the second unit crew that filmed the majority of the action was extraordinary.&quot;

== Music ==
The orchestral score to &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; was composed by film score veteran Trevor Jones with the National Philharmonic Orchestra. In his review for the &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; soundtrack, Filmtracks.com reviewer Christian Clemmensen mentioned its similarities to Jones&#x27; previous work on &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;, stating: &quot;with &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; would come a title theme strikingly similar to that of &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot;, possibly too reminiscent in fact for some listeners to tolerate.&quot; However, his review was still positive, giving the &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; score four out of a possible five stars, concluding, &quot;No matter your view of whether or not composers should recycle their own material, Jones&#x27; main identity for &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; stands on its own as a remarkable piece, and an often enjoyable action underscore will maintain your interest in between the theme&#x27;s statements.&quot; The soundtrack has been released twice; through Scotti Bros./BMG Music on 23 May 1993 and an extended version through Intrada Records on 21 February 2011.

== Release ==
=== Cut version ===
For its British cinema release, the film was cut by over a minute, then by a further 16 seconds on video and DVD to gain a &#x27;15&#x27; certificate. Chief victim was the scene in which Delmar beats up Tucker, but other cuts included aggressive strong language and other moments of violence. However, the 2008 DVD release was given a &#x27;15&#x27; with no cuts made.

It was released on DVD on November 26, 1997 and re-released for the Collector&#x27;s Edition on June 13, 2000 by Columbia TriStar Home Video.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; has an approval rating of 68% based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;While it can&#x27;t escape comparisons to the movies it borrows from, &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; is a tense, action-packed thriller and a showcase for the talents that made Sylvester Stallone a star.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 60 out of 100 based on reviews from 16 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The film was screened out of competition at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. It was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Sound (Michael Minkler, Bob Beemer, and Tim Cooney), Best Sound Effects Editing (Gregg Baxter), and Best Visual Effects, all losing to &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. Although most people enjoyed Lithgow&#x27;s performance, he was criticized for his inauthentic-sounding English accent, especially when next to native English actors Fairbrass and Goodall.

Michael Benge of &quot;Climbing&quot; magazine was critical of the film&#x27;s unrealistic portrayal of mountaineering, including the fictional gun which fires pitons directly into rock.

== Other media ==

=== Cancelled sequel and reboot ===

In 1994, TriStar announced plans to develop a sequel titled &quot;Cliffhanger 2: The Dam&quot;, with Stallone reprising his starring role. The plot revolved around Gabe Walker combating terrorists who took control of the Hoover Dam. The project remained in development hell until 2008, when the project was revived with Stallone&#x27;s involvement, before once again being shelved. By May 2009, it was announced that a reimagining was in development. Produced by Neal H. Moritz the project would be a joint-production between Original Film and StudioCanal. The story would focus around a group of young climbers, and was tentatively scheduled to begin principal photography the following year. Moritz stated that his intent is to adapt the story in a similar manner comparable to J.J. Abrams&#x27; work on &quot;Star Trek&quot;. By May 2014, Joe Gazzam was hired as screenwriter after pitching his approach to the story to Moritz who was impressed. By May 2015, Stallone expressed interest in developing a direct sequel to the original film. In May 2019, the project developed into a female-led adaptation. Ana Lily Amirpour was hired as director, with a new draft of the script written by Sascha Penn. Jason Momoa was in early negotiations to feature in a prominent cameo role; while Mortiz brought on Toby Jaffe, Thorsten Schumacher, and Lars Sylvest as additional producers. The story was described as a survival thriller action movie, with elements of espionage. An official production poster was released for the project&#x27;s presence at Cannes, with a tentative commencement for principal photography was set for 2020. Moritz stated that there are plans for more than one installment to be made.

In May 2023, it was officially announced that the project will be redeveloped as a legacy-sequel. Ric Roman Waugh will serve as director (replacing Amirpour), from a new script written by Mark Bianculli. Stallone will reprise his role from the original, in addition to taking on a role as producer. The plot will detail the continued adventures of climber-turned-rescue ranger Gabriel &quot;Gabe&quot; Walker alongside a supporting cast, and include the Italian Alps. Casting underway for additional ensemble lead and supporting roles. Waugh expressed excitement for the challenge of working with Stallone, stating: &quot;Growing up with the biggest action films of the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s, ...&quot;Cliffhanger&quot; was by far one of my favorite spectacles. To be at the helm of the next chapter, ...with the legend himself...is a dream come true. It&#x27;s going to be a great challenge and blast taking this franchise to new heights, a responsibility I don&#x27;t take lightly.&quot; Moritz, Jaffe, Schumacher, Sylvest, and Braden Aftergood will serve as additional producers. The project will be a joint-venture production between Original Film, Balboa Productions, StudioCanal, Rocket Science Films, Wright Productions &amp; Entertainment, and Front Row Entertainment. The movie had a presence at Cannes, where additional funding and distribution would be decided. In December of the same year, it was announced that Jean-François Richet had replaced Waugh as director; while additional film studios joined the project including FilmFernsehFonds Bayern, Black Magic Films, Supernix, Maze Pictures, and Occupant Entertainment. Philipp Kreuzer and Joe Neurauter will serve as additional producers, while principal photography was scheduled to commence in the summer of 2024. In October 2024, it was reported that a creative overhaul turned the proposed &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; sequel into a reboot, with Stallone no longer involved with the project. Lily James was cast in the lead role, alongside Pierce Brosnan, Nell Tiger Free, Franz Rogowski, Shubham Saraf, Assaad Bouab, Suzy Bemba, and Bruno Gouery. Principal photography began on October 31, in Austria.

<doc id="746847" wikidata="Q2836599" url="?curid=746847" title="Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt">
<text>Alice Hathaway Roosevelt (; July 29, 1861 – February 14, 1884) was an American socialite and the first wife of President Theodore Roosevelt. Two days after giving birth to their only child, she died from undiagnosed Bright&#x27;s disease.

==Early life==
Alice Hathaway Lee was born on July 29, 1861, in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, to banker George Cabot Lee and Caroline Watts Haskell. Her younger brother was banker George Cabot Lee Jr. and her grandfather was John Clarke Lee, founder of Lee, Higginson &amp; Co. Standing 5&#x27;6&quot;, she had &quot;blue-gray eyes and long, wavy golden hair&quot; and was described as strikingly beautiful as well as charming. Her family and friends called her &quot;Sunshine&quot; because of her cheerful disposition.

==Courtship and marriage==

Lee met Theodore &quot;T.R.&quot; Roosevelt, Jr. on October 18, 1878, at the home of her relatives and next-door neighbors, the Saltonstalls. At Harvard University, Roosevelt was a classmate of her cousin, Richard Middlecott &quot;Dick&quot; Saltonstall. Later writing of their first encounter, Roosevelt said, &quot;As long as I live, I shall never forget how sweetly she looked, and how prettily she greeted me.&quot;

Lee received a proposal of marriage from Roosevelt in June 1879 but waited eight months before accepting. Their engagement was announced on February 14, 1880.
At age 19, Lee married Roosevelt on October 27, 1880, (T.R.&#x27;s 22nd birthday) at the Unitarian Church in Brookline, Massachusetts. The couple&#x27;s &quot;proper&quot; honeymoon was delayed until the following summer due to her new husband&#x27;s acceptance into Columbia Law School. After spending the first two weeks of their marriage at the Roosevelt family summer rental in Oyster Bay known as &quot;Tranquility,&quot; the couple went to live with Theodore&#x27;s widowed mother, Martha Stewart &quot;Mittie&quot; Bulloch.

Along with her new husband, Roosevelt participated in the social world of elite New York and toured Europe for five months in 1881. In October 1882 Roosevelt moved to her husband&#x27;s Albany boardinghouse and learned about New York state politics. When she became pregnant in the summer of 1883, the Roosevelts planned for a large family and bought land near Tranquility for a large home. She returned to live with her mother-in-law in New York City later that fall.

== Birth of only daughter, Alice ==
Roosevelt gave birth to the couple&#x27;s daughter at 8:30 pm on February 12, 1884; the child was named Alice Lee Roosevelt. Her husband, then a member of the New York State Assembly, was in Albany attending to business on the Assembly floor. He had been convinced their child would be born on Valentine&#x27;s Day, the fourth anniversary of their engagement. After Assemblyman Roosevelt received a telegram the morning of the 13th notifying him of the birth, he made arrangements to leave that afternoon and be with his wife. Another telegram was sent and received regarding her ill health, and she was in a semi-comatose state by the time he arrived home, around midnight. 

==Death==
Roosevelt languished for several hours while her husband held her; dying the afternoon of February 14, 1884, from undiagnosed kidney failure. It was determined that her pregnancy had masked the illness. Alice Roosevelt was 22 years old at the time of her death.

Distraught following Alice Roosevelt&#x27;s death, her husband hardly spoke of her again. Much to the frustration of their daughter, all Theodore Roosevelt revealed following his wife&#x27;s death was a diary entry and a short, privately published tribute:

In the immediate aftermath of Roosevelt&#x27;s death, her widowed husband turned the care of their newborn daughter, Alice Lee Roosevelt, over to her aunt Anna &quot;Bamie&quot; Roosevelt, the older sister of Theodore Roosevelt, because it was already clear to Roosevelt that his sister would remain unmarried. As she grew, Alice Lee learned of her mother primarily from Bamie Roosevelt and her Lee grandparents. Roosevelt never spoke to his daughter about her mother. He tore pages from his diary about his wife, and burned almost all of the letters they had written to each other over the years. Theodore Roosevelt and his second wife, Edith Kermit Carow, took custody of his daughter when she was three years old.

===Burial===
Roosevelt was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, next to her mother-in-law Mittie, who had died just hours before her. The families of each held a joint funeral for the women at New York&#x27;s Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church.

<text>Melvin Lindsey (July 8, 1955March 26, 1992) was an American radio and television personality in the Washington, D.C. area. He is widely known for originating the &quot;Quiet Storm&quot; late-night music programming format.

Lindsey was a native of Washington, D.C. and attended Alice Deal Middle School and Woodrow Wilson High School. Lindsey began his broadcast career as an intern at Howard University radio station WHUR-FM. In 1976, he brought the &quot;Quiet Storm&quot; to the station&#x27;s late-night lineup, titled after a romantic hit single by tenor crooner Smokey Robinson. The show&#x27;s soulfully melodic and moody musical fare made it a phenomenal success, and the &#x27;love song&#x27;-heavy format was quickly replicated at stations across the country that served an urban, African-American adult demographic. Lindsey&#x27;s show also gave rise to a category of music of the same name.

After a nine-year run on WHUR, Lindsey took his format to another local radio station, WKYS-FM, for five more years, and later he hosted &quot;Screen Scene&quot; for Black Entertainment Television (BET). He also worked for Washington, D.C. television stations WTTG-TV and WFTY-TV and for WJZ-TV in Baltimore, Maryland.

Lindsey died at the age of 36 from complications of AIDS in 1992, but the Quiet Storm format he originated gained widespread popularity. It remained popular over 4 decades after its inception across the nation, especially in evening and late-night radio programs. Artists continue to compose songs to target the audiences of Quiet Storm stations and shows.

<doc id="746858" wikidata="Q2932927" url="?curid=746858" title="Kaftan">
<text>A kaftan or caftan (; , ; , ; ) is a variant of the robe or tunic. Originating in Asia, it has been worn by a number of cultures around the world for thousands of years. In Russian usage, &quot;kaftan&quot; instead refers to a style of men&#x27;s long suit with tight sleeves.

It may be made of wool, cashmere, silk, or cotton, and may be worn with a sash. Popular during the time of the Ottoman Empire, detailed and elaborately designed garments were given to ambassadors and other important guests at the Topkapı Palace.

Variations of the kaftan were inherited by cultures throughout Asia and were worn by individuals in Russia (North Asia, Eastern Europe and formerly Central Asia), Southwest Asia and Northern Africa.

Styles, uses, and names for the kaftan vary from culture to culture. The kaftan is often worn as a coat or as an overdress, usually having long sleeves and reaching to the ankles. In regions with a warm climate, it is worn as a light-weight, loose-fitting garment. In some cultures, the kaftan has served as a symbol of royalty.
== History ==
The origins of the kaftan are uncertain, but it is believed to have first appeared in ancient Mesopotamia. It is described as a long robe as far as the calves sometimes or just under the knee, and is open at the front and the sleeves are slight cut at the wrists or even as far as to the middle of the arms.

=== Abbasid era ===
During the Islamic golden age of the Abbasid era, the cosmopolitan super-culture spread far and wide to Chinese emperors, Anglo-Saxon coinage, but also in Constantinople too (current day Istanbul). They were mimicking and imitating Baghdad culture (capital of the Abbasids).

In the 830s, Byzantine Emperor Theophilus, who fought the Abbasids on the battlefield and built a Baghdad-style palace near the Bosporus, went about in kaftans and turbans. Even as far as the streets of Ghuangzhou during the era of Tang dynasty, the Abbasid kaftan was in fashion.

The kaftan became a luxurious fashion, a richly styled robe with buttons down the front. The Caliphs wore elegant kaftans made from silver or gold brocade and buttons in the front of the sleeves. The Caliph al-Muqtaddir (908–932) wore a kaftan from silver brocade Tustari silk and had his son one made from Byzantine silk richly decorated with figures. The kaftan was spread far and wide by the Abbasids and made known throughout the Middle East and North Africa.

==Types==
===Turkic kaftan===
The caftan appears to be the oldest Turkish dress, this costume can be traced as far back as the Hun and Göktürk periods. The kaftan was the favourite garment worn in Turkic states of Central Asia, the Turkic Empire in India, the Seljuk Turks and the Ottomans. It was the most important component of the Seljuk period and the oldest known examples of this robe are said to have been found in Hun tombs. The costume of the Gokturk period consisted of long kaftans that are closed with a belt at the waist, these kaftans can be observed in Gokturk statues.

The Seljuk Sultan Ahmad Sanjar who ruled from 1097 to 1118 gave 1000 red kaftans to his soldiers. In 1058 as well as the period of the Seljuk Sultan Malik-Shah I, the Seljuk Turks wore kaftans and excavations discovered a child&#x27;s kaftan dating back to the reign of Sanjar-Shah who ruled from 1185 or 1186 to 1187.

The tiles in the Kubadabad Palace depict Turkish figures dressed in kaftans. The palace was built for Sultan Aladdin Kayqubad I who ruled from 1220 to 1237. Furthermore, typical Seljuk depictions from the 11th to the 13th century depict figures dressed in Turkish style kaftans. The kaftan was also worn by the Anatolian Seljuks who had even gifted kaftans to the first Ottoman Sultan, Osman I. In connection with the inheritance of Osman I, the historian Neşri described a kaftan in the list of inherited items: &quot;There was a short-sleeved kaftan of Denizli cloth&quot;.

In an excavation in Kinet in Turkey, a bowl dating back to the early 14th century was found with a depiction of a man wearing what appears to be a kaftan.

Kaftans were worn by the sultans of the Ottoman Empire. Decoration on the garment, including colours, patterns, ribbons, and buttons, indicated the rank of the person who wore it. In the first half of the 14th century Orhan Ghazi captured Bursa and made it the Ottoman capital. One of the chief specialties of Bursa was gold embroidery among other weaving related specialties, an archive notes that two kaftans made of the finest Bursa gold-brocaded velvet were prepared for the circumcision of Geliboulu Bey Sinan Pasha&#x27;s two sons in 1494.

Ibn Battuta who had visited Anatolia witnessed that a mudarris was wearing a gown embroidered with golden pieces and that a Seljuk Bey gifted a kaftan that was embroidered with golden threads. From the 14th century through the 17th century, textiles with large patterns were used. By the late 16th and early 17th centuries, decorative patterns on the fabrics had become smaller and brighter. By the second half of the 17th century, the most precious kaftans were those with &quot;yollu&quot;: vertical stripes with varying embroidery and small patterns – the so-called &quot;Selimiye&quot; fabrics.

Most fabrics manufactured in Turkey were made in Istanbul and Bursa, but some textiles came from as far away as Venice, Genoa, Persia (Iran), India, and even China. kaftans were made from velvet, &quot;aba&quot;, &quot;bürümcük&quot; (a type of crepe with a silk warp and cotton weft), &quot;canfes&quot;, &quot;çatma&quot; (a heavy silk brocade), &quot;gezi&quot;, &quot;diba&quot; (), &quot;hatayi&quot;, &quot;kutnu&quot;, &quot;kemha&quot;, &quot;seraser&quot; () (brocade fabric with silk warp and gold or silver metallic thread weft), &quot;&quot;, &quot;zerbaft&quot; (), and &quot;tafta&quot; (). Favoured colours were indigo, kermes, violet, &quot;pişmiş ayva&quot; or &quot;cooked quince&quot;, and weld yellow. Silk or wooled vests embellished with couched gold thread or silk embroidery probably represent the introduction of a Turkish feature into an Arab aesthetic.

Nearly 2,500 caftans and other garments belonging to subsequent sultans from the 15th to the 19th century are preserved in the Topkapı Palace museum. The Topkapı Palace houses 21 kaftan that belonged to Mehmed II, 77 kaftan that belonged to Suleiman the Magnificent, 13 that belonged to Ahmed I, 30 that belonged to Osman II and 27 that belonged to Murad IV.

===Algerian kaftan===
The kaftan has been historically documented to have been worn in Algeria in the beginning of the 16th century and the presence of the kaftan in Algeria dates far back to the Rustamid period and is attested during the Zirid period in the 10th century as well as the Zayyanid period. Following the Ottoman tradition, the male kaftan, known as the kaftan of honour, was bestowed by the Ottoman Sultan upon the governors of Algiers who, in turn, bestowed kaftans upon the Beys and members of distinguished families. In his &quot;Topography and General History of Algiers&quot;, described it as a coloured robe made of satin, of damask, of velvet and silk and having a form that reminded him of the priests&#x27; cassocks. The Dey wore the kaftan with dangling sleeves; the &quot;khodjas&quot; (secretaries) wore a very long cloth based kaftan, falling to the ankles; the &quot;chaouchs&quot; (executors of the justice of the dey) were recognized by a green kaftan with sleeves either open or closed, according to their rank. The kaftan was also worn by the janissaries in the 17th and part of the 18th century. It continued to be worn by male dignitaries well into the 20th century.

The female kaftan, on the other hand, evolved locally and derives from the &#x27;, a mid-calf jacket that combined Morisco and Ottoman influences, but which evolved following a very specific Algerian style from the sixteenth century onward. Between the sixteenth and seventeenth century, middle-class women started wearing the &#x27;. The use of brocades and quality velvet, the profusion of embroidery and gold threading were not enough to satisfy the need for distinction of the wealthiest Algerians who choose to lengthen the &#x27; all the way to the ankles to make a kaftan that became the centrepiece of the ceremonial costume, while the &#x27; was confined to the role of daily clothing. The introduction of gold thread embroidery into North Africa itself is reputed to have been introduced through Turkish rule.

In 1789, the diplomat Venture de Paradis described the women of Algiers as follows:

Several types of kaftans were developed since then, while still respecting the original pattern. Nowadays, the Algerian female kaftans, including the modernised versions, are seen as an essential garment in the bride&#x27;s trousseau in cities such as Algiers, Annaba, Bejaia, Blida, Constantine, Miliana, Nedroma and Tlemcen.

The wedding costume tradition of Tlemcen, known as chedda of Tlemcen., which features the Algerian caftan, was inscribed to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2012, in recognition of its cultural significance.

=== Moroccan kaftan ===
According to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, the kaftan was introduced into the Barbary States by the Ottomans and spread by fashion as far as Morocco.

According to art historian Rachida Alaoui, the kaftan in Morocco dates back to the end of the 15th century and goes back to the region&#x27;s Moorish history, which represents the medieval heritage of Al-Andalus. However, the first &quot;written record&quot; of the garment being worn in Morocco is from the 16th century, she states.

According to Naima El Khatib Boujibar, however, the kaftan might only have been introduced to Morocco by the Saadi Sultan Abd al-Malik, who had lived in Algiers and Istanbul. Abd al-Malik, who had officially acknowledged Ottoman overlordship throughout his time as ruler of Morocco, dressed in Ottoman fashion, spoke Turkish, reorganised his army and administration in imitation of Ottoman practices and used Ottoman Turkish titles for his officials. The second half of the sixteenth century was a period of Ottoman influence in Morocco during which Ahmad al-Mansur, who was greatly influenced by Ottoman culture, adopted Turkish costumes and customs, he introduced Ottoman fashions of dress, his army adopted Turkish costumes and titles and ambassadors even noted the use of Turkish pottery and Turkish carpets in the Badi Palace. Aspects of Ottoman culture had been introduced to Morocco during the reign of both Abd al-Malik and Ahmad al-Mansur and Abd al-Malik&#x27;s brief reign opened a period which continued under his successor of the &quot;Turkification&quot; of Morocco. Henri Terrasse asserted that Moroccan embroidery styles are almost all derived from the former regions of the Turkish empire, the introduction of gold thread embroidery into North Africa itself is reputed to have been introduced with Turkish rule.

Worn by the dignitaries and women of the palace at first, it became fashionable among the middle classes from the late 17th century onwards.

Today in Morocco, kaftans are worn by women of different social groups and the word kaftan is commonly used to mean a &quot;one-piece traditional fancy dress&quot;. Alternative two-piece versions of Moroccan kaftans are called takchita and worn with a large belt. The takchita is also known as Mansouria which derives from the name of Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur, who invented Al-Mansouria and the new fashion of wearing a two-piece kaftan.

Since June 5, 2022, the Moroccan kaftan and the brocade of Fes have been officially included in the list of intangible cultural heritage by ICESCO.

===West African kaftan===

In West Africa, a kaftan is a pullover robe, worn by both men and women. The women&#x27;s robe is called a kaftan, and the men&#x27;s garment is referred to as a Senegalese kaftan.

A Senegalese kaftan is a pullover men&#x27;s robe with long bell-like sleeves. In the Wolof language, this robe is called a &quot;mbubb&quot; and in French, it is called a &quot;boubou&quot;. The Senegalese kaftan is an ankle-length garment, and is worn with matching drawstring pants called &quot;tubay&quot;. Usually made of cotton brocade, lace, or synthetic fabrics, these robes are common throughout West Africa. A kaftan and matching pants are called a kaftan suit. The kaftan suit is worn with a kufi cap. Senegalese kaftans are formal wear in all West African countries.

===Persian===
Persian kaftan robes of honour were commonly known as khalat or kelat.

=== North Asia and Eastern Europe ===
====Russian====

In Russia, the word &quot;kaftan&quot; is used for another type of clothing: a style of men&#x27;s long suit with tight sleeves. Going back to the people of various Baltic, Turkic, Varangian (Vikings) and Iranic (Scythian) tribes who inhabited today&#x27;s Russia along with the Slavic population, kaftan-like clothing was already prevalent in ancient times in regions where later the Rus&#x27; Khaganate and Kievan Rus&#x27; states appeared.

The Russian kaftan was probably influenced by Persian and/or Turkic people in Old Russia. The word &quot;kaftan&quot; was adopted from the Tatar language, which in turn borrowed the word from Persia. In the 13th century, the kaftan was still common in Russia. In the 19th century, Russian kaftans were the most widespread type of outer-clothing amongst peasants and merchants in Old Russia. Currently in the early 21st century, they are most commonly used as ritual religious clothing by conservative Old Believers, in Russian fashion (Rusfashion), Russian folk dress and with regards to Russian folklore.

====Jewish====
Hasidic Jewish culture adapted a silky robe (&quot;bekishe&quot;) or frock coat (&quot;kapoteh&quot;, Yiddish word &quot;kapote&quot; or Turkish synonym &quot;chalat&quot;) from the garb of Polish nobility, which was itself a type of kaftan. The term &quot;kapoteh&quot; may originate from the Spanish &quot;capote&quot; or possibly from &quot;kaftan&quot; via Ladino. Sephardic Jews from Muslim countries wore a kaftan similar to those of their neighbours.

===Southeast Asian===
In Southeast Asia, the kaftan was originally worn by Arab traders, as seen in early lithographs and photographs from the region. Religious communities that formed as Islam became established later adopted this style of dress as a distinguishing feature, under a variety of names deriving from Arabic and Persian such as &quot;jubah&quot;, a robe, and &quot;cadar&quot;, a veil or chador.

=== Europe and United States ===

In the recent era the kaftan was introduced to the West in the 1890s, Queen Victoria&#x27;s granddaughter Alix of Hesse wore a traditional Russian coronation dress before a crowd which included Western on-lookers, this traditional dress featured the loose-fitting Russian kaftan which was so exotic to Western eyes. This was one of the first times a Western woman, a high-status Western woman who had also been seen in fashionable Western dress no less, was seen wearing something so exotic. The traditional Russian kaftan resembles the kaftans worn by the Ottoman sultans; it was in stark contrast to the tight-fitting, corseted dresses common in England at that time.

The kaftan slowly gained popularity as an exotic form of loose-fitting clothing. French fashion designer Paul Poiret further popularized this style in the early 20th century.

In the 1950s, fashion designers such as Christian Dior and Balenciaga adopted the kaftan as a loose evening gown or robe in their collections. These variations were usually sashless. This style had also began appearing as high fashion.

American hippie fashions of the late 1960s and the 1970s often drew inspiration from ethnic styles, including kaftans for women and men. These styles were brought to the United States by people who journeyed the so-called &quot;hippie trail&quot;. African-styled, kaftan-like dashikis were popular, especially among African-Americans. Street styles were appropriated by fashion designers, who marketed lavish kaftans as hostess gowns for casual at-home entertaining. The popularity of Kaftans went high in mass market and their cheap imports. Given the materials and the style of the Kaftan, it has shown to symbolize serving as royalty. The types of forms of dresses and kaftans were among the rich.

Diana Vreeland, Babe Paley, and Barbara Hutton all helped popularize the kaftan in mainstream western fashion. Into the 1970s, Elizabeth Taylor often wore kaftans designed by Thea Porter. In 1975, for her second wedding to Richard Burton she wore a kaftan designed by Gina Fratini.

More recently, in 2011 Jessica Simpson was photographed wearing kaftans during her pregnancy. American fashion editor André Leon Talley also wore kaftans designed by Ralph Rucci as one of his signature looks. Beyoncé, Uma Thurman, Susan Sarandon, Kate Moss, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, and Nicole Richie have all been seen wearing the style. Some fashion lines have dedicated collections to the kaftan.

<doc id="746865" wikidata="Q2453911" url="?curid=746865" title="The Heroic Legend of Arslan">
<text>is a Japanese fantasy novel series written by Yoshiki Tanaka. It was published from 1986 to 2017, with sixteen novels and one side-story in the official guidebook &quot;Arslan Senki Dokuhon&quot;. The story and setting is inspired by the history and mythology of ancient Iran.

It was adapted into a film duology and a four-episode original video animation released from 1991 to 1995. It was also adapted into a manga series by Chisato Nakamura, which ran in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Asuka Fantasy DX&quot; from November 1991 to September 1996. In 2013, a second manga adaptation illustrated by Hiromu Arakawa began in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine&quot;, which was later adapted into an anime television series.

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
The story is set in a legendary vision of an indistinct amalgam of over a thousand years of ancient Persia and other nearby countries. While the world in which it takes place is one where magic obviously exists, said magic is of an extremely limited nature. Until the middle of the series, the only magical happenings involve a few spells and a giant, humanoid monster. There are many evil monsters such as ghouls and winged monkeys, which appear in the second half of the novel series. Especially the first half of the series is, at the core, a war story taking place between human nations. In addition, there are underlying themes exploring the repercussions of slavery on a society, having an absolute monarch who treats the poor as cattle, and religious obsession.

===Plot===

The story follows the exploits of Arslan, the crown prince of the kingdom of Pars (&quot;پارس&quot; or &quot;فارس&quot; is equivalent word to Persia and what the land of Persians &quot;پارسیان&quot; was called), and it is divided into two parts. In the first part, Pars is taken over by the neighboring nation of Lusitania after Arslan&#x27;s father, King Andragoras III, falls victim to a treacherous plot led by some of his most trusted retainers. After barely escaping with his life, Arslan rejoins his loyal servant, Daryun. Backed up by only a few more companions, including the philosopher and tactician Narsus and his young servant Elam, also Farangis, an aloof, cold priestess, and Gieve, a travelling musician and con-man, Arslan stands against overwhelming odds to assemble an army strong enough to liberate his nation from the Lusitanian army which is led by the elusive warrior known as &quot;Silvermask&quot;, who is later revealed to be another contender to Pars&#x27; throne. In the second part, Arslan, now king of Pars, divides himself between defending his country against several external threats, including Silvermask, who is still at large, seeking to claim the throne for himself, and addressing the needs and hopes of his subjects.

==Media==

===Novels===
The original novel, &quot;Arslan Senki&quot;, was written by Yoshiki Tanaka. There are sixteen novels in the &quot;Arslan Senki&quot; storyline, with Part One comprising the first seven novels, and Part Two comprising the latter nine novels. The Kadokawa edition (which includes the first ten novels only) is illustrated by manga artist and character designer Yoshitaka Amano, while the Kobunsha edition is illustrated by Shinobu Tanno.

===Books on tape=== 
From November 1988 to January 1994, the first nine volumes were released on cassette tapes by Kadokawa, with the first seven republished as a CD collection in May 1993.

===Manga===

The novels were adapted into a manga illustrated by Chisato Nakamura. The manga was published by Kadokawa Shoten in the &quot;Asuka Fantasy DX&quot; shōjo magazine from 1991 to 1996 and compiled into thirteen volumes, adapting the first seven novels.

A second manga adaptation of &quot;Arslan Senki&quot; started serialization in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine&quot; in July 2013, illustrated by Hiromu Arakawa. This adaptation is simul-published by Crunchyroll, while Kodansha Comics is publishing the manga in North America since 2014.

===Films and OVA series===
The popularity of the novels led to the creation of two films and a series of OVAs with character designs adapted by Sachiko Kamimura. The films were released from 1991 to 1992 and were produced by Kadokawa Shoten and Sony Music Entertainment Japan. An OVA series of four episodes that followed up and continues the numbering of the films was released in 1993–1995. Together, they adapt the first five novels.

Both the films and OVA series were licensed by Central Park Media and were released on DVD and VHS. The English dub for Part 1 was produced by Manga UK (who had also licensed the anime in the same region), while Part 2 was dubbed by Central Park Media themselves.

=== Anime ===

An anime television series adaptation, based on Arakawa&#x27;s manga adaptation, was produced by Liden Films and Sanzigen. The anime consists of two seasons. The first 25-episode season was broadcast from April 5 to September 27, 2015. The second eight-episode season, &quot;Dust Storm Dance&quot;, was broadcast from July 3 to August 21, 2016. Together, they adapt the first six novels.

===Video games===

The first video game based on &quot;The Heroic Legend of Arslan&quot; was released in 1993 for Sega Mega-CD. A strategy RPG in the vein of similar titles of the era such as the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series, it serves as a companion to the OVA series.

&quot;&quot;, a hack and slash video game developed by Omega Force and published by Koei Tecmo in 2015, serves as a companion to the anime TV series.

&quot;The Heroic Legend of Arslan: Warrior&#x27;s Qualification&quot; is a game for smartphones distributed by Sakura Soft. The game was launched on April 27, 2017, and terminated on August 16, 2018. It was based on the manga adaptation by Hiromu Arakawa.

<doc id="746866" wikidata="Q1724233" url="?curid=746866" title="Umbilical artery">
<text>The umbilical artery is a paired artery (with one for each half of the body) that is found in the abdominal and pelvic regions. In the fetus, it extends into the umbilical cord.

==Structure==
===Development===
The umbilical arteries supply systemic arterial blood from the fetus to the placenta. Although this blood is sometimes referred to as deoxygenated blood it is not, and has the same oxygen saturation and nutrients as blood distributed to the other fetal tissues. There are usually two umbilical arteries present together with one umbilical vein in the umbilical cord. The umbilical arteries surround the urinary bladder and then carry all the deoxygenated blood out of the fetus through the umbilical cord. Inside the placenta, the umbilical arteries connect with each other at a distance of approximately 5 mm from the cord insertion in what is called the &quot;Hyrtl anastomosis&quot;. Subsequently, they branch into chorionic arteries or &quot;intraplacental fetal arteries&quot;.

The umbilical arteries are actually the anterior division of the internal iliac arteries, and retain part of this function after birth.

The umbilical arteries are one of two arteries in the human body, that carry deoxygenated blood, the other being the pulmonary arteries.

The pressure inside the umbilical artery is approximately 50 mmHg. Resistance to blood flow decreases during development as the artery grows wider.

===After development===
The umbilical artery regresses after birth. A portion obliterates to become the medial umbilical ligament (not to be confused with the median umbilical ligament, a different structure that represents the remnant of the embryonic urachus). A portion remains open as a branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery. The umbilical artery is found in the pelvis, and gives rise to the superior vesical arteries, which in males usually supplies the artery to the ductus deferens. Alternately, the latter artery can be supplied by the inferior vesical artery in some individuals.

== Clinical significance ==
A catheter may be inserted into one of the umbilical arteries of critically ill babies for drawing blood for testing. This is a common procedure in neonatal intensive care, and can often be performed until 2 weeks after birth (when the arteries start to decay too much). The umbilical arteries are typically not suitable for infusions.

<doc id="746872" wikidata="Q93919917" url="?curid=746872" title="Mundelein College">
<text>Mundelein College was a private, independent, Roman Catholic women&#x27;s college in Chicago, Illinois. Located on the edge of the Rogers Park and Edgewater neighborhoods on the far north side of the city, Mundelein College was founded and administered by the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In 1991, Mundelein became an affiliated college of Loyola University Chicago. It has since become completely incorporated.

==History==

On November 1, 1929, three days after the stock market crash, the official ground-breaking ceremony for Mundelein College was held. The first four floors of the skyscraper building at 6363 North Sheridan Road were already in place. Mundelein College opened its door for class registration, on September 15, 1930, only nineteen months after construction began. At the close of the college&#x27;s first academic year, on June 3, 1931, traffic was rerouted, the uniformed bands of St. Mary&#x27;s High School and Immaculata High School played on the front steps, and the Knights of St. Gregory escorted Cardinal George Mundelein to Mundelein College&#x27;s official dedication ceremony.

Upon his placement to the position of archbishop of Chicago, Cardinal Mundelein had made the education of Catholics one of his primary goals. Meanwhile, the growth of the BVM order of sisters had outpaced the educational ability of Mount Saint Joseph, the BVM college in Dubuque, Iowa. The successful partnership between Cardinal Mundelein and the order led to a college which would exceed both their aspirations.

During the first few decades, courses covered both traditional liberal arts and practical life skills, ranging from Latin, philosophy, literature, physics, and chemistry to home economics and secretarial skills. In the 1940s the Mundelein College Skyscraper boasted one of the country&#x27;s highest observatories containing a telescope and the longest Foucault pendulum in existence at the time. Clubs were a major part of student life at Mundelein. In the first decade, twenty-two clubs were created, ranging from the Stylus (writing) Club and basketball team to the Chemistry Club and International Relations. The Verse Speaking Choir worked under contract with NBC Radio and its participants included Mercedes McCambridge (1937), Academy Award and Golden Globe winner.

Upon the United States entry into World War II the Mundelein College student body participated in a variety of war effort activities. In addition to planting a victory garden near the library, Mundelein students held a jeep drive which raised funds equivalent to the cost of two United States Army Jeeps, held several blood drives, and purchased a war bond with the proceeds from their annual benefit. Mundelein College students also started the first Midwest college unit of the American Red Cross.

In 1957 Sr. Mary Ann Ida Gannon, BVM became Mundelein College&#x27;s sixth president and Mundelein College began a new phase of development. That year 48 young sisters began their education side by side with Mundelein College&#x27;s lay student population as part of the scholasticate program. Also that year Sr. Mary Ann Ida Gannon, BVM asked Sr. Mary Carol Frances Jegen, BVM to establish Mundelein College&#x27;s first theology department.

Sr. Mary Ann Ida Gannon, BVM initiated a college wide self-study in 1962 to determine Mundelein College&#x27;s continued relevance as an institution of higher academic education. The results of the self-study became the driving force for several experimental programs. Mundelein College updated its mission statement, redesigned its term system and core curriculum. In 1965, the college implemented a Degree Completion Program for women who had dropped out of college before receiving their degrees. Beginning with the academic year 1970–71, the college offered students a self-directed course of study, within a group known as &quot;Mandala.&quot; By 1974, the Weekend College in Residence program expanded upon the idea of the Degree Completion Program by offering working women the opportunity to achieve a degree while attending college only on the weekends.
Although Mundelein College had amended their articles of incorporation in 1968 to admit men, the education and cultivation of women remained its primary focus. Mundelein College was not immune to the forces of feminism and in 1977 the seeds of an interdisciplinary women&#x27;s studies program began to germinate. Over the next two years, Mundelein College held yearly conferences on women. However, it wasn&#x27;t until 1983 that a Women&#x27;s Studies minor was finally accepted by the college Curriculum Committee. The Peace Studies minor, inaugurated in 1989, also integrated feminist perspectives.

The decades between 1960 and 1990 also saw an increase of minority outreach at Mundelein College. In 1966, the college launched Upward Bound, a federally funded summer program to help minority high school students succeed to college. Responding to the death of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, black students at Mundelein College formed MuCUBA (Mundelein College United Black Association) to address the racial barriers which existed within the walls of the college. In 1982 Hispanic students created their own organization, Hispanics for the Advancement of Our Culture and Education (later reorganized into Latins United for Our Cultural Heritage).

Many Mundelein students embraced the spirit of activism in the 1960s and 1970s. Seven BVMs and &quot;a busload&quot; of students traveled to Alabama to participate in the Selma March for Civil Rights. Mundelein College&#x27;s student body participated in the national wide strike protesting the expansion of the Vietnam War into Cambodia and the student deaths at Kent State University. Students and faculty marched from the Learning Resource Center to the Skyscraper in solidarity against the war. In November 1979, César Chávez spoke at Mundelein College during his tour around the country promoting a lettuce workers strike.

The opening of the 1980s saw Mundelein College celebrating its 50th anniversary with great fanfare. Among the dignitaries at the Golden Jubilee Dinner was Mayor Jane Byrne and highlighting the event was the appearance of Mother Teresa, recipient of the 1980 Magnificat Medal. New programs continued to enhance Mundelein&#x27;s academic offerings, including courses in food management, interior architecture and design, communications, computer science, and peace studies.

===The Skyscraper===

When new, the fourteen-story Art Deco building dominated the skyline of Chicago&#x27;s far north side as building construction stalled during the Great Depression. The Skyscraper had few equals in size and style outside of Downtown Chicago (similarly designed buildings include the Palmolive Building, the Chicago Board of Trade Building, and the West Town Bank Building). Vertical lines of Indiana limestone created a visual illusion making the college appear to soar higher than its actual .

Although the Skyscraper features abstracted foliate, sunbursts, and other geometric designs around its doors and windows, the most striking feature of the building&#x27;s exterior is its guardian angels. The two towering statues at the entrance represent the angels Uriel (&quot;Light of God&quot;) and Jophiel (&quot;Beauty of God&quot;). Uriel holds the book of wisdom and points to a cross in Bas-relief on the fourteenth floor. Jophiel holds the planet Earth and lifts the torch of knowledge. A photo of the sculptures is included in the Smithsonian Institution Research Information System (SIRIS), of the Renwick Gallery of American Art.

Although Chicago architect Joseph W. McCarthy is listed as the supervising architect, the building was designed by Nairne W. Fisher, from St. Cloud Minnesota. McCarthy had been Cardinal Mundelein&#x27;s choice. However, after Mother Isabella Kane dismissed McCarthy&#x27;s Gothic Revival design, she turned to Fisher with whom she had worked before. Not only was Fisher&#x27;s design more modern, it was less expensive than McCarthy&#x27;s.

Fisher studied drafting at a Minneapolis technical school, served in a U.S. Army Intelligence unit which produced maps during World War I, studied briefly at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, worked as a draftsman at lumberyards in Minnesota and South Dakota, and registered as a Minnesota architect in 1922. The designer of the &quot;Moderne&quot; (later known as Art Deco) Mundelein College building never graduated from college.

Originally intended to be a self-contained educational facility, the interior contained classrooms, laboratories, art and music studios, a library, an auditorium, a chapel, a cafeteria, a swimming pool, a gymnasium, reception areas and meeting rooms, and seven floors of living quarters for the BVM staff. Beginning in 1934 with the two houses east of the Skyscraper, Mundelein College began expanding. By 1991, in addition to the original skyscraper, Mundelein College owned a dormitory (Coffey Hall), the white marble mansion (Piper Hall), the Learning Resource Center (now the Sullivan Center), the Yellow House (also known as the President&#x27;s House), and a residence for the BVMs (Wright Hall).

The Mundelein College Skyscraper was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

In December 2007 the City of Chicago designated the building as an official Chicago Landmark.

Starting in 2005, the Skyscraper Building went through an almost 10 year renovation process modernizing the facility while retaining much of its original deco architectural beauty. In October 2012 the building was rededicated the Mundelein Center for the Fine and Performing Arts. It currently houses the specialized facilities of the Fine and Performing Arts Department of Loyola, and now features a new café, green roof and modern thrust stage, multimedia classrooms, offices, galleries, and event spaces in addition to being the largest academic classroom building on Loyola&#x27;s Lakeshore Campus.

===Residence halls===

Although Mundelein College began offering some student housing within the upper floors of the Skyscraper shortly after the college opened, the first official student residence hall was purchased in 1934. Known as Philomena Hall, the twelve-room brick building was one of two mansions separating the Skyscraper from Lake Michigan. Philomena served as a residence hall until 1959 when it was converted into a speech clinic, Student Activities Council official headquarters, and a senior smoker study hall.

In 1961, Philomena Hall was razed to make room for Mundelein College&#x27;s newest dormitory, Coffey Hall. Opened for occupation in 1962, the new residence hall accommodated 208 students. Coffey Hall has since been renovated for use as department office space. In 1963, Mundelein College purchased Northland Apartments to the west of the Skyscraper. Northland Hall housed a further 250 students. Loyola University Chicago razed Northland Hall in 1992 in order to create a new campus entry.

The original library was housed in room 401 of the Skyscraper building. Stocked mainly with donated books, the entire initial library collection was cataloged and shelved in only thirty days. The main book donation came from Rev. John Rothensteiner of St. Louis. The initial donation consisted of 2,000 volumes; however, he later bequeathed his entire 20,000 volume library to the college. This gift was the heart of Mundelein College&#x27;s rare book collection.

Mundelein College moved its library in 1934 to the white marble mansion purchased from Albert Mussey Johnson. Reading rooms occupied the first two floors of the mansion while the former ballroom on the third floor housed the book stacks. The white marble mansion remained the college&#x27;s library until 1967. After the books were removed from the mansion, it took on multiple personalities including a student center, a coffee shop, a speech clinic (after Philomena was razed), and the Religious Studies Center. After a 2005 remodeling, the white marble mansion is currently Loyola University Chicago&#x27;s Piper Hall (see below).

The crowning jewel in the fast-paced growth of the campus during the 1960s, the Learning Resource Center, built in 1967, became Mundelein College&#x27;s new library. Officially dedicated in 1969, the Learning Resource Center provided Mundelein students with a science and lecture auditorium, 100-seat audiovisual room, faculty and student lounges, seminar rooms, and a rare book room. Today the Learning Resource Center serves the Loyola University Chicago community as the Sullivan Center for Student Services.

==Affiliation with Loyola University==

Enrollment in Mundelein College dropped dramatically in the 1980s. By the end of the decade, the college could no longer financially support itself. In 1991, Mundelein College became an incorporated college of neighboring Loyola University Chicago.

The ideals and values of the BVM sisters continue through the Gannon Center for Women and Leadership, established by Loyola University Chicago. The Gannon Center located in Piper Hall is home to the Gannon Scholars program (a leadership training organization for twenty female Loyola students), the Women&#x27;s Studies Department, and the Women and Leadership Archives.

<text>John Wellborn Root (January 10, 1850 – January 15, 1891) was an American architect who was based in Chicago with Daniel Burnham. He was one of the founders of the Chicago School style. Two of his buildings have been designated National Historic Landmarks (the Rookery, and the Reliance); others have been designated Chicago landmarks and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1958, he was posthumously awarded the AIA Gold Medal.

== Early years and education ==
John Wellborn Root was born in 1850 in Lumpkin, Georgia, the son of Sidney Root, a planter, and his wife, Mary Harvey Clark. He was named after a maternal uncle, Marshall Johnson Wellborn. Root was raised in Atlanta, where he was first educated at home. When Atlanta fell to the Union during the American Civil War, Root&#x27;s father sent young Root and one other boy on a steamer to the United Kingdom, where his father, Sidney, had a shipping business based in Liverpool, England. His mother and sister went to Cuthbert, Georgia.

While in Liverpool, Root studied at a school in Claremount, near Liverpool. His later design work was said to have been influenced by the pioneering work of Liverpool architect Peter Ellis, who designed and built the world&#x27;s first two metal-framed, glass curtain-walled buildings, Oriel Chambers (1864) and 16 Cook Street (1866).

After Root returned to the U.S., he earned an undergraduate degree from New York University in 1869. After graduation, he took a job with the architect James Renwick Jr. of Renwick and Sands of New York as an unpaid apprentice. Later he took a position with John Butler Snook in New York. While working for Snook, Root was a construction supervisor on the original Grand Central Depot, predecessor to Warren and Wetmore&#x27;s Grand Central Terminal. Root was greatly influenced by the architecture of Henry Hobson Richardson.
== Chicago and career ==
In 1871, Root moved to Chicago, where he was employed as a draftsman in an architectural firm. He met Daniel Burnham and two years later in 1873, the young men formed the firm of Burnham and Root; they worked together for 18 years. During the economic downturn in 1873, Root earned extra income on jobs with other firms and as the organist at the First Presbyterian Church.

== Mature years (after 1873) ==
Root developed the floating raft system of interlaced steel beams, to create a foundation for tall buildings that would not sink in Chicago&#x27;s marshy soil. Root&#x27;s first use of this revolutionary system was for the Montauk Building in 1882. He later transferred use of the steel frame to the vertical load-bearing walls in the Phenix Building of 1887, in imitation of William LeBaron Jenney&#x27;s Home Insurance Building of 1885.

Root, Burnham, Dankmar Adler, and Louis Sullivan formed the Western Association of Architects because they felt slighted by East Coast architects. Root served as president in 1886. In 1887, he was elected a director of the national American Institute of Architects. His work from his prime years has been recognized for significance by being designated as National Historic Landmark, National Register of Historic Places, and Chicago landmarks.

He worked on the plan for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Before it was constructed, Root died of pneumonia in 1891 at the age of 41. He was buried in Uptown&#x27;s Graceland Cemetery.

== Marriage and family ==
Root married Mary Louise Walker in 1879, but she died of tuberculosis six weeks later. In 1882, he married for a second time, to Dora Louise Monroe (sister of Harriet Monroe). Their son John Wellborn Root Jr. also practiced in Chicago as an architect. Root&#x27;s sister-in-law, Harriet Monroe, authored the biography, &quot;John Wellborn Root: A Study of His Life and Work&quot; (1896).
