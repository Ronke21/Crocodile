<text>Fenslerfilm (stylized as FENSLERFILM) is an American video production company, based in Chicago, Illinois, United States, and headed by Eric Fensler.

==Work==
===&quot;G.I. Joe&quot; PSA spoofs===
The company gained a reputation in 2003 for a series of short films which parodied the public service announcement (PSA) safety messages used at the end of every episode of the 1980s &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; animated series, based on Hasbro&#x27;s toy line. Fensler, a fan of the series, had recalled the PSAs after rewatching &quot;G.I. Joe: The Movie&quot; which had included the PSAs as bonus features on its DVD, and played around with the footage. While Fensler did the video editing, he had friends supply the new voice-over lines. Fensler&#x27;s friend Doug Lussenhop helped Fensler to prepare the parody PSAs for screening at the Heaven Gallery in Chicago, after which gallery visitors got VHS copies of the PSAs, while the gallery uploaded them to their website. The traffic from the popularity of the videos crashed the gallery&#x27;s server, and eventually two other websites, eBaum&#x27;s World and Heavy.com, provided copies of the videos. By 2004, the videos had been considered viral hits, and Hasbro had sent Fensler a cease and desist order. One of the more recognized of the parody PSAs involved Blowtorch arriving to help stop a kitchen fire started by two boys, randomly shouting &quot;Porkchop sandwiches!&quot; on his appearance. The catchphrase became part of unofficial merchandise based on the parody PSAs.

===Other work===
Fenslerfilm also did some &quot;Sealab 2021&quot; TV spots for Adult Swim. The spots mirrored the previous G.I. Joe PSAs in tone and execution, as they were animated and dubbed in a similar fashion. In 2004, Lussenhop successfully applied to write for &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot;, created by Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, and became one of their close collaborators. When Heidecker and Wareheim were preparing their next show, &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot;, Lussenhop convinced them to bring on Fensler. Fensler stayed on for the show&#x27;s five seasons, and continued to collaborate on the team&#x27;s ongoing smaller projects. In addition, Fensler contributed music videos for the songs &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess With Illinois&quot;, &quot;Hand Over Fist&quot; and &quot;Special Effect&quot; by his fellow Chicagoans, electronic music group TRS-80. He also produced a music video for Daniel Johnston&#x27;s song &quot;The Monster Inside of Me&quot;, using footage from the Captain America animated series from the 1960s. As of 2013, Fensler works for the advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy.

==In popular culture==
*In the movie tie-in video game, &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot;, the developers Double Helix Games had planned to include the line &quot;Porkchop Sandwiches&quot; from one of Fensler&#x27;s films as an exclamation, and had every voice actor record that line for its use. However, Hasbro rejected its use, citing the need to avoid damaging pending lawsuits.
*Super7 released a pair of figures in their ReAction toyline, &quot;Body Massage Roadblock&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m A Computer Mutt&quot;, directly based on the parody PSAs.
*The second-season episode &quot;Hate Floats&quot; of the animated series &quot;The Venture Bros&quot; features the character Henchman 21 wearing a &quot;porkchop sandwiches&quot; shirt while out of uniform.
*Weezer&#x27;s &quot;Pork and Beans&quot; music video, which features stars of internet viral videos, contains a scene in which young animated versions of the band are seen listening to &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; member Gung-Ho.
*In the first issue of &quot;G.I. Joe: Storm Shadow&quot; by Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing, Storm Shadow makes a reference to porkchop sandwiches.
*In &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot;, after killing pig cops, occasionally Duke will say &quot;Porkchop Sandwiches!&quot;. He will also utter the phrase &quot;Body Massage!&quot; after grabbing a vibrator in the Titty City level.

<doc id="747521" wikidata="Q2111000" url="?curid=747521" title="Eustace Scrubb">
<text>Eustace Clarence Scrubb is a fictional character in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot;. He appears in &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;, and &quot;The Last Battle&quot;. In &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, he is accompanied by Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, his cousins. In &quot;The Silver Chair&quot; and &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, he is accompanied by Jill Pole, a classmate from his school.

==Personality ==
Eustace is portrayed at first as arrogant, whiny, and self-centered. It can be gathered from Eustace&#x27;s behavior, and the tone that Lewis used in describing his family and school, that Lewis thought such behavior silly and disliked it a great deal. In fact, at the beginning of &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, Lucy and Edmund dislike visiting him and his parents, though that has mostly to do with Eustace&#x27;s arrogant and unfriendly attitude, and he also calls his parents by their first names. However, the book deals with his rehabilitation (just as &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; dealt with Edmund&#x27;s) and in the later books, he is an altogether better person, becoming a hero along with his friend Jill Pole, although he still sometimes tends to be a know-it-all. It is mentioned in the &quot;Silver Chair&quot; that Eustace is afraid of heights, causing him to overreact when Jill goes too close to the edge of a cliff. In trying to stop her he falls. In other respects, Eustace displays great courage and a fair degree of discernment in facing the challenges that confront him in the Narnian world.

==Biography==

===Prior story===

According to Lewis&#x27;s Narnian timeline, Eustace was born in 1933 and is 9 years old when he appears in &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;; and by &quot;The Last Battle&quot; he is 16 years old.

===&quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;===

Eustace is introduced at the beginning of &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; with the opening line, &quot;There was a boy called Eustace Clarence Scrubb, and he almost deserved it.&quot; He is the only child of what Lewis describes as &quot;very up-to-date and advanced people,&quot; who send him to a progressive mixed school. Eustace calls his parents by their first names (Harold and Alberta); his parents are vegetarians, nonsmokers, teetotallers, pacifists, and wear an unspecified special kind of underclothes.

Much of the narrative of &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; concerns the personal growth of Eustace, as he is drawn into Narnia and aboard the eponymous ship along with Lucy and Edmund, and into adventures that bring him to realize how self-centred his attitudes are. Part of the story is told with extracts from his diary, where we see how skewed his point of view is. He describes the ship sailing in perpetual storm (though the weather is fine), and portrays the others as foolishly denying the supposed rough seas and refusing to face the &quot;truth&quot; of the situation. He complains when Lucy is given Caspian&#x27;s cabin, and comments to the crew that giving girls special treatment is actually &quot;putting them down, and making them weaker&quot;. Moreover, he cannot accept that he is in the Narnian world: he imagines that he can &quot;lodge a disposition&quot; (or &quot;bring an action&quot;) at a British consulate or a British court; and he is beaten by Reepicheep for treating the mouse as one might a circus animal.

Eustace wanders off by himself when the ship puts ashore on an unexplored island. He falls asleep on a dead dragon&#x27;s hoard and finds himself transformed into a dragon by &quot;greedy, dragonish thoughts&quot; in his heart. He also finds himself in constant pain from Lord Octesian&#x27;s arm bracelet, which he put on as a boy but is too small for a dragon&#x27;s leg. Upon return to the &quot;Dawn Treader&quot;, he is nearly attacked by the crew until Lucy asks if he is Eustace, to which he vigorously nods his head. Being a dragon changes Eustace; instead of behaving like his usual sulky self, he helps the travellers find food, shelter, and a tree to serve as a new mainmast. The problem comes when it is time to leave the island, as the ship cannot hold or maintain a dragon. Reepicheep displays sympathy to Eustace&#x27;s plight despite the boy&#x27;s prior cruelty to the mouse and they eventually become friends.

Eventually, Eustace meets Aslan, who returns him to human form by peeling off his dragon skin and sending him into a refreshing bath. Edmund shares his own redemption story with Eustace, observing that &quot;you were only an ass, but I was a traitor.&quot; Eustace improves after this, and becomes a valuable member of the expedition. When the ship is in danger of being sunk by a giant sea-serpent, Eustace attacks the monster, using only a sword. When Eustace returns home after his adventures, his mother thinks he has become tiresome and commonplace, blaming the change on the influence of &quot;those Pevensie children&quot; — though everyone else thinks that he has become a much better person.

===&quot;The Silver Chair&quot;===
Eustace returns to his progressive school where he is now labeled a misfit, due to the changes in him wrought during &quot;The Voyage of The Dawn Treader&quot;. Where before he was a crony and tale-bearer to the gang of bullies who are given free rein at the school, he is now one of their targets, but has the courage to withstand them. He befriends fellow misfit Jill Pole, and their desire to leave the school draws them into Narnia. This unlikely friendship (given that Eustace had bullied Jill before his experience in Narnia) is strengthened throughout the story. Following the custom of their school, Eustace and Jill address each other by their surnames, &quot;Scrubb&quot; and &quot;Pole&quot;.

The two journey to the far north of Narnia, and the world below it, to recover the lost heir to the throne and to thwart the plan of the Lady of the Green Kirtle to overthrow the kingdom. Though he still has faults, mainly stubbornness and rash decision-making, Eustace displays little of his former odiousness, and he and Jill begin to develop affection towards one another. He wholeheartedly rejects the insipid philosophy offered by the Lady in favour of the Narnian life that he has grown to love. He helps Prince Rilian to escape the underworld and return to Narnia, just in time to meet Rilian&#x27;s aged father before the latter&#x27;s death. Caspian was now an old man, as 50 years had passed since Eustace had first been in Narnia.

Eustace and Jill return to Aslan&#x27;s Country, where Caspian is resurrected and restored to the youth and strength that Eustace remembers from his earlier visit to this world. At the end of the story, Caspian is briefly translated into Eustace&#x27;s world, something that Caspian has wanted ever since he met Eustace&#x27;s cousins 53 years earlier. Here he and Aslan help the two friends to scare off the school bullies and set in motion a chain of events that leads to the school&#x27;s becoming a well-managed place of learning.

===&quot;The Last Battle&quot;===
Eustace and Jill are sent to Narnia shortly before its destruction to help young King Tirian rally supporters for one last battle to save Narnia. The friends show great courage and wisdom but the Narnian forces ultimately go down to defeat.

Meanwhile, a railway accident in England has resulted in the death of Eustace and Jill, along with Lucy, Edmund, and Peter, as well as Polly and Digory. They find themselves in Aslan&#x27;s country, dressed as royalty. They all look on as Aslan brings the world of Narnia to an end. Thereafter they encounter many of the characters they had known in the old world, as they climb &quot;further up and further in&quot; to live in eternal happiness in the Real Narnia.

==Themes==
Writer Philip Hensher objected to the description of Eustace and his family, regarding it as evidence of supposed anti-intellectual and anti-progressive leanings. In Lewis&#x27; essay The Abolition of Man, he argues that modern education is producing &quot;men without chests&quot; – people whose lives are divided between the purely cerebral and the purely visceral, without any middle ground of sentiment or imagination—and Eustace (in his initial state) is clearly intended to be one of these. In the same essay, however, Lewis denies the suggestion that he is attacking intellect as such, and in his book on &quot;Miracles&quot; he even argues for the scholastic belief that the intellect is our participation in the supernatural world. Similarly, he was not against progress in the sense of objectively justifiable social improvement, but did oppose purely fashionable progressivism, and in particular what he called &quot;chronological snobbery&quot;, the view that the superiority of modern values can always be assumed automatically and without investigation.

==Portrayal==
In the BBC production, Eustace was portrayed by David Thwaites. In the 2014 BBC audiobook dramatisations of the books, he is portrayed by Marco Williamson. Will Poulter plays Eustace in the Walden Media film adaptation, directed by Michael Apted. Among the alterations for the film is that when Eustace is turned into a dragon, he proves his true identity to Edmund by flying him to where he has used his fire breath to carve the sentence, &quot;I am Eustace&quot; on the ground. Once establishing his identity, the agonizingly undersized bracelet Eustace was wearing when he was transformed into a dragon is quickly removed with Lucy&#x27;s help (In the book, Lucy eased the pain with her cordial but the arm bracelet was not removed until Eustace resumed human form.). Afterward and still in his dragon form Eustace accompanies the &quot;Dawn Treader&quot; on its quest to the next islands and earns the respect of the crew first by towing the ship when it is caught in magically imposed doldrums and later aiding the crew in battle against the sea serpent on the Dark Island, but gets injured. It is here that Aslan restores Eustace to normal, but only by scratching off the dragon&#x27;s skin. Eustace&#x27;s final redemption comes when he races to lay the seventh magic sword at Aslan&#x27;s Table, unleashing the swords&#x27; power to defeat the evil of Dark Island and saving his friends.

The Oh Hellos, a folk rock band, wrote a song &quot;The Lament of Eustace Scrubb&quot; on their 2012 album &quot;Through the Deep, Dark Valley&quot;.

<text>The Sweden men&#x27;s national ice hockey team () is governed by the Swedish Ice Hockey Association. It is one of the most successful national ice hockey teams in the world and a member of the so-called &quot;Big Six&quot;, the unofficial group of the six strongest men&#x27;s ice hockey nations, along with Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia and the United States.

The team&#x27;s nickname Tre Kronor, meaning &quot;Three Crowns&quot;, refers to the emblem on the team jersey, which is found in the lesser national coat of arms of the Kingdom of Sweden. The first time this emblem was used on the national team&#x27;s jersey was on 12 February 1938, during the World Championships in Prague.

The team has won numerous medals at both the World Championships and the Winter Olympics. In 2006, they became the first team to win both tournaments in the same calendar year, by winning the 2006 Winter Olympics in a thrilling final against Finland by 3–2, and the 2006 World Championships by beating Czech Republic in the final, 4–0. In 2013 the team was the first team to win the World Championships at home since the Soviet Union in 1986. In 2018, the Swedish team won its 11th title at the World Championships. In 2021 Sweden failed to reach the playoffs for the first time after the tournament implemented the playoff system, placing 9th, tying their 1937 team for their worst placement in tournament history.

<text>The Program in Liberal Medical Education, or PLME, is an eight-year combined baccalaureate-M.D. medical program offered by Brown University. Members of the program are simultaneously accepted into both the undergraduate College of Brown University as well as the Warren Alpert Medical School, allowing them to receive a Bachelor&#x27;s degree and an M.D. as part of a single eight-year continuum. The PLME is the only combined medical program in the Ivy League, as well as one of only approximately 120 in the nation. The program is highly selective, admitting fewer than 90 applicants nationwide and internationally each year, with an acceptance rate of 2.19% for the class of 2026. The PLME is widely considered to be one of the most competitive and prestigious combined medical programs in the country.

== History ==
The 8-year Program in Liberal Medical Education was inaugurated in 1984. Since 1963, the university had offered a 6-year combined undergraduate/Master of Medical Science program. The PLME program was originally the primary route of admission to the Alpert Medical School, until the medical school began accepting pre-medical students through the standard AMCAS admission route in 2004.

According to the university, the goal of the program is to combine the Open Curriculum of the College and the competency-based curriculum concept of the Alpert Medical School to encourage students of medicine to pursue in depth their interests in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences through a liberal education philosophy as they prepare for their careers as physicians. Julianne Ip, M.D., Associate Dean of Medicine for PLME, described the program as a way to &quot;accept the &#x27;best&#x27; high school students who would utilize Brown, and the College’s unique Open Curriculum to craft their own educational paths. These individualized educational plans would allow students to pursue their passions be they in science or liberal arts but always with the view of medicine as a humanitarian pursuit, not a “trade” to be learned.&quot;

== Admissions ==
Because the PLME draws applicants from around the U.S. and internationally, its applicant pool is significantly larger than those of most other BS/MD programs, which receive primarily in-state applications. With large numbers of applicants competing for very few spots, the program consistently reports a low acceptance rate. For the undergraduate class of 2026, 3,827 high school students applied and 84 were admitted, yielding an acceptance rate of 2.19%. The average SAT scores of matriculants between 2019 and 2022 were 748 in Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and 779 in Math.

==Notable alumni==
Graduates from the PLME are alumni of Brown University, but members of the program specifically have become prominent figures in the medicine and health world as well as in other areas.

<text>The Warren Alpert Medical School (formerly known as Brown Medical School,previously known asBrown University School of Medicine) is the medical school of Brown University, located in Providence, Rhode Island. Originally established in 1811, it was the third medical school to be founded in New England after only Harvard and Dartmouth. However, the original program was suspended in 1827, and the four-year medical program was re-established almost 150 years later in 1972, granting the first MD degrees in 1975.

Today, the Warren Alpert Medical School is a component of Brown&#x27;s Division of Biology and Medicine, which also includes the Program in Biology. Together with the Medical School&#x27;s seven affiliated teaching hospitals, the Division attracts over $300 million in external research funding per year.

==History==
=== Early history ===
Brown University first organized a medical program in 1811, with the appointment of three professors: Solomon Drowne, William Ingalls, and William Bowen. Natural history at Brown had previously been taught by physician Benjamin Waterhouse, a graduate of the University of Edinburgh Medical School, who went on to found Harvard Medical School. The establishment of Brown&#x27;s program in medicine followed examples set by the university&#x27;s New England neighbors, Harvard University and Dartmouth College which had established medical programs in 1782 and 1797, respectively.

After assuming office in 1827, Brown&#x27;s fourth president, Francis Wayland, called for all faculty to reside on campus. Through a residency policy, Wayland intended to increase the supervision of the student body and improve discipline. In March 1827, the Corporation of Brown University resolved that, in order to receive a salary, all faculty would be required to reside on the school&#x27;s campus. Serving as voluntary clinical faculty, the medical school&#x27;s physicians refused to jeopardize their practices in order to comply with the policy.

In 1827, President Wayland suspended the fledgling medical program, suggesting that medical education might be reinstated at a later date. Between its establishment in 1811 and suspension in 1827, 87 students graduated from the school.

=== Modern history ===
In 1972, the Corporation of Brown University authorized the establishment of a four-year medical program. Known as the Program in Medicine, the program awarded its first degrees to a graduating class of 58 students in 1975. In 1991, the program was renamed the Brown University School of Medicine and in 2000 again renamed Brown Medical School.
==== Expansion ====
Between 1972 and 2011, the school operated from facilities on Brown&#x27;s College Hill campus, including the Bio–Med Center and Smith-Buonanno Hall. In 2006, the school opened the Sidney Frank Hall for Life Sciences, a life sciences complex for the Division of Biology and Medicine. Housing both research spaces and administrative offices, the construction of the building marked a significant expansion of the Division&#x27;s facilities.

In January 2007, entrepreneur Warren Alpert donated $100 million to Brown Medical School, tying Sidney Frank for the largest single monetary contribution ever made to the university. In recognition of the gift, Brown Medical School was renamed to The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. The funds contributed to the construction of a new medical education facility, medical student scholarships (through the Warren Alpert Scholars Program), support for biomedical research and faculty recruitment, and new endowed professorships.

In 2016 and 2018 the school received further gifts totaling $27 million and $56 million.

==== Jewelry District ====
Between 2003 and 2006, the university purchased a number of properties in Providence&#x27;s Jewelry District to accommodate for the expansion of medical facilities beyond the historic College Hill neighborhood. In August 2011, the university completed the process of renovating a former industrial building at 222 Richmond Street to serve as the school&#x27;s primary facility. Combined with another renovation project at adjacent 70 Ship Street, the opening of 222 Richmond Street marked the school&#x27;s relocation from facilities primarily on College Hill to those primarily Downtown.

==Admissions and rankings==

Brown Alpert Medical School is one of the seven Ivy League medical schools and is currently ranked 14th for primary care education and 35th for research by the 2023 &#x27;U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27; rankings. Alpert was ranked in the top 25 medical schools in the U.S. by both Business Insider and by a medical education rankings study conducted by Matthew J. Goldstein and colleagues at Harvard Medical School. Alpert enrolls approximately 144 students per class, and in 2017 was named by US News among the 10 most selective medical schools in the United States based on acceptance rate. In 2016, Alpert received 6,374 completed applications and interviewed 370 applicants for 90 spots open through the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). Other routes of entry include the eight-year Program in Liberal Medical Education (PLME) and a small number of linkage programs. The 2016 matriculating class had an average GPA of 3.8 and MCAT score of 514.

Students interested in studying at Alpert Medical School may apply through a variety of admissions routes designed to enroll a diverse and highly qualified student body. Approximately 30% of the entering class is composed of students from the 8-year Program in Liberal Medical Education (PLME) and special linkage agreement programs. In 2004, the school began to accept premedical students from other colleges and universities via AMCAS through a standard route of admissions. According to the school&#x27;s website, for the Fall 2016 entering class, Alpert Medical School received 6,374 secondary applications and interviewed 370 candidates through the AMCAS route.&quot;

==Curriculum==
A restructuring of the pre-clinical curriculum was implemented in 2006, with the goal of achieving an integrated, contemporary and flexible medical curriculum. Its design was predicated on the vision that tomorrow&#x27;s physician must be an IT-savvy lifelong learner who is scientifically and clinically enlightened, familiar with alternative and complementary healing traditions, patient and service-centered, and who understands the economic underpinnings of the US health care system. At the heart of the curriculum redesign are the two-year basic science component (Integrated Medical Sciences I-IV), Doctoring (which focuses on clinical skills and professionalism), and the Scholarly Concentrations Program.

Integrated Medical Sciences I: IMS-I provides students with foundations of cell biology, cell physiology, biochemistry, nutrition, immunology and genetics, all of which are integrated with gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy. IMS-I also includes general pathology in which students are introduced to concepts underlying the mechanisms of disease. This foundation forms the basis for the subsequent systems-based blocks of IMS II through IV.

Brain Sciences, the first module of IMS II, integrates head and neck anatomy with neurobiology, behavior, pathophysiology and neuropharmacology. Microbiology is integrated with infectious diseases and relevant pharmacology and epidemiology. In the final block of IMS-II, Endocrinology, endocrine physiology has been incorporated into the endocrine pathophysiology, pathology and pharmacology content. Integrated Medical Sciences III and IV: Students continue with a systems-based approach in Year II: The course sections are cardiology, nephrology, pulmonology, hematology, gastroenterology, human reproduction, growth, and development, and supporting structures (dermatology, rheumatology, and orthopedics).

Doctoring is a required skills-based course for all first- and second-year medical students designed to teach the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of a competent, ethical, and humane physician. Students spend one half-day a week working alongside a physician-mentor. These sessions allow students to observe and practice clinical skills such as medical interviewing, history-taking, physical diagnosis, and professional conduct.

==Scholarly Concentrations Program==
The Scholarly Concentrations Program is an elective program through which Alpert Medical School students may elect to pursue a course of study beyond that of the conventional medical education curriculum. Scholarly Concentrations offer students the opportunity to translate personal interests and activities into scholarship. Students who participate in a Scholarly Concentration will undertake rigorous independent scholarship in a cross-disciplinary field of interest related to medicine, public health, engineering, or a bio-medically relevant topic in the sciences, arts, or humanities.

Currently, students may pursue a Scholarly Concentration in the following areas: advocacy and activism, aging, caring for underserved communities, contemplative studies, disaster medicine, global health, health policy, informatics, integrative medicine, medical education, medical ethics, medical humanities, medical technology and innovation, physician as communicator, and women&#x27;s reproductive health.

== Primary care–population medicine program ==
Using seed money from a $1 million Accelerating Change in Medical Education (ACE) grant from the American Medical Association, the Warren Alpert Medical School (AMS) of Brown University developed an MD-MSc program. The primary care–population medicine (PC–PM) program is an integrated dual-degree curriculum that focuses on preparing students for a career in medicine while providing training in population medicine. Students concurrently earn both the MD and an MSc in population medicine with four years of curriculum.

==PLME==

In 1984, Brown endorsed an eight-year medical program called the Program in Liberal Medical Education (PLME). The PLME offers a unique opportunity to join undergraduate and professional studies in medicine in a single eight-year program. By combining the open curriculum concept of Brown (The College) and the competency-based curriculum concept of the Alpert Medical School, the PLME encourages students of medicine to pursue in depth their interests in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences even as they prepare for their careers as physicians.

Prospective students apply to this eight-year program before they begin their undergraduate education. The program is extremely selective, accepting only 90 students each year, and is considered among the most prestigious combined medical programs in the country. In 2020, 2,530 applicants applied for 88 spots, yielding an acceptance rate of approximately 3.47%. According to one source, over 23% of all admitted students to the PLME program enrolled in an admissions prep program. Students earn a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in their concentration of choice after their fourth year and automatically enter the medical school to pursue their MD degree.

==Other programs==
=== Early Identification Program ===
Since 1976, the Early Identification Program (EIP) was initiated to encourage Rhode Island residents to pursue careers in medicine by recruiting sophomores from Providence College, Rhode Island College and the University of Rhode Island. An EIP was also established with Tougaloo College to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in the medical school.

=== Brown-Dartmouth Medical Program ===
From 1981 to 2006, Brown offered a joint program with Dartmouth Medical School called the Brown-Dartmouth Medical Program. Approximately 15 students at Dartmouth Medical School enrolled in the program annually, spending the first two basic medical science years at Dartmouth and the next two years in clinical education at Brown, where they received their MD degree. The program was discontinued in the fall of 2006 after their respective deans stated that the institutions desired to move in their own directions.

Combined degree programs leading to the MD/PhD, MD/MPH, MD/MPP, and MD-MSc degrees are currently offered in conjunction with Brown&#x27;s Graduate School, School of Public Health, and Watson Institute.

<doc id="747527" wikidata="Q1689785" url="?curid=747527" title="Mudita">
<text>Muditā (Pāli and Sanskrit: मुदिता) is a dharmic concept of joy, particularly an especially sympathetic or vicarious joy—the pleasure that comes from delighting in other people&#x27;s well-being.

The traditional paradigmatic example of this mind-state is the attitude of a parent observing a growing child&#x27;s accomplishments and successes. 
==Application==
Mudita meditation cultivates appreciative joy at the success and good fortune of others. The Buddha described this variety of meditation in this way:
Buddhist teachers compare mudita to an inner spring of infinite joy that is available to everyone at all times, regardless of circumstances.

Joy is also traditionally regarded as the most difficult to cultivate of the four immeasurables (: also &quot;four sublime attitudes&quot;). To show joy is to celebrate happiness and achievement in others even when we are facing tragedy ourselves.

According to Buddhist teacher Ayya Khema showing joy towards is wrong. Here there should instead be compassion ().

The &quot;far enemies&quot; of joy are jealousy (envy) and greed, mind-states in obvious opposition. Joy&#x27;s &quot;near enemy&quot;, the quality which superficially resembles joy but is in fact more subtly in opposition to it, is exhilaration, described as a grasping at pleasant experience out of a sense of insufficiency or lack.

<text>Gerhardus Jacobus Rudolph (1797–1851) was the grandson of the South African Rudolph progenitor, Johan Bernhard Rudolph.

He was a member of a scouting expedition, set up by Piet Uys, which left the Eastern Cape Uitenhage and Albany area on 8 September 1834. Gert, as he was affectionately known, farmed together with Piet Uys in the Lower Bushmans River area of the Eastern Cape. Amongst the approximately 21 whites that made up the group were: the scout J.H. (Hans Dons) de Lange, Johannes Stephanus Maritz and two brothers of Piet Uys, the thirty-four-year-old Jacobus Johannes and the fifteen-year-old Johannes Zacharias. The expedition wanted to establish if it was possible to acquire arable areas in Natal that could have been successfully farmed. At the same time it would also have been an adventurous hunting expedition that could have returned profitable gains.

Gert later was the leader of one of the Voortrekker groups to have left the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa to escape the British Colonization of the Cape of Good Hope as well as the continual cross border raids by the Xhosa to their north.

He was the first cousin of Gert Maritz, a well known Voortrekker leader in early Natal history.

Shortly after leaving the Eastern Cape his trek joined up together with that of Gert Maritz. Fiery of character, he became a renowned Voortrekker leader and fighter. He led the Voortrekkers in many skirmishes against the natives of Southern Africa during their trek into the unknown. He became the leader of their combined trek after Gert Maritz died at Zaailager, Natal on 23 September 1838.

In January 1840, Rudolph and Andries Pretorius helped Mpande kaSenzangakhona in his revolt against his half-brother Dingane, who was then killed on an expedition north in the Hlatikhulu Forest. 
In gratitude for his help in overthrowing Dingane, the new king Mpande gave Gert Rudolph a concession to farm in this area.

He later became a South African Boer political figure and served as the last head of state of Natalia between 1842 and 1843.

<text>The House of Esterházy, also spelled Eszterházy (), is a Hungarian noble family with origins in the Middle Ages. From the 17th century, the Esterházys were the greatest landowner magnates of the Kingdom of Hungary, during the time that it was part of the Habsburg monarchy and later Austria-Hungary. During the history of the Habsburg Empire, the Esterházy family were consistently loyal to the Habsburg rulers. The Esterházys received the title of &quot;Graf&quot; (Count) in 1626, and the Forchtenstein line received the title of &quot;Fürst&quot; (Prince) from the Holy Roman Emperor in 1712.

==History==
The Esterházys arose among the minor nobility of the northern part of the Kingdom of Hungary (today&#x27;s southwest Slovakia), originally a branch of the Salamon clan (&quot;de genere Salamon&quot;) by the name &quot;Zerházi&quot; (&quot;de Zerhásház&quot; / &quot;de Zyrház&quot; / &quot;de Zyrhas&quot;). Their first known ancestor was Mokud (Mocud) from the Salamon clan, who was a military serviceman and landowner in the Csallóköz region of Western Hungary (today Žitný ostrov in southwestern Slovakia), and Pristaldus, a judicial office-holder in the court of Béla III of Hungary.

The name Esterházy was first used by Benedict Zerhas de Zerhashaz (1508–1553), who in 1539 took over the wealth of his wife, Ilona Bessenyei de Galántha. Their son, Ferenc Esterházy (1533–1604) inherited the coat of arms and title of his mother and the full surname of the family became &quot;Eszterházy de Galántha&quot;, Galanta being a small town east of Bratislava (, ), now capital of Slovakia.

The family rose to prominence under Count Nikolaus Esterházy (1583–1645) and his son, Prince Paul Esterházy (1635–1713). In the 17th century, after Nikolaus&#x27; acquisitions, the family split into four main family lines:
* the older Forchtenstein (Hungarian: &quot;Fraknó&quot;) line: founded by Nikolaus Esterházy, main seat: Eisenstadt (&quot;Kismarton&quot;)
* The three cadet branches:
** the younger Forchtenstein line
** the Zólyom line: founded by Paul Esterházy (died 1645)
** the Csesznek line: founded by Daniel Esterházy (died 1654)

In 1626 the Esterházys were granted the title of Count and in 1712, the older Forchtenstein line received the title of (Ruling) Prince from the Holy Roman Emperor. They had a Sovereign State when they obtained the former Edelstetten Abbey as an Imperial Principality in 1804.

The success of the family arose from the steady accumulation of land, and loyalty both to the Roman Catholic Church and the Habsburg Emperor, the latter factor being the most important. A consistent theme of Hungarian history was an ardent and sometimes violent wish to become free of Austrian rule, a wish that was finally fulfilled at the end of World War I. The Esterházy princes were consistently loyal to the Habsburg monarchy, on several occasions rendered vital services to it in times of crisis. These included the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683, and the occupation of Vienna by Napoleon in 1809.

The family acquired its property in three principal ways: redistribution of lands taken from Protestants in the Counter-Reformation, redistribution of lands conquered from the Ottoman Empire, and felicitous marriages. Most of these lands were situated in present-day Austria, Slovakia and Hungary. The family ultimately became the largest landowners in the Habsburg Empire, and their income sometimes exceeded that of the Emperor.

==Residences==

The family derived its name from the settlement Esterháza, Kingdom of Hungary. The settlement no longer exists, and is not to be confused with the later castle of the same name which they inhabited since the Middle Ages. Since 1421 they have been the owners of a property in Galánta.

The most important seat of the Esterházys was Kismarton (today Eisenstadt, Austria), since the heads of the family chose to make a castle in this tiny village their primary residence. A fortified stronghold had been built there in the 14th century; after the Esterházys acquired it they rebuilt it 1663–1672 to what is now the princely Schloss Esterházy. Their practical reason for choosing to create and maintain the princely court at Eisenstadt may have been that while the region was in Hungary, it had been mainly settled by Germans, and was situated rather close to the Habsburgs&#x27; Imperial residence, Vienna. (The region remained part of Hungary until 1921, when it was handed over to Austria according to the Treaty of Saint-Germain, 1919, and the Treaty of Trianon, 1920.)

The Esterházys maintained a number of other residences throughout the Kingdom of Hungary, including Transylvania (today part of Romania), and those Esterházy princes who preferred the stylish life of the capital spent most of their time in Vienna. In the 1770s, Prince Nikolaus Esterházy, who disliked Vienna, had a magnificent new palace constructed in Fertőd, Hungary. It was built on the site of a former hunting lodge. Today this is the most admired of the Esterházy homes, often called the &quot;Hungarian Versailles.&quot;

==Nomenclature==
The main line of the Esterházy family were generally bilingual, in Hungarian (as a result of their ethnicity) and German (as they were aristocrats of the Austrian Empire). Esterházys living in parts of the Kingdom of Hungary where other languages were spoken by the population also spoke those languages, especially Slavic languages in Slavic areas.
Some family members went by both Hungarian and (rather distinct) German names. Thus, Antal Pál (Hungarian) was the same person as Paul Anton (German), and József Miklós was the same person as Nikolaus Josef. In discussions written in English, the Esterházy princes are occasionally given English versions of their names, as in &quot;Nicholas&quot;.

The family name is also rendered variously: Eszterházy (Hungarian spelling), Esterházy (German), and Esterhazy (typographic convenience). The full family name since the 16th century was Eszterházy de Galántha (later also styled &quot;von/of Galanta&quot;). The Latinised form of the family name, Estoras, in 2009 is used to label fine Esterházy wines.
The Esterházy family is known for its association with the composer Joseph Haydn (1732–1809), who served as their Kapellmeister. Haydn was hired by Prince Paul Anton in 1761, and from 1762 to 1790 served under Paul Anton&#x27;s successor Nikolaus. During the following reign, that of Prince Anton (1790–1794), the Esterházy family mostly did without the services of musicians, and Haydn, retained on a nominal appointment, spent most of this time in trips to England. Finally, during the reign of Nikolaus II, Haydn worked for the family on a part-time basis. He spent his summers in Eisenstadt and annually composed a mass for the name day of the Prince&#x27;s wife (and Haydn&#x27;s friend), Princess Maria Josepha Hermengilde (1768–1845). Haydn continued to perform these duties until his health failed in 1802.

==Lines of the family==
The first prominent member of the family was Ferenc Zerházy (1563–1594), who was elevated to the title of baron of Galántha (an estate his family had held since 1421) and took the name Esterházy. Family history since this time is described according to three lines of descent, each originating in one of Ferenc&#x27;s sons: the Fraknó (or Forchtenstein) line, the Csesznek line, and the Zólyom (or Zvolen) line.

===Fraknó (Forchtenstein) line===
The Fraknó (Forchtenstein) line became &quot;the most prominent of the three&quot;.
In the discussion that follows, Hungarian names are given in brackets.

====Count Nikolaus [Miklós] (1583–1645)====
Nikolaus was born in Galanta. Raised as a Protestant, he later converted to Catholicism. Created Count by the Emperor in 1626, he achieved great wealth in part by marrying (twice) into money.

In 1625, Nikolaus was elected Palatine of Hungary, the King&#x27;s chief lieutenant within Royal Hungary. Nikolaus laid out what became the long-term family strategy, allying himself with the Catholic religion and the Habsburg emperor. He fought against the Protestant champions Gábor Bethlen and György Rákóczi and sought to free Hungary from Turkish domination.

====Prince Paul [Pál] (1635–1713)====
Paul was the third son of Nicholas, born in Eisenstadt. Elected Palatine in 1681 and created Prince of the Holy Roman Empire (in Hungary the title of Prince did not exist till the 20th century) in 1687 by the Emperor. Paul was a poet, a harpsichordist, and a composer; a number of his cantatas survive; see Harmonia Caelestis. He also wrote a number of religious works. Under Paul the palace in Eisenstadt was rebuilt. Paul served as commander of troops in southern Hungary, during the struggle against the Turks, starting in 1667, and his troops were among the coalition that raised the siege of Vienna in 1683. He also played an important role in suppressing the autonomy of the existing Hungarian nobility.

The line that descended from Paul, the first Esterházy prince, is given as in the following figure. The sequence of princes that follow him continues below.

====Prince Michael [Mihály] (1671–1721)====
Son of Paul, he was the first to benefit from a 1712 decree of Emperor Charles VI, which made the title of Prince hereditary among the Esterházys. Under him, the family seat at Eisenstadt evolved into a provincial musical center. He died 24 March 1721.

====Prince Joseph [József Simon Antal] (1688–1721)====
Half-brother of Michael, he reigned for only 11 weeks, as he died on 7 June 1721. As his son Paul Anton was only ten, authority was assigned to two regents: Count Georg Erdödy, and his widow Maria Octavia von Gilleis (c. 16861762). The latter was responsible for introducing the German language to the court.

====Prince Paul Anton [Pál Antal] (1711–1762)====
The eldest son of Joseph. In his youth he studied in Leyden and also served as a soldier, rising to the rank of Field Marshal. He served as imperial ambassador to Naples from 1750 to 1752, and traveled extensively.

Paul Anton was a musical prince; he played the violin, the flute, and the lute, and compiled a large inventory of musical manuscripts. Paul Anton also played an important role as a patron of music. In 1728, his mother Maria Octavia, &quot;probably at her son&#x27;s instigation&quot; engaged the composer Gregor Werner to be the family&#x27;s Kapellmeister (music director), a post in which Werner served for several decades. Much later (1761), Paul Anton engaged Joseph Haydn to be his Vice-Kapellmeister in 1761, taking over most of the aging Werner&#x27;s duties. At the same time, he upgraded the court orchestra, hiring several virtuosi who served under Haydn; the composer recognized their ability by writing many solo parts in his early symphonies.
====Prince Nikolaus &quot;the Magnificent&quot; [Miklós József] (1714–1790)====
The second son of Joseph and brother of Paul II, in his youth a decorated soldier. He was the primary patron of Haydn and builder of Esterháza (see above).
====Prince Anton [Antal] (1738–1794)====
Son of Nikolaus I, married first, in 1763, Maria Theresia Gräfin Erdödy e Monyorokerek et Monoszlo (1745–1782), and second, in 1785 Maria Anna Gräfin von Hohenfeld (1768–1848). He was elevated to the status of Prince (&quot;Fürst&quot;) in 1783. He received the Order of St. Stephen in 1777. He was Captain of the Hungarian Noble Life Guard from September 1791 until his death in 1794, and commanded an autonomous corps on the Upper Rhine at the beginning of the War of the First Coalition. His Corps participated in various actions between July and October, 1792, after which he received the Commanders Cross of the Order of St. Stephen. His corps was later absorbed into other military formations. He was Colonel and Proprietor (Inhaber) of the 31st Infantry Regiment, from November 1777 to October 1780, and then Proprietor and Colonel of the 34th Infantry Regiment, from September 1780 until his death. He was initiated to the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1790, and also became an imperial Chamberlain. He disbanded the Esterházy musical establishment for the duration of his reign.
====Prince Nikolaus II [Miklós Ferdinánd] (1765–1833)====
Born in Vienna, on 12 December 1765, he was the son of Anton and his first wife Maria Theresia. He became reigning Prince on the death of his father in 1794.

Like several of his predecessors Nikolaus II pursued a military career. He is remembered for his amassing a large art collection, for his musical patronage of Haydn and Beethoven, for his sexual debauchery, and for his high expenditures. Ultimately these led to the family being placed under a sequestration order, roughly the equivalent of bankruptcy.

====Prince Paul Anton III [Pál Antal] (1786–1866)====
Served Austria in a series of diplomatic posts, and in 1848 was briefly Foreign Minister.

The family encountered financial trouble during his reign, and (according to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, ), &quot;the last years of his life were spent in comparative poverty and isolation, as even the Esterházy-Forchtenstein estates were unequal to the burden of supporting his fabulous extravagance and had to be placed in the hands of curators.&quot;
====Prince Nikolaus III [Miklós Pál] (1817–1894)====
Owing to financial trouble, Nikolaus III sold the family art collection &quot;on generous terms&quot; to the Austro-Hungarian state in 1870. The collection is, as a result, on public view today in the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest.

====Prince [Pál Antal Miklós] (1843–1898)====

====Prince Nikolaus IV [Miklós Pál] (1869–1920)====
The reign of Nikolaus IV was a time of revival for the Esterházy family fortunes. The family estates were made into flourishing businesses, including a &quot;traditional welfare net, providing security for employees.&quot; With the resulting improvement in the family finances, the family properties were finally released from decades of sequestration. In addition, the family palaces—including the long-abandoned Esterháza—were restored and provided with modern plumbing and electricity. In these efforts Nikolaus was greatly assisted by his wife, Princess Margit (1874–1910), née Countess Cziráky.

Prince Nikolaus IV, his wife Margit, their son Anton († 1944) and other family members are buried in the Esterházy family cemetery in Fertőd, which is located in a small park around two kilometers northeast of the Eszterháza Palace (position: ).

====Prince Paul V [Pál Maria Alois Antal Miklós Victor] (1901–1989)====

The lifetime of this prince witnessed momentous, often catastrophic changes for the Esterházy family. At the end of the First World War, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was split up, and the family&#x27;s land holdings thus came to be located in several different countries.

In 1938, the legal instrument of fideicommiss, which had allowed families to hold property in foundations owned by the whole family, but governed by the head of the family alone, was abolished in Austria (aristocratic families had used this instrument to finance the representative household of the head of the family as well as to maintain palaces and castles, and to pay allowances to family members without personal wealth.) After the dissolution of the Esterházy trust, prince Paul became the sole owner of the wealth accumulated therein so far.

The Second World War proved disastrous: the family was scattered during the war years, and at the end of the war the new Hungarian government carried out a comprehensive land reform, &quot;confiscating the land of gentry with estates of more than 50 hectares&quot;. Only the land in Austria remained in prince Paul&#x27;s possession. Further, in the years after 1945 Hungary came under the rule of the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic, an authoritarian Communist regime sponsored by the Soviet Union. Prince Paul endured a show trial and was sentenced to solitary confinement for 15 years. Freed in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, he moved to Zurich with his wife, Melinda Ottrubay, whom he had married in Budapest in 1945, and lived in Zurich, from there managing his Austrian domains, until his death.

Paul&#x27;s wealth was inherited by his wife Melinda. Since she had no children, she created several foundations to preserve the cultural and historic heritage of the family, with the historic family seat Schloss Esterházy in Eisenstadt as the centre of all activities. Her nephew Stefan Ottrubay acts as general manager.


====Prince Anton Rudolf Marie Georg Christoph Hubertus Johannes Karl Aglaë (born 1936)====
Prince Paul-Anton Nikolaus Maximilian, the heir to the line, born in Munich in 1986. The title of Prince has no legal standing in Hungary today, as noble titles were abolished in 1947 (for details see &quot;Hungarian nobility&quot;). In Austria, aristocratic titles were abolished in 1919.

===Other members of the Esterházy family===

==Esterházy properties==
While the family&#x27;s Hungarian residences and estates were lost in 1945, the Austrian and German properties still remain in the family. The widow of Prince Paul, Melinda Esterházy, created several foundations to preserve the cultural and historic heritage of the family.

== In fiction ==

Herman Melville references the family&#x27;s wealth in chapter 29 of &quot;Mardi&quot; (1849): &quot;But as sailors are mostly foundlings and castaways, and carry all their kith and kin in their arms and their legs, there hardly ever appears any heir-at-law to claim their estate; seldom worth inheriting, like Esterhazy&#x27;s.&quot;

Avram Davidson&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Eszterhazy&quot; stories are set in a fictitious ramshackle Balkan empire resembling Austria-Hungary, but with Ruritanian characteristics.

The character Toby Esterhase, who appears in several of John le Carré&#x27;s spy novels, either is or pretends to be a member of the Esterházy family.

The character Helen Pendergast (deceased) and her brother Judson Esterházy (deceased) appear in the &quot;Special Agent Pendergast&quot; series by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child.

<text>The Balibo Five was a group of journalists for Australian commercial television networks who were murdered in the period leading up to the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. The Balibo Five were based in the town of Balibo in East Timor (then Portuguese Timor), where they were killed on 16 October 1975 during Indonesian incursions before the invasion. Roger East travelled to Balibo soon after to investigate the likely deaths of the Five and was later executed by members of the Indonesian military on the docks of Dili.

In 2007, an Australian coroner ruled that they had been deliberately killed by Indonesian special forces soldiers. The official Indonesian version is that the men were killed by cross-fire during the battle for the town. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, the Australian Government has never challenged this view in order to avoid damaging relations with Indonesia.

After the ruling, newly elected Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd declared &quot;those responsible should be held to account... You can&#x27;t just sweep this to one side&quot;. However, no meaningful action was taken after he was elected.
The house that the Balibo five resided in was owned by a Chinese family, who had fled across the border as refugees to the neighbouring Indonesian village of Atumbua. 
From there they travelled to Portugal and finally settled in Australia.
The Patriarch was named Gum Nyiang Lay.

==The journalists==
The group comprised two Australians, reporter Greg Shackleton, 29, and sound recordist Tony Stewart, 21; a New Zealander, Gary Cunningham, 27, cameraman for HSV-7 (now part of the Seven Network) in Melbourne; and two Britons, cameraman Brian Peters, 24, and reporter Malcolm Rennie, 29, both working for TCN-9 (now part of the Nine Network) in Sydney.

While the men were aware that Indonesian troops were to mount an attack on the town of Balibo, they believed that, as journalists, they would not be considered military targets. Greg Shackleton was filmed painting an Australian flag and the word &#x27;AUSTRALIA&#x27; on the wall of a house in the town square. Balibo House Trust, established in 2003 with seed funding from the Victorian Government and television stations 7 and 9, now owns this house and preserves it as a community learning centre.

Senior diplomats told the 2007 coroner&#x27;s inquest of their understanding that &quot;the killing was done by the Indonesian military and that it was deliberate&quot;.

According to historian Clinton Fernandes:
=== Roger East ===

Roger East, 53, an Australian AAP-Reuters journalist, travelled to East Timor to investigate the deaths of the five men. East was captured in Dili by the Indonesian military on 7 December 1975, the day of the invasion, and executed by firing squad on the morning of 8 December with his body being disposed of in the ocean. He has been referred to as the forgotten sixth member of the Balibo Five. Calls for an inquest into East&#x27;s death have been rejected.

A 1999 government enquiry into the deaths of the Balibo Five and Roger East, conducted by the former chairman of the National Crime Authority and Australian Government Solicitor Tom Sherman, found no evidence of murder but accused Indonesia of burning their bodies in a &quot;charade&quot; to destroy all evidence of a &quot;monumental blunder&quot; following their deaths in crossfire. However, in contrast to the Balibo incident, the killing of Roger East:&quot;took place in an urban area with a number of uninvolved persons in close proximity. The quality of the evidence on Roger East&#x27;s death was much higher. The evidence came from two eyewitnesses, supported by strong circumstantial evidence of the killing from two further witnesses. In relation to Roger East, I have concluded that it is more likely than not he was summarily executed by an unidentified Indonesian soldier late on the morning of December 8, 1975, in the wharf area of Dili&quot;.

==Advocacy==

===Family members===
Shirley Shackleton (1931–2023), widow of Greg, led the campaign for an enquiry into the killings. She was also an outspoken supporter of East Timor&#x27;s fight for independence.

In 1994, Brian Peters&#x27; sister, Maureen Tolfree, became involved with the East Timor issue, having heard of a demonstration in her home town of Bristol against the sale of BAE Hawk fighter jets to Indonesia.
Musician Paul Stewart was a teenager when his 21-year-old brother Tony died. He later formed the Dili Allstars with Colin Buckler (of the band Painters and Dockers). They recorded a song with East Timorese musician Gil Santos to protest the capture of East Timorese resistance leader Xanana Gusmão by Indonesian armed forces in 1992. Stewart worked as a consultant on the 2009 film &quot;Balibo&quot;, saying that it was a difficult but rewarding experience, and that it was one that finally presented the truth to the world. Now running a charity that donates musical instruments to East Timor, Stewart said the film highlighted the Australian government&#x27;s lack of action over the deaths of the journalists: &quot;To this day, the one phone call my mother&#x27;s had from the Government came a couple of weeks after it all happened when someone from the embassy in Jakarta called and asked, &#x27;Where should we send the bill for the coffin? he said. Malcolm Rennie&#x27;s mother, Minna, later became involved with the issue until her death, as did his cousin Margaret Wilson.

===Political advocacy===

In 2006, the International Press Institute sent a letter to United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, to express concern that UN investigators had failed to fully investigate the deaths of the Balibo Five, as well as three other journalists killed in Timor-Leste in 1975 and 1999, and to request that the UN reopen their investigations. Robert Connolly, director of the 2009 film, said, &quot;It&#x27;s quite clear the journalists were murdered. The current Indonesian and Australian (government) point of view, that they were killed in crossfire, is quite frankly absurd. We seek out war criminals from World War II, so to dismiss calls for justice for the Balibo Five is crazy&quot;.

In the Parliament of Australia, the two leading advocates have been Senators Nick Xenophon and Scott Ludlam, who have frequently spoken in the Australian Senate and lodged motions, as well as numerous campaigns in the news media. Writing in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, Xenophon stated:
== 2007 inquest into death of Brian Peters ==
On 5 February 2007, the New South Wales (NSW) Coroner&#x27;s Court began an inquest into Peters&#x27; death. Although he was a British citizen, lawyers for the journalists&#x27; families successfully argued that, as Peters was a resident of New South Wales at the time of his death, NSW jurisdiction applied. This was the first public inquiry held regarding the fate of the Balibo Five that had powers to call witnesses.

On the first day of the inquest, Yunus Yosfiah, former Minister for Information in the Habibie Government in Indonesia in 1998 and 1999, was accused of having led the 1975 attack in Balibo. Allegations were also raised that the journalists&#x27; bodies were dressed post-mortem in military uniforms and posed with weapons to make them appear to have taken an active part in the fighting. The Australian media reported that the Australian Defence Signals Directorate intercepted an Indonesian military radio communication suggesting that the five were killed on the orders of superiors. An eyewitness account described seeing the five men before they were killed. &quot;At this point Indonesian Army Captain Yunus Yosfiah and his team shot the journalists who were unarmed with their hands in the air ... I saw them shoot. A lot of them were firing. They fired towards the white people&quot;.

According to evidence presented, the fifth Balibo victim locked himself in a bathroom but was stabbed in the back with a special forces knife when he emerged. Mark Tedeschi QC, in his closing statement to the inquest, stated, &quot;There is incontrovertible evidence, including eyewitness accounts, that Indonesian troops deliberately killed the Balibo five newsmen. At least three of the journalists were shot after an order was given by Captain Yunus Yosfiah and the fifth man was stabbed by officer Christoforus Da Silva. It is highly unlikely the Captain would have made the decision to kill the newsmen without the sanction of his superior officers. There is enough evidence to refer the case to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to consider prosecuting two unnamed people for the war crime of wilful killing&quot;. The NSW coroner investigating held that &quot;The Balibo Five ... were shot and/or stabbed deliberately, and not in the heat of battle&quot; in order to silence them from exposing Indonesia&#x27;s 1975 East Timor invasion.

==War crimes investigation==
On 9 September 2009, it was announced that the Australian Federal Police were launching a war crimes probe into the deaths of the Balibo Five.

In 2009, former Indonesian soldier Gatot Purwanto told the ABC the men were shot deliberately but not executed. He says he was about 30 metres (yards) away when Indonesian soldiers fired on the house in which the men were sheltering. &quot;We knew they were foreigners, but we didn&#x27;t think about whether they were journalists or not, because in a battle, the instinct is if they&#x27;re not friends, then they could kill us&quot;, he said. He said he was with Special Forces captain Yunus Yosfiah when the Balibo Five were spotted. A coronial inquest into the deaths of the men found Yosfiah, who was later an Indonesian Government minister, ordered the killings.

Professor Ben Saul, who acted for the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) at the NSW inquiry, said there are &quot;complexities&quot; in the legal situation relating to prosecuting a war crime. &quot;It has to show that there was an international armed conflict between Indonesia and Portugal … and that in the context of that the journalist were killed&quot;, he said, adding &quot;I think the legal case for that conflict&#x27;s existence is very strong on the facts&quot;. He said that while the criminal standard of proof was much higher for the police than in a coronial inquest, the AFP have not &quot;satisfactorily&quot; explained whether they had exhausted all lines of inquiry.

The AFP then concluded, in 2014, that there was insufficient evidence to prove an offence.

==40th anniversary==

On 15 October 2015, Xenophon and Fernandes wrote in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;: &quot;We remember the Balibo Five today not because journalists are any more special than other civilians, but because journalists play a crucial role in bringing information about human rights violations to the outside world&quot;. On 16 October 2015, the day of the 40th anniversary, mourners gathered at a dawn service in front of the War Correspondents Memorial at the Australian War Memorial to remember the Balibo Five and Roger East. Mourners included family members, representatives of major Australian news networks, the journalists&#x27; union, former Australian diplomats, and Senator Xenophon. When the War Correspondents Memorial was opened in September 2015, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said: &quot;Our democracy depends on a free and courageous press. It is the war correspondents that have to tell the truth often in the face of considerable criticism&quot;.

==Theatrical depictions==

===Film===

A feature film about the killing of the men, called &quot;Balibo&quot;, was produced in 2009 by Arenafilm, Australia, written by David Williamson and directed by Robert Connolly. The film is based on &quot;Cover-Up&quot;, by Jill Jolliffe, an Australian journalist who met the men before they were killed. The book has been a source of controversy because of its criticism of some of the people involved in the campaign for justice.
The film is largely based on the historical scholarship of Fernandes, who later wrote &quot;The Independence of East Timor: Multidimensional Perspectives&quot;.

The Balibo killings episode was also fictionalised for the opening sequence of the 1982 film &quot;Brothers&quot;, written by Roger Ward and directed by Terry Bourke.

===Theatre===
In 2011, the Melbourne Theatre Company and Western Australia&#x27;s Black Swan State Theatre Company commissioned Australian playwright Aidan Fennessy to write a new work on the theme of the Balibo Five.
Entitled &quot;National Interest&quot;, the play focuses on the family of slain journalist Tony Stewart, who was Fennessy&#x27;s cousin. It was performed in Perth and Melbourne during 2012.

Coinciding with the play&#x27;s premiere season, on 20 May 2012, East Timor&#x27;s President Jose Ramos Horta presented Paul Stewart with a medal of merit awarded posthumously to his brother Tony.

The script of the play won the People&#x27;s Choice award at the Victorian Premier&#x27;s Literary Awards in 2012.

<text>The Kalchyk () is a river in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts of Ukraine. It is historically known as the Kalka. It flows into the Kalmius, which it enters near the city of Mariupol.

Supposedly, the river was the scene of the Battle of the Kalka River between the Mongol Empire and Kievan Rus&#x27; in 1223. It was also the scene of the decisive Battle of the Kalka River (1381) between Mamai and Tokhtamysh which ended the Great Troubles (1359–1381), a war of succession within the Golden Horde.

<doc id="747561" wikidata="Q7378799" url="?curid=747561" title="Ruins of Adventure">
<text>Ruins of Adventure is a &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; module that was based on the &quot;Gold Box&quot; role-playing video game &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, published in 1988 by Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI). Mike Breault stated that TSR chose him, Winter, Cook, and Ward to work on the design and writing for &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot;, indicating that the material was originally created for the game. However, according to the editors of &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine, &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; was based on &quot;Ruins of Adventure&quot;, and not vice versa. The plot loosely tracks that of the computer game.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Ruins of Adventure&quot; contains four short Forgotten Realms adventure scenarios which are connected and adapted from the &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; computer game, and take place in the devastated town of Phlan.

The adventurers are hired to remove evil forces from Phlan, presumably by killing them. They hear rumor of a &quot;Boss&quot; controlling them and seek him out. This &quot;Boss&quot; proves to be a worthy adversary, but in the end the adventurers defeat him.

===Locations===
There are various locations in the fictional city of Phlan. Each of these locations comes with a map and detailed area description. These locations include:
* Kovel Mansion
* The Slum District
* The Temple of Bane
* Kuto&#x27;s Well
* Mantor&#x27;s Library
* Stojanow Gate
* Podol Plaza
* The Cadorna Textile House
* Valhingen Graveyard
* Valjevo Castle
* Sorcerer&#x27;s Island
* Zhentil Keep Outpost

===Pre-generated characters===
There are numerous pre-generated characters in this book. Monsters each have their own stats prepared and there are quite a few non-player characters.

==Publication history==
&quot;Ruins of Adventure&quot; was written by James Ward, David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook, Steve Winter, and Mike Breault, with a cover by Clyde Caldwell, and was published by TSR in 1988 as a 96-page book.

<doc id="747568" wikidata="Q84388" url="?curid=747568" title="Volker Rühe">
<text>Volker Rühe (born 25 September 1942) is a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). He served as German Defence minister from 1 April 1992, succeeding Gerhard Stoltenberg during the first government of a reunified Germany in the fourth cabinet of Chancellor Kohl, to the end of the fifth Kohl Cabinet on 27 October 1998. During his time at the Defence Ministry Rühe played a central role in placing NATO enlargement on the German political agenda. He unsuccessfully ran for the office of minister-president of the German state Schleswig-Holstein in the year 2000, eventually losing against incumbent Heide Simonis.

==Early political career==
From 1976 to 2005 Rühe was a member of the German Bundestag. After the Christian Democrats returned to power in 1982, he joined the CDU/CSU parliamentary group&#x27;s leadership under its new chairman Alfred Dregger.

Under the leadership of CDU chairman and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Rühe held the position of Secretary General of his party from 1989 until 1992, including during the period of German reunification. In this capacity, he succeeded Heiner Geissler and was put in charge of administrative matters and electoral tactics. At a party convention in late 1992, the CDU surprisingly replaced Rühe with Heinz Eggert, a representative from East Germany, as one of Kohl&#x27;s four deputies.

==Federal Minister of Defence, 1992–1998==
As Germany&#x27;s longest-serving defense minister, Rühe oversaw the country&#x27;s integration of the former East German army, expanded Germany&#x27;s role within NATO and was an early proponent of NATO&#x27;s expansion eastward. He also proposed more spending on defense and won public backing as well as cross-party support for a Bundeswehr role in international peacekeeping, thus overcoming a German aversion to the use of force—in any circumstances—prevalent after 1945.

During his time in office, German military forces were engaged in numerous UN-linked operations outside the NATO region, including 1,700 soldiers in Somalia (logistic support); 122 in Cambodia (medical unit); two ships with combined crews totaling 420 people in the Adriatic Sea (air-navy patrol); 60 in Bosnia-Herzegovina (relief flights), and 40 in Iraq (UN monitoring staff).

Rühe frequently expressed frustration with restrictions on German troops joining international peacekeeping missions, and faced public criticism of the increasing deployment of German military forces abroad. In 1992, the SPD (unsuccessfully) filed a legal challenge in the Federal Constitutional Court, arguing that the deployment of German forces in the Adriatic violated their constitutional limits on their use. Later, Rühe had to inform the German public in October 1993 about the death of Sgt. Alexander Arndt, a 26-year-old army medic; Arndt had become the first German soldier to die on duty in an area of tension since World War II after he was shot by an unknown assailant in Cambodia.

Under Rühe&#x27;s leadership, Germany began destroying stockpiles of tanks and other heavy weapons in August 1992, becoming the first country to implement the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. After failing narrowly to stop the Eurofighter Typhoon project when he took office in 1992, Rühe negotiated down the number of aircraft the air force ordered, as well as the cost of each. In 1993, he canceled plans to buy Lapas, a $1 billion American-designed high-altitude reconnaissance system, after it was revealed that the system&#x27;s German subcontractor was at the center of a political scandal about reported bribery of Bavarian Minister-President Max Streibl.

In 1997, Rühe suspended a lieutenant general and instituted disciplinary action against a colonel after it was revealed that Manfred Roeder, a neo-Nazi with a criminal record of bombings, had been invited to give a speech to the country&#x27;s most prestigious military academy in 1995.

==Later political career==
Between 1998 and 2000, Rühe served as the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

By 2000, Rühe was considered a potential opponent of Angela Merkel for the CDU leadership; however, he eventually dropped out of the race.

In 2004, Rühe from the opposition was named by the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder to lead Germany&#x27;s campaign for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. That same year, Schröder sent Rühe to Moscow for talks with President Vladimir Putin on the Orange Revolution. Between 2014 and 2015, he headed a crossparty committee to review the country&#x27;s parliamentary rules on military deployments.

==Other activities==
===Corporate roles===
* Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Senior Advisor
* Hamburg-Mannheimer Versicherungs-AG, Member of the Advisory Board

===Non-profit organizations===
* International Crisis Group, Member of the Board
* European Leadership Network (ELN), Member of the Advisory Board, Member of the Task Force on Cooperation in Greater Europe
* Atlantik-Brücke Foundation, Member of the Board of Trustees
* German Civil Service Federation, Member

==Political positions==
===Domestic policy===
Domestically, Rühe was an outspoken advocate of tighter immigration laws.

In 2000, as part of the search for a new chair of the CDU, Rühe led an effort to stop frontrunner Angela Merkel that included overtures to Kurt Biedenkopf to serve as an interim leader. Ahead of the party&#x27;s leadership election in 2018, Biedenkopf publicly endorsed Friedrich Merz to succeed Merkel as chair.

===Foreign policy===
In 1985, Rühe strongly urged that Europe&#x27;s four major powers – France, Britain, Italy and West Germany – formulate a common European position on the Reagan Administration&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative.

In 1995, Rühe withdrew an invitation for his Moscow counterpart, Pavel Grachev, to visit Germany after Grachev insulted leading critics of the war in Chechnya. At the time, this was regarded as throwing into question German-Russian military cooperation on European security issues following the country&#x27;s reunification. During the Grozny ballistic missile attack in 1999, Rühe called for freezing Western loans to Russia.

In 2010, Rühe wrote an open letter explaining the strategy of including Russia into NATO to counter balance asian powers.
In 2013, Rühe appeared alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin and François Fillon at the Valdai Discussion Club. He was quoted by &quot;Neue Presse&quot; expressing sympathy for Putin and arguing for an intensive dialogue between the German government and &quot;the Kremlin&quot; on the subject of the American proposed &quot;missile defense system&quot;. &quot;We are talking as if Iran already had nuclear weapons... we can&#x27;t continue with deterrence, like during the Cold War.&quot; In 2015, he joined other foreign policy experts, including Igor Ivanov and Ana Palacio, in calling for a possible Memorandum of Understanding between NATO and the Russian Federation on the Rules of Behaviour for the Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters between the two sides.

In a 2019 interview, Rühe blamed his successor Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg for &quot;having destroyed the Bundeswehr&quot;.

<doc id="747573" wikidata="Q2552748" url="?curid=747573" title="Waterboarding">
<text>Waterboarding is a form of torture in which water is poured over a cloth covering the face and breathing passages of an immobilized captive, causing the person to experience the sensation of drowning. In the most common method of waterboarding, the captive&#x27;s face is covered with cloth or some other thin material and immobilized on their back at an incline of 10 to 20 degrees. Torturers pour water onto the face over the breathing passages, causing an almost immediate gag reflex and creating a drowning sensation for the captive. Normally, water is poured intermittently to prevent death; however, if the water is poured uninterruptedly it will lead to death by asphyxia. Waterboarding can cause extreme pain, damage to lungs, brain damage from oxygen deprivation, other physical injuries including broken bones due to struggling against restraints, and lasting psychological damage. Adverse physical effects can last for months, and psychological effects for years. The term &quot;water board torture&quot; appeared in press reports as early as 1976.

Waterboarding has been used in diverse places and at various points in history, including the Spanish and Flemish Inquisitions, by the United States military during the Philippine–American War, by Japanese and German officials during World War II, by the French in the Algerian War, by the U.S. during the Vietnam War and the war on terror, by the Pinochet regime in Chile, by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, by British security forces during the Troubles, and by South African police during the Apartheid era. Historically, waterboarding has been viewed as an especially severe form of torture. The first known waterboarding has been attested to have taken place in 1516 in Graz, Austria.

==Origin of the term==
While the technique has been used in various forms for centuries, the term &quot;water board&quot; was recorded first in a 1976 UPI report: &quot;A Navy spokesman admitted use of the &#x27;water board&#x27; torture ... to &#x27;convince each trainee that he won&#x27;t be able to physically resist what an enemy would do to him.&#x27;&quot; The verb-noun &quot;waterboarding&quot; dates from 2004. Techniques using forcible drowning to extract information had hitherto been referred to as &quot;water torture&quot;, &quot;water treatment&quot;, &quot;water cure&quot; or simply &quot;torture&quot;. Professor Darius Rejali of Reed College, author of &quot;Torture and Democracy&quot; (2007), speculates that the term waterboarding probably has its origin in the need for a euphemism.

==Technique==
The practice of waterboarding has differed. During the Algerian War of Independence and Marcos&#x27; dictatorship in the Philippines, waterboarding involved forcing the victim to swallow or inhale water. Other forms of waterboarding prevent water from entering the lungs. The United States Army&#x27;s Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) training occasionally included waterboarding, in a less severe form that only mimicked drowning. Different accounts of waterboarding by the United States disagree about how it is practiced. Some accounts describe saturated cloth and water being used to create a misperception of drowning, while others describe water entering the body.

The United States&#x27; Office of Legal Counsel in August 2002 responded to the request by the CIA for a legal opinion regarding the use of certain interrogation techniques. It included the following account of the CIA&#x27;s definition of waterboarding in a Top Secret 2002 memorandum as follows:

Historically in the West, the technique is known to have been used in the Spanish Inquisition. The suffocation of bound prisoners with water has been favored because, unlike most other torture techniques, it produces no marks on the body. CIA officers who have subjected themselves to the technique have lasted an average of 14 seconds before refusing to continue.

===Reported demonstrations===
In 2006 and 2007, Fox News and Current TV, respectively, demonstrated a waterboarding technique. In the videos, each correspondent is held against a board by the torturers.

Christopher Hitchens voluntarily subjected himself to a filmed demonstration of waterboarding in 2008, an experience which he recounted in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. He was bound on a horizontal board with a black mask over his face. A group of men said to be highly trained in this tactic, who demanded anonymity, carried out the torture. Hitchens was strapped to the board at the chest and feet, face up, and unable to move. Metal objects were placed in each of his hands, which he could drop if feeling &quot;unbearable stress&quot;, and he was given a code word that, if said, would immediately end the exercise. The interrogator placed a towel over Hitchens&#x27; face and poured water on it. After 16 seconds, Hitchens threw the metal objects to the floor and the torturers pulled the mask from his face, allowing him to breathe. Hitchens, who had previously expressed skepticism over waterboarding being considered a form of torture, changed his mind. Hitchens said of the matter:You may have read by now the official lie about this treatment, which is that it “simulates” the feeling of drowning. This is not the case. You feel that you are drowning because you &quot;are&quot; drowning—or, rather, being drowned, albeit slowly and under controlled conditions and at the mercy (or otherwise) of those who are applying the pressure.

==Mental and physical effects==
Allen Keller, the director of the Bellevue Hospital/New York University Program for Survivors of Torture, has treated &quot;a number of people&quot; who had been subjected to forms of near-asphyxiation, including waterboarding. In an interview for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, he argued that &quot;it was indeed torture. &#x27;Some victims were still traumatized years later&#x27;, he said. One patient couldn&#x27;t take showers, and panicked when it rained. &#x27;The fear of being killed is a terrifying experience&#x27;, he said&quot;. Keller also gave a full description in 2007 in testimony before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the practice.

The CIA&#x27;s Office of Medical Services noted in a 2003 memo that &quot;for reasons of physical fatigue or psychological resignation, the subject may simply give up, allowing excessive filling of the airways and loss of consciousness&quot;.

In an open letter in 2007 to U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, Human Rights Watch asserted that waterboarding can cause the sort of &quot;severe pain&quot; prohibited by (the implementation in the United States of the United Nations Convention Against Torture), that the psychological effects can last long after waterboarding ends (another of the criteria under 18 USC 2340), and that uninterrupted waterboarding can ultimately cause death.

==Classification as torture==
Waterboarding is considered to be torture by a wide range of authorities, including legal experts, politicians, war veterans, intelligence officials, military judges, and human rights organizations. David Miliband, then United Kingdom Foreign Secretary, described it as torture on 19 July 2008, and stated &quot;the UK unreservedly condemns the use of torture&quot;. Arguments have been put forward in the United States that it might not be torture in all cases, or that it is unclear. The U.S. State Department has recognized &quot;submersion of the head in water&quot; as torture in other circumstances, for example, in its 2005 Country Report on Tunisia.

The United Nations&#x27; &quot;Report of the Committee Against Torture: Thirty-fifth Session&quot; of November 2006, stated that state parties should rescind any interrogation techniques, such as waterboarding, that constitutes torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.

===Classification in the U.S.===
Whether waterboarding should be classified as a method of torture was not widely debated in the United States before it was alleged, in 2004, that members of the CIA had used the technique against certain suspected detained terrorists.

Subsequently, the U.S. government released the Bybee memo, a memorandum dated 1 August 2002, from Jay Bybee at the Office of Legal Counsel for White House Counsel Albert Gonzales. The OLC memo concluded that waterboarding did not constitute torture and could be used to interrogate enemy combatants. Bybee reasoned that &quot;in order for pain or suffering to rise to the level of torture, the statute requires that it be severe&quot; and that waterboarding did not cause severe pain or suffering either physically or mentally. A separate memo in July 2002, written by the Defense Department&#x27;s Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, described the use of waterboarding and other techniques of extreme duress as &quot;torture&quot; and said that its use could yield unreliable information, and warned that &quot;The unintended consequence of a U.S. policy that provides for the torture of prisoners is that it could be used by our adversaries as justification for the torture of captured U.S. personnel.&quot; This memo was forwarded to the Defense Department Office of the General Counsel, and then to the CIA&#x27;s acting general counsel and Justice Department, even as the George W. Bush administration authorized waterboarding and other measures.

For over three years during the George W. Bush administration, the Justice Department&#x27;s Office of Professional Responsibility conducted an investigation into the propriety of the Bybee memo and other memos by the Justice Department on waterboarding and other &quot;enhanced&quot; interrogation techniques. The OPR report findings were that former Deputy AAG John Yoo committed intentional professional misconduct and that former AAG Jay Bybee committed professional misconduct. These findings were dismissed in a memo from Associate Deputy Attorney General David Margolis, who found that Yoo showed &quot;poor judgment&quot; but did not violate ethical standards. Commentators have noted that the memos omitted key relevant precedents, including a Texas precedent under then-Governor George W. Bush when the state convicted and sentenced to prison for ten years a county sheriff for waterboarding a criminal suspect. Bush did not issue a pardon for the sheriff.

Former George W. Bush administration officials Dick Cheney and John Ashcroft have stated since leaving office that they do not consider waterboarding to be torture. At least one Republican member of the U.S. Congress, Ted Poe, has taken a similar position.

Other Republican officials have provided less definitive views regarding whether waterboarding is torture. Andrew C. McCarthy, a former Republican prosecutor including in the George W. Bush administration, has stated that when used in &quot;some number of instances that were not prolonged or extensive&quot;, waterboarding should not qualify as torture under the law. McCarthy has also stated that &quot;waterboarding is close enough to torture that reasonable minds can differ on whether it is torture&quot; and that &quot;[t]here shouldn&#x27;t be much debate that subjecting someone to [waterboarding] repeatedly would cause the type of mental anguish required for torture&quot;.

Many former senior George W. Bush administration officials, on the other hand, have seriously questioned or directly challenged the legality of waterboarding. These include former State Department Counselor Philip Zelikow, former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, former Homeland Security Chief Tom Ridge, former head of the Office of Legal Counsel Jack Goldsmith, General Ricardo Sanchez, FBI Director Robert Mueller, and former Convening Authority for the Guantanamo military commissions Susan J. Crawford.

During his tenure as head of the Justice Department&#x27;s Office of Legal Counsel in 2003–2004, Jack Goldsmith put a halt to the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique because of serious concern over its legality, but Goldsmith&#x27;s order was quickly reversed by others within the George W. Bush administration.

A Republican 2008 candidate for president—Senator John McCain, who himself was tortured during his years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam during the Vietnam War—has stated unequivocally several times that he considers waterboarding to be torture:

Professors such as Wilson R. Huhn have also challenged the legality of waterboarding.

In May 2008, author and journalist Christopher Hitchens voluntarily underwent waterboarding and concluded that it was torture. He also noted that he suffered ongoing psychological effects from the ordeal.

On May 22, 2009, radio talk show host Erich &quot;Mancow&quot; Muller subjected himself to waterboarding to prove that it is not torture, but changed his mind because of the experience.

On April 22, 2009, Fox News host Sean Hannity offered to be waterboarded for charity in order to prove that it did not amount to torture, though he did not follow through with it.

In a May 11, 2009 interview with Larry King, former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura stated:

On January 15, 2009, U.S. President-elect Barack Obama&#x27;s nominee for Attorney General, Eric Holder, told his Senate confirmation hearing that waterboarding is torture and the President cannot authorize it. In a press conference on April 30, President Obama also stated, &quot;I believe waterboarding was torture, and it was a mistake.&quot;

===Description by U.S. media===
In covering the debate on the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique by the U.S. government, U.S. reporters had to decide whether to use the term &quot;torture&quot; or &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; to describe waterboarding. National Public Radio&#x27;s ombudsman detailed this debate and why NPR had decided to refrain from using the word torture to describe waterboarding. Due to criticism of the policy by the media and to NPR directly, a second piece was written to further explain their position and a desire to describe the technique rather than simply describe it as torture.

==Historical uses==
===Spanish Inquisition===
A form of torture similar to waterboarding is called &quot;toca&quot;, and more recently &quot;Spanish water torture&quot;, to differentiate it from the better known Chinese water torture, along with &quot;garrucha&quot; (or strappado) and the most frequently used &quot;potro&quot; (or the rack). This was used infrequently during the trial portion of the Spanish Inquisition process. &quot;The &quot;toca&quot;, also called &quot;tortura del agua&quot;, consisted of introducing a cloth into the mouth of the victim, and forcing them to ingest water spilled from a jar so that they had the impression of drowning&quot;. William Schweiker claims that the use of water as a form of torture also had profound religious significance to the Inquisitors.

In general, the use of waterboarding seemed to be extensive in Spanish detention centers of the 1500s. Books from the time explain how to treat persons in custody, and used this &quot;light&quot; form of torture. After a specific way of beating, body, legs and arms, it was detailed how to pour 4 cuartillos (approx. 2.5 liters) of water over mouth and nose, with a covering cloth, making sure there was some cloth introduced in the mouth so water could also get in.

===Flemish Inquisition===
In Joos de Damhouder&#x27;s &quot;Praxis rerum criminalium&quot; (1554), a manual on the practice of criminal law, the chapter on torture and interrogation is illustrated with a woodcut of waterboarding, which it describes in detail. The Martyr&#x27;s Mirror depicts one incident of waterboarding used against the early Mennonites thus:

And as they did still not obtain anything from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I was at the end of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.

===Colonial times===

Agents of the Dutch East India Company used a precursor to waterboarding during the Amboyna massacre of English prisoners, which took place on the island of Amboyna in the Molucca Islands in 1623. At that time, it consisted of wrapping cloth around the victim&#x27;s head, after which the torturers &quot;poured the water softly upon his head until the cloth was full, up to the mouth and nostrils, and somewhat higher, so that he could not draw breath but he must suck in all the water&quot;. In one case, the torturer applied water three or four times successively until the victim&#x27;s &quot;body was swollen twice or thrice as big as before, his cheeks like great bladders, and his eyes staring and strutting out beyond his forehead&quot;.

===American prisons before World War I===
An editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of 6 April 1852, and a subsequent 21 April 1852 letter to the editors documents an incidence of waterboarding, then called &quot;showering&quot; or &quot;hydropathic torture&quot;, in New York&#x27;s Sing Sing prison of an inmate named Henry Hagan, who, after several other forms of beating and mistreatment, had his head shaved, and &quot;certainly three, and possibly a dozen, barrels of water were poured upon his naked scalp&quot;. Hagan was then placed in a yoke. A correspondent listed only as &quot;H&quot; later wrote: &quot;Perhaps it would be well to state more fully the true character of this &#x27;hydropathic torture.&#x27; The stream of water is about one inch in diameter, and falls from a of seven or eight feet. The head of the patient is retained in its place by means of a board clasping the neck; the effect of which is, that the water, striking upon the board, rebounds into the mouth and nostrils of the victim, almost producing strangulation. Congestion, sometimes of the heart or lungs, sometimes of the brain, not ensues; and death, in due season, has released some sufferers from the further ordeal of the water cure. As the water is administered officially, I suppose that it is not murder!&quot; H. then went on to cite an 1847 New York law which limited prison discipline to individual confinement &quot;upon a short allowance.&quot;

Prisoners in late 19th-century Alabama, and in Mississippi in the first third of the 20th century, also suffered waterboarding. In Alabama, in lieu of or in addition to other physical punishment, a &quot;prisoner was strapped down on his back; then &#x27;water [was] poured in his face on the upper lip, and effectually stop[ped] his breathing as long as there [was] a constant stream&#x27;.&quot; In Mississippi, the accused was held down, and water was poured &quot;from a dipper into the nose so as to strangle him, thus causing pain and horror, for the purpose of forcing a confession.&quot;

===During the Philippine–American War===

The U.S. army used waterboarding, called the &quot;water cure&quot;, during the Philippine–American War. It is not clear where this practice came from; it probably was adopted from the Filipinos, who themselves adopted it from the Spanish. Reports of &quot;cruelties&quot; from soldiers stationed in the Philippines led to Senate hearings on U.S. activity there.

Testimony described the waterboarding of Tobeniano Ealdama &quot;while supervised by ...Captain/Major Edwin F. Glenn&quot;. Elihu Root, United States Secretary of War, ordered a court martial for Glenn in April 1902.&quot; During the trial, Glenn &quot;maintained that the torture of Ealdama was &#x27;a legitimate exercise of force under the laws of war.&#x27;&quot; Though some reports seem to confuse Ealdama with Glenn, Glenn was found guilty and &quot;sentenced to a one-month suspension and a fifty-dollar fine&quot;, the leniency of the sentence due to the &quot;circumstances&quot; presented at the trial.

President Theodore Roosevelt privately rationalized the instances of &quot;mild torture, the water cure&quot; but publicly called for efforts to &quot;prevent the occurrence of all such acts in the future&quot;. In that effort, he ordered the court-martial of General Jacob H. Smith on the island of Samar, &quot;where some of the worst abuses had occurred&quot;. When the court-martial found only that he had acted with excessive zeal, Roosevelt disregarded the verdict and had the General dismissed from the Army.

Roosevelt soon declared victory in the Philippines, and the public lost interest in &quot;what had, only months earlier, been alarming revelations&quot;.

===By U.S. police before the 1940s===
The use of &quot;third degree interrogation&quot; techniques to compel confession, ranging from &quot;psychological duress such as prolonged confinement to extreme violence and torture&quot;, was widespread in early American policing. Lassiter classified the water cure as &quot;orchestrated physical abuse&quot;, and described the police technique as a &quot;modern day variation of the method of water torture that was popular during the Middle Ages&quot;. The technique employed by the police involved either holding the head in water until almost drowning, or laying on the back and forcing water into the mouth or nostrils. Such techniques were classified as &quot;&#x27;covert&#x27; third degree torture&quot; since they left no signs of physical abuse, and became popular after 1910 when the direct application of physical violence to force a confession became a media issue and some courts began to deny obviously compelled confessions. The publication of this information in 1931 as part of the Wickersham Commission&#x27;s &quot;Report on Lawlessness in Law Enforcement&quot; led to a decline in the use of third degree police interrogation techniques in the 1930s and 1940s.

===World War II===
During World War II, both Japanese military personnel, especially the Kempeitai, the Japanese police against those suspected of spying, and the officers of the Gestapo, the German secret police, used waterboarding as a method of torture. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, the Double Tenth Incident occurred. This included waterboarding, by the method of binding or holding down the victim on his back, placing a cloth over his mouth and nose, and pouring water onto the cloth. In this version, interrogation continued during the torture, with the interrogators beating the victim if he did not reply and the victim swallowing water if he opened his mouth to answer or breathe. When the victim could ingest no more water, the interrogators would beat or jump on his distended stomach.

Chase J. Nielsen, one of the U.S. airmen who flew in the Doolittle raid following the attack on Pearl Harbor, was subjected to waterboarding by his Japanese captors. At their trial for war crimes following the war, he testified &quot;Well, I was put on my back on the floor with my arms and legs stretched out, one guard holding each limb. The towel was wrapped around my face and put across my face and water poured on. They poured water on this towel until I was almost unconscious from strangulation, then they would let up until I&#x27;d get my breath, then they&#x27;d start over again... I felt more or less like I was drowning, just gasping between life and death.&quot; In 2007, Senator John McCain said that the United States military hanged Japanese soldiers for waterboarding American prisoners of war during World War II. A minimal sentence for Japanese soldiers convicted of waterboarding American soldiers was 15 years.

===By the French in the Algerian War===
The technique was also used during the Algerian War (1954–1962). French journalist Henri Alleg, who was subjected to waterboarding by French paratroopers in Algeria in 1957, is one of only a few people to have described in writing the first-hand experience of being waterboarded. His book &quot;La Question&quot;, published in 1958 with a preface by Jean-Paul Sartre subsequently banned in France until the end of the Algerian War in 1962, discusses the experience of being strapped to a plank, having his head wrapped in cloth and positioned beneath a running tap:

Alleg stated that he did not break under his ordeal of being waterboarded. He also stated that the incidence of &quot;accidental&quot; death of prisoners being subjected to waterboarding in Algeria was &quot;very frequent&quot;.

===Vietnam War===
Waterboarding was designated as illegal by U.S. generals in the Vietnam War. On 21 January 1968, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published a controversial front-page photograph of two U.S. soldiers and one South Vietnamese soldier participating in the waterboarding of a North Vietnamese POW near Da Nang. The article described the practice as &quot;fairly common&quot;. The photograph led to the soldier being court-martialled by a U.S. military court within one month of its publication, and he was discharged from the army. Another waterboarding photograph of the same scene, referred to as &quot;water torture&quot; in the caption, is also exhibited in the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City. After reports by Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Herbert, investigators confirmed that military interrogators of the 173rd Airborne Brigade &quot;repeatedly beat prisoners, tortured them with electric shocks and forced water down their throats&quot;. Interrogators employed a technique called the &quot;water rag&quot;, which involved pouring water onto a rag covering the captive&#x27;s nose and mouth.

===Pinochet dictatorship in Chile===

Based on the testimonies from more than 35,000 victims of the Pinochet regime, the Chilean Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture concluded that provoking a near-death experience by waterboarding is torture.

===Khmer Rouge===

The Khmer Rouge at the Tuol Sleng prison in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, used waterboarding as a method of torture between 1975 and 1979. The practice was perfected by Duch&#x27;s lieutenants Mam Nai and Tang Sin Hean and documented in a painting by former inmate Vann Nath, which is on display in the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. The museum also has on display boards and other actual tools used for waterboarding during the Khmer Rouge regime.

===Northern Ireland===

During the Troubles, an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland, there were instances of British security forces, including the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) waterboarding suspected Irish Republican Army (IRA) members. Former RUC interrogators who were active during the Troubles claimed that waterboarding, among other forms of torture, were systematically used against suspected IRA members in police custody. In October 1972, Liam Holden was arrested by members of the Parachute Regiment on the suspicion of being an IRA sniper who had killed a British paratrooper, Frank Bell. He was convicted the next year of the crime and sentenced to be executed, largely on the basis of an unsigned confession produced by a range of torture techniques, including waterboarding. Holden&#x27;s death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he spent 17 years in prison. On 21 June 2012, in the light of CCRC investigations which confirmed that the methods used to extract a confession from Holden were unlawful, he had his conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal in Belfast and was cleared of murder.

===Apartheid in the Union of South Africa===
The South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission received testimony from Charles Zeelie and Jeffrey Benzien, officers of the South African Police under Apartheid, that they used waterboarding, referred to as &quot;tubing&quot;, or the &quot;wet bag technique&quot; on political prisoners as part of a wide range of torture methods to extract information. Specifically, a cloth bag was wet and placed over victim&#x27;s heads, to be removed only when they were near asphyxiation; the procedure was repeated several times. The TRC concluded that the act constituted torture and a gross human rights violation, for which the state was responsible.

===U.S. military survival training===
Until 2007, all special operations units in all branches of the U.S. military and the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division employed the use of waterboarding as part of survival school (Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape) training, to psychologically prepare soldiers for the possibility of being captured by enemy forces. By 2002, many branches of the military had backed away from waterboarding trainees, at least in part &quot;because it hurt morale&quot;, and in November 2007 the practice was banned by the Department of Defense because it &quot;provided no instructional or training benefit to the student&quot;. John Yoo, former deputy assistant attorney general under President Bush stated that the United States has subjected 20,000 of its troops to waterboarding as part of SERE training prior to deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan.
Dr. Jerald Ogrisseg, former head of Psychological Services for the Air Force SERE School has stated in testimony before the U.S. Senate&#x27;s Committee on Armed Services that there are fundamental differences between SERE training and what occurs in real-world settings. Dr. Ogrisseg further states that his experience is limited to SERE training, but that he did not believe waterboarding to be productive in either setting.

Jane Mayer wrote for The New Yorker:

and continues to report:

However, according to a declassified Justice Department memo attempting to justify torture which references a still-classified report of the CIA Inspector General on the CIA&#x27;s use of waterboarding, among other &quot;enhanced&quot; interrogation techniques, the CIA applied waterboarding to detainees &quot;in a different manner&quot; than the technique used in SERE training:

The difference was in the manner in which the detainees&#x27; breathing was obstructed. At the SERE school and in the DoJ opinion, the subject&#x27;s airflow is disrupted by the firm application of a damp cloth over the air passages; the interrogator applies a small amount of water to the cloth in a controlled manner. By contrast, the Agency interrogator ... applied large volumes of water to a cloth that covered the detainee&#x27;s mouth and nose. One of the psychiatrist / interrogators acknowledged that the Agency&#x27;s use of the technique is different from that used in SERE training because it is &#x27;for real&#x27; and is more poignant and convincing.
According to the DOJ memo, the IG Report observed that the CIA&#x27;s Office of Medical Services (OMS) stated that &quot;the experience of the SERE psychologist / interrogators on the waterboard was probably misrepresented at the time, as the SERE waterboard experience is so different from the subsequent Agency usage as to make it almost irrelevant&quot; and that &quot;[c]onsequently, according to OMS, there was no a priori reason to believe that applying the waterboard with the frequency and intensity with which it was used by the psychologist/interrogators was either efficacious or medically safe.&quot;

==Contemporary use==

===United States===
====Use by law enforcement====
In 1983, San Jacinto County, Texas sheriff, James Parker, and three of his deputies were convicted for conspiring to force confessions. The complaint said they &quot;subject prisoners to a suffocating water torture ordeal to coerce confessions. This generally included the placement of a towel over the nose and mouth of the prisoner and the pouring of water into the towel until the prisoner began to move, jerk (twitch), or otherwise indicate suffocation and/or drowning&quot;. James Parker was sentenced to ten years in prison, and the deputies to four years.

====Use by intelligence officers====
The 21 June 2004 issue of &quot;Newsweek&quot; stated that the Bybee Memo, an early August 2002 legal memorandum drafted by John Yoo and signed by his boss, Jay S. Bybee, then head of the Office of Legal Counsel, described interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists or terrorist affiliates the George W. Bush administration would consider legal, was &quot;prompted by CIA questions about what to do with a top Qaeda captive, Abu Zubaydah, who had turned uncooperative... and was drafted after White House meetings convened by George W. Bush&#x27;s chief counsel, Alberto Gonzales, along with Defense Department general counsel William Haynes and David Addington, Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s counsel, who discussed specific interrogation techniques&quot;, citing &quot;a source familiar with the discussions&quot;. Amongst the methods they found acceptable was waterboarding. Jack Goldsmith, head of the Office of Legal Counsel (October 2003-June 2004) in the Department of Justice, later said this group was known as &quot;the war council&quot;.

In November 2005, ABC News reported that former CIA agents claimed that the CIA engaged in a modern form of waterboarding, along with five other &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot;, against suspected members of al Qaeda.

On 20 July 2007, U.S. President George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13440, banning torture during interrogation of terror suspects. While the guidelines for interrogation do not specifically ban waterboarding, the executive order refers to torture as defined by 18 USC 2340, which includes &quot;the threat of imminent death&quot;, as well as the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Reaction to the order was mixed, with the CIA satisfied that it &quot;clearly defined&quot; the agency&#x27;s authorities.

Human Rights Watch said that answers about what specific techniques had been banned lay in the classified companion document and that &quot;the people in charge of interpreting [that] document don&#x27;t have a particularly good track record of reasonable legal analysis&quot;.
On 14 September 2007, ABC News reported that sometime in 2006, CIA Director Michael Hayden asked for and received permission from the Bush administration to ban the use of waterboarding in CIA interrogations. A CIA spokesperson declined to discuss interrogation techniques, stating the techniques &quot;have been and continue to be lawful&quot;. ABC reported that waterboarding had been authorized by a 2002 Presidential finding. On 5 November 2007, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that its &quot;sources confirm... that the CIA has only used this interrogation method against three terrorist detainees and not since 2003.&quot; John Kiriakou, a former CIA officer, is the first official within the U.S. government to openly admit to the use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique, as of 10 December 2007.

On 6 February 2008, CIA director General Michael Hayden stated that the CIA had waterboarded three prisoners during 2002 and 2003, namely Abu Zubaydah, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.

On 23 February 2008, the Justice Department revealed that its internal ethics office was investigating the department&#x27;s legal approval for waterboarding of al Qaeda suspects by the CIA and was likely to make public an unclassified version of its report.

On 15 October 2008, it was reported that the Bush administration had issued a pair of secret memos to the CIA in June 2003 and June 2004 explicitly endorsing waterboarding and other torture techniques against al-Qaeda suspects. The memos were granted only after &quot;repeated requests&quot; from the CIA, who at the time were worried that the White House would eventually try to distance themselves from the issue. Field employees in the agency believed they could easily be blamed for using the techniques without proper written permission or authority. Until this point, the Bush administration had never been concretely tied to acknowledging the torture practices.

In December 2008, Robert Mueller, the Director of the FBI since 5 July 2001, had said that despite Bush Administration claims that waterboarding has &quot;disrupted a number of attacks, maybe dozens of attacks&quot;, he does not believe that evidence obtained by the U.S. government through enhanced interrogation techniques such as waterboarding disrupted one attack.

In an interview in January 2009, Dick Cheney acknowledged the use of waterboarding to interrogate suspects and said that waterboarding had been &quot;used with great discrimination by people who know what they&#x27;re doing and has produced a lot of valuable information and intelligence&quot;.

On 1 July 2009, the Obama administration announced that it was delaying the scheduled release of declassified portions of a report by the CIA Inspector General in response to a civil lawsuit. The CIA report reportedly cast doubt on the effectiveness of the torture used by CIA interrogators during the Bush administration. This was based on several George W. Bush-era Justice Department memos declassified in the Spring of 2009 by the U.S. Justice Department.

=====Abu Zubaydah=====
Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded by the CIA. He was detained in a &#x27;black site&#x27; prison in Thailand. Here, the CIA waterboarded him 83 times in a month. CIA operative also slammed his head against walls, deprived him of sleep, and kept him in a box.

In 2002, U.S. intelligence located Abu Zubaydah by tracing his phone calls. He was captured 28 March 2002, in a safehouse located in a two-story apartment in Faisalabad, Pakistan.

One of Abu Zubaydah&#x27;s FBI interrogators, Ali Soufan, wrote a book about his experiences. He later testified to Congress that Zubaydah was producing useful information in response to conventional interrogation methods, including the names of Sheikh Mohammed and Jose Padilla. He stopped providing accurate information in response to harsh techniques. Soufan, one of the FBI&#x27;s most successful interrogators, explained, &quot;When they are in pain, people will say anything to get the pain to stop. Most of the time, they will lie, make up anything to make you stop hurting them. That means the information you&#x27;re getting is useless.&quot;

Participating in his later interrogation by the CIA were two American psychologists, James Elmer Mitchell and R. Scott Shumate.

In December 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that there were some discrepancies regarding reports about the number of times Zubaydah was waterboarded. According to a previous account by former CIA officer John Kiriakou, Abu Zubaydah broke after just 35 seconds of waterboarding, which involved stretching cellophane over his mouth and nose and pouring water on his face to create the sensation of drowning. Kiriakou later admitted that he had no first hand knowledge of the interrogation and accused the CIA of using him to spread disinformation. In 2007, Kiriakou had told CNN&#x27;s &quot;American Morning&quot; that the waterboarding of Al Qaeda&#x27;s Abu Zubaydah indirectly led to the arrest of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

=====Khalid Sheikh Mohammed=====
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times while being interrogated by the CIA.

Pakistani intelligence agents say Mohammed was carrying a letter from bin Laden at the time of his arrest, but there is no evidence he knew bin Laden&#x27;s whereabouts. By this point, any information Mohammed had would have been years out of date.

After being subjected to repeated waterboarding, Mohammed claimed participation in thirty-one terrorist plots. On 15 June 2009, in response to a lawsuit by the ACLU, the government was forced to disclose a previously classified portion of a CIA memo written in 2006. It recounted Mohammed&#x27;s telling the CIA that he &quot;made up stories&quot; to stop from being tortured. Legal experts cast serious doubt as to the validity of Mohammed&#x27;s &quot;confessions&quot; as being false claims, and human rights activists raised serious concerns over the &quot;sham process&quot; of justice and use of torture.

During a radio interview on 24 October 2006, with Scott Hennen of radio station WDAY, Vice President Dick Cheney agreed with the use of waterboarding. The administration later denied that Cheney had confirmed the use of waterboarding, saying that U.S. officials do not talk publicly about interrogation techniques because they are classified. White House Press Secretary Tony Snow claimed that Cheney was not referring to waterboarding, despite repeated questions refused to specify what else Cheney was referring to by a &quot;dunk in the water&quot;, and refused to confirm that this meant waterboarding.

On 13 September 2007, ABC News reported that a former intelligence officer stated that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been waterboarded in the presence of a female CIA supervisor.

On 2 June 2010, while speaking to the Economic Club of Grand Rapids, Michigan, former President Bush publicly confirmed his knowledge and approval of waterboarding Mohammed, saying &quot;Yeah, we waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed...I&#x27;d do it again to save lives.&quot;

==== Obama administration ====
President Barack Obama banned the use of waterboarding and several other interrogation methods in January 2009. He reported that U.S. personnel must stick to the Army Field Manual guidelines. In early April 2009, the Obama administration released several classified Justice Department memos from the George W. Bush administration that discussed waterboarding.

Obama opposed prosecuting CIA personnel who committed waterboarding while relying on legal advice provided by their superiors. The American Civil Liberties Union has criticized his stance. In early April 2009, news reports stated that Obama would support an independent investigation over the issue as long as it would be bipartisan. On 23 April 2009, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stated that the administration had changed its position and no longer supported such an idea. The topic was the subject of heated internal debate within the White House.

National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair has stated that &quot;high value information&quot; came from waterboarding certain prisoners during the George W. Bush administration. He also commented that he could not know for sure whether or not other interrogation methods would have caused them to talk, had they been tried. In an administration memo that was publicly released, he wrote, &quot;I do not fault those who made the decisions at that time, and I will absolutely defend those who carried out the interrogations within the orders they were given.&quot;

An April poll by Rasmussen Reports found that 77 percent of voters had followed the story in the media and that 58 percent believed that releasing the memos compromised American national security. On the issue of a further investigation, 58 percent disagreed while 28% agreed.

Obama detailed his view on waterboarding and torture in a press conference on 29 April 2009.

In May 2011, Obama authorized a successful commando raid to kill Osama Bin Laden. The extent to which waterboarding assisted in ascertaining the whereabouts of Bin Laden is a matter of dispute. Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey criticized the Obama administration for denying future missions the intelligence capability that made the raid possible: &quot;Acknowledging and meeting the need for an effective and lawful interrogation program, which we once had, and freeing CIA operatives and others to administer it under congressional oversight, would be a fitting way to mark the demise of Osama bin Laden.&quot; CIA Director Leon Panetta, who supervised the operation that found and killed bin Laden, stated in an interview with NBC reporter Brian Williams: &quot;...they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of these detainees. But I&#x27;m also saying, that the debate about whether we would have gotten the same information through other approaches, I think, is always going to be an open question.&quot;

Republican Senator John McCain, in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; opinion piece, disputed Mukasey&#x27;s account, saying:
In December 2014, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence issued a declassified 500-page summary of its still-classified 6,700 page report on the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Detention and Interrogation Program. The report concluded that &quot;the CIA&#x27;s use of Enhanced Interrogation Techniques (EIT) was not effective for acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees.&quot; According to the report, the CIA had presented no credible proof that information obtained through waterboarding or the other harsh interrogation methods that the CIA employed prevented any attacks or saved any lives. There was no evidence that information obtained from the detainees through EIT was not or could not have been obtained through conventional interrogation methods. The Committee examined in detail the specific question of whether torture had elicited information helpful in locating Osama Bin Laden, concluded that it had not, and further concluded that the CIA deliberately misled political leaders and the public in claiming otherwise.
U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced on 30 August 2012 that no one would be prosecuted for the deaths of a prisoner in Afghanistan in 2002 and another in Iraq in 2003, eliminating the last possibility that any criminal charges will be brought as a result of the interrogations carried out by the CIA. The Justice Department closed its investigation of the CIA&#x27;s use of severe interrogation methods, because investigators said they could not prove any agents crossed the lines authorized by the Bush administration in the &quot;war on terror&quot; program of detention and rendition. According to &quot;the New York Times&quot; the closing of the two cases means that the Obama administration&#x27;s limited effort to scrutinize the counterterrorism programs, such as waterboarding, carried out under President George W. Bush has come to an end.

====Before and during the 2016 presidential election====
In 2015, various Republican presidential candidates indicated their willingness to bring back waterboarding as an interrogation technique. Donald Trump (the eventual winner of the election) stated he believed in the effectiveness of the technique. Trump also stated that it is a &quot;minimal&quot; form of torture, and that it was necessary. Ben Carson had not ruled out approving its use, nor did Jeb Bush. Carly Fiorina endorsed its use, as did Rick Perry and Rick Santorum.

In June 2015, in response to a critical assessment of China in the U.S. State Department&#x27;s annual human rights report, China noted that the U.S., among other alleged human rights abuses, had engaged in torture of terrorism suspects by waterboarding.

===Islamic State of Iraq and Syria===
In October 2014, John Cantlie reported that ISIS had waterboarded prisoners, &quot;Some of us who tried to escape were waterboarded by our captors, as Muslim prisoners are waterboarded by their American captors.&quot;

===China===

Waterboarding is reported to be among the forms of torture used as part of the indoctrination process at the Xinjiang internment camps.

==Effectiveness==
Waterboarding and other forms of water torture have historically been used for 1) punishing, 2) forcing confessions for use in trials, 3) eliciting false confessions for political purposes, and 4) obtaining factual intelligence for military purposes.

===For eliciting confessions===
Its use principally for obtaining confessions rather than as punishment dates back to the 15th century and the Spanish Inquisition. It was also in use for the same purpose, albeit illegally, by U.S. police officers as recently as 1981. During the Korean War, the North Koreans used several methods of torture to achieve prisoner compliance and false confessions. Such techniques caused a U.S.airmen to falsely &quot;confess&quot; that there was a plan to use biological weapons against North Korea. After 9/11, CIA interrogators sought to waterboard suspected terrorists to obtain actionable intelligence, but prisoners falsely confessed to whatever interrogators accused them of in order to stop the torture. Khalid Shaykh Muhammad fabricated stories to give his tormentors &quot;everything they wanted to hear.&quot; Later, he recanted, citing he was being tortured when he made up the stories. The same was true for the &quot;confessions&quot; forced by the torture on Riduan Isamuddin, aka Hambali.

===For obtaining actionable intelligence===

There is no evidence that waterboarding reliably produces truthful, useful intelligence. In May 2003, a senior CIA interrogator told the CIA&#x27;s Office of Inspector General that the torture then being used by the CIA was modeled after U.S. resistance training to prepare servicemen for &quot;physical torture&quot; by North Vietnamese. This torture, including waterboarding, was intended to extract &quot;confessions for propaganda purposes&quot; from U.S. airman &quot;who possessed little actionable intelligence.&quot; If the CIA wanted to obtain useful information rather than false confessions, he said, the CIA needed &quot;a different working model for interrogating terrorists.&quot; Nonetheless, with the active support of former Vice President Dick Cheney, the CIA embraced the torture approach proposed by two psychologists, James Elmer Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, neither of whom had interrogation experience. While Cheney continues to maintain that waterboarding has &quot;produced phenomenal results&quot; including tracking down Osama bin Laden, the report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded that &quot;the CIA&#x27;s use of its enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees.&quot; There was no proof, according to the 6,700-page report, that information obtained through waterboarding prevented any attacks or saved any lives, or that information obtained from the detainees was not or could not have been obtained through conventional interrogation methods.

==Legality==

===International law===

All nations that are signatory to the United Nations Convention Against Torture have agreed they are subject to the explicit prohibition on torture under any condition. This was affirmed by Saadi v. Italy in which the European Court of Human Rights, on 28 February 2008, upheld the absolute nature of the torture ban by ruling that international law permits no exceptions to it. Article 2.2 of the Convention Against Torture states that &quot;[n]o exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.&quot; Additionally, signatories of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are bound to Article 5, which states, &quot;No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&quot; Many signatories of the UN Convention Against Torture have made specific declarations and reservations regarding the interpretation of the term &quot;torture&quot; and restricted the jurisdiction of its enforcement. However, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour, stated on the subject &quot;I would have no problems with describing this practice as falling under the prohibition of torture&quot;, and that violators of the UN Convention Against Torture should be prosecuted under the principle of universal jurisdiction.

Bent Sørensen, Senior Medical Consultant to the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims and former member of the United Nations Committee Against Torture has said:

Lieutenant General Michael D. Maples, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, concurred by stating, in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, that he believes waterboarding violates Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.

In a review of &quot;The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals&quot;, by Jane Mayer, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on 11 July 2008, that &quot;Red Cross investigators concluded last year in a secret report that the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s interrogation methods for high-level Qaeda prisoners constituted torture and could make the Bush administration officials who approved them guilty of war crimes&quot;, that the techniques applied to Abu Zubaydah were &quot;categorically&quot; torture, and that Abu Zubaydah had told investigators that, contrary to what had been revealed previously, &quot;he had been waterboarded at least 10 times in a single week and as many as three times in a day&quot;.

Shortly before the end of Bush&#x27;s second term, news media in other countries were opining that under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, the U.S. is obligated to hold those responsible to account under criminal law.

On 20 January 2009, Manfred Nowak—the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment—stated that following the inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States, George W. Bush had lost his head of state immunity; Nowak opined that under international law, the U.S. was mandated to start criminal proceedings against all those involved in violations of the UN Convention Against Torture. Law professor Dietmar Herz asserted that under U.S. and international law, Bush was criminally responsible for adopting torture as interrogation tool.

===United States law and regulations===
The United States Supreme Court in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, said that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights &quot;does not of its own force impose obligations as a matter of international law.&quot; However, the United States has a historical record of regarding waterboarding as a war crime, and has prosecuted individuals for such practice in the past.

In 1947, during the Yokohama War Crimes Trials, the United States prosecuted a Japanese civilian who had served in World War II as an interpreter for the Japanese military, Yukio Asano, for &quot;Violation of the Laws and Customs of War&quot;, asserting that he &quot;did unlawfully take and convert to his own use Red Cross packages and supplies intended for&quot; prisoners, but, far worse, that he also &quot;did willfully and unlawfully mistreat and torture&quot; prisoners of war. The charges against Asano included &quot;beating using hands, fists, club; kicking; water torture; burning using cigarettes; strapping on a stretcher head downward.&quot; The specifications in the charges with regard to &quot;water torture&quot; consisted of &quot;pouring water up [the] nostrils&quot; of one prisoner, &quot;forcing water into [the] mouths and noses&quot; of two other prisoners, and &quot;forcing water into [the] nose&quot; of a fourth prisoner. Asano received a sentence of 15 years of hard labor.

Following the September 11 attacks, several memoranda, including the Bybee memo, were written analyzing the legal position and possibilities in the treatment of prisoners. The memos, known today as the &quot;torture memos&quot;, advocate enhanced interrogation techniques, while pointing out that refuting the Geneva Conventions would reduce the possibility of prosecution for war crimes. In addition, a new definition of torture was issued. Most actions that fall under the international definition do not fall within this new definition advocated by the U.S.

In its 2005 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, the U.S. Department of State formally recognized &quot;submersion of the head in water&quot; as torture in its examination of Tunisia&#x27;s poor human rights record, and draws parallels between the two techniques, citing the similar usage of water on the subject.

On 6 September 2006, the U.S. Department of Defense released a revised Army Field Manual entitled &quot;Human Intelligence Collector Operations&quot; that prohibits the use of waterboarding by U.S. military personnel. The department adopted the manual amid widespread criticism of U.S. handling of prisoners in the War on Terrorism, and prohibits other practices in addition to waterboarding. The revised manual applies only to U.S. military personnel, and as such does not apply to the practices of the CIA. Nevertheless, Steven G. Bradbury, acting head of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Legal Counsel, on 14 February 2008 testified:

In addition, both under the War Crimes Act and international law, violators of the laws of war are criminally liable under the command responsibility doctrine, and they could still be prosecuted for war crimes. Commenting on the torture memos, Scott Horton pointed out:

Michael Mukasey&#x27;s refusal to investigate and prosecute anyone that relied on these legal opinions led Jordan Paust of the University of Houston Law Center to write an article for JURIST stating:

On 22 February 2008, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse made public that &quot;the Justice Department has announced it has launched an investigation of the role of top DOJ officials and staff attorneys in authorizing and/or overseeing the use of waterboarding by U.S. intelligence agencies.&quot;

Both houses of the United States Congress approved a bill by February 2008 that would ban waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. As he promised, President Bush vetoed the legislation on 8 March. His veto applied to the authorization for the entire intelligence budget for the 2008 fiscal year, but he cited the waterboarding ban as the reason for the veto. Supporters of the bill lacked enough votes to overturn the veto.

On 22 January 2009, President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13491, which requires both U.S. military and paramilitary organizations to use the Army Field Manual as the guide on getting information from prisoners, moving away from the Bush administration tactics.

==Images of waterboarding in use==

While waterboarding has been depicted in several films and demonstrated at protest gatherings, images of its actual use are scarce. The CIA allegedly destroyed all videos it made of the procedure. The 1968 &quot;Washington Post&quot; photo of a captured North Vietnamese soldier being interrogated is arguably different because instead of being strapped to a board, the prisoner is held down by two soldiers as a third pours water from a canteen over a cloth covering face.
One eyewitness depiction of waterboarding is a painting by Vann Nath, a Cambodian artist who was held captive and tortured by the Khmer Rouge. After his release in 1979 from Tuol Sleng Prison, he began to paint pictures of the abusive practices used there, including waterboarding, to let people know about them, saying of the prisoners he heard screaming for help: &quot;I would like their souls to get something from what I paint.&quot; 
One of his waterboarding paintings depicts a sparse room with a man affixed to a board by iron bars. A cloth covers his head. Another man pours water from a watering can over his face. A similar board and watering can are on display at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum.

In 2008, the &quot;Coney Island waterboarding thrill ride&quot; went on display in Coney Island amusement park: viewers would see two models, one a captive wearing an orange uniform who was spread-eagled on a tilted table, the other one a masked interrogator. When viewers inserted a dollar the interrogator figure would pour water onto a rag over the captive figures&#x27; nose and throat, upon which the captive figure would start convulsing.

<doc id="747580" wikidata="Q7368912" url="?curid=747580" title="Rosie Ribbons">
<text>Rosemary &quot;Rosie&quot; Ribbons (born 22 July 1983) is a Welsh singer-songwriter. She achieved fame by being one of the finalists in the ITV1 talent show &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. Subsequently, she went on to have two UK top 20 hits.

== Early life ==
In the early 1980s, her English father (from north London), Ronald, visited Australia. He met and married Rosie&#x27;s mother Carol, and the family moved to Pontardawe near Swansea when Rosie was four, to be near Ronald&#x27;s parents who had moved from London to South Wales for work prior to retiring.

Ribbons reportedly wanted to be a pop singer since she was eight years old. A big fan of Mariah Carey, she learned to mimic her singing, and also started to write her own songs. She lost interest during her final school year, passing only two GCSEs, English and Drama.

==&quot;Pop Idol&quot;==
In 2001, bored with her supermarket job, Ribbons auditioned for ITV1&#x27;s talent show &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. She initially performed her own composition called &quot;Colours&quot; to judges Simon Cowell, Nicki Chapman, Neil Fox and record producer Pete Waterman. Although impressed with her vocal, Cowell suggested that she pick a more familiar song. Taking his advice, Ribbons then wowed the panel with a rendition of &quot;Hero&quot; by Mariah Carey, a performance that moved Waterman to tears.

Ribbons progressed through the competition and made the top 50. She won her heat by a landslide with a version of &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot; by Bryan Adams, receiving over half of the total votes cast for her group. At this juncture Ribbons was named amongst the favourites to win, but was voted out by viewers a few weeks before Will Young was crowned winner on 9 February 2002, ultimately finishing in 6th place.

==Telstar==
Although Ribbons did not win &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, Telstar Records signed her to a five-album deal, reportedly worth £1,000,000. After supporting Liberty X on tour, her first two singles &quot;Blink&quot; and &quot;A Little Bit&quot; (a cover of a Jessica Simpson song) were both UK top-20 hits. After the disappointing chart position of &quot;A Little Bit&quot; Telstar went to work on getting ready to release the third single only a few weeks later. Initially Telstar had chosen &quot;Good Thing&quot; before deciding on a double A Side, featuring &quot;Good Thing&quot; and &quot;Heaven&quot;. After supporting Blue on their &quot;One Love&quot; Tour Telstar decided that a totally fresh, new track had to be released something guaranteed to succeed. Rosie was back in the studio recording a modern-day remake of the Deee-Lite hit &quot;Groove is in the Heart&quot;. At one point there were discussions that the double A side would feature &quot;Naked&quot; and &quot;Groove is in the Heart&quot;. Due to Telstar&#x27;s financial problems her contract was subsequently terminated before the third single or album could be released.

Even though this million-pound deal was terminated, a promotional version of Ribbons&#x27;s debut album did surface under the title &quot;Misbehaving&quot;. The track list included her self-written Pop Idol audition song &quot;Colours&quot;, among the following:

#&quot;Good Thing&quot; (4:03)
#&quot;A Little Bit&quot; (4:02)
#&quot;Blink&quot; (3:15)
#&quot;Deadly Sin #8&quot; (3:30)
#&quot;Heaven&quot; (3:52)
#&quot;Coming Up for Air&quot; (3:45)
#&quot;Trusted&quot; (3:51)
#&quot;No Space to Rent&quot; (3:32)
#&quot;Even Angels&quot; (3:48)
#&quot;Ain&#x27;t That the Way&quot; (4:09)
#&quot;Colours&quot; (4:13)

According to the forthcoming album information on the official artwork of the &quot;Blink&quot; single, this unreleased debut was originally titled &quot;Levitate&quot;. The album would finally be released by Phoenix Music International who acquired the Telstar back catalogue in 2018

In 2005 Ribbons returned to the studio to work on a new album. Three tracks were recorded and due to appear on this album (&quot;Nothing&#x27;s Changed&quot; and &quot;If Only the World Could Smile&quot;). Clips of these recordings could be heard on her official Myspace page, however, no new album or singles were released.

==&quot;Australian Idol&quot;==
In 2007, now living in Dubbo, Australia, Ribbons auditioned for &quot;Australian Idol&quot; with another original song, &quot;Butterfly Wings&quot;. This time the judges did not ask for a second, more familiar song. She was accepted into the Top 100 and went on to make the Top 24. In the fourth semi-finals on 29 August 2007 Ribbons sang R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;. She was the last contestant to perform on the night. On 30 August 2007, Ribbons did not make the final 12, nor was she chosen to come back as a wild card, therefore she was officially eliminated from the competition.

==Recent career==
Ribbons returned to the UK after &quot;Australian Idol&quot; to perform and record new music. She released the single &quot;Turning Point&quot; featuring MOBO Award winner MC Neat in 2011.

In March 2012 Ribbons was the featured vocalist on the title track of the Alonestar EP &quot;Warrior&quot;, a release which also featured English singer-songwriter and Brit Award winner Ed Sheeran, who accompanies Ribbons on the track &quot;All Falls Down&quot; from the same EP.

<doc id="747582" wikidata="Q1736372" url="?curid=747582" title="Catholic Mariavite Church">
<text>The Catholic Mariavite Church is an independent Old Catholic denomination in Poland resulting from a schism in 1935 within the Old Catholic Mariavite Church.

==Origins==

Originally, the &quot;Mariavite movement&quot; emerged as a call for renewal within the Polish Catholic church in the Russian Partition of the one time Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania, which had been forcibly broken up by foreign powers a century earlier. After the failed Polish insurrections of 1830-31 and 1863-64, Poles&#x27; continuing political dissent and desire for independence found partial expression in the second half of the 19th-century in an assertion of their traditional religious and spiritual values which ran counter to the Russian Empire&#x27;s established Orthodox church. Despite curtailment and bans of Polish religious organisations, they proliferated both on the former Polish territory and abroad, chiefly in France, Italy and the United States, where Polish emigrants had settled and lent support. See role of Resurrectionist Congregation.

&quot;Mariavitism&quot;, from the Latin, , signified imitating the life of Mary, mother of Jesus in its simplicity. It was probably nurtured by the Capucin friar, blessed Honorat Koźmiński in a young Polish nun, Feliksa Kozłowska, who in 1893 began having a series of religious visions. These were said to have &quot;instructed&quot; her to take steps in particular to rescue Catholic clergy from the error of their ways, which members of the Polish élite tended to view as corrupt and estranged from the Gospel message. The movement rapidly gained influence among priests from educated or noble backgrounds. The new &quot;tenets&quot; emanating from the visions soon came into conflict with the church hierarchy who were hostile to their alleged provenance.
==Excommunication by Rome==
After the movement had found itself rebuffed first by the Polish church hierarchy, and subsequently, twice by the Holy See which saw no justification for the movement&#x27;s cause, Kozłowska obeyed the instructions from Rome not to contact any of the Mariavite priests and remain in her convent. However, in 1906 the newly elected Pope Pius X emphasised the church&#x27;s condemnation of the movement and its ideology by excommunicating Sister Feliksa Kozłowska and her priest lieutenant, Father Jan Maria Michał Kowalski. He had led the failed 1903–1906 attempt to incorporate the Mariavite movement in the Roman Catholic Church and to have Kozłowska&#x27;s revelations judged as worthy of belief by the church. This rendered them heretics in the eyes of the church and placed their adherents under an immediate obligation to resume their traditional Roman Catholic practice on pain of excommunication. 

Kowalski set about codifying the movement&#x27;s doctrines and beliefs with Kozłowska. Along with the priests who resisted the orders from the Vatican, he turned instead to the schismatic Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands and found a welcome among the clergy. He was invited to attend their 1909 congress in Utrecht, when he was consecrated bishop. The apostolic succession of that church validated his elevation and thereby turned the movement into a new church, which the Russian authorities quickly consented to recognise as an &quot;independent denomination.&quot; As the ailing Kozłowska&#x27;s influence waned, so the forceful Kowalski had free rein to mould the new church to his liking.

==Collision course==
However, under his leadership Mariavite adherents declined. This was due in part to the rise of Polish nationalism, in which Roman Catholicism was an intrinsic part of the Polish national identity, and the creation of a sovereign Second Polish Republic in 1918. But much of the decline could be traced to factors involving Kowalski himself – his generally autocratic style in governing the church, as Kozłowska&#x27;s successor and, innovations that he had introduced which drove him further away from the Catholic Church. These included the endorsement of consummated clerical marriages between priests and nuns, and later the ordination of women as priests and bishops. It eventually, in 1924, alienated him from the Old Catholic church as well and took the Mariavite church out of fellowship with it.

==1935 schism==

In 1935, a majority of the Old Catholic Mariavite Church clergy, many of whom had participated in his &quot;innovations&quot;, deemed him to have become a &quot;dictator&quot; and deposed Kowalski. He rejected the &quot;coup&quot; and moved out of the Płock sanctuary and installed his headquarters in the village of Felicjanów, named for the foundress. He declared his loyal following to be the &quot;Catholic Mariavite Church&quot;, despite its considerable departure from traditional doctrinal Catholic teaching. Kowalski, by then promoted to archbishop, continued to consider himself the valid leader of all genuine Mariavites. Freed from the restraining influences of much of the clergy, formerly subordinate to him, he made ever more radical pronouncements, including the view that Kozłowska had in fact been the &quot;incarnation of the Holy Spirit on earth&quot;.

In 1940, during the German occupation of Poland in World War II, Kowalski was arrested by the Gestapo and taken to the Dachau concentration camp. He died in a German Nazi extermination facility in 1942. His leadership in the church passed to his widow, Maria Izabela Wiłucka-Kowalska, who was already a consecrated bishop. She held the position until her own death in 1946.

==Present day==
The Catholic Mariavite Church continues to this day at its base in Felicjanów. It appears not to have adherents outside Poland, unlike the larger Old Catholic Mariavite Church. Never large to begin with (perhaps 3,000 members at its founding). It considers itself now a &quot;true church&quot; movement, and regards ecumenism to be mostly unnecessary, since true believers are to be found within its ranks. This insularity contributes to a general inability for the group to be penetrated by outsiders or to learn details such as its actual current size. The church is currently headed by a female bishop. The church continues to be characterised by its very liberal theology, unlike the Old Catholic Mariavite Church, which has significantly reverted to a conservative view of liturgy and theology and the traditional practice of excluding women from ordination.

<text>Giles Goat-Boy (1966) is the fourth novel by American writer John Barth. It is a metafictional comic novel in which the universe is portrayed as a university campus in an elaborate allegory of both the hero&#x27;s journey and the Cold War. Its title character is a human boy raised as a goat, who comes to believe he is the Grand Tutor, the predicted Messiah. The book was a surprise bestseller for the previously obscure Barth, and in the 1960s had a cult status. It marks Barth&#x27;s leap into American postmodern .

==Overview==
&quot;Giles Goat-Boy&quot; is one of Barth&#x27;s most complex novels, a multi-layered narrative about the spiritual development of George Giles, goat boy. The book also functions as an allegory of the Cold War. The university in which the novel takes place is divided into a secretive and authoritarian East Campus and a more open West Campus. Speaking in 2001, John Barth described the novel this way:

&quot;Giles Goat-Boy&quot; marks Barth&#x27;s emergence as a metafictional writer. The metafiction manifests itself in the &quot;Publisher&#x27;s Disclaimer&quot; and &quot;Cover-Letter to the Editors and Publisher&quot; which preface the book, and which each try to pass off the responsibility for authorship onto another: the editors implicate Barth, who claims the text was given to him by a mysterious Giles Stoker or Stoker Giles, who in turn claims it was written by the automatic computer WESCAC. In the disclaimer the &quot;editors&quot; present their opinions on whether or not to publish the book, with responses ranging from repugnance to revelation, and some disparaging both the novel and its presumed author. The &quot;author,&quot; JB, having amended the book to an unknown extent, claims it has become accidentally mixed up with a manuscript of his own. The book is further appended with a &quot;Post-Tape&quot; and then a postscript, both potentially spurious, further undermining the authority of the author.

&quot;Bookworm&quot; host Michael Silverblatt argues that in the novel, “parody and burlesque and tragedy supersede themselves, transcend themselves.” Much of the humor and many events in the book employ a number of potentially offensive representations of blacks, Jews and women, and historical events such as the Holocaust are the subjects of absurdist humor. &quot;Life Magazine&quot; described &quot;Giles Goat-Boy&quot; as &quot;a black comedy to offend everyone.&quot;

==Plot==

George Giles is a boy raised as a goat who rises in life to be Grand Tutor (spiritual leader or messiah) of New Tammany College (the United States, or the Earth, or the Universe). He strives for (and achieves) herohood, in accordance with the hero myth as theorized by Lord Raglan and Joseph Campbell. The novel abounds in mythological and Christian allegories, as well as in allusions to the Cold War, 1960s academia, religion and spirituality. Rather than &quot;discovering&quot; his true identity, George ultimately &quot;chooses&quot; it, much like Ebeneezer Cooke does in Barth&#x27;s previous novel, &quot;The Sotweed Factor&quot;.

The principle behind the allegorical renaming of key roles in the novel as roman à clef is that the Earth (or the Universe) is a university. Thus, for example, the founder of a religion or great religious leader becomes a Grand Tutor (in German &quot;Grosslehrer&quot;), and Barth renames specific leaders as well: Jesus Christ becomes Enos Enoch (meaning in Hebrew &quot;The man who walked with God&quot; or &quot;humanity when it walked with God&quot;), Moses becomes Moishe, Buddha becomes the original Sakhyan. As the founder of the maieutic method, Socrates becomes Maios; Plato (whose Greek name &quot;Platon&quot; means &quot;broad-shouldered&quot;) becomes Scapulas (from scapula, shoulder-blade); Aristotle, as the coiner of the term &quot;entelekheia&quot; (lit. &quot;having an end within,&quot; usually translated &quot;entelechy,&quot; or glossed as the actualization of a potentiality), becomes Entelechus. The heroes of epic poems tend to be named after the Greek for &quot;son of&quot;: Odysseus becomes Laertides (son of Laertes), Aeneas becomes Anchisides (son of Anchises), and so on. The subtitle &quot;The Revised New Syllabus&quot; means, in the novel&#x27;s Universe=University allegory, a parodic rewriting of the New Testament. Satan is the Dean o&#x27; Flunks, and lives in the Nether Campus (hell); John the Baptist is John the Bursar; the Sermon on the Mount becomes the Seminar-on-the-Hill; the Last Judgment becomes the Final Examination. Among the parodic variations, a computer replaces the Holy Spirit, and an artificial insemination the Immaculate Conception.

As claimed in the opening prefaces, the text is &quot;discovered&quot; by the author. A hypertext encyclopedia also figures in the book, years before the invention of hypertext and three decades before the Web became part of society at large. The character Max Spielman is a parody of Ernst Haeckel, whose insight &quot;ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny&quot; is rephrased as &quot;ontogeny recapitulates cosmogeny&quot; and &quot;proctoscopy repeats hagiography&quot;. The &quot;riddle of the universe&quot; is rephrased as &quot;the riddle of the sphincters&quot;. The novel also contains a forty-page parody in small type of the full text of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; called &quot;Taliped Decanus&quot;. The digressive play-within-a-book is grossly disproportionate to the length of the book, parodying both Sophocles and Freud.

==Background==
According to Barth, a reviewer of &quot;The Sot-Weed Factor&quot; saw in that book the pattern of the &quot;Wandering Hero Myth&quot;, as described by Lord Raglan in &quot;The Hero&quot; (1936). This observation impelled Barth to begin research into comparative mythology and anthropology, which included reading Otto Rank&#x27;s &quot;Myth of the Birth of the Ritual Hero&quot; (1909; 1914) and Joseph Campbell&#x27;s &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; (1949). This led to Barth&#x27;s invocation and playful deconstruction of the idea of the Ur-Myth in &quot;Giles Goat-Boy&quot;. Barth would delve further into the Hero in his essay &quot;Mystery and Tragedy&quot;, and in his novels &quot;LETTERS&quot; (1979) and &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; (1995).
In the 1987 preface to the novel Barth declared that his first three novels formed a &quot;loose trilogy of novels&quot;, after completing which he felt ready to move into new territory. He called &quot;Giles Goat-Boy&quot; the first of his Fabulist novels, in contrast to the 1950s-style black comedy displayed in the earlier novels. He declared in a 1965 essay, &quot;Muse, Spare Me&quot;, that he desired to be spared from social-historical responsibility in order to focus on aesthetic concerns. &quot;The Sot-Weed Factor&quot; was released in paperback the year before &quot;Giles Goat-Boy&quot;, and increased interest in his work shortly before &quot;Giles Goat-Boy&quot; was released.

&quot;Giles Goat-Boy&quot; was released the same year as a number of landmark works in the early history of postmodern American literature, most notably Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;. Brian McHale has seen 1966 as being a year in which the new postmodern aesthetic had definitively arrived, a year in which metafiction, poststructuralism and other concepts strongly related to postmodernism made their mark in the US.

Barth, himself a university professor, also set &quot;The End of the Road&quot; on a university campus.

==Reception==
&quot;Giles Goat-Boy&quot; was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list in 1966 for 12 weeks, but was coldly received in England.

The novel was initially reviewed enthusiastically, and &quot;inspired critical awe and cultish popular devotion.&quot; However, by 1984, Robert Alter referred to the book as &quot;reced[ing] into the detritus of failed experiments in American fiction&quot;, calling it &quot;little more than an inflated translation game ... so brittle a cleverness that it constantly reveals the tediousness of the novel&#x27;s informing conception.&quot; While it enjoyed a cult status in the 1960s, the novel has since become one of Barth&#x27;s least-read works. John Gardner called the book a morally &quot;empty but well-made husk.&quot; Gore Vidal called it &quot;a very bad prose-work&quot;, dismissing it as one of a number of overly academic &quot;teachers&#x27; novel[s].&quot;

In a 1967 article, science fiction author Judith Merril praised the novel for its sophistication in handling sexual material. &quot;Giles Goat-Boy&quot; is considered by many to be Barth&#x27;s best work.

Barth&#x27;s own statements on the primacy of aesthetics in his writing have tended to obscure the book&#x27;s otherwise obvious politics, particularly the 1960s Cold War allegory. Robert Scholes was among the early critics who dismissed the elaborate allegory as irrelevant, and critics since then have emphasized the role of the hero and the quest in the book&#x27;s construction. In the 1980s, Barth revisited his 1960s works and came to acknowledge their historical context, including a new preface to the 1987 edition of &quot;Giles Goat-Boy&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1967, after the success of &quot;Giles Goat-Boy&quot;, Barth was able to release a revised one-volume edition of his first two novels (&quot;The Floating Opera&quot; and &quot;The End of the Road&quot;) that restore the books&#x27; original, darker endings. 

Barth has come to see &quot;Giles Goat-Boy&quot; as &quot;the first American postmodernist novel,&quot; an assertion picked up by many of his critics and biographers, but not universally accepted. The novel was the central exhibit of Robert Scholes&#x27; &quot;The Fabulators&quot; (1967), a study of a tendency in contemporary writers to eschew realism in fiction.

<text>Salomon van Ruysdael (c. 1602, Naarden – buried 3 November 1670, Haarlem) was a Dutch Golden Age landscape painter. He was the uncle of Jacob van Ruisdael.

==Biography==
According to Arnold Houbraken, Ruysdael was the son of a woodworker who specialized in making fancy ebony frames for mirrors and paintings. His father sent his sons, Jacob and Salomon, to learn Latin and medicine, and they both became landscape painters, specializing in &quot;ruis-daal&quot;, or trickling water through a dale, after their name. Jacob was registered with the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke and signed his paintings, while Salomon signed them much less often and was not a member for several years. Houbraken wrote that Salomon invented a way of creating sculpted ornaments that when they were polished, looked like polished marble. These were quite popular as a decoration on chests and picture frames, until the secret of their manufacture was discovered and widely copied.

Houbraken confused the members of the Ruysdael family. According to the Netherlands Institute for Art History (Dutch abbreviation, RKD), Salomon was the brother of Isaack van Ruisdael, who before they moved to Haarlem, were called Gooyer or Gooier and they were sons of Jacob van Gooyer the Elder, who was a furniture and frame maker in Naarden. Both sons had sons they named after their father. Thus Salomon was the uncle, not the brother of Jacob Isaakszoon van Ruisdael, and he was the father of Jacob Salomonsz van Ruysdael. Salomon joined the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1623 (as Salomon de Gooyer), and he became a follower of Jan Porcellis and Esaias van de Velde. He travelled from Haarlem to Leiden, Utrecht, Amersfoort, Alkmaar, Rhenen, and Dordrecht, painting landscapes and stately homes. Of the four painters, Jacob Isaakszoon is the most famous today.

==Works==
Salomon was known for his landscapes and river scenes, and there are a few fish still life paintings known.

<doc id="747586" wikidata="Q675557" url="?curid=747586" title="Warren E. Hearnes">
<text>Warren Eastman Hearnes (July 24, 1923 – August 16, 2009) was an American politician who served as the 46th governor of Missouri from 1965 to 1973. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first officeholder eligible to serve two consecutive four-year terms as Governor. He previously served as the Secretary of State of Missouri from 1961 to 1965.

After leaving office Hearnes was dogged by a tax investigation, relating to finances in and out of his administration. While later cleared of any wrongdoing, Hearnes faced trouble in future bids for office. He was the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in 1976, replacing Jerry Litton who died after winning the nomination, but lost to John Danforth in November. He subsequently lost bids for Missouri Auditor in 1978, and a Circuit Court Judge position in 1980.

== Early life ==
Born in Moline, Illinois, Hearnes moved to Charleston, Missouri, as a child and resided there until his death. After high school, he attended the University of Missouri for a year and a half, until he was drafted. Soon after reporting for duty, Hearnes was appointed by President Roosevelt to the United States Military Academy at West Point, Class of 1946. He married Betty Cooper (born July 24, 1927), his childhood sweetheart, on July 2, 1948. He served in the U.S. Army and was medically discharged in 1949 after he broke his ankle in a softball game. He was a 1952 graduate of the University of Missouri School of Law.

== Political career ==
While attending law school, he was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 1950 and served until 1961. He served as majority floor leader from 1957 until leaving office.

In 1960, he ran for secretary of state of Missouri. In the primary, he defeated James Kirkpatrick, garnering 42.15% of the vote. He defeated Joseph Badgett in the general election with 56.18% of the vote.

=== Governor of Missouri ===

In 1964, Hearnes challenged the remnants of the Tom Pendergast political machine in the race for governor. During the primary he campaigned against Kansas City establishment candidate Hilary A. Bush charging, &quot;At one time all Missouri was controlled from Kansas City by a man named Pendergast. This type of machine politics should never be allowed to rear its ugly head again in Missouri politics.&quot; Among Hearnes&#x27; plans was an effort to gain support in western Missouri by the establishment of a four-year college (Missouri Western State University) in the population center of St. Joseph, Missouri despite the presence of a state college (Northwest Missouri State University) less than 50 miles away in the much smaller city of Maryville, Missouri.

Hearnes also campaigned against the Central Trust Bank of Jefferson City, Missouri (which, since its 1902 founding by Lon Stephens, had been the central depository for state funds), saying that the bank&#x27;s power was creating an atmosphere where establishment forces would &quot;select rather than elect&quot; a leader.

Hearnes won the primary over Bush with 51.9% of the vote. In the general election he won by more than 500,000 votes and 62% of the vote, defeating Republican Ethan A.H. Shepley, chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis. His lieutenant governor in the race was Thomas Eagleton. In 1965 the constitution was amended to permit governors to serve two consecutive terms.

Hearnes considered running as a favorite son candidate in the 1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries, but ultimately withdrew his candidacy. He chaired the Missouri delegation to the 1968 Democratic National Convention, which was selected by a traditional caucus of party members and overwhelmingly supported the candidacy of Hubert Humphrey. At the convention, he spoke in support of President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Vietnam policy. Despite this, Hearnes voted to pass a minority report from the convention&#x27;s Rules Committee which ultimately established the McGovern-Fraser Commission, which would substantially democratize the Democratic primaries. Historians of the primary process have disputed whether Hearnes was confused when he made his vote, or whether he had been convinced by the arguments that a more open primary process was preferable. Hearnes&#x27; vote was instrumental to the passage of the minority report, as the entire Missouri delegation followed his lead; this supplied the report with its margin of victory.

Hearnes was re-elected in 1968. He defeated Lawrence K. Roos, former St. Louis County Executive and former president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. He had 60.8% of the vote.

Hearnes&#x27; priorities as Governor included improving public education, bettering the state&#x27;s highways and traffic safety, as well as civil rights and the environment. State aid to public schools increased from $145.5 million to $389.2 million during Hearnes&#x27; term as governor, an increase of 167%, and he also increased state aid to higher education from $47.5 million to $144.7 million, an increase of 204%.

He oversaw the increase of state aid to vocational education from $856,000 to $8.8 million, fostering the establishment 53 new area vocational educational schools. While Hearnes was Governor, the State of Missouri built 350 miles of four-lane highways throughout the state. He also created the Missouri Division of Highway Safety and enacted a law providing mandatory breath tests for suspected drunken drivers. Hearnes increased uniform strength of the Missouri State Highway Patrol from 500 to 750 officers.

Hearnes was Governor during the Civil Rights era and as Governor he signed a Public Accommodations Law, Missouri&#x27;s first civil rights act. As governor he also strengthened the Fair Employment Practices Act and increased the staff of the Human Rights Commission from two employees to 35. Hearnes also enacted the state&#x27;s first air pollution law, with subsequent strengthening of its provisions. He oversaw the passage of a $150 million water pollution bond issue to provide state matching funds for sewage control construction projects, and created the state&#x27;s Clean Water Commission to enforce water pollution laws. He also was responsible for the provision of first state financial grants for mass transit and urban rapid transit facilities. He created the Department of Community Affairs to assist local governments in obtaining technical assistance and grants for city planning, zoning, housing, sewage treatment, industrial development, and other municipal and regional projects.

In 1970, he was elected chairman of the National Governor&#x27;s Association which held its annual conference at Lake of the Ozarks. In the 1972 Democratic Party presidential primaries, he supported Edmund Muskie for president and was considered a possible running mate, had Muskie won the nomination.

== Post-gubernatorial career ==
After leaving office Hearnes was plagued with tax problems which were ultimately cleared in 1977. His problems were highlighted by an exposé in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Hearnes sued the paper for defamation and the case was ultimately settled with terms undisclosed.

After facing public pressure to appoint a special counsel during the Watergate scandal, President Richard Nixon considered either Hearnes or Pat Brown for the role. Attorney General Elliot Richardson rejected both options, and ultimately appointed Archibald Cox.

Hearnes ran for United States Senate in 1976. He placed second in the primary with 26.9 percent of the vote. The winner, Jerry Litton, had 45.4%, but was killed in a plane crash en route to a primary election victory party on August 3. On August 21, the Democratic state committee selected Hearnes as the replacement nominee over Jim Spainhower by a 38 to 22 vote. Hearnes lost the general election to John Danforth who garnered 56.9% of the vote.

In 1978 he ran unsuccessfully for Missouri state auditor, losing the general election to Republican James F. Antonio, who received 50.8% of the vote. His wife, Betty Cooper Hearnes, began her own political career as a state representative in 1979, serving until 1988. She also was the 1988 Democratic nominee for governor.

In 1980, Hearnes was appointed Circuit Court Judge, making him the first person in Missouri history to serve in all three branches of the state government. However he failed to be elected to the position in the same year.

== Legacy ==
In 1972, the Hearnes Center on the University of Missouri campus in Columbia, Missouri, was named in honor of the outgoing governor.

In 2005, Warren and Betty Hearnes were awarded the Edwin P. Hubble Medal of Initiative during the Charleston Dogwood-Azalea Festival. The medal was presented by a delegation of citizens from Marshfield, Missouri. The medal is the city of Marshfield&#x27;s highest honor and is named for a native son.

In the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries Hearnes endorsed the campaign of Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination.

In 2010, a bust of Hearnes sculpted by Sabra Tull Meyer was dedicated outside the Mississippi County Courthouse in Charleston, Missouri. Later that year he was also inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians; his bronze bust is displayed in the state capitol.

In December 2016, Highway 249 near Missouri Southern State University between the I-44 and 49 interchange and East Zora became known as the Governor Warren E. Hearnes Memorial Highway.

== Death ==
Hearnes died August 16, 2009. He is buried in IOOF Cemetery in Charleston, Missouri, along with his wife who died in 2023. He is also buried with his daughter, Lynn Cooper Hearnes, who was killed in an auto accident on December 31, 2009, only a few months after the death of her father.

<text>A Kammback—also known as a Kamm tail or K-tail—is an automotive styling feature wherein the rear of the car slopes downwards before being abruptly cut off with a vertical or near-vertical surface. A Kammback reduces aerodynamic drag, thus improving efficiency and reducing fuel consumption, while maintaining a practical shape for a vehicle.

The Kammback is named after German aerodynamicist Wunibald Kamm for his work developing the design in the 1930s.

Some vehicles incorporate the kammback design based on aerodynamic principles, while some use a cut-off tail as a design or marketing feature.

== Origins ==

As the speed of cars increased during the 1920s and 1930s, designers observed and began to apply the principles of automotive aerodynamics. As aerodynamic drag increases, more energy, and thus more fuel, is required to propel the vehicle.

In 1922, Paul Jaray patented a car based on a teardrop profile (i.e. with a rounded nose and long, tapered tail) to minimize the aerodynamic drag that is created at higher speeds. The streamliner vehicles of the mid 1930s—such as the Tatra 77, Chrysler Airflow and Lincoln-Zephyr—were designed according to these discoveries.

However, the long tail was not a practical shape for a car, so automotive designers sought other solutions. In 1935, German aircraft designer Georg Hans Madelung showed alternatives to minimize drag without a long tail. In 1936, a similar theory was applied to cars after Baron Reinhard Koenig-Fachsenfeld developed a smooth roofline shape with an abrupt end at a vertical surface, effective in achieving low amounts of drag similar to a streamlined body. He worked on an aerodynamic design for a bus, and Koenig-Fachsenfeld patented the idea. Koenig-Fachsenfeld worked with Wunibald Kamm at Stuttgart University, investigating vehicle shapes to &quot;provide a good compromise between everyday utility (e.g. vehicle length and interior dimensions) and an attractive drag coefficient&quot;. In addition to aerodynamic efficiency, Kamm emphasized vehicle stability in his design, mathematically and empirically proving the effectiveness of the design.

In 1938, Kamm produced a prototype using a Kammback shape, based on a BMW 328. The Kammback, along with other aerodynamic modifications, gave the prototype a drag coefficient of 0.25.

The earliest mass-produced cars using Kammback principles were the 1949–1951 Nash Airflyte in the United States and the 1952–1955 Borgward Hansa 2400 in Europe.

== Aerodynamic theory ==
The ideal shape to minimize drag is a &quot;teardrop,&quot; a smooth airfoil-like shape, but it is not practical for road vehicles because of size constraints. However, researchers, including Kamm, found that abruptly cutting off the tail resulted in a minimal increase in drag. The reason for this is that a turbulent wake region forms behind the vertical surface at the rear of the car. This wake region mimics the effect of the tapered tail in that air in the free stream does not enter this region (avoiding boundary layer separation); therefore, smooth airflow is maintained, minimizing drag.

Kamm&#x27;s design is based on the tail being truncated at the point where the cross section area is 50% of the car&#x27;s maximum cross-section, which Kamm found represented a good compromise, as by that point the turbulence typical of flat-back vehicles had been mostly eliminated at typical speeds.

The Kammback presented a partial solution to the problem of aerodynamic lift, which was becoming severe as sports car racing speeds increased during the 1950s. The design paradigm of sloping the tail to reduce drag was carried to an extreme on cars such as the Cunningham C-5R, resulting in an airfoil effect lifting the rear of the car at speed and so running the risk of instability or loss of control. The Kammback decreased the area of the lifting surface while creating a low-pressure zone underneath the tail.

Some studies showed that the addition of a rear spoiler to a Kammback design was not beneficial because the overall drag increased with the angles that were studied.

== Usage ==


In 1959, the Kammback came into use on full-body racing cars as an anti-lift measure, and within a few years would be used on virtually all such vehicles. The design had a resurgence in the early 2000s as a method to reduce fuel consumption in hybrid electric vehicles.

Several cars have been marketed as Kammbacks despite their profiles not adhering to the aerodynamic philosophy of a true Kammback. These models include the 1971–1977 Chevrolet Vega Kammback wagon, the 1981–1982 AMC Eagle Kammback, the AMC AMX-GT, and the Pontiac Firebird–based &quot;Type K&quot; concept cars.

Some models that are marketed as &quot;coupes&quot;—such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz SUVs like the X6 and GLC Coupé—&quot;use a sort-of Kammback shape, though their tail ends have a few more lumps and bumps than a proper Kammback ought to have.&quot;

<doc id="747600" wikidata="Q16980374" url="?curid=747600" title="Honolulu City Council">
<text>Honolulu City Council is the legislature of the City and County of Honolulu, the capital and largest city in Hawai&#x27;i, the fiftieth state in the United States. The City and County of Honolulu is a municipal corporation that manages government aspects traditionally exercised by both municipalities and counties in other states. Each of the nine members of its city council is elected to a four-year term and can serve no more than two consecutive terms. Council members are elected by voters in nine administrative districts that, since 1991, are reapportioned every ten years. Like the Honolulu mayor, members of the city council are elected via nonpartisan elections. 

Enacted in 1973, the City and County Charter establishes the council&#x27;s legislative power and responsibility for Honolulu County, including its budget, public safety, zoning and municipal development, and other governmental affairs. 

== History ==

Honolulu&#x27;s first legislative body was the Board of Supervisors of Oʻahu County, established by the Legislature of the Territory of Hawaiʻi via the County Act of 1905. The mayor-council system of municipal government was created when the consolidated city-county of Honolulu was established in the city charter adopted by the 1907 territorial legislature. Unlike the current nine-member city council, the original board included seven elected at-large supervisors led by the Mayor of Honolulu. 

The board of supervisors was renamed the Honolulu City Council in 1955. In 1959, the same year in which Hawaiʻi became a U.S. state, the city and county adopted a new charter that reapportioned three seats of the council from at-large to specific rural districts. Changes to the charter in 1973 required all council districts to elect its council members, and set rules for electing the council president and filling vacancies. 

A 1992 charter amendment limited council members to no more than two consecutive terms, and required council seats to be nonpartisan. It also established the rule of &quot;decennial reapportionment,&quot; which requires the council to appoint a commission to review and reapportion council districts every ten years.

Another charter amendment, adopted in 1998, staggered council member terms, with four of the nine members elected in one election, and the remaining five in the next. Beginning in 2002, an appointed city auditor became responsible for city government accountability. 

== Composition ==

The city council has nine members, each of whom was elected by one of nine council districts that represent the City and County of Honolulu and encompass the entire Island of Oahu. The 2020 reapportionment established the current council districts. 

== Elections ==

The State of Hawaiʻi Office of Elections holds elections of council members during the state&#x27;s general election period. Members are elected in nonpartisan primary elections held in August. If no candidate wins a majority of the primary vote, the top two face off in November. Every council member must be a qualified elector in the council district from which they are elected or appointed. 

== Removal ==

A member will be removed from office if they move from their district during their term or are impeached via a recall petition signed by a minimum of 10 percent of the registered voters in their district. 
== Leadership ==

Members of the City Council elect a chair and vice-chair. The chair serves as speaker, presides over council meetings, and, with the council&#x27;s approval, performs ministerial functions such as appointing members of the Charter Commission. The council vice-chair serves as presiding officer only when the chair is absent or otherwise cannot serve. 

== Legislative power ==

The Constitution of the State of Hawaiʻi gives each county the power to “frame and adopt a charter for its own self-government.” The consolidated City and County of Honolulu spans the entire Island of Oahu. Its city council exercises the legislative power of the county government. The county charter grants some executive power to the council: setting real property tax rates; setting, controlling, and auditing the county budget, and; establishing county agencies and commissions. Although it lacks the power to directly amend the charter, the council selects six of the 13-member Charter Commission, the agency that conducts the mandatory review of the city charter for each ten-year period. 

Both the Honolulu mayor and city council members may introduce a &quot;Bill for an Ordinance&quot; for inclusion into the Revised Ordinances of Honolulu, the set of laws governing the county. By law, voters have a limited initiative power to propose bills unrelated to the repeal of taxes, appropriation of money, and other financial activities.

=== Legislative process ===

The city council presents a bill during the first reading, and refers it to the appropriate committees for review. Upon approval by the assigned committees, the bill is returned to the council for a second reading. After the second reading, the bill is published in a newspaper; thereafter, a public hearing on the bill is held. Following public comment, the council sends the bill back to the committees for further revision, and, following their approval, sets the bill for its third and final reading. A bill that passes third reading is sent to the Honolulu mayor. The mayor must either approve or veto the bill, which becomes law only after the mayor approves it.

=== Investigation and audit powers ===

The city council has the power to investigate the operations of city agencies and any subjects over which the council exercises legislative control. Given its setting of the city&#x27;s budget and oversight of its financial activities, the council can order audits of county departments and agencies. 

=== Appointment powers ===

The council appoints the city clerk, auditor, and the director of council services. With the mayor&#x27;s consent, it can also create and appoint officers of semi-autonomous agencies. The city currently oversees two semi-autonomous agencies: the Honolulu Board of Water Supply (BWS) and Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (HART). 

== Agencies and committees ==

As the legislative branch of the City and County of Honolulu, the city council supervises three offices, two semi-autonomous agencies, and eight committees. 

=== Offices ===
* City Clerk&#x27;s Office
* Office of Council Services
* Office of the City Auditor

=== Semi-autonomous agencies ===
* The Board of Water Supply 
* Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (HART)

=== Committees ===

<text>José Francisco Ruiz Massieu (July 22, 1946 – September 28, 1994) was a Mexican political figure. He was governor of Guerrero from 1987 to 1993. He then served as the general secretary of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 1994. His term ended with his assassination.

José Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the brother-in-law of then-President of Mexico Carlos Salinas, was due to become the PRI majority leader in the Chamber of Deputies. That changed on the morning of September 28, 1994, when he was murdered by a gunman, 28-year-old Daniel Aguilar Treviño, just outside Hotel Casa Blanca, located at Lafragua street crossing Paseo de la Reforma, an avenue in the center of Mexico City. The incident occurred while Ruiz Massieu was boarding his vehicle after attending a PRI party meeting held at Casa Blanca.

==Death==
His murder happened just six months after the murder of PRI party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, who was gunned down on March 23, 1994, in Tijuana. Two days after the murder, on September 30, 1994, PRI deputy Fernando Rodríguez González was arrested in Zacatecas and confessed to authorities that he himself hired hitman Aguilar Treviño and his cousin to commit the murder. Daniel Aguilar Treviño confessed to authorities that he was paid US$500,000 () by Rodríguez González himself to commit the crime. 

===Aftermath===
When Rodríguez González was interrogated, he then revealed that PRI Deputy Manuel Muñoz Rocha was involved in the planning of the murder. Muñoz Rocha, who disappeared just days after the murder, made a phone call to a Mexico City television station saying that he was willing to come forward and give his side of the story to PGR authorities if his request for protection was met. Such request was approved by government officials, but, by then, Muñoz Rocha was never to be seen or heard of again. Two weeks later, the assistant attorney general investigating the case, , the brother of the assassinated politician, resigned because of irregularities from PRI officials in the case. He claimed he had proof of PRI party president Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza and party secretary María de los Ángeles Moreno hiding evidence and thus blocking the investigation. Pichardo Pagaza and Moreno requested for proof to be shown, but it was never found.

In October 2017, a judge in Mexico City decided to reduce Aguilar Treviño’s sentence from the original 50 years down to 42, now set to be released in 2036.

Jorge Rodríguez Gónzalez who was originally sentenced to 50 years for his involvement in the murder had his sentence reduced down to 37 years (now set to be released in 2041). Then in 2018, a federal judge granted Rodríguez Gónzalez parole. However, Rodríguez Gónzalez was later denied the parole after failing to pay the needed bail amount.

===Salinas de Gortari family involvement allegations===
On February 28, 1995, Raúl Salinas, the brother of former President Carlos Salinas, was arrested at his Mexico City home and was considered the mastermind of the Ruiz Massieu assassination. Three days later, Mario Ruiz Massieu was arrested in Newark, United States, boarding a plane to Madrid while carrying US$46,000 () in unreported cash. The government charged him with obstructing the investigation of his brother&#x27;s murder. The government also found US$17 million ($ million in ) in U.S. bank accounts linked to Mario Ruiz Massieu. He was not found deportable. Mario Ruiz Massieu committed suicide in 1999.

Raúl Salinas was found guilty on January 21, 1999. 
On appeal, his sentence was cut to 27 years. In June 2005, the conviction was overturned and Raúl Salinas freed.

<text>Freelancer is a space trading and combat simulation video game developed by Digital Anvil and published by Microsoft Game Studios. It is a chronological sequel to Digital Anvil&#x27;s &quot;Starlancer&quot;, a combat flight simulator released in 2000. The game was initially announced by Chris Roberts in 1999, and following many production schedule mishaps and a buyout of Digital Anvil by Microsoft, it was eventually released in March 2003.

In the game, players take on the roles of spacecraft pilots. These characters fly single-seater ships, exploring the planets and space stations of 48 known star systems. They also engage in dogfights with other pilots (player- and computer-controlled) to protect traders or engage in piracy themselves. Other player activities include bounty-hunting, commodity trading, and resource mining. The single-player mode puts the player in the role of Edison Trent, who goes through a series of missions to save the Sirius sector from a mysterious alien force. In multiplayer mode, players are free to take on any role and to explore anywhere from the start.

==Gameplay==

Players take up the roles of pilots who fly single-seat spacecraft, trading with merchants on space stations and planets, and engaging in combat against other vessels. Starting with a small spacecraft in a star system, the player&#x27;s character explores the region, opening up new systems for further adventures. Each system provides opportunities to increase the pilot&#x27;s wealth; aside from taking on jobs to ferry goods and hunting for bounties, the player character can engage in trade. The player character&#x27;s primary goal in the game is to accumulate money, so as to buy more advanced weaponry and equipment to upgrade his ship.
The game is played primarily through &quot;pointing and clicking&quot; with the mouse and a few keyboard commands. This system is also used to control the spacecraft, a breakaway from the traditional use of joysticks for space flight simulators. Observing their spacecraft from the rear, players fly their ships by moving the mouse in the direction they want the vessels to go. &quot;Freelancer&quot;″s spacecraft follow simplistic flight dynamics; however, a dash of realism is implemented by allowing the vessels to cut power to their engines and turn to face any direction while drifting along their original path—conservation of momentum. Clicking the mouse button shoots the ship&#x27;s weapons at the location of the cursor. The interface has no radar display; the location of objects not shown on the screen are indicated by pointers at the screen&#x27;s edges. Targeting, communications, and navigation data are displayed in information boxes that can be minimized.

After the pilot docks with a space station or lands on a planet, the screen and its interface change to a rendition of the area he is visiting. The player moves the pilot to different locations and interacts with certain objects, such as reading a bulletin board and talking to other characters, by clicking on their graphical representations. &quot;Freelancer&quot;″s economy consists of buying and selling spacecraft, their armaments and components, and commodities. Certain goods are considered contraband in some systems, and they have to be smuggled past police patrols to their buyers. Computer-controlled characters (non-player characters or NPCs) in certain locations on the planets or stations offer quests and jobs.

&quot;Freelancer&quot; features a multiplayer mode, allowing up to 128 players to play together in a game. Multiplayer games are hosted on game servers; personal computers that meet the requirements for the game can act as a server. Gameplay is similar to the single-player mode, but is absent of story-driven quests. The server keeps individual records of the players&#x27; progress, and they can resume their game on their next log on to this server. A persistent virtual galaxy is thus maintained for them.

==Plot and setting==
The events in &quot;Freelancer&quot; take place 800 years after those in the video game &quot;Starlancer&quot; (2000). The Solar System was engulfed in a civil war, fought between the Western Alliance and the Eastern Coalition. Facing defeat, the Alliance placed its people in stasis and sent them to the Sirius system, where they settled and transformed the surrounding space (the Sirius sector) into a region of political intrigue and opportunity. The rule of the sector is mostly split among four houses, each named after the sleeper ship that brought them to the system. Each house exhibits the culture of its terrestrial ancestor: Liberty of 1920s United States, Bretonia of Victorian era United Kingdom, Kusari of Shogunate era Japan, and Rheinland of Second Industrial Revolution Germany. The fifth sleeper ship, &quot;Hispania&quot;, suffered a malfunction en route and was abandoned in deep space (in the Omicron Alpha system). The descendants of its crew became pirates.

&quot;Freelancer&quot;″s planetary bodies and space stations lie close to a single plane in each system, although some are above or below this plane and ships can travel out of the plane. There are 48 known star systems, and spacecraft can travel from one system to another by passing through jump gates. Within a system, spacecraft can travel in the trade lanes—a series of gates that connect to form a &quot;space highway&quot;—to quickly reach places of interest, such as planets, space stations, and mining operations. Asteroid and debris fields populate some of the systems, and secret hideouts and derelicts with valuable items exist in deep space. Merchant ships ply the trade lanes, carrying cargo from system to system and occasionally coming under attack by pirates. Police and Militaries generally patrol the areas, while larger warships can be found near some hubs.

===Characters===
The player takes on the role of Edison Trent, a &quot;mercenary freebooter&quot;, in single-player mode. Regardless of Trent&#x27;s background, the player can play him in different roles, such as being a trader, pirate, or bounty hunter. Throughout the story, Trent meets several NPCs, such as Liberty Security Force (LSF) commander Jun&#x27;ko Zane, xenoarchaeologist Professor Roland Quintaine, and head of a secret organization, Casper Orillion. Trent&#x27;s relationships with these NPCs are pre-determined and illustrated by cutscenes; the player has no choice of import in Trent&#x27;s interactions with these NPCs.

Most NPCs are aligned with a certain faction, such as the police, pirates, a company, or government. Each faction has its own agenda, and the relationships among them are interlinked in a web of alliances and hostilities. Player characters anger a faction and its allies by destroying its ships. Likewise, they gain the favor of a faction—and, to a smaller extent, its allies—by attacking its enemies. Player characters who have a bad relationship with a faction are attacked on sight by its forces and denied from docking with its stations. Paying bribes to a faction improves its attitude to the player character. Several NPCs with major roles are voiced by professional voice actors, such as Ian Ziering (&quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;), Jennifer Hale (&quot;Metroid&quot; games), George Takei (&quot;Star Trek&quot;), and John Rhys-Davies (&quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films and &quot;Sliders&quot;). These NPCs are excluded from the multiplayer mode because of its lack of a campaign story (scripted missions).

===Story===
The plot of &quot;Freelancer&quot;″s single-player campaign is illustrated with two hours worth of in-game cutscenes. The story is linear in structure—the player is unable to effect a different storyline—and broken down into stages. Cutscenes inform players of background events and the goals in a stage. Most stages have no time limits for their completion, and players can put the main story on hold while taking on missions (jobs) not crucial to it. However, players can only proceed to other regions of the Sirius sector, where more advanced ships, weaponry, and equipment are obtained, after completing missions that advance the story. Some stages are not introduced until the character has achieved a certain level (based on total worth accumulated), and it is not possible to gain sufficient levels just through the story itself, so players must spend at least some time on side missions to gain money to advance to the level required for the next stage of the story. This is also necessary as some stages would be too tough with only the money and items collected in the story.

On starting single-player mode, a cutscene shows the destruction of space station Freeport 7 by unknown forces, leaving Trent without money or ship on the planet Manhattan. While waiting for his debtor, Lonnigan, to regain consciousness, Trent takes up employment with the LSF under Jun&#x27;ko Zane, who provides him with a small ship. Lonnigan refuses to pay Trent when he awakes and is mysteriously taken away by the LSF. His death is later announced, and Trent is contacted by a thief who reveals that a mystery party destroyed Freeport 7 to get an artifact in the thief&#x27;s possession. An LSF officer kills the thief, but the officer is shot by Zane in self-defense as she arrives at the scene. Zane and Trent are forced to flee Liberty space, traveling across approximately half of the &quot;Freelancer&quot; world in their flight. Trent locates xenoarcheology expert Dr. Quintaine to learn more about the artifact. While finding additional materials for their research, they discover the existence of the Nomad alien race, who are the caretakers of an empire that belonged to the previous inhabitants of the Sirius sector, the Dom&#x27;Kavosh. The Nomads can possess humans and have slowly infiltrated the four Houses in this manner, planning to ignite a civil war to weaken the humans for elimination.

Trent joins the Order, a secret organization formed to combat the Nomads, and helps to rescue the Liberty president from the aliens. Quintaine&#x27;s research reveals the artifact to be a map and the key to the Dom&#x27;Kavosh&#x27;s hyper gate—super jump gate—network, which currently acts as the Nomads&#x27; source of power. The Order launches an attack on what they believe to be the Nomads&#x27; homeworld, aiming to activate the hyper gates and cut off the Nomads from their power supply. The activated gates suck the Nomads to an unknown location, and the Order watches over the gates for their return. With the Nomads&#x27; defeat, events return to normal in the &quot;Freelancer&quot; world. Trent and Zane are granted full pardons by the governments, and Trent is asked by the Order to be their eyes and ears in Liberty space, allowing the player to continue the game without any story elements.

==Development==

In 1997, Chris Roberts began work on a vision he had since he first conceived &quot;Wing Commander&quot;. He wanted to realize a virtual galaxy, whose systems execute their own programs regardless of the players&#x27; presence; cities would be bustling with transports and each world&#x27;s weather changes on its own time. Commodity prices in each star system would fluctuate, according to the activities of the computer controlled traders, who import and export goods. Roberts envisioned thousands of players simultaneously interacting with and influencing this world through a unique and intuitive user interface never seen before in other games. Each player could pursue a quest set up for their character, and join other players to attempt other missions together without needing to exit the game and start a new mode of play. Artificial intelligence would fly the players&#x27; spacecraft, letting them concentrate on combat or other tasks. Roberts intended the cutscenes and gameplay visuals to be of equal quality so players would be unable to distinguish between the two. By the end of 1997, it was officially announced that &quot;Freelancer&quot; was in the early stages of a two-and-a-half-year development schedule.

Two years later, the project was displayed at GameStock, an annual showcase to the mass media of Microsoft&#x27;s games. The media covered the event, focusing on the features promised for this game. There were concerns about the state of the graphics and uncertainties over the promise of a dynamic economy, but gaming site GameSpot gave Roberts and his company, Digital Anvil, the benefit of their doubts. Initially in 1999, Roberts announced the game would be available on the market by fall 2000. However, the project suffered delays and by Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2000, Roberts said the earliest release for the game was at the end of 2001.

In June 2000, Microsoft started talks to buy Digital Anvil. Roberts admitted that his team required large sums of money, which only a huge company could provide, to continue developing &quot;Freelancer&quot; with its &quot;wildly ambitious&quot; features and unpredictable schedule; the project had overshot its original development projection of three years by 18 months. Roberts hoped that Microsoft would not compromise his vision for &quot;Freelancer&quot;, and was convinced the software giant would not attempt the takeover if it did not believe &quot;Freelancer&quot; could sell at least 500,000 copies when released. Roberts left the company on completion of the deal, but assumed a creative consultant role on &quot;Freelancer&quot; until its release. Microsoft instructed Digital Anvil to scale down the ambitions of the project and focus on finishing the game based on what was possible and the team&#x27;s strengths. Features such as the automated flight control, conversations that had different choices of responses, and sub-quests were abandoned. Despite the reductions, several reviewers believed the resultant product was still true to Roberts&#x27; vision.

The &quot;Freelancer&quot; team kept a low profile throughout 2001 before displaying a demo of their latest work at International Games Festival 2002, drawing large crowds. Microsoft announced the project was on schedule, and Digital Anvil added all the planned content for the game by October 2002. A beta test with approximately 500 testers was conducted, and the only main activities left were to refine the game&#x27;s features and to fix errors uncovered in the testing. The game shipped to retailers in North America on March 4, 2003, Australia on March 11, and in the United Kingdom on April 11. and was later available online through Yahoo&#x27;s Game on Demand service. Digital Anvil&#x27;s role on &quot;Freelancer&quot; ended on June 6, 2003, with their delivery of a software patch to resolve issues on the server and cheating; the staff were redeployed to other departments in Microsoft. In accordance with their five-year support policy for software, Microsoft stopped supporting the game on April 8, 2008, and shut down their global server, which managed the list of multiplayer servers and the connection of players to them.

&quot;Freelancer&quot;″s soundtrack was released by Sumthing Else Music Works on November 18, 2003. Composed by award-winning composer James Hannigan, music group Visual Music Incorporated, and Digital Anvil&#x27;s musician and programmer Andrew Sega, it includes a bonus DVD that contains the game&#x27;s alternative introduction movies, concept art, scripts, and deleted content. Communities of &quot;Freelancer&quot; players banded together to produce modified versions of the game. Their software modifications included new ships—including big capital ships—for players to fly and new factions for them to join. Certain modifications allowed the players to fly ships of one franchise against another, for example, &quot;Star Wars&quot; versus &quot;Wing Commander&quot;. The communities also worked around the loss of the global server, allowing players to host the modified games on their servers and continuing the Freelancer multiple-player online gaming world.
==Reception==
===Sales===
In the United Kingdom, &quot;Freelancer&quot; sold roughly 20,000 units during the first half of 2003. Kristan Reed of GamesIndustry.biz wrote that these were &quot;not figures that spell H.I.T.&quot;

===Reviews and awards===

Chris Roberts is highly regarded in the field of spaceflight combat simulators due to his successful &quot;Wing Commander&quot; franchise. When the industry learned that he was creating a new spaceflight combat simulator, they paid close attention to it. In its first public showing at E3 1999, Roberts&#x27; &quot;Freelancer&quot; won four Game Critics Awards, including Best Game of the Show. Journalists at one of the game&#x27;s later showings queued up to 90 minutes to catch a glimpse of a half-hour demonstration. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, trusting Roberts&#x27; vision, named &quot;Freelancer&quot; as a game that would revolutionize the gaming industry. Shortly after the game was released, IGN called it the Game of the Month. Early in the game&#x27;s development, the industry was enthusiastic about the prospect of playing in a world that changes without player interaction (a dynamic world), although there was caution over the possibility of such implementation with contemporary technology. Delays in the schedule and Microsoft&#x27;s take over of Digital Anvil gave rise to speculation that Roberts&#x27; most promised feature—the dynamic world—would be cut.

The concerns were partially realized; the features, although not cut, were reduced, leaving &quot;Freelancer&quot; with a virtual world that did not live up to the industry&#x27;s expectations. It presented a static galaxy, where territories of various factions never change despite the groups&#x27; frequent raids and attacks on each other, and commodity prices remain fixed. Nonetheless, reviewers from video game sites, such as Eurogamer and GameSpy, accepted the limitations and focused on other areas of the game. They found the lack of variety a greater detraction from the game than the compromised dynamic world. Excluding the single-player campaign, players never meet any memorable NPC because almost everyone sounds American. According to Game Nation TV, after playing for a while, every character and place looked similar to the extent that the game makes &quot;&quot;Star Trek&quot; look like a xenomorphic zoo&quot;. Furthermore, instead of serving as entertainment, the missions, which entail the pilot to fly to a particular location and destroy the enemies there, are so repetitive that they become chores to the reviewers instead.
&quot;Freelancer&quot;″s graphics software was of older technology, but it did not detract from FiringSquad&#x27;s praise of the game&#x27;s artistic quality. The beautiful and realistic depictions of the universe impressed other reviewers, such as GameCritics.com and the Stratos Group. IGN, in particular, was enamored with the game&#x27;s graphics, describing them as &quot;simply gorgeous&quot; with the best explosions and enormous ships. The mouse-and-keyboard flight control was praised by the industry. Several reviewers found it easy to shoot down enemy ships with the intuitive controls, but others pointed out that aerobatic maneuvers, such as jinking or barrel rolls, cannot be performed, reducing dogfights to overly simplistic and repetitive &quot;chase or be chased&quot; sequences that pale in comparison to the action in other spaceflight simulators.

On the story side, reviewers agreed the professional actors, such as Ian Ziering, did a good job in bringing their respective characters to life. However, criticism was placed on the lone voice who voiced all the generic male encounters for his monotonous delivery and making all his characters sound alike. The long cutscenes, which cannot be skipped, frustrated game journalist Tom Chick; he wanted to skip the scenes and continue playing instead of being forced to watch a clichéd story. Other reviewers expressed their own frustrations with the story, such as being forced to move to another star system at undesired times, or leaving them without an objective after the campaign abruptly ended.

FiringSquad said &quot;Freelancer&quot;″s multiplayer mode encapsulated the &quot;best and worst of [the game] in a nutshell&quot;: although players can move their characters anywhere, group with others for missions, and trade ships and equipment, they have very little else to do in the unchanging virtual galaxy. Despite these limitations, Stratos Group said the joy of playing with real-life counterparts is a positive factor; the NPC pilots are so inept that human-controlled pilots outperform them most of the time. However, as the missions are practically the same, IGN and GameCritics.com questioned the point of playing them repeatedly with friends. Furthermore, IGN thought it was meaningless to amass wealth and higher-grade equipment when they cannot be transferred to other servers. The lack of substance and repetitiveness led the gaming site to wonder how long &quot;Freelancer&quot; can be viable as a commercial multiplayer product. Whereas massively multiplayer online games such as &quot;EverQuest&quot; have thousands of players in a vast playing area, &quot;Freelancer&quot; can accommodate only up to 128; the loneliness of playing in such a sparsely populated virtual world gave UGO concern as well over the longevity of &quot;Freelancer&quot;″s multiplayer mode.

Overall, reviewers acknowledged &quot;Freelancer&quot; fell short of the promises initially made by Roberts; however, it demonstrated a high quality of work in its implemented features. The various concepts were well meshed together to form an entertaining product. It never broke or raised the bar of its genre, but boasted a high production value, and has been said to be well worth the money. The game, however, was an anti-climax for those who were hooked by the touted and promised initial concepts, many of which were never realized. &quot;Freelancer&quot; was a &quot;hugely ambitious game&quot;, as admitted by Chris Roberts, for a company to develop without the necessary capital and resources.

The editors of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; nominated &quot;Freelancer&quot; for their 2003 &quot;Shooter of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Call of Duty&quot;. They wrote, &quot;&quot;Freelancer&quot; dazzled us with its immersive interstellar world, wild combat, and ambitiously open-ended design, but it can&#x27;t compete with the cinematic spectacle of Europe at war.&quot;

==Sequel==
There were reports that Digital Anvil and Microsoft Game Studios worked on a Freelancer sequel called &quot;Project Lonestar&quot; for the Xbox 360 until Digital Anvil dissolved in 2006.

<doc id="747629" wikidata="Q5315163" url="?curid=747629" title="Dungeonland">
<text>Dungeonland (EX1) is a 1983 adventure module for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) roleplaying game, written by Gary Gygax for use with the First Edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;) rules. It is an adaptation of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s 1865 novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, with the various characters from the book translated into &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; terms.
The &quot;EX&quot; module code stands for &quot;extension&quot;, as the adventure is designed to be inserted as an independent addition to another, ongoing scenario. In Gygax&#x27;s own campaign, an early version of &quot;Dungeonland&quot; was an extension of Castle Greyhawk. In this module, the player characters (PCs) are plummeted into what &quot;White Dwarf&quot; reviewer Jim Bambra referred to as &quot;a strange partial plane&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The adventure begins with PCs falling down an earthen tunnel. It is suggested that the portal to Dungeonland be a barrel within the dungeon of Castle Greyhawk, but the Dungeon Master (DM) may work in any premise to get them to this stage.

Upon landing, the player characters (PCs) find themselves in a surreal, oddly-shaped hallway which contains The Pool of Tears and the entrance to a diminutive garden. Once they have explored these areas, they cross a fungi forest and arrive at The Wilds of Dungeonland, which is essentially a wooded area containing several connected clearings.

Over the course of the adventure, the PCs run into variations of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Wonderland&quot; creatures and characters, presented in a &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; style. For instance, instead of the Mock Turtle, a Mock Dragon Turtle is present. The March Hare is a lycanthrope, and so on.

The story loosely follows the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; novel, with all of the characters converted into hostile monsters with treasure. The PCs may leave Dungeonland when they choose, by returning to the Great Hall and wishing themselves back up the tunnel. The PCs may also explore The Land of the Magic Mirror, which adjoins Dungeonland to the West, if they are able to find the way.

==Publication history==
&quot;Dungeonland&quot; was inspired by &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, and &quot;includes a very dangerous Mad Hatter and March Hare, a deadly game of croquet with the Queen, and a Mock (Dragon) Turtle&quot;. Like its source material, the module is intended to be played in a &quot;light-hearted and zany spirit&quot;, though, unlike Carroll&#x27;s Alice, the player characters repeatedly face potentially lethal combat with monsters. The Cheshire Cat, for example, is a magical smilodon eager to eat adventurers.

&quot;Dungeonland&quot; was written by Gary Gygax, with illustrations by Tim Truman, and was published by TSR in 1983 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder. &quot;Dungeonland&quot; and &quot;The Land Beyond the Magic Mirror&quot; were designed to allow the DM to place them as an extension of any existing dungeon intended for 9th–12th level characters. In the afterword, Gygax mentions that &quot;Dungeonland&quot; was an early part of the Greyhawk dungeon, and that his players visited it multiple times. Dr. Joyce Brothers is mentioned as having played in a version of the scenario run at a convention.

The module is paired with &quot;The Land Beyond the Magic Mirror&quot;, which is based on Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;. The scene on the cover of each module is from an event in the other module.

==Reception==
Doug Cowie reviewed &quot;Dungeonland&quot; favorably for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine. He noted that the module is designed to be inserted into any existing dungeon or dungeon level. Cowie praised the &quot;excellent underlying theme&quot; and the &quot;whimsical&quot;, but on occasion &quot;very black humour&quot;. He also felt that this was a &quot;good example of how module design is developing&quot;, namely &quot;interesting and technically sound, whilst displaying more and more conceptual originality&quot;. Cowie thought that the designer had done a &quot;splendid job&quot;.

The module was positively reviewed in issue No. 48 of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine by Jim Bambra, who scored it 9 out of 10 overall. He reviewed the module along with &quot;The Land Beyond the Magic Mirror&quot;, and enjoyed the &quot;rich vein of humour&quot; that runs through the two modules, both of which &quot;offer players an exciting and humorous time&quot;. He felt that while the modules could be played individually, they work best when played together as they frequently interconnect, and player characters adventuring in one module could suddenly find themselves in the other. Bambra felt that although the modules were humorous in tone, some encounters could turn extremely dangerous, and that making them for high level characters makes them inaccessible for lower level characters. However, he concluded by saying that if players do have higher level characters available then &quot;by all means play them, you won&#x27;t regret it.&quot;

In his 1991 book &quot;Heroic Worlds&quot;, Lawrence Schick said that the scenario was &quot;inspired by &quot;Alice and Wonderland&quot;, but with the whimsy replaced by opportunities for slaughter&quot;.

<doc id="747635" wikidata="Q2837839" url="?curid=747635" title="Allegheny Airlines">
<text>Allegheny Airlines was a local service carrier that operated out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from 1952 to 1979, with routes primarily located in the eastern U.S. It was the forerunner of USAir that was subsequently renamed US Airways, which itself merged with American Airlines. Its headquarters were at Washington National Airport in Arlington County, Virginia.

==History==
Allegheny Airlines began as All American Aviation Company providing mail delivery starting on March 7, 1939. It was founded by du Pont family brothers Richard C. du Pont and Alexis Felix du Pont Jr.

===Allegheny before 1979===


In 1949, the company was renamed All American Airways as it switched from air mail to passenger service. On 1 January 1953 it was again renamed, to Allegheny Airlines. Like other local service airlines, Allegheny was subsidized; in 1962 its revenue of $23.5 million included $6.5 million in &quot;public service revenue&quot;.

In 1953, Allegheny&#x27;s network blanketed Pennsylvania, reaching from Newark, New Jersey, to Cleveland, Ohio, and Huntington, West Virginia. It added Detroit (YIP) in 1956, Boston in April 1960, La Guardia in 1964, Norfolk in 1966, Toronto in 1967, and Louisville-Nashville-Memphis in 1968. The Lake Central Airlines merger in July 1968 added Chicago and St Louis, and the Mohawk Airlines merger in April 1972 added Montreal, Minneapolis, and many New York cities. Houston in 1978, then Florida at the end of 1978 (TPA-MCO-PBI) and Phoenix in 1979.

In 1959, Allegheny debuted its first turbine airliner, a Convair 540, a Convair 340 with the piston engines replaced by Napier Elands. When Rolls-Royce bought Napier it dropped the Eland, so 540s in the United States reverted to piston; Allegheny&#x27;s last 540 flights were in 1962. The airline bought new Fairchild F-27Js that the company named &quot;Vistaliner&quot;. The F-27J was a U.S.-built version of the Fokker F27. The airline switched to General Motors/Allison turboprops in the Convair 580 which the carrier named the &quot;Vistacruiser&quot;; the first CV580 flight was in June 1965. The last DC-3 flights were in 1962 and the last piston flights were in 1967.

In 1960, Allegheny headquarters were in Washington, D.C.

In 1965, Allegheny announced it would add the first jet aircraft type to its fleet—the Douglas DC-9-10—which the airline stated would be placed into service in 1966. Allegheny then added other jets, notably the McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30, which the company named the &quot;Vistajet&quot;. Later jets included Boeing 727-100s and 727-200s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-50s. The Mohawk merger added British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jets to the fleet as well. Allegheny Airlines was also the first airline with a network of affiliated regional airlines, the Allegheny Commuter system, which began with Henson Airlines in 1967.

As deregulation dawned, Allegheny, looking to shed its regional image, changed its name to USAir on October 28, 1979.

===USAir and US Airways===
After Allegheny Airlines rebranded itself as USAir, the company retained its earlier name for its Allegheny Commuter service until 1989 when it became USAir Express.

Under USAir, which eventually renamed itself US Airways, the Allegheny name continued to be used by the parent company, keeping the trademark under US Airways&#x27; control. Suburban Airlines was originally headquartered at the Reading Airport in Reading, Pennsylvania, and flew a large fleet of Short 330s and Short 360s, being the launch customer for the Short 360. It had three Fokker F27s, and was the last US operator of passenger F27s. After replacing much of its Short fleet with de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8s and retiring the F27s, Suburban merged with another wholly owned USAir subsidiary, Pennsylvania Airlines, which was headquartered at Harrisburg International Airport near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The combined airline retained the historic Allegheny Airlines name until it was merged with another wholly owned subsidiary, Piedmont Airlines. The subsequent airline retained the Piedmont Airlines name. After retiring earlier aircraft, Allegheny, before and after its mergers, mainly flew De Havilland Canada Dash 8s to 35 airports in the northeastern United States, and eventually Canada, from hubs at Boston and Philadelphia. Its activities and Activities Dash 8 fleet were incorporated into a regional airline, Piedmont Airlines, in 2004.

, an American Airlines Airbus A321, registered N579UW, is painted in Allegheny colors. It recently was on an Airbus A319 registered N745VJ, before being repainted into standard American livery in March 2023 and US Airways also operated this aircraft with a retro Allegheny Airlines paint scheme.

* On November 14, 1955, an Allegheny Airlines Martin 2-0-2 was undertaking training flights at Wilmington Airport in New Castle County, Delaware, when the No. 1 engine caught fire during a single engine approach. On landing, the left main landing gear collapsed, and the aircraft was withdrawn from service and used for spare parts.
* On December 1, 1959, Allegheny Airlines Flight 371, a Martin 2-0-2, crashed into a mountain on approach to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States. There were 25 fatalities.
* On October 19, 1962, an Allegheny Airlines flight attendant, Françoise de Moriere, fell to her death after being blown out a Convair 440 emergency exit door on a flight from Washington, D.C., to Providence, Rhode Island, during a scheduled descent into Hartford, Connecticut. This incident inspired James Dickey&#x27;s poem &quot;Falling&quot;.
* On November 2, 1963, an Allegheny Airlines Martin 2-0-2 was damaged beyond repair under unknown circumstances while taxiing at Newark International Airport.
* On July 23, 1965, Allegheny Airlines Flight 604 crashed northeast of the Williamsport Regional Airport due to a right engine failure and subsequent failure to follow engine out procedures by the flight crew. None of the 40 occupants on board were killed, but 23 were injured.
* On November 29, 1966, Allegheny Airlines Flight 305, operated by a Convair 440, suffered a complete electrical failure on takeoff from Capital City Airport in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The pilots attempted to abort the takeoff, but the reversers did not work, and the aircraft overran the runway, striking an approach light tower. The cause of the failure was later determined to be an improperly installed heater.
* On December 24, 1968, Allegheny Airlines Flight 736, a Convair 580, crashed on approach to Bradford, Pennsylvania, killing 20 of the 47 people on board.
* On January 6, 1969, Allegheny Airlines Flight 737, a Convair 580, also crashed on approach to Bradford, Pennsylvania, killing 11 of the 28 people on board.
* On September 9, 1969, Allegheny Airlines Flight 853, a DC-9 en route from Cincinnati to Indianapolis, collided with a small private plane and crashed into a soybean field southeast of Indianapolis, near Shelbyville, Indiana, killing all 83 people aboard both aircraft.
* On June 7, 1971, Allegheny Airlines Flight 485, a Convair 580, en route from Washington, D.C., to New Haven, Connecticut (via New London, Connecticut) crashed short of the runway at New Haven. 26 passengers and two crew members were killed; two passengers and one crew member survived. Pilot error was the cause of the crash.
* On June 23, 1976, Allegheny Airlines Flight 121, a DC-9, crashed on the runway due to windshear at Philadelphia International Airport. There were 86 injuries and no fatalities.
* On July 9, 1978, Allegheny Airlines Flight 453 crash-landed at Greater Rochester International Airport while arriving from Boston Logan International Airport. The BAC-111 aircraft was carrying 77 people, and there was one serious injury.
* On February 12, 1979, Allegheny Airlines Flight 561, a Nord 262 bound for Washington-National Airport crashed shortly after takeoff from North Central West Virginia Airport because of snow on the aircraft&#x27;s wing and empennage surfaces. Two died out of the 25 passengers and crew on board.

<text>Carl David Tolmé Runge (; 30 August 1856 – 3 January 1927) was a German mathematician, physicist, and spectroscopist.

He was co-developer and co-eponym of the Runge–Kutta method (), in the field of what is today known as numerical analysis.

==Life and work==
Runge spent the first few years of his life in Havana, where his father Julius Runge was the Danish consul. His mother was Fanny Schwartz Tolmé. The family later moved to Bremen, where his father died early (in 1864).

In 1880, he received his Ph.D. in mathematics at Berlin, where he studied under Karl Weierstrass. In 1886, he became a professor at the Technische Hochschule Hannover in Hanover, Germany.

His interests included mathematics, spectroscopy, geodesy, and astrophysics. In addition to pure mathematics, he did experimental work studying spectral lines of various elements (together with Heinrich Kayser), and was very interested in the application of this work to astronomical spectroscopy.

In 1904, on the initiative of Felix Klein he received a call to the University of Göttingen, which he accepted. There he remained until his retirement in 1925.

===Family===
His daughter Iris also became a mathematician and his son Wilhelm was an early developer of radar. Another of his daughters, Nerina (Nina), married the mathematician Richard Courant.

==Honors==
The crater Runge on the Moon is named after him.
The Schumann–Runge bands of molecular oxygen are named after him and Victor Schumann.

<doc id="747639" wikidata="Q423523" url="?curid=747639" title="ʻOkina">
<text>The okina () is the letter that transcribes the glottal stop consonant in Hawaiian. It does not have distinct uppercase and lowercase forms, and is represented electronically by the modifier letter turned comma: .

A phonemic glottal stop exists in many other Polynesian languages as well; these are usually written by a similar apostrophe-like letter.
&#x27;

==Names==
Following are the names of the glottal stop consonant in various Polynesian languages, and notes on how they are represented in text.

== Appearance ==
In many fonts, the symbol for the ʻokina looks identical to the symbol for the curved single opening quotation mark. In others (like Linux Libertine) it is a slightly different size, either larger or smaller, as seen in the adjacent image.

In this phrase there is one ʻokina before the &quot;Ō&quot; and another one before the last &quot;i&quot;. These are slightly smaller than the quotation marks in the first line and slightly larger in the second.

== Case ==
The okina is treated as a separate letter in the Hawaiian alphabet. It is unicameral—that is, it does not have separate uppercase (capital or majuscule) and lowercase (small or minuscule) forms—unlike the other letters, all of which are basic Latin letters. For words that begin with an okina, capitalization rules affect the next letter instead: for instance, at the beginning of a sentence, the name of the letter is written &quot;Okina&quot;, with a capital O.

== Geographic names in the United States ==
The United States Board on Geographic Names lists relevant place names both with and without the okina and kahakō (macron) in the Geographic Names Information System. Colloquially and formally, the forms have long been used interchangeably.

== Computer encoding ==
=== Apostrophes and quotation marks ===

In the ASCII character set, the okina is typically represented by the apostrophe character (&#x27;), ASCII value 39 in decimal and 27 in hexadecimal. This character is typically rendered as a straight typewriter apostrophe, lacking the curve of the okina proper. In some fonts, the ASCII apostrophe is rendered as a right single quotation mark, which is an even less satisfactory glyph for the okina—essentially a 180° rotation of the correct shape.

Many other character sets expanded on the overloaded ASCII apostrophe, providing distinct characters for the left and right single quotation marks. The left single quotation mark has been used as an acceptable approximation to the okina, though it still has problems: the okina is a letter, not a punctuation mark, which may cause incorrect behaviour in automated text processing. Additionally, the left single quotation mark is represented in some typefaces by a mirrored &quot;9&quot; glyph, rather than a &quot;6&quot;, which is unsuitable for the okina.

=== Unicode ===

In the Unicode standard, the okina is encoded as  (). It can be rendered in HTML by the entity codice_1 (or in hexadecimal form codice_2).

Although this letter was introduced in Unicode 1.1 (1993), lack of support for this character prevented easy and universal use for many years. , OS X, Microsoft Windows and Linux-based computers and all new major smartphones have no problem with the glyph, and it is no longer a problem in Internet Explorer 7 as it was in previous versions. U+02BB should be the value used in encoding new data when the expected use of the data permits.

===Ukraine===
In 1991 Ukraine had 5,500 Lenin monuments.

Before Ukraine&#x27;s Euromaidan, Lenin monuments and other Soviet-era monuments were already being removed. However, in 2008, the 139th anniversary of Lenin, two new Lenin monuments were erected in Luhansk Oblast (now occupied by Russia).

Following the 2014 Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine, more than 500 statues of Lenin were dismantled between February 2014 and April 2015, after which nearly 1,700 remained standing. On May 15, 2015, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed a bill into law that set a six-month deadline for the removal of the country&#x27;s communist monuments. By December 2015, 1,300 Lenin monuments were still standing (in Ukraine).

In April 2015, a formal decommunization process started in Ukraine after laws were approved which, among other acts, outlawed communist symbols.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, many of these statues of Lenin, which had been taken down by Ukrainian activists, were re-erected by occupying Russian forces and Ukrainian collaborators in Russian-controlled areas.

<text>John Daniel Runkle (October 11, 1822 – July 8, 1902) was an American educator and mathematician. He served as acting president of MIT from 1868 to 1870 and president between 1870 and 1878.

==Biography==
Professor Runkle was born at Root, New York State. He worked on his father&#x27;s farm until he was of age, and then studied and taught until he entered the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University, where he graduated in 1851. His ability as a mathematician led in 1849 to his appointment as assistant in the preparation of the &quot;American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac&quot;, in which he continued to engage until 1884. He was professor of mathematics in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1865 until his retirement in 1902. Runkle become aware of the work of Victor Della-Vos&#x27;s work in Russia at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition in 1876, he was impressed by the combination of theoretical and practical learning. Manual training was introduced into the institute curriculum largely at his instance. He founded the &quot;Mathematical Monthly&quot; in 1859 and continued its publication until 1861, and he had charge of the astronomical department of the &quot;Illustrated Pilgrim&#x27;s Almanac&quot;.

In the town of Brookline, Massachusetts, Runkle was a chairman of the School Committee and an early advocate of mathematics and technical education. He received an LL.D from Wesleyan University, in Middletown, Connecticut

==Works==
* &quot;New Tables for Determining the Values of Coefficients in the Perturbative Function of Planetary Motion&quot; (Washington, 1856)
* &quot;The Manual Element in Education&quot; (1882), reprinted from the &quot;Reports&quot; of the Massachusetts Board of Education
* &quot;Report on Industrial Education&quot; (1883)
* &quot;Elements of Plane and Solid Analytic Geometry&quot; (Boston, 1888)

==Memorials==
John D. Runkle School, an elementary school located at 50 Druce Street in Brookline, was established in his name in 1897.

==Family==
His brother, Cornelius A. Runkle (9 December 1832 in Montgomery County, New York–19 March 1888 in New York City) graduated from Harvard Law School in 1855, and began practice in New York City. He was subsequently made deputy collector and given charge of the law division of the New York Custom House. This rendered him familiar with the legal questions involved in tariff and internal revenue litigation, and resulted in his devoting himself largely to that class of business. For about twenty-five years, he acted as counsel for the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; association. Cornelius&#x27;s wife, Lucia Isabella Gilbert Runkle (born in North Brookfield, Massachusetts on August 20, 1844), was an editorial writer and contributor to the &quot;Tribune&quot;.

<text>Hardin Richard Runnels (August 30, 1820 – December 25, 1873) was an American politician. He served as the sixth Governor of Texas for one term but notably was the only person to ever defeat Sam Houston in a political contest.

== Early life ==
Runnels was born to Hardin D. and Martha &quot;Patsy&quot; Burch (Darden) Runnels on August 30, 1820 in Mississippi. His father died in 1842, and his mother moved the family to Texas the same year. There Runnels established a cotton plantation in Bowie County along the Red River.

Elected to represent Bowie County in the Texas House of Representatives in 1847, Runnels remained a member of the state legislature through 1854. During his final session, he was speaker of the Texas House. Runnels was elected Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 1855, serving in this capacity during Governor Elisha M. Pease&#x27;s second term. During his time in the legislature and as Lieutenant Governor, he gained a reputation as a loyal member of the Democratic Party and an advocate for states&#x27; rights.

When the Democratic Party held its first convention in Texas in May 1857, Runnels attended as a delegate. Sam Houston had upset many voters with his pro-Union position, association with the Know Nothings during 1855, and his vote against the Kansas–Nebraska Act. As a result, party leaders blocked Houston&#x27;s nomination for governor, and Runnels was selected instead. Houston, sensing he was unlikely to be reappointed to the U.S. Senate, announced he was running for governor as an independent on May 12, 1857. While states&#x27; rights were the primary issue, the resulting campaign quickly became a contest of personalities. Voter anger over Houston&#x27;s recent political positions continued until election day, and Runnels became the only person to defeat Houston in an election by a vote of 38,552 to 23,628.

== Governor of Texas ==
During Runnels&#x27; administration, primary concerns were the slavery issue and safety of settlers in the western frontier. On the slavery issue he signed a bill into law allowing a free Negro to return to slavery by selecting a new master. In addition, he supported reopening the slave trade (banned at the time) and attempted to force the state legislature to go on record supporting its reestablishment. In more general support of southern issues, Runnels repeatedly stated Texas might secede if needed.

On the issue of frontier security, the governor commissioned Colonel John &quot;Rip&quot; Ford as senior captain of the Texas Rangers on January 27, 1858. Ford led the Antelope Hills expedition into the Comancheria, winning the Battle of Antelope Hills in May. Later in the year, the Rangers fought an inconclusive battle in the Rio Grande Valley against Mexican bandit Juan Cortina. Despite these efforts, the Rangers failed to secure peace on the frontier.

Runnels advocated for reductions in the level of support the state provided railroad companies, arguing that the railroads had been slow in fulfilling their contractual obligations.

The Democratic party renominated Runnels for governor during the election of 1859, with Houston again running against him. Runnels, however, received most of the blame for continuing frontier depredations, while Houston had regained his popularity. As a result, Runnels was defeated by Houston by a vote of 33,375 to 27,500.

== Later life ==
After leaving office, Runnels returned to his home and never again ran for elected office. He remained active in politics, serving as a member of both the 1861 Secession Convention and the 1866 Constitutional convention. Runnels died on December 25, 1873, and was buried in a family plot in Bowie County. His remains were re-interred in a state cemetery in Austin in 1929.

Runnels was a slaveholder. In 1860, his net worth was reported at $85,000, and he owned 39 slaves.

<doc id="747654" wikidata="Q1744036" url="?curid=747654" title="Transesophageal echocardiogram">
<text>A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE; also spelled transoesophageal echocardiogram; TOE in British English) is an alternative way to perform an echocardiogram. A specialized probe containing an ultrasound transducer at its tip is passed into the patient&#x27;s esophagus. This allows image and Doppler evaluation which can be recorded. It is commonly used during cardiac surgery and is an excellent modality for assessing the aorta, although there are some limitations.

It has several advantages and some disadvantages compared with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).

==Details==
TEE is a semi-invasive procedure in that the probe must enter the body but does not require surgical (i.e., invasive) cutting for this procedure.
Before inserting the probe, mild to moderate sedation is induced in the patient to ease the discomfort and to decrease the gag reflex.
Usually a local anesthetic spray (e.g., lidocaine, benzocaine, xylocaine) is used for the back of the throat or as a jelly/lubricant anesthetic for the esophagus.
Sedation and anesthesia are required to make the procedure tolerable and safer, as biting the probe, coughing, vomiting, and patient movement would drastically reduce the value of the procedure.

Mild or moderate sedation can be induced with medications such as midazolam (a benzodiazepine with sedating, amnesiac qualities), fentanyl (an opioid), or propofol (a sedative/general anesthetic, depending on dosage).
Children are anesthetized. Adults are sometimes anesthetized as well if moderate sedation is unsuccessful.

Due to the procedure being invasive, sonographers do not perform this procedure unlike transthoracic echo.

Once adequate sedation and anesthesia are achieved, the probe is passed through the mouth and into the esophagus.
From here, the protocol used for the procedure is highly variable.
As the study could be terminated any second (e.g., respiratory compromise, hypotension, intolerance to the probe) the structures of particular interest could be visualized first. For example, if the TEE is ordered to look for
mitral regurgitation then the mitral valve may be fully inspected first. At the completion of the study, the probe is removed and patient is monitored for recovery from sedation.

===Advantages===
The advantage of TEE over TTE is usually clearer images, especially of structures that are difficult to view transthoracically (through the chest wall).
This difficulty with TTE is exemplified with obesity and COPD, as both of these can drastically limit both the window available and the quality of the images obtained through those windows
This reduces the attenuation (weakening) of the ultrasound signal, generating a stronger return signal, ultimately enhancing image and Doppler quality.
Comparatively, transthoracic ultrasound must first traverse skin, fat, ribs and lungs before reflecting off the heart and back to the probe before an image can be created.
All these structures, along with the increased distance the beam must travel, weaken the ultrasound signal thus degrading the image and Doppler quality.

In adults, several structures can be evaluated and imaged better with the TEE, including the aorta, pulmonary artery, valves of the heart, both atria, atrial septum, left atrial appendage, and coronary arteries.
TEE has a very high sensitivity for locating a blood clot inside the left atrium.

TEE is also frequently used concurrently with cardiac surgery to provide immediate visualization, inspection, and monitoring of the patient throughout the procedure. Its intraoperative utility includes real-time hemodynamic monitoring by the cardiac anesthesiologist, evaluation of relevant cardiac pathologies before and after surgical repair, and immediate assessment of the success of surgical interventions after cardiopulmonary bypass. TEE can also evaluate for unintended complications from surgery, for example unintended injury to cardiac valves, the aorta, or other structures during the procedure.

===Disadvantages===
TEE has several disadvantages, although they should be weighed against its significant benefits. The patient must follow the ASA NPO guidelines (usually not eat anything for eight hours and not drink anything for two hours prior to the procedure). Rather than one sonographer, a TEE needs a team of medical personnel of at least one nurse to monitor/administer sedation and a physician to perform the procedure (a third physician/sonographer can be used to push buttons on the ultrasound machine). It takes longer to perform a TEE than a TTE. It may be uncomfortable for the patient, who may require general anesthesia at the extreme to perform a TEE safely. Due to being an invasive procedure often involving sedation, it is more technically difficult to perform and requires experience to do it well while maintaining safety.

TEE is limited to available anatomy. For example, if the patient has esophageal varices, esophageal stricture, Barrett&#x27;s esophagus, or other esophageal or stomach problems then this can increase the risk of a TEE significantly.
Performing an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) beforehand may be necessary to visualize the anatomy for safety, which exposes the patient to a second procedure.
The anatomy may result in prohibitive risk.

With transthoracic echo, numerous measurements are taken to aid in diagnosis and grading of diseases.
These normal ranges are not as well defined for TEE and so there is less accepted standards (e.g., left atrial enlargement).

Some risks are associated with the procedure, such as esophageal perforation around 1 in 10,000, and adverse reactions to the medication.

Specialty medicine professional organizations recommend against using transesophageal echocardiography to detect cardiac sources of embolization after a patient&#x27;s health care provider has identified a source of embolization and if that person would not change a patient&#x27;s management as a result of getting more information. Such organizations further recommend that doctors and patients should avoid seeking transesophageal echocardiography only for the sake of protocol-driven testing and to agree to the test only if it is right for the individual patient.

==Clinical uses==
In addition to use by cardiologists in outpatient and inpatient settings, TEE can be performed by a cardiac anesthesiologist to evaluate, diagnose, and treat patients in the perioperative period. Most commonly used during open heart procedures, if the patient&#x27;s status warrants it, TEE can be used in the setting of any operation.
TEE is very useful during many cardiac surgical procedures (e.g., mitral valve repair). It is actually an essential monitoring tool during this procedure. It helps to detect and quantify the disease preoperatively as well as to assess the results of surgery immediately after the procedure. If the repair is found to be inadequate, showing significant residual regurgitation, the surgeon can decide whether to go back to cardiopulmonary bypass to try to correct the defect.
Aortic dissections are another important condition where TEE is very helpful.
TEE can also help the surgeon during the insertion of a catheter for retrograde cardioplegia.

==Probes==
TEE probes are similar in style to those used for esophagogastroduodenoscopy except the probe contains an ultrasound crystal rather than a visual camera.
The ultrasound crystal images radially to the probe rather than axially (along the probe length) as the heart is not inline with the esophagus, but rather adjacent (anterior) to it.

===Angle===
Most TEE probes contain a two-dimensional ultrasound crystal.
This permits rotation of the 2-D echo plane without physical movement of the probe.
This is often referred to the &quot;angle&quot; and varies between 0° and 180° (flipped image of 0°).
For any given position of the probe in the body, different angles permit viewing structures more optimally.

The angle can be adjusted with buttons or a dial, and this varies with the specific probe and ultrasound machine.

===Movement===
The probes often have one or two degrees of freedom:
* Flexion or retroflexion can point the crystal superiorly or inferiorly, respectively
* Left and right flexion tilts the probe left and right

These two degrees are typically adjusted using dials on the handle of the probe.
A third degree is axial rotation of the probe (clockwise or counter-clockwise) and is present regardless of the other two degrees of freedom.
A fourth degree is the translation of the probe long its axis to permit passing through the mouth, into the esophagus, and into the stomach.

The combination of these four degrees of freedom permit 2-D, color, and Doppler echo of practically every structure in the heart.

==Positions==
Transthoracic echo is far more commonly used than TEE and transthoracic echo is limited to by the available windows through the chest wall to visualize the heart.
TEE does not have such discrete locations and can visualize the heart anywhere along the esophagus to the stomach.
With that said, there are commonly accepted positions along this path that are used when performing a standard TEE.

===Midesophageal===
The midesophageal view is positioned posterior from the left atrium and at 0° this provides for a long-axis four chamber view.

At 0°, the long-axis four chamber view can be obtained with slight retroflexion of the probe. However, slight rotation and insertion may be needed to better visualize the right heart and tricuspid valve.

At 45°, the short-axis view of the aortic valve can be obtained.
At this angle, a short-axis view of the right ventricle can be seen to visualize the right atrium, tricuspid valve, right ventricle, and pulmonary valve in a single view.

At 90°, the probe can be rotated clockwise to obtain the &quot;bicaval view&quot; in which the right atrial and both the inferior and superior vena cava can be viewed.

At 135°, the long-axis view of the aortic valve can be obtained.

The left atrial appendage, with proper probe positioning, can be visualized at all angles and often visualized at 0*, 45°, 90°, and 135° to adequately rule out a thrombus.

===Transgastric===
Pushing the TEE probe past the gastroesophageal junction into the stomach and flexing the probe (pointing it toward the superior) yields a short-axis view of the heart.

At 0°, the short-axis of the left ventricle can be obtained to see wall motion in the basal, mid, and distal sections.

If the probe is rotated clockwise, then the right heart and tricuspid valve can be visualized.

It is in the transgastric position that is best used to quantify the aortic valve with pulse- and continuous-wave Doppler as this is the best view to be best coaxial with the valve.

===Upper esophagus===
Pulling back of the TEE probe higher into the esophagus reveals the aortic arch. Typically, in the midesophageal view the probe is rotated until the descending aorta is visualized. Pulling back the probe permits visualization of the aorta and any atheromatous plaques within the aorta. Short axis visualization at 0° allows for descending aorta size measurements. Further pulling back will eventually reach the aorta arch and clockwise rotation will bring the arch into view. Continuous visualization of the aorta to the arch level can visualize coarctation of the aorta.

==History==
The transesophageal echocardiogram was first invented by Dr. Leon Frazin in 1974 while working at the Loyola University Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, and Veterans Administration Hospital, Hines, Illinois. His early findings were published in 1976 in Circulation 

==Diseases==
While TEE can be used to answer many questions that a transthoracic echo can answer, the TEE is used for some diseases in particular.
* Infective endocarditis to get better quality images of the affected valve and better plan surgery, or need for surgery
* Aortic root abscess, which generally is not visible on transthoracic echo
* Eccentric mitral regurgitation can be better appreciated on TEE due to Coandă effect
* Left atrial appendage thrombus and evaluation, follow up, and insertion of a left atrial appendage occlusion device
* Evaluation for patent foramen ovale and atrial septal defect after a stroke, and insertion of a PFO/ASD plug
* Monitoring during a procedure to cross the interatrial septum safely without poking the needle through an undesired structure
* During cardiothoracic surgery for numerous procedures including immediately before and after replacement of a valve

<doc id="747665" wikidata="Q250731" url="?curid=747665" title="Prince Álmos">
<text>Álmos (also &quot;Almus&quot;, Slovak, ; 1070  or 1075 – 1 September 1127) was a Hungarian prince, the son of King Géza I of Hungary and brother of King Coloman. He held several governmental posts in the Kingdom of Hungary.

==Life==

===Early life===
Álmos was the younger of the two sons surviving infancy of the future King Géza I. His mother seems to have been his father&#x27;s first wife, Sophia, because Géza&#x27;s Byzantine second wifewhose baptismal name is unknownreturned to her homeland after her husband&#x27;s death. Both Álmos and his older brother, Coloman, were born around 1070, according to the historians Gyula Kristó and Márta Font.

Géza I who ascended the throne in 1074 died on 25 April 1077. He was succeeded by his brother, Ladislaus I, because Coloman and Álmos were still minors. The new king decided that Coloman should be prepared for a career in the Church. The king&#x27;s decision was unusual, as Coloman was older than Álmos.

Between 1084 and 1091 Álmos was the duke of Slavonia; between 1091 and 1095 he was named duke of Croatia. According to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot; both Coloman and Álmos accompanied their uncle on a military campaign against Bohemia in the spring of 1095. Before reaching the border of his kingdom, Ladislaus I &quot;was overcome by a grave infirmity&quot; and decided to appoint Álmos as his heir. However, Coloman did not agree with his uncle&#x27;s decision, deciding to flee to Poland.

===Conflicts with Coloman===
Coloman returned after King Ladislaus had died to claim his rights. According to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, it was his uncle who had invited him back from Poland. The same source adds that Álmos &quot;in the true simplicity of his heart honoured his brother, Coloman, and yielded to him the crown of the kingdom&quot;, which suggests that Coloman ascended the throne without bloodshed. On the other hand, he was only crowned king in early 1096, implying that the two brothers had been fighting for the crown before they reached an agreement. Coloman was crowned in Székesfehérvár by Archbishop Seraphin of Esztergom. According to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, at the same time he &quot;granted the dukedom with full rights&quot; to Álmos. This report shows that Álmos only acknowledged his brother&#x27;s rule in exchange for receiving the one-time &quot;ducatus&quot; or duchy of their father and grandfather, which encompassed one-third of the kingdom.

After Coloman&#x27;s victories over the marauding crusaders in 1096, Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, whom Ladislaus I had supported against Pope Urban II in his last years, wrote a letter to Duke Álmos. He stated that Coloman had &quot;neglected&quot; his &quot;interests because of his own necessities&quot; and asked Álmos to intervene on his behalf at Coloman. However, the kinga former bishopdid not continue his predecessor&#x27;s foreign policy and joined the pope&#x27;s camp. Historian Gyula Kristó writes that the fact that his brother, Álmos had for years had a close relationship with Emperor Henry may also have influenced Coloman&#x27;s decision.

Coloman invaded Croatia and participated himself in the campaign in 1097. Taking advantage of Coloman&#x27;s absence, Álmos began to conspire against the king and mustered his armies. Coloman returned from Croatia and marched towards his brother&#x27;s duchy with his troops in 1098. The two armies encountered at Tiszavárkony, only the river Tisza separated them. However, the commanders of the two troops started negotiations and decided not to fight against each other, compelling Coloman and Álmos to make a peace.

====Final confrontation====

The conflict was renewed a few years later between the two brothers, when Coloman had his four-year-old son, Stephen, crowned in 1105, which resulted in the open rebellion of Álmos. The duke left Hungary and sought the assistance of Emperor Henry IV against the king. However, he realized that the emperor, who was facing a rebellion of his own son, could not help him. Álmos returned to Hungary in 1106, but soon fled to his brother-in-law, Boleslaw III of Poland. With Polish assistance, he took the fortress of Abaújvár in Hungary. As a result, Coloman had a meeting with Boleslaw III and the two monarchs &quot;vowed perpetual friendship and brotherhood&quot;. Without the Polish monarch&#x27;s support Álmos was forced to yield to Coloman.

King Coloman decided to take advantage of the absence of Álmoswho had made a pilgrimage to the Holy Landand seized his duchy in 1107 or 1108. Although Álmos was allowed to keep his own private property, the annexation of his duchy ensured the integrity of Coloman&#x27;s kingdom. Having returned from the Holy Land, Álmos decided to set up a monastery at Dömös. On the occasion of its consecration, where Coloman was also present, Álmos wasfalsely, according to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;accused of an assassination attempt on the monarch. Coloman decided to have his brother arrested, but &quot;the most reverend bishops and other well-disposed dignitaries&quot; intervened on Álmos&#x27;s behalf and &quot;thus reconciliation was solemnly sworn&quot; between the king and his brother.

Álmos left for Passau. Upon his request, Henry V of Germany invaded Hungary and laid siege to Pressburg (Bratislava, Slovakia) in September 1108. At the same time, Duke Svatopluk of Bohemia, who also supported Álmos, made an incursion into the regions north of the Danube. However, Coloman&#x27;s ally, Boleslaw III invaded Bohemia, forcing the Czech duke to withdraw. Although the emperor&#x27;s attempt to take Pressburg was also a total failure, he could persuade Coloman to forgive his rebellious brother, who thus return to Hungary.

Coloman discovered that Álmos was again conspiring to seize the throne. Having lost his patience, Coloman had Álmos and Álmos&#x27;s young son, Béla, blinded in order to secure a peaceful succession for his own son. On the same occasion, many of his brother&#x27;s partisans were likewise mutilated. After this Álmos went on to live in seclusion at the monastery of Dömös. Coloman died in 1116. His son, Stephen was crowned king in Székesfehérvár in the month of his father&#x27;s death. His peaceful succession proves that the safety measures Coloman had implemented to prevent Álmos from aspiring the throne were effective. 

===Exile===
According to the &quot;Illuminated Chronicle&quot;, the blind Álmos, &quot;fearing death at the hands of King Stephen&quot;, fled to the Byzantine Empire. Many of his partisans followed him and Emperor John II Komnenos settled them in a town in Macedonia. There, Álmos received a new name from the Emperor, Constantine. The Byzantine John Kinnamos confirms that the emperor &quot;regarded&quot; Álmos &quot;favorably and received him with kindness&quot;. He adds that king Stephen II &quot;sent his envoys to the emperor and demanded that&quot; Álmos &quot;be expelled from&quot; the Byzantine Empire, but his request was rejected. The sources do not specify the date of Álmos&#x27;s flee, but it seems to have occurred in about 1125. Historian Ferenc Makk writes that Álmos was forced to flee from Hungary, because he had taken advantage of Stephen&#x27;s failures in Volhynia and Dalmatia and conspired against Stephen. His departure resulted a war between the two realms, lasting from 1127 to 1129. Álmos died in exile on 1 September 1127.

His son Béla the Blind would succeed as king of Hungary in 1131. The duke&#x27;s remains were returned to Hungary in 1137.

==Family==

On August 21, 1104, Álmos married Predslava of Kiev, and had the following children:
*Adelaide, ( 1107 – 1140), married Sobieslav I of Bohemia in 1123
*Béla II, King of Hungary (r. 1131–1141). In 1129, he married Helena of Raška (Rascia) and together they had at least six children.
*Hedwig, or Sophia (1107–1138), married Duke Adalbert of Austria in 1132

<text>Electronic Attack Squadron 129 (VAQ-129) is the United States Navy&#x27;s only EA-18G Growler training squadron. Known as the &quot;Vikings&quot;, they are a Fleet Replacement Squadron, or FRS, and are charged with training all EA-18G aviators and developing standard operating procedures for the maintenance and operation of the aircraft. The squadron is permanently stationed at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, in Puget Sound, Washington.

==Operational history==


===VAH-10===
Heavy Attack Squadron 10 (VAH-10) was established on 1 May 1961 and originally equipped with the A-3 Skywarrior.

During the Vietnam War detachments from VAH-10 were deployed on the following aircraft carriers operating on Yankee and Dixie Stations:
*14 April-14 December 1964, Detachment A-3Bs were embarked on 
*5 May 1964 – 1 February 1965, A-3Bs were embarked on 
*21 June 1966 – 21 February 1967, Detachment 42 A-3Bs were embarked on 
*6 June-15 September 1967, Detachment 59 KA-3Bs were embarked on 
*10 April-16 December 1968, Detachment 66 KA-3Bs were embarked on 
*7 September 1968 – 18 April 1969, Detachment 43 KA-3Bs were embarked on 
*26 October 1968 – 17 May 1969, Detachment 61 KA-3Bs were embarked on 
*2 August 1969 – 15 April 1970, Detachment 19 KA-3Bs were embarked on 
*5 March-17 December 1970, Detachment 38 KA-3Bs were embarked on 
*22 October 1970 – 3 June 1971, Detachment 62 KA-3Bs were embarked on USS &quot;Hancock&quot;

===VAQ-129===

VAH-10 was re-designated Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron One Two Nine (TACELECWARON129) (VAQ-129) flying the EA-6B Prowlers on 1 September 1970. The change in name brought with it a change in mission. The first EA-6B standard version Prowler was delivered in January 1971. With its arrival, VAQ-129 commenced its career as the Fleet Replacement Squadron for EA-6B fleet commands.

In January 1977, the Navy introduced the first of its Improved Capability (ICAP) version Prowlers. In March 1977, VAQ-129 began training United States Marine Corps aircrew and maintenance personnel to fly and maintain the ICAP version of the aircraft, starting a long training relationship with the Marine Corps. In 1984, the first ICAP II version of the EA-6B arrived.

The Vikings introduced the AGM-88A High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) to the EA-6B in 1986 and the Lancers (VAQ-131) were the first to successfully fire the AGM-88 from the EA-6B. In 1988 they introduced the new &quot;Block 86&quot; version of the ICAP II Prowler. During Operation Desert Storm, an updated HARM capability was introduced, which proved tremendously successful in the subsequent combat operations.

August 1992 saw the Executive Officer&#x27;s billet filled by a USMC Lieutenant Colonel, further strengthening VAQ-129&#x27;s relationship with the Marine Corps. In the summer of 2005 the new ICAP III was delivered to the community to pave the way for the follow on platform of the EA-18G.

The retirement of the United States Air Force&#x27;s EF-111A Raven made the EA-6B and EA-18G the only tactical aircraft in the U.S. inventory capable of performing electronic attack.

On 5 August 2009, EA-18G Growlers from VAQ-129 and Electronic Attack Squadron 132 (VAQ-132) completed their first at-sea carrier-arrested landing (trap) aboard .

In 2013, VAQ-129 began training Royal Australian Air Force aircrew to operate the EA-18G.

<text>The Land Beyond the Magic Mirror (EX2) is an adventure module, written for use with the first edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; roleplaying game. It is set in the &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; campaign setting.

==Plot summary==
In this module, the player characters plummet into a strange partial plane. They encounter the Jabberwock, the Bandersnatch, and the Walrus and the Carpenter, and become involved in a gigantic game of chess.

==Publication history==
This module, like its companion &quot;Dungeonland&quot;, is a close adaptation of a work of fiction by Lewis Carroll, in this case &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;. The module was written by Gary Gygax and illustrated by Jim Holloway. It was published in 1983 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder. An appendix to the module notes that Gygax adapted the module from his own D&amp;D campaign.

To maintain the element of surprise, the module advises dungeon masters to keep the players in the dark about what is happening as long as possible, although well-read players will eventually recognize the literary source of the encounters.

In keeping with its sense of oddity and surprise, the cover of this module depicts a scene from its companion adventure EX1 &quot;Dungeonland&quot; (a battle with a hangman tree). Similarly, the cover image of EX1 &quot;Dungeonland&quot; shows an encounter from this module (the attack of the roc raven).

&quot;Dungeonland&quot; and &quot;The Land Beyond the Magic Mirror&quot; were designed to allow the DM to place them as an extension of any existing dungeon intended for 9th-12th level characters.

==Reception==
Jim Bambra positively reviewed the module in issue 48 of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine, rating it 9 out of 10. He enjoyed the &quot;rich vein of humour&quot; that runs through both this module and &quot;Dungeonland&quot;. He felt that while the modules could be played individually, they work best when played together as they frequently interconnect, and player characters adventuring in one module could suddenly find themselves in the other. Bambra felt that since the modules were designed for higher-level characters, some of the encounters were inaccessible for lower-level characters; however, he concluded that if players had high-level characters available, they should &quot;by all means play them, you won&#x27;t regret it.&quot;

<text>George Erik Rupp (born September 22, 1942) is an American educator and theologian, who served successively as president of Rice University, Columbia University, and the International Rescue Committee.

==Biography==
Rupp was born in Summit, New Jersey, the son of German immigrant parents, and was raised in Springfield Township, Union County, New Jersey. He studied at the University of Munich in Germany before graduating from Princeton University with an A.B. in English in 1964 after completing a senior thesis titled &quot;A Theatre of Ideas: Studies in Mid-Twentieth Century German and English Drama.&quot; He then received a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Yale Divinity School and, after studying for a year in Sri Lanka, a Ph.D. in religion from Harvard University. He is an ordained Presbyterian minister, but mostly retired from preaching by the mid-1980s.

He was faculty fellow in religion and then Vice Chancellor of Johnston College in the University of Redlands in Redlands, California. Rupp left Redlands to return to Harvard as Assistant and then Associate Professor of Theology in the Divinity School. He left Harvard to become Professor of Humanistic Studies and Dean of Academic Affairs at the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay in 1977, where he remained until 1979.

Rupp was the John Lord O&#x27;Brian Professor of Divinity and dean of the Harvard Divinity School from 1979 to 1985. Under his leadership, the curriculum of the school was revised to address more directly the pluralistic character of contemporary religious life. Further developments included new programs in women&#x27;s studies and religion, Jewish-Christian relations, and religion and medicine.

He was President of Rice University from 1985 to 1993, where in the course of his eight years applications for admission almost tripled, federal research support more than doubled, and the value of the Rice endowment increased by more than $500 million to $1.25 billion.

He became president of Columbia in 1993. During his nine-year tenure, he focused on enhancing undergraduate education, on strengthening the relationship of the campus to surrounding communities and New York City as a whole, and on increasing the university&#x27;s international orientation. At the same time, he completed both a financial restructuring of the university and a $2.84 billion fundraising campaign that achieved eight successive records in dollars raised.

As the IRC&#x27;s chief executive officer from 2003 to 2013, Dr. Rupp oversaw the agency&#x27;s relief and rehabilitation operations in 25 countries and its refugee resettlement and assistance programs throughout the United States. In addition, he led the IRC&#x27;s advocacy efforts in Washington, D.C., Geneva, Brussels, and other capitals on behalf of the world&#x27;s most vulnerable people. His responsibilities regularly took him to IRC program sites in Africa, Asia, and Europe. During his time as president of the IRC, the budget tripled in size.

On March 26, 2013, The Daily Mirror reported that former UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband would be stepping down from the UK Parliament to succeed Rupp as CEO of the IRC.

In July 2013, Rupp became a senior fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs, and in April 2015 he was elected chair of the International Baccalaureate Organization. He has remained actively involved with Columbia University in his post-presidency as a distinguished visiting scholar at the Institute for Religion, Culture, and Public Life; as of 2015, he also served as an adjunct professor of comparative religion, public health, and international affairs.

He is the author numerous articles, opinion pieces, and book chapters and also of seven books:
*Christologies and Cultures: Toward a Typology of Religious Worldviews
*Beyond Existentialism and Zen: Religion in a Pluralistic World
*Culture Protestantism&#x27;: German Liberal Theology at the Turn of the 20th Century
*Commitment and Community
*Globalization Challenged: Conviction, Conflict, Community
*Beyond Individualism: The Challenge of Inclusive Communities
*The Heart of Community: A Family Journey

George and his wife Nancy are the parents of two adult daughters who are teaching and writing, one with scholarly expertise in East Asia and the other a specialist in African studies, and are the grandparents of six children: four boys and two girls.

Rupp was chosen as Rice University&#x27;s commencement speaker for 2008.

<doc id="747679" wikidata="Q115479" url="?curid=747679" title="Battenberg family">
<text>The Battenberg family is a non-dynastic cadet branch of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt, which ruled the Grand Duchy of Hesse until 1918. The first member was Countess Julia von Hauke, whose brother-in-law Grand Duke Louis III of Hesse created her Countess of Battenberg in 1851, along with the style of &quot;Illustrious Highness&quot; (H.Ill.H.), at the time of her morganatic marriage to Grand Duke Louis&#x27;s brother Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine. The name of the title refers to the town of Battenberg in Hesse. In 1858, the countess&#x27; title was elevated to Princess of Battenberg, with the style of &quot;Serene Highness&quot; (H.S.H.).

In 1917, most members of the family had been residing in the British Empire and had renounced their Hessian titles, due to rising anti-German sentiment among the British during the First World War. At that point, they changed the family name to Mountbatten, an anglicised version of Battenberg. However, Juan, Count of Barcelona, a son of Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg, Queen of Spain, bore the surname of Borbón y Battenberg until his death in 1993. The last born member of the House of Battenberg who had not changed the name was the youngest son of the Princess of Battenberg, Prince Francis Joseph of Battenberg, who died childless in 1924, but his widow, Princess Anna of Battenberg also kept using the name of Battenberg until the end of her life.

== Origins ==
Prince Alexander (1823–1888) was the third son of Grand Duke Louis II of Hesse and by Rhine and of Wilhelmina of Baden, yet it was openly rumoured that his biological father was actually Baron Augustus von Senarclens-Grancy, his mother&#x27;s chamberlain. Prince Alexander&#x27;s spouse, Julia von Hauke (1825–1895), was a mere countess, the orphaned daughter of Count Moritz von Hauke, a Polish nobleman of German ancestry who had served as a general in the Imperial Russian Army and then as Deputy Minister of War of Congress Poland.

Count von Hauke&#x27;s rank was too low for his daughter&#x27;s children with Prince Alexander to qualify for the succession to the throne of the Grand Duchy of Hesse. For this reason, her new brother-in-law Louis III of Hesse created the title of Countess of Battenberg () for her and for the couple&#x27;s descendants.

In 1858, the title, which referred to the town of Battenberg in Hesse, was elevated to princely status. There was never a corresponding principality of Battenberg; the title was a non-sovereign one in the nobility of the Grand Duchy of Hesse. A previous family of counts of Battenberg had become extinct in the 14th century.

After 1858, the children of this union bore the title of Prince () or Princess (), with the style of Serene Highness (). Battenberg thus became the name of a morganatic cadet branch of the Grand Ducal family of Hesse, without the right of succession.

== Connections to royal families ==
One of the original couple&#x27;s sons, Prince Alexander of Battenberg, was made Sovereign Prince of Bulgaria in 1879. However, he was forced to abdicate in 1886.

Another son, Prince Henry of Battenberg, married Princess Beatrice, the youngest daughter of Queen Victoria. Their daughter, Victoria Eugenia Julia Ena, became queen consort of Spain. Her uncle Edward VII elevated her style to Royal Highness, so that she would have the necessary status to marry into the Spanish royal family.

Alexander and Julia&#x27;s eldest son, Prince Louis of Battenberg, became the First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy. Due to anti-German feelings prevalent in Britain during the First World War, he anglicised his name to Mountbatten, as did his children and nephews, the sons of Prince Henry and Princess Beatrice.

One of the couple&#x27;s four sons and one of their grandsons renounced their Hessian titles and were granted peerages by their cousin, George V – Prince Louis became the first Marquess of Milford Haven, while Prince Alexander, Prince Henry&#x27;s eldest son, was created Marquess of Carisbrooke.

Prince Louis&#x27;s second daughter, Princess Louise of Battenberg, married the future Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden in 1923 and became Queen Consort of Sweden in 1950. His younger son, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, became the last Viceroy of India. Prince Louis&#x27;s elder daughter, Princess Alice of Battenberg, married Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark; their son, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark (later styled as Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh), married the heir presumptive to the British throne, later Elizabeth II, after having renounced his Greek titles and taken his maternal grandfather&#x27;s and uncle&#x27;s surname of Mountbatten. The name Battenberg, in its anglicised form, is now a part of the personal surname (Mountbatten-Windsor) of some members of the British royal family.

In 1897, Prince Francis Joseph of Battenberg married Princess Anna of Montenegro, a sister of Queen Elena of Italy and a maternal aunt of Alexander I of Yugoslavia.

<doc id="747681" wikidata="Q7658823" url="?curid=747681" title="Swish cymbal">
<text>The swish cymbal and the pang cymbal are exotic ride cymbals originally developed and named as part of the collaboration between Gene Krupa and the Avedis Zildjian Company. The current Zildjian Swish Knocker is a redesign of their original swish, with more rivets, deeper bow and shallower bell, based on a cymbal made famous by Mel Lewis, who coined the name &quot;knocker&quot;.

Originally a Zildjian exclusive, both swish and pang cymbals disappeared from their catalog for a time but have reappeared. Other makers have also offered explicit &quot;swish&quot; and &quot;pang&quot; designs from time to time. Typical sizes are 16&quot; to 22&quot; for the swish, and 16&quot; to 20&quot; for the pang.

Both swish and pang have the upturned and flanged edge of a china cymbal, with a very small bell, a thin profile overall with little taper, and a relatively thick rim for their size and weight. Although principally ride cymbals, they can also serve as exotic crash cymbals, particularly in the smaller sizes and at higher volumes. As a ride they can be mounted either bell up, for a trashier tone, or bell down, for a more mellow tone and better access to the ride area; As a crash they tend to be mounted bell down, to give a traditional rim angle.

The swish has a higher tone than the pang and is washier with a less pronounced ping, and this difference is accentuated as the swish is generally sold with rivets as a sizzle cymbal, while the pang is sold without rivets. However some drummers remove the rivets from a swish, or add them to a pang, to create intermediate sounds.

Swish and pang cymbals are sometimes considered types of china cymbal, towards the mellow end of the spectrum, and cymbals that are swishes and pangs in all but name have also been offered as china types by both Zildjian and other makers. Ufip produces a &quot;swish china&quot; in 16&quot;, 18&quot;, 20&quot; and 22&quot; models.

<text>Hair is a 1979 musical anti-war comedy-drama film directed by Miloš Forman and adapted for the screen by Michael Weller, based on the 1968 Broadway musical &quot;Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical&quot;. Set against the backdrop of the hippie counterculture of the Vietnam era, the film focuses on a Vietnam War draftee who meets and befriends a &quot;tribe&quot; of hippies while en route to the army induction center. The hippies and their leader introduce him to marijuana, LSD, and their environment of unorthodox relationships and draft evasion.

The film stars an ensemble cast including John Savage, Treat Williams, Beverly D&#x27;Angelo, Annie Golden, Dorsey Wright, Don Dacus, Cheryl Barnes and Ronnie Dyson. Dance scenes were choreographed by Twyla Tharp and were performed by Tharp&#x27;s dancers. &quot;Hair&quot; was nominated for two Golden Globes: Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, and New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture (for Williams).

==Plot==
Claude Hooper Bukowski is sent off from Oklahoma to New York City, after being drafted into the Army. Before his draft board appointment, Claude explores New York; there he encounters a close-knit &quot;tribe&quot; of hippies led by George Berger. He observes the hippies panhandle from a trio of horseback riders...including Short Hills, New Jersey debutante Sheila Franklin. He later catches and mounts a runaway horse (which the hippies have rented), exhibiting his riding skills to Sheila (&quot;Donna&quot;). Claude returns the horse to Berger, who offers to show him around.

That evening, Claude gets stoned on marijuana with Berger and the tribe. He is then introduced to various race and class issues of the 1960s (&quot;Hashish&quot;, &quot;Colored Spade&quot;, &quot;Manchester&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Black/Ain&#x27;t Got No&quot;). The next morning, Berger finds a newspaper clipping that gives Sheila&#x27;s home address. The tribe members—LaFayette &quot;Hud&quot; Johnson, Jeannie Ryan (who is pregnant) and &quot;Woof Dachshund&quot;—crash a private dinner party to introduce Claude to Sheila, who secretly enjoys her rigid environment being disrupted (&quot;I Got Life&quot;). After the hippies are arrested, Claude uses his last $50 to bail Berger out of jail—where Woof resists having his hair cut (&quot;Hair&quot;).

When Sheila is unable to borrow any money from her father, Berger returns to his estranged parents&#x27; home. Berger&#x27;s mom gives him enough cash to bail out his friends. They subsequently attend a peace rally in Central Park, where Claude drops acid for the first time (&quot;Initials&quot;, &quot;Electric Blues/Old Fashioned Melody&quot;, &quot;Be In&quot;). Just as Jeannie proposes marriage to Claude, in order to keep him out of the Army, Sheila arrives to apologize. Claude&#x27;s &quot;trip&quot; reflects his inner conflict over which of three worlds he fits in with: his own native Oklahoman farm culture, Sheila&#x27;s upper-class society, or the hippies&#x27; free-wheeling environment.

Following his &quot;trip&quot;, Claude falls out with Berger and the tribe members, ostensibly due to a practical joke on Sheila (taking her clothes while she&#x27;s skinny-dipping, which forces her to hail a taxi in just her panties), but also due to their philosophical differences over the war in Vietnam—and over personal versus communal responsibility. After wandering the city (&quot;Where Do I Go?&quot;), Claude finally reports to the draft board (“Black Boys/White Boys”), completes his enlistment, and is shipped off to Nevada for basic training.

It&#x27;s now Winter in New York when Claude writes to Sheila (&quot;Walking in Space&quot;), who subsequently shares the news with the others. Berger devises a scheme to visit Claude. Meanwhile, Hud&#x27;s fiancée—with whom he has a son, LaFayette Jr.—wants to marry as they had planned earlier (&quot;Easy to Be Hard&quot;). The tribe members trick Sheila&#x27;s brother Steve out of his car, then head west to visit Claude.

The hippies arrive at the Army training center in Nevada where Claude is stationed (&quot;Three-Five-Zero-Zero&quot;, &quot;Good Morning Starshine&quot;), only to be turned away...ostensibly because the base is on alert, but also because the surly MP on duty (portrayed by real-life MP Donald Alsdurf) doesn&#x27;t care for their looks. Sheila proceeds to chat up army sergeant Fenton at a local bar, luring him to an isolated desert road where the hippies acquire his uniform and car. Berger cuts his hair and dons the uniform (symbolically becoming a responsible adult), then drives onto the Army base. He finds Claude and offers to replace him for the next headcount, so that Claude can meet Sheila and the others for a going-away picnic in the desert.

Unfortunately, just after a disguised Claude slips away to the picnic, the base becomes fully activated with immediate ship-outs for Vietnam. Berger&#x27;s ruse is (somehow) never discovered. Clearly horrified at the prospect of joining the war (any war), he is herded onto a plane to be shipped out. Claude returns to the empty barracks and frantically pursues Berger&#x27;s plane but is unable to reach it before it takes off for Southeast Asia (&quot;The Flesh Failures&quot;).

Months later, Claude (who has been dishonorably discharged for going AWOL) and Sheila -- along with the rest of the tribe -- gather at Berger&#x27;s grave in Arlington National Cemetery; the grave marker verifies that Berger was KIA in Vietnam (&quot;Let the Sunshine In&quot;). The film ends at a full-scale peace protest in Washington, D.C.

==Cast==
== Production ==
The film was shot in October 1977. Filming locations included a number of well-known spots in New York City, including Central Park&#x27;s Bethesda Fountain, Sheep Meadow, and the Central Park bandshell; and Washington Square Park. Scenes were also shot at the Fort Irwin National Training Center, in the Mojave Desert in northern San Bernardino County, California, and in Barstow, California; as well as in Washington, D.C., at the Lincoln Memorial, in the National Mall.

==Soundtrack==


* The songs &quot;The Bed&quot;, &quot;Dead End&quot;, &quot;Oh Great God of Power&quot;, &quot;I Believe in Love&quot;, &quot;Going Down&quot;, &quot;Air&quot;, &quot;My Conviction&quot;, &quot;Abie Baby&quot;, &quot;Frank Mills&quot;, and &quot;What a Piece of Work is Man&quot; were omitted. The latter five, even though recorded for the film, were eventually cut, as they slowed the film&#x27;s pace. These songs are included on the .
* A few verses from the songs &quot;Manchester, England&quot; and a small portion of &quot;Walking in Space&quot; were removed.
* While the songs &quot;Don&#x27;t Put It Down&quot; and &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; are not sung by characters in the film, they are both used as background or instrumental music for scenes at the army base. The latter was a new song written by MacDermot for the film. 
* Several other differences from songs in the movie appear on the soundtrack, mainly in omitted verses and different orchestrations. One notable difference is that the Broadway version used only a jazz combo while the movie soundtrack use orchestrations that make ample use of full horn and string sections. Many of the songs have been shortened, sped-up, rearranged, or assigned to different characters to allow for the differences in plot.

Ronny Dyson and Melba Moore, both from the Broadway version of &quot;Hair&quot;, both sing on &quot;Three Five Zero Zero&quot;.

===Charts===
==Differences from the musical==
As the film&#x27;s plot and soundtrack differ greatly from the original musical, Gerome Ragni and James Rado, who wrote the stage show with composer Galt MacDermot, were unhappy with the film adaptation. They felt it failed to capture the essence of &quot;Hair&quot; in that hippies were portrayed as &quot;oddballs&quot; and &quot;some sort of aberration&quot; without any connection to the peace movement. Ragni and Rado stated, &quot;Any resemblance between the 1979 film and the original Biltmore version, other than some of the songs, the names of the characters, and a common title, eludes us.&quot; In their view, the screen version of &quot;Hair&quot; had not yet been produced.

* In the musical, Claude is a member of a hippie &quot;Tribe&quot;...sharing a New York City apartment, leading a bohemian lifestyle, enjoying &quot;free love&quot;, and rebelling against both his parents and the draft. Eventually, however, he goes to Vietnam.
** In the film, Claude is rewritten as an innocent draftee from Oklahoma, newly arrived in New York City to join the military. In New York, he gets caught up with the group of hippies while awaiting deployment to Army training camp. They introduce Claude to their psychedelically-inspired style of living; eventually, the Tribe drives out to Nevada with the intention of visiting Claude at training camp.
* In the musical, Sheila is an outspoken feminist leader of the Tribe who loves Berger as well as Claude. 
** In the film, Sheila is a high-society debutante who catches Claude&#x27;s eye.
* In the film, Berger is not only the Tribe&#x27;s de-facto leader, but is assigned some of Claude&#x27;s conflict involving whether or not to obey the draft. A major plot change from the musical results in Berger being accidentally sent to Vietnam (despite having had no military training or indoctrination), in Claude&#x27;s place. Soon thereafter, Berger is Killed In Action.
*The musical focuses on the U.S. peace movement, as well as the love relationships among the Tribe members. 
**The film, however, focuses on the carefree antics of the hippies.

==Release==
&quot;Hair&quot; was shown out of competition at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film earned $15.3 million in the United States and Canada. By the end of 1979, it had grossed $38,290,492 worldwide.

===Critical response===
&quot;Hair&quot; received generally favorable reviews from critics at the time of release; it currently holds an 82% &quot;fresh&quot; rating on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes from 60 reviews. The critical consensus reads, &quot;Spiritedly performed by a groovy cast and imaginatively directed by Milos Forman, &quot;Hair&quot; transports audiences straight to the Age of Aquarius.&quot;

For &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby called it &quot;a rollicking musical memoir... [Michael] Weller&#x27;s inventions make this &quot;Hair&quot; seem much funnier than I remember the show&#x27;s having been. They also provide time and space for the development of characters who, on the stage, had to express themselves almost entirely in song... The entire cast is superb... Mostly... the film is a delight.&quot; Frank Rich said: &quot;If ever a project looked doomed, it was this one&quot; (referring to the &quot;largely plotless&quot; and dated musical upon which it was based, Forman&#x27;s and Tharp&#x27;s lack of movie musical experience, the &quot;largely unproven cast&quot; and the film&#x27;s &quot;grand budget&quot;); but that in spite of these obstacles, &quot;&quot;Hair&quot; succeeds at all levels—as lowdown fun, as affecting drama, as exhilarating spectacle and as provocative social observation. It achieves its goals by rigorously obeying the rules of classic American musical comedy: dialogue, plot, song and dance blend seamlessly to create a juggernaut of excitement. Though every cut and camera angle in &quot;Hair&quot; appears to have been carefully conceived, the total effect is spontaneous. Like the best movie musicals of the &#x27;50s (&quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;) and the &#x27;60s (&quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;), &quot;Hair&quot; leaps from one number to the next. Soon the audience is leaping too.&quot;

Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert both placed &quot;Hair&quot; on their list of Top Films of 1979. Siskel named it as the best film of the year, #1 on his list.

===Awards and honors===
At the 37th Golden Globe Awards, &quot;Hair&quot; was nominated for a Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, and Williams was nominated for New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture – Male. The film was also nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 1980 César Awards, losing to Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Manhattan&quot; (which was also released by United Artists).

Years later, Forman cited his loss of his moral rights to the film to the studio as eventually leading to his 1997 John Huston Award for Artists Rights from the Film Foundation:
:What was behind that [award] was that one day I had in my contract that when the studio wants to sell &quot;Hair&quot; ...to the network but they have to have my, you know, consent or how would they...what they do with it. But I didn&#x27;t have this, so what they did, they didn&#x27;t sell it to the network, they sold it to syndicated television where I didn&#x27;t have that right. What happened: the film played on 115 syndicated stations practically all over the United States, and it&#x27;s a musical. Out of 22 musical numbers, 11 musical numbers were cut out from the film, and yet it was still presented as a Milos Forman film, &quot;Hair&quot;. It was totally incomprehensible, jibberish, butchered beyond belief...

&quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its &quot;Best 1000 Movies Ever&quot; list.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;Aquarius&quot; – #33
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s Greatest Movie Musicals – Nominated

<text>Loret Miller Ruppe (January 3, 1936 – August 7, 1996) was a Director of the Peace Corps and US Ambassador to Norway. She was the wife of U. S. Congressman Philip Ruppe of Michigan.

==Early life==
Loret Miller was born January 3, 1936, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Her great-grandfather, Frederick Miller, founded the Miller Brewing Company. Her father, Frederick C. Miller, was the company chairman. Her father was killed in a plane crash with his oldest son in 1954. Ruppe attended Marymount College in New York state, and Marquette University in Milwaukee.

Loret Miller married Philip Ruppe in 1957 and settled in Houghton, Michigan, where she began her long career as a volunteer organizer and civic leader. Ruppe served as chairperson of the Houghton United Fund campaign, president of the St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital Guild, and as an active member of the Houghton County Republican Committee. Ruppe also traveled extensively through Africa, spending time in Kenya, Morocco, Egypt, and the Spanish Sahara where she saw the potential for partnerships with third world countries to meet human needs. Ruppe attended the Conference on Africa in Ditchley Park, England, in 1978 which furthered her interest in solving problems in the third world.

In 1966, Loret Miller&#x27;s husband was the Republican candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives from Michigan&#x27;s 11th congressional district who defeated incumbent Democrat Raymond F. Clevenger to be elected to the 90th Congress and was subsequently re-elected to the next five Congresses, serving from January 3, 1967, to January 3, 1979. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1978 to the 96th Congress. Loret Miller was George H. W. Bush&#x27;s campaign manager in the 1980 Michigan Presidential primary and was a leader of the Reagan-Bush campaign in Michigan that fall.

==Peace Corps Director==

On February 15, 1981, President Ronald Reagan announced the selection of Ruppe as director of the Peace Corps. The White House press office said that Mrs. Ruppe &quot;has spent most of her life in volunteer efforts,&quot; including International Neighbors Club IV, and &quot;has traveled extensively and shared ideals with past Peace Corps volunteers in many countries.&quot; Ruppe said after her nomination &quot;I have had a great interest in the Peace Corps and I&#x27;m very thrilled and excited about the nomination.&quot; Ruppe also stated her belief in the continuing relevance of the Peace Corps. &quot;At a time when we&#x27;re seeking a strong peace, I think this program can be a very important part of that,&quot; Ruppe said.

===Independence of the Peace Corps===
In 1971 the Peace Corps had lost its independent status when the Nixon Administration made it part of Action, an umbrella agency that included the Foster Grandparent Program, Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA), and the National Center for Service Learning. After the resignation of Peace Corps Director Carolyn R. Payton in 1978, President Jimmy Carter issued an executive order restoring some of its autonomy, but supporters of the agency continued to feel that under Action the Peace Corps suffered from a lack of visibility and identity. Matters came to a head in March, 1981 when Reagan appointed Thomas W. Pauken to be director of Action. Mr. Pauken served as a military intelligence officer in the Vietnam war. The Peace Corps has a prohibition against having former intelligence agents serve in the agency. Senator Alan Cranston of California led Democrats in drafting legislation to make the Peace Corps completely independent again, saying the Peace Corps could not operate with the necessary credibility and independence from the Government if it were organizationally under the direction of Mr. Pauken.

Ruppe publicly took the position that there was no need for the agency to be more independent than it already was under Action. However, on March 18, 1981, Ruppe sent a letter to Senator Alan Cranston (D-CA), which challenged Pauken&#x27;s nomination. An ACTION official told The Heritage Foundation, &quot;She fought vociferously against the Administration position that the Peace Corps should be a part of Action.&quot;

On June 20, 1981, the Peace Corps celebrated its twentieth anniversary and thousands of returned volunteers came to Howard University Washington, DC, to celebrate. At the opening of the conference, the audience of returned volunteers applauded Ruppe when she told them that she was committed to a strict policy of keeping the Peace Corps out of United States intelligence work in foreign countries. Ruppe added that on May 15, 1981, she and Secretary of State Alexander Haig had sent a joint communique to all United States embassies reaffirming that Peace Corps volunteers would not engage in spy or intelligence activities. Cranston&#x27;s legislation to sever ties between Action and the Peace Corps subsequently passed even though opposed by the Reagan administration claiming the duplication of administrative overhead would cost the taxpayers an additional $3 million to $7 million per year.

===Budget cuts===
On November 1, 1981, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Peace Corps&#x27; budget of $105 million budget would be cut to $83.6 million and that the agency had appealed to the Administration for reconsideration. Ruppe met with Secretary of State Alexander Haig about the budgetary problem and said she had found him &quot;very supportive.&quot; &quot;He said what we were doing was right in line with the Administration&#x27;s foreign policy,&quot; Ruppe said. &quot;But we haven&#x27;t heard anything yet about our appeal,&quot; Ruppe added. Ruppe was successful in restoring the cuts. In 1996 she remembered the fight for the budget. &quot;This agency&#x27;s budget has less in purchasing power than when Sargent left it in the &#x27;60s. In 1981 it was listed in the 150 Account under &#x27;miscellaneous.&#x27; We changed that. Its budget was less than the military marching band. We changed that. In 1983, an official State Department document listed us as the &#x27;Peach Corps.&#x27; I said, &#x27;I hope that doesn&#x27;t mean they will cut us to the pit.&#x27;&quot; 

===Support from Reagan===
Ruppe was eventually able to convince Ronald Reagan, originally a skeptic of the Peace Corps, that the agency had value. &quot;In 1983, I was invited to the White House for the state visit of Prime Minister Ratu Mara of Fiji. Everyone took their seats around this enormous table - President Reagan, Vice President Bush, Caspar Weinberger, the rest of the Cabinet, with the Prime Minister and his delegation, and myself. They talked about world conditions, sugar quotas, nuclear free zones. The President then asked the Prime Minister to make his presentation. A very distinguished gentleman, he drew himself up and said, &#x27;President Reagan, I bring you today the sincere thanks of my government and my people.&#x27; Everyone held their breath and there was total silence. &#x27;For the men and women of the Peace Corps who go out into our villages, who live with our people.&#x27; He went on and on. I beamed. Vice President Bush leaned over afterwards and whispered, &#x27;What did you pay that man to say that?&#x27; A week later, the Office of Management and Budget presented the budget to President Reagan with a cut for the Peace Corps. President Reagan said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t cut the Peace Corps. It&#x27;s the only thing I got thanked for last week at the State Dinner.&#x27; The Peace Corps budget went up. Vice President Bush asked kiddingly again, &#x27;What did you pay?&#x27;&quot; 

===Non-partisan status of the Peace Corps===
Ruppe came under heavy pressure from within the Reagan Administration to politicize her top staff in Washington and to choose only Republican loyalists as Country Directors overseas. In 1981, Ruppe appointed ten country directors who had been selected by the Carter Administration over White House objections. In August 1982, Reagan appointed Edward A. Curran to be Peace Corps deputy director. Prior to this appointment, Curran had served as associate director of White House personnel and as the director of the National Institute of Education. At the Peace Corps, Curran attempted to carry out Reagan Administration policy but Ruppe responded by stripping him of most of his staff and official duties, including authority as acting director in her absence. &quot;Loret&#x27;s strategy is to make him so miserable that he&#x27;ll quit,&quot; said one Peace Corps employee. &quot;We took Peace Corps out of the pit of politics and made it non-partisan. It must always signify Americans pulling together for peace,&quot; said Ruppe.

===Controversy over expansion in Central America===
On September 24, 1984, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that the Peace Corps planned to double the number of volunteers serving in Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Belize to 1,200 workers over the next three years. This move was considered controversial by many returned Peace Corps volunteers who said that it politicized the Peace Corps by bolstering Reagan&#x27;s fight against communism in Central America. &quot;They have declared the Peace Corps an instrument of U.S. foreign policy and a tool of the Reagan Administration,&quot; asserted Francine Dionne, spokesman for the Returned Peace Corps Volunteers Committee on Central America. &quot;Honduras already is running over with volunteers, and with the introduction of American troops, the place is swarming with Americans.&quot; Other returned volunteers disagreed. Senator Paul Tsongas who served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ethiopia in the 1960s said &quot;It&#x27;s important to demonstrate to the countries that we can do more than just send arms.&quot; However Tsongas added that he &quot;strongly objected&quot; to ideology lectures being given to new volunteers.

===Appeal for volunteers in Africa===
On January 15, 1985, Ruppe issued a nationwide appeal for 600 volunteers to begin famine relief and agricultural work in Mali, Zaire, Lesotho and Niger. The Peace Corps received more than 5,000 inquiries, the largest number since the early 1960s. Ruppe announced that teams of 5 to 10 volunteers would work with small-scale farmers on land preparation, water supply, storage and preservation of crops, processing and marketing assisted by the United States Agency for International Development. This effort was known as the African Food Systems Initiative (AFSI)and the Peace Corps domestic recruitment strategy was refocused on American farmers, who responded positively to some extent. The initiative&#x27;s logo was the Peace Corps dove of peace, carrying a sheaf of wheat.

===Other accomplishments===
While Ruppe was director, the Peace Corps began or resumed programs in seven countries: Sri Lanka, Haiti, Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Chad, Equatorial Guinea and the Cape Verde Islands. Ruppe also started the African Food Initiative, Women In Development, and the Leadership for Peace Campaign. Ruppe launched the Competitive Enterprise Development program to promote business-oriented projects. She created business-oriented volunteer positions within the Peace Corps to promote grass roots economic growth worldwide, an agenda that was supported by Republicans in the U.S. Congress who generally disapproved of U.S. foreign aid programs.

==Ambassador to Norway==
Ruppe was appointed Ambassador to Norway on August 7, 1989, by President George H. W. Bush and presented her credentials on August 29, 1989. She served as Ambassador until February 28, 1993.

==Personal life==
A resident of Bethesda, Maryland, Ruppe died of ovarian cancer on August 7, 1996. Ruppe was survived by her husband, five daughters, five sisters and a brother. Inspired by her mother, Miller Ruppe&#x27;s daughter, Dr. Loret Miller Ruppe, served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Nepal from 1985 to 1987 and later organized conferences aimed at encouraging under-represented minorities and women to enter engineering.

==Honors and awards==
On September 5, 1996, Senator Chris Dodd who served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Dominican Republic, honored Ruppe with a speech on the floor of the Senate: &quot;When President Reagan appointed her in 1981, the Peace Corps budget was rapidly declining and was less than that of the military marching bands. By the end of Mrs. Ruppe&#x27;s tenure she had succeeded in increasing the agency&#x27;s budget almost 50 percent. In addition to budgetary challenges, Mrs. Ruppe gave the agency a political facelift by projecting the agency as non-partisan, despite the fact that she herself was a political appointee, and increasing its viability on both national and local levels. As she noted `We took Peace Corps out of the pit of politics and made it non-partisan. It must always signify Americans pulling together for peace.&#x27; As a result of her efforts, Mrs. Ruppe was respected and admired by Democrats and Republicans alike. In terms of national visibility, she brought much needed congressional and executive level attention to the Peace Corps. Prior to her leadership the organization was nicknamed `the corpse&#x27; and many believed its end was near. Under her command however, the organization was revitalized and its future secured. On a local level, she worked hard to increase young Americans&#x27; interest in participating in the program. By 1989, she had raised the number of volunteers by 20 percent.&quot;

On October 4, 1996, Michigan Tech dedicated the new Master&#x27;s International Program in Forestry to Ruppe. &quot;The new master&#x27;s program is a wonderful tribute to Loret Ruppe, and a wonderful opportunity for the Peace Corps and Michigan Tech,&quot; said John Hogan, Peace Corps associate director for international operations. In 2002 Wartburg College in Waverly, Iowa, dedicated the Loret Ruppe International Student Scholarships to honor the late Loret Miller Ruppe, former director of the Peace Corps and U.S. Ambassador to Norway, whose conviction was that &quot;peace work needs to be everybody&#x27;s work&quot;. The Mary Anne Foundation dedicated the Loret Miller Ruppe Ambassador for Peace Award &quot;to tap into the original and creative thinking of the young, regarding the issues of conflict resolution, forgiveness and reconciliation.&quot; The National Peace Corps Association makes an annual Loret Miller Ruppe Award for Outstanding Community Service to a member group for a project that promote the Third Goal of Peace Corps.

<doc id="747693" wikidata="Q1372840" url="?curid=747693" title="William Rush (sculptor)">
<text>William Rush (July 4, 1756 – January 17, 1833) was a U.S. neoclassical sculptor from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is considered the first major American sculptor. 

==Early life and education==
Rush was born in Philadelphia, the fourth child of Joseph Rush, a ship&#x27;s carpenter, and first wife, Rebecca Lincoln. As a teenager, he apprenticed three years with woodcarver Edward Cutbush, and soon surpassed his master in the art of carving of ships&#x27; figureheads in wood. 

==Career==
===Revolutionary War===
Rush saw military service during the Revolutionary War as an officer in a patriot militia. He opened his own wood carving business, and was in great demand when the U.S. Navy began building ships in Philadelphia. Later in life, he took up sculpture. Rush was one of the founders of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and taught sculpture there. He was also active in local politics, serving on the Philadelphia City Council for two decades. 

===Sculpture===


Rush carved figureheads for four of the original six frigates of the United States Navy: (&quot;Genius of the United States&quot;, 1796, whereabouts unknown), (&quot;Nature&quot;, 1797, whereabouts unknown), (&quot;Revolution&quot;, 1799, whereabouts unknown), and (&quot;Goddess of Wisdom&quot;, 1799, whereabouts unknown). He designed the figurehead for a fifth original frigate, (&quot;Hercules&quot;, 1796, carved by John Skillin, whereabouts unknown, replaced by a figurehead of Andrew Jackson 1848), and may have designed that for the sixth, (&quot;George Washington&quot;, 1800, carved by Rush&#x27;s former apprentice Daniel N. Train, whereabouts unknown).

He also carved figureheads for the U.S. Navy frigates (&quot;John Adams&quot;, 1799, whereabouts unknown), (&quot;Hercules&quot;, 1799, burned 1804), and (&quot;Captain John Smith&quot;, 1822, whereabouts unknown). And he carved figureheads for the gun-ships (&quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;, 1815, U.S. Naval Academy Museum), (&quot;Christopher Columbus&quot;, 1819, whereabouts unknown), (&quot;Sir Walter Raleigh&quot;, 1820, whereabouts unknown), and (&quot;Hercules&quot;, 1824–37, attributed to Rush or his son John, whereabouts unknown).

Rush was one of the first to create outdoor public sculpture in the United States. His twin figures, &quot;Comedy&quot; and &quot;Tragedy&quot; (1808, Philadelphia Museum of Art), were originally installed in niches on the façade of Philadelphia&#x27;s Chestnut Street Theater. His &quot;Water Nymph and Bittern&quot; (1809), was created as a fountain statue for the Center Square Waterworks, designed by Benjamin Latrobe, that stood at what is now the site of Philadelphia City Hall. The Schuylkill Permanent Bridge (Market Street Bridge) in Philadelphia was adorned with his sculptures of &quot;Agriculture&quot; and &quot;Commerce&quot; (1812, whereabouts unknown). Architect William Strickland&#x27;s Philadelphia Custom House featured a figure named &quot;Commerce&quot; (1819, whereabouts unknown).

Rush&#x27;s sculptures of &quot;Wisdom&quot; and &quot;Justice&quot; (by 1825, Fairmount Park Commission) decorated a triumphal arch erected in front of Independence Hall for the 1824 visit of the Marquis de Lafayette. During the Frenchman&#x27;s 8-day stay in Philadelphia, Rush carved a portrait bust of Lafayette (1824, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts).

His masterpiece may have been a life-sized statue of the &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, carved for St. Augustine&#x27;s Church in 1810. It was destroyed in 1844, when the church was burned during Philadelphia&#x27;s anti-Catholic riots.

Rush carved allegorical figures of &quot;The Schuylkill Chained&quot; (1825) and &quot;The Waterworks&quot; (1825) for the Fairmount Waterworks. These were installed atop pavilions along the Schuylkill River. &quot;Water Nymph and Bittern&quot; was moved to the Fairmount Waterworks at about the same time. A bronze casting of the wooden &quot;Water Nymph and Bittern&quot; statue was made in 1872.

===Death===
On January 7, 1833, Rush died in Philadelphia. He is interred at The Woodlands in Philadelphia.

==Legacy==
Rush has been called the Father of American sculpture. His early woodworking experience translated into sculptures that were deeply undercut and visible from far away through the dramatic use of contrast and strong shadows. Rush blended American artisanal tradition and neoclassical form.

Along with his friend Charles Willson Peale, Rush helped found the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, showing his interest in art beyond the American craft tradition. At age 66, he carved a self-portrait bust (1822), that is now at PAFA. &quot;Wisdom&quot; and &quot;Justice&quot; are on loan to PAFA, whose holdings include a collection of Rush&#x27;s portrait busts, a life-sized eagle statue attributed to him, and the head of the nymph from &quot;Water Nymph and Bittern&quot;.

Rush&#x27;s life-sized statue of &quot;George Washington&quot; (1815), long exhibited at Independence Hall, is now at the Second Bank of the United States. Seven life-sized allegorical figures by him (1820–22) are exhibited at the Philadelphia Masonic Temple. Collections of his portrait busts can be found at the Library Company of Philadelphia and the American Philosophical Society. A ship figurehead of &quot;Peace&quot; is at the Independence Seaport Museum. A ship figurehead of &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; is at Yale University Art Gallery. An 1817 portrait bust of &quot;George Washington&quot; is in the collection of the Museum of the American Revolution. The statues &quot;Exhortation&quot; and &quot;Praise&quot; (1812), originally located at St. Paul&#x27;s Church, were given to St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Philadelphia in 1831, along with a cluster of cherubim, also by Rush. 
The largest collection of Rush&#x27;s work can be found at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, including &quot;Comedy&quot;, &quot;Tragedy&quot;, &quot;The Schuylkill Chained&quot;, &quot;The Waterworks&quot;, portrait busts, and the 1872 bronze casting of &quot;Water Nymph and Bittern&quot; (on loan from the Fairmount Park Commission). The museum&#x27;s holdings include many of Thomas Eakins&#x27;s sketches and studies related to his paintings of Rush, along with the most famous painting: &quot;William Rush Carving his Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River&quot; (aka &quot;William Rush and His Model&quot;), 1876–77.
==Eakins and Rush==
Painter Thomas Eakins (1844-1916) felt a strong affinity toward Rush. As the 1876 Centennial Exposition approached, he painted two versions of a scene showing Rush carving his &quot;Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River&quot; (&quot;Water Nymph and Bittern&quot;). Eakins&#x27;s portrayal of Rush using a nude model may not have been historically accurate, but it was important to the painter, who made many preparatory sketches and even sculpted miniature wax figures of the people and statues in the paintings.

Late in life, Eakins returned to the subject, beginning (but not completing) two versions of Rush with a nude model. In one of his final paintings, created almost exactly a century after Rush&#x27;s carving of &quot;Water Nymph and Bittern&quot;, Eakins seems to have portrayed himself as Rush.

<doc id="747706" wikidata="Q3182396" url="?curid=747706" title="John Rushworth">
<text>John Rushworth (c. 1612 – 12 May 1690) was an English lawyer, historian and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1657 and 1685. He compiled a series of works covering the English Civil Wars throughout the 17th century called &quot;Historical Collections&quot; and also known as the &quot;Rushworth Papers&quot;.

==Early life==
Rushworth was born at Acklington Park in Warkworth, Northumberland, the son of Lawrence Rushworth and his wife Margaret Cuthbert, daughter of the vicar of Carnaby in Yorkshire. His father was an extensive landowner and Justice of the Peace at Heath, Yorkshire although he was in prison for debt in 1629. Rushworth was a solicitor at Berwick on Tweed from 1638 and entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1640. He also began work as clerk assistant at the House of Commons in 1640: assisting Henry Elsynge, Clerk of the House of Commons, he was the first recorded individual to hold the office.

==Civil Wars==
Rushworth followed the lead of John Pym, who, in a speech in the House of Commons on 17 April 1640, attacked the King and his government for problems within the country. After the outbreak of the Civil War, Rushworth as an &quot;embedded journalist&quot; followed the battles of Edge Hill (1642), Newbury (1643 and 1644), Marston Moor (1644) and Naseby (1645). In 1645 he became secretary to Thomas Fairfax, commander-in-chief of the New Model Army. When Charles I was captured, Rushworth began to record details of events leading up to, during and following the trial and execution of the King. He reported the Battle of Preston (1648) and the Battle of Worcester (1651).

==Legal authority==
Following the execution of Charles I in 1649, Rushworth became personal secretary to Oliver Cromwell. He began drafting plans for the abolition of the monarchy and the House of Lords, and the establishment of an English Republic under the leadership of Cromwell. When Cromwell became Lord Protector in 1653, Rushworth was promoted to Registrar of the Court of Admiralty. In 1657 he was elected Member of Parliament for Berwick in the Second Protectorate Parliament. As a member of the Cromwellian government he enjoyed the friendships of John Milton (who served Cromwell as the official State Censor); John Owen; John Bunyan and many other well known people of that period.

==Death of Cromwell and Restoration==
When Oliver Cromwell died on 3 September 1658, his son Richard Cromwell became Lord Protector. Rushworth was re-elected MP for Berwick in the Third Protectorate Parliament. He completed his written histories of the period and dedicated them to Richard Cromwell. As Richard Cromwell was unable to continue the office established by his father as Lord Protector, by 1660 real power had shifted to the Council of State and Rushworth became Secretary of the council. He was re-elected MP for Bewick in the Convention Parliament in 1660. Negotiations were then undertaken with the son of Charles I to return to England as its king, subject to the rule of Parliament. When Charles II took to the throne and restored the monarchy, Rushworth was reassigned to the office of Treasury Solicitor. On 7 June 1660 he presented to the Privy Council certain volumes of its records, which he claimed to have preserved from plunder &quot;during the late unhappy times&quot;, and received the king&#x27;s thanks for their restoration.

Reports were spread, however, of Rushworth&#x27;s complicity in the late king&#x27;s death, and he was called before the lords to give an account of the deliberations of the regicides, but professed to know nothing except by hearsay. Rushworth was not re-elected to the parliament of 1661, but continued to act as agent for the town of Berwick, although complaints were made that the king could look for little obedience so long as such men were agents for corporations.

==Later years==
In September 1667, when Sir Orlando Bridgeman was made lord-keeper, he appointed Rushworth his secretary. The colony of Massachusetts also employed him as its agent at a salary of twelve guineas a year and his expenses, but it was scoffingly said in 1674 that all he had done for the colony was &#x27;not worth a rush&#x27;.

Rushworth was elected MP for Berwick again in March 1679 for the First Exclusion Parliament and in October 1679 for the Second Exclusion Parliament. He was returned again in March 1681, Rushworth and seems to have supported the Whig leaders. Though he had held lucrative posts and had inherited an estate from his cousin, Sir Richard Tempest, Rushworth&#x27;s affairs were greatly embarrassed. He spent the last six years of his life in the King&#x27;s Bench Prison in Southwark, &quot;where, being reduced to his second childship, for his memory was quite decayed by taking too much brandy to keep up his spirits, he quietly gave up the ghost in his lodging in a certain alley there, called Rules Court, on 12 May 1690&quot;. He was buried in St. George&#x27;s Church, Southwark. Wood states that Rushworth died at the age of eighty-three, but in a letter written in 1675 Rushworth describes himself as sixty-three at that date.

==Influence==
While Rushworth was remembered as a person, his writings found favour in America where they served as a source of inspiration for Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson bought a copy of &quot;Rushworth&#x27;s Historical Collections&quot; for use in his own library and he often quoted from them. Rushworth was a contemporary of John Lilburne whose writings had a profound impact on the history of the English Civil Wars of the 17th century. Although his senior, he also shared much in common with Oliver Cromwell (born 1599), because they were evangelical Christians who believed that the Church of England should undergo a total reformation, contrary to the wishes of King Charles I. His views of Charles I as a king who had declared war on his own people, were later echoed in words by Thomas Jefferson and others when writing about the reign of George III in the Declaration of Independence.

==Family==
Rushworth married Hannah Widdrington, daughter of Lewis Widdrington, and sister of Sir Thomas Widdrington, who later became the Speaker of the House of Commons. On his death Rushworth left four daughters:
# Hannah, married, February 1664, Sir Francis Fane of Fulbeck, Lincolnshire
# Rebecca, married, August 1667, Robert Blaney of Kinsham, Herefordshire
# Margaret
# Katherine, whose letter to the Duke of Newcastle on her father&#x27;s death is printed in the &quot;Report on the Duke of Portland&#x27;s Manuscripts&quot;

==Legacy==
In 1890, King&#x27;s Bench Prison in Rule&#x27;s Court was demolished. Rushworth School was then built on the site and the court was renamed Rushworth Street. A portrait of Rushworth, by R. White, is prefixed to the third part of his &quot;Historical Collections&quot;.

<text>The Canadian Trade Office in Taipei (CTOT; ; ) is Canada&#x27;s representative office in Taiwan, which functions as a &quot;de facto&quot; embassy in the absence of official diplomatic relations in which Canada recognized the People&#x27;s Republic of China in October 1970 in accordance with the &quot;one-China policy&quot;. 

== History ==
Canada established diplomatic representation with the Republic of China (ROC) in 1942, when it dispatched an ambassador to the temporary capital of Chongqing. The Canadian embassy was moved to Nanking in 1946, where it remained until the city was taken by Communist forces on 23 April 1949. Canada chose not to establish an embassy in Taipei, instead maintaining relations through a trade mission in Manila. Canadian citizens in Taiwan received consular assistance from the British consulate.

Canada and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) signed a joint communiqué marking the establishment of diplomatic relations on 13 October 1970, in which Canada recognizes the PRC government as the &quot;sole legal government of China&quot; and &quot;takes note&quot; of China&#x27;s position that Taiwan is an &quot;inalienable part of the territory&quot; of the PRC. It is the position of the PRC government that countries with which it has diplomatic relations may not also maintain official relations with the Republic of China.

The office started operations on 28 November 1986. Staff were initially drawn from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, but the CTOT is now fully funded by the Government of Canada and staffed by the federal government departments Global Affairs Canada and Citizenship and Immigration Canada. Despite its name, the CTOT does not differ from any other Canadian overseas mission. The CTOT does everything from issuing Canadian passports and providing consular services, to promoting trade and investment cooperation and cultural/educational exchanges. In addition, there are also provincial representatives from the Governments of Alberta and Quebec.

The ROC, likewise, is represented in Canada by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canada, which has established offices in Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal as de facto embassy and consulate. The Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) has operated non-governmental trade offices in Canada since the creation of the Far East Trade Services in Montreal in 1970.

<doc id="747712" wikidata="Q2290948" url="?curid=747712" title="Thomas Jefferson Rusk">
<text>Thomas Jefferson Rusk (December 5, 1803July 29, 1857) was an early political and military leader of the Republic of Texas, serving as its first secretary of war and as a general at the Battle of San Jacinto. He was later a U.S. politician and served as a senator from Texas from 1846 until his suicide. He served as the president pro tempore of the United States Senate in 1857.

== Early life ==
Rusk was born in Pendleton, South Carolina, to John Rusk, a stonemason, and Sterritt Rusk. After being admitted to the bar in 1825, Rusk began his law practice in Clarkesville, Georgia. In 1827, he married Mary F. (Polly) Cleveland, the daughter of General Benjamin Cleveland, grandson of Col. Benjamin Cleveland of King&#x27;s Mountain fame. Rusk became a business partner of his father-in-law after the marriage. He lived in the gold region of Georgia and made sizable mining investments. In 1834, however, the managers of the company in which he had invested embezzled all the funds and fled to Mexican Texas. Rusk pursued them to Nacogdoches, but never recovered the money.

Made by Thomas Jefferson Rusk (section)

== Texas Revolution ==
Rusk decided to stay in Texas and became a citizen of Mexico in 1835, applied for a headright in David G. Burnet&#x27;s colony, and sent for his family. After hearing Nacogdoches citizens denounce the despotism of Mexico, Rusk became involved in the independence movement. He organized volunteers from Nacogdoches and hastened to Gonzales, where his men joined Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s army in preventing the Mexicans from seizing their cannon. They proceeded to San Antonio, but Rusk left the army before the Siege of Béxar.

The provisional government named him inspector general of the army in the Nacogdoches District. As a delegate from Nacogdoches to the Convention of 1836, Rusk not only signed the Texas Declaration of Independence, but also chaired the committee to revise the constitution of the Republic of Texas. The &quot;ad interim&quot; government, installed on March 17, 1836, appointed Rusk as secretary of war. When informed that the Alamo had fallen and the Mexican army was moving eastward, Rusk helped President David Burnet to move the government to Harrisburg.

After the Mexicans killed all James W. Fannin&#x27;s Texan army at Goliad, Burnet sent Rusk with orders for General Sam Houston to make a stand against the enemy. Rusk participated with bravery in the defeat of Santa Anna on April 21, 1836, in the Battle of San Jacinto. From May to October 1836, he served as commander-in-chief of the Army of the Republic of Texas, with the rank of brigadier general. He followed the Mexican troops westward as they retired from Texas to be certain of their retreat beyond the Rio Grande. Then, he conducted a military funeral for the troops killed at Goliad.

==Republic of Texas==

In the first regularly elected administration, President Houston appointed Rusk secretary of war, but after a few weeks, Rusk resigned to take care of pressing domestic problems. At the insistence of friends, however, he represented Nacogdoches in the Second Congress of the Republic (1837–1838). Rusk was a mason. He joined Milam Lodge No. 40 (Later Milam Lodge #2) in Nacogdoches in 1837 and was a founding member of the Grand Lodge of Texas, organized in Houston on December 20, 1837.

As chairman of the House Military Committee in 1837, he sponsored a militia bill that passed over Houston&#x27;s veto, and Congress elected Rusk major general of the militia. In the summer of 1838, he commanded the Nacogdoches militia, which suppressed the Córdova Rebellion. In October, when Mexican agents were discovered among the Kickapoo Indians, Rusk defeated those Indians and their Indian allies. He captured marauding Caddo Indians in November 1838 and risked an international incident when he invaded United States territory to return them to the Indian agent in Shreveport, Louisiana.

On December 12, 1838, the Texas Congress elected Rusk chief justice of the republic&#x27;s Supreme Court. He served until June 30, 1840, when he resigned to resume his law practice. Later, he headed the bar of the Republic of Texas. J. Pinckney Henderson, later the first governor of the state of Texas, and he formed a law partnership in 1841.

Early in 1843, Rusk was called upon once again to serve as a military commander. Concern over the lack of protection on the frontier caused Congress, in a joint ballot on January 16, 1843, to elect Rusk major general of the militia of the Republic of Texas, but he resigned in June when Houston obstructed his plans for aggressive warfare against Mexico. Rusk then turned his energies to establishing Nacogdoches University (operated 1845–1895). He served as vice president of the university when the charter was granted in 1845 and president in 1846.

== State of Texas ==
Rusk supported Sam Houston and the growing movement to annex Texas to the United States. He was president of the republic&#x27;s Convention of 1845, which accepted the annexation terms. The first Texas state legislature elected Houston and him to the United States Senate in February 1846. Rusk received the larger number of votes and the longer term of office.

Rusk and Houston forgot past differences as they worked to settle the southwest boundary question in favor of Texas&#x27; claim to the Rio Grande. Rusk supported the position of US President James K. Polk on the necessity of the Mexican War and the acquisition of California. In the debate over the Compromise of 1850, Rusk refused to endorse secession, proposed by some in the caucus of Southern congressmen. He vigorously defended Texas&#x27; claims to the land used to create the New Mexico Territory in 1850, arguing for financial compensation for Texas.

As an early advocate of a transcontinental railroad through Texas, Senator Rusk made speeches in the Senate and throughout Texas in support of a southern route. The Gadsden Purchase received his support. Rusk was in favor of the Kansas–Nebraska Act. President James Buchanan offered him the position of United States postmaster general in 1857, but he turned it down. (Buchanan gave the post to Aaron V. Brown.)

While Rusk attended to duties in Washington, DC, his wife died of tuberculosis on April 23, 1856. Five of their seven children were still living at the time. During a special session in March 1857, he was elected president pro tempore of the United States Senate.

== Suicide ==
Missing his wife and ill from a tumor at the base of his neck, Rusk killed himself by a self-inflicted gunshot wound on July 29, 1857. He was 53 years old.

== Legacy ==
* The State of Texas placed a monument at the graves of Rusk and his wife, Mary, in Oak Grove Cemetery in Nacogdoches, Texas.
*Rusk County and the town of Rusk were named in his honor.
* Part of his homestead became the campus of Stephen F. Austin State University.
* A statue of Rusk is in front of the Rusk County courthouse in Henderson, Texas.
*His handwriting was the basis for the font Texas Hero designed by Brian Willson. 
* Former Secretary of State Dean Rusk is a distant cousin.

<text>Lynn Ann Conway (January 2, 1938 – June 9, 2024) was an American computer scientist, electrical engineer, and transgender activist.

In the 1960s, while working at IBM, Conway invented generalized dynamic instruction handling, a key advancement used in out-of-order execution, used by most modern computer processors to improve performance. IBM fired Conway in 1968 after she revealed her intention to undergo a gender transition, which the company apologized for in 2020.

Following her transition, Conway adopted a new name and identity and restarted her career. She worked at Xerox PARC from 1973 to 1983, where she led the &quot;LSI Systems&quot; group. She initiated the Mead–Conway VLSI chip design revolution in very large-scale integrated (VLSI) microchip design, which reshaped the field of microchip design during the 1980s.

Conway joined the University of Michigan as a professor of electrical engineering and computer science in 1985. She retired from active teaching and research in 1998 as professor emerita. Conway began publicly discussing her gender transition in 1999 and was a transgender activist until her death in 2024.

==Early life and education==
Conway was born in Mount Vernon, New York, on January 2, 1938 to Christine Alice (née Burney) Savage (1904–1977) and Rufus Savage (1904–1966). Raised as a boy, Conway was brought up in Hartsdale and White Plains, New York, as a shy child who experienced gender dysphoria. After her parents divorced in 1945, Conway and her younger brother, Blair Savage (1941–2022), were raised by their mother. Conway became fascinated by astronomy (building a reflector telescope one summer) and did well in math and science in school.

After graduating from White Plains High School in 1955, Conway entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and began an attempted gender transition in 1957. Facing a lack of social and medical support, she withdrew from MIT in 1959 and eventually detransitioned.

After working as an electronics technician for several years, Conway resumed education at Columbia University&#x27;s School of Engineering and Applied Science, earning B.S. and M.S.E.E. degrees in 1962 and 1963.

==Early research at IBM==
Conway was recruited by IBM Research in Yorktown Heights, New York, in 1964, and was soon selected to join the architecture team designing an advanced supercomputer, working alongside John Cocke, Brian Randell, Herbert Schorr, Ed Sussenguth, Fran Allen and other IBM researchers on the Advanced Computing Systems (ACS) project, inventing multiple-issue out-of-order dynamic instruction scheduling while working there. The Computer History Museum has stated that &quot;The ACS architecture ... appears to have been the first &#x27;superscalar&#x27; design&quot;.

==Gender transition==
After learning about Harry Benjamin&#x27;s pioneering research in healthcare for transsexual women, which included the feasibility of sex reassignment surgery, Conway sought his assistance. Struggling with severe clinical depression due to gender dysphoria, she contacted Dr. Benjamin, who agreed to provide counseling and prescribed hormone replacement therapy, which Conway resumed in 1967.

While struggling with life in a male role, Conway had married a woman in 1963 and had two children. Under the legal constraints then in place, she was denied access to their children after transitioning.

Although she had hoped to be allowed to transition on the job, IBM fired Conway in 1968 after she revealed her intention to transition. In 2020, IBM publicly apologized to Conway for firing her at a public event with Diane Gherson, then IBM&#x27;s senior vice president of human relations. At the event, Conway was awarded the IBM Lifetime Achievement Award for her work at IBM and later work.

==Post-transition career==
Upon completing her gender transition in 1968, Conway took a new name and identity and restarted her career in stealth-mode as a contract programmer at Computer Applications, Inc. She then worked as a digital system designer and computer architect at Memorex from 1969 to 1972.

Conway joined Xerox PARC in 1973, where she led the &quot;LSI Systems&quot; group under Bert Sutherland. When in PARC, Conway founded the multiproject wafers (MPW) technology. Collaborating with Ivan Sutherland and Carver Mead on very-large-scale integration (VLSI) design methodology, she co-authored &quot;Introduction to VLSI Systems&quot;, a groundbreaking work that would soon become a standard textbook in chip design, used in nearly 120 universities by 1983. With over 70,000 copies sold, and the new integration of her MPC79/MOSIS innovations, the Mead and Conway revolution became part of VLSI design.

In 1978, Conway served as a visiting associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, teaching a now-famous VLSI design course based on a Mead–Conway text draft. The course validated the new design methods and textbook and established the syllabus and instructor&#x27;s guidebook used in later courses worldwide.

Among Conway&#x27;s contributions was the invention of dimensionless, scalable design rules that greatly simplified chip design and design tools, and invention of a new form of internet-based infrastructure for rapid prototyping and short-run fabrication of large numbers of chip designs. They aimed to address the escalating complexity of chip design, as traditional methods struggled to keep pace with Moore&#x27;s law. The new infrastructure was institutionalized as the Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service (MOSIS) system in 1981. Mead and Conway received &quot;Electronics&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual award of achievement in 1981. VLSI researcher Charles Seitz commented that &quot;MOSIS represented the first period since the pioneering work of Eckert and Mauchley on the ENIAC in the late 1940s that universities and small companies had access to state-of-the-art digital technology.&quot;

The impact and research methods underlying the development of the Mead–Conway VLSI design methodology and the MOSIS prototype are detailed in a 1981 Xerox report, the Euromicro Journal, and several historical overviews of computing. Mead-Conway&#x27;s methods also came under ethnographic study in 1980 by PARC anthropologist Lucy Suchman, who published her interviews with Conway in 2021.

In 1983, Conway left Xerox to join DARPA, where she was a key architect of the United States Department of Defense&#x27;s Strategic Computing Initiative. In a contemporary &quot;USA Today&quot; article about Conway&#x27;s joining DARPA, Mark Stefik, a Xerox scientist who worked with her, said &quot;Lynn would like to live five lives in the course of one life&quot;. Douglas Fairbairn, a former Xerox associate, said &quot;She figures out a way so that everybody wins.&quot; In &quot;The Net Effect&quot;, sociologist Thomas Streeter wrote that Conway’s decision to join DARPA reflected her rejection of antiwar liberalism.

Conway joined the University of Michigan in 1985 as professor of electrical engineering and computer science and associate dean of engineering. There, she specialized in visual communications and designing control systems for hybrid internet and broadband-cable user interfaces. She retired from active teaching and research in 1998 as professor emerita at Michigan.

==Computer science legacy==
The Mead–Conway VLSI chip design revolution quickly spread through research universities and the computing industry during the 1980s. It fostered the growth of the electronic design automation industry, established the foundry model for chip design and manufacturing, and spurred a wave of influential technology startups throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

In the fall of 2012, the IEEE published a special issue of the &quot;IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine&quot; devoted to Conway&#x27;s career, including a career memoir by Conway and peer commentaries by Chuck House, former Director of Engineering at HP, Carlo Séquin, and Kenneth L Shepard. James F. Gibbons stated in his tribute that Conway, from his perspective, &quot;was the singular force behind the entire &#x27;foundry&#x27; development that emerged.&quot; Subsequently the scope of Conway&#x27;s contributions gained wider retrospective attention. &quot;Since I didn&#x27;t #LookLikeanEngineer, few people caught on to what I was really doing back in the 70s and 80s,&quot; Conway later said.

In 2020, National Academy of Engineering President John L. Anderson stated that &quot;Lynn Conway is not only a revolutionary pioneer in the design of VLSI systems ... But just as important, Lynn has been very brave in telling her own story, and her perseverance has been a reminder to society that it should not be blind to the innovations of women, people of color, or others who don&#x27;t fit long outdated – but unfortunately, persistent – perceptions of what an engineer looks like.&quot;

Conway named the phenomenon of women and people of color being overlooked in historical accounts of innovations &quot;the Conway Effect.&quot; She described it in the IEEE Computer Society&#x27;s &quot;Computer&quot; magazine: &quot;This is seldom deliberate—rather, it&#x27;s a result of the accumulation of advantage by those who are expected to innovate.&quot;

In 2023, Lynn Conway collaborated with Jim Boulton to create &quot;Lines in the Sand&quot;, a short comic book that tells the story of the invention VLSI. The launch event took place at the Centre for Computing History on November 23, 2023.

==Transgender activism==
When nearing retirement, Conway learned that the story of her early work at IBM might soon be revealed through the investigations of Mark Smotherman that were being prepared for a 2001 publication. She began coming out in 1999 to friends and colleagues about her gender transition, using her website to tell her story. Her life story was then more widely reported in 2000 in profiles in &quot;Scientific American&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. In a later &quot;Forbes&quot; interview, Conway commented &quot;From the 1970s to 1999 I was recognized as breaking the gender barrier in the computer science field as a woman, but in 2000 it became the transgender barrier I was breaking.&quot;

After sharing her story publicly, Conway began working in transgender activism to raise awareness, protect and expand trans rights, and promote understanding of gender identity and the process of gender transition. She provided assistance to numerous other transgender women and maintained a website providing medical resources and emotional advice. She maintained a website titled &quot;Transsexual Women&#x27;s Successes&quot; to, in her words, &quot;provide role models for individuals who are facing gender transition.&quot; Her website also provided news related to transgender issues and information on gender-affirming surgery and academic inquiries into the prevalence of transsexualism and transgender and transsexual issues in general.

She also advocated for equal opportunities and employment protections for transgender people in high-technology industry, and for elimination of the pathologization of transgender people by the psychiatric community.

Conway was a critic of Blanchard&#x27;s transsexualism typology. Along with Andrea James and Deirdre McCloskey, she was a key person in the campaign against J. Michael Bailey&#x27;s book about the theory, &quot;The Man Who Would Be Queen.&quot; Conway and McCloskey accused Bailey of conducting research on human subjects without their knowledge, sending letters to Northwestern University about this alleged misconduct.

Alice Dreger, in her book &quot;Galileo&#x27;s Middle Finger&quot;, criticized Conway for filing a lawsuit against Bailey. Conway alleged Bailey lacked a clinical psychologist license when he wrote letters in support of a young trans woman seeking to transition. Dreger countered that Bailey did not need a license as he provided his services without compensation. Dreger noted that Bailey was transparent in his letters, detailing his brief interactions with the women and his qualifications, which likely explained why Illinois authorities did not act on the complaint. Conway responded, accusing Dreger of misrepresenting the controversy by portraying it as a personal attack on Bailey rather than addressing the broader protest from the trans community.

Conway was a cast member in the first all-transgender performance of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; in Los Angeles in 2004, and appeared in a Logo documentary film about that event entitled &quot;Beautiful Daughters.&quot;

In 2009, Conway was named one of the &quot;Stonewall 40 trans heroes&quot; on the 40th anniversary of the Stonewall riots by the International Court System and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.

In 2013, with support from many tech industry leaders, Conway and Leandra Vicci of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill lobbied the directors of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers for transgender inclusion in the their code of ethics. The code became fully LGBT inclusive in January 2014.

In 2014, &quot;Time Magazine&quot; named Conway as one of &quot;21 Transgender People Who Influenced American Culture&quot;.

In 2015, she was selected for inclusion in &quot;The Trans100&quot; and was interviewed in 2020 for inclusion in the Trans Activism Oral History Project.

==Personal life and death==
Conway married a woman in 1963, and they had two daughters together. Following their divorce in 1968, Conway was denied access to their children.

In 1987, Conway met her husband Charles &quot;Charlie&quot; Rogers, a professional engineer who shared her interest in the outdoors, including whitewater canoeing and motocross racing. They soon started living together and bought a house with of meadow, marsh, and woodland in rural Jackson, Michigan in 1994. They were married on August 13, 2002. In 2014, the University of Michigan&#x27;s &quot;The Michigan Engineer&quot; alumni magazine documented the connections between Conway&#x27;s engineering explorations and her personal life.

Conway died from a heart condition at her home on June 9, 2024, at the age of 86.

<text>Ralph Nicholas Chubb (8 February 1892 – 14 January 1960) was an English poet, printer and artist. Heavily influenced by Whitman, Blake, and the Romantics, his work was the creation of a highly intricate personal mythology, one that was anti-materialist and sexually revolutionary.

==Life==
Ralph Chubb was born in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. His family moved to the historic town of St Albans before his first birthday. Chubb attended St Albans School and Selwyn College, Cambridge, before becoming an officer in the First World War. He served with distinction but developed neurasthenia, and he was invalided out in 1918.

From 1919 to 1922 Chubb studied at the Slade School of Art in London. It was there that he met Leon Underwood and other influential artists. He went on to contribute several articles and poems for Underwood&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Island&quot;. Although his work was displayed at such venues as the Goupil Gallery and the Royal Academy of Art, his paintings did not sell. There are several in public collections in Britain. His major painting &quot;The Well&quot; (1920) is in Wakefield; Southampton has bathers with boys wrestling, and there are nudes at Leamington, all illustrated in the Public Art Foundation catalogues. He moved with his family to the village of Curridge, near Newbury in Berkshire. He began to devote his artistic talents to the printed works which would remain his chief labour in life.

His books were created in several chief phases. His typeset books of the twenties were a humble offering, exhibiting Chubb&#x27;s talent for woodcutting and his quaint, visually inspired poetry. Even at this early stage, Chubb&#x27;s lifelong obsession with adolescent males was beginning to become apparent. He expands upon this theme more explicitly in &quot;An Appendix&quot;, a pederastic and spiritualist manifesto duplicated from a cursive manuscript. &quot;An Appendix&quot; was the first of his printed works to be printed in his own hand; he soon followed this with the first of his opulent lithographic books, &quot;The Sun Spirit&quot;. Throughout the nineteen-thirties, Chubb&#x27;s books became more elaborate and appealing. &quot;Water Cherubs&quot; crystallises Chubb&#x27;s aesthetic of the youthful male form, and &quot;The Secret Country&quot; unfolds like an illuminated manuscript, recounting stories of Chubb&#x27;s family and his journeys among the Romani of the New Forest in Hampshire. Chubb&#x27;s printing press was interrupted by the war, but in 1948 he entered into the third period of career with two massive volumes: &quot;The Child Of Dawn&quot; and &quot;Flames of Sunrise&quot;. Each page of these two volumes is crowded with obscure digressions on Chubb&#x27;s mythology and drawings of symbolic significance. Briefly summarised, Chubb&#x27;s vision was a prophecy of the redemption of &#x27;Albion&#x27;, or England, by the boy-god Ra-el-phaos, of whom Ralph claimed himself to be the prophet and herald. This echoes an earlier announcement to be found in &quot;The Heavenly Cupid&quot;:

I announce a secret event as tremendous and mysterious as any that has occurred in the spiritual history of the world. I announce the inauguration of a Third Dispensation, the dispensation of the Holy Ghost on earth, and the visible advent thereof on earth in the form of a Young Boy of thirteen years old, naked perfect and unblemished.

Other themes run through all of Chubb&#x27;s work. He was forever haunted by the memory of a young chorister at St Albans who disappeared from Chubb&#x27;s life just as he had summoned up the courage to speak to him. Similarly, a brief sexual relationship with another boy when Ralph was 19 seemed to serve as a template for future visions of paradise. Chubb&#x27;s books become progressively more self-involved and paranoid. Seeking to articulate his pederastic desires, he created a personal mythology which explained everything in terms only he could understand. Nonetheless, Chubb&#x27;s work is of fascinating psychological significance; each of the various angels, knights, seers, and boy-gods in his dream world represents an aspect of his introspective and persecuted self.

Chubb, like many other artists of his generation, resented science for its intrusion into his imagination. He disparaged the scientists, orthodox theologians, and politicians of world, accusing them of squelching his personal thirst for liberty. In 1927 he wrote:

Existence, besides being a miracle, is a symbol. Albeit here for inscrutable purposes the spirit is only to be discerned as it were in a distorting-glass. (&quot;The Book of God&#x27;s Madness&quot;)

Chubb sought to persuade his readers in &quot;An Appendix&quot; of the verity of his solipsism by illustrating some examples of serendipitous events from his life. His aim is more on the mark when he excoriates the taboos and frustrations of modern life.

The green green hills, the blue blue sky, blue sea, great golden SUN, yellow dandelions, the pink naked beauty of ripe boyhood, deathless free and happy, brimming with health. This I must have. Nothing less than this can ever satisfy me! GIVE ME MY HEAVEN! GIVE ME MY HEAVEN! (&quot;Water-Cherubs&quot;)

Failing in health and facing continuing legal and financial difficulties, Chubb abandoned his controversial works in the mid-fifties, and began to collect and reprint his early poems and childhood memories. &quot;Treasure Trove&quot; and &quot;The Golden City&quot; (published posthumously) are devoid of the usual profusion of naked, lissome youths, but instead offer a glimpse into his youthful imagination, and some of his most charming poetry. In the final years of his life he donated his remaining volumes to the national libraries of Britain. He died peacefully at Fair Oak Cottage in Hampshire and was buried next to his parents at the Kingsclere Woodland Cemetery in Hampshire.

Chubb&#x27;s own assessment of his work conforms to the general critical reaction:

I do not necessarily claim to be a great artist or writer; but I claim to be a true spirit – this is a subtler test. Seek me out; but you may not find me. (&quot;An Appendix&quot;)

==Works==
None of the editions of Chubb&#x27;s books exceed more than 200 copies, and some of his lithographed masterworks exist in only 30 or 40 copies, of which a mere six or seven are meticulously hand-coloured by Chubb.

<text>The Almanach de Gotha () is a directory of Europe&#x27;s royalty and higher nobility, also including the major governmental, military and diplomatic corps, as well as statistical data by country. First published in 1763 by C. W. Ettinger in Gotha in Thuringia, Germany at the ducal court of Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, it came to be regarded as an authority in the classification of monarchies and their courts, reigning and former dynasties, princely and ducal families, and the genealogical, biographical and titulary details of Europe&#x27;s highest level of aristocracy. It was published from 1785 annually by Justus Perthes Publishing House in Gotha, until 1944. 

In 1992, the family of Justus Perthes re-established its right to use the name &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot;. In 1998, a London-based publisher, John Kennedy, acquired the rights for use of the title of &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot; from Justus Perthes Verlag Gotha GmbH, then a fully-owned subsidiary of Ernst Klett Schulbuchverlag GmbH, Stuttgart. The last edition produced by Justus Perthes was the 181st, produced in 1944. After a gap of 54 years the first of the new editions (the 182nd) was published in 1998 with English, the new diplomatic language, used as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; in the place of French or German. Perthes regards the resultant volumes as new works, and not as a continuation of the editions which Perthes had published from 1785 to 1944. Two volumes have been printed since 1998, with Volume I containing lists of the sovereign, formerly sovereign and mediatised houses of Europe, and a diplomatic and statistical directory; and Volume II containing lists of the non-sovereign princely and ducal houses of Europe.

==Gotha publication (1763–1944)==
The original &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot; provided detailed facts and statistics on nations of the world, including their reigning and formerly reigning houses, those of Europe being more complete than those of other continents. It also named the highest incumbent officers of state, members of the diplomatic corps, and Europe&#x27;s upper nobility with their families. At its most extensive the &quot;Almanach&quot; had more than 1200 pages, fewer than half of which were dedicated to monarchical or aristocratic data. It acquired a reputation for the breadth and precision of its information on royalty and nobility compared to other almanacs.

The &quot;Almanach&quot;&#x27;s publication by Justus Perthes began at the ducal court of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in Germany. The almanac listed the reigning dynasty of that court first well into the 19th century, usually followed by kindred sovereigns of the House of Wettin and then, in alphabetical order, other families of princely rank, reigning and non-reigning. Although always published in French, other almanacs in French and English were more widely sold internationally. The almanac&#x27;s structure changed and its scope expanded over the years. The second portion, called the &quot;Annuaire diplomatique et statistique&quot; (&quot;Diplomatic and Statistical Yearbook&quot;), provided demographic and governmental information by nation, similar to other almanacs. Its first portion, called the &quot;Annuaire généalogique&quot; (&quot;Genealogical Yearbook&quot;), came to consist essentially of three sections: reigning and formerly reigning families, mediatized families and non-sovereign families at least one of whose members bore the title of prince or duke.

The first section always listed Europe&#x27;s sovereign houses, whether they reigned as emperor, king, grand duke, duke, prince, or some other title such as prince elector, margrave, landgrave, count palatine or pope. Until 1810 these sovereign houses were listed alongside such families and entities as Barbiano-Belgiojoso, Clary-Aldringen, Colloredo-Mansfeld, Fürstenberg, the Emperor, Genoa, Gonzaga, Hatzfeldt, Jablonowski, Kinsky, Ligne, Paar, Radziwill, Starhemberg, Thurn and Taxis, Turkey, Venice, the Order of Malta and the Teutonic Knights. In 1812, these entries began to be listed in groups: first were German sovereigns who held the rank of grand duke or prince elector and above (the Duke of Saxe-Gotha was, however, listed here along with, but before, France—see below).

Listed next were Germany&#x27;s reigning ducal and princely dynasties under the heading &quot;College of Princes&quot;, e.g. Hohenzollern, Isenburg, Leyen, Liechtenstein and the other Saxon duchies. They were followed by heads of non-German monarchies, such as Austria, Brazil, and Great Britain. Fourth were listed non-reigning dukes and princes, whether mediatized or not, including La Rochefoucauld (including Dominique and his son Gabriel), Arenberg, Croy, Fürstenberg alongside Batthyany, Jablonowski, Sulkowski, Porcia and Benevento.

In 1841 a third section was added to those of the sovereign dynasties and the non-reigning princely and ducal families. It was composed exclusively of the mediatised houses of comital rank recognized by the various states of the German Confederation as belonging, since 1825, to the same historical category and sharing some of the same privileges as reigning dynasties because they previously held the rank of ruling Princes of the Holy Roman Empire; these families were German with a few exceptions (e.g. Bentinck, Rechteren-Limpurg). The 1815 treaty of the Congress of Vienna had authorized – and Article 14 of the German Confederation&#x27;s &quot;Bundesakt&quot; (charter) recognized – retention from the German Imperial regime of equality of birth for marital purposes of mediatized families (called &quot;Standesherren&quot;) to reigning dynasties. In 1877, the mediatized comital families were moved from section III to section II A, where they joined the princely mediatized families.

In the third section were members of such non-reigning but historically notable princely or ducal families such as Rohan, Orsini, Ursel, Norfolk, Czartoryski, Galitzine, La Rochefoucauld, Kinsky, Radziwill, Merode, Dohna and Alba.

Other deposed European dynasties (e.g. Arenberg, Biron, Dadiani, Boncompagni-Ludovisi, Giray, Murat) did not benefit from a similar interpretation of their historical status in the almanac. Many princely or ducal families were listed only in its third, non-dynastic section or were excluded altogether, evoking criticism in the 20th century from such genealogists as Jean-Engelbert, Duke d&#x27;Arenberg, William Addams Reitwiesner and Cyril Toumanoff the latter commenting that the changes displayed &quot;pan-German triumphalism&quot;

Even in the early 19th century there were objections to the almanac&#x27;s retention of deposed dynasties, although not necessarily the desired changes. The elected Emperor Napoleon protested in writing to his foreign minister, Champagny: &quot;Monsieur de Champagny, this year&#x27;s &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot; is badly done. First comes the Comte de Lille [title used in exile by the future King Louis XVIII of France], followed by all the princes of the Confederation as if no change has been made in the constitution of Germany; the family of France is named inappropriately therein. Summon the Minister of Gotha, who is to be made to understand that in the next Almanach all of this is to be changed. The House of France must be referred to as in the [French] Imperial Almanac; there must be no further mention of the Comte de Lille, nor of any German prince other than those retained by the Articles of Confederation of the Rhine. You are to insist that the article be transmitted to you prior to publication. If other almanacs are printed in my allies&#x27; realms with inappropriate references to the Bourbons and the House of France, instruct my ministers to make it known that you have taken note, and that this is to be changed by next year.&quot; 
The response of the publishers was to humour Napoleon by producing two editions: one for France, with the recently ennobled, and another which included dynasties deposed since abolition of the Holy Roman Empire. A merged version, whose first section (Princely houses) included recently reigning dynasties but also the titulature of families that lost sovereignty after the fall of Napoleon in 1815, remained in publication as &quot;Gothaischer Hofkalender&quot; (Gothaic court calendar). The almanac was published in a German and a French edition as &quot;Gothaischer Hofkalender&quot; and &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot;.

In 1887 the &quot;Almanach&quot; began to include non-European dynasties in its first section, with the inclusion of one of the ruling families of India. Since 1824, the &quot;Princely houses&quot;, i.e. ruling and princely families listed in the court calendar, have been divided into three groups: (1) current sovereigns and their houses, (2) other princely and ducal houses in Germany, France and Italy and (3) mediatized German houses characterized by equality with the ruling houses. After the founding of the new German Empire, from 1877 the mediatized German princes and counts, i.e. the formerly ruling houses of the Holy Roman Empire, were grouped together as section II in order to emphasize their significance in the Old Empire as well as their right of equality with the ruling houses in the German Confederation and the New Empire, while the (never ruling) German and foreign titular princes have been moved to section III. 

The &quot;court calendar&quot; was later expanded to include the four series of paperbacks for the German and Austrian &quot;comital houses&quot; (i.e. counts, since 1825), the &quot;baronial houses&quot; (since 1848), the untitled &quot;Uradel houses&quot; (since 1900) and the untitled &quot;Briefadel houses&quot; (since 1907). The series continued until 1944, but in 1939 its title &quot;Gotha court calendar&quot; was changed to &quot;Gothaisches genealogisches Taschenbuch&quot; (Gotha genealogical paperback). This format has since been widely replicated in dynastic compilations (e.g. &quot;Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels&quot;, &quot;Fürstliche Häuser&quot;, Burke&#x27;s Royal Families of the World, &quot;Le Petit Gotha&quot;, Ruvigny&#x27;s &quot;Titled Nobility of Europe&quot;). 

===World War II and aftermath===
When Soviet troops entered Gotha in 1945, Gotha became part of communist East Germany and the publisher ceased operations.

== Recent German publications ==
From 1951 to 2013, a different publisher, &quot;C.A. Starke&quot; of Limburg, West Germany, published a multi-volume German-language publication entitled the Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels (GHdA) - (Genealogical Handbook of Nobility). Like its Gotha predecessor it was divided into subsets (&quot;Princely Houses&quot;, &quot;Comital Houses&quot;, &quot;Baronial Houses&quot;, &quot;Noble Houses&quot;); the &quot;Fürstliche Häuser&quot; (Princely Houses) subset is largely equivalent to the German language &quot;Gothaischer Hofkalender&quot; and its &quot;Fürstliche Häuser&quot; volume which was published by Perthes, or sections 1, 2 and 3 of the &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot;. The book series produced several volumes of all sections each year, often containing new, first-time post-war entries, with the respective families being updated about once every 10 to 20 years. In 2013 the publisher &quot;Starke Verlag&quot; ceased to continue to publish new books in this series after a contract termination by the author.

Instead the Gothaisches Genealogisches Handbuch (GGH) − (Gothaic Genealogical Handbook) continues the annual publication of the substantially same content as GHdA since 2015. Its subset &quot;Fürstliche Häuser&quot; (Princely Houses, the red volumes) continues with the publication of the genealogies of the European royal, princely and ducal houses, divided into the three sections as previously with Gotha and GHdA, but focuses on their current family members and refers to older volumes of the latter publications with regard to generations that are longer in the past. The publisher and editor of the new GGH publication is the &quot;Verlag des Deutschen Adelsarchivs&quot; (publishing company of the &quot;German Nobility Archive&quot;). This archive of the &quot;Union of German nobility associations&quot; has always been the author of both GHdA and GGH. In contentious questions, the &quot;German Nobility Rights Committee&quot; of this union decides.

However, no single volume of the &quot;Fürstliche Häuser&quot; of GHdA or GGH includes &quot;all&quot; the families of German and European royal, princely and ducal families that were annually included in the &quot;Hofkalender&quot; or &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot;. Rather, they are recorded alternately in successive volumes. Therefore it is necessary to use multiple volumes to trace all of Europe&#x27;s royal families. With regard to the current information, the archive works together with the respective family heads and is dependent on the cooperation and consent of the families for reasons of information privacy. Because of this required legwork, not that many princely and ducal houses of France, the UK, Italy and other countries are included, while the German ones, as well as the ruling and formerly ruling royal families of Europe are covered quite reliably.

==London publication (since 1998)==
In 1992 the family of Justus Perthes re-established its right to the use of the name &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot;. The company &quot;Justus Perthes Verlag Gotha GmbH&quot; (a subsidiary of &quot;Ernst Klett Schulbuchverlag GmbH&quot;) then sold these rights in 1995 to a new company, Almanach de Gotha Limited, formed in London. The new publisher launched the 182nd edition on 16 March 1998 at Claridge&#x27;s Hotel. It was written in English instead of French, as the editor felt that English was now the language of diplomacy. Charlotte Pike served as editor of the 1998 edition only and John Kennedy as managing director and publisher. The new publishers also revived the Committee of Patrons under the presidency of King Juan Carlos I of Spain and chairmanship of King Michael I of Romania. Upon his death, King Michael was succeeded by Albert II, Prince of Monaco.

The London publisher produced a further four editions of volume I (1999, 2000, 2003 and 2004), based on the 1998 edition, which included Europe&#x27;s and South America&#x27;s reigning, formerly reigning, and mediatised princely houses, and a single edition of volume II in 2001 edited by John Kennedy and Ghislain Crassard, which included other non-sovereign princely and ducal houses of Europe. A review in &quot;The Economist&quot; criticised the low editorial standards and attacked volume II for a lack of genealogical accuracy. A new edition of volume I was published in 2012 under the editorship of John James. A review in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; praised the 2012 volume I for a &quot;punctilious itemisation of titles, lineage and heraldry [aiming] for scholarship rather than sensation ...&quot;
Since 2022 the Italian publisher Ettore Gallelli, has published the Gotha Calendar in Italian.

==Structure==
As it was the practice of the diplomatic corps to employ official titles, to adhere to local precedence and etiquette, and to tender congratulations and condolences to members of the dynasty of the nation to which they were assigned, the almanac included a &quot;Calendrier des Diplomates&quot; (&quot;Diplomats&#x27; Calendar&quot;) section, which detailed major national holidays, anniversaries, ceremonies and royal birthdates.

Following World War I and the fall of many royal houses, fewer regulatory authorities remained to authenticate the use of titles; however the &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot; continued the practice of strict verification of information, requesting certified copies of letters patent, genealogies confirmed by competent authorities, documents, decrees and references for titles claimed. Europe&#x27;s middle and lower nobility (families whose principal title ranked below that of prince or duke — except mediatized families, listed in a section of their own) were not included in the almanac. Nor were the grandees or ducal families of Portugal and Spain (where titles, being transmissible through both male and female lines, were regularly inherited by descendants of non-patrilineal lineage). Families of some Italian and East European nations (e.g. Russia, Romania), where the princely title was claimed by many, were also incomplete. Yet the reigning, formerly reigning and noble families included in the almanac numbered in the hundreds by the time the almanac ceased publication in 1944.

In 1890 the almanac renamed II A to section II, and II B to section III. Dynasties reigning over non-European nations were listed in section I B. Families which became extinct were listed for the final time in the year following the death of the last member, male or female, and subsequent editions referred readers to that volume.

Families that ceased to be included for other reasons, such as lack of proof of a family&#x27;s legitimate descendants or discovery that it did not hold a valid princely or ducal title, were omitted from then on, but added, along with dates of previous insertion, to a list after the last section of each &quot;Annuaire Genealogique&quot; (Genealogical Yearbook), which page was entitled &quot;Liste des Maisons authrefois publiées dans la 3e partie de l&#x27;Almanach de Gotha&quot; (&quot;List of Houses formerly published in the 3rd section of the &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot;.&quot;)

From 1927, the almanac ceased to include all families in each year&#x27;s edition, and instead rotated entries every few years. Where titles and styles (such as Serene Highness) had ceased to be recognized by national governments (e.g. Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia), the almanac provided associated dates and details, but continued to attribute such titles and styles to individuals and families, consistent with its practice since the French Revolution; deposed sovereigns and dynasties continued to be accorded their former titles and rank, but dates of deposition were noted, and titles exclusively associated with sovereignty (e.g. emperor, queen, grand duke, crown princess) were not accorded to those who had not borne them during the monarchy. Titles of pretence below sovereign rank were accorded to members of formerly reigning dynasties as reported by heads of their houses, otherwise self-assumed titles were not used. The almanac included an explicit disclaimer announcing that known biographical details, such as birth dates and divorces, would not be suppressed.

<text>George Allen Russell (June 23, 1923 – July 27, 2009) was an American jazz pianist, composer, arranger and theorist. He is considered one of the first jazz musicians to contribute to general music theory with a theory of harmony based on jazz rather than European music, in his book &quot;Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization&quot; (1953).

==Early life==
Russell was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on June 23, 1923, to a white father and a black mother. He was adopted by a nurse and a chef on the B &amp; O Railroad, Bessie and Joseph Russell. Young Russell sang in the choir of the African Methodist Episcopal Church and listened to the Kentucky Riverboat music of Fate Marable. He made his stage debut at age seven, singing &quot;Moon Over Miami&quot; with Fats Waller.

Surrounded by the music of the black church and the big bands which played on the Ohio Riverboats, and with a father who was a music educator at Oberlin College, he began playing drums with the Boy Scouts and Bugle Corps, receiving a scholarship to Wilberforce University, where he joined the Collegians, a band noted as a breeding ground for jazz musicians including Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins, Charles Freeman Lee, Frank Foster, and Benny Carter. Russell served in that band at the same time as another noted jazz composer, Ernie Wilkins. When called up for the draft at the beginning of World War II, he was hospitalized with tuberculosis, during which he was taught the fundamentals of music theory by a fellow patient.

==Early career==
After his release from the hospital, he played drums with Benny Carter&#x27;s band, but decided to give up drumming as a vocation after hearing Max Roach, who replaced him in the orchestra. Inspired by hearing Thelonious Monk&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Round Midnight&quot;, Russell moved to New York in the early 1940s, where he became a member of a coterie of young innovators who frequented the apartment of Gil Evans on 14 West 55th Street, a clique which included Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, Gerry Mulligan, and John Lewis, later the music director of the Modern Jazz Quartet.

In 1945–46, Russell was again hospitalized for tuberculosis for 16 months. Forced to turn down work as Charlie Parker&#x27;s drummer, during that time he worked out the basic tenets of what was to become his Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization, a theory encompassing all of equal-tempered music which has been influential well beyond the boundaries of jazz. During this period he also studied composition with Stefan Wolpe. The first edition of his book was published by Russell in 1953, while he worked as a salesclerk at Macy&#x27;s. At that time, Russell&#x27;s ideas were a crucial step into the modal music of John Coltrane and Miles Davis on his classic recording, &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, and served as a beacon for other modernists such as Eric Dolphy and Art Farmer.

While working on the theory, Russell was also applying its principles to composition. His first famous composition was for the Dizzy Gillespie Orchestra, the two-part &quot;Cubano Be, Cubano Bop&quot; (1947), part of that band&#x27;s pioneering experiments in fusing bebop and Cuban jazz elements. &quot;A Bird in Igor&#x27;s Yard&quot; (a tribute to both Charlie Parker and Igor Stravinsky) was recorded in a session led by Buddy DeFranco the next year. Also, a lesser known but pivotal work arranged by Russell was recorded in January 1950 by Artie Shaw entitled &quot;Similau&quot; that employed techniques of both the works done for Gillespie and DeFranco.

Russell began playing piano, leading a series of groups which included Bill Evans, Art Farmer, Hal McKusick, Barry Galbraith, Milt Hinton, Paul Motian, and others. &quot;Jazz Workshop&quot; was his first album as leader, and one where he played relatively little, as opposed to masterminding the events (rather like his colleague Gil Evans).

In 1957, Russell was one of several composers commissioned by Brandeis University to write a piece for their jazz festival. He wrote a suite for orchestra, &quot;All About Rosie&quot;, which featured Bill Evans among other soloists, and has been cited as one of the few convincing examples of composed polyphony in jazz.

Members of the orchestra on his 1958 extended work, &quot;New York, N.Y.&quot;, included Bill Evans, John Coltrane, Art Farmer, Milt Hinton, Bob Brookmeyer, and Max Roach, among others, and featured wrap-around raps by singer/lyricist Jon Hendricks. &quot;Jazz in the Space Age&quot; (1960) was an even more ambitious big band album, featuring the unusual dual piano voicings of Bill Evans and Paul Bley. Russell formed his own sextet in which he played piano. Between 1960 and 1963, the Russell Sextet featured musicians like Dave Baker and Steve Swallow and memorable sessions with Eric Dolphy (on &quot;Ezz-thetics&quot;) and singer Sheila Jordan (their bleak version of &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; on &quot;The Outer View&quot; (1962) is highly regarded).

==Europe==
In 1964, Russell, who as a half black man was dismayed by race relations in the United States, moved to Scandinavia. He toured Europe with his sextet and lived in Scandinavia for five years, teaching at Lund University. In 1966, he was part of the first Pori Jazz festival. Through the early 1970s, Russell did most of his work in Norway and Sweden. He played there with young musicians who would go on to international fame: guitarist Terje Rypdal, saxophonist Jan Garbarek and drummer Jon Christensen.

This Scandinavian period also provided opportunities to write for larger groupings, and Russell&#x27;s larger-scale compositions of this time pursue his idea of &quot;vertical form&quot;, which he described as &quot;layers or strata of divergent modes of rhythmic behaviour&quot;. The &quot;Electronic Sonata for Souls Loved by Nature&quot;, commissioned by Bosse Broberg of Swedish Radio for the Radio Orchestra, was first recorded in 1968, as an extended work recorded with electronic tape. It continued Russell&#x27;s continuing exploration of new approaches and new instrumentation.

Russell returned to America in 1969, when Gunther Schuller assumed the presidency of the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston and appointed Russell to teach the Lydian Concept in the newly created jazz studies department, a position he held for many years. As Russell toured with his own groups, he was persistent in developing the Lydian Concept. He played the Bottom Line, Newport, Wolftrap, The Village Vanguard, Carnegie Hall, Sweet Basil and more with his 14-member orchestra.

==Later works==
In the 1970s Russell was commissioned to write and record three major works: &quot;Listen to the Silence&quot;, a mass for orchestra and chorus for the Norwegian Cultural Fund; &quot;Living Time&quot;, commissioned by Bill Evans for Columbia Records; and &quot;Vertical Form VI&quot; for the Swedish Radio.

With &quot;Living Time&quot; (1972), Russell reunited with Bill Evans to offer a suite of compositions which represent the stages of human life. His &quot;Live in an American Time Spiral&quot; featured many young New York players who would go on to greatness, including Tom Harrell and Ray Anderson. When he was able to form an orchestra for his 1985 work &quot;The African Game&quot;, he dubbed it the Living Time Orchestra. This 14-member ensemble toured Europe and the U.S., doing frequent weeks at the Village Vanguard, and was praised by &quot;New York magazine&quot; as &quot;the most exciting orchestra to hit the city in years.&quot;

The work &quot;The African Game&quot;, a 45-minute opus for 25 musicians, was described by Robert Palmer of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;one of the most important new releases of the past several decades&quot; and earned Russell two Grammy nominations in 1985.

Russell wrote 9 extended pieces after 1984, among them: &quot;Timeline&quot; for symphonic orchestra, jazz orchestra, chorus, klezmer band and soloists, composed for the New England Conservatory&#x27;s 125th anniversary; a re-orchestration of &quot;Living Time&quot; for Russell&#x27;s orchestra and additional musicians, commissioned by the Cité de la Musique in Paris in 1994; and &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;, co-commissioned by The Arts Council of England and the Swedish Concert Bureau in 1995.

In 1986, Russell toured with a group of American and British musicians, resulting in The International Living Time Orchestra. He played with Dave Bargeron, Steve Lodder, Tiger Okoshi, Mike Walker, Brad Hatfield, and Andy Sheppard.

==Music theory==
Russell&#x27;s &quot;Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization&quot; re-conceptualized the matching of scales with chords. While the conventional approach to the diatonic major scale is founded on the tones of the &quot;Ionian&quot; major scale in accordance with classical theory (C, D, E, F, G, A, B for the C major scale, etc.) the LCC derives the scales based on the series of fifths stacked from the root tones of chords with a major third. In the key of C, the stacked fifth series includes C, G, D, A, E, B, and F, which provide an alternate seven tone division for the C major scale with a raised, or &quot;augmented&quot;, fourth tone. The resulting scale, with an augmented fourth (F) instead of a perfect fourth (F), has more consonance than the conventional &quot;Ionian&quot; diatonic major scale over chords, avoiding the dissonant half-step from the major third (E). With the conventional major scale, dissonance is avoided by omitting the perfect fourth; by using the &quot;Lydian&quot; mode with the more consonant augmented fourth, the player or composer gains the tonal freedom that facilitates modal playing over chords with a major third. Lydian major-third chords are specified with a 11, which is equivalent to the 4 in the scale.

Miles Davis reportedly summarized the LCC succinctly by saying, &quot;F should be where middle C is on the piano&quot; [white notes: F-F = Lydian major, rather than Ionian major = C-C].

The Lydian Chromatic Concept was the first codified original theory to come from jazz. Musicians who assimilated Russell&#x27;s ideas expanded their harmonic language beyond that of bebop, into the realm of post-bop. Russell&#x27;s ideas influenced the development of modal jazz, notably in the album &quot;Jazz Workshop&quot; (1957, with Bill Evans and featuring the &quot;Concerto for Billy the Kid&quot;) as well as his writings. Miles Davis also pushed into modal playing with the composition &quot;Miles&quot; on his 1957 album &quot;Milestones&quot;. Davis and Evans later collaborated on the 1959 album &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, which featured modal composition and playing. John Coltrane explored modal playing for several years after playing on &quot;Kind of Blue.&quot;

His Lydian Concept has been described as making available resources rather than imposing constraints on musicians. According to the influential 20th century composer Toru Takemitsu, &quot;The Lydian Chromatic Concept is one of the two most splendid books about music; the other is My Musical Language by Messiaen. Though I&#x27;m considered a contemporary music composer, if I dare categorize myself as an artist, I&#x27;ve been strongly influenced by the Lydian Concept, which is not simply a musical method—we might call it a philosophy of music, or we might call it poetry.&quot;

The major scale probably emerged as the predominating scale of Western music, because within its seven tones lies the most fundamental harmonic progression of the classical era ... thus, the major scale &quot;resolves&quot; to its tonic major chord. The Lydian scale &quot;is&quot; the sound of its tonic major chord.

George Russell died of complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in Boston, Massachusetts, on July 27, 2009, according to his publicist.

==Awards==
He received a MacArthur Foundation &quot;genius&quot; grant in 1989. In his career, Russell also received the 1990 National Endowment for the Arts American Jazz Master Award, two Guggenheim Fellowships, and the British Jazz Award, among others. He has been elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, won the Oscar du Disque de Jazz Award, the Guardian Award, the American Music Award, six NEA Music Fellowships and numerous others. He taught throughout the world, and was a guest conductor for German, Italian, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, and Swedish radio groups.

<text>George William Russell (10 April 1867 – 17 July 1935), who wrote with the pseudonym Æ (often written AE or A.E.), was an Irish writer, editor, critic, poet, painter and Irish nationalist. He was also a writer on mysticism, and a central figure in the group of devotees of theosophy which met in Dublin for many years.

==Early life==
Russell was born in Lurgan, County Armagh (not in Portadown as has sometimes been misreported), in Ireland, the second son of Thomas Russell and Mary Armstrong. His father, the son of a small farmer, became an employee of Thomas Bell and Co., a prosperous firm of linen drapers. The family relocated to Dublin, where his father had a new offer of employment, when George was eleven years old. The death of his beloved sister Mary, aged 18, was a blow from which it took him a long time to recover.

He was educated at Rathmines School and the Metropolitan School of Art, where he began a lifelong, if sometimes contentious, friendship with W. B. Yeats. In the 1880s, Russell lived at the Theosophical Society lodge at 3, Upper Ely Place, sharing rooms with H. M. Magee, the brother of William Kirkpatrick Magee.

Russell started working as a draper&#x27;s clerk, then for many years worked for the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society (IAOS), an agricultural co-operative society initiated by Horace Plunkett in 1894. In 1897, Plunkett needed an able organiser and W. B. Yeats suggested Russell, who became Assistant Secretary of the IAOS.

==Family==
In 1898, he married Violet North; they had two surviving sons, Brian and Diarmuid, as well as a third son who died soon after birth. Frank O&#x27;Connor, who was a close friend of Russell in their later years, remarked that his family life was something of a mystery even to those who knew him best: O&#x27;Connor noticed that he never spoke about his wife and seemed to be at odds with his sons (although O&#x27;Connor himself liked both of them). While his marriage was rumoured to be unhappy, all his friends agreed that Violet&#x27;s death in 1932 was a great blow to Russell.

==Politician==

He was an able lieutenant to Plunkett, and travelled extensively throughout Ireland as a spokesman for the IAOS; he was mainly responsible for developing the credit societies and establishing Co-operative Banks in the south and west of the country, the numbers of which increased to 234 by 1910. Russell and Plunkett made a good team, with each gaining much from the association with the other.

As an officer of the IAOS, he could not express political opinions freely, but made no secret of the fact that he considered himself a Nationalist.

Russell supported the strikers during the Dublin Lockout, penning an open letter &#x27;To the Masters of Dublin&#x27; which was published in Irish newspapers on 7 October 1913. He praised the strikers in a speech at Albert Hall on 1 November as &quot;the true heroes of Ireland today, they are the descendants of Oscar, Cú Chulainn, the heroes of our ancient stories&quot;.

Russell definitely sympathized with the Easter Rising and saw it as in line with his views on Goidelic Nationalist &quot;traditional and natural communism&quot;, but due to his personal leanings toward pacifism, his individual involvement took the form of editing and writing rather than direct participation in the significantly violent activities that took place.


He was an independent delegate to the 1917–18 Irish Convention in which he opposed John Redmond&#x27;s compromise on Home Rule. He became involved in the anti-partition Irish Dominion League when Plunkett founded the body in 1919.

==Publisher==
Russell was editor (from 1905 to 1923) of the &quot;Irish Homestead&quot;, the journal of the IAOS. His gifts as a writer and publicist gained him a wide influence on the cause of agricultural cooperation. He then became editor of &quot;The Irish Statesman&quot;, the paper of the Irish Dominion League, which merged with the &quot;Irish Homestead&quot;, from 15 September 1923 until 12 April 1930.

With the demise of this newspaper, he was for the first time in his adult life without a job, and there were concerns that he could find himself in a state of poverty, as he had never earned very much money from his paintings or books. At one point his son Diarmuid was reduced to selling off early drafts of his father&#x27;s works to raise money, to the annoyance of Russell, who accused the lad, with whom his relations were not good, of &quot;raiding the wastepaper baskets&quot;.

Unbeknownst to him meetings and collections were organized and later that year at Plunkett House he was presented by Father T. Finlay with a cheque for £800. This enabled him to visit the United States the next year, where he was well received all over the country and his books sold in large numbers.

He used the pseudonym &quot;AE&quot;, or more properly, &quot;Æ&quot;. This derived from an earlier &quot;Æon&quot; signifying the lifelong quest of man, subsequently abbreviated.

==Writer, artist, patron==

His first book of poems, &quot;Homeward: Songs by the Way&quot; (1894), established him in what was known as the Irish Literary Revival, where Æ met the young James Joyce in 1902 and introduced him to other Irish literary figures, including William Butler Yeats. He appears as a character in the &quot;Scylla and Charybdis&quot; episode of Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, where he dismisses Stephen&#x27;s theories on Shakespeare. Dedalus borrows money from him and then remarks: &quot;A.E.I.O.U.&quot; His collected poems were published in 1913, with a second edition in 1926.

He designed the famous Starry Plough flag for the Irish Citizen Army which was unveiled on 5 April 1914 and flown during the Easter Rising.

His house at 17 Rathgar Avenue in Dublin became a meeting-place at the time for everyone interested in the economic and artistic future of Ireland: his Sunday evenings &quot;at home&quot; were a notable feature of Dublin literary life. Michael Collins, the effective leader of the new Government, became acquainted with Russell in the last months of his life: Oliver St. John Gogarty, a regular guest at Russell&#x27;s Sundays &quot;at home&quot; believed that these two men, so utterly unalike in most ways, nonetheless developed a deep mutual respect.

Russell&#x27;s generosity and hospitality were legendary: Frank O&#x27;Connor fondly recalled &quot;the warmth and kindness, which enfolded you like an old fur coat&quot;. He was the most loyal of friends, and in the notoriously fractious Dublin literary world Russell tried to keep the peace between his endlessly quarrelling colleagues: even the abrasive Seamus O&#x27;Sullivan could be forgiven a great deal, simply because &quot;Seamus drinks too much&quot;. His interests were wide-ranging; he became a theosophist and wrote extensively on politics and economics, while continuing to paint and write poetry. Æ claimed to be a clairvoyant, able to view various kinds of spiritual beings, which he illustrated in paintings and drawings.

He was noted for his exceptional kindness and generosity towards younger writers: Frank O&#x27;Connor termed him &quot;the man who was the father to three generations of Irish writers&quot;, and Patrick Kavanagh called him &quot;a great and holy man&quot;. P. L. Travers, famous as the creator of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, was yet another writer who gratefully recalled Russell&#x27;s help and encouragement. He features, scandalously, in Chapter 13 of Anthony Burgess&#x27; novel &quot;Earthly Powers&quot;.

== Visions and beliefs ==
George reported seeing visions since when he was a young man, including one in which it was revealed to him a new name: Aeon, which he would only later find meaning in quotes he was unaware of. In another one, as described in &quot;Song and its Fountains&quot;:

Earth revealed itself to me as a living being, and rock and clay were made transparent so that I saw lovelier and lordlier beings than I had known before, and was made partner in memory of mighty things, happenings in ages long sunken behind time.

The visions intensified at age 17, around the time he began his friendship with Yeats. As he writes in &quot;The Candle of the Vision&quot;:

But the luminous quality gradually became normal in me, and at times in meditation there broke in on me an almost intolerable lustre of light, pure and shining faces, dazzling processions of figures, most ancient, ancient places and peoples, and landscapes lovely as the lost Eden. These appeared at first to have no more relation to myself than images from a street without one sees reflected in a glass; but at times meditation prolonged itself into spheres which were radiant with actuality.

While students, he and Yeats were members of the Hermetic Society founded by Charles Johnston and were interested in Theosophy. Johnston founded the Dublin Lodge of the Theosophical Society in 1886, and Russell would become a member of it in 1890. In &quot;Song and its Fountains&quot;, he speculates on the nature of the soul based on his experiences:

Looking back on the past I have a vivid sense of a being seeking reincarnation here, beginning with those faint first intuitions of beauty, and those early dreamings which were its forerunners. It was no angelic thing, pure and new from a foundry of souls, which sought embodiment, but a being stained with the dust and conflict of a long travel through time, carrying with it unsated desires, base and august and as I divined it, myriads of perceptions and a secret wisdom. It was not simple but infinitely complex, as a being must be which has been in many worlds and all it had experienced has become part of it.  If there was an original purity of being it had become corrupted, yet not altogether for there was in it, I believe, some incorruptible spiritual atom, carrying with it maybe some perception of its journeyings with deity.  It had worshipped in many houses of prayer and kept the reverence it had paid and had been in many a gay and many a ruined heart. Out of ancient happiness it could build intoxicating images of life, and out of ancient sorrows it could evoke a desolating wisdom that would crucify the infant joy ere it could run to its light.

He gave various explanations for his visionary memories: they could be from past lives; modified memories; symbolic dreams; moments experienced by other beings who had some affinity with him; Akashic records (according to his belief in the Theosophist doctrine); telepathy and visions of remote places. He claimed that all these occurred to him, and that he could distinguish them by certain signs. He also believed that the deities of all civilizations were archetypes or thought-forms created by the collective mind, but relatively real, and he had visions of some in Ireland:

apparitions of light taller than human, riding on winged horses, or shining musicians circled by dazzling birds, or queens bearing branches with blossoms of light or fruit from the world of immortal youth, all moving in a divine aether. These were messengers of the gods and through these came about that marriage of Heaven and Earth in our literature which made it for long centuries seem almost the utterance of a single voice. These divine visitations have been the dominant influence in our literature so that our poets have sung of their country as the shadow of Heaven.

He claimed to see nature spirits and made paintings about them, such as the sídhe, elven or faerie beings in Irish folklore. On one occasion, he showed some drawings he had made of them to a peasant, who would have pointed out that he had already seen many of those entities. In 1889 he had traveled with W. B. Yeats to a town in County Galway, where Russell also painted these spirit beings, and a Druid is said to have appeared to them in vision. The previous year, in a letter to Yeats, Russell had stated:

The gods have returned to Erin and have centred themselves in the sacred mountains and blow the fires through the country. They have been seen by several in vision, they will awaken the magical instinct everywhere, and the universal heart of the people will turn to the old druidic beliefs. I note through the country the increased faith in faery things. The bells are heard from the mounds and sounding in the hollows of the mountains. A purple sheen in the inner air, perceptible at times in the light of day, spreads itself over the mountains. All this I can add my own testimony to. Furthermore, we were told that though now few we would soon be many, and that a branch of the school for the revival of the ancient mysteries to teach real things would be formed here soon. Out of Ireland will arise a light to transform many ages and peoples. There is a hurrying of forces and swift things going out and I believe profoundly that a new Avatar is about to appear and in all spheres the forerunners go before him to prepare. It will be one of the kingly Avatars, who is at once ruler of men and magic sage. I had a vision of him some months ago and will know him if he appears.
George told friends of glimpses of past existences he had had, in Assyria, Pre-Columbian America, as a contemporary of William Blake and also, as he told Lady Constance Sitwell, of &quot;brief but very vivid, of Druidic times in Ireland; of a Spanish life―riding into a walled town and fighting; one Egyptian period, and very, very far back, a life in India&quot;. In a conversation with Julian Huxley, he asked him about where his memories would have come from, and the biologist did not know how to respond to his argument.

About dreams, he states that Freud&#x27;s interpretation &quot;throws no light upon the architect of the dream&quot; and considers that there is a Consciousness that transcends wakefulness and sleep, which is responsible for the rapid creation of dreams.

when our lamp is lit, we find the house of our being has many chambers, and creatures live there who come and go, and we must ask whether they have the right to be in our house; and there are corridors there leading into the hearts of others, and windows which open into eternity, and we hardly can tell where our own being ends and another begins, or if there is any end to our being. If we brood with love upon this myriad unity, following the meditation ordained by Buddha for the brothers of his order, to let our minds pervade the whole wide world with heart of love, we come more and more to permeate, or to be pervaded by the lives of others. We are haunted by unknown comrades in many moods, whose naked souls pass through ours, and reveal themselves to us in an unforgettable instant, and we know them as we hardly know those who are the daily comrades of our heart, who, however intimate, are hidden from us by the husk of the body. As the inner life grows richer we beget more of these affinities.

The &quot;Candle of the Light&quot; is an autobiography in which he gives insight into his personal mysticism, without reference to other religious writers or Theosophist sources. It also contains a chapter on Celtic cosmogenesis.

== Last years and death ==
Russell, who had become increasingly unhappy in the Irish Free State (which according to Yeats he called &quot;a country given over to the Devil&quot;), moved to England soon after his wife&#x27;s death in 1932. Despite his failing health he went on a final lecture tour in the United States, but returned home utterly exhausted. He died of cancer in Bournemouth in 1935.

His body was brought back to Ireland and interred in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Dublin.

<doc id="747736" wikidata="Q240672" url="?curid=747736" title="Sue Bird">
<text>Suzanne Brigit Bird (born October 16, 1980) is an American former professional basketball player who played her entire career with the Seattle Storm of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). Bird was drafted first overall pick by the Storm in the 2002 WNBA draft and is considered one of the greatest players in WNBA history. As of 2024, Bird is the only WNBA player to win titles in three different decades. She held a front office position for the NBA&#x27;s Denver Nuggets as their Basketball Operations Associate. She has also played for three teams in the Russian league and holds dual citizenship with both U.S. and Israel.

In high school, Bird was the New York State Player of the Year, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; Player of the Year, and a WBCA All-American. In her senior year on the undefeated University of Connecticut team in 2002, she won the Wade Trophy and the Naismith Award as College Player of the Year. She finished her University of Connecticut (UConn) career ranked first in three-point field goal percentage and free throw percentage, and second in assists and steals. She won the Nancy Lieberman Award three times as the top point guard in the nation. Additionally, Bird led her UConn team to a record of 114–4.

Bird has won a joint-record four WNBA championships with the Storm (2004, 2010, 2018, 2020), a historic five Olympic gold medals (2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020), two NCAA Championships with UConn (2000, 2002); and four FIBA World Cups (2002, 2010, 2014, 2018). She is one of only 11 women to attain all four accolades. She is also a five-time EuroLeague Women champion (2007–2010, 2013). During her WNBA career, she has been selected to thirteen WNBA All-Star teams and eight All-WNBA teams. Additionally, she was voted by fans as one of the WNBA&#x27;s Top 15 Players of All Time in 2011, was voted into the WNBA Top 20@20 as one of the league&#x27;s top 20 players of all time in 2016, and was voted into The W25 as one of the league&#x27;s top 25 players of all time in 2021. Her fifth Olympic gold medal, at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, makes her one of only two Olympic basketball players—of either gender—ever to win five gold medals, with the other player being her US Olympic teammate Diana Taurasi.

Bird publicly confirmed on June 16, 2022, that she would retire from playing professional basketball after the 2022 WNBA season. Her season ended on September 7, 2022, with the Storm&#x27;s playoff loss to the Las Vegas Aces.

==Early life==
Bird was born in Syosset, New York, on Long Island, to Herschel and Nancy Bird. She has one sibling, an older sister named Jen. Her father&#x27;s ancestry is Russian-Jewish. In the 1900s, Bird&#x27;s paternal grandparents immigrated to the United States from what later became Ukraine. Upon her grandfather&#x27;s arrival at Ellis Island in New York, their original last name was switched from &quot;Boorda&quot; to &quot;Bird&quot;. To avoid European rules, which state that European basketball teams can only have two Americans, Bird obtained Israeli citizenship due to her Jewish father and paternal grandparents. However, she represents the United States, her birth country, in international competitions.

Bird was interested in sports from an early age, partly influenced by her athletic older sister. Besides basketball, she played soccer and tennis and ran track. Her fifth-grade yearbook lists her potential future careers as a lawyer, doctor, and professional soccer player. Bird started playing Amateur Athletic Union basketball in the sixth grade. At only 11 years old, she played during halftime of a St. John&#x27;s basketball game; her play was so impressive that a security guard asked for her autograph.

==High school==
Bird played her freshman and sophomore years at Syosset High School, but wanted more competition. Consequently, she enrolled at Christ the King Regional High School in Queens, New York. Bird spent two seasons at Christ the King, where she competed on their Lady Royals basketball team. The Royals record was 24–3 in her junior year. In the second season, her team finished undefeated and won the New York state championship, and the national title. Bird won many awards, including the New York State Player of the Year and the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; Player of the Year. She was named a WBCA All-American. She participated in the Women&#x27;s Basketball Coaches Association High School All-America Game, scoring 11 points.

==College career==
Bird was recruited by several university teams, including UConn, Stanford, and Vanderbilt. She leaned towards selecting the UConn Huskies, but hesitated when two point guards announced their commitments to the team. After one of the point guards withdrew her commitment, Bird decided to accept UConn&#x27;s offer. In addition, she favored UConn because it was close to her home and had increased playing opportunities. Eight games into her freshman season, Bird suffered a torn ACL. Since she had played more than 20% of the team&#x27;s games in the 1998–1999 season, she was not able to redshirt. In her sophomore season (1999–2000), she returned to lead the team to a 36–1 record, the Big East Championship, and the 2000 NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament. In her junior season (2000–2001), the Huskies went 32–3, with the final loss coming against UConn&#x27;s Big East rival Notre Dame in the Final Four. However, the Huskies went 39–0 in her senior season (2001–2002), and, subsequently, Bird won the Wade Trophy, Honda Sports Award and Naismith Award as College Player of the Year.

During her junior year, Bird played in a game against Notre Dame which sportswriter Jeff Goldberg referred to as &quot;the best women&#x27;s basketball game ever played&quot;. Goldberg memorialized the game in his book &quot;Bird at the Buzzer&quot;, describing how Bird took the eponymous shot at the buzzer to win the game.

She finished her UConn career on many of the record lists. she ranked No. 24 on the 1,000-point list with 1,378 points, No. 2 in assists with 585, and seventh with 243 steals. She ranked number 1 in three-point field goal percentage (45.9) and free throw percentage (89.2). She won two National Championships, three Big East Championships, and Big East regular season titles. Bird was the first winner of the Nancy Lieberman Award in 2000, given to the top point guard in the nation, and won it again in 2001 and 2002. Her record at UConn in games she played is 114–4. Bird was a member of the inaugural class (2006) of inductees to the University of Connecticut women&#x27;s basketball &quot;Huskies of Honor&quot; recognition program.

==Professional career==

===WNBA===

The Seattle Storm selected Bird with the first overall pick of the 2002 WNBA draft. She would play alongside superstar Lauren Jackson who was also drafted first overall the year before. In her rookie season, Bird started all 32 games for the Storm and averaged 14.4 ppg. She was selected as a starter on the 2002 WNBA Western Conference All-Star team. Bird was the runner-up for the Rookie of the Year award and one of only two rookies to make the All-WNBA First Team. Both Bird and Jackson led the Storm to their first playoff appearance. During her first year in the league, Bird scored a career-high 33 points in a regular-season game against the Portland Fire. From 2002 (rookie season) to 2022 (retirement), she made a record 13 appearances playing in the Western Conference All-Star team.

In 2004, the Storm acquired shooting guard Betty Lennox in a dispersal draft, joining Bird and Lauren Jackson to form a dominant trio of star players that helped lead the Storm to its first WNBA Championship. With the WNBA Championship win, Bird became one of 11 women to receive an Olympic gold medal, an NCAA Championship, Fiba World Cup gold, and a WNBA Championship. The others are Sheryl Swoopes, Cynthia Cooper-Dyke, Tamika Catchings, Brittney Griner and fellow Huskies Swin Cash, Kara Wolters, Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore, Breanna Stewart, and Asjha Jones.

En route to the Storm&#x27;s second championship, Bird had one of the most clutch moments in WNBA Playoff history; during the Conference Finals against the championship-defending Phoenix Mercury with the Storm up 1–0 in the series, Bird hit a game-winning three-pointer with two seconds left in Game 2 to put the Storm up 91–88, after erasing a 19-point deficit to advance to the 2010 WNBA Finals. Also in Game 1 of the 2010 WNBA Finals, Bird hit a game-winning jump shot with 2 seconds left to put the Storm up 79–77 and would later sweep the series. In 2011, she was voted one of the WNBA&#x27;s Top 15 Players of All Time by current players and coaches, the media, and fans on the WNBA website.

During the 2012 WNBA season, Bird experienced knee problems, yet she managed to play 29 games throughout the regular season and the playoffs. In the off-season, Bird had knee surgery, which would prevent her from playing the entire 2013 season.

Bird returned for the 2014 WNBA season. That year, she played 33 games, averaged 10.6 ppg and 4.0 apg, and was voted as a WNBA all-star. However, the Storm did not make it to the 2014 playoffs and would also fail to do so the following year.

On February 16, 2016, Bird re-signed with the Storm to a multi-year deal in free agency.

In the 2016 season, Bird would have a resurgence, putting up her best numbers since coming back from knee surgery. She averaged 12.8 ppg while shooting a career-high in 3-point field goal percentage and led the league in assists with 5.8 apg. For the fifth time in her career and the first time in 12 years, Bird was named to the All-WNBA First Team. Prior to the season, the Storm selected Breanna Stewart first overall in the 2016 WNBA draft, their second number one overall pick in a row after drafting Jewell Loyd the year before. With the addition of Stewart and Loyd quickly developing into a star player, the Storm made it back to the playoffs for the first time in 3 years with a 16–18 record. With the WNBA&#x27;s new playoff format in effect, the Storm were the number 7 seed in the league and faced the Atlanta Dream in the first round, losing the single elimination game 94–85. Bird was also listed in the WNBA Top 20@20, a list of the league&#x27;s best 20 players ever in celebration of the WNBA&#x27;s twentieth anniversary.

In April 2017, Bird underwent left knee surgery, which caused her to miss training camp. However, she returned on May 21, 2017, following her recovery and made her season debut, making her both the oldest active player and starter in the WNBA. She scored 9 points and 10 assists in an 81–71 victory over the Washington Mystics. On June 11, 2017, Bird scored a season-high 21 points and 10 assists in a 94–86 loss to the New York Liberty. She was voted into the 2017 WNBA All-Star Game, making it her 10th all-star game appearance (tying Tamika Catchings for most all-star game appearances). Bird had set the All-Star Game record for assists with a performance of 8 points and 11 assists for the Western Conference All-Stars team in a 130–121 victory. On September 1, 2017, Bird became the WNBA all-time leader in assists with a career total of 2,600 assists, passing Ticha Penicheiro in a 110–106 overtime loss to the Washington Mystics. She finished the game with 19 points and a season-high 13 assists. Bird would finish off the 2017 season, averaging a career-high in assists per game as the Storm finished 14–19 with the 8th seed in the league. The Storm would lose 79–69 to the Phoenix Mercury in the first-round elimination game.

On July 8, 2018, Bird scored a season-high 21 points in a 97–91 victory over the Washington Mystics. During that game, she became the Storm&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, passing Lauren Jackson&#x27;s 6,007 points. On July 19, 2018, Bird was voted into the 2018 WNBA All-Star Game, passing Tamika Catchings for most all-star appearances. On July 22, 2018, Bird broke yet another record, this time for the most WNBA regular-season games played after she passed Delisha Milton-Jones by playing her 500th game against the Atlanta Dream. By the end of the season, Bird finished with a career-high in assists, field goal shooting, and a new career-high in three-point shooting percentage as the Storm finished as the number 1 seed in the league with a 26–8 record, receiving a double-bye to the semi-finals and home court advantage throughout the playoffs. In the semi-finals, the Storm defeated the Phoenix Mercury in a hard-fought five-game series. The Storm had a 2–0 lead, lost two in a row, and finished the series with a win in game 5 at home. Bird scored a season-high 22 points in game 5. With that win, the Storm would advance to the WNBA Finals for the first time since 2010. They would sweep the Washington Mystics in the Finals, winning their first championship in 8 years.

In August 2018, Sue Bird became vice president of the WNBA players union. During her term, Bird was a part of the leadership that navigated the WNBA during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and negotiated with the league on how to play the game safely with other teams. As the MNBA worked on the players&#x27; contracts, they were united in prioritizing activism and listed their use of social justice messages during games as a top &quot;nonnegotiable&quot;. Consequently, Bird&#x27;s presidency is credited with the WNBA allowing the players to express social justice messages, for example, on jerseys, basketball courts, and immediate floors.

In May 2019, Bird needed arthroscopic surgery on her left knee and could not play in either of the Storm&#x27;s preseason games. She underwent surgery on May 30, missing the remainder of the 2019 season as she recovered. Another key player for the Storm, Breanna Stewart, also missed the 2019 season due to injuries. The Storm still secured a playoff berth, winning their Round 1 matchup of the playoffs without Bird and Stewart. The team, however, was eliminated in the second-round elimination game by the Los Angeles Sparks.

In 2020, Bird returned to play, limited to playing 11 games in the regular season. Due to the pandemic, the season was delayed and shortened to 22 games, with all activities occurring at the IMG Academy in the wubble, the contained Academy area. She had reaggravated her knee during the season, causing her to miss five games. With an active roster, the Storm finished 18–4 with the number 2 seed, receiving a double bye to the semi-finals. In the semi-finals, they would sweep the Minnesota Lynx in three games, advancing back to the WNBA Finals for the second time in three years. In the Finals, the Storm would win the championship after defeating the Las Vegas Aces in a three-game sweep, earning Bird her fourth WNBA championship, making her the first player in WNBA history to win a championship in three different decades.

In 2021, Bird re-signed with the Storm on a one-year deal, which allowed her to play her 18th season in the league, moving her past Milton-Jones for most seasons played in the WNBA. During a game against the Los Angeles Sparks in July 2021, Bird surpassed Katie Smith&#x27;s 6452 career points on the WNBA career scoring list with her first three-pointer, ending the game with 6490 points. She was honored in The W25 list, the WNBA&#x27;s official list recognizing &quot;the 25 greatest and most influential players in WNBA history&quot;, selected to commemorate the league&#x27;s 25th season (2021).

On June 16, 2022, Bird announced that she would be retiring following the 2022 WNBA season.

On July 23, 2023, Bird&#x27;s number 10 jersey was retired by the Seattle Storm during a ceremony at Climate Pledge Arena and attended by team owners and former teammates Swin Cash and Lauren Jackson.

===Overseas===
In the 2004–05 WNBA off-season, she played in Russia with Storm teammate Kamila Vodichkova on the Dynamo Moscow. In the 2005–06 WNBA off-season, she played on the same team, reaching the Russian championship and the Euroleague women&#x27;s playoffs.

In the 2006–07 WNBA off-season, she joined Storm teammate Lauren Jackson and fellow UConn stars Diana Taurasi and Svetlana Abrosimova on the Russian team Sparta&amp;K to win both the Russian Super League and the EuroLeague Women championships. Bird would keep playing with the team for the next four WNBA off-seasons.

From 2011 to 2014, Bird played three off-seasons for UMMC Ekaterinburg in the Russian League, adding three more consecutive championships in the Russian league.

==National team career==
Bird has competed with USA Basketball as a member of the 2000 Jones Cup Team in Taipei, Taiwan. She started all four games, leading the team with 17 assists and helping them to the gold medal.

In 2002, Bird was named to the national team which competed in the World Championships in Zhangjiagang, Changzhou, and Nanjing, China. The team was coached by Van Chancellor. Bird scored 4.3 points per game. The USA team won all nine games, including a close title game against Russia, which was a one-point game late in the game.

In the 2003–2004 off-season, Bird was named to the United States 2004 Women&#x27;s Olympic Basketball Team&#x27;s roster. The USA team went on to win the gold at the games in Athens, Greece.

In 2006, Bird was invited back to the National team for the World Championships held in Sao Paulo, Brazil in September 2006. With Lisa Leslie and Dawn Staley retiring and Sheryl Swoopes sidelined by injuries, Bird, Candace Parker, and Diana Taurasi stepped up to leading roles on the national team. The USA team won eight of the nine games they played but fell against Russia 75–68 in the medal round; they ended up with the bronze medal. Over the nine games, Bird hit 50% of her three-point attempts, tying her for accuracy leadership with Taurasi and Swoopes. She also led the team with 41 assists.

In the summer of 2008, Bird once again qualified for the Olympic basketball team, which won the 2008 gold medal in Beijing, China. Bird started all eight games and tied with teammate Tamika Catchings with 14 steals, both ranking seventh in the tournament&#x27;s top 10 for steals.

Bird was invited to the USA Basketball Women&#x27;s National Team training camp for the 2010 World Championship in the fall of 2009. Usually, players for the 2010 USA FIBA World Championship and the 2012 Olympics teams are selected from the National Team. Following the training camp, the team was scheduled to play in the 2009 UMMC Ekaterinburg International Invitational in Ekaterinburg, Russia.

On July 10, 2010, Bird competed with the National team in the WNBA-sponsored All-Star game, which pitted the USA National team against the &quot;best-of-the-best&quot; WNBA All-Stars. In non-Olympic seasons, the WNBA normally holds the annual All-Star game between top players in the Eastern and Western Conferences. University of Connecticut head coach Geno Auriemma coached the National team in this game, training camp, and through 2012. Team USA won the exhibition game 99–72, with players like Bird, who subsequently qualified for the USA team competing in the FIBA World Championships in the Czech Republic, held in September and October 2010.

Because many team members were still playing in the WNBA until just before the World Cup, the USA World team had only one day of practice with the entire 12-member squad before they opened play in Ostrava, Czech Republic. Even with limited practice, the team won its first game against Greece by 26 points. They continued to dominate with victory margins exceeding 20 points in the first five games. Several players shared scoring honors, with Swin Cash, Angel McCoughtry, Maya Moore, Diana Taurasi, Lindsay Whalen, and Sylvia Fowles all ending as high scorers in the first few games. USA&#x27;s sixth game was against undefeated Australia. They took a 24-point lead and ultimately prevailed with an 83–75 victory. Team USA won its next two games by over 30 points, then faced the host team, the Czech Republic, in the championship game. They had only a five-point lead at halftime, which was cut to three points, but the Czechs never got closer. Team USA went on to win the championship and gold medal. Bird averaged 5.6 points per game and led the team in assists with 26.

Bird competed for the U.S. in the 2012 Summer Olympics. The Americans won their fifth straight gold medal.

In 2014, Bird played for Team USA during the 2014 FIBA World Championship for Women, in which they defeated Spain 77–64 to win the gold medal.

Bird competed for Team USA in the 2016 Summer Olympics, helping the team win its sixth straight gold medal. In the gold medal game, they beat Spain 101–72. This was Bird&#x27;s fourth Olympic title.

In 2018, Bird once again qualified for Team USA during the 2018 FIBA Women&#x27;s Basketball World Cup held in Spain. USA defeated Australia 73–56 to win the gold medal. By winning the gold medal, Bird became the only player in history, male or female, to win four World Cup gold medals. Bird finished the final with five assists, bringing her career total to 107 assists in the FIBA World Cup—making her the leader for the U.S. with the most assists at the World Cup.

On July 23, 2021, in the lead-up to her quest for her fifth gold medal, Bird carried the U.S. flag at the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Summer Olympics. Bird and baseball player Eddy Alvarez were selected by fellow athletes to be the flag bearers. Bird described the honor as &quot;mind-blowing&quot;. The Games were delayed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Personal life==
Bird publicly came out as a lesbian on July 20, 2017, revealing that she had been dating soccer player Megan Rapinoe for several months after the two met at the 2016 Rio Olympics. In 2018, she and Rapinoe became the first same-sex couple on the cover of &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot;″s &quot;Body Issue&quot;. They announced their engagement on October 30, 2020.

In 2020, Bird and Rapinoe were the first LGBTQ+ couple to co-host the ESPYs. She was included in the 2022 Queer 50 list.

In 2022, Bird became a part-owner of National Women&#x27;s Soccer League franchise NJ/NY Gotham FC as a minority investor in the club. Along with her investment, Bird is required to be an advisor to the league, assisting to promote the club at all market levels—local, national, and international. She also joined the ownership group of the Seattle Storm, Force 10 Hoops, in 2024. On July 16th, 2024, Mattel announced a Sue Bird Barbie as part of their 65th anniversary of the Barbie doll.

<text>Daniel John Bedingfield (born 3 December 1979) is a New Zealand-British singer, songwriter, record producer and actor. His debut studio album, &quot;Gotta Get thru This&quot; (2002), spawned three UK number ones, &quot;Gotta Get thru This&quot;, &quot;If You&#x27;re Not the One&quot; and &quot;Never Gonna Leave Your Side&quot;, and sold 1.6 million copies in that country. His second album, &quot;Second First Impression&quot;, was released in 2004. Bedingfield was a judge on &quot;The X Factor New Zealand&quot; in 2013. He has written songs for other artists and has acted in the West End theatre in London, UK.

==Early life==
Bedingfield was born in Auckland, New Zealand, and attended Lynfield College. He is the elder brother of fellow singers Natasha Bedingfield and Nikola Rachelle.

==Music career==
===2001–2003: &quot;Gotta Get Thru This&quot; and international breakthrough===
He released his first single, &quot;Gotta Get Thru This&quot; in November 2001. It gathered momentum on white label records through the UK garage music scene, and peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart. He has since had two more number-one singles on the chart, &quot;If You&#x27;re Not the One&quot; and &quot;Never Gonna Leave Your Side&quot;, as well as three further top ten hits. His debut album, also titled &quot;Gotta Get Thru This&quot;, which was recorded at home using Making Waves Audio software and Reason, peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart and went on to sell more than 4 million copies worldwide.

===2004–2011: &quot;Second First Impression&quot; and other projects===
In 2004, Bedingfield won a BRIT Award for Best British Male Artist. He then moved to the Universal Music subsidiary label Polydor Records to release his second album, &quot;Second First Impression&quot;, which reached number 8 in the UK. The album sold poorly compared to his first offering, though it did include two UK Top 20 singles, &quot;Nothing Hurts Like Love&quot; (which reached number three) and &quot;Wrap My Words Around You&quot; (which peaked at number 12). The third and final single, &quot;The Way&quot;, became his first to miss the top 40, reaching number 41. The album was also released in Singapore (featuring &#x27;If You&#x27;re Not The One&#x27; as a bonus track).

In an interview with the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; in April 2007, Bedingfield said that, after a four-year hiatus, he had three albums recorded and awaiting release.

Since his last release in 2004, Bedingfield continued to work with other artists. He co-wrote the song &quot;Works for Me!&quot; for &quot;American Idol&quot; finalist David Archuleta. He has also worked with Pixie Lott, and contributed guest vocals on a track by a former member of The Roots. In December 2009, he co-wrote material with Tessanne Chin as well as recorded three songs with Busy Signal at DJ Karim&#x27;s Stainless Records studios in Kingston, Jamaica. Bedingfield provided backing vocals for the Kirsten Morrell track &quot;He Walked In&quot; from the album &quot;Ultraviolet&quot;, which was released in May 2010. In December 2010, Bedingfield spent a month in Tel Aviv, Israel, where he wrote and recorded a song with a local freak folk band, The Raw Men Empire. He concluded his visit with a Tel Aviv gig, hosting Uzi Feinerman, The Raw Men Empire and a variety of other Israeli musicians. In July 2011, he recorded on a dancehall riddim called the Overproof Riddim. Like many of the songs on this riddim, it has been getting good rotation in Jamaica.

===2012–2016: &quot;Stop the Traffik&quot;, &quot;The X Factor&quot; and acting===
In February 2012, Bedingfield released the single &quot;Rocks Off&quot; with an accompanying video on MTV which can be viewed here. &quot;Rocks Off&quot; was released alongside B-side &quot;It&#x27;s Not Me, It&#x27;s You&quot;. On 24 April, Bedingfield released the EP &quot;Stop the Traffik – Secret Fear&quot;, his first EP release since becoming independent. The EP featured both the previously released &quot;Rocks Off&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Not Me, Its You&quot; as well as five other new tracks. The EP was followed by the release of &quot;Secret Fear&quot; as a single, the video features adult scenes and has gone on to win several awards.
On 21 December 2012, Bedingfield took up a role as a judge for the first New Zealand series of &quot;The X Factor&quot; joining Stan Walker, Melanie Blatt and Ruby Frost. The series premiered on TV3 on 21 April 2013. Bedingfield mentored the Girls category. His sister Natasha appeared as an assistant during the Judges Retreats round. Bedingfield was the winning mentor of series one when his act Jackie Thomas won the competition.

In August 2013, Bedingfield was a judge on the one-off television special X Factor Around the World, alongside Paula Abdul, Louis Walsh, Anggun and Ahmad Dhani. He also performed two of his songs (&quot;If You&#x27;re Not the One&quot; and &quot;Every Little Thing&quot;) on the show.

Bedingfield co-wrote &quot;I Wanna Feel&quot; by SecondCity, which debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on 1 June 2014 and stayed in the top 20 for the next six weeks. The song was Bedingfield&#x27;s fourth number one in the UK. He spent time working in the studio with K-pop group Spica, including co-producing their first English language single &quot;I Did It&quot;. He was also the group&#x27;s vocal director. In 2015, he co-wrote the song &quot;Testify&quot; which was included on &quot;The X Factor UK&quot; 2014 winner Ben Haenow&#x27;s self-titled debut studio album.

From February 2016 until April 2016, Bedingfield appeared in the West End musical &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; as The Artilleryman.

===2024–present: Touring===
In January 2024, Bedingfield announced a UK tour for April 2024.

==Personal life==
While on holiday visiting his parents in New Zealand in 2004, Bedingfield nearly died in a serious car accident, which left him with severe head and neck injuries because of the car rolling on him. 

Bedingfield is autistic. In 2024, he came out as queer.

His mother, Molly Bedingfield, is founder and CEO of Global Angels, for which Daniel is doing fundraising work. Bedingfield also helped to launch the Stop the Traffik coalition against modern day slavery.

<text>The [[GAZ]]-51 (Russian: ГАЗ-51) is a light truck manufactured by the Soviet vehicle manufacturer Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod. The vehicle was designed before the Second World War and mass-produced together with the all-wheel-drive version GAZ-63 after the end of the war. Under the designation GAZ-93, a tipper was produced on the basis of the GAZ-51.

The GAZ-51 was a 4x2 2.5 ton truck while the GAZ-63 had all-wheel drive.

== History ==

The ideas for the development of the GAZ-51 date back to the mid-1930s. The GAZ-AA proved to be increasingly outdated, even by Soviet standards. The American model, the Ford AA, had already been taken out of production in 1931. Accordingly, the GAZ-11-51 was designed from February 1937, a light truck with a more powerful engine and a completely revised cab. The latter was visually similar to that of the UralZIS-355M, which was produced later.

The installed six-cylinder gasoline engine was a copy of the Chrysler flathead engine as used in the Dodge D5 passenger car. As early as 1936, the Soviet Union had bought a large quantity of these engines in order to replicate them. Production began at GAZ in 1937 under the name GAZ-11. Before the war, it was initially only installed in passenger cars, for example in the GAZ-11-73 and the GAZ-61. It was not until after the war that it was also used in production trucks – as originally planned.

By 1939, two prototypes of the GAZ-11-51 had been completed. Due to the war, work on the project was interrupted and not resumed until 1943. Further prototypes were built, incorporating many components from the Studebaker US6, which proved very reliable and durable when in service with the Soviet army. In June 1945, pre-series production began. On July 19, 1945, a presentation took place in the Moscow Kremlin, after which large-scale production was approved. This began on January 6, 1946. Models from this early stage can be recognized by the fact that the side windows do not yet have the rounded upper edge that would later be typical.

From 1955, the modernized version GAZ-51A was produced. In the summer of 1957, Molotov&#x27;s name was deleted from the factory name, which was reflected in the fact that &quot;Gorkovsky Avtozavod&quot; (Горьковский автозавод) was now engraved on the fenders instead of &quot;Avtozavod imeni Molotova&quot; (Автозавод имени Молотова). In 1958, annual production reached its peak of 173,000 units. In 1961, production of the successor GAZ-53 started and a few years later there was the GAZ-52. Nevertheless, the GAZ-51 continued to be built until April 2, 1975 and some special versions such as the GAZ-93 tipper until 1976. In total, 3,481,033 GAZ-51 trucks rolled off the assembly line in almost 30 years.

==Variants==

Based on the GAZ-51, countless modifications and special vehicles were created over the course of almost 30 years of production. The following list is therefore not complete and is only intended to provide an overview.

* GAZ-11-51 – prototype from 1939 with a completely different cab
* GAZ-51 – basic truck version, mass-produced from 1946 to 1955
* GAZ-51A – basic version, built from 1955 to 1975
* GAZ-51F – prototype with optimized engine from 1961, no series production
* GAZ-51K – Ambulance on the chassis of the GAZ-51
* GAZ-51L – model with reinforced frame and a payload of three tons, built from 1953 to 1975
* GAZ-51M – chassis for PMG-12 fire trucks. Built from 1949 to 1953.
* GAZ-51P – tractor unit, manufactured from 1956 to 1975 on the basis of the GAZ-51A
* GAZ-51R – freight taxi, which was also suitable for passenger transport. Production took place from 1956 to 1975.
* GAZ-51Sch – model with conversion to operation on natural gas, mass-produced from 1950 onwards.
* GAZ-51 half-track – prototype, two were built in 1953 and 1954
* GAZ-93 – mass-produced tipper based on the GAZ-51, several versions were produced from 1948 to 1976. Over 300,000 units were built.
* GZA-651 – minibus on the chassis of the GAZ-51. Over time, there have been various variations from different manufacturers. The PAZ-652 and RAF-251 also use the chassis of the truck.
* K-2.5-1E – Mobile crane, built from 1950 to 1963.
* KI-51 – refrigerated transporter built from 1955 to 1958 based on the GAZ-51
* AZU-20 (51) 60А – Fire engine, built from 1959 to 1975. About 10 to 15 other fire engines such as turntable ladders or tank fire trucks were manufactured on the basis of the GAZ-51.
* AKS 51-22 &quot;Aremkuz&quot; – minibus produced in Moscow from 1950 to 1962, very similar to the GZA-651.
* Progress-8 – This minibus was produced especially for the Soviet Army in a repair plant based on GAZ-51 chassis.
* AZPT-1,8 – 1800 litre milk tanker
* MPR-812D – Tool Trolley
* S-4M – snow loader. Only the chassis and part of the technology were used, and the body was completely redesigned. Vehicles of this type were in use at least from 1975, there were various other versions. The purpose of the machine is to automatically pick up snow and load it onto trucks via a conveyor belt. 

In addition to the listed versions, the GAZ-51 was built under license in some states. In Poland, the FSC Lublin-51 was built in the Fabryka Samochodów Ciężarowych. It was produced on a trial basis from 1948 and in series production from 1952, and by July 1959 17,497 to 17,840 units had been built, depending on the source. The successor there was the FSC Żuk delivery light van. In China, both the GAZ-51A and the GAZ-63 were built under license from 1958 onwards, manufactured by the later Nanjing Automobile Group. The model was given the name Yuejing NJ-130/230.

In North Korea, too, a licensed version was created with the Sungri-58, which was produced in the Sungri Motor Plant from 1958 onwards. With some modifications, this happened until the 1990s, and the GAZ-63 was also rebuilt there. In 1979, the truck received a new cab and continued mostly unchanged mechanically until the 1990s. Modernized versions of this truck were still being built until the 2010s, but it is unknown if they are still produced today.

The GAZ-51 engine also turned out to be quite resilient and durable. Being in production since 1946, in addition to the GAZ-51, was used for many years (boosted to 90 hp by installing two carburetors and equipped with a fluid coupling) on GAZ-12 passenger cars, and also in the BTR-40, BTR-60, and BRDM-1 armoured personal carriers, and it was used in the GAZ-52 truck until 1989.

== GAZ-63 ==

The GAZ-63 (Russian: ГАЗ-63) is a light truck with four-wheel drive by the Soviet vehicle manufacturer Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod. It is a development from before the Second World War and is based on the GAZ-51, which does not have all-wheel drive.

Apart from these, it is largely identical to the GAZ-51, and only differs in that it has a higher stance and all-wheel drive. It was built until 1968, when it was replaced by the new and more modern GAZ-66, with which it shared no components or parts. The GAZ-63 was used in the Soviet Army as a transport vehicle, but also for special superstructures such as the BM-14 projectile launcher. The GAZ-63 served as the basis for the BTR-40 armoured personal carrier.

<text>Lillian Russell (born Helen Louise Leonard; December 4, 1860 or 1861 – June 6, 1922) was an American actress and singer. She became one of the most famous actresses and singers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, praised for her beauty and style, as well as for her voice and stage presence.

Russell was born in Clinton, Iowa, but raised in Chicago. Her parents separated when she was 18, and she moved to New York with her mother. She began to perform professionally by 1879, singing for Tony Pastor and playing roles in comic opera, including Gilbert and Sullivan works. Composer Edward Solomon created roles in several of his comic operas for her in London. In 1884, they returned to New York and married in 1885, but in 1886, Solomon was arrested for bigamy. For many years, she was the foremost singer of operettas and musical theatre in the United States, performing continuously through the end of the 19th century.

In 1899, she joined the Weber and Fields&#x27; Broadway Music Hall, where she starred for five years. After 1904, she began to have vocal difficulties and switched to dramatic roles. She later returned to musical roles in vaudeville and retired from performing around 1919. Russell was married four times, but her longest relationship was with Diamond Jim Brady, who supported her extravagant lifestyle for four decades. In later years, she wrote a newspaper column, advocated women&#x27;s suffrage, was a popular lecturer, and contributed to the passage of the restrictive Immigration Act of 1924.

==Life and career==
Russell was born Helen Louise Leonard in Clinton, Iowa, the fourth of five daughters of newspaper publisher Charles E. Leonard, and author and feminist Cynthia Leonard, the first woman to run for mayor of New York City. Her family moved to Chicago in 1865, where she studied at the Convent of the Sacred Heart from age 7 to 15 and then at the Park Institute. Her father became a partner in the printing firm of Knight &amp; Leonard, and her mother became active in the women&#x27;s rights movement. Russell, called Nellie as a child, excelled at school theatricals. In her teens, she studied music privately and sang in choirs. In December 1877, she performed in an amateur production of &quot;Time Tries All&quot; at Chickering Hall in Chicago.

===Early career===

When Russell was 18, her parents separated, and she, her mother and her younger sister moved to New York City, where her mother did suffrage work for Susan B. Anthony. Russell studied singing under Leopold Damrosch and considered pursuing an operatic career; her very religious mother disapproved of her working in theatre, which she considered disreputable. Russell began dating Walter Sinn, whose father owned the Brooklyn Park Theatre. Walter&#x27;s mother helped Russell get a chorus job (as Nellie Leonard) with Edward E. Rice, who was touring his musical &quot;Evangeline&quot; to Boston beginning in September 1879, together with Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s comic opera &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. Russell soon began seeing the orchestra leader Harry Braham and became pregnant. They married in November when the show moved to New York theatres. She gave birth to their son Harry in June 1880. In September, Braham got a prestigious job conducting at Tony Pastor&#x27;s Theatre on Broadway. Pastor, known as the father of vaudeville, was responsible for introducing many well-known performers. In November 1880, Pastor engaged Russell for his variety shows. At his suggestion, she chose a stage name, Lillian Russell, and Pastor introduced her as an &quot;English ballad singer&quot;. She was immediately popular with audiences and soon was acting in skits, as well as singing. In early 1881, the baby died after his nanny accidentally penetrated his stomach with a diaper pin. Braham came home to find the dying baby. The tragedy exacerbated Russell&#x27;s difficult relationship with her mother and led to her divorce from Braham.

In the summer of 1881, Russell toured with Pastor&#x27;s company. That fall, she played the leading soprano role of Mabel in a burlesque of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; at Pastor&#x27;s theatre. She next played at the Bijou Opera House on Broadway as Djenna in &quot;The Great Mogul&quot; and with the McCaull Comic Opera Company played Bathilda there in &quot;Olivette&quot;. She also played the title role in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Patience&quot; and Aline in &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; in 1882 at the Bijou.

===Bigamous marriage and peak years===
Russell met composer Edward Solomon later in 1882 at Pastor&#x27;s New York Casino Theatre where he was the season&#x27;s musical director and she became the star. Unaware of his first marriage, she became his mistress and they sailed together to London. There she starred in several works he wrote specifically for her, including Virginia in &quot;Paul and Virginia&quot;, Phoebe in &quot;Billee Taylor&quot;, and the title roles in &quot;Polly, or the Pet of the Regiment&quot; and &quot;Pocahontas&quot;. While in London, she was engaged to create the title role in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Princess Ida&quot; (1884), but she clashed with W.S. Gilbert and was dismissed during rehearsals.

Solomon&#x27;s comic operas were not highly successful in Britain, so Russell and Solomon returned to America. They had a daughter together, Dorothy Lillian Russell, in 1884, and married in New Jersey in 1885. Russell was very well received in Solomon&#x27;s works, on tour in the U.S. for Pastor. Another Solomon success for Russell and Pastor was &quot;Pepita; or, the Girl with the Glass Eyes&quot;. Russell also played in New York theatres or on tour in Gilbert and Sullivan and in operettas. Her relationship with Solomon soured, mostly due to his poor finances, and their last show, &quot;The Maid and the Moonshiner&quot; (1886), was a flop. When creditors sued Solomon, he fled the country. In 1886, Solomon was arrested for bigamy because his previous marriage had not been dissolved. Russell obtained a divorce from Solomon in 1893.
Russell continued to star in comic opera and other musical theatre. She toured with the J.C. Duff Opera Company between other engagements for two years beginning in 1886. In 1887, she starred as Carlotta in &quot;Gasparone&quot; by Karl Millöcker in New York City at the Standard Theatre, together with Eugène Oudin and J.H. Ryley. Later the same year, she was back at the Casino Theatre in the title role of &quot;Dorothy&quot;, and over the next several years, she continued to star in operettas and musical theatre on Broadway. Her parts at this time included the title role in &quot;The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein&quot;, Fiorella in &quot;The Brigands&quot; (in a translation by W.S. Gilbert), Teresa in &quot;The Mountebanks&quot;, Marion in &quot;La Cigale&quot;, and Rosa in &quot;Princess Nicotine&quot;. In 1891, she opened at the Garden Theatre as the star of the Lillian Russell Opera Company. &quot;Giroflé-Girofla&quot; was a favorite of Russell, who played the dual lead role in Chicago, New York and on tour in the 1890s.

For many years, Russell was the foremost singer of operettas in America. Her voice, stage presence and beauty were the subject of a great deal of fanfare in the news media, and she was extremely popular with audiences. Actress Marie Dressler observed, &quot;I can still recall the rush of pure awe that marked her entrance on the stage. And then the thunderous applause that swept from orchestra to gallery, to the very roof.&quot; When Alexander Graham Bell introduced long-distance telephone service on May 8, 1890, Russell&#x27;s voice was the first carried over the line. From New York City, Russell sang the saber song from &quot;La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein&quot; to audiences in Boston and Washington, D.C. She rode a bicycle custom made for her by Tiffany &amp; Co. It was a gold-plated machine that displayed the jeweler&#x27;s art at its most opulent and unconventional – the handlebars inlaid with mother-of-pearl and the wheel spokes featuring her initials set in diamonds. She had &quot;a cream serge leg-of-mutton sleeve cycling suit with the skirt shortened by three inches, which caused a sensation and set a trend.&quot;

She married tenor John Haley Augustin Chatterton (known professionally as Signor Giovanni Perugini) in 1894, but they soon separated, and in 1898, they divorced. In the spring of 1894, she returned to London to play Betta in &quot;The Queen of Brilliants&quot; by Edward Jakobowski and then played the same role in the New York production at Abbey&#x27;s Theatre. She remained at Abbey&#x27;s, playing several roles, but when that theatre shut down in 1896, she played in other Broadway houses in more operettas by Offenbach (such as &quot;The Princess of Trebizonde&quot; and many others), Victor Herbert and others, such as &quot;Erminie&quot; (at the Casino Theatre) in 1899. 

For 40 years, Russell was also the companion of businessman &quot;Diamond Jim&quot; Brady, who showered her with expensive gifts of diamonds and gemstones and supported her extravagant lifestyle. Russell was said to be able nearly to match Brady&#x27;s excessive eating habits, and would do so in public. While she was proud of her ability, it led to long-term struggles with her weight which, at her heaviest, approached 200 pounds.

===Later years===

In 1899, Russell joined the Weber and Fields Music Hall, where she starred in their burlesques and other entertainments until 1904. Her first production there was &quot;Fiddle-dee-dee&quot; in 1899 which also featured DeWolf Hopper, Fay Templeton and David Warfield. Other favorites were &quot;Whoop-de-doo&quot; and &quot;The Big Little Princess&quot;. Before the 1902 production of &quot;Twirly-Whirly&quot;, John Stromberg, who had composed several hit songs for her, delayed giving Russell her solo for several days, saying that it was not ready. When he committed suicide a few days before the first rehearsal, sheet music for &quot;Come Down Ma Evenin&#x27; Star&quot; was discovered in his coat pocket. It became Russell&#x27;s signature song and is the only one she is known to have recorded, although the recording was made after Russell&#x27;s voice had deteriorated significantly.
Leaving Weber and Fields, she next played the title role of &quot;Lady Teazle&quot; in 1904 at the Casino Theatre and then began to play in vaudeville. After 1904, Russell began to have vocal difficulties, but she did not retire from the stage. Instead, she switched to non-musical comedies, touring from 1906 to 1908 under the management of James Brooks. In 1906, she played the title role in &quot;Barbara&#x27;s Millions&quot;, and in 1908 she was Henrietta Barrington in &quot;Wildfire&quot;. The next year she was Laura Curtis in &quot;The Widow&#x27;s Might&quot;. In 1911, she toured in &quot;In Search of a Sinner&quot;. Russell then returned to singing, appearing in burlesque, variety and other entertainments.

In 1912, she married her fourth husband, Alexander Pollock Moore, owner of the &quot;Pittsburgh Leader&quot;, and mostly retired from the stage. The wedding was held in Pittsburgh at the grand Schenley Hotel, which today is a national historic landmark and the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s student union building. Russell lived, for a time, in suite 437 of the hotel, now located in the offices of the student newspaper, &quot;The Pitt News&quot;. The same year, she made her last appearance on Broadway in Weber &amp; Fields&#x27; &quot;Hokey Pokey&quot;. In 1915, Russell appeared with Lionel Barrymore in the motion picture &quot;Wildfire&quot;, which was based on the 1908 play in which she had appeared. This was one of her few motion picture appearances. She appeared in vaudeville until 1919, when ill health forced her to leave the stage entirely, after a four-decade long career.

Beginning around 1912, Russell wrote a newspaper column, became active in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement (as her mother had been), and was a popular lecturer on personal relationships, health and beauty, advocating an optimistic philosophy of self-help and drawing large crowds. In 1913, she declared that she would refuse to pay her income taxes to protest &quot;the denial of the ballot to women.&quot; Nonetheless, she recruited for the U.S. Marine Corps during World War I and raised money for the war effort.
Russell became a wealthy woman, and during the 1919 Actors&#x27; Equity Association strike, she made a major donation of money to sponsor the formation of the Chorus Equity Association by the chorus girls at the Ziegfeld Follies. In March 1922, Russell traveled aboard the from Southampton, England, to the Port of New York on the March 11–17 crossing. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, she &quot;established a precedent by acting as Chairman of the ship&#x27;s concert, the first woman, so far as the records show, to preside at an entertainment on shipboard.&quot;

===Fact-finding mission and death===
In 1922, Russell undertook a fact-finding mission to Europe on behalf of President Warren Harding. The mission was to investigate the increase in immigration. She recommended a five-year moratorium on immigration and a minimum of 21 years residency before making application for naturalization. Russell stated: &quot;only the useless in the reconstruction of their countries are seeking to come to the United States ... the immigration of recent years has been from that class of people which arrests rather than aids, the development of any nation&quot;. Her findings were instrumental in developing the content of the Immigration Act of 1924, which greatly restricted immigration of southern and eastern Europeans and banned the immigration of Asians.

Russell suffered apparently minor injuries on the return trip, which, however, led to complications, and she died after ten days of illness at her home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Thousands of people lined the route of her military funeral, attended by many actors and politicians; President Harding sent a wreath that was set atop her casket. She is interred in her family&#x27;s private mausoleum in the Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
==Thoroughbred racing==
Lillian Russell&#x27;s friend Diamond Jim Brady was a significant owner of thoroughbred racehorses and may have influenced her decision to become involved in the sport. In August 1906, her press agent announced she had acquired eight colts sired by the New Zealand stallion Carbine for her new thoroughbred racing stable. She competed under the &quot;nom de course&quot; &quot;Mr. Clinton&quot; with racing colors to be navy blue with a white star.
==Legacy==
A full-length portrait of Russell was painted in 1902 by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862–1947) who also painted another oval half-length, but both portraits are missing. A 1940 film was made about Russell, although it presents a sanitized version of Russell&#x27;s life. It was directed by Irving Cummings, and stars Alice Faye as Russell, with Henry Fonda, Don Ameche, Edward Arnold and Warren William. Marilyn Monroe posed as Russell for &quot;Life&quot;.
The Lillian Russell Theatre aboard the City of Clinton Showboat is a summer stock theatre named after Russell in her hometown of Clinton, Iowa. The University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s student activities building, the William Pitt Union, has a Lillian Russell Room on its fourth floor, in the offices of &quot;The Pitt News&quot;, in the same location where Russell lived when the building was the Schenley Hotel. The room contains a portrait of Russell.

<doc id="747754" wikidata="Q3028364" url="?curid=747754" title="Keenspot">
<text>Keenspot is a webcomics/webtoons portal founded in March 2000 by cartoonist Chris Crosby (author of &quot;Superosity&quot;), Crosby&#x27;s mother Teri, cartoonist Darren Bleuel (author of &quot;Nukees&quot;), and Nathan Stone.

, Keenspot.com was the exclusive webcomics home of &quot;Twokinds&quot;, &quot;Brawl in the Family&quot;, the &quot;Luther Strode&quot; saga, &quot;Marry Me&quot;, &quot;Last Blood&quot;, &quot;Fall Out Boy Presents Fall Out Toy Works&quot;, &quot;Flipside&quot;, and dozens of other features.

In December 2016, Keenspot began publishing a new line of print comic book titles distributed to comic book stores by Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc. Their launch titles included monthly ongoings of &quot;Hunters of Salamanstra&quot; and &quot;Marry Me&quot; and book collections of Thomas Fischbach&#x27;s &quot;Twokinds&quot;. Keenspot books are now distributed by Simon &amp; Schuster.

==History==
The formation of Keenspot was triggered by the collapse of an earlier webcomic portal, Big Panda.

Following the portal&#x27;s creation in March 2000, Keenspot was serving over 23 million page views monthly by February 2001 and had 47 cartoonists. Also in June 2000 they had launched the free comics web hosting service Keenspace (later renamed Comic Genesis). In 2001 Keenspot launched its own printed comic book line and launched graphic novel collections in 2002 both at San Diego Comic-Con. By August in 2002, Keenspot opened a retail store, selling brandname toys and comics; Keenspot had 50 million views monthly and 600 paying members – who can read the comics without ads – and had published 26 titles.

Keenspot gross revenues grew from $103,976 in 2002 to $188,475 in 2003 with the number of pageviews largely unchanged from mid-2001. it claimed to be home to more than 50 comics covering several genres and artistic styles.

In 2008, Bleuel and Stone sold their 50% stake in Keenspot to Crosby Comics, leaving Chris and Teri Crosby as the sole owners. Daniel &quot;Dan&quot; Shive, writer-illustrator of the Keenspot webcomic/webtoon series &quot;EGS&quot;, was named Chief Technical Officer (CTO).

As of September 2017 the site hosts 57 comics, of which eight are described as &quot;updating with new comics regularly&quot; and the rest of which are &quot;completed or update infrequently&quot;.

==Impact and Policies==
One of Keenspot&#x27;s most notable traits is that it has been a starting point and steadfast supporter of many successful webcartoonists over the years. More than a dozen comics originally and currently hosted at Keenspot have branched out to become substantial full-time jobs for their creators.

The company says that it keeps exclusive web publishing rights to its comics, including archives, but that other rights are left with the creators. Side projects, particularly merchandising deals, are covered separately. Keenspot Entertainment is based in Cresbard, South Dakota.

The majority of titles published by Keenspot have been distributed to comic book stores worldwide by Diamond Comic Distributors. Keenspot has also launched two podcasts, a cartoon podcast, called Keentoons Video Podcast Network and an audio podcast called Keencast. Until 2006, Keenspot published the Keenspot Comics Page in collaboration with the Turlock Journal and several other small newspapers.

<text>Morgan Russell (January 25, 1886 – May 29, 1953) was a modern American artist. With Stanton Macdonald-Wright, he was the founder of Synchromism, a provocative style of abstract painting that dates from 1912 to the 1920s. Russell&#x27;s &quot;synchromies,&quot; which analogized color to music, were an early American contribution to the rise of Modernism.

==Biography==

Russell was born and raised in New York City. He initially studied architecture and, after 1903, became friendly with the sculptor Arthur Lee, for whom he posed as a model and with whom he lived for a time. From 1903 to 1905, he studied sculpture at the Art Students League with Lee and James Earle Fraser; he also posed as a model for the sculpture class. With financial help from Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, whom he met at the League in January 1906, he traveled to Europe to study art in Paris and Rome. Mrs. Whitney was one of the earliest and staunchest believers in Russell&#x27;s talent and provided him with a monthly stipend for several years. In 1907, after returning to New York City, Russell studied painting at the New York School of Art with the noted Ashcan painter Robert Henri, among others. Returning to Paris in 1909, he studied at Matisse’s art school, frequented Gertrude Stein&#x27;s salon, and met Picasso and Rodin.

In Paris, Russell met Stanton Macdonald-Wright, a fellow expatriate, in 1911, and soon after the two began developing theories about color and its primacy in the creation of a meaningful work of art. Like other young adventurous artists of the time, they had come to view academic realism as a dead-end and were pondering the possibilities of an art form that might minimize or even abandon representational content. They were particularly interested in the theories of their teacher, Canadian painter Percyval Tudor-Hart, who believed that colors could be orchestrated in the same harmonious way that a composer arranges notes in a symphony. Inspired by their experience of Delacroix, the Post-Impressionists, and the Fauves, Russell and Macdonald-Wright co-founded Synchromism in 1912. In June of the same year, they held their first Synchromist exhibition at Der Neue Kunstsalon in Munich, followed four months later by another exhibition at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris. Like other young modernists eager to make a name for themselves, they issued a manifesto broadcasting their goals, plastered the kiosks of Paris with notices of their show, and hoped to create a sensation. Russell also began exhibiting at the Salon des Indépendants in 1913.

Synchromism was an early innovation in pure abstraction, which was developed primarily by Russell with contributions from Stanton Macdonald-Wright. Other American painters in Paris experimenting with Synchromism at the time included Thomas Hart Benton, Andrew Dasburg, and Patrick Henry Bruce, all of whom were friends with Russell and Macdonald-Wright. Bruce was also friendly with Sonia and Robert Delaunay, proponents of Orphism (a term coined in 1912 by the poet Guillaume Apollinaire). Similarities between Synchromism and Orphism led to later charges of plagiarism, which both Russell and Macdonald-Wright vehemently denied.

Russell and Macdonald-Wright had high hopes for acclaim and financial success when they introduced Synchromism to the New York art world. Though Russell exhibited in the famous Armory Show in New York in 1913 and in the prestigious Forum Exhibition of Modern American Painters in 1916, those hopes were never met. Art collectors, critics, and curators prior to World War I were reluctant to embrace color abstraction and, on the rare occasions when they were open to radical new styles of art, preferred the European modernism attached to names with greater cachet.

The first sympathetic, extended treatment of Synchromism appeared in the book &quot;Modern Painting: Its Tendency and Meaning,&quot; published in 1915 by Macdonald-Wright&#x27;s brother, Willard Huntington Wright, a prestigious literary editor and art critic. (Stanton secretly co-authored the book, a fact that the Wright brothers were at pains to conceal.) &quot;Modern Painting: Its Tendency and Meaning&quot; surveyed the major modern art movements from Manet to Cubism, praised the work of Cézanne and Matisse, denigrated &quot;lesser Moderns&quot; such as Kandinsky and the Orphists, and predicted a coming age in which abstraction would supplant representational art. Synchromism, the subject of a long, adulatory chapter, is presented in the book as the culminating point in the evolutionary process of Modernism. At no time did Wright acknowledge that he was writing about his own brother and his friend, Morgan Russell. Also, by overstating his case, Wright did little long-range good for the cause he was promoting, but his well-reviewed book did bring some informed attention to the two painters. For a time, their names appeared more frequently in the art press, and even H.L. Mencken bought a Synchromist painting, which he later donated to the Baltimore Museum of Art.

By 1920, Russell and Macdonald-Wright had gone their separate ways, though Macdonald-Wright continued to make efforts at selling his friend&#x27;s work throughout the 1920s. Macdonald-Wright moved back to his native California and established a successful niche for himself as a charismatic figure in the Los Angeles art world. Russell, who was a cross-dresser (though married twice), never ceased painting, either, but he experienced financial difficulties and lapsed into relative obscurity. Synchromism was seldom discussed in art-history textbooks and was not the subject of any major exhibitions before the late 1950s. Gallery exhibitions of Russell&#x27;s work were infrequent. After spending almost four decades in France between 1909 and 1946, Russell retired to the United States after the war and converted to Catholicism in 1947. His painting in his later years, often of nudes, was largely figurative and displayed none of the color effects he had pioneered with Synchromism. After suffering two incapacitating strokes, he died aged 67 in a nursing home in a suburb of Philadelphia in 1953.

Gradually, during the last three decades of the twentieth century, long-overdue scholarly and public attention was paid to Synchromism. The Whitney Museum of American Art launched a six-museum traveling exhibition in 1978 devoted to color abstraction that brought Russell&#x27;s name before the public again, and the purchase of his papers by collector Henry Reed, and the subsequent donation to and controversial retrieval of those papers from the Whitney Museum, brought his name into the news. Morgan Russell&#x27;s first museum retrospective was held at the Montclair Art Museum in New Jersey in 1990. His work is represented today in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the Columbus Museum of Art, and the San Diego Museum of Art, among others. His monumental &quot;Synchromy in Orange: To Form&quot; (1914), in the collection of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, was one of the centerpieces of the 2013 exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, &quot;Inventing Abstraction, 1910–1925.&quot;

<text>William Eustis Russell (January 6, 1857 – July 16, 1896) was a lawyer and Democratic Party politician from Massachusetts. He served four terms as mayor of Cambridge, and was the 37th governor of Massachusetts, serving from 1891 to 1894. He was the state&#x27;s second youngest-ever chief executive, and was the first Democrat since the American Civil War to serve more than one term in that office.

Educated at Harvard and Boston University Law School, Russell practiced law in the family firm. He was politically a conservative Democrat, supporting the presidential campaigns of Grover Cleveland and the gold standard for the national currency. He gave a speech in favor of the latter at the 1896 Democratic National Convention immediately prior to William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s Cross of Gold speech, and refused efforts to draft him as an opponent to Bryan for the presidential nomination. About a week later, he died quite suddenly at a fishing camp in Quebec; he was 39. He was viewed by eastern Democrats as a future party leader and presidential contender.

==Family==
William Eustis Russell was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the ninth child and fourth son of Charles Theodore Russell and Sarah Elizabeth (Ballister) Russell. On his father&#x27;s side, he was descended from Thomas Hastings, and William Russell, both 17th-century settlers of Massachusetts, while his mother was of Huguenot descent. Russell&#x27;s father was a politically active Democratic Party lawyer, who served as mayor of Cambridge 1861–62. Russell was the father of Cambridge mayor Richard M. Russell, and the great-grandfather of small government advocate Carla A. Howell and writer Thomas E. Ricks. In 1885, Russell married Margaret Manning Swan; they had three children.

==Education and early career==
Russell attended Harvard College, graduating in 1877. He excelled at history, political economy, and ethics, and was poor in language, math, and chemistry. He was a member of the Hasty Pudding Club, and was an active participant in varsity sports, boxing, playing football, and on the school&#x27;s rifle shooting squad, where he was considered an excellent marksman. He was also politically active, campaigning for Samuel J. Tilden in the 1876 presidential election.

In 1879, he received his law degree from the Boston University School of Law, and was the first to graduate &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from that school. While studying at BU he won the Lawrence prize for the best legal essay. He was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1880 and began the practice of law with his father&#x27;s Boston firm, Russell &amp; Russell, which also included his brother and uncle.

He entered politics in 1881, winning election to the Cambridge common council by a single vote, on a write-in &quot;sticker campaign&quot; started by friends without his knowledge. He was elected to the board of aldermen in 1883 and 1884.

==Mayor of Cambridge==
Russell served as Mayor of Cambridge for four 1-year terms from 1885 to 1888, being reelected with no opposition at least twice, running on non-party tickets. When he took office, the city treasury was virtually empty, and it was saddled with a high tax rate. In his first year in office, Russell balanced the budget, funded the city&#x27;s debt, and paid off its outstanding bills. He adopted the slogan &quot;pay as you go&quot; to exemplify his approach to city finances. During his tenure, he oversaw improvements in wide array of city services, include streets, sewers, fire, police, and health. Charles Eliot Norton opined that Cambridge was then the best-run city in the state.

Although Russell was personally opposed to the prohibition of alcohol, the city voted in 1886 to become dry, and he won favorable notice for enforcing the ban despite his opposition to it. He received mixed reviews for labor-related actions. In 1886, he successfully settled a meatpackers&#x27; strike, but in a February 1887 strike by the local horse railway, he called out the police to support strikebreakers, and (after two instances of violence) called out the militia to maintain order until the strike was broken.

While in office, Russell solicited sizable donations from philanthropist Frederick Hastings Rindge (a Harvard classmate) which made possible the construction of Cambridge City Hall, a Manual Training School (now Cambridge Rindge and Latin School), and Cambridge&#x27;s public library. These were the first large-scale philanthropic gifts the city had received. Russell&#x27;s efficient administration as mayor, particularly in the enforcement of the liquor ban, and his effective campaign speeches during the Presidential campaign of 1884 made him a prominent figure in state politics.

==Governor of Massachusetts==

In 1886, Russell declined a party effort to recruit him has a candidate for the U.S. Congress. He twice ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Massachusetts in 1888 and 1889, defeated by Oliver Ames and John Quincy Adams Brackett. He finally won the governorship in 1890 in a rematch of the 1889 contest with Brackett. The 1890 victory was part of a national backlash against Republican tariff legislation, overlaid by opposition within the state to Brackett&#x27;s harsh enforcement of liquor laws. He was twice reelected, in 1891 and 1892, making him the first Democrat since the American Civil War to win more than one term as Massachusetts governor. His election as governor for three successive years was a result of his personal popularity: the majority of the legislature and state officials during his tenure were Republicans. His administration was marked by impartiality and lack of partisanship. As governor, several laws were passed on his recommendation, including a measure to regulate the activities of lobbyists, and another abolishing the property qualification for governor and the poll tax. Russell&#x27;s administration also saw the beginning of an inheritance tax. He advocated and signed a series of pro-labor laws, and signed legislation establishing the Metropolitan District Commission (a state agency) and the Trustees of Reservations (a private charity) to preserve open spaces. He decided not to run for reelection in 1893, and resumed the practice of law.

==Later political activity==
During the 1892 presidential campaign, there was talk of Russell being the vice presidential nominee if Senator John M. Palmer were to receive the Democratic presidential nomination. In early February 1892, Palmer and Patrick A. Collins, a former Democratic Massachusetts Congressman, agreed to make Palmer the Democratic presidential candidate and Russell, Collins&#x27; personal and political friend, the vice presidential candidate. Palmer ended up rejecting the bid, and argued against it at the 1892 Democratic National Convention. Russell received one vote for President on the first ballot.
Russell was one of the most active opponents of free silver during the 1896 presidential election. He announced his candidacy for President in April 1896, and garnered support and convention delegates in many states across the eastern United States, but he was harmed by lackluster support given by outgoing President Cleveland. In contrast to the eastern states, many midwestern and western states chose free silver delegations, dimming his prospects for the nomination. Russell categorically rejected the idea of becoming the nominee if the convention adopted a silver platform, and had to be coaxed into attending the 1896 Democratic National Convention. At the convention, after the silver platform was adopted, he refused to be considered for a third-party candidacy. He gave an impassioned speech in favor of the gold standard, which was immediately followed by William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s famous Cross of Gold speech. Bryan&#x27;s nomination for the presidency was seconded by a Massachusetts delegate George Fred Williams, who had bolted to the silver side after becoming a delegate, and was a prominent state intraparty opponent of Russell. Russell received two votes for President on the first ballot.

==Death and legacy==
After the 1896 convention, Russell traveled to the Gaspé peninsula of eastern Quebec to escape the summer heat and political pressures. He died quite unexpectedly on the night of his arrival, July 16, 1896, in his sleep, at a camp on the Little Pabos River just north of Sainte-Adelaide-de-Pabos. The cause of death was ruled to be heart failure. Russell was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge; his funeral was attended by President Cleveland.

In 1903, the William E. Russell School in Boston&#x27;s Dorchester neighborhood, designed by James Mulcahy, was named in his honor. It still serves as an elementary school in the Boston Public Schools.
