<doc id="730735" wikidata="Q44847" url="?curid=730735" title="D. T. Suzuki">
<text>, self-rendered in 1894 as Daisetz, was a Japanese essayist, philosopher, religious scholar, and translator. He was an authority on Buddhism, especially Zen and Shin, and was instrumental in spreading interest in these (and in Far Eastern philosophy in general) to the West. He was also a prolific translator of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese and Sanskrit literature. Suzuki spent several lengthy stretches teaching or lecturing at Western universities and devoted many years to a professorship at Ōtani University, a Japanese university of the Ōtani School of Jōdo Shinshū.

Suzuki was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1963.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===

D. T. Suzuki was born Teitarō Suzuki in Honda-machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture, the fourth son of physician Ryojun Suzuki. The Buddhist name &quot;Daisetsu&quot;, meaning &quot;Great Humility&quot;, the kanji of which can also mean &quot;Greatly Clumsy&quot;, was given to him by his Zen master Soen (or Soyen) Shaku. Although his birthplace no longer exists, a humble monument marks its location (a tree with a rock at its base). The samurai class into which Suzuki was born declined with the fall of feudalism, which forced Suzuki&#x27;s mother, a Jōdo Shinshū Buddhist, to raise him in impoverished circumstances after his father died. When he became old enough to reflect on his fate in being born into this situation, he began to look for answers in various forms of religion. His naturally sharp and philosophical intellect found difficulty in accepting some of the cosmologies to which he was exposed.

=== Study ===
Suzuki studied at Waseda University and University of Tokyo. Suzuki set about acquiring knowledge of Chinese, Sanskrit, Pali, and several European languages. During his student years at Tokyo University, Suzuki took up Zen practice at Engaku-ji in Kamakura.

Suzuki lived and studied several years with the scholar Paul Carus. Suzuki was introduced to Carus by Soyen Shaku (or Soen Shaku), who met him at the World Parliament of Religions held in Chicago in 1893. Carus, who had set up residence in LaSalle, Illinois, approached Soyen Shaku to request his help in translating and preparing Eastern spiritual literature for publication in the West. Soyen Shaku instead recommended his student Suzuki for the job. Suzuki lived at Dr. Carus&#x27;s home, the Hegeler Carus Mansion, and worked with him, initially in translating the classic &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; from ancient Chinese. In Illinois, Suzuki began his early work &quot;Outlines of Mahayana Buddhism&quot;.

Carus himself had written a book offering an insight into, and overview of, Buddhism, titled &quot;The Gospel of Buddha&quot;. Soyen Shaku wrote the introduction, and Suzuki translated the book into Japanese. At this time, around the turn of the century, quite a number of Westerners and Asians (Carus, Soyen, and Suzuki included) were involved in the worldwide Buddhist revival that had begun slowly in the 1880s.

=== Marriage ===
In 1911, Suzuki married Beatrice Erskine Lane Suzuki, a Radcliffe graduate and theosophist with multiple contacts with the Baháʼí Faith both in America and in Japan. Later Suzuki himself joined the Theosophical Society Adyar and was an active theosophist.

== Career ==
=== Professor of Buddhist philosophies ===
Besides living in the United States, Suzuki traveled through Europe before taking up a professorship back in Japan. In 1909, Suzuki became an assistant professor at Gakushuin University and at the Tokyo University. Suzuki and his wife dedicated themselves to spreading an understanding of Mahayana Buddhism. Until 1919 they lived in a cottage on the Engaku-ji grounds, then moved to Kyoto, where Suzuki began professorship at Ōtani University in 1921. While he was in Kyoto, he visited Dr. Hoseki Shin&#x27;ichi Hisamatsu, a Zen Buddhist scholar, and they discussed Zen Buddhism together at Shunkō-in temple in the Myōshin-ji temple complex.

In 1921, the year he joined Ōtani University, he and his wife founded the Eastern Buddhist Society. The Society is focused on Mahayana Buddhism and offers lectures and seminars, and publishes a scholarly journal, &quot;The Eastern Buddhist&quot;. Suzuki maintained connections in the West and, for instance, delivered a paper at the World Congress of Faiths in 1936, at the University of London (he was an exchange professor during this year).

Besides teaching about Zen practice and the history of Zen (Chan) Buddhism, Suzuki was an expert scholar on the related philosophy called, in Japanese, Kegon, which he thought of as the intellectual explication of Zen experience.

Suzuki received numerous honors, including Japan&#x27;s National Medal of Culture.

=== Studies ===
A professor of Buddhist philosophy in the middle decades of the 20th century, Suzuki wrote introductions and overall examinations of Buddhism, and particularly of the Zen school. He went on a lecture tour of American universities in 1951, and taught at Columbia University from 1952 to 1957.

Suzuki was especially interested in the formative centuries of this Buddhist tradition in China. A lot of Suzuki&#x27;s writings in English concern themselves with translations and discussions of bits of the Chan texts the &quot;Biyan Lu&quot; (Blue Cliff Record) and the &quot;Wumenguan&quot; (Mumonkan/Gateless Passage), which record the teaching styles and words of the classical Chinese masters. He was also interested in how this tradition, once imported into Japan, had influenced Japanese character and history, and wrote about it in English in &quot;Zen and Japanese Culture&quot;. Suzuki&#x27;s reputation was secured in England prior to the U.S.

In addition to his popularly oriented works, Suzuki wrote a translation of the &quot;Lankavatara Sutra&quot; and a commentary on its Sanskrit terminology. He looked in on the efforts of Saburō Hasegawa, Judith Tyberg, Alan Watts and the others who worked in the California Academy of Asian Studies (now known as the California Institute of Integral Studies), in San Francisco in the 1950s. In his later years, he began to explore the Jōdo Shinshū faith of his mother&#x27;s upbringing, and gave guest lectures on Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism at the Buddhist Churches of America.

Suzuki produced an incomplete English translation of the Kyogyoshinsho, the &quot;magnum opus&quot; of Shinran, founder of the Jōdo Shinshū school. He is quoted as saying that Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism is the &quot;most remarkable development of Mahayana Buddhism ever achieved in East Asia&quot;. Suzuki also took an interest in Christian mysticism and in some of the most significant mystics of the West, for example, Meister Eckhart, whom he compared with the Jōdo Shinshū followers called Myokonin. Suzuki was among the first to bring research on the Myokonin to audiences outside Japan as well.

Other works include &quot;Essays in Zen Buddhism&quot; (three volumes), &quot;Studies in Zen Buddhism&quot;, and &quot;Manual of Zen Buddhism&quot;. American philosopher William Barrett compiled many of Suzuki&#x27;s articles and essays concerning Zen into a 1956 anthology entitled &quot;Zen Buddhism&quot;.

=== Scholarly opinions ===
It was Suzuki&#x27;s contention that a Zen &quot;awakening&quot; was the goal of the tradition&#x27;s training, but that what distinguished the tradition as it developed through the centuries in China was a way of life radically different from that of Indian Buddhists. In India, the tradition of the holy beggar prevailed, but in China, social circumstances led to the development of a temple-and-training center system in which the abbot and the monks all performed mundane tasks. These included food gardening or farming, carpentry, architecture, housekeeping, administration (or community direction), and the practice of folk medicine. Consequently, the enlightenment sought in Zen had to stand up well to the demands and potential frustrations of everyday life.

Suzuki took an interest in other traditions besides Zen. His book &quot;Zen and Japanese Buddhism&quot; delved into the history and scope of interest of all the major Japanese Buddhist sects.

== Zen training ==
While studying at Tokyo University Suzuki took up Zen practice at Engaku-ji, one of Kamakura&#x27;s Five Mountains, first studying with Kosen Roshi. After Kosen&#x27;s 1892 passing, Suzuki continued with Kosen&#x27;s successor at Engaku-ji, Soyen Shaku.

Under &quot;Rōshi&quot; Soyen, the first master to teach zen Buddhism in America, Suzuki&#x27;s studies were essentially internal and non-verbal, including long periods of sitting meditation. The task involved what Suzuki described as four years of mental, physical, moral, and intellectual struggle. During training periods at Engaku-ji, Suzuki lived a monk&#x27;s life. He described this life and his own experience at Kamakura in his book &quot;The Training of the Zen Buddhist Monk&quot;. Suzuki characterized the facets of the training as: a life of humility; a life of labor; a life of service; a life of prayer and gratitude; and a life of meditation.

Suzuki was invited by Shaku to visit the United States in the 1890s, and Suzuki acted as English-language translator for a book by Shaku (1906). Though Suzuki had by this point translated some ancient Asian texts into English (e.g. Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana), his role in translating and ghost-writing aspects of Soyen Shaku&#x27;s book was more the beginning of Suzuki&#x27;s career as a writer in English.

== Spread of Zen in the West ==
=== Zen-messenger ===
Suzuki spread Zen in the West. Philosopher Charles A. Moore said:
=== Buddhist modernism ===
As Suzuki portrayed it, Zen Buddhism was a highly practical religion whose emphasis on direct experience made it particularly comparable to forms of mysticism that scholars such as William James had emphasized as the fountainhead of all religious sentiment. It is this idea of a common essence that made Suzuki&#x27;s ideas recognizable to a Western audience.

David McMahan claimed that Western audiences identified with &#x27;Western esotericism concealed&#x27;, &#x27;disguised&#x27; as &#x27;eastern mysticism&#x27;. This resemblance is not coincidental, since Suzuki was also influenced by Western esotericism, and even joined the Theosophical Society.

Several scholars have identified Suzuki as a Buddhist modernist. McMahan describes it, Buddhist modernism consists of

Many scholars agree that the influence of post-Reformation and Enlightenment values have largely defined some of the more conspicuous attributes of Buddhist modernism. McMahan claims

Buddhist modernist traditions are stated consist of a deliberate de-emphasis of the ritual and metaphysical elements of the religion, due to discousr. According to Tweed, Buddhist modernist traditions have also been characterized as being &quot;detraditionalized,&quot; often being presented in a way that &#x27;occludes their historical construction&#x27;. Instead, Buddhist modernists often employ an essentialized description of their tradition, where key tenets are described as universal and &quot;sui generis&quot;.

Sharf claimed that the popular understanding of Zen is related, and implicate &#x27;modernism&#x27; and Suzuki in it

On the other hand, the mentioned authors were themselves &quot;Western&quot;, and the form of critique as &#x27;detraditionalizing&#x27;, &#x27;shorn of true tradition&#x27; is itself ironically specifically a common &#x27;Western&#x27; critique of Western Buddhism, uch as in the case of Buddhadasa and reincarnation. Ironically, this is itself may be essentialist (with respect to &#x27;Other&#x27;) and simplistic.

=== Criticism ===
Suzuki has been criticized for his essentialist approach. As early as 1951, Hu Shih criticized Suzuki for presenting an idealist picture of Zen.

McMahan states:
Suzuki&#x27;s approach has been marked as &quot;incomprehensible&quot;:
== Shin Buddhism ==
Although Suzuki became widely recognized as an authority on Zen, he was deeply interested in and consistently wrote about Jōdo Shinshū (True Pure Land Buddhism) throughout his life. For two decades, he held a professorship at Ōtani University, affiliated with Higashi Honganji, where he and his wife, Beatrice Lane Suzuki, established &quot;The Eastern Buddhist&quot; academic journal. This publication featured essays on Shin, Zen, and various Mahayana traditions. Suzuki also had contacts and discussions with Shin Buddhist thinkers at Ōtani University. Between 1049 and 1953 Suzuki published numerous works and lectures on Pure Land Buddhism and Shin. 

Suzuki came to see the Shin doctrine of Tariki, (the other power of the Buddha), as a kind of letting go of self. Thus, he saw Shin as being complementary to Zen practice. Since he was an outsider to the Shin tradition, he had unique interpretations of Shin Buddhism which were not beholden to the orthodoxy. His interpretations tended to emphasize religious experience, non-duality, and applications of Shin Buddhist teachings to life in this world instead of focusing on the afterlife in the pure land.

In his book &quot;Buddha of Infinite Light&quot; (2002), (originally titled, &quot;Shin Buddhism&quot;) Suzuki declared that, &quot;Of all the developments that Mahayana Buddhism has achieved in East Asia, the most remarkable one is the Shin teaching of Pure Land Buddhism.&quot; (p. 22) In this book, he also writes admiringly of the myokonin (Shin Buddhist saints):The problem of intellection is its inability to deal with ambiguity and contradiction, which take place in life all the time. In spite of such contradictions, the myokonin are thankful and joyful for what they have experienced. When pride is gone, there is humility. And humility is recognition of Other-power. When humility is realized, we have a wonderful feeling of joy. Logically, humility should make one feel quite miserable. Yes, it does. But simultaneously one senses a feeling quite opposite to that of misery. In fact, there is joy and there is happiness. 

== Involvement with Japanese nationalism ==
According to Sharf and Victoria, Suzuki was associated with Japanese nationalism and its propagation via the appraisal of Japanese Zen. He has been criticised for defending the Japanese war effort, though Suzuki&#x27;s thoughts on these have also been placed in the context of western supremacy in the first half of the 20th century, and the reaction against this supremacy in Asian countries.

=== View on Nazism and anti-Semitism ===
Brian Victoria delivered lectures in Germany in 2012 in which he revealed evidence of Suzuki&#x27;s sympathy for the Nazi regime. Victoria writes,

&quot;D. T. Suzuki left a record of his early view of the Nazi movement that was included in a series of articles published in the Japanese Buddhist newspaper, Chūgai Nippō, on 3, 4, 6, 11 and 13 October 1936.&quot; In this Suzuki expresses his agreement with Hitler&#x27;s policies as explained to him by a relative living in Germany.

&quot;While they don&#x27;t know much about politics, they have never enjoyed greater peace of mind than they have now. For this alone, they want to cheer Hitler on. This is what my relative told me. It is quite understandable, and I am in agreement with him.&quot; He also expresses agreement with Hitler&#x27;s expulsion of the Jews from Germany.

&quot;Changing the topic to Hitler&#x27;s expulsion of the Jews, it appears that in this, too, there are a lot of reasons for his actions. While it is a very cruel policy, when looked at from the point of view of the current and future happiness of the entire German people, it may be that, for a time, some sort of extreme action is necessary in order to preserve the nation.&quot;

Suzuki expressed sympathy with individual Jews. &quot;As regards individuals, this is truly a regrettable situation.&quot;

Suzuki was a friend of Karlfried Graf von Dürckheim. Dürckheim, also a noted expounder of Japanese Zen philosophy in the West, was a committed Nazi and worked for the German Foreign Office in Tokyo during the war. He helped his friend Suzuki introduce Zen Buddhism to the West.

Yet perhaps this information, by itself, comprises no appropriate nuance when considering Suzuki&#x27;s attitudes, and may be counterpoised by the quotation from Kemmyō Taira Satō given in the section below (&quot;Japanese nationalism&quot;).

=== New Buddhism ===
At the onset of modernization in the Meiji period, in 1868, when Japan entered the international community, Buddhism was briefly persecuted in Japan as &quot;a corrupt, decadent, anti-social, parasitic, and superstitious creed, inimical to Japan&#x27;s need for scientific and technological advancement&quot;. The Japanese government intended to eradicate the tradition, which was seen as a foreign &quot;other&quot;, incapable of fostering the nativist sentiments that would be vital for national, ideological cohesion. In addition to this, industrialization led to the breakdown of the parishioner system that had funded Buddhist monasteries for centuries. However, a group of modern Buddhist leaders emerged to argue for the Buddhist cause. These leaders stood in agreement with the government persecution of Buddhism, accepting the notion of a corrupt Buddhist institution in need of revitalization.

As a response to the modernisation of Japan and the persecution of Buddhism, the &quot;shin bukkyo&quot;, or &quot;New Buddhism&quot;, came into existence. It was led by university-educated intellectuals who had been exposed to a vast body of Western intellectual literature. Advocates of New Buddhism, like Suzuki&#x27;s teachers Kosen and his successor Soyen Shaku, saw this movement as a defense of Buddhism against government persecution, and also saw it as a way to bring their nation into the modern world as a competitive cultural force.

Scholars such as Robert Sharf, as well as Japanese Zen monk G. Victor Sogen Hori, have argued that the breed of Japanese Zen that was propagated by New Buddhism ideologues, such as Imakita Kosen and Soyen Shaku, was not typical of Japanese Zen during their time, nor is it typical of Japanese Zen now. Its importance lies especially within western Zen:
The traditional form of Zen has been greatly altered by the Meiji restoration, but Japanese Zen still flourishes as a monastic tradition. The Zen tradition in Japan, in its customary form, required a great deal of time and discipline from monks that laity would have difficulty finding. Zen monks were often expected to have spent several years in intensive doctrinal study, memorizing sutras and poring over commentaries, before even entering the monastery to undergo kōan practice in sanzen with a Zen master. The fact that Suzuki himself was able to do so (as a layman) was largely the invention of New Buddhism.

=== Japanese nationalism ===

During the Meiji restoration the Nihonjinron philosophy took prevalence. It emphasizes the uniqueness of the Japanese people. This uniqueness has been attributed to many different factors. Suzuki attributed it to Zen. In his view, Zen embodies the ultimate essence of all philosophy and religion. He pictured Zen as a unique expression of Asian spirituality, which was considered to be superior to the western ways of thinking.

Sharf criticizes this uniqueness theory, as propagated by Suzuki:
Sharf also doubts the motivations of Suzuki:
Kemmyō Taira Satō does not agree with this critical assessment of Suzuki:
== Praise of Suzuki&#x27;s work ==
Suzuki&#x27;s books have been widely read and commented on. One example is &quot;An Introduction to Zen Buddhism&quot;, which includes a 30-page commentary by analytical psychologist Carl Jung, who wrote of Suzuki:
But Jung was also critical, warning against an uncritical borrowing from Asian spirituality.

<text>Springwater is a township in central Ontario, Canada, in Simcoe County, near Barrie. It is the county seat of Simcoe County.

==History==
Prior to European settlement, Ossossane, the largest Wendat settlement and capital of the confederacy was located near modern-day Elmvale.

Springwater was formed in 1994 through the amalgamation of Flos and Vespra Townships, together with the Village of Elmvale and a portion of the former Medonte Township.

==Communities==
Anten Mills is centred on the intersection of Horseshoe Valley Road West (formally County Road 22) and Wilson Drive (formally the 7th Concession of Vespra), northwest of Barrie. The community derived its name from a well-known mill operating in the area in the late 1800s. The first syllables of this firm&#x27;s name, after its owners Charles Anderson and a Mr. Tennant, were merged to create the word Anten. Country music star Jason McCoy grew up in Anten Mills.

Most of the workforce living in Anten Mills are employed in nearby Barrie. The area surrounding Anten Mills is predominantly either farm or crown land; however, golf courses, ski resorts and hiking trails also dot the landscape.

Some 25 km northwest of Anten Mills is Wasaga Beach, a popular summer tourist attraction.

Crown Hill is located at the municipal boundaries of Springwater and Oro-Medonte, just outside the northern city limits of Barrie. Prior to the provincial highway downloads of 1997, Highway 11 left its expressway route through Oro-Medonte at Crown Hill, transferring onto Penetanguishene Road for the remainder of its southerly route into Barrie and Toronto. Highway 11 now continues past the Penetanguishene Road interchange along the former route of Highway 400A, ending at Highway 400 1.1 kilometres further southwest.

Elmvale is located at the intersection of County Road 27 and County Road 92 (Queen Street). The Elmvale Maple Syrup Festival, established in 1966, draws thousands of visitors each year. Elmvale was home to 2,369 people in 2011. It is the site of the Elmvale Jungle Zoo.
Hillsdale is located on Highway 93 at its intersection with Mill Street, just north of Highway 400. It was founded as the half-way point between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay. It was the site of the Simcoe House Hotel (now abandoned). Hillsdale is home to approximately 1,000 people.

Midhurst is the largest population centre in the township. It is home to the Barrie Baycats of the Intercounty Baseball League. A tree nursery operated here that supplied trees for the province.

Minesing is a community near the Nottawasaga River on Highway 26, northwest of Barrie. The community holds two major events every year, one in the late winter called Mini-fest, and a slow-pitch tournament that falls on Labour Day weekend. The community is the birthplace of Hockey Hall of Famer Frank Foyston and is home to Country music star Jason McCoy. It has a small school known as Minesing Central Public School. The nearby Minesing Wetlands is an internationally recognized wetland of significant biological importance.

Along with the main centres of Anten Hills, Crown Hill, Elmvale, Hillsdale, Midhurst and Minesing, the township contains the communities of Allenwood, Apto, Craighurst, Crossland, Dalston, Edenvale, Fergusonvale, Grenfel, Hendrie, Langman, New Flos, Orr Lake, Phelpston, Sandy Beach, Saurin, Snow Valley, Vespra Village, Strongville and Vigo. Two former ghost communities, called Josephine and McKinnon, existed in the Minesing Swamp within the township&#x27;s borders.

<doc id="730738" wikidata="Q154576" url="?curid=730738" title="47 Aglaja">
<text>47 Aglaja is a large, dark main belt asteroid. It was discovered by Robert Luther on 15 September 1857 from Düsseldorf. The name was chosen by the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Bonn and refers to Aglaea, one of the Charites in Greek mythology. It was rendered &quot;Aglaia&quot; in English sources into the early 20th century, as &#x27;i&#x27; and &#x27;j&#x27; are equivalent in Latin names and in the Latin rendering of Greek names.

Based upon its spectrum, 47 Aglaja is listed as a C-type asteroid under the Tholen classification taxonomy, indicating a carbonaceous composition. The SMASS classification system rates it as a rare B-type asteroid. There is a broad absorption feature at 1 μm that is associated with the presence of magnetite and is what gives the asteroid its blue tint.

On 16 September 1984, the star SAO 146599 was occulted by 47 Aglaja. This event was observed from 13 sites in the continental United States, allowing a cross-sectional profile to be determined. Based upon this study, the asteroid has a diameter of 136.4 ± 1.2 km. The geometric albedo calculated at the time of the occultation was 0.071 ± 0.002.

2012 photometric observations of this asteroid at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico gave a light curve with a period of 13.175 ± 0.002 hours and a brightness variation of 0.09 ± 0.01 in magnitude. This result is in agreement with previous studies.

<doc id="730742" wikidata="Q1053211" url="?curid=730742" title="Principal–agent problem">
<text>The principal–agent problem refers to the conflict in interests and priorities that arises when one person or entity (the &quot;agent&quot;) takes actions on behalf of another person or entity (the &quot;principal&quot;). The problem worsens when there is a greater discrepancy of interests and information between the principal and agent, as well as when the principal lacks the means to punish the agent. The deviation from the principal&#x27;s interest by the agent is called &quot;agency costs&quot;.

Common examples of this relationship include corporate management (agent) and shareholders (principal), elected officials (agent) and citizens (principal), or brokers (agent) and markets (buyers and sellers, principals). In all these cases, the principal has to be concerned with whether the agent is acting in the best interest of the principal. Principal-agent models typically either examine moral hazard (hidden actions) or adverse selection (hidden information).

The principalagent problem typically arises where the two parties have different interests and asymmetric information (the agent having more information), such that the principal cannot directly ensure that the agent is always acting in the principal&#x27;s best interest, particularly when activities that are useful to the principal are costly to the agent, and where elements of what the agent does are costly for the principal to observe.

The agency problem can be intensified when an agent acts on behalf of multiple principals (see multiple principal problem). When multiple principals have to agree on the agent&#x27;s objectives, they face a collective action problem in governance, as individual principals may lobby the agent or otherwise act in their individual interests rather than in the collective interest of all principals. The multiple principal problem is particularly serious in the public sector.

Various mechanisms may be used to align the interests of the agent with those of the principal. In employment, employers (principal) may use piece rates/commissions, profit sharing, efficiency wages, performance measurement (including financial statements), the agent posting a bond, or the threat of termination of employment to align worker interests with their own.

==Overview==
The principal&#x27;s interests are expected to be pursued by the agent; however, when the interests of the agent and principal differ, a dilemma arises. The agent possesses resources such as time, information, and expertise that the principal lacks. At the same time, the principal does not have control over the agent&#x27;s ability to act in the agent&#x27;s own best interests. In this situation, the theory posits that the agent&#x27;s activities are diverted from following the principal&#x27;s interests and drive the agent to maximize the agent&#x27;s interests instead.

The principal and agent theory emerged in the 1970s from the combined disciplines of economics and institutional theory. There is some contention as to who originated the theory, with theorists Stephen Ross and Barry Mitnick both claiming authorship. Ross is said to have originally described the dilemma in terms of a person choosing a flavor of ice-cream for someone whose tastes they do not know (&quot;Ibid&quot;). The most cited reference to the theory, however, comes from Michael C. Jensen and William Meckling. The theory has come to extend well beyond economics or institutional studies to all contexts of information asymmetry, uncertainty and risk.

In the context of law, principals do not know enough about whether (or to what extent) a contract has been satisfied, and they end up with agency costs. The solution to this information problem—closely related to the moral hazard problem—is to ensure the provision of appropriate incentives so agents act in the way principals wish.

In terms of game theory, it involves changing the rules of the game so that the self-interested rational choices of the agent coincide with what the principal desires. Even in the limited arena of employment contracts, the difficulty of doing this in practice is reflected in a multitude of compensation mechanisms and supervisory schemes, as well as in critique of such mechanisms as e.g., Deming (1986) expresses in his Seven Deadly Diseases of management.

==Employment contract==

In the context of the employment contract, individual contracts form a major method of restructuring incentives, by connecting as closely as optimal the information available about employee performance, and the compensation for that performance. Because of differences in the quantity and quality of information available about the performance of individual employees, the ability of employees to bear risk, and the ability of employees to manipulate evaluation methods, the structural details of individual contracts vary widely, including such mechanisms as &quot;piece rates, [share] options, discretionary bonuses, promotions, profit sharing, efficiency wages, deferred compensation, and so on.&quot; Typically, these mechanisms are used in the context of different types of employment: salesmen often receive some or all of their remuneration as commission, production workers are usually paid an hourly wage, while office workers are typically paid monthly or semimonthly (and if paid overtime, typically at a higher rate than the hourly rate implied by the salary). The way in which these mechanisms are used is different in the two parts of the economy which Doeringer and Piore called the &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; sectors (see also dual labour market).

The secondary sector is characterised by short-term employment relationships, little or no prospect of internal promotion, and the determination of wages primarily by market forces. In terms of occupations, it consists primarily of low or unskilled jobs, whether they are blue-collar (manual-labour), white-collar (e.g., filing clerks), or service jobs (e.g., waiters). These jobs are linked by the fact that they are characterized by &quot;low skill levels, low earnings, easy entry, job impermanence, and low returns to education or experience.&quot; In a number of service jobs, such as food service, golf caddying, and valet parking jobs, workers in some countries are paid mostly or entirely with tips.

The use of tipping is a strategy on the part of the owners or managers to align the interests of the service workers with those of the owners or managers; the service workers have an incentive to provide good customer service (thus benefiting the company&#x27;s business), because this makes it more likely that they will get a good tip.

The issue of tipping is sometimes discussed in connection with the principal–agent theory. &quot;Examples of principals and agents include bosses and employees ... [and] diners and waiters.&quot; &quot;The &quot;principal–agent problem&quot;, as it is known in economics, crops up any time agents aren&#x27;t inclined to do what principals want them to do. To sway them [(agents)], principals have to make it worth the agents&#x27; while ... [in the restaurant context,] the better the diner&#x27;s experience, the bigger the waiter&#x27;s tip.&quot; &quot;In the ... language of the economist, the tip serves as a way to reduce what is known as the classic &quot;principal–agent&quot; problem.&quot; According to &quot;Videbeck, a researcher at the New Zealand Institute for the Study of Competition and Regulation[,] &#x27;[i]n theory, tipping can lead to an efficient match between workers&#x27; attitudes to service and the jobs they perform. It is a means to make people work hard. Friendly waiters will go that extra mile, earn their tip, and earn a relatively high income...[On the other hand,] if tipless wages are sufficiently low, then grumpy waiters might actually choose to leave the industry and take jobs that would better suit their personalities.&#x27;&quot;

As a solution to the principal–agent problem, though, tipping is not perfect. In the hopes of getting a larger tip, a server, for example, may be inclined to give a customer an extra large glass of wine or a second scoop of ice cream. While these larger servings make the customer happy and increase the likelihood of the server getting a good tip, they cut into the profit margin of the restaurant. In addition, a server may dote on generous tippers while ignoring other customers, and in rare cases harangue bad tippers.

===Non-financial compensation===
Part of this variation in incentive structures and supervisory mechanisms may be attributable to variation in the level of intrinsic psychological satisfaction to be had from different types of work. Sociologists and psychologists frequently argue that individuals take a certain degree of pride in their work, and that introducing performance-related pay can destroy this &quot;psycho-social compensation&quot;, because the exchange relation between employer and employee becomes much more narrowly economic, destroying most or all of the potential for social exchange. Evidence for this is inconclusive—Deci (1971), and Lepper, Greene and Nisbett (1973) find support for this argument; Staw (1989) suggests other interpretations of the findings.

Incentive structures as mentioned above can be provided through non-monetary recognition such as acknowledgements and compliments on an employee (agent) in place of employment. Research conducted by Crifo and Diaye (2004) mentioned that agents who receive compensations such as praises, acknowledgement and recognition help to define intrinsic motivations that increase performance output from the agents thus benefiting the principal.

Furthermore, the studies provided a conclusive remark that intrinsic motivation can be increased by utilising the use of non-monetary compensations that provide acknowledgement for the agent. These higher rewards, can provide a principal with the adequate methodologies to improve the effort inputs of the agent when looking at the principal agent theory through an employer vs employee level of conduct.

===Team production===
On a related note, Drago and Garvey (1997) use Australian survey data to show that when agents are placed on individual pay-for-performance schemes, they are less likely to help their coworkers. This negative effect is particularly important in those jobs that involve strong elements of &quot;team production&quot; (Alchian and Demsetz 1972), where output reflects the contribution of many individuals, and individual contributions cannot be easily identified, and compensation is therefore based largely on the output of the team. In other words, pay-for-performance increases the incentives to free-ride, as there are large positive externalities to the efforts of an individual team member, and low returns to the individual (Holmström 1982, McLaughlin 1994).

The negative incentive effects implied are confirmed by some empirical studies, (e.g., Newhouse, 1973) for shared medical practices; costs rise and doctors work fewer hours as more revenue is shared. Leibowitz and Tollison (1980) find that larger law partnerships typically result in worse cost containment. As a counter, peer pressure can potentially solve the problem (Kandel and Lazear 1992), but this depends on peer monitoring being relatively costless to the individuals doing the monitoring/censuring in any particular instance (unless one brings in social considerations of norms and group identity and so on). Studies suggest that profit-sharing, for example, typically raises productivity by 3–5% (Jones and Kato 1995, Knez and Simester 2001), although there are some selection issues (Prendergast).

===Empirical evidence===
There is however considerable empirical evidence of a positive effect of compensation on performance (although the studies usually involve &quot;simple&quot; jobs where aggregate measures of performance are available, which is where piece rates should be most effective). In one study, Lazear (1996) saw productivity rising by 44% (and wages by 10%) in a change from salary to piece rates, with a half of the productivity gain due to worker selection effects. Research shows that pay for performance increases performance when the task at hand is more repetitive, and reduces performance when the task at hand requires more creative thinking.

Furthermore, formulated from their studies that compensation tend to have an impact on performance as a result of risk aversion and the level of work that a CEO is willing to input. This showed that when the CEO returned less effort then the data correlated a pay level of neutral aversion based on incentives. However, when offered incentives the data correlated a spike in performance as a direct result.

Conclusively, their studies indicated business owner (principal) and business employees (agents) must find a middle ground which coincides with an adequate shared profit for the company that is proportional to CEO pay and performance. In doing this risk aversion of employee efforts being low can be avoided pre-emptively.

* Paarsch and Shearer (1996) also find evidence supportive of incentive and productivity effects from piece rates, as do Banker, Lee, and Potter (1996), although the latter do not distinguish between incentive and worker selection effects.
* Rutherford, Springer and Yavas (2005) find evidence of agency problems in residential real estate by showing that real estate agents sell their own houses at a price premium of approximately 4.5% compared to their clients&#x27; houses.
* Fernie and Metcalf (1996) find that top British jockeys perform significantly better when offered percentage of prize money for winning races compared to being on fixed retainers.
* McMillan, Whalley and Zhu (1989) and Groves et al. (1994) look at Chinese agricultural and industrial data respectively and find significant incentive effects.
* Kahn and Sherer (1990)find that better evaluations of white-collar office workers were achieved by those employees who had a steeper relation between evaluations and pay.
* Nikkinen and Sahlström (2004) find empirical evidence that agency theory can be used, at least to some extent, to explain financial audit fees internationally.
* There is very little correlation between performance pay of CEOs and the success of the companies they manage.

==Contract design==
Milgrom and Roberts (1992) identify four principles of contract design: When perfect information is not available, Holmström (1979) developed the Informativeness Principle to solve this problem. This essentially states that any measure of performance that (on the margin) reveals information about the effort level chosen by the agent should be included in the compensation contract. This includes, for example, Relative Performance Evaluation—measurement relative to other, similar agents, so as to filter out some common background noise factors, such as fluctuations in demand. By removing some exogenous sources of randomness in the agent&#x27;s income, a greater proportion of the fluctuation in the agent&#x27;s income falls under their control, increasing their ability to bear risk. If taken advantage of, by greater use of piece rates, this should improve incentives. (In terms of the simple linear model below, this means that increasing &quot;x&quot; produces an increase in &quot;b&quot;.)

However, setting incentives as intense as possible is not necessarily optimal from the point of view of the employer. The Incentive-Intensity Principle states that the optimal intensity of incentives depends on four factors: the incremental profits created by additional effort, the precision with which the desired activities are assessed, the agent&#x27;s risk tolerance, and the agent&#x27;s responsiveness to incentives. According to Prendergast (1999, 8), &quot;the primary constraint on [performance-related pay] is that [its] provision imposes additional risk on workers ...&quot; A typical result of the early principal–agent literature was that piece rates tend to 100% (of the compensation package) as the worker becomes more able to handle risk, as this ensures that workers fully internalize the consequences of their costly actions. In incentive terms, where we conceive of workers as self-interested rational individuals who provide costly effort (in the most general sense of the worker&#x27;s input to the firm&#x27;s production function), the more compensation varies with effort, the better the incentives for the worker to produce.

The third principle—the Monitoring Intensity Principle—is complementary to the second, in that situations in which the optimal intensity of incentives is high corresponds highly to situations in which the optimal level of monitoring is also high. Thus employers effectively choose from a &quot;menu&quot; of monitoring/incentive intensities. This is because monitoring is a costly means of reducing the variance of employee performance, which makes more difference to profits in the kinds of situations where it is also optimal to make incentives intense.

The fourth principle is the Equal Compensation Principle, which essentially states that activities equally valued by the employer should be equally valuable (in terms of compensation, including non-financial aspects such as pleasantness of the workplace) to the employee. This relates to the problem that employees may be engaged in several activities, and if some of these are not monitored or are monitored less heavily, these will be neglected, as activities with higher marginal returns to the employee are favoured. This can be thought of as a kind of &quot;disintermediation&quot;—targeting certain measurable variables may cause others to suffer. For example, teachers being rewarded by test scores of their students are likely to tend more towards teaching &#x27;for the test&#x27;, and de-emphasise less relevant but perhaps equally or more important aspects of education; while AT&amp;T&#x27;s practice at one time of paying programmers by the number of lines of code written resulted in programs that were longer than necessary—i.e., program efficiency suffering (Prendergast 1999, 21). Following Holmström and Milgrom (1990) and Baker (1992), this has become known as &quot;multi-tasking&quot; (where a subset of relevant tasks is rewarded, non-rewarded tasks suffer relative neglect). Because of this, the more difficult it is to completely specify and measure the variables on which reward is to be conditioned, the less likely that performance-related pay will be used: &quot;in essence, complex jobs will typically not be evaluated through explicit contracts.&quot; (Prendergast 1999, 9).

Where explicit measures are used, they are more likely to be some kind of aggregate measure, for example, baseball and American Football players are rarely rewarded on the many specific measures available (e.g., number of home runs), but frequently receive bonuses for aggregate performance measures such as Most Valuable Player. The alternative to objective measures is subjective performance evaluation, typically by supervisors. However, there is here a similar effect to &quot;multi-tasking&quot;, as workers shift effort from that subset of tasks which they consider useful and constructive, to that subset which they think gives the greatest appearance of being useful and constructive, and more generally to try to curry personal favour with supervisors. (One can interpret this as a destruction of organizational social capital—workers identifying with, and actively working for the benefit of, the firm – in favour of the creation of personal social capital—the individual-level social relations which enable workers to get ahead (&quot;networking&quot;).)

===Linear model===
The four principles can be summarized in terms of the simplest (linear) model of incentive compensation:

formula_1

where &quot;w&quot; (wage) is equal to &quot;a&quot; (the base salary) plus &quot;b&quot; (the intensity of incentives provided to the employee) times the sum of three terms: &quot;e&quot; (unobserved employee effort) plus &quot;x&quot; (unobserved exogenous effects on outcomes) plus the product of &quot;g&quot; (the weight given to observed exogenous effects on outcomes) and &quot;y&quot; (observed exogenous effects on outcomes). &quot;b&quot; is the slope of the relationship between compensation and outcomes.

formula_2

The above discussion on explicit measures assumed that contracts would create the linear incentive structures summarised in the model above. But while the combination of normal errors and the absence of income effects yields linear contracts, many observed contracts are nonlinear. To some extent this is due to income effects as workers rise up a tournament/hierarchy: &quot;Quite simply, it may take more money to induce effort from the rich than from the less well off.&quot; (Prendergast 1999, 50). Similarly, the threat of being fired creates a nonlinearity in wages earned versus performance. Moreover, many empirical studies illustrate inefficient behaviour arising from nonlinear objective performance measures, or measures over the course of a long period (e.g., a year), which create nonlinearities in time due to discounting behaviour. This inefficient behaviour arises because incentive structures are varying: for example, when a worker has already exceeded a quota or has no hope of reaching it, versus being close to reaching it—e.g., Healy (1985), Oyer (1997), Leventis (1997). Leventis shows that New York surgeons, penalised for exceeding a certain mortality rate, take less risky cases as they approach the threshold. Courty and Marshke (1997) provide evidence on incentive contracts offered to agencies, which receive bonuses on reaching a quota of graduated trainees within a year. This causes them to &#x27;rush-graduate&#x27; trainees in order to make the quota.

===Options framework===

In certain cases agency problems may be analysed by applying the techniques developed for financial options, as applied via a real options framework. Stockholders and bondholders have different objective—for instance, stockholders have an incentive to take riskier projects than bondholders do, and to pay more out in dividends than bondholders would like. At the same time, since equity may be seen as a call option on the value of the firm, an increase in the variance in the firm value, other things remaining equal, will lead to an increase in the value of equity, and stockholders may therefore take risky projects with negative net present values, which while making them better off, may make the bondholders worse off. Nagel and Purnanandam (2017) notice that since bank assets are risky debt claims, bank equity resembles a subordinated debt and therefore the stock&#x27;s payoff is truncated by the difference between the face values of the corporation debt and of the bank deposits. Based on this observation, Peleg-Lazar and Raviv (2017) show that in contrast to the classical agent theory of Michael C. Jensen and William Meckling, an increase in variance would not lead to an increase in the value of equity if the bank&#x27;s debtor is solvent.

==Performance evaluation==

===Objective===
The major problem in measuring employee performance in cases where it is difficult to draw a straightforward connection between
performance and profitability is the setting of a standard by which to judge the performance. One method of setting an absolute objective performance standard—rarely used because it is costly and only appropriate for simple repetitive tasks—is time-and-motion studies, which study in detail how fast it is possible to do a certain task. These have been used constructively in the past, particularly in manufacturing. More generally, however, even within the field of objective performance evaluation, some form of relative performance evaluation must be used. Typically this takes the form of comparing the performance of a worker to that of his peers in the firm or industry, perhaps taking account of different exogenous circumstances affecting that.

The reason that employees are often paid according to hours of work rather than by direct measurement of results is that it is often more efficient to use indirect systems of controlling the quantity and quality of effort, due to a variety of informational and other issues (e.g., turnover costs, which determine the optimal minimum length of relationship between firm and employee). This means that methods such as deferred compensation and structures such as tournaments are often more suitable to create the incentives for employees to contribute what they can to output over longer periods (years rather than hours). These represent &quot;pay-for-performance&quot; systems in a looser, more extended sense, as workers who consistently work harder and better are more likely to be promoted (and usually paid more), compared to the narrow definition of &quot;pay-for-performance&quot;, such as piece rates. This discussion has been conducted almost entirely for self-interested rational individuals. In practice, however, the incentive mechanisms which successful firms use take account of the socio-cultural context they are embedded in (Fukuyama 1995, Granovetter 1985), in order not to destroy the social capital they might more constructively mobilise towards building an organic, social organization, with the attendant benefits from such things as &quot;worker loyalty and pride (...) [which] can be critical to a firm&#x27;s success ...&quot; (Sappington 1991,63)

===Subjective===
Subjective performance evaluation allows the use of a subtler, more balanced assessment of employee performance, and is typically used for more complex jobs where comprehensive objective measures are difficult to specify and/or measure. Whilst often the only feasible method, the attendant problems with subjective performance evaluation have resulted in a variety of incentive structures and supervisory schemes. One problem, for example, is that supervisors may under-report performance in order to save on wages, if they are in some way residual claimants, or perhaps rewarded on the basis of cost savings. This tendency is of course to some extent offset by the danger of retaliation and/or demotivation of the employee, if the supervisor is responsible for that employee&#x27;s output.

Another problem relates to what is known as the &quot;compression of ratings&quot;. Two related influences—centrality bias, and leniency bias—have been documented (Landy and Farr 1980, Murphy and Cleveland 1991). The former results from supervisors being reluctant to distinguish critically between workers (perhaps for fear of destroying team spirit), while the latter derives from supervisors being averse to offering poor ratings to subordinates, especially where these ratings are used to determine pay, not least because bad evaluations may be demotivating rather than motivating. However, these biases introduce noise into the relationship between pay and effort, reducing the incentive effect of performance-related pay. Milkovich and Wigdor (1991) suggest that this is the reason for the common separation of evaluations and pay, with evaluations primarily used to allocate training.

Finally, while the problem of compression of ratings originates on the supervisor-side, related effects occur when workers actively attempt to influence the appraisals supervisors give, either by influencing the performance information going to the supervisor: multitasking (focussing on the more visibly productive activities—Paul 1992), or by working &quot;too hard&quot; to signal worker quality or create a good impression (Holmström 1982); or by influencing the evaluation of it, e.g., by &quot;currying influence&quot; (Milgrom and Roberts 1988) or by outright bribery (Tirole 1992).

==Incentive structures==

===Tournaments===
Much of the discussion here has been in terms of individual pay-for-performance contracts; but many large firms use internal labour markets (Doeringer and Piore 1971, Rosen 1982) as a solution to some of the problems outlined. Here, there is &quot;pay-for-performance&quot; in a looser sense over a longer time period. There is little variation in pay within grades, and pay increases come with changes in job or job title (Gibbs and Hendricks 1996). The incentive effects of this structure are dealt with in what is known as &quot;tournament theory&quot; (Lazear and Rosen 1981, Green and Stokey (1983), see Rosen (1986) for multi-stage tournaments in hierarchies where it is explained why CEOs are paid many times more than other workers in the firm). See the superstar article for more information on the tournament theory.

Workers are motivated to supply effort by the wage increase they would earn if they win a promotion. Some of the extended tournament models predict that relatively weaker agents, be they competing in a sports tournaments (Becker and Huselid 1992, in NASCAR racing) or in the broiler chicken industry (Knoeber and Thurman 1994), would take risky actions instead of increasing their effort supply as a cheap way to improve the prospects of winning.

These actions are inefficient as they increase risk taking without increasing the average effort supplied. Neilson (2007) further added to this from his studies which indicated that when two employees competed to win in a tournament they have a higher chance of bending and or breaking the rules to win. Nelson (2007) also indicated that when the larger the price (incentive) the more inclined the agent (employee in this case) is to increase their effort parameter from Neilson&#x27;s studies.

A major problem with tournaments is that individuals are rewarded based on how well they do relative to others. Co-workers might become reluctant to help out others and might even sabotage others&#x27; effort instead of increasing their own effort (Lazear 1989, Rob and Zemsky 1997). This is supported empirically by Drago and Garvey (1997). Why then are tournaments so popular? Firstly, because—especially given compression rating problems—it is difficult to determine absolutely differences in worker performance. Tournaments merely require rank order evaluation.

Secondly, it reduces the danger of rent-seeking, because bonuses paid to favourite workers are tied to increased responsibilities in new jobs, and supervisors will suffer if they do not promote the most qualified person. This effectively takes the factors of ambiguity away from the principal agent problem by ensuring that the agent acts in the best interest of the principal but also ensures that the quality of work done is of an optimal level.

Thirdly, where prize structures are (relatively) fixed, it reduces the possibility of the firm reneging on paying wages. As Carmichael (1983) notes, a prize structure represents a degree of commitment, both to absolute and to relative wage levels. Lastly when the measurement of workers&#x27; productivity is difficult, e.g., say monitoring is costly, or when the tasks the workers have to perform for the job is varied in nature, making it hard to measure effort and/or performance, then running tournaments in a firm would encourage the workers to supply effort whereas workers would have shirked if there are no promotions.

Tournaments also promote risk seeking behavior. In essence, the compensation scheme becomes more like a call option on performance (which increases in value with increased volatility (cf. options pricing). Each of the players competing for the asymmetrically large top prize may benefit from reducing the expected value of their overall performance to the firm in order to increase their chance to have outstanding performance and win the prize. In moderation this can offset the greater risk aversion of agents vs principals because their social capital is concentrated in their employer while in the case of public companies the principal typically owns its stake as part of a diversified portfolio. Successful innovation is particularly dependent on employees&#x27; willingness to take risks. In cases with extreme incentive intensity, this sort of behavior can create catastrophic organizational failure. If the principal owns the firm as part of a diversified portfolio this may be a price worth paying for the greater chance of success through innovation elsewhere in the portfolio. If however the risks taken are systematic and cannot be diversified e.g., exposure to general housing prices, then such failures will damage the interests of principals and even the economy as a whole (cf. Kidder Peabody, Barings, Enron, AIG to name a few). Ongoing periodic catastrophic organizational failure is directly incentivized by tournament and other superstar/winner-take-all compensation systems (Holt 1995).

===Deferred compensation===
Tournaments represent one way of implementing the general principle of &quot;deferred compensation&quot;, which is essentially an agreement between worker and firm to commit to each other. Under schemes of deferred compensation, workers are overpaid when old, at the cost of being underpaid when young. Salop and Salop (1976) argue that this derives from the need to attract workers more likely to stay at the firm for longer periods, since turnover is costly. Alternatively, delays in evaluating the performance of workers may lead to compensation being weighted to later periods, when better and poorer workers have to a greater extent been distinguished. (Workers may even prefer to have wages increasing over time, perhaps as a method of forced saving, or as an indicator of personal development. e.g., Loewenstein and Sicherman 1991, Frank and Hutchens 1993.) For example, Akerlof and Katz 1989: if older workers receive efficiency wages, younger workers may be prepared to work for less in order to receive those later. Overall, the evidence suggests the use of deferred compensation (e.g., Freeman and Medoff 1984, and Spilerman 1986—seniority provisions are often included in pay, promotion and retention decisions, irrespective of productivity.)

==Energy consumption==
The &quot;principal–agent problem&quot; has also been discussed in the context of energy consumption by Jaffe and Stavins in 1994. They were attempting to catalog market and non-market barriers to energy efficiency adoption. In efficiency terms, a market failure arises when a technology which is both cost-effective and saves energy is not implemented. Jaffe and Stavins describe the common case of the landlord-tenant problem with energy issues as a principal–agent problem. &quot;[I]f the potential adopter is not the party that pays the energy bill, then good information in the hands of the potential adopter may not be sufficient for optimal diffusion; adoption will only occur if the adopter can recover the investment from the party that enjoys the energy savings. Thus, if it is difficult for the possessor of information to convey it credibly to the party that benefits from reduced energy use, a principal/agent problem arises.&quot;

The energy efficiency use of the principal agent terminology is in fact distinct from the usual one in several ways. In landlord/tenant or more generally equipment-purchaser/energy-bill-payer situations, it is often difficult to describe who would be the principal and who the agent. Is the agent the landlord and the principal the tenant, because the landlord is &quot;hired&quot; by the tenant through the payment of rent? As Murtishaw and Sathaye, 2006 point out, &quot;In the residential sector, the conceptual definition of principal and agent must be stretched beyond a strictly literal definition.&quot;

Another distinction is that the principal agent problem in energy efficiency does not require any information asymmetry: both the landlord and the tenant may be aware of the overall costs and benefits of energy-efficient investments, but as long as the landlord pays for the equipment and the tenant pays the energy bills, the investment in new, energy-efficient appliances will not be made. In this case, there is also little incentive for the tenant to make a capital efficiency investment with a usual payback time of several years, and which in the end will revert to the landlord as property. Since energy consumption is determined both by technology and by behavior, an opposite principal agent problem arises when the energy bills are paid by the landlord, leaving the tenant with no incentive to moderate her energy use. This is often the case for leased office space, for example.

The energy efficiency principal agent problem applies in many cases to rented buildings and apartments, but arises in other circumstances, most often involving relatively high up-front costs for energy-efficient technology. Though it is challenging to assess exactly, the principal agent problem is considered to be a major barrier to the diffusion of efficient technologies. This can be addressed in part by promoting shared-savings performance-based contracts, where both parties benefit from the efficiency savings. The issues of market barriers to energy efficiency, and the principal agent problem in particular, are receiving renewed attention because of the importance of global climate change and rising prices of the finite supply of fossil fuels.

==Trust relationships==
The problem arises in client–attorney, probate executor, bankruptcy trustee, and other such relationships. In some rare cases, attorneys who were entrusted with estate accounts with sizeable balances acted against the interests of the person who hired them to act as their agent by embezzling the funds or &quot;playing the market&quot; with the client&#x27;s money (with the goal of pocketing any proceeds).

This section can also be explored from the perspective of the trust game which captures the key elements of principal–agent problems. This game was first experimentally implemented by Berg, Dickhaut, and McCabe in 1995. The setup of the game is that there are two players – trustor/principal (investor) and agents (investee). The trustor is endowed with a budget and can transfer some of the amounts to an agent in expectation of return over the transferred amount in the future. The trustee may send any part of the transferred amount back to the trustor. The amount transferred back by the trustee is referred to as trustworthiness. Most of the studies find that 45% of the endowment was transferred by the principal and around 33% transferred back by an agent. This means that investors are not selfish and can be trusted for economic transactions.

Trust within the principal-agent problem can also be seen from the perspective of an employer-employee relationship, whereby the employee (agent) has distrust in the employer (principal) which causes greater demotivation of the employee. It has been assumed that the principal having control in an organisational culture has benefits to for the organisation by creating greater productivity and efficiency. However it also entails some drawbacks that reduce the employee satisfaction such as reduced motivation, creativity, innovation and greater anxiety and stress.

==Personnel management==
When managing personnel in an organisational setting, the principal-agent problem surfaces when employees are hired to perform specific tasks and fulfil certain roles. In this environment, the goals of employee and employer may not be aligned. Often employees have the desire to further their own career or financial goals where employers often have the output interests of the organisation at the forefront of their actions and goals.

Employees may reveal the principal-agent problem in their work by slacking off and not meeting targets or KPIs and Employers may reveal the principal-agent problem by implementing damaging policies or actions that make the working environment unsustainable.

==Bureaucracy and public administration==
In the context of public administration, the principal–agent problem can be seen in such a way where public administration and bureaucrats are the agents and politicians and ministers are the principal authorities. Ministers in the government usually command by framing policies and direct the bureaucrats to implement the public policies. However, there can be various principal-agent problems in the scenario such as misaligned intentions, information asymmetry, adverse selection, shirking, and slippage.

There are various situations where the ambitions and goals of the principals and agents may diverge. For example, politicians and the government may want public administration to implement a welfare policy program but the bureaucrats may have other interests as well such as rent-seeking. This results in a lack of implementation of public policies, hence the wastage of economic resources. This can also lead to the problem of shirking which is characterized as avoidance of performing a defined responsibility by the agent.

The information asymmetry problem occurs in a scenario where one of the two people has more or less information than the other. In the context of public administration, bureaucrats have an information advantage over the government and ministers as the former work at the ground level and have more knowledge about the dynamic and changing situation. Due to this government may frame policies that are not based on complete information and therefore problems in the implementation of public policies may occur. This can also lead to the problem of slippage which is defined as a myth where the principal sees that agents are working according to the pre-defined responsibilities but that might not be the reality.

The problem of adverse selection is related to the selection of agents to fulfill particular responsibilities but they might deviate from doing so. The prime cause behind this is the incomplete information available at the desk of selecting authorities (principal) about the agents they selected. For example, the Ministry of Road and Transport Highways hired a private company to complete one of its road projects, however, it was later found that the company assigned to complete road projects lacked technical know-how and had management issues.

The principal-agent problem in the public sector arises when there is a disconnect between politicians and public servants and their goals and interests. Other reasons that this occurs is because of political interference, bureaucratic resistance and public accountability.

Political interference happens when the politicians try and influence the decisions of public servants or bureaucrats to try and push their own interests which ultimately leads to policies being warped.
Bureaucratic Resistance is when public servants are hesitant to implement the policies that have been proposed or agreed on, which ultimately causes policies to be implemented at a slow rate. Bureaucratic resistance may be due to lack of funding, resources or political support.

Public accountability also plays a role in how the principal-agent theory impacts the public sector. When sworn in, politicians and public servants are responsible for ensure that they act in the interest of the public that they represent or work for, however, due to budget and resourcing issues as well as lack of transparency trust in the public sector often falls and a major disconnect grows.

== Economic theory ==
In economic theory, the principal-agent approach (also called agency theory) is part of the field &quot;contract theory&quot;. In agency theory, it is typically assumed that complete contracts can be written, an assumption also made in mechanism design theory. Hence, there are no restrictions on the class of feasible contractual arrangements between principal and agent.

Agency theory can be subdivided in two categories: (1) In adverse selection models, the agent has private information about their type (say, their costs of exerting effort or their valuation of a good) &quot;before&quot; the contract is written. (2) In moral hazard models, the agent becomes privately informed &quot;after&quot; the contract is written. Hart and Holmström (1987) divide moral hazard models in the categories &quot;hidden action&quot; (e.g., the agent chooses an unobservable effort level) and &quot;hidden information&quot; (e.g., the agent learns their valuation of a good, which is modelled as a random draw by nature). In hidden action models, there is a stochastic relationship between the unobservable effort and the verifiable outcome (say, the principal&#x27;s revenue), because otherwise the unobservability of the effort would be meaningless. Typically, the principal makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the agent; i.e., the principal has all bargaining power. In principal–agent models, the agent often gets a strictly positive rent (i.e. their payoff is larger than their reservation utility, which they would get if no contract were written), which means that the principal faces agency costs. For example, in adverse selection models the agent gets an information rent, while in hidden action models with a wealth-constrained agent the principal must leave a limited-liability rent to the agent. In order to reduce the agency costs, the principal typically induces a second-best solution that differs from the socially optimal first-best solution (which would be attained if there were complete information). If the agent had all bargaining power, the first-best solution would be achieved in adverse selection models with one-sided private information as well as in hidden action models where the agent is wealth-constrained.

Contract-theoretic principal–agent models have been applied in various fields, including financial contracting, regulation, public procurement, monopolistic price-discrimination, job design, internal labor markets, team production, and many others.
From the cybernetics point of view, the Cultural Agency Theory arose in order to better understand the socio-cultural nature of organisations and their behaviours.

== Negotiation ==
In the negotiation problem, the principal commissions an agent to conduct negotiations on its behalf. The principal may delegate certain authority to the agent, including the ability to conclude negotiations and enter into binding contracts. The principal may consider and assign a utility to each issue in the negotiation. However, it is not always the case that the principal will explicitly inform the agent of what it considers to be the minimally acceptable terms, otherwise known as the reservation price. The successfulness of a negotiation will be determined by a range of factors. These include: the negotiation objective, the role of the negotiating parties, the nature of the relationship between the negotiating parties, the negotiating power of each party and the negotiation type. Where there are information asymmetries between the principal and agent, this can affect the outcome of the negotiation. As it is impossible for a manager to attend all upcoming negotiations of the company, it is common practice to assign internal or external negotiators to represent the negotiating company at the negotiation table. With the principal–agent problem, two areas of negotiation emerge:

# negotiations between the agent and the actual negotiating partner (negotiations at the table)
# internal negotiations, as between the agent and the principal (negotiations behind the table).

The principal-agent problem can arises in representative negotiations where the interests of the principal and the agent are misaligned. The principal cannot directly observe the agent&#x27;s efforts during the course of the negotiation. In such circumstances, this may lead to the agent employing negotiation tactics which are unfavourable to the principal, but which benefit the agent. Depending upon how the agent&#x27;s reward is determined, the principal may be able to effectively retain control over the agent. If the agent receives a fixed fee, the agent may nonetheless act in a manner that is inconsistent with the principal&#x27;s interests. The agent may adopt this strategy if they believe the negotiation is a one-shot game. The agent may adopt a different strategy if they account for reputational consequences of acting against the principal&#x27;s interests. Similarly, if the negotiation is a repeated game, and the principal is aware of the results of the first iteration, the agent may opt to employ a different strategy which more closely aligns with the interests of the principal in order to ensure the principal will continue to contract with the agent in the following iterations. If the agent&#x27;s reward is dependent upon the outcome of the negotiation, then this may help align the differing interests.

<text>48 Doris is one of the largest main belt asteroids. It was discovered on 19 September 1857 by Hermann Goldschmidt from his balcony in Paris.

To find a name for the object, Jacques Babinet of the Academy of Sciences created a shortlist and asked the geologist Élie de Beaumont to make the selection. De Beaumont chose Doris, after an Oceanid in Greek mythology. Since Doris was discovered on the same night as 49 Pales, de Deaumont suggested naming the two &quot;The Twins&quot;.

==Physical characteristics==
An occultation on 19 March 1981 suggested a diameter of 219±25 km. Observations of an occultation on 14 October 1999, using four well-placed chords, indicate an ellipsoid of 278×142 km and that 48 Doris is an extremely irregularly shaped object.

Doris will pass within 0.019 AU of Pallas in June 2132.

== In popular culture ==
48 Doris is a location in the text-based science fiction game Federation 2.

<text>49 Pales () is a large, dark main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by German-French astronomer Hermann Goldschmidt on 19 September 1857 from his balcony in Paris. The asteroid is named after Pales, the goddess of shepherds in Roman mythology. Since it was discovered on the same night as 48 Doris, geologist Élie de Beaumont suggested naming the two &quot;The Twins&quot;.

The orbit of this asteroid has close to a 2:1 commensurability with the orbit of Jupiter. On 17 January 2000, this minor planet was observed occulting a 9th magnitude star from seven locations. These timed chords across the silhouette allowed an estimate to be made of the object&#x27;s dimensions, yielding a cross-section of .

Pales has been studied by radar. It has a rotation period of and a lightcurve with an amplitude of 0.18 mag. The lightcurve shows 4 maxima and 4 minima per cycle, suggesting an irregular shape. The previously accepted period of 10.42 hours with 2 maxima and minima per cycle was proven to be wrong by Pilcher in 2016, showing that correct rotation periods still have not been found for all low-numbered asteroids.

<doc id="730745" wikidata="Q284810" url="?curid=730745" title="NXP ColdFire">
<text>The NXP ColdFire is a microprocessor that derives from the Motorola 68000 family architecture, manufactured for embedded systems development by NXP Semiconductors. It was formerly manufactured by Freescale Semiconductor (formerly the semiconductor division of Motorola) which merged with NXP in 2015.

==Instruction set==
The ColdFire instruction set is &quot;assembly source&quot; compatible (by means of translation software available from the vendor) and not entirely object code compatible with the 68000. When compared to classic 68k hardware, the instruction set differs mainly in that it no longer has support for the binary-coded decimal (BCD) packed data format; it removes a number of other, less used instructions; and most instructions that are kept support fewer addressing modes. Also, floating point intermediates are 64 bits and not 80 bits as in the 68881 and 68882 coprocessors. The instructions are only 16, 32, or 48 bits long, a simplification compared to the 68000 series.

==Models==
In February 1999, the μClinux project&#x27;s Linux kernel was ported to two ColdFire processors (MCF5206 and MCF5307). In 2006, the Debian project was looking into making its m68k port compatible with the ColdFires, as there are ColdFire models that can be clocked as high as 300 MHz. This is much faster than the 68060, which can officially reach 75 MHz and can be overclocked to 110 MHz. Stallion Technologies ePipe, Secure Computing SnapGear security appliances, and Arcturus Networks&#x27;s System on Module products are based on ColdFire processors. There are ColdFire Linux-based single-board computers (SBC) with Ethernet and CompactFlash as small as 23×55 mm or 45×45 mm or based on CompactFlash (37×43 mm) itself. ColdFire based products have even been deployed to the International Space Station as an electronic nose project.

There are five generations or versions of the ColdFire available from Freescale:
* v1: Intended to support migration from 8-bit microcontrollers, it is a cut-down version of the v2 processor-wise. It was launched in 2006, 12 years after the original ColdFire. It is designed to easily replace the 8-bit Freescale 68HC08 microcontrollers and compete with low-end ARM chips.
* v2: The original ColdFire core launched in 1994. Single-issue pipeline, no MMU, no FPU. Versions are also available with MAC and enhanced MAC units.
* v3: Added an optional MAC unit.
* v4: Limited superscalar core.
* v4e (or eV4 in some documents): Enhanced version of the v4, launched in 2000. Adds optional MMU, FPU, and enhanced MAC unit to the architecture.
* v5: Fully superscalar core.

There is also the Fido 1100, a microcontroller launched in 2007 aimed at predictable embedded control systems such as Industrial Ethernet applications using the 68k/CPU32 instruction set. However, Fido has its own unique architecture and shares the instruction set with 68k only.

In November 2006, Freescale announced that ColdFire microprocessor cores were available for license as semiconductor Intellectual Property through their IP licensing and support partner IPextreme Inc. ColdFire v1 core is now available under Free license (and no per use royalty) for Altera Cyclone-III FPGA&#x27;s.

In September 2007, Freescale launched the 32-bit Flexis microcontroller family with a ColdFire CPU core.

In June 2010, Freescale announced the ColdFire+ line, which is a ColdFire V1 core using a 90 nm TFS technology.

In 2010, Freescale also launched Kinetis, an ARM-based product line, leading some industry observers to speculate about the future of the ColdFire range, given that Freescale would have several competing CPU ranges.

<doc id="730749" wikidata="Q362021" url="?curid=730749" title="Eli (biblical figure)">
<text>Eli (, ; ; , 11th century BC) was, according to the Book of Samuel, a priest and a judge of the Israelites in the city of Shiloh, ancient Israel. When Hannah came to Shiloh to pray for a son, Eli initially accused her of drunkenness, but when she protested her innocence, Eli wished her well. Hannah&#x27;s eventual child, Samuel, was raised by Eli in the tabernacle. When Eli failed to rein in the abusive behavior of his own sons, God promised to punish his family, which resulted in the death of Eli&#x27;s sons at the Battle of Aphek where the Ark of the Covenant was also captured. When Eli heard the news of the captured Ark, he fell from his seat, broke his neck, and died. Later biblical passages mention the fortunes of several of Eli&#x27;s descendants.

Eli occupies a prominent place in Samaritan religious tradition, as the Samaritans attribute the schism between their community and the Jews to Eli&#x27;s establishment of a rival shrine at Shiloh, challenging what they regard as the original Israelite sacred site, Mount Gerizim.

==Biblical narrative==
Eli was a priest (&quot;kohen&quot;) of Shiloh, the second-to-last Israelite judge (succeeded only by Samuel) before the rule of the Kings of Israel and Judah.

===Hannah===
This story of Hannah, with which the Books of Samuel begin, involves Eli. Hannah was the wife of Elkanah. She was childless. Elkanah also had another wife (Peninnah) who bore him children. Peninnah, at every chance, teased and criticised Hannah about her barrenness, to the point of Hannah&#x27;s deep despair. Their husband Elkanah saw Hannah&#x27;s distress, and attempted to discover the cause of her distress by asking &quot;Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?&quot;

The story indicates that Hannah gave no answer to the questions, and instead rose and presented herself before God. She wept bitterly in the temple of Shiloh. In her despair, Hannah prayed to God for a child, and promising that if her prayer is granted, she would dedicate her son to God. When Eli found Hannah in the temple, she was praying silently with her lips moving. Eli witnessed this unusual behavior, and concluded that Hannah was intoxicated. After Hannah&#x27;s explanation of her sobriety, Eli said, &quot;Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have requested.&quot; Hannah went home, filled with hope. Subsequently, Hannah became pregnant; her child was named Samuel. At the time to offer the yearly sacrifice at the temple, Hannah remained home. She promised to go to the temple, when Samuel was weaned and planned to leave him with Eli to be trained as a Nazirite.

===The sons of Eli===

The sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, meanwhile, were behaving wickedly, for example by taking for themselves all the prime cuts of meat from sacrifices, and by committing adultery with the women who serve at the sanctuary entrance. Eli was aware of their behavior but he rebuked them too lightly and ultimately did not stop them. The sons continued in their sinful behavior, and &quot;a man of God&quot; prophesied to Eli that Eli and his family would be punished for this, with all male descendants dying before reaching old age and being placed in positions subservient to prophets from other lineages. The curse alludes to a previous promise from God of Eli&#x27;s lineage continuing eternally (Eli being a descendant of Aaron, to whom the promise was initially given ) (c.f. similar promises to King David and Jehonadab). While this continuation was not revoked, a curse was placed on all of Eli&#x27;s male descendants forever. As a sign of the accuracy of this future, Eli was told that his sons would die on the same day.

===Samuel&#x27;s training===
Eli went on to train Samuel. When Samuel heard God speaking to him, he at first mistook God for Eli; Eli, who didn&#x27;t hear God calling Samuel, eventually realized the truth, and instructed Samuel on how to respond. Samuel was told that God&#x27;s threat would be carried out on Eli and his family. Eli asked Samuel what he had been told, insisting that he be told the whole truth, and so Samuel did; Eli reacted by saying that God will do as He judges best.

===Philistine attack and the death of Eli===

Some years later, the Philistines attacked Eben-Ezer, eventually capturing the Ark of the Covenant from the Israelites and killing Eli&#x27;s sons who had accompanied the Ark to battle. The Israelites had brought the Ark with them to battle under the premise that it would bring them victory. Eli, who was nearly blind, was sitting at the front gate to hear the returning soldiers return and was unaware of the event until he asked about all the commotion in the city. A soldier had returned and brought the news of the battle to the people. In reaction to the news that the Ark of God had been captured, Eli fell backwards out of the chair and struck his head, whence he died.

He was a Judge of Israel for a total of 40 years. His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she heard the news that the Ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and husband were dead, she went into labour and gave birth, but was overcome by labour pains. As she lay dying, she named the boy Ichabod, saying &quot;The Glory has departed from Israel&quot;, because of the capture of the Ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.

===Era===

Samson, who fought the Philistine incursions, judged Israel for 20 years. Some scholars, like Kessler, and Nowack have argued that there is likely to have been some overlap between the time of Samson and that of Eli. However, the Book of Judges always mentions the years of oppression in contrast to the period of a judge&#x27;s dispensation; since the early parts of Eli&#x27;s rule do not appear to occur during a time of oppression, this appears to rule out any overlap with the Philistine oppression that Samson, a previous judge, had lived under.

===Genealogy===

Though his own genealogy is not given by the text, a number of scholars have determined that Eli was descended from Itamar son of Aaron, based on genealogies given elsewhere regarding his various descendants. Ahimelech belonged to the house of Itamar, and was also descended from Ahitub, who was descended from Eli.

===Descendants===
The House of Eli included:
*Ahimelech, great-grandson of Eli: slain by Doeg the Edomite, fulfilling part of the curse on the House of Eli that none of his male descendants would live to old age. 
*Abiathar, son of Ahimelech: great-great-grandson of Eli; the only survivor of the massacre at Nob, and the last High Priest of the House of Eli, deposed from office by King Solomon, thus fulfilling the other part of the curse on the House of Eli that the priesthood would pass from his family.

== In rabbinical literature ==

===Talmud===
The Talmud lists Eli as a prophet.

The rabbis described Samuel, Eli&#x27;s student, as having ruled that it was legitimate for laymen to slaughter sacrifices, since the halakha only insisted that the priests &quot;bring the blood&quot; (cf. , Zevahim 32a). Eli is said to have reacted to this logic of Samuel by arguing that it was correct, but Samuel should be put to death for making legal statements while Eli (his mentor) was present.

===Phineas/Ithamar controversy===

Rabbinical commentators explain that the continuity of high priesthood is put forth to the descendants of Phineas from . According to some rabbinical commentators, Phineas sinned by not providing Torah instruction to the masses prior to the Battle of Gibeah, and by failing to relieve Jephthah of his vow. As consequence, the &quot;high priesthood&quot; was taken from him and given (temporarily) to the offspring of Ithamar, specifically Eli and his sons.

However, upon the sin of Eli&#x27;s sons Hophni and Phinehas, it was prophesied that the high priesthood would be returned to a different priest who would be more loyal:
A number of scholars indicate that Zadok was the subject of this prophecy when Zadok, said to be of the progeny of Eleazar, was ultimately appointed as high priest.

===Descendants===
In addition to the individuals whose descent from Eli can be determined from the Biblical text, rabbinical literature cites other individuals as descendants of Eli.
*Jeremiah: it is suggested that Jeremiah was descended from Abiathar (When King Solomon thrust out Abiathar from the priesthood, he exiled him to his fields at Anathoth (1 Kings 2:26-27). Jeremiah was one of the priests living at Anathoth (Jeremiah 1:1), so this suggestion would seem quite reasonable).
*Rabbah bar Nahmani, Babylonian Jewish Talmudist (Amora).
*Abaye, Babylonian Jewish Talmudist, nephew of Rabbah bar Nahmani
*Bebai ben Abaye, Babylonian Jewish Talmudist, son of Abaye

Rabbah died at age 40 and his nephew Abaye died at age 60.

==Samaritan sources==
The Samaritans assert that Mount Gerizim was the original Holy Place of Israel from the time that Joshua conquered Israel and the ten tribes settled the land. According to the Bible, the story of Mount Gerizim takes us back to the story of the time when Moses ordered Joshua to take the Twelve Tribes of Israel to the mountains by Shechem and place half of the tribes, six in number, on the top of Mount Gerizim (Mount of the Blessing), and the other half in Mount Ebal (Mount of the Curse). The two mountains were used to symbolize the significance of the commandments and serve as a warning to whoever disobeyed them.

Abu l-Fath, who in the fourteenth century CE wrote a major work of Samaritan history, comments on Samaritan origins as follows:

Further, the Samaritan Chronicle Adler, or New Chronicle, believed to have been composed in the 18th century using earlier chronicles as sources states:

According to the Samaritans this marked the end of the Age of Divine Favor called רידון (Ridhwan) or רהוּתה (Rahuta), which began with Moses. Thus began the פנוּתה (Fanuta) Era of Divine Disfavor when God looks away from the people. According to the Samaritans the age of divine favor will only return with the coming of the Taheb (Messiah or Restorer).

Likewise according to Samaritan sources, the priestly line of the sons of Phineas died out in 1624 with the death of the 112th High Priest Shlomyah ben Pinhas, upon which the priesthood was transferred to the sons of Ithamar.

<text>The pound or lira ( &quot;Lira Yisra&#x27;elit&quot;, &quot;Junayh ʾIsrāʾīlī&quot;; abbreviation: IL in Latin, ל&quot;י in Hebrew; code ) was the currency of the State of Israel from 9 June 1952 until 23 February 1980. The Israeli pound replaced the Palestine pound and was initially pegged at par to £1 sterling. It was replaced by the shekel on 24 February 1980, at the rate of IS 1 = IL 10, which was in turn replaced by the new shekel in 1985.

Before the new currency was brought in, the Anglo-Palestine Bank issued banknotes denominated in Palestine pounds. They were in Hebrew (&quot;lira E.Y.&quot; i.e. &quot;lira Eretz-Yisraelit&quot;) and Arabic &quot;junayh filisṭīnī&quot; ().

On 1 May 1951, all the assets and liabilities of the Anglo Palestine Bank were transferred to a new company called Bank Leumi Le-Yisrael (Israel National Bank) and the currency name became: &quot;lira yisraelit&quot; () in Hebrew, &quot;junayh ʾisrāʾīlī&quot; in Arabic, and Israeli pound in English. The new currency was issued in 1952, and entered circulation on June 9. From 1955, after the Bank of Israel was established and took over the duty of issuing banknotes, only the Hebrew name was used.

==History==

The British Mandate of Palestine was created in 1918. In 1927 the Palestine Currency Board, established by the British authorities, and subject to the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, issued the Palestine pound (£P) which was legal tender in Mandate Palestine and Transjordan. £P1 was fixed at exactly £1 sterling. It was divided into 1,000 &quot;mils&quot;.

The Mandate came to an end on 14 May 1948, but the Palestine pound continued in circulation until new currencies replaced it. In Israel, the Palestine pound continued in circulation until the Israeli pound was adopted in 1952. The Israeli pound was subdivided into 1,000 prutot. The Israeli pound retained the Palestine pound&#x27;s sterling peg. In August 1948, new banknotes were issued by the London-based Anglo-Palestine Bank, owned by the Jewish Agency.

The new coins were the first to bear the new state&#x27;s name, and the banknotes had &quot;The Anglo-Palestine Bank Limited&quot; written on them. While the first coins minted by Israel were still denominated in &quot;mils&quot;, the next ones bore the Hebrew name &quot;prutah&quot; (). A second series of banknotes was issued after the Anglo-Palestine Bank moved its headquarters to Tel Aviv and became the Bank Leumi ( &quot;National Bank&quot;). The peg to sterling was abolished on 1 January 1954, and in 1960, the subdivision of the pound was changed from 1,000 prutot to 100 &quot;agorot&quot; (singular &quot;agora&quot;, ).

Because &quot;lira&quot; () was a loanword from Latin, a debate emerged in the 1960s over the name of the Israeli currency due to its non-Hebrew origins. This resulted in a law ordering the Minister of Finance to change the name from &quot;lira&quot; to the Hebrew name &quot;shekel&quot; (). The law allowed the minister to decide on the date for the change. The law came into effect in February 1980, when the Israeli government introduced the &#x27;Israeli shekel&#x27; (now called old Israeli shekel), at a rate of IL 10 = IS 1. On 1 January 1986, the old shekel was replaced by the Israeli new shekel at a ratio of IS1,000:₪1.

==Coins==
Israel&#x27;s first coins were aluminium 25 mil pieces, dated 1948 and 1949, which were issued in 1949 before the adoption of the pruta. Later in 1949, coins were issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 250 prutah. The coins were conceived, in part, by Israeli graphic designer Otte Wallish.

All coins and banknotes issued in Israel before June 1952 were part of the Palestine pound.

In 1960, coins were issued denominated in agora. There were 1, 5, 10 and 25 agorot pieces. In 1963, IL  and IL 1 coins were introduced, followed by IL 5 coins in 1978.

The IL 5 denomination had previously been used for non-circulating commemorative coins, including silver coins with a Hanukkah theme.

=== Mil (1949) ===
=== Pruta (1949–1960) ===
=== Agora (1960–1978) ===
==Banknotes==

In 1948, the government issued fractional notes for 50 and 100 mils. The Anglo-Palestine Bank issued banknotes for 500 mils, 1, 5, 10 and 50 pounds between 1948 and 1951. In 1952, the government issued a second series of fractional notes for 50 and 100 prutah with 250 prutah notes added in 1953. Also in 1952, the &quot;Bank Leumi Le-Israel&quot; took over paper money production and issued the same denominations as the Anglo-Palestine Bank except that the 500 mils was replaced by a 500 prutah note.

The Bank of Israel began note production in 1955, also issuing notes for 500 prutah, IL 1, IL 5, IL 10 and IL 50. In 1968, IL 100 notes were introduced, followed by IL 500 notes in 1975.

<text>Richard Henry Durrance (October 23, 1914 – June 13, 2004) was a 17-time national championship alpine ski racer and one of the first Americans to compete successfully against Europeans.

Durrance was born in Tarpon Springs, Florida, and moved with his family at age 13 in 1928 to Munich, Germany, where he learned to ski at nearby Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Durrance raced competitively in Germany and won the German Junior Alpine Championship in 1932 at age 17. The following year, he learned the newly developed parallel turn from Anton Seelos.

With the rise of Hitler, the family returned to the United States and he attended Dartmouth College in 1934 and won at Sestriere, Italy, the first American to dominate at a major European ski race. Durrance also won the U.S. men&#x27;s downhill, slalom, and combined events in 1937 and was named to the U.S. Olympic Team for the 1936 Winter Olympics, the first to include alpine skiing. The only medal event was the combined and Durrance finished tenth; eleventh in the downhill portion and eighth in the slalom. He was a three-time winner of the Harriman Cup in Sun Valley, Idaho, then held in the Boulder Mountains north of the resort, and helped cut the original trails on its Bald Mountain in the summer of 1939. Durrance was named to the 1940 Olympic team, but those games were cancelled due to World War II. In 1940, he worked as publicity photographer for Sun Valley and married ski racer Margaret &quot;Miggs&quot; Jennings.

In 1941, the Durrances bought and operated the lodge and lifts at fledgling Alta in Utah, near Salt Lake City. After training paratroopers to ski for the U.S. Army at Alta, the Durrances were expecting their first child. They moved to Seattle, where Dick worked for Boeing on in-flight camera recording equipment as a Flight Test Engineer, a job that lasted until 1945.

The Durrances then moved to Colorado to work in Denver for Thor Groswold, then the nation&#x27;s premier ski maker, to design and test Groswold skis. At the same time, Durrance contracted with Denver&#x27;s Ernest Constam, inventor of the J-bar and the T-bar ski lifts, to sell his conveyances in the West. Durrance sold his first T-bar to Aspen, a resort just then emerging as the first postwar ski area of note in the Rockies.

In 1947, Durrance was hired to manage the Aspen Skiing Company. The struggling company was turned around by Durrance, who brought the 1950 World Championships to Aspen, the first held outside of Europe. It put Aspen on the map and it is now one of the most popular ski resorts in the United States. He also produced a number of ski films and devoted most of his life to the promotion of skiing.

Durrance died of natural causes at age 89 on June 13, 2004, in Carbondale, Colorado, near Aspen. His wife Miggs died in November 2002; they were survived by their two sons, Dick, Jr. and Dave, and three grandchildren.

In its 75th anniversary issue in 2011, &quot;SKI&quot; magazine listed Durrance as the &quot;Skier of the Decade&quot; for the 1930s.

<text>Donepezil, sold under the brand name Aricept among others, is a medication used to treat dementia of the Alzheimer&#x27;s type. It appears to result in a small benefit in mental function and ability to function. Use, however, has not been shown to change the progression of the disease. Treatment should be stopped if no benefit is seen. It is taken by mouth or via a transdermal patch.
Donepezil is a centrally acting reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and structurally unrelated to other anticholinesterase agents. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping, aggression, diarrhea, feeling tired, and muscle cramps. Serious side effects may include abnormal heart rhythms, urinary incontinence, and seizures. 
Donepezil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 146th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===
There is no evidence that donepezil or other similar agents alter the course or progression of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Six-to-twelve-month controlled studies have shown modest benefits in cognition or behavior. The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends donepezil as an option in the management of mild to moderate Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The person should, however, be reviewed frequently and if there is no significant benefit it should be stopped. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved donepezil for treatment of mild, moderate and severe dementia in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

===Other===
* Lewy body dementia: Some studies have shown benefits of donepezil for the treatment of cognitive and behavioral symptoms in Lewy body dementia.
* Traumatic brain injury: Some research suggests an improvement in memory dysfunction in patients with traumatic brain injury with donepezil use.
* Vascular dementia: Studies have shown that donepezil may improve cognition in patients with vascular dementia but not overall global functioning.
* Dementia associated with Parkinson disease: Some evidence suggests that donepezil can improve cognition, executive function, and global status in Parkinson disease dementia.

== Adverse effects ==
In clinical trials the most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Other side effects included difficulty sleeping, muscle cramps and loss of appetite. Most side effects were observed in patients taking the 23 mg dose compared to 10 mg or lower doses. Side effects are mild and transient in most patients, lasting up to three weeks and usually improved even with continued use.

Donepezil, like other cholinesterase inhibitors, can cause nightmares due to enhanced activation of the visual association cortex during REM sleep. Dosing donepezil in the morning can reduce the frequency of nightmares.

===Precautions===
Donepezil should be used with caution in people with heart disease, cardiac conduction disturbances, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, severe cardiac arrhythmia and sick sinus syndrome.

People with peptic ulcer disease or taking NSAIDs should use with caution because increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was noted. Slow heart beat and fainting in people with heart problems were also seen. These symptoms may appear more frequent when initiating treatment or increasing the donepezil dose. Although occurrence of seizures is rare, people who have a predisposition to seizures should be treated with caution.

If daily donepezil has suspended for 7 days or less, restarting at the same dose is recommended, while if the suspension lasts longer than 7 days, retitrate from 5 mg daily is suggested.

== Mechanism of action ==
Donepezil binds and reversibly inhibits enzymes called cholinesterases, especially acetylcholinesterase, thus inhibiting hydrolysis of acetylcholine. This increases acetylcholine concentrations at cholinergic synapses.

The precise mechanism of action of donepezil in patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease is not fully understood. Certainly, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease involves a substantial loss of the elements of the cholinergic system and it is generally accepted that the symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease are related to this cholinergic deficit, particularly in the cerebral cortex and other areas of the brain.

In addition to its actions as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil has been found to act as a potent agonist of the σ1 receptor (Ki = 14.6 nM), and has been shown to produce specific antiamnestic effects in animals mainly via this action.

Some noncholinergic mechanisms have also been proposed. Donepezil upregulates the nicotinic receptors in the cortical neurons, adding to neuroprotective activity. It inhibits voltage-activated sodium currents reversibly and delays rectifier potassium currents and fast transient potassium currents, although this action is unlikely to contribute to clinical effects.

==Synergy==
Donepezil was claimed to act synergistically with an agent called FK962 [283167-06-6] &amp; FK960 [133920-70-4]. {potential activation of somatostatinergic neurotransmission} However, the development was discontinued after Phase II &quot;since the data reviewed did not indicate clear efficacy of the compound for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.&quot;

== Stereochemistry ==
Donepezil medications are racemates.
==History==

Research leading to the development of donepezil began in 1983, at Eisai, and in 1996, Eisai received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for donepezil under the brand &quot;Aricept&quot;, which it co-marketed with Pfizer. The team at Eisai was led by Hachiro Sugimoto.

As of 2011, Aricept was the world&#x27;s best-selling Alzheimer&#x27;s disease treatment. The first generic donepezil became available in November 2010, with the US FDA approval of a formulation prepared by Ranbaxy Labs.

==Research==
Donepezil has been tested in other cognitive disorders, including Lewy body dementia, and vascular dementia, but it is not currently approved for these indications. Donepezil has also been found to improve sleep apnea in people with Alzheimer&#x27;s. It also improves gait in people with mild Alzheimer&#x27;s.

Donepezil has also been studied in people with mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, post-coronary artery bypass surgery cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment associated with multiple sclerosis, CADASIL syndrome, and Down syndrome. A three-year National Institutes of Health trial in people with mild cognitive impairment reported donepezil was superior to placebo in delaying rate of progression to dementia during the initial 18 months of the study, but this was not sustained at 36 months. In a secondary analysis, a subgroup of individuals with the apolipoprotein E4 genotype showed sustained benefits with donepezil throughout the study. At this time, though, donepezil is not indicated for prevention of dementia.

=== Cognitive enhancement ===
Donepezil has shown mixed results for improving cognitive abilities in healthy individuals. A 2009 double-blind, placebo controlled study (n=24) investigating donepezil&#x27;s effects across a variety of memory tests in reported an improvement in spatial memory accuracy both before (90 minutes after dosing) and at theoretical Tmax (210 minutes after dosing). However, a later 2011 paper featuring two study double-blind, placebo controlled experiments evaluating donepezil&#x27;s effects in older but healthy subjects reported impairment after acute (5 hours after dose) and chronic (4 weeks) donepezil administration.

===ADHD===
The addition of donepezil with existing ADHD medications has shown mixed results. In those with Tourette syndrome and ADHD, donepezil may reduce tics while it had no effect on ADHD&#x27;s symptoms.

===Pervasive developmental disorder===
Donepezil, along with other cholinesterase inhibitors, is suggested as having potential for trouble behaviors: irritability, hyperactivity, and difficulty in social communication which are typically seen in those with pervasive developmental disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, and autism-spectrum disorder.

===Anorexia nervosa===
Donepezil is furthermore suggested as a feasible therapeutic option for anorexia nervosa. Emerging literature reports that a subset of patients suffering from restrictive anorexia nervosa have enhanced habit formation compared with healthy controls. Habit formation is modulated by striatal cholinergic interneurons. Based on the physiopathology of anorexia nervosa, namely in terms of cholinergic deficiencies, the effects of donepezil and other drugs that act as cholinesterase inhibitors could thus be effective in the treatment of the disorder. However, no trial to date supports this hypothesis.

<text>Private John Newman ( – 1838) was a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. He was born in Pennsylvania and was a member of captain Daniel Bissell&#x27;s company of the First Infantry Regiment. During the expedition in October 1804, he ran into disciplinary problems and was confined for &quot;having uttered repeated expressions of a highly criminal and mutinous nature.&quot; No records remain of the exact nature of his offense. He received a court-martial, and was sentenced to seventy-five lashes. In addition, he was removed from the expedition; however, since they were en route through the wilderness, he continued to travel with them to Fort Mandan. He performed hard labor and tried to redeem himself in the eyes of the two captains, but was sent back east with the return party in April 1805. After the expedition Lewis recommended that Congress grant Newman his pay for his period of service up to his expulsion; he received some pay and a land warrant as a member of the expedition. He settled in Missouri and was married at least once but appears to have had no children. In the 1830s he did some trapping in the Dakotas; he was killed by the Yankton Sioux in 1838.

Anderson is best known for his 1983 book &quot;Imagined Communities&quot;, which explored the origins of nationalism. A polyglot with an interest in Southeast Asia, he was the Aaron L. Binenkorb Professor of International Studies, Government &amp; Asian Studies at Cornell University. His work on the &quot;Cornell Paper&quot;, which disputed the official story of Indonesia&#x27;s 30 September Movement and the subsequent anti-Communist purges of 1965–1966, led to his expulsion from that country. He was the elder brother of the historian Perry Anderson.

== Biography ==
=== Background ===
Anderson was born on August 26, 1936, in Kunming, China, to an Irish and Anglo-Irish father and English mother. His father, James Carew O&#x27;Gorman Anderson, was an official with Chinese Maritime Customs. The family descended from the Anderson family of Ardbrake, Bothriphnie, Scotland, who settled in Ireland in the early 1700s. His mother&#x27;s family descended from Lancaster.

Anderson&#x27;s maternal grandfather Trevor Bigham was the Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police from 1914 to 1931. One of Anderson&#x27;s grandmothers, Lady Frances O&#x27;Gorman, belonged to the Gaelic Mac Gormáin clan of County Clare and was the daughter of the Irish Home Rule MP Major Purcell O&#x27;Gorman. Major Purcell O&#x27;Gorman was in turn the son of Nicholas Purcell O&#x27;Gorman who had been involved with the Republican Society of United Irishmen during the 1798 Rising, later becoming Secretary of the Catholic Association in the 1820s. Anderson also had roots in County Waterford through his O&#x27;Gorman side. Benedict Anderson took his middle names from the cousin of Major Purcell O&#x27;Gorman, Richard O&#x27;Gorman, who was one of the leaders of the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848.

=== California, Ireland and Cambridge ===
Anderson&#x27;s family moved to California in 1941 to avoid the invading Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War and then to Ireland in 1945. He studied at Eton College, where he won the Newcastle Scholarship, and went on to attend King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge, he became an anti-imperialist during the Suez Crisis, which influenced his later work as a Marxist and anti-colonialist thinker.

=== Southeast Asia studies ===
He earned a classics degree from Cambridge in 1957 before attending Cornell University, where he concentrated on Indonesia as a research interest and in 1967 received his Ph.D. in government studies. His doctoral advisor at Cornell was Southeast Asian scholar George Kahin.

The violence following the September 1965 coup attempt that led to Suharto taking power in Indonesia disillusioned Anderson, who wrote that it &quot;felt like discovering that a loved one is a murderer&quot;. Therefore, while Anderson was still a graduate student at Cornell, he anonymously co-wrote the &quot;Cornell Paper&quot; with Ruth T. McVey that debunked the official Indonesian government accounts of the abortive coup of the 30 September Movement and the subsequent anti-Communist purges of 1965–66. The &quot;Cornell Paper&quot; was widely disseminated by Indonesian dissidents. One of two foreign witnesses at the show trial of Communist Party of Indonesia general secretary Sudisman in 1971, Anderson published a translated version of the latter&#x27;s unsuccessful testimony. As a result of his actions, Anderson was in 1972 expelled from Indonesia and banned from reentering, a restriction that lasted until 1998 when Suharto resigned to be replaced by B. J. Habibie as president.

Anderson was fluent in many languages relevant to his Southeast Asian field, including Indonesian, Javanese, Thai and Tagalog, as well as the major European languages. After the American experience in the Vietnam War and the subsequent wars between Communist nations such as the Cambodian–Vietnamese War and the Sino-Vietnamese War, he began studying the origins of nationalism while continuing his previous work on the relationship between language and power.

Anderson is best known for his 1983 book &quot;Imagined Communities&quot;, in which he described the major factors contributing to the emergence of nationalism in the world during the past three centuries. Anderson defined a nation as &quot;an imagined political community [that is] imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign&quot;. Anderson was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1994. In 1998, Anderson&#x27;s return trip to Indonesia was sponsored by the Indonesian publication &quot;Tempo&quot;, and he gave a public speech in which he criticized the Indonesia opposition for &quot;its timidity and historical amnesia—especially with regard to the massacres of 1965–1966&quot;.

Anderson taught at Cornell until his retirement in 2002, when he became a professor emeritus of International Studies. After his retirement, he spent most of his time traveling throughout South East Asia. Anderson died in Batu, a hill town near Malang, Indonesia, in his sleep on December 13, 2015. According to close friend Tariq Ali, Anderson died of heart failure. He had been in the middle of correcting the proofs of his memoir &quot;A Life Beyond Boundaries,&quot; which had initially been published in Japanese translation. He was survived by two adopted sons of Indonesian origin.

== Key concepts ==

=== Imagined communities ===

Anderson is best known for his 1983 book, &quot;Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism&quot;, in which he examined how nationalism led to the creation of nations, or as the title puts it, imagined communities. In this case, an &quot;imagined community&quot; does not mean that a national community is fake, but rather refers to Anderson&#x27;s position that any community so large that its members do not know each another on a face-to-face basis must be imagined to some degree.

According to Anderson, previous Marxist and liberal thinkers did not fully appreciate nationalism&#x27;s power, writing in his book that &quot;Unlike most other isms, nationalism has never produced its own grand thinkers: no Hobbeses, Tocquevilles, Marxes or Webers.&quot; Anderson begins his work by bringing up three paradoxes of nationalism that he would address in the work:
# Nationalism is a recent and modern creation despite nations being thought of by most people as old and timeless;
# Nationalism is universal in that every individual belongs to a nation, yet each nation is supposedly completely distinct from every other nation;
# Nationalism is an idea so influential that people will die for their nations, yet at the same time an idea difficult to define.
In Anderson&#x27;s theory of nationalism, the phenomenon only came about as people began rejecting three key beliefs about their society: 
# That certain languages such as Latin were superior to others in respect to access to universal truths;
# That divine right to rule was granted to the rulers of society, usually monarchs, and was a natural basis for organizing society;
# That the origins of the world and the origins of humankind were the same.
Anderson argued that the prerequisites for the rejection of these beliefs began in Western Europe through the numerous factors that led to the Age of Enlightenment, such as the power of economics, the Scientific Revolution, and the advent of improvements in communication brought about by the invention of the printing press under a system of capitalism (or as Anderson calls it, print capitalism). Anderson&#x27;s view of nationalism places the roots of the notion of &quot;nation&quot; at the end of the 18th century when a replacement system began, not in Europe, but in the Western Hemisphere, when countries such as Brazil, the United States, and the newly freed Spanish colonies became the first to develop a national consciousness.

In contrast to other thinkers such as Ernest Gellner, who considered the spread of nationalism in connection with industrialism in Western Europe, and Elie Kedourie, who construed nationalism as a European phenomenon carried around the world by colonization, Anderson sees the European nation state as a response to the rise of nationalism in the European diaspora beyond the oceans, especially in the Western Hemisphere, which was then retransmitted to Africa and Asia through colonization. Anderson considers nation state building as an imitative and transportable action, in which new political entities were copying the model of the nation state. As Anderson sees it, the large cluster of political entities that sprang up in North America and South America between 1778 and 1838, almost all of which self-consciously defined themselves as nations, were historically the first such states to emerge and therefore inevitably provided the first real model of what such states should look like. According to Anderson, this phenomenon led to the rise of nations: communities that were limited by their borders and were sovereign. Anderson conceived nationalism as having come about in different &quot;waves.&quot;

=== Nationalism and print ===

Like other thinkers such as Marshall McLuhan in his &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot;, of particular importance to Anderson&#x27;s theory on nationalism is his stress on the role of printed literature and its dissemination. Thinkers like McLuhan, Elizabeth Eisenstein, and Anderson did not believe that nationalism came about because of a vaguely-defined &quot;European&quot; way of thinking, but because of the social, economic, and cultural practices associated with the rise of the printing press and the mass reproduction of printed material.

According to Anderson, &quot;the revolutionary vernacularizing thrust of capitalism&quot; was central to the creation of imagined communities, as the mass mechanical reproduction of printed works united people that would otherwise have found it difficult to imagine themselves as part of the same community, mainly because of extreme linguistic differences. With the advent of the printing press, languages became more stable and certain dialects became &quot;languages of power&quot; (such as the Queen&#x27;s English in the United Kingdom) that were inherently more prestigious than sub-regional vernacular dialects. Print capitalism also meant a culture in which people were required to be socialized as part of a literate culture, in which the standardized language of their nation became both the language of printed material and education for the masses.

Fellow nationalism scholar Steven Kemper described the role of print technology in Anderson&#x27;s theory as making it &quot;possible for enormous numbers of people to know of one another indirectly, for the printing press [to] become the middleman to the imagination of the community.&quot; Kemper also stated that for Anderson the &quot;very existence and regularity of newspapers caused readers, and thus citizens-in-the-making, to imagine themselves residing in a common time and place, united by a print language with a league of anonymous equals.&quot; Therefore, for Anderson, the rise of print technology was essential to create the &quot;deep horizontal comradeship&quot; that despite its socially constructed origins, was also genuine and deep-seated, explaining why nationalism can drive people to fight, die, and kill for their countries.

=== Multi-ethnic empires ===
Anderson also studied how the 19th century European dynasties that represented retention of power over huge polyglot domains, underwent naturalization at the same time as they developed programs of official nationalism in a process that he called the &quot;willed merger of nation and dynastic empire&quot;. Anderson considered the empire as solely a pre-modern, &quot;dynastic realm&quot; and focused his attention on the official nationalism in multiethnic empires (e.g. the Russian Official Nationality), programs that he described as &quot;reactionary, secondary modelling&quot;. Whereas previously the legitimacy of European dynasties had nothing to do with nationalness, Anderson argued that after the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian empires in the aftermath of World War I, the nation-state superseded the empire as the norm in international affairs, as demonstrated by how delegates from the imperial powers in the post-war League of Nations were careful to present themselves as national delegates instead of imperial ones.

<text>The HP-20S (F1890A) is an algebraic programmable scientific calculator produced by Hewlett-Packard from 1987 to 2000.

A member of HP&#x27;s Pioneer series, the 20S was a low cost model targeted at students, using the same hardware as the HP-10B business calculator. Compared with the higher-end 32S and 42S scientific calculators, the 20S includes much more basic functionality. As a student calculator, it also uses infix notation rather than the Reverse Polish notation found in more well-known models of the series.

Despite these limitations, the 20S is keystroke programmable, supporting up to 99 program lines of fully merged instructions and ten memory registers.

== Hardware ==

Introduced at the 1989 Consumer Electronics Show, the HP 20S had an initial retail price of 50 USD. Introduced simultaneously was the HP-10B, based on the same hardware but targeting the business calculator market. The retail price set a new bar for HP, who credited their delivery of a low-price product to tight integration between their research, development and manufacturing departments.

The 20S has the same physical form factor and 37-key keypad as other models in the Pioneer series. The CPU is an HP Saturn (Bert) chip clocked at 640 kHz. With only 256 bytes of RAM, the 20S is at the bottom end of the HP Pioneer range.

While higher end scientific models in the Pioneer series were fitted with dot-matrix displays that allowed their functionality to be organized into menus (the 22S, 32S and 42S being examples), the 20S has only a more primitive 12-digit seven-segment display. Advanced functionality is therefore accessed by a pair of shift keys, with almost every key on the keypad assigned secondary and tertiary functions.

The initial design used blue and orange shift keys, but a visual refresh in 1999 changed the color scheme to green and purple.

== Critical evaluation ==

A 1994 evaluation of contemporary calculators criticized some of the features and quirks of the HP 20S. Some points of criticism included:

* The fact that using the calculator&#x27;s statistics functions will overwrite several recall registers that are reused for statistics functions.
* Calculating large factorials can cause an overflow that produces the wrong result.
* Only limited support for complex numbers; while a built-in program is included for complex number manipulation, performing a more basic operation such as formula_1 produces an error.

Despite these criticisms, the same source had praise for the calculator&#x27;s accuracy (rounding errors produced by other calculators did not occur), and for the quality of the HP 20S user manual.

== Program library ==

The 20S contained six preloaded programs in ROM for common mathematical operations. These programs could be loaded to RAM and used and edited as user programs.

*A- [ROOT] finder, finds a root of f(x)=0
*B- [INT] integral, calculates definite integral using Simpson method
*C- [CPL] complex numbers manipulations
*D- [3 by 3] matrix manipulations and line equations solver
*E- [qUAD] quadratic equation solver
*F- [fit] curve fitting, using exponential, logarithmic and power functions

The program library was used by HP as a key feature for advertising the 20S.

== HP-21S ==

The HP 21S is a variant of the 20S designed specifically for statistical calculations. HP&#x27;s stated goal in releasing the 21S was to eliminate the need for statistics tables, just as the HP-35 had previously eliminated for trigonometric and log tables.

The majority of the features of the 20S are still present, including keystroke programming support and the typical trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential functions found on most scientific calculators. However, the 21S has several features specifically to support statistical analysis:

* Probability and distribution: factorial, permutation and combination functions.
* Two variable statistical calculations 
* Random number generation
* The built-in library contains statistical programs that differ to the programs included with the 20S.

To accommodate the extra functionality, the 21S sacrifices some of the 20S&#x27;s functionality; specifically it does not support base arithmetic and unit conversions, along with hyperbolic functions.

=== Libraries ===

* A - [1-StAt]: One Sample Test Statistics
* B - [2-StAt]: Two Sample Test Statistics
* C - [Lr-StAt]: Linear Regression Test Statistics
* D - [CHI-2]: Chi-Square Test Statistics
* E - [bin]: Binomial Probability Distribution
* F - [FinAnCE]: Time value of money

<text>The Symmetrix system was an EMC&#x27;s enterprise storage array. It combined dozens of hard drives into a single virtual device that was then directly attached to a computer or I/O channel, or shared on a storage area network or a local area network. It was the flagship product of EMC in the 1990s and 2000s.

== History ==
Symmetrix arrays, EMC&#x27;s flagship product at that time, began shipping in 1990 as a storage array connected to an IBM mainframe via the block multiplexer channel. Newer generations of Symmetrix brought additional host connection protocols which include ESCON, SCSI, Fibre Channel-based storage area networks (SANs), FICON and iSCSI. The Symmetrix product was initially popular within the airline industry and with companies that were willing to deviate from the safety of IBM&#x27;s 3390 disk subsystem and take a risk with the unproven Symmetrix array.

This product is the main reason for the rapid growth of EMC in the 1990s, both in size and value, from a company valued hundreds of millions of dollars to a multi-billion company. Moshe Yanai managed the Symmetrix development from the product&#x27;s inception in 1987 until shortly before leaving EMC in 2001, and his Symmetrix development team grew from several people to thousands.

=== Symmetrix VMAX ===
EMC Symmetrix VMAX systems are storage platforms intended for open systems and mainframe computing. Symmetrix VMAX systems run the Enginuity operating environment.

== Models ==


The Direct Matrix Architecture (DMX) product line with models DMX800, DMX1000 and DMX2000 were announced in February 2003.

=== Specifications ===
The system scales from a single Symmetrix VMAX Engine system with one storage bay to a large eight-engine system with a maximum of ten storage bays.

The Symmetrix VMAX system bay can hold one to eight engines. These engines house the hardware for all the data processing capabilities. Each engine contains two director boards, memory chips, and front-end (FE) and back-end (BE) ports for connectivity to hosts and storage bays, respectively.

Each director board contains two Intel quad-core processors for data processing, 16, 32 or 64 GB of physical memory, one System Interface Board (SIB) that connects the director to the Matrix Interface Board Enclosure (MIBE), front-end and back-end ports.

The VMAX has one to ten storage bays for hard drives. Each storage bay contains 16 Disk Array Enclosures (DAE). Each DAE contains 15-25 hard drives. VMAX supports SATA, Fiber Channel, SAS and Solid State drives.

== Features ==
===Symmetrix Remote Data Facility===
The &quot;Symmetrix Remote Data Facility&quot; (&quot;SRDF&quot;) is a family of software products that facilitates the data replication from one Symmetrix storage array to another through a storage area network or Internet Protocol (IP) network.

SRDF logically pairs a device or a group of devices from each array and replicates data from one to the other synchronously or asynchronously. An established pair of devices can be split, so that separate hosts can access the same data independently (maybe for backup), and then be resynchronised.

In synchronous mode (SRDF/S), the primary array waits until the secondary array has acknowledged each write before the next write is accepted, ensuring that the replicated copy of the data is always as current as the primary. However, the latency due to propagation increases significantly with distance.

Asynchronous SRDF (SRDF/A) transfers changes made to the secondary array in units called delta sets, which are transferred at defined intervals. Although the remote copy of the data will never be as current as the primary copy, this method can replicate data over considerable distances and with reduced bandwidth requirements and minimal impact on host performance.

Other forms of SRDF integrate with clustered environments and to manage multiple SRDF pairs where replication of multiple devices must be consistent (such as with the data files and log files of a database application).

===Other features===
* TimeFinder, TimeFinder/Clone — Local Replication
* Symmetrix Optimizer—Dynamical swap disks based on workload
* Symmetrix command line interface (SymmCli)
* SymmWin, Enginuity—Symmetrix GUI console (since Symm3, Symm4 models)
* AnatMain — Symmetrix Pseudo-GUI console (before Symm 3, Symm4 models)

<text>The HP-42S RPN Scientific is a programmable RPN Scientific hand held calculator introduced by Hewlett-Packard in 1988. It is a popular calculator designed for science and engineering students.

==Overview==
Perhaps the HP-42S was to be released as a replacement for the aging HP-41 series as it is designed to be compatible with all programs written for the HP-41. Since it lacked expandability, and lacked any real I/O ability, both key features of the HP-41 series, it was marketed as an HP-15C replacement.

The 42S, however, has a much smaller form factor than the 41, and features many more built-in functions, such as a matrix editor, complex number support, an equation solver, user-defined menus, and basic graphing capabilities (the 42S can draw graphs only by programs). Additionally, it features a two-line dot matrix display, which made stack manipulation easier to understand.

Production of the 42S ended in 1995.

==Specifications==

* Series: Pioneer
* Code Name: Davinci
* Introduction: 1988-10-31
* 64 KB of ROM
* 8 KB of RAM
* Functions: Over 350
* Expandability: Officially no other than IR printing (32 KB memory upgrade and over-clocking hardware hacks are possible)
* Peripherals: HP 82240A infrared printer

==Features==
*All basic scientific functions (including hyperbolic functions)
*Statistics (including curve fitting and forecasting)
*Probability (including factorial, random numbers and Gamma function)
*Equation solver (root finder) that can solve for any variable in an equation
*Numerical integration for calculating definite integrals
*Matrix operations (including a matrix editor, dot product, cross product and solver for simultaneous linear equations)
*Complex numbers (including polar coordinates representation)
*Vector functions
*Named variables, registers and binary flags
*Graphic display with graphics functions and adjustable contrast
*Menus with submenus and mode settings (also custom programmable) that use the bottom line of the display to label the top row of keys
*Sound (piezoelectric beeper)
*Base conversion, integer arithmetic and binary and logic manipulation of numbers in binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal systems
*Catalogs for reviewing and using items stored in memory
*Programmability (keystroke programming with branching, loops, tests and flags)
*The ability to run programs written for the HP-41C series of calculators

==Programming==
The HP-42S is keystroke-programmable, meaning that it can remember and later execute sequences of keystrokes to solve particular problems of interest to the user. The HP-42S uses a superset of the HP-41CX FOCAL language.

All programs are stored in one continuous program space, and may be created and edited by switching to programming mode, using the key.
Subroutines are enclosed in /Label (name of subroutine) and /Return ( halts execution unless it is in a subroutine in which case it returns to the caller). Keystrokes (of functions) are enclosed between and or .

In a running program, a &quot;label&quot; causes program execution to branch to the specified label and continue running at that line.Executing a GTO instruction from the keyboard moves the program pointer to the corresponding label. No program lines are executed.

 is used in much the same way with one important difference: after an instruction has transferred execution to the specified label, the next RTN (return) or END instruction causes the program to branch back to the instruction that immediately follows the XEQ instruction.Programs/Subroutines can also be executed with the help &quot;label&quot; (Execute) key.
Important difference is that executes the label and returns to previous subroutine and continues execution from the line following ,whereas branches to the label specified and doesn&#x27;t return.

 packs the current subroutines and moves to new program space.&quot;nnnn&quot; can be used to reach a particular line of program.

=== Programming examples===
A simple program to calculate area of circle
Program instructions like , , halt the program execution,which can be continued by pressing .

 is used to view contents of a register,For example R in the above example.

=== Using Integral and Equation Solver ===
It is necessary to write a program or subroutine that evaluates f(x) for the function which needs to be solved or integrated.
Variables used in program should be declared using 

Here is a sample program to solve the equation °F = (9/5×°C) + 32
After, accessing the solver using ( ), select program .

In a similar way, expressions can be integrated. After selecting the variable of integration, enter the lower limit and then press on , similarly input (upper limit) and (accuracy).

==Emulators==

HP 42s can be accessed through Android Emulators like Emu42 and Free42.

<doc id="730774" wikidata="Q3922570" url="?curid=730774" title="Professional Indoor Football League (1998)">
<text>The Professional Indoor Football League (PIFL) was the second league to successfully play indoor football as a paid pro-league sport, after the Arena Football League (AFL). Since the AFL had a patent given in 1990 on the gameplay of &quot;Arena Football&quot; (mainly the endzone nets), the PIFL played with mostly the same rules, but without the endzone nets. The PIFL only lasted one season (1998) under that name.

==History==
The PIFL was started by Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Suess. Suess was deeply involved in football on the semi-pro and minor league level, and was editor–publisher of the &quot;Minor League Football News&quot;. In 1996, he began shopping around the idea of the PIFL, an indoor league created from the top minor league programs around the country. The league was finally formed in late 1997 and began its first season in 1998. The league offices were located in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The PIFL was rife with problems from the start. The Colorado Wildcats changed coaches during the preseason. By the third game, many teams were in serious financial trouble and started forfeiting games. The Minnesota Monsters folded after Week 5. Many other teams missed payrolls and this resulted in many players, including some of the best players, quitting.

In 1999, the PIFL essentially &quot;split&quot; into two leagues. Keary Ecklund, owner of the Green Bay Bombers and Madison Mad Dogs, took his two teams and form the Indoor Football League. On January 4, 1999, the remaining teams of the PIFL renamed the league to the Indoor Professional Football League.

==1998 PIFL season==

===Teams===
===Standings===
* Minnesota folded after starting 1-4 on the season. PF/PA are for four official games actually played; the other game, which was Minnesota&#x27;s lone victory, was ruled a forfeit awarded to Honolulu and the points were not counted in standings.
* Texas folded after starting 2-8 on the season. PF/PA are for nine games played.
* Utah forfeited their last game of the season to Madison. PF/PA are for 13 games played.
* Win totals for other teams include seven forfeited games by Minnesota and three forfeited games by Texas.
* Standings do not include exhibition games played by any of the teams.

===Playoffs===
August 7, 1998 — # 3 Green Bay Bombers 19 at # 2 Madison Mad Dogs 46

August 9, 1998 — # 4 Colorado Wildcats* 51 at # 1 Louisiana Bayou Beast 67 (at Riverside Centroplex)

&quot;* Colorado&#x27;s trip to Louisiana was paid for by the owners of the Bayou Beast&quot;

====Championship Game====
August 15, 1998 — #2 Madison Mad Dogs 41 at #1 Louisiana Bayou Beast 42 (at Pete Maravich Assembly Center)
===Award winners===
Following the championship game, the Professional Indoor Football League held an on-the-field awards ceremony. Those honored were as follows:

*Most Valuable Player – Melvin Hill, QB, Louisiana Bayou Beast
*Offensive Player of the Year – Jay McDonagh, QB, Green Bay Bombers
*Defensive Player of the Year - Derric Coakley, DE, Green Bay Bombers
*Coach of the Year – Buford Jordan, Louisiana Bayou Beast
*Executive of the Year – James Shiver, Sr., Louisiana Bayou Beast

The Professional Indoor Football League earlier announced its 1998 All-Star teams as chosen by the PIFL coaches. The Green Bay Bombers lead the list with five first team selections, including top vote getter quarterback Jay McDonagh. He was joined on the offensive first team by teammates Chris Perry and Heath Garland (both receivers), Louisiana&#x27;s Michael Lewis (WR), Chris Cloud (center) and Matt Huerkamp (kicker), Colorado&#x27;s Rob Satterly (offensive line) and Utah&#x27;s Matt Meservy (OL). Green Bay, Colorado and Madison each placed a pair of players on the defensive first team.

==Lawsuit with the Arena Football League==

In February 1998, the Arena Football League sued the PIFL for allegedly infringing its trademarks, copyrights and patent. The PIFL answered and denied the Arena Football League&#x27;s allegations. Late in June 1998, the Arena Football League filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction before Judge Harry Leinenweber in Federal Court in the Northern District of Illinois. The Motion was set for hearing on July 21, 1998. On July 20, 1998, the PIFL and its league members filed their response, which included video tapes and other evidence refuting the Arena Football League&#x27;s allegations. On July 22, 1998, the day after receiving the PIFL&#x27;s legal papers, the Arena Football League withdrew its Motion for Preliminary Injunction in a lawsuit in Federal Court in Chicago. This ended the Arena Football League&#x27;s efforts to challenge the practices of any competing professional &quot;indoor&quot; football league and clarified that its patent essentially applied to its end zone rebound nets, not any and all efforts to play American football indoors.

On November 12, 1998, The Professional Indoor Football League (PIFL) and the Arena Football League reached a settlement agreement in the lawsuit brought by the Arena Football League against the PIFL for patent infringement. As part of the settlement, all present and future PIFL teams have agreed to honor the patents, trademarks, copyrights and net structure of the Arena Football League, and in return the Arena Football League has withdrawn its motion to seek a restraining order to prevent the PIFL from playing its games. Additionally, the PIFL has agreed to use the following disclaimer, &quot;PIFL and its teams are not affiliated, sponsored or associated with the Arena Football League or any of its member teams&quot;, on all official publications. Professional Indoor Football League Commissioner Mike Storen stated, &quot;The Professional Indoor Football League is happy to acknowledge the uniqueness of the Arena Football League&#x27;s patented net system and method of play on the basis that this settlement will allow the Professional Indoor Football League to expand in an orderly fashion.&quot;

==PIFL European Division==
The PIFL proposed European Division was set to kick off in November 1998 with teams in England and Ireland. A six-team tournament was planned for August 22, 1998 in Manchester, England. Terry Smith was the PIFL European League Director and was the head coach of the Great Britain Spartans. The Spartans were a very successful European minor American football club, trying to move up to the pro level. The Spartans played two exhibition games in the US on April 27, 1998, at the Madison Mad Dogs and on April 29, 1998, at the Green Bay Bombers. They lost both games, 12–29 to Madison and 34–55 to Green Bay. The proposed European Division never started play.

<text>Clariion (styled CLARiiON) is a discontinued SAN disk array manufactured and sold by EMC Corporation, it occupied the entry-level and mid-range of EMC&#x27;s SAN disk array products. In 2011, EMC introduced the EMC VNX Series, designed to replace both the Clariion and Celerra products.

Upon launch in 2008, the latest generation CX4 series storage arrays supported fibre channel and iSCSI front end bus connectivity. The fibre channel back end bus offered 4 Gbit/s of bandwidth with FC-SCSI disks or SATAII disks.

The EMC Celerra NAS device is based on the same X-blade architecture as the CLARiiON storage processor.

The first CLARiiON was developed in 1992 by Data General Corporation, one of the first minicomputer companies. CLARiiON was an early commercial example of a RAID product and initially sold exclusively as an array with the company&#x27;s Aviion line of computer systems as the HADA (High Availability Disk Array) and later the HADA II before being made available for broader open systems attachment and renamed CLARiiON in 1994. Realizing the enormous potential of storage arrays, Data General created a separate Clariion division and began selling the product as an OEM offering to its systems competitors. While this somewhat lessened the advantages of Aviion in the marketplace, and was a source of internal corporate friction, it allowed the company to sell higher volumes and popularize the brand. The strategy paid dividends as the company was acquired by EMC in 1999, primarily for the CLARiiON line of products.

In 2011, EMC introduced the new VNX series of unified storage disk arrays intended to replace both CLARiiON and Celerra products. Internally the VNX is labeled the CX5. In early 2012, both CLARiiON and Celerra were discontinued.

==History==
The Clariion disk array project started in the early 1990s when Tom West (the protagonist of the Pulitzer Prize winning book &quot;The Soul of a New Machine&quot;) convinced Data General to develop the array. West realized the potential for more advanced and openly compatible data-storage devices, as did competitors such as Digital Equipment Corporation with their StorageWorks product.

Patented in 1994, the Clariion disk array had some interesting features that later became standard in the data-storage and computing industry. Features mentioned in the patent paperwork included optional hot swapping, guide rails for proper electrical contact, and a method to lock the drives in place once they were secured in the disk enclosure. Other notable features include industry&#x27;s first dual active-controller design, mirrored write cache, full system redundancy and hot repair.

The Clariion line was soon extended to contain SCSI disk arrays ranging from 7 to 30 slots. In 1997, Data General&#x27;s Clariion division took the unusual step of adopting an emerging standard — Fibre Channel. The FC5000 array utilized a Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop connection that doubled the performance of SCSI arrays at that time. It was also the first to use RAID level 5 on Fibre Channel drives.

From there, the Clariion range grew into a faster, more expandable midrange storage platform, culminating in the FC5700 under Data General. After EMC&#x27;s acquisition of Data General, significant development of a new range of Clariion arrays took place, resulting in the FC4500 and FC4700. A special model was the IP4700, offering IP-based access to storage.

Within a couple of years, the first CX series of Clariions (CX200, CX400 and CX600) was developed. Subsequent processor and bandwidth upgrades led to a new CX lineup (CX300, CX500, CX700) and a low end SATA based Clariion array, the AX100 (now updated to AX150). In 2003, Clariion became the industry&#x27;s first NEBS-certified storage system.

In May 2006, EMC introduced the third generation of Clariion, named &quot;CX3 UltraScale&quot;. The lineup, consisting of the CX3-20, CX3-40 and CX3-80, was the industry&#x27;s only storage platform to leverage end-to-end 4 Gbit/s (4 billion bits per second) Fibre Channel and PCI-Express technologies. Later in 2007, the line was expanded to include a new entry-level storage system, the CX3-10.

Most newer Clariion models up to the CX-4 run a version of Windows XP Embedded.

==Architecture==
The Clariion is built on an Intel platform and has quite unique software layer: it runs two operating environments in parallel. Windows XP Embedded or stripped-down version of Windows Server for management and maintenance tasks and proprietary UNIX-based FLARE as an actual &quot;data mover&quot;. Embedded Windows (in the fourth generation this is 64-bit Windows Storage Server, the third generation used 32-bit Windows XP). The form factor is a half-width 1U or 2U device known as an X-blade, two of which are mounted side by side in the storage processor enclosure. This provides a fully redundant active-active configuration, with both storage processors serving requests and each acting as failover for the other so that initiators see the array as active-passive. An integrated UPS provides security for data in the event of power failure.

Storage is fibre-attached, initiators may be fibre- or IP-attached, the architecture supports both on the same array depending on configuration. Storage is connected via back-end loops with up to 120 drives per loop, the drives are contained in Disk Array Enclosures (DAEs) of 15 drives each.

The operating environment, FLARE (Fibre Logic Array Runtime Environment), resides on the first four disks of the first DAE (bus 0 enclosure 0), which is also supplied by the integrated UPS. In the event of power failure, this space is also used to store the contents of the write cache so that all writes are completed on restoration of power.

Management of the Clariion is usually through inbuilt Java-based management software called Navisphere.

With the fourth generation UltraFlex series, I/O is provided through pluggable modules providing either IP or fibre connectivity, allowing additional back-end and front-end connections to be added over the life of the array.

Advanced functionality of the Clariion is licensed and enabled through software. This includes SAN replication, Quality of service (QOS) and snapshots.

===Unique issues===
The CLARiiON was a dual controller active/passive array, meaning that it had a mirrored write cache, but only one controller was actively serving requests for any single LUN presented to initiators.
This could cause issues with unsuspecting clients, one path would always appear dead. Accesses to it would trigger a reassignment of the LUN to the other controller, a so-called trespass.
This had severe implications on IO performance, and on older models like the 4500 models, this could cause a controller to crash if the system was directly (loop) attached to multiple IO-heavy hosts.
The second controller would then take over the load from the first one, crash due to the additional LUN trespasses. By this time, the first controller comes up and is missing a partner to sync to.
At this point, some LUNs could end up with no controller responsible for them, so-called unassigned LUNs.

Crashes were uncommon when the use of FC fabrics become common place, but the general issue of trespassing lived on until a certain firmware (FLARE) level with ALUA support was released, ca. 2008.

==Product lineup==

===AX series===

The AX series is considered the entry-level disk array.

Currently, two models are available the AX4 and the AX150.
The AX150 supports up to 12 Serial ATA disks with either 250, 500 or 750 GB (1 GB = 109 B) at a throughput of 150 (250 GB disks) or 300 MB/s (500, 750 GB disks) and, optionally, NCQ. Supported RAID levels are RAID 5 (with min. 3 disks) and RAID 1/0 (min. 4 disks). The Fibre Channel connection supports transfer speeds of up to 2 Gbit/s (with both AL and SW configurations), iSCSI is physically limited to max. 1 Gbit/s. The AX150 is available in four configurations which differ in connection and number of controllers.

The AX4 is the successor of the AX150 and can support up to 60 Serial ATA or Serial Attached SCSI disks (with &quot;Expansion Pack&quot;). The base version has only place for 12 disks. Similar to the AX150 it is available in iSCSI or Fibre Channel configurations. Opposed to the AX150 the AX4 supports Fibre Channel transfer speeds of up to 4 Gbit/s.

===CX series===
The CX series supports both SATA and Fibre Channel disks. Supported RAID levels are 1/0, 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6; the disks can be configured into groups with different RAID levels.

Models of the CX series come in two configurations: Fibre Channel (transfer speeds max. 2 Gbit/s) and iSCSI (max. 1 Gbit/s). The exception is the CX700, which is FC only. The names of the iSCSI models end with an &quot;i&quot;, &quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;CX500i&quot;.

===CX3 series===
The CX3 series originally consisted of CX3-20, CX3-40, and CX3-80 models. Later the series was refreshed to include the CX3-10 and the &quot;i&quot; and &quot;f&quot; identifiers.

===CX4 UltraFlex series===
The CX4 UltraFlex series contains multiple models which differ in the maximum number of disks (SATA or Fibre Channel) and the number of iSCSI and FC connections. The PCI Express connection between the FC interface and the storage processor allows transfer speeds of up to 4 Gbit/s, while iSCSI supports speeds of max. 1 Gbit/s. All current models support RAID 0, 1, 1/0, 3, 5, and 6; as with the CX series, groups with differing RAID levels can be created.

Each CX4 array consists of dual redundant hot-swappable components including storage processors, mirrored cache and battery backup, as well as redundant power supplies. The CX4 series supports Fibre Channel and iSCSI host connectivity.

Major New Features in the CX4 UltraFlex Series include support for solid state flash drives, 64-bit FLARE Operating Environment and PCI-Express based SLIC I/O cards. The CX4-480 and CX-960 support fibre channel solid state flash drives introduced by EMC for the Symmetrix DMX-4 in January 2008. Solid State Flash drives offer a significant performance advantage over mechanical drives and provide a new storage tier which EMC calls Tier-0. The new version of the FLARE operating environment that ships with the CX4 series includes support for the 64-bit Intel Xeon CPUs in the Storage Processors. The CX4 Series is also the first product to use the new PCI Express based SLIC I/O cards. The product-agnostic SLIC I/O cards provide more flexibility for future upgrades as new technologies become available, such as 8 GBit Fibre Channel and 10 GBit Ethernet/iSCSI.

<doc id="730779" wikidata="Q2165507" url="?curid=730779" title="Ron O'Neal">
<text>Ron O&#x27;Neal (September 1, 1937 – January 14, 2004) was an American actor, director and screenwriter, who rose to fame in his role as Youngblood Priest, a New York City cocaine dealer, in the blaxploitation film &quot;Super Fly&quot; (1972) and its sequel &quot;Super Fly T.N.T.&quot; (1973). O&#x27;Neal was also a director and writer for the sequel, and for the film &quot;Up Against the Wall&quot;.

==Early life==
Ron O&#x27;Neal grew up in a working-class neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio, to parents Eunice and Ernest O&#x27;Neal, a former jazz musician who earned his living as a factory worker. Ernest died when Ron was 16 years old. Six months later his brother, who worked as a truck driver, was killed in an accident. Following these tragedies his mother found a job in a hospital to sustain the family. Ron graduated from Glenville High School and attended Ohio State University, where he became interested in acting after seeing the play &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;. He joined the Karamu House company in Cleveland, Ohio, working with the oldest African-American theatre company in the United States from 1957 until 1964, during which period he appeared in plays such as &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;, &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; and &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot;, while working as a housepainter to earn his living. In 1964, he went to New York, teaching acting classes at the Harlem Youth Arts Program and appearing in Off-Broadway plays.

==Career==
In 1969, he appeared in the Broadway play &quot;Ceremonies in Dark Old Men&quot;.

That same year, he acted in Charles Gordone&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;No Place to Be Somebody&quot;, he garnered even more attention, winning an Obie Award and several other prizes.

From there, he moved on to cinema with two minor roles in &quot;Move&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Organization&quot; (1971), after which he was contacted by a friend from Cleveland, screenwriter Phillip Fenty, who suggested he star in an all-black film about a drug dealer. Although shot on a meager budget, the film, &quot;Super Fly&quot; (1972), went on to become a major hit at the box office.

The success of that film led to a sequel, &quot;Super Fly T.N.T.&quot; (1973), which O&#x27;Neal himself directed, and in which he reprised his role as Youngblood Priest. Nevertheless, the movie was a box office failure. Afterward, he was frequently typecast as pimp or drug dealer.

In 1975, he acted in on Broadway, replacing another actor, in &quot;All Over Town&quot; under the direction of Dustin Hoffman. He also appeared in Shakespeare plays during the 1970s, including &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;.

During those years, film roles that went beyond stock characters were few and far between, notable exceptions being his roles in &quot;Brothers&quot; (1977), the television movie &quot;Brave New World&quot; (1980), and the miniseries &quot;The Sophisticated Gents&quot; (1981). He had a number of television guest appearances, frequently playing detective roles. He played a recurring role as police detective, Isadore Smalls, in the TV series &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, which ran for three seasons in the mid-1980s and starred British actor, Edward Woodward. He played the primary antagonist, the Cuban Colonel Ernesto Bella, in 1984&#x27;s &quot;Red Dawn&quot;. In 1988, O&#x27;Neal had a recurring role as Mercer Gilbert on the popular NBC television sitcom &quot;A Different World&quot;, playing the wealthy father of the spoiled southern belle Whitley Gilbert (Jasmine Guy). His appearances lasted through 1992. In 1996, he appeared in the blaxploitation reunion film &quot;Original Gangstas&quot;.

==Personal life ==
O&#x27;Neal was first married to actress Carol Tillery Banks, from November 1973 until 1980 (divorced), and then to Audrey Pool, from 1993 until his death in 2004.

==Death==
O&#x27;Neal died in Los Angeles on January 14, 2004, after a four-year battle with pancreatic cancer, on the same day &quot;Super Fly&quot; was released on DVD in the United States.

The Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; includes a song titled &quot;Ron O&#x27;Neal&quot;.

<doc id="730781" wikidata="Q2481694" url="?curid=730781" title="Sally Brown">
<text>Sally Brown is a fictional character in the comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; by Charles Schulz. She is the younger sister of main character Charlie Brown. She was first mentioned in May 1959 and throughout a long series of strips before her first appearance in August 1959. Cathy Steinberg was the first to voice Sally in 1965 for the CBS special &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;; she was five years old at the time.

==History==
Sally was born on May 26, 1959, with Charlie Brown receiving a telephone call from the hospital and dashing out of the house yelling that he had a new baby sister. She was given the name &quot;Sally&quot; on June 2, 1959. Although Sally was often talked about and was the cause for a celebration that included Charlie Brown passing out chocolate cigars, it was not until August 23, 1959, that she finally made her first appearance in the strip.

Like other characters, such as Linus and Schroeder (who were also introduced to the strip as babies), Sally grew up quickly. The week of August 22, 1960, she took her first steps, and developed a lasting crush on Linus.

Sally went to kindergarten for the first time in a three-week sequence from August 20 to September 7, 1962. 

It was originally Linus who expressed a possible romantic interest in Sally. In a strip appearing shortly after Sally&#x27;s birth, Linus is seen scribbling calculations on a fence. When Charlie Brown wanders by, Linus asks him, &quot;When I&#x27;m 22 and Sally is 17, do you think she&#x27;ll go out with me?&quot;

In a storyline which began on November 29, 1965, Sally was diagnosed with amblyopia ex anopsia (lazy eye) which required her to wear an eye patch for a while. 

In September 1974, Sally started talking to her school building, expressing her fears and concerns about going to school. The building would answer back in thought bubbles, although Schulz&#x27;s intention was that Sally could not hear these replies.

The character of Sally had not been in the original production of &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;. In the revival Sally replaced Patty (not to be confused with the later character Peppermint Patty) who had long since disappeared from the comic strip. Sally was most recently played by Milly Shapiro in the 2016 revival of &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man Charlie Brown&quot;.

<text>Green Darkness is a 1972 novel by Anya Seton. It spent six months on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list and became her most popular novel.

==Plot summary==
In the 1960s, young Celia Marsdon is a rich American heiress who, upon her marriage to English aristocrat Richard Marsdon, goes to live at an ancestral manor in Sussex, England. Shortly afterward, strange things begin to occur — Richard begins acting out of character, and Celia starts to have strange fits and visions. Celia&#x27;s mother, Lily Taylor, has befriended a Hindu guru, Dr. Akananda, and it is he who discovers what&#x27;s wrong with the young couple. The troubles of the present time can only be solved by revisiting a tragedy from the past.

The book then moves back in time to the reign of Edward VI, as lovely young Celia de Bohun and her guardian aunt take up residence with the noble Catholic family of Anthony Browne as &quot;poor relations.&quot; Celia is a fascinating and believable character, full of contradictions and human failings. She is headstrong and impulsive; innocent but coquettish; and can easily attract male attention. She creates a scandal when she becomes infatuated with the family chaplain, Stephen Marsdon, who in turn desires Celia but does not want to break his vow of chastity. They are forced to part, but never forget each other. Time passes; King Edward dies and his persecution of Catholics ends, only to be followed by his successor Queen Mary I&#x27;s persecution of Protestants; the Browne family fortunes prosper under the Marian reign; and sympathetic characters harden into detestable ones. When Celia and Stephen finally meet again, nothing can stop the passion between them. It ends tragically. The Tudor story and the narrative returns to the 1960s to find resolution in the present and lay to rest the tormented souls of Stephen and Celia so that Richard and his wife can live together happily without visions of their past lives coming between them.

==Historical background==
The Manor House setting in &quot;Green Darkness&quot; at Ightham Mote was faithfully replicated at Cape Elizabeth, Maine by Charles Henry Robinson. It was named &#x27;Hidden Court&#x27; and can still be seen .

The Spread Eagle Inn and Cowdray House are real places in Midhurst, West Sussex, England, as is St Ann&#x27;s Hill, where Midhurst Castle once stood.

== Reception ==
&quot;Green Darkness&quot; was reviewed by &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;.

<doc id="730791" wikidata="Q718947" url="?curid=730791" title="Fujiwara no Yorinaga">
<text>was a Japanese statesman and a member of the Fujiwara clan who was highly significant in determining the course of 12th century Japanese political history.

==Early life==
Born in 1120, Yorinaga had a turbulent youth. He later wrote that he did not listen to his elders and would spend most of his time roaming through the country, hawking and hunting - he said he still bore the scars of these expeditions at the time of writing. Despite this, he did proceed to begin studying, particularly the classics of Chinese literature and Confucianism, as well as Indian logic. He read little or no native Japanese works, however, and was later notable for never composing a poem in Japanese. 
He was the favourite son of his father, Tadazane.

==Career==
Yorinaga ascended quickly through the political ranks, achieving the formidable office of Minister of the Right (Udaijin) by the age of 17. In 1150, he was appointed Minister of the Left, or Sadaijin, the highest rank under the Chancellor and the Regent himself. He married his daughter to Emperor Konoe in the same year.

Yorinaga was a determined defender of the Fujiwara Regency, known for his courageous and obstinate opposition to the &#x27;new men&#x27; of the Insei system, though he appreciated the necessity of reforming the Regency. He implemented various political reforms during his career: for example, during his term as Sadaijin he reviewed defunct Court practices and observations, viewing them as a deplorable lapse in officials&#x27; discipline.

He was known for being overly firm and direct, even impetuous. The Gukanshō termed him as the finest scholar in Japan, but possessed of rash temperament. Some scholars have suggested that this was due to his lack of knowledge of Japanese literature and hence of native sentiment – his attitude was at odds with that of the easygoing Heian court.
His opponents called him the Aku Safu, or &#x27;Wicked Minister of the Left&#x27;, due to his passionate reform and strength of character.

Konoe&#x27;s death in 1155 resulted in a hard-fought succession dispute. Yorinaga and his brother, Tadamichi, were divided over the issue. Bifukumon-In asserted her daughter&#x27;s right to the Throne, but Japanese society was no longer accepting of a female sovereign, and nothing resulted from the claim. Tadamichi was triumphant, and the Emperor Toba&#x27;s son, Go-Shirakawa, succeeded to the Throne. Yorinaga then asked to tutor the heir apparent, a reasonable request given his academic standing, but was denied.

==Hogen Insurrection==
Both of them insulted by Go-Shirakawa&#x27;s faction, Yorinaga joined with Sutoku, one of Toba’s other sons, in opposition to him. Successfully gathering several hundred soldiers from adjacent provinces, they marched on the capital. They successfully captured the city and readied defences to repel a counter-attack. Go-Shirakawa had the support of the two foremost warrior clans of the day, the Minamoto and the Taira – consequently, his forces vastly outnumbered those of Yorinaga and Sutoku. The ensuing battle took place during the night. After heavy fighting, Yorinaga and Sutoku&#x27;s defensive position was destroyed by fire. Yorinaga was killed, along with fifty of Sutoku&#x27;s important supporters. The rest of their allies surrendered.

This defeat symbolised the true end of the Fujiwara&#x27;s power over the capital and the rise of the warrior clans. It had been they who decided the outcome of the succession dispute, and their importance would only continue to grow for the next several centuries.

==Family==
He had two sons: Fujiwara no Moronaga (1138–1192), who served as Daijo-daijin, and Fujiwara no Kanenaga (1138–1158).

He also adopted the daughter of Fujiwara no Kin&#x27;yoshi, Fujiwara no Masuko.

== Sexuality ==

He had a physical relationship with many aristocratic men such as Fujiwara no Narichika, and recorded it in a diary called the &quot;Taiki&quot;, a copy of which is held at the Historiographical Institute of the University of Tokyo.

<text>50 Virginia is a large, very dark main belt asteroid. It was discovered by American astronomer James Ferguson on October 4, 1857, from the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. German astronomer Robert Luther discovered it independently on October 19 from Düsseldorf, and his discovery was announced first.

The reason for Virginia&#x27;s name is not known; it may be named after Verginia, the Roman noblewoman slain by her father, but it may alternatively have been named after the American state of Virginia.

Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico, during 2008 gave a light curve with a period of 14.315 ± 0.001 hours and a brightness variation of 0.19 ± 0.02 in magnitude. The shape of the light curve at the maximum was found to change with phase angle.

The orbit of 50 Virginia places it in an 11:4 mean motion resonance with the planet Jupiter. The computed Lyapunov time for this asteroid is only 10,000 years, indicating that it occupies a chaotic orbit that will change randomly over time because of gravitational perturbations of the planets.

Virginia has been studied by radar.

<text>An organizationally unique identifier (OUI) is a 24-bit number that uniquely identifies a vendor, manufacturer, or other organization.

OUIs are purchased from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Registration Authority by the &quot;assignee&quot; (IEEE term for the vendor, manufacturer, or other organization). Only assignment from MA-L registry assigns new OUI. They are used to uniquely identify a particular piece of equipments through derived identifiers such as MAC addresses, Subnetwork Access Protocol protocol identifiers, World Wide Names for Fibre Channel devices or vendor blocks in EDID.

In MAC addresses, the OUI is combined with a 24-bit number (assigned by the &quot;assignee&quot; of the OUI) to form the address. The first three octets of the address are the OUI.

== Representation and formatting conventions ==
The following terms are defined (either implicitly or explicitly) in IEEE Standard 802-2001 for use in referring to the various representations and formats of OUIs and the identifiers that may be created using them.

=== Hexadecimal representation ===

“The representation of a sequence of octet values in which the values of the individual octets are displayed in order from left to right, with each octet value represented as a two-digit hexadecimal numeral, and with the resulting pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by hyphens. The order of the hexadecimal digits in each pair, and the mapping between the hexadecimal digits and the bits of the octet value, are derived by interpreting the bits of the octet value as a binary numeral using the normal mathematical rules for digit significance.” (See hexadecimal).

=== Canonical format ===

“The format of a MAC data frame in which the octets of any MAC addresses conveyed in the MAC user data field have the same bit ordering as in the Hexadecimal Representation.” (See MAC data frame, MAC addresses)

=== Significance order ===

This appears from the context of the IEEE Standard 802-2001 to be another term for the &#x27;Hexadecimal Representation&#x27; – i.e., “by interpreting the bits of the octet value as a binary numeral using the normal mathematical rules for digit significance.”

=== Bit-reversed representation ===

“The representation of a sequence of octet values in which the values of the individual octets are displayed in order from left to right, with each octet value represented as a two-digit hexadecimal numeral, and with the resulting pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by colons. The order of the hexadecimal digits in each pair, and the mapping between the hexadecimal digits and the bits of the octet value, are derived by reversing the order of the bits in the octet value and interpreting the resulting bit sequence as a binary numeral using the normal mathematical rules for digit significance.”

The bit-reversed representation corresponds to the convention of transmitting the least-significant-bit of each byte first in serial data communications.

=== Noncanonical representation ===

“The format of a MAC data frame in which the octets of MAC addresses conveyed in the MAC user data field have the same bit ordering as in the Bit-reversed representation.”

=== Transmission order ===

The order in which an octet or a sequence of octets is transmitted over the transmission medium – this order normally corresponds to the bit-reversed representation.

Example:

An OUI consisting of the hexadecimal digits ACDE4816 would be represented as follows:

The following figure shows the position of these bits in significance order:

 | OUI |
 | Octet 0 | Octet 1 | Octet 2 |
 | nibble | nibble | nibble |
 | __||__ | __||__ | __||__ |
 | 0 || 1 | 2 || 3 | 4 || 5 |
 |bits||bits|bits||bits|bits||bits|
 |7654||3210|7654||3210|7654||3210|
 | A C | D E | 4 8 |
 |1010 1100|1101 1110|0100 1000|
 | | || | least-significant-bit of OUI
 | | || least-significant-byte of OUI
 | | |least-significant-bit of first octet of OUI = I/G or M bit
 | | next-to-least-significant-bit of first octet of OUI = U/L or X bit
 | most-significant-byte of OUI
 most-significant-bit of OUI

Notes:
# The OUI of AC-DE-48 could be in use and is not a reserved value.
# &#x27;F&#x27; and &#x27;h&#x27; represent any hexadecimal number.
# &#x27;c&#x27; represents the digits of the OUI, and &#x27;e&#x27; represents the digits of the extension identifier supplied by the organization to whom the OUI is registered.

===Potential for confusion in token ring===

Ethernet users are used to seeing canonical form, such as in the output of the ifconfig command. Canonical form is the intended standard.

However, since IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) and IEEE 802.4 (Token Bus) send the bytes (octets) over the wire, left-to-right, with least significant bit in each byte first, while IEEE 802.5 (Token Ring) and IEEE 802.6 (FDDI) send the bytes over the wire with the most significant bit first, confusion may arise when an OUI in the latter scenario is represented with bits reversed from the canonical representation. So for instance, an OUI whose canonical form is codice_1 could be seen written as codice_2 if translation is done improperly or inconsistently. The latter form (&quot;bit-reversed&quot; or &quot;noncanonical&quot; representation), may also be referred to in the literature as &quot;MSB format&quot;, &quot;IBM format&quot;, or &quot;Token Ring format&quot; for this reason. RFC2469 explains the problem in more detail.

== Format ==
The OUI is normally discussed and represented as a set of octets in hexadecimal notation separated by dashes (i.e., FF-FF-FF) or as a set of octets separated by colons in bit-reversed notation (i.e., FF:FF:FF).

The two least-significant-bits of the second nibble of the first octet of the hexadecimal representation (i.e., the two least significant bits of the first octet) of the OUI are reserved as flag bits for some protocols (e.g., &#x27;M&#x27; bit and &#x27;X&#x27; bit), flags to indicate whether the address is part of an individual (unicast) or group (multicast) address block (e.g., Individual/Group [I/G] bit or Unicast/Multicast [U/M] bit), flags to indicate whether an address is universally or locally administered (e.g., Universal/Local [U/L] bit), etc., and should not contain the values 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, a, b, d, e, or f, unless these values reflect the true meaning of these flag bits – if the organization that owns the OUI does set one of these bits when creating an identifier, then the value of the second nibble of the first octet changes accordingly in representations of the OUI (e.g., if the hexadecimal value of the second nibble of the first octet is &#x27;C&#x27; and the least-significant-bit is set, then the value becomes &#x27;D&#x27;).

Notes:
# &quot;Three-octet values occupying the same fields as OUIs can occupy, but with the next-to-LSB of the first octet set to 1, are locally assigned and have no relationship to the IEEE-assigned values...&quot;
# The IEEE also has Company ID (CID) where the four least significant bits of Octet 0 are designated the M bit, X bit, Y bit, and Z bit, respectively, beginning with the least significant bit. In the CID, the M, X, Y, and Z bits have the values 0, 1, 0, and 1, respectively.

== Types of identifiers ==
=== 32-bit context dependent identifier (CDI-32) ===

The CDI-32 was historically recommended as context dependent identifier that was formed by concatenating the 24-bit OUI with an 8-bit extension identifier that is assigned by the organization that purchased the OUI – the resulting identifier was generally represented as a set of octets separated by dashes (hexadecimal notation) or colons (bit-reversed notation) as in FF-FF-FF-FF or FF:FF:FF:FF, as a string of 4 bytes as in {FF,FF,FF,FF}, or as a base 16 number as in FFFFFFFF16.

=== 40-bit context dependent identifier (CDI-40) ===

The CDI-40 was historically recommended as context dependent identifier that was formed by concatenating the 24-bit OUI with a 16-bit extension or by concatenating a 36-bit OUI-36 with a 4-bit extension. In either case, the extension was assigned by the organization that purchased the OUI. The resulting identifier was generally represented as a set of octets separated by dashes (hexadecimal notation) or colons (bit-reversed notation) as in FF-FF-FF-FF-FF or FF:FF:FF:FF:FF, as a string of 5 bytes as in {FF,FF,FF,FF,FF}, or as a base 16 number as in FFFFFFFFFF16.

Note: There were also IAB based CDI-40 sequences that were formed by combining the 36-bit IEEE assigned IAB base value with the 4-bit extension identifier assigned by the organization – e.g., if the IEEE assigned IAB base value is 0x0050C257A and the 4-bit extension identifier is 0xF, then the CDI-40 values generated by combining these two numbers are from 0x0050C257AF00 to 0x0050C257AFFF

=== 48-bit media access control identifier (MAC-48) ===

The IEEE now considers the label MAC-48 to be an obsolete term which was previously used to refer to a specific type of EUI-48 identifier used to address hardware interfaces (e.g., Network Interface Controllers and other network hardware) within existing IEEE 802 based networking applications and should not be used in the future. Instead, the term EUI-48 should be used by manufacturers and others in the field for this purpose – i.e., MAC-48 identifier is identical to the EUI-48 identifier and is an obsolete label for it, although some distinction is still made when encapsulating MAC-48 and EUI-48 identifiers within EUI-64 identifiers (but now, the encapsulating mechanism is also deprecated).

=== 48-bit extended unique identifier (EUI-48) ===

The EUI-48 is an identifier that is formed by concatenating the 24-bit OUI with a 24-bit extension identifier that is assigned by the organization that purchased the OUI – the resulting identifier is generally represented as a set of octets separated by dashes (hexadecimal notation) or colons (bit-reversed notation) as in FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF or FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF, as a string of 6 bytes as in {FF,FF,FF,FF,FF,FF}, or as a base 16 number as in FFFFFFFFFFFF16.

=== 60-bit extended unique identifier (EUI-60) ===

The EUI-60 is an identifier that is formed by concatenating the 24-bit OUI with a 36-bit extension identifier that is assigned by the organization that purchased the OUI – the resulting identifier is generally represented by a string of 15 nibbles, as a base 16 number as in FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF16, or as FF-FF-FF:F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F as an EUI-64 value.

Note: This identifier was previously used as the worldwide name (WWN) identifier within some storage systems. Its use is now considered deprecated by the IEEE and the EUI-64 identifier should be used in the future for this and all other purposes for which the EUI-60 was previously used. Some of the storage systems in which an OUI based variant was used are Fibre Channel, and Serial Attached SCSI (SAS).

=== 64-bit extended unique identifier (EUI-64) ===

The EUI-64 is an identifier that is formed by concatenating the 24-bit OUI with a 40-bit extension identifier that is assigned by the organization that purchased the OUI – the resulting identifier is generally represented as a set of octets separated by dashes (hexadecimal notation) or colons (bit-reversed notation) as in FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF or FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF, as a string of 8 bytes as in {FF,FF,FF,FF,FF,FF,FF,FF}, or as a base 16 number as in FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF16.

Note: According to the IEEE guidelines, the first four digits of the organizationally assigned identifier (i.e., the first four digits of the extension identifier) portion of an EUI-64 “shall not be FFFE16 or FFFF16” (i.e., EUI-64 identifiers of the form and are not allowed) – this is to support the encapsulation of EUI-48 (FFFE16) and MAC-48 (FFFF16) values into EUI-64 values (though now the encapsulation is deprecated).

=== Other identifiers ===

IPv6 uses a 64-bit Modified Extended Unique Identifier (Modified EUI-64) in the lower half of some IPv6 addresses. A Modified EUI-64 is an EUI-64 with the U/L bit inverted.

There are other identifiers that may be formed using the OUI but those listed above are the most commonly used.

== Encapsulating ==
Mapping an EUI-48 to an EUI-64 is deprecated. The mapping is described here for historical reasons.

Other identifiers, such as MAC-48 and EUI-48 values, can be contained within a larger identifier or &#x27;container&#x27;, such as EUI-64, by creating the larger identifier through a process of combining the smaller identifier with specified values placed in specified bit-positions within the larger identifier – this process is known as &#x27;encapsulation&#x27; and is provided for the purpose of easing the transition from MAC-48 and EUI-48 to EUI-64 and to provide a mechanism for the conversion of MAC-48 and EUI-48 identifiers to EUI-64 in such a way that duplicate or conflicting values are avoided.

=== Encapsulation examples ===

Encapsulation of MAC-48 within EUI-64 Example:

Assuming that an organization has registered the OUI of AC-DE-48 and that the organization has created the MAC-48 value of AC-DE-48-23-45-67 by concatenating the extension identifier 23-45-67, this MAC-48 identifier has the following binary transmission order:
 | OUI | extension identifier | field
 | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | octet
 | C A | E D | 8 4 | 3 2 | 5 4 | 7 6 | hex
 0011 0101 0111 1011 0001 0010 1100 0100 1010 0010 1110 0110 bits
 lsb msb lsb msb lsb msb lsb msb lsb msb lsb msb
The same MAC-48 identifier after encapsulation within an EUI-64 has the following transmission order:
 | OUI | MAC label | extension identifier | field
 | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | order
 | C A | E D | 8 4 | F F | F F | 3 2 | 5 4 | 7 6 | hex
 00110101 01111011 00010010 11111111 11111111 11000100 10100100 11100110 bits
 lsb msb lsb msb lsb msb lsb msb lsb msb lsb msb lsb msb lsb msb
The same MAC-48 identifier after encapsulation within an EUI-64 has the following significance order:
 | OUI | MAC label | extension identifier | field
 | AC | DE | 48 | FF | FF | 23 | 45 | 67 | hex
 10101100 11011110 01001000 11111111 11111111 00100011 01000101 01100111 bits
 | most-significant-byte least-significant-byte |
 most-significant-bit least-significant-bit
Encapsulation of EUI-48 within EUI-64 example:

Assuming that an organization has registered the OUI of AC-DE-48 and that the organization has created the EUI-48 value of AC-DE-48-23-45-67 by concatenating the extension identifier 23-45-67, this EUI-48 identifier has the following format in significance order:
 | company_id | extension identifier | field
 | AC | DE | 48 | 23 | 45 | 67 | hex
 10101100 11011110 01001000 00100011 01000101 01100111 bits
 | most-significant-byte least-significant-byte |
 most-significant-bit least-significant-bit
The same EUI-48 identifier after encapsulation within an EUI-64 has the following format in significance order:
 | company_id | EUI label | extension identifier | field
 | AC | DE | 48 | FF | FE | 23 | 45 | 67 | hex
 10101100 11011110 01001000 11111111 11111110 00100011 01000101 01100111 bits
 | most-significant-byte least-significant-byte |
 most-significant-bit least-significant-bit
Encapsulation of MAC-48 or EUI-48 within modified EUI-64 example:

In the encapsulation within a Modified EUI-64 a MAC-48 is treated as an EUI-48 and the U/L bit is inverted.
Assuming that an organization has registered the OUI of AC-DE-48 and that the organization has created the MAC-48 or EUI-48 value of AC-DE-48-23-45-67 by concatenating the extension identifier 23-45-67, this MAC-48 or EUI-48 identifier has the following format in significance order:
 | company_id | extension identifier | field
 | AC | DE | 48 | 23 | 45 | 67 | hex
 10101100 11011110 01001000 00100011 01000101 01100111 bits
 | most-significant-byte least-significant-byte |
 most-significant-bit least-significant-bit
The same MAC-48 or EUI-48 identifier after encapsulation within a Modified EUI-64 has the following format in significance order:
 | company_id | EUI label | extension identifier | field
 | AE | DE | 48 | FF | FE | 23 | 45 | 67 | hex
 10101110 11011110 01001000 11111111 11111110 00100011 01000101 01100111 bits
 | most-significant-byte least-significant-byte |
 most-significant-bit least-significant-bit
=== NAA Name_Identifier ===

Network Address Authority (NAA) Name_Identifier formats define the first nibble (4 bits) to define the format of the identifier:

This encapsulation is used in Fibre Channel and SAS, and is also supported in iSCSI in RFC 3980. This addition requires either a shortened vendor-specific identifier field, or some OUI bits are assumed to be 0, such as when using EUI-64 Mapped format.

==Individual Address Block==
An Individual Address Block (IAB) is an inactive registry activity which has been replaced by the MA-S registry product as of 1 January 2014. The IAB uses a MA-L (and OUI) belonging to the IEEE Registration Authority, concatenated with 12 additional IEEE-provided bits (for a total of 36 bits), leaving only 12 bits for the IAB owner to assign to their (up to 4096) individual devices. An IAB is ideal for organizations requiring not more than 4096 unique 48-bit numbers (EUI-48). Unlike an OUI, which allows the assignee to assign values in various different number spaces (for example, EUI-48, EUI-64, and the various context-dependent identifier number spaces), the Individual Address Block could only be used to assign EUI-48 identifiers. All other potential uses based on the OUI from which the IABs are allocated are reserved, and remain the property of the IEEE Registration Authority. It should also be noted that, between 2007 and September 2012, the OUI value 00:50:C2 was used for IAB assignments. After September 2012, the value 40:D8:55 was used. The owners of an already assigned IAB may continue to use the assignment.

The OUI-36 is a deprecated registry activity name, which has been replaced by the MA-S registry product name as of 1 January 2014. This registry activity includes both a 36-bit unique number used in some standards and the assignment of a block of EUI-48 and EUI-64 identifiers (while owner of IAB cannot assign EUI-64) by the IEEE Registration Authority. The owner of an already assigned OUI-36 registry product may continue to use the assignment.

Example of EUI-48 created within an IAB: An EUI-48 identifier is formed by combining the 36-bit IEEE assigned IAB base value with a 12-bit extension identifier assigned by the organization – e.g., if the IEEE assigned IAB base-16 value is 0x0050C257A and the 12-bit extension identifier is 0xFFF, then the EUI-48 value generated by combining these two numbers is 0x0050C257AFFF.

<text>The HP-27S was a pocket calculator produced by Hewlett-Packard, introduced in 1988, and discontinued between 1990 and 1993 (sources vary). It was the first HP scientific calculator to use algebraic entry instead of RPN, and though it was labelled &quot;scientific&quot;, it also included features associated with specialized business calculators.

The device featured standard scientific functions, including statistics and probability. Equations could be stored in memory, and solved and integrated for specified variables. Binary, octal, and hexadecimal number bases could be used. Business features included a real-time clock and calendar with up to ten appointments (each with a 22 character message string), as well as functions such as time value of money calculations.

The 27S was not programmable in the conventional way, but it included an advanced formula-storage system with programming features. Within stored formulas, sub-formulas could be defined and later referred to by name. Loops and conditional execution could also be embedded within formulas.

== Hardware ==

The 27S has the same physical form factor and 37-key keypad as other models in the Pioneer series. Introduced at the same time as the HP-17B, it shares the same internal hardware.

The calculator had 6,900 bytes of usable memory, shared among variables and formulas. Ten storage registers R0 through R9 could each hold one number.

Its hardware features included a dot-matrix display of two rows of 22 characters. Depending on context, either the top row was used to display the current expression or a message, or the bottom row was used to show menu options, which could be selected with the corresponding keys. An infra-red transmitter was also included, allowing the machine to be used with a compatible printer, such as the HP 82240B. A beeper could be used to sound date/time alarms.

<text>was a Japanese samurai lord in the Heian period, who was the head of the Minamoto clan during his lifetime. He was the son of Minamoto no Yoshichika, son of Minamoto no Yoshiie. He led the Minamoto in the Hōgen Rebellion. He was also known as .

Though he was most famous for his involvement in the Hōgen Rebellion, Minamoto no Tameyoshi is also said to have intervened in a number of other conflicts earlier in his life. Around 1113, the ongoing rivalry between the warrior monks of Mii-dera and Enryaku-ji erupted into outright violence in the streets of Kyoto. Though the palace guard mobilized quickly to protect the Emperor, it is said that Tameyoshi, with a handful of mounted samurai, drove the mobs away himself.

Upon being defeated in the Hōgen Rebellion, Tameyoshi took the tonsure and was released into the custody of his son Minamoto no Yoshitomo who then had him beheaded. This was an unprecedented breaking of Buddhist values in Japan, yet no one in the court berated Yoshitomo for his actions at the time until after his death.

<doc id="730819" wikidata="Q1138936" url="?curid=730819" title="Soldier (1998 American film)">
<text>Soldier is a 1998 American science fiction action film directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, written by David Webb Peoples, and starring Kurt Russell, Jason Scott Lee, Jason Isaacs, Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and Gary Busey. The film tells the story of a highly skilled and emotionally distant soldier who is left for dead, befriends a group of refugees, then faces his former superiors who are determined to eliminate them.

The film was released worldwide on October 23, 1998. Upon its release, &quot;Soldier&quot; received generally negative reviews, although many praised the action sequences and Russell&#x27;s performance. The film was a box-office failure, grossing $14 million worldwide against a production budget of $60 million. Despite the financial failure, the film has now become a cult film.

==Plot==

In 1996, as part of a new military training program, a group of orphaned infants are selected shortly after birth and raised as highly disciplined soldiers with no understanding of anything but military routine. They are trained to be ruthless professionals, and anyone considered physically or mentally unworthy is executed. The survivors are turned into ultimate fighting machines, but have no understanding of the outside world.

In 2036, Sgt. Todd 3465 is a hardened veteran and one of the original 1996 infants, but his unit is about to be replaced by a superior one, with the original unit likely to be deactivated. Colonel Mekum, leader of the original project, introduces a new group of genetically engineered soldiers, designed with superior physical attributes and a complete lack of emotion, except complete aggression.

Captain Church, the commander of Todd&#x27;s unit, insists on testing the new soldiers&#x27; abilities against his own. One new soldier, Caine 607, easily defeats three of the original soldiers, but Todd gouges out Caine&#x27;s eye before falling from a great height; the body of a dead soldier cushions his fall, and he is knocked unconscious. Mekum orders their bodies disposed of like garbage, declaring them obsolete, while the remaining older soldiers are demoted to menial support roles.

Dumped on Arcadia 234, a waste disposal planet, Todd limps toward a colony whose residents crash-landed there years earlier; as they were believed dead, no rescue missions have been attempted. Todd is sheltered by Mace and his wife Sandra. Though they try to make him welcome, Todd has difficulty adapting to the community due to his extreme conditioning and their conflict-free lives. While Todd develops a silent rapport with their mute son, Nathan, who had been traumatized by a snakebite as an infant, he soon begins to experience flashbacks from his time as a soldier and mistakes one of the colonists for an enemy, nearly killing him. To make matters worse, in a later conflict with a coiled snake, Todd forces Nathan to face it down and strike back to protect himself. His parents disapprove of the lesson, unsure of how to deal with Todd.

Fearful, the colonists expel Todd from the community. Experiencing strong emotion for the first time, Todd appears confused when he is overcome by loss and cries for the first time. A short time later, Mace and Sandra are almost bitten by a snake while they sleep, but they are saved by Nathan, who uses Todd&#x27;s technique. Now understanding the value of Todd&#x27;s lesson, they seek him to reintegrate him into the community, but the others resist.

The new genetically engineered soldiers arrive on the garbage planet, and, since the world is listed as uninhabited, Colonel Mekum decides to use the colonists&#x27; community as the target in a training exercise. The soldiers spot Mace and kill him just after he finds Todd. Though out-manned and outgunned, Todd&#x27;s years of battle experience and superior knowledge of the planet allow him to return to the colony and kill the advance squad. Nervous that an unknown enemy force may be confronting them, Colonel Mekum orders the soldiers to withdraw and return with heavy artillery. Using guerrilla tactics, Todd outmaneuvers and defeats all of the remaining soldiers, including Caine 607, whom he defeats in vicious hand-to-hand combat.

Panicking, Mekum orders the transport ship&#x27;s crew, composed of Todd&#x27;s old squad, to set up and activate a portable doomsday device powerful enough to destroy the planet. He orders the ship to lift off, leaving the squad behind. When Captain Church objects, Mekum shoots him in cold blood. Before they can take off as planned, Todd appears, and his old comrades silently side with him over the army that has discarded them, and take over the ship. They leave Mekum and his aides on the planet and evacuate the remaining colonists. In an attempt to disarm the device, Mekum accidentally sets it off, killing him and his aides. Todd pilots the ship from Arcadia just ahead of the shockwave and sets course for the Trinity Moons, the colonists&#x27; original destination. He picks up Nathan and points to their new destination, while looking out upon the galaxy.

==Production==

Kurt Russell spoke only 104 words in the entire movie despite being in 85% of the scenes. During the first week of shooting he broke his left ankle, then the top of his right foot four days later, so the entire production needed to be rescheduled. The filmmakers first shot scenes involving Russell lying down, followed by scenes of Russell sitting, Russell standing but not moving, and so on.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Soldier&quot; grossed $14.6 million in the United States.

===Critical response===
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 17% approval rating based on 54 reviews and an average rating of 3.6/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A boring genre film and a waste of a good set.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Bruce Westbrook of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; commented that &quot;the action is handled fairly well, but it&#x27;s routine, and there&#x27;s no satisfaction in seeing Todd waste men who are no more bloodthirsty than he is.&quot; Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s overuse of genre clichés, saying &quot;any cliché you can dream up for a futuristic action movie, any familiar big-budget epic you can think to rip off, &quot;Soldier&quot; has gotten there first.&quot; Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described the film as &quot;a big, clanging, brutal actioner in which we search the murk in vain for the sparks of humanity the moviemakers keep promising us.&quot; Lisa Alspector of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; found the film to be enjoyable, calling Russell&#x27;s performance &quot;persuasive&quot; and saying &quot;this appealing formulaic action adventure displays a lot of conviction in its not-too-flashy action scenes and a little levity in the gradual socialization of Russell&#x27;s character.&quot; Similarly, Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the film a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and called it &quot;a potent comic-book-style action-adventure.&quot;
Eddie Harrison of film-authority.com wrote …while humour is sorely lacking in Soldier, the brutalist sci-fi tone holds throughout, and it’s easy to get behind Todd’s stubborn unwillingness to be thrown out with the trash… Critic Niall Browne
of Movies in Focus wrote &quot;Soldier finally deserves a reappraisal. The Kurt Russell starrer is actually a hugely entertaining and visually arresting piece of science fiction cinema – at the centre of it is a bold performance from Russell – one in which he only speaks 104 words.&quot;

==Connection with &quot;Blade Runner&quot; franchise==
&quot;Soldier&quot; was written by David Peoples, who co-wrote the script for the 1982 film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. In 1998 he said that he considers &quot;Soldier&quot; to be a &quot;spin-off sidequel&quot;-spiritual successor to &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, seeing both films as existing in a shared fictional universe. The film obliquely refers to various elements of stories written by Philip K. Dick (who wrote the 1968 novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot;, on which &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is based), or film adaptations thereof. A Spinner from &quot;Blade Runner&quot; can be seen in the wreckage on the junk planet in the film and Russell’s character is shown to have fought in the battles referred to in Roy Batty’s (Rutger Hauer) dying monologue: the Shoulder of Orion and Tannhäuser Gate. The script was 15 years old at the time of production.

However, in an interview conducted with Danny Stewart for Stewart&#x27;s book about the movie, published in 2023, when was asked if he wrote &quot;Soldier&quot; as a “side-quel” to &quot;Blade Runner&quot; that was set in the same universe, Peoples stated &quot;No, I never had any thoughts about that... I wrote &quot;Soldier&quot; in 1984. Very quickly on my own. I wrote it because I saw the first &quot;Terminator&quot; in the theater, stunned. And it was such a wonderful movie. I’d always wanted to write a movie in which there was a tough guy who would be seemingly unsympathetic in the lead, and I felt that &quot;The Terminator&quot; was almost there. Later in the sequel, it was determined he was the hero, but at the time, he was sort of a villain. But the fact is, he was so great. I went off, and I decided to write about this soldier.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;Soldier&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on March 2, 1999, and on Blu-ray on July 26, 2011.

<text>An imagined community is a concept developed by Benedict Anderson in his 1983 book &quot;Imagined Communities&quot; to analyze nationalism. Anderson depicts a nation as a socially-constructed community, imagined by the people who perceive themselves as part of a group.

Anderson focuses on the way media creates imagined communities, especially the power of print media in shaping an individual&#x27;s social psyche. Anderson analyzes the written word, a tool used by churches, authors, and media companies (notably books, newspapers, and magazines), as well as governmental tools such as the map, the census, and the museum. These tools were all built to target and define a mass audience in the public sphere through dominant images, ideologies, and language. Anderson explores the racist and colonial origins of these practices before explaining a general theory that demonstrates how contemporary governments and corporations can (and frequently do) utilize these same practices. These theories were not originally applied to the Internet or television.

==Origin==
According to Anderson, the creation of imagined communities has become possible because of &quot;print capitalism&quot;. Capitalist entrepreneurs printed their books and media in the vernacular in order to maximize circulation. As a result, readers speaking various local dialects became able to understand each other, and a common discourse emerged. Anderson argued that the first European nation states were thus formed around their &quot;national print-languages.&quot;
Anderson argues that the first form of capitalism started with the process of printing books and religious materials. The process of printing texts in the vernacular started right after books began to be printed in script languages, such as Latin, which saturated the elite market. At the moment it was also observed that just a small category of people was speaking it and was part of the bilingual society. The start of cultural and national revolution was around 1517 when Martin Luther presented his views regarding the scripture, that people should be able to read it in their own homes. In the following years, from 1520 to 1540, more than half of the books printed in German translation bore his name. 
Moreover, the first European nation states that are presented as having formed around their &quot;national print-languages&quot; are said to be found in the Anglo-Saxon region, nowadays England, and around today&#x27;s Germany. Not only in Western Europe was the process of creating a nation emerging. In a few centuries, most European nations had created their own national languages but still were using languages such as Latin, French or German (primarily French and German) for political affair.

==Nationalism and imagined communities==
According to Anderson&#x27;s theory of imagined communities, the main causes of nationalism are the movement to abolish the ideas of rule by divine right and hereditary monarchy; and the emergence of printing press capitalism (&quot;the convergence of capitalism and print technology... standardization of national calendars, clocks and language was embodied in books and the publication of daily newspapers&quot;)—all phenomena occurring with the start of the Industrial Revolution. 
From this, Anderson argues that with the development of technology, people began distinguishing between what was considered divine and what truly constituted history and politics. Initially, these concepts were intertwined, as a common religion unified society across Europe, serving as the foundation for both spiritual and political life. With the emergence of the printing press and capitalism, people gained national consciousness regarding the common values that bring those people together. The Imagined Communities started with the creation of their own nation print-languages that each individual spoke. That helped develop the first forms of known nation-states, who then created their own form of art, novels, publications, mass media, and communications.

While attempting to define nationalism, Anderson identifies three paradoxes:
# The objective modernity of nations to the historians&#x27; eyes vs. their subjective antiquity in the eyes of nationalists.
# The formal universality of nationality as a socio-cultural concept [...] vs. the irremediable particularity of its concrete manifestations
# The &#x27;political power of such nationalisms vs. their philosophical poverty and even incoherence.&quot;
Anderson talks of Unknown Soldier tombs as an example of nationalism. The tombs of Unknown Soldiers are either empty or hold unidentified remains, but each nation with these kinds of memorials claims these soldiers as their own. No matter what the actual origin of the Unknown Soldier is, these nations have placed them within their imagined community.

==Nation as an imagined community==
He defined a nation as &quot;an imagined political community.&quot; As Anderson puts it, a nation &quot;is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion.&quot; Members of the community probably will never know each of the other members face to face; however, they may have similar interests or identify as part of the same nation. Members hold in their minds a mental image of their affinity. For example, the nationhood felt with other members of your nation when your &quot;imagined community&quot; participates in a larger event such as the Olympic Games.

Finally, a nation is a community because,

==Context and influence==
Benedict Anderson arrived at his theory because he felt neither Marxist nor liberal theory adequately explained nationalism.

Anderson falls into the &quot;historicist&quot; or &quot;modernist&quot; school of nationalism along with Ernest Gellner and Eric Hobsbawm in that he posits that nations and nationalism are products of modernity and have been created as means to political and economic ends. This school opposes the primordialists, who believe that nations, if not nationalism, have existed since early human history. Imagined communities can be seen as a form of social constructionism on par with Edward Said&#x27;s concept of imagined geographies.

In contrast to Gellner and Hobsbawm, Anderson is not hostile to the idea of nationalism, nor does he think that nationalism is obsolete in a globalizing world. Anderson values the utopian element in nationalism.

According to Harald Bauder, the concept of imagined communities remains highly relevant in a contemporary context of how nation-states frame and formulate their identities about domestic and foreign policy, such as policies towards immigrants and migration. According to Euan Hague, &quot;Anderson&#x27;s concept of nations being &#x27;imagined communities&#x27; has become standard within books reviewing geographical thought&quot;.

Even though the term was coined to specifically describe nationalism, it is now used more broadly, almost blurring it with community of interest. For instance, it can be used to refer to a community based on sexual orientation, or awareness of global risk factors.

The term has been influential on other thinkers. British anthropologist Mark Lindley-Highfield of Ballumbie Castle describes ideas such as &quot;the West&quot;, which are given agentive status as though they are homogeneous real things, as entity-concepts, where these entity-concepts can have different symbolic values attributed to them to those attributed to the individuals comprising the group, who on an individual basis might be perceived differently. Lindley-Highfield explains: &quot;Thus the discourse flows at two levels: One at which ideological disembodied concepts are seen to compete and contest, that have an agency of their own and can have agency acted out against them; and another at which people are individuals and may be distinct from the concepts held about their broader society.&quot; This varies from Anderson&#x27;s work in that the application of the term is from the outside, and in terms of the focus on the inherent contradiction between the divergent identities of the entity-concepts and those who would fall under them.

<text>A World Wide Name (WWN) or World Wide Identifier (WWID) is a unique identifier used in storage technologies including Fibre Channel, Parallel ATA, Serial ATA, SCSI and Serial Attached SCSI (SAS).

A WWN may be employed in a variety of roles, such as a serial number or for addressability; for example, in Fibre Channel networks, a WWN may be used as a WWNN (World Wide Node Name) to identify an endpoint, or a WWPN (World Wide Port Name) to identify an individual port on a switch. Two WWNs which do not refer to the same thing should always be different even if the two are used in different roles, i.e. a role such as WWPN or WWNN does not define a separate WWN space. The use of burned-in addresses and specification compliance by vendors is relied upon to enforce uniqueness.

==Formats==
Each WWN is an 8- or 16-byte number, the length and format of which is determined by the most significant four bits, which are referred to as an NAA (Network Address Authority). The remainder of the value is derived from an IEEE OUI (or from Company Id (CID)) and vendor-supplied information. Each format defines a different way to arrange and/or interpret these components. OUIs are used with the U/L and multicast bits zeroed, or sometimes even omitted (and assumed zero), though CID has U/L set to 1.

The WWN formats include:
* &quot;Original&quot; IEEE formats are essentially a two-byte header followed by an embedded EUI-48 address (which contains the OUI). The first 2 bytes are either hex 10:00 or 2x:xx (where the x&#x27;s are vendor-specified) followed by the 3-byte OUI and 3 bytes for a vendor-specified serial number. Thus, the difference between NAA 1 format and NAA 2 format is merely the presence of either a zero pad or an extra 3 nibbles of vendor information.
* &quot;Registered&quot; IEEE formats dispense with padding and place the OUI immediately after the NAA. The OUI is no longer considered to be part of a EUI-48 address. For NAA 5 format, this leaves 9 contiguous nibbles for a vendor-defined value. This is the same format used by the companion NAA 6 format, the only difference being a 16-byte number space is assumed, rather than an 8-byte number space. This leaves a total of 25 contiguous nibbles for vendor-defined values.
* &quot;Mapped EUI-64&quot; formats manage to fit an EUI-64 address into an 8-byte WWN. Since the NAA is mandatory, and takes up a nibble, this represents a four-bit deficit. These four bits are recouped through the following tricks: First, two bits are stolen from the NAA by allocating NAAs 12, 13, 14, and 15 to all refer to the same format. Second, the remaining two bits are recouped by omitting the U/L and multicast bits from the EUI-64&#x27;s OUI. When reconstructing the embedded EUI-64 value, the U/L and multicast bits are assumed to have carried zero values.

==Presentation==
WWN addresses are predominantly represented as colon separated hexadecimal octets, MSB-first, with leading zeros — similar to Ethernet&#x27;s MAC address. However, there is much variance between vendors.

== Example usage ==

Linux uses WWN to identify disks by providing symbolic links to the real device entry:

The target names (sr0, sda) might change when new devices are added to the computer (e.g. sda might become sdb) but the WWN will be the same. That is an advantage when the WWNs are used in configuration files and scripts, e.g., .

== How to Find WWN Information in Linux ==

There are various ways how to find WWN information.

Regardless of HBA type, below commands can be used to find WWN number information.

=== Method 1 ===
 # cat /sys/class/fc_host/host*/port_name
 0x10000090fa2537d6
 0x10000090fa253a29

=== Method 2 : using syminq command ===
If EMC Storage is being used so there is a chance you must have SYMCLI software installed. syminq comes with SYSCLI. syminq is also helpful in getting WWN in easy way.

<text>The van &#x27;t Hoff factor (named after Dutch chemist Jacobus Henricus van &#x27;t Hoff) is a measure of the effect of a solute on colligative properties such as osmotic pressure, relative lowering in vapor pressure, boiling-point elevation and freezing-point depression. The van &#x27;t Hoff factor is the ratio between the actual concentration of particles produced when the substance is dissolved and the concentration of a substance as calculated from its mass. For most non-electrolytes dissolved in water, the van &#x27;t Hoff factor is essentially 1.

For most ionic compounds dissolved in water, the van &#x27;t Hoff factor is equal to the number of discrete ions in a formula unit of the substance. This is true for ideal solutions only, as occasionally ion pairing occurs in solution. At a given instant a small percentage of the ions are paired and count as a single particle. Ion pairing occurs to some extent in all electrolyte solutions. This causes the measured van &#x27;t Hoff factor to be less than that predicted in an ideal solution. The deviation for the van &#x27;t Hoff factor tends to be greatest where the ions have multiple charges.

The factor binds osmolarity to molarity and osmolality to molality.

==Dissociated solutes==
The degree of dissociation is the fraction of the original solute molecules that have dissociated. It is usually indicated by the Greek symbol formula_1. There is a simple relationship between this parameter and the van &#x27;t Hoff factor. If a fraction formula_1 of the solute dissociates into formula_3 ions, then

:formula_4

For example, the dissociation KCl K+ + Cl− yields formula_5 ions, so that formula_6.

For dissociation in the absence of association, the van &#x27;t Hoff factor is:
formula_7.

==Associated solutes==
Similarly, if a fraction formula_1 of formula_3 moles of solute associate to form one mole of an &quot;n&quot;-mer (dimer, trimer, etc.), then

: formula_10

For the dimerisation of acetic acid in benzene:

: 2 CH3COOH (CH3COOH)2

2 moles of acetic acid associate to form 1 mole of dimer, so that
: formula_11

For association in the absence of dissociation, the van &#x27;t Hoff factor is:
formula_12.

== Physical significance of ==
* When solute particles associate in solution, is less than 1. For example, carboxylic acids such as acetic acid (ethanoic acid) or benzoic acid form dimers in benzene, so that the number of solute particles is half the number of acid molecules.
* When solute particles dissociate in solution, is greater than 1 (e.g. sodium chloride in water, potassium chloride in water, magnesium chloride in water).
* When solute particles neither dissociate nor associate in solution, equals 1 (e.g. glucose in water).
The value of is the actual number of particles in solution after dissociation divided by the number of formula units initially dissolved in solution and means the number of particles per formula unit of the solute when a solution is dilute. 

== Relation to osmotic coefficient ==
This quantity can be related to the osmotic coefficient g by the relation: 
formula_13.

<text>Leopold Figl (2 October 1902 – 9 May 1965) was an Austrian politician of the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (Christian Democrats) and the first Federal Chancellor after World War II. He was also the youngest Federal Chancellor of Austria after the war before Sebastian Kurz.

==Life==
Born a farmer&#x27;s son in the Lower Austrian village of Rust im Tullnerfeld, Figl after graduation as &quot;Dipl.-Ing.&quot; of Agriculture at the University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences Vienna became vice chair of the Lower Austrian Bauernbund (Farmer&#x27;s League) in 1931 and chairman in 1933. In 1930, Figl married Hilde Hemala (1906-1989) and had two children.

After the authoritarian revolution of Engelbert Dollfuss, who had served as his mentor within the Farmer&#x27;s League, Figl became a member of the federal council of economic policy and became leader of the paramilitary organisation of Ostmärkische Sturmscharen for the state of Lower Austria.

After the Anschluss, the Nazis deported Figl to Dachau concentration camp in 1938, from which he was released in May 1943. He then worked as an oil engineer, but in October 1944 Figl was rearrested and brought to Mauthausen concentration camp. On 21 January 1945, he was brought with the later executed resistance fighter Heinrich Maier to Vienna. The folder of his dossier was marked with the abbreviation &#x27;VG&#x27; indicating that a &quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot; (People&#x27;s Court) trial, often ending with a death penalty, was planned or in preparation. Figl was released on 6 April 1945, when troops of the Soviet Army advanced to the centre of Vienna in an operation which became known as the Vienna Offensive .

After the defeat of the Nazis, the Allies occupied Austria at the end of World War II. The Soviet military commander, Fyodor Tolbukhin, asked Figl to manage the provision of food for the population of Vienna. 
On 14 April 1945 he refounded the &quot;Bauernbund&quot; and integrated it into the Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP), which was founded three days later. Figl was elected vice chair. On 27 April he became interim Governor of Lower Austria and vice-minister.

At the first free elections since 1930, held in December 1945, the ÖVP won with 49.8 percent of the vote and an absolute majority of seats in the legislature. Figl was proposed as Chancellor; the Soviets agreed, because of his opposition to the Nazis and his managerial abilities. Although he could have formed an exclusively ÖVP government, the memories of the factionalism that had plagued the First Republic led him to continue the grand coalition between the People&#x27;s Party, Socialists and Communists. The coalition (from which the Communists were pushed out in 1947), remained in office until 1966 and did much to solve the serious economic and social problems left over from World War II. 

After internal criticism, Figl resigned as Chancellor on 26 November 1953. His successor, Julius Raab, was less flexible towards the SPÖ, but was Chancellor when the Austrian State Treaty, which restored sovereignty to the country, was signed on 15 May 1955. However, Figl was strongly involved in its achievement, as he remained in the government as foreign minister. His appearance on the balcony of Belvedere Palace waving the signed paper and speaking the words &quot;Österreich ist frei!&quot; (&quot;Austria is free!&quot;), as rendered by the &quot;Wochenschau&quot; newsreel, has become an icon in the Austrian national remembrance. (The words were actually spoken before, inside the Palace, but the pictures on the balcony were underlain with the sound track made inside.)

At the national elections of 1959 the SPÖ gained ground on the ÖVP, and the ratio of seats between the two parties in parliament was now almost 1:1. This gave the SPÖ the bargaining power to demand that Bruno Kreisky succeed him as foreign minister. Figl then became president of the National Council 1959–1962, but soon returned to Lower Austria, to become governor of his home state.

Figl was patron of the Pfadfinder Österreichs between 1960 and 1964 and president of this Scout association from 1964 until his death.

He died from kidney cancer in 1965 in Vienna, and is buried in an Ehrengrab at the Zentralfriedhof. His son Johannes was International Commissioner of the Pfadfinder Österreichs and president of the Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnen Österreichs from 1994 to 2000.

==Beatification==
In December 2020, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sankt Pölten opened his cause for beatification. He currently holds the title &quot;Servant of God&quot;.

<text>The [[Saab Automotive|Saab]] MFI 13 was a February 1965 prototype for the Saab 97 automobile, later known as Sonett II. It was built at the &quot;Malmö Flygindustri&quot; as they had some experience with plastic manufacturing. The body of the prototype was made of steel though. A second prototype was designed by Sixten Sason and delivered a month later by ASJ (&quot;Aktiebolaget Svenska Järnvägsverkstäderna&quot; - the Swedish Railroad Works) in Arlöv. 

Both cars were brought to Trollhättan for examination and the MFI car was determined to be the most suitable for further development. Both cars had the two stroke Saab Sport engine of 60 hp (45 kW) and were capable of 160 km/h. By spring 1966 the &quot;project 97&quot; had advanced enough so that 24 cars could be built in Arlöv, in the south of Sweden. When series production started by the end of the year, many details had been altered: brakes, ventilation system, grille and parking lights. Prototypes were shown at both the &quot;Salon International de l&#x27;Auto&quot; (Geneva) and New York International Auto Show. In Geneva a car was available for test driving.

Both cars are now on display in the Saab Museum in Trollhättan.

<doc id="730831" wikidata="Q116980" url="?curid=730831" title="Gennaro Gattuso">
<text>Gennaro Ivan Gattuso (; born 9 January 1978) is an Italian professional football manager and former player who is the manager of Croatian Football League club Hajduk Split.

As a player, Gattuso mainly played in the centre as a defensive midfielder, although he was also capable of playing out wide. He initially played for Perugia, Salernitana and Rangers, though he is mostly remembered for his time with AC Milan in Serie A, where he won the UEFA Champions League in 2002–03 and 2006–07, the Coppa Italia in 2002–03, and also the Serie A title in 2003–04 and 2010–11. In addition to these titles, he also won two Italian Supercups, two UEFA Supercups, and a FIFA Club World Cup. At international level, Gattuso played for the Italy national football team at the 2000 Summer Olympics, three FIFA World Cups, two UEFA European Championships, and the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup.

Gattuso&#x27;s talismanic midfield partnership with playmaker Andrea Pirlo, both at club and international level, played a key role in Italy&#x27;s World Cup victory in 2006, as well as Milan&#x27;s domestic, European and international successes during the mid-2000s. Despite not being blessed with notable technical skills, Gattuso&#x27;s pace, strength and work-rate complemented and supported Pirlo&#x27;s composed, creative playing style. In addition to his ball-winning abilities, Gattuso was renowned for his competitive nature and leadership qualities throughout his career, often wearing the captain&#x27;s armband for Milan following Paolo Maldini&#x27;s retirement.

Gattuso&#x27;s managerial career began as player-coach of his final club, Sion of the Swiss Super League, and he also had short spells in charge of Palermo and OFI Crete. In June 2016, he led Pisa to Serie B promotion. He later coached both the youth side and the first team of his former club Milan between 2017 and 2019, before being appointed as manager of Napoli later that year, where he won his first title as a manager, the 2019–20 Coppa Italia. He then had further short managerial stints at Fiorentina, Valencia and Marseille, before taking over at Croatian club Hajduk Split in June 2024.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Gattuso was born in Corigliano Calabro, Italy. He started his career with Umbrian side Perugia, but transferred in July 1997, at the age of 19, to the Scottish team Rangers. The move was controversial; Perugia, unsuccessfully, accused Rangers of signing Gattuso illegally that they took their case to FIFA. Gattuso revealed that he initially refused to join Rangers but accepted the move after his father persuaded him to move.

Gattuso made his debut for Rangers, coming on as an 81st-minute substitute, in a 3–1 win against Hearts in the opening game of the season. He scored his first goal for the club against Strasbourg in the first round of the UEFA Cup, as Rangers failed to overcome the deficit, losing 4–2 on aggregate. Gattuso received a red card for the first time in his professional career over a second bookable offence, in a 5–2 win against Hearts on 20 December 1997. He later scored two more goals for the club, including a brace against Hearts on 25 April 1998. This led him to being described as an &quot;unsung heroes&quot; by the club’s chairman David Murray, who he felt &quot;has surpassed expectations by playing so many games aged 19&quot;. In the Scottish Cup final, Gattuso played the whole game, as Rangers lost 2–1 against Hearts. At the end of the 1997–98 season, he had made forty appearances and scoring four times in all competitions.

Walter Smith, who brought Gattuso to Glasgow, left the club in 1998. Smith&#x27;s successor, Dick Advocaat, did not favour Gattuso and played him out-of-position as a right-back. Despite this, he was able to score in the UEFA Cup 4–2 win against Beitar Jerusalem. The Italian was sold in October 1998 to then-recently-promoted Serie A club Salernitana for £4 million. Prior to joining Salernitana, Gattuso turned down a move to Juventus.

===AC Milan===
Gattuso was bought by AC Milan for €8 million from Salernitana in the summer of 1999. He made his debut with the club on 15 September 1999, in a 0–0 away draw with Chelsea in the UEFA Champions League; he soon broke into the starting line-up that season, also playing his first Milan-derby match on 24 October 1999, in which he stood out and immediately endeared himself with the Milan fans for the maturity and tenacity he demonstrated when facing Inter striker Ronaldo, who was widely regarded as the best player in the world at the time.

During his time at the club, Gattuso&#x27;s work-rate and versatility as a ball-winner later allowed Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti to place midfield playmaker Andrea Pirlo alongside him in a more creative, attacking position, while Gattuso supported him in a deeper role, as a defensive midfielder; this midfield partnership was pivotal to Milan&#x27;s domestic and international successes under Ancelotti, which included the Coppa Italia, the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Super Cup in 2003, as well as the Serie A title and the Supercoppa Italiana in 2004. Gattuso signed a contract extension with Milan in June 2003 and in October 2004. During this period, Gattuso also reached the 2005 UEFA Champions League final with Milan, only to be defeated by Liverpool on penalties, after initially leading 3–0 at half-time.
Gattuso played his 300th game for the club in a goalless Champions League draw against Lille on 26 September 2006, and he extended his current deal with Milan until 2011 on 1 February 2007. On 23 May 2007, Gattuso won the Champions League for the second time in his career when Milan beat Liverpool 2–1 in the final.

After winning the FIFA Club World Cup, on 27 December 2007, Gattuso trained with his former club Rangers to regain fitness during the Serie A winter break whilst his wife was visiting family in Scotland over Christmas. The following December, Gattuso suffered a torn Anterior cruciate ligament early on in the 1–0 league win against Catania. Despite the injury, however, Gattuso played the entire 90 minutes before being diagnosed by the club doctors after the match. He underwent surgery to repair the damage on 19 December 2008 in Antwerp, Belgium. He was expected to miss up to six months of action but managed to return to the Milan bench on 10 May against Juventus, a month ahead of schedule.

On 22 August 2009, he made his 400th appearance with Milan in the opening match of the 2009–10 Serie A season against Siena, wearing the captain&#x27;s armband. It was confirmed by Milan on 14 December 2009 that Gattuso would remain a Milan player until 30 June 2012, after adding one more year to his current contract.

The 2010–11 season with Milan was one of Gattuso&#x27;s best seasons of his career, and saw him end a three-year goal drought with a left-footed strike from outside the box, which proved to be the decisive goal in a 1–0 victory over Juventus on 5 March 2011. Gattuso later celebrated another goal in a 4–1 victory against Cagliari with a long-distance header that beat the goalkeeper, who was off his line. Gattuso celebrated Milan&#x27;s 18th &quot;Scudetto&quot; victory after a scoreless draw against Roma on 7 May.

Gattuso had been experiencing vision problems in early September 2011, a few days before the season kicked off. On 9 September 2011, Gattuso crashed into teammate Alessandro Nesta whilst playing against Lazio in Milan&#x27;s opening Serie A game of the 2011–12 season. He was substituted off directly afterward in the 20th minute and diagnosed with a left sixth cranial nerve palsy, resulting in double vision, an injury that could have ended his football career. He later revealed that he had seen teammate Zlatan Ibrahimović in four different positions during the opening stages of the match, and was unable to see Nesta, resulting in the pair&#x27;s clash.

On 11 May 2012, Gattuso confirmed that he would not renew his contract with the club which was due to expire on 30 June and that he would be leaving Milan at the end of the season.

===Sion===
On 15 June 2012, after being released by Milan, Gattuso joined Swiss club Sion. He had been linked with a deal to join former club Rangers in Scotland, but the deal fell through because of the club&#x27;s financial difficulties. On 25 February 2013, Gattuso was named as the new manager of Sion after manager Víctor Muñoz was demoted to a scouting role after a 4–0 defeat by Thun in the Swiss Super League.

===Controversies===
In a UEFA Champions League group stage match against Ajax in September 2003, he was sent off during second-half injury time after slapping Ajax striker Zlatan Ibrahimović in the face with the back of his hand. His temper caused him further problems when in December 2005, at the final whistle of Milan&#x27;s 3–2 defeat of Schalke 04 in the Champions League, Gattuso was seen seeking out and taunting Schalke&#x27;s midfielder Christian Poulsen as a reaction to Poulsen&#x27;s fierce marking of Kaká in the first leg. Gattuso insisted, however, that the press exaggerated the significance of the incident.

On 15 February 2011, during Milan&#x27;s Champions League game against Tottenham Hotspur, Gattuso pushed Tottenham coach Joe Jordan away by the throat during an incident on the sideline. Jordan was seen outside his allowed technical area exchanging words with Gattuso, in relation to the relatively physical game that had been played. After the game, after Gattuso had shaken hands with the Tottenham players, video footage showed him confronting Jordan and head-butting him after another exchange of words, before being restrained by both teammates and opponents. &quot;I lost control. There is no excuse for what I did. I take my responsibilities for that&quot;, said the 33-year-old Gattuso, but he also said Jordan provoked him throughout the game but refused to say what his comments were. Newspapers, however, reported Joe Jordan had been using racist, offensive calls for much of the game by calling Gattuso a &quot;fucking Italian bastard&quot; from the sidelines. The following day, it was announced that UEFA was looking at additional sanctions or punishment for Gattuso&#x27;s actions against Jordan the previous day and had been charged with &quot;gross unsporting conduct.&quot; Gattuso was then suspended for five Champions League matches – one for yellow card accumulation, the other four for the incident with Jordan. The Tottenham coach also received a touchline ban by UEFA for his involvement in the exchange.

==International career==
===Youth===
Gattuso represented the Italy under-18 side at the 1995 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship, where Italy finished in second place to Spain following a 4–1 final defeat; he also represented the Italy under-21 side at the 2000 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, where Italy went on to win the tournament with a 2–1 victory over the Czech Republic in the final.

===Senior===
Gattuso earned 73 appearances for his country at senior level and played in the 2000 Summer Olympics, the 2002 World Cup, Euro 2004, the 2006 World Cup, Euro 2008, the 2009 Confederations Cup, and the 2010 World Cup. On 23 February 2000, he debuted under Dino Zoff at the age of 22 in a 1–0 friendly home victory over Sweden, on 23 February 2000. The same year on 15 November, he made his first start for Italy later that year under Giovanni Trapattoni scoring the only goal in a 1–0 friendly home victory over England with a powerful strike from outside the area; this was his first and only goal for Italy.

====2002 FIFA World Cup====
Gattuso made two substitute appearances at the 2002 World Cup, first in his nation&#x27;s 2–0 opening group win against Ecuador, and secondly in Italy&#x27;s controversial 2–1 extra-time defeat to co-hosts South Korea in the round of 16 of the competition. He also later appeared in Italy&#x27;s two opening group matches at Euro 2004, against Denmark (0–0) and Sweden (1–1), but missed out on Italy&#x27;s final match against Bulgaria (2–1) due to a suspension following an accumulation of two yellow cards in the first two matches of the competition; despite a 2–1 victory, Italy were eliminated from the tournament in the first round on direct encounters, following a three-way five-point tie with Denmark and Sweden.

====2006 FIFA World Cup====
Gattuso was named to Italy&#x27;s 23-man squad for the 2006 World Cup, and was one of the key players in Italy&#x27;s eventual victory in the tournament under manager Marcello Lippi; he won the Man of the Match award for his performance in his nation&#x27;s 3–0 victory in the quarter-finals of the tournament, against Ukraine. He and Andrea Pirlo formed a formidable partnership in the heart of midfield, with Gattuso supporting Pirlo&#x27;s creative playmaking duties with his work-rate and ability to break down possession. While Pirlo finished as one of the top assist providers in the tournament, Gattuso won more challenges than any other player in the tournament (47 – 11 more than Patrick Vieira in second place) and completed 351 passes out of the 392 he attempted; he also provided an assist during the tournament, helping to set up Filippo Inzaghi&#x27;s goal in a 2–0 win over the Czech Republic in Italy&#x27;s final group match of the tournament on 22 June. Gattuso achieved a measure of notoriety for his post-match celebrations after Italy won the World Cup final on penalties against France on 9 July, during which he removed his shorts and ran around the pitch in his underpants, until FIFA officials forced him to cover up. He was named to the tournament&#x27;s All Star Team for his performances.

====UEFA Euro 2008====
Under Roberto Donadoni at Euro 2008, Gattuso played in the matches against Netherlands (a 0–3 loss) and France (a 2–0 win) in the group stage, but was suspended for the quarter-final match against eventual champions Spain, along with Andrea Pirlo; in their absence, Italy went on to lose 4–2 in the ensuing penalty shoot-out after a 0–0 draw following extra-time.

On 19 November 2008, he made his first appearance as Italy&#x27;s captain, taking the armband following Fabio Cannavaro&#x27;s substitution in the 61st minute of a friendly against Greece. Despite having only recently recovered from a serious knee injury, Lippi included Gattuso in Italy&#x27;s squad for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, where they suffered a first round elimination. At the tournament, Gattuso gained notoriety against Egypt when he got tripped up by Mohamed Aboutrika, and his shorts fell down, revealing his underpants.

====Retirement====
In June 2010, Gattuso announced that he would retire from international duty after the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, where he participated in his nation&#x27;s final group match against Slovakia – his last game for the national side, as Italy suffered a first round elimination following a 3–2 defeat.

==Style of play==

Considered by pundits to be one of the greatest holding midfielders of all time, throughout his career, Gattuso mainly played as a central or defensive midfielder, although he was even deployed on the right flank on occasion, either as a full-back, wing-back, or as a winger, due to his versatility. Despite not being particularly skilful from a technical standpoint (although he was able to improve in this area with time under the tutelage of Mauro Tassotti), or particularly tall, Gattuso was a physically strong, consistent, aggressive, and hard-tackling midfielder, with an extremely high work rate; he also possessed a powerful shot, and quick reactions, as well as an excellent positional sense and good anticipation, which enabled him to excel in this position; in his prime, he was widely regarded as one of the best defensive midfielders in the world. His energetic and combative box-to-box style of play, as well as his pace, tactical awareness and abilities as a ball-winner, allowed him to form a successful midfield partnership with playmaker Andrea Pirlo throughout his career, both at club and international level. Gattuso&#x27;s deeper position on the pitch allowed him to support Pirlo and his other teammates defensively by breaking up the opposition&#x27;s attacks; he often only advanced in order to intercept the ball and play it to one of his more creative or offensive teammates after winning back possession, subsequently returning to his more defensive midfield role. His tenacity on the pitch, exemplified by his fierce challenges and stamina, earned him the nickname &quot;Ringhio&quot; (Snarl). In addition to his footballing abilities, he also stood out for his competitive spirit, determination, and leadership.

==Managerial career==
===Sion===
Gattuso started his coaching career in 2011 by attending a course for UEFA A Licence, when he still played for AC Milan. He passed the exam in July.

On 25 February 2013, Gattuso was named as the new manager of Sion after manager Víctor Muñoz was demoted to a scouting role after a 4–0 defeat by Thun in the Swiss Super League. Gattuso became the fifth manager of the club in the 2012–13 season. On 27 February 2013, Gattuso won his first match as a manager, beating Lausanne 2–0 away in a Swiss Cup match. Gattuso was sacked on 13 May 2013.

===Palermo===
Later in May 2013, he was heavily linked with the managerial post at Palermo, after the Sicilians were relegated to Serie B. On 3 June 2013, Maurizio Zamparini confirmed he had a verbal agreement with Gattuso, subjected to a contract release with then manager Giuseppe Sannino. The appointment was made official later on 19 June, after Gattuso rescinded his contract with Sion. Gattuso named Luigi Riccio as his assistant, with whom he worked at Sion. His experience as &quot;rosanero&quot; head coach was however short-lived, as he was sacked 25 September 2013 after achieving only two wins and a draw in the first six games of the league season.

During 2013–14 season, he also attended a course for UEFA Pro Licence, after which he passed the exam in September 2014.

===OFI Crete===
On 5 June 2014, Gattuso was appointed manager of Superleague Greece team OFI Crete.

While managing OFI Crete, in the first few months there were rumours that the players and coaching staff were not getting paid due to the poor financial situation of the club. Gattuso lashed out at media saying that it wasn&#x27;t true that he wanted to leave. Throughout the press conference, he threw out curse words and banged on the table.

On 26 October 2014 Gattuso tended his resignation as head coach of OFI Crete, following a 2–3 home loss to Asteras Tripolis, citing the club&#x27;s financial difficulties as one of the main reasons behind his decision. However, on the very next day he changed his mind after having been persuaded by the club supporters and the board to stay. On 30 December 2014, Gattuso officially resigned as OFI Crete manager, due to the club&#x27;s financial problems.

In January 2015, he applied for the manager&#x27;s position at Scottish club Hamilton Academical following the departure of Alex Neil.

===Pisa===
Gattuso was appointed as the manager of the then Lega Pro side Pisa on 20 August 2015. On 12 June 2016, he led Pisa to Serie B promotion after beating out Foggia 5–3 on aggregate in the Lega Pro promotion play-off final. On 31 July however, he suddenly left Pisa, citing &quot;serious, constant and unacceptable&quot; problems at the club being the reason for his departure. One month after leaving the club, he re-joined Pisa as the team&#x27;s head coach. However, in the following season, Pisa finishes in last place with the second best defense, but the worst attack in the league, and Gattuso resigns again, this time definitely.

===AC Milan (youth)===
In May 2017 Gattuso was appointed as the coach of AC Milan Primavera, the under-19 team of the club. He was the third former player who won 2007 UEFA Champions League, to coach the Primavera team, after Filippo Inzaghi (2013–14) and Cristian Brocchi (2014–2016). They also coached the first team, after the sacking of Clarence Seedorf (also a former Milan player and 2007 Champions League winner) and Siniša Mihajlović respectively.

As of round 10 of the Campionato Nazionale Primavera (which ended on 26 November), the Milan Primavera side was ranked third (out of 16 teams) in the league&#x27;s first division.

===AC Milan===
On 27 November 2017, Vincenzo Montella was sacked by AC Milan. Subsequently, they appointed Gattuso as the head coach of the first team, who left the position as the coach of the under-19s. He recorded his first win with a 2–1 home victory against Bologna in Serie A on 10 December. Milan finished the season in sixth place.

In April 2018, Gattuso&#x27;s contract was extended to 2021. In his first full season in charge, Milan missed out on Champions League by one point, finishing fifth on 68 points. On 28 May 2019, he departed Milan by mutual consent.

===Napoli===
On 11 December 2019, Gattuso was appointed head coach of Napoli following the sacking of Carlo Ancelotti the previous day.

On 13 June 2020, Napoli achieved a 1–1 home draw with Inter in the second leg of the Coppa Italia semi-finals, which allowed them to progress to the 2020 Coppa Italia final following a 2–1 aggregate victory; Gattuso dedicated the achievement to his sister, who had recently died. On 17 June, Napoli went on to win the final against Juventus 4–2 on penalties after a goalless draw.

On 23 May 2021, the final day of the league, Gattuso was unable to secure a fourth-place finish for Napoli after a 1–1 home draw with Verona, finishing fifth. One point below Juventus, who secured qualification to the following season&#x27;s Champions League after a victory at Bologna. The club&#x27;s chairman, Aurelio De Laurentiis, put an end to Gattuso&#x27;s tenure as the head coach of Napoli after one year and a half.

===Fiorentina===
On 25 May 2021, Fiorentina announced the appointment of Gattuso as their new head coach, effective from 1 July. However, on 17 June, just two weeks before his contract was due to begin, Gattuso and Fiorentina mutually rescinded the agreement.

===Valencia===
On 9 June 2022, Gattuso was unveiled as the new manager of Valencia, competing in the Spanish La Liga, on a two-season deal. In the process, he became the third Italian manager to manage the club, following Claudio Ranieri and Cesare Prandelli. On 30 January 2023, he left his position at Valencia by mutual consent with the club.

===Marseille===
On 27 September 2023, Gattuso signed as the new manager of French Ligue 1 side Marseille. On 19 February 2024, he was sacked after five months in charge.

===Hajduk Split===
On 12 June 2024, Croatian Football League club Hajduk Split announced Gattuso had signed a contract with the club until 2026.

==Style of management==
Tactically, Gattuso frequently uses the 4–3–3 formation as a manager, although he has been known to use the 3–4–3 and the 4–2–3–1. In contrast to his own defensive playing style, his teams instead tend to play out and build plays from the back, implementing a possession game based on technique and passing; his teams are also known for their intensity and team-work off the ball, with his teams using heavy pressing in order to win the ball back quickly. His style has therefore been likened to that of fellow former Napoli manager Maurizio Sarri&#x27;s in the Italian media. Gattuso is also known for fostering a positive team spirit as a manager through his humour, and for placing an importance on his teams having a fighting mentality.

==Personal life==
Gattuso is married to Monica Romano, a Scottish woman of Italian descent. Her father, Mario, was a millionaire restaurateur who died in 2011, and her sister is television presenter Carla Romano. They have two children.

In January 2010, Gattuso opened a fish shop in his home town of Corigliano Calabro, in province of Cosenza.

Gattuso is a Catholic, and when he played for Rangers, a club with a Protestant identity in the 1997–98 season, he alleged that his teammates ordered him to take off his crucifix necklace.

Gattuso&#x27;s sister, Francesca, died in June 2020 at the age of 37. She had been in intensive care since February.

Gattuso suffers from an auto-immune disease named ocular myasthenia since his days as a footballer. He opened up about his illness in late 2020 after he appeared on the pitch wearing an eyepatch during several games.

==Media==
In December 2003, Gattuso participated on the Italian version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, &quot;Chi vuol essere milionario?&quot;, alongside Christian Vieri during an episode organised for charity. The pair ended the game on the second-to-last question, winning €150,000. On the question before, when the pair were doubtful about the correct answer, Vincenzo Montella, one of the football players who were in the audience, invited them to walk away with €70,000 instead of taking the risk of answering incorrectly and dropping down to €16,000. Vieri playfully suggested selling the player (&quot;Ma vendetelo!&quot;), while Gattuso jokingly asked for Montella to be sent out of the studio as he was behaving like a jinx (&quot;Porta una sfiga Montella, mandatelo via!&quot;).

Gattuso features in EA Sports&#x27; FIFA football video game series; he was included in the Ultimate Team Legends in &quot;FIFA 16&quot; and later iterations of the game.

<text>Pelham (2016 population 17,110) is a town located in the centre of Niagara Region in Ontario, Canada.

The town&#x27;s southern boundary is formed by the Welland River, a meandering waterway that flows into the Niagara River. To the west is the township of West Lincoln, to the east the city of Welland and the city of Thorold, and to the north the city of St. Catharines and the town of Lincoln. North Pelham contains the picturesque Short Hills (see attractions). Two important creeks have their headwaters within Pelham; Coyle Creek, which flows south into the Welland River, and Twelve Mile creek, a spring-fed stream that flows north into Lake Ontario.

==History==
Pelham Township was part of the original Welland County since the late 1780s. The Town of Pelham (est. 1970) derives its name from Pelham Township, which John Graves Simcoe named in the 1790s. In the beginning, the townships were only numbered and not named. The policy of Simcoe was to adopt township names from England. Pelham was named after the Pelham family though it is uncertain which particular Pelham family member it is attributed to - either Henry Fiennes Pelham-Clinton (nephew to 2 Prime Ministers and considered powerful and influential) or Charles Anderson Pelham (a quiet MP who spoke only once in 26 years in the House of Commons). But in fact, it turns out that it was named after early landowner Joshua Pell&#x27;s family manor in Westchester County, New York—Pelham Manor—lost by the Loyalist Pells during the American Revolution (Pell went first in exile to Nova Scotia in 1783, before later being granted lands in the Niagara area after a direct appeal to George III.).

In 1922, the Village of Fonthill became a separate municipality by petitioning for land from the Township of Pelham and the Township of Thorold.

<text>Diplomats and Military Commanders for Change (DMCC) was an &quot;ad hoc&quot; organization of 27 retired and United States military officers and Foreign Service Officers who supported Democratic U.S. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts against incumbent Republican George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election.

The group was formed in Washington, D.C., on June 16, 2004, at the National Press Club. The group published an open letter that stated that President George W. Bush had &quot;failed in the primary responsibilities of preserving national security and providing world leadership&quot; and had harmed foreign relations so badly that only a new leader can repair them.

This statement is especially noteworthy because several of the signatories had supported George W. Bush when he ran for president in 2000, and a large number were appointed to positions by Republican presidents, including Bush&#x27;s father, President George H. W. Bush.

<text>Olivia Jane d&#x27;Abo (; born 22 January 1969) is a British actress and singer. She is known for her roles as Karen Arnold, Kevin Arnold&#x27;s rebellious teenaged hippie sister in the ABC comedy-drama series &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; (1988–1993), as female serial killer Nicole Wallace in &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, as Marie Blake on &quot;The Single Guy&quot; (1995–1997), and Jane Porter in &quot;The Legend of Tarzan&quot; (2001–2003). Her film appearances include roles in &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; (1984) and &quot;Bank Robber&quot; (1993).

==Early life and education==
D&#x27;Abo was born on 22 January 1969 in London, England, the daughter of Maggie London, an English model and actress primarily active in the 1960s, and Mike d&#x27;Abo, an English singer and member of 1960s musical group Manfred Mann. She has an older brother, two half-brothers and one half-sister: elder brother Ben, younger half-brother Bruno, and younger sibling twins Ella and Louis (born July 2007) on her father&#x27;s side. Olivia and Ben both attended high school in the United States at Los Feliz Hills School (formerly the Apple School) in Los Angeles, and d&#x27;Abo attended Pacoima Junior High School in Pacoima, Los Angeles.

She is the first cousin once removed of Maryam d&#x27;Abo (b. 1960), an actress best known for her performance as Kara Milovy in the 1987 James Bond film &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;. Olivia and Maryam bought a house together in Los Angeles when Olivia was 19 years old.

==Career==

===Acting career===
D&#x27;Abo&#x27;s film debut was the supporting role of Princess Jehnna in &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot;, released on 29 June 1984. Two months later, she appeared in the supporting role of Paloma the peasant girl in &quot;Bolero&quot; (1984).

D&#x27;Abo portrayed Karen Arnold in the ABC comedy-drama series &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; for the show&#x27;s first four seasons, from 1988 to 1991, with two guest star appearances in the show&#x27;s final two seasons. In 1992, she guest-starred in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode titled &quot;True Q&quot; as Amanda Rogers.

D’Abo played a lesbian visiting college professor/writer named Perry Marks, who became friends with Julia Salinger, for 3 episodes in season 5 (1999) of &quot;Party of Five&quot;.

An unreleased pilot for an ABC sitcom she led, &quot;Olivia Masters&#x27; Life&quot;, was released on her official website. The pilot shows young, tenacious American woman Olivia Masters as she tries to find her calling and acclimate herself into the professional world, which is not always professional or a breeze, as she finds out.

D&#x27;Abo made five appearances as a recurring villain Nicole Wallace in the NBC police procedural drama series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; between 2002 and 2008. She reprised the character in the 2013 episode &quot;The Catacombes&quot; in the French police procedural drama series &quot;Jo&quot;, a show created by René Balcer, who also created &quot;Criminal Intent&quot;.

In 2007, d&#x27;Abo played Abby Carter, the ex-wife of Sheriff Jack Carter, in the Sci-Fi Channel series &quot;Eureka&quot; for two episodes. She has had numerous supporting roles in other television series and films including &quot;The Spirit of &#x27;76&quot; (1990), &quot;Greedy&quot; (1994), &quot;The Big Green&quot; (1995), and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (2002).

<text>Poto and Cabengo (names given, respectively, by Grace and Virginia Kennedy to themselves) are American identical twins who used an invented language (Cryptophasia) until the age of about eight. 

The girls were apparently of normal intelligence. They developed their own communication as they had little exposure to spoken language in their early years. Poto and Cabengo were the names they called each other.

&quot;Poto and Cabengo&quot; is also the name of a documentary film about the girls made by Jean-Pierre Gorin and released in 1980.

== Birth ==
Grace and Virginia Kennedy were born in 1970 in Columbus, Georgia. Their birth was normal, and they were able to lift their heads and make eye contact with their parents within hours after birth, but both soon suffered apparent seizures. Their father maintained that a surgeon told him the girls might experience developmental disabilities. Apparently misunderstanding speculation for diagnosis, the girls&#x27; parents ceased to pay more attention to them than necessary.

== Early circumstances ==
Both parents were employed (although later characterized by &quot;The San Diego Tribune&quot; as living on &quot;food stamps and welfare&quot;) and spent many hours away from home. The girls were left in the care of a grandmother who met their physical needs but did not play or interact with them. The grandmother spoke only German, while the parents spoke English. They had no contact with other children, seldom played outdoors, and were not sent to school.

Their father later stated in interviews that he realized the girls had invented a language of their own, but, since their use of English remained extremely rudimentary, he had decided that they were, as the doctor suggested, developmentally challenged and that it would do no good to send them to school. When he lost his job, he told a caseworker at the unemployment office about his family; the caseworker advised him to put the girls in speech therapy. At the Children&#x27;s Hospital of San Diego, in California, speech therapists Ann Koeneke and Alexa Kratze discovered that Virginia and Grace had invented a complex idioglossia.

==Language==
The twins&#x27; language was characterized by an extremely fast tempo and a staccato rhythm, traits the girls transferred to their spoken English following speech therapy. Linguistic analysis revealed that their language was a mixture of English and German (their mother and grandmother were German born) with some neologisms and several idiosyncratic grammatical features.

The story of the &quot;twins who made their own language&quot; made the national newspapers in 1978 and was included in an edition of the &quot;People&#x27;s Almanac&quot;. Many speech and hearing experts and psychiatrists offered speculation as to why, in contrast to most idioglossic twins, the girls had failed to pick up English. Alexa Kratze pointed out that the girls had had very little contact with anyone outside their family and that contact within the family had been minimal at best, factors that contributed to the girls&#x27; developmental disability.

Once it was established that the girls could be educated, their father apparently forbade them to speak their personal language. He was quoted in &quot;Time&quot; magazine as saying: &quot;They don&#x27;t want to be associated as dummies. You live in a society, you got to speak the language.&quot; Asked if they remembered their language, the girls confirmed that they did, but their father gently chided them for &quot;lying.&quot; Despite being mainstreamed and placed in separate classes, the girls remained affected by their family&#x27;s emotional neglect. A follow-up as they approached the age of 30 revealed that Virginia worked on an assembly line in a supervised job training center, while Grace mopped floors at the fast-food restaurant McDonald&#x27;s.

==Sample speech extract==
:&quot;&quot;Pinit, putahtraletungay.&quot; (Finish, potato salad hungry.)
::&quot;Nis, Poto?&quot; (This, Poto?)
:&quot;Liba Cabingoat, it&quot;.&quot; (Dear Cabengo, eat.)
::&quot;&quot;Ia moa, Poto?&quot; (Here more, Poto?)
:&quot;Ya.&quot;&quot; (Yeah.)

<doc id="730857" wikidata="Q2303052" url="?curid=730857" title="Janet Hubert">
<text>Janet Louise Hubert (born January 13, 1956) is an American film and television actress and dancer. She is best known for playing the role of the original Vivian Banks on the sitcom &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; from its first season in 1990 until the end of its third season in 1993. Hubert was nominated for an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series for her role in 1991. Her performance as Mignon on the digital series &quot;King Ester&quot; garnered her first Daytime Emmy Award nomination in 2020.

==Early life==
Hubert was born in Chicago, Illinois and spent her early days growing up on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. At the age of nine she moved with her family to rural Chicago. She won a scholarship to the Juilliard School in New York City, but did not complete her studies.

==Career==
After performing in the national tour of &quot;Dancin&#x27;&quot;, Hubert made her Broadway debut in 1981, in the ensemble of &quot;The First&quot;, a short-lived musical about Jackie Robinson. Hubert created the role of Tantomile in the original Broadway production of &quot;Cats&quot;, and also understudied Grizabella and Demeter. She left &quot;Cats&quot; in April 1983 to star in the national tour of &quot;Sophisticated Ladies&quot;, opposite Dee Dee Bridgewater and Gregg Burge. Hubert played Aunt Viv on &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, the role she is most known for. After she was allegedly fired by the makers of &quot;The Fresh Prince&quot;, Hubert&#x27;s character was recast and played by Daphne Maxwell Reid for the remainder of the show&#x27;s run. At the time, Will Smith, the show&#x27;s star, claimed that Hubert &quot;brought her problems to work.&quot; Rumors then speculated that Smith had fired her following her departure. Hubert has since denied this, explaining that she had left the show after being informed that she had two months and a half of remaining on set and that she could not work on another project. Her role as Aunt Viv was subsequently played by actress Daphne Maxwell Reid.

Hubert was featured in a 2002 episode of &quot;Friends&quot; as Chandler&#x27;s boss. In 2005, she began playing the recurring role of Lisa Williamson, mother of attorney Evangeline Williamson, on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Her character has made occasional appearances since then. She was featured as Michel Gerard&#x27;s mother in an episode of the CW show &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;. She has made appearances on episodes of &quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot;, and &quot;Tyler Perry&#x27;s House of Payne&quot;, among others. In November 2018, it was announced that Hubert had been cast on the daytime soap opera, &quot;General Hospital&quot;; she made her debut as Yvonne on December 7, 2018.

Hubert appeared in &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Reunion&quot; on HBO Max in November 2020. During the special, she and Smith spoke for the first time since her departure from the show. Hubert discussed issues regarding her personal life, which included domestic violence, and revealed she had not been fired from the show as largely believed. Smith admitted that he was neither &quot;sensitive&quot; nor &quot;perceptive&quot; to Hubert&#x27;s situation and attributed his behavior to being &quot;very young&quot; and &quot;immature&quot; at the time. He has insisted that being a parent has taught him how to understand what she was dealing with and apologized for his actions. Hubert then joined the rest of the guests at the reunion.

Hubert appeared on FX&#x27;s &quot;Pose&quot; in season 3 as a family member of Billy Porter&#x27;s character, Pray Tell, alongside Jackée Harry and Anna Maria Horsford. In 2022, she appeared on &quot;The Ms. Pat Show&quot; as the title character&#x27;s mother-in-law, Jewell.

==Personal life==
In 1990, Hubert married James Whitten, who was verbally and physically abusive towards her until their split in 1994. From this marriage, she gave birth to a boy, Elijah Isaac Whitten. Hubert has been married to Larry Kraft since 2005.

She suffers from osteoporosis and is the ambassador of the National Osteoporosis Foundation.

<doc id="730866" wikidata="Q313415" url="?curid=730866" title="Asa of Judah">
<text>Asa (; ; ; ) was, according to the Hebrew Bible, the third king of the Kingdom of Judah and the fifth king of the House of David. Based on the Biblical chronology, Biblical scholars suggest that he reigned from the late 10th to early 9th century BCE. He was succeeded by Jehoshaphat, his son (by Azubah). According to Edwin R. Thiele&#x27;s chronology, when Asa became very ill, he made Jehoshaphat coregent. Asa died two years into the coregency.

Asa son of Abijah was zealous in maintaining the traditional worship of God, and in rooting out idolatry, with its accompanying immoralities. After concluding a battle with Zerah of Ethiopia in the 10th year of his reign, there was peace in Judah () until the 36th year of Asa&#x27;s reign (). In his 36th year, he was confronted by Baasha, king of Israel. He formed an alliance with Ben-Hadad I, king of Aram-Damascus, and using a monetary bribe, convinced him to break his peace treaty with Baasha and invade the Northern Kingdom (). He died greatly honoured by his people, and was considered for the most part a righteous king. He threw the prophet Hanani in jail and &quot;oppressed some of the people at the same time&quot; (2 Chronicles 16:10). It is also recorded of Asa that in his old age, when afflicted with a foot disease, he &quot;sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians&quot;.

== Family ==
Asa is typically understood as the son of Abijam. Some scholars believe the biblical accounts of Asa&#x27;s family to be contradictory; however, a study of Hebrew linguistics removes any seeming contradictions. One of the alleged contradictions is that Maacah (Abijah&#x27;s mother) is sometimes described as the daughter of Absalom, and elsewhere the daughter of Uriel. Absalom is described as only having one daughter, Tamar. In Hebrew, &quot;daughter&quot; and &quot;granddaughter&quot; are the same word, removing any contradiction there. Similarly, Maacah is initially described as Abijah&#x27;s mother, but subsequently described as the mother of his son Asa. However, in Hebrew, &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;grandmother&quot; are the same word, once again removing any contradiction. Other scholars, however, think that had Asa’s mother not been Maacah, her name would have been given, as his father Abijam had many other wives (J. M. Myers, &quot;The Anchor Bible&quot;, II Chronicles, Garden City, NY, Doubleday, 1965).

== Purging of idolatry ==
Azariah son of Oded, a wiseman and prophet, exhorted Asa to reinforce strict national observance of The Law given to Moses, and Asa paid heed. He purged the land of foreign religions and false idols and the nation and YHWH entered into a renewed covenant. At this time, the current &quot;gəḇīrā&quot;, Maʿacah, was deposed for her worship of Asherah and for making an &quot;ʾăšērā&quot;. This worship was in-line with local beliefs and practices, which were observed by the native peoples, and may or may not have been part of the official state religion. Finally, when the religious transition was completed in Asa&#x27;s fifteenth year, a great feast was held in Jerusalem at Solomon&#x27;s Temple (). At that time, many northerners, particularly from the tribes Ephraim and Manasseh, migrated to the Kingdom of Judah because of the fruitful golden age in Judah, and the internal conflict in Israel after the fall of the dynasty of Jeroboam I.

== Wars and defense projects ==
Taking advantage of 35 years of peace, Asa revamped and reinforced the fortress cities originally built by his grandfather Rehoboam. 2 Chronicles reports that Asa also repelled a raid by the Egyptian-backed chieftain Zerah the Ethiopian, whose million men and 300 chariots were defeated by Asa&#x27;s 580,000 men in the Valley of Zephath, near Mareshah (). According to Steven Shawn Tuell, the biblical numbers given in this passage are &quot;completely unrealistic&quot;. The Bible does not state whether Zerah was a pharaoh or a general of the army. The Ethiopians were pursued all the way to Gerar, in the coastal plain, where they stopped out of sheer exhaustion. The resulting peace kept Judah free from Egyptian incursions until the time of Josiah, some centuries later.

In Asa&#x27;s 36th year, King Baasha of Israel attacked the Kingdom of Judah (; the Seder Olam and some later commentators take this as the 36th year since the division of the kingdom, not the 36th year of Asa&#x27;s reign.) Alteratively it could be interpreted as 26th year of Asa&#x27;s reign and the last year of Baasha&#x27;s life. Baasha built the fortress of Ramah on the border, less than ten miles from Jerusalem. The result was that the capital was under pressure and the military situation was precarious. Asa took gold and silver from the Temple and the palace of the king and sent them to Ben-Hadad I, king of Aram - Damascus, in exchange for the Damascene king terminating his peace treaty with Baasha. As a consequence, Ben-Hadad I attacked Ijon, Dan, and many important cities of the tribe of Naphtali, and Baasha was forced to withdraw from Ramah. Asa tore down the unfinished fortress and used its raw materials to fortify Geba and Mizpah, on his side of the border.

== Later years ==
Hanani the Seer, a prophet, admonished Asa for relying on the King of Syria (or specifically in some interpretations; Damascus) as opposed to Divine help in defeating Baasha (). Asa became very angry and threw Hanani in jail. Asa was also not as just as he had been and oppressed some of the people. In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa developed a severe disease in his feet, for which he sought the help of physicians, not the Lord (). In Thiele&#x27;s chronology, Asa made his son Jehoshaphat coregent in the year that saw the onset of his disease. Asa died two years later and was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem, in the grave that he had dug for himself, and a pyre was lit in his honor ().

==Rabbinic literature==
The question that puzzled Heinrich Ewald and others, &quot;Where was the brazen serpent until the time of Hezekiah?&quot; occupied the Talmudists also. They answered it as follows: Asa and Joshaphat, when clearing away the idols, purposely left the brazen serpent behind, in order that Hezekiah might also be able to do a praiseworthy deed in breaking it.

According to the Rabbis, Asa was one of the five men who were distinguished by certain physical perfections possessed by Adam, but due having abused them, were afflicted in those very body parts. Samson was distinguished by his strength, but &quot;his strength went from him&quot; (Judges 16:19); Saul by towering with his neck above the rest, but &quot;he took a sword and fell upon it&quot; (I Sam. 31:4); Absalom by his long hair, but &quot;his head caught of the oak&quot; (II Sam. 18:9); Zedekiah by his eyes, but &quot;they put out the eyes of Zedekiah&quot; (II Kings 25:7); Asa by his feet but &quot;in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet&quot; (I Kings 15:23) (perhaps with gout). The reason given for Asa&#x27;s condition was that, when enlisting the whole of Judah in war he &quot;exempted none&quot; (I Kings 15:22), but forced Torah scholars—and even newly married husbands, whom the Law (Deut. 20:7) exempts—to march along.

The chronological discrepancy between and is readjusted by the interpretation that the 36th year of Chronicles refers to the 36 years of the secession of the northern kingdom, which was a punishment for the 36 years of Solomon&#x27;s marriage to the daughter of Pharaoh, and ended in reality in the 15th year of Asa&#x27;s reign, when Zerah the Ethiopian was vanquished by him; the alliance between the kingdoms of Israel and Syria (I Kings xi. 23) also lasted 36 years. In obtaining an alliance with the king of Syria against Baasha by giving away the gold and silver treasures of the house of the Lord (I Kings 15:18), Asa sinned grievously, for which Hanani, the seer, sternly rebuked him (II Chronicles 16:7).

Asa, having contracted a matrimonial alliance with the wicked house of Omri, brought about the decree of Heaven that after 42 years both the houses of David and of Omri should go down together, which nearly happened in the time of Ahaziah, wherefore the latter is said to have been 42 years old when he ascended the throne (II Chron. xxii. 2) in contradiction with xxi. 20, and II Kings viii. 26.

Among the treasures which Asa took from Zerah the Ethiopian, and which Zerah had taken from Shishak (II Chronicles 12:9, compare 16:2), there was also the marvelous throne of Solomon upon which all the kings of Judah subsequently sat; while the other great treasures were given by Asa to the king of Syria to obtain his alliance; then they were taken again by the Ammonites, to be recaptured by Jehoshaphat; then they fell into the hands of Sennacherib, from whom Hezekiah recovered them, and at the capture of Jerusalem they came into the hands of the Babylonians; then into those of the Persians, and afterward of the Macedonians, and finally of the Romans, who kept them at Rome.

==Chronological notes==
William F. Albright has dated his reign to 913–873 BCE, while E. R. Thiele offers the dates 911/910–870/869 BCE. Thiele&#x27;s chronology for the first kings of Judah contained an internal inconsistency that later scholars corrected by dating these kings one year earlier, so that Asa&#x27;s dates are taken as 912/911 to 871/870 BC in the present article. 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles describe his reign in a favorable manner. They both give his reign as lasting 41 years.

According to Thiele, the calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). Cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms therefore often allow narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king to within a six-month range. For Asa, the Bible allows the narrowing of his accession to some time between Tishri 1 of 912 BC and the day before Nisan 1 of the 911 BCE. For calculation purposes, this should be taken as the Judean year beginning in Tishri of 912/911 BCE. His death occurred at some time between Tishri 1 of 871 BCE and Nisan 1 of 870 BCE. These dates are one year earlier than those given in the third edition of Thiele&#x27;s &quot;Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings&quot;, thereby correcting an internal inconsistency that Thiele never resolved.

<text>Tampereen Ilves, commonly referred to as Ilves, (; Finnish for &quot;Lynx&quot;) is a Finnish professional ice hockey team based in Tampere. They play in the Liiga at the Nokia Arena.

The colors of Ilves, green, yellow, and black, were taken from what was then the coat of arms of the city of Tampere.

==History==
With sixteen championships, Ilves is the second most successful hockey team in the Finnish championship league, the Liiga, after their local rival Tappara. The club was founded in the spring of 1931, and it played its first game against Tampereen Palloilijat the next winter. In the late 1930s, Ilves won three Finnish championship titles as the first Tampere-based hockey team.

After World War II, Ilves started playing its home games at the then new Koulukatu ice rink. It had another championship spree in 1945–1947 when it stayed undefeated for over four years (albeit playing only 36 games during that period).

In 1954, Ilves was for the first and so far only time relegated to the second highest level of Finnish hockey but managed to return to the top tier only one year later.

The current logo was designed by Rauno Broms in 1963. In 1965, Ilves moved, along with its local rivals Tappara and KooVee, to the new Hakametsä arena, where they played until 2021.

The last Finnish Cup competition in hockey was held in 1971. Ilves won the title and has therefore been the reigning champion since. In 1972, it also won another league championship; its 15th championship in total.

During the late 1970s, Ilves went through lean times. Finally, when Koovee, which was in no better condition, was relegated at the end of the 1979–80 season, the two clubs decided to sign an agreement of cooperation. The best players of Koovee moved to Ilves, the most notable of them being Risto Jalo.

In 1985, Ilves claimed its 16th and most recent championship. Along with Risto Jalo, the key players of that team were Raimo Helminen, Mikko Mäkelä, Ville Siren, and Jukka Tammi. Repeating this success proved difficult, however, when in the following summer four players left the team to play in the NHL.

In the late 1980s, Ilves had another brief stint of moderate success when coached by Sakari Pietilä. It finished first after the regular season in 1988 but was eliminated in the first round of playoffs. The next year it came away with a bronze medal, and finally in 1990 it reached the finals, only to lose to TPS.

For most of the 1990s, the club struggled with financial problems and unclear issues concerning ownership. In sports performance, the low point was in the spring of 1995, when Ilves finished last in the SM-liiga and had to fight the lower league teams SaPKo and SaiPa for their place among the elite for the next year.

Ilves managed to avoid relegation and was promptly reborn as a viable championship candidate, reaching the semifinals in 1997 and the finals a year after that.

The 2000s were a fairly mediocre period in Ilves history. After their bronze medal win in 2001, Ilves lost in the first round of the playoffs in six of the next seven seasons and missing the playoffs altogether in 2003. They managed to avoid relegation in 2010, 2012 and 2013.

<text>Milnrow is a town within the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, in Greater Manchester, England. It lies on the River Beal at the foothills of the South Pennines, and forms a continuous urban area with Rochdale. It is east of Rochdale town centre, north-northeast of Manchester, and spans from Windy Hill in the east to the Rochdale Canal in the west. Milnrow is adjacent to junction 21 of the M62 motorway, and includes the village of Newhey, and hamlets at Tunshill and Ogden.
Historically in Lancashire, Milnrow during the Middle Ages was one of several hamlets in the township of Butterworth and parish of Rochdale. The settlement was named by the Anglo-Saxons, but the Norman conquest of England resulted in its ownership by minor Norman families, such as the Schofields and Cleggs. In the 15th century, their descendants successfully agitated for a chapel of ease by the banks of the River Beal, triggering its development as the main settlement in Butterworth. Milnrow was primarily used for marginal hill farming during the Middle Ages, and its population did not increase much until the dawn of the woollen trade in the 17th century.

With the development of packhorse routes to emerging woollen markets in Yorkshire, the inhabitants of Milnrow adopted the domestic system, supplementing their income by fellmongering and producing flannel in their weavers&#x27; cottages. Coal mining and metalworking also flourished in the Early Modern period, and the farmers, colliers and weavers formed a &quot;close-knit population of independent-minded workers&quot;. The hamlets of Butterworth coalesced around the commercial and ecclesiastical centre in Milnrow as demand for the area&#x27;s flannel grew. In the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution supplanted domestic woollen industries and converted the area into a mill town, with cotton spinning as the principal industry. Mass-produced textile goods from Milnrow&#x27;s cotton mills were exported globally with the arrival of the railway in 1863. The Milnrow Urban District was established in 1894 and was governed by the district council until its abolition in 1974.

Deindustrialisation and suburbanisation occurred throughout the 20th century resulting in the loss of coal mining and cotton spinning. Milnrow was merged in to the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale in 1974, and has since become suburban to Rochdale. However, the area has retained &quot;a distinct and separate character&quot;, and has been described as &quot;the centre of the south Lancashire dialect&quot;. John Collier (who wrote under the pseudonym of Tim Bobbin) is acclaimed as an 18th-century caricaturist and satirical poet who produced Lancashire-dialect works during his time as Milnrow&#x27;s schoolmaster. Rochdale-born poet Edwin Waugh was influenced by Collier&#x27;s work, and wrote an extensive account of Milnrow during the mid-19th century in a tribute to him. Milnrow has continued to grow in the 21st century, spurred by its connectivity to road, rail and motorway networks. Surviving weavers&#x27; cottages are among Milnrow&#x27;s listed buildings, while the Ellenroad Steam Museum operates as an industrial heritage centre.

==History==
The earliest evidence of human activity comes from the Mesolithic peoples, who left thousands of flint tools on the moorland surrounding Milnrow. A hunter-gatherer site was excavated by the Piethorne Brook in 1982, revealing a Mesolithic camp from which deer were hunted. Neolithic activity is evidenced with a flint axe found at Newhey and a black stone axe found by Hollingworth Lake. Excavations at Piethorne Reservoir in the mid-19th century combined with surveys during the 1990s revealed a spear-head (with a blade) and ceramics respectively dated to Bronze Age Britain. A Bronze-Age tumulus, funerary urn, and stone hammer or battle axe were discovered at Low Hill in 1879. They imply the presence of Celtic Britons. During the British Iron Age, this part of Britain was occupied by the Brigantes, but, despite ancient kilns used for dry ironstone smelting found at Tunshill, it is unlikely that the tribe was attracted to the natural resources and landscape of the Milnrow area on a lasting basis. Remains of a silver statue of the Roman goddess Victoria and Roman coins were discovered at Tunshill Farm in 1793, and it is surmised that Romans traversed this area in communication with the Castleshaw Roman Fort. Construction in the Victorian era is likely to have destroyed any other artifacts from the Stone Age, Bronze Age or Roman Britain. 

The land was delineated during the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain. It is theorised that this portion of the Manor of Rochdale was a seasonal enclosure for livestock farming and butter production, giving rise to the name Butterworth. The Old English name is interpreted as meaning an &quot;enclosed pastureland that provides good butter&quot;, using the suffix &quot;-worth&quot; typically applied to upland pastures in the South Pennines. Butterworth was applied to a broad area, within which was Milnrow, which also has English toponymy implying Anglo-Saxon habitation. The meaning of the name Milnrow may mean a &quot;mill with a row of houses&quot;, combining the Old English elements &quot;myne&quot; and &quot;raw&quot;, or &quot;myln&quot; and &quot;rāw&quot;, or it may be a corruption of an old pronunciation of &quot;Millner Howe&quot;, a water-driven corn mill at a place called Mill Hill on the River Beal that was mentioned in deeds dating from 1568. Another explanation is that it is derived from a family with the name Milne, who owned a row of houses; a map from 1292 shows &quot;Milnehouses&quot; at Milnrow, other spellings have included &quot;Mylnerowe&quot; (1545) and &quot;Milneraw&quot; (1577). Physical evidence of Anglo-Saxons or Norsemen comes from monastic inscribed stones—one of which has Latin text—discovered in 1986 at Lowhouse Farm. The stones were dated to the Viking Age in the 9th-century.

Seasonal farming practiced in Butterworth during the Early Middle Ages gave way to permanent settlements after the Norman conquest of England in 1066; the Norman families of &quot;de Butterworths&quot;, &quot;de Turnaghs&quot;, &quot;de Schofields&quot;, &quot;de Birchinleghs&quot;, &quot;de Wylds&quot; and &quot;Cleggs&quot; were the new keepers of Butterworth, in the hamlets of Belfield, Bleaked-gate-cum-Roughbank, Butterworth Hall, Clegg, Haughs, Lowhouse, Milnrow, Newhey, Ogden, Tunshill, and Wildhouse. Records relating to these hamlets in the High Middle Ages are vague or incomplete, but show land was owned variously by the families, the Elland family, the Holland family, the Byron family, or the Knights Hospitaller. The Byron family were endowed land in Milnrow during Norman times, and their descendants include the Barons Byron in the peerage of England. In 1253, King Henry III granted rights to the Knights Hospitaller to conduct the trials of suspected thieves, regulate the production and sale of food using the Assize of Bread and Ale, and erect a gallows for public executions. Butterworth had no church, it was part of the parish of Rochdale with ties to St Chad&#x27;s Church in Rochdale. The scattered community in and around Butterworth was primarily agricultural, and centered on hill farming. An oratory was licensed by the Bishop of Lichfield in 1400 for use as a chantry by the Byron family, and a chapel of ease for the wider community followed in 1496. A document dated 20 March 1496 from the reign of Henry VII, proclaims that open land by the River Beal at Milnrow would be the site of the new chapel, distinguishing it as a chapelry, and prompting its development as the principal settlement. Milnrow Chapel struggled to be viable, and depended on donations. Interference from donors led to accusations of corruption and its confiscation by the Crown at the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

Shallow coal mining was recorded at Milnrow in 1610, while legal documents dated 1624 state that there were six cottages at Milnrow; with a further nine at Butterworth Hall, and three at Ogden. Millstone Grit was the main building material of the time, used for dry stone farmhouses and field boundaries. Milnrow stayed this way throughout the Late Middle Ages— its chapel appearing intermittently in records— until woollen weaving was introduced. Beginning as a subsidiary occupation, the carding, spinning, and handloom weaving of woollen cloth in the domestic system became the staple industry of Milnrow in the 17th century. This was supported by the development of medieval trans-Pennine packhorse tracks, such as Rapes Highway routed from Milnrow to Marsden, allowing access to woollen markets in Yorkshire and enabling commercial prosperity and expansion. Fulling and textile bleaching was introduced, and Milnrow became &quot;especially known for fellmongering&quot;, and &quot;distinguished for its manufacture of flannels&quot;. Demand for Milnrow flannel began to outstrip its supply of wool, resulting in imports from Ireland and the English Midlands. An estimated 40,000–50,000 sheep hides were ordered every week, and Milnrow&#x27;s William Clegg Company established what was said to be the largest fellmongering yard in England. Trade tokens were struck in Milnrow by local metalworkers to supplement a shortage of coins. Sandstone was quarried in the late-17th century, providing Milnrow with the material to extend the fully reinstated Milnrow Chapel in 1715, as well as new three-storey &quot;fine stone domestic workshops&quot; or weavers&#x27; cottages during the 18th century. These had dwelling quarters on the lower floors and loom-shops on the top floor. Milnrow became a village of working class traders who used Rochdale as a central marketing and finishing hub; the curate of Milnrow remarked that the gentry and yeomen classes had all left the area by 1800. Road links to other markets were enhanced during the late-18th century, culminating in an Act of Parliament passed in 1805 to create a turnpike from Newhey to Huddersfield.

During surveys and excavations by Oxford Archaeology in the Kingsway Business Park, ten yeoman houses were identified dating to the seventeenth and early part of the eighteenth centuries. These included Moss Side Farm, Lower and Higher Moss Side Farms, Cherry Tree Farm, Lower Lane Farm, Pyche, Lane End and Castle Farm 

Middleton-born Radical writer Samuel Bamford wrote that at the beginning of the 19th century &quot;such a thing as a cotton or woollen factory was not in existence&quot; in Milnrow. By 1815, three commercial manufacturers had established woollen mills in Milnrow. while topographer James Butterworth wrote that Newhey consisted of &quot;several ranges of cottages and two public houses&quot; in 1828. The Industrial Revolution introduced the factory system which was adopted by the local inhabitants; the River Beal was the main power source for new woollen weaving mills and technologies. Construction of large mechanised cotton mills in nearby Oldham was admired by business owners in Milnrow, prompting them to build similar factories; the principal occupation remained as wool weaving, but cotton spinning and chainmaking was introduced. Unusually for the period and region, women in particular were employed as chainmakers by Milnrow&#x27;s blacksmiths during the 19th century. Nationally, the factory system and the Corn Laws combined to reduce wages and increase food prices in the early-1840s, leading to protests and disorder at Milnrow in August 1842; the Riot Act was read and the 11th Hussars were deployed to restore order and protect burgeoning mills and their owners from harm. The Corn Laws were repealed in 1846, and Ordnance Survey maps show Milnrow to have had three woollen mills, and one cotton mill by 1848. The Oldham Corporation obtained compulsory purchase rights in 1858 to acquire and dam the Piethorne Brook, completing the Piethorne Reservoir in 1863. The construction of rectangular multi-storey brick cotton mills followed, and &quot;The British Trade Journal&quot; noted that cottages in Milnrow and Newhey were &quot;in great demand&quot;. Terraced houses with slate roofs and facades of stone or red brick were built in rows to house an influx of workers and families. Streets and roads were cobbled, and transport was horse-drawn or by the Rochdale Canal. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway opened the Oldham Loop railway line in 1863, with stations at Milnrow and Newhey—the latter gave rise to the &quot;industrial village&quot; of Newhey, with mills and housing built concentrically outwards from the railway line. Butterworth Hall Colliery opened in 1865. However, public street lighting was not widely available until after a dispute was heard by the House of Lords in April 1869. Providers of gas lighting in the neighbouring Municipal Borough of Rochdale originally overlooked Milnrow because they had &quot;not thought it worth their while extending their mains into a thinly populated district&quot;, but later conceded &quot;there had been a great increase of population&quot; and it was &quot;thriving&quot;. In the 1870s, wool was supplanted by cotton &quot;with success&quot;. Ring spinning companies – some of the earliest in the UK – were formed by local influential businessmen, giving rise to Milnrow&#x27;s reputation as a company town—the Heap business family exercised significant deferential and political influence upon the newly-formed Milnrow Local Board of Health from their Cliffe House home in Newhey. Inspired by the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, and using the Rochdale Principles, consumers&#x27; co-operative groups were established at Milnrow, Newhey, Ogden and Firgrove throughout the second half of the 19th century. In 1885, municipal buildings were developed for the Milnrow Local Board, while an act of parliament empowered the Oldham Corporation to make further purchases in the Piethorne Valley so as to create additional reservoirs. An elected urban district council was established for the &quot;thriving town&quot; of Milnrow and its hinterland in 1894, followed by the introduction of new amenities: a golf course at Tunshill in 1901, and a Carnegie library at Milnrow in 1907. A steam-powered tram system connected to Rochdale was authorised for Milnrow in 1904, but was resisted—and later abandoned—by the district&#x27;s &quot;influential folk&quot; who felt that &quot;drawing the two communities closer&quot; would result in &quot;hastening the annexation&quot; of Milnrow in to Rochdale. Milnrow Council approved terms with Rochdale Corporation Tramways in 1909 for an electric-powered street-level passenger tramway running from Firgrove in the west to Newhey in the south.
Cotton spinning was the principal industry in Milnrow in the 1910s—Newhey alone had ten cotton mills employing over 2,000 people at 1911, while Butterworth Hall Colliery was the largest colliery in the Rochdale region, employing around 300 men in 1912. These workers were able to travel Milnrow&#x27;s completed tramway from 1912, which passed by Dale Street, Milnrow&#x27;s central thoroughfare lined with banks, butchers, confectioners, chemists and drapers. Ten years after it was first proposed, in 1913, a new Anglican parish church of St Ann was consecrated at Belfield at its boundary with Firgrove so as to serve the swell in population across the Rochdale-Milnrow boundary and ease pressure at Milnrow&#x27;s Anglican parish church. An outbreak of smallpox occurred in 1914; an investigation by the Royal Society of Medicine to link the infection with imported cotton bales from Brazil, Mexico, Peru or the United States was inconclusive. The &quot;most disastrous fire on record&quot; in the Milnrow area resulted in the &quot;spectacular&quot; destruction of Newhey&#x27;s Ellenroad Mill in 1916, at a cost of £150,000 (£ in 2025), but with no loss of life. Tank Week, a national touring campaign to help fund the British heavy tanks of World War I, came to Milnrow resulting in a collective donation of £180,578 (£ in 2025) from the people of the district. Upon conclusion of the war, the National Savings Movement praised the people of Milnrow for their donation, and in May 1919 presented the district with a 23-ton female Mark IV tank for permanent public display in Milnrow. Butterworth Hall Colliery closed in 1928, and poor maintenance forebode the closure of Milnrow&#x27;s tramway in 1932. In 1934, Milnrow Council agreed that its publicly displayed World War I tank had become &quot;an eyesore&quot; and &quot;a potential source of danger to children&quot;, and consequently sold and removed it for scrap. In the same year, Milnrow Council was gifted land in Firgrove to be used as a public sports pitch. Social housing estates of semi-detached properties with gardens were constructed in both Milnrow and Newhey during the 1930s, while roads in Newhey were laid by German prisoners of war during World War II. Over 500 municipal homes were built between 1930 and 1950, which Chris Davies MP described in Parliament as &quot;good, solid, middle-of-the-road housing [...] typical examples of some of the best council housing built in Britain&quot;. Cliffe House at Newhey, formerly occupied by the prominent Heap manufacturing family, was demolished and in 1952 its grounds were opened as the recreational and publicly owned Milnrow Memorial Park. Following the Great Depression, the region&#x27;s textile sector experienced a decline until its eventual demise in the mid-20th century. Milnrow&#x27;s last standing cotton mill was Butterworth Hall Mill, demolished in the late 1990s. Milnrow experienced population growth and suburbanisation in the second half of the 20th century, spurred by the construction of the M62 motorway through the area, making Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire commutable. The Pennine Drive housing estate was constructed in the mid-1980s. A restoration project to reopen the dilapidated Rochdale Canal resulted in Firgrove Bridge, at Milnrow&#x27;s boundary with Rochdale, being rebuilt in October 2001; a Bellway-constructed housing estate was built next to the canal between 2005 and 2007. Milnrow tram stop opened as part of Greater Manchester&#x27;s light-rail Metrolink network on 28 February 2013. Although its route through Milnrow was carefully planned to mitigate against bad weather conditions, the local section of the M62 was made impassable by the &quot;Beast from the East&quot; cold weather wave in March 2018. Stranded motorists were invited in to homes and offered food and shelter by &quot;kindhearted&quot; volunteers in Milnrow and Newhey while the British Army cleared the motorway.

==Governance==

Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century, Milnrow was a component area of Butterworth, an ancient rural township within the parish of Rochdale and hundred of Salford. Under feudalism, Butterworth was governed by a number of ruling families, including the Byrons, who would later be granted the title of Baron Byron, or Lord of the Manor of Rochdale. The Knights Hospitaller held powers in Butterworth- by way of a grant from King Henry III of England in the 13th century, they were able to hold legal trials of suspected thieves, exercise the Assize of Bread and Ale, and perform public hangings. Throughout the Late Middle Ages, local men acted as jurors and constables for the purposes of upholding law and order in Butterworth. By 1825, there were several villages in Butterworth including Butterworth Hall, Haugh, Lady Houses, Little Clegg, Newhey, Ogden, Moorhouse, Schofield Hall and Milnrow itself, which was distinguished from the others as Butterworth&#x27;s only chapelry. Butterworth in the 19th century constituted a civil parish, until its dissolution in 1894.

Milnrow&#x27;s ratepayers rejected a proposal to create a local board of health—a tax-funded regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation—on 14 June 1869, but a vote held on 17 December 1869 ended 546 to 466 in favour. The Milnrow Local Board of Health, with jurisdiction over the wards of Belfield, Haugh and Milnrow, was approved by central government on 2 February 1870 in accordance with the Local Government Act 1858. Its 18 members convened for the first time on 18 August 1870, and gave Milnrow its first measure of democratic self-governance. James Heap, of the local Heap manufacturing family, was the first chairman, and the Heaps&#x27; influence on local politics gave rise to Milnrow&#x27;s reputation as a company town. In 1872, Milnrow Local Board of Health protested against proposals drawn by the Rochdale Corporation to combat water pollution in the River Roch and the River Beal, claiming that prohibiting the use of the Beal for its industrial and untreated human effluent would be &quot;a sad blow to manufacturers and consequently to the working classes&quot;. In 1879, the Firgrove part of the Castleton township and further parts of Butterworth township were incorporated into the jurisdiction of the local board. Milnrow Town Hall was completed in 1888. Under the Local Government Act 1894, the area of the local board broadly became the Milnrow Urban District, a local government unit with elected councillors, in concord with the Rochdale Poor Law Union, and sharing power with Lancashire County Council as a constituent district of the administrative county of Lancashire. Milnrow Urban District bordered the larger County Borough of Rochdale to the west, a politically independent authority which had been absorbing smaller neighbouring authorities—such as the Castleton Urban District in 1900 and the Norden Urban District in 1933—resulting in Milnrow people being &quot;a little afraid of the borough and [...] annexation&quot;. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Milnrow Urban District was abolished, and Milnrow has, since 1 April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale, within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. In anticipation of the new local government arrangement, Milnrow Urban District Council applied for successor parish status to be granted to the locality after 1974, but the application was not successful.

From 1983 to 1997, Milnrow was represented in the House of Commons as part of the parliamentary constituency of Littleborough and Saddleworth. Between 1997 and 2010 it was within the boundaries of Oldham East and Saddleworth. In 2010 Milnrow became part of the Rochdale constituency, which, as of 2017, is represented by Tony Lloyd MP, a member of the Labour Party. In 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted Milnrow as part of a &quot;traditional heartland&quot;, where a &quot;well of loyalty [for Labour] runs deep in the Pennine towns between Rochdale and Oldham&quot;, while the 2002 &quot;Almanac of British Politics&quot; affirms Milnrow&#x27;s residents &quot;are willing to elect Liberal Democrat councillors&quot;. Conservative clubs, Liberal clubs, and working men&#x27;s clubs were established in Milnrow and Firgrove during the 19th and 20th centuries.

==Geography==
At (53.6101°, −2.1111°), and north-northwest of central London, the centre of Milnrow stands roughly above sea level, on the western slopes of the South Pennines, north-northeast of Manchester city centre. Blackstone Edge and Saddleworth are to the east; Rochdale and Shaw and Crompton are to the west and south respectively. Considered as the area covered by the former Milnrow Urban District, Milnrow extends over , stretching from the Rochdale Canal in the west through to Windy Hill in the east, taking in the valley of the River Beal. The Beal, a tributary of the River Roch, runs centrally through Milnrow from the south through Newhey. The smaller Butterworth Hall Brook, which flows in to the Beal, runs east-to-west, while Stanney Brook rises at High Crompton and runs along the southern edge of Milnrow and in to the Roch at Newbold in Rochdale.

The 2001 &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Geographical Dictionary&quot; recounts Milnrow as both a town and a southeasterly suburb of Rochdale. The Office for National Statistics designates Milnrow as part of the Greater Manchester Built-up Area, the United Kingdom&#x27;s second largest conurbation. Milnrow is situated in &quot;the transitional zone&quot; between the moorland of the South Pennines and the more densely populated areas of Rochdale and Manchester. Most development has been built concentrically outwards from two centres by the River Beal in Milnrow and Newhey, but land use transitions as the height of the ground rises towards the Pennines – from commercial and industrial, to housing and suburban development, to enclosed farms and pastures, and finally unenclosed moorland at the highest points. Ancient woodland is sparse; of woodland and plantation was recorded across Milnrow in 1911. Housing includes 18th-century cottages and farmhouses, late-19th century terraced houses, inter-war social housing, and modern detached and semi-detached private family homes. Farmland typically consists of undulating pastures used for stock rearing and rough grazing, interspersed by isolated farmhouses and the Kitcliffe, Ogden and Tunshill hamlets. Moorland forms the highest and most easterly part of Milnrow—the highest point is Bleakedgate Moor at , which forms a boundary with the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham by Denshaw. Windy Hill is another high-point amongst these moors.

Milnrow&#x27;s soil is typically light gravel and clay, with subsoil of rough gravel, and the underlying geology is mostly lower coal measures from the Carboniferous period, punctuated with a band of sandstone. Milnrow experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year.

In 1855, the poet Edwin Waugh said of Milnrow:

The urban part of Milnrow broadly consists of development which has absorbed former hamlets including Butterworth Hall, Firgrove, Gallows, and Moorhouse. These now form neighbourhoods of Milnrow, but others form distinct settlements. For instance, Newhey, at the south of Milnrow, emerged as a village in its own right, with its own distinct amenities such as shops, parish church and Metrolink station. Kitcliffe, Ogden and Tunshill, to the east of central Milnrow, are hamlets that occupy the upper, mid and lower Piethorne Valley respectively. The Gallows area is signified by The Gallows public house—it is a former hamlet which now forms a neighbourhood. This area occupies an ancient execution site, established by the Knights Hospitaller in 1253. All continue to form a composite Milnrow area within the borough of Rochdale.

==Demography==
In 1855, the Rochdale-born poet Edwin Waugh described Milnrow&#x27;s inhabitants as &quot;a hardy moor-end race, half farmers, half woollen weavers&quot;. Milnrow has been described as &quot;the centre of the south Lancashire dialect&quot;, while the accent of the town&#x27;s inhabitants has been described variously as &quot;strong&quot;, &quot;common&quot;, &quot;broad&quot; or &quot;northern&quot;; a local pronunciation of Milnrow is &quot;Milnra&quot;. One of the most common surnames is Butterworth, which is native to the Milnrow area. In 2016, a study in to life expectancy in Greater Manchester showed Milnrow to have one of the highest rates of longevity – second only to Whitefield – with the average woman living 82 years, and the average man for 75. Robert Brearley was an early centenarian from Milnrow, who lived past his 103rd birthday between the years 1787 and 1889.

According to the Office for National Statistics, at the time of the United Kingdom Census 2011, Milnrow (urban-core and sub-area) had a total resident population of 13,061. This was up from the following figures recorded in 2001: 11,561 for the electoral ward of Milnrow (which has different boundaries), 12,541 at the 2001 census, and 12,800 from the &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Geographical Dictionary&quot;.

Data from 2001 shows that of the residents in the electoral ward of Milnrow, which includes Newhey and the Piethorne Valley, 40.8% were married, 10.3% were cohabiting couples, and 9.5% were lone parent families. Twenty-seven per cent of households were made up of individuals, and 13% had someone living alone at pensionable age. The economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 45% in full-time employment, 12% in part-time employment, 7.7% self-employed, 2.6% unemployed, 2.1% students with jobs, 3.1% students without jobs, 13% retired, 4.6% looking after home or family, 7.4% permanently sick or disabled, and 2.3% economically inactive for other reasons. This was roughly in line with the national figures. In 2019, Milnrow East &amp; Newhey was estimated as having one of the highest prevalence of depression in England.

The place of birth of the town&#x27;s residents recorded in the 2001 census was 97% United Kingdom (including 95.04% from England), 0.6% Republic of Ireland, 0.5% from other European Union countries, and 2.6% from elsewhere in the world. The ethnicity of the community was classified as 98% white, 0.7% mixed race, 0.8% Asian, 0.2% black and 0.3% Chinese or other. In 2008, researchers with the University of Manchester noted Milnrow was a predominantly &quot;White area&quot;, contrasted with areas within both the metropolitan boroughs of Rochdale and Oldham where large South Asian and British Asian communities were recorded.

Declared religion from 2001 was recorded as 80% Christian, 0.8% Muslim, 0.1% Hindu, 0.1% Buddhist, and 0.1% Jewish. Some 12.2% were recorded as having no religion, 0.2% had an alternative religion, and 6.1% did not state their religion. Historically, in addition to the established church, branches of Nonconformist Protestantism – particularly 18th-century Wesleyanism – were forms of Christian theology practised in Milnrow. In 1717, Francis Gastrell, the then Bishop of Chester, noted there were &quot;a few [...] avowed Presbyterians&quot; in Milnrow. In 1773, Baptists established a chapel at Ogden; the building closed in 1964 with the congregation moving to a new building in Newhey in 1972, but retaining the name Ogden Baptist Church. The Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s Connexion established a school in Milnrow in 1840, and St Stephen&#x27;s Church building in 1861, attracting clergy and worshippers with leanings to Methodism and Calvinism; the congregation severed ties with the Connexion in 1865, and chose to join the Congregational Union.

==Economy==

Prior to deindustrialisation in the late-20th century, Milnrow&#x27;s economy was linked closely with a spinning and weaving tradition which had origins with domestic workshops but evolved in parallel with developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. Industries ancillary to textile production were present in the 19th century, such as coal mining at Tunshill, metalworking at Butterworth Hall, and brickmaking at Newhey. Newhey Brick &amp; Terracotta Works opened in 1899, while Butterworth Hall Colliery was the largest colliery in the Rochdale region, employing around 300 men in 1912. It was sunk as a commercial venture in 1861, opened fully in 1865, and was acquired by the Platt Brothers in 1881, continuing in their ownership until closure in 1928. Modern sectors in the area include engineering, packaging materials, the dyeing and finishing of textiles and carpets, and ink production. Milnrow constitutes a district centre, and Dale Street, its main thoroughfare, forms a linear commercial area with convenience stores, restaurants and food outlets, and a mix of independent shops and services including hairdressing and legal services. An Aldi supermarket was opened in 2016 by Bianca Walkden, while The Milnrow Balti won the 2019 &quot;Curry Life&quot; award for Best Restaurant in Greater Manchester. There are smaller, lower-order shops in Newhey. Animal husbandry, grazing and other farming practices occur on pastures at Milnrow&#x27;s rural fringe.

The biggest employers in Milnrow are Holroyd Machine Tools, part of Precision Technologies Group who have been based in the town since they moved from Manchester in 1896. In the early-20th century they operated a foundry in Whitehall Street and employed engineers and apprentices. In 2006 Holroyd had a workforce of 160, and its parent company Renold PLC employed a further 200 people at a base in there. Since 2010 Holroyd has been owned by the Chongqing-based CQME group. Holroyd at Milnrow was visited by Nick Clegg in his capacity as Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in April 2011. Global industrial and consumer packaging company Sonoco operate a warehouse in the town. Over half-a-million units of local delicacy Rag Pudding are mass-produced by Jackson&#x27;s Farm Fayre in their Milnrow factory. In Newhey, Sun Chemical produce printer inks and supplies, and Newhey Carpets design and produce carpets from a former Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway warehouse. At Ogden, textiles are dyed and finished by PW Greenhalgh.

Kingsway Business Park will be a &quot;business-focused, mixed use development&quot; occupying land between Milnrow and Rochdale, adjacent to junction 21 of the M62 motorway; it is expected to employ 7,250 people directly and 1,750 people indirectly by around 2020. Tenants on the park in 2011 included JD Sports and Wincanton plc. Kingsway Business Park tram stop was built as part of Phase 3a of Metrolink&#x27;s expansion, and serves Kingsway Business Park.

==Landmarks==
Milnrow&#x27;s historic architecture is chiefly marked by its 18th-century sandstone weavers&#x27; cottages, three-storey &quot;fine stone domestic workshops&quot; with mullioned windows. Also known as loomshops or loomhouses, it was estimated in 1982 that Milnrow likely had the greatest concentration of surviving weavers cottages in North West England. A conservation area was created in Ogden in 1974 to protect a range of stables, farm houses and former schoolhouse. Two conservation areas were created in 2006 at Butterworth Hall, covering domestic and municipal buildings respectively in central Milnrow. Former family seats and manor houses – of mostly medieval origin – in the area have included Belfield Hall, Butterworth Hall, Clegg Hall, and Schofield Hall. Belfield Hall, at Milnrow&#x27;s western boundary with Rochdale, was occupied by a variety of dignitaries, including two High Sheriffs of Lancashire — Alexander Butterworth and Richard Townley. Clegg Hall, at Milnrow&#x27;s northern boundary with Littleborough, is an early-17th century country house with Grade II* listed building status.

The Grade II listed Church of St James, Milnrow&#x27;s Anglican parish church, was built in 1869 and is dedicated to James the Apostle. It is part of the Church of England and lies within the Anglican Diocese of Manchester. The origins of the church can be traced to a chantry or oratory built by the Byrons in the year 1400. When that ruling family moved from Milnrow to another of their homes following the Wars of the Roses, the local population was left without a place of worship and a chapel was constructed by the River Beal in 1496 to serve this community. This structure existed until the 1790s, when a &quot;poorly designed&quot; chapel was erected and consecrated; however, due to structural weaknesses, that church was demolished in 1814. Following an interim period when a &quot;plain building&quot; was used for worship, the present church building was built and consecrated by James Fraser, the Bishop of Manchester, on 21 August 1869. Inside, the capitals have foliage decoration sculpted by the &quot;foremost Victorian stonemason&quot; Thomas Earp.

Described as &quot;by far the most distinctive and splendid building in the district&quot;, the neo-Gothic Newhey, St Thomas parish church was built in 1876 and served a new Anglican parish of Newhey created in the same year. Dedicated to Thomas the Apostle, it is part of the Church of England, and its patron is the Bishop of Manchester. The church was extensively damaged in an arson attack on 21 December 2007, but later restored in full.

Milnrow War Memorial is located in Milnrow Memorial Park at Newhey, and is a Grade II listed structure. The war memorial was originally sited in central Milnrow, set back from the road near Milnrow Bridge, and was unveiled on 3 August 1924 by Major General Arthur Solly-Flood, a former commander of 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. The memorial is constructed of sandstone surmounted by a bronze statue of a First World War infantryman with rifle and fixed bayonet symbolic of the young manhood of the district in the early days of the First World War. In selecting the design the Milnrow War Memorial Committee was influenced by the statue unveiled at Waterhead in Oldham; the work of George Thomas. Thomas sculpted Milnrow&#x27;s memorial in 1923. The plinth holds bronze and slate panels recording the names of those who died in the two World Wars.

In Newhey is the Ellenroad Steam Museum, the retained engine house, boiler house, chimney and steam engine of Ellenroad Mill, a former 1892-built cotton mill designed by Sir Philip Stott, 1st Baronet. Now operated as an industrial heritage centre, the mill itself is no longer standing, but the steam engine (the world&#x27;s largest working steam mill engine) is maintained and steamed once a month by the Ellenroad Trust. The museum has the only fully working cotton mill engine with its original steam-raising plant in the world. Ellenroad Mill produced fine cotton yarn using mule spinning. A 1907-built, working tandem compound condensing engine, made by J. &amp; W. McNaught for Firgrove Mill in Milnrow, is displayed in the Science and Industry Museum in central Manchester.

==Transport==

Public transport in Milnrow is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester, and services include bus and light rail transport. Major A roads link Milnrow with other settlements – the A640 road, which forms a route from Newhey and over the Pennines into Huddersfield and West Yorkshire, was established by a turnpike trust in 1805. Another A road is the Elizabethan Way bypass, which was opened around 1971 to coincide with the opening of Junction 21 of the trans-Pennine M62 motorway. Construction of the Milnrow part of the M62 began in April 1967, a process which spread mud and dirt throughout the town, and the relocation of inhabitants due to the demolition of homes. The official opening of the motorway on 13 October 1971 was by Queen Elizabeth II, who was welcomed by Ralph Assheton, 1st Baron Clitheroe in his role as Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire, as well as the chairman of Milnrow Urban District Council and his wife. Once opened, the Queen cast aside protocol for an informal meeting with the people of Milnrow. A Highways England motorway compound is located in Milnrow.

Milnrow had a first-generation electric passenger tramway in operation between 1909 and 1932. It was part of the broader Rochdale Corporation Tramways network, with a single route which started initially from Firgrove in the west, and joining Newhey in the south when the line was completed in 1912. The tramway had a reputation for poor maintenance, and suffered from increasingly frequent derailments towards its closure. The modern extant Milnrow tram stop is part of the Metrolink light-rail system, on the Oldham and Rochdale Line, with services operating towards Rochdale or Manchester city centre every 12 minutes. It was previously a heavy railway station on the Oldham Loop Line which connected Manchester, Oldham and Rochdale. The station was constructed in 1862 by navvies drafted by contractors under the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. On 12 August 1863 the line was opened to commercial traffic, and 2 November 1863 to passenger trains. Milnrow railway station was originally staffed, and the line through it was dual-track; however this section was reduced to single-track in 1980. Milnrow railway station closed on 3 October 2009 to be converted for use with an expanded Metrolink network. The station reopened on 28 February 2013 as Milnrow tram stop; also opening at this time in the Milnrow area was Kingsway Business Park tram stop and Newhey tram stop.

The Rochdale Canal—one of the major navigable broad canals of Great Britain—passes along Milnrow&#x27;s north-western boundary which divides it from the village of Wardle and districts of Belfield and Castleton in Rochdale. The Rochdale Canal was historically used as a highway of commerce for the haulage of cotton, wool, and coal to and from the area.

Bus service 182 operates to Rochdale, Newhey, Oldham, and Manchester, while services R4 and R5 serve Rochdale and the estates of Milnrow and Newhey, operated by First Greater Manchester and Burnley Bus Company.

==Education==

The Free School of Milnrow was founded in 1726 and was demolished in the early-1950s. From 1739 until his death in 1786 the schoolmaster was the caricaturist John Collier. In the mid-19th century it was part of the British and Foreign School Society. Newhey Council School was constructed in 1911, and now forms Newhey Community Primary School. By 1918 there were five public elementary schools; the Milnrow and Newhey council schools; St James&#x27;s of Milnrow and St Thomas&#x27; of Newhey Anglican schools; and Ogden church school. Milnrow St James School evolved into the modern primary school, Milnrow Parish Church of England Primary. It is a denominational school with the Church of England, linked with Milnrow&#x27;s Anglican parish church, St James&#x27;s. There are further primary schools named Crossgates Primary and Moorhouse Primary, both of which are non-denominational. Crossgates Primary School won the British Council&#x27;s International School Award in 2010 for its teaching of culture and global citizenship. Hollingworth Academy is a secondary school in Milnrow with Academy school status. It occupies the site of the former Roch Valley County Secondary School, which opened in 1968 and closed in 1990. It is a co-educational school of non-denominational religion.

==Sports and culture==
Milnrow has a &quot;distinct and separate character&quot;. It is one of the towns of northern England that observed the custom of Rushbearing, an annual Anglican religious festival where rushes are brought by rushcart to by strewn in the parish church to refresh the flooring. Milnrow&#x27;s Rushbearing occurred on the Sunday prior to St James&#x27;s Day, and in 1717, Francis Gastrell, the Bishop of Chester, wrote that Milnrow&#x27;s festival was a particularly &quot;disorderly custom&quot;. Parishioners would travel as far as Marsden to gather rushes. Established in 1968, Milnrow and Newhey Carnival is an annual summer community parade with floats, morris dancers and brass bands. The Milnrow Band is a British brass band ranked as a &quot;top class group of amateur musicians&quot;. It formed from a succession of mergers and amalgamations of Milnrow- and Rochdale-based brass bands, the earliest of which was St Stephen&#x27;s Band founded in Milnrow in 1869. In 2006 it was promoted to the top-rank Championship section of Great Britain, and in 2017 were the All England Masters International Champions. In his 2015 memoir, the Manchester-born comedy-singer Mike Harding recalled &quot;a place called Milnrow, on the extreme edge of the then known world, [...where...] everything stopped for pie and peas&quot;.

Milnrow Cricket Club is based at Ladyhouse in Milnrow, and has played in the Central Lancashire Cricket League since its foundation in 1892. The club formed in 1857 from a group of local businessmen who felt the district deserved its own distinct team. Originally, members of the club were recruited and teams were selected to play other clubs in the surrounding townships. Later players have included Cec Abrahams, who joined the club in 1961, having previously played for the South Africa national cricket team. Used for casual, amateur and organised leagues and tournaments, The Soccer Village in Milnrow consists of four indoor pitches in an arena with grandstand spectator seating for 300. There has been a golf course at Tunshill since 1901. It is affiliated with the English Golf Union. Land in Firgrove was gifted to Milnrow Council in November 1934 for use as a sports pitch, establishing the Firgrove Playing Fields. They are used for rugby league, rounders and association football, and are the home of Rochdale Cobras ARLFC, a club which won the British Amateur Rugby League Association &quot;Club of the Year&quot; award in 2011. New Milnrow and Newhey Rugby League Club is a further local rugby league club.

Milnrow Memorial Park includes a multi-purpose asphalt football/basketball court, a bowling green, children&#x27;s play park and a concrete skatepark.

==Public utilities==
Milnrow was identified as a suitable source of drinking water on an industrial scale in the Victorian era, when the Oldham Corporation obtained rights to dam the Piethorne Brook. Excavations began in 1858, and concluded in 1863 with the opening of the Piethorne Reservoir. By 1869, the Oldham Corporation acknowledged there was &quot;an absolute necessity for an extra water supply&quot;, and further reservoirs were created using English compulsory purchase powers granted to the Corporation by virtue of the Oldham Improvement Act 1880. In 1918, the Oldham Corporation was still one of the largest landowners in Milnrow. United Utilities now operate the reservoir.

In 1950, the General Post Office was contracted to construct a new-generation British Telecom microwave network, transmitting BBC television across Great Britain. By 1951, a transmitter station had been built on Milnrow&#x27;s outlying Windy Hill, carrying signals broadcast from Manchester to Tinshill and then on to Kirk o&#x27;Shotts transmitting station. Initially overlooked for a site in Saddleworth, in the late-1950s, Windy Hill transmitter station became part of Britain&#x27;s &quot;backbone network&quot;, a series of telecommunications towers in the United Kingdom designed to maintain communications in the event of a Cold War-era nuclear attack. The station forms a landmark on the landscape, adjacent to the Pennine Way long-distance footpath and M62 motorway.

Waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority. Milnrow&#x27;s distribution network operator for electricity is United Utilities; there are no power stations in the area, but a Wind farm exists on Scout Moor which consists of 26 turbines on the high moors between Rawtenstall and Rochdale, generating 65MW of electricity.

Home Office policing in Milnrow is provided by the Greater Manchester Police. The force&#x27;s &quot;(P) Division&quot; have their headquarters for policing the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale in Rochdale and the nearest police station is at Littleborough to the north. Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, which has one station in Rochdale on Halifax Road.

There are no hospitals in Milnrow—the nearest are in Oldham and Rochdale; the Royal Oldham Hospital and Rochdale Infirmary are managed by the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, a part of the Northern Care Alliance NHS Group. The North West Ambulance Service provides emergency patient transport. Primary care and general practice occurs at Stonefield Street Surgery. The Milnrow Village Practice was surveyed as the 2nd best general practice in Greater Manchester for patient experience in both 2018 and 2019.

==Notable people==
John Collier (who wrote under the pseudonym of Tim Bobbin) was an acclaimed 18th-century caricaturist and satirical poet who was raised and spent all his adult life in Milnrow. Born in Urmston in 1708, Collier was schoolmaster for Milnrow. Inspired by William Hogarth, Collier was admired by Sir Walter Scott, and called a &quot;man of original genius&quot; by Edward Baines. His work savagely lampooned the behaviour of upper and lower classes alike, and was written in a strong Lancashire dialect. Many of his works and personal possessions are preserved in Milnrow Library, and he is commemorated in the name of a &quot;prominent pub&quot; in central Milnrow. Collier&#x27;s great-grandson—also called John and a native of Milnrow—was one of the founding members of the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers.

Francis Robert Raines (1805–1878) was the Anglican vicar of Milnrow, and an antiquary who contributed to the Chetham Society publications. He was ordained in 1828 and, after short appointments at Saddleworth and Rochdale, he was vicar at Milnrow for the rest of his life. John Milne was a professor, geologist and mining engineer who invented a pioneering seismograph (known as the Milne-Shaw seismograph) to detect and measure earthquakes. Although born in Liverpool in 1850 owing to a brief visit there by his parents, Milne was raised in Rochdale and at Tunshill in Milnrow.

Other notable people of Milnrow include Cec Abrahams, a South African-born international cricketer, who settled in the town during the 1960s and played for the local cricket club, Chris Dunphy, the Milnrow-born chairman of Rochdale A.F.C., and Lizzy Bardsley, who, in 2003, gained fame from appearing on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Wife Swap&quot;. Stuart Bithell, who won a Silver Medal in the Men&#x27;s 470 class at the 2012 Summer Olympics, was raised in Newhey, and Martin Stapleton, a mixed martial artist who was the 2015 BAMMA World Lightweight Champion resided in Milnrow as of 2019.

<text>Thomas Erastus (original surname Lüber, Lieber, or Liebler; 7 September 152431 December 1583) was a Swiss physician and Calvinist theologian. He wrote 100 theses (later reduced to 75) in which he argued that the sins committed by Christians should be punished by the State, and that the Church should not withhold sacraments as a form of punishment. They were published in 1589, after his death, with the title . His name was later applied to Erastianism.

==Biography==
He was born of poor parents on 7 September 1524, probably at Baden, canton of Aargau, Switzerland. In 1540 he was studying theology at the University of Basel. The plague of 1544 drove him to the University of Bologna and from there to the University of Padua as student of philosophy and medicine. In 1553 he became physician to the count of Henneberg, Saxe-Meiningen, and in 1558 held the same post with the elector-palatine, Otto Heinrich, being at the same time professor of medicine and pharmacology at the University of Heidelberg until 1580; Anselmus Boetius de Boodt was one of his students. His patron&#x27;s successor, Frederick III, made him a privy Councillor and member of the church consistory in 1559.

In theology he followed Huldrych Zwingli, and at the sacramentarian conferences of Heidelberg (1560) and Maulbronn (1564) he advocated by voice and pen the Zwinglian doctrine of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, replying in 1565 to the counter-arguments of the Lutheran Johann Marbach, of Strasbourg. He ineffectually resisted the efforts of the Calvinists, led by Caspar Olevian, to introduce the Presbyterian polity and discipline, which were established at Heidelberg in 1570, on the Geneva model.

One of the first acts of the new church system was to excommunicate Erastus on a charge of Socinianism, founded on his correspondence with Transylvania. The ban was not removed until 1575, Erastus declaring his firm adhesion to the doctrine of the Trinity. His position, however, was uncomfortable, and in 1580 he returned to the University of Basel, where in 1583 he was made professor of ethics. He died on 31 December 1583.

==Work==
Erastus published several pieces focused on medicine, astrology, alchemy, and attacked in his publications the system of Paracelsus. In doing so, he defended medieval tradition in general, and Galen in particular, while conceding some merit to specific points in Paracelsus. His name is permanently associated with a posthumous publication, written in 1568. Its immediate occasion was the disputation at Heidelberg in 1568 for the doctorate of theology by George Withers, an English Puritan (subsequently Archdeacon of Colchester), silenced in 1565 at Bury St Edmunds by Archbishop Parker. Withers had proposed a disputation against vestments, which the university would not allow; his thesis affirming the excommunicating power of the presbytery was sustained.

The &quot;Treatise of Erastus&quot; (1589) was published by Giacomo Castelvetro, who had married Erastus&#x27;s widow. It consists of seventy-five &quot;Theses&quot;, followed by a in six books. An appendix of letters to Erastus by Heinrich Bullinger and Rudolf Gwalther, showed that the &quot;Theses&quot;, written in 1568, had been circulated in manuscript form. An English translation of the &quot;Theses&quot;, with a brief account of the life of Erastus (based on Melchior Adam&#x27;s account), was issued in 1659, entitled &quot;The Nullity of Church Censures;&quot; it was reprinted as &quot;A Treatise of Excommunication&quot; (1682) and was revised by Robert Lee, D.D., in 1844.

===Erastianism===
In his &quot;Theses&quot;, he argued that the sins committed by Christians should be punished by the State, and that the Church should not withhold sacraments as a form of punishment. This view is now known as Erastianism. Those holding this view in the Westminster Assembly included John Selden, John Lightfoot, Thomas Coleman and Bulstrode Whitelocke, whose speech in 1645 is appended to Lee&#x27;s version of the &quot;Theses&quot;. However, after much controversy, the opposite view was carried, with Lightfoot alone dissenting. The consequent chapter of the &quot;Westminster Confession of Faith&quot; (&quot;Of Church Censures&quot;) was not ratified by the English parliament.

According to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;The &quot;Theses&quot; and appeared together in 1589. The central question about which the &quot;Theses&quot; turned was that of excommunication. The term is not, however, used by Erastus in the Catholic sense as excluding the delinquent from the society or membership of the Church. The excommunication to which [it] alludes was the exclusion of those of bad life from participation in the sacraments.&quot;

<text>The Times Square–42nd Street station is a major New York City Subway station complex located under Times Square, at the intersection of 42nd Street, Seventh Avenue, and Broadway, in Midtown Manhattan. The complex allows free transfers between the IRT 42nd Street Shuttle, the BMT Broadway Line, the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and the IRT Flushing Line, as well as to the IND Eighth Avenue Line a block west at . The complex is served by the 1, 2, 3, 7, N and Q trains at all times, the W train during weekdays; the R and 42nd Street Shuttle (S) trains at all times except late nights; and &lt;7&gt; trains during rush hours in the peak direction. A free passageway from the shuttle platform to the station, served by the , is open during the day from 6 a.m. to 12 a.m.

The present shuttle platforms were built for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) as a local station on the city&#x27;s first subway line, which was approved in 1900. The station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway. As part of the Dual Contracts between the IRT and the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line platforms opened in 1917, followed by the Broadway Line platforms in 1918 and the Flushing Line platforms in 1928. The original platforms were also reconfigured to serve the shuttle. The complex has been reconstructed numerous times over the years. The free transfer between the IRT and BMT opened in 1948, while the transfer to the IND station was placed within fare control in 1988. The complex was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. In the early 21st century, the shuttle station was reconfigured.

Excluding closed platforms, the Flushing Line and shuttle stations have one island platform and two tracks, while the Broadway Line and Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line have two island platforms and four tracks. All platforms and most of the station complex is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, except for the IND passageway, which has steep ramps at both ends. The Times Square–42nd Street complex, including the Eighth Avenue Line, is the busiest station complex in the system, serving 65,020,294 passengers in 2019.

== History ==

The IRT platforms have been connected to each other as a transfer station as the lines opened: first between the 42nd Street Shuttle and the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line in 1917, then the transfer was incorporated with the Flushing Line in 1927. On December 24, 1932, a passageway was opened, connecting the IND Eighth Avenue Line&#x27;s 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal station and the IRT platforms, with a new entrance at West 41st Street between Seventh Avenue and Eighth Avenue. The passageway was located outside a fare control, and passengers had to pay an extra fare to transfer between the IND and the IRT station. The free transfer between the IRT and BMT was added on July 1, 1948. The block-long passageway that runs west to the 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal station was reopened within fare control on December 11, 1988.

=== First subway ===

Planning for a subway line in New York City dates to 1864. Development of what would become the city&#x27;s first subway line started in 1894, when the New York State Legislature passed the Rapid Transit Act. The subway plans were drawn up by a team of engineers led by William Barclay Parsons, the Rapid Transit Commission&#x27;s chief engineer. It called for a subway line from New York City Hall in lower Manhattan to the Upper West Side, where two branches would lead north into the Bronx. A plan was formally adopted in 1897, which called for the subway to run under several streets in lower Manhattan before running under Fourth Avenue, 42nd Street, and Broadway. A previous proposal had called for the entire length of the subway to use Broadway, but the &quot;awkward alignment...along Forty-Second Street&quot;, as the commission put it, was necessitated by objections to using the southernmost section of Broadway. Legal challenges were resolved near the end of 1899. The Rapid Transit Construction Company, organized by John B. McDonald and funded by August Belmont Jr., signed the initial Contract 1 with the Rapid Transit Commission in February 1900, in which it would construct the subway and maintain a 50-year operating lease from the opening of the line. In 1901, the firm of Heins &amp; LaFarge was hired to design the underground stations. Belmont incorporated the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) in April 1902 to operate the subway.

The present shuttle station at Times Square–42nd Street was constructed as part of the route segment underneath 42nd Street and Times Square, which extended from Park Avenue and 41st Street to Broadway and 47th Street. Construction on this section of the line began on February 25, 1901. Work for that section had been awarded to Degnon-McLean. By late 1903, the subway was nearly complete, but the IRT Powerhouse and the system&#x27;s electrical substations were still under construction, delaying the system&#x27;s opening. After the New York City Board of Aldermen renamed Longacre Square to Times Square, in April 1904, the Rapid Transit Commission agreed to rename the subway station at Broadway and 42nd Street as the &quot;Times Station&quot;. As late as October 26, 1904, the day before the subway was scheduled to open, the walls and ceilings were incomplete.

The Times Square station opened on October 27, 1904, as one of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch. Prior to the subway station&#x27;s opening, Times Square had been renamed from Long Acre Square to give the station a distinctive name. Within three years of the line&#x27;s opening, the Times Square station was the city&#x27;s third-busiest subway station, and its busiest local station, with 30,000 daily riders. After the first subway line was completed in 1908, the station was served by local trains along both the West Side (now the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line to Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street) and East Side (now the Lenox Avenue Line). West Side local trains had their southern terminus at City Hall during rush hours and South Ferry at other times, and had their northern terminus at 242nd Street. East Side local trains ran from City Hall to Lenox Avenue (145th Street).

=== Expansion ===
To address overcrowding, in 1909, the New York Public Service Commission (PSC) proposed lengthening the platforms at stations along the original IRT subway. As part of a modification to the IRT&#x27;s construction contracts made on January 18, 1910, the company was to lengthen station platforms to accommodate ten-car express and six-car local trains. In addition to $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) spent on platform lengthening, $500,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) was spent on building additional entrances and exits. It was anticipated that these improvements would increase capacity by 25 percent. Platforms at local stations, such as the Times Square station, were lengthened by between . The northbound platform was extended to the north and south, while the southbound platform was lengthened to the south, necessitating a reconfiguration of the Knickerbocker Hotel entrance.

==== Dual Contracts ====
The Dual Contracts were formalized in March 1913, specifying new lines or expansions to be built by the IRT and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT). As part of the Dual Contracts, the Public Service Commission planned to split the original IRT system into three segments: two north–south lines, carrying through trains over the Lexington Avenue and Broadway–Seventh Avenue Lines, and an east–west shuttle under 42nd Street. This would form a roughly H-shaped system. The original alignment under 42nd Street would become a shuttle service, and a new set of platforms would be built for the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.

===== IRT &quot;H&quot; system =====
In December 1913, the PSC began soliciting bids for the construction of the Seventh Avenue Line tunnel between 42nd and 30th Streets, including two express stations at 34th and 42nd Streets. The new IRT line was to cross the original subway tunnel at a flat junction near 45th Street, necessitating that the new station be placed between 40th and 42nd Streets. The PSC awarded a $2.2 million contract to an IRT subsidiary, and the Board of Estimate approved the contract the next month.

The next contract to be awarded was for the section between 42nd and 44th Streets. The Oscar Daniels Company submitted a low bid for the construction of that section, Despite protests from IRT officials, who said their bid was more expensive because it included additional safety measures, the commission refused to re-award the contract to the IRT. The construction of the new junction included rebuilding the roof, moving pillars, and demolishing part of the original subway tunnel&#x27;s wall. The new tunnel had been excavated northward to the existing IRT line by June 1915, and workers were laying tracks for the new tunnel by 1916.

The Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line station opened on June 3, 1917, as part of an extension of the IRT to South Ferry. A shuttle service ran between Times Square and Penn Station until the rest of the extension opened a year later on July 1, 1918. Afterward, the shuttle ran from Times Square to South Ferry. On August 1, the Dual Contracts&#x27; &quot;H system&quot; was put into service, and the former main line platforms became part of the 42nd Street Shuttle. Initially, a temporary wooden platform was placed over track 2 of the original subway, and black bands were painted on the walls to guide passengers to the shuttle platforms.

The Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line station was the site of a 1928 wreck that killed 16 people, the second worst in New York City history (the worst being the Malbone Street Wreck in Brooklyn, which killed at least 93).

===== BRT platforms =====
Also planned under the Dual Contracts was the Broadway Line of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; after 1923, the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation or BMT). The Broadway Line station was planned as a local station, with the express station to be located between 47th and 49th Streets. Opponents of the plan said it would cause large amounts of confusion, as Times Square was a &quot;natural&quot; transfer point. In February 1914, the PSC ordered the BRT to make the Broadway Line&#x27;s 42nd Street station an express station. The change was made at the insistence of Brooklynites who wanted an express station in the Theater District of Manhattan.

The BRT station was to have two small mezzanines above the platforms, one each at 40th and 42nd Streets, but local civic group Broadway Association advocated for a connection between the two mezzanines. The PSC approved the construction of a large concourse above the BRT station in 1917. The concourse would only have cost an extra $1,400, but the station&#x27;s general contractor refused to build the concourse because of a dispute over the price of cast-iron columns. A. W. King was hired to install finishes in the Times Square station in July 1917. The Broadway Line station opened on January 5, 1918, as the northern terminal of a shuttle service running south to Rector Street. Through service began operating in July 1919 when the line was extended northward.

===== Flushing Line =====
The Dual Contracts also included completing and opening the Steinway Tunnel as part of the new Flushing subway line. The tunnel, running under the East River with trolley loops on both the Manhattan and Queens sides, had sat unused since 1907, when test runs had been performed in the then-nearly-complete tunnel. The route, traveling under 41st and 42nd Streets in Manhattan, was to go from Times Square through the tunnel over to Long Island City and from there continue toward Flushing. The section of the tunnel between Grand Central–42nd Street and Queens had opened on June 22, 1915.

In July 1920, the PSC announced it would extend the Flushing Line two stops west to Times Square, with an intermediate station under Bryant Park. On November 9, 1921, the New York State Transit Commission opened up the contract for the extension for bidding. The extension would take a slightly different route than the one specified in the Dual Contracts. The original proposal had the line constructed under 42nd Street to a point just to the east of Broadway, which would have forced riders transferring to the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line to walk a long distance.

The Times Square station would be designed at a lower level than the two existing stations at Times Square. It would have two upper mezzanines connected by passageways: a mezzanine east of Seventh Avenue extending to Broadway, and one west of Seventh Avenue. Escalators would connect these upper mezzanines with the lower mezzanine, and a provision would be made to permit the installation of an escalator to the east of Seventh Avenue. There would be two entrances at street level at each of the western corners of 41st Street and Broadway, and two entrances at the northeastern corner of 41st Street and Seventh Avenue. The project was expected to reduce crowding on the 42nd Street Shuttle by enabling riders to use the Queensboro Subway to directly access Times Square. 24,000 of the estimated 100,000 daily shuttle riders transferred to and from the Queensboro Subway. The line was to extend as far as Eighth Avenue to connect with the proposed IND Eighth Avenue Line.

On November 22, 1921, the Powers-Kennedy Contracting Corporation was awarded a contract to construct the extension on a low bid of $3,867,138, below the estimated cost of over $4 million. This low bid was the narrowest margin ever recorded for any large city contract, beating out the next highest bidder by 0.7 percent. While the contractor was provided four years to complete work, engineers expected to reduce the time needed to do so to as little as three years. Since work on the project had to be completed underneath the foundations of several large buildings, such as theatres, and the north end of the New York Public Library, the contractor had to provide a $1 million bond. Powers-Kennedy started excavating the line westward from Grand Central in May 1922. The Flushing Line extension was to run beneath the original line from Vanderbilt to Fifth Avenue. The contractors had completed the tunnels to Fifth Avenue by May 1923, and the Fifth Avenue station opened on March 22, 1926, as the temporary western terminus of the line. In fall 1926, it was announced that the line would be completed by January 1, 1927.

In June 1926, the Ascher Company was awarded a contract to complete the Flushing Line&#x27;s Times Square station. On February 8, 1927, the New York City Board of Transportation informed the New York State Transit Commission that work on the Times Square station was sufficiently completed to enable the start of train service beginning on February 19, 1927, with the completion of work to a point between Eighth Avenue and Seventh Avenue. Plans for the construction of an extension of the line to between Eighth Avenue and Ninth Avenue to provide a physical connection with the IND Eighth Avenue Line were underway. On March 1, 1927, the opening of the line was set for March 15, the third time an opening date was set for the line. Work had been postponed given the amount of work that remained to be completed. The opening of the line was about a year behind the April 29, 1926, date specified in the contract. The delay was the result of surprisingly difficult construction. The Board of Transportation had withheld retained percentages, as allowed in the contract, penalizing the contractor, and trying to incentivize it to speed up work. No retained percentages were provided to the contractor until February 1927. The Flushing Line was extended to Times Square on March 14, 1927.

A pedestrian passageway under 41st Street, connecting the Independent Subway System (IND)&#x27;s 42nd Street station with the IRT and BMT stations at Times Square, opened on December 24, 1932; the passageway included an entrance on 41st Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Passengers had to pay an additional fare to transfer to and from the IND.

=== Mid-20th century ===

==== 1930s to 1950s ====
In Fiscal Year 1937, the express-track side of the southbound Broadway–Seventh Avenue platform was extended to the south to provide ample space at the center door of ten-car trains. In addition, the IRT opened a new entrance to the northwestern corner of Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street through the Rialto Building, on the site of the Rialto Theatre.

The city government took over the BMT&#x27;s operations on June 1, 1940. At midnight, a ceremony commemorating the transfer, with five hundred people in attendance, was held at the Times Square station. The last BMT train had left the 57th Street station five minutes earlier. When the train arrived at Times Square, BMT president William S. Menden handed over his company&#x27;s properties to Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, who then gave them to New York City Board of Transportation chairman John H. Delaney. The city government then took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The Board of Transportation operated the New York City transit system until the creation of the New York City Transit Authority in 1953.

As part of a pilot program, the BOT installed three-dimensional advertisements at the Times Square station in late 1948. The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), the BOT&#x27;s successor, announced plans in 1956 to add fluorescent lights across the entire Times Square station complex.
The Flushing Line platforms at Times Square, as well as platforms at all other stations on the Flushing Line with the exception of Queensboro Plaza, were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. One of the complex&#x27;s entrances on 43rd Street was closed in 1957 to make way for a Times Square visitor center. This entrance was rebuilt next to the information center after numerous protests, and it reopened in July 1958.

==== 1960s to 1980s ====
A new entrance at the southwest corner of Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street opened in 1964, and a shopping arcade within the basement of the Rialto Building was closed in July 1967. The BMT station received a minor overhaul in the late 1970s when the MTA fixed the station&#x27;s structure and the overall appearance, and it repaired staircases and platform edges, removed pedestrian ramps, and replaced lighting.

By the 1970s, city officials planned to raise funds for a renovation of the Times Square station complex, using sales-tax revenue from materials used in the construction of the New York Marriott Marquis hotel. As part of a pilot program to reduce high crime in the New York City Subway system, in May 1981, the MTA spent $500,000 to install CCTV screens at the Columbus Circle subway station. The MTA expanded the experiment to the Times Square–42nd Street station in 1983. The cameras were deactivated in 1985 after further tests showed that their presence did not help reduce crime. The MTA considered transferring 220 CCTV cameras from these stations to token booths at the stations with the most crime. On August 1, 1988, the passageway between the IND Eighth Avenue Line station and the IRT/BMT complex was finally placed within fare control. The two previously-separate stations had the highest crime rates in the system at the time.

=== Late 20th and early 21st centuries ===
The Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC), an agency of the New York state government, had proposed redeveloping the area around a portion of West 42nd Street in 1981. As part of the redevelopment, in 1988, the state and NYCTA announced that they would spend $125 million on renovating the Times Square subway complex. The project would have included an underground rotunda with stores, connecting several office buildings; new subway entrances inside these buildings; and elevators. The project excluded renovation of the platforms or the passageway under 41st Street. Park Tower Realty, which had committed to developing four buildings in the redevelopment, would have paid for 60 percent of the project&#x27;s cost, while the New York City Transit Authority would have provided $45 million and the city would have provided $10 million. The project was canceled in August 1992 after Prudential Insurance and Park Tower Realty was given permission to postpone the construction of these buildings.

The station underwent total reconstruction in stages starting in 1994. Phase 1 rebuilt the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line platforms with a new mezzanine, stairs, and elevators, and was completed in 2002. Phase 2, finished in 2006, rebuilt the Broadway Line, Flushing Line, and Eighth Avenue Line portions of the station.

==== Phase 1 and 2 renovation ====
In 1995, the MTA announced it would build a main entrance on the south side of 42nd Street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway. The site of the new entrance was occupied at the time by an &quot;interim&quot; retail space. Originally, the MTA had proposed consolidating 11 separate entrances to the complex into one full-time main entrance and four part-time entrances. The new main entrance opened in July 1997. It features a bright neon and colored glass flashing sign with train route symbols and the word &quot;Subway&quot;, as well as an elevator and escalators.

In July 1998, the MTA started accepting bids for the renovation of the Times Square station. The first phase would include renovating the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line platforms, part of the Broadway Line platforms, and the mezzanine, while the second phase would cover the rest of the station. The goal was to reduce congestion and improve rider access, comfort and safety by improving visual lines and increasing pedestrian capacity. The main corridor would be widened and the number of sharp corners would be reduced. In addition, there would be new elevators to make the station compliant with the for Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, new escalators, and wider corridors and stairs. William Nicholas Bodouva &amp; Associates designed the materials for the renovation. Slattery Skanska, a firm owned by Slattery Associates and Skanska, received an $82.8 million contract for the station&#x27;s renovation in December 1998. Bovis Lend Lease and CTE Engineers served as construction managers for the first two phases of the project.

The renovation of the complex began when the entrances at the northwest and southwest corners of 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue were temporarily closed in May 1999. Phase 1 of the project cost $85 million and entailed expanding the main entrance on 42nd Street by ; making passageways as much as wider; and constructing new entrances in nearby office buildings. New entrances were added on the northwest and southwest corners of Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street. The southwest-corner entrance at 5 Times Square has both escalators and stairs. The northwest-corner entrance in 3 Times Square only has stairs because the MTA allowed the building&#x27;s developer Rudin Management to pay $1.3 million instead of adding two escalators.

The second phase cost $91 million. This phase included converting of storage rooms to offices; widening a mezzanine from ; razing a passageway that contained a &quot;mixing bowl&quot; of stairs and elevators; and refurbishing the passageway leading from the IND station to the rest of the complex. The cost of renovating the station had exceeded $257.3 million by 2004. The mezzanine above the BMT Broadway Line, which formerly housed a record shop named Record Mart, was renovated with a large oval balcony looking over the trackway. In 2004, four unisex stall bathrooms were opened on the mezzanine between the IRT and BMT lines; they are staffed and maintained by employees of the Times Square Alliance, the local Business Improvement District. Record Mart reopened in 2007 on the south side of the IRT/BMT corridor, and when it closed permanently in 2020, it had been Manhattan&#x27;s oldest operating record store.

==== Phase 3 renovation ====
During the third phase of the station&#x27;s renovation, the shuttle platform would have been relocated , and a new island platform for the shuttle would have been created. By 2004, the work was planned to be completed in 2006 at a cost of $85 million. Although planning had been completed in 2006, the project was delayed due to a lack of funding. As part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program, the MTA scheduled some improvements to make it accessible under the guidelines of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The 42nd Street Shuttle became ADA-accessible, the shuttle was reconfigured from three tracks to two tracks, and the trains became six cars long. A new platform, wide and located between tracks 1 and 4, was built along the section of the shuttle that runs under 42nd Street, which is located within a straight tunnel. The whole project was expected to cost $235.41 million. The Times Square shuttle platform was extended east to allow for a second point of entry at Sixth Avenue, with a connection to the IND Sixth Avenue Line, as well a second connection to the IRT Flushing Line via its Fifth Avenue station.
The entire Times Square station was rehabilitated with congestion mitigation measures. A wider stairway was installed from the shuttle mezzanine to street level, and a new control area was installed at the bottom of the stairway. The cost of this part of the project is $30 million. In conjunction, a second project added access to the Times Square complex. As part of the project, the eastern platform was closed to public access, and the exit to 43rd Street was closed, covered over, and turned into an emergency exit, starting on October 19, 2019. This entrance would be replaced by a new entrance with a wide stairway covered by a canopy. The staircase would lead from the shuttle mezzanine to street level, blocking portions of the station&#x27;s original finishes. A new control area would be installed at the bottom of the stairway. To further increase capacity, 21 columns were eliminated; other columns at the station were thinned, requiring the underpinning of roof beams; and 142 columns in the concourse area were relocated away from the car doors. The cost of this project was estimated to be $28.93 million.

The new control area provided an additional 5,000 square feet in mezzanine space, while the new entrance provided an additional 450 square feet of space. The entrance&#x27;s canopy has 238 triangular glass frames that replicate the crystals part of the New Year&#x27;s Eve Crystal Ball. Eighteen new CCTV cameras, ten new turnstiles, two emergency exit gates, and four new digital information screens were installed in the new control area. Two new mosaics by Nick Cave, titled &quot;Equal All&quot; and &quot;Each One&quot;, were installed as part of the project.

The northern section of the original west platform wall dating from 1904 was removed, and One Times Square&#x27;s owner Jamestown Properties built elevators connecting the station to the street. The wall was broken into sections and moved to the New York Transit Museum to mitigate the adverse effects of the station renovation. To further mitigate damage done to portions of the original station, certain features were repaired and restored, including the original southwest platform and control area wall finishes, the original cast iron columns, the ceiling plaster ornamentation, and the cast iron guard rails. In addition, the east platform walls that were located within back-of-house space were protected. The damaged Knickerbocker marble lintel located at the west platform control area were replicated. To reference portions of the original tracks located at tracks 2 and 3, the granite paving for the shuttle platform was modified with a veneer steel rail. These long sections are located on the new platform between tracks 1 and 4. Finally, a plaque describing the history of the station was installed underneath the replicated Knickerbocker lintel.

The construction contract for the project was originally scheduled to be awarded in June 2018. This was delayed by several months because of changes to the project schedule and cost. The construction duration was expected to be extended by three months, and the cost would increase by $25 million, because of additions to the original construction plan. A construction contract was awarded in March 2019, with an estimated completion date of March 2022. The shuttle was temporarily closed in mid-2020 for this work. The new platform opened on September 7, 2021, along with the passageway to the 42nd Street–Bryant Park station. This made the shuttle station ADA-accessible; though the passageway was not yet accessible, elevators were planned for its Bryant Park end. The new $40 million station entrance, including the new elevator, formally opened on May 16, 2022. The MTA spent $30 million to construct the new staircase entrance and Jamestown paid $10 million for the elevator.

==== Other modifications ====
In the late 2000s, the MTA began construction on an extension of the IRT Flushing Line to 34th Street, which would require demolishing the lower level of the 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal station. By January 2010, the lower level platform was being demolished as part of the Flushing Line extension, which slopes down through where the old lower level platform was. On September 13, 2015, the Flushing Line was extended one stop west from Times Square to 34th Street–Hudson Yards.

In February 2022, the MTA announced that the IRT Flushing Line platforms would receive platform screen doors as part of a pilot program. The announcement came after several people had been shoved onto tracks, including one incident that led to the death of Michelle Go on the BMT platform. The MTA started soliciting bids from platform-door manufacturers in mid-2022; the doors are planned to be installed starting in December 2023 at a cost of $6 million. Designs for the platform doors were being finalized by June 2023. As part of a pilot program, a Knightscope K5 robotic police officer was deployed at the station in September 2023; the NYPD had removed the robot by February 2024.

=== Bombings and terrorist plots ===
A bombing at the station on October 12, 1960, injured 33 passengers. In September 2009, Najibullah Zazi and alleged co-conspirators planned suicide bombings on subway trains near this station and the Grand Central–42nd Street station, but the plot was discovered before they could carry it out. There was also a bombing on December 11, 2017, during the morning rush hour, when a pipe bomb device partially detonated in the 41st Street passageway.

== Station layout ==

Times Square was named for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; headquarters, built by &quot;Times&quot; owner Adolph S. Ochs, housed the original subway station (now the shuttle platforms) in its basement.

Four separate stations comprise the Times Square complex, which is connected to the 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal station of the IND Eighth Avenue Line. The shallowest station is the 42nd Street Shuttle platform, which runs in a northwest–southeast direction under 42nd Street east of Broadway, and is below street level. The IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line station runs under Seventh Avenue. The BMT Broadway Line station runs in a true north–south alignment under Broadway. The deepest station, serving the IRT Flushing Line, is below street level and runs roughly west–east under 41st Street. The Times Square–42nd Street and 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal stations are both fully wheelchair-accessible. However, the ramp between the two parts of the complex is not wheelchair-accessible.

=== Mezzanines ===
There are several mezzanines throughout the complex, connected by several ramps and stairs. The primary, upper mezzanine is near the level of the shuttle platforms and consists of four passageways in a trapezoidal layout, arranged under 42nd Street, Broadway, 41st Street, and Seventh Avenue. An oval-shaped cut is on the Broadway side of the main mezzanine, below which are the northern ends of the BMT platforms. A pair of escalators to the Flushing Line is at the southwestern corner of this mezzanine. Some parts of the mezzanine have glass-tiled walls, while other parts are clad with white ceramic tile topped by mosaic bands. &quot;Music Under New York&quot; controls various spots within the mezzanine for performers.

Near the south end of the BMT platforms, there is a smaller mezzanine overhead, which leads to exits at 40th Street.

Under the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line platforms, but above the Flushing Line platforms, is a lower mezzanine level extending from west to east. This mezzanine connects to a steep ramp that leads to the passageway to the IND Eighth Avenue Line platforms. A 600-foot-long passageway under 41st Street connects the IND station with the rest of the complex. The passageway is located above the mezzanines at either end. It is stair-free but contains steep ramps at both ends, which are not ADA-compliant.

=== Exits ===
Exits to the 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal station, on Eighth Avenue between 40th and 44th Street, are signed as serving the A, C, E, and 7 trains. Several exits are signed as serving most or all of the services in the complex. There are two exits inside buildings on 42nd Street west of Seventh Avenue: the north side within 3 Times Square and the south side within 5 Times Square. On the south side of 42nd Street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway, there is an elevator and escalator bank inside the Times Square Tower. The street level fare control at this site features restored original &quot;Times Square&quot; mosaics from the Contract I station walls (now used by the shuttle). One street stair rises to the southeast corner of Broadway and 42nd Street. A block to the south, one stair goes into a building at the northwest corner of 41st Street and Seventh Avenue, and two street stairs go to the southeast corner. An exit-only stair rises to the southwest corner of 41st Street and Broadway.

Two sets of exits on 40th Street are separate from the main mezzanine areas and are signed as only serving certain services. At 40th Street and Seventh Avenue, one stair goes into a building at the southwest corner, and one street stair goes to the southeast corner. These serve a mezzanine above the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line platforms and are signed as serving the 1, 2, 3, 7, and S trains. One street stair rises to each of the corners of 40th Street and Broadway, serving the southern mezzanine above the Broadway Line platforms. Those entrances are signed as serving the N, Q, R, W, and S trains.

There are several closed exits throughout the station complex. Until 1981, there was a stair to the southeastern corner of 41st Street and 8th Avenue. Another stair rose to the south side of 41st Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues in the passageway between the Eighth Avenue Line station and the rest of the station complex, and was closed in 1989 due to very low usage. A street stair to the northeastern corner of 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue, by One Times Square, was closed around 1998–2000. Two stairs to the northeastern corner of 41st Street and Seventh Avenue were closed during the same time, as were stairs to both western corners of that intersection. In 2019, a stair to the southwestern corner of 43rd Street and Broadway was closed as part of the shuttle modernization project. Many of the station&#x27;s entrances were historically constructed within other buildings.

== IRT 42nd Street Shuttle platform ==
The Times Square station on the 42nd Street Shuttle consists of an island platform between tracks 1 and 4, which was completed in 2021. It is wide and is long, with a slight northward curve at the western end. At the east end of the platform is a passageway to the 42nd Street–Bryant Park station, running between tracks 1 and 4. The 42nd Street Shuttle serves the station at all times except between approximately midnight and 6:00 a.m., when the shuttle does not run. The next station to the east is Grand Central.

The island platform replaced a layout dating from the original IRT subway, completed in 1904. It was originally a four-track local stop with two side platforms outside the local tracks. Most of the wall along the side platform for track 1 was removed in 1914 to provide a connection to the new Times Square station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. An underpass formerly connected the original side platforms. In 1918, the southbound express track (formerly track 2) was removed and replaced by a temporary wooden platform for access to the original northbound express track (formerly track 3). Track 3&#x27;s wooden platform was subsequently replaced by a more permanent platform, while the old local platforms still served tracks 1 and 4. Track 3 was taken out of service on November 7, 2020, and was replaced with the island platform. 

The old platforms were connected on the west (railroad north) side. A movable walkway crossed track 4, the former northbound local track; the walkway could be temporarily removed to allow access to and from that track. Because of the curvature on the platforms, gap fillers under the platforms were used on tracks 1 and 3. These two platforms were concave and curved toward the shuttle trains. Track 1 was long and track 3 was long. Track 4 did not have gap fillers because of the convex curve of the platform, curving away from the shuttle trains. The platform serving Track 4 was only long, and could barely fit the three cars of the shuttle.

=== Design ===
As with other stations built as part of the original IRT, the station was constructed using a cut-and-cover method. The tunnel is covered by a U-shaped trough that contains utility pipes and wires. The bottom of this trough contains a foundation of concrete no less than thick. Each platform consists of concrete slabs, beneath which are drainage basins. The platform next to track 1 contain circular Doric columns spaced every . Prior to the 2019–2022 reconstruction, there were additional columns between the tracks and on track 3&#x27;s platform, spaced every , which supported the jack-arched concrete station roofs. The renovation removed or relocated many of these columns so they are spaced at wider intervals, and an island platform was built atop tracks 2 and 3. There is a gap between the trough wall and the platform walls, which are made of -thick brick covered over by a tiled finish.

The original decorative scheme for the side platforms consisted of blue tile station-name tablets, blue and pink tile bands, multicolored tile pilasters, a buff faience cornice, and buff faience plaques. The mosaic tiles at all original IRT stations were manufactured by the American Encaustic Tile Company, which subcontracted the installations at each station. The decorative work was performed by faience contractor Grueby Faience Company. The former southbound local platform (serving track 1) still has a vestiges of a doorway to the Knickerbocker Hotel, while the former northbound local platform (which once served track 4) retains a former doorway to the Times Building. Small sections of the original wall remained before the station&#x27;s reconstruction, with brick wainscoting capped by a marble band and white tiles. The platform also has cooling fans.


=== Track layout ===
North of the station, track 4 merges into the northbound IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line local track along the original subway alignment, north of the current Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line station. The other three tracks once curved parallel to this. Track 1 ends at a bumper block at the west end of the platform. Track 3 originally also ended at a bumper block at the west end of its platform. There is no track connection between track 4 and the other tracks anywhere along the shuttle.

== BMT Broadway Line platforms ==
The Times Square–42nd Street station on the BMT Broadway Line is an express station, with four tracks and two island platforms. The N and Q both stop here at all times; the R stops here except at night, and the W stops here only on weekdays during the day. The local tracks are used by N, R and W trains, while the express tracks are only used during the day by Q trains as well as limited rush hour N trains. During the night, the Q uses the local tracks. The next station to the north is 49th Street for local trains and 57th Street–Seventh Avenue for express trains. The next station to the south is 34th Street–Herald Square.

Two stairs and one elevator from each platform ascend to the primary mezzanine. At the far south end of each platform, two stairs ascend to the southern BMT mezzanine. Near the center of the southbound platform, a set of stairs rises to the 41st Street corridor of the primary mezzanine.

The tunnel is covered by a U-shaped trough that contains utility pipes and wires. The bottom of this trough contains a concrete foundation no less than thick. Each platform consists of concrete slabs, beneath which are drainage basins. The platforms contain I-beam columns spaced every . Additional columns between the tracks, spaced every , support the jack-arched concrete station roofs. The trackside walls also contain exposed I-beam columns, dividing the trackside walls into wide panels. The panels on the trackside walls consist of white square ceramic tiles. A frieze with multicolored geometric patterns runs atop the trackside walls, and a plaque with a framed white &quot;42&quot; tile is placed inside the frieze every . The walls at the south ends of the platforms are untiled.

The express tracks north of the station spread out to pass around a crossunder in the Times Square shuttle platforms. This crossunder was sealed off in the 1960s.
== IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line platforms ==
The Times Square–42nd Street station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line is an express station, with four tracks and two island platforms. The 1, 2, and 3 trains stop here at all times. The next station to the north is 50th Street for local trains and 72nd Street for express trains. The next station to the south is 34th Street–Penn Station.

The platforms are long, and were extended to the south in 1959. Stairways to the other lines are provided at the northern end and in the center of each platform; two stairways from each platform lead to the lower mezzanine level while the remainder lead to mezzanines above the platforms. An elevator leads from each platform to the upper mezzanine; the southbound elevator also leads to the lower mezzanine and the Flushing Line platform.

The tunnel is covered by a U-shaped trough that contains utility pipes and wires. The bottom of this trough contains a concrete foundation no less than thick. Each platform consists of concrete slabs, beneath which are drainage basins. The platforms contain I-beam columns spaced every . Additional columns between the tracks, spaced every , support the jack-arched concrete station roofs. The trackside walls also contain exposed I-beam columns, dividing the trackside walls into wide panels. The panels on the trackside walls consist of white square ceramic tiles. A frieze with multicolored geometric patterns runs atop the trackside walls, and a plaque with a stylized &quot;T&quot; is placed inside the frieze at intervals of every three panels.

Just south of the station, a fifth center track begins, formed by a connection from each express track. This track merges back into the two express tracks just before 34th Street–Penn Station. This center track was used in the past for turning rush hour &quot;Gap Trains&quot;, which would head back up north.

== IRT Flushing Line platform ==
The Times Square–42nd Street station on the IRT Flushing Line has one island platform and two tracks, located deep below West 41st Street. The 7 train stops here at all times, and the &lt;7&gt; train stops here during rush hours in the peak direction. The station is between 34th Street–Hudson Yards to the west and Fifth Avenue to the east. Stairs, escalators, and an elevator along the platform lead to various mezzanines.

The platform consists of concrete slabs, beneath which are drainage basins. The platform contains I-beam columns spaced every . Large H-section columns, supporting horizontal I-beams, also support the tall ceilings of the Flushing Line station. Above the escalators, X-supports and diagonally braced lateral beams also support the ceiling. The trackside walls also contain exposed I-beam columns, dividing the trackside walls into wide panels. The panels on the trackside walls consist of white square ceramic tiles. A frieze with multicolored geometric patterns runs atop the trackside walls, and a plaque with a framed white &quot;TS&quot; tile is placed inside the frieze every . Similar mosaics run along the bases of the trackside walls as well.

The tracks continue south (compass west) beyond the station to the 34th Street station. These tracks formerly led to a storage and layover area, but the tracks were replaced and inspected as part of the 7 Subway Extension, and new third rail was installed. The closed lower-level platform on the IND Eighth Avenue Line was blocking the line but since removed.

== Artwork ==

=== Original artwork ===
George Lewis Heins and Christopher Grant LaFarge were the first commissioned architects of the IRT. They designed the original Times Square Station, which was located at the current Grand Central Shuttle stop. In many of their stations, Heins and LaFarge used symbolic imagery to honor a neighborhood or its namesake. When Squire Vickers took over as chief designer and architect of the IRT in 1906, he continued this tradition of using symbolism to speak to a station&#x27;s history.

The colored tile trim of the IRT portions of the station closely resembles the Confederate flag. Scholars believe that Vickers and his colleagues unmistakably reference the symbol of the South to pay homage to &quot;New York Times&quot; owner Adolph S. Ochs. The &quot;Times&quot; had built a new headquarters directly above part of the subway station in 1904. After a 2010s movement in which Confederate monuments nationwide were removed, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced in August 2017 that these tiles would be replaced; the tiles were subsequently covered with stickers.

=== Commissioned artwork ===
The station complex contains several artworks commissioned as part of the MTA Arts &amp; Design program. In 1991, Norman B. Colp created &quot;The Commuter&#x27;s Lament&quot; or &quot;A Close Shave&quot;, a series of signs attached to the roof of the 41st Street passageway between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, inspired by classic Burma-Shave ads. In order, the signs read &quot;Overslept/So tired/If late/Get fired/Why bother?/Why the pain?/Just go home/Do it again.&quot; The last panel is a picture of a bed. The panels were part of an art project that was supposed to last only one year, but were never removed. The MTA also commissioned a mosaic mural by Jack Beal titled &quot;The Return of Spring&quot; (2001), which is located in the 41st Street passageway. The MTA commissioned a second mural from Beal in 2005, &quot;The Onset of Winter&quot;. They present the classical myth of Persephone set against the backdrop of the subway.

Jacob Lawrence created a mosaic mural called &quot;New York in Transit&quot;, which was installed in 2001 above the BMT mezzanine, and depicts several topics related to New York City. &quot;New York in Transit&quot; was Lawrence&#x27;s last public work before his 2000 death. Near the BMT mezzanine&#x27;s connection with the shuttle platform, Roy Lichtenstein created &quot;Times Square Mural&quot;, which was installed in 2002. &quot;Times Square Mural&quot; is made from porcelain enamel on steel and measures ; it depicts an elongated car traveling through a subway station. Lichtenstein died in 1997 before the mural could be installed; he had completed &quot;Times Square Mural&quot; in 1994, but installation was delayed until after the station complex&#x27;s renovation. The mezzanine between 41st and 42nd Street contains the artwork &quot;Times Square Times: 35 Times&quot; by Toby Buonagurio, which was installed in 2005. The artwork consists of tiles depicting fashion, performing arts, or , which are embedded in a glass-brick wall. The mezzanine under the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line at 41st Street contains a mosaic artwork by Jane Dickson, &quot;Revelers&quot;. The mosaics depict about 70 life-size people who are moving around in groups.

The shuttle station contains the artworks &quot;Each One&quot;, &quot;Every One&quot; and &quot;Equal All&quot;, all installed in 2021 and designed by Nick Cave. &quot;Every One&quot; (2021), in the passageway between the Times Square and 42nd Street–Bryant Park stations, consists of a mosaic flanking 11 digital screens; one side of the mosaic measures long and the other measures long. The mosaic and screens both depict figures in &quot;Soundsuits&quot;, sculptural costumes made in a variety of materials. The two other artworks are &quot;Each One&quot; at the new shuttle entrance and &quot;Equal All&quot; on the island platform.

<text>Vasto (Abruzzese: &quot;&quot;; , ) is a &quot;comune&quot; on the Adriatic coast of the Province of Chieti, in southern Abruzzo, Italy. During the Middle Ages it was called &quot;Guastaymonis&quot;, &quot; Vasto d&#x27;Aimone&quot; or &quot;Waste d&#x27;Aimone&quot;. Fascist Italy called the city Istonio, but it was renamed Vasto in 1944.

== History ==

=== Ancient period ===
According to legend, the town was founded by Diomedes, the Greek hero. The earliest archaeological relics date to 1300 BC. Histonium was one of the key towns of the Frentani, located on the Adriatic coast, about south of the promontory called Punta Penna.

Ancient geographers cited the town as located in the territory of the Frentani and apparently under Julius Caesar did not obtain the rank of a &quot;colonia&quot;, but continued to bear the title of a &quot;municipium&quot;, as we learn from some inscriptions.
Under the Roman Empire, the municipium of Histonium was a flourishing and opulent town, further attested by the existing ruins of an ancient Roman theatre, baths, and other public edifices, besides numerous mosaics, statues, and columns of granite or marble.

Among the numerous inscriptions which have been found, one of the most curious records the fact of a young boy named Lucius Valerius Pudens having at thirteen years of age won the prize for Latin poetry in the contest held at Rome in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. The name of Histonium is still found in the Itineraries of the fourth century and it probably never ceased to exist on its present site, though ravaged successively by the Goths, the Lombards, the Franks, and the Arabs.

Histonium had no natural port, and it is not improbable that in the days of its prosperity it depended on the port at the Punta Penna, where the current harbour that is the and the lighthouse are located, where there is good anchorage, and where Roman remains have also been found, which have been regarded, but probably erroneously, as those of the settlement of Buca.

=== Middle Ages ===
After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the region was occupied by Germanic tribes until Justinian&#x27;s Byzantine re-conquest, which included the province of Samnium, of which Histonium was a key town. However soon after Justinian&#x27;s death, Histonium fell to the Lombards and incorporated into the Duchy of Benevento. Later, circa 774 AD, the town was conquered by the Franks. Subsequently, in 1053, the Normans under Robert Guiscard in turn captured it along with the Duchy of Benevento. Around 1076, Histonium was renamed Guastaymonis, or the Waste of Aimone (), following raids, hence its current name. From the 13th century it was part of the Kingdom of Naples, which later merged into the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

In the 15th century the city&#x27;s urban structure was transformed by the condottiero Giacomo Caldora, who had become its lord. The Caldora family built new city walls still seen today, including the Torre Bassano tower in Piazza Rossetti, the Torre Diomede in Vico Storto del Passero, the Torre Diamante in Piazza Verdi and Porta Catena, and with Castello Caldoresco as its primary defensive outpost.

In 1566, Turkish Ottoman naval forces, led by Piyale Pasha, destroyed much of the city by fire, including the Castello Caldoresco, the Church of Santa Margherita and the Palazzo d&#x27;Avalos (formerly a home of Vittoria Colonna – close confidante of Michelangelo – now the Musei di Palazzo d&#x27;Avalos).

=== From Spanish rule until Italy&#x27;s Unification ===
Under the Spanish rule of southern Italy, Vasto became fief of the Marquis d&#x27;Avalos, and under the reign of Cesare Michelangelo (marquis from 1697 to 1729), Vasto reached its zenith. Only superficially shaken by revolutionary events in 1799 (a short-lived Republic of Vasto was immediately overthrown by the sanfedista, or loyalists), the city&#x27;s history was reflected in the nation&#x27;s throughout the Restoration to the Unity of Italy when a liberal elite governed.

The poet and scholar Gabriele Rossetti was born in Vasto on 28 February 1783. Rossetti&#x27;s published works include literary criticism, Romantic poetry such as his long poem &quot;Il Veggente in Solitudine&quot; of 1846, and his autobiography. Gabriele went into political exile in 1821, settling in London, England.

He was the father of well-known pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti and poet Christina Rossetti. Gabriele died on 24 April 1854 and is buried in London&#x27;s Highgate Cemetery with his wife Frances Polidori.

=== Modern ===
In the early 20th century, Vasto changed its architectural and urban features. The historical centre was redrawn and the foundations were set for drastic alterations during the 1920s and 1930s, with Mussolini decreeing a name change to Istonio in 1938, the official name until the liberation of the city from the Allied Forces in 1944.

Despite a devastating landslide (1956) that dragged a significant part of the eastern ridge – now Via Adriatica – into the gorge below, the years following World War II witnessed industrial, urban, and socio-cultural development. The city also discovered its tourist vocation: besides the progressive development of its beaches in Marina di Vasto, Roman-era thermal baths, mosaics, cisterns and remains of an amphitheatre were found and restored.

During the 1970s until the recent days, the town underwent a remarkable change and a fast growth, with several housing, road and other infrastructure projects built to accommodate the emigrating population from the inner areas of Southern Abruzzo, which have made it one of the most populous of the region.

== Main sights ==

The old part of the town (&quot;centro storico&quot;) features a number of buildings and churches dating from the 12th-18th centuries, including:
*Vasto Cathedral (&quot;Cattedrale di San Giuseppe&quot;)
*Santa Maria Maggiore: largest and oldest (mentioned in a document as early as 1195) church in the town, with a quite tall bell tower. Damaged by the Turks in 1566, and by a fire in 1645, it received a thorough restructuring in 1735 in which it got the current shape. It hosts one of alleged Jesus&#x27; crown of thorns (&quot;Sacra Spina&quot;).
*Castello Caldoresco
*Palazzo D&#x27;Avalos: Imposing palace in the center of town, now houses the Civic Museums, including a museum of archeology and the town Art Gallery (Musei Civici)

Below the hill on which the town is located, the beach resort town of Marina di Vasto offers a large sandy beach and several hotels and other facilities.
Further north the coast becomes rocky and features interesting pebble and stone beaches and coves, as well as the typical &quot;trabocchi&quot;, typical wooden fishing machines of the Southern Abruzzo coast.
Amongst the natural areas, also featuring a number of sandy and rocky beaches, is the protected natural area of the Riserva Naturale di Punta Aderci, whose beaches were voted in 2014 third of the top 20 beaches in Italy.

<text>JYP is an ice hockey team playing in the Finnish top division Liiga. They play in Jyväskylä, Finland, at the LähiTapiola Areena.

==History==
JYP was founded in 1923. First it was the ice hockey section of the sports club &quot;Jyväskylän Palloilijat&quot; The current full name of the club is, having been registered as an osakeyhtiö since 1999. JYP has won the Finnish SM-liiga twice, in 2009 and 2012, having been the losing side in the play-off finals in 1989 and 1992.

===Early years===
JYP was founded in 1923 as Jyväskylän Palloilijat (&quot;Jyväskylä&#x27;s Ballsport players&quot; in English). Originally the club was multi-sport club having competitive departments in football, pesäpallo (Finnish baseball), bandy and later ice hockey and basketball. In 1977 JyP divided due to financial reasons and ice hockey department began with new club, JyP HT (officially Jyväskylän Palloilijat Hockey Team) while football department formed JyP-77 (JJK Jyväskylä nowadays).

The new club started in I Division, the then-second tier of Finnish hockey. JyP HT promoted to the top tier for the 1985-86 SM-liiga season. With ambitious aims, they were fifth after regular season and surprisingly eliminated out of play-offs by only two points. At the next season, the target was in play-offs but seventh place was not enough. When the beginning of the third season was disappointment, head coach Erkka Westerlund – subsequently Finnish national team coach – got sacked.

===Partnership with the Boston Bruins===
On 8 September 2010, JYP entered into a partnership agreement with the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL), to enable player transfer and training between the two teams and their developmental systems.

<text>reStructuredText (RST, ReST, or reST) is a file format for textual data used primarily in the Python programming language community for technical documentation.

It is part of the Docutils project of the Python Doc-SIG (Documentation Special Interest Group), aimed at creating a set of tools for Python similar to Javadoc for Java or Plain Old Documentation (POD) for Perl. Docutils can extract comments and information from Python programs, and format them into various forms of program documentation.

In this sense, reStructuredText is a lightweight markup language designed to be both processable by documentation-processing software such as Docutils, and be easily readable by human programmers who are reading and writing Python source code.

== History ==
reStructuredText evolved from an earlier lightweight markup language called StructuredText (developed by Zope). There were a number of problems with StructuredText, and reST was developed to address them.
The name reStructuredText was chosen to indicate that reST is a &quot;revised, reworked, and reinterpreted StructuredText.&quot;

Parts of the reST syntax were inspired by the Setext language from the early 1990s. Elements of the common RFC822 Internet Message Format and Javadoc formats were also considered for inclusion in the design.

reStructuredText was first released in June 2001. It began to see significant use in the Python community in 2002.

== Reference implementation ==
The reference implementation of the reST parser is a component of the Docutils text processing framework in the Python programming language, but other parsers are available.

The Docutils project has not registered any MIME type for reStructuredText nor designated any unregistered MIME type as official, but documents the MIME type codice_1 as in &quot;de facto&quot; use by, for example, the build system for the Python website. The same MIME type is used in the freedesktop.org file type database used by desktop environments on Linux. Another MIME type, , was registered as a vanity MIME type by a third party in 2003 to represent reStructuredText, and remains the only IANA-registered MIME type for reStructuredText, although it is not acknowledged as such by the Docutils project.

== Applications ==
reStructuredText is commonly used for technical documentation, for example, in documentation of Python libraries. However, it is suitable for a wide range of texts.

Since 2008, reST has been a core component of Python&#x27;s Sphinx document generation system.

Trac also supports reStructuredText, as do GitHub and Bitbucket.

In 2011, Distributed Proofreaders, which prepared texts for Project Gutenberg, was considering adoption of reST as a basic format from which other ebook formats could be generated.

In July 2016 the Linux kernel project decided to transition from DocBook based documentation to reStructuredText and the Sphinx toolchain.

The software build tool CMake switched from a custom markup language to reStructuredText in version 3.0 for its documentation.

<doc id="730906" wikidata="Q5419675" url="?curid=730906" title="Exclusion principle (philosophy)">
<text>The exclusion principle is a philosophical principle that states:

:If an event &quot;e&quot; causes event &quot;e*&quot;, then there is no event &quot;e#&quot; such that &quot;e#&quot; is non-supervenient on &quot;e&quot; and &quot;e#&quot; causes &quot;e*&quot;.

==In physicalism==

The exclusion principle is most commonly applied when one poses this scenario: One usually considers the desire to lift one&#x27;s arm as a mental event, and the lifting of one&#x27;s arm a physical event. According to the exclusion principle, there must be no event that does not supervene on &quot;e&quot; while causing &quot;e*&quot;. To show this better, substitute &quot;&quot;the desire to lift one&#x27;s arm&quot; for &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;one to lift their arm&quot; for &quot;e*&quot;&quot;.

:If &quot;the desire to lift one&#x27;s arm&quot; causes &quot;one to lift their arm&quot;, then there is no event such that it is non-supervenient on &quot;the desire to lift one&#x27;s arm&quot; and it causes &quot;one to lift their arm&quot;.

This is interpreted as meaning that mental events supervene upon the physical. However, some philosophers do not accept this principle, and accept epiphenomenalism, which states that mental events are caused by physical events, but physical events are not caused by mental events (called &quot;causal impotence&quot;). However, If &quot;e#&quot; does not cause &quot;e&quot;, then there is no way to verify that &quot;e*&quot; exists. Yet, this debate has not been settled in the philosophical community.

<doc id="730907" wikidata="Q1316942" url="?curid=730907" title="Focal cortical dysplasia">
<text>Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a congenital abnormality of brain development where the neurons in an area of the brain failed to migrate in the proper formation &quot;in utero&quot;. &quot;Focal&quot; means that it is limited to a focal zone in any lobe. Focal cortical dysplasia is a common cause of intractable epilepsy in children and is a frequent cause of epilepsy in adults. There are three types of FCD with subtypes, including type 1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d, each with distinct histopathological features. All forms of focal cortical dysplasia lead to disorganization of the normal structure of the cerebral cortex:

* Type 1 FCD exhibits subtle alterations in cortical lamination. 
* Type 2a FCD exhibits neurons that are larger than normal that are called dysmorphic neurons (DN). FCD type 2b exhibits complete loss of laminar structure, and the presence of DN and enlarged cells are called balloon cells (BC) for their large elliptical cell body shape, laterally displaced nucleus, and lack of dendrites or axons. The developmental origin of balloon cells is currently believed to be derived from neuronal or glial progenitor cells. Balloon cells are similar in structure to giant cells in the disorder tuberous sclerosis complex. 
* Type 3 FCDs are cortical disorganisation associated with other lesions such as hippocampal sclerosis (type 3a), long-term epilepsy-associated tumors (3b), vascular malformations (3c) or scar/hypoxic damages (3d).

Recent studies have demonstrated that FCD types 2a and 2b result from somatic mutations in genes that encode components of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Causative gene mutations for types 1 and 3 have not been identified. The mTOR pathway regulates a number of functions in the brain including establishment of cell size, cell motility, and differentiation. Gene mutations associated with FCD2a and FCD 2b include &quot;MTOR, PI3KCA, AKT3,&quot; and &quot;DEPDC5&quot;. Mutations in these genes lead to enhanced mTOR pathway signaling at critical periods in brain development. Some recent evidence may suggest a role for in utero infection with certain viruses such as cytomegalovirus and human papilloma virus.

Seizures in FCD are likely caused by abnormal circuitry induced by the presence of DNs and BCs. These abnormal cell types generate abnormal electrical signals which spread out to affect other parts of the cerebral cortex. Medication is used to treat the seizures that may arise due to cortical dysplasia. Epilepsy surgery to remove areas of FCD is a viable treatment option for appropriate candidates.

== Treatment ==
No specific treatment is required for cortical dysplasia, and all treatment is aimed at the resulting symptoms (typically seizures). When a cortical dysplasia is a cause of epilepsy, then seizure medications (anticonvulsants) are a first line treatment. If anticonvulsants fail to control seizure activity, neurosurgery may be an option to remove or disconnect the abnormal cells from the rest of the brain (depending on where the cortical dysplasia is located and the safety of the surgery relative to continued seizures). Neurosurgery can range from removing an entire hemisphere (hemispherectomy), a small lesionectomy, or multiple transections to try to disconnect the abnormal tissue from the rest of the brain (multiple subpial transsections). Physical therapy should be considered for infants and children with muscle weakness. Educational therapy is often prescribed for those with developmental delays, but there is no complete treatment for the delays.

<doc id="730910" wikidata="Q14713795" url="?curid=730910" title="Little Spokane River">
<text>The Little Spokane River is a major tributary of the Spokane River, approximately long, in eastern Washington in the United States. It drains a rural area of forested foothills and a farming valley north of the city of Spokane along the Idaho–Washington border. It has two branches, one starting west of Newport and the other stemming from Eloika Lake farther west.

The two branches come together between the communities of Elk upstream and Milan downstream. The supply from Eloika is quite warm in the summer and has different fish habitat than the colder branch from Newport.

It rises in southern Pend Oreille County, south of Newport near the Idaho state line. It flows south-southwest past the communities of Elk, Milan, Chattaroy, Buckeye, Colbert, Dartford and Fairwood. It joins the Spokane River from the east approximately northwest of Spokane. Between Fairwood and the confluence the stream flows through a natural area with an Indian painted rock, several trails to walk on and berths for canoes and kayaks, though swimming and inflatable rafts are prohibited The Spokane House historical site was located where the Little Spokane and Spokane Rivers come together. The speed and depth varies in the river but is generally slow moving and deep. The river has an average width of . The river is one of only two waterways in Washington state where the waterway itself is not public and is owned by the landowners of the abutting property.

==Fish==
The Little Spokane River contains both native and introduced fish species. Redband trout, rainbow trout are residualzied from anadromous steelhead, while suckerfish migrated from Spokane River, pikeminnow, longnose dace, speckled dace, sculpin and native mountain whitefish are indigenous. Due to the once-anadromous coastal rainbow trout now sharing spawning time with the residential redband trout, the trout found in this river are most often hybridized and neither genetically pure redband nor coastal rainbow. Strict rules are placed for the winter whitefish season. 
Many cold and warm-water non-native fish species have been introduced into the river basin. The non-native fish species listed by Washington Department of Ecology are brook trout, brown trout, grass pickerel, pumpkinseed, green sunfish, largemouth bass, tench, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. It is probable that these non native fish were introduced through upper portions of the watershed basin such as Eloika, Chain, Sacheen, and Horseshoe Lakes, all of which contain the listed non-native fish.

===Fishing on the Little Spokane River ===
Flyfishing is popular on The Little Spokane River but standard angling does work and is legal.

==Human Activities==
In 1893, the ichthyologists Charles Gilbert and Barton Warren Evermann reported extensive damage to the Little Spokane as a result of human activities:
:&quot;The character of this stream is being materially changed by the advent of civilization, a fact which is, or has been, true of most streams in this country. The cutting away of the timber and brush on the immediate bank and the cultivation of the land within the drainage area of the stream have greatly increased the surface erosion and, in consequence, the impurities of the stream.&quot;

<doc id="730912" wikidata="Q101008" url="?curid=730912" title="Gotthard Victor Lechler">
<text>Gotthard Victor Lechler (18 April 1811 – 26 December 1888) was a German Lutheran theologian born in Kloster Reichenbach, near Freudenstadt, in Württemberg.

== Biography ==
He studied at the University of Tübingen under Ferdinand Christian Baur, and later served as a deacon in Waiblingen and Knittlingen. In 1858, he became pastor at the church of St Thomas and professor ordinarius of historical theology at the University of Leipzig.

A disciple of Johann August Wilhelm Neander, he was aligned with the extreme right of the mediating theologians. He is significant as a historian of early Christianity and of the pre-Reformation period. Although Baur was his teacher, he did not adhere to the Tübingen school. In response to the idea of a sharp conflict between the Paulinists and Petrinists, he argued that &quot;we find variety coupled with agreement, and unity with difference, between Paul and the earlier apostles; we recognize the one spirit in the many gifts.&quot;

== Published works ==
His &quot;Das apostolische und das nachapostolische Zeitalter&quot; (1851), which developed out of a prize essay (1849), passed through three editions in Germany (3rd edition, 1885), and was translated into English (&quot;The apostolic and post-apostolic times: their diversity and unity in life and doctrines&quot;, 2 volumes, 1886). The work which in his own opinion was his greatest, &quot;Johann von Wiclif und die Vorgeschichte der Reformation&quot; (2 volumes, 1873), appeared in English with the title &quot;John Wycliffe and his English precursors&quot; (1878, new edition, 1884). An earlier work, &quot;Geschichte des englischen Deismus&quot; (1841), was a contribution to the study of religious thought in England.

Lechler&#x27;s other works include &quot;Geschichte der Presbyterial- und Synodal-verfassung&quot; (1854), &quot;Urkundenfunde zur Geschichte des christl. Altertums&quot; (1886), and biographies of Thomas Bradwardine (1862) and Robert Grosseteste (1867). He wrote part of the commentary on the Acts of the Apostles in Johann Peter Lange&#x27;s &quot;Bibelwerk&quot;. From 1882 he edited with Franz Dibelius the &quot;Beiträge zur sächsischen Kirchengeschichte&quot;. His biography of Johannes Hus, &quot;Johannes Hus ein Lebensbild aus der Vorgeschichte der Reformation&quot; (1889), was published after his death.

<doc id="730921" wikidata="Q5340090" url="?curid=730921" title="Edna Rose Ritchings">
<text>Edna Rose Ritchings (April 4, 1925 – March 4, 2017) was the symbolic maintainer of the International Peace Mission movement. She is also known as Sweet Angel in the movement, or as Mrs. S. A. Divine or Mother Divine because she was the widow of the movement&#x27;s leader, Father Divine. She assisted Father Divine, who claimed to be God, in his declining years. She and her husband lived in a manor home, which doubled as a Peace Mission headquarters and church known as the Woodmont manor &amp; estate from 1953. It is located at Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, a Philadelphia suburb. Father Divine died in 1965 and was later interred in a crypt and mausoleum on the premises. The Woodmont estate continued to be the home of Mrs. Divine.

A Canadian convert from Vancouver, Ritchings was drawn to the movement in its decline in the early 1940s while she was still in high school. As did many adherents of Father Divine, she broke ties with her parents, and adopted a new name, &quot;Sweet Angel&quot;. Moving to the then-headquarters of the movement in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she became one of Father Divine&#x27;s personal secretaries. She proposed to him one day in the office by saying, &quot;I want to marry you because I know you are God.&quot;

They were married in secret on April 29, 1946, in Washington, D.C. Ritchings was 21, and Father Divine about 65. The marriage was secret from most followers until Ritchings&#x27;s visa expired in the summer of 1946, and Father Divine had to disclose it. The wedding date, April 29, thereafter became a celebrated anniversary in the movement.

Father Divine claimed to his flock that Ritchings was the spirit of his first wife reborn. His first wife, Peninniah (d. 1943), was also commonly called &quot;Mother Divine&quot;. Reincarnation had not previously been part of Father Divine&#x27;s doctrine, indeed he had said that the notion of an afterlife was absurd. To prove that it was a chaste marriage in accordance with his teachings, Father Divine assigned a female disciple to be Ritchings&#x27;s constant companion.

Due to Father Divine&#x27;s declining health, Mother Divine presided over an increasing number of Peace Mission banquets. Upon his death in 1965, she became the official leader of the movement, a position she continued to hold until her death. The Movement has nearly dwindled to extinction because few new converts have joined and Peace Mission doctrine forbids sex.

Mother S. A. Divine fought an attempt by Jim Jones, the head of Peoples Temple, to take over the movement in 1971. Jones based some of his doctrines on the International Peace Mission movement, and claimed to be the reincarnation of Father Divine. The two battled for years, with Divine sending spies into Jones&#x27; Peoples Temple and Jones doing the same to the Peace Mission. Converts to the Peoples Temple wrote Mother Divine trying to convince her that Jones was Father Divine until the infamous mass suicide in Jonestown, Guyana in 1978.

Mother Divine died on March 4, 2017, at the age of 91 at the Peace Mission&#x27;s Woodmont Estate. A statement named &quot;complications of old age&quot; as the cause of death.

<doc id="730926" wikidata="Q1997056" url="?curid=730926" title="Poyle">
<text>Poyle is a largely industrial and agricultural area in the unitary authority of Slough, in the ceremonial county of Berkshire, England (of which it is the easternmost settlement). It is located west of Charing Cross in London and immediately west of the M25 motorway, near Heathrow Airport; it also adjoins the Colne Valley regional park.

Historically in Middlesex, Poyle was transferred to Surrey in 1965 and to Berkshire in 1995. Together with the neighbouring village of Colnbrook to the west, it forms the Colnbrook with Poyle civil parish.

==History==

Poyle lay within Middlesex since before the Norman Conquest as part of Stanwell, developing a manor in the early Middle Ages. In 1894 it became part of Staines Urban District, which transferred to Surrey in 1965 following the dissolution of Middlesex. In 1974, Staines Urban District was absorbed into the new borough of Spelthorne under the Local Government Act 1972; the construction of the M25 in the 1980s separated Poyle from the other settlements in the borough. In 1995, it and the neighbouring village of Colnbrook (in Buckinghamshire) were transferred to Berkshire, forming the new Colnbrook with Poyle parish within the borough of Slough.

Poyle is now contiguous with Colnbrook.

==Transport==
London Buses route 81, operated by London United, serves Poyle; other bus services are provided by First Berkshire &amp; The Thames Valley.

The Staines &amp; West Drayton Railway was built through Poyle in the 1880s, and at one stage two stations served the area: Poyle for Stanwell Moor Halt, which opened in 1927, and Poyle Estate Halt, which opened in 1954. Both were closed in 1965 when passenger services on the railway were withdrawn, and the track was lifted in 1981 due to the construction of the M25.

==Heathrow Airport==

Poyle is the location of a major Federal Express (FedEx) sorting office where parcels and letters are processed before being air dispatched to overseas destinations via nearby Heathrow airport. Due to its proximity to Heathrow airport Poyle lies under the flight path of many departing/arriving routes. Poyle Residents Association have long campaigned for restrictions on night flights from Heathrow airport. Along with other local village/town residents&#x27; groups they have been involved in second stage consultation talks (during 2005) with the DTI about this problem.
Poyle is also the British location for the Aerospace Fire Protection Company, named Graviner (which was part of Wilkinson Sword) and is now Kidde-Graviner part of the United Technologies
Corporation Group. Poyle is now home to the Hilton London Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 which was opened on 31 August 2011 and the Travelodge UK Heathrow Terminal 5.

<doc id="730930" wikidata="Q470638" url="?curid=730930" title="Loyalist, Ontario">
<text>Loyalist is a lower-tier township municipality in central eastern Ontario, Canada on Lake Ontario. It is in Lennox and Addington County and consists of two parts: the mainland and Amherst Island. It was named for the United Empire Loyalists, who settled in the area after the American Revolution.

Loyalist Township was formed on January 1, 1998, through the amalgamation of Amherst Island Township, Ernestown Township, and Bath Village.

==Communities==
The primary centres of settlement in Loyalist are Amherstview, Bath and Odessa. Smaller communities include Asselstine, Bayview, Emerald, Ernestown, Links Mills, McIntyre, Millhaven, Morven, Nicholsons Point, Stella, Storms Corners, Switzerville, Thorpe, Violet and Wilton. Since Loyalist Township is the only municipal level of government in the area, the boundaries of most &quot;mainland&quot; settlements are unofficial and matters of tradition.

===Amherstview===
Amherstview is named for Amherst Island, located directly to the south in Lake Ontario. When the community was first established in the 1950s, the spelling was generally &quot;Amherst View&quot;. The community is the eastern end of the Loyalist Parkway, a stretch of Highway 33 that travels along Lake Ontario, in an area in which many United Empire Loyalists settled. As of 2021, Amherstview has a population of about 6500.

Amherstview is home to Fairfield House which is situated in Fairfield Park on the shore of Lake Ontario. Fairfield House was constructed in 1793 by the Fairfield family who were among the first Loyalists to settle the area. It served as the family home and a portion of the building was also used as a tavern for some time. The wood and limestone building is now a museum exhibiting period artifacts and furniture and offering guided tours.

Fairfield Park itself stretches along more than 600 m of Lake Ontario shoreline. The park is a popular picnicking area and is also well used by swimmers and scuba divers. Limestone shelf rock formations leading into the water simplify the launching and landing of kayaks and canoes although suitable facilities for larger watercraft do not exist. The park is home to many species of trees including red oak, poplar, willow, shagbark hickory, ash, maple, cedar, linden, and spruce. Extensive banks of lilac provide flowers and fragrance in season and many of the larger trees in the park are fitted with strings of lights for display at Christmas.

Amherstview is also home to the Henderson Recreation Centre. The centre houses a public library, a 25 m public swimming pool, and an arena and also includes an outdoor soccer field. The arena is the home rink for the Amherstview Jets hockey team.

===Bath===
Bath was first settled by the United Empire Loyalists in 1784, making it one of the oldest communities in Ontario. It was served by an early colonial road, the 1784 Bath Road, which follows the lakefront as the Loyalist Parkway. Discharged soldiers from Jessup&#x27;s Rangers were the first settlers. The economic development of the community was enabled by a sheltered harbour and road connections with Kingston stimulated economic development. By mid-century Bath was a prosperous point of trade. After the town had been divided up between the families of Hawley, Davy, Rose and Amey, it was John Davy who was first to lay down roads on his lot #10. By 1804 the whole village had been prepared for settlement and surveyed. The village was originally named Ernestown, but was renamed Bath in 1819 after the city in England.

A bustling lakefront manufacturing village with 400-1000 people in the 1850s, Bath began to lose industrial importance to Napanee (and to cities like Kingston/Belleville) after being successively bypassed by the York Road (1817), the Grand Trunk Railway (1856) and the 401 motorway (1964). The closest rail access was an 1856 Ernestown rail station built to the west of Camden East Road in a rural area, similar in design to Napanee&#x27;s historic station; it is now boarded up and inaccessible.

The town of Bath as of 2016 has a population of 2,154. This is an increase of 10.1% from 2011 when they had a population of 1,957.

===Odessa===

Odessa, originally named Millcreek, was renamed in 1855 by its postmaster to commemorate the 1854 British siege of the Black Sea port at Odesa in Ukraine during the Crimean War. The village is home to Ernestown Secondary School, which services about 650 students from Loyalist Township (formerly Ernestown Township), Napanee and Stone Mills. The township offices and a fire hall are on Odessa&#x27;s Main Street. There is a small fairground. An Ontario Provincial Police detachment serves Ontario Highway 401 and is home to the Tactics and Rescue Unit Eastern Region.

The water supply of the community of Odessa within the Township of Ernestown was studied in 1972, which led to the planning of infrastructure improvements. The highest point in the village is the water tower. Visible for several kilometres in all directions, the water tower has been outfitted as a wireless communications facility. The village bills itself as &quot;home of the Babcock Mill,&quot; which historically was powered by Millhaven Creek which runs through the heart of Odessa. In the 2020s Odessa has experienced increased residential development which will ultimately see it approximately double in population.

===Amherst Island===
Stella and Emerald are located on Amherst Island. Stella is the downtown, where the ferry docks are, and lends its name as the surviving Canada Post Office for Amherst Island. Emerald is a collection of half a dozen houses and a church towards the west end of the Island. Amherst Island is located about offshore from mainland Loyalist Township, and is serviced by a people, cyclist, automobile and truck ferry from Millhaven. Amherst Island was farmed for generations by Irish tenants who leased from an Irish Lord through his manager, and many &quot;Islanders&quot; are descendants of those late settlers. Today the agricultural canvas has become an art colony, retirement/ cottage country, with active service groups, a radio station, Amherst Island Radio CJAI 101.3 FM, and the LCBO convenience store, that all add to the Island&#x27;s &quot;frison&quot;.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Loyalist had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


Mother tongue (2021):
* English as first language: 92.1%
* French as first language: 2.8%
* English and French as first language: 0.6%
* Other as first language: 3.9%

==Economy==
There is a Bombardier Transportation engineering and manufacturing facility located in Millhaven. The site was originally opened by the now-defunct Urban Transportation Development Corporation around 1978.

In 2010, Bombardier received a $1.5 million grant from the province&#x27;s Eastern Ontario Development Fund to invest in the facility. By 2011, there were 250 full-time employees. Throughout the late 2010s, the facility was used for vehicle manufacturing, testing, and retrofitting work on various Canadian light rail and metro rail projects, including Toronto&#x27;s Eglinton Crosstown, Waterloo Region&#x27;s Ion light rail, Edmonton&#x27;s Valley Line, and part of a large order of Toronto streetcars, tested on a specially constructed TTC gauge track.

==Culture==
The Tragically Hip have a recording studio located in Bath called The Bathouse Recording Studio. The band&#x27;s lead singer, Gordon Downie, was born and raised in Amherstview and attended Amherstview Public School (AVPS).

A 100% volunteer-run community radio station, Amherst Island Radio CJAI 101.3 FM, broadcasts from Stella. The township is also served by media from Kingston.

The Township hosts a Winter Carnival each year toward the end of January. A popular event associated with the Carnival is the Christmas Tree Bonfire. In the weeks after Christmas, residents pile their dead Christmas trees at the Odessa Fair Grounds. On an evening during the Carnival, the trees are set blaze as the centrepiece to a night of skating, outdoor games, and the roasting of hotdogs and marshmallows.

==Transportation==
The township is served by provincial Highway 401 Highway 2, and Highway 33.

Public transportation between Amherstview and Kingston is provided by Kingston Transit.

A toll ferry, the Frontenac II, operates between Millhaven (on the Ontario mainland) and Stella (on Amherst Island). As of January, 2021, the toll is $10 for a return trip ticket on a standard car or light truck. There is a nominal charge for bicycles and motorcycles while walk-on passengers are free.

==Education==
Primary and secondary education is provided at a number of schools operated by either the Limestone District School Board or the Algonquin and Lakeshore Catholic District School Board, including Amherstview Public School (K-8) and Ernestown Intermediate and Secondary School (7-12). The nearest post-secondary education (community college and university) is in the adjacent city of Kingston. One of the first schools in Upper Canada was opened in the village of Bath in 1811.

==Notable residents==
*Emily Julian McManus (1865–1918), poet, author, and educator
*William Metzler (1863–1943), mathematician
*Gord Downie (1964–2017), musician

<text>In medicine (oncology and other fields), performance status is an attempt to quantify cancer patients&#x27; general well-being and activities of daily life. This measure is used to determine whether they can receive chemotherapy, whether dose adjustment is necessary, and as a measure for the required intensity of palliative care. It is also used in oncological randomized controlled trials as a measure of quality of life.

==Scoring systems==

There are various scoring systems. The most generally used are the Karnofsky score and the Zubrod score, the latter being used in publications by the WHO. For children, the Lansky score is used. Another common system is the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) system. Parallel scoring systems include the &quot;Global Assessment of Functioning&quot; (GAF) score, which has been incorporated as the fifth &quot;axis&quot; of the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&quot; (DSM) of psychiatry.

===Karnofsky scoring===
The Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ranking runs from 100 to 0, where 100 is &quot;perfect&quot; health and 0 is death. Practitioners occasionally assign performance scores in between standard intervals of 10. This scoring system is named after Dr. David A. Karnofsky, who described the scale with Dr. Walter H. Abelmann, Dr. Lloyd F. Craver, and Dr. Joseph H. Burchenal in 1948. The primary purpose of its development was to allow physicians to evaluate a patient&#x27;s ability to survive chemotherapy for cancer.

* 100 – Normal; no complaints; no evidence of disease. 
* 90 – Able to carry on normal activity, minor signs or symptoms of disease.
* 80 – Normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease.
* 70 – Cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work.
* 60 – Requires occasional assistance but is able to care for most of their personal needs.
* 50 – Requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care.
* 40 – Disabled; requires special care and assistance.
* 30 – Severely disabled; hospital admission is indicated although death not imminent.
* 20 – Very sick; hospital admission necessary; active supportive treatment necessary.
* 10 – Moribund; fatal processes progressing rapidly.
* 0 – Dead possibly

===ECOG/WHO/Zubrod score===
The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score (published by Oken &quot;et al.&quot; in 1982), also called the WHO or Zubrod score (after C. Gordon Zubrod), runs from 0 to 5, with 0 denoting perfect health and 5 death: Its advantage over the Karnofsky scale lies in its simplicity.
* 0 – Asymptomatic (Fully active, able to carry on all predisease activities without restriction)
* 1 – Symptomatic but completely ambulatory (Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature. For example, light housework, office work) 
* 2 – Symptomatic, &lt;50% in bed during the day (Ambulatory and capable of all self care but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours)
* 3 – Symptomatic, &gt;50% in bed, but not bedbound (Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair 50% or more of waking hours)
* 4 – Bedbound (Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self-care. Totally confined to bed or chair) 
* 5 – Death

===Lansky score===
Children, who might have more trouble expressing their experienced quality of life, require a somewhat more observational scoring system suggested and validated by Lansky &quot;et al.&quot; in 1987:
* 100 – fully active, normal
* 90 – minor restrictions in strenuous physical activity
* 80 – active, but gets tired more quickly
* 70 – greater restriction of play &quot;and&quot; less time spent in play activity
* 60 – up and around, but active play minimal; keeps busy by being involved in quieter activities
* 50 – lying around much of the day, but gets dressed; no active playing; participates in all quiet play and activities
* 40 – mainly in bed; participates in quiet activities
* 30 – bedbound; needing assistance even for quiet play
* 20 – sleeping often; play entirely limited to very passive activities
* 10 – doesn&#x27;t play; does not get out of bed
* 0 – unresponsive

==Comparison==
A translation between the Zubrod and Karnofsky scales that works especially well for healthy patients has been validated in a large sample of lung cancer patients:

*Zubrod 0 equals Karnofsky 90–100
*Zubrod 1 equals Karnofsky 70–80
*Zubrod 2 equals Karnofsky 50–60
*Zubrod 3 equals Karnofsky 30–40
*Zubrod 4 equals Karnofsky 10–20
*Zubrod 5 equals Karnofsky 0

<text>Oulun Kärpät (Finnish for &quot;Oulu Ermines&quot;, sometimes referred to as Kärpät Oulu) is a Finnish professional ice hockey team based in Oulu and playing in the top-tier Finnish Liiga. Kärpät have won the Finnish championship title eight times, and is the most successful Finnish ice hockey team in the 21st century.

==History==
===Early years===
In the spring of 1946, three young men decided to found a new sports club in Oulu. At the constitutional meeting on May 15, 1946, the club was named &quot;Oulun Kärpät 46&quot;. At first, Kärpät played football (soccer) and its first winter sport was bandy.

In the first annual meeting in January 1947, an ice hockey section was established. At the beginning of the new decade, Kärpät was somewhat successful in ice hockey and it became the main sport of the club. The first game at the highest level, then known as &quot;SM-sarja&quot; was played on the December 4, 1960, against HJK of Helsinki, but the visit to the highest level was short and Kärpät lost their position in the series. They made it to the highest level again in 1965–66, but again lost their position. The third attempt in 1967–68 did not produce a better performance, as Kärpät lost all their games.

From the first years onward, Kärpät placed emphasis on working with junior players. The team&#x27;s E-juniors won the first Finnish championship in 1971.

===Promotion and early SM-liiga years===
When the SM-liiga was founded in August 1975, Kärpät were still playing level below in the first division. The team earned promotion to the elite league after the 1976–77 season. In their debut season in SM-liiga, Kärpät managed to finish seventh out of ten teams. During their second season in the top level in 1978–79, however, the team struggled and finished last in the regular season, but proved victorious in the relegation league and retained their place in the top league. On the positive side, Kärpät&#x27;s Kari Jalonen was awarded Jarmo Wasama memorial trophy for the best rookie in league after the season.

===Success in the 1980s===
After having avoided relegation, Kärpät acquired more skilled players, such as Mikko Leinonen. The team&#x27;s performance greatly improved, and in the 1979–80 season Kärpät made it to the playoffs where they proved victorious in the bronze medal game. This marked the first time when Kärpät claimed a medal on the national level. The emergence of young players was continued by Pekka Arbelius who was titled rookie of the year.

In the following season, 1980–81, Kärpät finished third in the regular series, and in the play-offs fought their way to the final series where they would face Tappara. Tappara started the best-out-of-five series in a strong manner, for instance by winning the third game by a score of 13–2. After this devastating loss the series was 2–1 for Tappara. Regardless, the Kärpät head coach Kari Mäkinen managed to boost the team&#x27;s morale, and consequently Kärpät won two consecutive games by scores of 6–1 and 5–2, respectively. Thus, Kärpät clinched the series 3–2 and celebrated the first title for the franchise. The winning goal was scored by Kari Suoraniemi, and Kari Jalonen was named the MVP of the playoffs.

Before the 1981–82 season, a number of key players&#x27; contracts expired and they decided to continue their careers elsewhere. To illustrate, the team lost key and core players such as Jalonen, Suoraniemi, Leinonen and Kai Suikkanen, as well as cult player Reijo Ruotsalainen. With a weakened roster, Kärpät had to settle for fifth place. and the following year, they were nearly relegated. During the era of Pentti Matikainen as a head coach, Kärpät remained a championship contender and won bronze medals in three consecutive years (1983–84, 1984–85 and 1985–86). In Matikainen&#x27;s last season as a coach, in 1986–87, Kärpät somewhat surprisingly won the regular season, but lost to Tappara in the finals. Matikainen was replaced by Kari Mäkinen in 1987–88, but the team failed to make the play-offs. Esko Nokelainen was named as the new coach, but to little avail. In the following season, in 1988–89, Kärpät reached a nadir and Nokelainen was sacked mid-season. Eventually, Kärpät were relegated from the SM-liiga as they lost to Jokerit in the relegation league.

===Bankruptcy and lower divisions===
The goal was to rise again shortly, but it did not work out. Due to financial constraints, Kärpät went into bankruptcy, but in the fall of 1995, they made it to the first division again. In the first year, they came eighth and lost in the playoffs. The next year, they went against KalPa for a place in the league, but ultimately lost. In the following year, they again lost to KalPa. For the 1998–99 season, Kärpät acquired coach Juhani Tamminen. After they played very well in the regular series, they lost to TuTo in the playoffs.

===Return to the elite league===

The next year, Kärpät finally qualified to the SM-liiga by beating Lahti Pelicans in the qualification series. The first season in the elite league was full of ups-and-downs, but Kärpät finished fourth and sixth in successive seasons. They then finally made it to the finals in, but lost to Tappara, similar to in 1987. In the 2003–04 season, Kärpät played in the finals against TPS and finally won their second Finnish Championship. In 2004–05, Kärpät won the Finnish Championship again when they defeated Jokerit in the finals, winning the best-of-five series 3–1. They retained the championship title in the 2006–07 season by beating Jokerit in the finals (3–0) and winning all their games in the playoffs. The first three championships of the 2000s have been celebrated in Oulu with feasts, each gathering tens of thousands of people to rejoice. In the 2007–08 season, the organization won its second consecutive championship title, and the fourth within the last five years, by defeating Espoo Blues in the finals, 4–1.

After a six-year lull, Kärpät returned to the top of Finnish ice hockey under the guidance of Lauri Marjamäki, by winning two consecutive championship titles in the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons. In both occasions, the team defeated Tappara in the play-off finals. Consequently, the team&#x27;s Liiga championships tally was taken to seven. In the 2015–16 season Kärpät failed to defend the championship title, but were able to win the bronze medal game. In the same season, Kärpät finished runners-up in the 2015–16 Champions Hockey League losing 2–1 in the final to Sweden&#x27;s Frölunda HC.

<text>In music, portamento (: &quot;portamenti&quot;; from old , meaning &#x27;carriage&#x27; or &#x27;carrying&#x27;), also known by its French name glissade, is a pitch sliding from one note to another. The term originated from the Italian expression (&#x27;carriage of the voice&#x27;), denoting from the beginning of the 17th century its use in vocal performances and emulation by members of the violin family and certain wind instruments, and is sometimes used interchangeably with anticipation. It is also applied to one type of glissando on, e.g., slide trombones, as well as to the &quot;glide&quot; function of steel guitars and synthesizers.

==Vocal portamento==
In the first example, Rodolfo&#x27;s first aria in &quot;La sonnambula&quot; (1831), the portamento is indicated by the slur between the third and fourth notes. The second example, Judit&#x27;s first line in &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1912) by composer Béla Bartók, employs an inclining, wavy line between the fourth and fifth notes to indicate a continuous, steady rise in pitch. Portamento may, of course, also be used for descending intervals.

==Opinions of vocal portamento==
In the performance of Italian &quot;bel canto&quot; music, the concept of the musical slur and that of the true portamento have not always been held to mean the same thing. This is explained simply by Nicola Vaccai in his &quot;Practical Method of Italian Singing&quot;, originally published 1832, whose opinion in the matter holds some authority. In the sense described by Vaccai, the portamento is not a slur but an ornamental accentuation of the legato linking two distinct notes, without any slide or glide through the intervening notes. In his own opening statements forming the preface to his Lesson XIII, &quot;Modo per portare la voce&quot; (method to carry the voice), Vaccai states: &quot;By carrying the voice from one note to another, it is not meant that you should drag or drawl the voice through all the intermediate intervals, an abuse that is frequently committed—but it means, to &#x27;unite&#x27; perfectly the one note with the other.&quot; He goes on to describe and illustrate that where a consonant falls between the two notes to be ligatured in this way, the portamento is achieved either by &quot;almost insensibly&quot; anticipating the second note of a pair in the final moments of the vowel sound preceding it, or else by minutely deferring the &quot;salto&quot; or leap between the notes until the first moment of the vowel sound in the second note. He adds, &quot;In phrases requiring much grace and expression, it produces a very good effect: the abuse of it, however, is to be carefully avoided, as it leads to mannerism and monotony.&quot;

However, Manuel García (1805–1906), a singing pedagogue of immense renown, in his &quot;New Compendious Treatise of the Art of Singing&quot;, Part 1, Chapter VII, &quot;On Vocalization or Agility (Agilità)&quot;, gave the opposite opinion. Writing of the means by which the voice is conducted from one note to another, he distinguished between &quot;con portamento&quot; (the gliding or slurring mode) and &quot;legato&quot; (simply the smooth mode of vocalization). &quot;To slur is to conduct the voice from one note to another through all the intermediate sounds. ... This dragging of the notes will assist in equalizing the registers, timbres and power of the voice.&quot; He warned that learners should not acquire the bad habit of attacking a note with a slur, a prevailing fault in bad singers. As to &quot;Smooth or Legato Vocalization (Agilità legata e granita)&quot;, it means, &quot;to pass from one sound to another in a neat, sudden, and smooth manner, without interrupting the flow of voice; yet not allowing it to drag or slur over any intermediate sound ... as with the slurred sounds, the air must be subjected to a regular and continuous pressure, so as intimately to unite all the notes with each other.&quot;

There was, therefore, a difference of opinion between these two very distinguished singing masters of the 19th century as to the meaning of portamento, and its relation to the legato and the musical slur. It reflected not merely a distinction of terminology but divergent understandings of a fundamental aspect of singing technique. It should also be borne in mind that a curving line or phrase-mark (similar to a slur mark) is the usual way, in vocal notation, of indicating to the singer that the vowel sound of a word should be carried over or ligatured upon two or more consecutive notes (as in a roulade), and that in such usage legato and not slurring is always intended unless the slur is specifically indicated.

Although portamento (in the sense of slurring) continued to be widely used in popular music, it was disapproved of for operatic singing by many critics in the 1920s and 1930s as a sign of either poor technique, or of bad taste, a mark of cheap sentimentalism or showiness. This is not valid criticism of a performer when portamento is explicitly specified in the score or is otherwise appropriate. However, when there is no such specification, the singer is expected to be able to move crisply from note to note without any slurring or &quot;scooping&quot;.

<doc id="730958" wikidata="Q217208" url="?curid=730958" title="Julian year (astronomy)">
<text>In astronomy, a Julian year (symbol: a or aj) is a unit of measurement of time defined as exactly 365.25 days of SI seconds each. The length of the Julian year is the average length of the year in the Julian calendar that was used in Western societies until the adoption of the Gregorian Calendar, and from which the unit is named. Nevertheless, because astronomical Julian years are measuring duration rather than designating dates, this Julian year does not correspond to years in the Julian calendar or any other calendar. Nor does it correspond to the many other ways of defining a year.

== Usage ==
The Julian year is not a unit of measurement in the International System of Units (SI), but it is recognized by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) as a non-SI unit for use in astronomy. Before 1984, both the Julian year and the mean tropical year were used by astronomers. In 1898, Simon Newcomb used both in his &quot;Tables of the Sun&quot; in the form of the Julian century (36 525 days) and the &quot;solar century&quot; ( days), a rounded form of 100 mean tropical years of  days each according to Newcomb. However, the mean tropical year is not suitable as a unit of measurement because it varies from year to year by a small amount,  days according to Newcomb. In contrast, the Julian year is defined in terms of the SI unit one second, so is as accurate as that unit and is constant. It approximates both the sidereal year and the tropical year to about ±0.008 days. The Julian year is the basis of the definition of the light-year as a unit of measurement of distance.

==Epochs==
In astronomy, an &quot;epoch&quot; specifies a precise moment in time. The positions of celestial objects and events, as measured from Earth, change over time, so when measuring or predicting celestial positions, the epoch to which they pertain must be specified. A new standard epoch is chosen about every 50 years.

The standard epoch in use today is &quot;Julian epoch J2000.0&quot;. It is exactly 12:00 TT (close to but not exactly Greenwich mean noon) on in the Gregorian (&quot;not&quot; Julian) calendar. &quot;Julian&quot; within its name indicates that other Julian epochs can be a number of Julian years of 365.25 days each before or after J2000.0. For example, the future epoch J2100.0 will be exactly 36,525 days (one Julian century) from J2000.0 at 12:00 TT on (the dates will still agree because the Gregorian century 2000–2100 will have the same number of days as a Julian century).

Because Julian years are not exactly the same length as years on the Gregorian calendar, astronomical epochs will diverge noticeably from the Gregorian calendar in a few hundred years. For example, in the next 1000 years, seven days will be dropped from the Gregorian calendar but not from 1000 Julian years, so J3000.0 will be .

== Julian calendar distinguished ==
The &quot;Julian year&quot;, being a uniform measure of duration, should not be confused with the variable length historical years in the Julian calendar. An astronomical Julian year is never individually numbered. When not using Julian day numbers (&quot;see next&quot; §), astronomers follow the same conventional calendars that are accepted in the world community: They use the Gregorian calendar for events since its introduction on (or later, depending on country), and the Julian calendar for events before that date, and occasionally other, local calendars when appropriate for a given publication.

== Julian day distinguished ==
A &quot;Julian year&quot; should not be confused with the &quot;Julian day&quot;, which is also used in astronomy (more properly called the &quot;Julian day number&quot; or &quot;JDN&quot;). The JDN uniquely specifies a place in time, without becoming bogged down in its date-in-month, week, month, or year in any particular calendar. Despite the similarity of names, there is almost no connection between the &quot;Julian day numbers&quot; and &quot;Julian years&quot;.

The Julian day number is a simplified time-keeping system originally intended to ease calculation with historical dates which involve a diversity of local, idiosyncratic calendars. It was adopted by astronomers in the mid-1800s, and identifies each date as the integer number of days that have elapsed since a reference date (&quot;epoch&quot;), chosen to precede most, if not all, historical records. A specific time within a day, always using UTC, is specified via a decimal fraction.

<text>Rosemary Willis (born 1953) was a close witness during the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy.

Clearly seen in the Zapruder film at the start of the assassination wearing a white, hooded coat and a red skirt, while she trotted in the Dealey Plaza grass located to the presidential limousine&#x27;s left, she runs southwestward and parallel with the limousine, which she faces for a short time when the limousine is to her direct right.

At circa Zapruder film frames 164-171 (hereafter &quot;Z-164-171&quot;), she starts to slow down, then she stops running and, simultaneous with her slowing/stopping, she slightly turns her level-facing head to end up looking towards the southeast corner of the Texas School Book Depository. Willis stated she stopped because she heard a loud noise that attracted her attention.

Immediately after the upright-sitting President John F. Kennedy is first hidden at frame 207 by the &quot;Stemmons Freeway&quot; traffic sign in the Zapruder film, Willis suddenly, and beginning at Z-214, snaps her head very rapidly 90 to 100 degrees westward (completely away from the Depository southeast corner) within 0.16 second to then face Abraham Zapruder and the grassy knoll by Z-217.

Precisely 0.60 second after starting her westward head snap towards Zapruder and the grassy knoll, President Kennedy&#x27;s head then emerges back into the Zapruder film view at Z-225. At that same instant, he was still sitting upright, and his facial expressions and arms were already clearly displaying his physical movements and neuro-physical sensed reactions to his already having been impacted by a bullet sometime prior to Z-225.

In 1978, Willis was interviewed by investigators for the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) and she stated that she heard three shots during the assassination.

She also stated to the HSCA that while she was still facing the grassy knoll picket fence, she was attracted to view the quick movement of a person on the grassy knoll who quickly dropped down behind a &quot;wall&quot;, out of her view.

Willis was also documented in the HSCA report stating that her father, military veteran Phillip Willis, became very upset when the Dallas policemen, sheriffs, and detectives ran away from the grassy knoll, after they had first quickly run onto the grassy knoll where he thought a shot had been fired from.

Rosemary&#x27;s sister, Linda Willis, stated to assassination researcher and author Richard Trask (&quot;Pictures of the Pain&quot; 1994) that after the assassination, she and Rosemary also saw someone find a piece of the president&#x27;s head that had landed in the grass in a location at least to the left of the president.

After the assassination, Willis, along with her sister, father, and her mother (Marilyn), were present at the Kodak photographic laboratory in Dallas getting her father&#x27;s assassination-related photo slides developed. They were there at the same time as when the Zapruder film was also first developed and first shown to approximately nineteen persons.

Even though she was a very close assassination witness, Rosemary was never interviewed by any Warren Commission investigators.

Rosemary Willis became in the 1970s a school teacher in Dallas.

<text>Tappara (; Finnish for &quot;Battle axe&quot;) is a Finnish professional ice hockey team playing in the SM-liiga. They play at &quot;Nokia Arena&quot; in Tampere, Finland. The team has won 20 Finnish league championships, which makes them the most successful club in Finland. The team continued the traditions of the Tammerfors Bollklub.

==History==

===Early days and the transition from TBK to Tappara===
The predecessor of Tappara TBK (Tammerfors Bollklubb) was established in 1932 by the Tampere Swedish School (Tampereen Ruotsalainen Yhteiskoulu) as its own sports club. After winning the Finnish championship in 1953, 1954 and 1955. In 1955, the TBK Ice-hockey department founded Tappara as its new club to make it more accessible to non-Swedish locals and give it opportunity to grow as a club, at the same time the Ice-Hockey division of TBK stopped as an ice hockey club at the highest competitive level. Most of the players transferred from TBK to Tappara. Tappara used TBK&#x27;s colors and got their place in the top league. Tappara played its first official game in the same year, 1955. The transition was led by team president Harry Lindblad.

===First period of success as Tappara (1956–1964)===

Tappara went on to win three championships (1959, 1961, and 1964), three second places (1958, 1960, and 1963), and three third places (1956, 1957, and 1962) in just nine years. Their winning streak was followed by a more silent period, with Tappara even playing one season (1965–1966) at the second highest level, gaining immediate promotion back to the top flight. In 1965, an indoor arena Tampereen jäähalli was built in Hakametsä to be the home arena of Tappara and their local rivals, Ilves and Koo-Vee. 1965 World Ice Hockey Championships were also held there in the same year.

===Second period of success (1975–1988)===
Tappara fans waited until the mid-seventies until Tappara started to be successful again, thanks to some legendary players such as the goalkeeper Antti Leppänen and the defender Pekka Marjamäki. The bronze medals in 1973 and silver medals in 1974 were followed by Finnish championship in 1975. This successful period was even longer than the first period of glory in the 1950s and early sixties. Tappara also won the Finnish championships in 1977, 1979, 1982, 1984, and the long streak ended by winning three consecutive championships in 1986–1988.

Many fans regard the Tappara team of the late 1980s – coached by Rauno Korpi – as their strongest of all time. Behind the senior players such as Timo Susi and Erkki Lehtonen, the likes of Teppo Numminen (a long-term defender in NHL) and Janne Ojanen (Tappara icon) led the way as new talented youngsters. In 1988, the Finland national team gained its first success by winning the Olympic silver medal in Calgary, and Tappara players formed a substantial part of the Finnish team. Tappara players, Erkki Lehtonen and Janne Ojanen, were the goal scorers for Finland in the decisive win against the Soviet Union.

===Recent days and success in mid-2010s===
During the 1990s, Tappara did not gain any notable success besides finishing third in the league in spring 1990. In 1992, the once so mighty team even had to fight for its place at the top level in relegation playoffs against Oulun Kärpät. A glimpse of glory was, however, achieved on the international level, as Tappara player Timo Jutila captained the Finnish national team to win the ice hockey world championship in 1995. In the early 2000s, Tappara played some good seasons, winning silver medals in both 2001 and 2002. In 2003 – to the surprise of many – Tappara won the Finnish championship, coached by Jukka Rautakorpi. After that, Tappara reached third place in the top league in 2008 but that achievement was followed by some difficult seasons. Tappara qualified only once to the playoffs between 2009 and 2012.

All changed in the 2012–13 season when Tappara made it to the finals for the first time since the 2003 championship, but lost to Ässät. In 2014 and 2015 Tappara came even closer to the title. Both final series were decided in a decisive seventh game and both of the games Kärpät won in overtime. In 2016, Tappara finally won the championship after beating HIFK in the finals. In 2017, Tappara won the regular season for the first time since 2002, advanced to the finals for the fifth time in a row and won another championship against KalPa. In 2018, Tappara reached the finals for a record-breaking sixth year in a row, but lost to Kärpät in 6 games. The great streak of final appearances came to an end in 2019 when HPK defeated Tappara in the semi-finals in six games. The medal streak continued however, as Tappara won the bronze medal game against HIFK.

==Home arena==

Tappara used to play their home games in Tampereen jäähalli since it was built in 1965. The local rival Ilves used the same arena. The arena was the first indoor arena in Finland and it is located in the neighborhood of Hakametsä. Originally the capacity was 10,200 spectators, but it has declined in various renovations over the years. In its current form, the arena accommodates 7,300 spectators. The old rink continues as a venue for indoor sports. The ice-hockey club KooVee and the junior teams of Tappara and Ilves will use this location for official games.

Currently, Tappara&#x27;s home arena is Nokia Arena. This new arena was built in the city center of Tampere on a covered rail yard and opened in December 2021. The arena has a capacity of 13,455 in hockey games. The arena was the main stage of Ice Hockey World Championships in both 2022 and 2023. Like the old arena, the new arena is also shared with local rivals Ilves. The arena is also a major venue for concerts.

<text>Jacob Collamer (January 8, 1791 – November 9, 1865) was an American politician from Vermont. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives, as Postmaster General in the cabinet of President Zachary Taylor, and as a U.S. Senator.

Born in Troy, New York, and raised in Burlington, Vermont, Collamer graduated from the University of Vermont, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1813. After service in the militia during the War of 1812, he became active as an attorney, first in Royalton, and then in Woodstock. Highly regarded in the legal profession, he became a respected prosecutor, legislator, and judge.

Elected to the House of Representatives in 1842, Collamer became a prominent Whig leader and advocate of the anti-slavery cause. President Taylor selected Collamer to serve as Postmaster General following the 1848 presidential election. Collamer served until shortly after Taylor&#x27;s death when he resigned to allow Taylor&#x27;s successor, Millard Fillmore, to name his own appointee.

Collamer was elected to the Senate as a Republican in 1855, shortly after the formation of the new party. He became a respected voice against slavery and a prominent supporter of the Lincoln administration during the American Civil War. An advocate of more stringent postwar Reconstruction measures than those that were favored by Lincoln and his successor, Andrew Johnson, Collamer advocated congressional control of the Reconstruction process. He died in Woodstock and was buried at River Street Cemetery in Woodstock.

==Early life==
Jacob Collamer was born in Troy, New York on January 8, 1791, the son of Samuel Collamer and Elizabeth (Van Arnum) Collamer, and his family moved to Burlington, Vermont in 1795. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Vermont in 1810, and after additional study, UVM later upgraded Collamer&#x27;s degree to Master of Arts. He studied law in St. Albans, Vermont with Asa Aldis, Asahel Langworthy, and Benjamin Swift. He then relocated to Randolph, Vermont, where he completed his legal studies with attorney William Nutting, and he was admitted to the bar in 1813. During the War of 1812, Collamer was appointed a deputy U.S. tax collector for the district that included Orange County, Vermont, and was responsible for collecting levies in support of the war effort.

==Military service==
He served as an officer in a Vermont Militia unit during the War of 1812. Appointed as an ensign in the 4th Regiment commanded by William Williams, he served first with an artillery unit on Vermont&#x27;s border with Canada. After promotion to first lieutenant, Collamer served as aide-de-camp to Brigadier General John French, commander of the militia&#x27;s 2nd Brigade, 4th Division.

French&#x27;s unit left Orange County for upstate New York in September 1814 in response to warnings of an imminent British invasion from Canada. When the brigade was crossing Lake Champlain en route to Plattsburgh, Collamer was sent ahead in a boat to inform Vermont Militia commander Samuel Strong that French&#x27;s troops were on their way. Collamer was fired on by American sentinels, but was uninjured. Strong informed Collamer that the Battle of Plattsburgh had taken place the day before, and the British had retreated, so French&#x27;s troops returned home.
==Early career==
In 1816, he moved to Royalton, Vermont, where he continued to practice law. He remained a resident of Royalton for 20 years, practicing law in partnership with James Barrett. Among the prospective attorneys who studied law under his supervision was Lyman Gibbons, who later served as a justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. Collamer also served in local offices, including Register of Probate, Windsor County State&#x27;s Attorney, and member of the Vermont House of Representatives. While serving in the House, Collamer was the main proponent of the legislation that created the Vermont Senate in 1836.

From 1833 to 1842 Collamer was an associate justice of the Supreme Court of Vermont, succeeding Nicholas Baylies. In 1836 he moved to Woodstock. From 1839 to 1845 Collamer was a Trustee of the University of Vermont.

==House of Representatives==
Elected to the US House of Representatives in 1842 as a Whig, Collamer served three terms, from
1843 to 1849. He opposed the extension of slavery, the Texas Annexation, and the Mexican–American War; supported high tariffs to help American manufacturers and received national recognition for his &quot;Wool and Woolens&quot; speech on tariffs.

Collamer was Chairman of the Committee on Manufactures (Twenty-eighth Congress) and the Committee on Public Lands (Thirtieth Congress).

==Postmaster General==
Collamer served as Postmaster General under President Zachary Taylor. Appointed at the start of the Taylor&#x27;s administration in 1849, he served until resigning in July 1850. Collamer resigned shortly after Taylor&#x27;s death to enable President Millard Fillmore to name his own appointee.

As Postmaster General, Collamer was criticized by Whig partisans of the spoils system because he was reluctant to remove local Democratic postmasters &quot;en masse&quot; so they could be replaced by Whigs. Among his accomplishments was the introduction of a permanent system for using postage stamps; Collamer sent the first letter using one, a note addressed to his brother in Barre, Vermont in which he recommended saving the stamp because if the system worked, it might be valuable to collectors.

==Beyond politics==
Upon returning to Vermont, Collamer was appointed a judge of the newly created state Circuit Court, where he served until 1854. He was succeeded on the bench by Abel Underwood, who served until the state Circuit Court was abolished in an 1857 court reorganization.

Collamer was a longtime trustee of and lecturer at the Vermont Medical College in Woodstock and served as President of the Board of Trustees.

==Senator==
In 1855 Collamer was elected to the Senate as a conservative, anti-slavery Republican. In his first term, Collamer was Chairman of the Committee on Engrossed Bills (Thirty-fourth Congress).

In 1856, Collamer received several votes for Vice President at the Republican National Convention.

In the Senate, he defended his positions vigorously even when he was in the minority. When the Committee on Territories, chaired by Stephen A. Douglas, recommended passage of the Crittenden Amendment, which proposed resubmitting for popular vote the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution for Kansas, Collamer and James R. Doolittle of Wisconsin refused to vote in favor but instead crafted a persuasive minority report explaining their opposition.

Collamer also represented the minority view in June 1860, when the select committee chaired by James Murray Mason issued its report on John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harper&#x27;s Ferry. Mason argued that Brown&#x27;s raid was the work of an organized abolitionist movement, which needed to be curtailed with federal authority. Collamer and Doolittle countered that Brown and his followers had been caught and punished and that further government action was not necessary.

Collamer&#x27;s years on the bench helped develop his reputation as the best lawyer in the Senate. His colleagues were known to pay close attention to his remarks on the Senate floor even though he spoke infrequently and even then too quietly to reach the entire chamber or the galleries. Charles Sumner referred to Collamer as the &quot;Green-Mountain Socrates&quot; and called him the wisest and best balanced statesman of his time.

===Civil War===
At the 1860 Republican National Convention, Collamer received the favorite son votes of Vermont&#x27;s delegates and withdrew after the first ballot. Reelected to the Senate in 1861, he served until his death.

In 1861, Collamer authored the bill to invest the President with new war powers and give Congressional approval to the war measures that Abraham Lincoln had taken under his own authority at the start of his administration.

Collamer was the lead senator of the nine Republicans who visited Lincoln in 1862 to argue for change in the composition of his cabinet by persuading him to replace his Secretary of State, William Henry Seward. Having been encouraged to confront Lincoln by claims of cabinet disharmony from Lincoln&#x27;s Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase, the senators changed their minds during the meeting after Chase was maneuvered by Lincoln into backtracking on his initial argument.

Again a member of the majority once the Democrats from the southern states left the Senate during the war, Collamer was Chairman of the Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads (Thirty-seventh to Thirty-ninth Congresses) and the Committee on the Library (Thirty-eighth and Thirty-ninth Congresses).

After the war, Collamer opposed the Reconstruction of plans of Presidents Lincoln and Andrew Johnson and was an advocate of Congressional control over the process of readmitting former Confederate states to the Union.

==Death==
Collamer died at his home in Woodstock on November 9, 1865 and was buried in Woodstock&#x27;s River Street Cemetery.

==Awards and honors==
Collamer received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Vermont in 1850 and Dartmouth College in 1855.

In 1881, the state of Vermont donated a marble statue of Collamer created by Preston Powers to the U.S. Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection. Each state is represented by two statues, and Vermont&#x27;s are likenesses of Collamer and Ethan Allen.

==Family==
In 1817, Collamer married Mary Stone, who died in 1870. Their children included Elisabeth, Harriet, Mary, Edward, Ellen, Frances, and William.

==Home==
Collamer&#x27;s home at 40 Elm Street in Woodstock is part of the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park&#x27;s Civil War Home Front Walking Tour.

<doc id="730983" wikidata="Q998803" url="?curid=730983" title="Tumor lysis syndrome">
<text>Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a group of metabolic abnormalities that can occur as a complication from the treatment of cancer, where large amounts of tumor cells are killed off (lysed) from the treatment, releasing their contents into the bloodstream. This occurs most commonly after the treatment of lymphomas and leukemias and in particular when treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This is a potentially fatal complication and people at an increased risk for TLS should be closely monitored while receiving chemotherapy and should receive preventive measures and treatments as necessary. TLS can also occur on its own (while not being treated with chemotherapy) although this is less common.

Tumor lysis syndrome is characterized by high blood potassium (hyperkalemia), high blood phosphate (hyperphosphatemia), low blood calcium (hypocalcemia), high blood uric acid (hyperuricemia), and higher than normal levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN). These changes in blood electrolytes and metabolites are a result of the release of cellular contents of dying cells into the bloodstream. In this respect, TLS is analogous to rhabdomyolysis, with comparable mechanism and blood chemistry effects but with different cause. In TLS, the breakdown occurs after cytotoxic therapy or from cancers with high cell turnover and tumor proliferation rates. The metabolic abnormalities seen in tumor lysis syndrome can ultimately result in serious complications such as acute uric acid nephropathy, acute kidney failure, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, and death.

==Signs and symptoms==
* Hyperkalemia. Potassium is mainly an intracellular ion. High turnover of tumor cells leads to spill of potassium into the blood. Symptoms usually do not manifest until levels are high (&gt; 6.5 mmol/L) [normal 3.5–5.0 mmol/L] and they include
** palpitations, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and arrhythmias (can be fatal)
** muscle weakness or paralysis
* Hyperphosphatemia. Like potassium, phosphates are also predominantly intracellular. Hyperphosphatemia causes acute kidney injury in tumor lysis syndrome, because of deposition of calcium phosphate crystals in the kidney parenchyma.
* Hypocalcemia. Because of the hyperphosphatemia, calcium is precipitated to form calcium phosphate, leading to hypocalcemia. Symptoms of hypocalcemia include (but are not limited to):
** tetany
** paresthesias
** muscle cramps
** muscle weakness
** sudden changes in mental status, including emotional lability
** Parkinsonian (extrapyramidal) movement disorders
** papilledema
* Hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria. Massive cell death and nuclear breakdown generates large quantities of nucleic acids. Of these, the purines (adenine and guanine) are converted to uric acid via the purine degradation pathway and excreted in the urine. However, at the high concentrations of uric acid generated by tumor lysis, uric acid is apt to precipitate as monosodium urate crystals.
Acute uric acid nephropathy (AUAN) due to hyperuricosuria has been a dominant cause of acute kidney failure, but with the advent of effective treatments for hyperuricosuria, AUAN has become a less common cause than hyperphosphatemia. Two common conditions related to excess uric acid, gout and uric acid nephrolithiasis, are not features of tumor lysis syndrome.
* Lactic acidosis.
* Pretreatment spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome. This entity is associated with acute kidney failure due to uric acid nephropathy prior to the institution of chemotherapy and is largely associated with lymphoma and leukemia. The important distinction between this syndrome and the post-chemotherapy syndrome is that spontaneous TLS is not associated with hyperphosphatemia. One suggestion for the reason of this is that the high cell turnover rate leads to high uric acid levels through nucleobase turnover but the tumor reuses the released phosphate for growth of new tumor cells. In post-chemotherapy TLS, tumor cells are destroyed and no new tumor cells are being synthesized. TLS is most common during cytotoxic treatment of hematologic neoplasms.

==Risk factors==
Risk factors for tumor lysis syndrome depend on several different characteristics of the patient, the type of cancer, and the type of chemotherapy used.

Tumor characteristics: Tumors with a high cell turnover rate, rapid growth rate, and high tumor bulk tend to be more associated with the development of tumor lysis syndrome. The most common tumors associated with this syndrome are poorly differentiated lymphomas (such as Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma), other Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Other cancers (such as melanoma) have also been associated with TLS but are less common.

Patient characteristics: Certain patient-related factors can affect the development of clinical tumor lysis syndrome. These factors include elevated baseline serum creatinine, kidney failure, dehydration, and other issues affecting urinary flow or the acidity of urine.

Chemotherapy characteristics: Chemo-sensitive tumors, such as lymphomas, carry a higher risk for the development of tumor lysis syndrome. Those tumors that are more responsive to a chemotherapy agent carry a higher TLS risk. Usually, the precipitating medication regimen includes combination chemotherapy, but TLS can be triggered in cancer patients by steroid treatment alone, and sometimes without any treatment—in this case the condition is referred to as &quot;spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome&quot;.

==Diagnosis==
TLS should be suspected in people with large tumor burden who develop acute kidney failure along with hyperuricemia (&gt; 15 mg/dL) or hyperphosphatemia (&gt; 8 mg/dL). (Most other acute kidney failure occurs with uric acid &lt; 12 mg/dL and phosphate &lt; 6 mg/dL). Acute uric acid nephropathy is associated with little or no urine output. The urinalysis may show uric acid crystals or amorphous urates. The hypersecretion of uric acid can be detected with a high urine uric acid - creatinine ratio &gt; 1.0, compared to a value of 0.6–0.7 for most other causes of acute kidney failure.

===Cairo-Bishop definition===

In 2004, Cairo and Bishop defined a classification system for tumor lysis syndrome.
* Laboratory tumor lysis syndrome: abnormality in two or more of the following, occurring within three days before or seven days after chemotherapy.
** uric acid &gt; 8 mg/dL or 25% increase
** potassium &gt; 6 meq/L or 25% increase
** phosphate &gt; 4.5 mg/dL or 25% increase
** calcium &lt; 7 mg/dL or 25% decrease
* Clinical tumor lysis syndrome: laboratory tumor lysis syndrome plus one or more of the following:
** increased serum creatinine (1.5 times upper limit of normal)
** cardiac arrhythmia or sudden death
** seizure

A grading scale (0–5) is used depending on the presence of lab TLS, serum creatinine, arrhythmias, or seizures.

===Howard definition===
In 2011, Howard proposed a refinement of the standard Cairo-Bishop definition of TLS accounting for 2 limitations:
* Two or more electrolyte laboratory abnormalities must be present simultaneously to be considered related to TLS. In fact, some patients may present with one abnormality, but later another one may develop that is unrelated to the TLS (e.g., hypocalcemia associated with sepsis).
* A 25% change from baseline should not be considered a criterion since such increases are rarely clinically important unless the value is already outside the normal range.

Moreover, any symptomatic hypocalcemia should constitute clinical TLS.

==Prevention==
It is important to prevent life-threatening manifestations associated with TLS which include acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia (which may cause cardiac arrhythmias), and or hypocalcemia (which may cause cardiac arrhythmias and neuromuscular irritability).

Acute kidney injury: Patients at risk for developing TLS (e.g. patients about to receive chemotherapy for a cancer with a high cell turnover rate, especially lymphomas and leukemias) should receive appropriate intravenous hydration in order to improve blood flow to the kidneys, maximize urine output, and ultimately prevent precipitation of uric acid crystals that can lead to acute kidney injury. A diuretic may also be indicated to further increase urine output in addition to intravenous hydration. Another approach to prevent damage to the kidneys is to prevent the buildup of uric acid during TLS, and this can be accomplished with use of allopurinol or rasburicase. Allopurinol (a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, which inhibits uric acid production) works by preventing the formation of uric acid following tumor cell lysis. Rasburicase is a synthetic urate oxidase enzyme and acts by degrading uric acid. No current guidelines endorse the concurrent use of allopurinol and rasburicase. It is not recommended to alkalinize urine in the management of TLS: although doing so increases the solubility of urste, it also creates calcium phosphate crystals.

Hyperkalemia: Monitoring potassium levels in the blood frequently and cardiac monitoring (given the risk of cardiac arrhythmias) are important components in the prevention of adverse consequences in TLS. Other strategies, such as limiting oral intake of potassium, and excreting potassium through the gastrointestinal tract using agents such as oral sodium polystyrene sulfonate, can be beneficial. Insulin therapy (in conjunction with glucose administration) as well as beta-receptor agonists (such as albuterol) can also be used, but are temporary interventions, and potassium is not excreted from the body. Hemodialysis and hemofiltration can also be used as options to remove potassium from the bloodstream when hyperkalemia is present.

Hypocalcemia: Hyperphosphatemia is a common finding in TLS, and high phosphorus levels can in turn contribute to hypocalcemia. Therefore, phosphate binders may be beneficial in preventing this form of hypocalcemia.

==Treatment==

Treatment is first targeted at the specific metabolic disorder.

In general, rasburicase and hydration are the mainstays of treatment in patients with clinical evidence of tumor lysis syndrome. A loop diuretic may also be indicated to maintain appropriate production of urine by the kidneys. Further treatment is targeted towards the specific metabolic abnormalities present in patients with TLS (see &quot;main articles&quot; linked above). Mild hyperkalemia without symptoms can be treated with a loop diuretic and sodium polystyrene sulfonate, while a temporizing agent such as rapid acting insulin (in conjunction with glucose) and an agent to stabilize cardiac membranes such as calcium carbonate may be given in cases of severe hyperkalemia. Concerning symptoms related to hypocalcemia (e.g. seizures) in TLS patients can be treated with calcium gluconate. Tumor lysis patients may ultimately also require renal replacement therapy such as through hemodialysis if indicated.

==Prognosis==
The rate of mortality from tumor lysis syndrome may vary widely depending on the type of underlying malignancy. However, the occurrence of acute kidney injury is concerning given the high mortality that is generally associated with it.

<text>Trevor Sargent (born 26 July 1960) is a minister of the Church of Ireland and a former Irish Green Party politician who served as a Minister of State from 2007 to 2010 and Leader of the Green Party from 2001 to 2007. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin North constituency from 1992 to 2011.

==Career==
===Teaching career===
Sargent trained as a primary school teacher in the Church of Ireland College of Education. In 1981, he started teaching in the Model School, Dunmanway, County Cork. In 1983, he was appointed Principal of St George&#x27;s National School, Balbriggan, County Dublin. He is a fluent Irish speaker.

===Local politics===
A committed environmentalist since the early 1980s, Trevor Sargent first became politically active when he joined the Green Party in 1982. However, it was not until 1989 that the Green Party made an impact in national politics, winning its first seat in Dáil Éireann through Roger Garland. In that same year, Sargent stood for in the European Parliament election in Dublin, but was unsuccessful. Two years later in 1991, he was elected to Dublin County Council.

At a meeting of the council, he waved a cheque he had received in the post from a builder who was seeking to rezone land for a housing development. When he asked the other members whether any of them had also received cheques, he was assaulted by a number of his fellow councillors. Sargent alleged that Fianna Fáil Councillor Don Lydon put him in a headlock and attempted to snatch the cheque from him. This is one of the incidents which eventually led to the creation of the Mahon Tribunal to look into planning matters in Dublin County Council.

===Dáil Éireann===
At the 1992 general election, he was elected to Dáil Éireann and retained his seat at the 1997, 2002 and 2007 general elections, topping the poll in 2002. Having been elected to the Dáil, he resigned his county council seat in keeping with Green Party policy on dual mandates. This became a legal requirement in 2003. Having been the only Green Party member of the Dáil between 1992 and 1997, Sargent was joined in 1997 by John Gormley, and in 2002 by an additional four Green Party TDs.

At a special Leadership Convention in Kilkenny on 6 October 2001, Sargent was elected the first official leader of the Green Party. He was re-elected to this position in 2003 and again in 2005. Ahead of the 2007 general election, Sargent had committed that he would not lead the party into government with Fianna Fáil. After the election, the Green Party entered talks on forming a coalition government with Fianna Fáil. A programme for government was agreed after over a week of negotiations, which was ratified by 86% by a special conference of the Green Party membership, following passionate endorsements of the deal by Sargent and the rest of the Green leadership. However, Sargent announced that he would resign his position as leader of the party and would not accept a seat in the cabinet. He was succeeded as leader by John Gormley.

The 27th Government of Ireland led by Bertie Ahern was formed on 14 June 2007, with the Greens given two seats at cabinet. On 20 June 2007, Sargent was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with responsibility for Food and Horticulture. He was re-appointed by the 28th Government of Ireland when Brian Cowen succeeded Ahern as Taoiseach on 7 May 2008. When Cowen reduced the number of Ministers of State on 22 April 2009, Sargent was given the additional post of Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for Food Safety.

On 23 February 2010, he resigned as a Minister of State when he admitted unlawfully contacting Gardaí about a criminal case involving a constituent who had been assaulted. He lost his seat at the 2011 general election, along with all the other Green Party TDs.

===After politics===
In March 2012, he published his debut book, &quot;Trevor&#x27;s Kitchen Garden&quot;, a week-by-week manual and diary in book form about growing food in a small garden, based on his blog of the same name.

Sargent was trained as a Church of Ireland cleric, at the Church of Ireland Theological Institute, and also studied for a master&#x27;s degree in theology from Trinity College Dublin. In August 2017 he was ordained a deacon in the Church of Ireland Diocese of Cashel and Ossory. He was ordained priest in Christchurch Cathedral, Waterford city on 8 September 2018.

==Media==
Sargent has made many appearances on the Irish-language TV channel TG4. He was a guest judge on TG4&#x27;s Feirm Factor and a guest gardener for Season 2 of Garrai Glas in 2011. He also made an appearance on &quot;The Podge and Rodge Show&quot; on 10 April 2006.

==Personal life==
Sargent lived in Balbriggan for 30 years. In 1987 he helped found Sonairte, The National Ecology Centre, in Laytown, County Meath and served as chairman. He has been active in GIY Ireland. In 1998, he married Heidi Bedell, a former local councilor, and one-time coordinator of the Green Party; they divorced in 2013. Sargent lived with his second wife, Aine Neville, in Tacumshin, County Wexford, where they developed an organic horticulture enterprise. They were also members of the Wexford Naturalists&#x27; field club.
