<text>Isopoda is an order of crustaceans. Members of this group are called isopods and include both aquatic species and terrestrial species such as woodlice. All have rigid, segmented exoskeletons, two pairs of antennae, seven pairs of jointed limbs on the thorax, and five pairs of branching appendages on the abdomen that are used in respiration. Females brood their young in a pouch under their thorax called the marsupium. 

Isopods have various feeding methods: some eat dead or decaying plant and animal matter, others are grazers or filter feeders, a few are predators, and some are internal or external parasites, mostly of fish. Aquatic species mostly live on the seabed or the bottom of freshwater bodies of water, but some taxa can swim for short distance. Terrestrial forms move around by crawling and tend to be found in cool, moist places. Some species are able to roll themselves into a ball as a defense mechanism or to conserve moisture like species in the family Armadillididae, the pillbugs. 

There are over 10,000 identified species of isopod worldwide, with around 4,500 species found in marine environments, mostly on the seabed, 500 species in fresh water, and another 5,000 species on land. The order is divided into eleven suborders. The fossil record of isopods dates back to the Carboniferous period (in the Pennsylvanian epoch), at least 300 million years ago, when isopods lived in shallow seas. The name &quot;Isopoda&quot; is derived from the Greek roots (from , meaning &quot;equal&quot;) and (from , the stem of , meaning &quot;foot&quot;).

==Description==
Classified within the arthropods, isopods have a chitinous exoskeleton and jointed limbs. Isopods are typically flattened dorsoventrally (broader than they are deep), although many species deviate from this rule, particularly parasitic forms, and those living in the deep sea or in ground water habitats. Their colour may vary, from grey to white, or in some cases red, green, or brown. Isopods vary in size, ranging from some Microcerberidae species of just to the deep sea giant isopod &quot;Bathynomus&quot; spp. of nearly . Giant isopods lack an obvious carapace (shell), which is reduced to a &quot;cephalic shield&quot; covering only the head. This means that the gill-like structures, which in other related groups are protected by the carapace, are instead found on specialised limbs on the abdomen. The dorsal (upper) surface of the animal is covered by a series of overlapping, articulated plates which give protection while also providing flexibility. The isopod body plan consists of a head (cephalon), a thorax (pereon) with seven segments (pereonites), and an abdomen (pleon) with six segments (pleonites), some of which may be fused. The head is fused with the first segment of the thorax to form the cephalon. There are two pairs of unbranched antennae, the first pair being vestigial in land-dwelling species. The eyes are compound and unstalked and the mouthparts include a pair of maxillipeds and a pair of mandibles (jaws) with palps (segmented appendages with sensory functions) and lacinia mobilis (spine-like movable appendages).

The seven free segments of the thorax each bear a pair of unbranched pereopods (limbs). In most species these are used for locomotion and are of much the same size, morphology and orientation, giving the order its name &quot;Isopoda&quot;, from the Greek &quot;equal foot&quot;. In a few species, the front pair are modified into gnathopods with clawed, gripping terminal segments. The pereopods are not used in respiration, as are the equivalent limbs in amphipods, but the coxae (first segments) are fused to the tergites (dorsal plates) to form epimera (side plates). In mature females, some or all of the limbs have appendages known as oostegites which fold underneath the thorax and form a brood chamber for the eggs. In males, the gonopores (genital openings) are on the ventral surface of segment eight and in the females, they are in a similar position on segment six.

One or more of the abdominal segments, starting with the sixth segment, is fused to the telson (terminal section) to form a rigid pleotelson. The first five abdominal segments each bear a pair of biramous (branching in two) pleopods (lamellar structures which serve the function of gas exchange, and in aquatic species serve as gills and propulsion), and the last segment bears a pair of biramous uropods (posterior limbs). In males, the second pair of pleopods, and sometimes also the first, are modified for use in transferring sperm. The endopods (inner branches of the pleopods) are modified into structures with thin, permeable cuticles (flexible outer coverings) which act as gills for gas exchange. In some terrestrial isopods, these resemble lungs.

==Diversity and classification==

Isopods belong to the larger group Peracarida, which are united by the presence of a special chamber under the thorax for brooding eggs. They have a cosmopolitan distribution and over 10,000 species of isopod, classified into 11 suborders, have been described worldwide. Around 4,500 species are found in marine environments, mostly on the sea floor. About 500 species are found in fresh water and another 5,000 species are the terrestrial woodlice, which form the suborder Oniscidea. In the deep sea, members of the suborder Asellota predominate, to the near exclusion of all other isopods, having undergone a large adaptive radiation in that environment. The largest isopod is in the genus &quot;Bathynomus&quot; and some large species are fished commercially for human food in Mexico, Japan and Hawaii.

Some isopod groups have evolved a parasitic lifestyle, particularly as external parasites of fish. They can damage or kill their hosts and can cause significant economic loss to commercial fisheries. In reef aquariums, parasitic isopods can become a pest, endangering the fish and possibly injuring the aquarium keeper. Some members of the family Cirolanidae suck the blood of fish, and others, in the family Aegidae, consume the blood, fins, tail and flesh and can kill the fish in the process.

The World Marine, Freshwater and Terrestrial Isopod Crustaceans database subdivides the order into eleven suborders:

* Asellota – This suborder contains the superfamily Aselloidea, a group that contains most of the freshwater isopods in the northern hemisphere, and the superfamilies Stenetrioidea, Gnathostenetroidoidea and Janiroidea, which are mostly marine. The latter superfamily, Janiroidea, has a massive radiation of deepsea families, many of which have taken bizarre forms.
* Calabozoida – A small suborder consisting of two marine species in the family Calabozoidae and one freshwater species in the family Brasileirinidae which is found in subterranean locations.
* Cymothoida – Chiefly marine isopods with over 2,700 species. Members are mostly carnivorous or parasitic. Includes the family Gnathiidae, the juveniles of which are parasitic on fishes. The previously recognised suborder Epicaridea is included as two superfamilies within this suborder and Cymothoida now includes part of the formerly recognised suborder Flabellifera. Also includes the former suborder Anthuridea, a group of worm-like isopods with very long bodies.
* Limnoriidea – Mainly tropical isopods, some of which are herbivorous.
* Microcerberidea – Tiny, worm-like isopods that live between particles on the bed of freshwater and shallow marine habitats.
*Oniscidea – Semi-terrestrial and terrestrial isopods fully adapted for life on land. There are over 4,000 species of woodlice inhabiting forests, mountains, deserts and the littoral zone.
* Phoratopidea – A single marine species, &quot;Phoratopus remex&quot;, which warrants its own suborder because of its unique characteristics.
* Phreatoicidea – Small suborder of freshwater isopods resembling amphipods, limited to South Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand.
* Sphaeromatidea – Benthic isopods mostly from the southern hemisphere with respiratory pleopods inside a branchial chamber. This suborder now includes part of the formerly recognised suborder Flabellifera.
* Tainisopidea – Freshwater isopods in a &quot;relictual environment&quot;.
* Valvifera – A large group of benthic, marine isopods with respiratory pleopods inside a branchial chamber under the abdomen.

==Evolutionary history==
Isopods first appeared in the fossil record during the Carboniferous period of the Paleozoic some 300 million years ago. They were primitive, short-tailed members of the suborder Phreatoicidea. At that time, Phreatoicideans were marine organisms with a cosmopolitan distribution. Nowadays, the members of this formerly widespread suborder form relic populations in freshwater environments in South Africa, India and Oceania, the greatest number of species being in Tasmania. Other primitive, short-tailed suborders include Asellota, Microcerberidea, Calabozoidea and the terrestrial Oniscidea.

The short-tailed isopods have a short pleotelson and terminal, stylus-like uropods and have a sedentary lifestyle on or under the sediment on the seabed. The long-tailed isopods have a long pleotelson and broad lateral uropods which can be used in swimming. They are much more active and can launch themselves off the seabed and swim for short distances. The more advanced long-tailed isopods are mostly endemic to the southern hemisphere and may have radiated on the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana soon after it broke away from Laurasia 200 million years ago. The short-tailed forms may have been driven from the shallow seas in which they lived by increased predatory pressure from marine fish, their main predators. The development of the long-tailed forms may also have provided competition that helped force the short-tailed forms into refugia. The latter are now restricted to environments such as the deep sea, freshwater, groundwater and dry land. Isopods in the suborder Asellota are by far the most species-rich group of deep sea isopods.

==Locomotion==
Unlike the amphipods, marine and freshwater isopods are entirely benthic. This gives them little chance to disperse to new regions and may explain why so many species are endemic to restricted ranges. Crawling is the primary means of locomotion, and some species bore into the seabed, the ground or timber structures. Some members of the families Sphaeromatidae, Idoteidae and Munnopsidae are able to swim pretty well, and have their front three pairs of pleopods modified for this purpose, with their respiratory structures limited to the hind pleopods. Most terrestrial species are slow-moving and conceal themselves under objects or hide in crevices or under bark. The semi-terrestrial sea slaters (&quot;Ligia&quot; spp.) can run rapidly on land and many terrestrial species can roll themselves into a ball when threatened, a feature that has evolved independently in different groups and also in the marine sphaeromatids.

==Feeding and nutrition==
Isopods have a simple gut which lacks a midgut section; instead there are caeca connected to the back of the stomach in which absorption takes place. Food is sucked into the esophagus, a process enhanced in the blood-sucking parasitic species, and passed by peristalsis into the stomach, where the material is processed and filtered. The structure of the stomach varies, but in many species there is a dorsal groove into which indigestible material is channelled and a ventral part connected to the caeca where intracellular digestion and absorption take place. Indigestible material passes on through the hindgut and is eliminated through the anus, which is on the pleotelson.

Isopods are detritivores, browsers, carnivores (including predators and scavengers), parasites, and filter feeders, and may occupy one or more of these feeding niches. Only aquatic and marine species are known to be parasites or filter feeders. Some exhibit coprophagia and will also consume their own fecal pellets. Terrestrial species are in general herbivorous, with woodlice feeding on moss, bark, algae, fungi and decaying material. In marine isopods that feed on wood, cellulose is digested by enzymes secreted in the caeca. &quot;Limnoria lignorum&quot;, for example, bores into wood and additionally feeds on the mycelia of fungi attacking the timber, thus increasing the nitrogen in its diet. Land-based wood-borers mostly house symbiotic bacteria in the hindgut which aid in digesting cellulose. There are numerous adaptations to this simple gut, but these are mostly correlated with diet rather than by taxonomic group.

Parasitic species are mostly external parasites of fish or crustaceans and feed on blood. The larvae of the Gnathiidae family and adult cymothoidids have piercing and sucking mouthparts and clawed limbs adapted for clinging onto their hosts. In general, isopod parasites have diverse lifestyles and include &quot;Cancricepon elegans&quot;, found in the gill chambers of crabs; &quot;Athelges tenuicaudis&quot;, attached to the abdomen of hermit crabs; &quot;Crinoniscus equitans&quot; living inside the barnacle &quot;Balanus perforatus&quot;; cyproniscids, living inside ostracods and free-living isopods; bopyrids, living in the gill chambers or on the carapace of shrimps and crabs and causing a characteristic bulge which is even recognisable in some fossil crustaceans; and entoniscidae living inside some species of crab and shrimp. &quot;Cymothoa exigua&quot; is a parasite of the spotted rose snapper &quot;Lutjanus guttatus&quot; in the Gulf of California; it causes the tongue of the fish to atrophy and takes its place in what is believed to be the first instance discovered of a parasite functionally replacing a host structure in animals.

==Reproduction and development==
In most species, the sexes are separate and there is little sexual dimorphism, but a few species are hermaphroditic and some parasitic forms show large differences between the sexes. Some Cymothoidans are protandrous hermaphrodites, starting life as males and later changing sex, and some Anthuroideans are the reverse, being protogynous hermaphrodites that are born female. Some Gnathiidans males are sessile and live with a group of females. Males have a pair of penises, which may be fused in some species. The sperm is transferred to the female by the modified second pleopod which receives it from the penis and which is then inserted into a female gonopore. The sperm is stored in a special receptacle, a swelling on the oviduct close to the gonopore. Fertilisation only takes place when the eggs are shed soon after a moult, at which time a connection is established between the semen receptacle and the oviduct.

The eggs, which may number up to several hundred, are brooded by the female in the marsupium, a chamber formed by flat plates known as oostegites under the thorax. This is filled with water even in terrestrial species. The eggs hatch as mancae, a post-larval stage which resembles the adult except for the absence of the last pair of pereopods. The lack of a swimming phase in the life cycle is a limiting factor in isopod dispersal, and may be responsible for the high levels of endemism in the order. As adults, isopods differ from other crustaceans in that moulting occurs in two stages known as &quot;biphasic moulting&quot;. First they shed the exoskeleton from the posterior part of their body and later shed the anterior part. The giant Antarctic isopod &quot;Glyptonotus antarcticus&quot; is an exception, and moults in a single process.

==Terrestrial isopods==
The majority of crustaceans are aquatic and the isopods are one of the few groups of which some members now live on land. The only other crustaceans which include a small number of terrestrial species are amphipods (like sandhoppers) and decapods (crabs, shrimp, etc.). Terrestrial isopods play an important role in many tropical and temperate ecosystems by aiding in the decomposition of plant material through mechanical and chemical means, and by enhancing the activity of microbes. Macro-detritivores, including terrestrial isopods, are absent from arctic and sub-arctic regions, but have the potential to expand their range with increased temperatures in high latitudes.

The woodlice, suborder Oniscidea, are the most successful group of terrestrial crustaceans and show various adaptations for life on land. They are subject to evaporation, especially from their ventral area, and as they do not have a waxy cuticle, they need to conserve water, often living in a humid environment and sheltering under stones, bark, debris or leaf litter. Desert species, like Hemilepistus reaumuri, are usually nocturnal, spending the day in a burrow and emerging at night. Moisture is achieved through food sources or by drinking, and some species can form their paired uropodal appendages into a tube and funnel water from dewdrops onto their pleopods. In many taxa, the respiratory structures on the endopods are internal, with a spiracle and pseudotrachaea, which resemble lungs. In others, the endopod is folded inside the adjoining exopod (outer branch of the pleopod). Both these arrangements help to prevent evaporation from the respiratory surfaces.

Many species can roll themselves into a ball, a behaviour used in defense that also conserves moisture. Members of the families Ligiidae and Tylidae, commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters, are the least specialised of the woodlice for life on land. They inhabit the splash zone on rocky shores, jetties and pilings, may hide under debris washed up on the shore and can swim if immersed in water.

<doc id="724185" wikidata="Q994581" url="?curid=724185" title="Japan Air Lines Flight 350">
<text>Japan Air Lines Flight 350 was a McDonnell Douglas DC-8-61, registered &quot;JA8061&quot;, on a domestic scheduled passenger flight from Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, to Tokyo in Japan. The airplane crashed 9 February 1982 on approach to Haneda Airport in Tokyo Bay, resulting in 24 fatalities. Flight 350 was the first crash for Japan Air Lines in the 1980s. The investigation traced the cause of the crash to the deliberate actions of the captain.

==Flight==

The crew consisted of 35-year-old Captain Seiji Katagiri (片桐 清二 &quot;Katagiri Seiji&quot;), 33-year-old First Officer Yoshifumi Ishikawa, and 48-year-old flight engineer Yoshimi Ozaki. The cause of the crash was traced to Katagiri&#x27;s deliberate crashing of the plane.

One report states that the captain engaged the inboard engines&#x27; thrust-reversers in flight. Another report states that, during descent, Katagiri &quot;cancelled autopilot, pushed his controls forward and retarded the throttles to idle.&quot; Ishikawa and Ozaki worked to restrain Katagiri and regain control. Despite their efforts, the DC-8&#x27;s descent could not be completely checked and it touched down in shallow water 510 meters (1673 feet) short of the runway. During the crash, the cockpit section of the DC-8 separated from the rest of the fuselage and continued to travel for several meters before coming to a halt.

Among the 166 passengers and 8 crew, 24 died. Following the incident, Katagiri, one of the first people to take a rescue boat, told rescuers that he was an office worker to avoid being identified as the captain. Katagiri was later found to have paranoid schizophrenia prior to the incident, which resulted in his being ruled not guilty by reason of insanity. Investigators for the Japanese government attributed the incident to a lack of proper medical examinations which allowed Katagiri to fly.

Katagiri has since been released from psychiatric care.

After the crash, Japan Air Lines retired flight number 350.

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-8-61 registered as JA8061. It was manufactured by McDonnell Douglas in 1967 and in its 15 years of service, it had logged 36955 airframe hours. It was equipped with four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D-3B engines.

<text>Frozen Bubble is a free software clone of &quot;Puzzle Bobble&quot; for a variety of home and mobile systems.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Frozen Bubble&#x27;s&quot; protagonist is a penguin a la Tux, the mascot of Linux and popular feature in many free software/open-source games. In this game, Tux has to shoot colored frozen bubbles to form groups of the same color. Such groups disappear and the object is to clear the whole screen in this way before a bubble passes a line at the bottom. There is a single player mode and a multiplayer mode via Split screen, LAN and Internet. The game features 100 levels and includes a level editor.

==History==
In 2001, Guillaume Cottenceau started writing the original &quot;Frozen Bubble&quot; game in Perl while using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library. The music was made with FastTracker II by demoscener Matthias Le Bidan. Alexis Younes and Amaury Amblard-Ladurantie created the sprites and background graphic artwork with GIMP. The game is released under the GNU GPL-2.0-only. There is a version programmed in Perl and another one programmed in Java. The Perl-version runs on POSIX-compatible operating systems, e.g. Linux and the BSDs, while the Java-version runs on any operating system that supports Java.

The 2006 released version 2.0 introduced multiplayer play via LAN and Internet. Two players can also play on the same computer (Split screen). The chain reaction mode (where fallen bubbles will zoom back up to complete triplets, possibly causing more bubbles to fall and thus creating more combos) is also available in network mode as of Version 2.0, and greatly changes the mechanics of the game. Version 2.0 introduced artwork rendered with Blender.

The Frozen Bubble Team provides builds only for Linux distributions, while ports to other Unix-like operating systems (such as Mac OS X and the BSDs), Windows and mobile phones exist from the community.

==Reception and impact==
Linux For You ranked &quot;Frozen Bubble&quot; 5/5 in September 2009. &quot;Frozen Bubble&quot; was integrated in many Linux distributions and also ported to many platforms like macOS or PDAs. &quot;Frozen Bubble&quot; became also a quite popular free game which got distributed via several gaming outlets and aggregated significant download numbers over the years: chip.de counted 80,000, computerbild.de 93,000, Softpedia 18,000, and Softonic 350,000 downloads. It was also included on several cover disks of computer magazines, for instance MacAddict in February 2004 and Linux Format in March 2009.

===Awards===
* The Linux Game Tome&#x27;s &quot;Best Free Game Award&quot; and &quot;Best Sound/Music Award&quot; in 2003.
* Linux Journal&#x27;s &quot;Editors&#x27; Choice: Game&quot; in 2003.
* Linux Journal&#x27;s &quot;Readers&#x27; Choice: Favorite Linux Game&quot; in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2009, and 2010.
* Linux Format&#x27;s &quot;HotPick&quot; in February 2007.
* APC Mag&#x27;s honorable mention in their &quot;Top five free games&quot; in 2008.

<doc id="724210" wikidata="Q1658731" url="?curid=724210" title="Postoperative nausea and vomiting">
<text>Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is the phenomenon of nausea, vomiting, or retching experienced by a patient in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) or within 24 hours following a surgical procedure. PONV affects about 10% of the population undergoing general anaesthesia each year. PONV can be unpleasant and lead to a delay in mobilization and food, fluid, and medication intake following surgery.

==Cause==

Emetogenic drugs commonly used in anaesthesia include nitrous oxide, physostigmine, and opioids. The intravenous anaesthetic propofol is currently the least emetogenic general anaesthetic. These medications are thought to stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area is on the floor of the fourth ventricle and is effectively outside of the blood-brain barrier, which makes it incredibly sensitive to toxin and pharmacological stimulation. Several neurotransmitters are known, such as histamine, dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and the more recently discovered neurokinin-1 (substance P).

===Risk factors===
A 2008 study compared 121 Japanese patients who experienced PONV after being given the general anesthetic propofol to 790 people who were free of postoperative nausea after receiving it. Those with a G at both copies of rs1800497 were 1.6 times more likely to experience PONV within six hours of surgery compared to those with the AG or AA genotypes, but they were not significantly more likely to experience PONV more than six hours after surgery.

PONV results from patient, surgical, and anesthetic factors.

Surgical factors that confer increased risk for PONV include procedures of increased length and gynecological, abdominal, laparoscopic and ENT procedures, and strabismus procedures in children.

Anesthetic risk factors include the use of volatile anesthetics, nitrous oxide (N2O), opioids, and longer duration of anesthesia.

Patient factors that confer increased risk for PONV include female gender, obesity, age less than 16 years, past history of motion sickness or chemotherapy-induced nausea, high levels of preoperative anxiety, and patients with history of PONV.

Smokers and the elderly often have a decreased risk for PONV.

A risk-stratification method created by Apfel &quot;et al&quot; has been developed to determine a patient&#x27;s risk for PONV. The presence of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 of any of the following risk factors corresponds to a PONV respective risk of 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80%.

* Female sex

* Non-smoking

* History of PONV or motion sickness

* Expectant use of postoperative opioid medications

== Prevention ==
Treatment options to prevent PONV include medications such as antiemetics (for example, ondansetron or dexamethasone) or other drugs including tropisetron, dolasetron, cyclizine, and granisetron. Droperidol may cause QT prolongation and is not frequently used. Other approaches to reduce PONV include decision on the types of anaesthetic used during surgery and intravenous (IV) dextrose solutions. Increasing the IV fluids during surgery by giving additional fluid while the person is under general anaesthesia may reduce the risk of nausea/vomiting after surgery. For minor surgical procedures, more research is needed to determine the risks and benefits of this approach.

==Management==
Because currently no single antiemetic available is especially effective on its own, experts recommend a multimodal approach. Anesthetic strategies to prevent vomiting include using regional anesthesia whenever possible and avoiding medications that cause vomiting. Medications to treat and prevent PONV are limited by both cost and the adverse effects. People with risk factors likely warrant preventive medication, whereas a &quot;wait and see&quot; strategy is appropriate for those without risk factors.

===Preoperative fasting===
Fasting guidelines often restrict the intake of any oral fluid 2-6 hours preoperatively, but in a large retrospective analysis in Torbay Hospital, unrestricted clear oral fluids until transfer to theatre could significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting without an increased risk in the adverse outcomes for which such conservative guidance exists.

===Medications===
A multimodal approach to treating a patient with PONV can be efficacious. Numerous patient factors and medication adverse effects must be taken into consideration when selecting a treatment regimen.
* Serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists can be administered as a single dose at the end of surgery. Adverse effects include prolongation of the QT interval on electrocardiogram (EKG). Medications include ondansetron, granisetron, and dolasetron.
* Anticholinergics can be used as a long-acting patch placed behind the patient&#x27;s ear. Adverse effects include dry mouth and blurry vision. Care must be taken when handling the patch, as transfer of medication to the eye can induce pupillary dilation. Avoid use in elderly patients. Medications include scopolamine.
* Glucocorticoids have direct antiemetic effects and can reduce need for postoperative opioids. Adverse effects include a transient increase in serum glucose level, and poor wound healing (controversial). Medications include dexamethasone.
* Butyrophenones are typically administered as a single injection at the end of surgery. Adverse effects include prolongation of the QT interval on EKG. Medications include droperidol and haloperidol.
* Phenothiazines are particularly effective in treating opioid-induced PONV. Adverse effects are dose-dependent and include sedation and extrapyramidal symptoms. Medications include promethazine, chlorpromazine and prochlorperazine.
* Neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists prevent an emetic signal from being transmitted. Medications include aprepitant and rolapitant.
* Histamine receptor antagonists can be administered by multiple routes, including orally, intramuscularly, or rectally. Adverse effects include dry mouth, sedation, and urinary retention. Medications include dimenhydrinate and diphenhydramine.
* Propofol, an anesthetic medication, confers its own antiemetic properties.

Weibel, Rücker, Eberhart et al&#x27;s 2020 Cochrane review demonstrated that combination therapy is more effective than single anti-emetic, and that dexamethasone and ondansetron (a commonly used combination) are two of the most effective anti-emetics for PONV. The review adds robust evidence of efficacy for drugs in newer classes, such as aprepitant or fosapreitant, or newer agents in familiar classes, such as ramosetron. The review does not cover the cost effectiveness of the agents included and, despite increased efficacy for newer novel agents, this may preclude their immediate utilisation in anaesthetic practice.

===Alternative medicine===
In conjunction with antiemetic medications, at least one study has found that application to the pericardium meridian 6 acupressure point produced a positive effect in relieving PONV. Another study found no statistically significant difference. The two general types of alternative pressure therapy are sham acupressure and the use of the P6 point. A 2015 study found no significant difference between the use of either therapy in the treatment or prevention of PONV. In a review of 59 studies, both therapies significantly affected the nausea aspect, but had no significant effect on vomiting.

Cannabinoids have also been used for treatment of PONV, but its safety and efficacy are controversial.

==Epidemiology==
Typically, the incidence of nausea or vomiting after general anesthesia ranges between 25 and 30%. Nausea and vomiting can be extremely distressing for patients, and so is one of their major concerns. Vomiting has been associated with major complications, such as pulmonary aspiration of gastric content, and might endanger surgical outcomes after certain procedures, for example after maxillofacial surgery with wired jaws. Nausea and vomiting can delay discharge, and about 1% of patients scheduled for day surgery require unanticipated overnight admission because of uncontrolled PONV.

<doc id="724212" wikidata="Q392250" url="?curid=724212" title="Isthmus of Tehuantepec">
<text>The Isthmus of Tehuantepec () is an isthmus in Mexico. It represents the shortest distance between the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. Before the opening of the Panama Canal, it was a major overland transport route known simply as the Tehuantepec Route. The name is taken from the town of Santo Domingo Tehuantepec in the state of Oaxaca; this was derived from the Nahuatl term (&quot;jaguar mountain&quot;).

==Geography==

The isthmus includes the part of Mexico lying between the 94th and 96th meridians west longitude, or the southeastern parts of Veracruz and Oaxaca, including small areas of Chiapas and Tabasco. The states of Tabasco and Chiapas are east of the isthmus, with Veracruz and Oaxaca on the west.

At its narrowest point, the isthmus is across from gulf to gulf, or to the head of Laguna Superior on the Pacific coast. The Sierra Madre del Sur mountain range breaks down at this point into a broad, plateau-like ridge, whose elevation, at the highest point reached by the Ferrocarril Transistmico railway at Chivela Pass, is 224 m (735 ft). The northern side of the isthmus is swampy and densely covered with jungle, which has been a greater obstacle to railway construction than the grades in crossing the sierra.

The Selva Zoque in the eastern-central region of the isthmus is an area of great ecological importance, the largest remaining area of tropical rainforest in Mexico and holding the majority of the terrestrial biodiversity in Mexico.

The Sierra Madre de Oaxaca mountains flatten to form Chivela Pass before the Sierra Madre de Chiapas mountains resume to the south, so geographically the isthmus divides North America from Central America. The southern edge of the North American tectonic plate lies across the Motagua Fault in Guatemala, so geologically, the division between North America and Central America (on the Caribbean Plate) is much farther south than the isthmus of Tehuantepec.

===History===

The Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a region located in the south of Mexico, is the narrowest area between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in the whole country. Only 220 kilometers separate the two oceans between the gulfs of Mexico and Tehuantepec. During the first half of the 16th century, it seemed as if nature could not withstand the strenuous effort of the Spanish conquistadores to find, within the tropics, a strait connecting the two oceans. This meant that in the conquest explorations during the 16th century, this region was used as an interoceanic passage. The exploration of this region between the &#x27;North Sea&#x27; and the &#x27;South Sea&#x27; was, since the conquest of Mesoamerica, a fixed idea of the Spanish monarchy and its representatives. Carlos V made this project one of the priority missions of the explorers whose objective was to put the kingdom of New Spain in communication with that of Peru. Hernán Cortés, in 1520, used this route to transport equipment and supplies across the isthmus from the Gulf of Mexico to his shipyard located on the Pacific coast, near the town of Santo Domingo de Tehuantepec. The advantage lay in the ability to make a good part of the journey by river. Approximately two-thirds of the Isthmus is crossed by the Coatzacoalcos River, which is navigable for approximately 200 kilometers. Cortés saw this river as a means of fluvial communication across the Isthmus itself. During the last third of the 16th century, Spanish expeditions arrived at the port of Veracruz, in the Gulf of Mexico, and from there they moved by boat to the mouth of the Coatzacoalcos River. The material necessary to build ships (supplies and tools or provisions) in the shipyards located along the Pacific coast, together with the artillery, were loaded into shallow canoes to navigate upstream, and subsequently transported, on the backs of the indigenous people, from the sources of the Coatzacoalcos River to the Pacific coast, in the Gulf of Tehuantepec.1 Many of these expeditions later moved along the coast to the port of Acapulco, from where they sailed along the western coast of North America, and then set off westwards, seeking a passage to the Philippines and southern China. The advantages of this itinerary would lead to the proposal, as early as the 16th century, of an interoceanic canal. However, a series of difficulties caused the most feasible option, Panama, to eclipse Tehuantepec as an interoceanic passage.
===Biogeography===

The Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a valley otherwise surrounded by montane habitats, has also been noted as an important biogeographical barrier among montane taxa, such as Mexican birds. Population diversification has been observed among not only avian fauna, but other organisms as well, including toads and the Central American river turtle. As a result, the Isthmus presents a case of allopatric speciation wherein a geographic divide gives rise to population divergence and a significant decrease in gene flow.

===Climate===
The predominant climates in the region are tropical savanna (primarily in the south) and tropical monsoon (primarily in the north). There are also small central areas with a temperate climate due to elevation. The annual rainfall on the Atlantic or northern slope is 3,960 mm (156 in) and the maximum temperature about 35 °C (95 °F) in the shade. The Pacific slope has a light rainfall and dryer climate.
The narrowness of the isthmus, and the gap in the Sierra Madre, allow the trade winds from the Gulf of Mexico to blow through to the Pacific. Normally, these winds are not particularly strong, but periodically, a surge of denser air originating from the North American continent will send strong winds through the Chivela Pass and out over the Gulf of Tehuantepec on the Pacific coast. This wind is known as the Tehuano. The region has one of the best wind resources in Mexico, with several wind farms.

==People and culture==

In the Oaxaca half of Tehuantepec, the population is composed mostly of indigenous Zapotec peoples. The women are the traders in the Oaxacan Tehuantepec area and do little menial work. Known as &quot;&quot;Tehuanas&quot;,&quot; these women are known throughout Mexico for their colorful dresses, assertive personalities, and relatively equal relations with men, leading some to characterize them as &quot;matriarchal.&quot;

===Cuisine===
The cuisine of the region is based upon traditional foods and ingredients. Dishes may range from simple to elaborate; most dishes incorporate maize and moles. Common items include tamales made with iguana, chicken, beef or armadillo; guetabingui (fried balls of rice and shrimp); garnachas topped with dried queso Oaxaca; and pozol, a maize-based drink.

==Tehuantepec route==
Since the days of Hernán Cortés, the Tehuantepec isthmus has been considered a favorable route, first for an interoceanic canal, and since the 19th century for an interoceanic railway. Its proximity to the axis of international trade gives it some advantage over the Panama route. But the Isthmus of Panama is narrower, making for a shorter traversal, even if the canal is farther from trade routes.

The 1854 Gadsden Purchase treaty included a provision allowing the U.S. to transport mail and trade goods across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec via a plank road and railroad. The 1859 McLane–Ocampo Treaty, which Benito Juárez signed but was never ratified by the United States Congress, would have given the U.S. extensive transit rights along the same route.

While the idea of a canal across the isthmus failed to gain momentum due to the enormous cost of such a project, engineer James B. Eads proposed to construct a quadruple track ship-railway, and the scheme received serious attention for some time. Then came projects for an ordinary railway, and several concessions were granted by the Mexican government for this purpose from 1857 to 1882. In the latter year the Mexican government resolved to undertake the railroad construction on its own account, and entered into contracts with a prominent Mexican contractor for the work. In 1888 this contract was rescinded, after of road had been completed.

The next contract was fruitless because of the death of the contractor, and the third failed to complete the work within the sum specified (). This was in 1893, and remained to be built. A fourth contract resulted in the completion of the 130-mile line from coast to coast in 1894. But, it was found that the terminal ports were deficient in facilities and the railroad was too light for heavy traffic.

The government then entered into a contract with the London firm of contractors of S. Pearson &amp; Son, Ltd., who had constructed the drainage works of the valley of Mexico and the new port works of Veracruz, to rebuild the line and construct terminal ports at Coatzacoalcos on the Gulf coast, and at Salina Cruz on the Pacific side. The work was done for account of the Mexican government. Work began on 10 December 1899, and was finished to a point where its formal opening for traffic was possible in January 1907.

===Tehuantepec Railway Line===


The Tehuantepec railway (now the Ferrocarril Transístmico (&quot;Trans-Isthmic Railroad&quot;)), is long, running from the port of Coatzacoalcos on the Gulf of Mexico to Salina Cruz in Oaxaca on the Pacific coast, with a branch of between Juile and San Juan Evangelista. The minimum depth at low water in both ports is 10 m (33 ft). An extensive system of quays and railway tracks at both terminals affords ample facilities for the expeditious handling of heavy cargoes. The general offices and repair shops of the original Tehuantepec Railway were located at Rincón Antonio, at the entrance to the Chivela Pass. At Santa Lucrecia, from Salina Cruz, connection was made with the Veracruz &amp; Pacific Railway, to Córdoba, Veracruz, and to Mexico City. Those connecting lines are now owned and operated by Ferrosur, a company that also operates along the Ferroistmo-owned Tuehantepec line.

Several proposals have been made for modernizing the inter-ocean rail connection. In 2019, as part of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec Development Plan, a project has been taking place since June of that year to create a communication link between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans through the Tehuantepec Railway and the ports of Salina Cruz and Coatzacoalcos, known as the Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Recent reports state that this corridor will be fully operational by December 2023.

<text>Limbonic Art is a Norwegian symphonic black metal band from Sandefjord.

==History==
Limbonic Art was formed in 1993 by Daemon, and was originally a full band featuring 3 other members. Daemon got in touch with Morfeus after the demise of the first line-up. The first recording, a rehearsal demo, was released independently in 1995. The debut album &quot;Moon in the Scorpio&quot; was released in 1996. The follow-up, 1997&#x27;s &quot;In Abhorrence Dementia&quot;, was supported by a tour opening for Emperor, and a year later Limbonic Art issued its third LP, &quot;Epitome of Illusions&quot;. In 2003, the band decided to split up with a statement from the official site saying &quot;We feel that we have reached as far as we could in our collaboration ... the circle is complete, begin another&quot;.

On June 6, 2006, Limbonic Art reunited and started to write new material. On February 21, 2007 it was announced that the band plans to release the new album entitled &quot;Legacy of Evil&quot; in the summer.

A subsequent dispute between the band members resulted in Morfeus being ousted from the band in 2009, making Limbonic Art essentially Daemon&#x27;s solo project. Following his departure, Limbonic Art released &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; (2010) and &quot;Spectre Abysm&quot; (2017).

<text>Yasin Said Numan (; born 1948) is the former General Secretary of the Yemeni Socialist Party from 2005 to 2015. He is the current ambassador of Yemen to the United Kingdom since 2015.

Numan joined the Yemeni National Front, which later became the Yemeni Socialist Party, when he was 17. In 1986 he became the Prime Minister of the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen from February 1986 until Yemeni unification in 1990, under Chairman Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas, who preceded Numan as Prime Minister.

<text>The Presa Canario is a Spanish breed of large dog of mastiff or catch dog type. It originates in the Spanish autonomous community of the Canary Islands, and is found mostly in the islands of Gran Canaria and Tenerife. It was formerly known as the Dogo Canario. It was traditionally used as a guard dog, as a herding dog for both sheep and cattle, and for dog-fighting, which was legal in Spain until 1936 and may have continued clandestinely thereafter.

== History ==

The Presa Canario derives from the Bardino Majorero, which was formerly distributed throughout the Canary Islands. Dogs of this type were cross-bred with various dogs of molossoid type introduced to the islands at different times during the colonial period. The Presa Canario was particularly influenced by dogs brought from the British Isles with the large influx of British residents in the late nineteenth century.

By the 1960s it was close to extinction. A breed society, the Club Español del Presa Canario, was formed in 1982, and drew up a provisional breed standard, which was published by the government of the islands. The standard was approved by the Real Sociedad Canina de España in 1989. In 1991 the dog was included in an official list of national symbols of the Canary Islands as a symbol of the island of Gran Canaria. It was officially recognised by the Spanish national government in 2001.

The breed was provisionally accepted by the Federation Cynologique Internationale in 2001 under the name Dogo Canario, and was definitively accepted in 2011. In December 2018, at the request of the Real Sociedad Canina de España, the name was changed to Presa Canario. It is included in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club from 1996. It is recognized by United Kennel Club from 2003. 

Importation and sale of the breed is prohibited in Australia and New Zealand.

== Characteristics ==

The Presa Canario is a medium-sized dog with a robust muscular body. According to the revised international standard published in 2023, dogs should stand at the withers and weigh some ; bitches stand about , with weights in the range . The previous standard, dated 2018, specified heavier weights, particularly for dogs (), and slightly lower minimum heights.

The head is broad, massive, square, and powerful brachycephalic shape. If cropped, the ears stand erect. In countries where ear-cropping is banned, the ears are close fitting to the head; they hang down and should be pendant or &quot;rose&quot;-shaped. The upper lip is pendulous, although not excessively so. Seen from the front, the upper and lower lips come together to form an inverted V. The flews are slightly divergent. The inside of the lips is a dark colour.

A study of dogs in the United Kingdom found a median longevity for the breed of 7.7 years, markedly lower than the median of 12.5 for all dogs.

== Use ==

The Presa Canario was traditionally used as a guard dog, as a herding dog for cattle, and for dog-fighting, which was legal in Spain until 1936 and may have continued clandestinely thereafter.. Until the 1950s it remained a common practice in all of the islands.

<text>The Ottawa River, also known as Ottawa Creek, is a short river, approximately long (or about if Tenmile Creek, the longest tributary, is included), in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan in the United States. It drains an area on the Ohio-Michigan border along the eastern and northern fringes of the city of Toledo, goes through Ottawa Hills, and empties directly into Lake Erie. It is one of two rivers in northwestern Ohio that share the same name, along with the Ottawa River that is a tributary of the Auglaize River. The upper of the river in Michigan north of Sylvania, Ohio is called North Tenmile Creek on federal maps, while another branch rising in Fulton County, Ohio, is called Tenmile Creek.

North Tenmile Creek rises in extreme southeastern Michigan, southwest of Ottawa Lake, approximately north of the Ohio-Michigan state line. The creek flows south across the state line to Sylvania, where it is joined by Tenmile Creek to form the Ottawa River, approximately northwest of Toledo. The river then flows southeast into western Toledo, where it turns northeast. For its lower it flows along the north side of Toledo roughly parallel to the Maumee River, separated from it by approximately . It crosses the Michigan state line for its final , entering Little Maumee Bay on Lake Erie.

==Pollutants==
The water quality assessment of the lower section of the Ottawa River found many chemicals in the water with a hazard quotient greater than 1 (from highest to lowest concentration): lead, aluminum, PCBs, manganese, iron, DDT, thallium, selenium, chromium, nickel, cadmium, cyanide, and zinc.

The poor water quality results primarily from the river&#x27;s form and structure, since it has a slow flow, and, secondly, from urban runoff and discharge from landfills and sewers. The City of Toledo has made it a priority to clean up the river. It has taken action to clear landfills and tributaries.

==Dam removal==
In 2001, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed the removal of a long-standing dam in the Ottawa Hills stretch of the river to return the waterway to its natural flow and promote fish migration. It was also mentioned that the dam was a liability for the village. One dam was removed in 2007 and another in 2020.

<doc id="724247" wikidata="Q700467" url="?curid=724247" title="Lost Universe">
<text>is a series of science fiction light novels, running from 1992 to 1999, by Japanese author Hajime Kanzaka. It was later adapted into a 26-episode anime series by E&amp;G Films that ran from April 3rd to September 25th, 1998. The series aired on TV Tokyo in the same time slot in which the anime adaptation of Kanzaka&#x27;s previous work &quot;Slayers&quot; had previously been shown.

The anime is known as &quot;Universe Police&quot; in China and Hong Kong. 

==Plot==
In &quot;Slayers&quot;, it is mentioned that the main characters of that series live in a world that is one of the four created by the mother of all creation, called the Lord of Nightmares. This world was known as the Red World. &quot;Lost Universe&quot;, however, takes place in a different world, known as the Black World. Whereas the demigods of the various worlds, such as Ruby-Eye Shabranigdo and Dark Star Dugradigdo had physical presence in that world, they appear in the Black World as &quot;Lost Ships,&quot; intelligent spaceships of unknown origin that have powerful or somewhat divine powers with more advanced technology than any other device in the universe. 

Their rarity and superiority have sparked suggestions that they have been made by an advanced ancient alien civilization or come from the beginning of the universe itself. Being a central part to the plot, the &quot;Lost Ships&quot; are intelligent beings with different loyalties and even their own agenda. Kain Blueriver, a &quot;trouble contractor,&quot; inherits a &quot;Lost Ship&quot; from his grandmother and from there, he and his sidekick Milly, together with Canal, the ship&#x27;s computer, journey to find a source of the evil that threatens the universe.

==Characters==

: is an intergalactic trouble-Contractor. He is characterised as a tough and reckless adventurer who captains &quot;Sword-Breaker&quot;, the legendary lost spaceship from an ancient civilization. He acquired his spaceship from his grandmother and constantly recites quotes of her. He is shown to be a free spirit, and keeps an open mind whatever the situation. Ever the optimist, he is always confident he will prevail over whatever troubles await him. His motto is &quot;carry out any difficult assignment to the end!&quot; Kain is the master of the Psi-Blade, a weapon of psi energy, requiring tremendous mental strength. He wears a black cloak, likes his grandmother.

:, is a happy-go-lucky girl whose catchphrase is that she aspires to be the &quot;best in the universe.&quot; She joins Kain on their space adventures as an assistant and sometimes private detective. She has very basic detecting skills like opening a locked door with her hair pin. At work, she is indeed the best shot in the universe, but at home on &quot;Sword-Breaker&quot; is another matter. Providing a bit of comedy, she routinely blows up the kitchen, but somehow the meals turn out delicious.

: is a female human-like hologram that serves as the &quot;Sword-Breaker&quot; ship&#x27;s computer. She has green hair styled in two long braids. She has a distinctive personality, emotions and reasoning abilities. Her usual form is a teenage girl, but if necessary, she can morph her form into a baby, a noble lady or other objects; whatever is needed to help Kain in his missions. Her motto is &quot;carry out any difficult assignment to the end, as long as it shows a profit!&quot; In this respect she is much like Lina Inverse from the series &quot;Slayers&quot;, with whom she shares a voice actress. Canal&#x27;s mind functions as a computer, and she is very practical, analytical and logical. On the other hand, she sometimes shows her emotions when she teases Kain for his mistakes or has a quarrel with Millie. She is a bit selfish, doing a lot of negative actions for the &quot;Sword-Breaker&quot; owner (Kain Blueriver), like turning off Life System only for getting a job that Kain did not want.

:He is a handsome and smart police inspector of Interstellar Police. Kain has a sort of inescapable &quot;give-and-take&quot; relationship with this young inspector. He often contacts the crew of the &quot;Sword-Breaker&quot; with mission requests that are not always requests.

:The secretary of Raily Claymore, Nina is so deeply in love with Raily that she is fascinated by his gaze and forgets what she is doing. Two running gags in the series focus on her accidentally spilling coffee on Raily, and shortening out any machine with the slightest touch. The latter is actually useful in several adventures.

:He is the master of a giant company called Gazer Konzern and the boss of mega-crime organization Nightmare. He is the master of the Lost Ship Dark Star, and intends to control the whole universe. Stargazer possesses a power to destroy the mind of a person from afar.

:He is a young-looking guy who works for Stargazer, and master of Goln-Nova, one of the legendary Lost Ships. He commands Glen and Carly at Nightmare. He was injured in the battle with Alice ten years ago and has since been in stasis. He woke up after sleeping for 87,016 hours in a capsule.

==Media==

===Light novels===
When the first novel of &quot;Lost Universe&quot; was released in 1992, it enjoyed moderate success. Kanzaka was already in negotiations for the &quot;Slayers&quot; anime.

===Manga===
A manga adaptation by Shoko Yoshinaka was published in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Dragon Junior&quot; magazine from December 1997 to November 2002 and was collected into four volumes.

===Anime===

&quot;Lost Universe&quot; is distributed in North America by Enoki Films, and was originally licensed for American distribution by ADV Films, who released the series onto both dubbed and subtitled VHS tapes and bilingual DVD. Following ADV&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2009, the rights to the anime have since transferred to Nozomi Entertainment who re-released the complete series in a new bilingual DVD box set. The entirety of the show&#x27;s English dub can be streamed and watched for free on Nozomi Entertainment&#x27;s YouTube channel.

<text>is a line of Japanese stuffed monkey toys from the Sekiguchi Corporation, first released in 1974. They were licensed by Mattel in the United States until 1985, and later distributed worldwide directly by Sekiguchi. 
Five television series were produced based on the characters: The Japanese anime series in 1980, produced by Tokyo 12 Channel (now TV Tokyo), the American cartoon series &quot;Monchhichis&quot; in 1983, produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, the French cartoon series &quot;Kiki, le Kiki de tous les Kiki&quot; in 2001, produced by Ben-J Productions, the Japanese stop-motion series in 2005, by Kids Station and the French CGI series &quot;Monchhichi Tribe&quot; (La Tribu Monchhichi) in 2017, produced by Technicolor Animation Productions.

==History==
The Monchhichi franchise is held by the Sekiguchi Corporation, a famous doll company, located in Tokyo, Japan. Monchhichi was created by Yoshiharu Washino on January 25, 1974, as an improvement to the already successful Kuta Kuta Monkey (Exhausted monkey).
Sekiguchi claims they created these characters in order to inspire respect and love in the young (Japanese) children and adults, their name is derived from the words &quot;Mon&quot; which translates to &quot;Mine&quot; in French and &quot;Chichi&quot; which closely resembles the sound a child&#x27;s pacifier would produce according to Japanese phonetics, also the resulting word has a similar sound to the word &quot;Monkey&quot; in English.

The dolls were successful in Japan, and the animated TV series, &quot;Futago no Monchhichi&quot; (ふたごのモンチッチ, &quot;Monchhichi Twins&quot;) which ran in 1980, helped increase its popularity even further.

Export of the doll line started in 1975, to Germany and Austria. The following years would see the Monchhichi line marketed in more countries. The original name was changed to &quot;Chicaboo&quot; in the United Kingdom, to &quot;Mon Cicci&quot; in Italy, to &quot;Kiki&quot; in France, to &quot;Bølle&quot; in Denmark, to &quot;Moncsicsi&quot; in Hungary and to &quot;Virkiki&quot; in Spain. The height of the Monchhichi dolls&#x27; popularity was in Germany during the 1980s, surpassing even the Japanese figure sales during this period.

The Monchhichi doll line reached North American shores in 1980. Mattel bought the license for the toy line. The American cartoon series &quot;Monchhichis&quot; was produced by Hanna-Barbera in 1983 and aired on ABC (as part of &quot;The Monchhichis/Little Rascals/Richie Rich Show&quot;) in an effort to promote the doll line. The line was dropped by Mattel due to poor sales in 1985, but was reintroduced during Monchhichi&#x27;s 30 anniversary in 2004 by Sekiguchi. As of 2013, Monchhichi dolls are still available in the United States from retailers such as Target.

As of 2015, Monchchichi are still popular in Germany, mostly as a nostalgic toy or for collectors. Many variants and sizes of Monchhichi have emerged. For example, the original Monchhichi is still available under the Classic variant in 10 cm, 20 cm, 24 cm, 45 cm and even 80 cm sizes. Also other variants like Boutique (Monchhichi in various dress styles), Mother Care (Monchhichi with a young one in her front pocket), and the 40th Anniversary edition are available. Even dollhouses for Monchhichi are available.

<doc id="724284" wikidata="Q28491" url="?curid=724284" title="The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)">
<text>The Betrothed ( ) is an Italian historical novel by Alessandro Manzoni, first published in 1827, in three volumes, and significantly revised and rewritten until the definitive version published between 1840 and 1842. It has been called the most famous and widely read novel in the Italian language.

Set in the Duchy of Milan in 1628, during the years of Spanish rule, the novel is also noted for its extraordinary description of the plague that struck Milan around 1630.

The novel deals with a variety of themes, for example: the illusory nature of political power and the inherent injustice of any legal system; the range of character among the Christian clergy from the cowardice of the parish priest Don Abbondio to the heroic sanctity of others (the friar Padre Cristoforo, the cardinal Federico Borromeo); and the unwavering strength of love (the relationship between Renzo and Lucia, and their struggle to finally meet again and be married). The novel is renowned for offering keen insights into the meanderings of the human mind.

== Writing and publication ==
Manzoni found the basis for his novel in 1821 when he read a 1627 Italian edict that specified penalties for any priest who refused to perform a marriage when requested to do so. More material for his story came from Giuseppe Ripamonti&#x27;s &quot;Milanese Chronicles&quot;.

The first version, &quot;Fermo e Lucia&quot;, was written between April 1821 and September 1823. He then heavily revised it, finishing in August 1825; it was published on 15 June 1827, after two years of corrections and proof-checking. Manzoni&#x27;s chosen title, &quot;Gli sposi promessi&quot;, was changed for the sake of euphony shortly before its final commitment to printing.

In the early 19th century, there was still controversy as to what form the standard literary language of Italy should take. Manzoni was firmly in favour of the dialect of Florence and, as he himself put it, after &quot;washing his clothes in the Arno [the river passing through Florence]&quot;, he revised the novel&#x27;s language for its republication in 1842, cleansing it of many Lombard regionalisms. The original name of one of the protagonists, Fermo, was changed for the same reason to Lorenzo.

== Plot summary ==
=== Chapters 1–8: Flight from the village ===
 The setting is beautiful but marred with poverty. It begins with Renzo and Lucia, a couple living in a village in Lombardy, near Lecco, on Lake Como, who are planning to wed on 8 November 1628. The parish priest, don Abbondio, is walking home on the eve of the wedding when he is accosted by two &quot;bravi&quot; (thugs) who warn him not to perform the marriage, because the local baron (Don Rodrigo) has forbidden it.

When he presents himself for the wedding ceremony, Renzo is amazed to hear that the marriage is to be postponed (the priest didn&#x27;t have the courage to tell the truth). An argument ensues and Renzo succeeds in extracting from the priest the name of Don Rodrigo. It turns out that Don Rodrigo has his eye on Lucia and that he had a bet about her with his cousin Count Attilio.

Lucia&#x27;s mother, Agnese, advises Renzo to ask the advice of &quot;Dr. Azzeccagarbugli&quot; (Dr. Quibbleweaver, in Colquhoun&#x27;s translation), a lawyer in the town of Lecco. Dr. Azzeccagarbugli is at first sympathetic: thinking Renzo is actually the perpetrator, he shows Renzo a recent edict criminalising the making of threats to procure or prevent marriages, but when he hears the name of Don Rodrigo, he panics and drives Renzo away. Lucia sends a message to &quot;Fra Cristoforo&quot; (Friar Christopher), a respected Capuchin friar at the monastery of Pescarenico, asking him to come as soon as he can.

Fra Christopher&#x27;s back story is told. He used to be the son of a rich merchant and his birth name was Lodovico. He had a steward named Christopher, who was very faithful and had a family. While traveling along a road, Lodovico and his enemy had a standoff over who would lose face and pass on the outside. A fight broke out and an enemy bravo killed Christopher. Lodovico then killed Christopher&#x27;s murderer. Lodovico then decided to become a friar after wrapping up his worldly affairs with Christopher&#x27;s family and the family of the man he had killed. Lodovico became a friar, taking the name Fra Christopher.
When Fra Cristoforo comes to Lucia&#x27;s cottage and hears the story, he immediately goes to Don Rodrigo&#x27;s mansion, where he finds the baron at a meal with his cousin Count Attilio, along with four guests, including the mayor and Dr. Azzeccagarbugli. The power dynamics of the people at the dining table is evident. When Don Rodrigo is taken aside by the friar, he explodes with anger at his presumption and sends him away, but not before an old servant has a chance to offer his help to Cristoforo.

Meanwhile, Agnese has come up with a plan. In those days, it was possible for two people to marry by declaring themselves married before a priest and in the presence of two amenable witnesses. Renzo runs to his friend Tonio and offers him 25 lire if he agrees to help. When Fra Cristoforo returns with the bad news, Lucia and Renzo argue about how to proceed. Lucia is a god-fearing woman and doesn&#x27;t want to get married by law. Renzo doesn&#x27;t care and wants to get married no matter what and acts harshly to Lucia. Eventually, they decide to put their plan into action.

The next morning, Lucia and Agnese are visited by beggars, Don Rodrigo&#x27;s men in disguise. They examine the house in order to plan an assault. Late at night, Agnese distracts Don Abbondio&#x27;s servant Perpetua while Tonio and his brother Gervaso enter Don Abbondio&#x27;s study, ostensibly to pay a debt. They are followed indoors secretly by Lucia and Renzo. When they try to carry out their plan, the priest throws the tablecloth in Lucia&#x27;s face and drops the lamp. They struggle in the darkness. The plan fails and the five flee.

In the meantime, Don Rodrigo&#x27;s men invade Lucia&#x27;s house, but nobody is there. A boy named Menico, friend of Lucia and Renzo, arrives with a message of warning from Fra Cristoforo and they seize him. When they hear the alarm being raised by the sacristan, who is calling for help on the part of Don Abbondio who raised the alarm of invaders in his home, they assume they have been betrayed and flee in confusion. Menico sees Agnese, Lucia and Renzo in the street and warns them not to return home. They go to the monastery, where Fra Cristoforo gives Renzo a letter of introduction to a certain friar at Milan, and another letter to the two women, to organize a refuge at a convent in the nearby city of Monza.

=== Chapters 9–10: The Nun of Monza ===

They lament leaving Lecco. Renzo, Lucia, and Agnese part ways. Lucia is entrusted to the nun Gertrude, a strange and unpredictable noblewoman whose story is told in these chapters.

A child of the most important family of the area, her father decided to send her to the cloisters for no other reason than to simplify his affairs: he wished to keep his properties united for his first-born, heir to the family&#x27;s title and riches. Growing up to be a nun she thought she was more superior than others. As she grew up, she sensed that she was being forced by her parents into a life which would comport but little with her personality. She was kept in a convent for most of her life and dreamed to escape.

To become a nun, Gertrude must go back to the outside world and reflect if she wants to leave it forever. She is excited until she finds that her own family locks her up inside and ignores her. She finds solace in an affair with a servant boy. When her father finds out, he is furious and threatens and manipulates her into agreeing to become a nun permanently.

The fear of scandal, as well as manoeuvre, menaces, and manipulation from her father, induced Gertrude to lie to her interviewers in order to enter the convent of Monza, where she was received as &quot;la Signora&quot;. This forms Gertrude&#x27;s personality and mental state badly as her hate of being a nun seeps into her actions. (&quot;the lady&quot;, also known as The Nun of Monza). Later, she fell under the spell of a young man of no scruples, Egidio, associated with the worst baron of that time, the &quot;Innominato&quot; (the &quot;Unnamed&quot;). Egidio and Gertrude became lovers. When another nun discovered their relationship they killed her and buried her near the garden wall.

=== Chapters 11–17: Renzo in Milan ===

Renzo arrives in famine-stricken Milan and goes to the monastery, but the friar he is seeking is absent and so he wanders further into the city. A bakery in the Corsia de&#x27; Servi, &quot;El prestin di scansc&quot; (&quot;Bakery of the Crutches&quot;), is destroyed by a mob, who then go to the house of the Commissioner of Supply in order to lynch him. He is saved in the nick of time by Ferrer, the Grand Chancellor, who arrives in a coach and announces he is taking the Commissioner to prison. Renzo becomes prominent as he helps Ferrer make his way through the crowd.

After witnessing these scenes, Renzo joins in a lively discussion and reveals views which attract the notice of a police agent in search of a scapegoat. The agent tries to lead Renzo directly to &quot;the best inn&quot; (i.e. prison) but Renzo is tired and stops at one nearby where, after being plied with drink, he reveals his full name and address. The next morning, he is awakened by a notary and two bailiffs, who handcuff him and start to take him away. In the street Renzo announces loudly that he is being punished for his heroism the day before and, with the aid of sympathetic onlookers and political unrest brewing, he escapes. Leaving the city by the same gate through which he entered, he sets off for Bergamo, knowing that his cousin Bortolo lives in a village nearby. Once there, he will be beyond the reach of the authorities of Milan (under Spanish domination), as Bergamo is territory of the Most Serene Republic of Venice.

At an inn in Gorgonzola, he overhears a conversation which makes it clear to him how much trouble he is in and so he walks all night until he reaches the River Adda. After a short sleep in a hut, he crosses the river at dawn in the boat of a fisherman and makes his way to his cousin&#x27;s house, where he is welcomed as a silk-weaver under the pseudonym of Antonio Rivolta after he confesses everything to Bortolo. The same day, orders for Renzo&#x27;s arrest reach the town of Lecco, to the delight of Don Rodrigo.

=== Chapters 18–24: Lucia and the Unnamed ===

News of Renzo&#x27;s disgrace comes to the convent, but later Lucia is informed that Renzo is safe with his cousin. Their reassurance is short-lived: when they receive no word from Fra Cristoforo for a long time, Agnese travels to Pescarenico, where she learns that he has been ordered by a superior to the town of Rimini. In fact, this has been engineered by Don Rodrigo and Count Attilio, who have leaned on a mutual uncle of the Secret Council, who has leaned on the Father Provincial. Meanwhile, Don Rodrigo has organised a plot to kidnap Lucia from the convent. This involves a great robber baron whose name has not been recorded, and who hence is called &quot;l&#x27;Innominato&quot;, the Unnamed.

Gertrude, blackmailed by Egidio, a neighbor (acquaintance of &quot;l&#x27;Innominato&quot; and Gertrude&#x27;s lover), persuades Lucia to run an errand which will take her outside the convent for a short while. In the street Lucia is seized and bundled into a coach. After a nightmarish journey, Lucia arrives at the castle of the Unnamed, where she is locked in a chamber.
The Unnamed is troubled by the sight of her, and spends a horrible night in which memories of his past and the uncertainty of his future almost drive him to suicide. Meanwhile, Lucia spends a similarly restless night, during which she vows to renounce Renzo and maintain perpetual virginity if she is delivered from her predicament. Towards the morning, on looking out of his window, the Unnamed sees throngs of people walking past. They are going to listen to the famous Archbishop of Milan, Cardinal Federigo Borromeo. On impulse, the Unnamed leaves his castle in order to meet this man. This meeting prompts a miraculous conversion which marks the turning-point of the novel. The Unnamed announces to his men that his reign of terror is over. He decides to take Lucia back to her native land under his own protection, and with the help of the archbishop the deed is done.

=== Chapters 25–27: Fall of Don Rodrigo ===
The astonishing course of events leads to an atmosphere in which Don Rodrigo can be defied openly and his fortunes take a turn for the worse. Don Abbondio is reprimanded by the archbishop.

Lucia, miserable about her vow to renounce Renzo, still frets about him. He is now the subject of diplomatic conflict between Milan and Bergamo. Her life is not improved when a wealthy busybody, Donna Prassede, insists on taking her into her household and admonishing her for getting mixed up with a good-for-nothing like Renzo. Donna Prassede tries to warp Lucia&#x27;s mindset of Renzo by making him seem evil.

Renzo and Agnes institute a correspondence using trustworthy literate people to write and read from them. A few letters in, Agnes does what she had promised Lucia and gives Renzo 50 crowns and tells him about Lucia&#x27;s vow to not marry him. Renzo is enraged and refuses to accept both. He wants to return the crowns and ask Lucia why she made that vow.

=== Chapters 28–30: Famine and war ===
The government of Milan is unable to keep bread prices down by decree and the city is swamped by beggars. The &quot;lazzaretto&quot; is filled with the hungry and sick. Lazzarettos are sometimes churches or convents as in Chapter 30-33.

Meanwhile, the Thirty Years&#x27; War brings more calamities. The last three dukes of the house of Gonzaga die without legitimate heirs sparking a war for control of northern Italy, with France and the Holy Roman Empire backing rival claimants. In September 1629, German armies under Count Rambaldo di Collalto descend on Italy, looting and destroying. Agnese, Don Abbondio and Perpetua take refuge in the well-defended territory of the Unnamed. In their absence, their village is wrecked by the mercenaries.

=== Chapters 31–33: Plague ===
These chapters are occupied with an account of the plague of 1630, largely based on Giuseppe Ripamonti&#x27;s &quot;De peste quae fuit anno 1630&quot; (published in 1640). Manzoni&#x27;s full version of this, &quot;Storia della Colonna Infame&quot;, was finished in 1829, but was not published until it was included as an appendix to the revised edition of 1842.

The plague is not believed to actually be the plague by many, slow progress helps doubts arise in common people and even doctors. Most people in Italy think it has to do with Frenchmen enlisting witches to make poison from spiders. The spider poison is then spread around and that is how they believe the plague is spread.

As more people get sick, the capuchins help them in the Lazarettos. A memorable one is Fra Frederick. The Tribunal of Health is the government of Italy realize they need more people to help contain and manage the plague. Three classes are created under the Tribunal of Health. The 3rd class is the &quot;monatti&quot; who do the brunt work of carrying and deposing of the dead bodies, the 2nd &quot;apparittori&quot; are people who precede funerals, and the 1st class is the commissaries who oversee both of the lower two classes.

Another story/rumor is spread to back up the spider witch poison theory.

The end of August 1630 sees the death in Milan of the original villains of the story. It happens like so, back in Don Rodrigo&#x27;s place, he is joyful and makes fun of the so-called illness. Until, one night after a party he catches the plague. In his fright, trusts Grizo to go get a doctor for him. Grizo betrays him for Don Roderick&#x27;s riches and turns him into the &quot;monatti&quot;. Grizo is then hit by karma when his greed to check for money in Don Roderigo&#x27;s clothes makes him fall ill too, and dies quickly.

Renzo, troubled by Agnese&#x27;s letters and recovering from plague, finally decides to search out Lucia. He returns to his native village to find that many of the inhabitants are dead and that his house and vineyard have been destroyed. He also finds Tony there, sick and brain damaged. The people put money in a bowl of vinegar to clean it from the plague.

There is a new way of life during the plague Renzo sees while traveling. Those who have survived the plague walk boldly while those who are healthy and have not, are fearful.

Renzo also finds Don Abbondio and gets information on what has happened. Don Abbondio urges him to go back, Renzo refuses. The warrant, and Don Rodrigo, are forgotten. A childhood friend of Renzo&#x27;s tells him that Lucia is in Milan. He travels to Milan.

=== Chapters 34–38: Conclusion ===
On his arrival in Milan, Renzo is astonished at the state of the city. In Milan, it is mostly deserted. People are very wary and sad. Renzo sees all the empty houses and a mourning mother. His highland clothes invite suspicion that he is an &quot;anointer&quot;; that is, a foreign agent deliberately spreading plague in some way. He learns that Lucia is now languishing at the Lazzaretto of Milan, along with 16,000 other victims of the plague.

While trying to ask for directions he is accused of having the spider poison. In the paranoia, everyone in the city believes it. Renzo is then caught between the growing mob and the &quot;monatti&quot;. The &quot;monatti&quot; grab Renzo and save him.

In the &quot;monatti&quot; cart, Renzo is ill at ease. The &quot;monatti&quot; act like bullies and cheer to the never end of the plague. After riding for a bit, they reach the &quot;lazaretto&quot;. Renzo escapes the monatti and sees all the sick people. Chapter 33 ends with Renzo stepping over the threshold of the &quot;lazaretto&quot; hoping to find Lucia.

But in fact, Lucia is already recuperating. Renzo and Lucia are reunited by Fra Cristoforo, but only after Renzo first visits and forgives the dying Don Rodrigo. The friar absolves her of her vow of celibacy. Renzo walks through a rainstorm to see Agnese at the village of Pasturo. When they all return to their native village, Lucia and Renzo are finally married by Don Abbondio and the couple make a fresh start at a silk-mill at the gates of Bergamo.

== Characters ==

* Lorenzo &quot;Renzo&quot; Tramaglino is a young silk-weaver of humble origins, engaged to Lucia, whom he loves deeply. Initially rather naïve, he becomes more worldly wise during the story as he is confronted with many difficulties: he is separated from Lucia and then unjustly accused of being a criminal. Renzo is somewhat hot-tempered, but also gentle and honest.
* Lucia Mondella is a kind young woman who loves Renzo; she is pious and devoted, but also very shy and demure. She is forced to flee from her village to escape from Don Rodrigo in one of the most famous scenes of Italian literature, the &quot;Addio ai Monti&quot; or &quot;Farewell to the mountains&quot;.
* is a Catholic priest who refuses to marry Renzo and Lucia because he has been threatened by Don Rodrigo&#x27;s men; he meets the two protagonists several times during the novel. The cowardly, morally mediocre Don Abbondio provides most of the book&#x27;s comic relief; however, he is not merely a stock character, as his moral failings are portrayed by Manzoni with a mixture of irony, sadness and pity, as has been noted by Luigi Pirandello in his essay &quot;On Humour&quot; (&quot;Saggio sull&#x27;Umorismo&quot;).
* Fra Cristoforo is a brave and generous friar who helps Renzo and Lucia, acting as a sort of &quot;father figure&quot; to both and as the moral compass of the novel. Fra Cristoforo was the son of a wealthy family, and joined the Capuchin Order after killing a man.
* Don Rodrigo is a cruel and despicable Spanish nobleman and the novel&#x27;s main villain. As overbearing local baron, he decides to forcibly prevent the marriage of Renzo and Lucia, threatens to kill Don Abbondio if he marries the two and tries to kidnap Lucia. He is a clear reference to the foreign domination and oppression in Lombardy, first dominated by Spain and later by the Austrian Empire.

* L&#x27;Innominato (literally: the Unnamed) is probably the novel&#x27;s most complex character, a powerful and feared criminal of very high family who is torn between his ferocious past and the increasing disgust that he feels for his life. Based on the historical character of Francesco Bernardino Visconti, who was really converted by a visit of Federigo Borromeo.
* Agnese Mondella is Lucia&#x27;s mother: goodhearted and sagacious but often indiscreet.
* Federigo Borromeo is a virtuous and zealous cardinal; an actual historical character, younger cousin of Saint Charles Borromeo.
* Perpetua is Don Abbondio&#x27;s loquacious servant.
* La monaca di Monza (The Nun of Monza) is a tragic figure, a bitter, frustrated, sexually deprived and ambiguous woman. She befriends Lucia and becomes genuinely fond of her, but her dark past haunts her. This character is based on an actual woman, Marianna de Leyva.
* Griso is one of Don Rodrigo&#x27;s henchmen, a silent and treacherous man.
* Dr. Azzeccagarbugli (&quot;Quibble-weaver&quot;) is a corrupt lawyer.
* Count Attilio is Don Rodrigo&#x27;s malevolent cousin.
* Nibbio (literally &quot;kite (bird)&quot;) is the Innominato&#x27;s right-hand man, who precedes and then happily follows his master&#x27;s way of redemption.
* Don Ferrante is a phony intellectual and erudite scholar who believes the plague is caused by astrological forces.
* Donna Prassede is Don Ferrante&#x27;s wife, who is willing to help Lucia but is also an opinionated busybody.

== Significance ==
The novel is commonly described as &quot;the most widely read work in the Italian language.&quot; It became a model for subsequent Italian literary fiction. Scholar Sergio Pacifici states that no other Italian literary work, with the exception of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, &quot;has been the object of more intense scrutiny or more intense scholarship.&quot;

Many Italians believe that the novel is not fully appreciated abroad. In Italy the novel is considered a true masterpiece of world literature and a basis for the modern Italian language, and as such is widely studied in Italian secondary schools (usually in the second year, when students are 15). Many expressions, quotes and names from the novel are still commonly used in Italian, such as &quot;Perpetua&quot; (meaning a priest&#x27;s house worker) or &quot;Questo matrimonio non s&#x27;ha da fare&quot; (&quot;This marriage is not to be performed&quot;, used ironically).

The novel is not only about love and power: the great questions about evil, about innocents suffering, are the underlying theme of the book. The chapters 31–34, about the famine and the plague, are a powerful picture of material and moral devastation. Manzoni does not offer simple answers but leaves those questions open for the reader to meditate on. The main idea, proposed throughout the novel, is that, against the many injustices that they suffer in their life, the poor can only hope, at best, in a small anticipation of the divine justice, which can be expected in its entirety only in the afterlife: therefore life should be lived with faith and endurance, in the expectation of a reward in the afterlife.

&quot;The Betrothed&quot; has similarities with Walter Scott&#x27;s historic novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, although evidently distinct.

&quot;I promessi sposi&quot; was made into an opera of the same name by Amilcare Ponchielli in 1856 and by Errico Petrella in 1869. There have been many film versions of &quot;I promessi sposi&quot;, including &quot;I promessi sposi&quot; (1908), &quot;The Betrothed&quot; (1941) &quot;The Betrothed&quot; (1990), and &quot;Renzo and Lucia&quot;, made for television in 2004. A &quot;modern opera&quot; version, called &quot;The Betrothed Lovers&quot;, was written and produced by Michele Guardi with music by Pippo Flora, and first performed in 2010.

In May 2015, at a weekly general audience at St. Peter&#x27;s Square, Pope Francis asked engaged couples to read the novel for edification before marriage.

<doc id="724309" wikidata="Q2721268" url="?curid=724309" title="Names of Jerusalem">
<text>Names of Jerusalem refers to the multiple names by which the city of Jerusalem has been known and the etymology of the word in different languages. According to the Jewish Midrash, &quot;Jerusalem has 70 names&quot;. Lists have been compiled of 72 different Hebrew names for Jerusalem in Jewish scripture.

Today, Jerusalem is called Yerushalayim () and Al-Quds (). &quot;Yerushalayim&quot; is a derivation of a much older name, recorded as early as in the Middle Bronze Age, which has however been repeatedly re-interpreted in folk etymology, notably in Biblical Greek, where the first element of the name came to be associated with (&quot;hieros&quot;, &quot;holy&quot;). The city is also known, especially among Muslims, as Bayt al-Maqdis (), referring to the Temple in Jerusalem, called &quot;Beit HaMikdash&quot; in Hebrew.

==Early extra-biblical and biblical names==

===Jerusalem===
A city called &quot;Ꜣwšꜣmm&quot; in the Execration texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 19th century BCE) and typically reconstructed as &quot;(U)Rušalim&quot; is usually identified as Jerusalem. Nadav Na&#x27;aman proposed that the name should instead be understood as &quot;r&#x27;š&quot; (head) + &quot;rmm&quot; (exalted), meaning &#x27;the exalted head&#x27;, and so not referring to Jerusalem, but Na&#x27;aman withdrew this objection in 2023.

Jerusalem is called either ()
or () in the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba (1330s BCE).

The Sumero-Akkadian name for Jerusalem, &quot;uru-salim&quot;, is variously etymologised to mean &quot;foundation of [or: by] the god Shalim&quot;: from West Semitic &quot;yrw,&quot; ‘to found, to lay a cornerstone’, and Shalim, the Canaanite god of the setting sun and the nether world, as well as of health and perfection.

&quot;Jerusalem&quot; is the name most commonly used in the Bible, and the name used by most of the Western World. The Biblical Hebrew form is Yerushalaim (), adopted in Biblical Greek as Hierousalēm, &quot;Ierousalēm&quot; (), or Hierosolyma, &quot;Ierosolyma&quot; (), and in early Christian Bibles as Syriac Ūrišlem () as well as Latin &#x27; or &#x27;. In Arabic, this name occurs in the form Ūrsālim () which is the Arabic name promoted by the Israeli government.

The name &quot;Shalem&quot;, whether as a town or a deity, is derived from the same root Š-L-M as the word &quot;shalom&quot;, meaning peace, so that the common interpretation of the name is now &quot;The City of Peace&quot; or &quot;Abode of Peace&quot;, indicating a sanctuary.

The ending &quot;-ayim&quot; indicates the dual in Hebrew, thus leading to the suggestion that the name refers to the two hills on which the city sits. However, the pronunciation of the last syllable as &quot;-ayim&quot; appears to be a late development, which had not yet appeared at the time of the Septuagint. In fact, in the unvocalized Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible the &quot;yod&quot; that would be required for the &quot;-ayim&quot; ending (so that it would be written , as in post-biblical Hebrew, rather than ) is almost always absent. It is only the much later vocalization, with the vowel marks for &quot;a&quot; and &quot;i&quot; squeezed together between the lamed and the mem, that provides the basis for this reading. In extra-biblical inscriptions, the earliest known example of the &quot;-ayim&quot; ending was discovered on a column about 3 km west of ancient Jerusalem, dated to the first century BCE.

In Genesis Rabbah 56:10, the name is interpreted as a combination of &quot;yir&#x27;eh&quot;, &quot;He will see [to it],&quot; and &quot;Shalem&quot;, the city of King Melchizedek (based on Genesis 14:18). A similar theory is offered by Philo in his discussion of the term &quot;God&#x27;s city.&quot; Other midrashim say that Jerusalem means &quot;City of Peace&quot;.

In Greek, the city is called either &quot;Ierousalēm&quot; (Ἰερουσαλήμ) or &quot;Hierosolyma&quot; (Ἱεροσόλυμα). The latter exhibits yet another re-etymologization, by association with the word &quot;hieros&quot; (, &quot;holy&quot;). In early Greek manuscripts, is presented as a &quot;holy name&quot;: .

===Shalem===
The name Shalem/Salem (שלם &quot;šālêm&quot;) is found in the account of Melchizedek in : &quot;And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God&quot; (El Elyon).

That the name Salem refers to Jerusalem is evidenced by Psalm 76:2 which uses &quot;Salem&quot; as a parallel for &quot;Zion&quot;, the citadel of Jerusalem. The same identification is made by Josephus and the Aramaic translations of the Bible.

Shalem was the Canaanite god of dusk, sunset, and the end of the day, also spelled Shalim. Many scholars believe that his name is preserved in the name of the city Jerusalem. It is believed by some scholars that the name of Jerusalem comes from Uru + Shalem, meaning the foundation of Shalem or founded by Shalem or city of Shalem, and that Shalem was the city god of the place before El Elyon.

===Zion===

Mount Zion ( &quot;Har Tsiyyon&quot;) was originally the name of the hill where the Jebusite fortress stood, but the name was later applied to the Temple Mount just to the north of the fortress, also known as Mount Moriah, possibly also referred to as &quot;Daughter of Zion&quot; (i.e., as a protrusion of Mount Zion proper).

From the Second Temple era, the name came to be applied to a hill just to the south-west of the walled city. This latter hill is still known as Mount Zion today. From the point of view of the Babylonian exile (6th century BCE), &quot;Zion&quot; has come to be used as a synonym of the city of Jerusalem as a whole.

===Other biblical names===
*Mount Moriah (now usually identified with the Temple Mount) was a part of Jebus (), a city inhabited by the Jebusites. According to the Bible, this land was sold to King David by Ornan the Jebusite for six hundred shekels of gold (1Chr 21:26) in order to build in the threshing floor an altar for sacrifice to stop the plague God had sent upon Israel. Solomon later built the Temple there. The Jebusite stronghold at that time was called Zion which David took by force, and it afterward began to be called The City of David. ()

==Middle Persian==
According to &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, ancient Iranian used &quot;Kangdezh Hûkht&quot; &quot;کَـنْـگ دِژ هُـوْخْـت&quot; or &quot;Dezhkang Hûkht&quot; دِژ کَـنْـگ هُـوْخْـت to name Jerusalem. &quot;Kang Diz Huxt&quot; means &quot;holy palace&quot; and was the capital of &quot;Zahhak&quot; and also &quot;Fereydun&#x27;s&quot; kingdom.
 Another variant of the name is Kang-e Dozhhûkht (Dozhhûkht-Kang), which is attested in Shahnameh. It means &quot;[the] accursed Kang&quot;.

==Greco-Roman==
Aelia Capitolina was the Roman name given to Jerusalem in the 2nd century, after the destruction of the Second Temple. The name refers to Hadrian&#x27;s family, the &quot;gens Aelia&quot;, and to the hill temple of Jupiter built on the remains of the Temple.
During the later Roman Era, the city was expanded to the area now known as the Old City of Jerusalem. Population increased during this period, peaking at several hundred thousand, numbers only reached again in the modern city, in the 1960s.

From this name derives Tiberian Hebrew &quot;ʼÊliyyāh Qappîṭôlînāh&quot;. The Roman name was loaned as , early in the Middle Ages, and appears in some Hadith (Bukhari 1:6, 4:191; Muwatta 20:26), like Bayt ul-Maqdis.

==Islamic==
Jerusalem fell to the Muslim conquest of Palestine in 638.
The medieval city corresponded to what is now known as the Old City (rebuilt in the 2nd century as Roman &quot;Aelia Capitolina&quot;). The population at the time of the Muslim conquest was about 200,000, but from about the 10th century it declined, to less than half that number by the time of the Christian conquest in the 11th century, and with the re-conquest by the Khwarezmi Turks was further decimated to about 2,000 people (moderately recovering to some 8,000 under Ottoman rule by the 19th century).

The modern Arabic name of Jerusalem is اَلْـقُـدْس al-Quds, and its first recorded use can be traced to the 9th century CE, two hundred years after the Muslim conquest of the city. Prior to the use of this name, the names used for Jerusalem were إِيْـلْـيَـاء Īlyā&#x27; (from the Roman era name) and بَـيْـت الْـمَـقْـدِس Bayt al-Maqdis (after the Temple), alternatively vocalized as بَـيْـت الْـمُـقَـدَّس Bayt al-Muqaddas.

Al-Quds is the most common Arabic name for Jerusalem and is used by many cultures influenced by Islam. The name may have been shortened from مَـدِيـنَـة الْـقُـدْس Madīnat al-Quds, a calque of the Hebrew nickname for the city, &quot;Ir HaKodesh&quot; (עיר הקודש &quot;the Holy City&quot; or &quot;City of the Holy Place&quot;). The variant اَلْـقُـدْس الـشَّـرِيْـف al-Quds aš-Šarīf (&quot;Al-Quds the Noble&quot;) has also been used, notably by the Ottomans in the Turkish form Kudüs-i Şerîf.
* Azerbaijani – Yerusəlim, Qüds, or Qüdsi-Şərif
* Kurdish – / &quot;Orşelîm&quot; or /&quot;Quds&quot;, 
* Persian – , &quot;Qods&quot;
* Standard Hebrew – , &quot;HaKodesh&quot;
* Tiberian Hebrew – , &quot;HaQodhesh&quot; &quot;The Holy&quot;
* Turkish – Kudüs or Yeruşalim
* Urdu – , &quot;Quds&quot;, , &quot;Quds Śarīf&quot; or , &quot;Yaroślam&quot;

Bayt al-Maqdis or Bayt al-Muqaddas is a less commonly used Arabic name for Jerusalem though it appeared more commonly in early Islamic sources. It is the base from which nisbas (names based on the origin of the person named) are formed – hence the famous medieval geographer called both al-Maqdisi and al-Muqaddasi ( 946) This name is of a semantic extension from the Hadiths used in reference to the Temple in Jerusalem, called &quot;Beit HaMikdash&quot; (בית המקדש &quot;The Holy Temple&quot; or &quot;Temple of the Sanctified Place&quot;) in Hebrew.

* Avar – Байтул Макъдис, &quot;Baytul Maqdis&quot;
* Azerbaijani – Beytül-Müqəddəs
* Indonesian – Baitulmaqdis
* Kurdish – / &quot;Beytî Muqeddes&quot; 
* Malay – Baitulmuqaddis
* Persian – , &quot;Beit-e Moghaddas&quot;
* Turkish Beyt-i Mukaddes
* Urdu – , &quot;Bait-ul-Muqaddas&quot;

 al-Balāṭ is a rare poetic name for Jerusalem in Arabic, loaned from the Latin &quot;palatium&quot; &quot;palace&quot;. Also from Latin is إِيْـلْـيَـاء ʼĪlyāʼ, a rare name for Jerusalem used in early times Middle Ages, as in some Hadith (Bukhari 1:6, 4:191; Muwatta 20:26).

&quot;Ṣahyūn&quot; (, &quot;Ṣahyūn&quot; or &quot;Ṣihyūn&quot;) is the word for Zion in Arabic and Syriac. Drawing on biblical tradition, it is one of the names accorded to Jerusalem in Arabic and Islamic tradition.

<text>Dark Angel is an American thrash metal band from Downey, California, formed in 1981. The band&#x27;s current lineup includes drummer Gene Hoglan, guitarists Eric Meyer and Laura Christine, frontman Ron Rinehart and bassist Mike Gonzalez. In its history, they have gone through many lineup changes, and as of guitarist Jim Durkin&#x27;s death on March 8, 2023, there are no original members left in the current lineup of Dark Angel, although Meyer (who joined the band in 1984) is the only member to appear on all of their studio albums.

Dark Angel&#x27;s over-the-top style (extremely fast, heavy and lengthy songs with many tempo changes, lyrics, and extended instrumental parts) earned them the nickname &quot;The L.A. Caffeine Machine&quot;. Despite never achieving mainstream success, the band is often credited as one of the leaders of the second wave of the 1980s thrash metal movement, and as one of the progenitors of the &quot;progressive/technical thrash metal&quot; sound. Their music has also been cited as a formative influence to the death metal genre.

Dark Angel has released four studio albums to date: &quot;We Have Arrived&quot; (1985), &quot;Darkness Descends&quot; (1986), &quot;Leave Scars&quot; (1989) and &quot;Time Does Not Heal&quot; (1991). Following their first disbandment in 1992, and a brief reunion from 2002 to 2005, the band reunited once again in 2013. They are currently working on new material for their fifth studio album.

==History==
===Early years (1981–1991)===

Dark Angel was formed in 1981 under the name Shellshock in Downey, California, right around the time when the Bay Area thrash metal movement was beginning to take place. They were forced to change their name to Dark Angel in 1983, due to another band using the Shellshock name. They played in local bars and clubs, acquiring a cult following in the metal underground. The band was often compared to Slayer. The band began recording and releasing several demos before releasing their debut studio album &quot;We Have Arrived&quot; in March 1985. Dark Angel promoted &quot;We Have Arrived&quot; with its first ever tour, opening for bands like Slayer, Megadeth, Venom, Savage Grace, Corrosion of Conformity, Possessed, D.R.I., Exodus and Agent Steel.
In November 1986, Dark Angel released its second studio album, &quot;Darkness Descends&quot;, which is widely considered to be their seminal release. Around the same time, several other thrash metal bands such as Metallica also released seminal albums and started to gain more popularity. Dark Angel drummer Gene Hoglan said, &quot;If &quot;Darkness Descends&quot; had come out in August or September instead of November 1986, perhaps things would have been slightly different. Maybe more people would have said, &#x27;Hey, this band is pretty cool,&#x27; instead of, &#x27;Well, we had &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; last month, and everything sucks after that.&#x27; [&quot;Laughs&quot;] People were pretty ruthless back then — they would call us &#x27;Slayer babies&#x27; and things like that.&quot; Although &quot;Darkness Descends&quot; did not initially reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts or become a commercial success, Dark Angel toured heavily behind the album throughout 1986 and 1987, playing with bands like Motörhead, Megadeth, Possessed, Slayer, Overkill, Sacred Reich, Whiplash, Cryptic Slaughter and the Crumbsuckers. In early 1987, in the middle of the &quot;Darkness Descends&quot; tour, Doty left the band in order to start a family. Hoglan recalled, &quot;Sometimes it was a challenge just to get him to rehearsals. But back then I was very naive when it came to drugs and other ancillary activities that one might be involved in — it wasn&#x27;t a part of my life, so I didn&#x27;t really pay attention to things like that. So I didn&#x27;t think we had many problems as a band, but it started to become more obvious between the release of the record in November 1986 and the start of the tour with Possessed in January 1987. And obviously, the real sign that something was wrong was when he backed out of the tour just a few days before the first date, which forced us to hire Jim Drabos to replace him.&quot; 

Jim Drabos proved to be a temporary replacement, and left the band and became a police officer after the tour. Doty was replaced by Ron Rinehart, who would stay with the band until their breakup in 1992 and rejoin for their subsequent reunions. Dark Angel performed its first show with Rinehart at the Fender&#x27;s Ballroom in Long Beach, California on January 29, 1988.

Around this time, Dave Mustaine asked guitarist Eric Meyer to join Megadeth, but he declined in order to stay with Dark Angel. According to an interview in Voices from the Dark Side, Meyer claims he did not feel comfortable with the situation.

In January 1989, Dark Angel released its third studio album &quot;Leave Scars&quot;, which was their first release with Rinehart on vocals and Mike Gonzalez on bass, and their last with guitarist Jim Durkin, who left the band during a tour with Death and was replaced by former Viking guitarist Brett Eriksen, leaving the band with no remaining original members. Hogland recalled Durkin&#x27;s departure, &quot;It’s a rather nebulous story, and I’ve never really gone into it with Jim, but there was something going on in his life that mandated that he pretty much leave the tour right this minute. He never came to any of us and said what was going on, and I admit that I wasn’t the happiest about it at the time. But Jim was my brother and my friend. And not long after he left, we got in touch with each other and talked, and I told Jim that I just wanted him to be happy. But we’ve never really spoken about why he left — there are details there that I don’t need to know.&quot; &quot;Leave Scars&quot; also became Dark Angel&#x27;s only album to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, peaking at number 159. &quot;Leave Scars&quot; received positive reviews from music critics, and saw the band garner media attention and publicity, with coverage from &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and &quot;RIP Magazine&quot;. In support of the album, they toured throughout 1989 and 1990 with several bands, including Death, Nuclear Assault, Acid Reign, Candlemass and Overkill. A live album, recorded at the Country Club in Reseda on April 22, 1989, was released in 1990 as &quot;Live Scars&quot;.

Dark Angel released their fourth studio album, &quot;Time Does Not Heal&quot;, in February 1991. &quot;Time Does Not Heal&quot; showed increasingly progressive song structures (famously advertising its &quot;246 riffs&quot;), and Hoglan&#x27;s lyrics dealing with social issues, including politics, apathy, psychological issues and trauma. To promote &quot;Time Does Not Heal&quot;, Dark Angel embarked on the &quot;Years of Pain&quot; world tour, supported by such bands as Exhorder, Mordred and Re-Animator.

===First breakup (1992–1999)===
Rinehart&#x27;s departure from the band, as well as aborted attempts to work on a fifth album, resulted in Dark Angel&#x27;s first breakup in September 1992. Hoglan has indicated this was an amicable split, telling &quot;Heavy&quot; magazine in 2019 that, &quot;We&#x27;ve always been close and tight. We never went our separate ways out of animosity by any means. It was just time to make a move back in &#x27;92 when we kind of dissolved Dark Angel, I guess.&quot;

Hoglan went on to collaborate on a number of musical projects. He achieved greater attention during the mid-1990s playing with Death, at the same time that bandleader Chuck Schuldiner was taking his band into a more progressive style. Subsequently, he recorded one album with Bay Area thrash metal band Testament, and made the acquaintance of Canadian multi-instrumentalist Devin Townsend, forging a lasting friendship. He had since recorded several albums with Townsend, both as part of the speed/industrial/death metal band Strapping Young Lad and under Devin Townsend&#x27;s name.

Rinehart formed the band Oil in 1997 after converting to Christianity.

===First reunion and second hiatus (1999–2005)===
Tentative plans for a Dark Angel reunion tour in 1999 were scrapped, due to personal and artistic differences between its members. However, the band officially reformed in 2002 with a new lineup that included Ron Rinehart on vocals, Eric Meyer on guitar, Danyael Williams on bass and Gene Hoglan on drums.

During this reunion, Dark Angel recorded a cover of &quot;Creeping Death&quot;, which appeared on the 2004 Metallica tribute album &quot;Metallic Attack: The Ultimate Tribute&quot;.

By 2005, Rinehart had begun suffering health problems, and an accident that year, which caused a severe spinal injury that was apparently so serious, that if Rinehart had continued singing it could have resulted in him being unable to talk, thus ending Dark Angel&#x27;s reunion.

===Second reunion, upcoming fifth studio album, and deaths of band members (2013–present)===
On August 10, 2013, it was reported that Dark Angel had reunited with original vocalist Don Doty, and would headline Keep It True XVII festival in Germany in April 2014. It was also reported that drummer Gene Hoglan, guitarists Eric Meyer and Justin Zych, and bassist Mike Gonzalez would be involved in the reunion.

On August 16, 2013, six days after the &quot;reunion&quot; was announced, Doty and Hoglan released statements addressing the &quot;reunion rumors&quot; in an attempt to &quot;put any confusion to rest.&quot; Hoglan admitted that he and the members of Dark Angel had been &quot;talking about doing something&quot; in 2014, and stated that some shows could be in the works, but &quot;right now it&#x27;s just speculation.&quot; Hoglan also stated that, due to his commitments with Testament and Dethklok, the band was &quot;moving forward s-l-o-w-l-y.&quot; Doty also commented on the reunion rumors, stating, &quot;When talks are complete, a statement will be given. We will know more in the months to come. We will let you know as it unravels.&quot; When asked on August 21, 2013, about the reunion, Hoglan replied, &quot;The latest is that we are talking about doing one. We will definitely keep everybody posted when there is something solid to talk about.&quot;

On September 4, 2013, Dark Angel&#x27;s management confirmed that the band would be reuniting for &quot;limited number of appearances in the U.S. and select festivals in Europe&quot; in 2014, and added that the dates were &quot;still pending&quot; and had &quot;not yet been booked at this time.&quot; Their management also confirmed that the lineup for the &quot;rare and unique, select 2014 shows&quot; was the &quot;Leave Scars&quot; lineup of Gene Hoglan (drums), Jim Durkin (guitar), Ron Rinehart (vocals) and Michael Gonzalez (bass). On the following day, it was announced that Dark Angel had been dropped from the Keep It True XVII festival due to multiple issues with the reunion.

On October 13, 2013, Dark Angel confirmed that they were officially active again, and posted a 17-second rehearsal clip, titled &quot;DFA is back!&quot;, on YouTube.

On November 1, 2014, it was announced that Dark Angel was working on new material.

On April 5, 2016, it was announced that Dark Angel would celebrate their 30th anniversary by playing a show on October 8 at the Vogue Theatre in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. At that show, they were going to play the &quot;Darkness Descends&quot; album in its entirety as well as songs from their 1991 album &quot;Time Does Not Heal&quot;. The concert was cancelled &quot;due to circumstances beyond [the band&#x27;s] control.&quot;

By November 2017, the band was still in the process of writing their forthcoming new album, according to Gene Hoglan. When asked in October 2018 by &quot;The Aquarian Weekly&quot; about the status of the album, Rinehart stated, &quot;You know, I honestly feel this, if all of us could get in the same place for a certain amount of time. It would be something that is easy to do. That being said it&#x27;s hard to get the world&#x27;s greatest drummer who travels with everybody, Gonz in New Mexico, and me here in Washington. We have a lot of great ideas and awesome riffs. Every time I hear a new riff I just get super excited. I would rather wait and have something be amazing, than rush and have something be crap.&quot;

In a February 2019 interview with Agoraphobic News, Hoglan stated that Dark Angel had &quot;5 or 6 songs on the go&quot; and that their new album would be released &quot;by the end of this year or by 2020.&quot; The album&#x27;s release date was later pushed back to 2021. During his appearance on Death Angel guitarist Ted Aguilar&#x27;s &quot;Alive &amp; Streaming&quot; internet show in August 2020, Hoglan revealed that the band was still &quot;attempting to write&quot; their new album. He again reiterated the album&#x27;s slow progress in September 2021. In a January 2022 stream on Twitch, shortly after writing a new Dark Angel song and departing from Testament, Hoglan revealed that the band was &quot;moving forward&quot; with writing a new album and they were intending &quot;to be in the studio before the end of this year.&quot; In an interview done in August 2022, Hoglan said the album was likely to be released in mid-2023.

On March 8, 2023, founding guitarist Jim Durkin died at the age of 58, leaving the band with no original members. Durkin had been inactive since 2020 due to personal matters, and he requested Hoglan&#x27;s wife Laura Christine to take his place. After Durkin&#x27;s death, the band announced that they would be continuing in his memory with Christine, and that their upcoming album would be released in 2023 or 2024. Hoglan has stated that the album would serve as a tribute to Durkin. On July 25, 2024, Hoglan confirmed in a video message posted on social media that Dark Angel has begun recording their new album and he had &quot;just finished the drums to&quot; it.

Former Dark Angel drummer Lee Rauch died on June 25, 2023 at the age of 58.

<doc id="724311" wikidata="Q225852" url="?curid=724311" title="D. A. Pennebaker">
<text>Donn Alan Pennebaker (; July 15, 1925 – August 1, 2019) was an American documentary filmmaker and one of the pioneers of direct cinema. Performing arts and politics were his primary subjects. In 2013, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized his body of work with an Academy Honorary Award. Pennebaker was called by &quot;The Independent&quot; as &quot;arguably the pre-eminent chronicler of Sixties counterculture&quot;.

He received an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature nomination for &quot;The War Room&quot; (1993). He is also known for directing documentaries such as &quot;Dont Look Back&quot; (1967), &quot;Monterey Pop&quot; (1968), &quot;Original Cast Album: Company&quot; (1971), &quot;Eat the Document&quot; (1972), &quot;Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; (1979), &quot;Jimi Plays Monterey&quot; (1986), &quot;Elaine Stritch: At Liberty&quot; (2004), and &quot;Kings of Pastry&quot; (2009).

==Early life and education ==
Pennebaker (known as &quot;Penny&quot; to his friends) was born in Evanston, Illinois, the son of Lucille Levick (née Deemer) and John Paul Pennebaker, who was a commercial photographer. Pennebaker served in the Navy during World War II. He then studied engineering at Yale and later worked as an engineer, founding Electronics Engineering (the makers of the first computerized airline reservation system) before beginning his film career.

== Career ==
===1953–1960===
After falling under the influence of experimental filmmaker Francis Thompson, Pennebaker directed his first film, &quot;Daybreak Express&quot;, in 1953. Set to a classic Duke Ellington recording of the same name, the five-minute short features a shadowy montage of the soon-to-be-demolished Third Avenue elevated subway in New York City.
It was released in 1958. According to Pennebaker, Ellington responded favourably to the film.

In 1959, Pennebaker joined the equipment-sharing Filmakers’ Co-op and co-founded Drew Associates with Richard Leacock and former &quot;LIFE&quot; magazine editor and correspondent Robert Drew. A crucial moment in the development of direct cinema, the collective produced documentary films for clients like ABC News (for their television series, &quot;Close-up&quot;) and Time-Life Broadcast (for their syndicated television series, &quot;Living Camera&quot;). Their first major film, &quot;Primary&quot; (1960), documented John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey&#x27;s respective campaigns in the 1960 Wisconsin Democratic Primary election. Drew, Leacock and Pennebaker, as well as photographers Albert Maysles, Terrence McCartney Filgate and Bill Knoll, all filmed the campaigning from dawn to midnight over the course of five days. Widely considered to be the first candid and comprehensive look at the day-by-day events of a Presidential race, it was the first film in which the sync sound camera could move freely with characters throughout a breaking story, a major technical achievement that laid the groundwork for modern-day documentary filmmaking. It would later be selected as an historic American film for inclusion in the Library of Congress&#x27; National Film Registry in 1990.

===1963–1968===
Drew Associates would produce nine more documentaries for &quot;Living Camera&quot;, including &quot;&quot;, which chronicled President Kennedy and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s conflict with governor George Wallace over school desegregation. Then in 1963, Pennebaker and Leacock left the organization to form their own production firm, Leacock-Pennebaker, Inc. Pennebaker would direct a number of short films over the course of two years. One of them was a rare recording of jazz vocalist Dave Lambert as he formed a new quintet with singers such as David Lucas and auditioned for RCA. The audition was not successful, and Lambert died suddenly in a car accident shortly thereafter, leaving Pennebaker&#x27;s film as one of the few visual recordings of the singer, and the only recording of the songs in those rehearsals. The documentary got attention in Europe, and a few weeks later, Bob Dylan&#x27;s manager Albert Grossman approached Pennebaker about filming Dylan while he was touring in England. The resulting work &quot;Dont Look Back&quot; (there is no apostrophe in the title) became a landmark in both film and rock history, &quot;evoking the &#x27;60s like few other documents&quot;, according to film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum. The opening sequence alone (set to Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; with Dylan standing in an alleyway, dropping cardboard flash cards) became a precursor to modern music videos. It was even used as the theatrical trailer. It would later be included in the Library of Congress&#x27; National Film Registry in 1998, and it was later ranked at No. 6 on &quot;Time Out&quot;″s list of the 50 best documentaries of all time.

Pennebaker would also film Dylan&#x27;s subsequent tour of England in 1966, but while some of this work has been released in different forms (supplying the framework for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s Dylan documentary &quot;No Direction Home&quot; and re-edited by Dylan himself in the rarely distributed &quot;Eat the Document&quot;), Pennebaker&#x27;s own film of the tour (&quot;Something Is Happening&quot;) remains unreleased. Nevertheless, the tour itself has become one of the most celebrated events in rock history, and some of the Nagra recordings made for Pennebaker&#x27;s film were later released on Dylan&#x27;s own records. All of the Nagra recordings made during the 1966 European appearances were made by Richard Alderson, who, for years, never received recognition. All of his tapes are what comprise the 36-CD box set &quot;Bob Dylan: The 1966 Live Recordings&quot;, released in 2016. It is Alderson who notes that many of the UK concerts were, in fact, filmed by Howard Alk.

The same year &quot;Dont Look Back&quot; was released in theaters, Pennebaker worked with author Norman Mailer (who would later appear in 1979&#x27;s &quot;Town Bloody Hall&quot;) on the first of many film collaborations. He was also hired to film the Monterey Pop Festival, which is now regarded as an important event in rock history on par with 1969&#x27;s Woodstock Festival. Pennebaker produced a number of films from the event, capturing breakthrough performances from the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Otis Redding and Janis Joplin that remain seminal documents in rock history. The first of these films, &quot;Monterey Pop&quot;, was released in 1968 and was later ranked at No. 42 on &quot;Time Out&quot;″s list of the 50 best documentaries of all time. Other performers including Jefferson Airplane and the Who also received major exposure from Pennebaker&#x27;s work.

===1970–1992===
Pennebaker continued to film some of the era&#x27;s most influential rock artists, including John Lennon (whom he first met while filming Dylan in England), Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and David Bowie during his &quot;farewell&quot; concert in 1973.

In 1970, Pennebaker filmed the cast recording session for Stephen Sondheim and George Furth&#x27;s musical, &quot;Company&quot;, shortly after the show opened on Broadway. The film was initially intended to be a television pilot chronicling recording processes of Broadway musicals, but despite wide acclaim the series was scrapped after the original producers left New York to head production at MGM. No other sessions were captured, and Pennebaker&#x27;s film remains the sole episode. &quot;Original Cast Album: Company&quot; received renewed attention after being parodied in the IFC television series &quot;Documentary Now!&quot; in 2019, then being added to The Criterion Channel&#x27;s streaming service the following year. In August 2021 a physical edition was released, including new commentary by Sondheim and commentary recorded in 2001 by Pennebaker, original director Hal Prince, and &quot;Company&quot; star Elaine Stritch.

Pennebaker was one of many participants in John Lennon and Yoko Ono&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;Up Your Legs Forever&quot;.

He also collaborated with Jean-Luc Godard, who had been impressed by &quot;Primary&quot;. Their initial plan was to film &quot;whatever we saw happening around us&quot; in a small town in France, but this never came to fruition. In 1968, the two worked on a film that Godard initially conceived as &quot;One AM&quot; (One American Movie) on the subject of anticipated mass struggles in the United States – similar to the uprisings in France that year. When it became clear that Godard&#x27;s assessment was incorrect, he abandoned the film. Pennebaker eventually finished the project himself and released it several years later as &quot;One PM&quot;, meaning &quot;One Perfect Movie&quot; to Pennebaker and &quot;One Pennebaker Movie&quot; to Godard.

Pennebaker&#x27;s film company was also a notable distributor of foreign films, including Godard&#x27;s &quot;La Chinoise&quot; (the American opening of which became the context for &quot;One PM&quot;), but the endeavor was ultimately a short-lived and costly business venture. Then around 1976, Pennebaker met experimental filmmaker turned documentarian Chris Hegedus. The two soon became collaborators and then married in 1982.

In 1977, Pennebaker lent his editing facility to Filipino documentarian Egay Navarro for him to edit the half-hour propaganda film &quot;Da Real Makoy&quot;, written and directed by cartoonist Nonoy Marcelo, narrated by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and produced by his daughter Imee Marcos.

In 1988, Pennebaker, Hegedus and David Dawkins followed Depeche Mode as they toured the U.S. in support of &quot;Music for the Masses&quot;, the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough in America. The resulting film, &quot;101&quot;, was released the following year, and prominently features a group of young fans travelling across America as winners of a &quot;be-in-a-Depeche-Mode-movie-contest,&quot; which culminates at Depeche Mode&#x27;s landmark concert at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. Because of this, the film is widely considered to be the impetus for the &quot;reality&quot; craze that swept MTV in the following years, including &quot;The Real World&quot; and &quot;Road Rules&quot;. In various interviews, DVD commentaries and on their own website, both Pennebaker and Hegedus have cited &quot;101&quot; as &quot;their favorite&quot; and &quot;the one that was the most fun to make&quot; out of all their films to date.

In 1992, during the start of the Democratic primaries, Pennebaker and Hegedus approached campaign officials for Arkansas governor Bill Clinton about filming his presidential run. They were granted limited access to the candidate but allowed to focus on lead strategist James Carville and communications director George Stephanopoulos. The resulting work, &quot;The War Room&quot;, became one of their most celebrated films, winning the award for Best Documentary from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures and earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature.

===Later career===
Pennebaker and Hegedus continued to produce a large number of documentary films through their company, Pennebaker Hegedus Films, most notably &quot;Moon Over Broadway&quot; (1998), &quot;Down from the Mountain&quot; (2001), &quot;Startup.com&quot; (2001), &quot;Elaine Stritch: At Liberty&quot; (2004), &quot;Al Franken: God Spoke&quot; (2006), and &quot;Kings of Pastry&quot; (2009).

In May 2010, they directed their first live show when they directed a YouTube webcast of the National performing a benefit show at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. That same year &quot;Kings of Pastry&quot; opened at multiple film festivals, including IDFA, Sheffield Doc/Fest, DOX BOX, the Berlin International Film Festival and Hot Docs, before premiering in New York City. In 2012 he was awarded a Governors Award, introduced by Michael Moore. In 2014 it was reported that Pennebaker, in collaboration with his wife, was working on a documentary focused on the Nonhuman Rights Project and its efforts to have certain animals, such as cetaceans, elephants, and apes, be classified as legal persons.

==Process and style==
Pennebaker usually shot his films with a hand-held camera and often eschewed voice-over narration and interviews in favor of a &quot;simple&quot; portrayal of events. In a 1971 interview with G. Roy Levin, Pennebaker said that &quot;it&#x27;s possible to go to a situation and simply film what you see there, what happens there, what goes on, and let everybody decide whether it tells them about any of these things. But you don&#x27;t have to label them, you don&#x27;t have to have the narration to instruct you so you can be sure and understand that it&#x27;s good for you to learn.&quot; In that same interview with Levin, Pennebaker went so far as to claim that &quot;Dont Look Back&quot; is &quot;not a documentary at all by my standards&quot;. He repeatedly asserted that he did not make documentaries, but &quot;records of moments&quot;, &quot;half soap operas&quot;, and &quot;semimusical reality things&quot;.

An accomplished engineer, Pennebaker developed one of the first fully portable, synchronized 16mm camera and sound recording systems which revolutionized modern filmmaking.

==Death and legacy==
Pennebaker died at his home in Sag Harbor, New York, on August 1, 2019.

His aesthetic and technical breakthroughs have also had a major influence on narrative filmmaking, influencing such realist masterworks as Barbara Loden&#x27;s &quot;Wanda&quot;, which was filmed and edited by one of Pennebaker&#x27;s protégés, Nicholas Proferes, and even acclaimed satires such as Tim Robbins&#x27; &quot;Bob Roberts&quot;.

His style has also been spoofed by Weird Al Yankovic and the Emmy-nominated mockumentary series &quot;Documentary Now&quot;.

<text>David Salisbury Franks (1740–1793) was a lieutenant colonel in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He was one of two aides-de-camp for General Benedict Arnold during the war. Franks was officially exonerated and cleared of any complicity with General Arnold&#x27;s act of treason, and was later chosen to travel to Paris to deliver to Benjamin Franklin the official copy of the peace treaty that ended the war and granted American independence.

== Biography ==
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, David Salisbury Franks was living in Quebec with his parents when the American Revolution broke out. A Jew, Franks in 1775 was president of the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue of Montreal, the oldest Jewish congregation in Canada, but then less than a decade old (Franks&#x27; congregation should not be confused with a similarly named congregation in New York). According to the late historian Jacob Rader Marcus, Franks publicly defended the right of a protester to compare King George III to the Pope and call him a fool, and was subsequently jailed for 16 days. The experience convinced him to join the Patriot cause, and, when an American expedition led by Benedict Arnold and Richard Montgomery invaded Quebec in 1775, Franks joined them. He was appointed paymaster of the Continental Army in Quebec and apparently expended his own funds to pay the salaries of the American volunteers. Franks was promoted to major and was assigned as Arnold&#x27;s aide-de-camp.

On the failure of the American campaign in Canada, Franks withdrew in July 1776 to Philadelphia, where he joined the Continental Army and served until October 1777. Because he spoke French, Franks was then assigned as liaison officer to the Comte d&#x27;Estaing, commander of the French naval forces fighting on the American side.

Franks served as aide-de-camp to Arnold at West Point at the time of Arnold&#x27;s attempt to hand over the fort to the British. He and another subordinate, Richard Varick, were both cleared of complicity in Arnold&#x27;s treachery.

After Franks was returned to active duty, General George Washington had him assigned to his command. The other officers of Franks&#x27;s own regiment started a whispering campaign against him. Seeking to clear his name definitively, Franks asked General Washington to initiate another court-martial, one that would investigate—rather than simply drop—the scurrilous charges against him. After a month-long investigation, the court issued a thorough report completely exonerating Franks.

A promotion in rank immediately followed. Franks was entrusted to carry highly secret documents to diplomats Benjamin Franklin in Paris and John Jay in Madrid. In 1783, Franks returned to Philadelphia, but soon left for Paris to deliver to Franklin the official copy of the peace treaty that ended the war and granted American independence. According to his accounts, Franks often paid more of his expenses than his young nation could afford to reimburse.

At war&#x27;s end, Franks was made American vice-consul at Marseilles. In 1786, he served as American envoy in the treaty negotiations between the United States and the potentates of Morocco.

Despite his complete exoneration, the trust of Washington, and his long service to his country, Jeffersonian Republicans launched vicious attacks on Franks for his association with Arnold. In 1786, the attacks succeeded and Franks was dismissed from the diplomatic corps. He returned to the United States discredited and bankrupt.

Franks was given a grant of land for his services and a position in the Bank of the United States, but he died in poverty. After he succumbed to yellow fever in the great epidemic of 1793 in Philadelphia, he was saved from a pauper&#x27;s grave by a neighbor, who had him interred in Christ Church Burial Ground.

Franks was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati.

<text>Bougainville, an autonomous region of Papua New Guinea (PNG), has been inhabited by humans for at least 29,000 years, according to artefacts found in Kilu Cave on Buka Island. The region is named after Bougainville Island, the largest island of the Solomon Islands archipelago, but also contains a number of smaller islands.

The first arrivals in Bougainville were ethnically Australo-Melanesian, related to Papuans and Aboriginal Australians. Around 3,000 years ago, Austronesians associated with the Lapita culture also settled on the islands, bringing agriculture and pottery. Present-day Bougainvilleans are descended from a mixture of the two populations, and both Austronesian and non-Austronesian languages are spoken to this day.

In 1616, Dutch explorers Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire became the first Europeans to sight the islands. The main island was named after French admiral Louis Antoine de Bougainville, who reached it in 1768. The German Empire placed Bougainville under a protectorate in 1886, while the remainder of the Solomon Islands became part of the British Empire in 1893. The present-day boundaries between Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands were established by the Tripartite Convention of 1899. The incorporation of Bougainville into German New Guinea initially had little economic impact, although the associated Catholic missions succeeded in converting a majority of the islanders to Christianity.

The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&amp;MEF) occupied German New Guinea in 1914, following the outbreak of World War I. After the war&#x27;s end, Bougainville and the other occupied territories were named as a League of Nations mandate, which Australia administered as the Territory of New Guinea. During World War II, the Japanese invaded and occupied Bougainville in order to support their operations elsewhere in the Pacific. The subsequent Allied campaign to reclaim the islands resulted in heavy casualties and the eventual restoration of Australian control in 1945.

In 1949, following administrative reforms by the Australian government, Bougainville was incorporated into the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. The Panguna mine was established in 1969 and soon become a source of conflict. The Bougainville independence movement established the Republic of the North Solomons in 1975, but by the following year the newly independent PNG government had re-established control. Tensions continued, and the subsequent Bougainville Civil War (1988–1998) resulted in the deaths of thousands of people, as the Bougainville Revolutionary Army sought to secure independence and was resisted by the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. A peace agreement was reached in 2001, by which it was agreed that an autonomous region would be established and an independence referendum would be held; the latter was held in 2019.

==Prehistory==

The earliest known site of human occupation in Bougainville is Kilu Cave, located on Buka Island. The bottom-most archaeological deposits in the cave were radiocarbon-dated to between 28,700 and 20,100 years ago. During the Last Glacial Maximum, until approximately 10,000 years ago, present-day Bougainville Island was part of a single landmass known as &quot;Greater Bougainville&quot;, which spanned from the northern tip of Buka Island to the Nggela Islands north of Guadalcanal. The &quot;obvious immediate origin for its first colonists&quot; of Bougainville is the Bismarck Archipelago to the north, where sites have been identified dating back 35,000 to 40,000 years.

The first settlers of Bougainville were Melanesians, likely related to present-day Papuans and Aboriginal Australians. Approximately 3,000 years ago, a wave of Austronesian peoples arrived in Bougainville, bringing with them the Lapita culture. The Austronesians brought with them a fully agricultural lifestyle, also introducing distinctive pottery and domesticated pigs, dogs and chickens to Bougainville. The advent of the Lapita culture resulted in &quot;a pattern of apparent extinctions of birds and endemic mammals&quot;. Both Austronesian and non-Austronesian languages (historically called &quot;East Papuan&quot;) continue to be spoken on Bougainville today. There has been substantial genetic and cultural mixing between the Austronesian and non-Austronesian populations, &quot;such that language is no longer correlated with either genetics or culture in any direct or simplistic way&quot;.

Douglas Oliver in his 1991 book discussed one of the unique aspects of the people of Bougainville:
[A] trait shared by the present-day descendants of both northerners and southerners is their skin-colour, which is very black. Indeed, it is darker than that of any population of present-day Pacific islanders, including the present-day indigenes of New Ireland, the larger homeland of the first Bougainvilleans. The presence of Bougainville as a &#x27;black spot&#x27; in an island world of brownskins (later called redskins) raises a question that cannot now be answered. Were the genes producing that darker pigmentation carried by the first Bougainvilleans when they arrived? Or did they evolve by natural or &#x27;social&#x27; selection, during the millennia in which the descendants of those pioneers remained isolated, reproductively, from neighbouring islanders? Nothing now known about Bougainville&#x27;s physical environment can support an argument for the natural selection of its peoples&#x27; distinctively black pigmentation; therefore a case might be made for social selection, namely an aesthetic (and hence reproductive) preference for black skin.

==Early European contact==
Dutch explorers Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire were the first Europeans to sight present-day Bougainville, skirting Takuu Atoll and Nissan Island in 1616. In 1643, another Dutch expedition led by Abel Tasman was the first to make contact with the islanders and describe their appearance. There was no further European contact until 1767, when British naval officer Philip Carteret visited and named the Carteret Islands. Carteret was also the first European to see Buka Island. The following year, Frenchman Louis Antoine de Bougainville sailed along the east coast of Bougainville Island, which bears his name. He also gave Buka Island its name, after a word that was repeatedly called out to him from canoes originating from the island.

==German protectorate==
On 10 April 1886, two years after the establishment of German New Guinea, the United Kingdom and Germany agreed to divide the Solomon Islands archipelago into spheres of influence. As a result of this agreement, the islands of Buka, Bougainville, Choiseul, Santa Isabel, Ontong Java, the Shortland Islands, and part of the Florida Islands were placed under a German protectorate (&quot;Schutzgebiet&quot;), which was formally established on 28 October 1886 by the commander of . On 13 December, Kaiser Wilhelm I granted the New Guinea Company a charter to govern the protectorate in accordance with the existing arrangements for German New Guinea. The remainder of the archipelago became the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, which was not formally established until 1893. The present-day boundary between Bougainville and the country of Solomon Islands was established following the Tripartite Convention of 1899, which saw some of the northern islands ceded to the UK in exchange for German control over Western Samoa. The Shortlands, Choiseul, Santa Isabel, and Ontong Java were included in the cession.

The Northern Solomons were initially grouped with the Bismarck Archipelago for German administrative purposes. The first official visit from the German administration did not occur until November 1888. The acting administrator Reinhold Kraetke arrived accompanied by an imperial judge, a company manager, a visiting German journalist, a missionary, and a local merchant Richard Parkinson who had been recruiting labourers from the area for several years. A native police force was quickly established. The first punitive expedition undertaken by the German administration occurred in April 1899, in response to the killing of two European seamen in Tinputz Bay the previous year. The landed 20 members of the native police force armed with bows and arrows, who killed seven people, burned a village, and took its valuables. It was not until 1905 that a government station was opened in Bougainville. The station, situated in Kieta, was placed directly under the Governor of German New Guinea.

The German protectorate over the islands initially had little economic impact. A handful of copra plantations were established, but proved unproductive, and the area was seen primarily as a source of labour for existing plantations in other parts of New Guinea. As of 1905, &quot;there was apparently not a single permanent trading post manned by a non-native&quot;. The first fully commercial plantation was established at Aropa in 1908 by the Bismarck Archipelago Company. In 1910, the New Britain Corporation established a plantation at Toiemonapu. There was subsequently a rush of commercial activity, with ten enterprises established in 1911. By April 1913, land acquisitions of over had been approved by the administration, mostly by Australian companies. About of roads had been built by this time, and construction on a hospital for natives had begun. The total tax revenue for 1913 was almost 28,000 marks, about half of which was collected in Kieta. As of 1 January 1914, there were 74 Europeans in the area, one-third of whom were connected with the Marist mission and 17 of whom were British subjects (including Australians). There were also 20 &quot;foreign natives&quot;, mostly Chinese and Malay.

==World War I and Australian administration==
Following the outbreak of World War I, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&amp;MEF) occupied Bougainville in December 1914, as part of the broader Australian occupation of German New Guinea. The 1919 Treaty of Versailles established the former German territory as a League of Nations mandate, the responsibility for which was awarded to Australia. The Australian military administration had adopted a &quot;business as usual&quot; approach and secured the support of the existing German business community. It was replaced by a civil administration in 1920, which expropriated the property of German nationals without compensation and deported them.

The Australian administration continued the German approach of &quot;pacification&quot;, intervening in local conflicts. This allowed labour recruiters to enter new regions and secure more workers for the plantations. In 1915, more than 60 native police officers were deployed to Soraken to protect against raids from mountain tribes, who were known to engage in cannibalism. An expedition was launched against Bowu, an &quot;influential cannibal chief&quot;. His village at Kaumumu was attacked and Bowu&#x27;s severed head was displayed to the local people. However, &quot;it is doubtful if the display of severed heads had the intended effect since these acts had taken place outside the customary ceremonial context&quot;.

In 1921, the population of Bougainville was recorded at 46,832. The Australian district officer was based at Kieta and controlled a native police force of 40 constables and five officers. The civil administration &quot;pursued pacification less ferociously than its military predecessor&quot; and recruited Bougainvilleans as interpreters. The administration established larger &quot;line villages&quot; in place of the smaller hamlets, in order to simplify collection and &quot;condition the able-bodied men to the barracks discipline on the plantations&quot;. German ethnographer Richard Thurnwald returned to Buin in 1933 following an earlier visit in 1908. He noted a number of changes over the 25-year period, including a large increase in literacy, the introduction of a cash economy (comprising both coins and shell money), the erosion of chiefly authority, a decrease in headhunting, and the introduction of feast-giving as a surrogate for war.

The Australians had adopted many aspects of the previous German Administration. There was little difference between the two colonisers except for the expropriation policy and the line village consolidation program. The Germans had done the pioneering work in the colony and the Australians made this the foundation for colonial management.

The 1920s saw the introduction of Protestantism to Bougainville, in the form of missionaries from the Methodist Church of New Zealand (1921) and the Seventh-day Adventist Church (1924). Tensions arose between the existing Catholic missionaries and the new arrivals, culminating in sectarian disturbances in Kieta in 1929. Father Albert Binois wrote to his superiors that the Protestants were &quot;friends of the devil&quot;. The late 1920s and 1930s also produced an influx of anthropologists and ethnographers to Bougainville, among them Australians Ernest and Sarah Chinnery, Catholic priest Patrick O&#x27;Reilly, Briton Beatrice Blackwood, and American Douglas L. Oliver.

== Second World War ==
In 1942, Bougainville was occupied by Japanese forces, who used it as a base to attack Guadalcanal and other Allied territory. In November 1943, the 3rd Marine Division landed on the west coast of Bougainville. Shortly afterwards the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay was fought between cruisers and destroyers of the U.S. Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Americans routed the Japanese and took control of the seas in this area. A concerted Allied land offensive between November 1943 and April 1944 was needed to occupy and hold the part of the island along the western shore in an area called &quot;Torokina&quot;. The Americans set about establishing a wide defensive perimeter, draining swamps, and building multiple airfields for defence. Their next goal was to attack the Japanese on New Britain Island. The Marines were replaced by US Army troops.

The Japanese infiltrated the mountains and jungles of Bougainville, and launched a counteroffensive against the Americans in 1944. The critical focus of their attack was at a place called &quot;Hellsapoppin Ridge&quot; by the Americans. In repulsing this attack, the American soldiers and airmen broke the back of the Japanese Army on Bougainville. The survivors retreated to their bases on northern and southern Bougainville, and the Americans left them to &quot;wither on the vine&quot; for the remainder of the war. During the 1943–45 period, more than 17,500 Japanese soldiers were either killed in combat, died of disease, or died of malnutrition.

In April 1943 Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, commander of the Combined Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy, was killed on Bougainville Island when his transport aircraft was shot down by American fighter aircraft during Operation Vengeance.

In 1945, the Australian Army took over occupation from the Americans. Australia resumed control of Bougainville and Papua New Guinea, which became a United Nations trusteeship. The remaining Japanese on Bougainville refused to surrender, but held out until the surrender of the Japanese Empire on 2 September 1945. They were commanded by the Emperor to surrender to the Allied Australians, Americans, and New Zealanders, and they were repatriated to Japan.

==Beginnings of the independence movement==

Bougainville is rich in copper, and possibly gold. The mining of copper has been the subject of considerable social tensions over the last fifty years. Local people made two attempts at secession in protest of the mining exploitation.

The Hahalis Welfare Society, established in 1959 and led by John Teosin and Francis Hagai, mounted a campaign against Australian authorities&#x27; attempts to impose a head tax. In 1962 over 60 people were injured in a series of conflicts with territorial police. By 1963 the society claimed 3,500 members spread over eight villages.

In 1964, Australian business began the first attempt to explore the island&#x27;s resources: CRA Exploration, a subsidiary of Australian company Rio Tinto Zinc, began drilling in the Panguna area. The Panguna mine opened in 1969 under their subsidiary, Bougainville Copper Ltd.

The first independence movement emerged in the late 1960s, at a time when other colonial governments were being dismantled in Asian and African nations. The local indigenous people began to air their grievances against the Australian colonial government over the handling of the Panguna mine and protested the inadequate sharing of revenues being generated from mining on their land. Australian External Territories Minister Charles Barnes was accused of telling the Bougainvillean people they would &quot;get nothing&quot;. The local people sued for compensation and the case went to the High Court of Australia. It found that the compensation was inadequate under ordinary federal Australian law. But, as an external territory, Papua New Guinea was not guaranteed the same standards that applied to mainland Australia.

In 1972, Australia granted Bougainville some degree of autonomy, but this did not end the secessionist movement. Relations between Bougainville and the government of Papua New Guinea deteriorated after the murders of two senior Bougainvillean public servants in December 1972. This was rumored to be retaliation for a road accident in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. Islanders were outraged by the murders, and the events helped to consolidate the independence movement. As a result, the Bougainville Special Political Committee (BSPC) was set up to negotiate with the Papuan government on the future of Bougainville within PNG.

By 1974, the BSPC had reached a compromise with a Special Committee of the Papuan Parliament, which would have given the island greater autonomy. The Special Committee did not agree to providing a defined share of the profits from the Panguna mine to the people of Bougainville. The conservative Papuan government declined to follow key sections of the committee&#x27;s report, and in May 1975, negotiations between the two parties collapsed completely.

===Republic of North Solomons===

On 28 May 1975, the Interim Provincial Government in Bougainville agreed to secede from Papua New Guinea. This caused a three-way impasse between the Government of PNG, the legislature in PNG, and the authorities in Bougainville. The PNG government attempted to resolve the situation through June and July, but failed. The Interim Provincial Government announced that they would declare independence on 1 September, ahead of Papua New Guinea&#x27;s own planned independence day of 16 September. On 1 September, they issued the &#x27;Unilateral Declaration of Independence of the Republic of North Solomons&#x27;.

They sought international recognition through the United Nations, but were unsuccessful. They also failed in an attempt to unite with the Solomon Islands. In early 1976, the Bougainvillean government realised that they would have to accept Papua New Guinean sovereignty.

Later that year, both the governments signed the &#x27;Bougainville Agreement&#x27;, which gave the island autonomy within Papua New Guinea. The PNG government promised full independence in five years, but did not fulfill this promise. For the remainder of the 1970s, and into the early 1980s, relations between the two remained tense, but relatively peaceful. In 1981 disputes re-emerged over the status of the mine, which was the basis of the conflict that became violent in 1988.

==Secessionist conflict==
===Tensions===
Operations of the mine at Panguna and sharing of its revenues had been perhaps the major sticking point between Bougainville and PNG government. The mine was the largest non-aid revenue stream of the Government of Papua New Guinea from 1975, when it became independent, to the mine&#x27;s closure in 1989. The national government received a 20% share of profit from the mine and authorised 0.5–1.25% share to the Bougainvilleans.

Revenues from the mine products was vitally important to the economy of Papua New Guinea, but the people of Bougainville were seeing little benefit from it. In addition, they began to recognise that they were bearing the total effects of the mine&#x27;s environmental consequences for the island. They claimed that the Jaba River had been poisoned, causing birth defects among local people, as well as the extinction of the flying fox on the island and adverse effects on fish and other species. Critics said that Bougainville Copper had created an apartheid, segregated system, with one set of facilities for white workers, and one set for the locals.

===Insurgency===
By late 1988, cousins and local leaders, Francis Ona and Pepetua Serero, decided to take up arms against the Papuan government. Ona had worked for Bougainville Copper, and had witnessed the effects the mine was having on the environment.

In 1987, Ona and Serero had called a meeting of landowners around Panguna, forming the Panguna Landowners&#x27; Association. Serero was selected as &#x27;Chairlady&#x27; and Ona as General Secretary. They demanded billions in compensation from CRA for lost revenues and damages, a total of half the mine&#x27;s profits since it began in 1969.

A report on the SBS &quot;Dateline&quot; program, broadcast on 26 June 2011, states that Sir Michael Somare, at the time Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Opposition Leader, had signed an affidavit in 2001 specifying that the PNG government was acting under instruction from mining giant Rio Tinto. SBS reported on 27 June 2011 that Bougainville Copper Limited and Rio Tinto denied this assertion, and rejected ideas that they had started the war.

===Uprising===
In November 1988 Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) returned to attack the mine, holding up its magazine, stealing explosives, and committing numerous acts of arson and sabotage. They cut the power supply to the entire mine by blowing up power pylons. These BRA forces were commanded by Sam Kauona, a man who had trained in Australia and defected from the Papuan defence forces to become Ona&#x27;s right-hand man. Kauona became the spokesperson for the BRA. He continued to conduct hit-and-run raids on mine property and PNG government installations. Following targeted attacks on mine employees, the company closed the mine on 15 May 1989. Serero died from asthma soon afterward and Ona led the uprising with help from Kauona. Evacuation of all remaining employees of Bougainville Copper Limited followed after the mine&#x27;s closure, with all personnel withdrawn by 24 March 1990.

The Papuan police, and the army under Jerry Singirok made several arrests, but Ona proved to be elusive. They failed to catch him. (Singirok was later an important player in the Sandline affair.) Attempts to resolve the standoff continued, and Bougainville Copper continued to deny responsibility for the grievances brought by Ona and his supporters. The company suggested that the flying foxes had suffered high fatalities due to a virus brought in from East New Britain, and said that mine operations had not affected the health of the river. The PNG government and Bougainville Copper initially made attempts to resolve some of the outstanding issues, and offered an expensive compromise deal, which was rejected outright by Ona and Kauona.

The Premier of Bougainville, Joseph Kabui, and Father John Momis, the Member for Bougainville in the national parliament and a former leader of the 1975 secession effort, supported Ona and Kauona. They demanded that the company recognise them as legitimate leaders. Both of these men later became involved directly in the independence movement. They were beaten by riot police during a 1989 protest. Allegations of human rights abuses by the PNG army began to arise. These embarrassed the PNG government, which arrested more than 20 men in the army after an investigation.

The BRA conducted violence against the provincial government, including the assassination of John Bika, Kabui&#x27;s Commerce and Liquor Licensing Minister. He had supported the compromise agreement between the Bougainvilleans and the Government.

As a response to the continuing violence, the national government called a state of emergency; it placed the island under the administration of the Police Commissioner, who was based in Port Moresby. The allegations of human rights abuses continued, and a survey in late 1989 indicated that at least 1600 homes had been destroyed. The conflict showed no signs of ending, and in January 1990, Bougainville Copper announced the mothballing of the Panguna mine.

In 1990, Prime Minister Rabbie Namaliu of Papua New Guinea agreed to pull Papuan troops out, and for international observers to witness the disarmament of the BRA. The agreement was signed by Sam Kauona for the BRA. The police feared attacks by the locals and fled; leaving the island to the control of the BRA. In Port Moresby, there was an attempted military coup against the government following the decision to withdraw; it was defeated.

===Civil war===
In May 1990, Papua New Guinea imposed a blockade on Bougainville. Francis Ona responded by unilaterally declaring independence. He set up the Bougainville Interim Government (BIG), but it had little power, and the island began to descend into disarray. The command structure set up by the BRA seldom had any real control over the various groups throughout the island that claimed to be part of the BRA. A number of &quot;&quot; (criminal) gangs that were affiliated with the BRA, equipped largely with weapons salvaged from the fighting in World War II, terrorised villages, engaging in murder, rape and pillage. Bougainville split into several factions, and a civil war began.

Much of the division in this fighting was largely along clan lines; the BIG/BRA was dominated by the Nasioi clan, causing other islanders to view it with suspicion. On the island of Buka north of Bougainville, a local militia formed and drove out the BRA with the help of Papuan troops, during a bloody offensive in September 1990. Multiple agreements were signed but were not honoured by any parties. The BRA leadership of Ona and Kauona fell out with some of the political leaders, such as Kabui. Several other village militias, which together became known as the resistance and were armed by the PNG defence forces, forced the BRA out of their areas.

Papua New Guinea&#x27;s policy towards Bougainville hardened after the defeat of the incumbent government at the 1992 elections. New prime minister Paias Wingti took a considerably more hardline stance. He angered residents of the Solomon Islands after a bloody raid on one island that was alleged to be supporting the Bougainvilleans. In alliance with the resistance, the Papuan army succeeded in retaking Arawa, the provincial capital, in January 1993. Papuan Foreign Minister Sir Julius Chan attempted to recruit a peacekeeping force from the nations of the Pacific, but Wingti quashed the idea. He subsequently ordered the army to retake the Panguna mine, and was initially successful. However, his government was short-lived. In August 1994 he was replaced as prime minister by Chan.

Chan announced his intention to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. He met with Kauona in the Solomon Islands and arranged for a peace conference to be held in Arawa that October, with security provided by an Australia-led South Pacific Peacekeeping Force. However, the BIG leaders boycotted the conference, claiming that their safety could not be guaranteed. In their absence, Chan&#x27;s government entered into negotiations with a group of chiefs from the Nasioi clan, headed by Theodore Miriung, a former lawyer for the Panguna Landowners Association. This resulted in the establishment of a Bougainville Transitional Government in April 1995, with its capital in Buka. Miriung was named Prime Minister of the new government, but he frequently clashed with Chan by criticising abuses committed by Papuan soldiers.

By 1996, Chan was beginning to get frustrated at the lack of progress. In January, following a round of negotiations in Cairns, Australia, between the BRA, BTG and the PNG government, a PNG defence force patrol boat fired upon Kabui and the other delegates when they returned to Bougainville. The next month, the home of the BIG&#x27;s representative in the Solomon Islands, Martin Mirori, was firebombed. Chan decided to abandon attempts at peace, and on 21 March 1996, he gave the go-ahead for an invasion of Bougainville, under new commander of the PNG defence forces, Jerry Singirok.

===Sandline and ceasefire===
After five resolutions in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, a report by the Special Rapporteur on Summary Executions and Disappearances and a resolution from the Security Council as well as mounting pressure from Amnesty International, ICRC and other human rights groups, the governments of Australia and New Zealand ceased providing military support, forcing Chan to begin to look elsewhere. Thus began the Sandline affair, where the government of Papua New Guinea attempted to hire mercenaries from Sandline International, a London-based private military company, composed primarily of former British and South African special forces soldiers, which had been involved in the civil wars in Angola and Sierra Leone. With negotiations with Sandline ongoing and incomplete, Chan ordered the military to invade anyway. In July the PNG defence forces attempted to seize Aropa airport, the island&#x27;s principal airfield. However, the attack was a disaster, suffering from poor logistical planning and determined resistance by BRA fighters. In September, BRA militants attacked a PNG army camp at Kangu Beach with the help of members of a local militia group, killing twelve PNGDF soldiers and taking five hostage. The following month, Theodore Miriung was assassinated. Although Chan&#x27;s government attempted to blame the BRA, a subsequent independent investigation implicated members of the PNG defence force and the resistance militias. Discipline and morale was rapidly deteriorating within the ranks of the PNG military, which had been unable to make any substantial progress in penetrating the mountainous interior of the island and reopening the Panguna mine. Chan decided that his best chance to recapture the Panguna mine was with the Sandline mercenaries.

However, this too turned out to be a disaster. News of his intention to hire mercenaries was leaked to the Australian press, and international condemnation followed. Furthermore, when Jerry Singirok heard of the news, he ordered the detaining of all the mercenaries on arrival. In the resulting saga, Prime Minister Chan was forced to resign, and Papua New Guinea came very close to a military coup. Indeed, the officers in charge had the parliament surrounded, but steadfastly refused to go any further. In the end, however, they got their way, with Chan&#x27;s resignation and the removal of the mercenaries from Papua New Guinean territory.

Sandline sparked a low point in the Bougainvillean war. Since 1997, a ceasefire has largely held on the island. Breaking with Ona, Kauona and Kabui entered into peace talks with the government of Bill Skate in Christchurch, New Zealand, which culminated in the signing of the Lincoln Agreement in January 1998. Under the terms of the agreement, PNG began to withdraw its soldiers from the island and a multinational Peace Monitoring Group was deployed. Legislation to establish a Bougainville Reconciliation Government failed to win approval in the PNG Parliament.

A Bougainville provincial government of the same status as the other eighteen provinces of Papua New Guinea, with John Momis as Governor, was established in January 1999. However, this government was suspended after facing opposition from both the BIG/BRA and BTG. Arrangements were made for the creation of a modified government, to be established in two phases-the first being the Bougainville Constituent Assembly and the second being the elections for the Bougainville People&#x27;s Congress. Elections were held in May, and Kabui was named president. However, the legality of this was contested by Momis, with the support of a number of tribal chiefs and Resistance leaders. In November, a new body, the Bougainville Interim Provincial Government, was established, headed by Momis. Rapproachment between Kauona and Momis led to an agreement in which the two bodies would act in consultation. An organised reconciliation process began at the tribal level in the early 2000.

Throughout the decade, Ona continued to resist overtures to participate in the new government, declaring himself &#x27;king&#x27; of Bougainville before dying of malaria in 2005. In March 2005, Dr Shaista Shameem of the United Nations working group on mercenaries asked Fiji and Papua New Guinea for permission to send a team to investigate the presence of former Fijian soldiers in Bougainville.

The Australian government has estimated that between 15,000 and 20,000 people have died in the Bougainville Conflict. More conservative estimates put the number of combat deaths as 1,000 to 2,000.

===Foreign media coverage of civil war===
Cass (1992) argued that The Australian newspaper, in its coverage of the Bougainville conflict, lacked depth and focused on the crisis from Australia&#x27;s own interests and a conviction that the former territory could not really look after itself. Other researchers pointed out that even though journalists got into Bougainville during the crisis, the coverage was uneven (Cronau, 1994; Denoon &amp; Spriggs, 1992). Dorney argues that, with few exceptions, the Australian media pays scant attention to Australia&#x27;s former colony unless there is high drama, such as during the Sandline crisis in March 1997, or a disaster relief effort, such as when the Australian Defence Force played a high-profile role during the drought induced famine of 1997–98 (1998, p15). He adds that the rest of the time it is the bizarre and tragic, especially violent crime involving expatriates, that fill the limited agenda. According to Patience (2005), PNG has a public relations problem in terms of its image abroad.

==Post-conflict==
===Operation Bel Isi===
The Peace Monitoring Group (PMG) on Bougainville in Papua New Guinea was brought about by the civil unrest on the island in the 1990s. The PNG government requested the Australian and New Zealand governments to provide a monitoring group to oversee the ceasefire on the island. This group was made up of both civilian and defence personnel from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Vanuatu. Then Major General General Frank Hickling led the peace monitoring mission, supported by elements of Australia&#x27;s 8th Brigade which is known to include then Captain Ian Langford. Support remained strong throughout the PMG&#x27;s deployment. The PMG was established on the island on 1 May 1998 and took over from the New Zealand Truce Monitoring Group which then departed.

The PMG comprised approximately 100 personnel, was unarmed and wore bright yellow shirts and hats. It had no specific legal power although it did have a mandate under the Lincoln Agreement. It remained definitively neutral at all times. In the early stages of its deployment, it acted primarily as a ceasefire monitoring group and spread information about developments in the peace process. Following the Bougainville Peace Agreement, the PMG focused primarily on facilitating the weapons disposal program, in co-operation with the small UN Observer Mission on Bougainville (UNOMB). There was also some logistical support given to the constitutional consultation and drafting process from 2003.

Support was provided to the group via use of the Loloho wharf on the eastern side of the island by naval vessels from Australia and New Zealand as well as the Kieta airfield by weekly C130 Hercules flights from Townsville. Four UH-1 &#x27;Huey&#x27; helicopters were supplied by Australian 171st Aviation Squadron, which were painted bright red for visibility and utilised to ferry personnel to inland villages inaccessible by foot or vehicle. With more than 8,000 safe flying hours in the skies of Bougainville to their credit, the choppers made their way back to Australia aboard . Later, air mobility was outsourced to the commercial Hevilift company, which provided two Bell 212 helicopters.

HQ PMG was based in Arawa and comprised approx. 50 personnel providing coordination for all the operations in Bougainville. The majority of personnel lived in local houses in the Arawa township. The Logistical Support Team (LST) at the Loloho wharf comprised approx. 70 personnel and provided such services as catering, dental, medical, IT support, vehicle transport and communications to the outlying team sites. LST members lived in the &quot;Opera House&quot; which was an old storage silo for copper, used when the mine was open. The remaining staff of PMG were located all over Bougainville in team sites monitoring the peace and liaising with local communities. The following locations had team sites in 2000 – Arawa, Sirakatau, Buin, Tonu, Wakunai and Buka.

The Bougainville Peace Agreement decreed that all personnel should be withdrawn from the island by December 2002. However, the group was extended by the applicable governments and withdrew completely by 23 August 2003.

The total cost of Australia&#x27;s development and military assistance to Bougainville from the financial year 1997–98 until FY 2002–03 was $243.2 million. Over 3500 Australian defence personnel and 300 Australian civilians served in the Peace Monitoring Group during Operation Bel Isi.

===Autonomy within Papua New Guinea===

On 30 August 2001, a peace agreement was signed between the PNG government and representatives from Bougainville. It stipulated the creation of an autonomous government for Bougainville with a &quot;home-grown&quot; constitution, the right of Bougainville to hold a referendum on independence in the future, and the disposal of weapons from the conflict. The agreement was largely upheld by both sides. The constitution of Bougainville was developed by 2004, under which the various organs of the Bougainville Government were established. These included the office of President of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, Bougainville Executive Council, the Bougainville House of Representatives and the region&#x27;s judiciary.

The autonomous region elects a president, 33 constituency representatives, and one woman and one former Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) combatant from each of the three districts to the autonomous region&#x27;s House of Representatives, as well as one provincial and three open constituency members to the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea. Elections in Bougainville have been held every five years since 2005, with Kabui elected president in 2005. Kabui unexpectedly died in office in 2008, and former BRA fighter James Tanis 2008 was elected to replace him. Tanis lost the 2010 election to John Momis, who was re-elected in 2015. Momis sought to extend presidential term-limits, allowing him to contest the 2020 election, but this was rejected by both the House of Representatives and the Supreme Court. Ishmael Toroama is the current president, having won the 2020 election.

===Independence referendum===
The 2001 peace agreement stipulated that an independence referendum for Bougainville would be held between 10 and 15 years after the autonomous region&#x27;s government had been formed, which set the deadline in 2020. The referendum was held in November and December 2019, with 98.31% of voters choosing independence, and a turnout of 87.38%. Results were not contested by any parties. The referendum was non-binding, and was followed by consultation between the Bougainville and PNG governments. Agreement was reached that Bougainville would achieve independence and sovereignty no sooner than 2025 and no later than 2027, however this requires ratification from the national parliament and the Papuan prime minister James Marape has not explicitly committed to Bougainville becoming separate from PNG.

<text>Control Room is a 2004 documentary film directed by Jehane Noujaim, about Al Jazeera and its relations with the US Central Command (CENTCOM), as well as the other news organizations that covered the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

People featured in the film include Lieutenant Josh Rushing, a press officer from US Central Command, David Shuster, an NBC correspondent, and Tom Mintier, a CNN correspondent. Al Jazeera was represented by Samir Khader, a senior producer, Hassan Ibrahim, a Sudanese journalist who attended U.S. universities and headed the BBC Arab News Service before joining Al Jazeera, and Dima Khatib, a Syrian journalist and a producer at Al Jazeera. Samir Khader later became the editor of Al-Jazeera. Josh Rushing started working for Al Jazeera English in 2006, Shuster started working for Al Jazeera America in 2013.

The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2004, and was released on May 21, 2004, by Magnolia Pictures. It received positive reviews from critics, but has been criticized for bias. Noujaim has acknowledged this lack of objectivity, stating &quot;I am not saying it is the truth, but it is our truth.&quot; The film was nominated for Best Documentary Screenplay from the Writers Guild of America.

==Topics==

===Al Jazeera&#x27;s role in Arab society===
&quot;Control Room&quot; documents the spectrum of opinion that surrounds the Qatar television news network Al Jazeera. Throughout the film, US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld appears at press conferences, complaining about the propagandist nature of Al Jazeera. Paradoxically, another clip shows Muhammad Saeed al-Sahhaf, the Iraqi Minister of Information, accusing the television organization of transmitting American propaganda. The contrasting views between the documentary&#x27;s central figures are not so clear cut. Early in the movie, press officer Lt. Rushing remarks that Al Jazeera&#x27;s bias leads it to focus exclusively on American tanks and Iraqi casualties, yet he later confides that agencies such as Fox News also appear to hand-pick their material, and he sees what both sides leave out. Samir Khader, a senior producer of Al Jazeera, claims the network&#x27;s purpose is to shake up the rigid infrastructure of Arab society, which he believes has fallen behind, culturally and technologically, because of its social intolerance to other cultures and perspectives.

===Bias in the media===
Rushing laments about Al Jazeera&#x27;s bias, and speculates why the network shows no photos of alleged Iraqi military atrocities, such as soldiers holding families hostage. Abdallah Schleifer, an American reporter, counters that no such pictures exist. He has no doubt these atrocities occur. However, he explains that hearsay filtering down through CentCom is not convincing to skeptical Arab viewers; &#x27;That&#x27;s why pictures of these things are so vital.&#x27;

A crucial point in the documentary comes with Lt. Rushing&#x27;s realization that Fox News displays that same lack of objectivity which he accuses Al-Jazeera of perpetuating - his conclusion drives home the point that media bias is institutionalized on both sides.

Given the subject of this film, pictures are so important because they transcend language. Unless there is concern that they have been contrived, they give useful information to all perspectives. This is what a producer for Al Jazeera claims was the motivation for showing dead American soldiers and Iraqi civilians. As for objectivity, she discards it as &#x27;a mirage&#x27;. The film concludes that war is something that makes emotionless involvement impossible for any involved party.

===Journalist embedding during Iraq War===

In an effort to rectify past mishandling of media personnel during wartime and to garner support for the Iraq war, the Pentagon introduced a new journalist embedding policy. The policy allowed media &quot;long-term, minimally restrictive access to U.S. air, ground and naval forces through embedding.&quot; In its implementation of the policy, the Pentagon expressed recognition of the media&#x27;s ability to &quot;shape public perception of the national security environment now and in the years ahead… for the U.S. public; the public in allied countries whose opinion can affect the durability of |the| coalition.&quot; As many as 775 journalists covered the Iraq War as embedded journalists at the start of the Iraq War, meaning that in addition to reporting on military action in Iraq, the journalists were also required to &quot;live, work, and travel as part of the units.&quot; The media embed ground rules introduced in March 2003 stated &quot;Our ultimate strategic success in bringing peace and security to this region will come in our long-term commitment to supporting our democratic ideals. We need to tell the factual story-good or bad- before others seed the media with disinformation and distortions,&quot; (Victoria Clarke, Pentagon spokesperson).

===Freedom of the media===

One of the central focuses of &quot;Control Room&quot; is on the alleged friendly fire attack against the Baghdad headquarters of Al Jazeera, on 8 April 2003. The film shows footage of the attack, and film reports that the alleged target was a group of insurgents who opened fire on coalition forces from within the Al Jazeera building, thus justifying retaliatory fire. Much doubt is expressed within as to whether such an explanation is viable. During the attack, one correspondent working for the news network, Tarek Ayyoub, was killed; the film records one subsequent episode during a press conference, when Ayyoub&#x27;s widow beseeches journalists to &#x27;tell the truth&#x27; concerning her husband&#x27;s death, for the sake of those innocents already killed during the war.

The same day that witnessed the attacks on Al Jazeera also saw attacks on other news networks: a strike by US troops on the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad killed a Spanish TV cameraman and a Reuters cameraman. Claims that US troops were returning fire upon a sniper were &quot;greeted with incredulity by reporters on the ground, including Sky News reporter David Chater, and at Central Command in Qatar.&quot;
On the same day, Abu Dhabi TV was also hit, &quot;which means the US forces [had] attacked all the main western and Arab media headquarters in the space of just one day.&quot; Charter also said that, &quot;Al Jazeera is the best Channel in the world.&quot; 

The aftermath of the attack saw a number of allegations: Al Jazeera claimed to have sent the Pentagon details of their staff&#x27;s position via GPS co-ordinates, as did several other news networks. At the time, sources from the BBC noted with alarm that &quot;the Pentagon did not seem to pay heed to information they had been given by Al-Jazeera and every other TV organization based in [Baghdad].&quot;
The overwhelming majority of opinion amongst the Arabic media seems to be that the US acted in order to prevent the reporting of war crimes perpetrated by American personnel;
the attack on Al Jazeera was thus deliberate, a theory which seems to have support from Robert Fisk.
In &quot;Control Room&quot;, the situation is remarked upon by a senior member of Al Jazeera, who remarks that a small news network cannot hope to combat the forces of the United States; in the face of such an apparent censure by so mighty an opponent, he laments, what may one do but &#x27;shut up&#x27;?

==Gaining access to Al Jazeera==
When director, Jehane Noujaim, and cinematographer, Hani Salama&#x27;s, initial attempts to contact and gain access to Al Jazeera failed, Noujaim, without much funding or equipment, traveled to Doha, Qatar, the headquarters for both Al Jazeera and the United States&#x27; Central Command. After weeks waiting for approval in Al Jazeera&#x27;s guard office, the filmmakers finally received an audience with Al Jazeera&#x27;s General Manager, Mohammad Jassem through Abdallah Schleifer, one of Salama&#x27;s professors from the American University in Cairo. Noujaim was initially only given permission to film for three days. After the three days were up, however, Noujaim notes that she begged to continue shooting, and she was allowed to stay longer.

Although unable to provide much support, personally, Jassem suggested that Noujaim and Salama search Al Jazeera&#x27;s cafeteria for anyone that they might want to follow. There, Noujaim and Salama discovered both Samir Khader and Hassan Ibrahim, not only central characters to the film but also crucial to gaining the crew access into Al Jazeera. Noujaim explains, &quot;We also met Hassan in the cafeteria over many cups of coffee and many cigarettes, and he was really the person that was responsible for getting us such amazing access to Al Jazeera. I think he was the first person that believed in what we were doing. And he went to the General Manager and said &#x27;Look, I&#x27;ll take of them. They won&#x27;t get into the way. They&#x27;ll just be following me around&#x27;&quot; (Noujaim, Audio Commentary). Noujaim and Salama often recorded footage simultaneously, capturing multiple angles or locations for the same moment using the Sony DCR-VX2000 and Sony DSR-PD150 miniDV cameras. Despite having a small production, the lack of lighting or formal setup, granted extra flexibility, allowing Noujaim to follow the pace of the Al Jazeera newsroom and focus more on her subjects. Noujaim explains, &quot;Sometimes it&#x27;s a good thing to walk around with a broomstick as a boom and your camera half broken. Y&#x27;know, look like a very low budget, non-threatening production, and be small&quot; (Noujaim, Audio Commentary).

==Production==
&quot;Control Room&quot; was originally to be funded by the BBC, but Noujaim&#x27;s plan of documenting Al-Jazeera covering the war was passed along to BBC director Ben Anthony, who later produced Al Jazeera Exclusive. One of the reasons Noujaim&#x27;s film is titled &quot;Control Room&quot; is that Anthony got exclusive access to the newsroom, which left her to shoot elsewhere, including the control room.
Noujaim says she wanted to be at the center of news creation and make a film on the broader perceptions of the war, a reason why she headed to [Al Jazeera]&#x27;s headquarters in Doha, which was barely 15 miles away from the Central Command, the military base of the United States. Before leaving for Cairo, when Noujaim called her agents in Hollywood, she was told this was the worst idea ever &quot;since after 9/11 people did not want to watch war, but things that were comforting to them.&quot;
Noujaim had raised $US60,000 for the film and says she did the film &quot;as cheaply as she could&quot;. She rented an inexpensive Pakistani hotel in Doha and called upon her cinematographer friend Hani Salama to join the project. They both carried their own cameras, Noujaim with a Sony VX2000 and Salama with a Sony PD150. Noujaim was only in the Middle East for 30 days to complete filming for &quot;Control Room&quot;. From the 200-hour footage that was filmed, Noujaim says initially they had six characters, but then decided to review the footage chronologically, picked out the best scenes and characters, and tried to weave each narrative together. Noujaim wanted to &quot;convey surprise, confusion, discovery -- reproduce her own process in making the film&quot;. Four editors of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds volunteered their time for six months to complete editing of the film. Payback for everyone involved in the film depended on how well the documentary was received. Noujaim says she edited her movie both in Egypt and in the US, as the contrast between the worlds became central to her understanding of the war.

==Cinéma vérité genre==
&quot;Control Room&quot; is a Cinéma vérité film which attempts to present an un-narrated behind-the-scenes focus on the functioning of Al-Jazeera and of the US Central Command during the Iraq War. The film, in its style, recalls &quot;The War Room&quot;, a cinema vérité documentary by Noujaim&#x27;s mentors Chris Hegedus and D. A. Pennebaker, which had a similar behind the scene focus on media spinning during Bill Clinton&#x27;s campaign of 1992.

==Release==
&quot;Control Room&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2004. Shortly after, the film was acquired by Magnolia Pictures. Magnolia stated &quot;Control Room wasn&#x27;t extreme in filmmaking, but the sort of effect it had on viewers was extreme. People were conditioned in the US to think that Al-Jazeera were rabid, American hating, and will do anything to plant a bomb. But they were reasonable journalists. We rushed the film for release, taking dates, making posters even before the contract had been signed.&quot; It was released on May 21, 2004.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
&quot;Control Room&quot; received positive reviews from film critics. It holds a 95% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 111 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.80/10. On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 79 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Controversies and criticism===
&quot;Control Room&quot; has been criticized for partisanship and bias. The film is accused of partisan portrayal where &quot;the Al-Jazeera reporters and characters are shown as stronger characters, while the American reporters she chooses are framed as a motley lot, who are seen shallow, or cynical, or inappropriate as they&#x27;re seen laughing, challenging, doubting, mocking.&quot; Questions have also been raised on the sequence where Al Jazeera&#x27;s cameraperson Tariq Ayoob is killed by a US A10 aircraft circling overhead. Critics have questioned whether it was really a US aircraft that fired the missile, which Noujaim shows, or the sequence of footage was being rearranged and shots from a completely different incident were used to make a completely different point. Noujaim has defended the criticism of objectivity and treatment by stating &quot;I am not saying it is the truth, but it is our truth.&quot;

==Special features==
The special features that accompany the DVD contain further interviews. 
*In one, Hassan Ibrahim states his belief that Bush&#x27;s actions are just as much terrorism as Bin Laden&#x27;s, and that any use of violence is terrorism. The unidentified person speaking with Ibrahim retorts &quot;So there is no such thing as terrorism?&quot; Ibrahim goes on to refute the word &quot;terrorism&quot; as a term that is unjustly applied only to Arabs, and unthinkingly adopted by the US media and public.
*In another segment Dima Khatib states that her personal views do not colour what Al Jazeera presents, because &quot;Al Jazeera just presents information&quot;. The film further notes that both the Bush administration and radical groups in Iraq (such as elements of Saddam&#x27;s fallen regime) distrust and dislike Al Jazeera&#x27;s information.

<text>Engelbert Kaempfer (16 September 16512 November 1716) from Lemgo, was a German naturalist, physician, explorer, and writer known for his tour of Russia, Persia, India, Southeast Asia, and Japan between 1683 and 1693.

He wrote two books about his travels. &quot;Amoenitatum exoticarum&quot;, published in 1712, is important for its medical observations and the first extensive description of Japanese plants (&quot;Flora Japonica&quot;). His &quot;History of Japan&quot;, published posthumously in 1727, was the chief source of Western knowledge about the country throughout the 18th and mid-19th centuries, when it was closed to foreigners.

==Early life==
Kaempfer was born at Lemgo in the Principality of Lippe, within the Holy Roman Empire. His father was a pastor and his mother helped support the congregation. He studied at Hameln, Lüneburg, Hamburg, Lübeck and Danzig (Gdańsk), and after graduating at Kraków, spent four years at Königsberg in Prussia, studying medicine and natural science.

== Travels and studies ==


===Persia===
In 1681, Kaempfer visited Uppsala in Sweden, where he was offered inducements to settle. His desire for foreign travel led him to become secretary to the second embassy of the Swedish ambassador Ludvig Fabritius, whom Charles XI sent through Russia to Persia in 1683. Kaempfer&#x27;s travelogue of this embassy was later published. He reached Persia by way of Moscow, Kazan and Astrakhan, landing at Nizabad &quot;in Shirvan&quot; (now in Azerbaijan) after a voyage in the Caspian Sea. From Shemakha in Shirvan, he made an expedition to the Baku peninsula, being perhaps the first modern scientist to visit the &quot;fields of eternal fire&quot; around Baku. In 1684 Kaempfer reached Isfahan, then the Persian capital.

When after a stay of more than a year the Swedish embassy prepared to return to its homeland, Kaempfer joined the fleet of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in the Persian Gulf as chief surgeon. In spite of fever caught at Bandar Abbas, he saw something of Arabia (visiting Muscat in 1688) and many of the western coastlands of India.

===Siam and Japan===
In September 1689, Kaempfer reached Batavia. He spent the following winter studying Javanese natural history. In May 1690 he set out for Japan as physician to the VOC trading post in Nagasaki. En route to Japan, the ship in which he sailed touched at Siam, whose capital he visited. He recorded his meeting with Kosa Pan, the Siamese Minister and former ambassador to France. In September 1690 Kaempfer arrived in Nagasaki, the only Japanese port then open to Dutch and Chinese ships.

Kaempfer stayed two years in Japan, during which time he twice visited Edo and the &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Tsunayoshi. He conducted extensive studies on local plants, many of which were published in his &quot;Flora Japonica&quot; (part of &quot;Amoenitatum Exoticarum&quot;). When he visited Buddhist monks in Nagasaki in February 1691, he was the first western scholar to describe the tree &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot;. He brought some Ginkgo seeds back that were planted in the botanical garden in Utrecht. The trees have survived to the 21st century. (The curious &quot;–k&quot;g&quot;o&quot; spelling has long been considered to be an error Kaempfer made in his notes, but Nagata &quot;et al.&quot; showed that it was the spelling of his interpreter, Genemon Imamura, who spoke the dialect of Nagasaki.

Kaempfer also collected materials and information on Japanese acupuncture and moxibustion. His treatise on the cure of colic (Japanese &quot;senki&quot;) using needles and his presentation of a Japanese &quot;Moxa-mirror&quot; had a considerable influence on the reception of Far Eastern medicine in 18th-century Europe.

In his posthumously published notes on Japan, he mixes careful observation with a strong desire to make these observations conform to European conceptions of Asia. He argues that the Japanese have a separate ethnic origin from the Chinese and claims they descend directly from the builders of the Tower of Babel. Thus he links Shinto to Babylonian religion. At the same time, he was among the first Europeans to claim that Japan had a diversity of religions rather than one religion that corresponded to ethno-national identity.

During his stay in Japan, Kaempfer&#x27;s tact, diplomacy and medical skill overcame the cultural reserve of the Japanese. He elicited much valuable information. In November 1692 he left Japan for Java.

===Return to Europe===
After twelve years abroad, Kaempfer returned to Europe in 1695, landing at Amsterdam. He was awarded a doctorate in medicine at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. Kaempfer settled in his native city of Lemgo, where he became the physician of the Count of Lippe. In Germany he published the book &quot;Amoenitatum exoticarum&quot; (Lemgo 1712). Among many other Japanese plants, it included an illustration of a camellia and introduced 23 varieties. It was notable for its description of the electric eel, acupuncture, moxibustion, and the hyena. This was the first scientific description of the hyena (about which until then only confused and downright fanciful things had been &quot;reported&quot; since antiquity), and Linnaeus used it extensively. It can be argued that the modern zoological name of the striped hyena, Hyaena hyaena Linnaeus, could or should include the name Kaempfer based on the tradition of taxonomic naming based on who described something first. Kaempfer&#x27;s other work was also often praised by Linnaeus, including his systematic description of tea, as well as his other work on Japanese plants, and Linnaeus adopted some of Kaempfer&#x27;s plant names, such as &quot;Ginkgo&quot;. In 1716, Kaempfer died at Lemgo. Most of his manuscripts and many objects from his collection are preserved in the British Library and the British Museum. Kaempfer&#x27;s works on Japan had a profound influence on European and German research on East Asia, which culminated in the studies by Philipp Franz von Siebold.

==Manuscripts==

At Kaempfer&#x27;s death his mostly unpublished manuscripts were purchased by Sir Hans Sloane via George I&#x27;s court physician Johann Georg Steigerthal and conveyed to England. Among them was a &quot;History of Japan&quot;, translated from the manuscript into English by Sloane&#x27;s librarian John Gaspar Scheuchzer (1702–1729). It was first published at London, in 2 vols., in 1727. The original German (, Japan of Today) had not been published; the extant German version was translated from the English. Besides Japanese history, this book contains a description of the political, social and physical state of the country in the 17th century. For upwards of a hundred years, when Japan was closed to foreigners, it was the chief source of information for the general reader. In the 21st century it is considered to have some value. A life of the author is prefixed to the &quot;History&quot;. Kaempfer&#x27;s original manuscripts are held by the British Library.

<text>Philippe de Monte (1521 – 4 July 1603), sometimes known as Philippus de Monte, was a Flemish composer of the late Renaissance active all over Europe. He was a member of the 3rd generation madrigalists and wrote more madrigals than any other composer of the time. Sources cite him as being &quot;the best composer in the entire country, particularly in the new manner and musica reservata.&quot; Others compare his collections of music with that of other influential composers, such as Lassus.

== Life ==
Philippe de Monte was born in Mechelen around 1521. After boyhood musical training at St. Rumbolds Cathedral in Mechelen, where he was a choirboy, Monte went to Italy — a common destination for a young Flemish composer in the sixteenth century – where he made a name for himself as a composer, singer, and teacher. He lived and worked in Naples for a while, and in Rome, in the employ of Cardinal Orsini, although he was in England for a brief period, 1554–1555, during the reign of Queen Mary I, while she was married to King Philip II of Spain. Monte reported that he disliked working in Philip&#x27;s choir since all the other members were Spaniards.

&quot;Though Monte was not likely to have been a supporter of the Reformation, he took part in a variety of intellectual exchanges on sensitive topics, some of which involved Italian academics.&quot;

In 1568 Monte was appointed as successor to Jacobus Vaet as &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; to the chapel of Maximilian II. A majority of his music was published in Venice under the direction of Gardano, Monte&#x27;s exclusive publisher in Italy. He wanted to utilize Italian publishers in order to stay close to the home of the madrigal. He was successful at recruiting new musicians to the chapel, for Lassus himself noted the astonishing quality of music-making in Vienna just two years after Monte became leader there. During his first ten years at the Imperial Court, Monte served as an active teacher. Monte worked for the remainder of his long life in Habsburg courts both in Vienna and, since 1583, Prague. Even though his accomplishments were many, he is not known to have held any positions as a church musician or in a noble household. Philippe de Monte died in Prague in 1603.

== Music and influence ==
Monte was a hugely prolific composer, and wrote both sacred and secular music, primarily printed in the German language. He wrote about 40 masses and about 260 other sacred pieces, including motets and &quot;madrigali spirituali&quot; (works differing only from madrigals in that they have sacred texts). He published over 1100 secular madrigals, in 34 books, but not all of them survived. His first publication was in 1554 when he was 33. Most of his publications, from then on, included self-written prefaces that were primarily utilized to express his gratitude to patrons of financial support.

Monte&#x27;s madrigals have been referred to as &quot;the first and most mature fruits of the compositions for five voices.&quot; Stylistically, Monte&#x27;s madrigals vary from an early, very progressive style with frequent use of chromaticism to express the text (though he was not quite as experimental in this regard as Marenzio or Lassus), to a late style which is much simplified, featuring short motifs and frequent homophonic textures. Some of his favorite poets of the time included Petrarch, Bembo, and Sannazaro. Unlike Monteverdi, who began in a conservative style and became experimental later in life, Monte&#x27;s compositional career had an opposite curve, progressing from experimentation to unity and simplicity in his later works. Some believe that this comes from his change in poetry selections, whereas others believe it was a reflection from the imperial courts.

Philippe de Monte was renowned all over Europe; editions of his music were printed, reprinted, and widely circulated. He has been described as &quot;a quiet, unassuming man, gentle as a girl.&quot; He had many students, including Gian Vincenzo Pinelli from Padua, thereby passing on his compositional skills and experience to the generation who developed the early Baroque style. Believed to be one of the most prominent composers, Philippe de Monte&#x27;s madrigals are still performed today.

<text>Abdul Fattah Ismail Ali Al-Jawfi (; 28 July 1939 – 13 January 1986) was a Yemeni Marxist politician and revolutionary who was the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of South Yemen from 1978 to 1980 after the overthrow of President Salim Rubaya Ali. He served as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People&#x27;s Council (head of state) and founder, chief ideologue and first leader of the Yemeni Socialist Party from 21 December 1978 to 21 April 1980. He died under mysterious circumstances during the 1986 South Yemen Civil War and his body was never found.

==Biography==

Abdul Fattah was born on 28 July 1939 in the Al-Hujariah district of the Taiz Governorate in North Yemen. Though his father was a faqīh (Islamic jurist), he had a poor and rural upbringing. He subsequently followed his elder brother to Aden (which was then a British protectorate) where he was educated at the Ahliah School in Tawahi district. When he was approximately seventeen, Abdul Fattah enrolled in a British Petroleum workers’ training center and began working in an oil refinery from 1956 to 1959 as an apprentice. In this setting Abdul Fattah began to develop a political consciousness centered around union organizing and labour advocacy. As a co-founder of the Arab Nationalist Movement in South Yemen, he contributed to the formation of a number of Movement cells before he was arrested by the British colonial authorities in Aden for political incitement of workers.

In 1961, he became a school teacher at Al-Haswah School in Aden, and at the same time continued his involvement in political activity. He was a co-founder of the National Front for the Liberation of South Yemen (NLF). After the outbreak of the Aden Emergency where the NLF sought for the liberation of South Yemen from British colonial rule, Abdul Fattah became a full-time socialist revolutionary, whereby he undertook the leadership of the NLF underground military wing (fedayeen) in Aden, as well as political activity.

He was elected to the NLF executive in the first, second and third NLF congresses, 1965–67. After South Yemen gained independence in 1967 he was appointed Minister of Culture and Yemeni Unity. In the fourth NLF congress, he was instrumental 

in determining the progressive line of the revolution. But in March 1968, he was arrested by the right-wing faction of the NLF and went into exile, where he drafted the program for Accomplishing National Democratic Liberation, a leftist manifesto. He undertook a leading role in the consolidation of left wing of NLF which subsequently regained power in the 22 June 1969 &quot;Corrective Move.&quot;

Subsequent to the &quot;Correction Step&quot; Abdul Fattah was elected Secretary General of the NLF Central Committee, thus making him the country&#x27;s de facto leader. He was also elected a member of the Presidium of the Supreme People&#x27;s Council. In 1970 he was elected Chairman of Presidium. He undertook a leading role in the dialogue between NLF and other left parties in south Yemen leading to the formation of the Yemeni Socialist Party (YSP). He was elected Secretary General of the YSP at the first party congress in October 1978. Ideologically, he is considered to have favored the Soviet model of socialist development (as opposed to Maoist alternatives). In October 1979, Abdul Fattah secured the 1979 Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the USSR. Similar treaties with East Germany and Ethiopia followed in 1981, following Abdul Fattah&#x27;s resignation from office. 

In 1980, he resigned from all his posts for allegedly health reasons and was succeeded by Ali Nasir Muhammad. However, Abdul Fattah was appointed president of the party before he went to Moscow for medical treatment, until 1985, when he returned in the face of a mounting crisis between Muhammad and his opponents in the YSP.

In October 1985, he was elected to the YSP Politburo and as a Secretary of the Central Committee, but the crisis had erupted on 13 January 1986, into a violent struggle in Aden between Ali Nasir&#x27;s supporters and Abdul Fattah&#x27;s supporters (See South Yemen civil war). Fighting lasted for more than a month and resulted in thousands of casualties and Ali Nasir&#x27;s ouster.

==Disappearance and presumed death==
During the crisis, Abdul Fattah disappeared. He was last seen being evacuated from the YSP office along with his deputy Ali Salem al Beidh in a military armored vehicle. Unsubstantiated reports claim he was killed when naval forces loyal to Ali Nasir shelled his home in Aden, but his ultimate fate is unknown. His body was never found.

<text>Cristóbal de Morales (c. 1500 – between 4 September and 7 October 1553) was a Spanish composer of the Renaissance. He is generally considered to be the most influential Spanish composer before Tomás Luis de Victoria.

== Life ==
Cristóbal de Morales was born in Seville and, after an exceptional early education there, which included a rigorous training in the classics as well as musical study with some of the foremost composers, he held posts at Ávila and Plasencia. All that is known about his family is that he had a sister, and that his father died prior to his sister&#x27;s marriage in 1530. Others who lived in Seville are considered to be potential relatives of Morales. These include Cristóbal de Morales, a singer employed by Duke of Medina Sidonia in 1504; Alonso de Morales, treasurer of the cathedral in 1503; Francisco de Morales (d. 1505), a canon; and Diego de Morales, who was the cathedral notary in 1525.

Earlier Spanish popes of the Borja family held a long tradition of employing Spanish singers in the papal chapel’s choir. This had a significant effect on Morales&#x27; success. Starting in 1522, there are three different occurrences where a Cristóbal de Morales was indicated to be an organist. There is little information of the whereabouts of Morales from January 1532 to May 1534. Morales is documented three times in Rome as ‘presbyter toletanus’ in May and December 1534. By 1535 he had moved to Rome, where he was a singer in the papal choir, evidently due to the interest of Pope Paul III who was partial to Spanish singers. He remained in Rome until 1545, in the employ of the Vatican; then, after a period of unsuccessfully seeking other employment in Italy (with the emperor, as well as with Cosimo I de Medici) he returned to Spain, where he held a succession of posts, many of which were marred by financial or political difficulties. The last of these was as &quot;maestro di capilla&quot; at Málaga Cathedral in his native Andalusia from 1551–53. While he was renowned by this time as one of the greatest composers in Europe, he seems to have been unpopular as an employee, for he began to have difficulty finding and keeping positions. 
Morales’s fame was due in part to the numerous testimonials of those around him. The Spanish theorist Juan Bermudo declared him “the light of Spain in music”, while in 1559, a Mexican choir – Spanish polyphony in particular was quick to reach the New World – sang his music at a service commemorating the death of Charles V the previous year. This fame continued into the 18th century when Andrea Adami da Bolsena, biographer of many papal musicians, praised him as the papal chapel’s most important composer between Josquin des Prez and Palestrina.

There is recurrent evidence that he was a difficult character, aware of his exceptional talent, and probably came across as arrogant and incapable of getting along with those of lesser musical abilities. He made severe demands on the singers in his employ and alienated employers. In spite of this, he was regarded as one of the finest composers in Europe around the middle of the 16th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevenson/Planchart, Grove&quot;&gt;Stevenson/Planchart, Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 September 1553 he asked to be considered for the position of &quot;maestro de capilla&quot; at the Cathedral of Toledo, where he had previously worked, but shortly afterwards he died in Marchena; the actual date is not known, but was before October 7.

==Music and influence==

Almost all of his music is sacred, and all of it is vocal, though instruments may have been used in an accompanying role in performance. He wrote many masses, some of spectacular difficulty, most likely written for the expert papal choir; he wrote over 100 motets; and he wrote 18 settings of the Magnificat, and at least five settings of the Lamentations of Jeremiah (one of which survives from a single manuscript in Mexico). The Magnificats alone set him apart from other composers of the time, and they are the portion of his work most often performed today. 
Stylistically, his music has much in common with other middle Renaissance work of the Iberian peninsula, for example a preference for harmony heard as functional by the modern ear (root motions of fourths or fifths being somewhat more common than in, for example, Gombert or Palestrina), and a free use of harmonic cross-relations rather like one hears in English music of the time, for example in Thomas Tallis. Some unique characteristics of his style include the rhythmic freedom, such as his use of occasional three-against-four polyrhythms, and cross-rhythms where a voice sings in a rhythm following the text but ignoring the meter prevailing in other voices. Late in life he wrote in a sober, heavily homophonic style, but all through his life he was a careful craftsman who considered the expression and understandability of the text to be the highest artistic goal.

Morales was the first Spanish composer of international renown. His works were widely distributed in Europe, and many copies made the journey to the New World. Many music writers and theorists in the hundred years after his death considered his music to be among the most perfect of the time.

===Masses===
Morales&#x27;s masses, of which 22 survive, use a variety of techniques, including cantus firmus and parody. Six masses are based on Gregorian chant, and these are mostly written in a conservative cantus-firmus style. Eight of his masses use the parody technique, including one for six voices based on the famous chanson &quot;Mille regretz&quot;, attributed to Josquin des Prez. The melody is arranged so that it is clearly audible in every movement, usually in the highest voice, giving the work considerable stylistic and motivic unity.
Morales also wrote two masses on the famous &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot; tune, which was so often set by composers in the late 15th century and 16th century; one of these is for four voices, and the other for five. The four voice mass uses the tune as a strict cantus firmus, and the setting for five voices treats it more freely, migrating it from one voice to another.

In addition, he wrote a &quot;Missa pro defunctis&quot; (a Requiem mass). Its peculiarities of transmission, as well as its apparent incomplete editing, suggest that it may be his last work.

<text>Moomba (also known as the Moomba Festival) is held annually in Melbourne, Australia. Run by the City of Melbourne, it is Australia&#x27;s largest free community festival. The Melburnian tradition is celebrated over four days, incorporating the Labour Day long weekend, from Friday to the second Monday in March. Moomba is culturally important to Melbourne, having been celebrated since 1955, and regularly attracts up to a million people, with a record attendance of 3.8 million (2.3 million tourists) set in 2018.

In 2003, the event was renamed &quot;Melbourne Moomba Waterfest.&quot;

Traditional events include the Moomba parade, crowning of Moomba monarchs, fireworks displays, carnivals in the gardens along the river, river activities including watersports, water floats and the Birdman Rally, as well as live music and bands.

In 2021, the usual Moomba was cancelled by Melbourne City Council, for the first time ever, due to events and issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. However &quot;Moomba 2.0&quot; events were held on 5–8 March. In 2024 a forecast of extremely hot weather caused the Moomba Parade to be cancelled.

==Origins==
In 1951, Australia celebrated fifty years of Federation with a parade and the staging of the theatre production &quot;An Aboriginal Moomba: Out of the Dark&quot;. In 1954, Queen Elizabeth II visited the city for the first time as reigning monarch, and the City Development Association and the Melbourne City Council proposed an autumn carnival to be called &quot;Moomba&quot;.

A committee was formed in July, 1954 to organise and fund the event, successfully allocating £10,000 to its inaugural running. Before the event&#x27;s first year, controversy was created when Labor Councillor Frank Williams resigned from the committee, branding the planned carnival as a &quot;Bourke street joke for the benefit of shopkeepers&quot;. A promotional theme song &quot;Come to Melbourne for the Moomba&quot; was written by Jack O&#x27;Hagan.

==Etymology==
The festival was originally named &quot;Moomba&quot; by organisers in the belief it was a native word meaning &#x27;let&#x27;s get together and have fun.&#x27; Credit is usually given to Bill Onus, a unionist and member of the Australian Aborigines&#x27; League for proposing the term, which he used in a play, &quot;Aboriginal Moomba&quot; in 1951. In 1969 Luise Hercus glossed the word &quot;mum&quot; (rhyming with &#x27;vroom&#x27;) as meaning &#x27;bottom, rump&#x27;, and suggested &quot;mum-ba&quot; meant something like &#x27;bottom and..&#x27;, and had been introduced from Healesville usage as a joke. In 1981 Barry Blake analysed the word as combining as &quot;mum&quot; (anus) and &quot;–ba&quot;, a locative suffix meaning &#x27;at, in, on&#x27;. This would give the sense of &#x27;up your bum/arse&#x27;.

Onus himself, according to his daughter-in-law, who said she had heard the story from Onus&#x27;s wife Mary, had picked up the word from a word list of indigenous terms. Some say he did it to get back at the city council for having deliberately upstaged the traditional Labour Day march with a popular carnival. Lin Onus, his son, stated that indeed his father had intended to play a prank in passing on the word with this sense.

==Event history==

The first Moomba was a 15-day festival officially opened on 12 March 1955 by the State Governor, Sir Dallas Brooks. The inaugural programme included a fireworks display, parade, vintage car display, Henley rowing regatta, river floats including a &quot;Lord Mayor&#x27;s houseboat&quot;, cycling race, tennis at Kooyong, concerts including performances by the Victorian Symphony Orchestra and Royal Philharmonic choir, crowning of the Queen of Moomba and riverside carnival. 25,000 turned out to watch the inaugural Moomba parade down Swanston Street. The first Moomba was heavily criticised by Melbourne&#x27;s conservative establishment, including the Anglican Church, which at the time claimed it was hedonistic and embodying social decay. Council responded to the criticism citing that Moomba was intended to be a festival for families and as such is reinforcing family values in society.

One of the popular events associated with Moomba was the &quot;Herald Sun Outdoor Art Show&quot; in the Treasury Gardens.

After the 2016 Moomba festival fireworks there was a large-scale brawl in and around Federation Square in Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, in which young people and the police fought each other. The violence was blamed in the press on the supposed Apex, and became a trigger for the African gangs moral panic in the lead up to the Victorian state election of 2018. 

=== 2021 – Moomba 2.0 ===
In 2021 the usual Moomba events were cancelled by Melbourne City Council, for the first time ever, due to COVID-19 restrictions and Victoria&#x27;s third lockdown in February. The Moomba Parade and the Birdman Rally were already cancelled.

Instead of the normal festival attractions, Lord Mayor Sally Capp said Moomba 2.0 will be: &quot;... a series of fun, family friendly events and attractions across the city that will help bring the buzz back to Melbourne.&quot; There was ticketing and COVID-safe marshals at all sites. Moomba 2.0 was a COVID-safe event.

==Events==
===Parade and floats===

A parade (or &quot;procession&quot;) and floats through the streets of Melbourne have been a key part of the Moomba festival since its beginning. Each year it attracts over 100,000 people to Melbourne&#x27;s city centre as well as being shown on free-to-air television in Melbourne.

The first Moomba procession was held in 1955. It was first televised in 1957, the year after the Melbourne 1956 Olympics.

The floats have an annual theme, usually an elaboration on &quot;Let&#x27;s get together and have fun&quot;, the avowed mission and vision statement of Moomba and are usually from sister cities (of which Melbourne has six), schools and community groups. They also promote some aspect of the arts, like singing, dancing, or design. Swanston Street is the traditional home of the floats and spine of the city and horse- or tractor-drawn floats use the tram tracks. Decorated trams are sometimes also featured.

In 2001, the parade came under media controversy when a French Troupe and Melbourne&#x27;s Snuff Puppets had floats with naked people covered in body paint.

In 2024 the parade, in its 70th year, was cancelled due to a heatwave with forecast temperatures from the high 30s to low 40s°C.

===Moomba monarchy===
The Moomba monarchy has been one of the most celebrated and controversial components of the festival over the years.

====Queens of Moomba (1955–1987)====

The first Moomba monarchs were the Queens of Moomba, awarded from the inaugural festival in 1955. The role was decided by a beauty pageant competition. It was awarded for the last time in 1987, as a new gender-neutral monarch position was established and the beauty pageant was abolished.

Notably, 1966 Moomba Queen Erica McMillan was killed in a car accident seven weeks after the festival, in the car which she had received as a prize for being voted Queen.

====Kings of Moomba (1967–1987)====

Kings of Moomba were named beginning in 1967. The role was awarded to male celebrities. It too was abolished following the 1987 festival as the gender-neutral monarch was introduced.

Occasionally, a &quot;court jester&quot; was also named to accompany the king.



====Moomba Monarchs (1988–1998, 2010–present)====

In 1988, a gender-neutral Moomba Monarch position was established. Winners are typically celebrities and may be any gender. The first was television presenter Jo Pearson. In 1999 the tradition ended when clowns Zig and Zag were appointed. After it was revealed that, years before, Zig (Jack Perry) had pleaded guilty to child molestation, they were dethroned. In 2010 the tradition was restored, with Molly Meldrum and Kate Ceberano being named King and Queen of Moomba.

On some occasions, non-celebrities have been named for various reasons.



====Queens of the Pacific (1967–1977)====
The Queen of the Pacific was a title contested by representatives from various countries and administrations from the Pacific and South-East Asian regions. It was decided by a beauty contest. The title was awarded from 1967 to 1977.

====Young Ambassadors (2003–200?)====
The title of &quot;Young Ambassador&quot; was awarded during part of the period during which no monarchs were named (1999 to 2009). It was first awarded in 2003.

From approximately 1981 to 1988 there were also instances where Moomba included a Prince and Princess of Moomba designation consisting of two children chosen through a competition held by local radio station 3KZ.

===Fireworks===
Fireworks are a big part of the Moomba festival and large displays occur on every night of the festival. The fireworks are above the Yarra river.

===Carnival===
A traditional carnival including a ferris wheel are held in the Alexandra Gardens along the river bank. In recent years, the carnival has extended to Birrarung Marr across the river. It is popular with children, and dagwood dogs and doughnut stands line the paths.

===River activities===
Moomba particularly celebrates the Yarra River, which has been much maligned during the history of the city until the last few decades.

====Water skiing====

Water skiing in the Yarra was introduced to Moomba in 1959. The tournament has both Junior and Open divisions, with the finals crowning the Moomba Masters Champions on Moomba Monday.

====River floats====

The festival has featured Chinese dragon boats and the Moomba Showboat.

====Birdman rally====
Among the more popular events is the &quot;Birdman Rally&quot;, begun in 1976, which is traditionally held at the Swan Street Bridge over the Yarra River. However it has been held only intermittently during Moomba&#x27;s history. It was stopped for a number of years due to high levels of E. coli contamination of the Yarra. Subsequent clean-ups reduced pollution to acceptable levels and 2004 saw its return. In 2005, the rally was held in the new inner city park, Birrarung Marr, close to its traditional location.

===Music and live bands===

Moomba&#x27;s performers have included international musical acts such as ABBA, Neil Diamond and AC/DC as well as a number of smaller local acts.

In 2012, performers included Tex Perkins and Daryl Braithwaite.

<doc id="724433" wikidata="Q2074099" url="?curid=724433" title="Trikke">
<text>The Trikke ( ; also known as a wiggle scooter, scissor scooter, carver scooter, Y scooter, or V scooter) is a chainless, pedalless, personal vehicle with a three-wheel frame. The rider stands on two foot platforms above the two rear wheels and steers the vehicle with handlebars attached to the lone front wheel. The cambering system is designed to provide a stable, three-point platform that lets the rider lean into turns while all three wheels remain in contact with the ground. There are several variations of the Trikke, from body-powered fitness machines, to battery-powered transportation and personal mobility vehicles.

Brand name Trikkes are manufactured by the company Trikke Tech based in Buellton, California.

A body-powered Trikke is propelled using a motion that moves the vehicle along a curved, S-shaped path (called &quot;carving&quot;). The rider moves the vehicle from side to side, turning the handlebars and leaning the front structure while moving one&#x27;s body weight toward the side one is turning into. The weight of the rider during a turn (or &quot;carve&quot;) is placed mainly on the foot at the outside of the turn. The inside foot will support very little weight and the rider will often lift the heel of this foot during the turn.

The resulting motion is similar to slalom skiing, a tic-tac move on a skateboard, or one&#x27;s leg movements during roller skating.

A Trikke can be propelled without the need to push off with one&#x27;s foot. There are many variations of Trikke-riding techniques as riders place different emphasis on the elements of the movement.

Using the carving motion, a body-powered Trikke can achieve speeds of nearly 30 km/h (19 mph), but more often, riders cruise around with average speeds in the 15 km/h (9.3 mph) range. A Trikke can be ridden uphill, albeit at a reduced speed.

Since 2009, Trikke Tech, Inc. has manufactured electric versions of the Trikke, which have been adopted by various law enforcement and security companies as an alternative to other personal electric vehicles. Additionally, many recreational riders now use electric Trikkes for personal transportation as well as hybrid fitness vehicles.
==History==
In 1999, Brazilian engineer Gildo Beleski applied for a patent on an improved design for a three-wheel cambering vehicle with the US Patent Office. In 2000, he founded Trikke Tech in Southern California, shipping 100 frames from Brazil and assembling Trikkes in his garage.

Trikke three-wheel carving vehicles officially went on the market in 2002, and Time magazine named it one of the best inventions of that year.

In 2008, Trikke Tech CEO John Simpson said that in 2008, the company sold over 60,000 Trikkes.

Over half a million body-powered Trikkes have been sold.

<doc id="724446" wikidata="Q2118593" url="?curid=724446" title="Winger (album)">
<text>Winger is the debut studio album by American rock band Winger. The album was released through Atlantic Records in 1988 and was produced by Beau Hill.

==Background==
The music was radio-friendly, but with a progressive twist. The lyrics, however, were typical of the age and genre.

The name &quot;Sahara&quot; appears in the lower right hand section of the album cover. The band initially wanted to call themselves &quot;Sahara&quot;, but that name was taken by another band at the time. Though they ultimately chose the name Winger, &quot;Sahara&quot; remained on the cover.

A number of radio and video hits were extracted from the album, including &quot;Headed for a Heartbreak&quot; and &quot;Seventeen&quot;, peaking at No. 19 and No. 26 at the &quot;Billboard&quot;″s single chart. On February 11, 1989, the album peaked at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and after that stayed on the chart for 63 weeks. It achieved platinum status in the United States and went gold in Canada and Japan.

In support of the album, Winger toured for over a year with Bad Company, Scorpions, Cinderella, Bon Jovi, Poison, Skid Row and Tesla.

Promotional videos were shot for the four singles &quot;Madalaine&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Headed for a Heartbreak&quot; and &quot;Hungry&quot;.

<text>Brotherhood of Death is a low-budget 1976 action film in the blaxploitation genre, directed by Richard F. Barker and Bill Berry, and starring Roy Jefferson, Le Tari, and Haskell Anderson. The film featured appearances by several members, including Jefferson, of the Washington Redskins professional football team of the National Football League.

==Plot==
In the mid-to-late 1960s, three young men leave their small Southern hometown to join the United States Army and fight in the Vietnam War. Upon their return home, they take up the cause of battling the racial injustices prevalent in the town. When the town&#x27;s Ku Klux Klan members offer a murderously violent reaction to their efforts, the trio uses the lessons they learned in the Special Forces, fighting the Vietcong, to conduct an all-out war against the Klan.

==Cast==
* Roy Jefferson as Raymond Moffat
* Le Tari as Ned Tiese
* Haskell Anderson as Junior Moffat
* Mike Thomas as Newton &quot;Newt&quot; Biggars
* Mick Hodge as &quot;Ace&quot;
* Ron David as Leroy Winniford
* Rick Ellis as Harold Turner
* Brian Donohue as Deputy Myrick
* Ed Heath as Preacher
* Mike Bass as Captain Quinn
* Bryan Clark as Sheriff
* Kandy Hooker as Louise Freeman
* Mark Robinson as Dope Dealer Soldier
* Vacountess E. Payne as Rose
* Jon Feather as Army Instructor 
* Holly Hjretberg as Leroy&#x27;s Girlfriend
* Barbara Cherry as Raymond&#x27;s Girlfriend

==Production==
The film was the brainchild of its executive producer, Ronald K. Goldman, a Washington, D.C. native and a veteran of blaxploitation film production. Guided by his previous experiences, Goldman devised a plan to make a film with a very low budget, to be produced entirely outside of the Hollywood establishment, and which he felt highly confident would still prove to be profitable.

Specifically, Goldman had deemed the quality of the acting in blaxploitation films to be unimpressive, even in those films which had been financially successful. Reasoning that even untrained actors could provide performances of similar quality, Goldman leveraged the fact that he knew some members of the Washington Redskins football team and convinced them to appear in his film. He thus gained some marquee value from their sports celebrity status without having to pay the higher salaries that would have been required to employ experienced actors who would have generated a similar level of public interest.

Goldman saved additional money by hiring a first-time director and having nearly the entire film shot in Montgomery County, near Washington. One exception was an actual Ku Klux Klan recruitment highway billboard which was featured in the film, suggesting the level of the Klan&#x27;s support and influence in the town depicted in the movie. Such billboards were a relatively common sight in the South during the mid-1960s time period that served as the film&#x27;s setting. However, by the time of filming in 1976, the majority of them had been removed. The billboard that was ultimately used in the movie (shown right) was filmed at its location on U.S. Route 70 at the city limits of Smithfield, North Carolina. The sign was maintained there until the late 1970s, making Smithfield one of the last towns that the filmmakers could have found which continued to have such a sign displayed.

The bar sequences were filmed at the Disabled American Veterans, Chapter #7 club house, located on Maryland Route 197 in Bowie, Maryland under the leadership of John &quot;Jack&quot; Federici, who appeared in the film
with several other disabled war veterans.

==Reception==
According to Goldman, his financial strategy of pursuing a very low budget succeeded in ensuring the profitability of &quot;Brotherhood of Death&quot;. Goldman reported that the film brought in approximately $1 million USD, after having been made at a cost of between $200,000 and $250,000. Nonetheless, the film was widely panned by critics, did not find a lasting place in the public consciousness, and became one of the essentially forgotten entries of the blaxploitation film era.

Among those who liked the film, however, was director Quentin Tarantino, and he would eventually give the film a renewed exposure. Tarantino has twice screened &quot;Brotherhood of Death&quot; at the Quentin Tarantino Film Festival, and the news of his advocacy of the film was among the factors that led to the decision to release it on DVD in 2005. Since then, it has aired numerous times on the Independent Film Channel (IFC) cable television network, with IFC&#x27;s Matt Singer having expressed admiration for the movie.

==Misidentification of the cast==
The liner notes in the DVD release of &quot;Brotherhood of Death&quot; incorrectly ascribe Tari&#x27;s and Anderson&#x27;s leading roles to Redskins players Mike Bass and Mike Thomas. Although Bass and Thomas were among the football players who appeared in the film, Jefferson was the only one of the three leading actors who was a Redskins player. Some reviewers, such as online film critic Harry Knowles, have similarly misidentified Redskins receiver Larry Jones as one of the three leading actors. In keeping with Goldman&#x27;s plan to utilize the players&#x27; marquee value as famed sports stars, the film&#x27;s one-sheet and other promotional materials featured the football players — even those with smaller roles — over unknown leading actors Tari and Anderson, perhaps contributing to the later misconceptions. In more recent years, &quot;Brotherhood of Death&quot; was made available as a dual release DVD with Fred Williamson&#x27;s &quot;One Down, Two to Go&quot;. Due to misleading crediting of the films on this release, the lead role in &quot;Brotherhood of Death&quot; was attributed to Fred Williamson, who in fact had no involvement in the feature.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Van Giersbergen was born in the small town of Sint-Michielsgestel, Netherlands. She began singing at age 7, when she participated in a music contest. At 12 years old she participated in her school choir where she studied and toured through France. Later, she took singing lessons and joined several bands. In 1992, she founded the duo &quot;Bad Breath&quot; with guitarist and singer Deniz Cagdas (Spencer Edgards), with music predominantly based on blues, jazz, folk and funk. She joined The Gathering in 1994, and is best known for her work with them.

=== The Gathering and several collaborations (1995–2006) ===
In 1998, she sang on the Ayreon album &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot;, a concept album telling the tale of an alien entity &#x27;kidnapping&#x27; eight human souls from different times. Van Giersbergen portrayed an Egyptian woman from the time of the pharaohs.

In 2006, she appeared on the album 2006 &quot;Rubicon&quot; from Asia band members&#x27; John Wetton and Geoffrey Downes on the tracks &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; and &quot;Tears of Joy&quot;. She also appears on the &quot;Smear Campaign&quot; by the grindcore-death metal band Napalm Death, on the tracks &quot;Weltschmerz&quot; and &quot;In Deference&quot;, contributing spoken rather than sung vocals &quot;for good effect and relevance to the track&quot;.

In June 2006, the epic rock band Globus released the album &quot;Epicon&quot;, which included Van Giersbergen&#x27;s vocal and writing contributions. Van Giersbergen co-wrote the lyrics for &quot;Mighty Rivers Run&quot;, and sang lead vocal on the track as well as dueting with Christine Navarro on the seminal &quot;Diem Ex Dei&quot;.

=== The Gathering departure, Agua de Annique and further collaborations (2007–2011) ===

On 5 June 2007 it was announced that Van Giersbergen would be leaving The Gathering in August 2007 to focus on a new project, Agua de Annique, and to spend more time with her family. She released three albums under this name, &quot;Air&quot; in 2007 and both &quot;Pure Air&quot; and &quot;In Your Room&quot; in 2009. On 24 November 2007, she performed the song &quot;Somewhere&quot; with Within Temptation in Eindhoven. Her 7 February 2008 performance of &quot;Somewhere&quot; with Within Temptation at the Ahoy Arena in Rotterdam was featured in the Within Temptation live DVD &quot;Black Symphony&quot;.

Van Giersbergen also sings on the Ayreon album &quot;01011001&quot;, released in early 2008. The character she portrays is one of the Forever, an alien being of the same race, who kidnapped her character from &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot;.

She sings on &quot;Scorpion Flower&quot; from the album &quot;Night Eternal&quot; (2008) from Moonspell. On 3 December 2008, she performed this song live with Moonspell at the 013 in Tilburg, The Netherlands.

Van Giersbergen collaborated with Devin Townsend on his albums &quot;Addicted&quot; in 2009, &quot;Epicloud&quot; in 2012, &quot;Sky Blue&quot; in 2014, &quot;Transcendence&quot; in 2016, and &quot;Empath&quot; in 2019.
She also appeared as guest vocalist on several Devin Townsend Project live shows including the second show in the By a Thread concert series in 2011 and The Retinal Circus in 2012, both of which were released as DVD.

She appeared as a guest vocalist on the debut album of &quot;The Human Experimente&quot;, a project which also features Robert Fripp (King Crimson), John Wetton (Asia, King Crimson), Maynard James Keenan (Tool, A Perfect Circle, Puscifer), Adrian Belew, U-G-O with Sean Kingston, and Dann Pursey (Globus, Vantan).

In 2011, Van Giersbergen collaborated with Yoav Goren on the song &quot;The Promise&quot;, the lead track on Globus second album &quot;Break From This World&quot;. She co-wrote lyrics and, along with Lisbeth Scott, was a featured vocalist on the track. She performed the track &quot;What Could Have Been&quot; for death-doom metal band Novembers Doom. Van Giersbergen also features on a track in the orchestral re-interpretations album from English progressive rock band Anathema, &quot;Falling Deeper&quot;, released on 5 September 2011. She toured with the band in South America, singing &quot;Everwake&quot; during concerts.

=== Solo career, The Gentle Storm and VUUR (2012–present) ===
Van Giersbergen released a solo album, &quot;Everything Is Changing&quot;, in 2012, followed by &quot;Drive&quot; in 2013.

On 22 April 2014, Arjen Anthony Lucassen revealed that his next project would be a collaboration with Van Giersbergen, their third work together after the Ayreon albums &quot;Into the Electric Castle&quot; and &quot;01011001&quot;. He described it as &quot;an epic double concept album, a combination of &#x27;classical meets metal&#x27; and &#x27;acoustic folk&#x27;.&quot; The project is named The Gentle Storm, with their first album released in 2015.

Later in 2015, Van Giersbergen collaborated again with Lucassen, portraying the character of Fear in the musical &quot;The Theater Equation&quot;, consisting of three shows of a semi-staged version of the Ayreon album &quot;The Human Equation&quot; (Mikael Åkerfeldt originally recorded the vocals for Fear on the album).

In February 2016, she released a collaboration album with the Icelandic band Árstíðir called &quot;Verloren Verleden&quot;.

On 1 December 2016, she announced the creation of her new band, named VUUR, with musicians coming mostly from The Gentle Storm live band. Their debut album was released in 2017.

In September 2017, she was a performer in the &#x27;Ayreon Universe&#x27; concert series at 013 in Tilburg.

In 2018 she performed on &quot;Amongst Stars&quot; from Finnish Heavy Metal band Amorphis&#x27; album Queen of Time, including appearing on the official music video. She also performed in two concerts alongside Residentie Orkest The Hague covering songs from Van Giersbergen&#x27;s whole career, later released in the live album &quot;Symphonized&quot; in October.

In 2019, she toured the Netherlands on an acoustic theatre tour &#x27;Inchecken&#x27;, performing a career-spanning setlist alongside VUUR bandmate Ferry Duijsens in over 40 Dutch theatres, touring from January to March.
She also joined Amorphis and Delain for their 2019 North American tour, performing a solo setlist as well as performing &quot;Amongst Stars&quot; alongside Amorphis during their set. On 16 November, she announced a solo album titled &quot;The Darkest Skies Are the Brightest&quot;, set for release on 26 February 2021.

<doc id="724477" wikidata="Q1756608" url="?curid=724477" title="Phantom Planet">
<text>Phantom Planet is an American rock band from Los Angeles, formed in 1994. The band consists of Alex Greenwald (vocals, rhythm guitar), Darren Robinson (lead guitar), Sam Farrar (bass guitar) and Jeff Conrad (drums). The band is best known for its track &quot;California&quot;, which became the theme song for the TV series &quot;The O.C.&quot;. The band featured actor Jason Schwartzman on drums until 2003.

On November 25, 2008, the band announced in a blog entry on their website that they are going on &quot;hiatus, and will not be playing any more live shows or making any new records, indefinitely.&quot; They played their last pre-hiatus show on December 12, 2008, in Los Angeles.

The band reunited in 2019, announcing that their hiatus was over.

==History==
===Early years and &quot;Phantom Planet Is Missing&quot; (1994–1999)===
Phantom Planet was named in 1994 after a 1961 B-movie called &quot;The Phantom Planet&quot;. While still in their teens, the group played frequently in and around the Hollywood area, finally catching the eye of Geffen Records executives. Phantom Planet signed with Geffen in 1997 and released their first album, &quot;Phantom Planet Is Missing&quot; in 1998. The album did not impact any major charts. The album was followed by the release of the single &quot;So I Fall Again&quot; in September 1998, which was also released to promote the soundtrack &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch: The Album&quot;.

===&quot;The Guest&quot; and &quot;Phantom Planet&quot; (2002–2004)===
Shortly thereafter Geffen Records folded into Universal as part of a major record industry merger, and within a few years Phantom Planet had signed with Epic Records. Charlotte Froom, the daughter of producer Mitchell Froom, caught the band&#x27;s show at a time when the group was looking for a producer to record their second effort. Froom approached her father to produce the group, and after meeting with Phantom Planet, he agreed. Froom also brought in engineer Tchad Blake to work on the record.

&quot;The Guest&quot; was released in 2002. The group toured for almost 18 months both as a headliner and an opening act, and in late 2002 the band got the opportunity to open for one of their collective idols, Elvis Costello. &quot;The Guest&quot; got an extra boost when the record&#x27;s song &quot;California&quot; was chosen as the theme song for the Fox Network&#x27;s hit TV series &quot;The O.C.&quot;. As a result, the record was reissued in late 2003 with bonus tracks and a new cover.

The band&#x27;s eponymous third album in 2004 marked a change in both the band&#x27;s sound and lineup. Ditching their radio-friendly pop rock, the band moved towards a garage rock sound. Lead singer Alex Greenwald said it was an intentional choice: &quot;I especially loved bands, like The Beatles, that changed with every single record they made. That&#x27;s been our plan from the get-go. We want our records to be like experiments. We want to have fun with the music. People can hear when you&#x27;re not having fun.&quot; In the middle of recording the album, founding member and drummer Jason Schwartzman abruptly left the band to focus on his acting career. He was replaced by Jeff Conrad, who helped record the remainder of the album. &quot;Phantom Planet&quot; was released to mixed reviews from critics. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, guitarist Jacques Brautbar left the band to pursue a career in photography. The band performed &quot;Big Brat&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

===&quot;Raise the Dead&quot; and hiatus (2007–2008)===
Early on in the recording process of their fourth studio album, Phantom Planet&#x27;s contract with Epic Records expired and they signed to Fueled by Ramen. &quot;Raise the Dead&quot; was released on April 15, 2008. When describing the new record, Greenwald described it as &quot;a concept record. If The Beatles had &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s&quot; and The Rolling Stones had &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;, we have our &#x27;Leader.&#x27; We&#x27;re concocting it, but at the same time we&#x27;re following it.&quot; The first single from the album was &quot;Do the Panic&quot;.

On November 25, 2008, Phantom Planet announced in a blog entry on their website that they would be going on hiatus and playing their last show December 12, 2008 at The Troubadour in Los Angeles.

===First reunion (2012–2013)=== 
In late January 2012, Phantom Planet announced their first reunion show, June 13, at The Troubadour in Los Angeles. On January 31, they announced the addition of a second Troubadour show to be played June 14, 2012. Former member of the band, Jacques Brautbar, joined them for songs at the June 13 show.

In August 2013, the band, under Alex Greenwald &amp; Phriends, performed a new song titled Balisong, which ended up being on Greenwald&#x27;s solo album and later released in 2019 as a single by the full band. This performance did not have bassist Sam Farrar because he was touring with Maroon 5. He was replaced by Jamiroquai bassist Stuart Zender.

===Second reunion and &quot;Devastator&quot; (2019–present)===
A Phantom Planet Instagram account was created on January 19, 2019, indicating that the band could be reforming. Additionally, band members posted the logo on their personal social media accounts. It was confirmed that the band played a small secret private show January 19, 2019, at No Name on Fairfax in Los Angeles.

On March 18, 2019, the band officially announced &quot;Hiatus. Over.&quot; They announced their first &quot;public&quot; show in over seven years at Hanson&#x27;s &quot;Hop Jam&quot; Music and Beer Festival in Tulsa, Oklahoma on May 19, 2019. Before that event, they scheduled three shows across Southern California.

On May 7, the band officially released their first song in 11 years, &quot;Balisong&quot;. The song was a reworked version of a track previously released on Alex&#x27;s solo album. In March 2020, Phantom Planet announced the release of their fifth album &quot;Devastator&quot; on May 8, 2020, and their first album in 12 years since &quot;Raise the Dead&quot; (2008). However, the album was delayed to June 19, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was later pushed again one day earlier June 18, as a way of showing respect and support to the Black Lives Matter movement.

==Side projects and related work==
In September 2009, Alex Greenwald officially announced the tracks for his solo record. He posted the track listing and a CD mockup to his Twitter account. The debut solo studio album by Alexander Greenwald, &quot;Yo&quot;, was released on May 5, 2014.

Greenwald has co-produced and appeared on ex – Panic! at the Disco members, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker&#x27;s new band, The Young Veins debut record, &quot;Take a Vacation!&quot;. He has also produced a few tracks on the band The Like&#x27;s new album. More recently, Greenwald recorded with Mark Ronson &amp; the Business Intl, playing guitar, keyboards, and singing on the album.

Alex Greenwald was a part of the group Phases. He is also helping fellow band member Darren Robinson in his side project Twin Terrors.

Sam Farrar joined a band called Operation Aloha with members of Gomez, Maroon 5. Operation Aloha&#x27;s self-titled, fourth full-length album was released on May 12, 2009. It was recorded over a period of 30 days in Maui, Hawaii.

Since 2012, Farrar is touring with Maroon 5 – as an additional band member – on guitars, occasionally on the bass guitar, percussion, backing vocals, turntables and providing samples and other special effects (using the MPC). He co-wrote and co-produced a few of the band&#x27;s songs on almost all of their studio albums and also remixed one of their songs, which is called &quot;Woman&quot;, on &quot;Call and Response: The Remix Album&quot;, released in 2008. On August 31, 2012 – during a show in Argentina on the &quot;Overexposed&quot; World Tour – Farrar filled-in for Mickey Madden on the bass guitar for the very first time. He subsequently filled-in for Madden on the next few shows of the tour. In 2016, he has become an official member.

Darren Robinson went on tour with the band Miniature Tigers in January, February and March 2009. He toured as member of singer/songwriter John Graney&#x27;s Southern California surf band The Californian, in the summer of 2009. The band then included John Graney (vocals), himself (guitar and vocals), Jonathan Price (guitar Keys and vocals), Wendy Wang (bass and vocals), Mike Hopkins (drums).

Darren has three projects, Twin Terrors, Dead Honcho, which has songs uploaded to SoundCloud, and Fist Fright with Andrew Parker, which currently has three songs posted on Bandcamp.

Jeff Conrad has a project called Vibe Mountain.

==In popular culture==
The band has opened for many well-known artists, including Guns N&#x27; Roses, Sting, Elvis Costello, Incubus, Guided by Voices, Blink-182, The Zombies, The Hives, Sloan, American Hi-Fi, Maroon 5, Ludacris, Panic! at the Disco, The Rocket Summer, Hanson (band) and Paramore.

Phantom Planet has appeared on &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;, performing &quot;So I Fall Again&quot;. They have also appeared on &quot;American Dreams&quot;, playing British rock band The Zombies and performing &quot;Tell Her No&quot; in the episode &quot;A Clear and Present Danger&quot;. The song &quot;Lonely Day&quot; appeared in the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;. They have appeared in the 2005 film &quot;Bad News Bears&quot;, playing as a fictional &quot;skate&quot; band called The Bloodfarts.
In 2005, they covered the CSNY track &quot;Our House&quot; for the movie &quot;The Chumscrubber&quot;.
Phantom Planet also performed a cover of Jackson Browne&#x27;s &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Baby&quot; for &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot;. &quot;Big Brat&quot; was also introduced in the soundtrack to the video game &quot;Driver 3&quot; and featured in an episode from the first season of &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, as well as used in the film &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. Alex Greenwald, the band&#x27;s vocalist, sang a fusion jazz cover of Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Just&quot; for the 2006 compilation &quot;Exit Music: Songs with Radio Heads&quot;.
Sam Farrar also contributed to the Hanson album &quot;Underneath&quot;, on the song &quot;Lost Without Each Other&quot;.
In 2008, &quot;Raise the Dead&quot; was featured in an episode from the second season of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; and &quot;Do the Panic&quot; was featured on the &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; soundtrack, &quot;OMFGG – Original Music Featured on Gossip Girl&quot;.
Their music has been heard frequently on television, most notably &quot;California&quot;, as the theme song for the popular TV show &quot;The O.C.&quot;, and the songs &quot;Do the Panic&quot; and &quot;Dropped&quot; in various commercials. Greenwald made an impact on the British music scene in early 2008 by featuring on Mark Ronson&#x27;s cover of the Radiohead song &quot;Just&quot;.

<doc id="724494" wikidata="Q109284110" url="?curid=724494" title="Swanston Street">
<text>Swanston Street is a major thoroughfare in the Melbourne central business district, Victoria, Australia. It was laid out in 1837 as part of the original Hoddle Grid. The street vertically bisects Melbourne&#x27;s city centre and is famous as the world&#x27;s busiest tram corridor, for its heritage buildings and as a shopping strip.

Swanston Street runs roughly north–south in-between Russell Street to the east and Elizabeth Street to the west. To the south it becomes St Kilda Road after the intersection with Flinders Street, whilst the road&#x27;s northern end is in the suburb of Carlton at Melbourne Cemetery. This northern section was originally named Madeline Street. The street is named after merchant, banker and politician Charles Swanston.

==History==
Swanston Street was one of the main north–south streets originally laid out as part of the 1837 Hoddle Grid. Originally carrying pedestrians and horse-drawn traffic, the street resembled many typical European avenues of the 19th century. By the end of the 19th century it also accommodated one of the major tram lines through the city. With the advent of the automobile in the early 20th century, the street became a major thoroughfare, carrying car traffic between areas north of the city and St Kilda Road throughout most of the 20th century.

In the latter half of the 20th century, the southern half of the street had problems with heavy traffic and its associated pollution, homelessness, loitering, and a plethora of discount stores, fast food outlets, sex shops and strip joints.

As part of Victoria&#x27;s 150th birthday celebrations, Swanston Street was closed to traffic, turfed and treed between Flinders Street and Lonsdale Street for a Summer street-party on February 9-10, 1985. The conversation then began around the permanent transformation of Swanston Street. In March 1992, the street was closed to daytime private through-traffic between Flinders and La Trobe Streets, roughly half its length. This section is known as &quot;Swanston Street Walk&quot;. Swanston Street was redeveloped in 1992 with a number of public sculptures being established through the Percent for Art Program. The most famous of these statues is of a small bronze dog called Larry La Trobe by Melbourne artist, Pamela Irving. By the turn of the 21st century, the street carried nine tram routes, with the frequency of trams being the highest in Melbourne.

In November 2008, the newly elected Lord Mayor of Melbourne Robert Doyle proposed returning private vehicle traffic to the street. The move attracted opposition from the Public Transport Users Association, Australian Greens and Bicycle Victoria. The idea was rejected and, by January 2010, plans to make the entire length of Swanston Street in the city car-free were announced by the Lord Mayor himself, a complete reversal of his previous stance.

===Use for marches, rallies and protests===
Many marches, rallies and protests involve the use of Swanston Street, resulting in planned and unplanned road closures. The street is the venue for many annual events, including the Moomba parade, the AFL Grand Final parade and Melbourne Cup parade. It is also the major route for the Anzac Day parade because Swanston Street leads into St Kilda Road, the site of the Shrine of Remembrance. 

===Becoming car free===
Swanston Street was one of the busiest roads in Melbourne, carrying a large volume of private car traffic, mostly transiting through the city. In 1992, the street was made partially car-free, with limited exemptions for small freight, buses and private cars during certain times of the day. After that, proposals for the street to become entirely car-free gained momentum.

On 27 January 2010, it was announced that the entire length of Swanston Street would become car free. The $25.6 million proposal included plans for several city squares along the street and several large tram stops. Aside from trams, the only motorised vehicular access was for emergency vehicles and small-scale freight at certain times. The modifications to the street commenced in late 2011 and were completed in late 2012.

== Notable buildings ==
Many of Melbourne&#x27;s most noteworthy precincts and prominent buildings face Swanston Street as the city&#x27;s historic main avenue, including:

* Flinders Street railway station
* Federation Square
* Young and Jackson Hotel
* Nicholas Building
* St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral
* Melbourne Town Hall
* Capitol Theatre
* City Square
* Westin Hotel Melbourne
* Manchester Unity Building
* Curtin House
* Chinatown Archway
* QV Village
* State Library of Victoria
* Melbourne Central Shopping Centre 
* City Baths 
Both the University of Melbourne and RMIT University also have campus buildings fronting Swanston Street.

==Transport==
Tram routes 1, 3, 5, 6, 16, 64, 67 and 72 currently run along the street, with the frequency of trams making Swanston Street the world&#x27;s busiest tram corridor. Two of the busiest railway stations in Melbourne are located near the street, with the hub Flinders Street station at its southern end and, further north, the underground Melbourne Central station at the intersection of La Trobe Street. The Metro Tunnel is being constructed under Swanston Street, and should be completed in 2025.

Swanston Street is also a major route for commuting cyclists to and through the city, with bike lanes from the northern suburbs and from St Kilda Road in the south, and the Capital City Trail on the Southbank of the Yarra River.

The parking of tour buses along the street caused controversy in September 2008 when a young cyclist was killed by a bus as it turned out of a parking spot. There had previously been calls to the council to relocate the large buses from the street where there was little space between buses and trams.

Swanston Street was previously served by bus services to Gardenvale and Middle Brighton. When Melbourne-Brighton Bus Lines&#x27; licence periodically came up for review, the Melbourne City Council and Melbourne &amp; Metropolitan Tramways Board always opposed. Finally the buses were removed from Swanston Street in October 1989, by which time they were operated by the Public Transport Corporation.

==In popular culture==
Swanston Street was the shooting location for the 1976 video for AC/DC&#x27;s song &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot;. It led to a nearby street being renamed ACDC Lane in honour of the music video.

It is also referenced in The Distillers&#x27; song &quot;Dismantle Me&quot;, as singer Brody Dalle is originally from Melbourne, as well as TISM&#x27;s song &quot;Get Thee in My Behind Satan&quot; and Courtney Barnett&#x27;s &quot;Elevator Operator&quot;.

Jane Halifax (Rebecca Gibney) of the Halifax f.p. television series is shown living in an apartment at 339 Swanston Street (Jensen House; now converted into a UniLodge) opposite the State Library.

<text>Stéphane Georges Mallat (born 24 October 1962) is a French applied mathematician, concurrently appointed as Professor at Collège de France and École normale supérieure. He made fundamental contributions to the development of wavelet theory in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He has additionally done work in applied mathematics, signal processing, music synthesis and image segmentation.

With Yves Meyer, he developed the multiresolution analysis (MRA) construction for compactly supported wavelets. His MRA wavelet construction made the implementation of wavelets practical for engineering applications by demonstrating the equivalence of wavelet bases and conjugate mirror filters used in discrete, multirate filter banks in signal processing. He also developed (with Sifen Zhong) the wavelet transform modulus maxima method for image characterization, a method that uses the local maxima of the wavelet coefficients at various scales to reconstruct images.

He introduced the scattering transform that constructs invariance for object recognition purposes. Mallat is the author of &quot;A Wavelet Tour of Signal Processing&quot; (1999; ), a text widely used in applied mathematics and engineering courses.

He has held teaching positions at New York University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, École polytechnique and at the Ecole normale supérieure. He is currently Professor of Data Science at College de France.

In 1998 he was a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin.

<text>Eurodance (sometimes referred to as Euro-NRG) is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in the late 1980s in Europe. It combines many elements of rap, techno and Eurodisco. This genre of music is heavily influenced by the use of rich vocals, sometimes with rapped verses. This, combined with cutting-edge synthesizers, strong bass rhythm and melodic hooks, establishes the core foundation of Eurodance music.

==History==
===Background===
Eurodance music originated in the late 1980s in central Europe, especially in Germany, where rave parties were becoming popular. By 1987, a German party scene was started, based on the well established Chicago house sound and Belgian new beat. The following year saw acid house making a significant impact on popular consciousness in Germany and central Europe as it had in England. In 1989, German DJs Westbam and Dr. Motte established the Ufo Club, an illegal party venue, and co-founded the Love Parade. The parade first occurred in July 1989, when 150 people took to the streets in Berlin. It was conceived as a political demonstration for peace and international understanding through love and music. On 19 July 1989, Black Box&#x27;s single &quot;Ride on Time&quot; was released. The song spent six weeks at No. 1 in the United Kingdom and it was the UK&#x27;s best-selling single of 1989. It contained the Korg M1&#x27;s &quot;house piano&quot; which can be found in many Eurodance releases. On 27 September 1989, Technotronic&#x27;s single &quot;Pump Up the Jam&quot; was released. It reached number one in Belgium and Spain, and it popularised the house variant called hip house in Europe. On 9 November 1989, the Berlin Wall fell; free underground techno parties mushroomed in East Berlin, and a rave scene comparable to that in the UK was established. East German DJ Paul van Dyk has remarked that the techno-based rave scene was a major force in re-establishing social connections between East and West Germany during the unification period. In the same year, German producers Michael Münzing and Luca Anzilotti (under the pseudonyms Benito Benites and John &quot;Virgo&quot; Garrett III) formed the Snap! project in Frankfurt. Snap! songs combined imported hip hop and soul vocals adding rhythm by using computer technology and mixing electronic sounds, bass and drums, mainly house music. By doing so a new genre was born: Eurodance.

===Rise and fall===
Snap!&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Power&quot;, released in 1990, reached number one in the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and it helped to raise awareness of the genre within Europe. In the following years, other Eurodance acts formed in Frankfurt, including Jam and Spoon, Intermission and Culture Beat. After the breakthrough single &quot;Rhythm is a Dancer&quot; by Snap! in 1992 (number 1 in 12 countries), new groups started to appear all over Europe, mainly in Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy. From 1992 until the genre&#x27;s decline in popularity after 1995, the sound became increasingly NRG-oriented, leading to songs raising in beats per minute up to 150. Some of the genre&#x27;s defining songs in this period, dubbed as the &quot;golden era&quot; of Eurodance, are &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; by Dr. Alban in 1992 (number 1 in 8 countries), &quot;No Limit&quot; by Dutch group 2 Unlimited in 1993 (number 1 in 14 countries, it was Europe&#x27;s biggest-selling song for 1993), &quot;What Is Love&quot; by Haddaway in the same year (number 1 in 13 countries), &quot;Mr. Vain&quot; by Culture Beat also in the same year (number 1 in 13 countries), &quot;Cotton Eye Joe&quot; by Rednex in 1994 (number 1 in 12 countries) and &quot;Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)&quot; by Scatman John in the same year (number 1 in 9 countries). In the same period, the genre&#x27;s popularity also expanded further to East Asia, in nations such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan; towards the end of the golden era also in Russia.

By 1995, Eurodance dominated European charts with 5 singles in the top 10 of the singles charts. Despite its success, many observers within the music industry said that the Eurodance sound had to change or die, and Eurodance producers and singers started to follow different paths and different sounds, such as happy hardcore and house music, but not all the groups followed this trend immediately. Notably, the group 2 Unlimited wanted to remain within Eurodance sounds in order to remain chartbusters, although the producer De Coster predicted a retreat from a pop-like to a more club-like sound. After a string of successful Eurodance hits, the producer Nosie Katzmann called angrily the record label because one of the songs dropped at number 26 in the German charts. Therefore, in the second half of the decade the popularity of Eurodance started to decline. &quot;Scatman&#x27;s World&quot; by Scatman John was the last major hit of the original Eurodance sound in the Eurochart Hot 100, being number 1 for 3 weeks between late August and early September 1995. Just before that, La Bouche released &quot;Be My Lover&quot;, which has sold six million copies worldwide to date. 

In the late 1990s, the classic Eurodance sound gradually morphed into progressive house. Notable examples of successful Eurodance songs of this era are &quot;Coco Jamboo&quot; by German band Mr. President in 1996, &quot;Freed from Desire&quot; and &quot;Let a Boy Cry&quot; by Italian singer Gala, &quot;This is Your Night&quot; by Amber and &quot;Bailando&quot; by Paradisio in the same year, &quot;Barbie Girl&quot; by Danish-Norwegian group Aqua in 1997, &quot;Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!!&quot; by Dutch group Vengaboys in 1998, &quot;Blue (Da Ba Dee)&quot; by Italian group Eiffel 65 in 1999 and &quot;Around the World (La La La La La)&quot; by German group ATC in 2000. Basshunter, Scooter and Cascada saw significant success during the 2000s, however, by the early 2010s, popularity waned, and by about 2012, Eurodance music disappeared almost completely from the majority of European radio airplay.

==Definition==
The term &quot;Eurodance&quot; gradually became associated with a specific style of European dance music. During its golden years in the mid-1990s, it was referred as &quot;Euro-NRG&quot;; in Europe it was often called &quot;dancefloor&quot;.

While some use a much broader definition of what is considered &quot;Eurodance&quot;, over time, the term particularly came to refer to an NRG-based genre from the 1990s which included a solo vocalist or a rapper/vocalist duet. 

==Characteristics of the music==
Most Eurodance is characterized by synthesizer riffs, one or more vocals with simple chorus, one or more rap parts, sampling and a drum machine clap beat. Sometimes non-rap vocals are used.

Eurodance often carries a positive, upbeat attitude; the lyrics usually involve issues of love and peace, dancing and partying, or expressing and overcoming difficult emotions. The early to mid-1990s Eurodance vocals were frequently done by a solo vocalist or a mixed rapper-vocalist duet such as the male–female duets of 2 Unlimited, La Bouche and Magic Affair.

Many groups used variations of the rapper-vocalist theme, such as a German rapper with American singers (Real McCoy), or the use of reggae rap as in Ice MC and Fun Factory, or combination of rapper and reggae vocalist like in the &quot;Life in the Streets&quot; album, or scat singing as in Scatman John. Solo singing artists such as Alexia, Whigfield and DJ BoBo also contributed to the genre. Some acts like the Swedish dance-pop originated group Ace of Base use more pop vocals rather than rap/soul vocals along with Eurodance sound. Pop vocals were particularly popular in the late 1990s Eurodance productions. The Swedish group Rednex also introduced American country music elements into the sound.

Eurodance lyrics are almost always sung in English, regardless of the artist&#x27;s nationalities. However, there are cases like in the Belgian group&#x27;s Paradisio where Spanish lyrics are used along with latin music elements.

Almost all Eurodance emphasizes percussion and rhythm. The tempo is typically around 140 beats per minute, but may vary from 110 to 150.

Most Eurodance is very melody-driven. Most Eurodance songs are in minor keys, similarly to techno. This, along with positive lyrics, helps contribute to the overall powerful and emotional sound of Eurodance. Besides the contribution of the female or male vocals, there is often a noticeable use of rapid synthesizer arpeggios.

===Music videos===
Eurodance music videos were often seen with dance acts by the main vocals of the songs (or models ad-libbing), often dancing in bright-coloured infinity cove studios or wide, urban spaces (stations, parking garages) with high visual contrast, or in empty nature scenes. 

Electronicbeats describes the cliché Eurodance music video as having &quot;strobe-lit rave scenes, pixelated ‘90s computer graphics and, of course, an urban montage: cue the subway stations, streetlights and business commuters&quot;. &quot;Pump up the Jams music video is described as having a &quot;colour scheme of brilliant reds, greens and purples in a staggering array of chequered backdrops [...] [It is] a great insight tot the power of music videos on party wardrobes&quot;. Bright, sometimes over-saturated colour schemes were used, with contemporary party clothing or outfits referring to space-age, with videos that were fully or in part using computer-generated imagery elements and effects.
Large, sometimes digitally multiplied, dance troupes also frequently featured. 

As the music is largely electronically generated, shots of artists in studios or playing at concerts, frequent in videos of other genres, were infrequent.

==Popularity==
===In Europe===

From the early to mid-1990s, Eurodance was popular in Europe; the style received extensive airplay on radio stations and television shows, resulting in many singles appearing in the charts. Technotronic from Belgium had hits with &quot;Pump Up the Jam&quot; and &quot;Get Up&quot; (featuring Ya Kid K).
In Italy, there were seven singles in the top ten of the chart at the end of May 1995. At the height of the popularity of the genre, it influenced other musical genres such as Mákina in Spain and disco polo in Poland, and it spearheaded the birth of the regional variant Italo dance in Italy.

By 1996, the popularity of this genre had started to decline. From then, the classic Eurodance sound gradually morphed into progressive house. By 1997 and towards the end of the millennium house and trance music increased popularity over Eurodance in Europe&#x27;s commercial, chart-oriented dance records. In the early 2000s, the mainstream music industry in Europe moved away from Eurodance in favour of other styles of dance music such as nu-disco, electro house, dance-pop and R&amp;B.

====United Kingdom====
After Cappella&#x27;s Gianfranco Bortolotti set up Media Records in Brescia, northern Italy to release his &#x27;commercial European dance music&#x27; (a set-up which included fifteen studios featuring various production teams working almost non-stop on a huge number of records) he decided to take the label into other markets and set up a UK office in the UK. Run by Peter Pritchard and featuring many records by Stu Allan&#x27;s British Eurodance act Clock, this record company would eventually turn into hard house label Nukleuz (known for its DJ Nation releases).

As Media turned into Nukleuz, it would fall to All Around the World Productions to be the label in the 21st Century which was more likely to release Eurodance tracks in the UK than other, with its Clubland TV music channel still having regular blocks of Eurodance videos in 2020 (though extending its scope to include hits by David Guetta as well as Cascada and Scooter)

===North America===
====Canada====
During the 1990s, Eurodance became popular in Canada, which produced its own variant called Candance (although it was mostly referred to as &quot;Eurodance&quot; or &quot;dance music&quot;). Eurodance received significant airplay on radio stations in the Greater Toronto Area such as Power 88.5, Energy 108 and Hot 103.5. Montreal was also a major Eurodance market, with MC Mario&#x27;s famous radio show on Mix 96, called &quot;Party Mix&quot; and &quot;Bouge de là&quot;, a popular TV show on MusiquePlus. Eurodance featured prominently on &quot;Electric Circus&quot;, a dance-party TV show broadcast nationally in English and French versions. Beginning in mid-1992, Eurodance began to dominate the &quot;RPM&quot; dance chart in Canada, with acts such as 2 Unlimited, Snap!, Captain Hollywood Project, Culture Beat, Haddaway, Whigfield, each reaching number-one.

From approximately 1992 to 2000, Canadian acts such as Capital Sound, Love Inc., Jacynthe and Emjay had success with the Eurodance sound. The Toronto sound was more pop-oriented, while the Montreal one was more house-oriented.

====United States====
While Eurodance is well known in major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Miami, Eurodance did not make as big of an impact in the rest of the country. Exemplifying this is the Eurodance classic &quot;Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)&quot;, by Scatman John, an American artist; despite topping the charts in multiple European countries and reaching number 3 in the United Kingdom, it only reached as high as &quot;number 60&quot; on the US Hot 100. Another notable example is the &quot;Life in the Streets&quot; album, a combined Eurodance music project from American rapper Marky Mark and Caribbean reggae vocalist Prince Ital Joe, which was not released in the United States, but was a huge success in several European countries including singles like &quot;Happy People&quot; and &quot;United&quot; that topped the German charts.

A few Eurodance artists including 2 Unlimited, Haddaway, La Bouche and Ace of Base made the Rhythmic Top 40, Top 40 Mainstream and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 during the early to mid-1990s. However, the sound tended to be more house and the rap-oriented artists received airplay. For instance, the German hip-house project Snap!, the Belgian hip-house project Technotronic and the Dutch techno dance project L.A. Style received quite a bit of airplay early on.

The more Hi-NRG-oriented artists were typically played only during special &quot;mix&quot; shows, and it was often necessary to go to a club to hear Eurodance music. While Eurodance did become popular with club DJs in the United States, radio stations were cautious about playing anything that sounded too much like disco during most of the 1980s and 1990s. By the end of the 1990s, however, some of the later acts such as Italian group Eiffel 65 and Danish group Aqua did receive extensive airplay.

Despite lack of widespread radio play, many Hi-NRG and Eurodance songs are popular at professional sporting events in the United States, especially ice hockey and basketball.

Compilation albums, such as the &quot;DMA Dance: Eurodance&quot; series of compilation albums (1995–1997) from Interhit Records and &quot;Dance Music Authority&quot; magazine, were popular and helped to define the genre as well as to make it accessible in the U.S. and Canada.

== Hands up ==
Hands up (also known as handz up! (stylized as HandzUp!) or dancecore in Eastern Europe) is a style of trance music, and a derivation of Eurodance. The genre comes from its name, meaning music that requires listeners to &quot;put their hands up&quot;, as well as fitness and danceability.

The genre developed in Germany in the mid- to late 1990s as part of the emerging trance music scene. Representatives of Eurodance such as Starsplash and Mark &#x27;Oh are sometimes regarded as forerunners of hands up. The biggest commercial success was the music until the mid-2000s.

The synthesizer melodies are often catchy and simple. Often the vocal melody is accompanied by a synthesizer. In contrast to techno, short, high-pitched synthesizer tones are used. Hands up does not rely on the structure of tension build-up, but rather is based on the typical verse-chorus pop music scheme. The main elements are the bassline, drums and a catchy lead sound. A typical stylistic device of hands up is pitched female or resulting feminine vocals, but male vocals are also common. In addition, distorted, autotuned, chopped and repeated spoken phrases are common characteristics.

DJs &amp; groups such as Manian, Rob Mayth, Rocco &amp; Bass-T, DJ Gollum, Scooter, ItaloBrothers, Klubbingman, Discotronic, Ma.Bra., and Megastylez etc. are representative figures of this subgenre in both Germany and around the world.

<text>David Helfgott (born 19 May 1947) is an Australian concert pianist whose life inspired the Academy Award-winning film &quot;Shine&quot;, in which he was portrayed by actors Geoffrey Rush, Noah Taylor and Alex Rafalowicz.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Helfgott was born in Melbourne to Polish Jewish parents Rachel (née Granek) and Elias Peter Helfgott. He won the state final of the ABC Instrumental and Vocal Competition.

=== London studies and mental illness ===
The awards he won at the Royal College of Music included the Dannreuther Prize for Best Concerto Performance, for his performance of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3, and the Marmaduke Barton Prize.

During his time in London, he began showing more definite manifestations of schizoaffective disorder. He returned to Perth in 1970. The following year, he married Hungarian Jewish immigrant Claire Papp, who had four children. He worked as a rehearsal pianist for the Western Australian Opera Company.

In 1983, his brother Les Helfgott found him a job working at a Perth wine bar called Riccardo&#x27;s. The co-owner of the bar was a doctor, Chris Reynolds, who played a significant part in Helfgott&#x27;s rehabilitation and also introduced him to Gillian Murray, whom Helfgott married in 1984.

=== &quot;Shine&quot; ===
Helfgott was the subject of the 1996 film &quot;Shine&quot;, which dealt with the pianist&#x27;s formative years and struggle with mental illness. Helfgott was portrayed by actors Geoffrey Rush (adult), Noah Taylor (teenager) and Alex Rafalowicz (child). His brother Les has described the portrayal of their father in both &quot;Shine&quot; and in Gillian Helfgott&#x27;s biography as &quot;all outright lies&quot;. David Helfgott&#x27;s first wife Claire Papp has also said that Peter Helfgott was &quot;quite badly maligned&quot; in the film.

In a letter to the editor of &quot;Limelight&quot;, published in the September 2013 edition, Margaret and Les Helfgott refer to certain claims made in an article in the August 2013 edition and state that &quot;there was no estrangement from members of Helfgott&#x27;s family following his return to Australia. On the contrary, he moved straight back into the family home, and was cared for by our family. Dad was not &#x27;overbearing&#x27;, and his main objection to David&#x27;s going abroad was his concern for his son&#x27;s welfare.&quot;

=== Current musical career ===
Helfgott generally prefers to perform Romantic music, mostly Mussorgsky, Rachmaninoff, Chopin, Liszt, Schumann and Rimsky-Korsakov. However, his recordings and performances, especially that of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3, have been criticized as &quot;pallid, erratic and incoherent.&quot; Of the two commercial recordings released by RCA, the American journal &quot;Fanfare Magazine&quot; was critical not only of Helfgott himself, but also of his producers, who were &quot;marketing Helfgott&#x27;s pain.&quot; The British magazine &quot;Gramophone&quot; was similarly scathing about the exploitative nature of their issue, which, the magazine said, falsely marketed Helfgott as an &quot;unsung genius&quot;.

On stage, Helfgott is known for his unusual platform manner. In 1997, critic Anthony Tommasini noted that Helfgott &quot;stares into the hall and renders a nonstop commentary of grunts, groans and mutterings&quot;. Of a 1997 Helfgott recital in New Zealand, critic Denis Dutton wrote, &quot;If, as Goethe claimed, architecture is frozen music, David Helfgott is the musician who finally proves the converse: that music can also be melted architecture – a structureless rubble of notes.&quot;

Helfgott played piano in the Silverchair song &quot;Emotion Sickness&quot;.

Helfgott tours Australia annually and plays a small number of recitals in other countries.

His 2015 European tour was the subject of a documentary, &quot;Hello, I Am David!&quot;

== Personal life ==
Helfgott lives in The Promised Land, a valley near Bellingen in New South Wales. His second wife Gillian died in 2022, aged 90. In a 2016 interview, Gillian stated that Helfgott &quot;has been misdiagnosed for decades&quot;, does not have schizophrenia, and had recently been diagnosed with autism.

==Discography==
===Albums===
==Awards and nominations==
Helfgott was awarded an honorary doctorate of music by Edith Cowan University in 2004.

He was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in the 2021 Australia Day Honours.

===ARIA Music Awards===
The ARIA Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony that recognises excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of Australian music. They commenced in 1987.

<text>Mirage is the name of two fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The first was a minor villain of Batman. The second is a heroine affiliated with the Teen Titans.

==Fictional character biography==
===Mike===
The first Mirage is Mike, a normal man who uses a special gem to generate illusions. Batman destroys the gem, but Mirage uses its fragments to create contact lenses that possess the same effect. In &quot;52&quot;, Mirage is killed by Bruno Mannheim.

=== Miriam Delgado ===
The second Mirage, Miriam Delgado, is a member of the Team Titans and part of a resistance against the dictator Lord Chaos. While traveling in time to prevent Chaos&#x27; birth, Mirage is raped by her former lover Deathwing and eventually gives birth to a daughter, Julienne.

In &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot;, Mirage learns that she is a Brazilian street urchin who the Time Trapper kidnapped and implanted with false memories.

==Powers and abilities==
Both incarnations of Mirage can generate illusions. The Mike incarnation&#x27;s abilities are derived from a special gem, while the Miriam Delgado incarnation is a metahuman who possesses innate abilities.

==Other versions==
An alternate universe variant of Miriam Delgado / Mirage appears in &quot;Team Titans&quot; Annual #2.

==In other media==
* An original incarnation of Mirage named Miranda appears in the &quot;Static Shock&quot; episode &quot;Brother-Sister Act&quot;, voiced by Gavin Turek. This version is a Bang Baby who, alongside her brother Byron, is exposed to mutagen amidst a clean-up effort following the Big Bang, with Miranda acquiring photokinesis that allows her to create illusions while Byron acquires a loudspeaker in his chest capable of firing powerful sound waves. Taking the name &quot;Boom&quot;, Byron forces Miranda into helping him steal valuables. Realizing that the mutagen has affected Bryon&#x27;s mind, Miranda helps Static defeat him. Afterwards, she is taken by child protective services and creates an illusion to protect Static&#x27;s secret identity from his sister Sharon.
* The Miriam Delgado incarnation of Mirage appears as a character summon in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.
* An unidentified, alternate universe variant of Mirage inspired by Raven appears in &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; #48 as a member of her version of the Teen Titans.

<doc id="724530" wikidata="Q983574" url="?curid=724530" title="Radhanath Sikdar">
<text>Radhanath Sikdar (; 5 October 1813 – 17 May 1870) was an Indian mathematician who is best known for calculating the height of Mount Everest. He was the first person to calculate the height of Mount Everest, in 1852.

==Great Trigonometric Survey==
In 1831, George Everest, the Surveyor General of India, was in the pursuit of a mathematician who had specialised in spherical trigonometry, so that they could be a part of the Great Trigonometric Survey. In 1832, under the leadership of Everest, the longitudinal series of the &quot;triangle&quot; survey was completed from Sironj in Central India to Calcutta in Bengal.

While still working on mapping Calcutta, Bengal, Everest had begun his search for a mathematician, and soon enough, John Tytler, a professor of Mathematics at the Hindu College, now known as the Presidency College, recommended his 18-year-old pupil, Radhanath Sikdar.

Radhanath, a student of the college since 1824, was one of the first two Indians to read Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; and by 1832; he had studied Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, Thomas Jephson&#x27;s &quot;Fluxion&quot; and Analytical Geometry and Astronomy by Windhouse. Taking inspiration from these prestigious papers, he devised a new method to draw a common tangent to two circles, when he was just a teenager. There was little doubt about Radhanath&#x27;s proficiency in his subject, and he secured the job at the GTS on 19 December 1831 as a &quot;computer&quot; at a salary of thirty rupees per month.

Soon he was sent to Sironj near Dehradun. Even as seven other Bengali ‘computers’ worked alongside him, Radhanath soon showed his superior skills in mathematics and became Everest’s favourite colleague. So much so, that he once stopped his transfer to another department. Radhanath’s job was to carry geodetic surveys—the study of the earth’s geometric shape orientation in space and gravitational field. He did not just use the established methods but invented his own to accurately measure these factors.

George Everest retired in 1843 and was succeeded by Colonel Andrew Scott Waugh. Eight years later, in 1851, Radhanath was promoted to the position of Chief Computer and transferred to Calcutta. Here, he was also a superintendent for the Meteorological Department.

At the order of Colonel Waugh, Radhanath started measuring the height of mountains. The brilliant mathematician, who had perhaps never seen Mount Everest, discovered in 1852 that Kangchenjunga, which was considered to be the tallest in the world, wasn’t really so. Compiling data about Mount Everest from six observations, he eventually came to the conclusion that it was the tallest in the world.

It was during the computations of the northeastern observations that Radhanath had calculated the height of Peak XV at exactly 29,000 ft (8839 m), but Waugh added an arbitrary two feet because he was afraid that the Sikdar’s figure would be considered a rounded number rather than an accurate one. He officially announced this finding in March 1856, and this remained the height of Mount Everest till an Indian survey re-calculated it to be 29,029 ft or 8848 m in 1955.

Technological advancements, data from the thousands of climbers, and the discovery of different routes to the summit all have led to a more accurate calculation of the height of Mount Everest—a peak that grows at the rate of 4 mm every year and whose summit is slowly moving northeastwards each passing year.

==Others==
It appears that while Everest and Waugh both extolled him for his exceptional mathematical abilities, his relations with the colonial administration were far from cordial. Two specific instances are on record.

In 1851 a Survey Manual (eds. Capt. H. L. Thullier and Capt. F. Smyth) was published by the Survey Department. The preface to the Manual mentions that the more technical and mathematical chapters of the Manual were written by Babu Radhanath Sikdar. The Manual proved to be immensely useful to surveyors. However, the third edition, published in 1875 (i.e., after Sikdar&#x27;s death) did not contain that preface, so that Sikdar&#x27;s memorable contribution was de-recognized. The incident was condemned by a section of British surveyors. The paper &quot;Friend of India&quot; in 1876 called it &#x27;robbery of the dead&#x27;.

It is also on record that Sikdar was fined a sum of 200 rupees in 1843 for having vehemently protested against the unlawful exploitation of survey department workers by the Magistrate Vansittart. The incident was reported in detail in &quot;The Bengal Spectator&quot; edited by Ramgopal Ghosh.

In 1854, Sikdar along with his Derozian friend Peary Chand Mitra started the Bengali journal &quot;Masik Patrika&quot;, for education and empowerment of women. He used to write in a simple and uncluttered style that was rather atypical for the age.

Sikdar had retired from service in 1862, and was later appointed as teacher of mathematics at the General Assembly&#x27;s Institution (now Scottish Church College).

==Death==
He died on 17 May 1870 at Chandernagore and was interred at the Sacred Heart Cemetery.

==Recognition==
In recognition of Sikdar&#x27;s mathematical genius, German Philosophical Society&#x27;s Bavaria branch of Natural Science made Radhanath Sikdar a Corresponding Member in 1864, two years after his retirement.

The Department of Posts, Government of India, launched a postal stamp on 27 June 2004, commemorating the establishment of the Great Trigonometric Survey in Chennai, India on 10 April 1802. The stamps feature Radhanath Sikdar and Nain Singh, two significant contributors to society.

<text>À nous la liberté (), sometimes written as À nous la liberté!, (English: Freedom Forever or Freedom for Us) is a 1931 French musical film directed by René Clair. With a score by Georges Auric, it has more music than any of Clair&#x27;s other early works. Praised for its use of sound and Academy Award-nominated scenic design, the film has been called Clair&#x27;s &quot;crowning achievement&quot;.

==Plot summary==

Inmates at a French prison make toy wooden horses at a long table. Émile, one of the prisoners, distracts a guard so his friend, Louis, can steal a hook-shaped tool. That night, the pair escape from their cell. Louis scales the inner wall of the facility using a rope tied to the hook, but Émile is spotted when he tries to follow. Émile throws the rope to Louis and tells him to run for it. Several guards chase Émile, while Louis climbs the outer wall. Panicked, Louis runs into a road and is hit by a bicyclist. He rides off on the man&#x27;s bicycle and ends up winning a race. Later, he covers up his theft of a small shop by acting as though he was attacked by a thief while the proprietor was out of the room.

Starting as a poor record merchant, Louis is able to work his way up until he is the well-attired and well-mannered head of a business that makes phonographs. The factory is run with great efficiency and the workers, overseen by a strict foreman, toil on an assembly line in an environment reminiscent of the prison from which Louis escaped.

In a field behind the factory, Émile (apparently having been released from prison) wakes from a nap in the grass. The Sun is shining and some flowers sing him a song, but then two policemen come by and arrest him for vagrancy. From his jail cell, he hears music and sees, in an apartment across the street, a woman who appears to be singing while she hangs flowers around a window. Not wanting to be incarcerated any more, Émile tries to hang himself from the prison window, but the bars comes loose, so he escapes instead.

Finding himself below the flower-covered window, Émile pauses to listen to the song, which winds down and stops, revealing to him that it was being played on a phonograph. He turns and sees the woman, Jeanne, standing next to him on the street and goes to say hello, but her uncle kicks Émile and pulls her away. A shopkeeper laughs at Émile and the two argue, which distracts Jeanne&#x27;s uncle just long enough for Jeanne to make a date with her boyfriend, Paul, before her uncle leads her off to work. Émile finds safety from the shopkeeper in a line that turns out to be for new recruits at Louis&#x27; factory. He is about to leave when he discovers Jeanne works there as a secretary, so he sticks around.

On the assembly line, Émile soon falls behind and causes a disruption. Jeanne comes to the factory floor to escape the unwanted advances of the foreman and Émile goes to talk to her. She drops her handkerchief and leaves before he can give it back to her, as the foreman has entered to try to restore order. The assembly line is restarted and Émile is removed from his position. Jeanne&#x27;s handkerchief gets thrown out a window, so Émile goes after it and winds up being chased by the foreman and a growing number of factory guards, but the chase stops abruptly when everyone stands at attention while Louis passes by. Louis acts as though he does not recognize Émile, though he still agrees to speak privately.

In Louis&#x27; office, Louis pulls a gun on Émile and then offers him money to disappear without revealing how they know each other. Émile refuses to extort his friend and sees Jeanne out the window. He wants to go return her handkerchief, but Louis stops him, cutting Émile&#x27;s wrist in the process. As Louis tends to the wound with his handkerchief, he recalls that he had done similarly during their jailbreak and their friendship is rekindled.

Émile&#x27;s reappearance helps to get Louis to relax. After a fancy dinner party is broken up, not so much by the waiter spilling dessert on the guests as by Émile and Louis laughing at the situation, the friends throw things at a huge portrait of Louis and get drunk. In the morning, first Émile, and then Louis, are spotted by a man who was in prison with them.

When Émile interrupts a meeting, Louis is annoyed and says he cannot have Émile around the factory, but he softens when Émile says he wants to stay because he is in love. Louis looks up Jeanne&#x27;s personnel file and discovers her uncle is an accountant at the factory, so he tells the man that his friend wants to marry Jeanne. Thrilled at the prospect of his niece marrying someone so close to wealth, the uncle arranges for Émile and Jeanne to have a date, but Jeanne is unhappy to be engaged to a man with whom she has exchanged only a few words.

At his mansion, Louis is welcomed by a group of men, one of whom is the former inmate who had seen him that morning, who threaten to expose Louis&#x27; criminal past unless he agrees to share his status and fortune with them. Meanwhile, Émile and Jeanne, chaperoned by her uncle, sit in awkward silence at a dance hall. Paul watches disapprovingly before he leaves with his date. Jeanne follows them and ends up alone with Émile, who tries to kiss her. She gently extricates herself from his embrace and finds Paul, whose date has abandoned him due to his lack of interest in her. Émile wanders around and, finding Jeanne with Paul, realizes she already has a boyfriend.

After the date, Émile longingly looks up at Jeanne&#x27;s apartment window while she happily waves to Paul. He realizes he is right outside the jail from which he escaped just as some policemen ask him what he is doing, so he runs away. They chase him to the factory, where he finds Louis, who has locked the group of blackmailers in a vault and is cleaning out his safe before running away. Louis tells the policemen and security guards he has not seen anyone, but, unfortunately, Émile accidentally frees the blackmailers while he is looking for a hiding place. A chase ensues, during which the former inmate manages to get the case Louis loaded with money. Émile escapes, but all of the blackmailers are apprehended. Unbeknownst to anyone but the former inmate, the case full of money was left on the roof when he got caught. Although the police officers do not listen to the blackmailers when they say Louis is an escaped criminal, Louis knows it is only a matter of time before they do.

The next day, Louis speaks at the opening ceremony of a new factory that will be completely automated. He notices a policeman in the audience and announces he has finished his work at the phonograph company and gives his factories to the employees. The wind picks up and blows the money off the roof, and the crowd runs after it. Louis uses the distraction to sneak away from the police.

With the factory running itself, the workers, Jeanne and Paul among them, spend their days in leisure. Émile and Louis, however, are now singing for spare change and traveling on foot. When a fancy car drives by, reminding Louis of how he used to live, Émile kicks him in the butt and, happily, they head down the road together.

==Production==
Along with his two first sound films, &quot;Sous les toits de Paris&quot; (1930) and &quot;Le Million&quot; (1931), &quot;À nous la liberté&quot; shows Clair continuing to experiment with the possibilities of sound film. At one point, the image of a flower, in combination with an unseen voice, leads the viewer to think the flower is singing. Once this is accepted, the viewer is able to accept that a chorus of flowers is singing when Émile views a window from his jail cell. As he does with narrative, Clair reveals the truth slowly and in a circuitous way, so as to produce comedy and satire; in this case, by first suggesting the flowers are singing, and then that Jeanne is singing, when in fact it is a phonograph—revealed only because it runs down.

An aural flashback occurs when Émile re-encounters Louis, and a small argument results in Émile getting cut. As Louis bandages the cut, the soundtrack plays the non-musical marching of the prisoners (who wore wooden clogs).

Many sound effects are achieved, not through natural sound, but through Auric&#x27;s musical score. In the phonograph factory, the &quot;sound&quot; of assembly line mechanization was depicted musically (using xylophones, among other instruments). There are several other passages, such as when Louis keys in the numbers to retrieve the profiles of Jeanne and her uncle, where the music supplies the only accompanying sound.

==Themes==
The film comments on society by depicting industrial working conditions as not much different from being in prison. DVD Verdict&#x27;s Barrie Maxwell adds that the film depicts &quot;a France oblivious to all going on around it, as portrayed by the sequence in which an aging French politician drones on to his audience about justice and liberty and patriotism, while the audience has long since lost interest, preferring instead to concentrate on chasing money that has accidentally fallen out of a bag and is now blowing in the wind.&quot;

Critic Michael Atkinson views the film as &quot;expressly dismissive of both Stalinism and industrial dehumanization (Liberté&#x27;s world is a seamless commingling of both)&quot; and argues that &quot;Clair&#x27;s film holds only the anarchistic principle of liberty sacred.&quot;

==Release and reception==
===Initial reviews===
&quot;À nous la liberté&quot; was both critically and commercially successful. Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; argued that its humor &quot;is provocative of thought&quot;, and praised &quot;the cleverly designed settings for the scenes in both the prison and the factory. This angle of the production is extraordinarily thorough, every detail having received most careful attention.&quot;

===Chaplin controversy===
The film became embroiled in controversy following the release of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;Modern Times&quot; (1936), which bore some similarities to this film, such as the conveyor belt gags. In the end, instead of going to court, the two parties reached a settlement, but the whole episode lasted around a decade. Chaplin maintained that he had never seen &quot;À nous la liberté&quot;, as did everyone else at his studio.

René Clair himself was never a part of the case, and was actually quite embarrassed by it, since he had great admiration for Chaplin, to whom he stated all filmmakers were in debt. He said on multiple occasions that he would be honored if one of his films had inspired Chaplin.

===1950 version===
In 1950, Clair re-released the film, deleting two scenes:
#The scene in which the flowers sing to Émile after he wakes up in a field.
#The sequence depicting Émile&#x27;s date with Jeanne. (In some countries, this sequence had already been deleted from the film at the time of its initial release.)

===Modern reception===
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 100% approval of &quot;À nous la liberté&quot; based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that the film&#x27;s &quot;proletarian plot (two convicts go free, one becoming a tramp, the other acquiring a phonograph factory) makes it a period piece in the best sense.&quot; Michael Atkinson considers it to be Clair&#x27;s &quot;loveliest and most lyrical film&quot;, and wrote that the work is &quot;filthy with formal élan, wild sound [...] and choreographed movement, and if anything [it has] gained an antique daydreaminess with the years.&quot; In &quot;The Routledge Encyclopedia of Films&quot;, &quot;À nous la liberté&quot; is described as a landmark in film comedy for &quot;its deft use of sound and its pioneering production design&quot;, and as a work which anticipated the films of Jacques Tati in its satire of modernization.

<doc id="724558" wikidata="Q3544336" url="?curid=724558" title="USS Finback (SS-230)">
<text>USS &quot;Finback&quot; (SS-230), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the finback. Nine of &quot;Finback&#x27;s&quot; twelve World War II patrols in the Pacific were designated as &quot;successful&quot;; she received 13 battle stars for her service and is credited with having sunk nearly 70 thousand tons of enemy shipping.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Finback&quot; was laid down on 5 February 1941 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 25 August 1941 and sponsored by Mrs. Genevieve G. Watson, wife of Rear Admiral Adolphus E Watson, Commandant of the 4th Naval District and the Philadelphia Navy Yard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was commissioned on 31 January 1942.

==1942==

===First and second patrols===
&quot;Finback&quot; reached Pearl Harbor from New London on 29 May 1942, and two days later, with the Japanese fleet on the move, was ordered out to patrol during the Battle of Midway. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 9 June to prepare for her first full war patrol. She cleared harbor, bound for the Aleutian Islands, on 25 June. &quot;Finback&quot; first contacted the enemy on 5 July, when she attacked two destroyers, and received a heavy return depth charge attack. Crewmate (Electrician&#x27;s Mate, 2nd class) Robert D. White recalls the event, &quot;They [a Japanese ship] fired depth charges at us for nearly twenty-four hours. We only had about that much air left, we just kept going deeper, trying to outlast them. Just as &#x27;Skip&#x27; started talking about surrendering for lack of oxygen, the charges stopped...Fresh air never felt so good as when we made it to the surface and opened the hatch.&quot; Two special missions highlighted this first war patrol: a reconnaissance of Vega Bay, Kiska, on 11 July, and a surveying operation at Tanaga Bay, Tanaga, on 11 August. The submarine ended her patrol at Dutch Harbor on 12 August, and returned to Pearl Harbor 23 August to refit.

Departing Pearl Harbor on 23 September 1942, &quot;Finback&quot; made her second war patrol off Taiwan. On 14 October, she sighted a convoy of four merchantmen, guarded by a patrol vessel. The submarine launched two torpedoes at each of the two largest targets, sinking one, the ex-French merchantman &quot;Ville De Verdun&quot;, rechristened the &quot;Teison Maru&quot; (7007 tons), returning empty to Japan, and went deep for the inevitable depth charging. When she surfaced, she found two destroyers in the area, preventing further attacks.

With her tubes reloaded, &quot;Finback&quot; headed for the China coast. Four days later, on 18 October, she inflicted heavy damage on a large freighter, and on 20 October, made contact with three ships, en route to Yokohama, Japan from Saigon. She sank two: the passenger-cargo ship &quot;Africa Maru&quot; (9476 tons), carrying a cargo of rice and corn, 112 crewmen and 38 passengers including survivors of cargo ship &quot;Teibo Maru&quot; (4,472 tons) which had been torpedoed and sunk on 25 September 1942 by , and the cargo ship &quot;Yamafuji Maru&quot; (5359 tons). The submarine completed her first patrol with a surface gunfire engagement on 3 November, sinking an ocean-going sampan. &quot;Finback&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 20 November.

==1943==

===Third and fourth patrols===
During her third war patrol, between 16 December 1942 and 6 February 1943, &quot;Finback&quot; served for some time as escort for a carrier task force, forbidden to reveal herself by making attacks during that part of the patrol. Later, she engaged the Japanese coaster &quot;Yachiyo Maru&quot; (271 tons) in a surface gun duel on 17 January, leaving the enemy craft abandoned and sinking.

After refitting at Midway, &quot;Finback&quot; made her fourth war patrol between 27 February and 13 April, scouting shipping lanes between Rabaul and the Japanese home islands. On 21 March, she damaged the troop transport &quot;Sanuki Maru&quot; (7158 tons), during an attack in which one of the two torpedoes that hit the ship failed to explode, and from 24 to 26 March made a difficult chase of a convoy. When in position to attack, she fired three torpedoes at each of two ships and was immediately fired upon, then forced deep by an efficient depth-charge attack. Almost out of fuel, &quot;Finback&quot; was forced to break off the contact, and set course for Wake Island and Midway.

On 5 April, passing a reef south of Japanese-held Wake, &quot;Finback&quot; sighted the troop transport &quot;Suwa Maru&quot;, beached and well down by the stern. After manoeuvring, &quot;Finback&quot; was able to elude a patrol boat and a searching airplane before torpedoing and sinking the 10,672-ton ship previously damaged by two of &quot;Finback&quot;&#x27;s sister submarines.

===Fifth and sixth patrols===
&quot;Finback&quot; refitted at Pearl Harbor from 13 April to 12 May 1943 for her fifth war patrol. Through most of this patrol, she patrolled off Taiwan, and along the shipping lanes from the Japanese home islands to the Marshalls. On 27 May, she sank IJA cargo ship &quot;Kochi Maru&quot; (2910 tons), and on 8 June, the auxiliary minelayer &quot;Kahoku Maru&quot; (3277 tons). &quot;Finback&quot; sank another merchant vessel four days later.

After refitting at Fremantle, Western Australia 26 June – 18 July, the submarine sailed for her sixth war patrol along the Java coast. Her first contact was made 30 July, and she sank the IJA cargo ship &quot;Ryuzan Maru&quot; (4719 GRT) and another cargo ship on 3 August. On 11 August, &quot;Finback&quot; damaged the auxiliary minelayer &quot;Tatsumiya Maru&quot; (6343 tons). She encountered two small minelayers, a tug, and an inter-island steamer on 19 August, and engaged all but the tug with surface gunfire, damaging the auxiliary submarine chaser and sinking the former Dutch patrol vessel &quot;Kawi&quot;, renamed &quot;Cha 109&quot; (75 tons). Her limited supply of ammunition forced her to break off the action.

==1944==

===Seventh and eighth patrols===
After a major overhaul at Pearl Harbor between 12 September and 15 December 1943, &quot;Finback&quot; sailed for the South China Sea on her seventh war patrol, characterized by heavy weather, few contacts, and continuous sightings of patrol planes. She sank the tanker &quot;Isshin Maru&quot; (10044 tons) in a surface attack on New Year&#x27;s Day 1944, after it was unable to keep up with its convoy due to a rudder malfunction. On 30 January, she sank a fishing trawler by surface gunfire and damaged another in a similar action the following day.

The submarine refitted at Pearl Harbor once more between 11 February and 6 March 1944, then sailed for her eighth war patrol, off Truk in the Caroline Islands. Prevented from launching attacks through most of the eighth patrol because of her assignment as lifeguard for carrier air strikes on targets in the Carolines, &quot;Finback&quot; contacted a six-ship convoy on 12 April, noting three escorts. She attacked four of the ships before a counter-attack sent her deep. On 16 April, while making a reconnaissance of Oroluk Atoll, she fired on a partially submerged steamer and a lookout tower on the atoll. Three days later, she sank one of a group of sampans, then sailed for refit at Pearl Harbor from 1 May to 30 May.

===Ninth, tenth and eleventh patrols===
During her ninth war patrol, off the Palaus and west of the Marianas, &quot;Finback&quot; again served lifeguard duty as her primary mission during plane strikes covering the opening of the Marianas operation.

She returned to Majuro on 21 July for refit, then sailed on 16 August on her tenth war patrol under the command of Lieutenant Commander Robert Russell Williams, Jr., and was assigned to lifeguard duty in the Bonins. Guided by friendly aircraft, she rescued a total of five naval aviators, one very close inshore off Chichi Jima. Watchman Torpedoman First Class Donnet Kohler pulled out a tall lanky young pilot who would later become the 41st President of the United States, George H. W. Bush. Pilot Beckman was rescued by holding on to the &quot;Finback&quot;&#x27;s periscope until the partially submerged vessel was five miles from Haha Jima and out of shelling range of Japanese cannons.

On 10 – 11 September, she tracked a convoy, and although twice her attacks were broken off by an alert escort, she sank &quot;Hassho Maru&quot; (536 tons) and &quot;Hakuun Maru No.2&quot; (866 tons).

&quot;Finback&quot; put into Pearl Harbor for refit. On her eleventh war patrol, she was again detailed to lifeguard duty in the Bonins. She sank troop transport &quot;Jusan Maru&quot; (2111 tons) on 16 December and returned to Midway on 24 December.

==1945==

===Twelfth patrol===
The submarine&#x27;s twelfth war patrol, made between 20 January and 25 March 1945 in the East China Sea, was frustrated by a lack of targets, and &quot;Finback&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor for a thorough overhaul. Still at Pearl Harbor at the close of the war, she sailed for New London 29 August 1945.

==Post war==
Homeported at New London for the remaining five years of her active career, &quot;Finback&quot; was engaged in training student submariners. Twice, in 1947 and in 1948, she sailed to the Caribbean to take part in Second Fleet exercises. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at New London on 21 April 1950.

&quot;Finback&quot; was stricken on 1 September 1958, and sold for scrap on 15 July 1959.

All but the third, ninth, and twelfth of &quot;Finback&#x27;s&quot; twelve war patrols were designated &quot;successful.&quot; She received 13 battle stars for World War II service, and is credited with having sunk 69,383 tons of enemy shipping.

<doc id="724562" wikidata="Q380355" url="?curid=724562" title="David Wilkerson">
<text>David Ray Wilkerson (May 19, 1931 – April 27, 2011) was an American Christian evangelist, best known for his book &quot;The Cross and the Switchblade&quot;. He was the founder of the addiction recovery program Teen Challenge, and founding pastor of the interdenominational Times Square Church in New York City.

Wilkerson emphasized such Christian beliefs as God&#x27;s holiness and righteousness, God&#x27;s love toward humans and especially Christian views of Jesus. Wilkerson tried to avoid categorizing Christians into distinct groups according to the denomination to which they belong.

==Early years==
David Wilkerson was born in 1931 in Indiana. He was the second son of a family of Pentecostal Christian preachers, and he was raised in Barnesboro, Pennsylvania, in a house &quot;full of Bibles&quot;. His paternal grandfather and his father, Kenneth, were ministers. According to Wilkerson&#x27;s own testimony, he was baptized with the Holy Spirit at the age of eight.

The young Wilkerson began to preach when he was about fourteen. After high school, he entered the Central Bible College in Springfield, Missouri. The school was affiliated with the Assemblies of God. In 1952, he was ordained as a minister.

==Ministry==
Wilkerson married Gwendolyn Rose &quot;Gwen&quot; Carosso in 1953. He served as a pastor in small churches in Scottdale and Philipsburg in Pennsylvania, until he saw a photograph in &quot;Life Magazine&quot; in early 1958 of seven teenagers who were members of gangs in New York known as &quot;Egyptian Kings&quot; and the &quot;Dragons&quot; which had merged into a single gang called the &quot;Egyptian Dragons&quot;. He felt a calling from God to minister to those gangs. He later wrote that he felt the Holy Spirit move him with compassion and was drawn to go to New York, in order to preach to them. On his arrival, Wilkerson went to the court in which teenagers were being prosecuted. He entered the room and asked the judge for permission to tell them something, but the judge ejected him. Upon leaving, someone took a photo of Wilkerson, who then became known as the Bible preacher &quot;who had interrupted the gang trial&quot;. Soon after this, he began a street ministry to young drug addicts and gang members, which he continued into the 1960s. He founded Teen Challenge in 1958, an evangelical Christian addiction recovery program in Brooklyn with a network of Christian social and evangelizing work centers.

Wilkerson gained national recognition after he co-authored the book &quot;The Cross and the Switchblade&quot; in 1962 with John and Elizabeth Sherrill about his street ministry. The book became a best-seller, with over 50 million copies in over thirty languages, and is included in &quot;Christianity Today&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 50 Books That Have Shaped Evangelicals&quot;. In the book, Wilkerson tells of the conversion of gang member Nicky Cruz, who later became an evangelist himself and wrote the autobiographical &quot;Run Baby Run&quot;. Nicky had been the leader of the &quot;Mau Maus&quot; gang, and he and his friend Israel Narvaez became Christians after hearing Wilkerson preach. The 1970 film &quot;The Cross and the Switchblade&quot;, starring Pat Boone as Wilkerson and Erik Estrada as Cruz, was adapted from the book of the same name.

In 1967, Wilkerson began Youth Crusades, an evangelistic ministry aimed at teenagers whom Wilkerson called &quot;goodniks&quot;—middle-class youth who were restless and bored. His goal was to prevent them from becoming heavily involved with drugs, alcohol, or violence. Through this ministry, the CURE Corps (Collegiate Urban Renewal Effort) was founded. In 1971, Wilkerson moved his ministry headquarters to Lindale, Texas. On September 22 he founded World Challenge, an organization seeking to promote and spread the Gospel throughout the world.

Wilkerson recalled: &quot; In 1986, while walking down 42nd Street at midnight, my heart broke over what I saw. At that time, Times Square was populated mainly by prostitutes and pimps, runaways, drug addicts and hustlers, along with live peep shows and X-rated movie houses. I cried out for God to do something—anything—to help the physically destitute and spiritually dead people I saw.&quot; Recalling that life-changing night, Pastor David said, “I saw 9-, 10- and 11-year-old kids bombed on crack cocaine. I walked down 42nd Street and they were selling crack. Len Bias, the famous basketball player, had just died of a crack overdose, and the pusher was yelling, ‘Hey, I’ve got the stuff that killed Len.’ I wept and prayed, ‘God, you’ve got to raise up a testimony in this hellish place. The answer was not what I wanted to hear: ‘Well, you know the city. You’ve been here. You do it.’ ” The Holy Spirit called him to return to New York City and to raise up a ministry in Times Square. He founded and became the pastor of Times Square Church, which opened its doors in October 1987. The church first occupied rented auditoriums in Times Square (Town Hall and the Nederlander Theater), before moving to the historic Mark Hellinger Theatre in 1989, in which it has operated ever since.

Wilkerson did not preach in the name of any specific denomination. Instead, he focused on biblical preaching with the aim of encouraging people to seek God through a personal and deeper knowledge of Jesus Christ and the experience of the Holy Spirit. He said:

Throughout his ministry, Wilkerson had contact with many other prominent Christian ministers, including Leonard Ravenhill, who was his friend, and Ray Comfort, whom Wilkerson met in 1992 after listening to a message called &quot;Hell&#x27;s Best Kept Secret&quot;.

From the 1990s, Wilkerson focused his efforts on encouraging pastors and their families throughout the world to &quot;renew their passion for Christ&quot;.

Wilkerson and his wife Gwen moved to New York City at the inception of Times Square Church in 1987, and in 2006 began splitting their time between New York and Texas. They had four children and eleven grandchildren.

==Death==
On the afternoon of April 27, 2011, Wilkerson died when he collided head-on with an 18-wheeler in East Texas. He was pronounced dead at the scene, less than a month from his 80th birthday. His wife Gwendolyn was seriously injured. Gwendolyn Wilkerson died a year later, on July 5, 2012, from cancer, at the age of 81.

<text>Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is a medical test that measures the amount of urea nitrogen found in blood. The liver produces urea in the urea cycle as a waste product of the digestion of protein. Normal human adult blood should contain 7 to 18 mg/dL (0.388 to 1 mmol/L) of urea nitrogen. Individual laboratories may have different reference ranges, as they may use different assays. The test is used to detect kidney problems. It is not considered as reliable as creatinine or BUN-to-creatinine ratio blood studies.

==Interpretation==
BUN is an indication of kidney health. The normal range is 2.1–7.1 mmol/L or 6–20 mg/dL.

The main causes of an increase in BUN are: high-protein diet, decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (suggestive of kidney failure), decrease in blood volume (hypovolemia), congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, fever, rapid cell destruction from infections, athletic activity, excessive muscle breakdown, and increased catabolism.

Hypothyroidism can cause both decreased GFR and hypovolemia, but BUN-to-creatinine ratio has been found to be lowered in hypothyroidism and raised in hyperthyroidism.

The main causes of a decrease in BUN are malnutrition (low-protein diet), severe liver disease, anabolic state, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.
Another rare cause of a decreased BUN is ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, which is a genetic disorder inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. OTC deficiency is also accompanied by hyperammonemia and high orotic acid levels.

==Units==
BUN is usually reported in mg/dL in some countries (e.g. United States, Mexico, Italy, Austria, and Germany). Elsewhere, the concentration of urea is reported in SI units as mmol/L.

formula_1 represents the mass of nitrogen within urea/volume, not the mass of whole urea. Each molecule of urea has two nitrogen atoms, each having molar mass 14 g/mol. To convert from mg/dL of blood urea nitrogen to mmol/L of urea:

formula_2

Note that molar concentrations of urea and urea nitrogen are equal, because both nitrogen gas and urea has two nitrogen atoms.

Convert BUN to urea in mg/dL by using following formula:

formula_3

Where 60 represents MW of urea and 14*2 MW of urea nitrogen.

<doc id="724582" wikidata="Q2283759" url="?curid=724582" title="German State Party">
<text>The German State Party ( or DStP) was a short-lived German political party of the Weimar Republic. The party was formed on 28 July 1930 by the merger of the German Democratic Party with the People&#x27;s National Reich Association (the political wing of the Young German Order).

==Background==
The merger of the social liberalism of the DDP with the nationalist corporatism of the Young German Order did not prove a successful one: the party lost seats drastically in the 1930 election from its showing in 1928, and the People&#x27;s National Reich Association&#x27;s Reichstag delegates soon seceded from the party, leaving it essentially the DDP under a new name.

==History==
The party continued to compete in parliamentary elections, with little success. By the November 1932 election, the party was reduced to two seats. After all requests to merge with other parties were turned down, it ran on a joint list with the Social Democratic Party of Germany in the March 1933 election. However, this saw little change in the party&#x27;s fortunes; it only won five seats.

The party supported the Enabling Act of 1933 which gave Adolf Hitler of the Nazi Party dictatorial powers. Following the passage of the Enabling Act, the party was the target of severe harassment, as was the case with the other remaining parties. Pro-DStP civil servants defected to the Nazis out of fear for their jobs. Soon after the government banned the SPD, it stripped the State Party of its Reichstag seats, taking the line that since they ran on the SPD list, they were effectively SPD deputies. What remained of the party dissolved on 28 June.

<doc id="724583" wikidata="Q3571873" url="?curid=724583" title="Oklahoma City Yard Dawgz">
<text>The Oklahoma City Yard Dawgz were an arena football team. The team began play as a 2004 expansion team of the Arena Football League&#x27;s minor league af2 before becoming a member of the AFL in 2010. Formerly a tenant of the Ford Center from 2004 until 2008, the Yard Dawgz were forced out when the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Oklahoma City Thunder moved into town; starting in 2009, the Yard Dawgz played across the street at the Cox Convention Center. On October 25, 2010 Yard Dawgz owner Phil Miller announced that he decided not to play in the Arena Football League for the 2011 season.

==Team history==

===Three straight winning seasons===

The Yard Dawgz had a successful first year on and off the field by leading the league in attendance and finishing the regular season with 10–6 record to finish second in the Southwest Division of the National Conference.

In 2005, The Yard Dawgz had another successful year, despite changing divisions, by coming in third in attendance and finishing the regular season with 10–6 record to finish second in the Midwest Division of the National Conference. The Dawgz lost in the first round to the Amarillo Dusters.

The Yard Dawgz had their best showing in 2006 with a record of 11–5 and their third playoff appearance. Kicker A.J. Haglund won the af2 Kicker of the Year award and Quarterback Craig Strickland became the only player in af2 history to reach 20,000 career passing yards.

===First losing season===
In 2007, under head coach John Fitzgerald, the Yard Dawgz had the second leading offense in the league – averaging 310.9 yd/game. Despite finishing 7-9, the team made its fourth consecutive playoff appearance. Three members of the 2007 Yard Dawgz earned All-af2 First Team honors – WR/DB Al Hunt, Center Gene Frederic, and OL/DL Barry Giles.

===2008 season===
The Yard Dawgs brought back Gary Reasons to coach in 2008, but after the team got off to a 1–5 start, Reasons stepped down as head coach. Sparky McEwen took over as interim head coach. On June 28, 2008, against the Lubbock Renegades, Wide Receiver Al Hunt became only the third player in af2 history to record 1,000 points.

===2009 season===
After starting the season with a 4–0 record, a team–record four straight opening wins, the Yard Dawgz then dropped five games in a row, the longest losing streak in team history, to drop to 4–5. The Dawgz bounced back to win three in a row to push their record to 7–5, and kept their playoff hopes alive.

On June 20, the Yard Dawgz faced off against the Corpus Christi Sharks. The Yard Dawgz beat the Sharks 93–41 and set an af2 record for points scored in a first half (59) and beat their own franchise record for points scored in a game, which had previously been set against the Tulsa Talons.

Despite a loss against the Spokane Shock on June 26, the Yard Dawgz clinched a playoff berth when Boise beat Central Valley on the next night. The playoff appearance marked the fifth time in six years that the Dawgz were in post-season play.

The Yard Dawgz season ended on August 1 at the hands of the Tulsa Turkeys in the first round of ArenaCup playoffs. With the loss, the Dawgz had dropped five straight postseason games and were winless in the team&#x27;s history in the playoffs.

===2011 season===

On October 25, 2010, Yard Dawgz owner Phil Miller announced that he decided not to play in the Arena Football League for the 2011 season. However, the Indoor Football League announced the same day that a new team would play in Oklahoma City in 2011.

<doc id="724586" wikidata="Q55388" url="?curid=724586" title="René Clair">
<text>René Clair (; 11 November 1898 – 15 March 1981), born René-Lucien Chomette (), was a French filmmaker and writer. He first established his reputation in the 1920s as a director of silent films in which comedy was often mingled with fantasy. He went on to make some of the most innovative early sound films in France, before going abroad to work in the UK and USA for more than a decade. Returning to France after World War II, he continued to make films that were characterised by their elegance and wit, often presenting a nostalgic view of French life in earlier years. He was elected to the Académie Française in 1960. Clair&#x27;s best known films include &quot;Un chapeau de paille d&#x27;Italie&quot; (&quot;The Italian Straw Hat&quot;, 1928), &quot;Sous les toits de Paris&quot; (&quot;Under the Roofs of Paris&quot;, 1930), &quot;Le Million&quot; (1931), &quot;À nous la liberté&quot; (1931), &quot;I Married a Witch&quot; (1942), and &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (1945).

==Early life==
René Clair was born and grew up in Paris in the district of Les Halles, whose lively and picturesque character made a lasting impression on him. His father was a soap merchant; he had an elder brother, Henri Chomette (born 1896). He attended the Lycée Montaigne and the Lycée Louis-le-Grand. In 1914 he was studying philosophy; his friends at that time included Raymond Payelle who became the actor and writer Philippe Hériat.
In 1917, at the age of 18, he served as an ambulance driver in World War I, before being invalided out with a spinal injury. He was deeply affected by the horrors of war that he witnessed and gave expression to this in writing a volume of poetry called &quot;La Tête de l&#x27;homme&quot; (which remained unpublished). Back in Paris after the war, he started a career as a journalist at the left-wing newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Intransigeant&quot;.

==Film career==
Having met the music-hall singer Damia and written some songs for her, Clair was persuaded by her to visit Gaumont studios in 1920 where a film was being cast and he then agreed to take on a leading role in &quot;Le Lys de la vie,&quot; directed by Loïe Fuller and Gabrielle Sorère. He adopted the stage-name of René Clair, and several other acting jobs followed, including &quot;Parisette&quot; for Louis Feuillade. In 1922 he extended his career as a journalist, becoming the editor of a new film supplement to a monthly magazine, &quot;Théâtre et Comœdia illustrés&quot;. He also visited Belgium and after an introduction from his brother Henri, he became an assistant to the director Jacques de Baroncelli on several films.

===1924–1934===
In 1924, with the support of the producer Henri Diamant-Berger, Clair got the opportunity to direct his own first film, &quot;Paris qui dort&quot; (&quot;The Crazy Ray&quot;), a short comic fantasy. Before it had been shown however, Clair was asked by Francis Picabia and Erik Satie to make a short film to be shown as part of their Dadaist ballet &quot;Relâche&quot;; he made &quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot; (1924), and it established Clair as a leading member of the Parisian avant-garde.
Fantasy and dreams were also components of his next two films, but in 1926 Clair took a new direction when he joined Alexandre Kamenka&#x27;s Films Albatros company to film a dramatic story, &quot;La Proie du vent&quot; (&quot;The Prey of the Wind&quot;), which met with commercial success. He remained at Albatros for his last two silent films, &quot;Un chapeau de paille d&#x27;Italie&quot; (&quot;An Italian Straw Hat&quot;) and &quot;Les Deux Timides&quot; (&quot;Two Timid Souls&quot;) (both 1928), in which he sought to translate the essentially verbal comedy of two plays by Labiche into works of silent cinema. While at Albatros, Clair met the designer Lazare Meerson and the cameraman Georges Périnal who were to remain important collaborators with him for the next decade. By the end of the silent era, Clair was celebrated as one of the great names in cinema, alongside Griffith, Chaplin, Pabst and Eisenstein. As the author of all of his own scripts, who also paid close attention to every aspect of the making of a film, including the editing, Clair was one of the first French film-makers to establish for himself the full role of an &quot;auteur&quot;.

Clair was initially sceptical about the introduction of sound to films, and called it &quot;an unnatural creation&quot;. He then realised the creative possibilities that it offered, particularly, in his view, if the soundtrack was not used realistically; words and pictures need not, and indeed should not, be tied together in a clumsy duplication of information; dialogue did not always need to be heard. Between 1930 and 1933, Clair explored these ideas in his first four sound films, starting with &quot;Sous les toits de Paris&quot; (&quot;Under the Roofs of Paris&quot;); this was followed by &quot;Le Million&quot; (1931), &quot;À nous la liberté&quot; (1931), and &quot;Quatorze juillet&quot; (&quot;Bastille Day&quot;) (1933). All of these films portrayed an affectionate and idealized view of working class life, and they did much to create a popular romantic image of Paris which was seen around the world. These films were made at the Epinay Studios for Films Sonores Tobis, a French subsidiary of the German-owned Tobis company.

When Chaplin made &quot;Modern Times&quot; in 1936, it was noted that some parts of it bore a marked similarity to scenes in &quot;À nous la liberté&quot;, and the production company Tobis launched a lawsuit for plagiarism against United Artists, the producers of Chaplin&#x27;s film. Clair was embarrassed by this since he acknowledged his own debt to the spirit of Chaplin, and he refused to be associated with the action.

After the immense success of these early sound films, Clair met with a major setback when his next film, &quot;Le Dernier Milliardaire&quot; (&quot;The Last Billionaire&quot;/&quot;The Last Millionaire&quot;) (1934), was a critical and commercial flop. While he was visiting London for the film&#x27;s British première, he met Alexander Korda who offered him a contract to work in England. He accepted, and began a lengthy period of exile from film-making in France.

===1935–1946===
Clair&#x27;s contract with Korda&#x27;s London Films was for two years and it envisaged three films. Because of his limited English, he collaborated with the American dramatist Robert E. Sherwood as script-writer for his first film, &quot;The Ghost Goes West&quot; (1935), a comic fantasy about transatlantic culture clash. Clair and Sherwood became close friends. In January 1936, Clair visited America for two weeks, checking out for future employment possibilities but still planning to remain with Korda. Korda however rejected Clair&#x27;s next script and they parted company. Clair&#x27;s remaining time in England led to only one more completed film, &quot;Break the News&quot; (1938), a musical comedy with Jack Buchanan and Maurice Chevalier.

Returning to France, Clair attempted to make another film there in 1939, &quot;Air pur&quot;, which was to be a celebration of youth and childhood, but the outbreak of war interrupted filming and it was abandoned. In May 1940, Jean Giraudoux, then Minister of Information, suggested to Clair that the film profession should concentrate its resources in the south of country in Nice and Marseille – and if necessary establish a French production centre in the United States. It was with this last plan in mind that Clair and his family, along with Julien Duvivier, departed for America, but by the time he reached New York the project had already fallen through and he went straight on to Hollywood where several studios were interested in employing him. He made his first American film for Universal Studios, &quot;The Flame of New Orleans&quot; (1941), but it was such a commercial failure that for a time Clair&#x27;s career as a director was in the balance. After more than a year&#x27;s delay, his next film was &quot;I Married a Witch&quot; (1942), followed by &quot;It Happened Tomorrow&quot; (1944), both of which did respectably well, and then &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (1945), which turned out to be an exceptional commercial success despite being perhaps the least personal of his Hollywood ventures. Each of Clair&#x27;s American films was made for a different studio.

In 1941 Clair was stripped of his French citizenship by the Vichy government, though this was later reversed. It was also in 1941 that he learned of the death of his brother Henri Chomette in France from polio. In 1943, he was planning to go to Algeria to organise the Service Cinématographique de l&#x27;Armée, but funding for the project was withdrawn just as he was on the point of departure. In July 1945 he went back to France for a short visit, and then returned finally in July 1946, having signed a contract with RKO for his next film to be made in France.

Clair&#x27;s American exile had allowed him to develop his characteristic vein of ironical fantasy with several commercially successful films, but there was some feeling that it had been at the expense of personal control and that his output there had not matched the quality of his earlier work in France. Clair himself recognised that being employed by the highly organized American studios had allowed him to work in ideal circumstances: &quot;In spite of the restrictions of the American system, it is possible, if one wishes, to take responsibility. In my four Hollywood films I managed to do what I wanted.&quot;

===1947–1965===
Clair&#x27;s first film on his return to France was the romantic comedy &quot;Le silence est d&#x27;or&quot; (&quot;Silence is Golden&quot;) (1947), which was set in 1906 and nostalgically evoked the world of early French film-making; its plot also created variations on Molière&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;École des femmes&quot;. Clair considered it one of his best post-war films. Literary inspirations also underpinned other films: Faust for &quot;La Beauté du diable&quot; (&quot;Beauty and the Devil&quot;) (1950); and Don Juan for &quot;Les Grandes Manœuvres&quot; (1955). In these two films and the intervening &quot;Les Belles de nuit&quot; (&quot;Beauties of the Night&quot;) (1952), the leading actor was Gérard Philipe who became a friend and a favourite performer for Clair. &quot;Porte des Lilas&quot; (1957) was a sombre film, set once again in a popular district of Paris with its picturesque inhabitants, for which the singer Georges Brassens was persuaded to give his only film performance.

During the 1950s, as a new generation of French critics and film-makers emerged who were impatient of the prevailing modes of film production, Clair found himself increasingly criticised as a representative of the &quot;cinéma de qualité&quot;, a &quot;cinema of old men&quot; dominated by nostalgia for their younger days. His status as a figure of the &#x27;establishment&#x27; was further confirmed by his election to the Académie Française in 1960. Although he continued to make a few more films in comic vein such as &quot;Tout l&#x27;or du monde&quot; (&quot;All the Gold in the World&quot;) (1961), they were not well received and he made his last film, &quot;Les Fêtes galantes&quot; (&quot;The Lace Wars&quot;), in 1965.

==Writing and later work==
Clair began his career as a journalist, and writing remained an important interest for him to which he increasingly turned in his later years. In 1926 he published a novel, &quot;Adams&quot; (translated into English as &quot;Star Turn&quot;), about a Hollywood star for whom the distinction between the real and unreal becomes blurred. He occasionally returned to writing fiction (&quot;La Princesse de Chine&quot; and &quot;Jeux du hasard&quot;), but many of his publications dealt with the cinema, including reflections on his own films. Apart from many journal articles, his main publications were:
* &quot;Adams&quot;. (Paris: Grasset, 1926). English translation, &quot;Star Turn&quot;, (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1936).
* &quot;Réflexion faite&quot;. (Paris: Gallimard, 1951). English translation, &quot;Reflections on the Cinema&quot;. (London: William Kimber, 1953).
* &quot;La Princesse de Chine, suivi de De fil en aiguille&quot;. (Paris: Grasset, 1951).
* &quot;Comédies et commentaires&quot;. (Paris: Gallimard, 1959) [includes 5 of Clair&#x27;s screenplays]. English translation, in part, &quot;Four Screenplays&quot;. (New York: Orion Press, 1970).
* &quot;Discours de réception à l&#x27;Académie française&quot;. (Paris: Gallimard, 1962).
* &quot;Tout l&#x27;or du monde&quot;. (Paris: Gallimard, 1962).
* &quot;Cinéma d&#x27;hier, cinéma d&#x27;aujourd&#x27;hui&quot;. (Paris: Gallimard, 1970). English translation, &quot;Cinema Yesterday and Today&quot;. (New York: Dover, 1972).
* &quot;L&#x27;Étrange Ouvrage des cieux, d&#x27;après The Dutch Courtezan de Jon Marston&quot;. (Paris: Gallimard, 1972).
* &quot;Jeux du hasard: récits et nouvelles&quot;. (Paris: Gallimard, 1976).

Clair also ventured into other media. In 1951 he directed his first radio production, &quot;Une larme du diable&quot;. In 1959 he directed a stage production of Musset&#x27;s &quot;On ne badine pas avec l&#x27;amour&quot;, in which Gérard Philipe gave one of his last performances before his death. In 1972 he staged Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orphée&quot; for the Paris Opéra.

==Personal life==
At the end of 1924, while Clair was working on &quot;Ciné-sketch&quot; for the theatre with France Picabia, he first met a young actress, Bronja Perlmutter, who subsequently appeared in his film &quot;Le Voyage imaginaire&quot; (1926) premiered at the newly opened Studio des Ursulines. They married in 1926, and their son, Jean-François, was born in 1927.

René Clair died at home on 15 March 1981, and he was buried privately at Saint-Germain-l&#x27;Auxerrois.

==Reputation==

Clair&#x27;s reputation as a film-maker underwent a considerable reevaluation during the course of his own lifetime: in the 1930s he was widely seen as one of France&#x27;s greatest directors, alongside Renoir and Carné, but thereafter his work&#x27;s artifice and detachment from the realities of life fell increasingly from favour. The avant-gardism of his first films, and especially &quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot;, had given him a temporary notoriety, and a grounding in surrealism continued to underlie much of his comedy work. It was however the imaginative manner in which he overcame his initial scepticism about the arrival of sound which established his originality, and his first four sound films brought him international fame.

Clair&#x27;s years of working in the UK and USA made him still more widely known but did not show any marked development in his style or thematic concerns. It was in the post-war films that he made on his return to France that some critics have observed a new maturity and emotional depth, accompanied by a prevailing sense of melancholy but still framed by the elegance and wit that characterised his earlier work.

However, in the 1950s the critics who heralded the arrival of the French New Wave, especially those associated with &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;, found Clair&#x27;s work old-fashioned and academic. François Truffaut wrote harshly of him after seeing &quot;The Flame of New Orleans&quot;: &quot;We don&#x27;t follow our elders in paying the same tribute to Renoir and Clair. There is no film by Clair which matches the invention and wit of Renoir&#x27;s &quot;Tire au flanc&quot;... Clair makes films for old ladies who go to the cinema twice a year.&quot;

André Bazin, the founding editor of &quot;Cahiers&quot;, made a more measured assessment: &quot;René Clair has remained in a way a film-maker of the silent cinema. Whatever the quality and importance of his recent films, expression through the image always predominates over that of the word and one almost never misses the essence if one can only vaguely hear the dialogue.&quot; It was also in a special number of &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; reviewing the current state of the French cinema in 1957 that Clair received one of his most positive appreciations: &quot;A complete film author who, since the silent era, has brought to the French cinema intelligence, refinement, humour, an intellectual quality that is slightly dry but smiling and in good taste... Whatever may follow in his rich career, he has created a cinematic world that is his own, full of rigour and not lacking in imagination, thanks to which he remains one of our greatest film-makers.&quot;

Such appreciations have subsequently been rare, and the self-contained artificiality of Clair&#x27;s films, his insistence on the meticulous preparation of an often literary script, and his preference for filming in studio sets rather than on location increasingly set him apart from modern trends in film-making. The paradox of Clair&#x27;s reputation has been further heightened by those commentators who have seen François Truffaut as the French cinema&#x27;s true successor to Clair, notwithstanding the occasions of their mutual disdain.

==Awards and honours==
René Clair held the national honours of Grand officier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur, Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres, and Grand-croix de l&#x27;ordre national du Mérite. He received the Grand Prix du cinéma français in 1953.

In 1956 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Cambridge.

In 1960 he was elected to the Académie Française; he was not the first film-maker so honoured (he was preceded by Marcel Pagnol (1946), Jean Cocteau (1955), and Marcel Achard (1959)) but he was the first to be elected primarily as a film-maker. In 1994 the Académie established the Prix René-Clair as an annual prize awarded to a distinguished film-maker.

In 1967 he received an honorary doctorate from the Royal College of Art in London.

As well as many awards made for individual films, Clair received an honorary prize at the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979 for his contribution to cinema.

Place René Clair in Boulogne-Billancourt, on the outskirts of Paris and near the site of the former film studios in that district, is named after him.

<doc id="724596" wikidata="Q951835" url="?curid=724596" title="Louis Feuillade">
<text>Louis Feuillade (; 19 February 1873 – 25 February 1925) was a French filmmaker of the silent era. Between 1906 and 1924, he directed over 630 films. He is primarily known for the crime serials &quot;Fantômas&quot;, &quot;Les Vampires&quot; and &quot;Judex&quot; made between 1913 and 1916.

==Early life and career==
Feuillade was born in Lunel, Hérault, to Barthélémy Feuillade, a modest wine merchant, and Marie Avesque. From an early age, he showed a deep interest in literature and created numerous drama and vaudeville projects. His excessively academic poems were occasionally published in local newspapers, and he acquired a reputation for his articles devoted to bullfighting. At twelve, he was sent by his parents to a Catholic seminary in Carcassonne, which has been credited for his gothic stylization in his later career. His biographer Francis Lacassin has suggested that &quot;the strange, surrealist flashes of anarchy which spark through the work of this pillar of society can only be explained as some sort of unconscious revolt to which he gave rein in his dreams — that is to say, in his films.&quot; He then began his compulsory military service in 1891 until 1895, when he married Jeanne-Leontine Jaujou on 31 October 1895. After the deaths of his parents, he went to Paris in 1902 seeking literary success, but would suffer miserably for several years.

At the beginning of 1905, he started to submit screenplays to Gaumont, and Gaumont&#x27;s artistic director Alice Guy-Blaché both bought his scripts and invited Feuillade to direct them himself. Concerned about his financial difficulties and family to support, Feuillade declined the directing job in order to continue working as a journalist. At his suggestion, Guy-Blaché hired Étienne Arnaud to direct Feuillade&#x27;s early screenplays at Gaumont. But, by 1906, he had gained enough confidence to start directing his own scripts, which were mostly comedies. In 1907, Guy-Blaché moved to the United States and upon her suggestion Feuillade was made Artistic Director of Gaumont. He would work for Gaumont until 1918, while at the same time producing his own films, so that by 1925, the year of his death, he estimated that he had made around 800 films. (At the time he started in cinema, a film rarely lasted more than ten minutes). He made films of all types—trick films at the beginning, modeled on those of Georges Méliès, comedies, bourgeois dramas, historical or biblical dramas, mysteries and exotic adventures—but he is remembered best for his serial films.

Louis Feuillade was the father-in-law of the French film director Maurice Champreux and the grandfather of the French actor, screenwriter, and film director Jacques Champreux.

==Serial films==

The &quot;Fantômas&quot; serial in 1913 was his first masterpiece, the result of a long apprenticeship—during which the series with realistic ambitions, &quot;Life as it is&quot;, played a major role. It is also the first masterpiece in what the modern critic, from both a literary and a cinematographic point of view, would later call &quot;the fantastic realism&quot; or the &quot;social fantastic&quot;.
He is credited with developing many of the thriller techniques used by Fritz Lang, Alfred Hitchcock, and others.

<doc id="724601" wikidata="Q4654" url="?curid=724601" title="Fortuna">
<text>Fortuna (, equivalent to the Greek goddess Tyche) is the goddess of fortune and the personification of luck in Roman religion who, largely thanks to the Late Antique author Boethius, remained popular through the Middle Ages until at least the Renaissance. The blindfolded depiction of her is still an important figure in many aspects of today&#x27;s Italian culture, where the dichotomy &quot;fortuna / sfortuna&quot; (luck / unluck) plays a prominent role in everyday social life, also represented by the very common refrain &quot;La [dea] fortuna è cieca&quot; (latin &quot;Fortuna caeca est&quot;; &quot;Luck [goddess] is blind&quot;).

Fortuna is often depicted with a gubernaculum (ship&#x27;s rudder), a ball or Rota Fortunae (wheel of fortune, first mentioned by Cicero) and a cornucopia (horn of plenty). She might bring good or bad luck: she could be represented as veiled and blind, as in modern depictions of Lady Justice, except that Fortuna does not hold a balance. Fortuna came to represent life&#x27;s capriciousness. She was also a goddess of fate: as &quot;Atrox Fortuna&quot;, she claimed the young lives of the princeps Augustus&#x27; grandsons Gaius and Lucius, prospective heirs to the Empire. (In antiquity she was also known as &quot;Automatia&quot;.)

==Ancient cult==
Fortuna&#x27;s father was said to be Jupiter and like him, she could also be bountiful (&quot;Copia&quot;). As &quot;Annonaria&quot; she protected grain supplies. June 11 was consecrated to her: on June 24 she was given cult at the festival of &quot;Fors Fortuna&quot;. Fortuna&#x27;s name seems to derive from &quot;Vortumna&quot; (she who revolves the year).

Roman writers disagreed whether her cult was introduced to Rome by Servius Tullius or Ancus Marcius. The two earliest temples mentioned in Roman Calendars were outside the city, on the right bank of the Tiber (in Italian Trastevere). The first temple dedicated to Fortuna was attributed to the Etruscan Servius Tullius, while the second is known to have been built in 293 BC as the fulfilment of a Roman promise made during later Etruscan wars. The date of dedication of her temples was 24 June, or Midsummer&#x27;s Day, when celebrants from Rome annually floated to the temples downstream from the city. After undisclosed rituals they then rowed back, garlanded and inebriated. Also Fortuna had a temple at the Forum Boarium. Here Fortuna was twinned with the cult of Mater Matuta (the goddesses shared a festival on 11 June), and the paired temples have been revealed in the excavation beside the church of Sant&#x27;Omobono: the cults are indeed archaic in date. Fortuna Primigenia of Praeneste was adopted by Romans at the end of 3rd century BC in an important cult of &quot;Fortuna Publica Populi Romani&quot; (the &quot;Official Good Luck of the Roman People&quot;) on the Quirinalis outside the Porta Collina. No temple at Rome, however, rivalled the magnificence of the Praenestine sanctuary.

Fortuna&#x27;s identity as personification of chance events was closely tied to &quot;virtus&quot; (strength of character). Public officials who lacked virtues invited ill-fortune on themselves and Rome: Sallust uses the infamous Catiline as illustration – &quot;Truly, when in the place of work, idleness, in place of the spirit of measure and equity, caprice and pride invade, fortune is changed just as with morality&quot;.

An oracle at the Temple of Fortuna Primigena in Praeneste used a form of divination in which a small boy picked out one of various futures that were written on oak rods. Cults to Fortuna in her many forms are attested throughout the Roman world. Dedications have been found to &quot;Fortuna Dubia&quot; (doubtful fortune), &quot;Fortuna Brevis&quot; (fickle or wayward fortune) and &quot;Fortuna Mala&quot; (bad fortune).

Fortuna is found in a variety of domestic and personal contexts. During the early Empire, an amulet from the House of Menander in Pompeii links her to the Egyptian goddess Isis, as Isis-Fortuna. She is functionally related to the god Bonus Eventus, who is often represented as her counterpart: both appear on amulets and intaglio engraved gems across the Roman world. In the context of the early Roman Republic account of Coriolanus, in around 488 BC the Roman senate dedicated a temple to Fortuna on account of the services of the matrons of Rome in saving the city from destruction. Evidence of Fortuna worship has been found as far north as Castlecary, Scotland and an altar and statue can now be viewed at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow.

The earliest reference to the Wheel of Fortune, emblematic of the endless changes in life between prosperity and disaster, is from 55 BC. In Seneca&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, a chorus addresses Fortuna in terms that would remain almost proverbial, and in a high heroic ranting mode that Renaissance writers would emulate: 
Ovid&#x27;s description is typical of Roman representations: in a letter from exile he reflects ruefully on the &quot;goddess who admits by her unsteady wheel her own fickleness; she always has its apex beneath her swaying foot.&quot;

== Middle Ages and Renaissance==
Fortuna did not disappear from the popular imagination with the ascendancy of Christianity. Saint Augustine took a stand against her continuing presence, in the &quot;City of God&quot;: &quot;How, therefore, is she good, who without discernment comes to both the good and to the bad?...It profits one nothing to worship her if she is truly &quot;fortune&quot;... let the bad worship her...this supposed deity&quot;. In the 6th century, the &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot;, by statesman and philosopher Boethius, written while he faced execution, reflected the Christian theology of &quot;casus&quot;, that the apparently random and often ruinous turns of Fortune&#x27;s Wheel are in fact both inevitable and providential, that even the most coincidental events are part of God&#x27;s hidden plan which one should not resist or try to change. Fortuna, then, was a servant of God, and events, individual decisions, the influence of the stars were all merely vehicles of Divine Will. In succeeding generations Boethius&#x27; &quot;Consolation&quot; was required reading for scholars and students. Fortune crept back into popular acceptance, with a new iconographic trait, &quot;two-faced Fortune&quot;, &quot;Fortuna bifrons&quot;; such depictions continue into the 15th century.

The ubiquitous image of the Wheel of Fortune found throughout the Middle Ages and beyond was a direct legacy of the second book of Boethius&#x27;s &quot;Consolation&quot;. The Wheel appears in many renditions from tiny miniatures in manuscripts to huge stained glass windows in cathedrals, such as at Amiens. Lady Fortune is usually represented as larger than life to underscore her importance. The wheel characteristically has four shelves, or stages of life, with four human figures, usually labeled on the left &quot;regnabo&quot; (I shall reign), on the top &quot;regno&quot; (I reign) and is usually crowned, descending on the right &quot;regnavi&quot; (I have reigned) and the lowly figure on the bottom is marked &quot;sum sine regno&quot; (I have no kingdom). Medieval representations of Fortune emphasize her duality and instability, such as two faces side by side like Janus; one face smiling the other frowning; half the face white the other black; she may be blindfolded but without scales, blind to justice. She was associated with the cornucopia, ship&#x27;s rudder, the ball and the wheel. The cornucopia is where plenty flows from, the Helmsman&#x27;s rudder steers fate, the globe symbolizes chance (who gets good or bad luck), and the wheel symbolizes that luck, good or bad, never lasts.

Fortune would have many influences in cultural works throughout the Middle Ages. In &quot;Le Roman de la Rose&quot;, Fortune frustrates the hopes of a lover who has been helped by a personified character &quot;Reason&quot;. In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; (vii.67-96), Virgil explains the nature of Fortune, both a devil and a ministering angel, subservient to God. Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;De Casibus Virorum Illustrium&quot; (&quot;The Fortunes of Famous Men&quot;), used by John Lydgate to compose his &quot;Fall of Princes&quot;, tells of many where the turn of Fortune&#x27;s wheel brought those most high to disaster, and Boccaccio essay &quot;De remedii dell&#x27;una e dell&#x27;altra Fortuna&quot;, depends upon Boethius for the double nature of Fortuna. Fortune makes her appearance in &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; (see image). The Christianized Lady Fortune is not autonomous: illustrations for Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Remedii&quot; show Fortuna enthroned in a triumphal car with reins that lead to heaven.

Fortuna also appears in chapter 25 of Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;The Prince&quot;, in which he says Fortune only rules one half of men&#x27;s fate, the other half being of their own will. Machiavelli reminds the reader that Fortune is a woman, that she favours a strong, ambitious hand, and that she favours the more aggressive and bold young man than a timid elder. Monteverdi&#x27;s opera &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; features Fortuna, contrasted with the goddess Virtue. Even Shakespeare was no stranger to Lady Fortune:

Ignatius J Reilly, the protagonist in the famous John Kennedy Toole novel &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, identifies Fortuna as the agent of change in his life. A verbose, preposterous medievalist, Ignatius is of the mindset that he does not belong in the world and that his numerous failings are the work of some higher power. He continually refers to Fortuna as having spun him downwards on her wheel of luck, as in &quot;Oh, Fortuna, you degenerate wanton!&quot;
The Wheel of Fortune also has concerns with occultism and Satanism.

== Pars Fortuna in astrology ==
In astrology, the term &quot;Pars Fortuna&quot; represents a mathematical point in the zodiac derived by the longitudinal positions of the Sun, Moon and Ascendant (Rising sign) in the birth chart of an individual. It represents an especially beneficial point in the horoscopic chart. In Arabic astrology, this and similar points are called Arabian Parts.

Al-Biruni (973 – 1048), an 11th-century mathematician, astronomer, and scholar, who was the greatest proponent of this system of prediction, listed a total of 97 Arabic Parts, which were widely used for astrological consultations.

<doc id="724605" wikidata="Q5229727" url="?curid=724605" title="Dave Ross">
<text>Dave Ross (born April 10, 1952) is a retired talk show host on Seattle&#x27;s KIRO-FM radio station. He joined KIRO as a news anchor in 1978 and was given his own talk show in 1987. He has sometimes broadcast his show while on assignment in other locations, including overseas, such as Baghdad, Iraq in April 2004. Ross was also heard on the CBS Radio Network, where he provides daily political commentary.

Ross was the 2004 Democratic Party candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives for . For more than three decades in his spare time he has been performing with the Seattle Gilbert and Sullivan Society.

==Broadcast career==
Born into a Catholic family in Yorktown Heights, New York, Ross is the son of a commercial artist and has a brother and two sisters. He started his broadcast career at the age of 15 at WVIP in Mt. Kisco, New York. After graduating from Cornell University in 1973, where he was a member of the Cornell University Glee Club, The Hangovers, and the Quill and Dagger society, Ross worked as a reporter at WSB in Atlanta, Georgia from 1973 to 1978.

The same year he joined radio station KIRO (AM) in Seattle as a news anchor. In addition to his talk show, Ross broadcast a national daily commentary on the CBS Radio Network. From 1983 to 2004 he hosted and produced the first syndicated daily radio report on computers, for the Associated Press, called &quot;Chip Talk&quot;. He was also part of the 1995 Launch Team for CNET, where he contributed segments called &quot;The Last Word&quot; to &quot;c|net central&quot;. Since 1992, Ross has also filled in for CBS Radio colleague Charles Osgood on his &quot;Osgood File&quot; commentaries. Ross has broadcast from overseas or outside Seattle to cover various historic events. For example, on the eve of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Ross traveled to the Persian Gulf to broadcast his radio show from Qatar. Other field trips included forays to cover the Pope&#x27;s visit to Britain in 1982, trips to China in 1984 and the Soviet Union in 1987, the toppling of the Berlin Wall and the revolution in Czechoslovakia in 1989, the 1992 Rodney King riots Los Angeles, a 2002 trip to Jerusalem after a series of suicide bombings, a trip to Baghdad in April 2004 and many others.

Ross has generally been portrayed as liberal (although he has also been called a moderate), but is also known for bringing those with opposing conservative views on his radio program to interview and debate. According to the &quot;Seattle Times&quot;: &quot;Ross listens, circles around guests with Socratic questions, then makes sharp observations but never goes for the jugular... [He] remains gracious.&quot; In addition to his editorials, Ross is also known for his &quot;flitch&quot; songs (songs using existing melodies, but with new lyrics, usually based on current events) and often sings one as part of his radio show and CBS segments. &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the best of [these] could stand alongside those of the legendary Tom Lehrer.&quot;

Ross received the 2001 and 2005 RTNDA Edward R. Murrow Award for Best Commentary. He was unable to accept the 2001 award personally, however, because the ceremony was scheduled for September 12, 2001. He was booked on a flight to Nashville on September 11, 2001, but instead ended up on assignment in New York City covering the terrorist attacks. Ross has also received a Marconi Award nomination and Clarion and Gabriel Awards. He was voted &quot;Best Talk Show Host&quot; by the &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot;.

In 2013, Ross began to host the &quot;Seattle Morning News&quot;. He retired from radio broadcasting on December 19, 2024, with his last show on &quot;SMN&quot;. Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell appeared on Ross&#x27;s final episode to read a proclamation that declared that day &quot;Dave Ross Day&quot;, and Governor Jay Inslee called in to the show.

==Personal life==
Ross has served as President of the St. Monica&#x27;s school commission, a member of the Eastside Board of Catholic Community Services, and he was on the steering committee of the Campaign 5000 African-American community development bank. As of 2007, he served on the boards of the Seattle Transportation Choices Coalition and Economic Opportunity Institute.

He met his wife Patti at Cornell, and they married in 1973. They have two daughters, Caitlin and Emilie.

==2004 US House election==
In May 2004, Ross announced his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives for as a Democrat. He began a leave of absence from KIRO at noon on July 23, 2004, to coincide with the beginning of his active candidacy. The seat was held by Republican Jennifer Dunn, who retired in 2004.

In the primary election held on September 14, 2004, Ross decisively defeated fellow Democrats Alex Alben and Heidi Behrens-Benedict. In the general election against King County Sheriff Dave Reichert in the general election on November 2, 2004, anti-Ross advertisements paid for by the National Republican Congressional Committee said that Ross &quot;empowered terrorists&quot; and that he would &quot;wave a white flag&quot; against them. The commercials said that Ross supported cuts to defense spending by $100 billion, but in fact Ross&#x27; statement was that he opposed the $100 billion missile-defense system sought by the Bush administration.

&quot;CQPolitics&quot; described the race this way: &quot;Reichert&#x27;s record as sheriff – which included capture of the notorious &quot;Green River&quot; serial killer – enabled him to defeat Democrat Dave Ross, a well-known Seattle-based radio talk show host, in 2004 with 51.5 percent and a 5 percentage-point margin.&quot; Ross returned to his talk show the following day.

==Seattle Gilbert and Sullivan Society performances==
Ross is a member of the Seattle Gilbert and Sullivan Society, and has regularly appeared in their summer performances at Seattle Center, playing over 30 roles with the company. A 2006 review commented that &quot;Ross, in his 27th season with the company, underplays the Major-General masterfully—snappy, energetic, not too mannered. ... [His] grand and hilarious [entrance] scene, especially at the insouciantly zippy tempo Ross takes, provided a lift and exhilaration I haven&#x27;t felt in a while from any musical performance.&quot; Ross has received many warm reviews for his portrayal of the famous Gilbert &amp; Sullivan &quot;patter&quot; roles and other baritone roles in the Savoy operas. At the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in Buxton, England, he played the role of Rudolph in the company&#x27;s &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; in 1999 and also appeared at the festival in 1996.

<text>The Progressive People&#x27;s Party (, FVP) was a social liberal party in the German Empire. It was formed on 6 March 1910 from the merger of the Free-minded People&#x27;s Party, the Free-minded Union and the German People&#x27;s Party. The FVP advocated the parliamentarisation of the Empire and socio-political changes such as universal suffrage and the right to form and join trade unions. Its membership was largely middle class, including merchants, mid-level civil servants, salaried employees and academics. It occasionally cooperated with the Social Democratic Party before World War I. Although initially in favour of a wartime policy of annexations, it later supported the 1917 Reichstag Peace Resolution and the constitutional reforms of October 1918. After the war, the FVP joined with the left wing of the National Liberal Party to form the German Democratic Party of the Weimar Republic.

== Background ==
At the beginning of the 20th century, the Free-minded People&#x27;s Party (, also FVP), the Free-minded Union (, FVG) and the German People&#x27;s Party (, DtVP) together represented a range of left-liberal viewpoints. Efforts to overcome the fragmentation began in 1903 when an electoral alliance was formed between the FVP and the DtVP. Before the 1907 Reichstag election, the two free-minded parties joined the Bülow bloc, an electoral alliance formed by Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow after the Reichstag, led by the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Centre Party, rejected his supplemental budget bill to fund the Herero Wars in German South West Africa. The bloc was made up of Conservatives, National Liberals and the left-liberal parties. Because of the FVG&#x27;s cooperation with the conservatives in the Bülow bloc, Theodor Barth and his supporters split away from the party in the spring of 1908 and formed the Democratic Union (, DV). In the 1907 Reichstag, the three left-liberal parties united in a parliamentary caucus, and in 1910 they merged to become the Progressive People&#x27;s Party. 

== Party program ==

The party program of the Progressive People&#x27;s Party centred on increasing the influence of the middle class and expanding political freedom. It called for equal, direct and universal suffrage in both the Reich and its individual states and for the abolition of the three-class voting system used in Prussia, which weighted votes based on the amount of taxes paid and consequently diluted the strength of middle- and working-class votes. The party also sought a fair division of electoral districts, which had become heavily unbalanced in favour of rural regions due to the lack of reapportionments during a period when urban industrial centres were growing rapidly. The Progressives furthermore supported a consistent separation of church and state and a modification of the Reich constitution that would make the Empire a parliamentary monarchy.

Economically and socially, the party advocated a gradual reduction of food and industrial tariffs; progressive taxation of Income, wealth and inheritance; the safeguarding and expansion of the right of workers to form and join trade unions; the improvement of occupational safety; and the introduction of measures to protect the unemployed. The national and state parliaments and governments were to be encouraged to work with self-help organizations to improve the economic and social situation of wage and salary earners. At the international level, the party stood for peaceful conciliation by developing international law and international courts of arbitration.

The party&#x27;s liberal economics represented the interests of the export industry, trade, banks, crafts and commerce. Overall the orientation was towards a welfare state rather than Manchester liberalism. The party wanted to raise the general welfare and promote social progress and public education. The scope of its goals was substantial for a party of the German Empire.

Historian Dieter Langewiesche wrote that the party program showed the momentum of a newly invigorated left-wing liberalism. He saw it as particularly evident in social policy. Self-help, no longer a matter of political dogma, was accompanied by demands for state intervention. The party did not, however, advocate equal rights for women extending beyond the right to vote. Friedrich Naumann called for it but was not able to make it part of the FVP&#x27;s program.

== Organisation ==

The party was tightly organised. At the top was a central committee which included the FVP Reichstag members and the executive committee, sixty representatives of the regional associations, and a few appointees. Political questions were decided by the Reichstag party members and organisational matters by the executive committee. The financial situation of the party was often difficult because of late or skipped dues payments.

In 1912 the party had around 1,452 local branches with a total of some 120,000 members. They came mainly from the lower and middle levels of the bourgeoisie. Tradespeople, merchants, mid-level civil servants, salaried employees and academics were among the groups most strongly represented. The number of primary school teachers and Protestant pastors was also relatively high. In some areas, such as Oldenburg and the Province of Schleswig-Holstein, the party had supporters among farmers, but it had relatively little success with lower-level employees and workers. It tried to increase its share of workers by encouraging the founding of liberal workers&#x27; associations, but by 1914 they had achieved a membership of just 5,000.

There were a number of unaffiliated associations which exerted influence on the party. They included the Commercial Treaty Association, in which merchants and entrepreneurs had joined forces to promote free trade. Other associations included the Hansa Federation for Trade, Commerce and Industry; liberal farmers‘ and agricultural workers’ organizations; the General German Teachers‘ Association; the Hirsch-Duncker trade unions with around 100,000 members; and, to some extent, Protestant workers’ associations.

== Politics ==

Due to its left-wing liberal positions, the party was mostly in opposition to the government&#x27;s domestic, economic and fiscal policies. The FVP&#x27;s main opponents in the Reichstag were the German Conservative Party and, in the early years, the Catholic Centre Party.

A key question for the liberal parties in the Reichstag was whether to work with the Social Democrats (SPD). Friedrich Naumann coined a slogan urging a ‘bloc from Bassermann to Bebel’, referring to Ernst Bassermann, the chairman of the National Liberal Party and his SPD counterpart August Bebel. Naumann&#x27;s idea was supported by the Hansa Federation, which wanted to create a reform bloc separate from the conservative-agrarian interests, but it caused considerable controversy in the Progressive Party. Its chairman Otto Fischbeck spoke of a ‘grand bloc utopia’ at the Reich level. Bassermann and Bebel also opposed it.

The left-liberal parties&#x27; political positions were less rigid than they had been in the past. In 1911 the Liberals, Centre and Social Democrats had made it possible to reform the constitution of Alsace–Lorraine. In 1912 the FVP and Social Democrats concluded a comprehensive agreement on runoff elections. The party leadership&#x27;s action led to protests from some members, and the agreement was followed by only about half the voters. It was also opposed by some in the Social Democratic Party.

In the 1912 Reichstag election, the FVP received 11.9% of the vote and 41 seats. Compared to the 50 seats won by the founding parties in 1907, it meant a parliamentary weakening of left-wing liberalism. The share of the vote, however, had increased by 1.2 percentage points compared to 1907. (The discrepancy between the loss of seats and the gain in the percentage of votes was likely due to the large differences in the number of voters in electoral districts.)

In the Reichstag, the FVP and Social Democrats worked together, and at times the National Liberals also joined them. In 1913 the FVP and the SPD pushed through a capital gains tax against the opposition of the conservatives in order to finance an increase in the size of the army.

== World War I ==

In the early phases of World War I, there were essentially three positions on its aims. Some in the FVP, including Friedrich Naumann, assumed a victory which would allow Germany to establish a &quot;Central Europe&quot; () that it would dominate. They also called for annexations and the formation of buffer states around Germany. A middle group advocated a peace based on security needs, while the third group pushed for a negotiated peace. One opponent of expansionist war aims was the 1927 Nobel Peace Prize winner Ludwig Quidde. Conflicts arose between FVP members who held different positions, although overall the party kept to the middle on the issue of war aims.

The FVP worked with the Centre Party, the Social Democrats and, at times, the National Liberals in the inter-party committee which they formed in July 1917 to coordinate their work in the Reichstag. The committee supported the Reichstag Peace Resolution of 19 July 1917 which called for a peace treaty with no annexations and no indemnities. In the same year, Friedrich von Payer became vice chancellor in Georg von Hertling&#x27;s government, making the left-liberals something close to a governing party. The FVP also backed the October 1918 constitutional reforms, which transformed the German Empire into a parliamentary monarchy during the government of Max von Baden. Conrad Haussmann of the FVP was a minister without portfolio in Baden&#x27;s cabinet. On 20 November 1918, in the early weeks of the post-war German revolution, the Progressive People&#x27;s Party dissolved itself and merged with the left wing of the National Liberal Party to form the German Democratic Party (DDP) of the Weimar Republic.

<doc id="724616" wikidata="Q5196512" url="?curid=724616" title="Customs and etiquette in Hawaii">
<text>Customs and etiquette in Hawaii are customs and general etiquette that are widely observed in the Hawaiian Islands. In most cases, these will be observed by long-time residents and Native Hawaiians. Some customs are unique to certain ethnic groups but are commonly observed and known by all residents.

&quot;Make plate&quot; or &quot;Take plate&quot; are common in gatherings of friends or family that follow a potluck format. It is considered good manners to &quot;make plate&quot;, literally making a plate of food from the available spread to take home, or &quot;take plate&quot;, literally taking a plate the host of the party has made of the available spread for easy left-overs.

It is considered gracious to take the plate, or make a small plate, even if you don&#x27;t intend to eat it. In part, this tradition is related to clean-up, being a good guest by not leaving the mass of left-overs at the party-throwers house and making them alone responsible for clean up. In more recent times, this has also evolved into donating your left-overs to the homeless population, especially if you&#x27;re having a get-together at a public park or similar location, as it is likely there is a homeless population living nearby as well.

It is also considered thoughtful to bring back gifts from a trip for friends and family. Some people use the Japanese name for such gifts, &quot;omiyage&quot;. Others use the Hawaiian word, &quot;makana&quot; or the Samoan term &quot;oso&quot;. Gifts of special foods unavailable outside the region visited are particularly appropriate. For example, Krispy Kreme is not available on the island of Oahu and visitors to Maui, where the only franchise is located, often return with donuts for friends and family. Conversely, locals traveling to the US mainland and abroad will take foods from Hawaii to friends and relatives where local foods are unavailable.

If someone has given you gift items or has done a service for you without asking for repayment, it is always wise and of good upbringing to at least give them something in return or offer them money. While it is common for people to play &quot;hot potato&quot; and refuse to accept the money, the important idea is that the offer was made.

Locals do not always like to feel as if they are taking and will often return the favor of giving with giving. When someone outright refuses to accept your donation, some locals will make it a personal challenge to make sure this person is repaid by slyly hiding the money in the other person&#x27;s belongings and making sure they are out of sight as to not be given anything back. In that case, it is best just to keep the form of repayment and be sure to do something special for the person the next time you see them.

==Luaus==

The indigenous Hawaiian form of luau is something seen most frequently as a tourist event, as opposed to a regular occurrence in the local culture. Some exceptions apply, such as the birthday luau or weddings. The local lu&#x27;au has evolved more into a potluck. A lu&#x27;au is always set up as a buffet. Some aspects of the lu&#x27;au, such as traditional Hawaiian foods, or roast pig cooked in an imu remain, but for local get-together are most often provided through catering services rather than individual family activities. More traditional rural families on the neighbor islands, especially Kauai, Molokai, and Hawaii, will prepare the food themselves using help from their extended families. The extended family, family friends, and neighbors will provide pupu, or appetizers, for a separate &quot;pupu line&quot;. In most cases, pupu is actually a euphemism for local delicacies that are provided in such abundance as to rival the actual main buffet line, the only difference being the absence of rice or poi, or starch, on the &quot;pupu line&quot;.

===The birthday lū’au===
Historically, the lū’au was customary for Hawai‘i&#x27;s families, regardless of ethnicity, to hold a luau to celebrate a child&#x27;s first birthday. In Polynesian cultures (and also in Korean culture), the first birthday is considered a major milestone. (See entry under &quot;for visitors from the mainland&quot; for fuller description). Although these celebrations are called lū’au, they could have an overarching theme. For example, the baby lū’au could be adorned with sports, superhero, cartoon, etc. decorations and games. Guests usually come with a birthday card and a small monetary gift for the money box. These gatherings often consist of extended family, friends, neighbors and can reach up to hundreds of attendees. Polynesian families, especially Samoans, Tongans and Maori, also commemorate 21st birthdays with lavish parties and feasts.

This is also the time when the family recognizes the grandparents, family, and friends from other islands, states, or countries, and God-parents. When it comes to godparents most cultures keep with the normality of one male and one female godparent. However for some cultures, for example, Filipinos, they will often have duplicate numbers of godparents for a single child. For some, this number reaches into the 30s or higher.

==Wedding customs==

It is a tradition for a Japanese-American bride to fold a thousand origami cranes prior to her wedding for good luck and long life. People in Hawaii add one more for good luck.

At Japanese weddings, it is customary for friends and relatives to offer &quot;banzai&quot; toasts to the bride and groom, wishing them long life.

It is customary at Hawaii weddings, especially at Filipino weddings for the bride and groom to do a &#x27;Money dance&#x27;, also called the &quot;pandango&quot;. A similar custom is observed by Samoan and Tongan newlyweds who perform a solo dance called the &quot;taualuga&quot; or &quot;tau&#x27;olunga&quot;, respectively. In all of these cases, as the bride and/or groom dance, the guests express their best wishes to the newlyweds with a monetary gift.

==Gratuities==
Hawaii is a U.S. state, so gratuities are expected in accordance with American standards. For instance, 20–25% tips are the norm in restaurants. Many workers in Hawaii are paid less than minimum wage with tips factored into their regular pay similar to the US mainland. It can be considered rude to fail to tip or under tip your host or hostess.

==For visitors from the contiguous United States==
===Semantic considerations===
* Depending on the audience, it may be deemed impolite to refer to the U.S. mainland as &quot;the States&quot; or to otherwise imply that Hawaiʻi is not part of the United States.
* It is rude to refer to the locals as &quot;natives&quot; or &quot;Hawaiians&quot;. Only ethnically Native Hawaiians should be called &quot;Hawaiians&quot;. Native Hawaiians, especially those involved in the sovereignty movement, often refer to themselves as &quot;kanaka maoli&quot; or &quot;poʻe ʻōiwi.&quot; Non-Hawaiians who were born on the islands are generally referred to as &quot;locals&quot; to distinguish them from ethnic Hawaiians. Print media and local residents recommend that one refer to non-Hawaiians as &quot;locals of Hawaii&quot; or &quot;people of Hawaii&quot;. In daily speech, few people use these words generally referring to themselves in passing as &quot;from Hawaii&quot;. The term kamaʻāina is also used for locals of any ethnicity, particularly by businesses that offer local resident discounts. Never will someone who was born and raised in Hawaii but is not of full or part-native Hawaiian ethnicity ever refer to themselves as native Hawaiian or even Hawaiian. They will simply name their actual ethnicity. Most people in Hawaii are of mixed ethnicity.
* Unless fluent, one should not attempt to speak &quot;pidgin&quot; English. The pidgin used varies greatly by location with true forms following the grammatical rules of Hawaiian. Vocabulary will include heavy Hawaiian, Japanese, Filipino, and Portuguese influences. Some locals believe that if a non-local attempts to speak pidgin, it is equivalent to trying to speak with any other regional U.S. accent, thus mocking their way of speaking. Also, it is offensive to assume that a Hawaii resident can only speak/comprehend pidgin and cannot speak/comprehend Standard English.
* If you are living or visiting on Oʻahu, do not refer to the other Hawaiian islands as &quot;outer&quot; islands. Locals typically refer to them as the &quot;neighbor&quot; islands.
* If you are white, it is not uncommon to be referred to as &quot;haole&quot;. Sometimes erroneously spelt &quot;hāʻole&quot;, the word is never actually said this way. In one of its earliest uses, the word haole is used to describe something of an observation of human migration made prior to Western contact. The term is usually used for &quot;mainlanders&quot; in general. As with other languages, you can make general distinctions by the tone of voice used. Thus, &quot;howzit, haole boy?&quot; has a different connotation than &quot;eh, stupid haole.&quot; For many whites living in Hawaiʻi, being called haole is in fact taken as offensive, so just like many other racially charged terms, it is no longer considered politically correct to use the term. 
* People of Portuguese descent may be offended if you refer to them as &quot;haole&quot;, even though they themselves are Caucasian. The Portuguese have a long history in Hawaii and share a common labor history with Chinese, Filipino, and people from other non-Caucasian backgrounds. Many Portuguese people in Hawaiʻi behave in the local custom and embody local values than those of other Caucasian descent; Portuguese influence is prominent in the fusion cuisine and pidgin communication of Hawaiʻi. At the same time, however, one should not assume that every white person who &quot;acts local&quot; is Portuguese.

===Getting around===
* If you are a visitor using public buses expect to wait for all of the local residents to board before you do. Many locals typically use public transportation to get to work, so tourists with daily bus fares are requested to, but not required to, wait for the next available open bus.
* Visitors driving vehicles on the islands are expected to honor signs which designate certain public roads as &quot;local traffic only&quot;. These rules are enforced in order to protect local residents from dealing with extra traffic in their neighborhoods. Business areas would always be the exception to this.

===Beaches===
* There are many public beaches on the islands, but parking spaces may be limited in the &quot;beach access lots&quot;. Since these &quot;beach access&quot; areas were initiated by state and local laws so that locals could regain access to beaches where they were denied access to in areas of heavy hotel/tourist development; it is appreciated when visitors leave these free limited parking spaces for the locals to use. Most hotels will allow day use parking for a fee.
* If you are coming to the Islands to surf it is best to ask the locals which beaches allow outsiders. In the most popular surfing areas, it takes many years to be accepted and forcing your way will usually be met with resistance from local surfers.

===Environmental responsibility===
*Always &quot;mālama ka āina&quot; or in other words, take care of the land. Respect the local beaches and land by cleaning up your &quot;ʻōpala&quot; (trash) and take care to not upset any native species such as the Hawaiian green sea turtles, monk seals, and coral reefs. It is best to make sure all who visit can enjoy the natural resources. Visitors wishing to acquire shells, rocks and other mementos can usually find them for sale at many roadside stands, thus contributing to the local economy. When visiting the Big Island, it is important to not take any black sand or lava rock, as it is said to anger Pele, the Hawaiian fire goddess.

<text>Allan Whitenack Snyder (born 1942) is the director of the Centre for the Mind at the University of Sydney, Australia where he also holds the 150th Anniversary Chair of Science and the Mind. He is a co-founder of Emotiv Systems and winner of the International Australia Prize in 1997 and the Marconi Prize in 2001 for his contributions to optical physics. Snyder is also the Creator and Chairman of the &quot;What Makes a Champion?&quot; forum, an official Olympic cultural event first held at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. He is also the Chair of Research on the MindChamps World Research, Advisory and Education Team, with a focus on neuroscience.

Snyder&#x27;s research career began in optical physics. More recently, he has worked on mind sciences. He has appeared on television demonstrating how transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left temporal lobe can induce savant-like skills.

==Savant hypothesis==
Snyder is interested in understanding savants. In savants, according to Snyder, the top layer of mental processing—conceptual thinking, making logical deductions—is somehow deactivated. His working hypothesis is that once this layer is inactivated, there is a capacity for recalling the minute detail or for performing lightning-quick calculations. He believes it may be possible someday to create technologies that will allow any non-autistic person to access these abilities.

==Awards==
He won the Harrie Massey Medal and Prize in 1996.

In December 2001 he received the Marconi Prize in New York City.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1990 and is the recipient of their 2001 Clifford Paterson Prize.

Previously, he was a Guggenheim Fellow at Yale University’s School of Medicine and a Royal Society Research Fellow at the Physiology Laboratories of Cambridge University. He is a graduate of Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University College London.

== Education ==
Snyder has a DSc from the University of London, a PhD from University College (1969), London, an MS from Harvard University (1967), an SM from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1965) and a BS in Electrical Engineering from Pennsylvania State University (1963), University Park.

==Centre for the Mind==
The Centre for the Mind is the brainchild of Allan Snyder, and was launched at the Museum of Sydney on 4 August 1997; Oliver Sacks delivered the Foundation Lecture on &quot;Creativity and the Mind&quot; at the public opening on 5 August 1997, at the Australian Academy of Science.

The inaugural Centre for the Mind board members were:

*Allan Snyder
*Gavin Brown
*Peter Karmel
*Lachlan Murdoch
*Baz Luhrmann

Distinguished Medal recipients:

* Daniel Dennett
* Horace Barlow
* Vilayanur Ramachandran
* Richard Branson

===Mission===
&quot;We explore what it is to be uniquely human. We do this by investing in challenging research, by orchestrating spectacular intellectual events, and by acting as a global nexus for great minds. Our mind laboratories focus on scientific ways to enhance creativity and to instill the champion mindset.&quot;

<text>In an economy, production, consumption and exchange are carried out by three basic economic units: the firm, the household, and the government.

# Firms
#: Firms make production decisions. These include what goods to produce, how these goods are to be produced and what prices to charge. They employ the various factors of production and they sell the finished goods to the households for consumption and to the government.
# Households
#: Households make consumption decisions and own factors of production. They provide firms with factor services in production, and buy finished goods from firms for consumption.
# Government
#: The government collects taxes from households, buys goods from firms, and distributes those goods to households individually or collectively. It also redistributes purchasing power between households.

<doc id="724638" wikidata="Q2017341" url="?curid=724638" title="Oklahoma City Blazers (1992–2009)">
<text>The Oklahoma City Blazers were a professional ice hockey team based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, that played in the Central Hockey League. The Blazers played at the Myriad Convention center (later renamed the Cox Convention Center and later leased by Oklahoma city to Prairie_Surf_Studios), which was located in downtown Oklahoma City. On July 2, 2009, the Blazers ceased operations after failing to reach a lease agreement with the city.

From 2010 to 2015, the market was served by the Oklahoma City Barons, an American Hockey League team playing at Cox Convention Center as the top affiliate of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Edmonton Oilers.

==History==
In 1992, a new Central Hockey League began play in the same territory as the older league. It also acquired several team names in tribute to the former CHL, including the Oklahoma City Blazers. The new Blazers began play in the Myriad Convention Center, the same home arena as the old team.

They averaged 9,128 fans per game over 17 seasons. The franchise led the CHL in attendance in each of its 17 seasons in the league. On the ice, the Blazers excelled as well, winning nine regular season division championships (including seven straight from 1996 to 2003), five regular season points titles, and CHL championships in 1996 and 2001. The franchise&#x27;s two greatest stars, Joe Burton and Hardy Sauter, are the CHL&#x27;s first and third all-time career leading scorers.

In 2002, the Blazers changed their home venue to the new Ford Center.

In 2009, the Blazers withdrew their application for a lease extension with the Ford Center and ceased operations. It was reported at the time that city officials were in negotiations with the American Hockey League for an expansion franchise. Following months of speculation, Oklahoma City was granted an AHL franchise on February 10, 2010, when the NHL&#x27;s Edmonton Oilers reactivated their dormant affiliate and created the Oklahoma City Barons. They began play in the 2010–11 season in the smaller Cox Convention Center (formerly the Myriad) and the team was operated by the former owner of the Blazers, Bob Funk.

John Brooks, the radio play-by-play voice for the University of Oklahoma football and men&#x27;s basketball teams from 1978 to 1991 and of the original Blazers hockey team, was the on-air play-by-play voice of the relaunched Blazers, however he would split the play-by-play duties with then Oklahoma City 89ers voice Brian Barnhart for the 1992-93 season only before becoming the full-time play-by-play voice of the team in the 1993-94 season. Brooks semi-retired from the Blazers after 2004–05 season after 27 seasons in total for both franchises. Brooks was inducted into the Blazers Hall of Fame on March 11, 2005. After 2004–05 season, Brooks was succeeded by Jim Byers who was the then play-by-play voice for the Oklahoma Redhawks and the occasional substitute play-by-play voice of the Blazers in place of Brooks for several years when Brooks was unavailable or handling the play-by-play duties for televised Blazer games. Jim Byers also served as a linesman in then revived Central Hockey League from 1992-1995. Following his semi-retirement from full-time play-by-play, Brooks would return to call a few games and playoffs in the following seasons when Jim Byers was handing the play-by-play duties (In a bit of a so-called swap or role reverse with Brooks as was in years prior.) when select Blazers games against the Tulsa Oilers were televised via Cox Cable Oklahoma channel 7 (Simulcasted on Cox Cable Oklahoma channel 3 in Tulsa.) or was unavailable due to the start of the Oklahoma RedHawks seasons.

<doc id="724644" wikidata="Q622" url="?curid=724644" title="Ludwigsburg">
<text>Ludwigsburg (; Swabian: &quot;Ludisburg&quot;) is a city in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, about north of Stuttgart city centre, near the river Neckar. It is the largest and primary city of the Ludwigsburg district with about 94,000 inhabitants. It is situated within the Stuttgart Region, and the district is part of the administrative region (&quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot;) of Stuttgart.
==History==
The middle of Neckarland, where Ludwigsburg lies, was settled in the Stone and Bronze Ages. Numerous archaeological sites from the Hallstatt period remain in the city and surrounding area.

Towards the end of the 1st century, the area was occupied by the Romans. They pushed the Limes further to the east around 150 and controlled the region until 260, when the Alamanni occupied the Neckarland. Evidence of the Alamanni settlement can be found in grave sites in the city today.


The origins of Ludwigsburg date from the beginning of the 18th century (1718–1723) when the largest baroque castle in Germany, Ludwigsburg Palace was built by Duke Eberhard Ludwig von Württemberg. Originally, the Duke planned to just build one country home (albeit a palace), which he began building in 1704. However, the examples of other princes fostered a desire to project his absolutist power by establishing a city. To the baroque palace, he added a hunting lodge and country seat, called Schloss Favorite (1713–1728), and the &quot;Seeschloss&quot; (castle on the lake) &quot;Monrepos&quot; (1764–1768).

A settlement began near the palace in 1709 and a town charter was granted on 3 April 1718. That same year, Ludwigsburg became a bailiff&#x27;s seat, which eventually became the rural district of Ludwigsburg in 1938.

In the years between 1730 and 1800, the royal seat of residence changed back and forth several times between Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg. In 1800, Württemberg was occupied by France under Napoleon Bonaparte and was forced into an alliance. In 1806, the &quot;Kurfürst&quot; (Prince-Elector) Friedrich was made king of Württemberg by Napoleon. In 1812, the Württembergish army was raised in Ludwigsburg for Napoleon&#x27;s Russian campaign. Of the 15,800 Württemberg soldiers who served, just a few hundred returned.

In 1921, Ludwigsburg became the largest garrison in southwest Germany. In 1945, Ludwigsburg was made a &quot;Kreisstadt&quot; (urban district), and later, when the Baden-Württemberg municipal code took effect on 1 April 1956, the city was named a major urban district. In 1956 the tradition of the German garrison town was taken up again by the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;, Germany&#x27;s federal armed forces.

2004 was the 300th birthday of &quot;Residenzschloss&quot; Ludwigsburg, celebrated by the opening of the Baroque Gallery and the Ceramic Museum in the &quot;Residenzschloss&quot;.

===Founding===
The area around Ludwigsburg had been a favored hunting grounds by the royal Württemberg family for generations before the founding of Ludwigsburg. Although the region was wilderness, it was easily accessible by boat using the Neckar River. In 1704 the founder of Ludwigsburg, Eberhard Louis, Duke of Württemberg, arranged for the laying of the foundation stone for Ludwigsburg Palace. Ludwigsburg is named after the Duke Eberhard Louis&#x27; middle name, Ludwig being the German name for Louis. Right up until his death, construction workers and craftsmen worked on what was to become one of the largest Baroque palace ensembles in Europe. Under Eberhard Louis and his successor, Charles Eugene, the Palace served as the royal residence of Württemberg for a total of 28 years. With the Palace as their &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; (translated literally, &quot;collective work of art&quot;) and the opulent festivals they organized, the Dukes put their unbounded power on display with no consideration for the finances of Württemberg. To them, their most important task was to bring fame and renown to the court of Württemberg and to compete with and outdo other European rulers in this regard.

Duke Eberhard Louis planned to found an ideal Baroque city right beside Ludwigsburg Palace. From 1709 onwards, he tried to attract new residents to the city with a series of incentives: first he promised free plots of land and free building materials as well as fifteen years tax-free status, and later on he added freedom to practice one&#x27;s profession and religion to the list. However, the town only began to grow when it was granted city status in 1718 and then in that year became the royal residence and capital city of the country of Württemberg. By the time of Eberhard Louis&#x27; death in 1733, the population had risen to around 6,000 people, which was more than half as big as the former capital city Stuttgart. Nevertheless, the new capital city Ludwigsburg was still a major construction site with many unpaved streets and half-finished buildings.

For over two decades, Eberhard Louis (1676–1733) held court in Ludwigsburg with his mistress Wilhilmine von Grävenitz (1684–1744) while the Duchess Johanna Elisabeth (1680–1757) remained in Stuttgart. The clever, ambitious mistress made the best of her time, influencing politics in Württemberg and advancing her status in society. When it became clear that the seriously ill heir to the throne would not come to power, Eberhard Louis had a change of heart, split with his lover and reconciled with his wife in the hope that he would have another son. This was cause for great joy for many people in Württemberg, as the Protestant population feared that power would fall into the hands of the Catholic side of the royal house. To mark reconciliation, the Ludwigsburg citizenry published a leaflet with a copper etching that made reference to the general wish for a new heir to the throne. The etching depicts the personification of Ludwigsburg who is receiving a pearl, a symbol of fertility, from the hand of God. However, people&#x27;s hopes for another child were not fulfilled as Eberhard Louis died in 1733 and his Catholic cousin, Charles Alexander, Duke of Württemberg, ascended to the throne. When Charles Alexander immediately moved the capital of Württemberg back to Stuttgart, the population of the Ludwigsburg suddenly dropped by more than half within a year.

===Jews and World War II===
Jewish families began living in Ludwigsburg during the 19th century and in 1884, a synagogue was built on Solitudestraße. The synagogue was later destroyed by storm troopers during Kristallnacht, the pogrom of November 1938. In 1988, the perimeter of the structure was marked out in plaster on the site. A 1959 memorial and newer memorial plaques commemorate the Jewish Holocaust victims and extol human rights.

In 1940, a Nazi propaganda film, &quot;Jud Süß&quot;, was filmed in Ludwigsburg. The film was based on a historical figure, Joseph Süß Oppenheimer, who was executed in Stuttgart in 1738; Oppenheimer lived in Ludwigsburg.

During World War II, the city suffered moderate damage compared to other German cities. There were 1500 deaths.
It was the home of the prisoner-of-war camp Stalag V-A from October 1939 till April 1945. After the war, there was a large displaced persons camp which housed several thousand mainly Polish displaced persons until about 1948. After 1945 until the middle of 1946, there was also an allied internment camp for war criminals in Ludwigsburg and the U.S. Army maintained the Pattonville barracks on the edge of town, large enough to have its own American high school. The land was returned to Germany in 1994.

On 27 September 2008, the first 12 Stolpersteine were laid in Ludwigsburg. They are part of a project by artist Gunter Demnig to memorialize individuals who perished under Nazi persecution. Demnig was back in Ludwigsburg on 7 October 2009 to install more Stolpersteine.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of Ludwigsburg depicts a black eagle on a golden banner flying on an oblique red lance, on a blue background. Duke Eberhard Louis, Duke of Württemberg awarded Ludwigsburg its coat of arms on 3 September 1718 as a Reichssturmfahne, which had been part of the Duchy of Württemberg&#x27;s own coat of arms since 1495. There were some minor changes made to the design, as it had already been associated with the town of Markgröningen. A missive from the office of the mayor of Ludwigsburg in 1759–60 mentions its flag.

==People==
Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg, enrolled the young Friedrich Schiller in the Karlsschule Stuttgart (an elite military academy he had founded) in 1773, where Schiller eventually studied medicine. The Duke was very demanding of his students, and Schiller&#x27;s childhood was a lonely and unhappy one, but he was greatly enriched by the excellent education he received. It was there that he wrote his first play, &quot;Die Räuber&quot; (&quot;The Robbers&quot;), about a group of naïve revolutionaries and their tragic failure.

Leopold Mozart visited Württemberg with his son, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in July 1763 and said, &quot;Ludwigsburg is a very special town.&quot;

<text>Steven Robert Guttenberg (born August 24, 1958) is an American actor, author, businessman, producer, and director. He is known for playing Carey Mahoney in the &quot;Police Academy&quot; films from 1984 to 1987. He also acted in &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; (1987) and its 1990 sequel as well as the films &quot;Diner&quot; (1982), &quot;Cocoon&quot; (1985), &quot;Short Circuit&quot; (1986), &quot;The Bedroom Window&quot; (1987), &quot;The Big Green&quot; (1995) and &quot;A Novel Romance&quot; (2011).

On television, he started his career in the CBS sitcom &quot;Billy&quot; (1979). He has had recurring guest roles as Woody Goodman in the teen mystery series &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; (2005–2006), Wayne Hastings, Jr. in the HBO dramedy series &quot;Ballers&quot; (2017), and Dr. Katman in the ABC sitcom &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; (2017–2023). He was a contestant during season 6 of the dance competition series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; (2008).

==Early life and education ==
Guttenberg was born on August 24, 1958 in Brooklyn, New York. He is the only son (he has his two sisters) of Ann Iris (née Newman), a surgical assistant, and Jerome Stanley Guttenberg, an electrical engineer. Stanley served in the Army&#x27;s 82nd Airborne Division and was an Army Ranger. His godfather is actor Michael Bell. Steve had a Jewish upbringing in the Flushing neighborhood of the borough of Queens. In 1976, he graduated from Plainedge High School after his family moved from Queens to North Massapequa. While still in high school, Guttenberg attended a summer program at the Juilliard School and studied under John Houseman. During that time, he auditioned for and won a part in an off-Broadway production of &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;.

After high school, Guttenberg attended the University at Albany, SUNY for a year. When he left SUNY, Guttenberg moved to California to pursue an acting career. His parents gave him $300 and said he has two weeks to find a job. Within two weeks, he was cast in a Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial playing opposite Colonel Sanders.

==Career==

=== 1977–1984: Early roles to breakthrough ===
After playing an uncredited bit part in the suspense film &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;, Guttenberg had his first screen credit in the TV movie &quot;Something for Joey&quot; (1977). Next he played the starring role in the 1977 high school comedy &quot;The Chicken Chronicles&quot;, set in Beverly Hills in 1969. He appeared in the 1978 film &quot;The Boys From Brazil&quot;, based on the Ira Levin bestseller, and guest-starred on &quot;Family&quot;.

Guttenberg starred in the short-lived TV series &quot;Billy&quot; (1979), based on &quot;Billy Liar&quot;. He had a supporting role in a tennis romance film &quot;Players&quot; (1979). In 1980, a Coca-Cola commercial featured him trying to help a non-English-speaking woman fix a flat bicycle tire. He starred in the TV movie &quot;To Race the Wind&quot; (1980) playing blind lawyer Harold Krents. In the same year, he starred in the Nancy Walker-directed &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot;, a semi-autobiographical movie about the disco group Village People. Guttenberg played Jim Craig in the TV movie &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; (1981). He appeared in Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Diner&quot; (1982) and starred in another short-lived TV series &quot;No Soap, Radio&quot; (1982). Guttenberg starred in the action-comedy &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; (1983) and had a supporting part in the post-apocalyptic television movie &quot;The Day After&quot; (1983). He starred in &quot;The Ferret&quot; (1984) a pilot for a TV series which was not picked up.

In 1984, Guttenberg played the lead role in &quot;Police Academy&quot;. It grossed $8.5 million in its opening weekend and over $149 million worldwide, against a budget of $4.5 million; it is the most successful movie in the film franchise which it launched. He became a busy star over the next four years, appearing in nine starring roles, tying with Gene Hackman for busiest actor.

=== 1985–1999: Subsequent success ===
In 1985, &quot;Police Academy&quot; was quickly followed by a sequel, &quot;Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment&quot;. Guttenberg then had the romantic male lead in &quot;Cocoon&quot;, another box-office success. A comedy in which he starred, &quot;Bad Medicine&quot;, was not particularly successful.

In 1986, Guttenberg played Pecos Bill in an episode of &quot;Tall Tales &amp; Legends&quot;, then was in &quot;Police Academy 3: Back in Training&quot;. Also in 1986, he starred in &quot;Short Circuit&quot; opposite Ally Sheedy, another very popular film. In 1987, Guttenberg changed pace acting in the thriller &quot;The Bedroom Window&quot; , directed by Curtis Hanson. Guttenberg then made &quot;Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol&quot;, his last &quot;Police Academy&quot; Film. He had a cameo in &quot;Amazon Women on the Moon&quot; and supported Michael Caine and Sally Field in &quot;Surrender&quot;. Guttenberg had the biggest financial success of his career to date with &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; with Tom Selleck and Ted Danson. In 1988, Guttenberg starred with Peter O&#x27;Toole and Daryl Hannah in &quot;High Spirits&quot;, which flopped. In 1989, Guttenberg appeared in the Michael Jackson music video &quot;Liberian Girl&quot;. Guttenberg also acted in &quot;&quot; which was a commercial disappointment. 

In 1990, he replaced Timothy Hutton in the lead role of &quot;Prelude to a Kiss&quot; at the Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway. He also performed in London&#x27;s West End, where he starred in &quot;The Boys Next Door&quot;. He appeared in the world stage premiere production of &quot;Furthest From the Sun&quot;, which Woody Harrelson directed and co-authored. In films, Guttenberg acted in &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Her It&#x27;s Me&quot; and &quot;Three Men and a Little Lady&quot;. He directed &quot;Love Off Limits&quot; for &quot;CBS Schoolbreak Special&quot; in 1993. In 1995, he acted in &quot;The Big Green&quot;. He was among the ensemble in &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot;, and starred in &quot;It Takes Two&quot; with Kirstie Alley and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.

In 1997, Guttenberg starred in &quot;Zeus and Roxanne&quot;, &quot;&quot; and alongside Kirsten Dunst in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Tower of Terror&quot;, based on the attraction at Disney World. In 1998, he acted in action films, &quot;Airborne&quot;, and &quot;Overdrive&quot;, as well as the comedy &quot;Home Team&quot;. 

=== 2000–2009 ===
His first film as director/producer/co-screenwriter/star was &quot;P.S. Your Cat Is Dead&quot; (2002), a film adaptation of a novel and Broadway play by James Kirkwood, Jr. Guttenberg starred in &quot;Mojave Phone Booth&quot; (2006) as Barry, and &quot;Making Change&quot; as Trafton. In &quot;Single Santa Seeks Mrs. Claus&quot; and then its sequel &quot;Meet the Santas&quot;, he played the starring role of Nick. He had a recurring role in the 2005–2006 season of the television series &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; as Woody Goodman, a wealthy businessman and community leader. He appeared as a lead in the NBC made-for-TV remake of &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (2005), playing Richard Clarke, a failing writer having an affair with a massage therapist. He guest-starred in a 2007 episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;. He appeared in an &quot;According to Jim&quot; episode, &quot;Two for the Money&quot;, in 2008. In the same year, Guttenberg released a video titled &quot;Steve Guttenberg&#x27;s Steak House&quot; on Will Ferrell&#x27;s Funny or Die website. Guttenberg joined the 2008 spring season dancing on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; with professional dancer Anna Trebunskaya, and was eliminated on April 1.

A video which appeared to show Guttenberg jogging nearly naked through Central Park in New York City was released online in 2008. During an interview on the British talk show &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;, Guttenberg said that he made the video for Will Ferrell&#x27;s Funny or Die website, but then decided to release it virally &quot;as if it were real&quot; as part of a challenge for the show. Guttenberg became the Guinness World Record Holder for preparing the most hot-dogs in one minute.

Guttenberg starred in the &quot;Cinderella&quot; pantomime at Churchill Theatre in Bromley (Greater London), playing the Baron (father of Cinderella) in 2008. Celebrating his involvement, the local Empire Cinema screened &quot;Police Academy&quot; on November 19. He introduced the film and answered questions.

=== 2010–present===
Guttenberg played himself in a 2010 episode of the Starz comedy &quot;Party Down&quot;. He appeared on Broadway from late 2011 to early 2012 in Woody Allen&#x27;s one-act play &quot;Honeymoon Hotel&quot;, which was part of the show &quot;Relatively Speaking&quot;. Guttenberg was on History Channel&#x27;s 2015 miniseries &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; playing Jack Bonner. In 2015, he was on SyFy Channel&#x27;s &quot;Lavalantula&quot; and was featured in an episode of &quot;Community&quot;, &quot;Intro to Recycled Cinema&quot;, which aired on &quot;Yahoo Screen&quot;. In 2020, he appeared on &quot;Holey Moley II: The Sequel&quot;. He also starred in the Lifetime film &quot;How to Murder Your Husband: The Nancy Brophy Story&quot; where he portrayed Daniel Brophy.

== Rumored projects ==
In a 2009 interview, Guttenberg mentioned that Disney was developing a second sequel to &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot;, entitled &quot;Three Men and a Bride&quot;. He said that his co-stars, Ted Danson and Tom Selleck, would return for the sequel. Guttenberg expressed his interest in making additional sequels to the &quot;Police Academy&quot; and &quot;Cocoon&quot; movies, saying they would be surefire hits if they were to be made. In 2010, he revealed that David Diamond and David Weissman were writing a script for &quot;Police Academy 8&quot;. In 2018, Guttenberg said that a new &quot;Police Academy&quot; film is packaged but had no other details.

== Production company ==
Guttenberg&#x27;s production company, Mr. Kirby Productions, is named after Gerald J. Kirby, his high-school drama teacher.

In 1995, Guttenberg was name-checked in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homer the Great&quot; in the song &quot;We Do&quot;, whereby a fictional ancient secret society called the Stonecutters (a parody of the Freemasons) claim it was them that made Guttenberg a star. He was reportedly flattered by the reference. 

== Personal life ==
=== Marriage and relationships ===
Guttenberg married model Denise Bixler on September 30, 1988. They separated in June 1991 and divorced in 1992. Guttenberg has lived with WCBS-TV reporter Emily Smith since 2014. They were engaged on Christmas Day 2016 and married on January 19, 2019.

===Los Angeles wildfire rescue efforts===
On January 8, 2025, Guttenberg was among the various citizens who have been volunteering their time helping first responders as devastating wildfires raged across the Los Angeles area of Southern California. Guttenberg even went unnoticed by the local media when interviewed. “This is the time for us to remember that we&#x27;re part of a community&quot; Guttenberg said and that people “have to help each other and be kind to each other. If you see somebody who needs help, help them. Ask them what they need.” In an interview with CNN, Guttenberg said that he hadn&#x27;t “seen anything like this in my entire life, and I don’t think many people have.” 

Guttenberg also discussed helping to rescue pets belonging to a neighbor who happened to be out of town as the fires raged. At least five people had died and more than 1000 structures have been destroyed, and more than 100,000 people, including various celebrities, have evacuated their homes in what has become the most destructive in Los Angeles&#x27; history.

==Philanthropy==
Guttenberg is involved with charities whose goal is to improve opportunities for the homeless and for young people. In 2016, a trust in his honor was established to provide support services to the homeless population of Los Angeles. The Entertainment Industry Foundation, Hollywood&#x27;s charity arm, selected Guttenberg to be Ambassador for Children&#x27;s Issues for his work on behalf of children and the homeless. At the 2016 New York Walk to Fight Lymphedema &amp; Lymphatic Diseases in Brooklyn, Guttenberg announced, via a pre-recorded message, that he had joined the Lymphatic Education &amp; Research Network&#x27;s (LE&amp;RN) Honorary Board.

== Acting credits and accolades ==

The sixth Fire Island Golden Wagon Film Festival held annually, honored Guttenberg with the 2008 Tony Randall Lifetime Achievement Award for his work in the entertainment industry, as well as his community service. The award was created in tribute to the first Golden Wagon honoree, Tony Randall; it is given to a member of the entertainment industry who embodies the same love of Fire Island, independent spirit, and community service which Randall shared.

Guttenberg received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011. In 2014, he received a key to the city from Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine for his work with Fun Paw Care, raising awareness for animal rights.

<text>Free education is education funded through government spending or charitable organizations rather than tuition funding. Primary school and other comprehensive or compulsory education is free in most countries (often not including primary textbook). Tertiary education is also free in certain countries, including post-graduate studies in the Nordic countries. 

The Article 13 of International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ensures the right to free education at primary education and progressive introduction of it at secondary and higher education as the right to education.

== Free education as a human right ==
Free education--at various levels--has been guaranteed by both domestic constitutions and in international human rights treaties.

The cost of education first became a subject of international law following World War I, although only for certain countries and only in limited situations. The &quot;Minority Treaties&quot; guaranteed racial, religious, and linguistic minorities in specific European countries an equal right with other nationals to establish schools at their own expense, but where such groups formed a considerable proportion of the population, they were assured of an equitable share of public educational funds, as well as instruction in their languages in public primary schools.

In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declared that everyone has a right to education, and that education &quot;shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages.&quot;

In the first treaty dedicated to education--the 1960 Convention against Discrimination in Education-- states undertake to &quot;make primary education free and compulsory; make secondary education in its different forms generally available and accessible to all; [and] make higher education equally accessible to all on the basis of individual capacity.&quot;

Under the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, countries recognize &quot;the right of everyone to education,&quot; and that &quot;primary education shall be compulsory and available free to all;&quot; secondary education, including technical and vocational education, &quot;shall be made generally available and accessible to all by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education;&quot; and that &quot;higher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education.&quot; Countries undertake to &quot;achieve progressively the full realization&quot; of this right by all appropriate means and &quot;to the maximum&quot; of available resources.

The 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child states that countries &quot;recognize the right of the child to education&quot; and that they &quot;shall, in particular … (a) Make primary education compulsory and available free to all; (b) Encourage the development of different forms of secondary education, including general and vocational education, make them available and accessible to every child, and take appropriate measures such as the introduction of free education and offering financial assistance in case of need; [and] (c) Make higher education accessible to all on the basis of capacity by every appropriate means.&quot;

In June 2024, the UN&#x27;s Human Rights Council approved the establishment of a working group with the mandate of &quot;exploring the possibility of, elaborating and submitting to the Human Rights Council a draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child with the aim to: ... Explicitly state that, with a view to achieving the right to education, States shall: (i) Make public pre-primary education available free to all, beginning with at least one year; (ii) Make public secondary education available free to all.&quot;

==Countries==
State universities in the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Norway, Saudi Arabia and Sweden do not charge international students with tuition fees for Ph.D. degrees and in some cases for bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees as well.



In Argentina, education is free since 1949 in every state university, not only for Argentine students, but also for international students willing to study in Argentina. Free education is financed by the Ministry of Education.

In Bangladesh, article 17 of Constitution of Bangladesh provides that all children receive free and compulsory education. Primary and secondary education is financed by the state and free of charge in public schools. The government provides free textbooks to all primary and secondary-level students. In 2022, 347,016,277 free textbooks have been distributed among 41,726,856 students across the country. The government provides free school meals to 400,000 children in 2,000 schools across 8 Divisions.

In Brazil, free education is offered by the Ministry of Education, which offers scholarships for graduate degrees, masters, doctoral and post-doctoral for Brazilians and immigrants with a Brazilian citizenship. The best universities and research centers are public institutions, financed by either the local state (state universities) or the federal government (federal universities). Graduate students can get paid if they qualify for the incentive, but competition usually are extremely fierce. 

There are examples of steps towards free education being taken across the world primarily in those nations developing rapidly, such as China. The Free Compulsory Education Reform in China can be described as a program akin to a school subsidy initiative, wherein qualifying students receive financial assistance that encompasses tuition fees and other associated expenses.

Denmark has universal free education, and provides a monthly stipend, the &quot;Statens Uddannelsesstøtte&quot; or &quot;SU&quot;, to students over 18 years of age or students who are under 18 and attending a higher education. Bachelor and master&#x27;s degree programmes in Denmark are offered in either Danish or English depending on the programme or university. 

From 2013, Estonia started providing free higher education. 

In European Union countries such as France and Malta, tuition is usually free for European students, and in Germany, tuition is free for all European and international students. In Scotland, university tuition is free for all Scottish nationals and is discounted for all European students, except from students coming from other parts of the United Kingdom.

In Fiji the government announced in 2013 it would cover the costs of primary and secondary school education, equivalent to 250 Fiji dollars per year per student.

In Iran, most prestigious universities are called governmental universities which offer free education for students who pass a very competitive entrance exam with high scores. Graduates from these universities are obliged to serve the country for as many years as they studied for their degree, in order to get their diploma.

In Mauritius, the government provides free education to its citizens from pre-primary to tertiary levels. Since July 2005, the government also introduced free transport for all students.

In New Zealand, the Labour government will introduce three years of free post-school study or training. From January 1, 2018, new students will have one year free for entering study or training. From 2021, those starting tertiary education would get two years free, and from 2024 three years. The overall cost of the package is $6 billion. Labour has also pledged to increase student allowances by $50 a week, and to restore post-graduate students&#x27; eligibility for student allowances.

In Norway, at the University of Oslo, there is no tuition fee except a small semester fee of NOK(600) (US$74).

In the Philippines, public primary and secondary schools are free of tuition. The 1935 Constitution provided for universal primary education. Primary education was made free under the 1973 Constitution, while the 1987 Constitution extended free education to the secondary level. Free public tertiary education has been enacted in 2017.

In Russia, prior to the break-up of the Soviet Union, tuition was free for everyone obtaining sufficient grades. Since 1991, students obtaining sufficient grades, are still eligible for a free education (on a competitive basis) in state or private universities, but the student can also pay for studying if grades are above minimal threshold, but not enough to be enrolled into the desired university for free.

In Sri Lanka, free education is provided by the government at different levels. Government funded schools such as national schools, provincial schools and Piriven provide primary and secondary education free, while assisted schools and semi-governmental schools provide the same at subsidized rates. At the university level, the universities provide undergraduate courses free, however, this totals only about 10% for those qualified for university entrance. Grants and scholarships are provided for a limited number of study allowances. Dr. C. W. W. Kannangara who was the Minister of Education made education free for all Sri Lankan students in 1940 s. Kannangara&#x27;s significant achievements in areas of education have led him to being commonly referred to as the &quot;Father of Free Education&quot; in Sri Lanka.

Sweden, until the early 21st century, provided free education to foreign students but changes have been introduced to charge fees to foreign students from outside the European community. 

Trinidad and Tobago offers free tertiary education to its citizens up to the undergraduate level at accredited public and select private institutions. Postgraduate degrees are paid up to 50% by the government at accredited institutions. This benefit is given to the citizens under a programme called Government Assisted Tuition Expenses Programme and it is managed by the Funding and Grants Administration Division of the Ministry of Tertiary Education and Skills Training

In the United States, a variety of financial aid programs provide grants and student loans, mostly to low-income students, for any accredited college or university. Various proposals at the state and federal level have been made to make either community colleges or all colleges and universities free for students at all income levels. In March 2022, the U.S. state of New Mexico waived tuition for in-state students at all income levels and at all public state and tribal colleges and universities, if registered for six credit-hours and earning a minimum 2.5 GPA.

Uruguay adopted free, compulsory, and secular education in 1876, after a reform led by José Pedro Varela during the Lorenzo Latorre dictatorship. The University of the Republic follows the same principles, although graduates must pay a yearly contribution.

In Tanzania, a fee free education was introduced for all the government schools in 2014. Government would pay the fees, however parents were required to pay for the school uniform and other materials.

In Mali, free education implementation is a relatively recent phenomenon. Prior to the turn of the century, education was often too expensive for many families, leading to a high rate of illiteracy and educational inequity. The 1990s saw the beginning of reforms with several NGOs and international bodies lobbying and offering support for free and inclusive education.

==History==
In the Islamic Golden Age a tradition of free madrasa-based education arose.

Free education has long been identified with &quot;sponsored education&quot;; for example, during the Renaissance, rich dignitaries commonly sponsored the education of young men as patrons.

Thomas Jefferson proposed &quot;establishing free schools to teach reading, writing, and arithmetic, and from these schools those of intellectual ability, regardless of background or economic status, would receive a college education paid for by the state.&quot;

In the Soviet Union, Vladmir Lenin&#x27;s government instituted a number of progressive measures which included access to universal education.

In Sri Lanka, C. W. W. Kannangara introduced universal free education from kindergarten up to undergraduate degree, becoming the first country to implement free education on national scale.

In the United States, Townsend Harris founded the first free public institution of higher education, the Free Academy of the City of New York (today the City College of New York), in 1847; it aimed to provide free education to the urban poor, immigrants and their children. Its graduates went on to receive 10 Nobel Prizes, more than any other public university. During the late 19th century, the United States government introduced compulsory education as free or universal education, which extended across the country by the 1920s.
It is the oldest of CUNY&#x27;s 25 institutions of higher learning [5] and is considered its flagship. Other primacies at City College that helped shape the culture of American higher education include the first student government in the nation (Academic Senate, 1867);[9] the first national fraternity to accept members without regard to religion, race, color or creed (Delta Sigma Phi, 1899);[10] the first degree-granting evening program (School of Education, 1907). City College of New York. In 1944, U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Serviceman&#x27;s Readjustment Act, also known as the GI Bill of Rights, into law. The GI Bill allowed World War II veterans to attend universities at no cost to them.

A report regarding free higher education was prepared by President Truman in 1947, however, no action was taken, according to what was written in the report. Therefore, it never became a reality. One possible reason could be the ongoing Cold War at that time, which made President Truman shift his focus from the report to the war-defense spending.

Governments typically fund compulsory education through taxes. Aggravated truancy can be prosecuted. Homeschooling, private or parochial schooling usually offer legal alternatives.

With the start of many free internet-based learning institutions such as edX (founded in 2012) and MITx (announced in 2011), anyone in the world with Internet access can take free education-courses. In many countries, the policy for the merit system has not yet caught up with these recent advances in education technology.

After the 2011–13 Chilean student protests, tuition-free college was a major campaign promise of Chilean president Michelle Bachelet in 2013. After some years marshaling support and funding, the &quot;gratuidad&quot; law was passed in 2018, and as of 2019 covers tuition at participating schools for families in the bottom 60% of earnings nation-wide.

==On the Internet==
Online education has become an option in recent years, particularly with the development of free MOOCs (massive open online courses) from providers such as Khan Academy (High School) and Higher Education, through providers such as edX, Coursera, Udacity, FutureLearn and Alison. Free education has become available through several websites with some resembling the courses of study of accredited universities. Online education faces barriers such as institutional adoption, license or copyright restrictions, incompatibility and educator awareness of available resources.

Due to the extensive requirements of resources for online education, many open community projects have been initiated. Specifically, the Wikimedia Foundation has developed a project devoted to free online educational resources, Wikiversity, and recently, several other sites for specific topics have developed.

Christian Leaders Institute offers tuition free college level ministry education. Students can take any classes free of charge, but are encouraged to help support the mission of the institution by making donations to this 501 (c)3 United States Charity.

The Islamic Open University (IOU), a distance-learning higher education institution, offers tuition-free graduate and undergraduate degrees. A very modest registration fee is charged per semester, which is based on the human development index and thus varies from country to country. The IOU is offering one million scholarships for African youths by 2020.

Nidahas Vidyalaya has started an initiative named Freedom College towards providing tuition-free education in Sri Lanka.

==Other examples==
Free education does not only take the form of publicly funded institutions like state universities.

In France, philosopher Michel Onfray created the first non-governmental free education university since antiquity, in 2002, with his Université populaire de Caen in Normandy. His decision was triggered by the accession of far-right party Front National to the second round of the 2002 French presidential elections. Onfray stated that people need more political, historical and philosophical background education to be more conscious citizens. His university is run by an association loi 1901.

In Iran, Nasra is a movement aiming to meet the learning needs of all children, youth and adults in 2018. This social movement focuses on digital media use and mental health and increase the skills of using the media for the public.

<doc id="724653" wikidata="Q821571" url="?curid=724653" title="Walking Together">
<text>Walking Together () was a Russian youth movement that was created by Vasily Yakemenko in May 2000. The group, which had over 50 thousand members in January 2002, was strongly pro-Putin and openly endorsed by President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s administration. It had strict rules and indoctrination methods, and was openly criticized for its similarity to the Soviet Young Pioneers established by the Communist Party in 1922. The senior patron of the movement was Vladislav Surkov, the deputy head of the presidential administration. The group was transformed into &quot;Nashi&quot; (Ours) youth group in 2005 after a scandal involving the dissemination of pornography.

==Background==
Before creating &quot;Walking Together&quot;, Yakimenko was the overseer of state-run charities. The group&#x27;s first action in November 2000 was to celebrate Putin&#x27;s administration with a rally in front of the Kremlin. Group organizers cite a long history of such groups in Russia.

Many liberals in Russia feared that the organization was designed to set up a cult of personality around President Putin. Some of the groups requirements included commands to read six Russian classics a year and to visit the site of a battle where Russia was victorious. The reading of modern &quot;liberal&quot; works was discouraged by Walking Together. At one rally, members were encouraged to tear apart copies of Vladimir Sorokin&#x27;s &quot;Blue Salo&quot;, which was deemed pornographic for a passage depicting gay sex between Joseph Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev. The group brought formal charges against the author for writing pornographic literature.

==Organization==
Walking Together was sponsored by two companies with ties to the Kremlin and the Moscow city council. Members of the group were divided into groups of five called &quot;red stars&quot;, each led by a &quot;foreman&quot; who received a free pager and 1,500 rubles for his services. Each of his five &quot;soldiers&quot; received 50 rubles as well as free T-shirts. The group soon acquired the nickname the &quot;Putinjugend&quot; in the mass media since the activists usually wore T-shirts with a portrait of Putin. Groups have criticized the organization, claiming that its rallies are only popular with young people because of the free handouts. Members were encouraged to get others to join in a way that mirrors pyramid schemes. Once a member has a red star, he had to persuade another 50 members to join.

==Decline and transformation==
In 2004 the group fell into a crisis. A group member was involved in the illegal dissemination of pornographic video tapes, there were also financial disputes between the Petersburg section and the Moscow headquarters, while Sorokin fell out of favor with the Kremlin. Against this backdrop, the Kremlin created a new youth group call Nashi (Ours) in 2005.

On 30 September 1965, land proclaimed as a wildlife reserve earlier in the month was re-proclaimed as a wildlife reserve under the &quot;National Park and Wild Life Reserves Act 1891&quot;.

On 9 November 1967, the &quot;Billiatt National Park&quot; was proclaimed under the &quot;National Parks Act 1966&quot; in respect to section 26 in the Hundred of Auld and sections 15 and 18 in the Hundred of Billiatt.

On 27 April 1972, the national park was reconstituted as the &quot;Billiatt Conservation Park&quot; upon the proclamation of the &quot;National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972&quot;. Its boundaries were subsequently enlarged by the addition of the following land:
#On 11 January 1973, sections 21 and 22 in the Hundred of Billiatt were added.
#On 10 January 1980, section 13 in the Hundred of Auld and section 19 in the Hundred of Billiatt were added.
#On 3 November 1983, sections 24 to 30 in the Hundred of Billiatt were added.
#On 16 May 1985, section 27 in the Hundred of Auld, section 23 in the Hundred of Billiatt and sections 42 to 45, 48, 49 and 53 in the Hundred of Kingsford were added.
#On 28 November 1985, section 28 in the Hundred of Auld was added.
#On 24 July 2008, sections 14 and 16 in the Hundred of Billiatt and &#x27;Allotment 101 of Deposited Plan 51151&#x27; in the Hundred of Auld were added.
Also, on 24 July 2008, all of the land within the conservation park with the exception of &#x27;Allotment 101 of Deposited Plan 51151&#x27; was constituted by proclamation under the &quot;Wilderness Protection Act 1992&quot; as a wilderness protection area named as the Billiatt Wilderness Protection Area and thereby was removed from the conservation park.

In 1980, when the conservation park&#x27;s area was , it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

==Fauna==
Pygmy possums and eighteen species of reptile inhabit the park.

==Recognition by non-government organisations==
Billiatt Conservation Park is part of an area of land considered by BirdLife International to be an Important Bird Area because it contains small but globally important populations of malleefowl, mallee emu-wren and purple-gaped honeyeater, as well as the rare western whipbird and red-lored whistler.

<doc id="724693" wikidata="Q7279779" url="?curid=724693" title="Rack of lamb">
<text>A rack of lamb, also known as carré d&#x27;agneau (though this term may also refer to other cuts), is a lamb cut that is perpendicular to the spine and includes 16 ribs or chops. In retail, it is commonly sold as a &#x27;single&#x27; rack, which means it is sawn longitudinally and includes the 8 ribs on one side only. However, it may also be sold as a &quot;double rack of lamb,&quot; with ribs on both sides. Another presentation involves placing two French trimmed racks together with the ribs interlinked, which is often referred to as a &quot;guard of honour&quot;.

Rack of lamb is typically roasted, sometimes with a coating of herbed breadcrumb persillade. To enhance the presentation, the tips of the bones are occasionally decorated with paper frills known as manchettes.

==Crown roast==

Two or three single racks of lamb tied into a circle make a &quot;crown roast of lamb&quot;. Crown roasts are sometimes cooked with (ground-lamb) stuffing in the middle.

==Frenching==

Rack of lamb is often French trimmed (also known as Frenching in the United States), that is, the rib bones are exposed by cutting off the fat and meat covering them. Typically, three inches (7–8 cm) of bone beyond the main muscle (the rib eye or Longissimus dorsi) are left on the rack, with the top two inches (5 cm) exposed.

<doc id="724695" wikidata="Q529685" url="?curid=724695" title="Mirian III">
<text>Mirian III () was a king (&quot;mepe&quot;) of Iberia or Kartli (Georgia), contemporaneous to the Roman emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306–337). He was the founder of the royal Chosroid dynasty.

According to the early medieval Georgian annals and hagiography, Mirian was the first Christian king of Iberia, converted through the ministry of Nino, a Cappadocian female missionary. After Christianization of Iberia he is credited with establishment of Christianity as his kingdom&#x27;s state religion and is regarded by the Georgian Orthodox Church as saint and is canonized as Saint [[Equal to the Apostles]] King Mirian ().

Traditional chronology after Prince Vakhushti assigns to Mirian&#x27;s reign—taken to have lasted for 77 years—the dates 268–345, which Professor Cyril Toumanoff corrects to 284–361. He is also known to the contemporary Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus and the medieval Armenian chronicles.

== Name ==
&quot;Mirian&quot; is the Georgian form of the Iranian name of &quot;Mihrān&quot;. The name is transliterated in Greek as &quot;Mithranes&quot;. According to the &quot;Life of Vakhtang&quot;, his name was also associated with &quot;Mirdat&quot;, meaning &quot;given by Mithra&quot;, the name of the ancient Iranian sun god. His name is rendered as &quot;Meribanes&quot; by the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus (XXI, 6, 8). The regnal numbers as in Mirian III are modern and were not used by the medieval Georgian authors. Since two kings preceded him with that name, Mirian has been assigned the ordinal &quot;III&quot; in Georgian historiography.

== Background and accession ==
Mirian was a member of the House of Mihran, one of the Seven Great Houses of Iran. The family, based at Ray in northern Iran, traced its ancestry back to the ruling Arsacid Empire, the predecessors of the Sasanian Empire. Mirian himself was also born in Iran and was originally a Zoroastrian. In 284, the Sasanian King of Kings (&quot;shahanshah&quot;) Bahram II () secured the Iberian throne for Mirian, which laid the foundation for Mihranid rule in Iberia, which would last into the sixth century. Thus, the Chosroid dynasty of which Mirian became its first head, was a branch of the Mihranid princely family. The motive behind Bahram II&#x27;s move was to strengthen Sasanian authority in the Caucasus and utilize the position of the Iberian capital Mtskheta as an entrance to the important passes through the Caucasus Mountains. This was of so high importance to Bahram II, that he allegedly himself went to Mtskheta in order to secure Mirian&#x27;s position. He also sent one of his grandees named Mirvanoz (also a Mihranid) to the country in order to act as the guardian of Mirian, who was then merely aged seven. After Mirian&#x27;s marriage with Abeshura (daughter of the previous Iberian ruler Aspacures), 40,000 Sasanian &quot;select mounted warriors/cavalry&quot; were subsequently stationed in eastern Iberia, Caucasian Albania and Gugark. In western Iberia, 7,000 Sasanian cavalrymen were sent to Mtskheta to safeguard Mirian.

Other branches of the Mihranid family were a few decades later established on other Caucasian thrones, one of them being in Gugark, and the other in the Armeno-Albania principality of Gardman.

==Early reign==

The &quot;Life of the Kings&quot; recount Mirian&#x27;s reign in much details. While its information about Mirian&#x27;s participation—as an Iranian client king—in the Sasanid war against the Roman Empire, and territorial ambitions in Armenia can be true, the claims of Mirian&#x27;s being a pretender to the throne of Iran, his being in control of Colchis and Albania, and expansion of his activity as far as Syria is obviously fictional. Mirian inherited a kingdom that had been ruling Iberia since the 4th century BC. Iberia, like the rest of the Caucasus, was dominated by Iranian cultures and mixtures of the Zoroastrian religion. Indeed, according to the modern historian Stephen H. Rapp, the Caucasus was part of the &quot;Iranian Commonwealth&quot;, &quot;a massive cross-cultural enterprise stretching from Central Asia to the Balkans.&quot; In the Paikuli inscription of the &quot;shahanshah&quot; Narseh (), he includes an unnamed king of Iberia as one of his vassals, most likely Mirian.

Mirian, as a Sasanian vassal, took part in Narseh&#x27;s brief war against the Romans from 297 to 298. The war ended with a crushing Sasanian defeat, forcing Narseh to cede Armenia and Iberia to the Romans. Mirian quickly adapted to this change in political situation, and established close ties with Rome. This association was cemented by Mirian&#x27;s conversion to Christianity—according to tradition—through the ministry of Nino, a Cappadocian nun. Nevertheless, as Ammianus Marcellinus recounts, Constantine&#x27;s successor, Constantius, had to send in 360 embassies with costly presents to Arsaces of Armenia and Meribanes of Iberia to secure their allegiance during the confrontation with Iran.

==Conversion to Christianity==

Mirian&#x27;s conversion to Christianity and adaptation of Iberia&#x27;s state religion is accepted by scholars to have occurred either in 319 or 326, thus, making Georgia second kingdom after Armenia to have declared Christianity as a state religion. A legend has it that when Mirian, staunchly pagan, was hunting in the woods near his capital Mtskheta, the darkness fell upon the land and the king was totally blinded. The light did not resume until Mirian prayed to &quot;Nino&#x27;s God&quot; for aid. Upon his arrival he requested the audience with Nino and converted to Christianity soon after. According to tradition, Mirian&#x27;s second wife, Nana, preceded her husband in conversion.

His conversion fostered the growth of the central royal government, which confiscated the pagan temple properties and gave them to the nobles and the church; the medieval Georgian sources give evidence of how actively the monarchy and the nobility propagated Christianity and of the resistance they encountered from the mountain folk. The Roman historian Rufinus as well as the Georgian annals report that, after their conversion, the Iberians requested clergy from the emperor Constantine, who responded vigorously and sent priests and holy relics to Iberia. The Georgian tradition then relates a story of the construction of a cathedral in Mtskheta at Mirian&#x27;s behest and the king&#x27;s pilgrimage to Jerusalem shortly before his death. According to tradition, Mirian and his wife Nana were interred at the Samtavro convent in Mtskheta, where their tombs are still shown.

==Family==
The Georgian sources speak of Mirian&#x27;s two marriages. His first wife was Abeshura, daughter of the last Arsacid Iberian king who also traced his ancestry to the ancient Pharnabazid dynasty of Iberia. She died without issue when Mirian was 15 years old, in 292 according to Toumanoff. With her death, &quot;the kingship and queenship of the Pharnabazid kings came to an end in Iberia&quot;,—the chronicler continues. Mirian subsequently remarried his second queen, Nana &quot;from Pontus, daughter of Oligotos&quot;, who bore him two sons—Rev and Varaz-Bakur—and a daughter who married Peroz, the first Mihranid dynast of Gugark.

<doc id="724696" wikidata="Q1976863" url="?curid=724696" title="Circus (1936 film)">
<text>Circus () is a 1936 Soviet melodramatic comedy musical film. It was directed by Grigori Aleksandrov and Isidor Simkov at the Mosfilm studios. In his own words, it was conceived as &quot;an eccentric comedy...a real side splitter.&quot;

Starring the glamorous and immensely popular Lyubov Orlova (Aleksandrov&#x27;s wife), the first recognized star of Soviet cinema and a gifted singer, the film contains several songs which instantly became Soviet classics. The most famous is the &quot;Song of the Motherland&quot; (). ISWC code for film music: T-926.406.620-8.

The film was based on a comedy written by Ilf and Petrov and Valentin Kataev and performed by Moscow music hall, &quot;Under the Circus Dome&quot; (&quot;Под куполом цирка&quot;), which was seen and liked by Aleksandrov. They made the play into the plot, but during the initial film shooting they went to America. Upon return, they disliked the director&#x27;s interpretation, and after a conflict they abandoned the work, forbade the mention of their names in the credits, and further work on the plot was continued by Isaac Babel.

==Plot==

Marion Dixon, a popular white American circus artist, is forced to flee for her life with her black baby to escape a lynch mob in a provincial American town. The fate of the black father of her child is not mentioned, but it is heavily implied that he was lynched. Dixon is taken under the wing of Franz von Kneishitz, a sinister German theatrical agent whose mustache and mannerisms resemble those of Adolf Hitler. Kneishitz blackmails Dixon into becoming his lover while exploiting her.

Dixon is only kept alive by her love for her son Jimmy, and when she plays in Moscow as a guest performer, she is portrayed as spiritually broken. At the Moscow circus, the circus director Ludvig hires the Arctic explorer Ivan Petrovich Martynov to design a new circus act to top Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Trip to the Moon&quot; act. Ludvig&#x27;s fiery daughter Rayechka has a tempestuous relationship with her boyfriend Skameikin. Despite his mission to design an act better than her act, Martynov and Dixon fall in love, which attracts Kneishitz&#x27;s rage and he beats Dixon quite savagely with his whip.

Dixon wants to stay in Moscow with Martynov, saying she has found happiness again. Kneishitz diverts a love letter from Dixon meant for Martynov to Skameikin, which throws the circus into romantic chaos as Rayechka is furious with Skameikin while Martynov is heartbroken. To escape Rayechka, Skameikin accidentally runs into a lion cage and has to calm the lions with a bouquet of flowers. When Martynov does not respond to her love letter, Dixon nearly leaves Moscow with Kneishitz. By this time, Rayechka has learned the truth and she helps Dixon escape Kneishitz. Martynov and Dixon are late to the circus, forcing Ludvig to perform the top act of 1903, the &quot;chudo tekhniki&quot; (&quot;miracle of technology&quot;), to amuse the impatient audience. Finally, Martynov and Dixon arrive and perform their &quot;Trip to the Stratosphere&quot; act together.

Kneishitz interrupts the act to tell Dixon to come with him or else he will reveal her secret. When she refuses, Kneishitz delivers a Hitler-like rant about how Dixon has a black son called Jimmy, only for the audience to laugh at him. Ludvig tells Kneishitz that the peoples of the Soviet Union do not share his concern about racial purity or race at all. Dixon&#x27;s black son is embraced by friendly Soviet people. Kneishitz tries to seize Jimmy, but the audience unites to save him. Finally, a group of burly Red Army soldiers in the audience block Kneishitz, who cowers in fear and leaves. The movie climaxes with a lullaby being sung to the baby by representatives of various Soviet ethnicities taking turns. The lyrics of the lullaby to Jimmy are sung in Russian, Ukrainian, Yiddish, Uzbek and Georgian. One of the members of the audience is a black American man dressed in a Soviet naval officer&#x27;s uniform with a white Russian wife, which was meant to show that there is no racism in the Soviet Union. The lyrics of &quot;The International Lullaby&quot; declare: &quot;Son prikhodit na porog/Krepko, krepko spi ty/Sto putei, sto dorog/Dlia tebia otkryty&quot; (&quot;Sleep comes to your doorstep/Sleep very,very soundly/A hundred paths, a hundred doorways/Are open to you&quot;). Dixon and Martynov declare their love for one another while Rayechka and Skameikin become engaged. The film ends with Rayechka and Dixon marching together in the annual May Day parade under banners depicting the faces of Lenin and Stalin.

==Analysis==
The American scholar Rimgaila Salys noted the film &quot;Circus&quot; had a rather heavy-handed message about the evils of racism, which are associated with the West in the film, versus Soviet society, which is portrayed as free of racism. The film&#x27;s message that Jimmy will have a bright future in the Soviet Union as he grows up despite being black stands in contrast to the racism that the film depicts as being the norm in the United States and Germany. The scene where Dixon, Martynov and Jimmy pose together as a blended family was often reproduced in the Soviet Union as a symbol of racial tolerance. Likewise, the character of Charlie Chaplin in the film is a bullied servant to Kneschtiz, who delights in humiliating him. Aleksandrov was friend of the real Chaplin, who often fought with Hollywood studios over the contents of his films, and Chaplin as portrayed in &quot;Circus&quot; was intended as a metaphor for the real Chaplin, namely as a &quot;humiliated genius forced to serve the almighty dollar&quot;. 

Salys wrote that the film&#x27;s had a strong message about gender roles as Dixon comes to embrace the role of a wife and a mother at the film&#x27;s conclusion as well accepting the demands of the Soviet state upon her as the price of happiness. Salys noted that in her &quot;Trip to the Moon&quot; act, Dixon performed a lengthy masturbatory dance on atop of the phallic cannon and as she falls downwards after being shot out of the cannon, is captured by the ropes that Kneschtiz has placed under the circus tent, symbolizing her status as a sort of sex slave to Kneschtiz. By contrast, when Dixon performs the &quot;Trip to the Stratosphere&quot; act, she is presented as Martynov&#x27;s equal as the two perform the act together wearing unisex uniforms. 

Despite the ostensible egalitarian message of the film, &quot;Circus&quot; marked in many ways a return to traditional Russian gender roles. Martynov was played by the tall, muscular and blond actor Stolyarov whose appearance matched the popular stereotype of a &quot;bogatyr&quot; (the larger-than-life knight hero of medieval Russian poems known as &quot;byliny&quot;). Likewise, the character of Martynov displayed all the values typically associated with a &quot;bogatyr&quot; such being romantic, but laconic; always willing to defend the weak; a stoic acceptance of pain; and possessing super-human heroism and strength. Stolyarov having successfully played a character who matched the &quot;bogatry&quot; archetype in &quot;Circus&quot; graduated up to playing actual &quot;bogatyri&quot; in subsequent films. Salys wrote that the appearance of the &quot;bogatyr&quot; archetype as the ideal Russian man in Soviet films starting in the 1930s reflected a certain reversion to the traditional patriarchal Russian values during the Stalinist era. 

Likewise, the character of Marion is presented as highly sexualized at the beginning of the film, which associates her with &quot;western decadence&quot;, and her appearance becomes increasingly chaste as she assimilates into the puritanical Soviet society as the film goes along. Marion&#x27;s dress as she performs the Flight to the Moon act emphasizes her sexuality as she wore a tight, low-cut bodice with stars placed where her nipples are, which was meant show that she was an exploited woman in the West, just merely a sex object for rich and powerful men such as Kneschtiz. The scene where Marion throws her expensive Western dresses at Kneschtiz as she says that &quot;Marion you knew is no more!&quot; marked a key turning point in her character&#x27;s development as she thereafter dresses in a more Soviet style. Marion&#x27;s more conservative Soviet clothing was meant to show that she was no longer an exploited woman. Marion is portrayed as the typical foreigner in Soviet films as she is naïve, romantic, generous, kind and utterly passive as it is the Soviet characters who take the initiative in rescuing her from the cruel clutches of Kneschtiz. Unlike films in the 1920s, which featured strong feminist heroines, Marion is very much a &quot;damsel in distress&quot; who needs Martynov to save her. The film ends with Marion marching alongside Martynov-whom she is planning to marry-in the May Day parade with both dressed in the same white uniforms, which symbolized her assimilation into Soviet society and her acceptance of its values as her own.

Soviet censors disapproved of any signs of sexuality, and rather surprisingly allowed the circus scenes where young women dance around and longingly touch the phallic cannons, though those scenes were subsequently censored. Despite the efforts of the censors, Aleksandrov was able to insert the scene where Martynov and Dixon fly together in their Trip to the Stratosphere act with ecstatic expressions on their faces, which serves as a metaphor for high of an orgasm.

==Reception==
* The movie was the most commercially successful Soviet film. Two weeks after the release, it was viewed by 1 million people in Moscow alone
* In Russia, Solomon Mikhoels&#x27;s murder in 1948 by the order of Stalin was perceived as a rejection of movie&#x27;s message about the danger of chauvinism and anti-Semitism. American researcher Herbert Eagle said: &quot;The scene in the &quot;Circus&quot; is intended to show that the Soviet people are devoid of racial prejudices. Of course, it was an attack against America and propaganda, but on the other hand, Aleksandrov probably sincerely called for reconciliation, for harmony, hoping that in these terrible times he would awaken conscience in the audience with the means available to him.&quot;
* In early 1953, the verses from the lullaby, sung in Yiddish (which were performed by Solomon Mikhoels) were removed. After Stalin&#x27;s death the verses were restored
* The well known animal trainer Boris Eder substituted for Aleksandr Komissarov in Skameikin&#x27;s flower fight with the lions
* The &quot;Flight to the Moon&quot; stunt coordinated and performed by three Kharkiv inventors where the extreme sports athlete Vera Buslaeva substituted for Lyubov Orlova for the cameras
* The movie has an in-joke about Mikhail Lermontov&#x27;s death at the hands of Nikolai Martynov, at that time in the 1930s it was officially revised as a planned political murder ordered by the secret police
* The movie with an American Catholic protagonist was released one month before the 1936 anti-abortion law. Just after that, America and Americans disappeared from Soviet cinema. Lyubov Orlova had to participate in the anti-abortion law promotion company: &quot;I myself want a child, and I will certainly have one. And it is natural. Life is getting more and more joyful and more fun. The future is even more wonderful. Why not give birth?&quot;. In 1941, she adopted Douglas (b. 19 May 1925), Grigori Aleksandrov&#x27;s son by his first marriage to actress Olga Ivanova (she died during childbirth in June 1941, being married to a famous actor Boris Tenin). He was named after Douglas Fairbanks, he and Mary Pickford visited the Bolshevik state back then and were admired by Grigori and Olga. In 1952, Douglas Aleksandrov was arrested by the MVD on false treason claims and, at 26 in a prison, had suffered his first heart attack before being forcefully renamed to &#x27;Vasilii&#x27;. The MVD unsuccessfully wanted him to testify about his father being an American spy. He was released shortly after Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953

<doc id="724699" wikidata="Q1408997" url="?curid=724699" title="Zeiram">
<text>, stylized as ZËIЯAM (originally marketed in English as Zeram), is a 1991 Japanese science fiction film directed by Keita Amemiya. The film stars Yūko Moriyama as an extraterrestrial bounty hunter named Iria, who comes to Earth to do battle with Zeiram, a powerful alien creature. With the help of her partner—an artificial intelligence named Bob—and two ordinary Japanese electricians, Iria fights Zeiram in a virtually constructed alternate dimension known as a &quot;Zone&quot;.

&quot;Zeiram&quot; was released in Japan in August 1991. It was dubbed in English and released in the United States in 1994, where it garnered mixed reviews from American film critics. That same year, the film was followed by a six-episode original video animation (OVA) known as &quot;&quot; (which serves as a prequel to the film), as well as a sequel film titled &quot;Zeiram 2&quot;.

==Plot==
Extraterrestrial bounty hunters Iria and Bob accept a job to apprehend Zeiram, a powerful alien entity, on Earth. They set up a command center in an abandoned building in a Japanese town, and create a virtually constructed alternate dimension called a &quot;Zone&quot; (in this case, the Zone they construct is a simulated recreation of the town, but without any living residents) where they plan to combat and capture Zeiram. Iria and Bob&#x27;s use of stolen electricity results in electric company employees Kamiya and Teppei investigating their base just as Zeiram enters Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

Kamiya accidentally flips a switch that transports Teppei into the Zone. While Kamiya tries to get an explanation from Iria, she transports the two of them to the Zone. Upon arrival, she traps him in a hardened encasing and leaves to destroy the pod Zeiram arrived in. Teppei finds Zeiram, who creates and sends a smaller monster after him; fleeing, Teppei eventually stumbles across the captured Kamiya, and later Iria. Iria&#x27;s initial attempt to capture Zeiram fails and she finds he has a shield that makes him immune to bullet fire. Iria decides to utilize a special combat suit, despite Bob&#x27;s protests to not fight Zeiram in close-range combat. After Iria finally manages to capture Zeiram in an encasing, Teppei asks her to free Kamiya, and she obliges. Iria is accidentally teleported back to Earth with one of Zeiram&#x27;s subordinates, and their ensuing fight damages the teleportation unit. Using weapons left behind by Iria, Teppei saves Kamiya from the monster Zeiram summoned, but Kamiya accidentally shoots the lock to Zeiram&#x27;s encasing, freeing Zeiram.

Iria tries teleporting back to the Zone but is set back by a power failure. Teppei and Kamiya hotwire a car and use it to incapacitate Zeiram. The human-like face on Zeiram&#x27;s &quot;hat&quot; attacks them, biting Kamiya. Teppei and Kamiya escape soon after. Bob speculates that Zeiram is a forbidden biological weapon whose &quot;hat&quot; is used to eat other beings and use the organic matter he consumes to produce his monster subordinates. Zeiram&#x27;s attempt to make a subordinate copy of Kamiya ends in failure and he kills it in anger.

Teppei receives a communicator from Iria. She explains the problems with the transporter and that the Zone itself will not last much longer. Iria and Bob decide to bring a powerful weapon called the Metis Cannon to fight Zeiram, despite the personal risk it causes them to use it without prior approval from the authorities to whom the bounty hunters answer. Teppei loses track of Kamiya but follows Iria&#x27;s instructions to head towards a building where the Metis Cannon will be transported to. Teppei is impeded by Zeiram along the way, but is reunited with Kamiya, who hijacks an excavator in an attempt to save Teppei from Zeiram. Iria suddenly arrives and shoots Zeiram with a bazooka.

Despite his body being reduced to its skeleton, Zeiram continues to pursue the trio. Iria defends Teppei and Kamiya as they retrieve the Metis Cannon from the spot Bob transported it to. Iria uses the Metis Cannon to reduce Zeiram down to his &quot;hat&quot;, and traps him with eight minutes to spare before the Zone breaks down. Teppei and Kamiya are teleported back to Earth, where they meet Bob. Zeiram is teleported to Earth next, but begins to hover and destroys the transport unit needed to bring Iria back. He escapes from the trap, and from Zeiram&#x27;s &quot;hat&quot; spawns a new form of the creature with prehensile appendages. Kamiya uses his technician skills to help repair the transport unit while Zeiram attacks Teppei. Kamiya succeeds and Iria returns in time to save the two men and Bob from Zeiram. After a brief respite, Iria complements the two on their resilience and offers them two of her braids as a &quot;thank you&quot; gesture. Bob takes a photo of the trio together as a memento.

== Production ==
The film was the second film directed by Keita Amemiya, with his first being &quot;Mirai Ninja&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Zeiram&quot; was released in Japan in August 1991. The film was released in the United States with an English dub by Streamline Pictures in 1994, under the title &quot;Zeram&quot;. In March 1994, the film screened with Japanese audio and English subtitles at the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In April 1994, the film premiered in New York at the Westbury Theater.

The English-dubbed &quot;Zeram&quot; was released on VHS in the United States by Fox Lorber in 1994. It received a DVD release in the U.S. by Image Entertainment in 1998, and was released with both Japanese and English audio as &quot;Zeiram&quot; by Tokyo Shock in 2006.

== Reception ==

&quot;Zeiram&quot; received mixed reviews from American film critics. Russell Smith of the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; gave the film a score of two out of five stars, praising the opening black-and-white sequence but describing the remainder of the film as &quot;90 minutes of enjoyable but unspectacular Japanese science fiction with a fair amount of wit and funky charm, but few real thrills.&quot; &quot;Newsday&quot;″s Terry Kelleher, who gave the film two out of four stars, was unimpressed by the comedic banter between the characters of Kamiya and Teppei, but concluded that, &quot;The business of &quot;Zeiram&quot; is action, and Amemiya keeps it coming, accompanying the abundant violence with a refreshingly small amount of gore.&quot;

A reviewer for &quot;Fangoria&quot; described wanting to &quot;reach into the picture tube and slap the two male idiots [Kamiya and Teppei],&quot; and criticized the English dubbing, but praised the film&#x27;s imagination and overall called it &quot;loads of hi-tech fun, and although it&#x27;s primarily aimed at a juvenile audience, it has enough extreme gore and craziness to keep anyone amused, especially fans of &#x27;60s superheroes such as Ultraman.&quot; Similarly, Betsy Sherman of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that the film &quot;melds the cheesy camp of &#x27;60s Japanese monster movies, the resourcefulness of recent Hong Kong fantasy pictures and the sensibility of pulp science fiction. The mix of characters seems to be aimed toward a young audience, but there are some good yucky special effects for genre fans.&quot; A reviewer for &quot;LA Weekly&quot; praised the film&#x27;s direction and special effects, describing the latter as &quot;so insidious they&#x27;re the stuff of nightmares and so cheesy they&#x27;re the stuff of fondue&quot;, and writing: &quot;&quot;Zeiram&quot; may call to mind &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot; and even John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;The Thing&quot;, but Japanese sci-fi director Keita Amemiya never ceases to amaze with his originality and inventiveness.&quot;

==Anime OVA prequel==

&quot;Iria: Zeiram the Animation&quot; is a six-episode original video animation (OVA) anime series produced by Ashi Productions and directed by Tetsurō Amino. Released in 1994, the series serves as a prequel to the original &quot;Zeiram&quot;, taking place several years earlier when Iria is still a rookie and detailing the events surrounding a prior encounter between her and the titular entity. Fujikuro from &quot;Zeiram 2&quot; makes an appearance in the OVA.

==Sequel film==

, a sequel film also directed by Amemiya and featuring Moriyama, Ida and Hotaru reprising their roles from the first film, was released in Japan on December 17, 1994. The plot of &quot;Zeiram 2&quot; centers around the creature&#x27;s core, which was presumed dead, having been recovered by a shadowy organization which installs it as the organic core of a robotic supersoldier. Iria, Bob, Teppei, and Kamiya continue their battle against Zeiram in a Zone created by the monster. The plot plays out similarly to the original &quot;Zeiram&quot;, with the four getting into cat-and-mouse confrontations with the creature and the monsters that he summons and dealing with complications caused by Iria and Bob&#x27;s faulty tech. The sequel adds the additional challenge of Fujikuro, a manipulative rival and saboteur who seeks the same ancient teleportation relic called the Kamarite that Iria and Bob returned to Earth to obtain.

==Video game==
, stylized as ZËIЯAMZΘNE, is a beat &#x27;em up / fighting game for the PlayStation. It is partially based on the films &quot;Zeiram &amp; Zeiram 2&quot;.

<text>Oklahoma City University (OCU) is a private university historically affiliated with the United Methodist Church and located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

The university offers undergraduate bachelor&#x27;s degrees, graduate master&#x27;s degrees and doctoral degrees, and is organized into eight colleges and schools and one Methodist seminary. More than 70 undergraduate majors are offered, as well as 20 graduate degrees, including a JD, MBA, MFA, and PhD in Nursing. An Adult Studies Program for working adults offers a Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree. The university has approximately 3,000 students, including 1,200 graduate students. The official school and athletic colors are blue and white.

==History==
===Early history===
Oklahoma City University began as Epworth University, a project by local developer Anton H. Classen, who sought to begin a Methodist university in conjunction with other development projects. Construction began in 1902 and the school opened in 1904, three years before statehood, with an enrollment of 100 students. Anton Classen was heavily involved with development of early Oklahoma City and advanced the idea of a Methodist university in Oklahoma and helped spark the ideas of the Methodist Church to establish a Methodist university in Oklahoma. Construction began in 1902 and classes started in 1904 with enrollment growing by almost 100 students during that first year.

Epworth closed in 1911 after the school ran into financial difficulties. The church then formed Methodist University of Oklahoma in Guthrie, Oklahoma, which also absorbed a Methodist college in Texas, Fort Worth University. Eventually, the school&#x27;s trustees developed a plan to close the school in Guthrie and reopen in Oklahoma City. The school opened in Oklahoma City as Oklahoma City College in 1919, bolstered by funding from Methodist congregations. The college experienced rapid growth and changed its name to Oklahoma City University in 1924. Despite the success and growth of the university in the 1920s, OCU again fell on hard times during the Great Depression.

===Post-war era===
Dr. Cluster Smith became president of Oklahoma City University after the Great Depression. When the United States entered World War II, the school faced new challenges, including mounting debt and a need for new facilities. Enrollment dipped during the war, as men left campus to enlist in the military. By 1942, the student body was 75 percent female. This created a shortage of players and funds causing many of the athletic programs, such as the football team, to end operations. After the war, enrollment increased dramatically and the university began a period of rapid development through the remainder of the 1940s. In the 1950s, OCU received accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. The university then took control of the Oklahoma City College of Law and began a partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to elevate the academics and the quality of education. The Bishop W. Angie Smith Chapel was dedicated in 1968 as part of a plan to expand OCU&#x27;s spiritual life.

In the mid-1970s, after nearly 25 years of steady growth, the university again fell on hard times. In 1976 United Methodist Bishop Paul Milhouse discussed the school&#x27;s issues to the Annual Conference of Oklahoma United Methodist churches in Tulsa. After requesting that people direct their prayers and pledges to the university, by 1980 the Methodist Church had raised more than $3 million. Jerald Walker, an OCU alumnus, became president in 1979 and continued the university&#x27;s growth stemming from the financial support from the Church. During his tenure as president facilities were improved, new academic programs were started and enrollment increased again. In 1981 it was announced that the university was out of debt and turned a surplus for the first time since 1975. The university added the School of Religion and the nursing program during the 1980s.

===Recent history===
In the 1990s, the university upgraded and renovated campus facilities. Stephen Jennings became president in 1998 and began focusing on the university&#x27;s centennial celebration and position the university for the future. Under Jennings, OCU team names were changed from the Chiefs to the Stars and the university expanded student life, including the Distinguished Speakers Series. Tom McDaniel became president in 2001 and altered the look of the OCU campus from an influx of donations. New additions to the campus included The Ann Lacy Visitor and Admissions Center, the Norick Art Center, the Edith Kinney Gaylord Center, the Wanda L. Bass School of Music Center, Meinders School of Business, and a new residence hall. Robert Harlan Henry, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, became the university&#x27;s 17th president in July 2010, succeeding Tom McDaniel. During Henry&#x27;s tenure, the university has moved the OCU School of Law to an historic location in downtown Oklahoma City, renovated several academic facilities, and launched a Physician Assistant program.
The 18th president of Oklahoma City University was Martha Burger, who served from 2018 to 2021.
She was succeeded on by Kenneth R. Evans, who had previously served as president of Lamar University.

===Historic designation===
On December 19, 1978, part of the university campus was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.

The university purchased the historic Central High School building in downtown Oklahoma City in 2012 where the School of Law is now located.

The Kerr-McGee Centennial Plaza on the southeast corner of the campus was constructed in 2004 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of OCU. The plaza features bronze statues honoring OCU&#x27;s three Miss America pageant winners. In the first decade of the 21st century, OCU completed more than $100 million in new campus construction.

<doc id="724703" wikidata="Q975465" url="?curid=724703" title="Nikki Webster">
<text>Nicole Marie Webster (born 30 April 1987) is an Australian pop singer. She is best known for her role in performing at both the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics opening ceremony, and the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics closing ceremony as well for her song &quot;Strawberry Kisses&quot;, which made number 21 on the list of Top 25 singles in Australia released in 2001.

== Early life ==
Webster was born on 30 April 1987, to parents Tina and Mark Webster in Sydney, New South Wales. At a young age, she told her parents that she wanted to go into show business, so she started taking lessons. She attended MLC School in Burwood until year 10 and then attended the McDonald College of Performing Arts in Sydney.

== Early career ==
Webster&#x27;s first acting role was as part of the ensemble cast in the pantomime &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the State theatre in Sydney, at the age of five. The production starred Jo Beth Taylor as Cinderella, Nancye Hayes as the Fairy Godmother, Lochie Daddo as the Prince, Bert Newton as The Baron, and Bruce Spence and Paul Blackwell as the Ugly Step-sisters. The following year she appeared in a production of &quot;Aladdin&quot;.

Webster appeared in television commercials including Twisties, Lay&#x27;s chips and Campbell&#x27;s Soup. At 10 years old, Webster played the Young Cosette in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, and in 1999–2000 starred as Brigitta Von Trapp in a stage production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, alongside Lisa McCune, John Waters and Bert Newton.

In March 2000, Webster auditioned for an unknown part in the 2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. In August, following an elimination process, she was told by opening ceremony artistic director/producer David Atkins that the role was hers.

At the age of 13, Webster played a major part in the opening ceremony, including performing the song &quot;Under Southern Skies&quot;. She also performed &quot;We&#x27;ll Be One&quot; at the closing ceremony.

== Recording career ==
=== 2000–2004: &quot;Follow Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Bliss&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; ===
Webster signed a contract with BMG at the age of 13, after her success at the Olympics, and her first single &quot;Strawberry Kisses&quot; reached No. 2 on the Australian singles charts in 2001, holding the position for 7 weeks. Her debut album, &quot;Follow Your Heart&quot;, also went platinum, with the second single, &quot;Depend on Me&quot;, going top 20, while the third single, &quot;The Best Days&quot;/&quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, reached No. 21. She also starred as Dorothy in an Australian stage performance of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, which ran between 2001 and 2002. Webster was nominated for an ARIA Award for Best Selling album and she won a John O&#x27;Keefe Encouragement Award at the 2001 Mo Awards.

Webster&#x27;s 2002 &quot;BLISS&quot; album also went gold with a cover of American girl group P.Y.T.&#x27;s &quot;Something More Beautiful&quot; reaching No. 13 and going gold, while the second single &quot;24/7 (Crazy &#x27;bout Your Smile)&quot; also reached the top 20.

Later, Webster released a cover version of &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot; by Martha and the Vandellas which reached the top twenty while her 2004 single &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; reached the top 40 in Australia. A greatest hits album was released soon afterwards.

=== 2005–present ===
In early 2005, Webster hosted &quot;The Greatest Circus Acts of All Time&quot; on the Seven Network. She was announced as one of the contestants in
season 2 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She was criticised for having an &quot;unfair advantage&quot; over other dancers because of her previous dancing experience. Webster and dance partner Sasha Farber were eliminated in week six of the series after judge Todd McKenney gave them a score of one out of 10. Webster appeared on the May 2005 cover of &quot;FHM&quot; after the magazine approached her to do the shoot as a celebration of turning 18. She was voted #7 in the &quot;FHM Australia&quot; 100 Sexiest Women 2005 list. Webster also appeared in one episode of Australian TV series &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot; as a cast member.

In 2006, Webster stated in interviews that she was living and working in Nashville, United States, writing with well-known writers working on her new album. It was also revealed she headed to Los Angeles to develop a new style of music heading for a more mature pop sound. In 2006, she modelled for the cover of &quot;Zoo Weekly&quot; to celebrate her 19th birthday.

In May 2007, Webster played the lead role of Sheila in a Perth production of the rock musical &quot;Hair&quot; along with Rob Mills and Cosima De Vito. In September 2007, Webster raised eyebrows by performing as a wind-up doll at the Sydney gay and lesbian dance party Sleaze Ball. This and her October 2006 photoshoot appearance in men&#x27;s magazine &quot;FHM&quot; were seen as an attempt to mature her image, but attracted wide ridicule given her previous role in the 2000 Olympics. Webster regularly appeared on the show &quot;20 to 1&quot;.

In January 2008, Webster announced she would be opening a performing arts school in February with brother Scott in a bid to help young people get into the industry. In January 2012 they opened a second school on the Central Coast, NSW. It was announced in May 2009 that Nikki was set to release her first new single in five years, &quot;Devilicious&quot;, on 12 June. She performed &quot;Devilicious&quot; on &quot;The Morning Show&quot; in August 2009 in order to promote the single.

Webster made a guest appearance on 15 July 2009 episode of &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;, in a music video parody of the Barack Obama viral video &quot;Yes We Can&quot;, the parody based on Kevin Rudd&#x27;s speeches.

In February 2010, Webster and her brother Scott opened a talent and modeling agency for kids, Talent @ Nikki Webster.

Webster had a role in the 2012 independent feature &quot;Circle of Lies&quot;.

== Other work ==
In 2001, Webster was named the face of Jager Cosmetics&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s a Girl Thing&quot; range for young teens. She was featured on their website and in print ads.

Webster was approached by executives at Kmart to create her own range of clothing. The &#x27;Nikki Webster&#x27; clothing and accessories range for girls aged between 5–10 was first released in stores in August 2003. She said, &quot;My clothes are more about fun and they&#x27;re all bright colours. I want kids to have fun and be individuals in my clothes.&quot; Webster designed the clothes herself and travelled to L.A. and London to &quot;have a look at international fashion for inspiration.&quot;

In 2019, Webster appeared as a contestant on &quot;The Masked Singer Australia&quot; as Alien, and was voted off in the third episode.

== Personal life ==
Webster got engaged to Matthew McMah in January 2011, and they were married on 10 November 2012. They separated in 2018 and have two children together.

Webster owns a children&#x27;s dance school with three studios in Sydney called &quot;Dance At Nikki Webster&quot;.

<text>Peter Alexander McWilliams (August 5, 1949 – June 14, 2000) was an American self-help author who advocated for the legalization of marijuana.

==Early life==
McWilliams was born to a Roman Catholic family in Detroit, one of two sons of Henry G. and Mary (née Toarmina; later Fadden) McWilliams. His father worked as a supervisor at a drugstore and his mother was a part-time salesperson.

He attended Allen Park High School and Eastern Michigan University and later enrolled at Maharishi International University. At the age of 17 he wrote a collection of poems called &quot;Come Love with Me and Be My Life,&quot; which he self-published under the name Versemonger Press.

==Career and activism==
McWilliams wrote &quot;The TM Book&quot; in 1975 with Denise Denniston, which was at the top of the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for three weeks.

In 1976, he wrote &quot;TM: An Alphabetical Guide to the Transcendental Meditation Program&quot; with Denniston and Nat Goldhaber.

He wrote &quot;TM&quot; with Harold H. Bloomfield, and later co-wrote the book &quot;How to Heal Depression&quot;.

McWilliams was active in Erhard Seminars Training with Werner Erhard and Stuart Emory&#x27;s &quot;Actualizations&quot; large-group awareness training before meeting John-Roger in the fall of 1978. 

He wrote nearly 40 books including &quot;Surviving the Loss of a Love&quot; (1971), &quot;The Personal Computer Book&quot; (1982) and &quot;Life 101: Everything We Wish We Had Learned About Life in School but Didn&#x27;t&quot; (1990). His 1982 book, &quot;The Word Processing Book: A Short Course in Computer Literacy&quot;, was published during the &quot;computer revolution&quot; and was &quot;highly successful.&quot; McWilliams was a photographer, and a collection of his own photographs were published in October 1992 in a book titled &quot;Portraits – A Book of Photographs by Peter McWilliams&quot;.

McWilliams was arrested and charged with growing marijuana in 1997. He was released from custody on $250,000 bail and with the &quot;condition that he not use marijuana.&quot; His book &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody&#x27;s Business if You Do: The Absurdity of Consensual Crimes in Our Free Society&quot;, published in 1993, made a case for the legalization of drugs and became a favored publication of the Libertarian Party. &quot;Life 101&quot; and subsequent books list John-Roger (Roger Delano Hinkins), the leader of the Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, as his co-writer. McWilliams later repudiated the movement, claiming to be the sole author of the books.

==Health issues and death==
McWilliams was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma in 1996.
He died on June 14, 2000, in his Los Angeles home, of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. He was survived by his mother and brother, Michael McWilliams. At the time he was awaiting sentencing for his conviction of conspiring to &quot;possess, manufacture and sell marijuana.&quot;

Cannabis activist Richard Cowan and other critics of the drug policies in the United States have described his death as murder by the U.S. government, insofar as they denied him the use of the medical marijuana which might have prevented his death. William F. Buckley stated that McWilliams was vomiting and in pain when he died.

He is entombed at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, California.

Many Roman philosophers praised (perseverance, endurance, and courage), , and as the most important virtues; this is because they made dignified men capable. They accompany Roman actions. The men of the ruling upper and upper-middle classes were educated in a public school system where Classical language and literature formed basic elements of the curriculum.

Exuding or dignified and serious conduct allowed Romans to maintain a persistent element of conservatism and traditionalism. According to the Roman emperor and philosopher Marcus Aurelius, the cultivation of involves acting with sincerity and dignity, by being temperate in manner and speech as well as by carrying oneself with authority.

Other sources associate with living an austere lifestyle. It was one of the moral bases of the sanctioned control exercised by the Roman (see Roman Censors). An account described how old statesmen who realized that they no longer meet the standards of for failing to perform their public function with dignity and committed suicide or simply refused taking food.

<text>The Nagarathar or Nattukottai Nagarathar (also known as Nattukottai Chettiar) is a Tamil caste found native in Tamil Nadu, India. Nagarathars are a mercantile community who are traditionally involved in commerce, banking and money lending. They use the title Chettiar and are traditionally concentrated in modern region Chettinad. They are prominent philanthropist who funded and built several Hindu temples, Choultries, schools, colleges and universities.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Nagarathar&quot; literally means &quot;town-dweller&quot;. Their title, Chettiar, is a generic term used by several mercantile groups which is derived from the ancient Tamil term &quot;etti&quot; (bestowed on merchants by the Tamil monarchs).

Nagarathars are also known as &quot;Nattukottai Chettiar&quot;. The term &quot;Nattukottai&quot; literally means &quot;country-fort&quot; in reference to their fort-like mansions.

== History ==
Nattukottai Nagarathars were originally from Naganadu. This ancient land Naganadu is believed to be destroyed (either in an earthquake or floods) and this place was either North or North West of Kanchipuram.

Nagarathars migrated and lived in the following places:

· Kanchipuram (Thondai Nadu) – From 2897 BC for about 2100 years

· Kaveripoompatinam (Poompuhar), the capital of the early (Chola Kingdom) – From 789 BC for about 1400 years.

· Karaikudi (Pandiya Kingdom) – From 707 AD onwards.

When they were in Naganadu these Dhana Vaishyas had three different divisions:

1. &quot;Aaru (Six) Vazhiyar&quot;

2. &quot;Ezhu (Seven) Vazhiyar&quot;

3. &quot;Nangu (Four) Vazhiyar&quot;

All these three divisions were devoted to Emerald Ganesha (மரகத விநாயகர்). Only after they migrated to the Pandya Kingdom they were called as Ariyurar, Ilayatrangudiyar, and Sundrapattanathar.

Nagarathars of Ilayatrangudiyar were later called as Nattukottai Nagarathar. Ariyurar Nagarathars further split into 3 divisions: Vadakku Valavu, Therku Valavu and Elur Chetty (Nagercoil). Sundrapattanathar Nagarathars migrated to Kollam district in Kerala and their history is completely lost now since there was no record keeping.

The Nagarathar or Nattukkottai Chettiar were originally salt traders and historically an itinerant community of merchants and claim Chettinad as their traditional home. How they reached that place, which at the time comprised adjacent parts of the ancient states of Pudukkottai, Ramnad and Sivagangai, is uncertain, with various communal legends being recorded. There are various claims regarding how they arrived in that area. Among those are a fairly recently recorded claim that they were driven there because of persecution by a Chola king. No more details are forthcoming about this story and as to why the Nagarathar left the Chola kingdom and moved away from Kaveripoompattinam to the Pandiya kingdom.

Another older one, recounted to Edgar Thurston, that they were encouraged to go there by a Pandyan king who wanted to take advantage of their trading skills. The legends converge in saying that they obtained the use of nine temples, with each representing one exogamous part of the community.

The traditional base of the Nattukottai Nagarathars is the Chettinad region of the present-day state of Tamil Nadu. It comprises a triangular area around north-east Sivagangai, north-west Ramnad and south Pudukkottai.

They may have become maritime traders as far back as the 8th century CE. They were trading in salt and by the 17th century, European expansionism in South East Asia during the next century fostered conditions that enabled the community to expand its trading enterprises, including as moneylenders, thereafter. By the late 18th century expanded them to inland and coastal trade in cotton and rice.

In the 19th century, following the Permanent Settlement, some in the Nagarathar community wielded considerable influence in the affairs of the zamindar (landowners) elite. There had traditionally been a relationship between royalty and the community based on the premise that providing worthy service to royalty would result in the granting of high honours but this changed as the landowners increasingly needed to borrow money from the community in order to fight legal battles designed to retain their property and powers. Nagarathars provided that money as mortgaged loans but by the middle of the century they were becoming far less tolerant of any defaults and were insisting that failure to pay as arranged would result in the mortgaged properties being forfeited. By the 19th century were their business activities developed into a sophisticated banking system, with their business expanding to parts of Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and China.

===Varna Classification===

In the absence of a proper Chaturvarna (four-fold varna) system in South India, the Nattukottai Nagarathars (also known as Chettiars) have been classified as high-class Vaishyas (merchant caste) due to their extensive involvement in trade, finance, and banking activities. Their economic prominence and wealth elevated their social status, and they were often considered above Brahmins in certain contexts.

In addition to their economic prominence, the Nattukottai Nagarathars have been renowned for their philanthropic contributions to religious and social causes. They donated generously to the construction, renovation, and maintenance of numerous Shiva and Vishnu temples across Tamil Nadu and other regions, leaving a lasting legacy in the religious and cultural heritage of South India. This charitable tradition further elevated their social standing and cemented their role as patrons of South Indian religious institutions.

Furthermore, some Nattukottai Chettiars ascended to kingship through their wealth and influence. Although kings are traditionally associated with the Kshatriya varna in the chaturvarna system, the Chettiars&#x27; rise to power was based on their economic achievements rather than hereditary lineage.

==Religious influence==
The nine temples connected with the Nagarathar community include: Ilayathakudi, Iluppaikkudi, Iraniyur, Mathur, Nemam, Pillayarpatti, Soorakudi, Vairavanpatti, and Velangudi. 

Nagarathars also celebrate Pillaiyar Nonbu, which starts twenty-one days after Thirukarthigai, the last day of Karthigai Deepam.

<text>Chicken Tonight is a brand of sauce intended to be added to chicken pieces in a frying pan, available in flavors such as Honey &amp; Mustard, Country French and Thai Green Curry.

==History==
Initially launched on October 23, 1990, under Unilever&#x27;s Ragú brand in the United States and Canada, it was launched in the United Kingdom under the Knorr brand in 1993, while the same year, Chicken Tonight made its way to Oceania under the Raguletto brand. As of 2025, Chicken Tonight is a standalone brand.

The associated advertising slogan is &quot;I feel like Chicken Tonight&quot;. In one series of television ads, these words were sung by actors as they &#x27;flapped&#x27; their arms in a movement similar to the dance &quot;The Chicken&quot;. An advertisement for Chicken Tonight was the first in the United Kingdom to use a red button interactive service to promote the product.
The American version of the product was met with limited success; however, as of 2025, it is still sold in Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Association football player Ian Wright appeared in commercials for the product. In 2011, Unilever sold the Ragu business and the Chicken Tonight brand (in a deal worth £30m) in the United Kingdom to Symington&#x27;s, a food manufacturer in Leeds, who would drop the Knorr branding. Symington&#x27;s later acquired the Oceania rights to Raguletto and Chicken Tonight; they have since been acquired by Simplot. In 2019, Unilever also sold Chicken Tonight brand in the Netherlands to Zwanenberg Food Group.

==In popular culture==
The slogan was parodied in a skit on the Australian television series &quot;The Late Show&quot; in 1993 with &quot;Dickhead Tonight&quot;, where people danced while singing &quot;I Feel Like a Dickhead Tonight&quot;.

The dance and song of the advertisement were parodied by &quot;The Simpsons&quot; family in the episode &quot;Lady Bouvier&#x27;s Lover&quot;.

A segment on an &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; episode parodied the brand as &quot;Iguana Tonight.&quot;
