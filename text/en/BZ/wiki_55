<text>Shasta Dam (called Kennett Dam before its construction) is a concrete arch-gravity dam across the Sacramento River in Northern California in the United States. At high, it is the eighth-tallest dam in the United States. Located at the north end of the Sacramento Valley, Shasta Dam creates Shasta Lake for long-term water storage, flood control, hydroelectricity and protection against the intrusion of saline water. The largest reservoir in the state, Shasta Lake can hold about .

Envisioned as early as 1919 as an effort to conserve, control, store, and distribute water to the Central Valley, California&#x27;s main agricultural region, Shasta was first authorized in the 1930s as a state undertaking. However, bonds did not sell due to the onset of the Great Depression and Shasta was transferred to the federal Bureau of Reclamation as a public works project. Construction started in earnest in 1937 under the supervision of Chief Engineer Frank Crowe. During its building, the dam provided thousands of much-needed jobs; it was finished twenty-six months ahead of schedule in 1945. When completed, the dam was the second-tallest in the United States after Hoover, and was considered one of the greatest engineering feats of all time.

Even before its dedication, Shasta Dam served an important role in World War II providing electricity to California factories, and still plays a vital part in the management of state water resources today. However, it has greatly changed the environment and ecology of the Sacramento River, and flooded sacred Native American tribal lands. In recent years, there has been debate over whether or not to raise the dam in order to allow for increased water storage and power generation. This would produce more low carbon electricity, but is opposed by tribes and fish advocates because of negative impacts from water diversions from river flows and impacts on endangered species.

==History==

===Early proposals===

In the late 19th century, the Central Valley was the main destination for large numbers of immigrants traveling into California from the eastern United States. The valley&#x27;s land was coveted for farming due to its fertile soils, mild climate, gentle topography, and abundant water. The Sacramento River flows south through the northern third of the valley, known as the Sacramento Valley, for before emptying into a vast estuary, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, and ultimately the Pacific Ocean. By the late 1800s, both the valley and Delta regions were intensely cultivated with various crops including wheat, cotton, rice, citrus, and melons.

The low-lying topography of the Sacramento Valley makes it vulnerable to flooding in the winter; conversely, irrigation is necessary during the summer due to the highly seasonal precipitation. Although the Sacramento River discharges nearly of water each year, most of the flow occurs during winter storms and spring snowmelt, with natural runoff reducing to a trickle during late summers and autumns of drought years. As farming increased, low river flows dropped even lower, leading to saltwater intrusion from San Francisco Bay into the Delta. This caused water shortages for Delta farms, and led to a teredo (saltwater worm) infestation between 1919 and 1924 that destroyed piers and ships in Suisun Bay.

In a bid to solve the salinity problem, local residents proposed constructing a tidal barrage across the mouth of Suisun Bay, a project which was never realized. In 1919 a different solution came in the form of the Marshall Plan, created by Robert Marshall of the United States Geological Survey. It proposed a large dam across the Sacramento River just downstream of its confluence with the Pit River near the copper mining town of Kennett, several hundred miles to the north of the Delta. The dam would store water for release during the dry months when the Delta was most vulnerable to saltwater intrusion, with the added benefit of controlling floods in the winter. Water captured by the dam would increase the irrigation supply, for both the Sacramento Valley and the San Joaquin Valley further south, with which it would be linked by an extensive aqueduct and reservoir system.

===State Water Plan and the CVP===
The Marshall Plan was not widely supported due to its high cost (about $800 million in 2008 dollars); when proposed to Congress in 1921, it passed in the Senate but failed in the House of Representatives. However, the state of California continued to search for a solution. In 1931, State Engineer Edward Hyatt published a similar but less extensive proposal called the State Water Plan, with a projected cost of about $550 million. Including the dam at Kennett and aqueducts from the Delta southwards into the arid San Joaquin Valley and the Los Angeles Basin, Hyatt&#x27;s scheme laid the foundations for both the present day Central Valley Project (CVP) and the California State Water Project (SWP).
Initially, the state of California intended to finance the project entirely on its own through the sale of revenue bonds. However, the 1930s were a time of economic crisis with the onset of the Great Depression and a severe drought that devastated the agricultural sector, pushing the unemployment rate in California up to 20 percent. The project was approved in the state legislature by a slim margin, mostly riding on Central and Northern California voters, who needed both the jobs and the water. Southern California generally opposed the project because they needed money to build an aqueduct to the Colorado River, from which the state had previously secured rights. In 1933, the state authorized the sale of bonds to fund the Central Valley Project, whose main component was to be Shasta Dam. Unable to raise the necessary money, California turned to the federal government for help.

In 1935, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt authorized the Central Valley Project as part of the New Deal. The construction works at Shasta Dam and other parts of the project would provide thousands of much-needed jobs, contributing a major portion of the Depression era federal job-creation programs. Roosevelt first considered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for building the project, but ultimately transferred it to the Reclamation Service, the precursor to the Bureau of Reclamation, which had expertise in building large concrete dams as demonstrated in the Hoover Dam (Boulder Canyon) Project several years earlier. Reclamation chose Frank Crowe, the superintendent of Hoover Dam construction, to direct operations at Shasta Dam.

==Construction==

===Preparations and camps===
The groundbreaking and official naming ceremony of Shasta Dam occurred on September 12, 1937 in the small town of Kennett shortly upstream of the dam. Congress initially approved $12 million for the project. Within five years Kennett would be submerged under the rising waters of Shasta Lake. The dam was initially known as Kennett Dam, but was eventually named after nearby Mount Shasta. After surveying several nearby sites, the Bureau of Reclamation chose to build the dam in a deep canyon about a mile above the abandoned smelter town of Coram and two-and-a-half miles below Kennett. The dam was planned to be over high. The winning bid of $35,939,450 for construction came from Pacific Constructors Inc., a conglomerate of twelve smaller companies.

Construction started with the excavation of millions of tons of bedrock from the canyon walls adjacent to the construction site, forming keyways for the dam foundations. The Shasta Route of the Southern Pacific Railroad and U.S. Highway 99 (current Interstate 5) were rerouted to the east over the steel truss Pit River Bridge, which remains the tallest combined road and rail bridge in the world. The bridge was built to a height of more than above the Pit River, some east-northeast of the dam site, to accommodate the rising waters of Shasta Lake. The bypassed segment of the railroad from Redding to the Shasta site was re-appropriated as a branch line for construction trains, and was routed through a tunnel beneath the south abutment of the dam.

Reclamation originally planned to set up the construction headquarters in Redding, but ultimately decided to move it closer to the dam site. The new company town, Toyon, was laid out on a farm purchased from Porter Seaman in 1938. Toyon served purely to provide housing for Reclamation personnel, government offices, and storage; no stores or restaurants were permitted within its boundaries. Instead of the tents and shacks typical of construction workers&#x27; camps, the town was characterized by comfortable multi-room wooden houses.
Pacific Constructors set up its main camp, called &quot;Contractor&#x27;s Camp&quot; or &quot;Shasta Dam Village&quot;, near the base of the Shasta Dam site. The company built a 2,000-man mess hall, hospital, recreation center and other amenities at the dam site. Three other makeshift camps nearby, called &quot;Central Valley&quot;, &quot;Project City&quot;, and &quot;Summit City&quot;, soon filled with unemployed men from all over the state hoping to get jobs at Shasta Dam.

===Foundations===

In November 1938, construction started on a diversion channel that would shunt water to the east (left) side of the river so the foundations could be laid on the west side. The left bank of the river was widened and deepened using explosives, and a cofferdam was built to dry up the bypassed section. To supply sand and gravel to make concrete at the construction site, Pacific Constructors built the largest conveyor belt system in the world, long, that reached from Redding to the dam site. This was capable of transporting 1,100 tons of material per hour, and over the entire construction process, hauled more than 12 million tons of rock. The belt, which had some 16,000 rollers, was divided into 26 sections, 23 of which were powered by individual motors. The remaining three were downhill and did not require power; in fact they were retrofitted to generate power for some of the other sections.

As the foundations were completed, concrete placement of the main dam body could begin. For this purpose, a system of steel cable towers was erected to carry the steel concrete-pouring buckets. The tower setup comprised one main tower, standing high from its foundations and above the river, and seven movable auxiliary towers; cables were strung from the top of the main tower to each of the others. Using this system, construction crews were able to transport concrete from the mixing plant, which lay directly adjacent to the main tower at the end of the conveyor belt, to the rising structure of the dam faster and cheaper than any other method. The tower was not fully demolished, so it remains submerged behind the dam. On occasion, the lake level can drop low enough to expose it again.

===Concrete placement and river diversion===
Building of the dam&#x27;s main concrete structure started in July 1940 after the cable systems had been completed and the mixing plant came on line. Steel buckets capable of carrying of concrete, weighing 16 tons when full, traveled back and forth along the lines. For three years, thousands of men labored building the dam&#x27;s massive abutments, pouring concrete into large modular &quot;blocks&quot; square and deep. These blocks were shaped using wooden forms, which were removed when the concrete cured and rebuilt to handle the next block above it. The concrete was &quot;vibrated&quot; into place using specialized equipment, which filled in any accidental cavities and bubbles to ensure maximum density and strength. After the concrete cured, the surface was cleaned and smoothed by sandblasting. At the same time, the railroad that ran through the temporary tunnel on the west side of the river was rerouted.

In December 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to enter into World War II. With thousands of men enlisting in the armed forces, the Shasta Dam site soon had a severe labor shortage. During the war years, many of the people who worked at the dam were women and high school students, working on mostly &quot;non-hazardous jobs&quot;. The dam played an important part in World War II even before its completion, supplying much-needed electricity to shipyards and aircraft factories in central California. However, some generators originally intended for Shasta ended up in the Grand Coulee Dam in northern Washington because of the enormous demand for electricity from that dam to power aluminum smelters in the Northwest. The strained supplies and labor forced Reclamation to cut the final height of the dam from to .

With the tunnel cleared, it was resurfaced and modified to accommodate the force of a river instead of a railroad. Until this time, the Sacramento River had still been flowing through the middle of the dam site, between the two nearly completed abutments of the dam. An earth/rock filled cofferdam was constructed across the river, which now began to flow through the tunnel, drying out the dam site and enabling work to begin on the middle section of the dam, which contained the spillway bays. The spillways with their 18 high-pressure river outlet valves and massive triple drum gates were completed in the summer of 1943. By then, a total of 15 million tons of concrete had been used in the dam&#x27;s construction, comprising the 16,900 50-foot blocks.

===Completion===

Water storage at the Shasta Dam began in February 1944 when the diversion tunnel was sealed. As the lake rose behind it, the dam was completed to its final shape and the last bucket of concrete was poured on January 2, 1945. During this time, the Shasta Dam powerplant, with a capacity of 379 MW, was also under construction. Five steel penstocks, each in diameter, were installed to provide water to drive the turbines in the power station. The powerhouse was a reinforced concrete structure standing above the river; electricity was first generated there in 1944. The dam was completed at the dawn of 1945.

When Shasta was completed, it was the second highest dam in the world – surpassed only by Hoover Dam on the Colorado – as well as the highest man-made structure in California. It was also the second most massive concrete dam measured by volume, exceeded only by Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River in Washington. An anonymous workman reportedly said, &quot;Old Shasta&#x27;s about the secondest dam there is.&quot; When the dam was completed, chief engineer Frank Crowe is known to have declared, &quot;Look at that Shasta Dam. That dam will stand there forever holding back the river. And that powerhouse will keep right on turning out juice until somebody discovers how to make power out of sunlight.&quot;

==Design and operations==
Shasta Dam serves mainly to provide flood control and carryover water storage for the dry season, contributing greatly to irrigation in the Sacramento Valley and navigation on the Sacramento River, as well as keeping freshwater levels in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta high enough for diversion into the California Aqueduct and Delta-Mendota Canal. The dam&#x27;s other major purpose is to generate hydroelectricity. With a hydraulic head of , the dam is capable of generating 676 megawatts (MW) from five turbines – a pair of 125 MW units and three 142 MW units. Each of the turbines is driven by a high-pressure jet of water fed by a steel penstock in diameter. Two smaller turbines generate power for operations at the dam itself. The plant serves to generate peaking power for the northern Sacramento Valley. Keswick Dam, about downstream, serves as an afterbay for Shasta, regulating its fluctuating water releases.

A gravity structure, the dam stands above the foundations with a maximum height of above the river. It is long, with a maximum thickness of ; altogether the dam contains of material. The dam can release floodwaters through a system of eighteen outlet valves on the face of the spillway. These valves are arranged in three levels, each cutting through the main dam structure and discharging onto the face of the spillway. The upper level has six outlets, each with a capacity of . The middle layer has eight conduits capable of carrying and the lowest has four exits each able to discharge for a total of . The spillway is a massive concrete chute, long and wide, controlled by three -wide drum gates each weighing 500 US tons (454 t). When the reservoir is full, the gates cannot entirely prevent leakage but can raise the water level up to above the spillway crest. The spillway has a capacity of , bringing the dam&#x27;s maximum overflow rate to .
The dam forms a reservoir called Shasta Lake, which is the largest man-made lake and third largest body of water in California with its capacity of and surface area of at maximum pool. The lake extends for up the Sacramento River and branches for more than up the Pit River, which is actually the largest river flowing into the lake. Shasta Lake also has arms of the McCloud River, Squaw Creek, Salt Creek, and scores of other smaller streams that feed it. Shasta Dam controls runoff from a drainage basin of , or about a quarter of the Sacramento River watershed.

==Future expansion==

In the 1990s, with skyrocketing water shortages in the Central Valley and some of California&#x27;s largest agricultural coalitions including the Westlands Water District calling for a more dependable water supply, the Bureau of Reclamation suggested the expansion of Shasta Dam. The expansion is considered feasible because the dam&#x27;s foundations were originally built to carry the weight of an structure, but resources shortages at the onset of World War II prevented completing it to that final design height.

Reclamation has suggested three options for the dam raise, ranging from less than to more than . The &quot;low option&quot;, which simply comprises adding a vertical concrete dike to the top of the dam, would provide maximum additional storage while minimizing requirements for reconstruction of buildings and facilities around Shasta Lake. The &quot;intermediate option&quot; would require adding more than to the crest and replacing the elevator towers on the front of the dam, and the Pit River Bridge and small towns around the lake, if not modified or moved, would be inundated. Finally, the &quot;high option&quot; would raise the dam over , tripling the volume and doubling the surface area of the reservoir. Both the intermediate and high options would require saddle dams constructed at key points along the lake to keep it from overflowing.

The intermediate and high dam raises would allow for increased generation of hydropower. Each would require the construction of a new powerhouse to accommodate five new turbines; for the intermediate expansion, five 215-MW generators would be added for a total capacity of 1,751 MW, while for the high one, there would be five new 260-MW units for a maximum capacity of 1,976 MW. Downstream Keswick Dam would also be raised and its power station retrofitted to accommodate the greater peaking releases from Shasta.

The proposed dam raise has met with significant backlash from area inhabitants, fishermen, Native Americans, recreationalists and environmentalists. First of all, with any increase to the dam&#x27;s height, significant reaches of the Pit, Sacramento, and McCloud Rivers would be inundated. The McCloud is an area of special interest because it is one of California&#x27;s best trout fisheries and because many sacred Native American sites lie along its banks. Opponents of dam raise contend that it would cost more (starting with replacing over 600 structures that would be inundated under the lake including the Pit River Bridge) than its benefits. The water supplied from such a raise would be costly and could be saved if Central Valley farmers cut their water use by only a fraction. It would result in more problems for the ecology of the lower Sacramento, not least its dying salmon runs.

One of the most important points made by dam expansion opponents is that raising the dam will not create more water (in fact it will actually cause some water loss due to evaporation) but merely increases the capacity to store it. As a result, the reservoir will rarely be filled, as no matter how much Reclamation expands the dam, the river&#x27;s flow will not increase. The cost of the dam raise is projected at $500 million-$1 billion. One of the expansion&#x27;s most staunch opponents is the Winnemem Wintu tribe, almost all of whose land was inundated by the construction of Shasta Dam. Raising the dam would destroy much of their little remaining land.

Some progress has been made towards the dam expansion including for the completion of a costly EIR (Environment Impact Report) by the Bureau of Reclamation – and the purchase of over of land along the McCloud River by Westlands Irrigation District to help the Bureau gain rights to expand the dam; Westlands believes that the added storage of the dam would greatly benefit its farmers. As of 2007, the irrigation district has spent $35 million. However, Westlands has had a spotty record with environmental responsibility and has been criticized by environmentalists for high levels of pesticide and selenium in the toxic runoff waters from farms operating under the district.

In November 2020, the Trump Administration released the Shasta Lake Water Resources Investigation Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement to increase water storage capacity in Shasta Lake by 634,000 acre-feet, or more than 200 billion gallons.

===Potential geologic hazards===
In a draft geologic technical report prepared pursuant to the planning for modifications of Shasta Dam, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation cites (p. 27) six types of geologic hazards that have the potential to occur within the project area: seismic hazards, volcanic eruptions and associated hazards, mudflows, snow avalanches, slope instability, and seiches. Seismic hazards stem from the proximity of several fault zones, the nearest being the Battle Creek Fault Zone located approximately 27 miles south of the dam and capable of producing a 7.3 magnitude event. Volcanic hazards are Mount Shasta, Mount Lassen, and the Medicine Lake Highlands.

==Criticism==

===Ecological effects===

The Shasta Dam has had a severe negative effect on populations of Pacific salmon in the Sacramento River watershed ever since its gates were first closed in 1943. The massive structure completely prevents salmon migration from the lower reaches of the river to the Upper Sacramento, Pit, McCloud and other tributary streams. It is estimated that half of the best salmon habitat in the Sacramento basin lies upstream of Shasta Dam. Also, the dam caused temperatures in the river to rise because it released waters from higher elevations of Shasta Lake, which are warmed by the sun far more than the surface of the original river pre-dam. Warm waters are harmful to salmon, which prefer colder temperatures, and also impact other fish populations such as steelhead and wild California trout.

In an attempt to save the plunging salmon populations, the federal government constructed the Coleman National Fish Hatchery on Battle Creek in 1942. The hatchery is situated approximately southeast of Redding, and produces 13,850,000 eggs per year – nearly 87 percent of which are for the fall chinook salmon run. Another remedy was carried out by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1991, with the installation of a gigantic facility called a TCD (Temperature Control Device) on the rear face of Shasta Dam. This structure enables dam operators to decide the depth of the reservoir from which the water feeding into the penstocks originates. As one progresses deeper into Shasta Lake, the water gets colder where it receives less sunlight. The TCD is equipped with fifteen openings called &quot;shutters&quot; arranged in rows along the back face of the structure. The rows lie , , and above sea level. (The crest of Shasta Dam is at an elevation of .) The system has shown significant success in reducing the temperature of the Sacramento River below the dam, although it does exhibit leakage.

As for the health of the river overall, the dam has indirectly affected it by promoting the growth of cities and farms along it. However, construction of the dam also has had direct consequences to the morphology and vegetation zones along the river. By raising summer flows much higher than their natural average, and moderating the effects of most floods, the post-dam river supplies an even amount of water to the riparian zone each year, and resultantly vegetation has encroached on the river channel. The dam has vastly reduced the amount of sediment in the Sacramento, and the riverbanks now suffer decreased erosion, slowing the growth of meanders and side-channels. Additionally, nearly all the rock and sand used in the mixing of concrete for the dam was dredged from the river downstream of the dam, further depleting its sediment supply.

===Wintu lands===

Underneath the waters of Shasta Lake lie buried the traditional lands of the Winnemem Wintu, one of nine groups of the larger Wintu ethnicity of northern California. The Winnemem Wintu tribe is considered to be a ghost tribe because they are not a federally recognized tribe. It is estimated that the pre-colonization population of the valley was roughly 14,000; by 1900, due to diseases and settlers&#x27; encroachment it was reduced to 395. Of the men who survived out of the 395, many fought in the U.S. armed forces during World War II. When they returned in 1945, they found their family members driven out of their traditional villages by the rising waters of Shasta Lake. More than 90 percent of their original land was lost, and the ten percent that remains now lies along the lower McCloud River.

On May 1 of 1941, the United States Congress passed the Central Valley Project Indian Lands Acquisition Act, to take ownership of the homes and lands of the Winnemem Wintu people. Scores of village sites, burial sites and other sacred locations now sit several hundred feet below the surface of Shasta Lake. Over 27 sacred sites lie underneath the water behind the dam. Tribal members argue that several reservation treaties originally set by the U.S. government in the 1850s were later broken so the filling of Shasta Lake could proceed; afterwards, only a tiny fraction of that land remained theirs. Furthermore, the Winnemem are not recognized by the federal government, an omission that they have been seeking to rectify for over a century. Recently, native hostility to the dam has heightened because of the proposals to raise it – which would drown twenty of the remaining sacred sites, including Children&#x27;s Rock and Puberty Rock, both used in coming-of-age ceremonies, and a burial place for victims of the Kabyai Creek Massacre. The tribe conducted a war dance in September 2004 for the first time in 117 years in opposition of the dam and Reclamation&#x27;s raising project; the event reputedly inspired many environmental groups to support the tribe&#x27;s position.

==Tours and recreation==
Reclamation holds guided tours of the Shasta Dam year round, each taking two to three hours. There also are a visitor center and auditorium. The tours comprise a elevator ride to the base of the dam, and visits to the dam&#x27;s inner galleries and the powerhouse among other areas. Shasta Lake has a surface of at full pool and is surrounded by the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Many public and private marinas, campgrounds, RV parks, resorts and boat launches border the reservoir, one of the most popular recreational lakes in California. Houseboating, water-skiing, swimming and fishing are among the numerous activities available at the lake; hiking, picnicking, mountain biking, hunting and camping are popular in the mountainous vicinity surrounding it.

<text>Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations (OCR) is an examination board which sets examinations and awards qualifications (including GCSEs and A-levels). It is one of England, Wales and Northern Ireland&#x27;s five main examination boards.

OCR is based in Cambridge, with an office in Bourn, Coventry. It is part of the University of Cambridge&#x27;s Cambridge Assessment which merged with Cambridge University Press in August 2021. OCR delivers GCSE and A-Level examinations in the United Kingdom whereas for other countries Cambridge Assessment operates the examination board Cambridge Assessment International Education. An important distinction between the two is that OCR qualifications must comply with UK government regulations set by Ofqual while Cambridge International Examinations international GCSEs and GCE A-Levels do not.

OCR also manages the UK&#x27;s national examination centre registration numbering system on behalf of several Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) member bodies.

== History ==
The name OCR reflects the fact that it was created in 1998 through the amalgamation of the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES) and the Royal Society of Arts Examinations Board (RSAEB). At the time of the merger, UCLES&#x27; qualifications were offered by two wholly owned subsidiaries: the Oxford and Cambridge Examinations and Assessments Council (OCEAC) for A-Level and the Midland Examining Group (MEG) for GCSE and Certificate of Achievement. RSAEB offered vocational qualifications. After the merger, the OCR name replaced all previous names.

UCLES had previously taken over the University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations (founded 1857) and the Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examinations Board (founded 1873). Both were acquired by UCLES in 1995; earlier, it had taken over the Southern Universities Joint Board (SUJB). The acquisition of RSAEB was completed in 1998 and brought a new range of qualifications and activities to the UCLES Group because RSEAB&#x27;s principal activity was in vocational qualifications.

The formation of OCR represented the culmination of several decades of corporate activity on the part of UCLES, activity that came about as a response to the policies of successive British governments towards public examinations and the provision of qualifications, as well as moves to strengthen the regulatory framework.

The following former examination boards are now part of OCR:
* East Anglian Examinations Board (EAEB) – partial
* East Midland Regional Examinations Board (EMREB)
* Midland Examining Group (MEG)
* Oxford and Cambridge Examinations and Assessment Council (OCEAC)
* Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examination Board (OCSEB) / (O&amp;C)
* Royal Society of Arts (RSA)
* Southern Regional Examinations Board (SREB)
* Southern Universities Joint Board for Schools Examinations (SUJB)
* University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES)
* University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations (UODLE)
* The West Midlands Examination Board (WMEB)

Cambridge Assessment is a non-teaching department of the University of Cambridge, making Cambridge the only British university to maintain a direct link with a school exam board. Cambridge Assessment, which celebrated its 160th anniversary in 2018, became part of Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment in August 2021.

==Controversies==
In some of its material, OCR has made mistakes and inaccuracies, sometimes including inaccurate or fictitious content in subject specifications or errors in exam papers. 

1998: All the UK schools examinations and vocational qualifications of the UCLES Group were transferred to OCR. Subsequent Physics syllabuses released by OCR included the fictional units the &quot;Ocrawatt&quot; and &quot;Ocrajoule&quot; due to overzealous find-and-replace on MEG&#x27;s part (in previous and later syllabuses, the units were correctly written as &quot;Megawatt&quot; and &quot;Megajoule&quot;.)

2008: The answer to one question in a GCSE Music paper was given away by accident in the copyright declaration printed on the back of the question paper.

2011: OCR set an impossible maths question in the 2011 AS Mathematics paper. In addition, there were errors in Section B of the Latin Literature paper, confusing names of both authors and characters. 2011 also saw the start of, by now regular, social media protests against the content in exam papers. An A2 Biology paper on Control, Genomes and Environment (F215) had a large emphasis on Ecology, deemed by many students to be &#x27;unfair&#x27;. This issue was made public on a Facebook page which generated support from thousands of students. &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Times Educational Supplement&quot; reported on this story.

2012: A Channel 4 News investigation revealed that examiners were making the most basic errors, such as wrongly adding up marks on hundreds of papers, which in some cases led to candidates in 2011 getting an incorrect grade. A senior supervisor at OCR, David Leitch, ordered his team perform supplementary checks on scripts by the same markers, and found hundreds of errors. This led to OCR ordering these additional checks to stop, and to only inform those schools which had specifically requested scripts to be re-marked. David Leitch was suspended from OCR, after reporting the incident to Ofqual, and informing 30 schools about the mistakes himself. Ofqual have said to have subsequently investigated the exam board, and asked the exam board &quot;to carry out extended checks, identify the weaknesses in its processes and to put these right in time for the January exams&quot;. The Department for Education said the level of error was &quot;simply unacceptable&quot;.

2014: UK exam regulator Ofqual investigated OCR&#x27;s &quot;near miss&quot; on issuing GCSE and A-level results on time.

2015: The then Chief Executive of OCR suggested that students should be allowed to use Google and the Internet to research information during examinations. This statement evoked a heated debate with support on the one hand and criticism on the other.

2017: A question in the reformed OCR GCSE English Literature exam, sat by over ten thousand students, swapped the surnames of the families in the play Romeo and Juliet, asking how Tybalt&#x27;s hatred of the Capulets influenced the outcome of the play, when in fact, Tybalt is a Capulet himself. OCR apologised, undertook to ensure no candidates would be disadvantaged while the regulator Ofqual stated it was &quot;very disappointed to learn of the error&quot;. OCR also apologised for &quot;poorly wording&quot; an A-Level Psychology Paper and assured candidates that it could correct it in its marking. Ofqual asked OCR to go through all its remaining papers again to make sure there were no further errors. OCR was eventually fined £175,000 for their error on the English Literature exam, which Ofqual deemed not fit for purpose, as the question was &quot;unanswerable&quot;.

2019: After a leak of the A-Level Grade Boundaries ahead of results day, it emerged that in order to pass the new specification Mathematics A-Level (H240), candidates needed to score 13% (40 marks out of 300) to pass. Edexcel, another British exam board, also had similarly low grade boundaries. Subsequently, Ofqual said that they were confident the grade boundaries this year were &quot;sound&quot;, so shifted their focus onto the previous year&#x27;s grade boundaries for the new Mathematics A-Level for the 2,000 students who sat it after studying it for one year. Ofqual said &quot;We want to understand why the grade boundaries were so different between the two years.&quot;, and had called the significant shifts in boundaries &quot;unusual&quot;. None of the exam boards decided to re-open the 2018 award, after being asked to look at them again by the regulator.

2023: OCR was criticised by pupils and teachers for the level of difficulty in Paper 2 of the Computer Science GCSE. Students took to social media to express concern at the disparity between Paper 1 and Paper 2, as well as the change in style of the paper. OCR assured students that the final mark scheme would reflect the different approaches taken to the exam, and that the grade boundaries would take into account the challenges faced. They also stated they planned to make it free for schools and colleges to access candidate&#x27;s marked papers.

The exams regulator, the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual), reports on the frequency of errors from all exam boards annually.

<text>James Allen &quot;Candy Jim&quot; Taylor (February 1, 1884April 3, 1948) was an American third baseman and manager in Negro league baseball. In a career that spanned forty years, he played as an infielder in the early years of the 20th century for over a dozen black baseball teams; by the mid-1920s, he would play less regularly (doing so as a pinch hitter), with his final game came at 58. In 1920, the same year of the start of the golden era of Negro league baseball, he would take on the responsibilities of manager, where he would manage 1,967 games for twelve teams. Described as one of the great strategists of his era, Taylor is the all-time winningest manager in the Negro league era, having 955 wins along with two Negro World Series titles and one additional pennant in 27 seasons as manager. He has the most seasons managed by an African American manager along with having the seventh most for a manager in the history of baseball.

==Biography==
Born in Anderson, South Carolina, Taylor was one of four brothers who played in the Negro leagues, along with Ben, C. I. and &quot;Steel Arm&quot; Johnny.

Taylor began playing ball with an amateur club in Anderson, South Carolina in 1901, starting as a catcher.

He played with several different clubs in 1902 and 1903, finally landing a position with the Birmingham Giants in 1904 where he played third base. That year, he played in 55 regular season games and only made three errors.

Taylor continued with Birmingham until 1909, and moved to the St. Paul Colored Gophers for part of a season in 1910. He was named the captain of the team. Later in 1910, he was asked to play for the Chicago Giants, but played instead for the West Baden Sprudels as a player/manager until 1913.

In 1914, he moved to the Indianapolis ABC&#x27;s as a player/manager, and by 1916, he helped the Indianapolis ABC&#x27;s to win the Black World Championship. During the War, Taylor seemed to rotate between three teams, the Indianapolis ABCs, Dayton Marcos, and the Detroit Stars.

In 1918, 34 year-old Taylor registered for the WWI Draft. He lists his current occupation as a &quot;Laborer&quot; for the Penn Freight House at Dela and Georgia Street in Indianapolis, Indiana. Taylor lists his current address as 645 Blackford Street in Indianapolis. He does not list any dependents and lists his closest relative as Charles Isaac Taylor at 446 Indiana Avenue.

When the newly formed Negro National League started in 1920, Candy Jim worked as a player-manager for the Dayton Marcos. But he moved on to the Cleveland Tate Stars in the next season. He also served as a vice chairman for the league during its tenure (his brother C.I. also served as one of the co-founders of the league and vice president).

A disciplinarian and a master strategist, as manager Taylor led the St. Louis Stars to contention in the Negro National League, which coincided with the decision to match first half and second half champions for a Championship Series, starting in 1925 (his third and final season in his first stint). That year, his team won the second half of the season and won the right to be matched against the Kansas City Monarchs. They lost that series four to three. Taylor returned in 1927 to St. Louis and managed them to their first championship in 1928, doing so over the Chicago American Giants five games to four in the Championship Series.

The Great Depression took its toll on the economics of the game, and while managing the 1933 Richmond All-Stars, Taylor was forced to sell the team bus, and later had to send the players home.

In 1943 Taylor took over as manager for the Homestead Grays, which had been led by player-manager Vic Harris. After having won the NNL title for the previous three seasons, the Grays were tasked to try and win it again for the right to advance to the newly created second incarnation of the Negro World Series title. They succeeded in winning the pennant and the World Series, for which they would repeat their success again the following year. Taylor managed in baseball until his death, which involved another stint as manager of the Chicago American Giants from 1945 to 1947. In 27 seasons, he managed eleven teams to a winning record, which saw him win three pennants and finish in second four times. He went 17–17 in postseason games.

==Death and legacy==
Taylor died at age 64 of a heart attack in Chicago and was interred in the Burr Oak Cemetery, Alsip, Illinois. He was buried in an unmarked grave which remained that way for nearly 54 years, until the Negro Leagues Baseball Grave Marker Project raised funds for a proper headstone in 2004.

Taylor managed a variety of black baseball legends in four decades that ranged from Cool Papa Bell to Josh Gibson to Vic Harris while being selected to coach in the East-West All Star Game four times. He has the most wins for all managers in the Negro League era.

<doc id="741521" wikidata="Q5105185" url="?curid=741521" title="Chorlton and the Wheelies">
<text>Chorlton and the Wheelies is an animated children&#x27;s television series that ran from 26 September 1976 until 17 December 1978 on the British television channel ITV. 40 episodes were produced. The show followed the adventures of Chorlton, an anthropomorphic &quot;happiness dragon&quot;, in &quot;Wheelie World&quot; (where people moved on wheels instead of legs).

&quot;Chorlton and the Wheelies&quot; was created by Cosgrove Hall Productions for Thames Television and broadcast on the ITV network.

The eponymous lead character gets his name from the suburb of Manchester in which the Cosgrove Hall studio was based: the legend &quot;Made in Chorlton-cum-Hardy&quot; is found written on the inside of the egg from which he hatches in the very first episode of the series.

==Synopsis==
The series takes place in &quot;Wheelie World&quot;, which is inhabited principally by the &quot;wheelies&quot;, a race of anthropomorphic creatures who locomote by means of wheels. They have three wheels each: two large ones at the front (resembling feet), and a smaller centred one at the back (resembling a tail). The wheels are replaceable, and suitable wheels grow on vegetation found in Wheelie World.

The wheelies are in conflict with Fenella the Kettle Witch, an evil witch who speaks in a very strong Welsh accent and lives in Wheelie World but separately from the wheelies, in Spout Hall, an oversized kettle. Fenella hates happiness, and uses her powers primarily to make the wheelies unhappy. She has magical capabilities, including a form of teleportation which is her main mode of transport, and enchanted assistants including a magic book called &#x27;Claptrap Von Spilldebeans&#x27; (who helps concoct her spells) and O&#x27;Reilly the Telescope, which gives her advice her on magic. Minions include spikers (sinister looking objects like conker shells with baleful eyes, which roll everywhere) and toadies (pointed toadstools with similar eyes, which travel by bobbing through the ground as though it were water and who speak with a Chinese accent).

The wheelies have adopted into their society a &quot;happiness dragon&quot;, Chorlton, who appears in Wheelie World at the very beginning of the series, hatching out of an egg. Chorlton is perpetually good-natured and perpetually clueless. For example, he fails to perceive Fenella as a villain, and affectionately refers to her as a &quot;little old lady&quot;. Nevertheless, his presence negates the unhappiness magic, so the wheelies treat him as a hero. Being &quot;Made in Chorlton-cum-Hardy&quot; (Greater Manchester) he has a strong Lancashire accent.

==Development==
Plots are extremely simple, mainly revolve around Fenella&#x27;s schemes to make the wheelies unhappy and Chorlton&#x27;s accidental rectification of everything that goes wrong. Around these events, the characters&#x27; simple and exaggerated personalities are on show.

The idea of &#x27;wheelies&#x27; came about after the difficulties of moving many different characters using stop-frame animation. Characters on wheels were easier to manipulate than those with legs that needed fractionally moving many times for each second of filming. Similarly, choosing teleportation as Fenella&#x27;s principal means of transportation means that usually Chorlton is the only character whose walking needs to be animated.

The show was sold to numerous countries around the (non-Wheelie) world.

==Characters==
The characters include, amongst others:
*Chorlton the Happiness Dragon - where he goes, happiness follows. He thwarts Fenella&#x27;s evil schemes by accident, and is always apologetic to her afterwards. His catchphrase at the end of every episode is &quot;Bye bye, little old lady!&quot; (addressed to Fenella). He does not understand that the witch is evil.
*Fenella Fellorick, the Kettle Witch - a Welsh witch who does not like anyone to enjoy themselves. She lives in a gigantic kettle called Spout Hall, along with her henchmen Claptrap and O&#x27;Reilly.
*Zoomer - a wheelie boy, notable for his speed of locomotion. He wears an old-fashioned flying cap and goggles.
*Jenny - a wheelie girl with ginger hair and freckles. She fancies Chorlton.
*King Otto and Queen Doris - The monarchy of Wheelieworld. Otto has a huge red nose and a bow tie, while Doris has purple hair and an enormous clown smile.
*The Minister of wheel estate - the political wheelie, who bears a striking resemblance to Harold Wilson, who had recently been Prime Minister of the UK. His real name is revealed to be &quot;Arthur&quot; in season 3.
*Claptrap von Spilldebeans - A German spellbook who often speaks in rhyme and comes up with Fenella&#x27;s schemes.
*O&#x27;Reilly the one eyed telescope - An Irish telescope that Fenella stole from the end of Dún Laoghaire East pier.
*Clifford - A giant, Fenella&#x27;s son and Queenie&#x27;s nephew. He is so tall the only part of him that ever is in shot is his leg.
*Pablo Perdito - A world famous Latin American dancing duck.
*Floyd - The only toady to have pink spots rather than green (first called by name in the series two episode &quot;Toady Trouble&quot; - possible hidden reference to the band Pink Floyd).
*Queenie Fellorick the Pink Suit - Fenella&#x27;s sister, who also does not like anyone to enjoy themselves.

Joe Lynch narrated the show as well as providing all the voices for the characters and the show&#x27;s theme tune was written and sung by Joe Griffiths.

<doc id="741523" wikidata="Q110538" url="?curid=741523" title="Sea Lion Island">
<text>Sea Lion Island () is the largest of the Sea Lion Island Group of the Falkland Islands. It is in area. and lies southeast of Lafonia (East Falkland). It was designated a Ramsar site on 24 September 2001, and as an Important Bird Area (BirdLife International 2006). In 2017 the island was designated as a National Nature Reserve.

==Description==
Sea Lion Island is long from east to west and wide, with cliffs at the south-western point and sandy bays to the east. The highest point at is Bull Hill. East Loafers is the name of the bay on the southern shore. It also has a few ponds, including Beaver and Long Pond. Just to the south is Rum Island, a small seal colony. Other small members of the group are Brandy and Whisky Islands. The geology is mainly sandstone and mudstone, from about 250 million years ago. Some minor fossils have been found.

==History==
Sea Lion Island is the southernmost inhabited island of the Falkland Islands. Only formerly inhabited Beauchene Island is located further south. Sea Lion Island Settlement is the southernmost settlement of the Falkland Islands. The island has an airstrip. Historically, Sea Lion Island was a sheep farm. When the British ship &quot;Viscount&quot; was wrecked in 1892, the wreckage was used to build the farmhouse.

The island was managed as a sheep farm for almost all of the 20th century, but in 1997 all but a small flock of sheep was removed. In 1990, the Clifton family who owned the island, sold it to the Falkland Islands Development Corporation (FIDC). They had planted 60,000 stands of tussac grass. Since then, ecotourism has been the only economic activity. In 1986 FIDC constructed the Sea Lion Lodge, with accommodation for 20 guests. It was prefabricated and flown in kit form to the island by Royal Air Force helicopters and has proved to be a success. It is used by tourists and, since 1996, scientific researchers. Since 2017 the Lodge and island has been under the lease of Wild Falkland Ltd.

There is a memorial to HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot; on Bull Hill in the south of the island.

==Flora and fauna==
Some 56 species of flowering plants have been recorded, including the Fuegian violet which, in the Falklands, is found nowhere else. The island is known for its marine mammals, including breeding colonies of southern sea lions and southern elephant seals, for which the other islands in the group are haul-out sites. Killer whales are seen offshore. , the Elephant Seal Research Group (ESRG) has been tracking the habits of elephant seals at Sea Lion Island.

===Birds===
The Sea Lion Islands Group has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. It is a significant breeding site for a variety of seabirds and other waterbirds including Falkland steamer ducks, ruddy-headed geese, gentoo penguins (2800 pairs), southern rockhopper penguins (480 pairs), Magellanic penguins, southern giant-petrels (25 pairs) and sooty shearwaters. It also supports populations of striated caracaras (10 pairs), blackish cinclodes, Cobb&#x27;s wrens and white-bridled finches.

<doc id="741527" wikidata="Q840453" url="?curid=741527" title="Pulmonata">
<text>Pulmonata or pulmonates is an informal group (previously an order, and before that, a subclass) of snails and slugs characterized by the ability to breathe air, by virtue of having a pallial lung instead of a gill, or gills. The group includes many land and freshwater families, and several marine families.

The taxon Pulmonata as traditionally defined was found to be polyphyletic in a molecular study per Jörger &quot;et al.&quot;, dating from 2010.

Pulmonata are known from the Carboniferous period to the present.

Pulmonates have a single atrium and kidney, and a concentrated symmetrical nervous system. The mantle cavity is on the right side of the body, and lacks gills, instead being converted into a vascularised lung. Most species have a shell, but no operculum, although the group does also include several shell-less slugs. Pulmonates are hermaphroditic, and some groups possess love darts.

==2010 taxonomy==
Jörger &quot;et al.&quot; (2010) analyzed major groups within the Heterobranchia using genetic data and found that Pulmonata as traditionally defined was polyphyletic, for instance some pulmonates were more closely related to Sacoglossa and Acochlidia. They proposed the more inclusive taxon Panpulmonata to unite the clades Siphonarioidea, Sacoglossa, Glacidorboidea, Pyramidelloidea, Amphiboloidea, Hygrophila, Acochlidia and Eupulmonata.

<text>Mailbox Birmingham, also known as The Mailbox, is a mixed-use development located within the city centre of Birmingham, England. It houses British luxury department store chain Harvey Nichols, and the BBC Birmingham studios.

The scheme comprises 689,000 sq. ft. of primarily office space, with ancillary retail and leisure offering, located on a 4.8-acre waterside site. It is home to BBC Birmingham, WSP, Associated Architects, Harvey Nichols, Malmaison Birmingham and other leading stores and restaurants.

The Mailbox is about long from front to back including The Cube. Above the front shops it has an additional six floors which includes a hotel and residential apartments. The Worcester and Birmingham Canal passes along the back with a number of restaurants overlooking. To the front it faces a flyover of the Suffolk Street Queensway road, with an underpass leading to Birmingham New Street railway station.

==History==

Previously the location of a railway goods yard with canal wharves off the Worcester and Birmingham Canal leading to Gas Street Basin, the site was the location of the Royal Mail&#x27;s main sorting office building for Birmingham (hence its current name) which was completed in 1970, replacing the Victorian head post office (now Victoria Square House), in Victoria Square. The new building was designed by R. H. Ousman of the Ministry of Public Building and Works, who collaborated with project architect H. A. E. Giddings and with Hubbard Ford &amp; Partners, who supplied E. Winters and R. Lee as architects. When completed, it was the largest mechanised letters and parcels sorting office in the country with a floor area of and the largest building in Birmingham. A tunnel was authorised by the (c. 25) and constructed under Severn Street between the site and New Street railway station, allowing electric tractors hauling carts carrying sacks of mail to be driven directly to the office. The structure housed the largest electronic sorting equipment in the West Midlands to handle the post. It also housed the administrative teams moved from Victoria Square, including those for other Post Office functions, such as counter services.

The main entrance was located at Blucher Street beneath a tower set between a square block for parcels on the left and a lower block for the letters sorting office on the right. The structure consisted of a steel frame on a square grid with lightweight pre-cast concrete floor slabs and reinforced concrete retaining walls and sub floors. The exterior was clad with cast glass troughs and exposed aggregate panels. Ventilation was provided through air-handling units which provided the building with the temperature it required. Extract fans were also placed on the roof. The exterior consisted mainly of the glass slabs and projecting air handling units with recessed windows.

===Construction===
The Royal Mail sorting office was recognised by Alan Chatham in 1997. Chatham had been an important figure in the regeneration of Birmingham, working with Argent Group to develop Brindleyplace. He found out that the sorting office was to be sold and tried to convince Argent about the potential the building offered if it were to be converted into a mixed-use building. Argent was unconvinced and so Chatham decided to establish his own development company, &quot;Birmingham Development Company&quot;, and purchased the building in 1998 for £3 million. He also paid a further £1 million for the surrounding waterfront buildings. Soon after purchasing the building, he sold the air-rights to Crosby Homes, providing him with further money for redeveloping the building.

The building was converted by the Birmingham Development Company and designed by the RIBA award winning, Birmingham practice, Associated Architects. It was to include two hotels with a total of 300 rooms, 15,850 sq. m (170,000 sg. ft.) of office space, 9,290 sq. m (100,000 sq ft.) of retail space and a similar area for restaurants and a health club. Crosby Homes constructed apartments above the space. The redevelopment of the sorting office involved demolition of all but the steel sub-structure. It cost £150 million overall and opened in December 2000. Following the purchase of two retail units by Harvey Nichols, the development was valued at over £125 million.

A public square the size of Chamberlain Square was created to the front of the Mailbox beneath Suffolk Street Queensway. It was paved with natural stone and as well as being a social area, it was also designed to allow the easy movement of visitors to, from and around the building. The area to the rear of the building is used frequently by the public. At the back of the Mailbox a walkway leads over a bridge and to the canal towpaths near Gas Street Basin. A mixed-use building called the Cube, designed by Birmingham born architect Ken Shuttleworth&#x27;s practice Make Architects with Buro Happold engineers forms the final phase of the Mailbox development and houses a rooftop restaurant, boutique hotel and residential flats.

=== Developments since ===
In 2004, BBC Birmingham moved into a new complex of studios at the Mailbox that replaced the previous Pebble Mill site in Edgbaston. The general public is able to watch radio and television broadcasts being made at an all-access public foyer, as well as surf the BBC website and purchase BBC merchandise. On 31 October 2005, 81-year-old actress Mary Wimbush died at the Mailbox studios shortly after a recording session for &quot;The Archers&quot;. On 16 February 2008, a shooting incident took place at Cafe Lazeez at the Mailbox.

In April 2011 the Mailbox was sold for £127.1 million to a joint venture between Brockton Capital and Milligan.

On 30 May 2013, Milligan Retail announced that the Mailbox would undergo a major renovation, designed by Stirling Prize winners Stanton Williams, which would see a roof installed over the shopping complex&#x27;s atrium. The anchor store, Harvey Nichols, would double in size to over 45,000 sq. ft. It was also announced that Brockton Capital and Milligan would work in co-ordination with Birmingham City Council to improve the public area reaching from the underpass beneath Suffolk Street Queensway to the front of Mailbox. These changes would be implemented to complement the redevelopment of New Street station which will house a full-line John Lewis department store.

On 29 November 2013, it was announced that Everyman Cinemas would take space at the Mailbox, opening a 12,000 sq. ft 3-screen cinema in the latter part of 2014, ahead of the completion of the whole scheme in 2015. L.K.Bennett, Jaeger and Gieves and Hawkes will also open in the redeveloped centre in 2015 whilst an improved way-finding system will be introduced to improve shoppers&#x27; experience.

In August 2022 it was announced that the BBC intends to leave The Mailbox when its current lease comes to an end in 2026.

== IPSX listing ==

In December 2019, Brockton Capital and Milligan sold the Mailbox to M7 Real Estate (&quot;M7&quot;).

In October 2020, M7 announced its intention to float the Mailbox on the International Property Securities Exchange (&quot;IPSX&quot;), making it the first single property REIT to be listed on a dedicated property stock exchange. Shares in Mailbox REIT commenced trading on 14 May 2021.

In April 2022, M7 completed the conversion of level one of the Mailbox from retail into 50,000 sq. ft. of flexible office space, which is now operated by IWG plc under its &quot;Spaces&quot; co-working brand under a new 10 year management agreement. The accommodation has been well received with occupancy in excess of 60% by October 2022.

<text>New Island () is one of the Falkland Islands, lying north of Beaver Island. It is from Stanley and is long with an average width of . The highest point is . The northern and eastern coasts have high cliffs but the eastern coasts are lower lying, with rocky shores and sandy bays. There are several smaller offshore islands in the group; North Island and Saddle Island have high cliffs but Ship Island and Cliff Knob Island are lower lying.

Long used as a base for whaling, as a sheep farm and for occasional attempts to collect guano, New Island is considered by some to be one of the most beautiful islands in the Falklands archipelago, as well as having possibly the most diverse range of wildlife in the region. It is a nature reserve, established by Ian Strange in 1972.

A settlement lies in the middle of the east coast of the island, some distance north of an airstrip.

==History==
New Island was one of the earliest of the Falkland Islands to be colonised, and American whalers may have arrived as early as the 1770s. Two place names on or near the island, Coffin&#x27;s Harbour and Coffin&#x27;s Island, commemorate the Coffin family of Nantucket. Nearby Quaker, Barclay, Fox and Penn islands reflect the New England and Quaker provenance of some of the earliest settlers.

In 1813, Captain Charles H. Barnard, from Nantucket, was marooned with his crew on the island. They survived on the island for two years, and constructed a crude stone building, which is probably incorporated into the Barnard Building, the oldest standing building in the Falklands and now a museum restored in 2006. In December 1814 H.M.S. &quot;Indispensable&quot;, William Buckle, master, and &quot;Asp&quot;, John Kenny, master, rescued them.

In 1823, Antarctic explorer Captain James Weddell anchored at the island, and commented on its excellent harbours and its natural food and water supplies. In the 1850s and 60s, the island&#x27;s guano deposits were mined.
The Norwegian whaling company &quot;Ørnen&quot;, controlled by Christen Christensen of Sandefjord, sent the first modern floating whaling factory, &quot;Admiralen&quot;, to New Island in 1905. The vessel arrived on 24 December, but during one month of operation only 40 whales (24 fin, 12 sei, 3 sperm, and 1 humpback) were caught. &quot;Admiralen&quot; proceeded to Admiralty Bay in the South Shetland Islands to look for blue and right whales, thus becoming the first floating factory to operate in the Antarctic.

From 1908, the Scottish company Chr. Salvesen operated a land based whaling station under the name &quot;New Whaling Company&quot;. A transport vessel and a whale catcher arrived on 22 December and brought a decommissioned land station from Fáskrúðsfjörður in Iceland. The first whale was caught on 16 January 1909, with 226 whales (215 sei) being caught the first season. Results were unsatisfactory though, with the station last operating in 1915. Of the reported catch, over 900 were sei whales (about two-thirds of the total). Remains of the station is still visible.

The island holds the shipwreck of a sealing vessel, the &quot;Protector III&quot;, which beached in 1969. &quot;Protector III&quot; was built in 1942, and was one of 12 minesweepers constructed for the Royal Navy by the Wagstaff Hatfield Shipyard in Port Greville, Nova Scotia. The vessel served the navy until the end of World War 2, when it was sold to Italy in 1946. The Italians then sold it to sealers in 1955, who took the &quot;Protector III&quot; to the Falklands.

==Ownership==
From 1996 to 2020 the island was owned and run by The New Island Conservation Trust which acquired the freehold of the entire property in 2005. The Trust was managed by a Board of Trustees under the Chairmanship of Air Vice-Marshal David Crwys-Williams CB, a former Commander of the British Forces, Falkland Islands, in the 1980s. The major benefactor to the Trust has been the Geoffrey C Hughes Charitable Trust which not only made the purchase possible, but also funded the well-equipped Field Centre used as a base for teams of wildlife researchers from many different countries. In 2020 the Trust merged with Falklands Conservation, and the combined organisation now oversees and manages New Island for conservation and as a tourist destination.


==Wildlife==
The island is largely vegetated with grasses; there are no native trees, though shrubs have been introduced. Wildlife includes South American fur seals and southern sea lions. There are no native land mammals though the island contains a population of introduced cottontail rabbits (&quot;Sylvilagus sp.&quot;). Resident pods of Peale&#x27;s dolphins frequent the bays of New Island and Southern Elephant seals are occasionally found here but do not breed.

===Birds===
The New Island group has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). Birds for which the site is of conservation significance include Falkland steamer ducks, ruddy-headed geese, gentoo penguins (ca. 6600 breeding pairs), southern rockhopper penguins (ca. 13,000 pairs), Magellanic penguins, black-browed albatrosses (ca. 29,000 pairs), thin-billed prions, white-chinned petrels, imperial shags, striated caracaras, white-bridled finches, blackish cinclodes and Cobb&#x27;s wrens. It is also home to dolphin gulls, Falkland skuas, upland geese and long-tailed meadowlarks amongst other species.

<text>Datastorm is a horizontally scrolling shooter for the Amiga published by Visionary Design in 1989. Written by Søren Grønbech, it was inspired by the &quot;Defender&quot; arcade video game and the &quot;Defender&quot;-like &quot;Dropzone&quot; originally released for Atari 8-bit computers.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Datastorm&quot; allows for a single player to play or two players to play simultaneously or one after the other. The game takes place on planets in a side scrolling format that wraps around with the player flying above in a spacecraft. The player must protect and rescue the eight survival pods that roll around on the surface of the planet and take them to a warp gate. An onslaught of enemies attempt to attack the spaceship so constantly destroying them and their missiles is necessary. There is also a special type of enemy called an alien lander that captures the pods and whisks them away to the top of the level. In addition to standard enemies, there are also mother ships, which act as bosses within the game. These mother ships come in the form of a fleet of fast luminous ships, a large squid or a large skull.

A radar scanner, which is essentially a mini-map, is presented along the bottom of the screen and gives a complete view of the entire planet to help keep track of what is happening. The game also features an autosave, a highscore table, on-screen instructions and a level select. In terms of weaponry, the ship has lasers, smart bombs and cloaking technology that makes it briefly invincible. The points increase for each level; on levels 5, 9, 13, etc, the player gets a new set of eight pods and the scoring resets.

== Plot ==
The game takes place after the planet Xerxes exploded, causing its eight orbiting colonies to drift into deep space. The inhabitants of these colonies must locate a new home planet, so they each send a survival pod out into space to achieve this mission. 

==Release==
The game was announced in May 1989.

==Reception==

Julian Rignall, writing for &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; in 1989, called &quot;Datastorm&quot; &quot;the best shoot &#x27;em up yet seen out of a coin-op cabinet.&quot; The overall review score was 95%.

<doc id="741544" wikidata="Q138274" url="?curid=741544" title="135 Hertha">
<text>135 Hertha is an asteroid from the inner region of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. Discovered on 18 February 1874 by German–American astronomer Christian Peters at the Litchfield Observatory near Clinton, New York, it was named after the Teutonic and Scandinavian goddess of fertility, Hertha, also known as Nerthus. It orbits among the Nysa asteroid family, but its classification as a metallic M-type asteroid does not match the more common F-type asteroid for this family, suggesting that it may be an interloper. Spectroscopic analysis indicates the possible presence of hydrated silicates indicating that &quot;Hertha&quot; should possibly be reclassified from its present M-type to the proposed W-type.

Lightcurve data from &quot;Hertha&quot; indicates a flattened body, and radar observations indicate that &quot;Hertha&quot; is non-metallic. Five occultations of stars by the asteroid have been observed between 2000 and 2015.

== Discovery ==
&quot;Hertha&quot; was discovered by C. H. F. Peters on 18 February 1874, in Clinton, New York. Further observations were carried out in 1883 by W. T. Sampson and communicated to Astronomische Nachrichten on his behalf by Rear Admiral R. W. Shufeldt.

== Physical properties ==
After its discovery in 1874, subsequent observations in 1884 established &quot;Hertha&quot; orbit. Astronomers then began investigation of its physical properties. As early as 1904, G. W. Hill reported observations of &quot;Hertha&quot; brightness indicating a variation of half a magnitude and a short period.

In October 1992 Dotto &quot;et al.&quot; performed 20 hours of observations spread over 6 nights to investigate &quot;Hertha&quot; rotational period, approximate shape, and the coordinates of its rotational axis. They were able to confirm a rotational period of 8.398 ± .001 hours as previously measured by Harris &quot;et al.&quot; published earlier in 1992. In the same study, Dotto &quot;et al.&quot; measured the asteroid&#x27;s shape and rotational axis. The axes&#x27; ratios were found to be: a/b = 1.34 ± .03 and b/c = 1.22 ± .05. Two possible values were determined for the rotational axis, however further measurements at different ecliptic longitudes are required to determine which is correct.

In August 2003 Torppa &quot;et al.&quot; published their results on the shape and rotational properties of a number of asteroids, including &quot;Hertha&quot;. Utilizing data from 42 lightcurves of &quot;Hertha&quot; spanning from 1978 to 2002, a more refined set of axes&#x27; ratios was obtained and a detailed shape model was obtained through inversion. New values for the axes&#x27; ratios are: a/b = 1.1 and b/c = 1.5. Measurements of the pole direction were also obtained, however like Dotto &quot;et al.&quot; they were unable to differentiate between their two possible solutions of (β=+58°, λ=96°) and (β=+53°, λ=274°).

In 2017, Hanuš &quot;et al.&quot; confirmed that the correct solution is β=°, λ=°. They also calculated the first non-convex shape model, based on lightcurve and stellar occultation data.

=== Spectral classification ===
Although &quot;Hertha&quot; has long been classified as an M-type asteroid based on its spectral properties, observations carried out by Rivkin &quot;et al.&quot; in 1996 using the IRTF at Mauna Kea Observatory have raised the possibility of reclassification. The presence of a dip in the observed spectrum at 3 μm indicates that the surface is hydrated, suggesting that &quot;Hertha&quot; should be reclassified as a W-type (a &quot;wet M-type&quot;) asteroid. Based on work carried out by Salisbury and Walter, the Rivkin study estimated the water content of the asteroid to be between 0.14 and 0.27 percent by mass. This estimate is based on laboratory measurements and may not be applicable to asteroids in space.

A more recent study by Rivkin &quot;et al.&quot; published in 2002 examined the dependence of spectral absorption on the asteroid&#x27;s rotational phase. The study looked at the 0.7 μm band, which is also associated with hydrated silicates, and found that the reflectance changes as the asteroid rotates, suggesting that the surface is heterogeneous with some hydrated areas intermixed with dry areas.

== Asteroid family ==
&quot;Hertha&quot; is one of the core members of the Nysa family (405) also known as Herta family. The Nysa–Polana complex is the main-belt&#x27;s largest grouping of asteroids with nearly 20,000 members.

<doc id="741546" wikidata="Q1890823" url="?curid=741546" title="West Point Island">
<text>West Point Island (originally known as [[Albatross]] Island; ) is one of the Falkland Islands, lying in the north-west corner of the archipelago. It has an area of and boasts some of the most spectacular coastal scenery in the Falklands. The island is owned by Roddy &amp; Lily Napier and run as a sheep farm and tourist attraction.

==Description==

West Point Island lies off the north-west point of West Falkland. It is long with a maximum width of . Its dramatic west-facing cliffs are the highest in the Falklands, with the highest point at Cliff Mountain rising to . West Point Island Settlement, with its airstrip, lies on Westpoint Cove in the north-east. It is separated from West Falkland by a narrow channel called the Wooly Gut, which is a local reference to katabatic winds that often occur there. It lies south-east of the Jason Islands, the nearest being South Jason Island.

==History==
As with many locations around the Falkland Islands, in the early 19th century West Point was a popular site for slaughtering seals and penguins for oil. Literal overkill ended this industry in the area. The island was established as a sheep farm in 1879 by Arthur Felton, great uncle of Roddy Napier, the present owner.

==Tourism==
In February 1968, the late Lars-Eric Lindblad brought the Chilean government vessel &quot;Navarino&quot; to the Falklands with the first cruise tourists. This is widely recognized as the birth of Falklands tourism. The &quot;Navarino&quot; visited West Point Island and Mr. Lindblad started a long, close friendship with the Napier family. He also fell in love with their island and over the following 25 years helped turn it into one of the most popular cruise ship destinations outside the capital Port Stanley. Today West Point receives many expedition vessels every summer, their passengers taking Zodiacs and tenders ashore to explore this magnificent island. Large colonies of Black-browed albatrosses and Southern Rockhopper penguins, and the highest sea cliffs in the Falklands are the main attraction. Legendary West Point hospitality also awaits.

==Flora and fauna==
The Falklands endemic Felton&#x27;s flower, which was named after the current owner&#x27;s great uncle who discovered it, occurs in relative abundance. The island gardens have a fairly wide selection of introduced plants including roses, foxgloves, daisies, red hot pokers etc. Unusually for the Falklands, there are also a few trees.

The West Point Island group, which includes nearby Gibraltar Rock, Low Island and Dunbar Island, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). Birds for which the site is of conservation significance include Falkland steamer ducks, ruddy-headed geese, southern rockhopper penguins, Magellanic penguins, black-browed albatrosses, striated caracaras, blackish cinclodes, Cobb&#x27;s wrens and white-bridled finches. The waters around the islands are home to Commerson&#x27;s dolphins.

<text>Pebble Mill Studios was the BBC&#x27;s television studio complex located in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England, United Kingdom, which served as the headquarters for BBC Birmingham from 1971 until 2004. The nine-acre site was opened by Princess Anne on 10 June 1971, and in addition to the studios contained two canteens, a post office, gardens, a seven-storey office block, and an outside broadcasting (OB) base.

As well as being the home of &quot;Midlands Today&quot; and BBC Radio WM, programmes produced at Pebble Mill included &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot;, &quot;The Archers&quot;, &quot;Top Gear&quot;, &quot;Doctors&quot;, &quot;Telly Addicts&quot;, &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot;, &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot; and &quot;Gardeners&#x27; World&quot;.

Pebble Mill Studios closed in 2004 and was demolished in September 2005; BBC Birmingham is now located in The Mailbox shopping complex in Birmingham city centre.

==Early history==

In the 1950s, BBC Midlands was based in offices on Carpenter Road, Edgbaston. The news studio was in a separate building in Broad Street, which remained in operation until 1971. In the same complex, the studios also recorded drama productions in the former Delicia Cinema in Gosta Green. Over time, these studios were too small for the expanding region and were hampered by being spread out across Birmingham.

A change in BBC policy created the BBC Regions, based in Manchester, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow and Belfast. These locations were created as &#x27;National Production Centres&#x27;, to produce television and radio productions for the areas in which they covered. Pebble Mill was designed to be an addition to London&#x27;s Wood Lane Television Centre (TVC or TC).

The lease for the site was acquired from the Calthorpe Estate on a peppercorn rent by the BBC. Plans for Pebble Mill were approved in 1967. This followed construction of the studios, which was designed by John Madin, founder of the John Madin Design Group.

The site was built by Taylor Woodrow Construction.

==Television facilities==

The original plan was to have a light entertainment studio (A) a regional news studio (B) and a drama studio (C) which was to be similar in size to TC6 at Television Centre.

===Studio A===

Studio A was the main studio (78 ft × 71 ft within fire lanes) in size, with three separate control rooms looking onto the studio floor: a production gallery, a joint vision/lighting gallery and sound control gallery.

The studio opened with EMI 2001 cameras and was host to many programmes from London and locally produced programmes. Around 1982 the studios were rebuilt with more modern equipment and A was equipped with Link Electronics Ltd five 125 colour cameras and a pair of Ikegami HL79D portable cameras. The studio also found itself with a Grass valley Group 1600 series vision mixer and a Rank Strand Galaxy lighting console.

During the early 1990s, the BBC technical resource department toured the UK&#x27;s other BBC, ITV and Channel 4 studios to find new cameras to replace the ageing Link Electronics Ltd 125 colour cameras. Sony Broadcast BVP-370 and 70Isp&#x27;s were chosen following a side-by-side shoot-out from all the big-name manufacturers and against the advice of the London head of engineering. Also, during this period all asbestos was removed from the studio, gallery spaces and the air plant.

In November 1997, work began again on a major refurbishment of the studio, which included a production control room and a re-equipped sound control room. This £2.2 million upgrade took nine weeks and Studio A re-opened by the end of February 1998 as a fully digital widescreen facility – one of the first in the BBC.

===Studio B===

Studio B was for local news and sport programmes and was 40 × 25 ft in size. It had a combined control gallery with lighting, vision, production and sound all sited next to each other. This studio was used primarily for &quot;Midlands Today&quot; but also produced &quot;Network East&quot; and other regional programmes.
Studio B was located on the first floor looking out over the central quadrangle. There was a cargo lift close to the studio doors but there was a very tight right-angle turn to get into the studio.

Next to the studio was the presentation suite that was used for short morning and evening news opt-outs. Originally control facilities were provided by Studio B&#x27;s galleries but in the early 1990s a new presentation suite was built into spare space and provided an island studio with its own full production/lighting/sound control gallery.

===Studio C (proposed)===
Part of the original plan for the complex was for a second large Drama Studio with the same size as Television Centre&#x27;s TC6 Studio. It would have had dimensions of 70 feet by 92 feet. It was intended to have it sit next to Studio A with the original TAR (Technical Apparatus Room)/Dimmer Room separating them and a slightly wider scenic workshop behind. 
When the circular multi-story car park, with its entrance from Bristol Road, got axed due to costs the BBC had decided not to add the extra studio space as well.

===The Foyer/Studio C===

The studio complex was originally intended to have a third &#x27;drama&#x27; studio – but this never materialised. Instead, the main foyer became Studio C, as space was needed for the daytime magazine programme &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot;.

The new studio was built into the real life &#x27;foyer&#x27; which had to have its suspended ceiling removed and a scaffold lighting rig installed. Audience seating replaced the reception desk and interview seating installed by the main windows. &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot; ended in 1986 but in 1988 its almost identical replacement &quot;Daytime Live&quot; was launched. It used the same format as &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot; and used similar content.

In 1992, &quot;Good Morning with Anne and Nick&quot; (Anne Diamond and Nick Owen, both former TV-am presenters) replaced &quot;Daytime Live&quot;. Construction of a conservatory studio within the courtyard area was completed and was used for cooking items and interviews. The series ended in 1996 and Nick Owen became the main anchor on &quot;Midlands Today&quot;.

The daytime drama series &quot;Doctors&quot; was made between 2000 and 2004. The windows of the foyer were blacked out which was used to record the series; by then Studio A had closed. &quot;Doctors&quot; also used an additional space – radio Studio 1.

===Presentation Suite===

Next door to Studio B was the presentation suite that was used for short morning and evening news opt-outs. It could be entered directly by either a door from Studio B or from the outside corridor.
Original control facilities were provided by Studio B&#x27;s galleries but in the 1980s re-fit it gained its own control console and lighting. In the early 1990s a new presentation suite was built into spare space next pres. and provided an island studio with its own full production/lighting/sound control gallery and could operate a full daytime programme lineup of Studio B, C and Pres.

===CAR/TAR (Central Apparatus Room/Technical Apparatus Room)===

During the 1970s until the general refit in 1983 TAR was part of the technical rooms suite on the first floor adjoining Studio A. (This was to be the central technical link between Studio A and the original planned Studio C) This area housed the &#x27;Line Up&#x27; desks for Studio A and B, as well as a maintenance area, the dimmer room for the studio production lighting systems and TV signal generation equipment.

When the 1983 refit began it was decided that a Central area should be built combining both Studio A and B&#x27;s island desks and the new Studio C area. The new CAR/TAR was in the comms area which had shrunk due to new technology making switching even more compact. Around the late 1980s early 1990s Comms Centre moved again giving Services Department a new centralised service centre in the old vacant comms centre. The new services area contained work benches for all the disciplines (Comms, VT, camera, Vision and Lighting control), a camera test area and a small mechanical workshop (situated just above the north riser with Studio C directly below. Any work in the workshop had to stop during programmes as noise would travel straight into the foyer).

===Rehearsal space===

At the rear of the Outside Broadcast (OB) base was a small studio space called BORIS. This space was used as a rehearsal room and for a brief period of time using Studio C&#x27;s gallery, was used for the early Sunday morning &quot;Farming&quot; programme which later on became &quot;Countryfile&quot;, presented by John Craven who had just stopped presenting &quot;Newsround&quot; and latterly as office space and storage.

===Green room===

The green room was part of an extension into open space by the driveway to the rear car park. This new extension included workshop space for the TV lighting department, an extension to the graphics department, production design and the green room for the daytime programmes produced at Pebble Mill.

==Post production, design, costume and make-up==

===Post production===
The centre was also home to the largest and most advanced BBC post-production departments outside London, including six VT edit suites, two dubbing suites, a small viewing screen and a multitude of Avid non-linear suites. Following the 1983 refit a vast Graphics centre was opened in the old site of TAR and contained Aston caption generators, Rank Cintel Slide Files, Quantel Paintbox and Harry&#x27;s and other graphic systems.

===Costume===
The Wardrobe/Costume department had its home in the studios central basement area just below the long glazed front window. There was a large work room with another work room containing cutting tables and sewing machines. There was also an office with several dressing rooms either side. There were also several large extras dressing rooms in the basement.

===Design===
Production Design Department had design offices in the central tower block until moving in the early 1990s to a new extension on spare land (originally intended for the early Light Entertainment Studio C) next to the road to the rear car park.

There were offices and work rooms for set and prop design located to the rear of the extension near to the construction workshop. On the ground floor were several props cages which contained all manner of items, even a Dalek.

===Make-up===
Make-up had a large purpose-built complex on the ground floor next to Studio A. With seating for 6 people and small office space at one end of the glassed gallery at the front of the building.

==Communications and signals==
Pebble Mill formed part of the BBC&#x27;s communications and transmission backbone. London&#x27;s BBC Television Centre (TVC) had primary responsibility for most of the BBC&#x27;s transmitted output and day to day transmission switching and presentation.

Pebble Mill was the Midlands Central Switching and Monitoring Centre, and would route national channels (two television, four national radio and local radio) to the Midland transmitters at Sutton Coldfield, Ridge Hill and The Wrekin and to other parts of the UK as well as acting as a national back up to TVC in case of emergencies.

==Outside broadcast – television and radio==

In the late 1960s to the early 1990s, Pebble Mill had a fleet of &#x27;Links&#x27; or scanner vehicles that were used to relay vision signals from outside broadcasts (OBs) back to the Communications Centre or &#x27;Comms Centre&#x27; before being redistributed to London. All audio signals were sent via copper cable (Post Office/BT land lines). When satellite transmission of picture signals began in the mid-1990s, Pebble Mill gained satellite dishes and had fibre optics installed as permanent links to Birmingham&#x27;s BT tower.

Pebble Mill had several scanner vehicles possibly dating back to World War II when it was a Royal Air Force (RAF) term for mobile radar vehicles which the GPO and BBC used after the war.

During the 1970s &#x27;Comms Centre&#x27; was located in the &#x27;Foyer&#x27; at Pebble Mill, but by the 1990s, Comms moved around the corner in the studio and was situated in the link area between Radio and TV.

===Television===

====CMCR9 (Colour Midland 1)====
CMCR9 was a Colour Outside Broadcast Unit built by PYE Electronics. This was a four camera vehicle and had a complement of 4 X Philips cameras. CMCR 9 is a Type 2 (CMCR9/C9, CM1 and North 3) originally had Pye cameras, but these had been removed after it was sold from the BBC. The BBC had started to fit it with EMI 2001 cameras, as originally fitted in the London units. CMCR9 would service big sports commitments and other large events around the Midland region. At some point the unit was transferred to the BBC Manchester Studios in Oxford Road, Manchester where it spent the rest of its working life. It and has now been restored to working order

====CM1 (Colour Midland 1)====
CM1 was a Type 5 Scanner built by Link Electronics. This was an eight camera vehicle and had a complement of 5 X Philips LDK5 cameras. CM1 would service big sports commitments and other large events around the Midland region such as the snooker at Sheffield, &quot;Grand Prix&quot; from Silverstone Race Track, &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; and many others and it was an integral part of the BBC&#x27;s nationwide TV OB fleet. Eventually CM1 was sold to ex-Pebble Mill OB crews who started Transvision Outside Broadcast.

====CM 2 (Colour Midland 2)====
CM2 was a &#x27;Topical News &amp; Drama&#x27;, two-camera vehicle equipped with Philips LDK-14 cameras connected to LDK-5 CCUs (Camera Control Unit) and based on a Dennis TK chassis. In 1982, &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot;, an English Regions Drama production, was shot on CM2 in Liverpool. The director, Philip Saville, was breaking many conventions including shooting wide-angles and close-ups at the same time).

====CM 3 (Colour Mobile 3)====
CM3 was a single camera vehicle based on a Renault Master van and was similar to modern SNG vehicles.

The TV OB Fleet was the first to succumb to the accountants’ spreadsheet logic, and its demise was the first tangible indicator of Pebble Mill’s televisual decline. The vehicles were sold off in 1992 despite being some of the most efficiently scheduled of the BBC’s entire OB Fleet.

===Radio===
====Type B====
Pebble Mill had a BBC Type-B vehicle which mainly tackled live religious programmes such as Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Choral Evensong&quot;, or &quot;Sunday Worship&quot;. A typical B-type, it featured a CALREC S-Series 40-channel sound desk with LS 5/8 speakers and nearfield monitoring. Birmingham&#x27;s Type B is still operational from the Mailbox.

====SCV6====
SCV6 was an articulated Sound Control Vehicle which managed Radio 1 and Radio 2&#x27;s popular music OBs. As one of only two SCVs in the country, it was used for live and recorded shows. The SCV was fitted with an ageing SSL 4000 console (with automation) and a Pyramix digital multitrack system. It was replaced by new &quot;Music Trucks&quot; in 2010.

====Type C====
The Type-C ‘ice-cream van’ broadcast &quot;Any Questions?&quot; and sport, i.e. &quot;Test Match Special&quot; and athletics.

==Sound and radio==
===Local radio===
The centre was responsible for a large output into mainstream network radio and was also home of the local radio station Radio WM. WM had studios on the first floor linking the Comms centre and the news room.

===Radio studios===
The two radio studios and Local Radio Operations Room overlooked the central courtyard and between them provided all of Radio WM&#x27;s production base for 35 years. In addition to WM the complex also had some of the finest sound studios outside of Broadcasting House in London.

===Studio 1===
Studio 1 was the main music studio at Pebble Mill with enough space to accommodate a full symphony orchestra. Initially it was used for sound recording sessions plus twice-weekly live broadcasts for Radio 3&#x27;s lunchtime concerts. However, as well as radio this studio was equipped with a basic lighting grid and was used in its early years for the occasional television programme. The studio lighting was controlled from gallery &#x27;C&#x27; from the summer of 1983.

However, John Birt&#x27;s &#x27;Producer Choice&#x27; agenda in the early 1990s forced Pebble Mill to charge unrealistic rental rates for the studio and made Studio 1 too expensive for radio use. Therefore, Radio 3 moved out to Adrian Boult Hall in the centre of the city, with the newly developed BBC Resources, turning Studio 1 into a full-time TV studio. A scene dock door was added together with the installation of a more comprehensive lighting grid.
Soon after, Studio 1 was in daily use for the live transmission of The Really Useful Show. This lasted for three series, but it is understood that the long acoustic reverberation characteristics of the studio were not ideal for TV sound.

Programmes that originated from Studio 1 included &quot;Daily Live&quot;, &quot;Anything You Can Cook&quot; and &quot;Front Room&quot;. In its final years Studio 1 was used as a sound stage for &quot;Doctors&quot;, although the associated radio cubicle continued to be used to produce Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Farming Today&quot; until the closure of Pebble Mill as a whole in May 2004.

===Studio 2===
Studio 2 was a large music studio with an SSL 4000 console and a reverb time of about half a second. This is where aspiring music balancers were trained. Studio 2 in the 1990s was used mostly by Radio 2 as its midland sessions studio and many popular musicians performed there. There isn&#x27;t a music studio of any kind at Pebble Mill&#x27;s replacement facility, The Mailbox.

===Studio 3 and M3===
Pebble Mill&#x27;s radio drama studio, Studio 3, provided much of Radio 3 and 4&#x27;s drama output – it was the home of &quot;The Archers&quot;, the world&#x27;s longest running radio soap opera. The last &quot;Archers&quot; programme from Pebble Mill was on 13 September 2004. The Mailbox (Pebble Mill&#x27;s replacement) has a smaller radio drama studio, but incorporating a larger dead-room with an anechoic ‘snail’ for long, outdoor approaches. &quot;The Archers&quot; transferred to the Mailbox studio at the beginning of October 2004 and the drama studio was designed by Mark Decker. The adjacent facility (M3 – Midland 3) was a small edit studio and had a SADiE and was primarily used for editing &quot;The Archers&quot;, Radio 2&#x27;s specialist music shows, and Radio 4&#x27;s Midlands-based Features and Rural Affairs output.

===Studio 4 and M4===
Studio 4 was the chassis of a studio that was never installed, but it had an edit suite associated with it called M4 (Midland 4) where most of the Radio Drama was edited. This is where the first AMS Audiofile DAW was used in radio and was then equipped with both Audiofile and SADiE in the mid-1990s.

===Studio 5===
Studio 5 was the general purpose studio – over the years it was used for every form of feature or ‘strip’ programme, from &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; to Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Ed Stewart Show&quot; on Sunday afternoons. The studio was refurbished at least twice and was home to &quot;The Richard Bacon Show&quot;, live Saturday and Sunday nights on Radio 5. Radio 2&#x27;s specialist popular music such shows as &quot;The Best of Jazz&quot;, Paul Jones, and &quot;Stuart Maconie&#x27;s Critical List&quot; were recorded or transmitted from there as well.

===Studio 6===
Studio 6 was not equipped until about 1995 but was where Radio 2 &quot;Through the Night&quot; originated, presented by Janice Long, Alex Lester and Mo Dutta. The Mailbox has facilities intended to replicate the functionality of Studios 5 and 6, as well as the M3 &amp; M4 editing facilities.

===Studio 7===
There was a seventh sound studio on the first floor adjoining the local radio studios. This studio was never commissioned: it was originally an office, and later became an electronics room for the communications (Comms) centre.

==Programmes==
BBC Birmingham and BBC Midlands, from their initial conception, were to provide local interest and national programme output for the Midland Region. Over Pebble Mill&#x27;s 35 years of operation the studios produced some of the BBC&#x27;s most iconic programmes and was second to Television Centre for total output. The following is a small list of the total programme output of the complex. There were many single and short run documentaries, OBs and pilots which have come and gone over the years many of which will never be remembered.

===Radio===
Pebble Mill housed Radio West Midlands (Radio WM) but also produced programming for Radio 2, 3 and 4. Most of Radio 4&#x27;s 1990s dramas came from Pebble Mill. Radio programming included over the years &quot;Woman’s Hour&quot;, &quot;The Ed Stewart Show&quot; on Sunday afternoons. &quot;The Richard Bacon Show&quot;, live Saturday and Sunday nights on Radio 5. Radio 2’s specialist popular music shows such as &quot;Best of Jazz&quot;, &quot;Paul Jones&quot;, &quot;Stuart Maconie’s Critical List&quot; and Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Through the Night&quot;, presented by Janice Long, Alex Lester and Mo Dutta.

Also in the 1990s a news department programme, &quot;The Midlands at Westminster&quot;, a local politics strand, broadcast at Sunday lunch time on BBC 2.

====Light entertainment====
Light entertainment included &quot;Telly Addicts&quot;, &quot;Top Gear Motorsport&quot;, &quot;Noel&#x27;s Addicts&quot;, &quot;The Great Egg Race&quot; with Professor Heinz Wolff, a series of &quot;2point4 Children&quot;, &quot;An Actors Life&quot;, &quot;The Golden Oldie Picture Show&quot;, &quot;May to December&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Wait Up&quot;, &quot;Going for a Song&quot; (the 1990s version) and &quot;Call My Bluff&quot; (1997–2005 revival). It also included &quot;Can&#x27;t Cook Won&#x27;t Cook&quot;, &quot;A Song for Christmas&quot;, &quot;The Basil Brush Show&quot; (1970s version) and &quot;Best of Brass&quot;, a brass band competition.

Pebble Mill also developed lifestyle programming with &quot;Style Challenge&quot; and &quot;To Buy or Not to Buy&quot;.

BBC Birmingham was also responsible for a popular BBC2 programme for much of the 1970s-1990s the Snooker programme &quot;Pot Black&quot;, which was generally shown most Fridays throughout the year at 9pm on BBC 2.

====Drama====
Throughout its 35-year history Pebble Mill productions of BBC drama was extensive.

&quot;Morgan&#x27;s Boy, Rose for Winter&quot;, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, &quot;Fosdyke Saga&quot;, &quot;Airbase&quot;, &quot;Tycoon&quot;, &quot;Bird of Prey&quot;, and &quot;A Very Peculiar Practice&quot; (first series). &quot;Owen MD&quot;, &quot;Lord Peter Wimsey&quot; played by Ian Carmichael, and &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;.

There were also editions of &quot;Play School&quot; and &quot;Jackanory&quot;.

====Asian Unit====
During the early 1960s BBC Birmingham pioneered television programmes for the Asian community. These were presented and produced by Mahendra Kaul, directed by Ashok Rampal and broadcast on Sunday mornings. &quot;Apna Hi Ghar Samajhiye&quot; (&quot;Make Yourself At Home&quot;) aired on Sundays at 9am for half an hour. &quot;Empire Road&quot; (1978–79), written by Michael Abbensetts was a drama series about the African Caribbean and Asian communities which was shown on BBC 2. During the late &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s &quot;Network East&quot; was produced in Studio A and B, consisting of music and interviews.

====Daytime television====
BBC Birmingham utilised the main foyer of Pebble Mill for television entertainment and magazine programmes, mostly for BBC1. One fixture of the schedule, &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot; was an early afternoon show, though it started originally on BBC2. The idea to use the reception and foyer for programmes was borne out of the fact, all the other studio space were either fully used for Birmingham produced, or for BBC TV&#x27;s network needs for the various London based programme departments. &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot; ran from 1972 until 1986, was then one of few daytime magazine programmes, hence its success at the time.

There was at least one Pebble Mill spin-off during the 1970s, when BBC1 rested its main Saturday chat show, &quot;Parkinson&quot;. BBC Birmingham was commissioned to produce a late night chat show. &quot;Saturday Night at the Mill&quot;, was the result and Kenny Ball and his Jazzmen were the regular house band; they performed the show&#x27;s signature tune. The programme was directed and produced in Birmingham by Roy Norton and Roy Ronnie. In 1981 an early evening version of a hit BBC1 show from the sixties called &quot;Six Five Special&quot; resurfaced during the Mill&#x27;s summer break, presented by Donny MacLeod and Marian Foster.

The Pebble Mill format returned in 1988 as &quot;Daytime Live&quot;, renamed &quot;Scene Today&quot;, and followed by &quot;Good Morning with Anne and Nick&quot;, both broadcast from Studio C. &quot;Pebble Mill&quot; was resurrected in 1991 and aired from Studio A, presented by Alan Titchmarsh and Judi Spiers in a format similar to &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot;.

==Closure of Pebble Mill and move to The Mailbox==

Due to problems with the lease and to changes in the way television was produced, as well as the fact that some sections of the building were suffering from concrete cancer, the BBC made the decision to relocate to new facilities. Most departments moved to The Mailbox in Birmingham City Centre, but the drama department went to the newly created BBC Drama Village at the Selly Oak campus of the University of Birmingham. The Mailbox has facilities intended to replicate the functionality of Studios 3, 5 and 6, as well as the M3 &amp; M4 editing facilities. The transfer was completed on 22 October 2004, 33 years after Pebble Mill opened.

Remaining fixtures, furniture and technical equipment were auctioned off at Pebble Mill a few weeks later. The studios were demolished the following summer, with developers at the time planning to build a technology and science park on the site. Instead, construction of a new Birmingham Dental Hospital started there in 2014, and the facility opened in 2016. On another part of the site, a hospital was built for Circle Health in 2020.

<text>136 Austria is a main-belt asteroid that was found by the prolific asteroid discoverer Johann Palisa on 18 March 1874, from the Austrian Naval Observatory in Pola, Istria. It was his first asteroid discovery and was given the Latin name of his homeland.

Based upon its spectrum, it is classified as an M-type spectrum, although Clark et al. (1994) suggest it may be more like an S-type asteroid. It shows almost no absorption features in the near infrared, which may indicate an iron or enstatite chondrite surface composition. A weak hydration feature was detected in 2006.

Photometric observations of this asteroid at the European Southern Observatory in 1981 gave a light curve with a period of 11.5 ± 0.1 hours and a brightness variation of 0.40 in magnitude. As of 2013, the estimated rotation period is 11.4969 hours.

<text>137 Meliboea is a large, dark main-belt asteroid that was discovered by Austrian astronomer J. Palisa at the Austrian Naval Observatory on 21 April 1874, the second of his many asteroid discoveries. It was later named after Meliboea, the daughter of Oceanus and Tethys in Greek mythology. The largest body in the Meliboea family of asteroids that share similar orbital elements, only 791 Ani approaches its size. It is classified as a C-type asteroid and may be composed of carbonaceous materials. The spectra of the asteroid displays evidence of aqueous alteration.

Photometric observations of this asteroid made at the Torino Observatory in Italy during 1990–1991 were used to determine a synodic rotation period of 15.28 ± 0.02 hours. A 2009 study at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico found a period of 25.676 ± 0.001 hours and a brightness variation of 0.16 ± 0.02 in magnitude. They ruled out a period of 15 hours determined in previous studies.

During 2002, 137 Meliboea was observed by radar from the Arecibo Observatory. The return signal matched an effective diameter of 144 ± 16 km. This is consistent with the asteroid dimensions computed through other means.

<text>Joseph Albert Walker (February 20, 1921 – June 8, 1966) (Capt, USAF) was an American World War II pilot, experimental physicist, NASA test pilot, and astronaut who was the first person to fly an airplane to space. He was one of twelve pilots who flew the North American X-15, an experimental spaceplane jointly operated by the Air Force and NASA.

In 1961, Walker became the first human in the mesosphere when piloting Flight 35, and in 1963, Walker made three flights above 50 miles, thereby qualifying as an astronaut according to the United States definition of the boundary of space. The latter two, X-15 Flights 90 and 91, also surpassed the Kármán line, the internationally accepted boundary of 100 kilometers (62.14 miles). Making the latter flights immediately after the completion of the Mercury and Vostok programs, Walker became the first person to fly to space twice. He was the only X-15 pilot to fly above 100 km during the program.

Walker died in a group formation accident on June 8, 1966.

==Early life==
Born in Washington, Pennsylvania, Walker graduated from Trinity High School in 1938. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in physics from Washington and Jefferson College in 1942, before entering the United States Army Air Forces. He was married and had four children.

==Career==
===Military service===
During World War II, Walker flew the Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter and F-5A Lightning photo aircraft (a modified P-38) on weather reconnaissance flights. Walker earned the Distinguished Flying Cross once, awarded by General Nathan Twining in July 1944, and the Air Medal with seven oak leaf clusters.

===Test pilot career===


After World War II, Walker separated from the Army Air Forces and joined the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory in Cleveland, Ohio, as an experimental physicist. While in Cleveland, Walker became a test pilot, and he conducted icing research in flight, as well as in the NACA icing wind tunnel. He transferred to the High-Speed Flight Research Station in Edwards, California, in 1951.

Walker served for 15 years at the Edwards Flight Research Facility – now called the Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center. By the mid-1950s, he was a Chief Research Pilot. Walker worked on several pioneering research projects. He flew in three versions of the Bell X-1: the X-1#2 (two flights, first on August 27, 1951), X-1A (one flight), X-1E (21 flights). When Walker attempted a second flight in the X-1A on August 8, 1955, the rocket aircraft was damaged in an explosion just before being launched from the JTB-29A mothership. Walker was unhurt, though, and he climbed back into the mothership with the X-1A subsequently jettisoned.

Other research aircraft that he flew were the Douglas D-558-I Skystreak #3 (14 flights), Douglas D-558-II Skyrocket #2 (three flights), D-558-II #3 (two flights), Douglas X-3 Stiletto (20 flights), Northrop X-4 Bantam (two flights), and Bell X-5 (78 flights).

Walker was the chief project pilot for the X-3 program. Walker reportedly considered the X-3 to be the worst airplane that he ever flew. In addition to research aircraft, Walker flew many chase planes during test flights of other aircraft, and he also flew in programs that involved the North American F-100 Super Sabre, McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, Convair F-102 Delta Dagger, Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and Boeing B-47 Stratojet.

====X-15 program====

In 1958, Walker was one of the pilots selected for the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Man In Space Soonest (MISS) project, but that project never came to fruition. That same year, NACA became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and in 1960, Walker became the first NASA pilot to fly the X-15, and the second X-15 pilot, following Scott Crossfield, the manufacturer&#x27;s test pilot. On his first X-15 flight, Walker did not realize how much power its rocket engines had, and he was crushed backward into the pilot&#x27;s seat, screaming, &quot;Oh, my God!&quot;. Then, a flight controller jokingly replied &quot;Yes? You called?&quot; Walker would go on to fly the X-15 25 times, including the first flight of a human into the mesosphere, Flight 35, and the only two flights that exceeded in altitude, Flight 90 (on July 19, 1963: ) and Flight 91 (on August 22, 1963: ).

Walker was the first American civilian to make any spaceflight, and the second civilian overall, preceded only by the Soviet Union&#x27;s cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova one month earlier. Flights 90 and 91 made Walker the first human to make multiple spaceflights according to the FAI definition of greater than 100 km (62 mi). Flight 77 on January 17, 1963 also qualified Walker as an astronaut, according to the US Department of Defense definition of greater than 50 mi (80 km).

Walker flew at his highest speed in the X-15A-1: (Mach 5.92) during Flight 59 on June 27, 1962 (the fastest flight in any of the three X-15s was about (Mach 6.7) during Flight 188 flown by William J. Knight on October 3, 1967).

====LLRV program====

Walker also became the first test pilot of the Bell Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (LLRV), which was used to develop piloting and operational techniques for lunar landings. On October 30, 1964, Walker took the LLRV on its maiden flight, reaching an altitude of about 10 ft and a total flight time of just under one minute. He piloted 35 LLRV flights in total. Neil Armstrong later flew this craft many times in preparation for the spaceflight of Apollo 11 – the first human landing on the Moon – including crashing it once and barely escaping from it with his ejection seat.

==Death==

Walker was killed on June 8, 1966, when his F-104N Starfighter chase aircraft collided with a North American XB-70 Valkyrie. At an altitude of about Walker&#x27;s Starfighter was one of five aircraft in a tight group formation for a General Electric publicity photo when his F-104 drifted into contact with the XB-70&#x27;s right wingtip. The F-104 flipped over, and, rolling inverted, passed over the top of the XB-70, striking both its vertical stabilizers and its left wing in the process, and exploded, killing Walker. The Valkyrie entered an uncontrollable spin and crashed into the ground north of Barstow, California, killing co-pilot Carl Cross. Its pilot, Alvin White, one of Walker&#x27;s colleagues from the Man In Space Soonest program, ejected and was the sole survivor.

The USAF summary report of the accident investigation stated that, given the position of the F-104 relative to the XB-70, the F-104 pilot would not have been able to see the XB-70&#x27;s wing, except by uncomfortably looking back over his left shoulder. The report stated that it was likely that Walker, piloting the F-104, maintained his position by looking at the fuselage of the XB-70, forward of his position.

The F-104 was estimated to be to the side of, and below, the fuselage of the XB-70. The report concluded that from that position, without appropriate sight cues, Walker was unable to properly perceive his motion relative to the Valkyrie, leading to his aircraft drifting into contact with the XB-70&#x27;s wing.

The accident investigation also pointed to the wake vortex off the XB-70&#x27;s right wingtip as the reason for the F-104&#x27;s sudden roll over and into the bomber. A sixth plane in the incident was a civilian Learjet 23 that held the photographer. Because the formation flight and photo were unauthorized, the careers of several Air Force colonels ended as a result of this aviation accident.

==Awards and honors==

Walker was a charter member and one of the first Fellows of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. He received the Robert J. Collier Trophy, the Harmon International Trophy for Aviators, the Iven C. Kincheloe Award, the John J. Montgomery Award, and the Octave Chanute Award. His alma mater awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Aeronautical Sciences degree in 1961. He received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1962. The National Pilots Association named him Pilot of the Year in 1963. In 1964, Walker was awarded the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Walker was inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor in 1991, and the International Space Hall of Fame in 1995. Joe Walker Middle School in Quartz Hill, California, is named in his honor as well as the Joe Walker Elementary School in Washington, Pennsylvania.

On August 23, 2005, NASA officially conferred on Walker his Astronaut Wings, posthumously.

&quot;Star Trek&quot; starship designer John Eaves created the &quot;Walker&quot;-class starships named for Joseph Walker that first appeared in the 2017 TV series &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, including USS &quot;Shenzhou&quot;.

<text>The University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES), branded as Cambridge Assessment, was a non-teaching department of the University of Cambridge. It merged with Cambridge University Press to form Cambridge University Press and Assessment under Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s approval in August 2021.

Cambridge Assessment provides educational assessments, which include the Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations (OCR) examination board, Cambridge Assessment International Education, Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing, and Cambridge Assessment English for learners of the English language.

Cambridge Assessment is not responsible for internal examinations at the University of Cambridge other than admissions tests.

Cambridge Assessment is based at Triangle Building in Cambridge.

==Products and services==
Cambridge Assessment has four examination boards offering a range of assessments and a research division:

* Cambridge Assessment&#x27;s research division carries out research that underpins all Cambridge Assessment qualifications and programmes, such as expanding e-assessment. This included the Cambridge Psychometrics Centre, until its move to the University of Cambridge.
* OCR is one of the UK&#x27;s many awarding bodies. OCR offers GCSEs, A levels and a wide range of vocational qualifications to learners of all ages in schools, colleges and other institutions within the United Kingdom.

==History==
UCLES was established in 1858 to administer examinations for persons who were not members of the University of Cambridge and to inspect schools, with the aim of raising standards in education. The Syndicate began examining in territories overseas, with the first held in Trinidad in 1864. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Syndicate was empowered to hold examinations for commercial certificates.

The Certificate of Proficiency in English (known as the CPE), the Syndicate&#x27;s first examination in the field of English as a foreign language, was introduced by UCLES to deliver proof of language proficiency to native speakers of languages other than English. Over the years, UCLES adopted further English language examinations, the First Certificate in English (FCE) and the Certificate in Advanced English (CAE). On the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) ranging from A1/A2 (lower level), B1/B2 (intermediate level) to C1/C2 (advanced level), the FCE is set at B2, the CAE at C1 and the CPE at C2.

The universities of Oxford and Cambridge created the Oxford and Cambridge Schools Examination Board which became part of UCLES. The UCLES Group absorbed several other examination boards, including the Southern Universities Joint Board, the Midland Examining Group and the RSA Examinations and Assessment Foundation.

Cambridge Assessment&#x27;s research division was set up in 1994.

The Thinking Skills Assessment (TSA) was introduced in 2001 for entry to a range of undergraduate courses at the University of Cambridge followed by the first BioMedical Admissions Test (BMAT) in 2003. In 2004, a dedicated unit was formally set up with responsibility for developing and administering admissions tests.

Cambridge Assessment celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2008. Cambridge Assessment called for &quot;league tables [to be] taken out of [government] ministers&#x27; hands&quot;, because it felt recent reforms of the British education system had disfavoured International GCSEs offered by its Cambridge Assessment International subsidiary.

Cambridge Maths was launched in 2014 to improve maths teaching – a four-way partnership between Cambridge Assessment, the University of Cambridge Faculty of Mathematics and its Faculty of Education.

It launched the Cambridge Partnership for Education in 2020 with Cambridge University Press and the University of Cambridge.

It moved to a purpose-built building in 2018, on part of Cambridge University Press&#x27;s site in Cambridge. The building was designed by Eric Parry Architects, and construction began in 2015 with landscaping by Coles Nursery and architectural elements such as pebble seat sculptures. The building won an award in 2019 from the British Council for Offices for good corporate workplaces.

In 2021, Cambridge Assessment merged with Cambridge University Press. The new organisation is called Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment.

<text>138 Tolosa is a brightly coloured, stony background asteroid from the inner region of the asteroid belt. It was discovered by French astronomer Henri Joseph Perrotin on 19 May 1874, and named by the Latin and Occitan name ( and ) of the French city of Toulouse.

The spectrum of this asteroid rules out the presence of ordinary chondrites, while leaning in favor of clinopyroxene phases. As of 2006, there are no known meteorites with compositions similar to the spectrum of 138 Tolosa.

<text>The Mayor of Seattle is the head of the executive branch of the city government of Seattle, Washington. The mayor is authorized by the city charter to enforce laws enacted by the Seattle City Council, as well as direct subordinate officers in city departments. (The Seattle City Council, the legislative branch of city government, is led by the council president.)

The mayor serves a four-year term, without term limits, and is chosen in citywide, two-round elections between nonpartisan candidates.

Since the appointment of Henry A. Atkins in 1869, 56 individuals have held the office of mayor. The city elected Bertha Knight Landes, the first female mayor of a major U.S. city, in 1926. Several mayors have served non-consecutive terms, while others have resigned or faced recall elections. Charles Royer holds the record for longest mayoral tenure in the city&#x27;s history, serving three full terms from 1978 to 1990.

Bruce Harrell took office as mayor on January 1, 2022, becoming the first Asian-American and second African-American mayor in Seattle&#x27;s history.

==History==

Seattle was initially incorporated as a town on January 14, 1865, by the Washington Territorial Legislature, governed by a board of trustees. Charles C. Terry served as president of the board of trustees, which remained unchanged until the town&#x27;s disincorporation on January 28, 1867. The town of Seattle was incorporated a second time on December 2, 1869, with a new city charter that established the position of mayor. Henry A. Atkins was appointed the first mayor of Seattle by the Territorial Legislature, and was elected to the office on July 11, 1870.

A new city charter, the Freeholders Charter, was adopted in 1890 and extended the mayor&#x27;s term in office from one year to two years, but barred consecutive terms. The charter also moved elections to the first Monday in March and required the mayor to be at least 30 years of age and live within the city for two years.

A new city charter that was approved by the city&#x27;s voters in 1946 lengthened the term of office for mayors from two years to four years, starting with the 1948 elections. In 1969 the age and residence requirements were removed from the charter.

==Duties and powers==

The mayor is the head of the executive branch of Seattle&#x27;s municipal government, charged with the appointment and management of 25 department and commission heads that work directly for the mayor. In the event of an absence of the mayor, the president of the Seattle City Council assumes the duties of the position as mayor pro tem until their return, but a notification is not necessary under the city charter.

==Elections and succession==

The mayor is elected in a citywide election held every four years, composed of two stages: a primary election in August and a general election between the top two candidates in November. Elections are officially non-partisan.

If the office of mayor becomes vacant, the president of the city council becomes mayor for a five-day period to immediately fill the position. If the president of the city council declines to remain mayor, the city council is authorized to vote to appoint a councilmember to the role of mayor. The councilmember appointed to the position under both scenarios will forfeit their position on the city council until the next election. A mayor-elect can also take office earlier than the official inauguration date (January 1), upon certification of the election results and a decision by the city council to replace the appointed mayor.

A two-thirds majority vote of the city council can remove the mayor from office for a willful violation of duty or an offense involving moral turpitude.

<text>Lafonia is a peninsula forming the southern part of East Falkland, the largest of the Falkland Islands.

==Geography and geology==
Shaped like the letter &quot;E&quot;, it is joined to the northern part of the island by an isthmus that is almost wide. Were this isthmus to be severed, Lafonia would be the third largest of the Falkland Islands. Falkland Sound runs to the west between Lafonia and West Falkland. Choiseul Sound divides Lafonia from the northern part of East Falkland, which is still unnamed.

Barren Island, Bleaker Island, George Island, Lively Island, Sea Lion Island and Speedwell Island are all off Lafonia.

The geology of north west Lafonia is Permian, and similar to that of parts of Ecca Pass in South Africa. The plain of Lafonia is constituted by arenaceous sediments of the Lafonia Group. Depressions in the sediments formed where they were cut vertically by basalt dikes.

In the 21st century, Lafonia has seen gold prospecting by Falkland Gold and Minerals Ltd.

==History and population==
The land is gentle and low-lying, but almost uninhabited, falling into the &quot;camp&quot; category. Most of its settlement occurred in the mid 19th century.

In 1845, Mr Samuel Fisher Lafone, a British-born wealthy cattle and hide merchant on the river Plate, obtained from government a grant of the southern portion of the East Falkland, which was a peninsula in extent, and possession of all the wild cattle on the island for a period of six years, for a payment of £10,000 down, and £20,000 in ten years from January 1, 1852. In 1851, Mr Lafone&#x27;s interest in Lafonia, as the peninsula came to be called, was purchased for £30,000 by the Falkland Islands Company, which had been incorporated by charter in the same year.

Lafonia has been used for sheep farming since the early nineteenth century. It is run from Darwin (founded 1859) and Goose Green, both of which are located on the narrow isthmus that separates Lafonia from the rest of East Falkland. North Arm Settlement is the only substantial settlement in Lafonia (not counting offshore islands), along with Walker Creek. Attractions include the Bodie Suspension Bridge, built in 1925 and said to be the southernmost in the world. There is also a shop here. Listed buildings in Lafonia include The Galpon and Stone Corral in Darwin, The Stone Cottage and Goose Green Hall (owned by Falklands Landholdings) in Goose Green and Paragon House.

The first battles on land during the Falklands War took place on Lafonia (see Battle of Goose Green), where over a thousand Argentine personnel were stationed and around one-hundred locals were imprisoned in the community hall. The area is now home to an Argentine Military Cemetery. Parts of Lafonia, especially near Darwin and Goose Green, are still heavily mined.

Other settlements include Port King, Egg Harbour, and the abandoned Hope Place.

==Wildlife==
Charles Darwin surveyed the area&#x27;s wildlife during his now-famous voyage on HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;.

Lafonia&#x27;s wildlife includes the Chiloé wigeon, silver teal and yellow-billed pintail. Introduced brown trout are found in at least one stream flowing into Choiseul Sound. There is also a population of zebra trout.

<text>The Pays de Caux (, , literally &quot;Land of Caux&quot;) is an area in Normandy occupying the greater part of the French &quot;département&quot; of Seine Maritime in Normandy. It is a chalk plateau to the north of the Seine Estuary and extending to the cliffs on the English Channel coast; its coastline is known as the Côte d&#x27;Albâtre. In the east, it borders on the Pays de Bray where the strata below the chalk show through.

Cauchois is a notable dialect of the Norman language. The Pays de Caux is one of the remaining strongholds of the Norman language outside the Cotentin (or Cherbourg) peninsula.

The principal communities are Le Havre, Dieppe, Fécamp, Yvetot, and Étretat.

==Etymology==
In the Norman language &quot;caux&quot; means lime, calcium carbonate. In French, for comparison, the word is &quot;chaux&quot; (the French &#x27;ch&#x27; being pronounced as an English &#x27;sh&#x27;. Example: Caux dialect &quot;candelle&quot;, English &quot;candle&quot;, French &quot;chandelle&quot; ). The name of the neighbouring &quot;Pays de Bray&quot; comes from an Old French word of Gaulish origin for mud. They appear to be so named as their soils distinguish them; the one of sticky clay, the other on dry chalk, but that is only a legend. In fact, according to something common in the former Gaul, the name derives from the Celtic tribe that lived here in ancient time: the Caletes (or &quot;Caleti&quot;. It means &quot;the hard or the courageous people&quot;, Breton &quot;kaled&quot; hard, Welsh &quot;caled&quot; hard ) and this land was their territory. They are sometimes considered as Belgae or as Armoricans. The word &quot;Caletes&quot; shifted to &quot;*Caltes&quot;, then &quot;*Calz&quot;, &quot;Cauz&quot;, to be spelled &quot;Caux&quot; in modern time.

== Geography ==

The Pays de Caux is a plateau of Upper Cretaceous chalk, like that which forms the North and South Downs in southern England. Its surface is an undulating plateau but the seaward side has been eroded by the waves so that the coast is formed of high white cliffs. The small valleys that inland form the undulations, are truncated here, leaving what are known locally as valleuses, steep-sided notches in the face of the cliff. They are more or less deeply cut, and some form the sites of small towns such as Étretat. The formations left in the eroded cliff there have long attracted artists. See the photograph where Étretat lies to the right, in the valleuse beyond the first ridge.

The main towns in the north, Fécamp and Étretat, are on the coast. Dieppe, is towards the margin of the region, lying as it does on the same geological fault as formed the Pays de Bray. This fault gave rise to the deep harbour which the Northmen found when they arrived. (The Swedish for deep is &quot;djup&quot;.) The towns on the plateau are generally small. Of these, the larger, such as Yvetot, Bolbec and Lillebonne are towards the south, on the Rouen-Le Havre axis. The site of Le Havre was once part of the Pays de Caux but the town has developed into an entity with a separate nature.

The population density of the Pays de Caux is a little above the French average. Its traditional industries are fisheries, on the coast, and flax growing and weaving, on the plateau. Once hostilities between the Normans and the French had been settled with Paris, the estuarine ports to the south developed trade up-river towards Rouen. In more recent times, urbanization has spread from Le Havre and, more recently still, from the new industrial polder in the Seine Estuary. 

The plateau&#x27;s exposure to the winds of the sea may account for one of the features of the rural architecture of the region: the plain, unadorned farmhouses in farmsteads, typically enclosed by high earth banks, walls, and a sheltering square of trees. (see also &quot;Architecture of Normandy&quot;).

*Vexin normand to the South-east
*Lower Seine valley to the South

==History==
===Independent Gaul===
Julius Caesar&#x27;s account of his military campaigns (&quot;Bellum Gallicum&quot;, The Gallic War) gives details of the Caletes, partly ancestors of the Cauchois (see Book II, 4, 9; Book VII, 75, 3–4, Book VIII, 7, 4)

===Roman Gaul===
Rescue archaeology undertaken on the line of the A29 autoroute revealed several Gallo-Roman villas. One of the most important is that of Sainte-Marguerite-sur-Mer, on the coast to the west of Dieppe. The archaeologists found a complex of several rooms, organised around a square court. Several of the rooms had been furnished with mosaics. To the north, the baths and other rooms were heated by hypocausts. The materials used were pisé (clay and grit well mixed and rammed down to form a wall), cob (a similar mixture of earth of a buttery consistency or marl, chopped straw and perhaps gravel) and timber framing, typical materials of Normandy&#x27;s later building tradition.

Lillebonne is on the site of the main town of the Caletes, the Gaulish tribe of the region. The Gallo-Roman town was established with the name &quot;&quot;, under Caesar Augustus and is famous for its Roman theatre. According to a common use in Roman Gaul, the &quot;bona&quot; (Gaulish word for &quot;foundation, town&quot;) was dedicated to the Roman emperor, like &quot;Augustodunum&quot; (Autun), &quot;Augustonemetum&quot; (Clermont-Ferrand) or &quot;Augustodurum&quot; (Bayeux), etc. The phonetic evolution from the element &quot;Julio-&quot; to &quot;Lille-&quot; can be explained by the analogy with the French word for island: &quot;île&quot;, with the article agglutination &quot;l″&quot; = the, that makes sense with the word &quot;bona&quot; &gt; &quot;bonne&quot;, which means &quot;good&quot; in French, so &quot;l&#x27;île bonne&quot; = the good island. Their original main oppidum could have been Caudebec-en-Caux or Fécamp, according to the archeological excavations and the numerous Gaulish artefacts, that were discovered in both towns.

===Medieval===

In the Merovingian period, the Pays de Caux became distinct from Talou: the ancient city of the Caletes separated into entities or &#x27;countries&#x27; in the sense of the Latin &quot;pagus&quot;.

From the creation of the county of Rouen and of the Duchy of Normandy in 911, the Vikings settled a great number of people in the region and left an enduring legacy in the Cauchois dialect but also in the ethnic makeup of the Cauchois Normans.

===Manoirs and châteaux of the 15th and 16th centuries===
A &quot;manoir&quot; (manor house) is in principle, the residence of a seigniorial lord though, in practice, the term now includes country houses of the gentry. As a rule, they are not fortified. Since the Hundred Years&#x27; War, country houses have not had ramparts and towers. Artillery has rendered them obsolete. The peace and prosperity which were recovered following 1450, offered the option of reconstructing country houses and local materials such as flint and limestone were used. The owners could allow themselves to follow Renaissance style.

Most Norman &quot;manoirs&quot; have a dovecote in the courtyard. A study by historians revealed 635 dove cotes in the three arrondissements of Dieppe, Le Havre and Rouen. Most are round and are permanent structures. The rarities are polygonal and timber-framed.
A few to be noted are:

*Château d&#x27;Etelan, Saint-Maurice-d&#x27;Etelan, 1494
*Manoir de la Bouteillerie, Rouelles, Le Havre, 1531, dovecote of 1631
*Manoir Dubocage de Bléville, Dollemard, Le Havre, 1516
*Manoir d&#x27;Harquebosc, Harfleur-Beaulieu
*Manoir de Reauté, between Octeville and Montivilliers, takes its name from a family of the 16th century. Contemporary with Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England.
*Château d&#x27;Epremesnil, Epremesnil, 1596, dovecote (note that the fief of Epremenil appears in the list of 1503 but the house, which was bombed in 1944 dates from the 19th century. (There must have been an earlier house and perhaps even a fief primitif (low Middle Ages) near the mill of Tauvais )
*Manoir du Grand Clos, 16th century.
*Manoir de Séntitot, Bévilliers, 1528: manoir in brick and stone, with Renaissance sculpture. The fief of Bevilliers was held by Louis de Richebourg and Jehanne Viennens. In 1624, a Protestant chapel (called in France a &quot;temple&quot;) was built behind the house.
*Manoir du Petit col Moulins, 16th century, dovecote.
*Manoir de Vitanval, Sainte-Addresse, early 15th century, with a 16th-century dovecote. It is a manoir of timber-frame construction with a staircase in an external turret. In 1563, the constable de Montmorency stayed there.
*Manoir d&#x27;Estouteville, with loggias, built in the 15th century by Guillaume d&#x27;Estouteville, archbishop of Rouen in 1453.

==Literary connections==
===The coast: la côte d&#x27;Albâtre ===
Guy de Maupassant, &quot;Le saut du berger&quot; (The Shepherd&#x27;s Leap). Originally published in &quot;Gil Blas&quot; of 9 March 1882:
From Dieppe to Le Havre the coast presents an uninterrupted cliff, about a hundred metres high and straight as a wall. Here and there that great line of white rocks drops sharply and a little, narrow valley, with steep slopes, shaved turf and maritime rushes, comes down from the cultivated plateau towards a beach of shingle where it ends with a ravine like the bed of a torrent. Nature has made these valleys; the rains of storms have ended with them in the shape of these ravines, trimming what was left of the cliff, excavating down to the sea, the bed of waters which acts as a passage for mankind. Sometimes, a village is snuggled into these valleys, where the wind of the open sea is devoured.

Guy de Maupassant, &quot;Pierre et Jean&quot;, chapter 6 
The cool air, where the smell of the coast and of the gorse, the clover and the grasses, the briny scent of the uncovered rocks, stirred him still as it gently intoxicated him and he made his mind up, a little at each step, each second, each glance thrown at the alert outline of the young woman; he decided not to hesitate in telling her that he loved her and that he wanted to marry her. He would use the peach to induce their tête-à-tête; and besides, it would be a pretty frame, a pretty place for speaking of love, feet in a pool, of limpid water, watching as the long beards of the shrimps fled under the bladder-wrack. When they reached the end of the little valley on the edge of the abyss, they noticed a little path which went down along the cliff, and below them, between the sea and the foot of the mountain, about half way up the slope, a surprising chaos of huge rocks, collapsed, turned upside down, piled together, one on another in a sort of turbulent grassy plain which ran as far as the eye could see towards the south, formed by old landslides. On that long strip of undergrowth and shaken turf, one might have said by the stirring of a volcano, the fallen rocks looked like the ruins of a great vanished city which once looked out onto the ocean, itself dominated by the white, endless wall of the cliff.

===Inland: the plateau===
Guy de Maupassant admirably describes the rural feeling of the Pays de Caux in his novels. For example: drawn from &quot;Miss Harriet&quot;, published in &quot;Le Gaulois&quot; of 9 July 1883, under the title &quot;Miss Hastings&quot;, then, in the compendium &quot;Miss Harriet&quot;; Maupassant describes a journey by public coach from Etretat to Tancarville:
It was Autumn. From the two sides of the way the stripped fields extended, yellowed by the short stubble of the harvested oats and wheat which covered the ground like an ill-shaven beard. The misty land seemed to be smoking. The skylarks were singing in the air, other birds piped in the bushes. The sun finally rose before us, all red on the edge of the horizon; and as it climbed, lighter from minute to minute, the countryside seemed to be waking, to smile, shake itself and throw off, like a girl rising from her bed, its shift of white vapour. The Comte d&#x27;Etraille, on the seat, cried; &quot;Look, a hare&quot; pointing to the left towards a patch of clover. The animal darted away, almost hidden in the field, showing only its long ears; then it bolted over some plough-land, stopped, set off again in a mad race, changed direction, stopped again, troubled, listening for any danger, undecided which way to go; then started to run again with big bounds of his hindquarters, and he disappeared in a wide square of beet. All the men marvelled, following the creature&#x27;s progress and gait.

===Two writers from Rouen===
*Gustave Flaubert
*Maurice Leblanc

==Artistic connections==
The rugged scenery of the Pays de Caux, within a comparatively short distance from Paris, encouraged artists, including Claude Monet and Gustave Courbet to travel there to paint.

The Sandown Mile is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged four years or older. It is run over a distance of 1 mile (1,609 metres) at Sandown Park in late April.

==History==
The event was established in 1985, and it was initially sponsored by Trusthouse Forte. The first running was won by Pebbles.

Subsequent sponsors of the race have included KLM uk, At the Races and Betfred. The online gambling company Bet365 became the sponsor in 2008, and the event is currently known as the Bet365 Mile.

<text>José Moreno Hernández (born August 7, 1962) is a Mexican-American engineer and astronaut. He currently serves as a Regent of the University of California.

Hernández was on the Space Shuttle mission STS-128 in August 2009. He also served as chief of the Materials and Processes branch of Johnson Space Center. Hernández previously developed equipment for full-field digital mammography at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

In October 2011, Hernández, at the urging of President Barack Obama, ran for Congress as a Democrat in California&#x27;s newly redrawn 10th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. He won the Democratic nomination but lost the 2012 general election to freshman Representative Jeff Denham.

Hernández is the subject of the 2023 biopic &quot;A Million Miles Away&quot; in which he is portrayed by Michael Peña.

==Early life and education==
Hernández was born in French Camp, California, but calls Stockton, California, his hometown. His family is originally from La Piedad, Michoacán, Mexico. In an August 25, 2009 conversation with President Felipe Calderón of Mexico, Hernández stated that as a child, he lived half the year in La Piedad and half in the United States. As a child, Hernández worked alongside his family and other farmworkers throughout the fields of California, harvesting crops and moving from one town to another. He attended many schools and didn&#x27;t learn to speak English until he was 12. His first memory of space is about adjusting the television to watch the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.

José Hernández participated in Upward Bound during high school, a Federal TRIO program that prepares students for college. He graduated from Franklin High School in Stockton. José Hernández was a first-generation college student who graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree. He earned a B.S. in electrical engineering from the University of the Pacific in December 1984 and &quot;walked&quot; in May of 1985. In 1986, Hernández earned an M.S. in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara. While in college, he was involved in the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) program, an academic preparation program that provides support to students from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds so they can attain four-year degrees in science, technology, engineering or math (STEM) fields.

==Engineering career==
Hernández worked from 1990 to 2001 at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California. While there, Hernández, along with a commercial colleague, developed the first full-field digital mammography imaging system. This invention aids in the early detection of breast cancer.

==NASA career==

In 2001, Hernández joined the Johnson Space Center, in Houston, Texas.

After three years and being turned down eleven times for astronaut training by NASA, Hernández was selected in May 2004. In February 2006 he completed Astronaut Candidate Training that included scientific and technical briefings, intensive instruction in Shuttle and International Space Station systems, physiological training, T-38 flight training, and water and wilderness survival training. On completing this initial training, Hernández was assigned to the Shuttle Branch to support Kennedy Space Center Operations in support of shuttle launch and landing preparations.

In May 2007, Hernández served as an aquanaut during the NEEMO 12 mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory, living and working underwater for eleven days.

Hernández worked various technical assignments until his selection on July 15, 2008, as a mission specialist on the STS-128 mission, which launched on August 28, 2009. While in orbit, Hernández became the first person to use the Spanish language in space while tweeting.

The STS-128 mission ended its 13-day journey on September 11, 2009, at Edwards Air Force Base, California, at 5:53 pm PDT.

==Political career==

During the summer of 2009, Hernández told the Stockton Record that he would consider not running against fellow Democrat Dennis Cardoza in his Stockton-based district.

Hernández announced at Pacific Union College on September 29, 2011, that at the urging of President Barack Obama he was considering a run for the U.S. House of Representatives and would announce his decision on October 11, 2011. He announced his candidacy as promised on October 11 via Twitter by linking to his campaign website. Hernández made his first public campaign appearance on January 14, 2012, at a Democratic Candidate Forum in Tracy at the Holiday Inn Express &amp; Suites.

In March 2012, Bell, McAndrews &amp; Hiltachk, a law firm with links to the California Republican Party, sued in Sacramento County Superior Court to block Hernández from describing himself as an &quot;astronaut/scientist/engineer&quot; on the June ballot. The lawsuit stated that &quot;astronaut is not a title one carries for life&quot;; the election code requires the description to be accurate for the previous calendar year. &quot;Allowing a candidate to use the profession of &#x27;astronaut&#x27; when he hasn&#x27;t served in that profession recently is akin to allowing someone to use the title of &#x27;sailor&#x27; when they no longer own or operate a ship,&quot; said Jennifer Kerns, a California Republican Party spokeswoman. On March 29, a Sacramento County Superior Court judge ruled that Hernández could be described as an astronaut on the June 5 primary ballot.

On the campaign trail, Hernández was criticized for having a 2010 personal tax lien imposed by the IRS and paid in 2012. Hernández attacked his opponent, Denham, for his tax liens imposed against his business in 2003 and paid in 2003.

===Endorsements===
Hernández received the endorsement of Democracy for America and was selected as one of the Dean Dozen supported in 2012. In November 2012, Hernández lost to the incumbent, Congressman Jeff Denham, in the General Election for California&#x27;s new 10th District. Hernández finished in the polls with 46 percent of the vote.

===Fundraising===
Most of Hernández&#x27;s campaign funds came from outside his district and many donations came from left-wing political action committees and public employee unions. Speaking of his fundraising Hernández said, &quot;there aren&#x27;t any special interest groups that are going to come back and say I have to vote for something. I don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;re going to influence me in making decisions on what&#x27;s best for my district.&quot; Hernández said he does not think organizations like teachers&#x27; unions are special interest groups.

===Speculation===
Since his 2012 loss, Hernández has made multiple public statements regarding potential future campaigns. In March 2016, Hernández said, &quot;I ran for Congress in 2012 but I lost in a close race. Now I&#x27;m thinking about making a comeback, maybe in 2018.&quot;

Hernández filed papers to challenge incumbent Democratic Representative Josh Harder in the 9th district in 2022, but ultimately did not run.

===Political views===
====Immigration====
Hernández made headlines soon after his return to Earth as a result of comments he made on Mexican television advocating that the United States legalize undocumented immigrants. He does not favor a guest worker program or a secure ID program.

====Fiscal policy====
Hernández supported California&#x27;s Proposition 30, a ballot measure proposed by Gov. Jerry Brown to increase income taxes on those earning more than $250,000 and raise the sales tax rate by a quarter-cent for everyone. Hernández says there needs to be a combination of tax increases and budget cuts to balance the federal budget.

==Personal life==

Hernández and his wife Adela have five children. For several years, his wife ran a Mexican restaurant just outside the Johnson Space Center gates, called Tierra Luna Grill, which is Spanish for Earth Moon Grill. Hernández owns a 20-acre vineyard near Lodi, California, and in 2021 began bottling wine under the Tierra Luna Cellars label.

In 2023, a film entitled &quot;A Million Miles Away&quot; about Hernández&#x27;s NASA career, starring Michael Peña, was released. The film was based on Hernández’s 2012 autobiography, “&quot;Reaching for the Stars: The Inspiring Story of a Migrant Farmworker Turned Astronaut&quot;.”

==Awards and honors==
Hernández has earned or been awarded:

* Graduate Engineering Minority Fellow (GEM) (1985)

<doc id="741607" wikidata="Q215115" url="?curid=741607" title="August Wilhelm Iffland">
<text>August Wilhelm Iffland (19 April 175922 September 1814) was a German actor and dramatic author.

==Life==
Born in Hanover, his father intended him to be a clergyman, but Iffland preferred the stage, and at eighteen ran away to Gotha in order to prepare himself for a theatrical career.

He received instruction from Hans Ekhof, and made such rapid progress that he was able to accept an engagement at the theater in Mannheim in 1779, beginning his rise into prominence. In Mannheim, he played the lead role &quot;Franz Moor&quot; in the acclaimed premiere of Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s The Robbers in 1782. He soon stood high in his profession, and enhanced his reputation by frequently playing in other towns. In 1796 he settled in Berlin, where he became director of the national theater of Prussia, and in 1811 he was made general director of all presentations before royalty.

Iffland produced the then contemporary, now classical works of Goethe and Schiller with conscientious care, but he had little understanding for the drama of the romantic writers. As an actor, he was conspicuous for his comedy parts: fine gentlemen, polished men of the world, and distinguished princes.

Iffland died in Berlin on 22 September 1814. He is buried in the &quot;Jerusalems- und Neue Kirche Friedhof II&quot; (Cemetery No. II of the Jerusalem&#x27;s Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg. A bronze portrait statue of him was erected in front of the Mannheim theater in 1864. A street in Berlin is named after him.

The Iffland-Ring bears Iffland&#x27;s likeness, and is borne by the most important German-speaking actor, as decided by his predecessor.

==Works==
The form of play in which Iffland was most at home, both as an actor and playwright, was the domestic drama, the sentimental play of everyday life. His works show little imagination, but they display a thorough mastery of the technical necessities of the stage, and a remarkable power of devising effective situations. His best characters are simple and natural, fond of domestic life, but too much given the utterance of commonplace sentimentality.

His best-known plays are &quot;Die Jäger&quot;, &quot;Dienstpflicht&quot;, &quot;Die Advokaten&quot;, &quot;Die Mündel&quot; and &quot;Die Hagstolzen&quot;. Iffland was also a dramatic critic, and German actors placed high value on his reasonings and hints about their works in his &quot;Almanach für Theater und Theaterfreunde&quot;. During 1798–1802 he issued his &quot;Dramatischen Werke&quot; in sixteen volumes, to which he added an autobiography (&quot;Meine theatralische Laufbahn&quot;). During 1807–1809 Iffland put out two volumes of &quot;Neue dramatische Werke&quot;. Selections from his writings were later published, one in two volumes, the other in ten volumes.

<text>The Jockey Club Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged four years or older. It is run over a distance of 1 mile and 4 furlongs (2,414 metres) on the Rowley Mile at Newmarket in late April or early May.

==History==
The event was introduced by the Jockey Club in 1894. It was originally held in the autumn, and was initially run over 1 mile and 2 furlongs.

In the early part of its history, the Jockey Club Stakes was open to horses aged three or older. It sometimes featured one or more of the season&#x27;s Classic winners. It was extended to 1 mile and 6 furlongs in 1901.

The race continued to be staged in the autumn until 1962. It was switched to the spring and cut to 1 mile and 4 furlongs in 1963. It was subsequently closed to three-year-olds.

The Jockey Club Stakes is currently held on the opening day of Newmarket&#x27;s three-day Guineas Festival meeting.

The leading contenders from the Jockey Club Stakes often go on to compete in the Coronation Cup. The last to win both races in the same year was Shirocco in 2006.

<doc id="741613" wikidata="Q2485397" url="?curid=741613" title="Raghib Pasha">
<text>Isma&#x27;il ibn Ahmad ibn Hassan bani Yani (), known simply as Isma&#x27;il Ragheb Pasha () (1819–1884), was a Greek Ottoman politician who served as a Prime Minister of Egypt and held several other high-ranking government positions.

Isma&#x27;il Ragheb was of Greek ancestry and was born in Greece on 18 August 1819 on either the island of Chios following the great massacre of Candia, Crete. After being kidnapped to Anatolia he was brought to Egypt as a slave by Ibrahim Pasha in 1830 and was converted to Islam. Immediately following his arrival, he studied at &quot;al-Maktab al-Amiri&quot; and obtained his advanced degree in 1834. He was fluent in Greek and was elevated to the rank of First Lieutenant by Egypt&#x27;s viceroy Muhammad Ali Pasha. In 1836, he became head of the Accounting and Revenue Agencies. He was promoted to the rank of &quot;bikbashi&quot; (Lieutenant Colonel) in 1840, then &quot;kaymakam&quot; (Colonel) in 1844, and finally &quot;amiralay&quot; (Brigadier General) in 1846.

He held the positions of Minister of Finance (1858–1860), then Minister of War (1860–1861). He became Inspector for the Maritime Provinces in 1862, and later Assistant () to viceroy Isma&#x27;il Pasha (1863–1865). He was granted the title of &quot;beylerbey&quot; and then appointed President of the Privy council in 1868. He was appointed President of the Chamber of Deputies (1866–1867), then Minister of Interior in 1867, then Minister of Agriculture and Trade in 1875. He again held the Finance portfolio in Muhammad Sharif Pasha&#x27;s first government (1879). After the fall of Mahmoud Sami el-Baroudi&#x27;s government, Isma&#x27;il Ragheb became Prime Minister of Egypt in 1882. Although his government was short-lived (it lasted from 17 June to 21 August only), it was the only one to present concrete programs. His achievements include the modernisation of the budget through the inventory of revenues and expenses, the Law on Salaries, and the &quot;La&#x27;eha Sa&#x27;ideyya&quot; as well as several agricultural laws.

Isma&#x27;il Ragheb died in 1884.

<text>The 1895 Duke of York Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run over a distance of 6 furlongs () at York in May.

==History==
An event called the Duke of York Stakes was introduced at York&#x27;s August meeting in 1895. It was named after Prince George, Duke of York (later King George V.) A middle-distance race for three-year-olds, its winners included Polymelus (1905), Papyrus (1923) and Firdaussi (1932).

A six-furlong handicap sprint titled the Duke of York Handicap Stakes was established at York&#x27;s May meeting in 1950. It continued until the mid-1960s.

The current 1895 Duke of York Stakes, a six-furlong conditions race, was created in 1968. The first running was won by Hard Water. It was given Group 3 status in 1971, and promoted to Group 2 level in 2003.

The Duke of York Stakes is now held on the opening day of York&#x27;s three-day Dante Festival meeting. It is run the day before the Dante Stakes.

The race has been renamed to distance it from Prince Andrew, the current Duke of York who faces allegations of sexual abuse, with the year 1895 added, referencing George V, a former Duke of York.

The Dante Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to three-year-old horses. It is run over a distance of 1 mile, 2 furlongs and 56 yards () at York in May.

<text>The Moscow Times is an Amsterdam-based independent English-language and Russian-language online newspaper. It was in print in Russia from 1992 until 2017 and was distributed free of charge at places frequented by English-speaking tourists and expatriates, such as hotels, cafés, embassies, and airlines, and also by subscription. The newspaper was popular among foreign citizens residing in Moscow and English-speaking Russians. In November 2015, the newspaper changed its design and type from daily to weekly (released every Thursday) and increased the number of pages to 24.

The newspaper became online-only in July 2017 and launched its Russian-language service in 2020. In 2022, its headquarters were relocated to Amsterdam in the Netherlands in response to restrictive media laws enacted in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. On 15 April 2022, the Russian-language website of &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; was blocked in Russia. In 2023, the Ministry of Justice of Russia designated the paper as a &quot;foreign agent&quot;. On 10 July 2024, the office of the Russian Prosecutor General announced that the newspaper was declared an undesirable organization.

Some American foreign correspondents started their careers at the paper, including Ellen Barry, who later became &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Moscow bureau chief.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
Derk Sauer, a Dutch publisher who came to Moscow in 1989, made plans to turn his small, twice-weekly paper called the &quot;Moscow Guardian&quot; into a world-class daily newspaper. Sauer brought in Meg Bortin as its first editor in May 1992, and the team used a room at the Radisson Slavyanskaya Hotel as its headquarters.

&quot;The Moscow Times&quot; was founded in 1992 by Sauer to reach US and European expats who had moved to Moscow after the fall of communism. He said: &quot;It was a completely different time, there was no internet and there was a huge influx of Western expats who didn&#x27;t speak Russian. At the time, they were the only ones with money in Moscow, so &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; was an interesting medium for advertisers&quot;.

The first edition of &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; was published in March 1992. It was the first Western daily to be published in Russia, and quickly became &quot;a primary source of news and opinion&quot; quoted in both Russia and the West.

It &quot;played an important role by giving space to Russian commentators&quot;. For example, in the fall of 1993, it was able to play a role in defeating the censors:

From the mid-1990s until 2000, it was based in the old headquarters of &quot;Pravda&quot;. In 1997, the website &quot;moscowtimes.ru&quot; was registered.

=== Expansion ===
In 2003–2004, the newspaper added Jobs &amp; Careers and Real Estate appendices, and in 2005 the &quot;Moscow Guide&quot; appendix, featuring high culture. The annual &quot;Moscow Dining Guide&quot; was also launched in 2005.

Until 2005, the paper was owned by Independent Media, a Moscow-registered publishing house that also prints a Russian-language daily newspaper, , &quot;The St. Petersburg Times&quot; (&quot;The Moscow Times&quot;&#x27; counterpart in Saint Petersburg) and Russian-language versions of popular glossy magazines such as &quot;FHM&quot;, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan Russia&quot;. That year, Independent Media was acquired by the Finnish publishing group Sanoma at an enterprise value of €142 million.

In 2006, the paper began its alliance with the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, while 2009 saw the launch of the &quot;themoscowtimes.com&quot; website.

In 2009, it published &quot;Russia for Beginners: A Foreigner&#x27;s Guide to Russia&quot;, written by foreign authors who offer advice based on their own experiences of living in Russia. The paper celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2012 with a gala dinner at the Baltschug Kempinski Hotel in Moscow.

In 2010, &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; began to publish in colour and launched the Travel Guide and Bar Guide projects.

=== After 2014 ===
In January 2014, malicious ads on the newspaper&#x27;s website redirected visitors to an exploit kit landing page. In December 2014, &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; was forced offline for two days by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. It was forced offline a second time in February 2015 for unknown reasons.

In April 2014 longtime editor-in-chief Andrew McChesney stepped down and was replaced by Nabi Abdullaev, a former &quot;Moscow Times&quot; reporter, news editor, managing editor, and deputy editor-in-chief who had left in 2011 to head RIA Novosti&#x27;s foreign-language news service. Shortly after his appointment, Abdullaev argued in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the west&#x27;s &quot;biased journalism ...robs the west of its moral authority&quot;. In Autumn 2015 Abdullaev was removed from his post and replaced by Mikhail Fishman, former head of &quot;Russky Newsweek&quot;.

In October 2014 &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; made the decision to temporarily suspend online comments after an increase in abusive and excessive pro-Russian trolling. The paper said it disabled comments for two reasons—it was an inconvenience for its readers as well as being a legal liability, because under Russian law websites are liable for all content, including user-generated content like comments.

In 2014, sister publication &quot;The St. Petersburg Times&quot; ceased publication. In 2015, Sanoma sold MoscowTimes LLC to , a former director of Kommersant. In 2017, the paper version stopped. The final paper edition appeared on 6 July. In July 2017 the operation of the paper changed to Stichting 2 Oktober, a foundation based in the Netherlands.

&quot;The Moscow Times&quot; currently belongs to a limited liability company which is 51% owned by Russian businessman Vladimir Jao, the CEO of an airline catering company, 30% by Svetlana Korshunova (), general director of the paper, and 19% by Derk Sauer, the original founder of the paper. Speaking to &quot;Kommersant&quot;, Derk Sauer explained that this is merely to comply with a Russian law which prohibits foreigners from controlling more than 20% of any Russia-based media company, since Sauer is a Dutch citizen. He further said that Vladimir Jao is an old friend of his, and &quot;he does not control the publication, he is a partner&quot;.

In March 2020, the online newspaper launched a Russian language edition.

Following the passage of a law restricting coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in March 2022, the newspaper moved its main editors to Amsterdam. On 15 April, Roskomnadzor blocked access to the Russian-language website of &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; in Russia after it had published what authorities called a false report on Russian riot police officers refusing to participate in the invasion. To make the website available within Russia despite blocks, it registered a range of domain names, sending links to the next current domain to readers via Telegram when one is blocked.

On 17 March 2023, &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; said it has been designated a ‘foreign agent’ by Russia&#x27;s justice ministry, which accused &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; of spreading inaccurate information about authorities&#x27; decisions, thereby forming a negative image of Russia. &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; said that the foreign agent legislation had been &quot;disproportionately used”.

On 10 July 2024, the Prosecutor General of Russia declared &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; an undesirable organization. This designation practically bans the &quot;Times&quot; from operating in Russia, as anyone working for them or interacting with them (such as by agreeing to be interviewed) could potentially be prosecuted and sent to jail.

== Separate publications and special projects ==
Inter-country annexes &quot;The Moscow Times&quot;: Russia–France, Russia–Finland, Russia–UK, etc. These editions are dedicated to bilateral issues of cooperation and promote establishing of business and investment programs of interaction between two countries. They focus on economic, trade, investment, inter-culture project, and tourism issues.

&quot;Real Estate Catalog&quot; and &quot;Real Estate Quarterly&quot;: regular specialized business editions about the real estate market.

&quot;The Moscow Times Conferences&quot; was a meeting place for Russian and foreign investors, businessmen and experts in Russia and abroad. In the second half of 2017, the Conferences were transferred to the Vedomosti–Practice brand.

<doc id="741634" wikidata="Q5363947" url="?curid=741634" title="Eljigidei">
<text>Eljigidei Noyan (, d. 1251) was a Mongol commander in Persia.

== Career ==
He was a commander of the Kheshig during reign of Ögedei, the second ruler of the Mongol Empire and the third son of Genghis Khan. Following the election of Güyük in 1246, he replaced Baiju, Batu&#x27;s protégé. He departed from Mongolia in September 1247 and arrived in Talas in April 1248, which coincided with Güyük&#x27;s death. Upon arrival in Khorasan, he stationed in Badghis region. Supposedly possessed of Christian sympathies like the khan, Eljigidei was ordered to advance into Syria, and planned an advance on Baghdad. This advance was, ideally, to be conducted in alliance with Louis IX of France, in concert with the Seventh Crusade. However, Güyük&#x27;s sudden death made Eljigidei postpone operations until after the interregnum. Still, Eljigidei wrote a letter from his camp in Khorasan. 

Eljigidei never managed to hold real command but only on paper. After the election of Möngke, however, Eljigidei and his two sons were implicated in an aborted conspiracy to declare the election invalid. Though supposedly innocent, Eljigidei was arrested and put to death as well in winter of 1251 or 1252. Baiju was subsequently returned to command in Persia.

<text>140 Siwa is a large and dark main-belt asteroid that was discovered by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa on October 13, 1874, and named after Živa (Šiwa), a Slavic goddess of fertility.

The &quot;Rosetta&quot; comet probe was to visit Siwa on its way to comet 46P/Wirtanen in July, 2008. However, the mission was rerouted to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and the flyby had to be abandoned.

Attempts to measure the rotation period of this asteroid have produced inconsistent results ranging from 14.7 to 32 hours. Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico during 2010 gave an irregular light curve with a period of 34.407 ± 0.002 hours and a brightness variation of 0.05 ± 0.01 in magnitude.

A 2004 study of the spectrum matched a typical C-type asteroid with typical carbonaceous chondrite makeup. There are no absorption features of mafic minerals found. The classification was later revised to a P-type asteroid.

<text>The Henry II Stakes is a Group 3 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged four years or older. It is run at Sandown Park over a distance of 2 miles and 50 yards (), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late May.

==History==
The event is named after Henry II, who founded a priory on the site of Sandown Park in the 12th century. It was established in 1963, and the inaugural running was won by Gaul.

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and for a period the Henry II Stakes held Group 3 status. It was promoted to Group 2 in 2002, and relegated back to Group 3 in 2012.

The leading horses from the Henry II Stakes often go on to compete in the following month&#x27;s Gold Cup at Ascot. The last to win both in the same year was Big Orange in 2017.

<doc id="741668" wikidata="Q126888162" url="?curid=741668" title="King Charles III Stakes (Great Britain)">
<text>The King Charles III Stakes (formerly the King&#x27;s Stand Stakes) is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at Ascot over a distance of 5 furlongs (1,006 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in June.

==History==
The event was created as a result of bad weather at Royal Ascot in 1860. Heavy rain made it impossible to run the Royal Stand Plate over its usual distance of 2 miles, so it was shortened to 5 furlongs on the only raceable part of the course. The amended version was called the Queen&#x27;s Stand Plate, and it subsequently became the most important sprint at the Royal meeting. For a period it was open to horses aged two or older. It was renamed the King&#x27;s Stand Stakes following the death of Queen Victoria and the accession of King Edward VII in 1901. 

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the King&#x27;s Stand Stakes was given Group 1 status in 1973. It was downgraded to Group 2 level in 1988.

The King&#x27;s Stand Stakes became part of a new international race series, the Global Sprint Challenge, in 2005. It consequently featured a number of high-quality contenders from overseas, and it regained Group 1 status in 2008. It is now the fourth leg of the series, preceded by the KrisFlyer International Sprint and followed by the Golden Jubilee Stakes.

It was renamed the King Charles III Stakes in 2023 to mark the King‘s 75th birthday. The race is currently held on the opening day of the Royal Ascot meeting.

<text>Software Automatic Mouth, or S.A.M. (sometimes abbreviated as SAM), is a speech synthesis program developed by Mark Barton and sold by Don&#x27;t Ask Software. The program was released for the Atari 8-bit computers, Apple II, and Commodore 64. Released in 1982, it was one of the first commercial all-software voice-synthesis programs.

Don&#x27;t Ask Software also sold &quot;PokerSAM&quot;, a poker game with speech, and also licensed out the S.A.M. engine for use with other games, such as &quot;Tales of the Arabian Nights&quot; for the Commodore 64.

==Technology ==
The Apple version uses an included expansion card which contains an 8-bit DAC, although hackers created a modified version of S.A.M. which can instead use the computer&#x27;s one-bit audio output (with the addition of much distortion) if the card is not present. The Atari version makes use of the embedded POKEY audio chip. Speech playback on the Atari normally disables interrupt requests and shuts down the ANTIC chip during vocal output. The audible output is extremely distorted speech when graphic and text display is turned on. The Commodore 64 makes use of the 64&#x27;s embedded SID audio chip&#x27;s 4-bit volume DAC, reducing its quality significantly vs the Apple and Atari versions. When producing speech, the Commodore 64 version blanks the screen as the program accesses memory, although a &quot;light&quot; mode can be activated that leaves the screen active, producing a &quot;gravelly&quot; voice. Active sprites also cause a deterioration in the quality of voice output.

==Legacy==
S.A.M. was used as the basis for the original MacInTalk speech synthesis software.

The technology was recreated for the voice of the character of &quot;SAM&quot; in the software Chipspeech.

<text>The Chiesa di San Giuliano (St Julian), commonly called San Zulian in the Venetian dialect, is a church on the Merceria, the main shopping street of Venice, in the parish of San Salvador, Venice, Italy.

Originally built in the 9th century, it underwent a number of reconstructions, including probably after the 1105 fire of the neighborhood. The façade was constructed in 1553-1554 by Jacopo Sansovino, and completed after his death in 1570 by Alessandro Vittoria.

The flattened classical temple façade was paid for by the scholar Tommaso Rangone, whose bronze seated portrait appears above the door. In his hands, the physician Rangone holds sarsaparilla and guaiacum, two plants which he used to treat syphilis and yellow fever. The reliefs also depict a map of the world as was known at his death. As befitting his broad-ranging interests in classical texts, the flanking inscriptions are in Latin (center), Greek (right) and Hebrew (left) text.

The interior was also designed by Sansovino, and the church consecrated in 1580.

==Main artworks==

<text>|}
















The Ribblesdale Stakes is a Group 2 flat horse race in Great Britain open to three-year-old fillies. It is run at Ascot over a distance of 1 mile 3 furlongs and 211 yards (2,406 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in June.

==History==
The event is named in honour of the 4th Baron Ribblesdale, who served as the Master of the Buckhounds from 1892 to 1895. It was established in 1919, and it was originally a 1-mile race open to three and four-year-olds of either gender.

The race was abandoned throughout World War II, and after it returned its distance was extended to 1½ miles. It was restricted to three-year-old fillies in 1950.

The Ribblesdale Stakes sometimes features fillies which ran previously in the Epsom Oaks. The leading participants often go on to compete in the following month&#x27;s Irish Oaks, and the last to win both was Bracelet in 2014.

The Ribblesdale Stakes is now held on the third day of the five-day Royal Ascot meeting.

<text>The Council for the Curriculum, Examinations &amp; Assessment (CCEA) is an awarding body in Northern Ireland. It develops and delivers qualifications, including GCSEs, AS, and A Levels, and provides curriculum support and assessments for schools. CCEA is a non-departmental public body and regulator, approving and monitoring Awarding Organisations offering qualifications in Northern Ireland.

CCEA was established on 1 April 1994 and based in Belfast. It is responsible for designing, developing, and administering examinations and qualifications, as well as overseeing the assessment and certification of students in Northern Ireland. CCEA advises the Department of Education on matters related to the curriculum, assessment, examinations, and external qualifications, as well as accrediting and approving qualifications.

CCEA conducts and moderates examinations and assessments, ensuring standards are equivalent to those of other awarding bodies across the United Kingdom. It publishes and disseminates information related to the curriculum, assessment, and examinations and develops teaching support materials for schools. 

Additionally, CCEA carries out research and development into the curriculum.

==Awarding qualifications==
CCEA offers a wide range of qualifications, such as GCSEs, including the new GCSE Double Award specifications in vocational subjects, GCE A and AS levels, Entry Level Qualifications, Keyskills, Essential Skills, and Graded Objectives in Modern Languages. Due to educational reforms of the Conservative Party under Prime Minister David Cameron, CCEA (among other UK examination boards i.e. Edexcel, AQA, OCR and WJEC) continuously redevelops syllabi for GCSEs and GCE A Levels. CCEA is a member of the Joint Council for Qualifications.

==Principal products and services==
CCEA’s principal products and services are to meet the requirements outlined in the Education (NI) Order. CCEA’s duties and functions are therefore to:

* Keep under constant review all aspects of the curriculum, examinations and assessment for grant aided schools and colleges of further education and to undertake statutory consultation on proposals relating to legislation;
* Advise the Department of Education (NI) or the Minister for Education on matters concerning curriculum, assessments, examinations and external qualifications and to accredit and approve qualifications;
* Conduct and moderate examinations and assessments, keeping standards in line with the rest of the UK;
* Publish and disseminate information relating to the curriculum, assessment and examinations;
* Develop and produce teaching support materials for use in schools and other educational Centres;
* Carry out research and development into curriculums, examinations, assessments, new media and software/hardware environments.

==Miscellaneous==
CCEA attracted media interest in 2014, due to allegations related to working conditions for some staff and the threat of strike action by CCEA’s recognised trade union NIPSA.

==Incorporated examination boards==
* Northern Ireland School Examinations and Assessment Council (NISEAC)
* Northern Ireland School Examinations Council (NISEC)

== Chief Executive ==
The Chief Executive of CCEA is responsible for the operational delivery of examinations and assessments to thousands of pupils across Northern Ireland, the monitoring of standards in qualifications, and the forming of relevant policy advice to the Department of Education.

Chief Executive - Gerry Campbell (March 2023 - present)

<text>WJEC () is an examination board providing examinations, professional development and educational resources to schools and colleges in Wales and Northern Ireland under its own name, and the Eduqas brand for England.

==History==
The Welsh Joint Education Committee was established as a consortium of Welsh Local Education Authorities in 1948, replacing the Central Welsh Board. It is now a registered charity, and a company limited by guarantee, led by a group trustees drawn from the local authorities in Wales and independents from both England and Wales. The organisation is based in Cardiff with a subsidiary company, WJEC CBAC Services Limited, providing specialist printing and publication services. WJEC is run on a day-to-day basis by a senior management team with experience in both the education and commercial sectors.

==Qualifications==

WJEC’s qualifications include traditional academic and work-related subjects at Entry Level, GCSE, AS/A Level, other level 3 qualifications such as Level 3 Diploma/Certificate in Criminology or Level 3 Diploma/Certificate in Medical Science as well as Functional Skills and Key Skills. As competition between examination boards on qualifications syllabuses and educational standards for GCSE and A Levels is often discussed in the media, WJEC was interrogated by the British House of Commons on this matter and published a written declaration where it responded to the questions asked by the UK Parliament. A recent report by the BBC shows that there is an increasing trend for exam papers to be remarked because of growing allegations of inefficiency in grading under WJEC.

WJEC has introduced a computerized assessment system for some subjects to improve the examination experience and increase efficiency of marking.

WJEC provides Qualifications Wales-regulated qualifications to all state schools and colleges in Wales. Independent schools in Wales may choose between qualifications regulated by Welsh Government or those regulated by the Government of the United Kingdom. WJEC also collaborates with the University of Cambridge to offer educational qualifications.

New GCSEs, AS/A levels and vocational qualifications have been developed to incorporate the changes as outlined by the Welsh Government in their own series of reforms.

WJEC also provides the Welsh Baccalaureate. This offers a programme of study incorporating working with employers, community activities, individual investigations and key skills, as well as students’ GCSEs, GNVQs or A level studies.

WJEC offers more than 13,000 past papers, mark schemes and marked exemplars free of charge via their website, along with digital resources in English and Welsh. WJEC also provides an Online Exam Review (OER) in order to provide instant exam results analysis.

==Eduqas==

WJEC offers qualifications regulated by England&#x27;s Ofqual through the brand Eduqas. The brand was developed as a response to diverging qualifications between England and Wales. Existing specifications being taught in schools and colleges in England continued to be branded WJEC until they were reformed (first teaching from 2015, 2016 or 2017) and relabelled Eduqas. Eduqas qualifications are also available in Northern Ireland, providing they meet CCEA Accreditation&#x27;s regulations. Some Eduqas qualifications are also available in Wales where no Qualifications Wales-regulated equivalent exists.

The WJEC brand is used only for qualifications regulated by Qualifications Wales. Some WJEC qualifications are also available in Northern Ireland and a very small number of vocational qualifications are available in England.

==Professional development==
WJEC runs a programme of professional development with their subject specialists and Chief or Principal Examiners throughout England and Wales.

==National Youth Arts Wales==
WJEC previously managed the National Youth Orchestra of Wales, National Youth Dance Wales and National Youth Theatre of Wales, under the joint brand of National Youth Arts Wales in partnership with .

In 2016, Welsh Government recommended that the ensembles become managed under one unified body. WJEC ceased to manage the ensembles as of 2017.

==Welsh for adults==
WJEC provides resources for adults learning Welsh, allowing candidates to show their speaking, listening, reading and writing abilities at different levels. They also provide Welsh examinations designed for adult learners.

<text>Thomas Mark Harmon (born September 2, 1951) is an American actor, writer, producer, television director and former football player. He is perhaps best known for playing the lead role of Leroy Jethro Gibbs on &quot;NCIS&quot;. He has appeared in a wide variety of television roles since the early 1970s, including Dr. Robert Caldwell on &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, Detective Dicky Cobb on &quot;Reasonable Doubts&quot;, and Dr. Jack McNeil on &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;. He also starred in such films as &quot;Summer School&quot;, &quot;Prince of Bel Air&quot;, &quot;Stealing Home&quot;, &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;, &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;, and &quot;Chasing Liberty&quot;.

Harmon played Secret Service special agent Simon Donovan in a four-episode story arc in &quot;The West Wing&quot; in 2002, receiving an Emmy Award nomination for the role.

Harmon&#x27;s character of NCIS special agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs was introduced in a guest starring role in two episodes of &quot;JAG&quot;. From 2003 to 2021, Harmon starred in the spinoff &quot;NCIS&quot; as the same character.

==Early life==
Harmon was born in Burbank, California, the youngest of three children. His parents were Heisman Trophy-winning football player and broadcaster Tom Harmon and actress, model, and artist Elyse Knox (née Elsie Lillian Kornbrath).

Harmon had two older sisters, the late actress and painter Kristin Nelson, who was divorced from the late singer Rick Nelson, and actress and model Kelly Harmon, formerly married to car magnate John DeLorean. His maternal grandparents were Austrian immigrants.

===College football===
After his high school graduation from Harvard-Westlake School in 1970, Harmon completed a two-year associate degree at Pierce College in Los Angeles. After his second season at Pierce, 1971, Harmon received offers from major college football programs, ultimately choosing UCLA over Oklahoma, even though in the previous season, 1971, the Sooners finished second in the nation, while the Bruins had stumbled to a 2–7–1 record, placing last in the Pac-8.

After transferring to the University of California, Los Angeles, he started as quarterback for the 1972 and 1973 Bruins.

During his first game, his UCLA team produced a stunning upset of the two-time defending national champion Nebraska Cornhuskers. The Bruins were an eighteen-point home underdog to the top-ranked Huskers but won 20–17 on a late field goal by Efren Herrera at L.A. Coliseum.

In his senior year, Harmon received the National Football Foundation Award for All-Round Excellence. During his two years as quarterback in coach Pepper Rodgers&#x27;s wishbone offense, UCLA compiled a 17–5 record (). Harmon was UCLA&#x27;s starting quarterback for two seasons, but he was not picked in the 1974 NFL draft.

Harmon graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from UCLA in 1974 with a B.A. in Communications.

He was inducted into the inaugural class of the Pierce College Athletic Hall of Fame in 2010.

==Career==
After college, Harmon considered pursuing a career in advertising or law. Harmon started his career in business as a merchandising director, but soon decided to switch to acting. He spent much of his career portraying law enforcement and medical personnel. One of his first national TV appearances (other than as an athlete) was in a commercial for Kellogg&#x27;s Product 19 cereal with his father, Tom Harmon, its longstanding TV spokesman. Thanks to his sister Kristin&#x27;s in-laws, Ozzie Nelson and Harriet Nelson, he landed his first job as an actor in an episode of &quot;Ozzie&#x27;s Girls.&quot; This was followed by guest roles in episodes of &quot;Adam-12&quot;, &quot;Police Woman&quot;, and &quot;Emergency!&quot; in mid-1975. He also performed in &quot;905-Wild&quot;, a backdoor pilot episode for a series about two L.A. County Animal Control Officers which did not sell. Producer/creator Jack Webb, who was the packager of both series, later cast Harmon in &quot;Sam&quot;, a short-lived 1978 series about an LAPD officer and his K-9 partner. Before this, Harmon received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his performance as Robert Dunlap in the television film &quot;Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years&quot;. In 1978, he appeared in three episodes of the mini-series, &quot;Centennial&quot;, as Captain John MacIntosh, an honorable Union cavalry officer.

During the mid- to late-1970s, Harmon made guest appearances on TV series, including &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, &quot;Delvecchio&quot;, &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot;, and had supporting roles in the feature films &quot;Comes a Horseman&quot; (1978) and &quot;Beyond the Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1979). He then landed a co-starring role on the 1979 action series &quot;240-Robert&quot; as Deputy Dwayne Thibideaux. The series centered around the missions of the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department Emergency Services Detail, but was also short-lived.

In 1980, Harmon gained a regular role in the prime time soap opera &quot;Flamingo Road&quot;, in which he played Fielding Carlisle, the husband of Morgan Fairchild&#x27;s character. Despite initially good ratings, the series was canceled after two seasons. Following its cancellation, he landed the role of Dr. Robert Caldwell on the series &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; in 1983. Harmon appeared in the show for almost three seasons before leaving in early 1986 when his character contracted HIV through unprotected intercourse, one of the first instances where a major recurring television character contracted the virus (the character&#x27;s subsequent off-screen death from AIDS would be mentioned two years later). In the mid-1980s, Harmon also became the spokesperson for Coors Regular beer, appearing in television commercials for them.

Harmon&#x27;s career reached several other high points in 1986. In January, he was named &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s Sexiest Man Alive. Following his departure from &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; in February, he played the lead in the television films &quot;Prince of Bel Air&quot;, co-starring with Kirstie Alley, and &quot;The Deliberate Stranger&quot;, in which he portrayed the real-life serial killer Ted Bundy. With his career blossoming, he played a role in the 1986 theatrical film &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Harry&quot; and the lead role in the 1987 comedy &quot;Summer School&quot;, again co-starring with Kirstie Alley and alongside future &quot;JAG&quot; and &quot;NCIS&quot; alum Patrick Labyorteaux. Returning briefly to episodic television in 1987, Harmon had a limited engagement on the series &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, playing Cybill Shepherd&#x27;s love interest Sam Crawford for four episodes. He then starred in the 1987 television film &quot;After the Promise&quot;. In 1988, he co-starred with Sean Connery and Meg Ryan in the 1988 feature film &quot;The Presidio&quot;, and also opposite Jodie Foster in the film &quot;Stealing Home&quot;. After his 1989 comedy &quot;Worth Winning&quot;, he returned to television, appearing in various television films.

Harmon&#x27;s next regular television role would be as Chicago police detective Dickie Cobb for two seasons (1991–1993) on the NBC series &quot;Reasonable Doubts&quot;. In 1993, he appeared in one episode in the role of a rodeo clown on the CBS comedy/western series &quot;Harts of the West&quot; with future &quot;NCIS&quot; castmate Sean Murray.

In 1995, Harmon starred in the ABC series &quot;Charlie Grace&quot;, in which he portrayed a private investigator. The series lasted only one season, after which he returned to ensemble medical shows on the series &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, in which he played Dr. Jack McNeil from 1996 to 2000. He also portrayed astronaut Wally Schirra in one episode of the 1998 mini-series &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;.
In 2003, Harmon had a supporting role in the remake of the comedy film &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;.

Harmon has also starred in several stage productions in Los Angeles and Toronto. At the Cast Theatre in Los Angeles, he performed in &quot;Wrestlers&quot; and &quot;The Wager&quot;. In the late 1980s he was part of the cast of the Canadian premiere of &quot;Key Exchange&quot;. Several productions of &quot;Love Letters&quot; provided him the opportunity to play alongside his wife Pam Dawber.

===&quot;NCIS&quot;===

In May 2002, Harmon portrayed Secret Service special agent Simon Donovan on &quot;The West Wing&quot; in a four-episode story arc. The role gained him his second Emmy Award nomination, exactly 25 years after his first. Donald P. Bellisario, the creator of &quot;JAG&quot; and &quot;NCIS&quot;, saw him on &quot;The West Wing&quot; and had Harmon appear in a guest starring role in two episodes of &quot;JAG&quot; in April 2003, where Harmon was introduced as the character of NCIS agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs. Starting that September, Harmon has starred as Gibbs in the CBS drama &quot;NCIS&quot;, a role which has earned him six nominations at the People&#x27;s Choice Awards including a win for Favorite TV Crime Drama Actor in 2017. During his time on the show, he was reunited with three of his former &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; co-stars, Rocky Carroll, Lauren Holly, and Jayne Brook. Since 2008, he has also been a producer and executive producer.

In the fourth episode of the show&#x27;s nineteenth season, Harmon&#x27;s Gibbs exited the series as a regular, an exit set in motion by the events of the previous season finale.

==Other activities==

Harmon received the 2,482nd star of the Hollywood Walk of Fame on October 1, 2012.

In 2014, Harmon started a production company called Wings Productions to produce &quot;&quot;. As of 2018, Harmon works as a producer for a new CBS series, based on author John Sandford&#x27;s best-selling &quot;Prey&quot; novels, which have sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. The last 10 have reached No. 1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-seller list.

Harmon also directed two episodes of &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; in 1999 and 2000, and two episodes of &quot;Boston Public&quot; in 2002.

In 2023 Harmon, with retired NCIS Special Agent Leon Carroll Jr., released &quot;Ghosts of Honolulu: A Japanese spy, a Japanese American spy hunter, and the untold story of Pearl Harbor&quot;. Harmon also narrates the audio book.

==Personal life==
Harmon is the son of football player Tom Harmon and actress Elyse Knox. His sisters are Kelly, an actress and model, and Kristin, an actress and painter. Kristin died of a heart attack on April 27, 2018.

Harmon has been married to actress Pam Dawber since March 21, 1987. The couple has two sons. His son Sean played a young Gibbs in several &quot;NCIS&quot; episodes. They maintain a low profile and rarely appear in public with their children. Harmon was the brother-in-law of Ricky Nelson and John DeLorean and is the uncle of actress Tracy Nelson and singers Matthew and Gunnar Nelson of the rock duo Nelson.

In 1987, Harmon filed for custody of his nephew Sam, Kristin&#x27;s son, on the grounds that she was incapable of good parenting. Sam&#x27;s psychiatrist testified that the thirteen-year-old boy depicted his mother as a dragon and complained about her mood swings and how she prevented him from being with his siblings. Harmon later dropped the custody bid.

In 1988, Harmon was part owner of a minor league baseball team, the San Bernardino Spirit, the same season Ken Griffey Jr. played for the team before his major league call-up to the Seattle Mariners the next season. Harmon used the team and their home field, Fiscalini Field, for the opening and closing scenes of the film in which he was starring, &quot;Stealing Home&quot;.

In 1996, Harmon saved a teenage boy involved in a car accident outside his Brentwood home. The passenger suffered severe burns, but survived his injuries.

<doc id="741707" wikidata="Q6489258" url="?curid=741707" title="List of the largest villages in England">
<text>Several places claim to be the largest village in England. This title is disputed as there is no standard definition of a village as distinct from a town and &#x27;largest&#x27; can refer to population or area.

A typical contender is Lancing in West Sussex with a population of around 19,000. Whilst Lancing might be described as a town in everyday use, it has not formally taken on this status and, in this case with three tiers of local government, it has a parish council rather than a town council. Also, it has a village hall instead of a town hall. All claimants must avoid having had a town charter or licence to hold a market from the Crown. Many other villages are in a similar position. Some of the claimants below, such as Cottingham, Great Baddow, Lancing and Rawmarsh, are part of larger urban areas and it can be contended that such claimants are suburbs or &#x27;suburban villages&#x27; rather than &#x27;standalone villages&#x27; which have a clear surrounding open space buffer zone.

The old simple definitions of a town is a settlement with:
*town charters (see the list of towns in England); or 
*with a regular market.

These two features have been long surpassed by large &#x27;new towns&#x27; on former villages such as Harlow which have neither feature yet have virtually no claims that they are villages.

The claim is therefore complicated by disputes over what renders a village a &quot;town&quot;, the usual trichotomy in current use of British English being village, town or city.

==Typical factors==
Definitions can refer to history of population growth or popular formulae based on types and quantities of key buildings (e.g. schools, retailers, railway/tram station, more than one church or community hall), limited business parks and maximum limits to the density of housing. The few large dispersed settlements, historically tied to one church community, and major changes to boundaries allow more elaborate claims. A third common criterion is simply stating it is a &#x27;village&#x27; in a nameplate or whole community organisation, which leads to city district such as Blackheath, London having a strong claim.

===Impact of postal towns and boroughs===
The country is split up into postal towns: settlements from village to city scale that can contrast markedly, but are carefully cited by some village contenders to rule out other villages. Others point to the fact that a rival village is in a borough.

===Parish criterion===
The typical English local government district contains a variety of settlements and, while planning law encourages the existence of buffers, the term village has no formal use and wards are not permanently fixed. Civil parishes exist in many such districts to add an extra rung to local government, with fewer major changes – they can contain divorced villages, neighbourhoods hamlets, often based on old ties to what was one community, an ecclesiastical parish which may be lost, such as by the building of a motorway.

===Popular definitions and changes===
Popularly, many settlements are described both as a town and a village by different people and/or can change over small areas. For example, Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire is widely considered a &quot;town&quot; yet its population is half that of Birstall in the same county, most organisations of which and writers about which describe it as a village.

Furthermore, settlements have a tendency to become denser and/or expand wider and, when they do, many residents may prefer to think of their home as a village rather than a town, and institutions such as a village green or village hall will tend to retain the name that they were given when the settlement was smaller. Since 1974, separation of rural settlements from urban settlements has not been important for local authorities themselves, and became less so with the new top-level authorities created that year e.g. Bessacarr, South Yorkshire was not part of the town of Doncaster before 1974; it is often spoken of as a suburb of Doncaster now, but, where described as a village today, then it was a ward with Cantley having 14,408 people in 2011.

===Consensus===
Such difficulties in measurement, and desires for different organisations to be called a town or a village, mean that the media has been free to pick whichever criteria it sees fit when choosing whether to describe a settlement as a town or a village.

==Contenders==
Places for which this claim has been made, and the reported population in the 2011 census (most recent all households census) include:

<doc id="741716" wikidata="Q26549" url="?curid=741716" title="Cherokee syllabary">
<text>The Cherokee syllabary is a syllabary invented by Sequoyah in the late 1810s and early 1820s to write the Cherokee language. His creation of the syllabary is particularly noteworthy as he was illiterate until its creation. He first experimented with logograms, but his system later developed into the syllabary. In his system, each symbol represents a syllable rather than a single phoneme; the 85 (originally 86) characters provide a suitable method for writing Cherokee. The letters resemble characters from other scripts, such as Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and Glagolitic, but are not used to represent the same sounds.

==History==

===Early history===

Around 1809, impressed by the &quot;talking leaves&quot; of European written languages, Sequoyah began work to create a writing system for the Cherokee language. After attempting to create a character for each word, Sequoyah realized this would be too difficult and eventually created characters to represent syllables. He worked on the syllabary for twelve years before completion and dropped or modified most of the characters he originally created.

After the syllabary was completed in the early 1820s, it achieved almost instantaneous popularity and spread rapidly throughout Cherokee society. By 1825, the majority of Cherokees could read and write in their newly developed orthography.

Some of Sequoyah&#x27;s most learned contemporaries immediately understood that the syllabary was a great invention. For example, when Albert Gallatin, a politician and trained linguist, saw a copy of Sequoyah&#x27;s syllabary, he believed it was superior to the English alphabet in that literacy could be easily achieved for Cherokee at a time when only one-third of English-speaking people achieved the same goal. He recognized that even though the Cherokee student must learn 85 characters instead of 26 for English, the Cherokee could read immediately after learning all the symbols. The Cherokee student could accomplish in a few weeks what students of English writing might require two years to achieve.

In 1828, the order of the characters in a chart and the shapes of the characters were modified by Cherokee author and editor Elias Boudinot to adapt the syllabary to printing presses. The 86th character was dropped entirely. Following these changes, the syllabary was adopted by the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot; newspaper, later &quot;Cherokee Advocate&quot;, followed by the &quot;Cherokee Messenger&quot;, a bilingual paper printed in Indian Territory in the mid-19th century.

In 1834, Worcester made changes to several characters in order to improve the readability of Cherokee text. Most notably, he inverted the &quot;do&quot; character (Ꮩ) so that it could not be confused with the &quot;go&quot; character (Ꭺ). Otherwise, the characters remained remarkably invariant until the advent of new typesetting technologies in the 20th century.

===Later developments===


In the 1960s, the Cherokee Phoenix Press began publishing literature in the Cherokee syllabary, including the &quot;Cherokee Singing Book&quot;. A Cherokee syllabary typewriter ball was developed for the IBM Selectric in the late 1970s. Computer fonts greatly expanded Cherokee writers&#x27; ability to publish in Cherokee. In 2010, a Cherokee keyboard cover was developed by Roy Boney, Jr. and Joseph Erb, facilitating more rapid typing in Cherokee. The keyboard cover is now used by students in the Cherokee Nation Immersion School, where all coursework is written in syllabary.

In August 2010, the Oconaluftee Institute for Cultural Arts in Cherokee, North Carolina, acquired a letterpress and had the Cherokee syllabary recast to begin printing one-of-a-kind fine art books and prints in syllabary. Artists Jeff Marley and Frank Brannon completed a collaborative project on October 19, 2013, in which they printed using Cherokee syllabary type from Southwestern Community College in the print shop at New Echota. This was the first time syllabary type has been used at New Echota since 1835.

The syllabary is finding increasingly diverse usage today, from books, newspapers, and websites to the street signs of Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and Cherokee, North Carolina. An increasing corpus of children&#x27;s literature is printed in Cherokee to meet the needs of students in Cherokee language immersion schools in Oklahoma and North Carolina.

===Possible influence on Liberian Vai syllabary===
In the 1960s, evidence emerged suggesting that the Cherokee syllabary of North America provided a model for the design of the Vai syllabary in Liberia. The Vai syllabary emerged about 1832/33. This was at a time when American missionaries were working to use the Cherokee syllabary as a model for writing Liberian languages. Another link appears to have been Cherokee who emigrated to Liberia after the invention of the Cherokee syllabary (which in its early years spread rapidly among the Cherokee) but before the inventions of the Vai syllabary. One such man, Austin Curtis, married into a prominent Vai family and became an important Vai chief himself. It is perhaps not coincidence that the &quot;inscription on a house&quot; that drew the world&#x27;s attention to the existence of the Vai script was in fact on the home of Curtis, a Cherokee. There also appears to be a connection between an early form of written Bassa and the earlier Cherokee syllabary.

==Description==
The modern writing system consists of 85 characters, each representing a distinct syllable. The first six characters represent isolated vowel syllables. Characters for combined consonant and vowel syllables then follow.

The charts below show the syllabary in recitation order, left to right, top to bottom as arranged by Samuel Worcester, along with his commonly used transliterations. He played a key role in the development of Cherokee printing from 1828 until his death in 1859. The Latin letter &#x27;v&#x27; in the transcriptions, seen in the last column, represents the nasal mid-central vowel, .

Notes:
The Cherokee character () has a different orientation in old documents, an upside-down letter V, flipped as compared to modern documents.

There is also a handwritten cursive form of the syllabary; notably, the handwritten glyphs bear little resemblance to the printed forms.

=== Detailed considerations ===
The phonetic values of these characters do not equate directly to those represented by the letters of the Latin script. Some characters represent two distinct phonetic values (actually heard as different syllables), while others may represent multiple variations of the same syllable. Not all phonemic distinctions of the spoken language are represented:

* Voiced consonants are generally not distinguished from their non-voiced counterpart. For example, while + vowel syllables are mostly differentiated from + vowel by use of different glyphs, syllables beginning with are all conflated with those beginning with . 
* Long vowels are not distinguished from short vowels. However, in more recent technical literature, length of vowels can actually be indicated using a colon, and other disambiguation methods for consonants have been suggested.
* Syllables ending in vowels, &quot;h&quot;, or a glottal stop are not differentiated. For example, the single symbol is used to represent both as in , meaning &quot;six&quot; (), and as in , meaning &quot;fishhook&quot; ().
* There is no regular rule for representing consonant clusters. When consonants other than &quot;s, h,&quot; or glottal stop arise in clusters with other consonants, a vowel must be inserted, chosen either arbitrarily or for etymological reasons (reflecting an underlying etymological vowel, see vowel deletion for instance). For example, () represents the word , meaning &quot;small (pl.), babies&quot;. The consonant cluster &quot;ns&quot; is broken down by insertion of the vowel &quot;a&quot;, and is spelled as . The vowel is etymological as is composed of the morphemes , where &quot;a&quot; is part of the root. The vowel is included in the transliteration, but is not pronounced.
* Tones are not marked in the script.

As with some other writing systems, proficient speakers can distinguish words by context.

If a labial plosive appears in a borrowed word or name, it is written using the &quot;qu&quot; row. This ~ correspondence is a known linguistic phenomenon that exists elsewhere (cf. P-Celtic, Osco-Umbrian). The &quot;l&quot; and &quot;tl&quot; rows are similarly used for borrowings containing &quot;r&quot; or &quot;tr/dr&quot;, respectively, and &quot;s&quot; (including within &quot;ts&quot;) can represent /s/, /ʃ/, /z/, or /ʒ/, as indicated in the above word &quot;juunsdi̋&quot;.

=== Transliteration issues ===
Some Cherokee words pose a problem for transliteration software because they contain adjacent pairs of single letter symbols that (without special provisions) would be combined when doing the back-conversion from Latin script to Cherokee. Here are a few examples:



For these examples, the back conversion is likely to join &quot;s-a&quot; as &quot;sa&quot; or &quot;s-i&quot; as &quot;si&quot;, as the consonant &quot;s&quot; can be written either with its own isolated glyph, or combined with a following vowel -- but the vowel itself doesn&#x27;t require being attached to a consonant. One solution is to use a middle dot to separate the two, While some use an apostrophe instead, apostrophes are also used to represent a glottal stop in Cherokee.

Other Cherokee words contain character pairs that entail overlapping transliteration sequences. For example:

* transliterates as , yet so does . The former is , the latter is .
* transliterates as , yet so does . The former is , the latter is .

If the Latin script is parsed from left to right, longest match first, then without special provisions, the back conversion would be wrong for the latter. There are several similar examples involving these character combinations: .

A further problem encountered in transliterating Cherokee is that there are some pairs of different Cherokee words that transliterate to the same word in the Latin script. For example:

* and both transliterate to 
* and both transliterate to 

Without special provision, a round trip conversion may change to and change to .

==Character orders==
There are two main character orders for the Cherokee script. The usual order for Cherokee runs across the rows of the syllabary chart from left to right, top to bottom—this is the one used in the Unicode block. It has also been alphabetized based on the six columns of the syllabary chart from top to bottom, left to right.

==Numerals==
Modern Cherokee generally uses Arabic numerals. In the late 1820s, several years after the introduction and adoption of his syllabary, Sequoyah proposed a set of number signs for Cherokee; however, these were never adopted and never typeset. In 2012, the Cherokee Language Consortium agreed to begin using Sequoyah&#x27;s numerals in some instances.

Sequoyah developed unique characters for 1 through 19, and then characters for the &quot;tens&quot; of 20 through 100. Additional symbols were used to note thousands and millions, and Sequoyah also used a final symbol to mark the end of a number. The glyphs for 1 through 20 can be grouped into groups of five that have a visual similarity to each other (1–5, 6–10, 11–15, and 16–20). The Cherokee Language Consortium has created an additional symbol for zero along with symbols for billions and trillions. As of Unicode 13.0, Cherokee numerals are not encoded within Unicode.

Sequoyah&#x27;s proposed numeral system has been described as having a &quot;ciphered-additive structure,&quot; using combinations of the characters for 1 through 9 with the characters for 20 through 100 to create larger numbers. For example, instead of writing 64, the Cherokee numerals for 60 and 4 () would be written together. To write 10 through 19, unique characters for each number are employed. For numbers larger than 100, the system takes on features of a multiplicative-additive system, with the digits for 1 through being placed before the hundred, thousand, or million sign to indicate large numbers; for example, for 504, the Cherokee numerals for 5, 100, and 4 () would be written together.

==Classes==
Cherokee language classes typically begin with a transliteration of Cherokee into Roman letters, only later incorporating the syllabary. The Cherokee language classes offered through Haskell Indian Nations University, Northeastern State University, the University of Oklahoma, the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma, Western Carolina University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the immersion elementary schools offered by the Cherokee Nation and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, such as New Kituwah Academy, all teach the syllabary. The fine arts degree program at Southwestern Community College incorporates the syllabary in its printmaking classes.

==Unicode==
Cherokee was added to the Unicode standard in September 1999, with the release of version 3.0. The character repertoire was extended to include a complete set of lowercase Cherokee letters as well as the archaic character ().

On June 17, 2015, with the release of version 8.0, the Unicode Consortium encoded a lowercase version of the script and redefined Cherokee as a bicameral script. Typists would often set Cherokee with two different point sizes so as to mark beginnings of sentences and given names (as in the Latin alphabet). Handwritten Cherokee also shows a difference in lower- and uppercase letters, such as descenders and ascenders. Lowercase Cherokee has already been encoded in the font Everson Mono.

The first Unicode block for Cherokee is U+13A0–U+13FF. It contains all 86 uppercase letters, together with six lowercase letters:

The Cherokee Supplement block is U+AB70–U+ABBF. It contains the remaining 80 lowercase letters.

===Fonts===
A single Cherokee Unicode font, Plantagenet Cherokee, is supplied with macOS, version 10.3 (Panther) and later. Windows Vista also includes a Cherokee font. Windows 10 replaced Plantagenet Cherokee with Gadugi after the Cherokee language term for &quot;working together&quot;.

Several free Cherokee fonts are available including Digohweli, Donisiladv, and Noto Sans Cherokee. Some pan-Unicode fonts, such as Code2000, Everson Mono, and GNU FreeFont, include Cherokee characters. A commercial font, Phoreus Cherokee, published by TypeCulture, includes multiple weights and styles.

<text>The Walser people are the speakers of the Walser German dialects, a variety of Highest Alemannic.
They inhabit the region of the Alps of Switzerland and Liechtenstein, as well as the fringes of Italy and Austria. 
The Walser people are named after the Wallis (Valais), the uppermost Rhône valley, where they settled from roughly the 10th century in the late phase of the migration of the Alamanni, crossing from the Bernese Oberland; because of linguistic differences among the Walser dialects, it is supposed that there were two independent immigration routes.

From the upper Wallis, they began to spread south, west and east between the 12th and 13th centuries, in the so-called Walser migrations (&quot;Walserwanderungen&quot;). The causes of these further population movements, the last wave of settlement in the higher valleys of the Alps, are not entirely clear. Some think that the large &quot;Walser&quot; migrations took place because of conflicts with the valley&#x27;s feudal lords. Other theories contend it was because of overpopulation and yet others that they were reinforced by the respective local authorities in order to settle previously unpopulated regions. Starting in 1962, every three years a meeting of Walser people called &quot;Walsertreffen&quot; occurs in a Walser inhabited area. 

==History==

The Walser people originate from the Swiss canton of Valais. Around 1300, they started to migrate. As of 2022, the reasons are not historically documented and are speculated to be due to overpopulation, climate change or poverty. 

In many places Walser settlers received the &quot;Walser right&quot; (colonist right), that is, personal freedom, with the right to form their own judicial communities and the right of the free hereditary rights of land. When a settler died, the estate passed to his heirs. The &quot;Walser law&quot; was granted against a moderate interest and the obligation to serve in the war.

==Geographical distribution==

In Switzerland, the German-speaking part of the canton of Valais is the original region of the Walser. There are 26 Walser communities that were settled by the Walser migration (and seven others that originally were, but where Walser German is not spoken any more). These are: Simplon, in Canton of Valais; Bosco/Gurin, in Canton of Ticino; and the following communities in Graubünden (Grisons): Obersaxen; Valsertal (Vals, St. Martin); Safiental (Valendas, Versam, Tenna, Safien); Rheinwald (Medels, Nufenen, Splügen, Sufers, Hinterrhein, Avers); Schanfigg (Arosa, Langwies); Albula (Mutten, Schmitten, Wiesen); Landquart (Davos, Klosters, Furna, Says, St. Antönien, Valzeina). Wartau, (Matug, Walserberg, Palfris) and Walser speaking people may live in the canton of Geneva.
In Italy, there are nine communities that were settled by the Walser migration (and four others that originally were, but where Walser German is not spoken any more (with exception of a few elders)). These are: Gressoney-La-Trinité, Gressoney-Saint-Jean and Issime (Lys Valley, in the Aosta Valley); Formazza, Macugnaga, Campello Monti (Verbano-Cusio-Ossola province); Alagna Valsesia, Riva Valdobbia, Carcoforo, Rimasco, Rima San Giuseppe, Rimella (Sesia Valley or Valsesia, in Vercelli province).

In Liechtenstein, there is one Walser community: Triesenberg, including Saminatal and Malbun. Until the 1930s, the dialects of Walser German and Romandy based on the French language was still spoken among a few hundred residents.

In Austria, there are 14 Walser communities: Grosses Walsertal (Blons, Fontanella, Raggal, St. Gerold, Sonntag, Thüringerberg), Kleinwalsertal (Mittelberg, a practical enclave of Germany), Brandnertal (Brand), Montafon (Silbertal), Reintal (Laterns), Tannberg (Schröcken, Lech, Warth), all in Vorarlberg; and in Paznauntal (Galtür), in Tyrol.

Additionally, Walser communities are reportedly found in Haute-Savoie, France (Vallorcine, in the Chablais), where the local Walser dialect is no longer spoken, and in the Berner Oberland (or Bernese Highlands), Switzerland (Grimseljoch-Sustenpass area, Lauterbrunnen, Mürren, etc.), where the local Walser dialect has assimilated to the (likewise Highest Alemannic) dialects of the Berner Oberland.

Some Walsers later settled portions of eastern Hungary, most were found in the Tokay wine region. Walsers, along with French Swiss speakers and French (Lorraine) vintners from the French with wine-producing skills arrived in the 19th century by invitation of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Their descendants in the early 20th century were known as &quot;Français du Banat&quot; or the &quot;Banat French&quot;, as well the &quot;Romandie de l&#x27;Ungerne&quot; or &quot;the Romandies of Hungary&quot;.

<text>Ve (В в; italics: &quot;В&quot; &quot;в&quot;) is a letter of the Cyrillic script. It commonly represents the voiced labiodental fricative , like in &quot;vase&quot;. It can also represent .

The capital letter Ve looks the same as the capital Latin letter B but is pronounced differently.

Ve is commonly romanized by the Latin letter V (as described by ISO 9), but sometimes the Latin letter W is used instead, such as in Polish, or by the German Duden transcription.

==History==
Both Ve and the Cyrillic letter Be (Б б) were derived from the Greek letter Beta (Β β), which already represented in Greek by the time the Cyrillic alphabet was created.

In the Early Cyrillic alphabet, its name was (&quot;vědě&quot;), meaning &quot;I know&quot;. In the old Russian alphabet the name was &quot;vedi&quot;.

In the Cyrillic numeral system, it had the value of 2.

==Form==
The cursive/handwritten/italic forms look like rounded like the capital letter or the symbol ϐ.

==Usage==
In Russian and Bulgarian, Ve generally represents , but at the end of a word or before voiceless consonants, it represents the voiceless . Before a palatalizing vowel, it represents .

In standard Ukrainian pronunciation (based on the Poltava dialect), Ve usually represents [ʋ] in the word initial position (or preceding most vowels) and a sound like the English W () when in the word final position. Because of this, it is not uncommon to see words ending in transcribed to end in , for example, = &quot;Vladyslaw&quot; for &quot;Vladislav&quot;.

Additionally, some Ukrainians also use this pronunciation in words where the letter is directly preceded by a consonant, while for others all occurrences of the letter Ve denote . In Eastern Ukraine, the letter Ve may represent a voiceless , but this is considered a Russianism, as word-final devoicing does not occur in standard Ukrainian. For example, the standard Ukrainian pronunciation of the word (&quot;[he] said&quot;) is . However, in Eastern Ukraine one is likely to hear the Russified (with final devoicing).

In Belarusian, the letter Ve represents only the sound . In the word final position, or if directly proceeded by a consonant, it mutates to the letter Short U (Ў ў), a Belarusian letter representing the sound . E.g., the Belarusian noun &quot;language&quot; is (&quot;mova&quot;), but the adjectival form is (&quot;mowny&quot;), and the genitive plural of the noun (formed by removing the final ) is (&quot;mow&quot;).

In Rusyn, the letter Ve represents the sound /v/, or /w/ if it is at the end of the word.

In Serbian and Montenegrin, the letter Ve represents only the sound /v/.

In Macedonian the letter is used for the sound /v/, but if the letter appears at the end of the word then it is pronounced as /f/. An example of this is the word бев [bɛf] (&#x27;I was&#x27;).

In Tuvan, it is used for /ʋ/.

In Mongolian, Kalmyk, and Dungan, it is used for /w/.

<doc id="741726" wikidata="Q1319600" url="?curid=741726" title="Levi Coffin">
<text>Levi Coffin Jr. (October 28, 1798 – September 16, 1877) was an American Quaker, Republican, abolitionist, farmer, businessman and humanitarian. An active leader of the Underground Railroad in Indiana and Ohio, some unofficially called Coffin the &quot;President of the Underground Railroad&quot;, estimating that three thousand fugitive slaves passed through his care. The Coffin home in Fountain City, Wayne County, Indiana, is a museum, sometimes called the Underground Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Grand Central Station&quot;.

Born near what became Greensboro, North Carolina, Coffin was exposed to and came to oppose slavery as a child. His family immigrated to Indiana in 1826, avoiding slaveholders&#x27; increasing persecution of Quakers, whose faith did not permit them to own slaves and who assisted freedom seekers. In Indiana, Coffin settled near the National Road with other Quakers in Wayne County, Indiana, near the Ohio border. He farmed, as well as became a local merchant and business leader. Coffin became a major investor in and director of the local Richmond branch of the Second State Bank of Indiana in the 1830s, Richmond being the Wayne County seat. His financial position at the bank and standing in the community also helped supply food, clothing and transportation for Underground Railroad operations in the region. 

At the urging of friends in the anti-slavery movement, Coffin moved southward to the important Ohio River port city of Cincinnati in 1847, where he ran a warehouse that sold only free-labor goods. Despite making considerable progress with the business, the free-labor venture proved unprofitable; Coffin abandoned the enterprise after a decade. Meanwhile, during this 1847 through 1857 period, Coffin assisted hundreds of runaway slaves, often by lodging them in his Ohio home across the river from Kentucky and not far downriver from Virginia. Kentucky and Virginia remained slave states until slavery was abolished after the American Civil War.

In his final decade, Coffin traveled around the Midwest, as well as overseas to France and Great Britain, where he helped form aid societies to provide food, clothing, funds and education to former slaves. Coffin retired from public life in the 1870s, and wrote an autobiography, &quot;Reminiscences of Levi Coffin&quot;, published in 1876, a year before his death.

==Early life and education==

Coffin was born on a farm in Guilford County, North Carolina, on October 28, 1798. The only son of Prudence (Williams) and Levi Coffin Sr., he had six sisters. Both of his parents were devout Quakers and attended the historic New Garden Friends Meeting. Coffin&#x27;s father was born in Massachusetts during the 1760s and migrated from Nantucket to North Carolina, where he farmed with other Quakers in the New Garden community.

As Coffin later explained in his autobiography, &quot;Reminiscences of Levi Coffin&quot; (1876), he inherited his anti-slavery views from his parent and grandparents, who had never owned slaves. The teachings of John Woolman (who believed that slaveholding was not fair) influenced the Coffin family. Coffin&#x27;s parents probably met Woolman in 1767 during religious meetings held near their New Garden home with other non-slaveholding Quaker families. His cousin, Vestal Coffin, probably attended the meeting and beginning as early as 1819, became one of the earliest Quakers to help slaves escape from North Carolina.

Educated at his rural home, Coffin received little, if any, formal schooling. Coffin related how he became an abolitionist at the age of seven when he asked a slave who was in a chain gang why he was bound. The man replied that it was to prevent him from escaping and returning to his wife and children. The event disturbed Coffin, who understood the consequences of a father being taken away from his family.

By the time he reached the age of 15, Coffin was helping his family assist escaping slaves by bringing food to escapees hiding on his family&#x27;s farm. As the repressive Fugitive Slave Law of 1793 became more rigorously enforced, the Coffin family needed to increase the secrecy under which they assisted escaping slaves, doing most of their illegal activities at night. Local scrutiny of known abolitionists worsened as North Carolina passed the 1804 Black Laws. By the early 1820s, Quakers in North Carolina were being openly persecuted by those who suspected them of helping runaway slaves. Nonetheless, in 1821 Coffin and his cousin, Vestal, established a Sunday School to teach slaves to read the Bible. The plan proved short-lived; slaveholders soon forced the school to close.

As persecution worsened, thousands of Quakers left North Carolina for what had been the Northwest Territory in Coffin&#x27;s childhood, where slavery had been prohibited since the country&#x27;s founding, then affirmed by the states created there. Plus, land was less expensive. (A large Quaker community that had already settled in what became Ohio and Indiana had been influential in securing a territorial ban on slavery.) In 1822 Coffin accompanied Benjamin White to Indiana. He stayed with the Whites for about a year. On returning to North Carolina, Coffin reported the prosperity in Indiana. Convinced that Quakers and slaveholders could not coexist, Coffin decided to move to Indiana.

==Marriage and family==

On October 28, 1824, Coffin married his long-time friend Catherine White at the Hopewell Friends Meetinghouse in North Carolina. Members of Catherine&#x27;s family were also anti-slavery activists and abolitionists and it is likely she met Coffin because of these activities.

The couple postponed their move to Indiana after Catherine became pregnant with Jesse, the first of their six children, who was born in 1825. Coffin&#x27;s parents moved to Indiana in 1825. Levi, Catherine, and their infant son followed his parents to Indiana later that year. In 1826, they settled in Newport (now Fountain City) in Wayne County, Indiana.

Like her husband, Catherine actively assisted fugitive slaves, including providing food, clothing, and a safe haven in the Coffin home. As Levi commented on his wife&#x27;s humanitarian work, &quot;Her sympathy for those in distress never tired, and her effort in their behalf never abated. Catherine White became known as Aunt Katie to slaves on the run.&quot;

==Career==

===Indiana===
Coffin continued to farm after moving to Indiana and within a year of his arrival he opened the first dry-goods store in Newport. In later years Coffin credited the success of his business, which he expanded in the 1830s, with providing him the ability to become heavily involved in the costly enterprise of the Underground Railroad, a risky enterprise that provided a network of stopover sites for fugitive slaves as they traveled north into Canada.

Although the term &quot;Underground Railroad&quot; did not come into use until the 1830s, the network was operating in Indiana by the early 1820s. According to Coffin, not long after moving to Newport his home became one of the Underground Railroad stops. A large community of free blacks also lived near Newport, where fugitive slaves would hide before continuing north, but they were frequently recaptured because their hiding places were well known to the slave catchers. Coffin made contact with the local black community and made them aware of his willingness to hide runaways in his home to better protect them.

Coffin began sheltering fugitive slaves in his Indiana home during the winter of 1826–27. Word of his activities quickly spread throughout the community. Although many had previously been afraid to participate, some of his neighbors joined the effort after seeing his success at avoiding problems. The group formed a more formal route to move the fugitives from stop to stop until they reached Canada. Coffin referred to the system as the &quot;mysterious road&quot; and as time progressed the number of escaping slaves increased. Coffin estimated that, on average, he helped one hundred escape annually. The Coffin home became the convergent point of three major escape routes from Madison and New Albany, Indiana, and Cincinnati, Ohio. On some occasions when runaways gathered at his home, two wagons were required to transport them further north. Coffin moved the escaping slaves to the next stops along the route during the night. Coffin had numerous collaborators. In Madison, George DeBaptiste&#x27;s barber shop was a key nerve center in the 1830s and 1840s.

Slave hunters frequently threatened Coffin&#x27;s life. Many of his friends who feared for his safety tried to dissuade him from his covert activities by warning him of the danger to his family and business. Coffin, who was deeply moved by his religious convictions, later explained his rationale for continuing the effort:

When neighbors who were opposed to his activity boycotted his store, Coffin&#x27;s business experienced a period of poor performance; however, as the local population grew, the majority of the new arrivals supported the anti-slavery movement and Coffin&#x27;s business prospered. He made a substantial investment in the Second State Bank of Indiana, established in 1833, and became a director of the bank&#x27;s Richmond, Indiana, branch. In 1836 he expanded his business to include a mill that processed flax seed used to produce linseed oil. He also established a hog-butchering operation, opened a paint shop, and eventually acquired of land.
In 1838 Coffin built a two-story, Federal-style brick home as his family&#x27;s residence in Newport. Because the Levi Coffin House, its present-day name, had so many fugitives passing through it, the home became known as the &quot;Grand Central Station&quot; of the Underground Railroad. The Coffin house had several modifications made to create better hiding places for the runaway slaves. A secret door installed in the maids&#x27; quarters on the second floor provided access for fourteen people to hide in a narrow crawlspace between the walls. The hiding space could be used when slave hunters came to the Coffin home in search of runaways. Because Coffin demanded to see search warrants and slave-ownership papers before allowing entry to his home, it was never searched and escaping slaves had been transported to other locations by the time the slave hunters returned with the documents.

During the 1840s, pressure was brought to bear on the Quaker communities that helped escaping slaves. 
In 1842 the leaders of the Religious Society of Friends (Quaker) advised their members to cease membership in abolitionist societies and end activities assisting runaway slaves. The leaders insisted that legal emancipation was the best course of action. Coffin continued to take an active role in assisting escaping slaves, and the following year the Quaker society expelled him from membership. Coffin and other Quakers who supported his activities separated and formed the Antislavery Friends; the two rival groups remained separate until a reunification occurred in 1851.

Despite the opposition, the Coffin family&#x27;s desire to help the runaway slaves only increased. Coffin&#x27;s wife, Catherine, who was also dedicated to the effort, organized a sewing society that met at their home to produce clothing to give to the runaways. She also provided meals and shelter to runaway slaves in the Coffin home. Other aid was obtained from neighbors and others who were sympathetic to the cause, but unwilling take the fugitives into their homes. Through these activities, Coffin was able to secure a steady supply of goods to assist in the ongoing operations.

Over the years, Coffin came to realize that many of the goods he sold in his business were produced with slave labor. Through his travels Coffin learned of organizations in Philadelphia and New York City that only sold goods produced with free (non-slave) labor. He began to purchase stock from these organizations and marketed free-labor goods to his fellow abolitionists, though the products provided him with little profit.

Free-labor proponents in the East also wanted to create a similar organization in the western states. In the 1840s, members of the Salem Free Produce Association approached Coffin to see if he would be interested in managing the proposed Western Free Produce Association. At first he declined, saying he lacked the money required to fund the venture, and that he did not want to move into the city. In 1845 a group of abolitionist businessmen opened a wholesale mercantile business in Cincinnati and the Free Produce Association raised $3,000 (~$ in ) to help stock the new warehouse with goods. Different groups continued to pressure Coffin to accept a position as the new business&#x27;s director, claiming there were no other western abolitionists qualified to manage the enterprise. Reluctantly, he finally agreed to oversee the warehouse for five years, in which time he could train someone else to run it, and in 1847 Levi and Catherine Coffin moved to Ohio.

===Cincinnati===
Coffin moved to the Cincinnati area in 1847, where he took over the management of a wholesale warehouse of free-labor goods. With the intention of returning to Newport, Indiana, after fulfilling his obligation in Cincinnati, Coffin rented out his Newport business and made arrangements for his Indiana home to continue serving as an Underground Railroad stop. At Cincinnati his first task was working with the eastern organizations to set up a steady supply of free-labor goods for the business. The enterprise&#x27;s ongoing problem was the poor quality of its goods. Coffin had difficulty procuring free goods, such as cotton, sugar, and spices, whose quality was competitive with the goods produced by slave labor. With inferior quality goods to sell, he had a difficult time finding purchasers for the goods. The problem plagued the business for years, causing the enterprise constant financial struggles.
The problem of obtaining good-quality free-labor products forced Coffin to travel south to seek out plantations that did not use slave labor to produce their goods. He met with only limited success. Coffin located a cotton plantation in Mississippi, where the owner had freed all his slaves and hired them as free laborers. The plantation struggled financially because it had no equipment to automate cotton production. Coffin helped the owner purchase a cotton gin that greatly increased the plantation&#x27;s productivity and provided a steady supply of cotton for Coffin&#x27;s association. The cotton was shipped to Cincinnati, where it was spun into cloth and sold. Other trips to Tennessee and Virginia were less successful, although he did succeed in spreading the word about the free-labor goods movement.

Despite his constant attention to the business, the poor supply and insufficient supply of free-labor products proved to be insurmountable, making it impossible for Coffin to find a replacement to run the company so that he could return to Indiana. The company remained in business primarily through the financial support of wealthy benefactors. Coffin sold the business in 1857, after deciding it would be impossible to maintain a profitable business.

Cincinnati already had a large anti-slavery movement who had violent conflicts with slavery proponents in the years before Coffin moved to the city. Coffin purchased a new home at the corner of Elm and Sixth Streets and continued to be active in the Underground Railroad. He also set up a new safe house in the city and helped organize a larger network in the area. At first he was very cautious about helping escaping slaves in the area until he was able to find local people he could trust and the community learned that it could trust him. 

Although Coffin and his wife moved several times during their years in Cincinnati, they finally settled at a home on Wehrman Street. With the large home&#x27;s rooms rented out for boarding and its many guests coming and going, the home provided an excellent place to operate an Underground Railroad stop without arousing much suspicion. When fugitives arrived they would be dressed as butlers, cooks, and other workers in uniforms that Catherine had created. Some mulattoes were able to pass as white guests. The most frequent disguise was a Quaker woman&#x27;s attire; its high collar, long sleeves, gloves, veil, and a large, wide-brimmed hat could completely hide its wearer when their head was tilted slightly downward.

One of the classic account of slaves that escaped on the Underground Railroad was Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s fictional work, &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, which relates the story of Eliza Harris, a young slave girl who escaped the South by crossing the Ohio River on a winter night. Barefooted and carrying her baby, the fictional Eliza was exhausted and nearly dead when she reached safety. After receiving food, clothing, new shoes, and shelter from Stowe&#x27;s fictional Quaker couple, Simeon and Rachael Halliday, Eliza continued her journey to freedom in Canada. Stowe, who was living in the city at the time, was acquainted with the Coffins, who may have been the inspiration for the Halliday couple in her novel.

Coffin&#x27;s role began to change as the American Civil War approached. In 1854 he made a trip to Canada to visit a community of escaped slaves and offer assistance. He also helped found a Cincinnati orphanage for Black children. When the war broke out in 1861, Coffin and his group began preparation to help the wounded. As a Quaker pacifist he was opposed to war, but supported the Union. Coffin and his wife spent almost every day at Cincinnati&#x27;s military hospital helping to care for the wounded. The Coffins prepared large quantities of coffee, distributed it freely to the soldiers, and took many of them into their home.

In 1863 Coffin became an agent for the Western Freedman&#x27;s Aid Society, which offered assistance to the slaves who were freed during the war. As Union troops moved into the South, Coffin&#x27;s group coordinated aid to slaves who had escaped to Union territory and began collecting food and other goods to distribute to former slaves who were now behind the Union lines. Coffin also petitioned the U.S. government to create the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau to assist the freed slaves. After the war he became involved in helping freed slaves establish businesses and obtain an education. In 1864, as a leader of the Freedman&#x27;s Aid Society, he sought aid in Great Britain, where his advocacy led to the formation of the Englishman&#x27;s Freedmen&#x27;s Aid Society.

After the war Coffin raised more than $1,000 in one year for the Western Freedman&#x27;s Aid Society to provide food, clothing, money, and other aid to the newly freed slave population in the United States. In 1867 he served as a delegate to the International Anti-Slavery Conference in Paris.

Coffin did not enjoy being in the public eye and considered his job soliciting financial aid as begging for money, which he thought to be demeaning. He stated in his autobiography that he gladly gave up the position once a new leader for the organization was selected. Coffin became concerned about giving money freely to all blacks, some of whom he believed would never be able to care for themselves unless adequate education and farms were provided. He also believed the Society should give their limited resources only to those who were best able to benefit from them. The Society continued to operate until 1870, the same year that black men were guaranteed the right to vote under the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Coffin spent his final years in retirement from public life. He spent his final year writing about his experiences and activities of the Underground Railroad. In his autobiography Coffin remarked, &quot;I resign my office and declare the operations of the Underground Railroad at an end.&quot; Historians consider &quot;Reminiscences of Levi Coffin&quot;, published in 1876, among the best firsthand accounts of the Underground Railroad.

==Death and legacy==
Coffin died on September 16, 1877, at around 6:30 p.m. at his home in Avondale, Ohio. His funeral was held at the Friends Meeting House of Cincinnati. The &quot;Cincinnati Daily Gazette&quot; reported that the crowd was too large to be accommodated indoors; hundreds had to remain outside. Four of Coffin&#x27;s eight pallbearers were free blacks who had worked with him on the Underground Railroad. Coffin was interred in Cincinnati&#x27;s Spring Grove Cemetery in an unmarked grave. Coffin&#x27;s wife, Catherine, who died four years later on May 22, 1881, is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery as well.

Known for his fearlessness in assisting runaway slaves, Coffin served as a role model who encouraged his neighbors to help contribute to the effort, although many were wary of providing them with a safe haven in their homes as he and his wife did. Best known for his leadership in aiding fugitive slaves, Coffin was first referred to as the unofficial &quot;President of the Underground Railroad&quot; by a slavecatcher who said, &quot;There&#x27;s an underground railroad going on here, and Levi&#x27;s the president of it.&quot; The informal title became commonly used among other abolitionists and some ex-slaves.

Historians have estimated that the Coffins helped approximately 2,000 escaping slaves during their twenty years in Indiana and an estimated 1,300 more after their move to Cincinnati. (Coffin did not keep records, but estimated the number to be around 3,000.) When questioned about his motives for aided fugitive slaves, Coffin once replied: &quot;The Bible, in bidding us to feed the hungry and clothe the naked, said nothing about color, and I should try to follow out the teachings of that good book.&quot;

On July 11, 1902, African Americans erected a tall monument at Coffin&#x27;s previously unmarked gravesite in Cincinnati.

The Levi Coffin House in Fountain City, Indiana, was named a National Historic Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. Indiana&#x27;s state government purchased the Coffin home in 1967 and had it restored to its original condition. The home features the actual secret hiding places where slaves would hide while on the run. Also featured at the home is an original false-bottom wagon where slaves would hide while Coffin would take them to their next destination without being discovered. The Coffin House was ranked as &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s Top 25 Historical Sites&quot; by the History Channel. In 2016, the Smithsonian named the Levi Coffin House Interpretive Center &quot;one of 12 new museums around the world to visit,&quot; while the Indiana Office of Tourism Development voted it as one of the top museums in the State of Indiana. The home opened to the public as a historic site in 1970.

<doc id="741729" wikidata="Q5012772" url="?curid=741729" title="CLLI code">
<text>CLLI code (sometimes referred to as CLLI name or Common Language Location Identifier Code, and often pronounced as &quot;silly&quot;) is a Common Language Information Services identifier used within the North American telecommunications industry to specify the location and function of telecommunications equipment or of a relevant location such as an international border or a supporting equipment location, like a manhole or pole. Originally, they were used by Bell Telephone companies, but since all other telecommunications carriers needed to interconnect with the dominant Bell companies, CLLI code adoption eventually became universal. CLLI codes are now maintained and issued by iconectiv, which claims trademarks on the names &quot;Common Language&quot; and &quot;CLLI&quot;.

CLLI codes are useful to telecommunications companies for ordering phone service, for the rating of call detail records for billing purposes, and to assist in tracing calls. CLLI codes are associated with Vertical and Horizontal coordinates (frequently abbreviated to &quot;V and H coordinates&quot;), which were developed by AT&amp;T researcher Jay K. Donald to provide a relatively simple method of calculating distance between two network locations. Various mileage-sensitive services are priced according to the V and H coordinates associated with the two endpoints&#x27; CLLI codes.

== Structure ==
The first six characters of a CLLI code represent the place the code refers to and contain two code elements:

* Four characters to denote the geographical area and the geographical area type (for example, city, town, and borough), known as the Geographical code element.
* Two characters to denote the state, province, or country, known as the Geopolitical code element. The codes HS (high seas) and EO (earth orbit) are reserved for ships at sea and satellites, respectively.

For the various code formats, the remaining two or five characters contain one of:
* A two-character building identifier, either two letters or two numbers, for telephone company buildings. Incumbent independent telephone companies will use two-letter identifiers with X as the first letter.
** The two-character building identifier may be followed by three characters to identify an individual switching or non-switching entity within the building.
* A non-building location, identified by a letter followed by four digits.
* A client site is identified by a digit, a letter, then three more digits for non-building locations.

There are four CLLI code formats.

===Network Site Code Format===

A Network Site code represents any existing or proposed building, structure, or enclosure, where there is a need to uniquely identify one or more network functions. Network Site codes are typically used to identify building locations, such as central office buildings.

* The first six characters are the city (four letters) and province/state (two letters). Each territory is normally identified using its two-letter ISO 3166-2:CA or ISO 3166-2:US postal abbreviation suffix (with exceptions: Newfoundland and Labrador as NF, Québec as PQ and Nunavut written as VU).
* The seventh and eighth characters in this format are known as the Network Site code element and denote the specific location or building address. These will be either two letters or two numbers; a X followed by a letter identifies a local independent telephone company building.

===Network Entity Code Format===

CLLI codes in the Network Entity format are the most commonly used CLLI codes. Network Entity codes are eleven-character codes used to describe the location and function of network equipment.

* The first eight characters are the city, province/state and network site location (see Network Site Code Format, above).
* The ninth, tenth and eleventh characters of a Network Entity code specify a particular type of equipment function at a Network Site location.
** Three-letter entity codes often begin with two letters to identify combinations of switching equipment such as MG (crossbar exchange - marker group), SG (step-by-step exchange - step group), CG (electronic switching system - control group), DS (digital switch), CT (concentrator) or RS (remote switcher).
** Non-switching entity codes may begin with A (administrative office space and computers), E (exchange switchroom), F (frame), K (software cross-connectable entity), M (maintenance group), P (test/service position), Q (radio tower), S (service centre), T (toll test) or W (miscellaneous), followed by anything except G (to avoid conflict with switches).
** Reserved final (eleventh) characters include B (&#x27;board&#x27; - operator and switchboard positions including &#x27;0&#x27; and &#x27;4-1-1&#x27;), D (various termination entities, including mobile or CLEC exchanges, hosted Centrex, 9-1-1 dispatch, time/weather and pre-recorded announcements), T (tandem), I, O, U, W or Y (not used). The specific type of board or termination entity is specified by the tenth character.

===Network Support Site Code Format===

A Network Support Site code represents any non-building structures or outside plant equipment such as Wireless Access Points, International Boundary Crossing Points, End-Points, Fiber Nodes, Junctions, Manholes, Poles, Base Transceiver Station / Radio Equipment and Repeaters.

This format contains 6 characters representing location and a 5-character Network Support Site Code element.

* The first six characters are the city (four letters) and province/state (two letters)
* The seventh character is a letter. X identifies any independent telephone company location. The letter otherwise is the location type: B (international boundary crossing), E (end point or non-international boundary), J (junction), M (manhole), P (pole), Q (radio location), R (repeater), S (toll station) or U (other or utility ()).
* The eighth through eleventh characters contain a four-digit identifying number.

The code for a communications satellite is STLT (satellite) EO (earth orbit) Q (radio location) then a four-digit identifier.

===Customer Site Code===

A Customer Site code is used to uniquely identify customer locations. These locations are required to identify customers, circuit terminations, facilities, or equipment for each specific customer for facility provisioning or other requirements. This format contains 6 characters representing location and a 5-character Customer Site Code element.

* The first six characters are the city (four letters) and province/state (two letters)
* The seventh character is a number, followed by a letter, then three more numbers.

Entities within client-owned buildings (such as Centrex installations) are coded in the same format as telephone company buildings.

== Examples ==

HSTNTXMOCG0
* HSTN = Houston
* TX = Texas
* MO = The AT&amp;T telephone exchange office at 4068 Bellaire Boulevard in West University Place, Texas—the office is known as the &quot;Mohawk office&quot;
* CG0 = The first (or perhaps only) electronic telephone switch at that location (in this instance, analog - now HSTNTXMODS0 as a digital switch)

This code shows two characteristics: 
* Telephone companies often give names to their central offices. The names frequently relate to the name given to the exchanges served from that office in the days of two-letter, five-number dialing, where a telephone number might have been referred to as &quot;MOhawk 3-1234&quot;. The numbers are now listed as all-figures, so (713) MOhawk x-xxxx becomes +1-713-66x-xxxx.
* The Geographical code field does not always align exactly with the city location. West University Place is an enclave of Houston, Texas.

PTLDOR12DS0
* PTLD = Portland
* OR = Oregon
* 12 = The Qwest (Centurylink/Lumen) &quot;Atlantic office&quot; at 2911 NE 24th Ave
* DS0 = The first (and perhaps only) digital telephone switch at that location. While some telcos use -CG suffixes for both computer-controlled analogue and full-digital electronic switching systems, -DS is always a fully digital switch.

Some telephone companies named their central offices, but did not reflect this name in the CLLI code, as in the above example with a numeric location code.

PTLEORTEDS0
* PTLE = Portland
* OR = Oregon
* TE = A specific address: 6038 NE 78th Court
* DS0 = The first (and perhaps only) digital telephone switch at that location

The item to note in the above example is that Portland is usually abbreviated as &quot;PTLD&quot;, but because of the relatively small number of possible combinations available in the two-character location code, the city abbreviation must occasionally be modified for locations added later, usually by incrementing the fourth character in the code.

DLLSTXRNDS1
* DLLS = Dallas
* TX = Texas
* RN = The Richardson office
* DS1 = The second digital telephone switch at that location

Note that this location is actually in Richardson, Texas, not Dallas. Apparently, the organizational structure of Southwestern Bell Telephone at the time considered Richardson to be within its own Dallas organization, although the cities themselves have always been legally separate.

SWASONXTSG1
* SWAS = Swastika, a 1908 mining village on the Ontario Northland Railway at the edge of Kirkland Lake
* ON = Ontario
* XT = X indicated a nominally independent telephone company, in this instance Timmins-area Northern Telephone Ltd.
* SG1 = a Western Electric step-by-step exchange

NorthernTel&#x27;s +1-705-642 exchange at 5 Cameron Avenue, Swastika was a throwback to a simpler era in which mechanical stepping switches rotated in response to dial pulses from rotary dial telephones. As a step-by-step exchange offers none of the calling features of an electronic or digital switch, these are becoming increasingly rare as mechanical switching equipment is displaced by electronics. This one held out a little longer than most as it was a small community in formerly independent telco territory, but was ultimately replaced by a digital remote station SWASONXTRSA controlled from Timmins TMNSONXTCG0.

OTWAON080MD
* OTWA = Ottawa
* ON = Ontario
* 08 = A Bell Canada co-location site on Iona Street in Ottawa
* 0 = Identifies a specific local exchange at the site (this one is Rogers Wireless)
* MD = A mobile phone exchange or competitor&#x27;s point of interconnection (POI) to an incumbent landline network.

Rogers is not a landline incumbent but a rival mobile telephone carrier with a block of 220000 Ottawa numbers. The Iona Street office (OTWAON08) is a co-location facility which hosts a landline exchange (incumbent Bell Canada&#x27;s OTWAON08 -CG0) and three rival mobile switches (-0MD is Rogers, -3MD is Telus, -AMD is Bell Mobility), one for each major wireless carrier.

Similar naming conventions apply for CLEC exchanges at a point of interconnection to incumbent carrier networks. The suffix -MD nominally refers to &quot;miscellaneous other termination entities&quot;.

MALTON22CG1
* MALT = Malton
* ON = Ontario
* 22 = An individual switching station (3255 Derry Rd E, Mississauga) located midway between Toronto&#x27;s city limits and the main airport
* CG1 = One of two electronic switches on the same site (both are actually digital Nortel DMS-100&#x27;s)

The city of Mississauga is a sprawling half-million person suburb directly west of Toronto. It is in Peel Region and therefore in a different local interconnection region, a different area code (905 instead of 416) and different, multiple rate centres (Clarkson, Streetsville, Cooksville, Malton, Port Credit; Bell Canada has no named &quot;Mississauga&quot; exchange despite the city&#x27;s incorporation in 1973).

This individual exchange, MALTON22CG1, serves multiple rate centres with different local calling areas for each. It is located 1800 metres west of the boundary between Toronto and Mississauga, serving a major international airport (in Mississauga) and that airport&#x27;s hotel strip (directly across the town line, therefore in Toronto). Callers from Markham would be a local call to the hotels but long-distance to the airport itself, even though both destinations are served by the same physical Digital Multiplex System switch.

This CLLI code identifies a wire centre (the location of the switch) only. A similar exchange on the other side of the town line (such as TOROON29DS0, located 900 metres east of Toronto&#x27;s western city limits at 40 Old Burnhamthorpe Road, Etobicoke and serving multiple rate centres) would be issued a Toronto CLLI to reflect the location of the switch itself, but follow the same pattern of a more restrictive calling area for individual subscribers outside city limits. Wire centre CLLI codes therefore do not suffice to identify a rate centre or V/H co-ordinates for toll billing; any +1-416 numbers are billed as if they were in downtown Toronto.

WFISON15RS0
* WFIS = Wolfe Island
* ON = Ontario
* 15 = The +1-613-385 exchange (in this instance, the only local exchange).
* RS0 = An automated remote switching centre (RSC). 

This is an unattended, automated remote switch housed in a small, square windowless brick building on a side street in Marysville village. It serves about 1400 people on Wolfe and Simcoe Islands in the Thousand Islands.

A Remote Switching Centre (RSC) has limited capability. It can operate autonomously to connect calls within the same exchange, but otherwise relies entirely on control via a single uplink to a host office (in this case, mainland Digital Multiplex System exchange KGTNON08CG0).

An electronic or digital exchange in a small city surrounded by rural villages most often will act as an upstream host for multiple remote switching centres, one in each local village.

<doc id="741731" wikidata="Q1415781" url="?curid=741731" title="Engine room">
<text>On a ship, the engine room (ER) is the compartment where the machinery for marine propulsion is located. The engine room is generally the largest physical compartment of the machinery space. It houses the vessel&#x27;s prime mover, usually some variations of a heat engine (steam engine, diesel engine, gas or steam turbine). On some ships, there may be more than one engine room, such as forward and aft, or port or starboard engine rooms, or may be simply numbered. To increase a vessel&#x27;s safety and chances of surviving damage, the machinery necessary for the ship&#x27;s operation may be segregated into various spaces.

The engine room is usually located near the bottom, at the rear or aft end of the vessel, and comprises few compartments. This design maximizes the cargo carrying capacity of the vessel and situates the prime mover close to the propeller, minimizing equipment cost and problems posed from long shaft lines. On some ships, the engine room may be situated mid-ship, such as on vessels built from 1900 to the 1960s, or forward and even high, such as on diesel-electric vessels.

==Equipment==
===Engines===

The engine room of a motor vessel typically contains several engines for different purposes. Main, or propulsion, engines are used to turn the ship&#x27;s propeller and move the ship through the water. They typically burn diesel oil or heavy fuel oil, and may be able to switch between the two. There are many propulsion arrangements for motor vessels, some including multiple engines, propellers, and gearboxes.

Smaller, but still large engines drive electrical generators that provide power for the ship&#x27;s electrical systems. Large ships typically have three or more synchronized generators to ensure smooth operation. The combined output of a ship&#x27;s generators is well above the actual power requirement to accommodate maintenance or the loss of one generator.

On a steamship, power for both electricity and propulsion is provided by one or more large boilers giving rise to the alternate name boiler room. High pressure steam from the boiler is used to drive reciprocating engines or turbines for propulsion, and also turbo generators for electricity. Besides propulsion and auxiliary engines, a typical engine room contains many smaller engines, including generators, air compressors, feed pumps, and fuel pumps. Today, these machines are usually powered by small diesel engines or electric motors, but may also use low-pressure steam.

===Engine cooling===

The engine(s) get required cooling from liquid-to-liquid heat exchangers connected to fresh seawater or divertible to recirculate through tanks of seawater in the engine room. Both supplies draw heat from the engines via the coolant and oil lines. Heat exchangers are plumbed in so that oil is represented by a yellow mark on the flange of the pipes, and relies on paper type gaskets to seal the mating faces of the pipes. Sea water, or brine, is represented by a green mark on the flanges and internal coolant is represented by blue marks on the flanges.

===Thrusters===
In addition to this array of equipment is the ship&#x27;s thruster system (on modern vessels fitted with this equipment), typically operated by electric motors controlled from the bridge. These thrusters are laterally mounted propellers that can suck or blow water from port to starboard (i.e. left to right) or vice versa. They are normally used only in maneuvering, e.g. docking operations, and are often banned in tight confines, e.g. drydocks.

Thrusters, like main propellers, are reversible by hydraulic operation. Small embedded hydraulic motors rotate the blades up to 180 degrees to reverse the direction of the thrust. A variant on this is the azipod, which are propellers mounted in a swiveling pod that can rotate to direct thrust in any direction, making fine steering easier, and allowing a ship to move sideways up to a dock, when used in conjunction with a bow thruster.

== Engine Control Room ==

Modern merchant vessels have a special space inside the Engine Room called Engine Control Room (ECR). This is the place where all machinery could be remotely observed and controlled. There are situated also most of or at least main electricity breakers. ECR is connected with the Bridge through compulsory engine-room telegraph which provides visual indication of the orders and responses. Other means of communication are phone and emergency phone lines as well as LAN cables or fiber-optic cables depending on distance.

Human presence is not required to be round the clock in the ER due to high level of automation and computerization. Unattended machinery spaces are common practice nowadays.

==Safety==
===Fire precautions===
Engine rooms are noisy, hot, usually dirty, and potentially dangerous. The presence of flammable fuel, high voltage (HV) electrical equipment and internal combustion engines (ICE) means that a serious fire hazard exists in the engine room, which is monitored continuously by the ship&#x27;s engine department and various monitoring systems.

===Ventilation===

If equipped with internal combustion or turbine engines, engine rooms employ some means of providing air for the operation of the engines and associated ventilation. If individuals are normally present in these rooms, additional ventilation should be available to keep engine room temperatures to acceptable limits. If personnel are not normally in the engine space, as in many pleasure boats, the ventilation need only be sufficient to supply the engines with intake air. This would require an unrestricted hull opening of the same size as the intake area of the engine itself, assuming the hull opening is in the engine room itself. Commonly, screens are placed over such openings and if this is done, airflow is reduced by approximately 50%, so the opening area is increased appropriately. The requirement for general ventilation and the requirement for sufficient combustion air are quite different. A typical arrangement might be to make the opening large enough to provide intake air plus 1000 Cubic Feet per Minute (CFM) for additional ventilation. Engines pull sufficient air into the engine room for their own operation. However, additional airflow for ventilation usually requires intake and exhaust blowers.

==History==
Engine rooms were separated from its associated fire room on fighting ships from the 1880s through the 1960s. If either experienced damage putting it out of action, the associated engine room could get steam from another fire room.

<text>David M. Alexander, born in 1945 in upstate New York, is a writer of science fiction and mysteries who now lives in Palo Alto, California. Novels published under his own name are &quot;The Chocolate Spy&quot;, &quot;Fane&quot;, and &quot;My Real Name Is Lisa&quot;. Beginning in 2003, however, to avoid confusion with other writers with the same name, he began publishing under the pen name of David Grace: in that year Wildside Press published &quot;The Eyes Of The Blind&quot; under the David Grace name. All subsequent works, both novels and stories in magazines, have been published as by David Grace. He has written ten stories for leading magazines: science-fiction for &quot;Analog&quot; both by himself and as a collaborator with Hayford Peirce, and mysteries for &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;. Alexander shared story credit with Dan Wright and Sam Egan for an &quot;Outer Limits&quot; TV series episode, &quot;Joyride&quot;, starring Cliff Robertson that was broadcast during the 2000 season.

The film rights for &quot;My Real Name Is Lisa&quot; were optioned for a substantial amount of money for a two-hour television movie but because of casting issues the project was terminated. It has never subsequently been filmed.

Alexander graduated from Stanford University in 1967 with a major in history and a minor in economics, then received a Doctor of Laws degree from the. University of California, Berkeley Law School, in June 1970, graduating in the top ten percent of his class. He was licensed to practice law in California in January 1971 and in November 1977 was sworn in by Chief Justice Warren Burger and authorized to argue cases before the Supreme Court of the United States.

He is a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. A longtime friend of noted science-fiction and fantasy writer Jack Vance, he has had a planet named after him in Vance&#x27;s &quot;The Face&quot; and a famous law-giver named after him in &quot;Night Lamp&quot;.

<text>Heeb is a Jewish website (and from 2001 to 2010, a quarterly magazine) aimed predominantly at young Jews. The name of the publication is a variation of the ethnic slur &quot;hebe&quot;, an abbreviation of Hebrew. However, in this case, the word &quot;heeb&quot; seeks to function as empowerment for the Jewish community, thus eliminating the hatred associated with the word. 

==Origin==
The magazine was founded by Jennifer Bleyer, a graduate of Columbia University, and backed financially by Steven Spielberg and Charles Bronfman. Bleyer, who now writes for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, ended her association with the magazine in 2003. Taking over for her as editor and publisher was Harvard Divinity School graduate Joshua Neuman. Neuman&#x27;s goal was to spread the idea of &quot;Heeb&quot; as a &quot;lifestyle magazine&quot;, incorporating events like a traveling &quot;Heeb&quot; Storytelling show in order to reach an underserved Jewish progressive market around the country. The magazine&#x27;s subtitle was &quot;The New Jew Review&quot;.

==Highlights==
It has become known for its satire and sardonic approach to reaching Jewish readers of all streams. In a late 2006 edition, a live pig was photographed running across a traditional Sabbath dinner table. &quot;Heeb&quot;’s satirist, David Deutsch, who used his own table to stage the photos asked his rabbi if it were kosher to use a live pig on his table for this purpose, as pig meat is considered unkosher. His rabbi said it wasn&#x27;t a problem, but recommended that he wash the table afterwards.

The magazine is decidedly anti-establishment and left-wing. It frequently criticizes mainstream American Jewish culture, most famously in an article entitled &quot;Joe Lieberman is a Dickhead.&quot; The author of the piece took Lieberman to task for favoring an increase in military spending. Other writers who have contributed to &quot;Heeb&quot; include Allen Salkin, who wrote &quot;Where Have You Gone Sandy Koufax?&quot;, an article about Jews obsessed with Jews in sports, and &quot;Why are We So Guilty?&quot;.

&quot;Heeb&quot; has produced events around the world, including the &quot;Heeb&quot; Storytelling series. The series has been attended by Natalie Portman, Rose McGowan, Kate Beckinsale and Colin Farrell.

In March 2004, in its fifth issue, &quot;Heeb&quot; featured the photo spread entitled &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot; that spoofed Mel Gibson&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;. The spread included a half naked Virgin Mary (with pierced nipples) and a Jesus with his genitals wrapped in a tallit. 

The Catholic League, in its 2004 Report on Anti-Catholicism stated: 
:The Jewish magazine &quot;Heeb&quot; published a 10-page photo feature in its Winter 2004 edition mocking Mel Gibson&#x27;s movie &#x27;The Passion of the Christ&#x27; called &#x27;Back Off, Braveheart&#x27;. The editors who introduced the spread said that the death of Jesus was &#x27;summarily blamed upon the Jews&#x27;, until this &#x27;fondly held belief seemed destined to fade forever&#x27; after Vatican II. A sexually suggestive Jesus played by artist Carlos J. Da Silva wears a Jewish prayer shawl as a loin cloth, and the Blessed Mother was shown exposing her breasts and body piercing. The occupation of the model photographed as Mary Magdalene was described as &#x27;Evangelist-cum-nymphomaniac country singer&#x27;. She was quoted as saying, &#x27;Who killed Jesus? Ryan Adams.&#x27; The woman who was photographed as Pontius Pilate was quoted as saying, &#x27;Christians believe the Jews killed Jesus; that is why there is so much anti-Semitism in the world. The church was created on that one simple anti-Semitic principle. Christians who say otherwise are making it up or misrepresenting their own religion.&#x27;

Abraham Foxman, director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) published a letter to &quot;Heeb&quot; decrying the spread as &quot;blasphemous to both Christians and Jews&quot;.

On the April 27, 2004, episode of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, Jon Stewart remarked &quot;the best solution to international terrorism? The giveaway. For any international terrorist who turns himself in—a free lifetime subscription to &quot;Heeb&quot;.&quot;

On June 17, 2004, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; named &quot;Heeb&quot; one of America&#x27;s &quot;50 best magazines.&quot;

In 2005, Ramones front man, Joey Ramone, posthumously received the Heeb Magazine &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; at the first Jewish Music Awards.

In January 2006, &quot;Heeb&quot; was included as part of the Library of Congress&#x27; exhibition &quot;350 Years of Jewish Life in America.&quot;

A March 28, 2007, feature in &quot;The New York Times&quot; Business Section spotlighted how &quot;Heeb&quot; did creative work for advertisers seeking to reach a young Jewish demographic. The article was accompanied by a photo of three men dressed as Hasidic versions of characters from &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.

Robert Crumb and wife Aline Kominsky-Crumb illustrated the cover of the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Love Issue&quot; in the Spring of 2007. As Aline told the magazine in an interview: &quot;I had read Robert&#x27;s work before I met him and I thought he was Jewish because he&#x27;s just so whiny.&quot;

&quot;Rush Hour&quot; director Brett Ratner guest edited &quot;Heeb&quot;&#x27;s 2008 Summer Edition and included what the magazine claimed to be the first-ever Jewish swimsuit calendar, for the Jewish year 5769, &quot;The Ladies of &#x27;69.&quot; The calendar was photographed by &quot;Elle&quot; magazine cover photographer Gilles Bensimon and featured Israeli supermodels Bar Refaeli, Esti Ginzberg and Moran Atias, among others. Ratner also photographed director Roman Polanski at Auschwitz, the site of the Polish-born director&#x27;s mother&#x27;s murder during the Holocaust. 

In the Fall of 2008, &quot;Heeb&quot; released its &quot;Politics Issue.&quot; The cover, a group of coins being dropped into a hand, was designed by Shepard Fairey&#x27;s Studio Number One and was a play on Fairey&#x27;s iconic Obama &quot;Change&quot; image.

In &quot;Heeb&quot;&#x27;s Winter 2008 edition, Courtney Love told &quot;Heeb&quot; of ex-husband Kurt Cobain&#x27;s legacy: &quot;Every time you buy a Nirvana record, part of that money is not going to Kurt&#x27;s child, or to me, it&#x27;s going to a handful of Jew loan officers, Jew private banks, it&#x27;s going to lawyers who are also bankers...&quot;

In 2009 &quot;Heeb&quot; released an anthology from its &quot;Heeb&quot; Storytelling Series titled &quot;Sex, Drugs &amp; Gefilte Fish&quot;. In 2009 and 2010, &quot;Heeb&quot; published its countdown list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Jewish Movie Moments,&quot; which awarded its top spot to The Big Lebowski.

&quot;Heeb&quot; ceased publishing the print edition of its magazine in 2010, but continues to publish a daily weblog.

== Trademark controversy ==
Heeb Media, LLC has owned the trademark registration for &quot;Heeb&quot; magazine publications since 29 June 2004. On 1 February 2005, the application was submitted to receive another registration number for the use of &quot;Heeb&quot; for apparel and entertainment. The original application was denied under Section 2(a) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C.§1052(a). Heeb Media submitted an appeal to the Trademark Trail and Appeal Board (TTAB) at the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on 26 November 2008, but it was officially denied and abandoned in June 2009. As record of evidence, Heeb Media submitted letters of their own, which stated that the magazine, although criticised by some Jewish and non-Jewish communities that may take offence to the name &quot;Heeb&quot;, it is widely accepted among the Jewish student population. The Administrative Trademark judge, Karen Kuhlke stated in the official comments that although the applicant submitted sufficient information, it was still not foreseeable to justify the term Heeb as something non-derogative. Kuhlke was also the judge for the Redskins appeal in 2014, in which she cited the &quot;Heeb&quot; case.

== Roseanne Barr controversy ==
In 2009, &quot;Heeb&quot; produced its controversial Germany Issue in which Roseanne Barr posed as Adolf Hitler in drag holding a tray of &quot;burned Jew cookies.&quot; The photo invoked the ire of Bill O&#x27;Reilly on Fox&#x27;s &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;. According to Heeb&#x27;s publisher at the time, Joshua Neuman, it was intended as means to see if joking about Nazis and the Holocaust still evoked the same reactions as in past years. In 2011 Barr stated that it was intended to show that the Holocaust is just an every day thing and it is something that needs to be stopped. Additional controversy about the photos intentions came about in 2018 after the &quot;Roseanne&quot; revival aired and they were questioned during an interview. Barr posted on social media, defending her position, but it was not taken lightly by viewers and through her comments to do so she made offensive remarks which resulted in ABC cancelling the show.

<text>In probability theory, a Chernoff bound is an exponentially decreasing upper bound on the tail of a random variable based on its moment generating function. The minimum of all such exponential bounds forms &quot;the&quot; Chernoff or Chernoff-Cramér bound, which may decay faster than exponential (e.g. sub-Gaussian). It is especially useful for sums of independent random variables, such as sums of Bernoulli random variables.

The bound is commonly named after Herman Chernoff who described the method in a 1952 paper, though Chernoff himself attributed it to Herman Rubin. In 1938 Harald Cramér had published an almost identical concept now known as Cramér&#x27;s theorem.

It is a sharper bound than the first- or second-moment-based tail bounds such as Markov&#x27;s inequality or Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality, which only yield power-law bounds on tail decay. However, when applied to sums the Chernoff bound requires the random variables to be independent, a condition that is not required by either Markov&#x27;s inequality or Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality.

The Chernoff bound is related to the Bernstein inequalities. It is also used to prove Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality, Bennett&#x27;s inequality, and McDiarmid&#x27;s inequality.

== Generic Chernoff bounds ==

The generic Chernoff bound for a random variable formula_1 is attained by applying Markov&#x27;s inequality to formula_2 (which is why it is sometimes called the &quot;exponential Markov&quot; or &quot;exponential moments&quot; bound). For positive formula_3 this gives a bound on the right tail of formula_1 in terms of its moment-generating function formula_5:

:formula_6

Since this bound holds for every positive formula_3, we may take the infimum:

:formula_8
Performing the same analysis with negative formula_3 we get a similar bound on the left tail:
:formula_10

and

:formula_11
The quantity formula_12 can be expressed as the expectation value formula_13, or equivalently formula_14.

=== Properties ===

The exponential function is convex, so by Jensen&#x27;s inequality formula_15. It follows that the bound on the right tail is greater or equal to one when formula_16, and therefore trivial; similarly, the left bound is trivial for formula_17. We may therefore combine the two infima and define the two-sided Chernoff bound:formula_18which provides an upper bound on the folded cumulative distribution function of formula_1 (folded at the mean, not the median).

The logarithm of the two-sided Chernoff bound is known as the rate function (or &quot;Cramér transform&quot;) formula_20. It is equivalent to the Legendre–Fenchel transform or convex conjugate of the cumulant generating function formula_21, defined as: formula_22The moment generating function is log-convex, so by a property of the convex conjugate, the Chernoff bound must be log-concave. The Chernoff bound attains its maximum at the mean, formula_23, and is invariant under translation: formula_24.

The Chernoff bound is exact if and only if formula_1 is a single concentrated mass (degenerate distribution). The bound is tight only at or beyond the extremes of a bounded random variable, where the infima are attained for infinite formula_3. For unbounded random variables the bound is nowhere tight, though it is asymptotically tight up to sub-exponential factors (&quot;exponentially tight&quot;). Individual moments can provide tighter bounds, at the cost of greater analytical complexity.

In practice, the exact Chernoff bound may be unwieldy or difficult to evaluate analytically, in which case a suitable upper bound on the moment (or cumulant) generating function may be used instead (e.g. a sub-parabolic CGF giving a sub-Gaussian Chernoff bound).
=== Lower bounds from the MGF ===
Using only the moment generating function, a lower bound on the tail probabilities can be obtained by applying the Paley-Zygmund inequality to formula_2, yielding: formula_28(a bound on the left tail is obtained for negative formula_3). Unlike the Chernoff bound however, this result is not exponentially tight.

Theodosopoulos constructed a tight(er) MGF-based lower bound using an exponential tilting procedure.

For particular distributions (such as the binomial) lower bounds of the same exponential order as the Chernoff bound are often available.

== Sums of independent random variables ==
When is the sum of independent random variables , the moment generating function of is the product of the individual moment generating functions, giving that:

 = \inf_{t &gt; 0} e^{-t\cdot a}\prod_i\operatorname E\left[ e^{t\cdot X_i}\right].&lt;/math&gt;|}}

and:

: formula_30

Specific Chernoff bounds are attained by calculating the moment-generating function formula_31 for specific instances of the random variables formula_32.

When the random variables are also &quot;identically distributed&quot; (iid), the Chernoff bound for the sum reduces to a simple rescaling of the single-variable Chernoff bound. That is, the Chernoff bound for the &quot;average&quot; of &quot;n&quot; iid variables is equivalent to the &quot;n&quot;th power of the Chernoff bound on a single variable (see Cramér&#x27;s theorem).

== Sums of independent bounded random variables ==
Chernoff bounds may also be applied to general sums of independent, bounded random variables, regardless of their distribution; this is known as Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality. The proof follows a similar approach to the other Chernoff bounds, but applying Hoeffding&#x27;s lemma to bound the moment generating functions (see Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality). 
:Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality. Suppose are independent random variables taking values in Let denote their sum and let denote the sum&#x27;s expected value. Then for any formula_33,
::formula_34
::formula_35

== Sums of independent Bernoulli random variables ==
The bounds in the following sections for Bernoulli random variables are derived by using that, for a Bernoulli random variable formula_32 with probability &quot;p&quot; of being equal to 1,

:formula_37

One can encounter many flavors of Chernoff bounds: the original &quot;additive form&quot; (which gives a bound on the absolute error) or the more practical &quot;multiplicative form&quot; (which bounds the error relative to the mean).

=== Multiplicative form (relative error) ===
Multiplicative Chernoff bound. Suppose are independent random variables taking values in Let denote their sum and let denote the sum&#x27;s expected value. Then for any ,
:formula_38
A similar proof strategy can be used to show that for 

:formula_39

The above formula is often unwieldy in practice, so the following looser but more convenient bounds are often used, which follow from the inequality formula_40 from the list of logarithmic inequalities:

:formula_41
:formula_42
:formula_43

Notice that the bounds are trivial for formula_44. 

In addition, based on the Taylor expansion for the Lambert W function,

:formula_45

=== Additive form (absolute error) ===
The following theorem is due to Wassily Hoeffding and hence is called the Chernoff–Hoeffding theorem.

:Chernoff–Hoeffding theorem. Suppose are i.i.d. random variables, taking values in Let and .

::formula_46
:where
::formula_47
:is the Kullback–Leibler divergence between Bernoulli distributed random variables with parameters &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; respectively. If then formula_48 which means

::formula_49

A simpler bound follows by relaxing the theorem using , which follows from the convexity of and the fact that

:formula_50

This result is a special case of Hoeffding&#x27;s inequality. Sometimes, the bounds

:formula_51

which are stronger for are also used.

==Applications==
Chernoff bounds have very useful applications in set balancing and packet routing in sparse networks.

The set balancing problem arises while designing statistical experiments. Typically while designing a statistical experiment, given the features of each participant in the experiment, we need to know how to divide the participants into 2 disjoint groups such that each feature is roughly as balanced as possible between the two groups.

Chernoff bounds are also used to obtain tight bounds for permutation routing problems which reduce network congestion while routing packets in sparse networks.

Chernoff bounds are used in computational learning theory to prove that a learning algorithm is probably approximately correct, i.e. with high probability the algorithm has small error on a sufficiently large training data set.

Chernoff bounds can be effectively used to evaluate the &quot;robustness level&quot; of an application/algorithm by exploring its perturbation space with randomization.
The use of the Chernoff bound permits one to abandon the strong—and mostly unrealistic—small perturbation hypothesis (the perturbation magnitude is small). The robustness level can be, in turn, used either to validate or reject a specific algorithmic choice, a hardware implementation or the appropriateness of a solution whose structural parameters are affected by uncertainties.

A simple and common use of Chernoff bounds is for &quot;boosting&quot; of randomized algorithms. If one has an algorithm that outputs a guess that is the desired answer with probability &quot;p&quot; &gt; 1/2, then one can get a higher success rate by running the algorithm formula_52 times and outputting a guess that is output by more than &quot;n&quot;/2 runs of the algorithm. (There cannot be more than one such guess.) Assuming that these algorithm runs are independent, the probability that more than &quot;n&quot;/2 of the guesses is correct is equal to the probability that the sum of independent Bernoulli random variables that are 1 with probability &quot;p&quot; is more than &quot;n&quot;/2. This can be shown to be at least formula_53 via the multiplicative Chernoff bound (Corollary 13.3 in Sinclair&#x27;s class notes, ).:

:formula_54

== Matrix Chernoff bound ==
Rudolf Ahlswede and Andreas Winter introduced a Chernoff bound for matrix-valued random variables. The following version of the inequality can be found in the work of Tropp.

Let be independent matrix valued random variables such that formula_55 and formula_56.
Let us denote by formula_57 the operator norm of the matrix formula_58. If formula_59 holds almost surely for all formula_60, then for every 

:formula_61

Notice that in order to conclude that the deviation from 0 is bounded by with high probability, we need to choose a number of samples formula_62 proportional to the logarithm of formula_63. In general, unfortunately, a dependence on formula_64 is inevitable: take for example a diagonal random sign matrix of dimension formula_65. The operator norm of the sum of &quot;t&quot; independent samples is precisely the maximum deviation among &quot;d&quot; independent random walks of length &quot;t&quot;. In order to achieve a fixed bound on the maximum deviation with constant probability, it is easy to see that &quot;t&quot; should grow logarithmically with &quot;d&quot; in this scenario.

The following theorem can be obtained by assuming &quot;M&quot; has low rank, in order to avoid the dependency on the dimensions.

===Theorem without the dependency on the dimensions===
Let and &quot;M&quot; be a random symmetric real matrix with formula_66 and formula_67 almost surely. Assume that each element on the support of &quot;M&quot; has at most rank &quot;r&quot;. Set 
:formula_68
If formula_69 holds almost surely, then

:formula_70

where are i.i.d. copies of &quot;M&quot;.

==Sampling variant==

The following variant of Chernoff&#x27;s bound can be used to bound the probability that a majority in a population will become a minority in a sample, or vice versa.

Suppose there is a general population &quot;A&quot; and a sub-population &quot;B&quot; ⊆ &quot;A&quot;. Mark the relative size of the sub-population (|&quot;B&quot;|/|&quot;A&quot;|) by &quot;r&quot;.

Suppose we pick an integer &quot;k&quot; and a random sample &quot;S&quot; ⊂ &quot;A&quot; of size &quot;k&quot;. Mark the relative size of the sub-population in the sample (|&quot;B&quot;∩&quot;S&quot;|/|&quot;S&quot;|) by &quot;rS&quot;.

Then, for every fraction &quot;d&quot; ∈ [0,1]:

:formula_71

In particular, if &quot;B&quot; is a majority in &quot;A&quot; (i.e. &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0.5) we can bound the probability that &quot;B&quot; will remain majority in &quot;S&quot;(&quot;rS&quot; &gt; 0.5) by taking: &quot;d&quot; = 1 − 1/(2&quot;r&quot;):

:formula_72

This bound is of course not tight at all. For example, when &quot;r&quot; = 0.5 we get a trivial bound Prob &gt; 0.

==Proofs==

===Multiplicative form===
Following the conditions of the multiplicative Chernoff bound, let be independent Bernoulli random variables, whose sum is , each having probability &quot;pi&quot; of being equal to 1. For a Bernoulli variable:

:formula_73

So, using () with formula_74 for any formula_75 and where formula_76,

:formula_77

If we simply set so that for , we can substitute and find

:formula_78

This proves the result desired.

===Chernoff–Hoeffding theorem (additive form)===
Let . Taking in (), we obtain:

:formula_79

Now, knowing that , we have

:formula_80

Therefore, we can easily compute the infimum, using calculus:

:formula_81

Setting the equation to zero and solving, we have

:formula_82

so that

:formula_83

Thus,

:formula_84

As , we see that , so our bound is satisfied on . Having solved for , we can plug back into the equations above to find that

:formula_85

We now have our desired result, that

:formula_86

To complete the proof for the symmetric case, we simply define the random variable , apply the same proof, and plug it into our bound.

<text>Jacques Jean Claude Santini (born 25 April 1952) is a French former professional footballer and manager. He played for Saint-Étienne during the 1970s, and reached the European Cup final with them in 1976. He has coached the France national team - winning the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup and reaching the quarter-finals of Euro 2004 - and clubs including Lyon.

==Managerial career==
Santini is one of the most accomplished football managers in France. Together with Jean Michel Aulas and Bernard Lacombe he was involved in the transformation of Lyon into a French football giant. From 1997 to 2000 he was Sports&#x27; director, helping lay the foundation which resulted in Lyon becoming the best football club in France. As manager of Lyon from 2000 to 2002 he was winner of French League Cup in 2001, and in 2002 he won the French Championship.

Santini was chosen as &quot;The best French coach&quot; in 2002 by France Football and World&#x27;s The Best National Coach of the Year in 2003 by International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics (IFFHS)
Santini replaced Roger Lemerre as France manager in 2002.
He had already resigned from the position before Euro 2004, where France surprisingly lost to eventual champions Greece in the quarter-final.

Santini took the managerial position at Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur after Euro 2004.
He surprisingly announced his resignation after just 13 games. Officially, Santini left England due to personal problems, but it was widely reported that a series of disagreements with then Sporting Director Frank Arnesen led to his departure.
Speaking in 2005, Santini said he quit partly because he felt agreements with the club were broken, but he admitted he &quot;dug his own grave&quot; by agreeing to join the club before the end of Euro 2004.

He took the job of head coach of AJ Auxerre in Ligue 1 in 2005, but was sacked in 2006 due to his conflict with vice-president of Auxerre Guy Roux.

On 23 June 2008, Santini was linked with the vacant managerial position at Scottish Premier League club Hearts but he refused the offer.

<text>Neuzelle (, ) is a municipality in the Oder-Spree district of Brandenburg, Germany, the administrative seat of &quot;Amt&quot; (collective municipality) Neuzelle. It is best known for Cistercian Neuzelle Abbey and its Neuzeller Kloster Brewery.

==Geography==
Neuzelle is situated in the north of the historic Lower Lusatia region near the border with Poland, about south of Eisenhüttenstadt. The municipal area along the Dorche creek, a tributary of the Oder River, since 2001 also comprises the villages of Bahro, Bomsdorf, Göhlen, Henzendorf, Kobbeln, Möbiskruge, Ossendorf, Schwerzko, Steinsdorf, Streichwitz, and Treppeln. In the west, it stretches up to the Schlaube Valley Nature Park.

==History==
The abbey was established as &quot;Nova Cella&quot; on 12 October 1268 by the Wettin margrave Henry III of Lusatia in remembrance of his deceased wife Agnes of Bohemia. Henry had acquired the strip of former Lubusz Land up to Fürstenberg (today&#x27;s Eisenhüttenstadt) from the Silesian duke Bolesław II Rogatka in turn for his mediation in the duke&#x27;s conflict with his Piast brother Henry III the White.

Neuzelle was a filial monastery of the Cistercian Altzella Abbey (&quot;Cella&quot;) near Nossen in Henry&#x27;s Margraviate of Meissen. A first convent of brothers took residence here in 1281. From about 1300, a monastery complex was laid out, including a Brick Gothic hall church, which soon became the spiritual centre of the region. The monks were granted large estates, up to Fürstenberg am Oder in the north and Szydłów (Schiedlo) beyond the Oder River in the east.

In 1367, Neuzelle with Lower Lusatia was purchased by the Luxembourg Emperor Charles IV in his capacity as King of Bohemia. The premises were devastated during the Hussite Wars in 1429 and the monks killed or abducted. Rebuilt afterwards, the monastery and its extended possessions with the Lands of the Bohemian Crown became part of the Habsburg monarchy in 1526. It remained Catholic during the Protestant Reformation, even after the Lutheran Electorate of Saxony had acquired the Lusatias from the Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand II by the 1635 Peace of Prague. Heavily demolished in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the church was again rebuilt in a Baroque style including rich interior decorations quite unique in Northern Germany.

By the Final Act of the 1815 Vienna Congress, Lower Lusatia fell to Prussia and was incorporated into the Province of Brandenburg, where it remained until 1947. The abbey was finally securalised by the order of King Frederick William III two years later. The buildings were later used as an orphanage and a teachers&#x27; seminary institution. Nevertheless, while the Neuzelle parish church turned Protestant, the abbey church remained Catholic and in 1947 was consecrated as Blessed Virgin Mary pilgrimage church. Today the monastery complex is held by a public foundation run by the State of Brandenburg.

After World War II, Neuzelle was incorporated into the State of Brandenburg from 1947 to 1952 and the Bezirk Frankfurt of East Germany from 1952 to 1990. Since 1990, Neuzelle is again part of Brandenburg.

<text>Nucleus CMS is an open-source blog management software package written in PHP, with a MySQL backend. It is used to manage frequently-updated Web content. With a little tweaking (mainly to skins), it might be considered a lightweight content management system.

Nucleus makes use of a callback function which has led to a plugin system in multiple languages. The general drive within the development community is that functionality should exist as plugins as totally as possible. This philosophy has led to a relatively light and uncluttered base install.

==History==
v1.0 was released in 2002. After that, managing multiple blogs from one system became possible.

On June 14, 2014 its developers announced that the project would officially sunset.

On January 27, 2016 it was announced that development would continue again.

<text>Father James Cullen, S.J. (19 April 1867 – 7 December 1933) was an Irish mathematician. 

He was born at 89 West Street, Drogheda, County Louth, to Michael Cullen, a baker, and Catherine McDonough. Initially, he was educated privately, then by the Christian Brothers. He studied pure and applied mathematics at Trinity College, Dublin, then at Mungret College, Limerick, before deciding to become a Jesuit. He studied in England in Mansera House, and St. Mary&#x27;s, and was ordained as a priest on 31 July 1901.

In 1905, he taught mathematics at Mount St. Mary&#x27;s College in Derbyshire and published his finding of what is now known as Cullen numbers in number theory.

He ended up looking after accounts for the English province of the Jesuits, while contributing to mathematics journals.

<doc id="741787" wikidata="Q882025" url="?curid=741787" title="Blast (British magazine)">
<text>Blast was the short-lived literary magazine of the Vorticist movement in Britain. Two editions were published: the first on 2 July 1914 (dated 20 June 1914, but publication was delayed) and featured a bright pink cover, referred to by Ezra Pound as the &quot;great MAGENTA cover&#x27;d &quot;; and the second a year later on 15 July 1915. Both editions were written primarily by Wyndham Lewis. The magazine is emblematic of the modern art movement in England, and recognised as a seminal text of pre-war 20th-century modernism. The magazine originally cost 2/6.

== Background ==
When the Italian futurist Filippo Tommaso Marinetti visited London in 1910, as part of a series of well-publicised lectures aimed at galvanizing support across Europe for the new Italian avant-garde, his presentation at the Lyceum Club, in which he addressed his audience as &quot;victims of ... traditionalism and its medieval trappings&quot;, electrified the assembled avant-garde. Within two years, an exhibition of futurist art at the Sackville Gallery, London, brought futurism squarely into the popular imagination, and the press began to use the term to refer to any forward-looking trends in modern art.

Initially galvanized by Marinetti&#x27;s verve, Wyndham Lewis—like many other members of the London avant-garde—had become increasingly irritated by the Italian&#x27;s arrogance. The publication of the English Futurist manifesto &quot;Vital English Art&quot;, in the June 1914 edition of &quot;The Observer&quot;, co-written by Marinetti and the &quot;last remaining English Futurist&quot; C. R. W. Nevinson, Lewis found his name, among others, had been added as a signatory at the end of the article without permission, in an attempt to assimilate the English avant-garde for Marinetti&#x27;s own ends. On 12 June, during recitations of this manifesto and a performance by Marinetti of his poem &quot;The Battle of Adrianople&quot;, with Nevinson accompanying on drums, Lewis, T. E. Hulme, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Edward Wadsworth, and five others roundly interrupted the performance with jeering and shouting. Wyndham Lewis wrote a few days later, &quot;England practically invented this civilisation that Signor Marinetti has come to preach to us about&quot;.

The final riposte came with the publication of &quot;Blast&quot; (later known as &quot;Blast 1&quot;), written and illustrated by a group of artists assembled by Lewis from &quot;a determined band of miscellaneous anti-futurists&quot;. The name &quot;Vorticism&quot; was coined by the poet Ezra Pound, a close friend of Lewis and the group&#x27;s main publicist. Writing to James Joyce in April 1914, Pound described the magazine in ambiguous terms: &quot;Lewis is starting a new Futurist, Cubist, Imagiste Quarterly ... I cant tell, it is mostly a painters&#x27; magazine with me to do the poems&quot;. By July, the magazine had a name, a movement to support, and a typographic style, and it had forged a distinctly English identity, confident enough to praise Kandinsky, question Picasso, and openly mock Marinetti.

==Editions==
&quot;Blast 1&quot; was edited and largely written by Wyndham Lewis with contributions from Pound, Gaudier-Brzeska, Epstein, Spencer Gore, Wadsworth, and Rebecca West and included an extract from Ford Madox Hueffer&#x27;s novel &quot;The Saddest Story&quot;, better known by its later title &quot;The Good Soldier&quot; (published under his subsequent pseudonym, Ford Madox Ford). The first edition was printed in folio format, with the oblique title &quot;Blast&quot; splashed across its bright pink soft cover. Inside, Lewis used a range of bold typographic innovations to engage the reader, that are reminiscent of Marinetti&#x27;s contemporary concrete poetry such as Zang Tumb Tumb. Rather than conventional serif fonts, some of the text is set in sans-serif &quot;grotesque&quot; fonts.

The opening twenty pages of &quot;Blast 1&quot; contain the Vorticist manifesto, written by Lewis and signed by him, Wadsworth, Pound, William Roberts, Helen Saunders, Lawrence Atkinson, Jessica Dismorr, and Gaudier-Brzeska. Epstein chose not to sign the manifesto, although his work was featured. There is also a (positive) critique of Kandinsky&#x27;s &quot;Concerning the Spiritual in Art&quot;, a faintly patronising exhortation to suffragettes not to destroy works of art, a review of a London exhibition of Expressionist woodcuts, and a last dig at Marinetti by Wyndham Lewis:
===The Manifesto===
The manifesto is primarily a long list of things to be &#x27;Blessed&#x27; or &#x27;Blasted&#x27;. It starts:

# Beyond Action and Reaction we would establish ourselves.
# We start from opposite statements of a chosen world. Set up violent structure of adolescent clearness between two extremes.
# We discharge ourselves on both sides.
# We fight first on one side, then on the other, but always for the SAME cause, which is neither side or both sides and ours.
# Mercenaries were always the best troops.
# We are primitive Mercenaries in the Modern World.
# Our Cause is NO-MAN&#x27;S.
# We set Humour at Humour&#x27;s throat. Stir up Civil War among peaceful apes.
# We only want Humour if it has fought like Tragedy.
# We only want Tragedy if it can clench its side-muscles like hands on its belly, and bring to the surface a laugh like a bomb.

The subjects either &#x27;Blasted&#x27; or &#x27;Blessed&#x27; depended on how they were seen by the fledgling Vorticists. Among them were the leaders of the rival avant-garde grouped about Roger Fry and the Bloomsbury set, as well as the literary leaders of the past. Thus the &quot;Purgatory of Putney&quot; is named for being the place to which Algernon Swinburne had retired into respectability. Among the Blessed are seafarers because &quot;they exchange...one element for another&quot; (p. 22) and the hairdresser who &quot;attacks Mother Nature for a small fee...[and] trims aimless and retrograde growths&quot; (p. 25). Henry Tonks, the Slade Professor of Fine Art, had the unique honour of being both &#x27;Blessed&#x27; and &#x27;Blasted&#x27;.

The first edition also contained many illustrations in the Vorticist style by Jacob Epstein, Edward Wadsworth, Lewis and others.

The English press was unimpressed by &quot;Blast&quot;, finding the literary contributions dull, and the artwork and typography a pale imitation of the Futurist style. Writing to Harold Monroe, Marinetti said he took the negative reviews as a “victory” for Futurism, but regretted there hadn’t been instead a collaboration with the Vorticists in the fight against “our great common enemy: attachment to the past.&quot;

The second edition, published on 20 July 1915, contained a short play by Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poems &quot;Preludes&quot; and &quot;Rhapsody on a Windy Night&quot;. Another article by Gaudier-Brzeska entitled &quot;Vortex (written from the Trenches)&quot; further described the vorticist aesthetic. It was written whilst Gaudier-Brzeska was fighting in the First World War, a few weeks before he was killed there.

==World War I and the end of Vorticism==
Thirty-three days after &quot;Blast 1&quot; was published, war was declared on Germany. The First World War would destroy vorticism; both Gaudier-Brzeska and T. E. Hulme were killed at the front, and Bomberg lost his faith in modernism. Lewis was mobilised in 1916, initially fighting in France as an artillery officer, later working as a war artist for the Canadian Government. He tried to re-invigorate the avant-garde after the war, writing to a friend that he intended to publish a third edition of &quot;Blast&quot; in November 1919. He organised an exhibition of avant-garde artists called &quot;Group X&quot; at Heal&#x27;s Gallery in March–April 1920, and later published a new magazine, &quot;The Tyro&quot;, of which only two issues appeared. The further issue of &quot;Blast&quot; failed to appear, and neither of the other two ventures managed to achieve the momentum of his pre-war efforts. Richard Cork writes:
==Public collections==
Both editions have been reprinted a number of times and are shortly to be made available again by Thames and Hudson; original copies are in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Tate, Yale University, Wake Forest University, University of Delaware, Chelsea College, University of Exeter Special Collections and others. The Fundación Juan March launched an exhibition in Madrid (from 10 Feb 2010 through 16 May 2010), &quot;Wyndham Lewis (1882–1957)&quot;, publishing a semi-facsimile edition (translated into Spanish) of &quot;Blast&quot; No.1 and an edition of &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;. The Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University held an exhibition entitled &quot;The Vorticists: Rebel Artists in London and New York, 1914–18&quot; from 30 September 2010, through 2 January 2011.

<text>Ossie Davis, born Raiford Chatman Davis (December 18, 1917 – February 4, 2005) was an American actor, director, writer, and activist. He was married to Ruby Dee, with whom he frequently performed, until his death. He received numerous accolades including an Emmy, a Grammy and a Writers Guild of America Award as well as nominations for four additional Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and Tony Award. Davis was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1994 and received the National Medal of Arts in 1995, Kennedy Center Honors in 2004.

Davis started his career in theatre acting with the Ross McClendon Players in the 1940s. He made his Broadway debut acting in the post-World War II play &quot;Jeb&quot; (1946). He earned a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical nomination for his role in &quot;Jamaica&quot; (1958). He wrote and starred as the title character in the satirical farce &quot;Purlie Victorious&quot; (1961) which was adapted into a 1963 film and 1970 musical.

Davis&#x27;s credits as a film director include &quot;Cotton Comes to Harlem&quot; (1970), &quot;Black Girl&quot; (1972), and &quot;Gordon&#x27;s War&quot; (1973). He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;The Scalphunters&quot; (1968). Davis also acted in &quot;The Hill&quot; (1965), &quot;A Man Called Adam&quot; (1966), &quot;Lets Do It Again&quot; (1975), &quot;School Daze&quot; (1988), &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; (1989), &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; (1993), &quot;The Client&quot; (1994), and &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot; (1998).

For his portrayal of Martin Luther King Sr. in the NBC miniseries &quot;King&quot; (1978) he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. He was also Emmy-nominated for his roles in &quot;Teacher, Teacher&quot; (1969), &quot;Miss Evers&#x27; Boys&quot; (1997), and &quot;The L Word&quot; (2005). He won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album with his wife Ruby Dee for &quot;Ossie and Ruby&quot; (2005).

==Early life==
Raiford Chatman Davis was born in Cogdell, Georgia, the son of Kince Charles Davis, a railway construction engineer, and his wife Laura (&quot;née&quot; Cooper; July 9, 1898 – June 6, 2004). He inadvertently became known as &quot;Ossie&quot; when his birth certificate was being filed and his mother&#x27;s pronunciation of his name as &quot;R. C. Davis&quot; was misheard by the Clinch County courthouse clerk. Davis experienced racism from an early age when the KKK threatened to shoot his father, whose job they felt was too advanced for a black man to have. His siblings included scientist William Conan Davis, social worker Essie Davis Morgan, pharmacist Kenneth Curtis Davis, and biology teacher James Davis.

Following the wishes of his parents, he attended Howard University but dropped out in 1939 to fulfill his desire for an acting career in New York after a recommendation by Alain Locke; he later attended Columbia University School of General Studies. His acting career began in 1939 with the Rose McClendon Players in Harlem. During World War II, Davis served in the United States Army in the Medical Corps. He made his film debut in 1950 in the Sidney Poitier film &quot;No Way Out&quot;.

==Career==
=== 1939–1959: Acting debut and Broadway work ===

When Davis wanted to pursue a career in acting, he ran into the usual roadblocks that black people suffered at that time as they generally could only portray stereotypical characters such as Stepin Fetchit. Instead, he tried to follow the example of Sidney Poitier and play more distinguished characters. When he found it necessary to play a Pullman porter or a butler, he played those characters realistically, not as a caricature.

In 1961, he wrote and starred in the Broadway play &quot;Purlie Victorious&quot;, a farce satirizing the confederate south. Davis portrayed the title character Purlie Victorious Judson, acting opposite Ruby Dee and Alan Alda. The film was adapted into a film titled &quot;Gone Are the Days!&quot;, released in 1963. The Broadway cast reprised their roles for the film. Howard Taubman for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of the play: &quot;It is marvelously exhilarating to hear the Negro speak for himself, especially when he does so in the fullness of his native gusto and the enveloping heartiness of his overflowing laughter.&quot;

=== 1970–1989: Directorial work ===
In addition to acting, Davis, along with Melvin Van Peebles and Gordon Parks, was one of the notable black directors of his generation: he directed movies such as &quot;Cotton Comes to Harlem&quot; (1970), &quot;Black Girl&quot; (1972) and &quot;Gordon&#x27;s War&quot; (1973). Along with Bill Cosby and Poitier, Davis was one of a handful of black actors able to find commercial success while avoiding stereotypical roles prior to 1970, which also included a significant role in the Otto Preminger directed drama &quot;The Cardinal&quot; (1963) and the Sidney Lumet prison drama &quot;The Hill&quot; (1965). He acted in the musical drama &quot;A Man Called Adam&quot; (1966), performing alongside Sammy Davis Jr., Louis Armstrong, and Cicely Tyson. He played Joseph Lee in the Sydney Pollack-directed western drama &quot;The Scalphunters&quot;, acting alongside Burt Lancaster and Shelley Winters. For his performance, Davis received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. Critic Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised Davis&#x27;s performance in the film writing: &quot;Davis, as an educated slave, is gradually initiated into the brutal realities of frontier life. [He] emerges as a genuine comic talent in a very demanding role (actually the lead, although Lancaster gets top billing). His character changes from an Uncle Tom to a rough-and-ready cowboy before your very eyes.&quot;

During this time, he acted in the western comedy &quot;Sam Whiskey&quot; with Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson, the drama &quot;Slaves&quot;, starring Dionne Warwick, and the action comedy &quot;Hot Stuck&quot; with Dom DeLuise and Suzanne Pleshette. Davis starred with Cosby and Poitier in the 1975 film &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot;. Davis, however, never had the tremendous commercial or critical success that either of them enjoyed. As a playwright, Davis wrote &quot;Paul Robeson: All-American&quot;, which is frequently performed in theatre programs for young audiences.

In 1976, Davis appeared on Muhammad Ali&#x27;s novelty album for children, &quot;The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay&quot;. Davis found recognition late in his life by working in several of director Spike Lee&#x27;s films, including &quot;School Daze&quot; (1988), &quot;Do The Right Thing&quot; (1989), &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; (1991), &quot;Malcolm X&quot; (1991), &quot;Get on the Bus&quot; (1996), and &quot;She Hate Me&quot; (2004) For the final moments of &quot;Malcolm X&quot;, Davis, in voiceover, recited the actual eulogy that he wrote and delivered at Malcolm&#x27;s funeral 27 years earlier. He also found work as a commercial voice-over artist and served as the narrator of the early-1990s CBS sitcom &quot;Evening Shade&quot;, starring Burt Reynolds, where he also played one of the residents of a small southern town. Davis and Reynolds had also worked together on Reynolds&#x27; previous TV series, &quot;B.L. Stryker&quot; (1989-1990), aired as part of the &quot;ABC Mystery Movie&quot; series.

=== 1990–2005: Later work and final roles ===
Davis also appeared in several popular 1990s films, including the studio comedies &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; (1993) starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, and &quot;Cop and a Half&quot; (1993) with Burt Reynolds, as well as the John Grisham drama film &quot;The Client&quot; (1994) starring Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones. He reunited with Spike Lee acting in the film &quot;Get on the Bus&quot; (1996) and appeared his HBO documentary &quot;4 Little Girls&quot; (1997) which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. In 1998 he acted in the Eddie Murphy led comedy film &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot;. In 1999, he appeared as a theater caretaker in the Trans-Siberian Orchestra film &quot;The Ghosts of Christmas Eve&quot;, which was released on DVD two years later. For many years, he hosted the annual National Memorial Day Concert from Washington, D.C.

In 1994, Davis played Judge Richard Farris in the Stephen King miniseries &quot;The Stand&quot;. From 1995 to 1996, he played Judge Harry Roosevelt in the CBS legal drama &quot;The Client&quot; (reprising his role from the &quot;1994 film&quot;). Davis played Erasmus Jones in &quot;Promised Land&quot; from 1996 to 1998. The series was a spinoff from &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; where he played multiple characters from 1996 to 2000. He played Mr. Evers in the HBO film &quot;Miss Evers&#x27; Boys&quot; (1997) starring Laurence Fishburne and Alfre Woodard. The film won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie. That same year he acted in the Showtime television film &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1997) playing Juror #2. He acted in an ensemble cast acting alongside Courtney B. Vance, George C. Scott, James Gandolfini, Jack Nicholson, and Hume Cronyn. 
He voiced Anansi the spider on the PBS children&#x27;s television series &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in its animation segments. He also narrated the HBO Storybook Musicals adaptation of The Red Shoes aired on February 7, 1990. In 2000, he voiced the role of Yar in Disney&#x27;s live-action animated film &quot;Dinosaur&quot;.

From 1999 to 2000, he played Mr. Parker in the NBC crime drama &quot;Third Watch&quot;. He also took roles in &quot;Deacons for Defense&quot; and &quot;JAG&quot;, both in 2003. Davis&#x27;s last role was a several episode guest role on the Showtime drama series &quot;The L Word&quot;, as a father struggling with the acceptance of his daughter Bette (Jennifer Beals) parenting a child with her lesbian partner. In his final episodes, his character took ill and died. His wife Ruby Dee was present during the filming of his own death scene. That episode, which aired shortly after Davis&#x27;s own death, aired with a dedication to the actor. After Davis&#x27;s death, actor Dennis Haysbert portrayed him in the 2015 film &quot;Experimenter&quot;.

==Personal life==
=== Marriage ===
In 1948, Davis married actress Ruby Dee, whom he had met on the set of Robert Ardrey&#x27;s 1946 play &quot;Jeb&quot;. In their joint autobiography &quot;With Ossie and Ruby,&quot; they described their decision to have an open marriage, later changing their minds. In the mid-1960s they moved to the New York suburb of New Rochelle, where they remained ever after. Their son Guy Davis is a blues musician and former actor, who appeared in the film &quot;Beat Street&quot; (1984) and the daytime soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Their daughters are Nora Davis Day and Hasna Muhammad.

=== Political activism ===

Davis and Dee were well known as civil rights activists during the Civil Rights Movement and were close friends of Malcolm X, Jesse Jackson, Martin Luther King Jr. and other icons of the era. They were involved in organizing the 1963 civil rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and served as its emcees. Davis, alongside Ahmed Osman, delivered the eulogy at the funeral of Malcolm X. He re-read part of this eulogy at the end of Spike Lee&#x27;s film &quot;Malcolm X&quot;. He also delivered a stirring tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, at a memorial in New York&#x27;s Central Park the day after King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee.

===Death===
Davis was found dead in a Miami Beach hotel room on February 4, 2005. He was 87 years old. An official cause of death was not released, but he was known to have had heart problems. His ashes were interred at Ferncliff Cemetery.

Davis&#x27;s funeral was held in New York City on February 12, 2005. The line to enter The Riverside Church, located on the edge of Harlem, stretched for several blocks, with a thousand or more members of the public unable to attend as the church filled to its 2,100 capacity. Speakers included Davis&#x27;s children and grandchildren, as well as Alan Alda, Burt Reynolds, Amiri Baraka, Avery Brooks, Angela Bassett, Spike Lee, Attallah Shabazz, Tavis Smiley, Maya Angelou, Sonia Sanchez, Harry Belafonte, and former president Bill Clinton, among many others. Wynton Marsalis performed a musical tribute. Burt Reynolds, who early in his career had worked with Davis, said &quot;Ossie Davis took the bad parts of the South out of me... I know what a man is because of Ossie Davis.&quot; Ms. Shabazz, oldest daughter of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz, spoke lovingly of the man she and her five sisters called Uncle Ossie, saying he had provided exceptional support to her and her sisters after her father&#x27;s assassination. Bill Clinton arrived midway through the service, and said from the pulpit &quot;I asked to be seated in the back. I would proudly ride on the back of Ossie Davis&#x27;s bus any day,&quot; adding that Davis &quot;would have made a great president.&quot;

Delivering the eulogy, Harry Belafonte said: Ossie Davis &quot;embraced the greatest forces of our times. Paul Robeson, Dr. W.E.B. DuBois, Eleanor Roosevelt, A. Philip Randolph, Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker, Thurgood Marshall, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and so many, many more. At the time of one of our most anxious and conflicted moments, when &#x27;Our America&#x27; was torn apart by seething issues of race, Ossie paused, at the tomb of one of our noblest warriors, and in the eulogy he delivered, insured that history would clearly understand the voice of Black people, and what Malcolm X meant to us in the African-American struggle for freedom... It is hard to fathom that we will no longer be able to call on his wisdom, his humor, his loyalty and his moral strength to guide us in the choices that are yet to be made and the battles that are yet to be fought. But how fortunate we were to have him as long as we did.&quot;

== Awards and honors ==
In 1989, Ossie Davis and his wife, actress/activist Ruby Dee, were named to the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame.

In 1994, Davis was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame. In 2004, they were recipients of the prestigious Kennedy Center Honors. According to the Kennedy Center Honors: 
:&quot;The Honors recipients recognized for their lifetime contributions to American culture through the performing arts— whether in dance, music, theater, opera, motion pictures, or television — are selected by the Center&#x27;s Board of Trustees. The primary criterion in the selection process is excellence. The Honors are not designated by art form or category of artistic achievement; the selection process, over the years, has produced balance among the various arts and artistic disciplines.&quot;

<text>Amoy Food Limited is a manufacturer of cooking sauces and condiments in Hong Kong. Its products, which now include foodstuffs such as frozen foods and instant foods for heating in a microwave oven, are sold around the world. It was acquired in 2018 by CITIC Capital, a subsidiary of the CITIC Group.

Its former factory site in Ngau Tau Kok was sold in the 1970s and has since been turned into an apartment complex called the Amoy Gardens.

==Etymology==
Amoy () is an English romanisation of the Min Nan pronunciation of the name of the city in Fujian province, China known in Mandarin as Xiamen.

==History==
In 1908, Tao Fa, the predecessor of the company, was founded in Xiamen for producing soy sauce and soy milk. In 1928, Amoy was set up in Hong Kong.

In a 1947 advertisement, the company was named as Amoy Canning Corporation, Ltd. () with factory in Ngau Tau Kok and head office at Bonham Strand in Sheung Wan.

In 1977, Sime Darby group acquired 50% of Amoy Canning.

In 1980, Hang Lung Development acquired 63% of Amoy Canning Corp. (HK) Ltd

In 1983, fifty percent of Amoy Food was acquired by Pillsbury.

In 1987, a manufacturing plant was set up in Tai Po Industrial Estate in Tai Po.

In 1988, it was reported to be the largest soy sauce maker in the area, producing 6,000 tonnes a year.

In 1991, Amoy became wholly owned by the French dairy products company Danone.

On 12 January 2006, Danone sold the company to Ajinomoto of Japan.

In 2013, Amoy frozen food&#x27;s factory in China was moved to Tai Po Industrial Estate in Hong Kong.

In 2018, Ajinomoto sold the company to CITIC Group of China.

In Europe, Amoy products are distributed by Kraft Heinz.

<doc id="741796" wikidata="Q7588553" url="?curid=741796" title="St. Joan of Arc Chapel">
<text>St. Joan of Arc Chapel is a Roman Catholic chapel today located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States, on the campus of Marquette University, in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee. It was dedicated to Joan of Arc on 26 May 1966, after it had been moved from its previous location on Long Island, New York. It was originally built in the Rhône River Valley in France.

==History==

===In France===
Originally named , the chapel was built over several generations in the French village of Chasse-sur-Rhône, south of Lyon. It is estimated that it was erected around the 15th century. The building was abandoned after the French Revolution and fell into ruin. According to a sign on display at the original site in France, Joan of Arc may have visited and prayed at the chapel on 9 March 1429 after meeting King Charles VII of France. Legend relates that Joan prayed to a statue of the Virgin Mary while standing on a flat stone that is now behind the altar. Joan is said to have kissed the stone; ever since, the temperature of that stone has been reported to be colder than those surrounding it.

After World War I, the young architect Jacques Couëlle rediscovered the chapel and negotiated its transfer to the Brookville, New York, home of Gertrude Hill Gavin, the daughter of James J. Hill, best known as the founder of the Great Northern Railway. Couëlle went so far as to refer to the chapel as &quot;&quot; (the most absolutely unique monument of its kind).

===In New York===
The chapel was shipped to Brookville in 1927 and reconstructed there for its new owner by John Russell Pope. There it was attached to a mock French Renaissance chateau. Although the chateau burned down in 1962, the chapel was not damaged. After Gavin died, her estate passed to Marc B. Rojtman and his wife, Lillian. who decided to present the chapel to Marquette University in 1964.

===At Marquette University===
The transfer of the chapel took more than nine months, and another eight months passed before reconstruction began. Lucien David and Earnest Bonnamy planned the second reconstruction.

==Features==
*The tomb of Chevalier de Sautereau, a former Chatelain of Chasse and of Bayard, is still located in the floor of the sanctuary.
*The chapel features Christian artifacts that predate the original chapel, in some instances by multiple centuries, and which have been collected and displayed in the chapel, including ancient Spanish tapestries, coats of arms, crucifixes, and even a contemporary rooftop. It is one of the few exhibits of items from antiquity that visitors are permitted to handle or touch.
*The stained glass windows are not original: Gertrude Hill Gavin, the owner of the chapel in New York, commissioned the windows. Charles J. Connick created and installed them in 1929. Connick modeled the color scheme of the windows on those of the stained glass windows in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City.

<doc id="741799" wikidata="Q880118" url="?curid=741799" title="Neuzeller Kloster Brewery">
<text>The Neuzelle Cloister Brewery (&quot;Neuzeller Klosterbräu&quot;) is located in Neuzelle, Germany, and is best known for its Neuzeller &quot;Anti-Aging-Bier&quot;.

Helmut Fritsche purchased the Neuzeller brewery in 1992, which has been producing beer commercially for over 400 years, and is situated on the grounds of a 12th-century Catholic monastery, Neuzelle Abbey.

The &quot;Anti-Aging-Bier&quot;, which, in addition to the four cardinal ingredients of beer, adds spirulina and flavonoids in order to, supposedly, increase health and longevity, was first marketed in February 2004, and claims to have double the anti-oxidant effect of other beers. However, the German Beer Brewers&#x27; Association is not entirely willing to label these drinks beers, as their contents differ from those original Reinheitsgebot ingredients.

In 2004, the brewery was ordered to cease production of their product &quot;Schwarzer Abt&quot; or face a $25,000 fine, because the drink contained added sugar syrup it was in conflict with the beer purity law. The brewery had been brewing the dark beer with sugar syrup in East Germany, which had been allowed under East Germany&#x27;s permissive brewing laws. The brewery had not explicitly labelled it as beer, but as &quot;A Specialty Made From Schwarzbier, With Invert Sugar Syrup Added Afterward&quot;. In 2003, the brewery changed the labelling to simply read &quot;Schwarzbier&quot;. In 2005, a German court upheld the brewery&#x27;s challenge to purity laws and allowed the brewery to add sugar syrup to &quot;Schwarzer Abt&quot; and label it as beer, ending the 10 year legal battle.

The brewery also produces a locally successful Schwarzbier, Pilsner, Bock, cherry beer, energy beer, a beer specifically developed for bathing, and a berry-flavored soda used in making a Potsdamer. In 2023, the brewery announced release of a powdered beer.

<text>The linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) – also called linear variable displacement transformer, linear variable displacement transducer, or simply differential transformer – is a type of electrical transformer used for measuring linear displacement (position along a given direction). It is the base of LVDT-type displacement sensors. A counterpart to this device that is used for measuring rotary displacement is called a &quot;rotary variable differential transformer&quot; (RVDT).

== Introduction ==

LVDTs are robust, absolute linear position/displacement transducers; inherently frictionless, they have a virtually infinite cycle life when properly used. As AC operated LVDTs do not contain any electronics, they can be designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures or up to 1200 °F (650 °C), in harsh environments, and under high vibration and shock levels. LVDTs have been widely used in applications such as power turbines, hydraulics, automation, aircraft, satellites, nuclear reactors, and many others. These transducers have low hysteresis and excellent repeatability.

The LVDT converts a position or linear displacement from a mechanical reference (zero or null position) into a proportional electrical signal containing phase (for direction) and amplitude (for distance) information. The LVDT operation does not require an electrical contact between the moving part (probe or core assembly) and the coil assembly, but instead relies on electromagnetic coupling.

== Operation ==
The linear variable differential transformer has three solenoidal coils placed end-to-end around a tube. The center coil is the primary, and the two outer coils are the top and bottom secondaries. A cylindrical ferromagnetic core, attached to the object whose position is to be measured, slides along the axis of the tube. An alternating current drives the primary and causes a voltage to be induced in each secondary proportional to the length of the core linking to the secondary. The frequency is usually in the range 1 to 10 kHz.

As the core moves, the primary&#x27;s linkage to the two secondary coils changes and causes the induced voltages to change. The coils are connected so that the output voltage is the difference (hence &quot;differential&quot;) between the top secondary voltage and the bottom secondary voltage. When the core is in its central position, equidistant between the two secondaries, equal voltages are induced in the two secondary coils, but the two signals cancel, so the output voltage is theoretically zero. In practice minor variations in the way in which the primary is coupled to each secondary means that a small voltage is output when the core is central.

This small residual voltage is due to phase shift and is often called quadrature error. It is a nuisance in closed loop control systems as it can result in oscillation about the null point, and may also be unacceptable in simple measurement applications. It is a consequence of using synchronous demodulation, with direct subtraction of the secondary voltages at AC. Modern systems, particularly those involving safety, require fault detection of the LVDT, and the normal method is to demodulate each secondary separately, using precision half wave or full wave rectifiers, based on op-amps, and compute the difference by subtracting the DC signals. Because, for constant excitation voltage, the sum of the two secondary voltages is almost constant throughout the operating stroke of the LVDT, its value remains within a small window and can be monitored such that any internal failures of the LVDT will cause the sum voltage to deviate from its limits and be rapidly detected, causing a fault to be indicated. There is no quadrature error with this scheme, and the position-dependent difference voltage passes smoothly through zero at the null point.

Where digital processing in the form of a microprocessor or FPGA is available in the system, it is customary for the processing device to carry out the fault detection, and possibly ratiometric processing to improve accuracy, by dividing the difference in secondary voltages by the sum of the secondary voltages, to make the measurement independent of the exact amplitude of the excitation signal. If sufficient digital processing capacity is available, it is becoming commonplace to use this to generate the sinusoidal excitation via a DAC and possibly also perform the secondary demodulation via a multiplexed ADC.

When the core is displaced toward the top, the voltage in top secondary coil increases as the voltage in the bottom decreases. The resulting output voltage increases from zero. This voltage is in phase with the primary voltage. When the core moves in the other direction, the output voltage also increases from zero, but its phase is opposite to that of the primary. The phase of the output voltage determines the direction of the displacement (up or down) and amplitude indicates the amount of displacement. A synchronous detector can determine a signed output voltage that relates to the displacement.

The LVDT is designed with long slender coils to make the output voltage essentially linear over displacement up to several inches (several hundred millimetres) long.

The LVDT can be used as an absolute position sensor. Even if the power is switched off, on restarting it, the LVDT shows the same measurement, and no positional information is lost. Its biggest advantages are repeatability and reproducibility once it is properly configured. Also, apart from the uni-axial linear motion of the core, any other movements such as the rotation of the core around the axis will not affect its measurements.

Because the sliding core does not touch the inside of the tube, it can move without friction, making the LVDT a highly reliable device. The absence of any sliding or rotating contacts allows the LVDT to be completely sealed against the environment.

LVDTs are commonly used for position feedback in servomechanisms, and for automated measurement in machine tools and many other industrial and scientific applications.

<doc id="741818" wikidata="Q903805" url="?curid=741818" title="HEMA (store)">
<text>HEMA (; originally an acronym for &quot;Hollandsche Eenheidsprijzen Maatschappij Amsterdam&quot;, &quot;Standard Price Company of Holland, Amsterdam&quot;), is a Dutch variety chain store. The chain is characterized by relatively low pricing of generic household goods, which are mostly made by and for the chain itself, often with an original design. The owner is Dutch billionaire Marcel Boekhoorn, who has lost control to bondholders.

==History==
The first HEMA opened in Amsterdam on 4 November 1926, set up by the owners of the luxury department store De Bijenkorf. Originally, as a price-point retailer at prime locations in town centres, goods were sold using standard prices (hence its name), with everything having a standard price of 10, 25 or 50 cents, and later also 75 and 100 cents. The relative economic boom in the Netherlands in the period 1900–1930 benefited HEMA.

During World War II, a number of Jewish employees (there was a relatively high number because of the Jewish roots of the company) were murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust. This is commemorated every year by laying a wreath on 4 May, the Dutch Remembrance of the Dead, at the head office.

After World War II, the standard pricing model could not be sustained and was abandoned. A period of rapid expansion followed. Locations carry a wide variety of goods, including clothing, food, bicycle equipment, gardening tools, and office supplies.

===Ownership changes===
===21st century===
In 2010, under Lion Capital ownership, standard pricing was reintroduced. 

In 2015, Hema was the most indispensable brand in the Netherlands for the 8th time running.

In 2020, Hema&#x27;s proprietors placed the potential sale of the business on their agenda. Flacks Group, an investment company based in Miami, Florida, and a consortium led by Amsterdam-based private equity firm Parcom Capital displayed the greatest interest in acquiring the chain. Exclusive negotiations with a 50/50 consortium of the Van Eerd Group and Parcom Capital commenced in October 2020. This was expected to put a stop to activities outside Europe.

The company announced in July 2021 that it would withdraw completely from the UK market by closing its six stores there. Under the leadership of its new ceo, Egas Reparaz, the company would focus more on its core markets of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and France. With this renewed focus on core markets, the company also decided to withdraw from Spain and close its stores there during 2022. Two other countries in which it was active in 2021, Germany and Austria, were seen as potential growth markets and would be explored further. Some collaborations in other countries were respected, but not further developed. On November 24, 2021, it was announced that HEMA would sell its bakeries to Bacu, which already baked for Jumbo and would do the same for HEMA.

==Branches==
HEMA has also expanded into other countries since the 1990s.

HEMA branches by country:
On 4 January 2014, Hema&#x27;s CEO Ronald van Zetten announced that it would branch out to Spain and the United Kingdom opening the first stores within six months as well further expanding in France. The first Spanish store opened on 3 April on Calle Fuencarral in Madrid. The first British store opened in the Victoria Place shopping centre, above Victoria station, in London on 12 June 2014, and six more followed. By the summer of 2021, all had been closed. All stores in Spain closed in 2022.

<text>* Hemā is a figure in both Hawaiian and Māori mythology.
* An epithets of Goddess Lakshmi in Hinduism
==Māori==
In Māori mythology, Hema is a son of Whaitiri and Kaitangata and the father of Tāwhaki and Karihi. In North Island stories, he was killed by the Ponaturi, evil creatures who live by day in the water. Tāwhaki, Karihi and their mother trick the Ponaturi into entering a house, and then locked them in, claiming there was still time before the dawn. They then opened the door after sunrise, and the Ponaturi were killed by the exposure to sunlight (Tregear 1891:61, 496). The only survivor (in one account) was Tonga-Hiti and in another account kanae, the grey mullet.

==Hawaii==
In Hawaiian mythology, Hemā and his brother Puna are sons of the man named Aikanaka by his consort, Hinahanaiakamalama — often simply called Hina. His son was Kaha&#x27;i. Hina is disgusted by her children&#x27;s dirtiness, and she goes to the moon. In some accounts, Hemā sails to a far-off country, where he is killed by the people which habitually kill all strangers. Kaha&#x27;i goes on a journey to find him. Other accounts have Hemā as a son of Mahina.

<doc id="741823" wikidata="Q1134091" url="?curid=741823" title="Optical filter">
<text>An optical filter is a device that selectively transmits light of different wavelengths, usually implemented as a glass plane or plastic device in the optical path, which are either dyed in the bulk or have interference coatings. The optical properties of filters are completely described by their frequency response, which specifies how the magnitude and phase of each frequency component of an incoming signal is modified by the filter.

Filters mostly belong to one of two categories. The simplest, physically, is the absorptive filter; then there are interference or dichroic filters. Many optical filters are used for optical imaging and are manufactured to be transparent; some used for light sources can be translucent.

Optical filters selectively transmit light in a particular range of wavelengths, that is, colours, while absorbing the remainder. They can usually pass long wavelengths only (longpass), short wavelengths only (shortpass), or a band of wavelengths, blocking both longer and shorter wavelengths (bandpass). The passband may be narrower or wider; the transition or cutoff between maximal and minimal transmission can be sharp or gradual. There are filters with more complex transmission characteristic, for example with two peaks rather than a single band; these are more usually older designs traditionally used for photography; filters with more regular characteristics are used for scientific and technical work.

Optical filters are commonly used in photography (where some special effect filters are occasionally used as well as absorptive filters), in many optical instruments, and to colour stage lighting. In astronomy optical filters are used to restrict light passed to the spectral band of interest, e.g., to study infrared radiation without visible light which would affect film or sensors and overwhelm the desired infrared. Optical filters are also essential in fluorescence applications such as fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy.

Photographic filters are a particular case of optical filters, and much of the material here applies. Photographic filters do not need the accurately controlled optical properties and precisely defined transmission curves of filters designed for scientific work, and sell in larger quantities at correspondingly lower prices than many laboratory filters. Some photographic effect filters, such as star effect filters, are not relevant to scientific work.

==Measurement==

In general, a given optical filter transmits a certain percentage of the incoming light as the wavelength changes. This is measured by a spectrophotometer. As a linear material, the absorption for each wavelength is independent of the presence of other wavelengths. A very few materials are non-linear, and the transmittance depends on the intensity and the combination of wavelengths of the incident light. Transparent fluorescent materials can work as an optical filter, with an absorption spectrum, and also as a light source, with an emission spectrum.

Also in general, light which is not transmitted is absorbed; for intense light, that can cause significant heating of the filter. However, the optical term absorbance refers to the attenuation of the incident light, regardless of the mechanism by which it is attenuated. Some filters, like mirrors, interference filters, or metal meshes, reflect or scatter much of the non-transmitted light.

The (dimensionless) Optical Density of a filter at a particular wavelength of light is defined as formula_1 where is the (dimensionless) transmittance of the filter at that wavelength.

==Absorptive==
Optical filtering was first done with liquid-filled, glass-walled cells; they are still used for special purposes. The widest range of color-selection is now available as colored-film filters, originally made from animal gelatin but now usually a thermoplastic such as acetate, acrylic, polycarbonate, or polyester depending upon the application. They were standardized for photographic use by Wratten in the early 20th century, and also by color gel manufacturers for theater use.

There are now many absorptive filters made from glass to which various inorganic or organic compounds have been added. Colored glass optical filters, although harder to make to precise transmittance specifications, are more durable and stable once manufactured.

==Dichroic filter==

Alternately, dichroic filters (also called &quot;reflective&quot; or &quot;thin film&quot; or &quot;interference&quot; filters) can be made by coating a glass substrate with a series of optical coatings. Dichroic filters usually reflect the unwanted portion of the light and transmit the remainder.

Dichroic filters use the principle of interference. Their layers form a sequential series of reflective cavities that resonate with the desired wavelengths. Other wavelengths destructively cancel or reflect as the peaks and troughs of the waves overlap.

Dichroic filters are particularly suited for precise scientific work, since their exact colour range can be controlled by the thickness and sequence of the coatings. They are usually much more expensive and delicate than absorption filters.

They can be used in devices such as the dichroic prism of a camera to separate a beam of light into different coloured components.

The basic scientific instrument of this type is a Fabry–Pérot interferometer. It uses two mirrors to establish a resonating cavity. It passes wavelengths that are a multiple of the cavity&#x27;s resonance frequency.

Etalons are another variation: transparent cubes or fibers whose polished ends form mirrors tuned to resonate with specific wavelengths. These are often used to separate channels in telecommunications networks that use wavelength division multiplexing on long-haul optic fibers.

==Monochromatic==
Monochromatic filters only allow a narrow range of wavelengths (essentially a single color) to pass.

==Infrared==
The term &quot;infrared filter&quot; can be ambiguous, as it may be applied to filters to pass infrared (blocking other wavelengths) or to block infrared (only).

Infrared-passing filters are used to block visible light but pass infrared; they are used, for example, in infrared photography.

Infrared cut-off filters are designed to block or reflect infrared wavelengths but pass visible light. Mid-infrared filters are often used as heat-absorbing filters in devices with bright incandescent light bulbs (such as slide and overhead projectors) to prevent unwanted heating due to infrared radiation. There are also filters which are used in solid state video cameras to block IR due to the high sensitivity of many camera sensors to unwanted near-infrared light.

==Ultraviolet==
Ultraviolet (UV) filters block ultraviolet radiation, but let visible light through. Because photographic film and digital sensors are sensitive to ultraviolet (which is abundant in skylight) but the human eye is not, such light would, if not filtered out, make photographs look different from the scene visible to people, for example making images of distant mountains appear unnaturally hazy. An ultraviolet-blocking filter renders images closer to the visual appearance of the scene.

As with infrared filters there is a potential ambiguity between UV-blocking and UV-passing filters; the latter are much less common, and more usually known explicitly as UV pass filters and UV bandpass filters.

==Neutral density==

Neutral density (ND) filters have a constant attenuation across the range of visible wavelengths, and are used to reduce the intensity of light by reflecting or absorbing a portion of it. They are specified by the optical density (OD) of the filter, which is the negative of the common logarithm of the transmission coefficient. They are useful for making photographic exposures longer. A practical example is making a waterfall look blurry when it is photographed in bright light. Alternatively, the photographer might want to use a larger aperture (so as to limit the depth of field); adding an ND filter permits this. ND filters can be reflective (in which case they look like partially reflective mirrors) or absorptive (appearing grey or black).

==Longpass==
A longpass (LP) Filter is an optical interference or coloured glass filter that attenuates shorter wavelengths and transmits (passes) longer wavelengths over the active range of the target spectrum (ultraviolet, visible, or infrared). Longpass filters, which can have a very sharp slope (referred to as edge filters), are described by the cut-on wavelength at 50 percent of peak transmission. In fluorescence microscopy, longpass filters are frequently utilized in dichroic mirrors and barrier (emission) filters. Use of the older term &#x27;low pass&#x27; to describe longpass filters has become uncommon; filters are usually described in terms of wavelength rather than frequency, and a &quot;low pass filter&quot;, without qualification, would be understood to be an electronic filter.

==Band-pass==
Band-pass filters only transmit a certain wavelength band, and block others. The width of such a filter is expressed in the wavelength range it lets through and can be anything from much less than an Ångström to a few hundred nanometers. Such a filter can be made by combining an LP- and an SP filter.

Examples of band-pass filters are the Lyot filter and the Fabry–Pérot interferometer. Both of these filters can also be made tunable, such that the central wavelength can be chosen by the user. Band-pass filters are often used in astronomy when one wants to observe a certain process with specific associated spectral lines. The Dutch Open Telescope and Swedish Solar Telescope are examples where Lyot and Fabry–Pérot filters are being used.

==Shortpass==
A shortpass (SP) Filter is an optical interference or coloured glass filter that attenuates longer wavelengths and transmits (passes) shorter wavelengths over the active range of the target spectrum (usually the ultraviolet and visible region). In fluorescence microscopy, shortpass filters are frequently employed in dichromatic mirrors and excitation filters.

==Guided-mode resonance filters==
A relatively new class of filters introduced around 1990. These filters are normally filters in reflection, that is they are notch filters in transmission. They consist in their most basic form of a substrate waveguide and a subwavelength grating or 2D hole array. Such filters are normally transparent, but when a leaky guided mode of the waveguide is excited they become highly reflective (a record of over 99% experimentally) for a particular polarization, angular orientations, and wavelength range. The parameters of the filters are designed by proper choice of the grating parameters. The advantage of such filters are the few layers needed for ultra-narrow bandwidth filters (in contrast to dichroic filters), and the potential decoupling between spectral bandwidth and angular tolerance when more than 1 mode is excited.

==Metal mesh filters==

Filters for sub-millimeter and near infrared wavelengths in astronomy are metal mesh grids that are stacked together to form LP, BP, and SP filters for these wavelengths.

==Polarizer==
Another kind of optical filter is a polarizer or polarization filter, which blocks or transmits light according to its polarization. They are often made of materials such as Polaroid and are used for sunglasses and photography. Reflections, especially from water and wet road surfaces, are partially polarized, and polarized sunglasses will block some of this reflected light, allowing an angler to better view below the surface of the water and better vision for a driver. Light from a clear blue sky is also polarized, and adjustable filters are used in colour photography to darken the appearance of the sky without introducing colours to other objects, and in both colour and black-and-white photography to control specular reflections from objects and water. Much older than g.m.r.f (just above) these first (and some still) use fine mesh integrated in the lens.

Polarized filters are also used to view certain types of stereograms, so that each eye will see a distinct image from a single source.

==Arc welding==
An arc source puts out visible, infrared and ultraviolet light that may be harmful to human eyes. Therefore, optical filters on welding helmets must meet ANSI Z87:1 (a safety glasses specification) in order to protect human vision.

Some examples of filters that would provide this kind of filtering would be earth elements embedded or coated on glass, but practically speaking it is not possible to do perfect filtering. A perfect filter would remove particular wavelengths and leave plenty of light so a worker can see what he/she is working on.

==Wedge filter==
A wedge filter is an optical filter so constructed that its thickness varies continuously or in steps in the shape of a wedge. The filter is used to modify the intensity distribution in a radiation beam. It is also known as linearly variable filter (LVF). It is used in various optical sensors where wavelength separation is required e.g. in hyperspectral sensors.

<text>James Wheaton (January 11, 1924 – June 9, 2002), was an American motion picture, stage, and television actor. Wheaton&#x27;s credits include &quot;THX 1138&quot;, &quot;Trouble Comes to Town&quot; and &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;.

In the early 1950s, he moved from his native Mississippi to Los Angeles, where he found work in local radio productions. His big break came when he was selected to join the Bishop&#x27;s Company, a repertory theatre company which toured churches in the United States.&quot; Wheaton appeared in their first production, Christopher Fry&#x27;s &quot;The Boy with a Cart,&quot; which premiered at the Vermont Square Methodist Church in Los Angeles on January 11, 1953.&quot; As the only African-American member of the group, he was given the opportunity to play a wide range of roles, which was rare for black actors at the time. One of his best known roles with the company was as &quot;Scratch&quot; in &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster.&quot; Later, he would become a leading actor with the Ebony Showcase Theatre in Los Angeles. He would also direct several productions for the theatre. Regarding his staging of &quot;The Odd Couple,&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; theatre critic Margaret Harford wrote &quot;James Wheaton&#x27;s slick direction makes the overall production all one could ask.&quot; His role as &quot;J.B. Mongoose&quot; in the Ebony Showcase production of &quot;Carnival Island&quot; was so popular, that he was soon appearing on television.

However, his biggest success on stage was the West Coast premiere of &quot;Norman, Is That You?&quot; at the Ebony Showcase Theater in Los Angeles. This production, in which he both directed and starred as the father was enormously popular with audiences and critics alike. At one time, it was the longest running play in the history of the Los Angeles theatre. &quot;With a blend of shock and bruised vanity, Wheaton gives a richly flavored performance&quot; wrote John C. Mahoney in his &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; review. &quot;Wheaton&#x27;s assured direction keeps featherweight ingredients afloat and on target.&quot;

During the late 1960s and 1970s, Wheaton appeared on some of the most popular television programs of the day including &quot;Room 222&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;Good Times&quot;, and the final episode of &quot;Ironside&quot;. He had a recurring role as Nelson B. Davis, &quot;The Friendly Undertaker&quot;, on &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;. Other feature film credits included &quot;Black Belt Jones&quot; and lastly, &quot;Gun Crazy&quot; with Drew Barrymore. He also reteamed with Bill Cosby in &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot;, which also starred and was directed by Sidney Poitier.

In the early 1970s he taught at Figueroa Street Elementary School and Parmelee Avenue Elementary School in Los Angeles.

<text>Administrative, territorial, and municipal division of the [[Altai Republic]] is regulated by the Law #12-15 of the Altai Republic, passed by the State Assembly—El Kurultai on June 2, 1999, with subsequent amendments. The Law established the following classification:
*administrative units ()
**[[raion|district]] ()—an administrative unit under jurisdiction of the Republic, governing a certain territory. Districts are governed from an administrative center.
**[[selsovet]] ()—a municipal unit under jurisdiction of a district comprising one or several settlements.
**dyuchina ()—national administrative unit for local self-governing of the native peoples. Dyuchinas would have the same administrative status as selsovets, but they have not been implemented in practice.
*inhabited localities ():
**urban settlements ():
***city/town ();
***urban-type settlement (); not implemented in practice;
***resort settlement (); not implemented in practice;
***suburban (dacha) settlement (); not implemented in practice
**rural settlements ()—settlements that do not satisfy the criteria for urban settlements:
***&quot;selo&quot; ();

<text>Anglo Irish Bank was an Irish bank headquartered in Dublin from 1964 to 2011. It began to wind down after nationalisation in 2009. In July 2011 Anglo Irish merged with the Irish Nationwide Building Society, forming a new company named the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation. Michael Noonan, the Minister for Finance stated that the name change was important in order to remove &quot;the negative international references associated with the appalling failings of both institutions and their previous managements&quot;.

Anglo Irish mainly dealt in business and commercial banking, and had only a limited retail presence in the major Irish cities. It also had wealth management and treasury divisions. Anglo Irish had operations in Austria, Switzerland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

The bank&#x27;s heavy exposure to property lending, with most of its loan book being to builders and property developers, meant that it was badly affected by the downturn in the Irish property market in 2008. In December 2008, the Irish government announced plans to inject €1.5 billion of capital for a 75% stake in the bank, effectively nationalising it. The Dublin and London Stock Exchanges immediately suspended trading in Anglo Irish&#x27;s shares, with the final closing share price of €0.22 representing a fall of over 98% from its peak.

On 16 January 2009 the then Taoiseach Brian Cowen stated that it was &quot;business as usual&quot; at Anglo Irish Bank, and people should be reassured that the bank is solvent. Between June and September 2009, the Minister for Finance provided €4 billion in capital. In a statement on 30 March 2010, a day before Anglo Irish Bank reported its financial results, the Minister of Finance Brian Lenihan announced an injection of €8.3 billion into the bank, noting that a further €10 billion may be required at a later stage to cover future losses and ensure an adequate capital base.

Since the nationalization of Anglo Irish Bank a number of controversies have arisen over certain business practices and loans, including loans to directors and loans to people associated with Brendan Murtagh, EMPG, and the QUINN group.

On 31 March 2010 Anglo Irish Bank reported results for the 15 months to December 2009. Losses for the period were €12.7 billion, with an operating profit before impairment of €2.4 billion and an impairment charges of €15.1 billion driving the overall result. It is the largest loss in Irish corporate history. Total assets declined to €85.2 billion at the end of 2009 from €101.3 billion in September 2008.

The European Commission allowed the Irish government on 10 August 2010 to temporarily grant €10 billion to Anglo Irish Bank – this included an additional €1.4 billion sought by Ireland to allow the nationalised bank meet its regulatory capital requirements in light of increased costs associated with transferring loans to the National Asset Management Agency.

In 2011 the accounts for UK savers were moved to the Allied Irish Bank (GB).

==Nationalisation==
On 15 January 2009, the Government announced that it would take steps that would enable the Bank to be taken into State ownership. The Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act, 2009 provided for the transfer of all the shares of the Bank to the Minister for Finance and was enacted under Irish law on 21 January 2009. On the same date, the Bank was re-registered as a private limited company.

In order to protect the capital position of the Bank the Minister for Finance provided €4 billion in capital between June and September 2009. A liability management exercise was also undertaken in August 2009 and €1.8 billion of equity was realised on the buyback, at a significant discount, of subordinated debt instruments. In December 2009, the Minister committed to safeguard the Bank&#x27;s regulatory capital position. As a result, the Minister issued of a promissory note for €8.3 billion on 31 March 2010, bringing the government&#x27;s investment in Anglo Irish bank to €12.3 billion. Since then the notes have risen in value to cover €30.6 billion of the €34.7 billion cost of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Bank (€25.3 billion of the €29.3 billion cost of Anglo and €5.3 billion of INBS&#x27;s €5.4 billion cost).

In his statement to the Irish Parliament on 30 March 2010, the Minister for Finance stated: &quot;Finding a long-term solution for Anglo Irish Bank is by far the biggest challenge in resolving the banking crisis. The sheer size of the bank means there are no easy or low cost options. Winding-up the bank is not and was never a viable option.&quot;

In September 2010, the government announced that it would separate the bank into two entities, an &quot;asset recovery bank&quot; to manage existing loans, and a separate &quot;funding bank&quot; holding deposits.

===Anglo Irish Bank Austria (AIBA) Sale===
On 5 September 2008, a few months before being nationalized, Anglo Irish sold its Anglo Irish Bank Austria (AIBA) division to Valartis Bank.

===Anglo &amp; INBS Merger===
A Transfer Order was made by the High Court in Dublin under the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 transferring the assets and liabilities of Irish Nationwide Building Society (&quot;INBS&quot;) to Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited (&quot;Anglo&quot; or the &quot;Bank&quot;) on 1 July 2011. This achieves the legal merger of the INBS business into Anglo consistent with directions provided to both entities by the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the European Commission.

==Financial results==
On 31 March 2010, Anglo Irish Bank reported results for the 15 months to December 2009. Loss for the period were €12.7 billion, with an operating profit before impairment of €2.4 billion and an impairment charges of €15.1 billion driving the overall result. Total assets declined to €85.2 billion at the end of 2009 from €101.3 billion in September 2008.

With the substantial capital investment in the Bank by the government offsetting the provisions, the Core Tier 1 and total regulatory capital were €5 billion and €8 billion respectively at the end of 2009 versus risk weighted assets of €73 billion.

Anglo Irish Bank is the largest contributor of assets to Ireland&#x27;s &quot;bad bank&quot;, the National Asset Management Agency. It expects to transfer loans with a nominal value of €35.6 billion to NAMA over 2010 which would see the risk-weighted-assets fall to €43 billion.

In Anglo Irish Bank&#x27;s 2009 Annual Report, referring to the QUINN group and related companies, it stated that the &quot;High Court in Ireland appointed two joint provisional administrators to a significant corporate borrower of the Group. The Group is closely monitoring the situation and assessing the potential implications of this development which may have a negative impact on impairment charges in 2010.&quot;

==Controversy of business practices &amp; loans==
On 4 April 2010, &quot;The Times&quot; described the lending practices at Anglo Irish Bank and how these led to the nationalisation of the bank. The article quotes the new CEO, Mike Aynsley: &quot;hubris played a very, very big part.&quot; In many deals, Anglo Irish Bank would lend to wealthy individuals to further their equity participation. According to the CEO of Ireland&#x27;s the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), loan-to-value on deals was as high as 100%. As a result, the bank was totally exposed to any decline in value. In many cases, Anglo took personal guarantees as security. However, NAMA attaches no value to these personal guarantees.

Of the €36.5 billion of loans not being transferred to NAMA, Anglo Irish Bank has taken a provision of €4.9 billion. The article in &quot;The Times&quot; notes that Anglo Irish Bank has large exposures to entrepreneurs such as Seán Quinn of Quinn Group and Barry O’Callaghan, of EMPG. In both cases, the bank&#x27;s security was limited and largely on the men&#x27;s shares in businesses. The provision of €4.9 billion compares with impaired loans of €9.5 billion at the end of December 2009.

===Loans to directors scandal===
Chairman Sean FitzPatrick, CEO David Drumm, and board member Lars Bradshaw resigned in December 2008, following the revelation of a loan scandal. FitzPatrick and Bradshaw had taken out loans in order to purchase Anglo Irish shares. From 2000 to 2008, FitzPatrick transferred the loans to another bank prior to year-end audits, thereby causing &quot;Loans to Directors&quot; to be understated. In 2008, the loan to FitzPatrick and Bradshaw amounted to €87 million; the transfer resulted in the accounts showing only about €40 million outstanding to directors, instead of €150 million. The Central Bank of Ireland revealed that they became aware of problems surrounding loans from Anglo Irish Bank to FitzPatrick, following an inspection earlier in 2008. The regulator said, &quot;While it does not appear that anything illegal took place in relation to these loans, the Central Bank of Ireland was of the view that the practices surrounding these loans were not appropriate. As a result, we continued to monitor and investigate this and as part of this process we advised Anglo-Irish Bank to ensure that these loans are reported in the annual accounts for 2008.&quot; The Financial Regulator resigned in January 2009 under pressure to do so.

In February 2009, Gardaí from the Bureau of Fraud Investigation raided the offices of Anglo Irish Bank.

In Anglo Irish Bank&#x27;s 2009 Annual Report it lists loans to former directors totalling €155.8 million at the end of December 2009 versus €178.7 million at the end of September 2008. Whereas no provisions for impairment had been taken in September 2008, in the 2009 annual report, an impairment charge of €108.9 million was reported, implying a potential loss of 70% of the value of the loans to former directors.

However, the total loans to directors, former directors and &quot;connected persons&quot; was reported to be significantly higher at €255 million in the notes of the annual report.

===Mainland Ventures===
As of November 2009, twenty-one major, Irish investors are suing Anglo and its Delaware subsidiary, Mainland Ventures Corporation, for US$23 million due to &quot;fraudulent and/or reckless concealment&quot; perpetrated in regards to a hotel investment fund. The outcome is pending.

===EMPG loans===
On 13 January 2009, opposition party TD George Lee highlighted the potential exposure of the Irish taxpayer to the failure of Education Media and Publishing Group, the holding company of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, given loans by Anglo Irish Bank to investors in EMPG. George Lee, TD for Dublin South, told journalists that EMPG, the parent company for US publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, has failed with equity investors likely to be wiped out. The Irish taxpayer was exposed since Anglo Irish Bank had loans outstanding to the shareholders of EMPG.

George Lee commented:
Interviewed on Irish State broadcaster, RTÉ, Barry O&#x27;Callaghan, Chairman of EMPG and CEO of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, confirmed that Irish investors as well as he himself were facing huge losses. He stated that &quot;no-one has lost more than me&quot;.

According to the &quot;Irish Times&quot;, investors of Davy Stockbrokers had US$475 million of equity in EMPG. The article did not identify how much or any of this investment was backed by Anglo Irish Bank loans. According to the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, Barry O&#x27;Callaghan is a large personal customer of Anglo Irish Bank. The &quot;Irish Independent&quot; article noted that former Anglo Irish Bank Chairman, Sean FitzPatrick is one of the Davy clients that had invested in EMPG.

Based on an analysis of the &quot;Irish Independent&#x27;s&quot; &quot;2008 Rich List&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;&#x27; &quot;2009 Rich List&quot;, Barry O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s personal debts in March 2008 were circa US$400 million.

On 15 January 2010, O&#x27;Callaghan admitted to having multimillion loans from Anglo Irish Bank and other international banks. Refusing to confirm the level of his indebtedness, O&#x27;Callaghan claimed to still be solvent and stated that he expects to honour all his obligations.

In contrast to the statement of George Lee that Irish taxpayers were exposed, an Anglo Irish Bank spokesperson was reported by the &quot;Irish Times&quot; to have stated that it did not have a &quot;big exposure&quot; to EMPG. However, the spokesperson did not comment on whether it had exposure to individuals who had exposure to EMPG.

===Loans to Sean Quinn &amp; the Quinn Group===
On 30 March 2010, following an application by Ireland&#x27;s Financial Regulator, the High Court appointed joint provisional administrators to Quinn Insurance Limited. According to the Irish Independent, eight subsidiaries of Quinn Insurance provided guarantees of €1.2bn to cover Quinn Group&#x27;s debts, prompting the regulator to seek the appointment of provisional administrators in the High Court. In total the Quinn family is estimated to have €2.8 billion of loans from Anglo Irish Bank and the Quinn group has an additional €1.2 billion of loans. Of these circa €780 million need to be re-financed this year.

Given the magnitude of the loans to Anglo Irish Bank the company was reported to be considering a €700 million financial rescue of the Quinn group. The plan, would see €150 million injected into Quinn Insurance and €550 million would be used to pay off bondholders. Anglo Irish Bank would become the majority shareholder in the Quinn Group. This would be, in effect, a hostile takeover and as it will be done by a government agency – the nationalization of a private company by fiat.

The Quinn group has taken action to counter the moves by the Financial Regulator including the mobilisation of its employees into street protests. The Group furthermore has rejected press speculation that the Group needs €700m of financing. Instead the Group estimates that a cash injection of between €100m and €150m is required. refusing to speculate on the need for a €550 million payment to bondholders, it noted that a re-financing, if it occurred, would not necessarily increase the overall debt of the Group.

On 12 April 2010, the Financial Regulator and Quinn group were due in the High Court. The decision on a permanent appointment of administrators was postponed by one week, following a last minute submission of documents by the Quinn Group. The company pledged to work hard to seek a resolution to the uncertainty created by the appointment of provisional administrators to Quinn Insurance. On 15 April 2010, the Irish Times reported that Quinn Insurance decided not to fight the appointment of a permanent administrator.

<text>A resolver is a type of rotary electrical transformer used for measuring degrees of rotation. It is considered an analog device, and has digital counterparts such as the digital resolver, rotary (or pulse) encoder.

==Description==

The most common type of resolver is the brushless transmitter resolver (other types are described at the end). On the outside, this type of resolver may look like a small electrical motor having a stator and rotor. On the inside, the configuration of the wire windings makes it different. The stator portion of the resolver houses three windings: an exciter winding and two two-phase windings (usually labeled &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;) (case of a brushless resolver). The exciter winding is located on the top; it is a coil of a turning (rotary) transformer. This rotary transformer induces current in the rotor without wires or brushes to provide a direct electrical connection. The two other windings are on the bottom, wound on a lamination. They are configured at 90 degrees from each other. The rotor houses a coil, which is the secondary winding of the turning transformer, and a separate primary winding in a lamination, exciting the two two-phase windings on the stator.

The primary winding of the transformer, fixed to the stator, is excited by a sinusoidal electric current, which by electromagnetic induction induces current in the rotor. As these windings are arranged on the axis of the resolver, the same current is induced no matter what its position. This current then flows through the other winding on the rotor, in turn inducing current in its secondary windings, the two-phase windings back on the stator. The two two-phase windings, fixed at right (90°) angles to each other on the stator, produce a sine and cosine feedback current. The relative magnitudes of the two-phase voltages are measured and used to determine the angle of the rotor relative to the stator. Upon one full revolution, the feedback signals repeat their waveforms. This device may also appear in non-brushless type, i.e., only consisting in two lamination stacks, rotor and stator.

Resolvers can perform very accurate analog conversion from polar to rectangular coordinates. Shaft angle is the polar angle, and excitation voltage is the magnitude. The outputs are the [x] and [y] components. Resolvers with four-lead rotors can rotate [x] and [y] coordinates, with the shaft position giving the desired rotation angle.

Resolvers with four output leads are general sine/cosine computational devices. When used with electronic driver amplifiers and feedback windings tightly coupled to the input windings, their accuracy is enhanced, and they can be cascaded (&quot;resolver chains&quot;) to compute functions with several terms, perhaps of several angles, such as gun (position) orders corrected for ship&#x27;s roll and pitch.

For the position evaluation, resolver-to-digital converters are commonly used. They convert the sine and cosine signal to a binary signal (10 to 16 bits wide) that can more easily be used by the controller.

==Types ==
Basic resolvers are two-pole resolvers, meaning that the angular information is the mechanical angle of the stator. These devices can deliver the absolute angle position. Other types of resolver are multipole resolvers. They have 2&quot;p&quot; poles (&quot;p&quot; pole pairs), and thus can deliver &quot;p&quot; cycles in one rotation of the rotor: the electrical angle is &quot;p&quot; times the mechanical angle. Some types of resolvers include both types, with the 2-pole windings used for absolute position and the multipole windings for accurate position. Two-pole resolvers can usually reach angular accuracy up to about ±5, whereas a multipole resolver can provide better accuracy, up to 10 for 16-pole resolvers, to even 1 for 128-pole resolvers.

Multipole resolvers may also be used for monitoring multipole electrical motors. This device can be used in any application in which the exact rotation of an object relative to another object is needed, such as in a rotary antenna platform or a robot. In practice, the resolver is usually directly mounted to an electric motor. The resolver feedback signals are usually monitored for multiple revolutions by another device. This allows for geared reduction of assemblies being rotated and improved accuracy from the resolver system.

Because the power supplied to the resolvers produces no actual work, the voltages used are usually low (&lt;24 VAC) for all resolvers. Resolvers designed for terrestrial use tend to be driven at 50–60 Hz (utility frequency), while those for marine or aviation use tend to operate at 400 Hz (the frequency of the on-board generator driven by the engines). Aerospace applications utilize 2,930 Hz to 10 kHz at voltages ranging from 4 VRMS to 10 VRMS. Many of the aerospace applications are used to determine the position of an actuator or torque motor position. Control systems tend to use higher frequencies (5 kHz).

Other types of resolver include:
;Receiver resolvers: These resolvers are used in the opposite way to transmitter resolvers (the type described above). The two diphased windings are energized, the ratio between the sine and the cosine representing the electrical angle. The system turns the rotor to obtain a zero voltage in the rotor winding. At this position, the mechanical angle of the rotor equals the electrical angle applied to the stator.
;Differential resolvers: These types combine two diphased primary windings in one of the stacks of sheets, as with the receiver, and two diphased secondary windings in the other. The relation of the electrical angle delivered by the two secondary windings and the other angles is secondary electrical angle, mechanical angle, and primary electrical angle. These types were used, for instance, as analog trigonometric-function calculators.

A related type is also the transolver, combining a two-phase winding like the resolver and a triphased winding like the synchro.

<text>A synchro (also known as selsyn and by other brand names) is, in effect, a transformer whose primary-to-secondary coupling may be varied by physically changing the relative orientation of the two windings. Synchros are often used for measuring the angle of a rotating machine such as an antenna platform or transmitting rotation. In its general physical construction, it is much like an electric motor. The primary winding of the transformer, fixed to the rotor, is excited by an alternating current, which by electromagnetic induction causes voltages to appear between the Y-connected secondary windings fixed at 120 degrees to each other on the stator. The voltages are measured and used to determine the angle of the rotor relative to the stator.

== Uses ==
Synchro systems were first used in the control system of the Panama Canal in the early 1900s to transmit lock gate and valve stem positions, and water levels, to the control desks.
Fire-control system designs developed during World War II used synchros extensively, to transmit angular information from guns and sights to an analog fire control computer, and to transmit the desired gun position back to the gun location. Early systems just moved indicator dials, but with the advent of the amplidyne, as well as motor-driven high-powered hydraulic servos, the fire control system could directly control the positions of heavy guns.

Smaller synchros are still used to remotely drive indicator gauges and as rotary position sensors for aircraft control surfaces, where the reliability of these rugged devices is needed. Digital devices such as the rotary encoder have replaced synchros in most other applications. 

Selsyn motors were widely used in motion picture equipment to synchronize movie cameras and sound recording equipment, before the advent of crystal oscillators and microelectronics.

Large synchros were used on naval warships, such as destroyers, to operate the steering gear from the wheel on the bridge.

== Synchro system types ==
There are two types of synchro systems: torque systems and control systems.

In a torque system, a synchro will provide a low-power mechanical output sufficient to position an indicating device, actuate a sensitive switch or move light loads without power amplification. In simpler terms, a torque synchro system is a system in which the transmitted signal does the usable work. In such a system, accuracy on the order of one degree is attainable.

In a control system, a synchro will provide a voltage for conversion to torque through an amplifier and a servomotor. Control type synchros are used in applications that require large torques or high accuracy such as follow-up links and error detectors in servo, automatic control systems (such as an autopilot system). In simpler terms, a control synchro system is a system in which the transmitted signal controls a source of power which does the usable work.

Quite often, one system will perform both torque and control functions. Individual units are designed for use in either torque or control systems. Some torque units can be used as control units, but control units cannot replace torque units.

== Synchro functional categories ==
A synchro will fall into one of eight functional categories:

; Torque transmitter (TX)
:: Input: rotor positioned mechanically or manually by the information to be transmitted.
:: Output: electrical output from stator identifying the rotor position supplied to a torque receiver, torque differential transmitter or a torque differential receiver.

; Control transmitter (CX)
:: Input: same as TX.
:: Output: electrical output same as TX but supplied to a control transformer or control differential transmitter.

; Torque differential transmitter (TDX)
::Input: TX output applied to stator; rotor positioned according to amount data from TX that must be modified.
::Output: electrical output from rotor (representing an angle equal to the algebraic sum or difference of rotor position angle and angular data from TX) supplied to torque receivers, another TDX, or a torque differential receiver.

; Control differential transmitter (CDX)
::Input: same as TDX but data supplied by CX.
::Output: same as TDX but supplied to only a control transformer or another CDX.

; Torque receiver (TR)
::Input: Electrical angle position data from TX or TDX supplied to stator.
::Output: Rotor assumes position determined by electrical input supplied.

; Torque differential receiver (TDR)
::Input: electrical data supplied from two TX&#x27;s, two TDX&#x27;s or from one TX and one TDX (one connected to the rotor and one connected to the stator).
::Output: rotor assumes position equal to the algebraic sum or difference of two angular inputs.

; Control transformer (CT)
::Input: electrical data from CX or CDX applied to stator. Rotor positioned mechanically or manually.
::Output: electrical output from rotor (proportional to sine of the difference between rotor angular position and electrical input angle).

; Torque receiver-transmitter (TRX)
: designed as a torque receiver, but may be used as either a transmitter or receiver.
::Input: depending on the application, same as TX.
::Output: depending on the application, same as TX or TR.

== Operation ==
On a practical level, synchros resemble motors, in that there is a rotor, stator, and a shaft. Ordinarily, slip rings and brushes connect the rotor to external power. A synchro transmitter&#x27;s shaft is rotated by the mechanism that sends information, while the synchro receiver&#x27;s shaft rotates a dial, or operates a light mechanical load. Single and three-phase units are common in use, and will follow the other&#x27;s rotation when connected properly. One transmitter can turn several receivers; if torque is a factor, the transmitter must be physically larger to source the additional current. In a motion picture interlock system, a large motor-driven distributor can drive as many as 20 machines, sound dubbers, footage counters, and projectors.

Synchros designed for terrestrial use tend to be driven at 50 or 60 hertz (the mains frequency in most countries), while those for marine or aeronautical use tend to operate at 400 hertz (the frequency of the on-board electrical generator driven by the engines).

Single phase units have five wires: two for an exciter winding (typically line voltage) and three for the output/input. These three are bussed to the other synchros in the system, and provide the power and information to align the shafts of all the receivers. Synchro transmitters and receivers must be powered by the same branch circuit, so to speak; the mains excitation voltage sources must match in voltage and phase. The safest approach is to bus the five or six lines from transmitters and receivers at a common point. Different makes of selsyns, used in interlock systems, have different output voltages. In all cases, three-phase systems will handle more power and operate a bit more smoothly. The excitation is often 208/240-V 3-phase mains power. Many synchros operate on 30 to 60V AC also.

Synchro transmitters are as described, but 50- and 60-Hz synchro receivers require rotary dampers to keep their shafts from oscillating when not loaded (as with dials) or lightly loaded in high-accuracy applications.

A different type of receiver, called a control transformer (CT), is part of a position servo that includes a servo amplifier and servo motor. The motor is geared to the CT rotor, and when the transmitter&#x27;s rotor moves, the servo motor turns the CT&#x27;s rotor and the mechanical load to match the new position. CTs have high-impedance stators and draw much less current than ordinary synchro receivers when not correctly positioned.

Synchro transmitters can also feed synchro to digital converters, which provide a digital representation of the shaft angle.

== Synchro variants ==
So-called &quot;brushless synchros&quot; use rotary transformers (that have no magnetic interaction with the usual rotor and stator) to feed power to the rotor. These transformers have stationary primaries, and rotating secondaries. The secondary is somewhat like a spool wound with magnet wire, the axis of the spool concentric with the rotor&#x27;s axis. The &quot;spool&quot; is the secondary winding&#x27;s core, its flanges are the poles, and its coupling does not vary significantly with rotor position. The primary winding is similar, surrounded by its magnetic core, and its end pieces are like thick washers. The holes in those end pieces align with the rotating secondary poles.

For high accuracy in gun fire control and aerospace work, so called multi-speed synchro data links were used. For instance, a two-speed link had two transmitters, one rotating for one turn over the full range (such as a gun&#x27;s bearing), while the other rotated one turn for every 10 degrees of bearing. The latter was called a 36-speed synchro. Of course, the gear trains were made accordingly. At the receiver, the magnitude of the 1X channel&#x27;s error determined whether the &quot;fast&quot; channel was to be used instead. A small 1X error meant that the 36x channel&#x27;s data was unambiguous. Once the receiver servo settled, the fine channel normally retained control.

For very critical applications, three-speed synchro systems have been used.

So called multispeed synchros have stators with many poles, so that their output voltages go through several cycles for one physical revolution. For two-speed systems, these do not require gearing between the shafts.

Differential synchros are another category. They have three-lead rotors and stators like the stator described above, and can be transmitters or receivers. A differential transmitter is connected between a synchro transmitter and a receiver, and its shaft&#x27;s position adds to (or subtracts from, depending upon definition) the angle defined by the transmitter. A differential receiver is connected between two transmitters, and shows the sum (or difference, again as defined) between the shaft positions of the two transmitters. There are synchro-like devices called transolvers, somewhat like differential synchros, but with three-lead rotors and four-lead stators.

A resolver is similar to a synchro, but has a stator with four leads, the windings being 90 degrees apart physically instead of 120 degrees. Its rotor might be synchro-like, or have two sets of windings 90 degrees apart. Although a pair of resolvers could theoretically operate like a pair of synchros, resolvers are used for computation.

A special T-connected transformer arrangement invented by Scott (&quot;Scott T&quot;) interfaces between resolver and synchro data formats; it was invented to interconnect two-phase AC power with three-phase power, but can also be used for precision applications.

<text>The liberation of Paris () was a battle that took place during World War II from 19 August 1944 until the German garrison surrendered the French capital on 25 August 1944. Paris had been occupied by Nazi Germany since the signing of the Armistice of 22 June 1940, after which the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; occupied northern and western France.

The liberation began when the French Forces of the Interior—the military structure of the French Resistance—staged an uprising against the German garrison upon the approach of the US Third Army, led by General George S. Patton. On the night of 24 August, elements of General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque&#x27;s 2nd French Armored Division made their way into Paris and arrived at the Hôtel de Ville shortly before midnight. The next morning, 25 August, the bulk of the 2nd Armored Division and US 4th Infantry Division and other allied units entered the city. Dietrich von Choltitz, commander of the German garrison and the military governor of Paris, surrendered to the French at the Hôtel Le Meurice, the newly established French headquarters. General Charles de Gaulle of the French Army arrived to assume control of the city as head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic.

==Background==

The Allied strategy emphasised destroying the German forces retreating towards the Rhine, and the French Forces of the Interior (the armed force of the French Resistance), led by Henri Rol-Tanguy, staged an uprising in Paris.

The Battle of the Falaise Pocket (12–21 August), the final phase of Operation Overlord, was still ongoing, and General Dwight Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, did not consider the liberation of Paris a primary objective. The goal of the US and of British Armed Forces was to destroy the German forces and therefore to end World War II in Europe, which would allow the Allies to concentrate all of their efforts on the Pacific Front.

The French Resistance began to rise against the Germans in Paris on 15 August, but the Allies were still pushing the Germans toward the Rhine and did not want to get embroiled in a battle for the liberation of Paris. The Allies thought that it was too early to take Paris. They were aware that Adolf Hitler had ordered the German military to completely destroy the city in the event of an Allied attack. Paris was considered to have too great a value, culturally and historically, to risk its destruction. They were also keen to avoid a drawn-out battle of attrition like during the Battle of Stalingrad and the Siege of Leningrad. It was also estimated that in the event of a siege, of food per day, as well as significant amounts of building materials, manpower and engineering skill, would be required to feed the population after the liberation of Paris. Basic utilities would have to be restored and transportation systems rebuilt. All of those supplies were needed in other areas of the war effort.
De Gaulle was concerned that military rule by Allied forces would be implemented in France with the implementation of the Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories. That administration which had been planned by the American Chiefs of Staff had been approved by US President Franklin Roosevelt but had been opposed by Eisenhower. Nevertheless, De Gaulle, upon learning the French Resistance had risen up against the German occupiers and unwilling to allow his countrymen to be slaughtered as was happening to the Polish Resistance during the Warsaw Uprising, petitioned for an immediate frontal assault. He threatened to detach the French 2nd Armored Division (2e DB) and to order it to single-handedly attack the German forces in Paris, bypassing the SHAEF chain of command in so doing, if Eisenhower delayed approval unduly.

===Preceding events (15–19 August 1944)===

On 15 August, in the northeastern suburb of Pantin, 1,654 men (among them 168 captured Allied airmen), and 546 women, all political prisoners, were sent to the concentration camps of Buchenwald (men) and Ravensbrück (women), on what was to be the last convoy to Germany. Pantin had been the area of Paris from which the Germans had entered the capital in June 1940.

The same day, employees of the Paris Métro, the Gendarmerie and Police went on strike; postal workers followed the next day. They were soon joined by workers across the city, which caused a general strike to break out on 18 August.

On 16 August, 35 young FFI members were betrayed by an agent of the Gestapo. They had gone to a secret meeting near the &quot;Grande Cascade&quot; in the Bois de Boulogne and were gunned down there.

On 17 August, concerned that the Germans were placing explosives at strategic points around the city, Pierre Taittinger, the chairman of the municipal council, met Dietrich von Choltitz, the military governor of Paris. When Choltitz told them that he intended to slow the Allied advance as much as possible, Taittinger and Swedish Consul Raoul Nordling attempted to persuade Choltitz not to destroy Paris.

==Battle and liberation==
===FFI uprising (19–23 August)===
All over France, since the end of the battle of Normandy, the population had been hearing news of the Allies&#x27; advance toward Paris from the BBC and French public broadcaster &quot;Radiodiffusion nationale&quot; (&quot;RN&quot;). From 1943, &quot;RN&quot; had been operating in Paris under the direction of the Vichy propaganda minister Philippe Henriot. On 4 April 1944, four months before the liberation of Paris, the Provisional Government of the French Republic had begun operating its own &quot;RN&quot; from Algeria. The Provisional Government took over the Paris &quot;RN&quot; during the liberation on 22 August 1944.

On 19 August, continuing their retreat eastwards, columns of German vehicles moved down the Avenue des Champs Élysées. Posters calling citizens to arm had previously been pasted on walls by FFI members. The posters called for a general mobilization of the Parisians; argued that &quot;the war continues&quot;; and called on the Parisian police, the Republican Guard, the gendarmerie, the Garde Mobile, the Groupe mobile de réserve (the police units replacing the army), and patriotic Frenchmen (&quot;all men from 18 to 50 able to carry a weapon&quot;) to join &quot;the struggle against the invader&quot;. Other posters assured that &quot;victory is near&quot; and promised &quot;chastisement for the traitors&quot;, Vichy loyalists and collaborators. The posters were signed by the &quot;Parisian Committee of the Liberation&quot;, in agreement with the Provisional Government of the French Republic, and under the orders of &quot;Regional Chief Colonel Rol&quot; (Henri Rol-Tanguy), the commander of the French Forces of the Interior in Île de France.

The first skirmishes between the French and the German occupiers then began. Small mobile units of the Red Cross moved into the city to assist French and the German wounded. The same day, the Germans detonated a barge filled with mines in the northeastern suburb of Pantin, setting fired to mills that supplied Paris with flour.

On 20 August, as barricades began to appear, Resistance fighters organized themselves to sustain a siege. Trucks were positioned, trees cut down and trenches were dug in the pavement to free paving stones for consolidating the barricades. The materials were transported by men, women and children using wooden carts. Fuel trucks were attacked and captured. Civilian vehicles were commandeered, painted with camouflage, and marked with the FFI emblem. The Resistance used them to transport ammunition and orders from one barricade to another.

Skirmishes reached their peak on 22 August, when some German units tried to leave their fortifications. At 9:00 a.m. on 23 August, under Choltitz&#x27;s orders, the Germans opened fire on the Grand Palais, an FFI stronghold, and German tanks fired at the barricades in the streets. Hitler gave the order to inflict maximum damage on the city.

===Allies enter Paris (24–25 August)===
On 24 August, after combat and poor roads had delayed his 2nd Armored Division, Free French general Leclerc disobeyed his direct superior, American V Corps commander Major General Leonard T. Gerow, and sent a vanguard to Paris with the message that the entire division would be there the following day. The 2nd Armored Division was equipped with American M4 Sherman tanks, halftracks and trucks, and the vanguard that Leclerc chose was the 9th Company of the Régiment de marche du Tchad, nicknamed &quot;La Nueve&quot; (Spanish for &quot;the nine&quot;) because of its 160 men under French command, 146 of them were Spanish Republicans. 9th Company commander Captain Raymond Dronne became the second uniformed Allied officer to enter Paris after Amado Granell and the first French officer to reenter the capital.

The 9th Company broke into the center of Paris by the Porte d&#x27;Italie and reached the Hôtel de Ville at 9:22 p.m. Upon entering the town hall square, the half-track &quot;Ebro&quot; fired the first rounds at a large group of German fusiliers and machine guns. Civilians went out to the street and sang &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, including as Pierre Schaeffer broadcast the news of the 2nd Armored Division&#x27;s arrival on a Radiodiffusion Nationale broadcast and then played it. Schaeffer then asked any priests who were listening to ring their churches&#x27; bells, and the churches who participated included Notre-Dame de Paris and Sacré-Cœur in Montmartre – whose bells include the Savoyarde, a bourdon that is France&#x27;s biggest bell. Dronne later went to von Choltitz&#x27;s command post to request the German surrender.

The 4th US Infantry Division commanded by Raymond Barton also entered through the Porte d&#x27;Italie in the early hours of the next day. The leading American regiments covered the right flank of the French 2nd Armoured, turned east at the Place de la Bastille, and made their way along Avenue Daumesnil, heading towards the Bois de Vincennes. In the afternoon the British 30 Assault Unit had entered the Porte d&#x27;Orléans and then searched buildings for vital intelligence, later capturing the former Headquarters of Admiral Karl Dönitz, the Château de la Muette.

While awaiting the final capitulation, the 9th Company assaulted the Chamber of Deputies, the Hôtel Majestic and the Place de la Concorde.

With the battle nearing its end, resistance groups brought Allied airmen and other troops hidden in suburban towns, such as Montlhéry, into central Paris.

===German surrender (25 August)===

Despite repeated orders from Hitler that the French capital &quot;must not fall into the enemy&#x27;s hand except lying in complete debris&quot;, which was to be accomplished by bombing it and blowing up its bridges, Choltitz, as commander of the German garrison and military governor of Paris, surrendered at 3:30 p.m. at the Hôtel Meurice. He was then driven to the Paris Police Prefecture, where he signed the official surrender, and then to the Gare Montparnasse, where General Leclerc had established his command post, to sign the surrender of the German troops in Paris.

===De Gaulle&#x27;s speech (25 August)===
The same day that the Germans surrendered, de Gaulle, President of the Provisional Government of the French Republic, moved back into the War Ministry on the Rue Saint-Dominique and then made a speech at the Hôtel de Ville that was also broadcast. His speech proclaimed that Paris had liberated itself with help from French forces, notably downplaying the part that Barton&#x27;s 4th Infantry played in the battle, and also dismissed Vichy as a false France.

===Victory parades (26 and 29 August)===
The day after de Gaulle&#x27;s speech, he marched down the Champs-Élysées as Leclerc&#x27;s French 2nd Armored Division paraded behind.

De Gaulle had requested that a French unit be allowed to lead the liberation of Paris, which Allied High Command agreed to on the condition that the chosen unit not contain any black or non-white soldiers, as two-thirds of Free French forces were black colonial soldiers. The 2nd Armored Division was chosen for the parade because it was the only French formation which was majority white. Non-white soldiers in the division, predominantly Moroccans and Algerian, who made up around one quarter of its strength, were replaced by white soldiers from other units, supplemented by lighter-skinned soldiers from North Africa and Syria.

The parade began at the Arc de Triomphe at the western end, where de Gaulle also rekindled the Eternal Flame at France&#x27;s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It is estimated that up to two million people viewed this parade and reported that such a crowd and the scenes it created on the Champs-Élysées were not seen there again until France won the FIFA World Cup for the first time as hosts in 1998.

A few German snipers were still active, and ones from rooftops in the Hôtel de Crillon area shot at the crowd while de Gaulle entered the Place de la Concorde.
On 29 August, the US Army&#x27;s 28th Infantry Division, which had assembled in the Bois de Boulogne the previous night, paraded 24-abreast up the &quot;Avenue Hoche&quot; to the Arc de Triomphe, then down the Champs Élysées. Joyous crowds greeted the Americans as the entire division, men and vehicles, marched through Paris &quot;on its way to assigned attack positions northeast of the French capital.&quot;

===Food crisis===
The liberation was ongoing, but it became apparent that food in Paris was getting scarcer by the day. The French rail network had largely been destroyed by Allied bombing and so getting food in had become a problem, especially since the Germans had stripped Paris of its resources for themselves. The Allies realised the necessity to get Paris back on its feet and pushed a plan for food convoys to get through to the capital as soon as possible. In addition, surrounding towns and villages were requested to supply as much to Paris as possible. The Civil Affairs of SHAEF authorised the import of up to 2,400 tons of food per day at the expense of the military effort. A British food convoy labelled &#x27;Vivres Pour Paris&#x27; entered on 29 August, US supplies were flown in via Orléans Airport before they were sent in. Also, 500 tons were delivered a day by the British and another 500 tons by the Americans. Along with French civilians outside Paris bringing in indigenous resources, the food crisis had been overcome within ten days.

==Aftermath==

An estimated 800 to 1,000 Resistance fighters were killed during the Battle for Paris, and another 1,500 were wounded.

The 2nd Armored Division suffered 71 killed and 225 wounded. Material losses included 35 tanks, 6 self-propelled guns, and 111 vehicles, &quot;a rather high ratio of losses for an armored division&quot;, according to historian Jacques Mordal.

Choltitz was held for the remainder of the war at Trent Park near London along with other senior German officers. In his memoir &quot;Brennt Paris?&quot; (&quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot;), first published in 1950, Choltitz describes himself as the saviour of Paris, but some historians opine that it was more the case that he had lost control of the city and had no means to carry out Hitler&#x27;s orders. No specific charges were ever filed against him, and he was released from captivity in 1947.

The uprising in Paris gave the newly-established Free French government and its president, Charles de Gaulle, enough prestige and authority to establish a provisional French Republic. That replaced the fallen Vichy regime (1940–1944) and united the politically-divided French Resistance by drawing Gaullists, nationalists, communists and anarchists into a new &quot;national unanimity&quot; government.

De Gaulle emphasised the role of the French in the liberation. He drove the necessity for the French people to do their &quot;duty of war&quot; by advancing into the Benelux countries and Germany. He wanted France to be among &quot;the victors&quot;, a belief that it had escaped the fate of being administered and having a new constitution imposed by the AMGOT threat like those that would be established in Germany and Japan in 1945.

Although Paris was liberated, there was still heavy fighting elsewhere in France. Large portions of the country were still occupied after the successful Operation Dragoon in southern France, which extended into the south-western region of the Vosges Mountains from 15 August to 14 September. Fighting went on in Alsace and Lorraine in eastern France during the last months of 1944 until the early months of 1945.

===Legal purge===

Several alleged Vichy loyalists involved in the Milice, a paramilitary militia established by Sturmbannführer Joseph Darnand that, along with the Gestapo, hunted the Resistance were made prisoners in a post-liberation purge known as the &quot;Épuration légale&quot; (legal purge). Some were executed without trial. Women accused of &quot;horizontal collaboration&quot; because of alleged sexual relationships with Germans were arrested and had their heads shaved, were publicly exhibited and were sometimes allowed to be mauled by mobs.

On 17 August, the Germans took Pierre Laval to Belfort. On 20 August, under German military escort, Marshal Philippe Pétain was forcibly moved to Belfort and then to the Sigmaringen enclave in Germany on 7 September; there, 1,000 of his followers (including Louis-Ferdinand Céline) joined him. They established the government of Sigmaringen and challenged the legitimacy of de Gaulle&#x27;s Provisional Government of the French Republic. As a sign of protest over his forced move, Pétain refused to take office, and was eventually replaced by Fernand de Brinon. The Vichy government-in-exile ended in April 1945.

===Anniversaries of the liberation===
On 25 August 2004, two military parades reminiscent of the parades of 26 and 29 August 1944, one in commemoration of the 2nd Armored Division, the other of the US 4th Infantry Division, and featuring armoured vehicles from the era, were held on the 60th anniversary of the Liberation of Paris. Under the auspices of the Senate, a jazz concert and popular dancing took place in the Jardin du Luxembourg. In the same event, homage was paid to the Spanish contribution – the first time in 60 years. Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoë laid a plaque on a wall along the River Seine at the Quai Henri IV in the presence of surviving Spanish veterans, Javier Rojo the President of the Senate of Spain and a delegation of Spanish politicians.

On 25 August 2014, plaques were placed on the Boulevard Saint-Michel and neighboring streets, in the vicinity of the Luxembourg Palace, seat of the French Senate, where combatants had been killed in August 1944. There was dancing in the street in every neighborhood of the French capital and &quot;Place de la Bastille&quot;, as well as a &quot;son et lumière&quot; spectacle and dancing on the Place de l&#x27;Hôtel de Ville in the evening.

On 25 August 2019 many acts in commemoration of the liberation of Paris focused on the role of the Spanish soldiers of &quot;La Nueve&quot;. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, herself descendant of Spanish Republican veterans, emphasized during the inauguration of a fresco that it has taken too long to recognize this chapter of the French history.

===Homage to the liberation martyrs===

On 16 May 2007, following his election as President of the Fifth French Republic, Nicolas Sarkozy organized an homage to the 35 French Resistance martyrs executed by the Germans on 16 August 1944. French historian Max Gallo narrated the events that took place in the woods of Bois de Boulogne, and a Parisian schoolgirl read 17-year-old French resistant Guy Môquet&#x27;s final letter. During his speech, Sarkozy announced that this letter would be read in all French schools to remember the resistance spirit. After the speech, the chorale of the French Republican Guard closed the homage ceremony by singing the French Resistance&#x27;s anthem &quot;&quot;Le Chant des Partisans&quot;&quot; (&quot;The Partisans&#x27; song&quot;). Following this occasion, the new president traveled to Berlin to meet German chancellor Angela Merkel, as a symbol of the Franco-German reconciliation.

== In popular culture ==
===&quot;La Libération de Paris&quot;===
&quot;La Libération de Paris&quot; (&quot;The Liberation of Paris&quot;), whose original title was &quot;L&#x27;Insurrection Nationale inséparable de la Libération Nationale&quot; (&quot;The National Insurrection inseparable from the National Liberation&quot;), was a short 30-minute documentary film secretly shot between 16 and 27 August by the French Resistance. It was released in French theatres on 1 September.

=== Postal material ===

On 8 September 1945, the U.S. Post Office issued a three-cent stamp commemorating the liberation of Paris from the Germans. First day covers were illustrated with images of the Ludendorff Bridge illustrating its capture. Other countries have issued stamps commemorating the bridge&#x27;s capture, including Nicaragua, Guyana, Micronesia, and Republic of the Marshall Islands.

<text>Baltimore Technologies was a leading Irish internet security firm, with its headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was briefly part of the FTSE 100 Index during 2000 when Fran Rooney was the CEO.

==History==
The company was founded in 1976 by Michael Purser. Before the 1990s, the company had focused on consultancy for telecoms companies and also took part in European research projects. Around this time, Pat Cremin took over as managing director from Jim Mountjoy and began developing products like the Crypto Systems Toolbox, based on Purser&#x27;s interests in cryptography.

Baltimore was acquired in 1996 by a team financed by Dermot Desmond and led by Fran Rooney. In December 1998 it was further acquired by Zergo Limited, a UK company listed on the London Stock Exchange. Post-acquisition, Zergo changed its name to Baltimore Technologies and Fran Rooney was appointed CEO of the merged company. Under Rooney&#x27;s leadership, Baltimore expanded rapidly, both through organic growth and by a series of high-profile acquisitions. In 1999 the company was listed on NASDAQ and the share price soared in value during the internet boom as its digital certificate business was seen as a vital tool to enable e-Commerce. The company showed considerable growth in both sales and market capitalisation, becoming a FTSE 100 firm with a market capitalization of over US$13 billion. However, following the stock market crash of March 2000, its share price fell.

Rooney resigned as CEO in July 2001 and a bidding war for the Company ensued.

Bijan Khezri, a former director of Baltimore Technologies in charge of capital markets finance, who had left the company over disagreements with Fran Rooney in 2000, was appointed CEO. The new management team disastrously sold off the different business units in a series of demergers and by December 2003, following the sale of the PKI business to Betrusted and the authentication business to Hewlett Packard, the company was left with nothing but a cash shell.

In March 2004 the board announced its intention to move into the &quot;clean energy&quot; business. The plan was abandoned in June 2004 when vulture fund Acquisitor Holdings of Bermuda acquired sufficient shares to take control of the cash. In February 2005 Acquisitor delisted Baltimore from the London Stock Exchange and the various parties within Acquisitor split. The company listed on the Alternative Investment Market at the end of February 2006 under the symbol BLM. In May 2006, the company released an AGM statement which described its strategy as &quot;becoming a financial services business concentrating on those specialist areas of the market where we have the skills and track record to obtain an operational multiple on the valuation of our shares.&quot; The company was acquired by Oryx International Growth Fund in July 2006.

==Young Scientist==
Sarah Flannery won the European Young Scientist of the Year award for her presentation of the Cayley–Purser algorithm, which was based on work she performed with Baltimore researchers during a short internship with the company. The algorithm is named after Flannery and Baltimore founder, Michael Purser.

==Media coverage==
Fran Rooney was the subject of considerable media interest both in Europe and the US and was the subject of an RTÉ documentary in the &quot;Raging Bulls&quot; series, first broadcast on October 17, 2006.

<text>Kaitangata is a town near the coast of South Otago, New Zealand, on the left bank of the Matau Branch of the Clutha River ten kilometres south east of Balclutha. The town is known to its residents as &quot;Kai&quot;.

In June 2016, the town gained international attention when new low cost housing was offered there, and local mayor of Clutha District, Bryan Cadogan, estimated there were 100-1000 job vacancies in the region; the news was carried by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and TVNZ&#x27;s &quot;Seven Sharp&quot;.

==Location==
The town sits close to the coast on one of the branches of the Clutha River&#x27;s delta. The small island of Inch Clutha lies immediately to the southwest of the town. Close to the town to the north lies the small Lake Tuakitoto, which drains into the Clutha via a small stream which runs to the west of Kaitangata.

==Demographics==
In 1863 there were only 29 eligible voters in the wider district, which included Inch Clutha and Matau. By 1865 the population for the wider area was given as 403 males and 253 females – a total of 656. Considerable expansion took place with the arrival of rail and the local population sought to have the town proclaimed a Municipality in July 1878. Kaitangata was within Bruce County at the time.

Kaitangata is described by Statistics New Zealand as a rural settlement. It covers , and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. It is part of the larger Kaitangata-Matau statistical area.

Kaitangata had a population of 753 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 3 people (−0.4%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 57 people (−7.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 324 households, comprising 393 males and 363 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.08 males per female, with 138 people (18.3%) aged under 15 years, 120 (15.9%) aged 15 to 29, 396 (52.6%) aged 30 to 64, and 99 (13.1%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 90.8% European/Pākehā, 17.1% Māori, 1.6% Pasifika, 1.6% Asian, and 0.4% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 67.7% had no religion, 21.9% were Christian, 0.8% had Māori religious beliefs and 0.8% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 21 (3.4%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 237 (38.5%) people had no formal qualifications. 45 people (7.3%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 327 (53.2%) people were employed full-time, 75 (12.2%) were part-time, and 36 (5.9%) were unemployed.

===Kaitangata-Matau statistical area===
Kaitangata-Matau covers and also includes Inch Clutha and Wangaloa. It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Kaitangata-Matau had a population of 1,092 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 12 people (−1.1%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 45 people (−4.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 441 households, comprising 564 males and 528 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.07 males per female. The median age was 40.4 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 213 people (19.5%) aged under 15 years, 210 (19.2%) aged 15 to 29, 543 (49.7%) aged 30 to 64, and 126 (11.5%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 89.3% European/Pākehā, 15.1% Māori, 1.6% Pasifika, 4.4% Asian, and 0.8% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 8.5, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 65.4% had no religion, 24.2% were Christian, 0.5% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.5% were Hindu, 0.3% were Muslim, 0.3% were Buddhist and 0.5% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 48 (5.5%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 306 (34.8%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $31,000, compared with $31,800 nationally. 75 people (8.5%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 480 (54.6%) people were employed full-time, 114 (13.0%) were part-time, and 42 (4.8%) were unemployed.

==Transport==
Initially access to Kaitangata was by boat up the Clutha River. When road access was being improved at considerable expense in 1862 there was opposition in favour of a steamer service on the river. In 1862 the town was described as a port of entry with a customs house.

Road access remained problematic up until the mid-1870s due to poor construction and surface flooding. A rail link (the Kaitangata Line) to the South Island Main Trunk was constructed in 1875, primarily for moving coal. Prior to the construction of the line, the coal had been shipped down the Clutha River.

==Origins==

===Name===
The origin of the town&#x27;s Māori name remains uncertain. It is the name of a figure in Māori mythology, but could also refer to cannibal feasts held after tribal fighting between the Kāi Tahu and the Kāti Māmoe &quot;iwi&quot; in the district. One can translate the name from Māori to English as &quot;food&quot; (&quot;kai&quot;) for &quot;people&quot; (&quot;tangata&quot;) or as &quot;people for food&quot;. After the mining disaster in 1879 a local newspaper pointed out the meaning of the name and its appropriateness in the circumstances.

According to the “Te Aka Māori Dictionary” site, the word kaitangata refers to both cannibalism and the cat&#x27;s eye snail (&quot;Turbo smaragdus&quot;), a species of marine snail.

===European settlement===
In preparation for organised European settlement, in 1847 a party that consisted of Joseph Thomas, R J Harrison, and Charles Henry Kettle surveyed the area of land known as the Otago Block, lying between the Clutha and the Tokomairaro Rivers. The surveyors identified the present location of Kaitangata as suitable for a village on their map. When Europeans settled in the area through the early 1850s, sheep- and dairy-farming started. The town&#x27;s first settler, in 1855, was John Lovell.

Frederick Tuckett had discovered coal in the nearby area in 1844 at Coal Point, but access meant that mining did not commence until the late 1850s. At Kaitangata mining began in 1862, just after the township commenced with the sale of its first 40 sections on 28 February 1862. In August 1862, 25 sections were sold in the township for an average of £14 per section. The Presbyterian Church acquired a site for a church in late 1862. Mr James Kirkland was the first Minister appointed on 10 September 1863. The town by 1862 had a customs house, a police station, and stores. A resident magistrate. Andrew Chapman, was the first Post Master, appointed on 15 September 1863. Chapman was later adjudged bankrupt because he was not a competent businessman, and a new Post Master was appointed on 1 February 1865.

A primary school was established in 1866 and its roll reached 50 pupils in April 1873. Flax mills opened in early 1870. In November 1870 a Volunteer Unit, part of the No 1 Clutha Rifles, formed. A saw mill had been established sometime before 1872. In 1873 a town library commenced operations. Cheese manufacturing started. A minor property boom occurred in 1875–1876 with the arrival of rail in the town, with sections selling anywhere up to £100 by June 1876. The telegraph arrived some time in 1877 and a new Presbyterian Church opened in October that year.

==Clubs and societies==
A cricket club was formed by January 1864. The Ancient Order of Oddfellows was established in September 1865. A Temperance Society was set up in 1871. By 1877 there was a football club.

==Coal mining==
An initial report on coal in the nearby area at Coal Point was carried out by J. G. Lewis in 1859. This was followed by Dr Hector&#x27;s survey of the coal fields from 1862 to 1864 and his report was published in June 1864. In it he identified the area around Kaitangata as being suitable of coal extraction. William Aitchinson had already begun extracting coal near Kaitangata in 1862. In 1871 he leased his mine to John Thompson of Balclutha. He installed a wooden tramway from the mine to the Matau River.

===Underground===
Coal mining was the mainstay of the town&#x27;s economy from the 1870s until 1972, when the last state-owned underground coal mine closed. In addition to the earlier mentioned Thompson mine, MacFarlane and Martin opened a new mine in March 1872, with Dunedin merchants Messrs Findlay and Chapstick being added as additional owners a month later. Their mine was referred to as the No 1 Coal Company mine. In September Thompson and Aitchenson reached agreement to raise capital to expand their mining operation by way of a new company, the Kaitangata Coal Mining Company. The company made a rail link to the South Island Main Trunk at Stirling in 1875.

In September 1873 ownership of the No 1 Coal Company Mine passed to a Mr McLaren. Later the same year Messrs Findlay and Watson opened their mine. The underground mines produced sub-bituminous coal of a high quality, which was used primarily as fuel for the steam locomotives, in use in NZ until the 1960s. When the railways switched to diesel locomotives the decline of underground mining occurred.

====Industrial action====
In 1873 miners at the Kaitangata Coal Mining Company struck for higher wages. Their claims were unsuccessful and work resumed after about a month.

====Mining accidents====
In either late 1873 or early 1874 the No 1 Company&#x27;s mine caught fire. By July 1874 the fire had broken out of the mine and attempts to put out the fire were unsuccessful.
One of New Zealand&#x27;s early industrial disasters occurred at the Kaitangata mine at 8am on 21 February 1879, when the lives of 34 miners were lost in an underground explosion. On the day of the explosion 47 men were employed at the mine. The cause of the explosion is believed to have been a methane gas build up that was ignited when the mine managers brother entered a disused area of the mine with a lit candle. The Coroners Court verdict found negligence on behalf of the mine manager and his brother, together with the lack of legislation as the contributing factors in the disaster.

===Open cast===

Several open-cast mines have continued to exist (both state and private) up to the present day, such as the Kai Point Mine. The Kai Point Coal Company, founded by George Cross, has been mining coal at Kaitangata since 1951 and produces coal for local industry and domestic heating. It was producing 55,000 tons of coal per annum. The remaining open-cast mine produces lignite, which is primarily used in household fires and industrial boilers.

===Railway===

In 1873 local residents petitioned the Provincial Government to construct a Branch Line from the South Island Main Trunk to Ropers Creek near Kaitangata to enable coal to be easily transported from the mines. In 1874 the Provincial Government applied for consent to raise a £27,750 loan to construct the Branch line with an extension as far as Coal Point. This was unsuccessful and as a result the Kaitangata Coal Company began to investigate constructing its own line.

A railway construction company, the Kaitangata Railway Company was formed and Government consent sought to construct the line. After the Railway Company was formed it amalgamated with the Coal Company, forming the Kaitangata Mining and Railway Company. Construction of a railway line from Kaitangata to the South Island Main line at Stirling was commenced 1875 and was completed on 31 March 1876. It was a private branch line serving the township and the mines. Eventually the line later came into the state Mines Department&#x27;s possession. It was closed in 1970.

The locomotive that operated the line for many years, known during operation as an &quot;Improved F&quot;, was donated to the preservation society at Shantytown in Westland and it operates heritage trains today with the nameplate &quot;Kaitangata&quot; in honour of its former home.

==Crime==
In April 1877 several local stores were set alight by an arsonist, although only one was destroyed. A £250 reward was offered for locating and prosecuting the offender. The culprit was never found.

In 2010 and 2013 the town has gained some notoriety due to several high-profile crimes connected with the town, notably cases of arson.

==Environment==

===Introduced species===
Black swans and pheasants were introduced into the area in the 1860s by the Acclimatisation Society. Trout were introduced into the Matau River in the 1870s.

===Tsunami===
At 10am on 11 May 1877 a seismic sea wave from the 1877 Iquique earthquake caused an 18 inch high wave up the Clutha River past Kaitangata, with the river eventually rising to four feet above its former height. This repeated hourly for most of that day.

===Drainage and flooding===
In 1877 workers began to drain the lakes at Kaitangata. The community hoped that by draining the lakes a source of flooding which plagued the area would be removed.

At the end of September 1878 the whole township was severely flooded, there were no deaths but considerable damage was done to the township. The road to Granton was washed away and the railway bridges piles were undermined.

==Recent developments==

A local promotions society (formed from the former ratepayers&#x27; association) has improved this image somewhat and has been responsible for numerous civic projects in and around the town. In 2010 a museum focusing on the coal mining industry was opened.

=== Kaitangata promotions house and land package ===

In May 2016 Kaitangata Promotions began offering a house and land package in Kaitangata for $230,000. In June this story was picked up by other New Zealand media, and then following a story in &quot;The Guardian&quot; became a worldwide media phenomenon. As an indication of the level of interest, By the end of June daily pageviews for &quot;Kaitangata, New Zealand&quot; on Wikipedia were exceeding those for world cities like Sydney and Los Angeles.
The mayor of Clutha district, Bryan Cadogan, said that &quot;more than 10,000 people&quot; had expressed interest in coming to live in Kaitangata.

==== Media misinformation ====

At the beginning of July 2016 some media outlets including the San Francisco Chronicle online edition SFGate began falsely reporting that Clutha District Council was actually giving away houses or money to the value of US$160,000 to potential residents.

==== Rules for buyers in scheme ====

On 5 July property sales for the house and land package were temporarily suspended.
The incredible response to the scheme at one point saw more interest in Kaitangata than perhaps any other place in the world, and the real estate agent responsible had received more than 9000 emails regarding it. Accordingly, the promotions group wanted to ensure that it was genuine settlers which were buying the sections and not just speculators.
To achieve this:

<doc id="741847" wikidata="Q605259" url="?curid=741847" title="Hyperkalemia">
<text>Hyperkalemia is an elevated level of potassium (K+) in the blood. Normal potassium levels are between 3.5 and 5.0mmol/L (3.5 and 5.0mEq/L) with levels above 5.5mmol/L defined as hyperkalemia. Typically hyperkalemia does not cause symptoms. Occasionally when severe it can cause palpitations, muscle pain, muscle weakness, or numbness. Hyperkalemia can cause an abnormal heart rhythm which can result in cardiac arrest and death.
Common causes of hyperkalemia include kidney failure, hypoaldosteronism, and rhabdomyolysis. A number of medications can also cause high blood potassium including mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone and finerenone) NSAIDs, potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., amiloride), angiotensin receptor blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The severity is divided into mild (5.5 – 5.9mmol/L), moderate (6.0 – 6.5 mmol/L), and severe (&gt; 6.5mmol/L). High levels can be detected on an electrocardiogram (ECG), though the absence of ECG changes does not rule out hyperkalemia. The measurement properties of ECG changes in predicting hyperkalemia are not known. Pseudohyperkalemia, due to breakdown of cells during or after taking the blood sample, should be ruled out.
Initial treatment in those with ECG changes is salts, such as calcium gluconate or calcium chloride. Other medications used to rapidly reduce blood potassium levels include insulin with dextrose, salbutamol, and sodium bicarbonate. Medications that might worsen the condition should be stopped and a low potassium diet should be started. Measures to remove potassium from the body include diuretics such as furosemide, potassium-binders such as polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, and hemodialysis. Hemodialysis is the most effective method.
Hyperkalemia is rare among those who are otherwise healthy. Among those who are hospitalized, rates are between 1% and 2.5%. It is associated with an increased mortality, whether due to hyperkalaemia itself or as a marker of severe illness, especially in those without chronic kidney disease. The word &quot;hyperkalemia&quot; comes from &quot;hyper-&quot; &#x27;high&#x27; + &quot;kalium&quot; &#x27;potassium&#x27; + &quot;-emia&quot; &#x27;blood condition&#x27;.

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of an elevated potassium level are generally few and nonspecific. Nonspecific symptoms may include feeling tired, numbness and weakness. Occasionally palpitations and shortness of breath may occur. Hyperventilation may indicate a compensatory response to metabolic acidosis, which is one of the possible causes of hyperkalemia. Often, however, the problem is detected during screening blood tests for a medical disorder, or after hospitalization for complications such as cardiac arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death. High levels of potassium (&gt; 5.5mmol/L) have been associated with cardiovascular events.

==Causes==

===Ineffective elimination===
Decreased kidney function is a major cause of hyperkalemia. This is especially pronounced in acute kidney injury where the glomerular filtration rate and tubular flow are markedly decreased, characterized by reduced urine output. This can lead to a dramatically elevated potassium in conditions of increased cell breakdown as the potassium is released from the cells and cannot be eliminated in the kidney. In chronic kidney disease, hyperkalemia occurs as a result of reduced aldosterone responsiveness and reduced sodium and water delivery in distal tubules.

Medications that interfere with urinary excretion by inhibiting the renin–angiotensin system is one of the most common causes of hyperkalemia. Examples of medications that can cause hyperkalemia include ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, non-selective beta blockers, and calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressants such as ciclosporin and tacrolimus. For potassium-sparing diuretics, such as amiloride and triamterene; both the drugs block epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) in the collecting tubules, thereby preventing potassium excretion into urine. Spironolactone acts by competitively inhibiting the action of aldosterone. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or celecoxib inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, leading to reduced production of renin and aldosterone, causing potassium retention. The antibiotic trimethoprim and the antiparasitic medication pentamidine inhibits potassium excretion, which is similar to mechanism of action by amiloride and triamterene.

Mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) deficiency or resistance can also cause hyperkalemia. Primary adrenal insufficiency are: Addison&#x27;s disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) (including enzyme deficiencies such as 21α hydroxylase, 17α hydroxylase, 11β hydroxylase, or 3β dehydrogenase).
* Type IV renal tubular acidosis (aldosterone resistance of the kidney&#x27;s tubules)
* Gordon&#x27;s syndrome (pseudohypoaldosteronism type II) (&quot;familial hypertension with hyperkalemia&quot;), a rare genetic disorder caused by defective modulators of salt transporters, including the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter.

===Excessive release from cells===
Metabolic acidosis can cause hyperkalemia as the elevated hydrogen ions in the cells can displace potassium, causing the potassium ions to leave the cell and enter the bloodstream. However, in respiratory acidosis or organic acidosis such as lactic acidosis, the effect on serum potassium are much less significant although the mechanisms are not completely understood.

Insulin deficiency can cause hyperkalemia as the hormone insulin increases the uptake of potassium into the cells. Hyperglycemia can also contribute to hyperkalemia by causing hyperosmolality in extracellular fluid, increasing water diffusion out of the cells and causes potassium to move alongside water out of the cells also. The co-existence of insulin deficiency, hyperglycemia, and hyperosmolality is often seen in those affected by diabetic ketoacidosis. Apart from diabetic ketoacidosis, there are other causes that reduce insulin levels such as the use of the medication octreotide, and fasting which can also cause hyperkalemia. Increased tissue breakdown such as rhabdomyolysis, burns, or any cause of rapid tissue necrosis, including tumor lysis syndrome can cause the release of intracellular potassium into blood, causing hyperkalemia.

Beta2-adrenergic agonists act on beta-2 receptors to drive potassium into the cells. Therefore, beta blockers can raise potassium levels by blocking beta-2 receptors. However, the rise in potassium levels is not marked unless there are other co-morbidities present. Examples of drugs that can raise the serum potassium are non-selective beta-blockers such as propranolol and labetalol. Beta-1 selective blockers such as metoprolol do not increase serum potassium levels.

Exercise can cause a release of potassium into bloodstream by increasing the number of potassium channels in the cell membrane. The degree of potassium elevation varies with the degree of exercise, which range from 0.3 meq/L in light exercise to 2 meq/L in heavy exercise, with or without accompanying ECG changes or lactic acidosis. However, peak potassium levels can be reduced by prior physical conditioning and potassium levels are usually reversed several minutes after exercise. High levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline have a protective effect on the cardiac electrophysiology because they bind to beta 2 adrenergic receptors, which, when activated, extracellularly decrease potassium concentration.

Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis is an autosomal dominant clinical condition where there is a mutation in gene located at 17q23 that regulates the production of protein SCN4A. SCN4A is an important component of sodium channels in skeletal muscles. During exercise, sodium channels normally open to allow influx of sodium into the muscle cells for depolarization to occur. But in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, sodium channels are slow to close after exercise, causing excessive influx of sodium and displacement of potassium out of the cells.

Rare causes of hyperkalemia are discussed as follows. Acute digitalis overdose such as digoxin toxicity may cause hyperkalemia through the inhibition of sodium-potassium-ATPase pump. Massive blood transfusion can cause hyperkalemia, especially in infants and patients with low glomerular filtration rate (GFR, a measure of kidney function) due to leakage of potassium out of the red blood cells during storage. Giving succinylcholine to people with conditions such as burns, trauma, infection, prolonged immobilisation can cause hyperkalemia due to widespread activation of acetylcholine receptors rather than a specific group of muscles. Arginine hydrochloride is used to treat refractory metabolic alkalosis. The arginine ions can enter cells and displace potassium out of the cells, causing hyperkalemia. Calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, diazoxide, and minoxidil can cause hyperkalemia. Box jellyfish venom can also cause hyperkalemia.

===Excessive intake===
Excessive intake of potassium is not a primary cause of hyperkalemia because in the presence of normal kidney function, and the absence of drugs causing alterations in homeostasis, the kidney responds to the rise in the potassium levels by increasing the excretion of potassium into urine. This is mediated by aldosterone hormone secretion and increasing the number of potassium secreting channels in kidney tubules. Acute hyperkalemia in infants is also rare even though their body volume is small, with accidental ingestion of potassium salts or potassium medications. Hyperkalemia usually develops when there are other co-morbidities such as hypoaldosteronism and chronic kidney disease.

===Pseudohyperkalemia===
Pseudohyperkalemia occurs when the measured potassium level is falsely elevated. Mechanical trauma during blood drawing can cause potassium leakage out of the red blood cells due to haemolysis of the blood sample. Fist clenching during the blood draw can cause a rise in potassium levels in the venous blood as it is sampled; this difference may be as much as 1 mmol/L. Differences of this order of magnitude cause problems (false positive results for clinically-important hyperkalemia) for patients with low glomerular filtration rate (GFR; a measure of kidney function), type IV renal tubular acidosis (RTA), or on evidence-based medication for cardio-renal risk (RASi, MRAs). The practice, widespread in laboratories in North America, should be discontinued. Prolonged length storage of blood samples, or agitation in transit, is also associated with red cell lysis that can increase serum potassium levels. Hyperkalemia may become apparent when a person&#x27;s platelet concentration is more than 500,000/microL in a clotted blood sample (serum blood sample). Potassium leaks out of platelets after clotting has occurred. A high white cell count (greater than 120,000/microL) in people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia increases the fragility of red blood cells, thus causing pseudohyperkalemia during blood processing. This problem can be avoided by processing serum samples, because clot formation protects the cells from haemolysis during processing. A familial form of pseudohyperkalemia, a benign condition characterised by increased serum potassium in whole blood stored at cold temperatures, also exists. This is due to increased potassium permeability in red blood cells.

==Mechanism==

=== Physiology ===
Potassium is the most abundant intracellular cation. About 98% of the body&#x27;s potassium is found inside cells, with the remainder in the extracellular fluid including the blood. Membrane potential is maintained principally by the concentration gradient and membrane permeability to potassium with some contribution from the Na+/K+ pump. The potassium gradient is critically important for many physiological processes, including maintenance of cellular membrane potential, homeostasis of cell volume, and transmission of action potentials in nerve cells.

Potassium is eliminated from the body through the gastrointestinal tract, kidney and sweat glands. In the kidneys, elimination of potassium is passive (through the glomeruli), and reabsorption is active in the proximal tubule and the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. There is active excretion of potassium in the distal tubule and the collecting duct; both are controlled by aldosterone. In sweat glands potassium elimination is quite similar to the kidney; its excretion is also controlled by aldosterone.

Regulation of serum potassium is a function of intake, appropriate distribution between intracellular and extracellular compartments, and effective bodily excretion. In healthy individuals, homeostasis is maintained when cellular uptake and kidney excretion naturally counterbalance a patient&#x27;s dietary intake of potassium. When kidney function becomes compromised, the ability of the body to effectively regulate serum potassium via the kidney declines. To compensate for this deficit in function, the colon increases its potassium secretion as part of an adaptive response. However, serum potassium remains elevated as the colonic compensating mechanism reaches its limits.

=== Elevated potassium ===
Hyperkalemia develops when there is excess production (oral intake, tissue breakdown) or ineffective elimination of potassium. Ineffective elimination can be hormonal (in aldosterone deficiency) or due to causes in the kidney that impair excretion.

Increased extracellular potassium levels result in depolarization of the membrane potentials of cells due to the increase in the equilibrium potential of potassium. This depolarization opens some voltage-gated sodium channels, but also increases the inactivation at the same time. Since depolarization due to concentration change is slow, it never generates an action potential by itself; instead, it results in accommodation. Above a certain level of potassium the depolarization inactivates sodium channels, opens potassium channels, thus the cells become refractory. This leads to the impairment of neuromuscular, cardiac, and gastrointestinal organ systems. Of most concern is the impairment of cardiac conduction, which can cause ventricular fibrillation and/or abnormally slow heart rhythms.

==Diagnosis==

To gather enough information for diagnosis, the measurement of potassium must be repeated, as the elevation can be due to hemolysis in the first sample. The normal serum level of potassium is 3.5 to 5mmol/L. Generally, blood tests for kidney function (creatinine, urea), glucose and occasionally creatine kinase and cortisol are performed. Calculating the trans-tubular potassium gradient has been recommended as a method of identifying whether or not aldosterone is acting; however, the measurement properties of this test were never described and some experts doubt the usefulness of this approach.

In the medical history the presence of known kidney disease, diabetes mellitus and the use of certain medications (e.g. potassium-sparing diuretics) are important issues. Electrocardiography (ECG) may be performed to determine if there are ECG changes, tachy- or brady-arrythmias. 

=== Definitions ===
Normal serum potassium levels are generally considered to be between 3.5 and 5.3 mmol/L. Levels above 5.5mmol/L generally indicate hyperkalemia, and those below 3.5mmol/L indicate hypokalemia.

===ECG findings===
With mild to moderate hyperkalemia, there may be prolongation of the PR interval and development of peaked T waves. The measurement properties (sensitivity and specificity) of ECG to predict laboratory hyperkalemia, or to predict more severe arrhythmia in the context of hyperkalemia, are not known Severe hyperkalemia results in a widening of the QRS complex, and the ECG complex can evolve to a sinusoidal shape. There appears to be a direct effect of elevated potassium on some of the potassium channels that increases their activity and speeds membrane repolarisation. Also, (as noted above), hyperkalemia causes an overall membrane depolarization that inactivates many sodium channels. The faster repolarisation of the cardiac action potential causes the tenting of the T waves, and the inactivation of sodium channels causes a sluggish conduction of the electrical wave around the heart, which leads to smaller P waves and widening of the QRS complex. Some of potassium currents are sensitive to extracellular potassium levels, for reasons that are not well understood. As the extracellular potassium levels increase, potassium conductance is increased so that more potassium leaves the myocyte in any given time period. To summarize, classic ECG changes associated with hyperkalemia are seen in the following progression: peaked T wave, shortened QT interval, lengthened PR interval, increased QRS duration, and eventually absence of the P wave with the QRS complex becoming a sine wave. Bradycardia, junctional rhythms and QRS widening are particularly associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes

The serum potassium concentration at which electrocardiographic changes develop is somewhat variable. Although the factors influencing the effect of serum potassium levels on cardiac electrophysiology are not entirely understood, the concentrations of other electrolytes, as well as levels of catecholamines, play a major role.

ECG findings are not a reliable finding in hyperkalemia. In a retrospective review, blinded cardiologists documented peaked T-waves in only 3 of 90 ECGs with hyperkalemia. Sensitivity of peaked-Ts for hyperkalemia ranged from 0.18 to 0.52 depending on the criteria for peak-T waves.

==Prevention==
Preventing recurrence of hyperkalemia typically involves reduction of dietary potassium, removal of an offending medication, and/or the addition of a diuretic (such as furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide). Sodium polystyrene sulfonate and sorbitol (combined as Kayexalate) are occasionally used on an ongoing basis to maintain lower serum levels of potassium though the safety of long-term use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate for this purpose is not well understood.

High dietary sources include meat, chicken, seafood, vegetables such as avocados, tomatoes and potatoes, fruits such as bananas, oranges and nuts.

==Treatment==
Emergency lowering of potassium levels is needed when new arrhythmias occur at any level of potassium in the blood, or when potassium levels exceed 6.5mmol/L. Several agents are used to temporarily lower K+ levels. The choice depends on the degree and cause of the hyperkalemia, and other aspects of the person&#x27;s condition.

===Myocardial excitability===
Calcium (calcium chloride or calcium gluconate) increases threshold potential through a mechanism that is still unclear, thus restoring normal gradient between threshold potential and resting membrane potential, which is elevated abnormally in hyperkalemia. A standard ampule of 10% calcium chloride is 10 mL and contains 6.8mmol of calcium. A standard ampule of 10% calcium gluconate is also 10 mL but has only 2.26mmol of calcium. Clinical practice guidelines recommend giving 6.8mmol for typical EKG findings of hyperkalemia. This is 10 mL of 10% calcium chloride or 30 mL of 10% calcium gluconate. Though calcium chloride is more concentrated, it is caustic to the veins and should only be given through a central line. Onset of action is less than one to three minutes and lasts about 30–60 minutes. The goal of treatment is to normalise the EKG and doses can be repeated if the EKG does not improve within a few minutes.

Some textbooks suggest that calcium should not be given in digoxin toxicity as it has been linked to cardiovascular collapse in humans and increased digoxin toxicity in animal models. Recent literature questions the validity of this concern.

===Temporary measures===
Several medical treatments shift potassium ions from the bloodstream into the cellular compartment, thereby reducing the risk of complications. The effect of these measures tends to be short-lived, but may temporise the problem until potassium can be removed from the body.
* Insulin (e.g. intravenous injection of 10 units of regular insulin along with 50 mL of 50% dextrose to prevent the blood sugar from dropping too low) leads to a shift of potassium ions into cells, secondary to increased activity of the sodium-potassium ATPase. Its effects last a few hours, so it sometimes must be repeated while other measures are taken to suppress potassium levels more permanently. The insulin is usually given with an appropriate amount of glucose to help prevent hypoglycemia following the insulin administration, though hypoglycaemia remains common especially in the context of acute or chronic renal impairment and capillary blood glucose measurements should be taken regularly after administration to identify this.
* Salbutamol (albuterol), a β2-selective catecholamine, is administered by nebuliser (e.g. 10–20mg). This medication also lowers blood levels of K+ by promoting its movement into cells, and will work within 30 minutes. It is recommended to use 20 mg for maximum potassium lowering effect, but to use lower doses if the patient is tachycardic or has ischaemic heart disease. Note that 12-40% of patients do not respond to salbutamol therapy for reasons unknown, especially if on beta-blockers, so it should not be used as monotherapy
* Sodium bicarbonate may be used with the above measures if it is believed the person has metabolic acidosis, though time to effectiveness is longer and its use is controversial.

===Elimination===
Severe cases require hemodialysis, which are the most rapid methods of removing potassium from the body. These are typically used if the underlying cause cannot be corrected swiftly while temporising measures are instituted or there is no response to these measures.

Loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide, torasemide) and thiazide diuretics (e.g., chlortalidone, hydrochlorothiazide, or chlorothiazide) can increase kidney potassium excretion in people with intact kidney function.

Potassium can bind to a number of agents in the gastrointestinal tract. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) was approved for this use decades ago, and can be given by mouth or rectally. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate given with sorbitol was uncommonly but convincingly associated with colonic necrosis; this combination is no longer used. 

Patiromer is taken by mouth and works by binding free potassium ions in the gastrointestinal tract and releasing calcium ions for exchange, thus lowering the amount of potassium available for absorption into the bloodstream and increasing the amount lost via the feces. The net effect is a reduction of potassium levels in the blood serum.

Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is a medication that binds potassium in the gastrointestinal tract in exchange for sodium and hydrogen ions. Onset of effects occurs in one to six hours. It is taken by mouth.

==Epidemiology==
Hyperkalemia is rare among those who are otherwise healthy. Among those who are in hospital, rates are between 1% and 2.5%.

==Society and culture==
In the United States, hyperkalemia is induced by lethal injection in people condemned to death by the state. Potassium chloride is the last of the three drugs administered and actually causes death.

<doc id="741849" wikidata="Q6872418" url="?curid=741849" title="Miracle Legion">
<text>Miracle Legion was an American college rock band formed in 1983 in New Haven, Connecticut. They earned modest renown, especially in their native New England region, but also in the UK, where they were feted by music media such as &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;.

==1983–88==
The original lineup consisted of singer/guitarist Mark Mulcahy, lead guitarist Ray Neal, drummer Jeff Wiederschall, and bassist Joel Potocsky. In their early stages they received frequent comparisons to R.E.M., more for their presence and overall sound than for their lyrical content. Other than a few similar-sounding songs, the respective bands&#x27; sounds were largely dissimilar lyrically and musically, and as time passed, the comparisons became less valid. 
Their first EP, &quot;The Backyard&quot;, was financed by Brad Morrison and released on the Bridgeport, Connecticut co-op label Incas Records in 1984 and became a college radio hit. Their first full-length album, &quot;Surprise Surprise Surprise&quot;, was released in 1987 on Rough Trade Records, by which time Potocsky had been replaced by bassist Steven West. In 1988, &quot;Glad&quot; came out, consisting of new songs and live tracks (which included a guest appearance by Pere Ubu). The same year, Miracle Legion&#x27;s rhythm section departed, leaving only Mulcahy and Neal in the band.

==1989–92==
With the departure of drummer Wiederschall and bassist West in 1988, Mulcahy and Neal continued Miracle Legion as a duo, touring as the opening act for The Sugarcubes. Their 1989 release of &quot;Me and Mr. Ray&quot;, recorded at Prince&#x27;s Paisley Park Studios, reflected the band&#x27;s new direction with its stripped-down instrumentation. The album yielded a single, &quot;You&#x27;re the One Lee&quot;, the video for which received modest rotation on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot; alternative music show. That year, the band found a new rhythm section, drummer Scott Boutier and bassist Dave McCaffrey, and signed with the now-defunct label Morgan Creek Records, which funded their 1992 album &quot;Drenched&quot; produced by John Porter (of Roxy Music and The Smiths fame). The band had a limited national tour that year in support of the new album, mostly playing clubs and other small venues. The song &quot;So Good&quot; off of &quot;Drenched&quot; was featured in the 1993 film &quot;The Crush&quot;.

==1993–96==
After &quot;Drenched&quot;, legal problems with the label left the band and its name in limbo. Interest continued, however, most notably in the form of a Nickelodeon offer for the band to write music for the television show &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;, which was created by Miracle Legion fans Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi. Neal, disillusioned with the label experience, declined the offer; but Mulcahy accepted. He decided to do the project with Boutier and McCaffery under the name Polaris, a project which lasted three years. Their track &quot;Hey Sandy&quot; became the show&#x27;s theme song, and the band themselves appeared in at least one episode (Season 1, &quot;Hard Day&#x27;s Pete&quot;). In 1996, after the legal issues associated with their run with Morgan Creek were resolved, the band put out their final release to date &quot;Portrait of a Damaged Family&quot; on Mulcahy&#x27;s own Mezzotint Records label.

==Post-breakup==
Since the final Miracle Legion album, Mulcahy has released five solo albums and engaged in various other projects including film soundtrack work and a musical. Neal began playing shows again in the Northeast, both solo and with Jellyshirts. Boutier and McCaffrey have been staple members of Frank Black and the Catholics. Wiederschall has maintained an active music career, playing for The Streams, Peacock Flounders, and Baby Huey, as well as contributing to Mulcahy&#x27;s 2001 solo album, &quot;SmileSunset&quot;.

In 2009, &quot;Ciao My Shining Star: The Songs of Mark Mulcahy&quot; was released as a tribute to Mulcahy&#x27;s deceased wife and featured various artists covering Miracle Legion songs, as well as songs from Polaris and Mulcahy&#x27;s solo career.

==Reunion==
The band reunited in the summer of 2016, touring the Northeast and Midwestern U.S. as well as the UK in support of the reissue of &quot;Portrait of a Damaged Family&quot;. The tour continued until the spring of 2017, during which the band released a live album, &quot;Annulment&quot;.

In 2024, the band had a short tour mostly around New England, with six dates total. 

==Musical style==
Miracle Legion has been called a &quot;jangly guitar pop band&quot; and &quot;a fixture of the 1980s college rock scene&quot;. Frontman Mark Mulcahy&#x27;s vocals have been compared to those of R.E.M.&#x27;s Michael Stipe, and the band&#x27;s execution of arpeggios has been compared to Peter Buck, also of R.E.M.

<doc id="741850" wikidata="Q7916170" url="?curid=741850" title="List of British and Irish varsity matches">
<text>A varsity match is a fixture (especially of a sporting event or team) between two university teams. The Scottish Varsity rugby match between the University of St Andrews and the University of Edinburgh at Murrayfield stadium is claimed to be the oldest recurring varsity match in the world, having been played since the 1860s. It is predated by the University Match in Cricket between Oxford and Cambridge, which was first played in 1827.

==Varsity in England==
The country&#x27;s longest-running series of varsity matches is played between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge. In addition to the 1827 University Match in Cricket mentioned above, the first &quot;Boat Race&quot; in 1829 the first &quot;Varsity Match&quot; (in Rugby Union) in 1872, and the first &quot;Varsity Game&quot; (in Basketball) in 1921 were all contested between Oxford and Cambridge. Unusually for British university sporting events, both the Boat Race and Varsity Match are shown on broadcast television. Unlike many more recent varsity competitions, the Oxford–Cambridge matches stand alone rather than being part of a wider multi-sport varsity competition.

British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; proposed in 2008 that Bath vs Loughborough was &quot;the real varsity match&quot; on the basis that these were the top two teams (at that time) in British Universities Sports Association (BUSA) competitions. Since 2015, British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS), the successor to BUSA, has organised fixtures between Loughborough and Durham (two of the top universities since 2011-12) to occur on the same day, in what has been termed the &quot;BUCS Varsity&quot;.

A number of city and regional sporting rivalries exist between universities, which are also dubbed varsity matches. The Roses Tournament between the universities of York and Lancaster is one of the oldest and largest of these, dating back to 1965. It is frequently referred to as the largest inter-university sports tournament in Europe.

<text>Rough Trade Records is an independent record label based in London, England. It was formed in 1976 by Geoff Travis who had opened a record store off Ladbroke Grove. It is currently run by co-managing directors Travis and Jeannette Lee and is affiliated to Beggars Group. 

Having successfully promoted and sold records by punk rock and early post-punk and indie pop bands such as the Normal and Desperate Bicycles, Travis began to manage acts and distribute bands such as Scritti Politti and began the label, which was informed by left-wing politics and structured as a co-operative. Label activities began in 1978. Soon after, Rough Trade also set up a distribution arm that serviced independent retail outlets across Britain, a network that became known as the Cartel. In 1983, Rough Trade signed the Smiths.

Interest and investment of major labels in the UK indie scene in the late 1980s, as well as overtrading on behalf of Rough Trade&#x27;s distribution wing, led to cash flow problems, and eventually to bankruptcy, forcing the label into receivership. 

However, Travis resurrected the label in the late 1990s partnering with Lee, finding success with the Libertines, the Strokes, Anohni and the Johnsons and more. The roster is diverse, with Pulp, Sleaford Mods, Dean Blunt, black midi, Special Interest, Jockstrap and Lankum among those signed to the label, which has ranged stylistically through alternative rock, post-punk and new wave, garage rock, and psychedelic rock, but also art pop, folk, electronic, and soul.

==History==
Rough Trade began as a record shop, opened by Geoff Travis on Kensington Park Road, West London, in February 1976, with Travis reportedly taking the shop name from the Canadian art punk/new wave band Rough Trade. It was inspired by what Travis has described as the &quot;community-based environment&quot; of the City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco, and specialised in garage rock and reggae. Steve Montgomery, initially a customer of the shop, was offered a job soon after it opened and became its effective co-manager. Travis and Montgomery were joined by a further employee, Richard Scott, in June 1977. 

Rough Trade produced its own record for the first time after French punk band Métal Urbain came into the shop asking for assistance in publicising their music.

The Rough Trade label subsequently issued a single by Jamaican reggae musician Augustus Pablo, the debut EP by Sheffield band Cabaret Voltaire and the second Stiff Little Fingers single, &quot;Alternative Ulster&quot;. During 1978, the label released singles by the Monochrome Set, Subway Sect, Swell Maps, Electric Eels, Spizzoil and Kleenex. In 1979, Rough Trade&#x27;s first album, &quot;Inflammable Material&quot; by Stiff Little Fingers, reached number 14 in the UK charts and became the first independently released album to sell over 100,000 copies in the UK. Rough Trade&#x27;s significance by this time was such that it was made the subject of a South Bank Show documentary. By the mid-1980s the label sought partnerships with bands from multiple genres, stating that &quot;Hardcore, Dance, Reggae, Experimental &amp; undefinable are all welcome.&quot;

Rough Trade Records was relaunched in 2000 as an independently owned entity, a partnership between Travis, Jeannette Lee (a former member of Public Image Ltd.), and minority partners Sanctuary Records, as a part of the Zomba Group until 11 June 2002 when BMG bought out this business. Prior to the BMG buyout, Rough Trade Records released the Strokes&#x27; debut EP The Modern Age in the spring of 2001. In July 2007 Sanctuary Records then sold its stake in Rough Trade to the Beggars Group for £800,000 making Rough Trade independent once again. However, it can be argued that Rough Trade is not truly independent as it is owned by another company. Rough Trade is more accurately a subsidiary that is owed by Beggars Group, which in turn is a privately held company not publicly traded on the stock market. Throughout this period, and continuing under Beggars, the label has been co-managed by Lee and Travis.

<doc id="741856" wikidata="Q3442941" url="?curid=741856" title="Rotary variable differential transformer">
<text>A rotary variable differential transformer (RVDT) is a type of electrical transformer used for measuring angular displacement. The transformer has a rotor which can be turned by an external force. The transformer acts as an electromechanical transducer that outputs an alternating current (AC) voltage proportional to the angular displacement of its rotor shaft.

In operation, an alternating current (AC) voltage is applied to the transformer primary to energize the RVDT. When energized with a constant AC voltage, the transfer function (output voltage vs. shaft angular displacement) of any particular RVDT is linear (to within a specified tolerance) over a specified range of angular displacement.

RVDTs employ contactless, electromagnetic coupling, which provides long life and reliable, repeatable position sensing with high resolution, even under extreme operating conditions. Most RVDTs consist of a wound, laminated stator and a salient two-pole rotor. The stator, containing four slots, contains both the primary winding and the two secondary windings, which may be connected together in some cases. RVDTs offer advantages such as sturdiness, relatively low cost, small size, and low sensitivity to temperature, primary voltage and frequency variations.

==Operation==
The two induced voltages of the secondary windings, formula_1 and formula_2, vary linearly with the mechanical angle of the rotor, θ:

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the gain or sensitivity. The second voltage can be determined by:

:formula_5

The difference formula_6 gives a proportional voltage:

:formula_7

and the sum of the voltages is a constant:

:formula_8

Consequently, the angular information output by a RVDT is independent of the input voltage, frequency and temperature.

Putting the above mathematical equations in some theoretical form, the working of RVDT can be explained as below.

Basic RVDT construction and operation is provided by rotating an iron-core bearing supported within a housed stator assembly. The housing is passivated stainless steel. The stator consists of a primary excitation coil and a pair of secondary output coils.

A fixed alternating current excitation is applied to the primary stator coil that is electromagnetically coupled to the secondary coils. This coupling is proportional to the angle of the input shaft. The output pair is structured so that one coil is in-phase with the excitation coil, and the second is 180° out-of-phase with the excitation coil.

When the rotor is in a position that directs the available flux equally in both the in-phase and out-of-phase coils, the output voltages cancel and result in a zero value signal. This is referred to as the electrical zero position or E.Z. When the rotor shaft is displaced from E.Z., the resulting output signals have a magnitude and phase relationship proportional to the direction of rotation.

Because RVDTs perform essentially like a transformer, excitation voltages changes will cause directly proportional changes to the output (transformation ratio). However, the voltage out to excitation voltage ratio will remain constant. Since most RVDT signal conditioning systems measure signal as a function of the transformation ratio (TR), excitation voltage drift beyond 7.5% typically has no effect on sensor accuracy and strict voltage regulation is not typically necessary. Excitation frequency should be controlled within ±1% to maintain accuracy.

Although the RVDT can theoretically operate between ±45°, accuracy decreases quickly after ±35°. Thus, its operational limits lie mostly within ±30°, but some up to ±40°. Certain types can operate up to ±60°.

==Varieties==

An RVDT can also be designed with two laminations, one containing the primary and the other, the secondaries. These types can operate on larger rotations.

A similar transformer is called the Rotary Variable Transformer and contains only one secondary winding giving only one voltage:

<text>De gustibus non est disputandum, or de gustibus non disputandum est, is a Latin maxim meaning &quot;In matters of taste, there can be no disputes&quot; (literally &quot;about tastes, it is not to be disputed&quot;). The phrase is commonly rendered in English as &quot;There is no accounting for tastes&quot; or &quot;for taste&quot;.

== Origin ==
One known use of the phrase is in a legal text of 1628: &quot;Repetitio legis Imperialem de prohibita feudi alienat. per Fridericum: cum summariis &amp; indice locupletissimo&quot;, by Horatius Montanus (Naples, Secondino Roncagliolo, 1628).

The author gives the example of a vassal&#x27;s duty to his lord, and considers whether the vassal discharges his duty if he disobeys his lord&#x27;s instructions (to purchase a particular house), but instead buys another house of much greater value for the same price. He concludes that you cannot legally argue whether the vassal has discharged his duty until you know the Lord&#x27;s attitude to the decision—because no legal argument can be made about what people may prefer.

&quot;Mando tibi, ut emas mihi domum Seianam centum; &amp; tu Titianam maioris valoris emis minori pretio centum; affectio mandantis est incerta re, quia de gustibus non est disputandum; merito non valet actus, &amp; præfertur voluntas interesse nummario; quod ego non negabo; dico tamen, quòd dum Dominus assentit vassallo, ut vendat; principaliter eius intentius est, prodesse vasallo; nisi aliud appareat ex circumstantiis concurrentibus; &amp; tunc ubi aliud non appareat, potest actus explicari à vassalo alio modo, quo fuit permissus; ut bene probatur ex d. §. sed si permiserit: at ubi ex circumstantiis constat,assensisse ad certum finem, &amp; causam; tunc, nisi fiat eo modo, quo Dominus vult, assensus nil præstat: quia repugnat voluntati assentientis.&quot;

The phrase is misquoted in Act I of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s play &quot;The Seagull&quot;. The character Shamrayev conflates it with the phrase &quot;de mortuis nil nisi bonum&quot; (in the alternative form: &quot;de mortuis, aut bene aut nihil&quot;: &quot;of the dead, either [speak] good or [say] nothing&quot;), resulting in &quot;de gustibus aut bene, aut nihil&quot;, &quot;Let nothing be said of taste but what is good.&quot;

<text>C&amp;C Group plc (known prior to its flotation as Cantrell &amp; Cochrane Limited) is an Irish manufacturer, marketer and distributor of alcoholic drinks, particularly cider, and soft drinks. It has production facilities across Ireland, Great Britain and the United States, and its products are sold around the world. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.

==History==
===Early history===
The company was founded by Dr Thomas Cantrell, who opened a shop in Belfast in 1852 selling soft drinks. He went into partnership with Alderman Henry Cochrane in Dublin in 1868, thereafter trading as Cantrell &amp; Cochrane Limited. Cochrane was appointed a baronet in 1903. For several decades, its main Dublin factory was based at Nassau Place, between Kildare Street and South Frederick Street.

A particularly famous product in Ireland is C&amp;C Club Orange, a carbonated orange soft drink developed in the 1930s. Other flavours were subsequently developed, such as Club Lemon and Club Rock Shandy (an orange and lemon blend). With C&amp;C&#x27;s increasing emphasis on alcoholic beverages, the Club range of soft drinks and bottled water was sold to Britvic Ireland in 2007.

In 1937, William Magner in Clonmel acquired the rights to produce the Bulmer&#x27;s Cider brand in the Republic of Ireland from H. P. Bulmer. C&amp;C introduced Magners cider in 1999, as it only held rights to Bulmers in the Republic of Ireland and wanted to expand into the United Kingdom.

===C&amp;C Television Corporation===
In America the company saw a chance to challenge soft-drink giants Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola with its own C&amp;C Cola. An elaborate marketing scheme was launched in 1955, in connection with the television revival of theatrical motion pictures produced by RKO Radio Pictures. In December 1955 film executive Matty Fox arranged the $15,200,000 purchase of the RKO film backlog from studio owner General Teleradio. C&amp;C paid $12,200,000 immediately, with the remaining $3,000,000 to be paid within three years. C&amp;C&#x27;s broadcast activity became C&amp;C Television Corporation, with Fox as president and Erwin H. Ezzes as vice president and general sales manager; Fox and Ezzes had been executives at Motion Pictures for Television, a major syndicator of the early 1950s. Fox invited 250 TV-station managers to Atlantic City, New Jersey, at his expense, to be his guests at a giant tradeshow. At this sales convention, Fox formally announced the availability of the C&amp;C film library, and invited station representatives to sign contracts for their local markets.
C&amp;C Television reprinted the entire RKO library dating back to 1929, comprising 740 feature films and 924 short subjects, for nationwide syndication in the United States. All of the features now began with a &quot;C&amp;C Movietime&quot; title card, and TV stations showing the films would interrupt the telecasts for commercial mentions of C&amp;C Cola. Although the broadcast rights to the RKO library now belong to WarnerMedia, licenses to the C&amp;C prints were granted in perpetuity. Stations that bought 16mm prints of the C&amp;C films in the 1950s continue to show them today.

===2000s===
The company changed its name to C&amp;C Group and then launched itself on the Irish Stock Exchange in 2004.

Introduced in 2003, the Oliver &amp; Greg&#x27;s flagship range was launched &quot;to provide a quality drinking experience without pretentiousness or complicated wine language.&quot; The company started selling Magner&#x27;s Irish Cider, which is their Bulmer&#x27;s Irish Cider rebranded initially for the United Kingdom market, in Northern Ireland, then in London, and then in the rest of Great Britain, Spain and Bavaria. Sales exploded in 2005 and 2006, and the company had to bring forward expansion plans to meet forecast demand. H. P. Bulmer, seeing their market share in the U.K. decline, relaunched their Bulmer&#x27;s cider in packaging similar to Magner&#x27;s and sold it to be served over ice, a concept introduced by C&amp;C. As a result of better distribution and better pricing, H.P. Bulmer regained some lost ground.

C&amp;C acquired the Tennent&#x27;s lager brand and Wellpark Brewery in August 2009 from InBev. Tennent&#x27;s is the largest lager brand in Scotland. Tennent&#x27;s also has a large share of the lager market in Ulster (chiefly in Northern Ireland and County Donegal) in the north of Ireland, and it was intended this would strengthen the position of Magner&#x27;s, as Tennent&#x27;s and Magner&#x27;s would share distribution. As part of the acquisition, C&amp;C will also exclusively distribute InBev brands on the island of Ireland, with the exception of Budweiser, which has been distributed historically by Diageo.

In 2009, Magner&#x27;s had about 12% of the U.K. cider market. C&amp;C cut production and laid off staff at Annerville, just outside Clonmel, in 2009 due to overcapacity. In late 2009, C&amp;C bought the Gaymer Cider Company, giving them a large production facility in Somerset and a distribution warehouse in Bristol.

=== 2010s ===
C&amp;C sold its portfolio of spirits brands in May 2010. The largest of these was Tullamore Dew, the world&#x27;s second largest selling Irish whiskey after Jameson, Other brands are Carolans Irish Cream, Irish Mist and Frangelico, which are exported to over 80 international markets. In April 2010, C&amp;C announced it was selling its Spirits &amp; Liqueurs division to Scottish distillers William Grant &amp; Sons for €300m. This would be used to pay down debt built up from the Tennent&#x27;s and Gaymer&#x27;s purchases. The division&#x27;s 57 staff, it was announced, would transfer with the business on disposal. It was also revealed that William Grant, whose brands include Glenfiddich Scotch Whisky and Hendrick&#x27;s Gin, would operate the division&#x27;s packaging facility located at the group&#x27;s manufacturing site in Annerville, on the outskirts of Clonmel, County Tipperary.

In October 2012, C&amp;C bought the largest cider maker in the U.S., Vermont Hard Cider, for $305 million.

C&amp;C purchased the majority of the Gleeson Group in November 2012, extending its distribution reach and returning it to the soft drinks and bottled water markets, which it had previously exited in 2007. They did not purchase the Gleeson Groups cider or liqueur businesses.

In December 2015, C&amp;C announced that Pabst Brewing Company would be taking over distribution of its cider brands in the U.S.. Pabst Brewing Company also gained the option to acquire C&amp;C&#x27;s two U.S. cider brands, Woodchuck and Vermont. In January 2016, further retrenchment was announced with the closure announced of the company&#x27;s Shepton Mallet factory. The factory was sold to Brothers Drinks Co. in October and some C&amp;C brands will continue to be produced there. In April 2021, C&amp;C sold Vermont Cider Company to Vermont-based Northeast Drinks Group.

On 4 April 2018, C&amp;C announced the acquisition of Matthew Clark and Bibendum PLB, the wholesaling arm of the troubled Conviviality, which five days earlier had announced its intention to enter administration. The acquisition was supported by AB-InBev, and was for a nominal sum, with C&amp;C and AB-InBev injecting capital to fund the rescued business to working capital resources of £102 million.

Due to an increased volume of UK based shareholders, C&amp;Cs stock market listing moved entirely to the London Stock Exchange in October 2019, delisting entirely from the Euronext Dublin (formerly the Irish Stock Exchange) bourse, and changing the quotation currency to GBP (pound sterling).

=== 2020s ===
On 16 January 2020, it was announced that CEO Stephen Glancey was stepping down from his position as CEO.

== Sponsorship ==
Like many alcohol companies, C&amp;C invests heavily in sports sponsorship.

== Production operations ==

Production takes place at:
*Clonmel, the home of Magner&#x27;s Irish Cider, and main cider production facility.
*Wellpark Brewery in Glasgow, the historic home of Tennent&#x27;s lager, acquired in August 2009 from InBev.
