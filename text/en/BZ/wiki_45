<text>The crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans) is a parrot native to eastern and south eastern Australia which has been introduced to New Zealand and Norfolk Island. It is commonly found in, but not restricted to, mountain forests and gardens. The species as it now stands has subsumed two former separate species, the yellow rosella and the Adelaide rosella. Molecular studies show one of the three red-coloured races, &quot;P. e. nigrescens&quot;, is genetically more distinct.

==Taxonomy==


The crimson rosella was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the parrots in the genus &quot;Psittacus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Psittacus elegans&quot;. This Latin name had been used in 1605 by the Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius in his book &quot;Exoticorum libri decem&quot; for the hawk-headed parrot, however this predates the start of Linnean taxonomy.

The crimson rosella had been described and named by John Latham in 1781 as the &quot;Beautiful Lory&quot;, from a specimen in the collection of Sir Joseph Banks, and then as the &quot;Pennantian Parrot&quot; in 1787 in honour of Thomas Pennant. However, Latham did not give the species a binomial name until 1790, when he named it &quot;Psittacus pennantii&quot;.

Nicholas Aylward Vigors defined the genus &quot;Platycercus&quot; in 1825, based on the distinctive architecture of the feathers in the tail and wing, and designated the crimson rosella (as &quot;Platycercus pennantii&quot;) as the type species.

Most authors used Latham&#x27;s combination &quot;Platycercus pennantii&quot; until 1891, when Italian zoologist Tommaso Salvadori established that &quot;P. elegans&quot; had priority, leading to its universal adoption thereafter.

Edward Pierson Ramsay described the subspecies &quot;nigrescens&quot; in 1888, noting its darker crimson plumage, black back and nape, and smaller size yet larger bill. It was also known as &quot;northern crimson parrot&quot; or &quot;Campbell&#x27;s parakeet&quot;, after Alexander James Campbell.

In 1941, Herbert Condon proposed that the yellow and Adelaide rosellas be reclassified as subspecies of the crimson rosella.

&quot;Crimson rosella&quot; has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC); however, it was not given this name until the publication of the 1926 RAOU checklist. Before this it had been known as the crimson parrot, while the term &quot;rosella&quot; had been restricted to the eastern rosella. The name &quot;blue-cheeked rosella&quot; was proposed for the united species &quot;elegans&quot;, but was not generally taken up.

Today, the red-coloured races are generally known as the &quot;crimson rosella&quot;, with the alternate names &quot;red lowry&quot;, &quot;Pennant&#x27;s parakeet&quot;, &quot;Campbell parakeet&quot;, (&quot;blue) mountain parrot&quot;, (&quot;blue) mountain lowry&quot; or just plain &quot;lowry&quot; occasionally heard. Cayley reported that the first two alternate names were most common in the early part of the twentieth century. On Norfolk Island it is called simply &quot;red parrot&quot;.

The &quot;yellow rosella&quot;, also known by a variety of alternate common names including &quot;Murrumbidgee lowry&quot;, &quot;murray rosella&quot;, &quot;swamp lowry&quot; and &quot;yellow-rumped parakeet&quot;, was described as &quot;Platycercus flaveolus&quot; by John Gould, who gave it the last common name mentioned. It was reduced to subspecies status once hybridization was noted where ranges overlap. However, some authorities maintain the hybridization is not widespread and hence preserve its specific status. This view is in the minority.

==Description==

&quot;Platycercus elegans&quot; is a medium-sized Australian parrot at long, much of which is tail. There are seven subspecies, three of which are actually crimson. The red is replaced by yellow in the case of var. &quot;flaveolus&quot; and a mixture of red, orange and yellow in the Adelaide rosella.

Adults and juveniles generally show strikingly different colouration in south-eastern populations, with predominantly greenish-olive body plumage on the juvenile, most persistent on the nape and breast. Juveniles are said to &#x27;ripen&#x27; as they get older and turn from green to red. All races have blue cheeks and black-scalloped blue-margined wings and predominantly blue tail with predominantly red coloration. The crimson rosella&#x27;s blue tail feathers are one of the favourite decorations of the satin bowerbird. The bill is pale grey and the iris dark brown.

There is very little sexual dimorphism in crimson rosellas. The most noticeable difference between sexes is that males are up to 15% larger, and have a relatively larger and wider beak.

===Subspecies===
&quot;P. elegans elegans&quot;, the nominate race of Victoria and eastern New South Wales. &quot;P. elegans nigrescens&quot;, occurring on Queensland&#x27;s northeastern coast, and &quot;P. elegans melanoptera&quot; on Kangaroo Island. The main distinction between these is size: &quot;nigrescens&quot; is the smallest of the three and &quot;melanoptera&quot; is the largest; both are slightly darker than the nominate race.

The juveniles of &quot;P. e. nigrescens&quot; lack the greenish immature plumage of the other subspecies of crimson rosella.

===Yellow rosella===

The yellow rosella, which lives along the Murray River and several of its tributaries, was reclassified (1968) as a subspecies, &quot;P. elegans flaveolus&quot;, of the crimson rosella as the two were found to interbreed where their ranges overlap. The main difference between the two is that the crimson areas are replaced with light yellow and the tail is more greenish.

===Adelaide rosella===

The Adelaide rosella of Adelaide and the surrounding area was also thought to be a separate species, but is presently believed to be a hybrid swarm, having originated through interbreeding of the crimson and yellow rosellas. Both of these still interbreed with the Adelaide rosella where its range crosses theirs, and it exhibits variation in its plumage from dark orange-red in the south of its distribution to a pale orange-yellow in the north. Variants that are very close to the yellow race are designated &quot;subadelaidae&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The crimson rosella occurs from southeastern South Australia, through Tasmania, Victoria and coastal New South Wales into southeastern Queensland. A disparate population occurs in North Queensland.

Around 1910, a small number of crimson rosellas were released off the Otago Heads, New Zealand, along with eastern rosellas. These interbred and by the 1950s no pure crimson rosellas remained. This mixed population has remained there ever since. Crimson rosellas were also present in Wellington City from 1963 through the early 1990s as an introduced species. Two crimson rosellas were also recorded from the Tararua foothills in 1971. It is now thought to be extinct in the wild in New Zealand.

Crimson rosellas were taken to Norfolk Island as cage birds during the first penal settlement. Escaping into the wild, they were reported before 1838, and became numerous by 1900. There they are often known as &quot;red parrots&quot;, to distinguish them from the native Norfolk Island parakeet or &quot;green parrots&quot;.

Crimson rosellas are common in coastal and mountain forests at all altitudes. They primarily live in forests and woodlands, preferring older and wetter forests. They can be found in tropical, subtropical, and temperate rainforests, both wet and dry sclerophyll forests, riparian forests, and woodlands, all the way from sea level up to the tree line. They will also live in human-affected areas such as farmlands, pastures, fire-breaks, parks, reserves, gardens, and golf-courses. They are rarely found in treeless areas. At night, they roost on high tree branches.

==Behaviour==
Almost all rosellas are sedentary, although occasional populations are considered nomadic; no rosellas are migratory. Outside of the breeding season, crimson rosellas tend to congregate in pairs or small groups and feeding parties. The largest groups are usually composed of juveniles, who will gather in flocks of up to 20 individuals. When they forage, they are conspicuous and chatter noisily. Rosellas are monogamous, and during the breeding season, adult birds will not congregate in groups and will only forage with their mate.

According to a new study crimson rosellas can identify birds of their own subspecies based on the smell of other birds.

===Feeding===

Crimson rosellas forage in trees, bushes, and on the ground for the fruit, seeds, nectar, berries, and nuts of a wide variety of plants, including members of the Myrtaceae, Asteraceae, and Rosaceae families. Despite feeding on fruits and seeds, rosellas are not useful to the plants as seed-spreaders, because they crush and destroy the seeds in the process of eating them. 
Their diet often puts them at odds with farmers whose fruit and grain harvests can be damaged by the birds, which has resulted in large numbers of rosellas being shot in the past. Adelaide rosellas are known to feed on dormant cherry flower buds. Rosellas will also eat many insects and their larvae, including termites, aphids, beetles, weevils, caterpillars, moths, and water boatmen.

===Breeding===

Nesting sites are hollows greater than deep in tree trunks, limbs, and stumps. These may be up to above the ground. The nesting site is selected by the female. Once the site is selected, the pair will prepare it by lining it with wood debris made from the hollow itself by gnawing and shredding it with their beaks. They do not bring in material from outside the hollow. Only one pair will nest in a particular tree. A pair will guard their nest by perching near it and chattering at other rosellas that approach. They will also guard a buffer zone of several trees radius around their nest, preventing other pairs from nesting in that area.

The breeding season of the crimson rosella lasts from September through to February, and varies depending on the rainfall of each year; it starts earlier and lasts longer during wet years. The laying period is on average during mid- to late October. Clutch size ranges from 3–8 eggs, which are laid asynchronously at an average interval of 2.1 days; the eggs are white and slightly shiny and measure . The mean incubation period is 19.7 days, and ranges from 16 to 28 days. Only the mother incubates the eggs. The eggs hatch around mid-December; on average 3.6 eggs successfully hatch. There is a bias towards female nestlings, as 41.8% of young are male. For the first six days, only the mother feeds the nestlings. After this time, both parents feed them. The young become independent in February, after which they spend a few more weeks with their parents before departing to become part of a flock of juveniles. Juveniles reach maturity (gain adult plumage) at 16 months of age.

===Mutations===
The nominate bird is mainly red, and a few colour mutations exist, such as the blue, yellow, white, and cinnamon, in aviculture.

== Threats ==
Predators of crimson rosellas include the peregrine falcon, grey goshawk and powerful owl, as well as feral cats and foxes. Possums and currawongs are also believed to occasionally take eggs from the nest. 
Surprisingly, however, the crimson rosella is its own worst enemy. During the breeding season, it is common for females to fly to other nests and destroy the eggs and in fact, this is the most common cause for an egg failing to hatch. This behaviour is thought to be a function of competition for suitable nesting hollows, since a nest will be abandoned if all the eggs in it are destroyed, and a pair of rosellas will tend to nest in the same area from year to year.

A new study has shown that hybrid birds were more likely to fight off diseases than were pure breeds; an example of the biological phenomenon of heterosis, in which a crossbreed is stronger than its two purebred ancestors. Scientists from the Centre for Integrative Ecology at Deakin University in Geelong, Victoria, studied the infection patterns of beak and feather diseases in crimson rosellas across southern Australia. This included several hybrid populations in northeastern Victoria and southern New South Wales, located in between the range of the two parent subspecies. (&quot;Platycercus elegans flaveolus&quot; and &quot;P. elegans elegans&quot;). They found that when the subspecies mated, the resulting offspring seemed to cope better with a potentially deadly virus.

<text>The East Walker River is an approximately long, tributary of the Walker River, in eastern California and western Nevada in the United States. It drains part of the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada in the watershed of Walker Lake in the Great Basin.

==History==
==Watershed and course==
The East Walker River rises from snow melt in the Sierra Nevada of eastern California north of Mono Lake and near the northeast boundary of Yosemite National Park. The mainstem begins in the south end of the Bridgeport Valley in Mono County, California, and flows from there north past Bridgeport, where it is impounded to form the Bridgeport Reservoir. Perennial tributaries of the river above Bridgeport Reservoir begin with Green Creek (and its Summers Creek sub-tributary), then Virginia Creek (and its Dog Creek, Dunderberg Creek, and Clearwater Creek sub-tributaries). Next, Robinson Creek and Buckeye Creek (and its Swauger Creek sub-tributary) enter the reservoir.

Below Bridgeport Reservoir, the East Walker River flows northeast through the Sweetwater Mountains, where it crosses the state line into southern Lyon County, Nevada and skirts to the south of the Pine Grove Hills before flowing north to join the West Walker River approximately 7 mi (13 km) south of Yerington to form the Walker River.

U.S. Highway 395 passes through the southern part of the East Walker River valley, connecting it via Conway Summit to the Mono Lake area and via Devil&#x27;s Gate Pass to the West Walker River. California State Route 182 (also known as the Sweet Water Road) and its continuation Nevada State Route 338 head northeast along the southern East Walker River valley from their terminus on Highway 395 in Bridgeport but then diverge from the river and head northwest to the West Walker River valley.

==Ecology and wildlife==
By-Day Creek, a tributary to Buckeye Creek, is believed to contain the last pure native Lahontan cutthroat trout (LCT) &quot;Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi&quot; population in the Walker River basin and was never stocked with other species of fish. The population estimated from electrofishing in 1986 was about 1,000, but subsequent drought conditions probably reduced the population to about 250 in the early 1990s. Much of the upper watershed of By-Day Creek has been a refuge for LCT managed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife since 1979, and these fish are used to restock other parts of the watershed.

==Recreation==
The river provides continuous Class IV for kayaks and IK at high water. Ranchers have placed barbed wire across the river on both the California and Nevada sides.

<text>Aston Hall is a Grade I listed Jacobean house in Aston, Birmingham, England, designed by John Thorpe and built between 1618 and 1635. It is a leading example of the Jacobean prodigy house.

In 1864, the house was bought by Birmingham Corporation, the first historic country house to pass into municipal ownership, and is still owned by Birmingham City Council. It is now a community museum managed by the Birmingham Museums Trust and, following a major renovation completed in 2009, is open to the public.

==History==

Using a design by John Thorpe, construction was commenced in April 1618 by Sir Thomas Holte, who finally moved into the hall in 1631. The house was completed in April 1635, and is now Grade I listed. It sits in a large park, part of which became Villa Park, the home ground of the Aston Villa football club. The park is listed Grade II in Historic England&#x27;s Register of Parks and Gardens.

The house was severely damaged after an attack by Parliamentary troops in 1643. Some of the damage is still evident, and there is a hole in the staircase where a cannonball went through a window and an open door, and into the banister. The house remained in the Holte family until 1817, when it was sold and leased by James Watt Jr., son of industrial pioneer James Watt. The house was purchased in 1858 by a private company (the Aston Hall and Park Company Ltd) for use as a public park and museum. After the company ran into financial difficulties, the house was bought by the Birmingham Corporation in 1864, becoming the first historic country house to pass into municipal ownership.

Aston Hall was visited by Washington Irving, who wrote about it as &quot;Bracebridge Hall&quot;, taking the name from Abraham Bracebridge, husband of the last member of the Holte family to live there. Irving&#x27;s &quot;The Sketch Book&quot; stories described the harmonious warm-hearted English Christmas festivities he experienced while staying in Aston Hall, that had largely been abandoned. An Aston Hall custom the owners afforded the servants of the house on Christmas Eve appeared in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1795, which said: &quot;the servants have full liberty to drink, dance, sing, and go to bed when they please.&quot;

For a few years from 1879, Birmingham&#x27;s collections of art and the Museum of Arms were moved to Aston Hall after a fire damaged the municipal public library and Birmingham and Midland Institute, which shared a building in Paradise Street, until the building of the current Art Gallery in the Council House complex.

In the 1920s, the Birmingham Corporation was having financial troubles and had to choose between saving Aston Hall and the nearby Perry Hall. Aston Hall was saved, and in 1927, the Birmingham Civic Society designed formal gardens which were constructed by the city with a workforce recruited from the unemployed and paid for by government grants. The scheme included fountains, terracing and stone urns and a statue of Pan, by William Bloye, which the Civic Society paid for itself. In 1934 the finished work was presented to the City Parks Committee and unveiled by the Vice President of The Birmingham Civic Society, Gilbert Barling. As of January 2011, Birmingham City Council was working on the restoration of the statue, the head of which was missing. The council appealed for old photographs to assist in its reconstruction.

In 1938, the Pageant of Birmingham, with around 10,000 performers, was held in the grounds, to commemorate the centenary of Birmingham becoming a borough.

==Current status==
Aston Hall is now a community museum managed by Birmingham Museums Trust, having previously been managed by Birmingham City Council until 2012. Aston Hall is open to the public during spring, summer and autumn months, following extensive renovation from 2006 to 2009. It boasts a series of period rooms which have furniture, paintings, textiles and metalwork from the collections of the Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery. Visible from the House less than 200 yards to the north is Aston Villa Football club stadium. The hall received 28,804 visitors in 2019.

The easternmost part of the grounds made way for the A38(M) motorway, also known as the Aston Expressway. This opened in 1972 and gave the city centre a direct link with the M6 motorway.

In October 2019, the mansion was named as the UK&#x27;s top haunted heritage site, according to the Spectrum Paranormal Investigations and National Lottery.

In October 2023, Aston Hall became home to a parkrun, a free, weekly timed 5 km run which takes place every Saturday morning at 9am. The parkrun ceased running 10 months later in August 2024, however it is hoped this will restart again in the future.

<text>Inge II (Norwegian: &quot;Inge Bårdsson&quot;, Old Norse: &quot;Ingi Bárðarson&quot;; 1185 – 23 April 1217) was King of Norway from 1204 to 1217. His reign was within the later stages of the period known in Norwegian history as the age of civil wars. Inge was the king of the &quot;birkebeiner&quot; faction. The conclusion of the settlement of Kvitsøy with the &quot;bagler&quot; faction in 1208 led to peace for the last nine years of Inge’s reign, at the price of Inge and the &quot;birkebeiner&quot; recognising &quot;bagler&quot; rule over Viken (the Oslofjord area).

==Background==
Inge’s father, Bård, was a prominent &quot;lendmann&quot; from the Trøndelag region and a descendant of Tostig Godwinson. He was an early supporter of king Sverre, who brought the &quot;Birkebeiner&quot; faction to power in the late 12th century after years of war against king Magnus Erlingsson. Inge’s mother, Cecilia, was the daughter of an earlier king, Sigurd Munn. She had been married to the lawspeaker Folkvid in Värmland Sweden. After her brother, Sverre, had won the throne of Norway, she left her husband and travelled to Sverre in Norway, claiming she had been wedded to Folkvid against her will. The archbishop annulled her marriage to Folkvid, and Sverre gave her to his trusted follower Bård Guttormsson in marriage. Inge was Bård and Cecilia’s only son.

==Accession==
After king Sverre died in 1202, his son, Haakon, and his grandson, Guttorm, died within two years. The &quot;birkebeiner&quot; were thus left without any direct successors to Sverre. (The existence of another grandson of Sverre, Haakon Haakonsson, was as yet unknown.) Sverre’s old adversaries, the &quot;bagler&quot;, were exploiting the situation to launch a new invasion of Viken under their king, Erling Steinvegg. After the infant king Guttorm’s death in August 1204, the &quot;birkebeiner&quot; needed a strong leader to oppose the &quot;bagler&quot; threat. The &quot;birkebeiner&quot; leaders wanted earl Haakon the Crazy, who had earlier been appointed to rule the kingdom in king Guttorm’s infancy. Haakon was Inge’s older half-brother, the son of Cecilia and Folkvid. However, Eirik, archbishop of Nidaros, and the farmers of Trøndelag insisted on choosing Inge, who had until then ruled Trøndelag under Guttorm. A compromise was reached, whereby Inge became king, while earl Haakon became leader of the army, and received half the royal income.

==Reign==
The next four years saw intense fighting between the &quot;birkebeiner&quot; and the &quot;bagler&quot;. The &quot;bagler&quot; king Erling died in 1206, but the &quot;bagler&quot; continued the fight under their new king, Philip Simonsson. The &quot;bagler&quot; controlled the Viken area, with the cities of Tønsberg and Oslo King Inge controlled Trøndelag with Nidaros, while Bergen in western Norway changed hands several times. On 22 April 1206 the &quot;bagler&quot; attacked Nidaros during wedding celebrations for Inge’s sister Sigrid and Inge himself only barely escaped with his life after swimming the Nidelva river in freezing temperatures. The next year, the &#x27;birkebeiner&#x27; launched a successful attack on the &#x27;bagler&#x27; stronghold of Tønsberg, but the war dragged on with neither side able to gain a decisive victory. In autumn of 1207, archbishop Tore of Nidaros and bishop Nikolas of Oslo, a prominent &#x27;bagler&#x27;, started negotiations for a settlement of the dispute. They succeeded in bringing about a meeting between kings Inge, Philip, and earl Haakon, at Kvitsøy in Rogaland in the autumn of 1208. A settlement was made, whereby Philip agreed to give up the title of king and his royal seal. He was to remain in control of eastern Norway with Viken, except Bohuslän, with the title of earl under king Inge. Earl Haakon was given western Norway with Bergen, while Inge would be the only king, overlord of Philip and Haakon and direct ruler of Trøndelag with Nidaros. To seal the treaty, Philip married king Sverre’s daughter and king Inge’s cousin, Kristina Sverresdotter.

The peace treaty held for the rest of Inge’s reign. However, Philip did not respect its provisions and continued to use the title of king, maintaining his royal seal. The relationship between Inge and his brother Haakon remained tense. When it became clear that Philip was continuing to call himself king, Haakon made attempts to have himself declared king as well, but Inge refused to accept this. Instead, an agreement was drawn up by which the brother that survived the other would inherit the other’s lands, while a legitimate son of either would inherit them both. Haakon had a legitimate son, while Inge only had an illegitimate son, Guttorm (b. 1206) by a concubine called Gyrid. In 1214, Inge suppressed a rising by the farmers of Trøndelag; Earl Haakon was suspected of having had a hand in the rising. Open conflict between the two brothers never broke out, however, and Haakon died of natural causes in Bergen just after Christmas of 1214. Inge took over his part of the kingdom.

In 1217, Inge fell ill in Nidaros. During his illness, he appointed his younger half-brother, Skule Bårdsson, earl and leader of the army. On 23 April 1217, Inge died. He was buried in Nidaros Cathedral. He was succeeded as king by the 13-year-old Haakon Haakonsson, an illegitimate grandson of King Sverre, who had been raised at the courts of King Inge and Earl Haakon since they became aware of his existence in 1206. Skule continued as earl and &quot;de facto&quot; ruler for the next few years.

==Appraisal of Inge==
Many historians have seen Inge as a rather weak king. He never achieved control over all of Norway, and agreed to a power-sharing with the &quot;bagler&quot;, which he stuck to even though Philip broke the agreement by continuing to style himself as &quot;king&quot;. As a reaction to such views, others have claimed that Inge was a strong ruler, in that he was able to withstand the pressure of the more war-like among the &quot;birkebeiner&quot; and put a halt to the destructive civil wars for a time.

The bagler sagas - a contemporary source - describes Inge as a quiet and calm man, who shied away from feasting and preferred to spend his time in his own quarters with close friends - a character trait which was held against him by some of his men. His health was weakened following his near brush with death during the attack on Nidaros in 1206.

==Sources==
Main sources for Inge&#x27;s reign are the &quot;bagler&quot; sagas, which were written during and shortly after his reign. Inge is also mentioned less extensively at the start of Håkon Håkonsson&#x27;s saga. The first Norwegian royal letter to survive dates from the days of Inge&#x27;s reign, however, it was written by Inge&#x27;s rival Philip.

<doc id="738461" wikidata="Q5339650" url="?curid=738461" title="Edmund Ludlow">
<text>Edmund Ludlow (c. 1617–1692) was an English parliamentarian, best known for his involvement in the execution of Charles I, and for his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, which were published posthumously in a rewritten form and which have become a major source for historians of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Ludlow was elected a Member of the Long Parliament and served in the Parliamentary armies during the English Civil Wars. After the establishment of the Commonwealth in 1649 he was made second-in-command of Parliament&#x27;s forces in Ireland, before breaking with Oliver Cromwell over the establishment of the Protectorate. After the Restoration Ludlow went into exile in Switzerland, where he spent much of the rest of his life. Ludlow himself spelt his name Ludlowe.

==Early life==
Ludlow was born in Maiden Bradley, Wiltshire, the son of Sir Henry Ludlow of Maiden Bradley and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Phelips of Montacute, Somerset. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford in September 1634 and graduated in 1636. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1638.

==English Civil Wars==
At the start of the Civil War in 1642, Ludlow engaged as a volunteer in the lifeguard of Lord Essex. His first battle was at Worcester on 23 September 1642, and his next was at Edgehill on 23 October 1642. In 1643 he returned to Wiltshire and became captain of a troop of horse for Sir Edward Hungerford&#x27;s regiment. Hungerford made him governor of Wardour Castle in 1643, but he had to surrender to the Royalists after a tenacious three-month defence on 18 March 1644.

After a brief imprisonment in Oxford, he was exchanged soon afterwards, and engaged as major of Arthur Hesilrige&#x27;s regiment of horse. He was present at the second battle of Newbury in October 1644, at the siege of Basing House in November, and took part in an expedition to relieve Taunton in December. In January 1645 Sir Marmaduke Langdale surprised his regiment, with Ludlow only escaping with difficulty.

After serving as High Sheriff of Wiltshire for 1645 he was elected in 1646 Member of Parliament (MP) for Wiltshire in place of his father, and became involved with the Independent faction within Parliament – especially with Henry Marten and other radical critics of the monarchy. Ludlow was a Baptist and Calvinist predestinarian, and his political views were inextricably interlinked with providentialist and apocalyptic religious views.

Ludlow opposed negotiations with Charles I, and was one of the chief promoters of Pride&#x27;s Purge in 1648. He was one of the king&#x27;s judges, and signed the warrant for his execution. In February 1649 he was elected a member of the new Council of State after having himself been involved in drawing up the terms for its existence. Around this time he married Elizabeth Thomas of Glamorgan.

==Campaign in Ireland==
After Oliver Cromwell returned from Ireland in June 1650, he appointed Ludlow as lieutenant-general of horse and second-in-command to Henry Ireton in Parliament&#x27;s campaign there. Here he spared neither health nor money in the public service. He landed in Ireland in January 1651 and was involved in the Siege of Limerick (1650–51). After Ireton&#x27;s death on 26 November 1651, Ludlow held the chief command, and had practically completed the conquest of the island when he resigned his authority to Fleetwood in October 1652. Most of his campaigning in Ireland was against Irish guerrillas or &quot;tories&quot; and much of his operations consisted of hunting small bands and destroying foodstuff and crops. Ludlow is remembered for what he said of the Burren in County Clare during counter-guerilla operations there in 1651–52; &quot;&quot;It is a country where there is not enough water to drown a man, wood enough to hang one, nor earth enough to bury him.&quot;

==The Protectorate==
Though disapproving of Cromwell&#x27;s action in dissolving the Rump Parliament in April 1653, Ludlow maintained his employment. However, when Cromwell was declared Lord Protector after the failure of Barebone&#x27;s Parliament he declined to acknowledge his authority.

According to his &quot;Memoirs&quot; he believed that Cromwell &quot;had not appeared that he ever approved on any persons farther than he might make them subservient to his own ambitious designs; ...and that the generality of the people that had engaged with us having acted upon no higher principles than those of civil liberty, and that they might be governed by their own consent, it could not be just to treat them in another manner upon any pretenses whatsoever.&quot;

On returning to England in October 1655 he was arrested, and on refusing to submit to the government was allowed to retire to Essex. When examined by Cromwell, he was asked: &quot; &quot;Pray then,&#x27; &quot; said he, &quot; &#x27;what is it that you would have? May not every man be as good as he will? What can you desire more than you have?&#x27; &quot; &quot; &#x27;It were easy,&#x27; &quot; said I, &quot; &#x27;to tell what we would have.&#x27; &quot; &quot; &#x27;What is that, I pray?&#x27; &quot; said he. &quot; &#x27;That which we fought for,&#x27; &quot; said I, &quot; &#x27;that the nation might be governed by its own consent.&quot;&quot;

After Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s death, Ludlow was returned for Hindon, Wiltshire, in Richard&#x27;s Parliament of 1659, but opposed the continuance of the Protectorate. He sat in the restored Rump Parliament, and was a member of its Council of State and of the Committee of Safety after its second expulsion, and a commissioner for the nomination of officers in the army.

==Opposition to the Restoration==

The Wallingford House party, a strong faction in the army, &quot;who had thus possessed themselves of the supreme power, were every day pressed from all parts, and especially from the city of London, to restore the Long Parliament, as the only means to satisfy the people, and to establish an equal and just government amongst us in the way of a Commonwealth...they were compelled at last to admit the debate of the restitution of the Long Parliament amongst other propositions that were under their consideration. They also restored some officers to their commands who had suffered for their affection to the Parliament...&quot; Edmund Ludlow, was still loyal to Henry Vane the Younger and other Long Parliament leaders.

In July 1659, Edmond Ludlow was appointed commander-in-chief by the restored Rump Parliament of all forces in Ireland; and made Lieutenant-General of the Horse. Upon Ludlow&#x27;s departure from parliament, he pleaded with Sir Arthur Haslerig, Henry Vane the Younger, Mr. Henry Nevil, Mr. Scot, and Major Saloway not to put any unnecessary hardships upon those in the army.

In August 1659, King&#x27;s party addressed themselves to Col. Lambert through his wife, endeavouring to persuade her to solicit her husband to be the instrument of the King&#x27;s return, with large land offers of whatsoever terms he would demand. &quot;She acquainted the colonel with their propositions; but he having resolved to play another part, discovered the whole intrigue to Henry Vane the Younger, who having communicated it to Sir. Arthur Haslerig, and knowing there had been some differences between the colonel and Sir. Arthur, he persuaded them to renew their former friendship, with promises on each part to unit their endeavours in the service of Parliament&quot;. Ludlow and Lambert were more or less aligned and of the same party. Similar offers were apparently made to Col. Monk by the King&#x27;s party at about this time.

Returning to England again in October 1659, he endeavoured to support the original republican cause by reconciling the army to the parliament. Ludlow failed in these final reconciliation attempts primarily because of the divisions and corruption within the military, legal, and Presbyterian factions. Each faction feared successful attempt in bringing forth an equally representative republic on anything other than their own terms. For example, it was difficult for the key leaders of a previously suspended Long Parliament to take seriously any overtures from an army which had disbanded them without significant concessions to the army&#x27;s power and good behaviour, terms to which the Wallingford House and Gen. Lambert&#x27;s party would not agree. Although Ludlow had the support of Henry Vane the Younger and some other generals, these efforts proved abortive since each side had much to lose in any compromise. While these futile attempts at reconciliation between the Wallingford House party and key members of the Long Parliament were taking place, other matters would soon override all these various factions and encompass all these parties in serious compromise and peril. Consequently, most of the generals of the Wallingford House party and the key members of the Long Parliament who were in favour of the Good Old Cause (of a republican commonwealth) would lose their lives upon the restoration of King Charles II. It was believed by many of this republican faction that George Monck was for the restoration of the Long Parliament. They had no idea that King Charles II would be restored by George Monck to the throne and were entirely deceived by Monck&#x27;s treachery to the republican cause. The attempts at reconciliation between the Wallingford House part of the army and Parliament failed.

Despite Ludlow&#x27;s efforts of bringing these parties together, he was accused by some members of the Parliament of treason for having conspired with the Wallingford House party, who to these same members of Parliament seemed to be against the restoration of the original republic and only for their own continuance. Many of the generals and officers of the Wallingford House party also considered Ludlow as disloyal to their own cause and rights given his devotion to the &quot;Old Commonwealth way&quot;. In the confusion, the Parliament recalled his commission and in December as Ludlow returned hastily to Ireland to suppress a movement in favour of the adverse party in the Long Parliament he found generals of the corresponding and opposing factions in command of all strategic points and himself almost without supporters. He came back to England in January 1660, and was met with an impeachment presented against him by parliament. His own republican faction allies had also been largely forced out of power and could not assist him.

His influence and authority had now disappeared, and all chance of regaining them vanished with General John Lambert&#x27;s failure to stop General George Monck&#x27;s army from reaching London in support of the English Restoration. Monck led each party faction (republican, military, and restoration) to believe that he had declared for Parliament but kept his plans to himself until he had accomplished his purpose on what exactly that meant to him.

==Exile after the Restoration==
Ludlow took his seat in the Convention Parliament as member for Hindon, Wiltshire, but his election was annulled on 18 May after the parliament ruled that all those that had been judges of Charles I during his trial should be arrested. Ludlow was not protected under the Pardon, Indemnity and Oblivion Act. Accordingly, on the proclamation of the king ordering the regicides to come in, Ludlow emerged from his concealment, and on 20 June surrendered to the Speaker; but finding that his life was not assured, he succeeded in escaping to Dieppe, France, travelled to Geneva and Lausanne, and thence to Vevey, Switzerland. On 16 April 1662, the canton of Bern granted Ludlow and two fellow fugitives, Lisle and Cawley, an act of protection allowing them to live in the canton. His wife joined him in 1663. For security, he adopted the pseudonym of Edmund Phillips, based on a variant of his mother&#x27;s maiden name.

After the Glorious Revolution of 1688 opened up the prospect of a return, in 1689 Ludlow came back to England. He was however remembered only as a regicide, and an address from the House of Commons was presented to William III by Sir Edward Seymour requesting the king to issue a proclamation for his arrest. Ludlow escaped again, and returned to Vevey, where he died in 1692.

==Reputation and writings==
A monument raised to Ludlow&#x27;s memory by his widow is in the church of St Martin in Vevey. Over the door of the house in which he lived was placed the inscription &quot;omne solum forti patria, quia patris&quot;. This is a Christianized version of a line by Ovid meaning &quot;to the brave man every land is a fatherland because God his father made it&quot;. Ludlow married Elizabeth, daughter of William Thomas, of Wenvoe, Glamorganshire, but left no children.

During his exile, Ludlow wrote an autobiography entitled &quot;A voyce from the watch tower&quot;. After his death, his manuscript was obtained by Slingsby Bethel, who had visited him in Switzerland. Part of it, covering the years 1660–77, was discovered at Warwick Castle in 1970 and is now in the Bodleian Library. A heavily rewritten and shortened version of &quot;A voyce&quot; appeared as &quot;The Memoirs of Edmund Ludlow&quot; in 1698–99 in three volumes. The historian Blair Worden has surmised that the editor was the deist John Toland. The &quot;Memoirs&quot; were part of a range of late seventeenth-century publications printed by John Darby, including the &quot;Discourses&quot; of Algernon Sidney and the works of John Milton and James Harrington. In the &quot;Memoirs&quot; Ludlow&#x27;s puritanism is virtually written out, and his views changed to make him a Whig-like secular republican. Until the 1970s the &quot;Memoirs&quot; were generally assumed to be authentic – there were editions in 1720–1722, 1751, and 1771, with a scholarly edition by C.H. Firth in 1895. As a result, the Memoirs have been used until very recently as a major source for historians of the seventeenth century, with only the rediscovery of Ludlow&#x27;s original manuscript prompting a reassessment.

In 1691–1693 four pamphlets were published in Ludlow&#x27;s name. Like the &quot;Memoirs&quot; after them, they were a contribution to the Whig cause. Contemporaries variously attributed them to Slingsby Bethel, John Phillips (Milton&#x27;s nephew), Thomas Percival, and John Toland.

<text>Joniškis (; Samogitian: &quot;Juonėškis&quot;; ) is a city in northern Lithuania with a population of about 9,900. It is located 39 kilometers north of Šiauliai and 14 kilometers south of the Lithuania–Latvia border. Joniškis is the municipal and administrative centre of Joniškis district municipality.

==Name==
Joniškis is the Lithuanian name of the town. Historical versions of the name in other languages include Polish: &quot;Janiszki&quot;, Russian: Янишки &quot;Yanishki&quot;, Yiddish: יאַנישאָק &quot;Yanishok&quot;, Latvian: &quot;Jānišķe&quot;, and German: &quot;Jonischken&quot;.

==History==

Joniškis was established in the beginning of the 16th century. It was mentioned in written sources on 23 February 1536 when Bishops of Vilnius and Samogitia visited the area and found that people still practiced the old pagan faith. People were worshiping the God of Thunder (Perkūnas), fire, snakes and other pagan deities. The bishop of Vilnius, John of the Lithuanian Dukes baptized the locals and established a new parish on 23 February 1536. A wooden church was built and the town of Joniškis was built around it. The bishop of Vilnius named the town Joniškis after his own name Jonas. Joniškis was on the crossroad of important trade roads. It was located in the Duchy of Samogitia in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

During World War II, the town was under Soviet occupation from 1940, and then under German occupation from 1941 to 1944. In late 1941, 148 Jewish men were shot near Joniškis in the nearby forest. The remaining Jews (men, women and children) were murdered in the forest in September 1941. 493 people were murdered in total by an Einsatzgruppen of Joniškis policemen and Lithuanian nationalists supervised by the Germans.

==Infrastructure==

With the Church of the Accession of the Holy Virgin Mary (founded in 1901) and a complex of two Jewish synagogues – The Red Synagogue (built in 1897) and The White Synagogue (built in 1823) – at its center, the town has the status of an urban architectural heritage site.

A railway line connecting Riga and Šiauliai runs along the western boundary of the town. West of the railway are the town&#x27;s allotment gardens, the Lutheran Cemetery and the Cemetery for the Victims of World War II. Joniškis has two water reservoirs formed by dams on the River Sidabra. Joniškis has the Jonas Avyžius Public Library of Joniškis District Municipality, the Basketball Museum and a large animal compound feed manufacturing plant &quot;Joniškio Grūdai&quot;.

==Climate==
Joniškis has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification).

<text>Sir Hardress Waller (1666) was born in Kent and settled in Ireland during the 1630s. A first cousin of Parliamentarian general William Waller, he fought for Parliament in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, becoming a leading member of the radical element within the New Model Army. In 1649, he signed the death warrant for the Execution of Charles I, and after the Stuart Restoration in 1660 was condemned to death as a regicide.

A prominent member of Protestant society in Munster in Ireland during the 1630s, Waller fought against the Catholic Confederacy following the 1641 Irish Rebellion. When the First English Civil War began in August 1642, Charles I wanted to use his Irish troops to help win the war in England, and in September 1643 agreed a truce or &quot;Cessation&quot; with the Confederacy. Waller opposed this and defected to the Parliamentarians; in April 1645, he was appointed a colonel in the New Model Army and fought throughout the final campaigns of 1645 and 1646.

An admirer of Oliver Cromwell, Waller became a political and religious radical; he took part in the 1647 Putney Debates, supported Pride&#x27;s Purge in December 1648 and was a judge at the Trial of Charles I in January 1649. During the Protectorate, he held considerable political power in Ireland and was arrested in February 1660 after staging a coup in an attempt to prevent the Restoration of Charles II. At his trial for regicide in October 1660, Waller pleaded guilty and was sentenced to death, later commuted to life imprisonment. He died in 1666 at Mont Orgueil on the island of Jersey.

== Personal details ==
Hardress Waller is thought to have been born around 1604, the only son of George Waller and Mary Hardress, both of whom died by 1622. His father sold the family estates at Groombridge to his younger brother Thomas in 1601 and thereafter lived on his wife&#x27;s property in Chartham, which is probably where Hardress was brought up. His first cousin was the Parliamentarian general Sir William Waller, Thomas&#x27;s eldest son.

In 1629, he married the daughter of Elizabeth Dowdall, née Southwell, daughter of Sir Thomas Southwell, an English settler with extensive lands in County Limerick, through whom he acquired a large estate in Castletown. They had two sons, Walter (died late 1650s) and James (1636-1702), along with four daughters, all of whom made important marriages; Elizabeth (1637-1708) to Sir Maurice Fenton, Bridget (1639-1721) to Henry Cadogan, Anne (1641-1709) to Sir Henry Ingoldsby, 1st Baronet, a close relative of Oliver Cromwell, and Mary to Sir John Brookes. These connections ensured that despite his conviction for regicide in 1660, the Waller family held onto their Castletown estates and remained significant figures in Munster society into the 20th century.

== 1625 to 1646 ==
Details of Waller&#x27;s early career are limited; his uncle Thomas fought in Ireland under Elizabeth I, and in 1625 Waller joined a regiment raised for the Anglo-Spanish War (1625–1630) by William St Leger, Lord President of Munster. Recruited for the disastrous assault on Cádiz in 1625, the ships carrying his unit were forced ashore in Ireland and never reached Spain. Knighted in 1629, he settled in Ireland after his marriage and was elected to the Parliament of Ireland in 1634 for Askeaton, then County Limerick in 1639. Waller was a leading opponent of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, who served as Lord Deputy of Ireland from 1632 to 1640. In December 1640, he was selected by the Irish Parliament to deliver a petition or &quot;Remonstrance&quot; attacking Strafford to the Long Parliament in Westminster; some of their complaints were included in the charges that ended with his execution in May 1641.

Following the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Waller was besieged in his castle at Castletown by Patrick Purcell in March 1642. Shortage of water forced him to surrender six weeks later and he subsequently claimed to have lost property worth over £11,000. He was appointed lieutenant colonel in the army raised to suppress the revolt and a member of the Protestant war council in Munster but the outbreak of the First English Civil War in August 1642 ended supplies of men and money from England. In September, the Earl of Inchiquin, Protestant leader in Munster, sent Waller to the Royalist capital in Oxford to plead for additional resources.

However, Charles I wanted to use his Irish army to help win the war in England, and in September 1643 agreed a truce or &quot;Cessation&quot; with the Catholic Confederacy. Factions on both sides objected to the terms, which included negotiations on freedom of worship for Catholics and constitutional reforms. Protestants saw this as a threat, while many Confederates felt they were on the verge of victory and gained nothing from the truce; they were also well aware any concessions Charles made to Catholics in Ireland undermined his position in England and Scotland.

After failing to persuade Charles not to transfer troops from Ireland to England, Inchiquin declared for Parliament in July 1644 and Waller moved to London. By early 1645, he was serving in his cousin William&#x27;s Western Army and when the New Model Army was formed in April 1645, he was given command of an infantry regiment. He fought at Naseby in June, followed by Langport, Bristol and Basing House, where he was wounded. When Charles surrendered in April 1646, he was part of the force besieging Exeter.

==1647 to 1666==
Although his cousin Sir William was a moderate Presbyterian, during his service with the New Model Waller became a religious Independent and admirer of Oliver Cromwell. He transferred back to Ireland in February 1647 but fell out with Inchiquin and returned to England, where he became increasingly involved in radical politics and took part in the Putney Debates. During the 1648 Second English Civil War, he served as Parliamentarian commander in the strongly Royalist West Country and successfully suppressed a number of local revolts. Troops from his regiment took part in Pride&#x27;s Purge in December which excluded moderate MPs from Parliament, while he was one of the 59 judges who signed the death warrant for the Execution of Charles I in January 1649. He was the only Irish Protestant to do so; many others, including Inchiquin, strongly opposed it and fought for the Royalists during the 1650 to 1652 Cromwellian conquest of Ireland.

In December 1649 Waller was finally released from his command in South West England to join Cromwell in Ireland, who returned to England in May 1650. Promoted Major General in June, Waller captured Carlow Castle in July and was appointed Governor of Limerick after it surrendered in October 1651; this ended major military operations, although guerrilla warfare continued until 1653. Under the Protectorate, Waller held considerable political influence; his son-in-law Sir Henry Ingoldsby replaced him as Governor of Limerick in 1653 and the two men were MPs for County Clare, County Limerick and County Kerry in the Protectorate Parliaments of 1654, 1656 and 1659.

However, Waller&#x27;s personal loyalty to Cromwell and status as a regicide isolated him from other Irish Protestants, the majority of whom were either hostile to the Commonwealth or suspicious of Cromwell&#x27;s ambitions. In the political chaos that followed the resignation of Richard Cromwell in 1659, Waller opposed the Stuart Restoration and in February 1660 staged an attempted coup in Limerick. This was quickly suppressed by Sir Charles Coote and Lord Broghill, in what was the last military action of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in Ireland.

Sent to England as a prisoner he managed to escape to France, then returned to London hoping to benefit from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act. One of only two regicides to plead guilty, he claimed to have been appointed to the trial without his knowledge, a suggestion dismissed by the republican Edmund Ludlow as indicating &quot;one who would say anything to save his life&quot;. Condemned to death, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment while he was also allowed to retain his lands. He was imprisoned in Mont Orgueil, Jersey, where he died in 1666.

<doc id="738471" wikidata="Q5275561" url="?curid=738471" title="Digbeth">
<text>Digbeth is an area of central Birmingham, England. Following the remodelling of the Inner Ring Road, Digbeth is now considered a district within Birmingham City Centre. As part of the Big City Plan, Digbeth is undergoing a large redevelopment scheme that will regenerate the old industrial buildings into apartments, retail premises, offices and arts facilities. The district is considered to be Birmingham&#x27;s &quot;Creative Quarter&quot;.

==History==
The modern site of Digbeth was first settled upon in the 7th century. Historically the land to the west of the river Rea was in the parish of Birmingham. This is Digbeth. The land to the east was in the more significant parish of Aston, and is called Deritend. Birmingham&#x27;s oldest secular building, The Old Crown, is there.

The area around Digbeth and Deritend was the first centre of industry in Birmingham and became one of the most heavily industrialised areas in the town, historically within Warwickshire. This may have been due to Henry Bradford who in 1767 donated land on Bradford Street to anyone willing to establish a trade there. The street soon prospered and there were over twenty public houses on it catering to its workers. Today there are just two: The White Swan and The Anchor.

The amount of manufacturing in Digbeth made it of national importance. Industry was attracted to the area as a result of the supply of water from the River Rea and from the natural springs in the area. Digbeth was accessed by the Grand Union Canal and the Digbeth Branch Canal in the 18th and early 19th centuries.

Railways also arrived in Digbeth in the 19th century by the Great Western Railway. The mainline passed through Digbeth via a large railway viaduct built out of Staffordshire blue brick, and into Snow Hill station via the Snow Hill Tunnel. As traffic at Snow Hill increased, Moor Street station was built as another terminus to relieve congestion, with an additional goods shed to serve the nearby markets. The goods shed was eventually demolished, but the station still in use for services to London Marylebone. Near the Bordesley station, this mainline viaduct meets the incomplete Bordesley Viaduct, which passes over the Digbeth Canal but stops abruptly at Montague Street. This was intended to link the Birmingham &amp; Oxford Junction Railway to Curzon Street station, but it was ascertained when construction was about two thirds complete that trains would not be able to serve Curzon Street Station. Once new mainlines were built into Snow Hill and New Street, construction on the viaduct stopped and it has remained unused since. Bridges over the roads have been removed. There are plans to turn the upper surface into an &quot;elevated park&quot;, similar to the former New York High Line which is now a park and walking route.

Industry that settled in Digbeth include the Birmingham Battery and Metal Company which moved to Selly Oak around 1876, and Typhoo Tea who had a factory on Bordesley Street which was in use from 1896 till 1978. The now-disused factory has its own canal basin connected to the Digbeth Branch Canal. The Typhoo Tea building, also known as the S Rose &amp; Co Building, is a four-storey building, blue brick at the front (Bordesley Street) and red brick to the rear. Currently vacant, it was previously used as a warehouse. It is soon to become the new HQ for the BBC in the region. Another food industry that settled in Digbeth was Alfred Frederick Bird&#x27;s custard company that produced a form of custard that did not use eggs. This was invented by his father, Alfred Bird. The factory was set up in the Devonshire Works in 1902 on the High Street. The complex expanded and is now an arts centre. The Devonshire Works themselves are to be refurbished.

Part of the Custard Factory complex is the Deritend Library, Birmingham&#x27;s oldest surviving library building. The library opened on 26 October 1866 and was the third free district library to open in Birmingham. The library re-opened in 1898 following enlargement as a result of its popularity. Deritend Library closed on 16 November 1940. In 2003, it was opened as a conference centre and exhibition space. It is the only building of the original five free Birmingham libraries still standing.

The library building is located on Heath Mill Lane, which, along with Floodgate Street, provide information on the character of pre-industrial Digbeth. The River Rea once flowed unaffected by human development through Digbeth, cutting both the High Street and Floodgate Street in two. The &#x27;Floodgates&#x27; were used when the river flooded. Heath Mill Lane meanwhile was named after the watermill used for grinding corn which had stood there since the 16th century. The River Rea is now hidden from view. Digbeth also had an abundance of natural springs which were gradually built upon as industry moved into the area. The existence of these springs and wells in the area are reflected in the street names such as Well Street.

One of Digbeth&#x27;s most recognisable buildings, the former Bonser &amp; Co. warehouse at 85 Digbeth, was built around 1860. It was built for the Bonser &amp; Co. firm of iron merchants and consists of a short entrance tower fronting onto Digbeth High Street. The tower, being small, was designed to take up as little shop frontage space on the street as possible but also to break the monotony of the small buildings around it. On the ground floor is a semi-circular arch and a segmental arch on the first floor. In the pitched roof is a slight upward curve.

Other notable buildings in Digbeth, include the now-defunct The Clothing Mart operated by George Makepeace at 135-6 Digbeth which was designed by James Patchett of Ombersley. Built in 1913, it is a steel framed structure with a mixture of façade materials. The façade consists of bright red brick and orange terracotta. The building is no longer used by George Makepeace and has changed hands, undergoing a variety of uses. Several aspects of its original architecture have been lost including a first floor iron balcony, above which electric lanterns with hooded lenses from two iron holders that remain. Either side of these were iron and glass lamps resembling Medici goblets. The orange pilasters sit on a key stone and pedimented blocks set with round pink granite stones and the parapet is of green glazed terracotta.
Birmingham&#x27;s only Rowton Houses, now known as the Paragon Hotel, are in Digbeth.
Digbeth was also of importance in 19th century transport with many coaches and carriers terminating at inns there. Inns that were particularly popular as such locations were The White Hart, the Red Lion, and The Bull&#x27;s Head. This transport history is reflected in the creation of Digbeth Coach Station (now Birmingham Coach Station), which was built in 1929 by Midland Red.

In the second half of the 19th century, an Italian quarter began to develop in the Fazeley Street area of Digbeth, with many immigrants from Italy settling in the area. However, this community was largely broken up in World War II due to the damage of buildings from the Luftwaffe, as well as many Italian residents being held in internment camps due to the fact that Italy was an enemy to Britain in this conflict.

Digbeth has two conservation areas: Digbeth, Deritend, and Bordesley High Streets Conservation Area and the Warwick Bar Conservation Area. Both conservation areas are alongside each other. The Digbeth, Deritend, and Bordesley High Streets Conservation Area was designated on 31 May 2000 and has an area of 28.68 Ha (70.86 acres), covering all of Digbeth. The Warwick Bar Conservation Area was designated on 25 June 1987 and has an area of 16.19 Ha (40.00 acres). It extends outside of Digbeth, along the Digbeth Branch Canal through Eastside. These days Digbeth is often considered to include Deritend.

==Etymology==
The name Digbeth is derived from &quot;dig path&quot;. However, Digbeth is also believed to have originally been called &#x27;Duck&#x27;s bath&#x27; in reflection of the water supply in the area. It has also been suggested that it comes from &quot;dragon&#x27;s breath&quot;, referring to air pollution during the industrial revolution.

==21st century==
The 21st century has seen huge growth in the area, with numerous housing developments and regeneration of former industrial buildings. The district is considered to be Birmingham&#x27;s &quot;Creative Quarter&quot;. The influx of creatives and media organisations to the area, along with a surge in pop-up shops, craft beer venues and street art has led to frequent comparisons with Shoreditch in London. In a 2018 survey conducted by The Sunday Times, Digbeth was rated as the &quot;Coolest Neighbourhood in Britain&quot;.

The redevelopment of the Custard Factory, once home to Bird&#x27;s Custard, began at the turn of the century. The Custard Factory now plays host to workspaces for 400 small businesses, predominantly tech, digital and creative SMEs. The complex also plays host to a number of bars and restaurants, an arcade, the Mockingbird Cinema, a hairdressers, a gallery, and The Old Library, a multi-purpose event space.

Across the road from the Custard Factory is Birmingham Coach Station which is operated by National Express.

===Ongoing developments===
====Film studios====
In February 2022, Steven Knight, the creator of Digbeth-set television series &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;, announced the development of the Digbeth Loc Studios, within the Warwick Bar area of the district. In the announcement, it was revealed that long-running television cooking competition &quot;MasterChef&quot; would record from the studios from 2024. Knight also announced that the studios, and the wider Digbeth area, would be the filming location for an upcoming Peaky Blinders film. The complex will also be a home for the band UB40, as well as providing filming facilities for the BBC drama series &quot;This Town&quot;. some workspaces are open for hire.

====Typhoo Wharf redevelopment====

The BBC announced, in August 2022, the move of their Birmingham operations to the disused Typhoo Tea factory complex from their existing base in Birmingham&#x27;s Mailbox. Productions set to move to Digbeth include local broadcasts such as Midlands Today and BBC Radio WM, as well as national services Newsbeat and BBC Asian Network. The plans also include up to of new residential, office, and catering services space around the new BBC building. In addition, around of land around Typhoo Wharf and the canal basin will be converted into a new mixed-use neighbourhood, with open spaces and pedestrian thoroughfares. Work started on the project in February 2024.

====Railway extension====
As of 2024, the West Midlands Metro Birmingham Eastside extension is being built from the Bull Street tram stop to Digbeth, via the HS2 Curzon Street station and Birmingham Coach Station.

== Irish Quarter ==
Digbeth has historically had very close links with the Irish community of Birmingham, and in recent years has increasingly been referred to as &#x27;the Irish Quarter&#x27;. Significant Irish immigration to Birmingham began following the Irish Famine of the 1840s, with the majority emigrating from the counties of Roscommon, Galway, and Mayo. Further waves of immigration followed, most notably during and after the Second World War. The need to rebuild infrastructure, and the growth of municipal transport both led to a significant number of job opportunities. The Midland Red and Birmingham Bus Corporation&#x27;s centre in Dublin attracted more Irish workers than any other transport department in Britain.

The Irish Welfare and Information Centre was established on Moat Row in 1957 providing information on housing, employment and socialising to the community. In 1967, the Irish Development Association founded the Irish Community Centre on Digbeth High Street, which became a focal point for Irish immigrants and the Irish diaspora.

Later being sold to private owners and renamed &#x27;The Irish Centre&#x27;, it was closed and demolished in 2020, with the most recent owners opening what they claim to be a &quot;New Irish Centre&quot; in Kings Heath. It was originally planned that an Irish Centre would be rebuilt as part of a large regeneration project named Connaught Square, first proposed in 2007. The developers behind the scheme, Naus Group, were a victim of the 2008 recession and the plans were sold on to developers SevenCapital in 2014. After revised plans were submitted, planning permission was granted by Birmingham City Council in 2019.

The area contains a number of Irish pubs, notably Hennessy&#x27;s, Norton&#x27;s, and Cleary&#x27;s, all regularly hosting traditional Irish music concerts; alongside The Spotted Dog, The Big Bull&#x27;s Head and The Kerryman. Many other pubs that once catered to the Irish community remain in existence attracting wider audiences, including The White Swan, The Old Crown and The Anchor.

While living in the city, renowned Irish singer Luke Kelly met Scottish folk singer Ian Campbell with the two regularly playing at the Jug of Punch folk club, which operated in both The Big Bull&#x27;s Head and Digbeth Civic Hall (now the Digbeth Institute).

The traditional St Patrick&#x27;s Day parade, which began in Birmingham city centre in 1952 before going on hiatus in 1974, has been held in Digbeth since 1996, attracting crowds of up to 100,000 visitors, making it the largest event of its kind in the country and the third largest in the world.

<text>Bernhard Severin Ingemann (28 May 1789 – 24 February 1862) was a Danish novelist and poet.

==Biography==
Ingemann was born in Torkilstrup, on the island of Falster, Denmark. The son of a vicar, he was left fatherless in his youth. 

He attended Slagelse Latin school with the chemist William Christopher Zeise and the poet Christian Hviid Bredahl. While a student at the University of Copenhagen he published his first collection of poems (1811; vol. ii., 1812), which show great influence of German romanticism. Critics describe their sickly sentimentality as reflecting the unhealthy condition of the poet&#x27;s body and mind at this time. These works were followed by a long allegorical poem, &quot;De sorte Riddere&quot; (The Black Knights, 1814), which closed his first period.

Then followed six plays, of which the best is considered to be &quot;Reinald Underbarnet&quot; (The Miraculous Child Reinald, 1816), and the most popular, &quot;Blanca&quot;, (1815). In 1817 he published his first prose work, &quot;De Underjordiske, et bornholmsk Eventyr&quot; (The Subterranean Ones, a Story of Bornholm), which was followed in 1820 by &quot;Eventyr og Fortællinger&quot; (Narratives and Miraculous Tales), many of them imitations of Hoffmann. During 1818–19 he traveled on the Continent.
In 1822 he was appointed instructor of the Danish Language and Literature at the Academy of Sorø. During his next period, inspired by Scott&#x27;s Waverley novels, Ingemann produced his series of historical romances, by virtue of which he disputes with H. C. Andersen the title of the children&#x27;s writer of Denmark. Their subjects are all taken from Danish history. The first, and perhaps the best, is &quot;Valdemar Sejr&quot; (Valdemar the Victorious, 1826), which was followed by &quot;Erik Menveds Barndom&quot; (Erik Menved&#x27;s Childhood, 1828); &quot;Kong Erik og de Fredløse&quot; (King Erik and the Outlaws, 1833); and &quot;Prins Otto af Danmark og Hans Samtid&quot; (Prince Otto of Denmark and his Time, 1835).

While his historical romances show a lack of accuracy, their strong nationality gives them a special interest to the student of Danish culture. In reality they mean the introduction of the historical novel in Danish literature. A later artistic novel &quot;Landsbybørnene&quot; from 1852 (&quot;The Village Children&quot;) is now almost forgotten.

Known as the fourth great Danish hymn writer (after Kingo, Brorson and Grundtvig), Ingemann is considered less rooted in Biblical dogma and more borne up by a general spiritual and religious interest. A simple naivete runs through them. Especially popular were his &quot;Morgen og Aftensange&quot; (Morning and Evening Songs), a collection of religious poems of great beauty and spirituality written during 1837–39. They were set to music by the composer Weyse. Many of them have been classics in Danish schools (for instance &quot;I Østen stiger Solen op&quot; – ”In the East the Sun rises” and &quot;Fred hviler over Land og By&quot; – ”Peace is resting over Land and Town”). Also his Christmas hymns are popular. He also wrote poems of historic and mythological content in the heroic saga &quot;Holger Danske&quot; (“Ogier the Dane”, 1837).

He was a personal friend of Grundtvig who was in some degrees his mentor and with whom he shared a deep interest of Danish medieval history. Often they have been regarded almost mental twins in spite of clear differences. Also Blicher and H. C. Andersen must be mentioned among his friends.

Ingemann was in his elder years much respected and after the death of Oehlenschläger he was regarded the unofficial poet-king of Denmark. Critics cite Ingemann&#x27;s grace and delicacy, rather than strength, of style, both in prose and poetry. He died in Sorø.

Ingemann was married to Lucie Marie Mandix (1792–1868), a painter, whose works still hang in Danish churches.

<text>Calvin &quot;Pokey&quot; Reese Jr. (born June 10, 1973) is an American former Major League Baseball infielder. Reese played with the Cincinnati Reds, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Boston Red Sox from 1997 to 2004. With the Red Sox, he won the 2004 World Series over the St. Louis Cardinals. He batted and threw right-handed. Reese was known for his defense, winning two Gold Glove Awards during his career.

==Early life==
Reese was born in Columbia, South Carolina. Growing up, he lived for a while in a two-room shack with an outhouse, along with eight or nine relatives, on the south end of Columbia. His father, an alcohol and drug addict, was often absent. Reese started playing Little League baseball at the age of nine, using a borrowed glove; he would not own a baseball glove until high school. Reese started at A.C. Flora High School, then transferred to Lower Richland High School, which was better-known for sports. During his sophomore year, major league scouts sent to watch Earl Cunningham were impressed by a long throw he made during a game. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the first round, 20th overall, of the 1991 MLB Draft.

==Career==
Reese began his professional career with the Princeton Reds of the Rookie-level Appalachian League in . The next season, he moved up to Single-A, joining the Charleston Wheelers of the South Atlantic League.

Reese made his major league debut with the Reds in 1997. He played with the team through 2001, winning two Gold Glove Awards along the way.

Following the 2001 season, the Reds traded Reese and Dennys Reyes to the Colorado Rockies for Luke Hudson and Gabe White on December 18. The next day, the Rockies traded him to the Red Sox for first baseman Scott Hatteberg. The Red Sox did not tender him a contract, making him a free agent two days later. On January 30, 2002, he signed with the Pirates.

In 2003, Reese turned down a higher-paying deal from Pittsburgh to play for the Red Sox. On May 8, 2004, at Fenway Park, Reese had the first two-home run game of his career in a Red Sox 9-1 victory over the Kansas City Royals. Reese hit an inside-the-park home run and one over the Green Monster, to snap a 172 at-bat homerless streak dating back to April 4, 2003. The last Red Sox player to hit a conventional homer and an inside-the-park homer in the same game was Tony Armas on September 24, , at Tiger Stadium.

Reese fielded a ground ball from Rubén Sierra and threw to Doug Mientkiewicz for the final out of the 2004 ALCS, as the Red Sox won their first pennant since 1986. They won the 2004 World Series a week later.

On January 5, , Reese signed with the Seattle Mariners, but never played in a game before being put on the 60-day disabled list and missing the entire season due to injury.

In , Reese signed a one-year deal with the Florida Marlins; however, his contract was terminated on March 5, 2006, after he left the club on March 1 and did not have direct contact with anyone on the team for over 72 hours. Mike Nicotera, his agent, said the departure was for personal reasons.

In , Reese signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals and played for the Triple-A Columbus Clippers where in two games he strained both hamstrings and was placed on the DL for several weeks. On July 3, 2008, he returned from the disabled list to the Single-A Hagerstown Suns, but was quickly sent back up again to Triple-A Columbus. He became a free agent at the end of the season, after which he retired from professional baseball.

==Playing style==
At the plate, Reese struck out much more often than he walked, posting a career 0.43 walk-to-strikeout ratio (226-to-531). Reese was a high-percentage base stealer (144-for-170), Reese had a career .307 on-base percentage.

In an eight-year career, Reese was a .248 hitter with 44 home runs and 271 RBI in 856 games.

==After retirement==
In May 2015, Reese was named the high school baseball coach at his alma mater, Lower Richland High School in Hopkins, South Carolina.

==Personal life==
Reese was engaged to be married to Tieronay Duckett, a classmate of his at Lower Richland, with whom he had a daughter in November 1992. However, his fiancée died in a car accident in 1993 while on the way to a dry cleaner. Reese also had a son with Rhonda Richardson in September 1992; Richardson would die in childbirth three-and-a-half years later. Reese had a third child, MacKayla Barnes, in 1997.

<doc id="738481" wikidata="Q711612" url="?curid=738481" title="Bobby Ray Inman">
<text>Bobby Ray Inman (born April 4, 1931) is a retired United States Navy admiral who held several influential positions in the United States Intelligence Community.

==Early years==
Inman was born and raised in the community of Rhonesboro, Texas, in the eastern portion of the state. His father was the owner and operator of a gas station. Inman attended and graduated from Mineola High School. Inman recalled in 1986 that he was 5&#x27; 4&quot; tall and weighed upon graduation, and he tutored athletes he admired during high school to keep from being bullied.

Inman graduated from Mineola High School in Mineola, Texas at the age of 15, in 1946. He rode a bus from Mineola to Tyler Junior College, where he was a member of Phi Theta Kappa National Honor Society. He graduated from the University of Texas with a degree in history at the age of 19. According to Budiansky, after joining the Naval Reserve during the Korean War, Inman then &quot;rocketed up through the ranks of naval intelligence&quot;.

==Naval career==
Inman served as Director of Naval Intelligence from September 1974 to July 1976, then moved to the Defense Intelligence Agency where he served as vice director until 1977. He next became the director of the National Security Agency. Inman held this post until 1981. His last major position was as the deputy director of Central Intelligence, a post he held from February 12, 1981 to June 10, 1982.

Inman “flatly rejected” Israel’s mistaken identity claim regarding the 1967 USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident. He stated that “It is just exceedingly difficult to believe that [the USS &quot;Liberty&quot;] was not correctly identified.” He said his conclusions were based on his talks with senior NSA officials who had direct knowledge at the time. Along with NSA Deputy Director for Operations Oliver Kirby, U.S. Air Force Major General John E. Morrison (Kirby’s successor), and Lieutenant General William E. Odom, he said he was unaware of any agency official at any time who dissented from the “deliberate” conclusion.

While simultaneously acting as the NSA director and the CIA deputy director in early 1981, he modernized the collection process by setting up a joint facility in College Park, Maryland. According to Budiansky, Inman did so by &quot;sending memos back and forth to himself approving his solutions.&quot;

In 1976, Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie published their paper, &quot;New Directions in Cryptography&quot;, introducing a radically new method of distributing cryptographic keys, which went far toward solving one of the fundamental problems of cryptography, key distribution. It has become known as Diffie–Hellman key exchange. However, when Hellman and two of his graduate students attempted to present their work on this on October 10, 1977 at The International Symposium on Information Theory, the National Security Agency warned them that doing so would be legally equivalent to exporting nuclear weapons to a hostile foreign power. Inman led the NSA at the time, and he feared that encryption – which had so far only been used for military purposes – would be used by hostile foreign powers, reducing the ability of the NSA to collect signals intelligence. However, Hellman – who anticipated that the increasing use of electronic communications in private sector transactions would require encryption – proceeded to give the talk. While this defied the NSA&#x27;s threat of prosecution, Inman eventually realised Hellman&#x27;s point and there was no prosecution. Hellman and Inman even became friends. Public key cryptography now forms an essential component of internet security.

In 1980, Inman allowed an openly gay linguist at the NSA to maintain a security clearance. National policy on security clearances would not officially change until 1995.

Inman chaired a commission on improving security at U.S. foreign installations after the Marine barracks bombing and the April 1983 US Embassy bombing in Beirut, Lebanon. The commission&#x27;s report has been influential in setting security design standards for U.S. Embassies.

After retirement from the Navy, he was chairman and chief executive officer of the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (MCC) in Austin, Texas for four years and chairman, president and chief executive officer of Westmark Systems, Inc., a privately owned electronics industry holding company for three years. Admiral Inman also served as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas from 1987 through 1990.

Admiral Inman’s primary activity since 1990 has been investing in start-up technology companies, where he is a managing director of Limestone Ventures. He is a member of the board of directors of several privately held companies. He serves as a trustee of the American Assembly and the California Institute of Technology. He is an elected Fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration.

President Clinton nominated him as Secretary of Defense, but he withdrew his nomination (see below).

Inman also was on the board of SAIC.

Since 2001, Inman has held the LBJ Centennial Chair in National Policy at The University of Texas at Austin Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, and in 2005 and again in 2009 was the school&#x27;s interim dean. Inman graduated from Texas with a bachelor&#x27;s in history in 1950.

Inman has also served on the board of directors of the Council on Foreign Relations, Dell Computer, SBC Corporation (now AT&amp;T) and Massey Energy.

In 2011, he became head of the board of directors of Xe Services, formerly Erik Prince&#x27;s Blackwater and now known as Academi. As of 2013, he sits on the board of directors of Academi.

==Nomination for Secretary of Defense==
Inman was announced as President Bill Clinton&#x27;s choice to succeed Les Aspin as Secretary of Defense on December 16, 1993, initially receiving broad bipartisan support. He accepted the post at first, but withdrew his nomination during a press conference on January 18, 1994.

During the press conference, Inman made angry remarks about comments by &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist William Safire. Safire wrote paragraphs on Inman&#x27;s &quot;anti-Israel bias shown&quot;, and ended in a four-point list of other negative qualifications. In reply, Inman suggested that Safire had recruited Senator Bob Dole of Kansas to engage in a &quot;vitriolic attack&quot; on Inman, and also claimed that Dole and Senator Trent Lott were planning to &quot;turn up the heat&quot; on his nomination.
Dole&#x27;s reaction was to state that &quot;I have no idea what&#x27;s gotten into Bobby Inman... Admiral Inman&#x27;s letter doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.&quot; Lott appeared even more surprised, saying that &quot;I am floored by [Inman&#x27;s] bizarre press conference&quot;, while an unnamed White House aide added: &quot;Most of us were glued to the tube, our mouths open in shock.&quot;

==International Signal and Control (ISC) Scandal==
In 1994, after Bobby Ray Inman asked to be withdrawn from consideration as Defense Secretary, his critics speculated that the decision was motivated by a desire to conceal his links to International Signal and Control (ISC). Inman was a member of the board of directors of the company, which was allegedly either negligent or approved illegal exports.

Originally called ESI (Electronic Systems International), the company manufactured sub-assemblies for the AGM-45 Shrike and RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles in 1974, and just after the Vietnam War which was part of a standard arms contract for the US defense administration (DCAS). The company also had a commercial repair facility of two meter portable amateur (&quot;ham&quot;) radios from a company in New Jersey called Clegg, and manufactured communications helmet radios for firemen, and electronic outdoor bug zappers.

ISC was involved in two major indiscretions, for which CEO James Guerin received a 15-year prison sentence:
* It defrauded and caused the collapse of the British company Ferranti, which acquired it in 1987. 
* It exported classified military technology to South Africa, which was then forwarded to third countries, notably Iraq.
From 1984 to 1988, ISC sent South Africa more than $30 million in military-related equipment, including telemetry tracking antennae to collect data from missiles in flight, gyroscopes for guidance systems, and photo-imaging film readers, all of which would form the &quot;backbone&quot; of a medium-range missile system. Some of this technology was reportedly transferred to Iraq. Another link to Iraq was the supply of the specifications for the Mk 20 Rockeye II cluster bomb through Chilean defense company Cardoen Industries, which was able to build an almost identical weapon that was subsequently used against coalition forces in the Persian Gulf War of January–February 1991.

==Statements==
In 2006, Inman criticized the Bush administration&#x27;s use of warrantless domestic wiretaps, making him one of the highest-ranking former intelligence officials to criticize the program in public.

In the 2024 United States presidential election, Inman endorsed Kamala Harris.

==Awards and decorations==


In 1982, Inman received the American Academy of Achievement’s Golden Plate Award presented by Awards Council member General David C. Jones at a ceremony in New Orleans.

<text>Samuel Insull (November 11, 1859 – July 16, 1938) was a British American business magnate. He was an innovator and investor based in Chicago who helped create an integrated electrical infrastructure in the United States. Insull created holding companies that purchased utilities and railroads. Insull was responsible for the building of the Chicago Civic Opera House in 1929. 
Due to the Great Depression, his vast Midwest holding company empire collapsed, and he was accused of profiting personally by selling worthless stock to unsuspecting investors who trusted him because of his position and reputation. Following a seven-week trial, he and 16 co-defendants were acquitted of all charges after two hours of jury deliberation.

==Early life==
Insull was born on November 11, 1859, in London, the son of Insull Insull, a tradesman and lay preacher who was active in the temperance movement, and Emma Short. He was one of five siblings who survived to adulthood. His younger brother, Martin, became a major executive at Sam&#x27;s companies. Insull&#x27;s career began as an apprentice clerk for various local businesses at age 14. He went on to become a stenographer at &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. Through a newspaper ad, the 19-year-old became the private secretary and bookkeeper to Colonel George Gouraud, the London representative of Thomas Edison&#x27;s telephone companies. When he learned of a job with Edison in the United States, Insull indicated he would be glad to have it, provided it was as Thomas Edison&#x27;s personal secretary.

In 1881, at the age of 21, Insull immigrated to the US, complete with side whiskers to make him appear older than his years. In the decade that followed, Insull took on increasing responsibilities in Edison&#x27;s business endeavors, building electrical power stations throughout the US. With several other Edison Pioneers, he participated in Henry Villard&#x27;s January 1889 founding of Edison General Electric, which later became the publicly held company known as General Electric. In 1892, Insull was offered the post of second-vice-president at General Electric, but was unhappy at not being named its president. When the presidency went to another, Insull moved to Chicago as head of the Chicago Edison Company. Another consideration is that he was caught between opposing factions when J. P. Morgan combined the Thomson-Houston Electric Company and Edison General Electric to form the new company in April 1892. Those loyal to Edison accused Insull of selling out, and in fact he did welcome the infusion of capital, from the Vanderbilts, from J. P. Morgan, and others, as necessary for the company&#x27;s future development. Edison forgave him, but others did not, and it seemed a good idea to move on to a new company in a new place.

==Life in Chicago==


The Western Edison Light Co. was founded in Chicago in 1882, three years after Edison developed a practical light bulb. In 1887, Western Edison became the Chicago Edison Co. Insull left General Electric and moved to Chicago in 1892, where he became president of Chicago Edison that year. Chicago Edison was losing money until Insull discovered a way to make it profitable during a Christmas visit to Brighton, England in 1894. To his surprise, he saw that the shops were closed, but every light in them was burning, something that never happened in the US. Finding the head of the town&#x27;s electric company, he asked him how this could happen and was told the secret to it was not a flat rate bill, but use of a demand metered billing system, measuring not only total power consumption, but a set of rates for low-demand and high-demand electric use times. By 1897, Insull had worked out his formulas enough to offer Chicago electric customers two-tiered electric rates. With the new system, many homeowners found their bills lowered by 32% within a year.

In 1896, Insull became a US citizen. In 1897, he incorporated another electric utility, the Commonwealth Electric Light &amp; Power Co. In 1907, Insull&#x27;s two companies formally merged to create the Commonwealth Edison Co.

During a Chicago meeting on October 8, 1918, he introduced Professor Thomas Garrigue Masaryk as the president of the future Czechoslovak Republic, de facto.

As more people became connected to the electric grid, Insull&#x27;s company, which had an exclusive franchise from the city, grew steadily. By 1920, when it used more than two million tons of coal annually, the company&#x27;s 6,000 employees served about 500,000 customers. Annual revenues reached nearly $40 million. During the 1920s, its largest generating stations included the Fisk Generating Station and Crawford Station, both on the Sanitary and Ship Canal.

Insull began purchasing portions of the utility infrastructure of the city. When it became clear that Westinghouse&#x27;s support of alternating current would win over Edison&#x27;s direct current, Insull switched his support to AC in the war of the currents.

His Chicago area holdings later included Federal Signal Corporation, Commonwealth Edison, Peoples Gas, and the Northern Indiana Public Service Company, and held shares of many more utilities. Insull also owned significant portions of many railroads, mainly electric interurban lines, including the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad, Chicago Rapid Transit Company, Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad, Gary Railways, and Chicago South Shore and South Bend Railroad. He helped modernize these railroads and others.

As a result of owning these diverse companies, Insull is credited with being one of the early proponents for regulation of industry. He saw that federal and state regulation would recognize electric utilities as natural monopolies, allowing them to grow with little competition and to sell electricity to broader segments of the market. At the same time, a regulated monopoly could keep costs down by eliminating duplication of infrastructure by competing companies, while prices could be kept to reasonable rates by regulators. He used economies of scale to overcome market barriers by cheaply producing electricity with large steam turbines, such as the installations in the 1929 State Line Generating Plant in Hammond, Indiana. This made it easier to put electricity into homes. As part of his drive to efficiency, Insull practiced vertical integration. Coal was extracted from mines his companies developed, transported by the Chicago &amp; Illinois Midland Railway to Havana, Illinois to be transferred to barges, both of which his companies controlled, and taken up the Illinois Waterway to Commonwealth Edison power stations. In the late 1920s, he attempted to build a dam on the Cumberland River just above scenic Cumberland Falls, posing a threat to the cataract&#x27;s flow, but was thwarted by conservation interests and the Kentucky legislature.

Samuel Insull also had interests in broadcasting. Through his long association with Chicago&#x27;s Civic Opera, he thought the new medium of radio broadcasting would be a way to bring opera performances into people&#x27;s homes. On hearing of the work of Westinghouse to establish a radio station in Chicago, he contacted the company. Together the two companies arranged for a radio station to be built in Chicago which would be operated jointly by Commonwealth Edison and Westinghouse. KYW&#x27;s first home was the roof of the Edison Company building at 72 West Adams Street in Chicago, and it went on the air November 11, 1921. It was Chicago&#x27;s first radio station.

Though the partnership came to an end in 1926, with Westinghouse buying out Edison&#x27;s interest in KYW, Insull&#x27;s interest in broadcasting did not stop there. He formed the Great Lakes Broadcasting Company in 1927 and purchased Chicago radio stations WENR and WBCN; the two stations were merged on June 1, 1927, with Insull paying a million dollars for WENR alone. Insull moved the stations first into the Strauss Building, then into Insull&#x27;s Civic Opera House, where WENR became an affiliate of the NBC Blue Network. Insull&#x27;s Great Lakes Broadcasting Company also included a mechanical television station, W9XR, which began in 1929 after the company installed the first 50,000 watt radio transmitter in Chicago for its two radio stations.

The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and ensuing Great Depression, caused the collapse of Insull&#x27;s public utility holding company empire.

When Insull&#x27;s fortune started to fade, he sold both WENR and WBCN along with W9XR, to the National Broadcasting Company in March 1931. Two years after its purchase of the radio stations and the mechanical television station, NBC shut W9XR just as it had done with W9XAP, which came with its purchase of WMAQ (AM).

==Personal life==
On May 22, 1899, Samuel Insull married a &quot;tiny, exquisitely beautiful and clever&quot; Broadway ingénue actress whose stage name was (Alis) Gladys Wallis (1875–September 23, 1953). Her real name was Margaret Anna Bird. Gladys Wallis was popular with New York audiences and appeared in W. H. Crane&#x27;s company first in the play &quot;For Money&quot; in 1892 and in his subsequent productions. Gladys played the role of Maggie Rolan in &quot;Brother John&quot; (1893); a &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer listed her as one of the most popular players, one who &quot;deserved quite all the applause [she] received.&quot; Prior to her marriage to Insull, Gladys also appeared on the New York stage in &quot;On Probation&quot; and &quot;Worth a Million&quot;. At the height of her fame she was interviewed (rather unsuccessfully) by Frank Norris.

At the time of their marriage, Insull was 41 and Gladys was 24. She had been on the stage from childhood. The Insulls lived outside Libertyville, Illinois, in a Mediterranean styled mansion with extensive grounds that later became the Cuneo Museum, in Vernon Hills. They also had an apartment at 1100 North Lake Shore Drive in the city and a furnished suite at the Civic Opera House. The Insulls had one son, Samuel Jr.

Both husband and wife were patrons of the arts. Because of this Insull was instrumental in the building of Chicago&#x27;s Civic Opera House, which opened November 4, 1929, with &quot;Aida&quot;. The opera and its cast were chosen by Insull. Samuel Insull was also known for his charitable works in other areas, donating large sums of money to local hospitals, then calling on others with similar resources to do the same. He donated freely to African-American charities in Chicago, asking the wealthy to follow his example. At the time the US entered WWI, Insull was named head of the Illinois Defense Council by President Woodrow Wilson; his efforts sold over a million dollars of War Bonds.

==Great Depression==
Insull controlled an empire of $500 million with only $27 million in equity. (Due to the highly leveraged structure of Insull&#x27;s holdings, he is sometimes wrongly credited with the invention of the holding company.) His holding company collapsed during the Great Depression, wiping out the life savings of 600,000 shareholders. The collapse along with the ongoing National Electric Light Association&#x27;s Federal Trade Commission Investigation of the electric industry led to the enactment of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

Insull fled the country, initially to France. When the United States asked French authorities that he be extradited, Insull moved to Greece, where there was not yet an extradition treaty with the US. He was later arrested and extradited to the United States by Turkey in 1934 to face federal prosecution on mail fraud and antitrust charges. He was defended by Chicago lawyer Floyd Thompson and found not guilty on all counts.

==Death==
In July 1938, the Insulls visited Paris to see the Bastille Day festivities. Insull suffered from a heart ailment, and his wife Gladys had asked him not to take the Métro because it was bad for his heart. Nevertheless, Insull had made frequent declarations that he was &quot;now a poor man&quot; and on July 16, 1938, he descended a long flight of stairs at the Place de la Concorde station. He died of a heart attack just as he stepped toward the ticket taker. He had 30 francs in his pocket at the time and was identified by a hotel laundry bill in his pocket. Insull was receiving an annual pension totaling $21,000 from three of his former companies when he died. Insull was buried near his parents on July 23, 1938, in Putney Vale Cemetery, London, the city of his birth. His estate was found to be worth about $1,000 and his debts totaled $14,000,000, according to his will.

==Legacy==
Insull&#x27;s legacies included electricity grid systems and the regulated monopoly, a uniquely American institution that included utility companies. This came from a combination of his business persona and his political one. On the one hand, he abhorred the waste of competing power producers, whose inefficiency would often double the cost of production. On the other hand, he believed in the citizen&#x27;s right to fair treatment. So while he bought up rival companies and created a monopoly, he kept his prices low and campaigned vigorously for regulation.

==In media==
Often regarded as a fictionalized biography of William Randolph Hearst, Orson Welles&#x27;s film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is, in part, inspired by the life of Samuel Insull.

&quot;It was a real man who built an opera house for the soprano of his choice, and much in the movie was borrowed from that story,&quot; Welles wrote. Welles gave Maurice Seiderman a photograph of Insull, with mustache, to use as a model for the makeup design of the old Charles Foster Kane.

Welles denied that the character of Susan Alexander was based on Gladys Wallis, but co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz did incorporate a related experience into the script. In June 1925, after a 26-year absence, Gladys Wallis Insull returned to the stage in a charity revival of &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; that ran two weeks in Chicago. When the performance was repeated on Broadway in October 1925, Herman J. Mankiewicz – then the third-string theatre critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot; – was assigned to review the production. After her opening-night performance in the role of Lady Teazle, drama critic Mankiewicz returned to the press room &quot;full of fury and too many drinks&quot;, wrote biographer Richard Meryman:
He was outraged by the spectacle of a 56-year-old millionairess playing a gleeful 18-year-old, the whole production bought for her like a trinket by a man Herman knew to be an unscrupulous manipulator. Herman began to write: &quot;Miss Gladys Wallis, an aging, hopelessly incompetent amateur, opened last night in ...&quot; Then Herman passed out, slumped over the top of his typewriter.

Mankiewicz resurrected the experience in writing the screenplay for &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, incorporating it into the narrative of drama critic Jedediah Leland. After Kane&#x27;s second wife makes her catastrophic opera debut, Leland returns to the press room and passes out over the top of his typewriter after writing the first sentence of his review: &quot;Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur ...&quot;

Tom Holland plays Insull in the 2019 historical drama film &quot;The Current War&quot;.

<text>Take or Tache Ionescu (; born Dumitru Ghiță Ioan and also known as Demetriu G. Ionnescu; – 21 June 1922) was a Romanian centrist politician, journalist, lawyer and diplomat, who also enjoyed reputation as a short story author. Starting his political career as a radical member of the National Liberal Party (PNL), he joined the Conservative Party in 1891, and became noted as a social conservative expressing support for several progressive and nationalist tenets. Ionescu is generally viewed as embodying the rise of middle-class politics inside the early 20th century Kingdom of Romania (occasionally described as &quot;Takism&quot;), and, throughout the period, promoted a project of Balkan alliances while calling for measures to incorporate the Romanian-inhabited Austro-Hungarian regions of Transylvania, Banat and Bukovina. Representing his own faction inside the Conservative Party, he clashed with the group&#x27;s leadership in 1907–1908, and consequently created and led his own Conservative-Democratic Party.

An Anglophile promoting an alliance with the Triple Entente, he rallied politicians and intellectuals in support for the idea of Romania entering World War I. When this was accomplished through the 1916–1918 campaign, Ionescu joined the Ion I. C. Brătianu government in Iași as Minister without portfolio. After his country was defeated by the Central Powers and signed the Treaty of Bucharest, he left for Paris and London, organizing a Romanian National Committee to campaign for Greater Romania during the Peace Conference. In 1919, his Conservative-Democrats formed an alliance with the People&#x27;s League, and Ionescu became Foreign Affairs Minister in the second Alexandru Averescu executive, before briefly holding the office of Premier in 1921–1922. During the period, he successfully campaigned in favor of the Little Entente.

He was the brother of renowned surgeon and political activist Thoma Ionescu, who was his collaborator on several political projects. Take Ionescu is also remembered for promoting Nicolae Titulescu, who went on to have a successful career as a diplomat and politician, and for his friendships with the dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale and the Greek politician Eleftherios Venizelos.

==Biography==

===Early life and politics===
Born in Ploiești into a family of lower middle class origins, the eldest of four male children, he was the son of Ghiță Ioan, an entrepreneur who was facing insolvency, and his wife Eufrosina (or Frosa). Eufrosina was the descendant of Aromanian immigrants, and related to the Wallachian writer Ion Heliade Rădulescu.

During Take&#x27;s childhood, the family moved to Bucharest and later to Giurgiu, where Ghiță Ioan began to accumulate a fortune after leasing a segment of the customs in the city. This allowed him to send his sons to study abroad; after entering the Saint Sava High School with a scholarship and graduating with honors, Take Ionescu (as he became known in his student days) entered the University of Paris and took a PhD in Law, attending courses together with, among others, the future politicians Raymond Poincaré, Constantin Dissescu, Constantin Arion, Grigore Andronescu, Alexandru Djuvara, and Alexandru Marghiloman. During his high school years, he began contributing to literary magazines and authoring works of verse and especially short stories influenced by the style of Gérard de Nerval and including the time travel story &quot;Spiritele anului 3000&quot; (&quot;The Spirits of the Year 3000&quot;).

While in Paris, Ionescu fell in love with an Englishwoman named Bessie Richards, whom he met a charity event, and to whom he dedicated his PhD thesis (&quot;La recherche de la paternité naturelle&quot;, &quot;Research into Natural Parenthood&quot;). After consulting international law on the matter of marriage, he decided it was best if he were to marry her in Britain. They sealed their union in a common law marriage in Brighton, and later through an Eastern Orthodox religious ceremony in London (November 1881). The couple were to settle in Bucharest, but made frequent visits to Bessie&#x27;s native country for the rest of her life.

Upon his return, he opened a highly successful law practice on Bucharest&#x27;s Costa-Foru Street (later known as Atena Street), and frequently traveled to various areas of the country in order to plead in various cases. His oratorical talent won him the moniker &quot;Tăkiţă gură de aur&quot;, &quot;Tăkiţă the golden mouthed&quot;, based on a pet form of his colloquial name and the title commonly associated with eloquence (&quot;see John Chrysostom&quot;). He became President of the Bar association in Ilfov County (at a time when it included Bucharest), in which capacity he welcomed the first-ever Romanian woman lawyer, Sarmiza Bilcescu (1891).

Originally a member of the National Liberal Party (PNL), he was attracted to its Radical wing (led by C. A. Rosetti), wrote extensively for the Liberal newspaper &quot;Românul&quot;, and became a PNL representative in the Chamber of Deputies following the 1884 election. One year later, while still in office, he left the PNL — this came at a time when opposition forces rallied against the policies of Premier Ion Brătianu, whom Ionescu had originally supported. Initially running as an independent in the election of 1888, being elected in Craiova, he switched to conservative politics (generally associated with the landowner circles), and joined the Conservative Party in 1891.

===First ministerial positions and birth of Takism===
A leading figure of the Conservatives for the following years, he held several ministerial positions after 1891: he was Minister of Religious Affairs and Education in the Lascăr Catargiu cabinet (1891–1895) and again under Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino (April 1899 – January 1900), as well as Minister of Finance (January–July 1900; 1904–1907) in both Cantacuzino cabinets. In 1899, Ionescu took the side of Jewish scientist Lazăr Şăineanu, endorsing his naturalization in front of opposition from the antisemitic faction among the National Liberals, and helped bring the matter for renewed discussion in the Senate. He also helped the scholar earn credentials by overseeing his conversion from Judaism to the Romanian Orthodox Church, and serving as his godfather. However, by the end of the same year, Ionescu had mysteriously changed in mind: he voted in favor of complicating naturalization procedures for Jews and, as Education Minister, stripped Şăineanu of his honorary teaching position within the University of Bucharest. A supposed atheist, he was criticized by the opposition for favoring an increased role for the Romanian Orthodox Church, and replied that it was a matter for his own conscience. During the period, he befriended the notorious and independent-minded dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale, who later supported his dissident politics.

From 1898, he began issuing the French-language newspaper &quot;La Roumanie&quot;, through which he publicized his own program, commonly referred to as &quot;Takism&quot;. At the time, contrary to the more cautious policies of his party, he began voicing full support for incorporating Transylvania, a region largely inhabited by Romanians and ruled by Austria-Hungary, into the Kingdom of Romania; he even made a symbolic conquest by financing the building of a road in the vicinity of Buşteni, on the Transleithanian side of the border. Initially, he welcomed the idea of Romania itself entering the Habsburg monarchy in a federalist project (&quot;see United States of Greater Austria&quot;), as a means to solve the nationality issue, but eventually came to oppose it; in a conversation with the PNL&#x27;s Constantin Stere, who continued to support the idea, Ionescu declared: &quot;instead of a foreign minister in Vienna, if Romania should join the Habsburgs, I would rather become a waiter in Chicago!&quot;.

He contemplated a future Balkan federation, and in a 1903 interview, argued that, although such a solution was &quot;impossible for the moment&quot;, it &quot;could perhaps be accomplished some day&quot;. Additionally, Ionescu supported the Vlach cause in the Ottoman-ruled regions of the Balkans, and supported the recognition of a &quot;Kutzovlach ethnicity&quot;. In this last instance, he caused a diplomatic incident when, during a 1905 official trip to Istanbul, he attempted to present Sultan Abdul Hamid II with such a project and was denied an audience — consequently refusing to be presented with an Ottoman decoration, he was ultimately received and his report was reviewed by the Porte.

===1907 Peasants&#x27; Revolt===
He sided with the Conservative Nicolae Filipescu, who shared his views on the issue of Transylvania, and provoked a conflict within his grouping at a time when the PNL was strengthening itself by incorporating a large part of the Romanian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party. Around 1907, seeking party leadership, he came to oppose the other main Conservative leaders Cantacuzino and Petre P. Carp — the latter represented the party&#x27;s &quot;Junimea&quot; faction, which had just re-entered the main Conservative Party after an independent existence under the name of &quot;Constitutional Party&quot;; Ionescu also repeatedly clashed with the other Constitutional leader, the influential literary critic Titu Maiorescu. Constantin Xeni, his future collaborator, argued that &quot;the boyar wing of [the Conservative Party] had made life impossible for this son of an obscure bourgeois from Ploieşti&quot;.

Despite such differences in opinion, Ionescu initially stood by the Conservative establishment during the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1907. He held up estate leaseholders as a productive social class (arguing that, unlike peasants, &quot;[they] do not consume their own income&quot;), and approved of repressive measures to the point where he initiated the decision taken by his cabinet to resign, to be replaced by that of the PNL&#x27;s Dimitrie Sturdza. This was also prompted by his fears that Carp and Cantacuzino were going to use his ministry&#x27;s problems as a means to undermine his political support. During the events, he questioned traditional Conservative stances, stressing that there existed a large gap between the ruling class and the mass of the people.

Identifying him as the person behind his return to power, Sturdza publicly thanked Ionescu during his investiture ceremony, to the enthusiasm of the Chamber. With 33 other politicians from both political camps (among them Carp, Constantin Stere, Gheorghe Gh. Mârzescu, Ion G. Duca, Alexandru Djuvara, Constantin Alimănişteanu, Ion and Alexandru G. Radovici, Dinu and Vintilă Brătianu), he was a member of a short-lived Parliamentary Committee charged with finding a solution to the agrarian issue; created in June, it was dissolved by the cabinet later in the same month. Soon after this, Sturdza and Ionescu engaged in a publicized argument, with Sturdza accusing him of having provoked the revolt through excessive taxation; reacting to this allegation, Ionescu rested the blame with antisemites inciting public sentiment against Jewish leaseholders, and with a wider network of agitators. In addition, he virulently opposed PNL legislation that imposed a minimum wage for work on estates, a maximum income for leaseholders, and set aside grazing land for communal ownership. He argued that such demands went against regulations on the free market and property. When a compromise was eventually reached regarding land prices and the land which was available for leasing to anyone other than communes, he defended it in front of opposition from within his own party, while pointing out ways in which professional leaseholders could avoid the letter of the law. Additionally, one of Ionescu&#x27;s proposals, regarding the establishment of an agricultural bank (Casa Rurală) won support from both parties.

===Split with the Conservatives===
He broke away from the Conservative Party and founded the Conservative-Democratic Party (&quot;Partidul Conservator-Democrat&quot;, PCD) in early 1908. This followed a move by mainstream Conservatives to marginalize the pro-Ionescu faction. The Takists organized themselves at a congress in Bucharest in February of that year and, especially through their section in the capital, were successful in several consecutive elections.

Upon the separation, Ionescu stated: &quot;I have the deep conviction that Romania needs a conservative party, democratic in its makeup, progressive in its tendencies, but firmly representing the ideas of social conservation. This party must be strong, in order to form a counterbalance to the Left, which, fatally and as indicated by the times, will move more and more to the Left&quot;. He stressed his principles in opposing Socialism, indicating that he mistrusted its ability to reconcile with &quot;maintaining freedom&quot;. Additionally, Ionescu made mention of reforming the census suffrage enshrined in the 1866 Constitution, and expressed support for a single electoral college to replace the three wealth-based ones in existence at the time.

The PCD was soon joined by Ion Luca Caragiale, who characterized Take Ionescu as &quot;An indefatigable and wise patriot&quot;, by the future diplomat Nicolae Titulescu, by the doctor Constantin Istrati, the writer Barbu Ştefănescu-Delavrancea, the journalist Nicolae Xenopol, the former mayor of Iaşi Gheorghe Lascăr, the landowners Constantin Cantacuzino Paşcanu and Alexandru Bădărău, as well as by Xeni, who left a eulogistic account of his mentor. It became the target of attacks from both the PNL and the Conservatives, and was faced with the reticence of King Carol I. Nevertheless, Xeni contended, the new grouping profited from Ionescu&#x27;s popularity with the lower strata of Romanian society, being identified as &quot;one of their own&quot;. In this version of events, mainstream politicians allegedly convinced Carol that the PCD had an agenda to depose the ruling House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, and had depicted Ionescu as &quot;a &#x27;Belzebuth&#x27; who was supposed to be removed from public life&quot;.

The PNL notably accused the Conservative-Democrats of having been instigated and financed by Mochi Fischer, one of the main leaseholders, whose land in Flămânzi had been the original center of agitation during the 1907 events. Among the points of contention between the PCD and the PNL were the 1908 expulsion of the socialist activist and &quot;România Muncitoare&quot; leader Christian Rakovsky (based on an order which the PCD considered illegal) and the unsuccessful 1909 reform advanced by Minister of Education Spiru Haret (which, among other things, prevented academics who taught Law from practicing, and created new university chairs, raising suspicions that these had been purposely designed to accommodate PNL members).

At the time, he became known as an Anglophile, and according to Xeni, adopted British manners in his private life, while being one of the few speakers of fluent English in his country. As a model for his own party, Take Ionescu cited the precedent set by Lord Randolph Churchill and his &quot;Tory Democracy&quot; in Britain.

===Maiorescu government and the Balkan Wars===
In late 1911, the PCD began talks for an alliance with the National Liberals, directed at the second Carp government, and opposed by King Carol (as it threatened to draw support for constitutional changes). Repeatedly calling on Carp to include PCD ministers in his executive, Ionescu sided with Brătianu in May 1911, during the scandal erupting over Bucharest&#x27;s tram system (when the Conservatives uncovered that the former Mayor of Bucharest, Vintilă Brătianu, had contracted some of his fellow Liberals to complete the work in question). The matter escalated when Carp faced Parliament with a proposal for legislative changes, and publicly questioned Ion I. C. Brătianu&#x27;s morality. The conflict prolonged itself over the following months, and ended with the fall of the Carp government and its replacement with a transitional one, headed by Maiorescu.

Eventually, in October 1912, Ionescu aided in the creation of a new executive comprising several Conservative tendencies and also led by Maiorescu, serving as Minister of Internal Affairs until December 1913. Before Romania intervened in the Second Balkan War and annexed Southern Dobruja, Ionescu attempted to persuade Bulgarian politician Stoyan Danev to accept ceding the region as compensation for incorporating Aromanian-inhabited territories. Later, he reviewed tentative proposals for Romania to occupy Bulgaria itself, and rejected them outright. Ionescu continued to advise caution in respect to his country&#x27;s policies in the Balkans, and argued that Romania should not offend any of the three other kingdoms in the region (Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia). Xeni argued that, In Ionescu&#x27;s view, the Balkan Wars announced a conflict on a much larger scale.
His attitude on Balkan issues brought him the friendship of Greek Premier Eleftherios Venizelos. In November 1913, Ionescu left for Athens with King Carol&#x27;s approval, mediating between the Ottoman envoy Mehmed Talat Pasha, a member of the Young Turks, and the Greek executive. He was received in triumph, and managed to seal a deal between the two states, receiving in return public thanks from both governments, as well as the honorary citizenship of Athens. Since the treaty was disadvantageous to defeated Bulgaria, Ionescu was allegedly the target of an assassination attempt (reportedly foiled by an ethnic Aromanian).

By early 1914, Ionescu became involved in a prolonged discussion with Luigi Luzzatti, former prime minister of Italy, who asked Romania to review its policies and allow Jewish Emancipation (&quot;see History of the Jews in Romania&quot;). He ultimately promised Luzzatti that all Jewish veterans of the Second Balkan War were going to be awarded Romanian citizenship, but the policy was overturned by the PNL&#x27;s Ion I. C. Brătianu executive, coming to power in January 1914.

===Outbreak of World War I===
In late summer 1914, while traveling back from London and receiving news of World War I having erupted, Ionescu made a series of highly accurate predictions — he theorized that Italy, the United States, Japan and Romania itself were to be dragged into the conflict, that the Central Powers were to be initially victorious, and that, after a series of setbacks, &quot;we shall get to see Greater Romania with our own eyes&quot;. Reportedly, he also foretold a worldwide rise in support for left-wing causes.

Ionescu initially supported Romania&#x27;s neutrality. Nevertheless, unlike the main Conservative group, his PCD soon began intense advocacy of joining the war effort against the Central Powers, calling for Romania to incorporate the Austro-Hungarian-ruled regions of Transylvania, Banat, and Bukovina (Ionescu argued that Romania could not exist unless &quot;we are straddling the Carpathians&quot;). Defining the Austrian monarchy as &quot;a sad nothingness&quot;, Ionescu expressed his opinion that the German Empire, Austria-Hungary&#x27;s main ally, was gripped by the influence of Prussian &quot;corporalism&quot;. Xeni recounted that Ionescu had displayed a degree of sympathy with King Carol&#x27;s position, contending that the monarch was not entirely opposed to joining the Entente in its war effort.

According to one of the PCD&#x27;s main opponents, the writer and journalist Tudor Arghezi, Ionescu changed his priorities on the very day King Carol convoked a Crown Council which confirmed neutrality policies (3 August 1914). In this version of events, the Conservative Democrat commented upon the necessity of supporting the Entente Powers just as he was leaving Peleş Castle; Arghezi commented with irony that: &quot;before reaching the street, Mr. Take Ionescu had reviewed his ideas several times. [...] It would seem that Mr. Take Ionescu&#x27;s ideas are stillborn, just like premature babies, born before their time and dead before having an age&quot;. He also expressed a view that the new policy was &quot;demagogy&quot;, intended to bring the PCD into government (&quot;Let all perish, as long as Mr. Take Ionescu succeeds!&quot;), and contrasted Ionescu&#x27;s claim to represent popular interest with his refusal to accept land reform and universal suffrage.

Similar views were expressed by the notorious socialist and Zimmerwald pacifist Christian Rakovsky, leader of the Social Democratic Party. Writing to his main collaborator Leon Trotsky in May 1915, he accused Ionescu of &quot;making a political principle out of venality&quot;, and of being &quot;a man of vulgar ambitions and unmeasurable vanity, a politician of no faith, no convictions, who considers political programs to be each a cause to plead&quot;. Contending that Take Ionescu aimed to be &quot;on all occasions, on the winning side, courting people in power&quot;, Rakovsky believed that his support for the Entente was conjectural: &quot;Until yesterday, [he] was the man who continuously tied friendships with the Germans [...]. Anticipating victory for the Allies, [he] has now become their man, and, finding it difficult to return to his old sympathies, he threatens that, in case Russia were to fail, he would expatriate himself to America, the Romanian people having lost, in the eyes of such a &quot;patriot&quot;, all interest once he would no longer have the hope of returning to power&quot;. On the other side of the political spectrum, Ionescu remained at odds with the Conservative leader Petre P. Carp; in 1915, referring to his policies, Carp remarked: &quot;Talent does not justify all avatars, just as beauty does not justify all forms of prostitution&quot;.

Seeking a settlement with Hungary over the territorial issue, Ionescu traveled to Budapest on one occasion, meeting with Miklós Bánffy: vehemently stating his goal of incorporating the regions into the Kingdom of Romania, he was answered that Austria-Hungary intended to extend its influence to the Black Sea (Ionescu recounted: &quot;we agreed that we could never agree&quot;). Ionescu kept close contacts with Entente politicians, and notably with the prominent French Radical-Socialist Georges Clemenceau, who described him as &quot;a great European, albeit Romanian down to his marrow, having for his country the highest and most legitimate of ambitions&quot;. At the time, he deplored Eleftherios Venizelos&#x27; deposition from the office of prime minister (October 1915).

===1916===
Following Carol&#x27;s death and Ferdinand I&#x27;s ascension to the throne, his pro-Entente activism intensified. He was at the forefront of a major grouping of various public figures who, despite differences in politics, supported an alliance with France and Britain, including Nicolae Filipescu, Constantin Istrati, Octavian Goga, Vasile Lucaciu, Barbu Ştefănescu-Delavrancea, Nicolae Iorga, Simion Mândrescu, Ioan Cantacuzino, Nicolae Xenopol, N. D. Cocea, Constantin Mille, as well as Take Ionescu&#x27;s brother Thoma. Their adversary Christian Rakovsky accused Mille, a former socialist, of using his two dailies, &quot;Adevărul&quot; and &quot;Dimineaţa&quot;, as venues for Takist propaganda, and claimed that this was accomplished &quot;under the mask of independence&quot; (additionally, he stated: &quot;[Ionescu] thus compensated for the weakness of his party, both in men and ideas, through corrupting the press&quot;).

In late 1915, Ionescu and most like-minded activists formed a body known as &quot;Acţiunea Naţională&quot; (&quot;National Action&quot;) or &quot;Federaţia unionistă&quot; (&quot;Unionist Federation&quot;). It found relative support from the new monarch, but his policies were rejected by the PNL cabinet of Ion I. C. Brătianu — although the latter force supported the Entente, it decided not to enter the war until the Entente powers were to recognize Romanian rule in Transylvania, Bukovina, and the Banat, as well as provide the country with military assistance. In contrast, Ionescu&#x27;s attitude, as paraphrased by Stephen Bonsal, was: &quot;Our role is that of an unconditional ally of the democracies. We must not drive a bargain. We should and can rely on the appreciation of our allies when the victory is won&quot;.

According to the PNL&#x27;s Ion G. Duca, Brătianu, who was the main target of &quot;Acţiunea Naţională&quot;&#x27;s criticism, &quot;wrapped himself in an atmosphere of silence and played the sphinx&quot;. With Thoma Ionescu, Rector of the University of Bucharest, campaigning among academics, and with Take Ionescu maintaining contacts with the PNL minister Alexandru Constantinescu-Porcu, the Entente supporters were becoming increasingly influential by 1915. In late 1914, they successfully replaced the leadership of the Cultural League with a panel of &quot;Acţiunea Naţională&quot; members.
Eventually, after the Bucharest agreement was sealed, recognizing Romanian demands in front of the Entente, Brătianu approved of entering the conflict and agreed to declare war on the Central powers. On 7 August 1916, the matter was communicated to political leaders in a Crown Council held at Cotroceni Palace in Bucharest; Ionescu, who was visiting Sinaia together with the American military &quot;attaché&quot; Halsey E. Yates, rushed back to the capital after being invited by Constantinescu-Porcu. Being advised to maintain secrecy over the proceedings, he hid the reasons for his return by starting a rumor that the outbreak of typhoid fever in Sinaia had gotten out of control.

Other politicians attending the Council included several government ministers (Brătianu, Duca, Constantinescu-Porcu, Vasile Morţun, Emil Costinescu, Alexandru G. Radovici, Emanoil Porumbaru, Victor Antonescu, Constantin Anghelescu), Parliamentary leaders (Mihail Pherekyde, Constantin Robescu), former premiers (Titu Maiorescu, Theodor Rosetti, and Petre P. Carp), other party leaders (Nicolae Filipescu and Alexandru Marghiloman) and former Chamber presidents (Constantin Olănescu and Constantin Cantacuzino Paşcanu). Conservatives present voiced their disapproval, with Maiorescu as the most vocal opponent: Maiorescu and Brătianu notably engaged in a separate debate about whether Transylvanians had called on Romania to intervene — the former argued that no such call had been voiced, while Brătianu contended that he had support from over the border (Ionescu seconded this claim).

As most of the political leaders present at te meeting approved of the change in policy, Carp gave a short speech in which he refused to back Ferdinand&#x27;s decision and wished &quot;for Your Majesty&#x27;s armies to be defeated&quot;, although commenting that he would &quot;give Your Majesty my four sons, because Romanians are brave in the military&quot;. In a private conversation with Premier Brătianu, Take Ionescu contended that &quot;[Carp] is Shakespearean in his error. He does not surprise me, given that I never took him seriously to begin with. You have taken him seriously, and this is your own fault&quot;.

===Romanian Campaign===
The country subsequently suffered a series of defeats and all its southern areas were occupied by the Central Powers (&quot;see Romanian Campaign&quot;). Ionescu followed Romanian authorities into refuge to the provisional capital of Iaşi, being hosted by C. Konya, a well-known pharmacist whose house was near the local university. Ionescu&#x27;s house on Bucharest&#x27;s Atena Street was ransacked and partly vandalized by German troops — Constantin Argetoianu recounted that this was accomplished &quot;methodically&quot;, and constituted &quot;an exception&quot; to the German administration&#x27;s &quot;scrupulous respect for private property&quot;. According to Take Ionescu himself, his lodging had been destroyed on special orders from August von Mackensen in December 1916 (he also contrasted this action with his promise to protect the property of former German ambassador, Hilmar von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen, after he had left Bucharest earlier in the same year).

He was brought to office as a Vice-Premier and Minister Secretary of State (Minister without portfolio), in a War Cabinet headed by the PNL&#x27;s leader Brătianu, serving between July 1917 and January 1918. According to Xeni, Ionescu&#x27;s advocacy of an Entente alliance had made him the target of intense criticism, at a time when the territory still controlled by Romanian authorities was suffering major hardships, and replied that &quot;war had to be made&quot;. At the same time, he and the premier agreed on the principles of electoral and land reform to be carried out in a future Romania, as the Conservatives appeared destined to lose appeal.

Romania ultimately signed a peace treaty with the Central Powers in 1918 — soon after, Ionescu received approval to leave for Paris and London. While passing through Ploieşti, his native city, he was reportedly booed by a crowd of opponents. After the Armistice with Germany, which signaled a change in fortunes, he began actively campaigning for the international recognition of Romania&#x27;s union with Transylvania as advanced by the Romanian National Party, creating the National Romanian Council, grouping politicians from several regions, many of whom had opposed the separate peace (these included the Transylvanians Octavian Goga and Vasile Lucaciu), and supporting an anti-Hungarian alliance of Balkan states that played a part in creating the Little Entente.

In December, Ionescu met with Venizelos and the Czechoslovak leader Tomáš Masaryk to discuss a common approach; expressing support for Eastern European alliances while commenting on the unresolved dispute involving Romania and the Kingdom of Serbia, Masaryk confided in Stephen Bonsal that: &quot;Solutions are still beyond our immediate reach, but I am confident that we have cleared ground for the co-operation at the Peace Conference&quot;.

Despite his intense activism, he was denied a presence in the Romanian delegation to the Conference, owing to his renewed conflict with Prime Minister Brătianu. This followed a major disagreement in policy, after the National Liberals decided not to accept all Allied resolution on principle, and instead to renegotiate Romania&#x27;s position on the international stage. In December 1919, answering to concerns that he was leading a risky path, Brătianu spoke out in Parliament against what he saw as demeaning &quot;the role [the Romanian people] should have in the world&quot;.

Following Bessie Ionescu&#x27;s death in a horse-riding accident, Ionescu married Alexandrina Ecaterina Woroniecki in 1919 (she was also known as &quot;Adina Olmazu&quot;). Also in that year, he published a volume of French-language essays and memoirs; going through an English edition, it was first published in Romania in 1923.

===Alliance with Averescu===
He returned to his country in autumn 1919, with a design to form a single political group of democratic persuasion, stressing Conservative accomplishments (such as selling state land to peasants and confiscating &quot;mainmorte&quot; estates), while aiming to persuade the PNL to back electoral reform. During his stay in Paris, while the main Conservative Party disintegrated, the PCD had itself suffered a major crisis; according to Ionescu&#x27;s rival and one-time political partner Constantin Argetoianu, Ionescu&#x27;s temporary residence on Calea Victoriei subsequently became a meeting place for various Conservative politicians (whom Argetoianu repeatedly described as &quot;Conservative wrecks&quot;).

Eventually, in 1919, Ionescu&#x27;s group formed an alliance with the newly created People&#x27;s League, headed by General Alexandru Averescu. Averescu, who was celebrated for his wartime command of the Romanian Army, shared several viewpoints with the PCD and, according to Argetoianu&#x27;s ironic version of events, &quot;a great, albeit undisclosed, spiritual affinity: they both belonged to the reptilian class&quot;. The alliance went through two stages: early in the year, the PCD signed an electoral pact with Averescu&#x27;s grouping — the People League&#x27;s Argetoianu, who led the talks, later indicated that he had sabotaged all possibility of an actual merger, believing it to be detrimental to his grouping; in autumn, the newly returned Ionescu met with the general to discuss a project for increased cooperation. At the time, Argetoianu indicated, Ionescu viewed himself as a favorite of the Allied governments, and, while maintaining close relations with Averescu, refused to discuss a fusion. Reportedly, Averescu unsuccessfully offered Ionescu the League&#x27;s presidency in exchange for being recognized as the main candidate for the premiership. The PCD leader changed his attitude as it became apparent that Averescu, who was appointed prime minister by Ferdinand, was set to win the elections, and, according to Constantin Argetoianu, had to allow Averescu the upper hand in the deal.

The PCD came to power following the landslide victory in the 1920 election (when the PCD won 17 seats in addition to the People Party&#x27;s 206). Take Ionescu was again brought to a cabinet position between 1920 and 1921, replacing Duiliu Zamfirescu as Foreign Minister in the Averescu cabinet. Argetoianu indicated that the PCD had not been part of the original cabinet makeup due to Averescu&#x27;s maneuvers: reportedly, the general presented his group as the main candidate in the elections, and allowed the Conservative-Democrats to have a share in government only after he was validated by the popular vote. Expanding on this issue, Argetoianu stated: &quot;Take Ionescu hoped to achieve popularity through his activity in Paris and thus impose himself either &quot;at the top&quot;, in spheres of the [Royal] Palace, or &quot;at the bottom&quot;, in the popular masses. Unfortunately for him, he found no &quot;vacant spot&quot; either up or down. At the top, Brătianu remained adamantly, as always, the person of trust, and at the bottom Averescu&#x27;s popularity, with its fetishistic character, allowed no one to present even the most limited of challenges. Take Ionescu, for all his merits and for all his intelligence, was doomed to continue his career as a &quot;trailer&quot; and hung on to Averescu, as his collaborator&quot;.

===Foreign Minister and premiership===
The appointment came at a time when his Little Entente project had already been fulfilled, and extended, from the Romanian perspective, through the alliance with the Second Polish Republic (&quot;see Polish–Romanian alliance&quot;). According to journalist Noti Constantinide, who visited him during his stay in Aix-les-Bains (March 1921), Ionescu, whom he called &quot;the most intelligent person I ever met&quot;, was actively promoting the Romanian and Little Entente causes, seeking to sway public opinion in Allied countries. Through Constantinide, Ionescu was informed that Charles, former Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, had decided in favor of secretly returning to Budapest and taking back one of his thrones; the information, according to Constantinide, was passed to him by an Austrian officer in Hungary&#x27;s service, who had decided to betray his superiors. The information proved accurate, but Ionescu reportedly dismissed similar news, received some time after, of Charles&#x27; planning a second such attempt — this was to be effected in October, and, although more successful than the March episode, it too ended in Charles&#x27; expulsion (&quot;see Charles IV of Hungary&#x27;s conflict with Miklós Horthy&quot;).

He began looking for an agreement with Bolshevist Russia over the issue of Bessarabia and the Romanian Treasure, but bilateral relations remained tense. Inside the cabinet, Ionescu successfully promoted Nicolae Titulescu (for the Finance portfolio) and Dimitrie Greceanu (for Public Works), but had to accept the former&#x27;s resignation in late 1920, after Titulescu cited irreconcilable differences in political ideology (declaring himself to be much more left-wing than his party&#x27;s chief) and reproached Ionescu the fact that he had intervened in financial affairs.

The Averescu executive, maneuvered by Brătianu and meeting with stiff opposition from the Romanian National, Peasants&#x27; and Democratic Nationalist parties, was ultimately brought down by Take Ionescu himself, through his resignation from office on 11 December 1921. This came as the project for land reform provoked a standoff in Parliament, after the PNL persuaded King Ferdinand that Averescu had to resign, and Ionescu agreed to induce an artificial crisis for the general to hand over his mandate.

Ionescu was ultimately prime minister for one month, from 17 December 1921, until 19 January 1922. In this capacity, he oversaw the marriage agreement between King Alexander I of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and Princess Maria. He resigned after a motion of no confidence, which Ferdinand hoped to see bringing Averescu back to power, but was instead faced with a new PNL majority, formed after the 1922 elections.

===Death===
While visiting Italy in summer 1922, Take Ionescu contracted typhoid fever, and died at a sanitarium on Rome&#x27;s Via Toscana (according to sources, he had contracted the disease while in Naples, having eaten an infected oyster, and fell ill while crossing into Sicily). The final diagnosis was &quot;typhic ulcerous aortitis and internal abdominal angina&quot;. The unusual circumstances of his illness provoked scientific interest, and, during the early 1920s, it was discussed in medical circles as the &quot;Take Ionescu disease&quot;.

Returning from the League of Nations in Geneva, Brătianu paid a visit to the moribund Ionescu, and reportedly acknowledged the merits of his Balkan projects (&quot;You were right, Mr. Ionescu. Having witnessed the chaos in Geneva, I had [instead] the opportunity of seeing of just how much help the creation and solidarity of the Little Entente has been to us&quot;).

The train transporting his remains was saluted by Serb officials when passing through their country, and received in Bucharest with the sirens of several locomotives blowing in unison (as a sign of respect). The casket, wrapped in the Romanian tricolor, was displayed in the Romanian Athenaeum building for several days. A public procession, led by King Ferdinand, accompanied the casket, placed on a caisson, down to Bucharest&#x27;s Gara de Nord, whence it was transported for burial in Sinaia (30 June 1922).

Ionescu was buried in the inner courtyard of Sinaia Monastery, inside a marble crypt having quotes from his speeches carved into its walls, and in the vicinity of a fir tree planted in 1848 by a group of Wallachian revolutionaries (one of whom was Ionescu&#x27;s ancestor Ion Heliade Rădulescu). The grave site had been previously donated by the Romanian state to Alexandrina Ecaterina Woroniecki.

==Legacy==

&quot;Spiritele anului 3000&quot;, authored when Ionescu was just 17, is thought to be one of the first works of science fiction in Romanian literature. Written as a first-person narrative and dream sequence, it depicts its author and main character falling into slumber and awaking on the close of the 30th century. The world he encounters is peopled by humans of a small stature, who reach full maturity at the age of 15. &quot;Spiritele anului 3000&quot; is part political satire and part political project. Humanity is unified into a single confederation of republics and administrated from &quot;Liberty&quot; (a completely new capital built up on an artificial island in the Mediterranean Sea), while monarchies and wars have disappeared altogether. Romania is set &quot;in her natural borders&quot; through the intervention of a Supreme Tribunal, while the Romanian language adopts a form to Ionescu&#x27;s liking (having shunned the more artificial etymology favored by Transylvanian intellectuals and the Romanian Academy alike). The Romanian climate is improved by afforestation, the country is spanned by canals, and the garden-like Bucharest, over which the narrator and Aru, his friend from the future, fly in a moored balloon, no longer has any churches left standing.

The Conservative-Democratic Party did not survive the death of its leader, and disbanded over the same year. According to his one-time political ally Octavian Goga, Ionescu &quot;concentrated within him the character of improvised Muntenian bourgeoisie&quot;. Praising him for his qualities while also contending that his discourse &quot;bordered on demagogy&quot;, Goga stated &quot;I do not believe, though, that he could have ever gone as far in a Western country or in a balanced country such as England&quot;. He described their relationship thus: &quot;He did all sorts of favors for me, he won me money loans, he promised me a ministry from the very beginning, he declared me &#x27;a genius&#x27; in his article for &quot;La Roumanie&quot;, — I nonetheless remained, in front of him, as I would remain in front of a woman who in vain tries to earn my love, as she does not project an image of moral responsibility&quot;.

Writing on the nomenclature used in the works of Ion Luca Caragiale, the literary critic Garabet Ibrăileanu noted the use and special meaning of pet forms. Commenting, among others, on the banality of the names &quot;Take&quot;/&quot;Tache&quot; and &quot;Ionescu&quot;, he contended that Ionescu had transported the moniker into general acceptance, out of the reach of its familiar connotations: &quot;«Take Ionescu» is utterly banal [...], but this name, due to the person who bore it, has gained through association a special prestige. This is why, if we were to see it today being used by a common Ionescu, the occurrence would seem comical to us&quot;. Expanding on this issue, he noted that both the derisive tone in Caragiale&#x27;s works and Ionescu&#x27;s career reflected, each in its own way, the growth in importance of a single social class, the &quot;national bourgeoisie&quot;.

Take Ionescu&#x27;s enduring admiration and support for countries in the Anglosphere and for the British Empire was reflected in contemporary popular culture. As Xeni indicated, Ionescu was depicted in satirical works either as an English &quot;sportsman&quot; or &quot;an immense cylinder wrapped up in the stars of the American flag&quot;). Ionescu&#x27;s popularity before and during World War I also made him the center of a cultural trend, and the subject of imitation. According to Tudor Arghezi, he was personally responsible for raising the prestige of Ştefan Luchian, an impoverished painter, being among the first ever to purchase more than one of the latter&#x27;s paintings.

The friendship between Ionescu and Eleftherios Venizelos left behind its own artistic legacy: in late 1913 or early 1915, the Ionescu residence in Bucharest was decorated with a stone bas-relief of the goddess Athena, which was inlaid into the masonry. Additionally, after Take Ionescu&#x27;s death, Venizelos donated a bloc of Parian marble to be used for the politician&#x27;s bust (ultimately placed inside the Chamber quarters on Mitropoliei Hill), and another marble bloc to be used for his grave in Sinaia Monastery.
Immediately after Ionescu&#x27;s 1913 mission to Greece, the street he lived on was renamed &quot;Atena&quot; (Romanian for &quot;Athens&quot;). A section of the present-day Magheru Boulevard in Bucharest was initially named in Ionescu&#x27;s honor. Undergoing a name change during the Communist period, a section of the former Atena Street was assigned the name &quot;Take Ionescu&quot; in the wake of the 1989 Revolution. Atena Street housed a large statue of Take Ionescu, the work of French sculptor Ernest Henri Dubois, depicting him standing alongside two female nudes, representing the ideal borders of Greater Romania (the Dniester and the Tisza), and pointing toward Transylvania. The monument was notably criticized by architectural historian Grigore Ionescu, who argued that it was &quot;an inferior replica of Ion Brătianu&#x27;s monument&quot;. (Both monuments were subsequently demolished by the communist authorities.)

Under the Communist regime, Alexandrina Ecaterina Woroniecki was allowed to continue residing in the house Ionescu had built for her in the proximity of Şoseaua Kiseleff, but had to share her lodging with a section of the Republican Art Museum, and was assigned a room on the underground floor.

<text>Vladimir Nikolayevich Ipatieff, also Ipatyev (; – 29 November 1952) was a Russian and American chemist. His most important contributions are in the field of petroleum chemistry and catalysts.

==Life and career==
Born in Moscow, Ipatieff first studied artillery in the Mikhailovskaya Artillery Academy in Petersburg, then later studied chemistry in Russia with Alexei Yevgrafovich Favorskii and in Germany. The prominence of his extended family is illustrated by the fact that the July 17, 1918, murders of Czar Nicholas Romanoff, the Empress and the rest of the royal family took place in the basement of a vacation house owned by the Ipatieff family in Ekaterinburg. His first works in chemistry were devoted to the study of metals and explosives. Later, his works on catalysis methods under high pressure made him famous as a chemist; for his reactions he used massive steel autoclaves (sometimes called Ipatieff bombs). With the start of World War I, Ipatieff organized a dedicated laboratory in Petersburg which made improvements to the chemical weaponry and the methods of chemical protection for the army. Before the October Revolution, Ipatieff was a General-Lieutenant of the Russian army and a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1916.

Although Ipatieff&#x27;s political sympathies were with the Kadet party, after the Bolshevik Revolution, he agreed to work with the new government, as a specialist adviser and inspector for Vesenka.
Ipatieff was active in creating and heading several important chemical research centers in Soviet Russia. Lenin called him &quot;the head of our [Soviet] chemical industry&quot;. He was chairman of the Scientific Technical Institute, in 1920-26, but was removed and relegated to the post of vice-chairman of the chemical section of Vesenkha - an early sign that he was coming under suspicion because of his connections with the pre-revolutionary regime. In 1928-29, when he was still the youngest member of the Academy of Sciences, he handled the negotiations which averted a conflict with the regime by admitting Nikolai Bukharin and some other communists to the Academy. At this time, however, Ipatieff was starting to feel threatened because of his past in the Czarist army and because he had friends among those convicted in the Industrial Party trial. In June 1930, Ipatieff, fearing that in time he would be victimized, withdrew a small amount of money from his accounts and prepared to attend an industry conference in Munich. He invited his wife to come with him, and at the last minute suggested she bring her jewels &quot;in the event that we go dancing.&quot; As the train came to the border into Poland, he announced to his wife, &quot;Dear, look back at Mother Russia. You will never see her again.&quot; Though he spoke not a word of English, he fled to the United States.

In the US, Ipatieff secured a research-focused chemistry professorship at Northwestern University, in the Chicago suburb of Evanston. There, with his assistant Herman Pines, he discovered alternative fuel mixtures and procedures that greatly enhanced engine performance. It is said that after changing to Ipatieff fuel mixtures, the RAF was able to best German planes that had previously outperformed the British. Increasingly, he devoted time to commercial applications of his breakthroughs in fuel chemistry, and worked extensively for UOP LLC (Universal Oil Products).

He and his students made significant contributions to organic synthesis and petroleum refining. He is considered one of the founding fathers of the modern petroleum chemistry in the US.

Vladimir Ipatieff had three sons: Dmitry, Nikolai and Vladimir. Dmitry died in World War I. Nikolai was a member of the White movement, emigrated after the end of Russian Civil War and died in Africa testing a treatment he had invented for yellow fever. Vladimir Vladimirovich Ipatieff, also a talented chemist, remained in the USSR and was punitively arrested after the defection of his father. While living in the USA, the Ipatieffs also adopted two Russian girls.

Ipatieff died suddenly in Chicago in 1952. He held over 200 patents and published over 300 research papers.

==Ipatieff Prize==
The American Chemical Society received a large endowment owing to UOP and eventually in turn established an award called the Ipatieff Prize. Awarded every three years, the Ipatieff Prize honors outstanding experimental work in the field of catalysis or high-pressure chemistry by researchers under the age of 40.

<text>Consolida is a genus of about 40 species of annual flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native to western Europe, the Mediterranean and Asia. Phylogenetic studies show that &quot;Consolida&quot; is actually an annual clade nested within the genus &quot;Delphinium&quot; and it has been treated as a synonym of &quot;Delphinium&quot; in Kew&#x27;s Plants of the World Online. The name of the genus comes from an archaic use of &quot;consolidation&quot;, meaning &quot;healing&quot;, in reference to the plant&#x27;s medieval use for healing wounds.

&quot;Consolida&quot; differs from other species of &quot;Delphinium&quot; (mostly perennials) in the flower structure, with only one united petal, rather than the four separate petals (or more in cultivars) found in other delphiniums, and in the fruit, which comprises a single follicle, instead of a cluster of 3–5 together.

It is a popular garden plant and cut flower, grown from seed every year, with numerous cultivars in shades of pink, blue, purple and white. In seed catalogues it is usually labelled as larkspur, a common name referring to the shape of the spurred calyx, with &quot;delphinium&quot; reserved for its perennial relatives.

<text>1234–1289 also known as Zuien was a Japanese Buddhist itinerant preacher (&quot;hijiri&quot;) who founded the branch of Pure Land Buddhism.

==Life==
Ippen was born at Hōgon-ji, a temple in Iyo Province (modern Ehime Prefecture) on the island of Shikoku. He was originally named . He first studied Tendai at Mount Hiei, Kyoto, and then Jōdo-shū at Dazaifu, Fukuoka on Kyushu.

When his father died, the 25-year old Ippen returned to secular life and assumed family responsibilities. He got married and became head of the household.

During a pilgrimage to the Kumano Shrines, the kami enshrined there revealed to Ippen that enlightenment was determined by Amitābha and that Ippen should devote himself to preaching the importance of reciting his name, a practice called nembutsu. Ippen and a band of followers then travelled throughout the country proselytizing with their ecstatic &quot;nembutsu&quot; dance, and won a wide following among common people. Other practices associated with the Ji-shū include scheduled sessions of chanting (hence the name &quot;Ji-shū&quot; &quot;Time sect&quot;), the handing out of slips of paper with the &quot;nembutsu&quot; written on them, and keeping a register of the converted.

Ippen&#x27;s insistence on constant traveling and giving up of family and possessions led to his nicknames: and .

Ippen&#x27;s doctrine was primarily influenced by Shōkū, founder of the Seizan branch of the Jōdo-shū, who &quot;insisted that the various Buddhist practices contain no more than a portion of the merit of the single practice of the nembutsu and serve merely to lead people to recite the nembutsu.&quot; However he was also strongly influenced by the nondualism of Zen and even received Dharma transmission as a Zen master from Rōshi Kakushin.

== Legacy ==
Before his death Ippen burned all his writings, saying that &quot;they have all become &quot;namuamidabutsu&quot; (devotion to Amida Buddha)&quot;, but copies were kept by some of his disciples. Dennis Hirota has translated some of these writings into English in &quot;No Abode: The Record of Ippen&quot; (1997).

After Ippen&#x27;s death many of his disciples appear to have committed suicide, throwing themselves into the sea in the hope of being reborn in the Pure Land. Such phenomena perhaps help to explain the limited spread of the Ji-shu, and the ecstatic fervor of the early Ji-shu also seems to have militated against mainstream acceptance.

In 1292, three years after Ippen&#x27;s death, Ippen&#x27;s birthplace, Hōgon-ji, was rebuilt by his disciple Sen&#x27;a and became a Ji sect temple.

== Art ==

Ippen himself was greatly devoted to paintings of Shandao&#x27;s allegory of the &quot;White Path&quot;, so it is appropriate that his life led to the production of a great many portraits, sculpted images, and illustrated narrative scrolls (&quot;emaki&quot; 絵巻).

The &quot;Ippen Hijiri-e&quot; (一遍聖絵) was edited by Ippen&#x27;s disciple Shōkai (聖戒) and, according to an inscription dated 1299, was painted by the artist En&#x27;i (円伊) (Kankikō-ji 歓喜光寺, Kyoto, and Tokyo National Museum). The twelve handscrolls on silk show Ippen&#x27;s trip around Japan, and are well known for their naturalistic depiction of &quot;famous places&quot;, including Mount Fuji (富士), Kumano, Shitennō-ji (四天王寺), Zenkō-ji (善光寺), Enoshima (江ノ島), Yoshino (吉野), Itsukushima (厳島), and Naruto (鳴門). The treatment of space shows the influence of Song and Yuan Chinese landscape painting. A second type of biographical handscroll &quot;Ippen Shōnin Engi-e&quot; 一遍上人縁起絵), edited by Ippen&#x27;s other disciple, Sōshun (宗俊), was painted sometime between 1304 and 1307. The original scrolls no longer exist but were copied in many other versions including those at Shinkō-ji (真光寺), Hyōgo Prefecture. These versions are characterized by the addition of the biography of Ippen&#x27;s most important disciple, Taa (他阿, 1237–1319). In the Shinkō-ji version, the first four scrolls depict Ippen&#x27;s life, while the last six concern the life of Taa and the spread of Ji Sect teaching. The Kinren-ji (金蓮寺) in Kyoto has a Muromachi period copy of the now-lost work dated 1307.

<text>Ernest L. Ipsen (1869-1951) was an American painter specializing in portraiture. He painted hundreds of portraits commissioned by institutions of government, education, religion, and commerce who wanted to commemorate their associates. His subjects include architect Cass Gilbert, General Robert E. Lee, statesman Elihu Root, publisher George Arthur Plimpton, actor Otis Skinner, politician Edith Nourse Rogers, and Chief Justice William Howard Taft. His portrait of Maurice Francis Egan, Minister to Denmark under three U.S. presidents, was presented to the King and Queen of Denmark. He also painted landscapes and seascapes, particularly along the New England coast.

==Early life and education==
Ipsen was born September 5, 1869, in Malden, Massachusetts to Ludvig Sandöe Ipsen (1840–1920) and Emma Petrea Ipsen (, 1846–1914). His father, an architect and designer, and his mother, a singer, were both natives of Copenhagen, Denmark.
He studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston from 1884 to 1887, under the tutelage of portrait painter Frederic Porter Vinton, who may have influenced his choice to pursue portraiture. He continued his training at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts (where his father had studied architecture) from 1887 to 1891. His instructors there included Carl Bloch. He won a prize for figure studies and a scholarship in life painting.

==Career==

Following his study in Copenhagen, Ipsen returned to Massachusetts, establishing a studio in Boston&#x27;s Harcourt Studio building, where he remained from 1900 to 1904. Ipsen eventually moved to New York, where he established a studio on 19th Street. Ipsen would continue to work out of the National Arts Club Studio on 19th Street until 1934, when he moved to South Dartmouth, Massachusetts.

His work was widely praised for its &quot;sincere, honest statements of personality&quot; and he &quot;would be the choice for a serious, carefully considered portrait without dash or technical bravura of any sort, whose very seriousness brings with it both charm of style and surface.&quot;

==Personal life==
On June 15, 1908, Ipsen married Edith Boyden Crocker of Brookline, Massachusetts. They had one daughter, Edith Valborg Ipsen, who was born on April 11, 1909, and died three days later. At the time they were living in Boston&#x27;s Fenway Studios where Ipsen had moved after the Harcourt Studios building burned down in 1904, destroying not only his home but also paintings stored there. The Ipsens spent winters in Boston and later, New York, and summers at a home they bought in Nonquitt, a section of South Dartmouth on the Massachusetts coast. After an automobile accident in 1938 which seriously impaired Mrs. Ipsen&#x27;s health, they sold the Nonquitt property and moved to Coconut Grove, Florida, although they still returned north, to New Brunswick, Canada, in the summer.

Edith Ipsen died on January 20, 1948. Ernest Ipsen continued to paint his friends and neighbors, lecture and exhibit locally in Florida until his death in 1951. They are interred at the Walnut Hills Cemetery in Brookline.

<text>Patricia Ireland (born October 19, 1945) is an American administrator and feminist. She served as president of the National Organization for Women from 1991 to 2001 and published an autobiography, &quot;What Women Want&quot;, in 1996.

== Early life ==
Ireland was born on October 19, 1945, in Oak Park, Illinois. Her parents were James Ireland, a metallurgical engineer, and Joan Filipek, a volunteer counselor at Planned Parenthood. She grew up in Valparaiso, Indiana, and graduated from Valparaiso High School at the age of sixteen in 1962. She began studying at DePauw University and married Don Anderson, a student at Ball State University, and the couple transferred to the University of Tennessee. She quickly divorced her first husband and received her bachelor&#x27;s degree from the university in 1966. She received a J.D. degree from the University of Miami School of Law in 1975. She also attended Florida State University College of Law.

== Career ==
Before beginning a career as an attorney, Ireland worked as a flight attendant for Pan Am. After discovering gender-based discrepancies in the treatment of insurance coverage for spouses of employees, Ireland fought successfully for a change in coverage. Knowing that ignorance of the law was a disadvantage, she immediately began law school and performing volunteer work for the National Organization for Women (NOW). She moved to Washington, DC, as an elected officer of NOW. Ireland advocated extensively for the rights of poor women, gays and lesbians, and African-American women. She has also advocated electing female candidates, and training people to defend clinics from anti-abortion protesters around the United States. Ireland became the president of NOW in 1991. She ran for re-election in 1993, winning with 671 votes against Efia Nwangaza, who received 235 votes.

Immediately following Ireland&#x27;s appointment to president of NOW, questions arose about her sexual orientation. On December 17, 1991, she gave an interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot;, in which she states that she had a female companion while remaining married to her second husband. She published a book, &quot;What Women Want&quot;, in 1996.

In 2003, Ireland served for six months as the CEO of the YWCA. In October 2003, Ireland was dismissed after refusing to step down, although YWCA spokespeople denied that conservative pressure was a factor in the decision. Following her dismissal from the YWCA, Ireland was former Senator Carol Moseley Braun&#x27;s national campaign manager for her brief 2004 presidential bid.

Ireland returned to Miami and resumed practicing law, representing unions and their members until her retirement in 2023.

<doc id="738497" wikidata="Q837601" url="?curid=738497" title="Kam Sheung Road station">
<text>Kam Sheung Road () is an MTR station on the , located between Pat Heung and Kam Tin in Hong Kong. It is situated between Tsuen Wan West and Yuen Long stations. Kam Sheung Road was the location for the KCR West Rail&#x27;s opening ceremony.

==History==
On 20 December 2003, Kam Sheung Road station opened to the public along with other KCR West Rail stations.

On 27 June 2021, the officially merged with the (which was already extended into the &quot;Tuen Ma line Phase 1&quot; at the time) in East Kowloon to form the new , as part of the Shatin to Central link project. Kam Sheung Road was included in the project and is now an intermediate station on the Tuen Ma line.

==Description==
The station is an elevated structure along the viaduct to the north of one of the two rail depots of the Tuen Ma line. The MTR Kam Tin Building is just north of the station building and once housed the West Rail control centre, but the facility relocated to the main MTR control centre in Tsing Yi after the railway merger.

The station itself is a short distance from the towns of Kam Tin or Pat Heung. As residents from nearby could not decide upon the name of the settlement that the station would be named after, the main road nearest to the station was used instead.

Although the station was not expected to have high passenger patronage relative to others, the station attracted a number of villagers from Kam Tin and Pat Heung since the Tuen Ma line is their only direct link to urban areas in Kowloon. If the (to Lok Ma Chau) is built, Kam Sheung Road will serve as the interchange with the Northern Link, and the station will be expanded as well.

There is a flea market beside the station building with more than 150 stalls. From 26 September to 28 November 2004, the West Rail Sightseeing Bus was introduced, attracting thousands of Kowloon residents.

The station is close to the Shek Kong Airfield. 

==Future expansion==
Kam Sheung Road is planned to be one of the terminus station on the , a proposed MTR rapid transit line which would connect the and the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line of the . The link would also serve as a connection to the border checkpoints to mainland China while also facilitating travels between Eastern and Western New Territories. The Northern Link would end at Lok Ma Chau and Kwu Tung, with intermediate stations. The project is under development.

==Station layout==
Platforms 1 and 2 share the same island platform. Although the train tracks are exposed from above, platform screen doors are still fitted.

<text>Howrah (; ; alternatively spelled as Haora) is a city in the Indian state of West Bengal, located on the western bank of the Hooghly River, opposite to its twin city of Kolkata. Administratively Howrah lies within Howrah district and is the headquarters of the Howrah Sadar subdivision; it is also part of the area covered by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). Howrah is an important industrial and transportation hub, and is also a gateway to Kolkata (and the rest of West Bengal) via Howrah railway station and Howrah Bridge.

==Etymology==
The name came from the word &quot;Haor&quot;—Bengali word for a fluvial swampy lake, which is sedimentologically a depression where water, mud and organic debris accumulate. The word itself was rather used in eastern part of Bengal (now Bangladesh), as compared to the western part (now West Bengal).

==History==
The history of the city of Howrah dates back over 500 years, but the district is situated in an area historically occupied by the ancient Bengali kingdom of Bhurshut. Venetian explorer Cesare Federici, who travelled in India during 1565–79, mentioned a place called &quot;Buttor&quot; in his journal circa 1578. As per his description, this was a location into which large ships could travel (presumably the Hoogli river) and perhaps a commercial port. This place is identifiable with the modern day neighbourhood of Bator. Bator was also mentioned in the Bengali poetry &quot;Manasamangal&quot; written by Bipradas Pipilai in 1495.

In 1713, the Bengal Council of the British East India Company, on the accession of the Emperor Farrukhsiyar, grandson of Aurangzeb, to the throne of Delhi, sent a deputation to him with a petition for a settlement of five villages on west bank of Hooghly river along with thirty-three villages on the east bank. The list of villages appeared in the Consultation Book of the Council dated 4 May 1714. The five villages on the west bank on Hooghly river were: &#x27;Salica&#x27; (Salkia), &#x27;Harirah&#x27; (Howrah), &#x27;Cassundeah&#x27; (Kasundia), &#x27;Ramkrishnopoor&#x27; (Ramkrishnapur) and &#x27;Battar&#x27; (Bator): all identifiable with localities of modern-day Howrah city. The deputation was successful except for these five villages. By 1728, most of the present-day Howrah district was part of either of the two zamindaris: Burdwan or Muhammand Aminpur.

On 11 October 1760, as a result of the Battle of Plassey, the East India Company signed a treaty with Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Bengal, to take over the control of Howrah district. In 1787 the Hooghly district was formed and in 1819 the whole of the present day Howrah district was added to it. The Howrah district was separated from the Hooghly district in 1843.

==Demographics==

Howrah is 2nd most populated city in West Bengal (behind Kolkata). Indian census, Howrah had a population of with households.

In the 1896 census of British India, Howrah had a population of , which grew to in the 1901 census. This rapid growth was due to abundance of job opportunities, which resulted in a 100% increase in male population during this period, whereas the female population grew only by 60%.
==Geography==
===Climate===
Howrah has a Tropical wet-and-dry climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;). The summers here have a good deal of rainfall, while the winters have very little. The temperature averages 26.3 °C. Precipitation averages 1744 mm.

Howrah has been ranked 40th best &quot;National Clean Air City&quot; (under Category 1 &gt;10L Population cities) in India.

==Civic administration==
Howrah Municipal Corporation is responsible for the administration of Howrah. The tenure of the last board of HMC had ended back on 10 December 2018. From then onwards the corporation has been run by unelected board of administrators selected by the West Bengal government. The Howrah City Police is responsible for law enforcement in the city.

===History===

Howrah Municipality was established in 1862. From 1896, it started supplying filter water across the city. During 1882–83, Bally Municipality was formed separating it out from Howrah. As per the &quot;Howrah Municipal Corporation Act of 1980&quot;, Howrah became a municipal corporation in 1984. The corporation area was divided into fifty wards, each of which elects a councillor. The Mayor-in-council, which is led by Mayor and supported by Commissioner and officers, is responsible for administration of the corporation area. In 2015, the Bally Municipality was re-amalgamated into Howrah Municipal Corporation, through Corporation vide notification no. 428/MA/O/C-4/IM-36/2014 dated 26 June 2015, which increased the total number of wards to 66.

===Other administrative offices===
Howrah also hosts the temporary administrative office of the state of West Bengal. The office of the Chief Minister of state had been traditionally posted at the Writers&#x27; Building, however owing to renovation of the building, the administration has been occupying the Nabanna building.

==Development and growth==
Even though it is one of the largest cities in the state, Howrah witnessed urbanisation in an unplanned manner. As a result, Howrah is continuing to face its perennial problems like traffic congestion, population explosion and pollution.

The city contains a few unlicensed and unregulated residential areas or slums. The name of the novel City of Joy, which has been often the name the Kolkata metropolis been called, is actually based on one such slum of Howrah.

However, recently, work has been done on broadening the National Highways and several local roads. These activities are expected to help in improvement of traffic conditions. Of late, Howrah has seen a lot of new industrial proposals like the Kona Truck Terminus, Kolkata West International City and relocation of the old smoky foundry plants.. The West Bengal Government has also planned a major renovation of the city to match the city&#x27;s urban facilities with its neighbouring city Kolkata.

<doc id="738505" wikidata="Q335248" url="?curid=738505" title="Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside">
<text>Field Marshal William Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside, (6 May 1880 – 22 September 1959) was a senior officer of the British Army who served as Chief of the Imperial General Staff during the first year of the Second World War.

Ironside joined the Royal Artillery in 1899, and served throughout the Second Boer War. This was followed by a brief period spying on the German colonial forces in South-West Africa. Returning to regular duty, he served on the staff of the 6th Infantry Division during the first two years of the First World War, before being appointed to a position on the staff of the newly raised 4th Canadian Division in 1916. In 1918, he was given command of a brigade on the Western Front. In 1919, he was promoted to command the Allied intervention force in northern Russia. Ironside was then assigned to an Allied force occupying Turkey, and then to the British forces based in Persia in 1921. He was offered the post of the commander of British forces in Iraq, but was unable to take up the role due to injuries in a flying accident.

He returned to the Army as Commandant of the Staff College, Camberley, where he advocated the ideas of a close friend, J. F. C. Fuller, who was a proponent of mechanisation. He later commanded a division, and military districts in both Britain and India, but his youth and his blunt approach limited his career prospects, and after being passed over for the role of Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) in 1937 he became Governor of Gibraltar, a traditional staging post to retirement. He was recalled from &quot;exile&quot; in mid-1939, being appointed as Inspector-General of Overseas Forces, a role which led most observers to expect he would be given the command of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the outbreak of war.

However, after some political manoeuvring, General Gort was given this command and Ironside was appointed as the new Chief of the Imperial General Staff. Ironside himself believed that he was temperamentally unsuited to the job, but felt obliged to accept it. In early 1940 he argued heavily for Allied intervention in Scandinavia, but this plan was shelved at the last minute when the Finnish-Soviet Winter War ended. During the invasion of Norway and the Battle of France he played little part; his involvement in the latter was limited by a breakdown in relations between him and Gort. He was replaced as CIGS at the end of May, and given a role to which he was more suited: Commander-in-Chief Home Forces, responsible for anti-invasion defences and for commanding the Army in the event of German landings. However, he served less than two months in this role before being replaced. After this, Ironside was promoted to Field Marshal and raised to the peerage as Baron Ironside.

Lord Ironside retired to Morley Old Hall in Norfolk to write, and never again saw active service or held any official position.

Shortly before being dismissed in 1940, Ironside had been named as a future military dictator for a potential fascist coup against Britain intended to take place when Germany landed in Britain. While neither his involvement nor even his knowledge of the plot were ever conclusively proven, J.F.C. Fuller, a confirmed conspirator, told another conspirator that &quot;Ironside is with us.&quot;

==Early life==
Ironside was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 6 May 1880 to Surgeon-Major William Ironside (1836-1881) of the Royal Horse Artillery and Emma Maria (1845-1939), daughter of William Haggett Richards. His father died shortly afterwards, leaving his widowed wife to bring up their son on a limited military pension. As the cost of living in the late nineteenth century was substantially lower in mainland Europe than in Britain, she travelled extensively around the Continent, where the young Edmund began learning various foreign languages. This grasp of language would become one of the defining features of his character; by middle age, he was fluent enough to officially interpret in seven, and was proficient in perhaps ten more.

He was educated at schools in St Andrews before being sent to Tonbridge School in Kent for his secondary education; at the age of sixteen he left Tonbridge to attend a crammer, having not shown much academic promise, and was admitted to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in January 1898 at the age of seventeen. At Woolwich he flourished, working hard at his studies and his sports; he took up boxing, and captained the rugby 2nd XV as well as playing for Scotland. He was built for both of these sports, six feet four inches tall and weighing seventeen stone (108 kg), for which he was nicknamed &quot;Tiny&quot; by his fellow students. The name stuck, and he was known by it for the rest of his life.

==Second Boer War==
After attending the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich he was commissioned into the army as a second lieutenant with the Royal Field Artillery on 25 June 1899. Later that year his unit, 44th Battery, RFA, was despatched to South Africa. He fought throughout the Second Boer War being wounded three times, and was mentioned in despatches in 1901. He was also promoted lieutenant on 16 February 1901.

At the end of the war in May 1902, he was a member of the small force which escorted Jan Smuts to the peace negotiations. He then disguised himself as an Afrikaans-speaking Boer, taking a job as a wagon driver working for the German colonial forces in South West Africa. This intelligence work ended unsuccessfully when he was identified, but managed to escape. This escapade later led to claims that he became the model for Richard Hannay, a character in the novels of John Buchan; Ironside was always amused by these novels when reading about &quot;Mr Standfast&quot; in the implausibly romantic setting of the passenger seat of an open-cockpit biplane flying from Iraq to Persia. He left Cape Town on the HMT &quot;Britannic&quot; in early October 1902, and arrived at Southampton later the same month.

Ironside was subsequently posted to India, where he served with I Battery Royal Horse Artillery (RHA), and South Africa, with Y Battery RHA. He was promoted to captain in February 1908, appointed to the Staff in September of the same year, and then as a Brigade-Major in June 1909. He returned home in September 1912, in order to attend the Staff College, Camberley.

==First World War==

Ironside&#x27;s two-year course at the Staff College, which he found unstimulating, was cut short by the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914; on 5 August, he was confirmed in his appointment as a Staff Captain, and assigned to Boulogne-sur-Mer and then St. Nazaire, both large Army bases supporting the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). By some accounts, he was one of the first British officers to arrive in France. He was promoted to major and attached to the newly arrived 6th Division at the end of October 1914, ranked as a General Staff Officer, Grade 3 (GSO3).

He was promoted to temporary lieutenant-colonel and appointed GSO1 in March 1916. He had expected to be made GSO1 – Divisional Chief of Staff – to the 6th Division, but to his surprise he was assigned to the newly formed 4th Canadian Division. Ironside pushed for a hard training regime, intending to get the division to the front as quickly as possible and prevent it being broken up to feed reinforcements to the other three divisions of the Canadian Corps. Because of the inexperience of the divisional commander, Major-General David Watson – a volunteer soldier with little professional experience – he found himself almost commanding the division on occasions, noting in his memoirs that Watson regularly authorised Ironside&#x27;s orders in his name. On its arrival in France in late 1916, the division participated at the end of the Battle of the Somme, before being moved north to prepare for the attack at Vimy Ridge. During the final phase of the fighting at Vimy, Ironside again was required to take unofficial command of the division, overruling an ambiguous order from Watson – who was out of contact at headquarters – to halt the attack, and personally ordering the leading battalions into action. 

He remained with the division through 1917, when it fought at the Battle of Passchendale, and in January 1918 was appointed to an administrative posting, as commandant of the Small Arms School, with the rank of acting colonel. He quickly returned to the Western Front, however, when he was appointed to command the 2nd Division&#x27;s 99th Brigade as a temporary brigadier-general at the end of March.

==Russia and Iran==

Ironside remained with 99th Brigade for only six months; in September 1918, he was attached to the Allied Expeditionary Force fighting the Bolsheviks in northern Russia, and in November given command of the force, retaining his temporary rank of Brigadier-General. This was his first independent command, and he threw himself fully into it; for over a year, he travelled continually along the Northern Dvina to keep control of his scattered international forces, at one point narrowly escaping assassination. However, the Red Army managed eventually to gain a superior position in the Civil War and in late 1919 he was forced to abandon the White Army to their fate. In November he handed command over to Henry Rawlinson, who would supervise the eventual withdrawal, and returned to Britain. Ironside was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, and promoted to substantive major-general for his efforts; this made him one of the youngest Major-Generals in the British Army.

In early 1920 he commanded a military mission which supervised the withdrawal of Romanian Forces left in Hungary after the Hungarian–Romanian War of 1919, and in the summer was attached to the force occupying İzmit, Turkey, as it prepared to withdraw. His third overseas posting of the year was to Persia in late August. The precise level of British involvement in Reza Khan&#x27;s coup remains a matter of historical debate, but it is almost certain that Ironside himself at least provided advice to the plotters. On his departure from Persia in 1921, the Shah awarded him the Order of the Lion and the Sun.

After Persia, he attended the Cairo Conference, where Winston Churchill persuaded him to take command of the newly reorganised British force in Iraq; however, returning to Persia in April, the aircraft he was flying in crashed and he was invalided home after several months in hospital.

==Interwar period==
After recovering from his injuries on half-pay, Ironside returned to active duty as Commandant of the Staff College in May 1922. He spent a full four-year term there, running the college efficiently as well as publishing several articles and a book on the Battle of Tannenberg. Most importantly for his future career, he became the mentor of J. F. C. Fuller, who was appointed a lecturer at the College at the same time, and became a close acquaintance of Sir Basil Liddell-Hart. Fuller&#x27;s views were deeply influential on Ironside, who became a supporter of reforming the Army as an elite armoured force with air support, and of forming a single central Ministry of Defence to control the services. He argued frequently over the need for faster modernisation and rearmament, and the problem of the &#x27;old men&#x27; still filling the upper ranks of the army; in the end, he was reprimanded by the chief of the imperial general staff (CIGS), General Sir George Milne.

After Camberley he was appointed to command the 2nd Division in England, a post he held for two years with little effect or interest – he was frustrated by the task of training an infantry force with no modern equipment – and then sent to command the Meerut district, in India, in 1928. He enjoyed life in India, but found the military situation to be equally uninteresting; the equipment was old-fashioned, as were the regimental officers and the overall strategic plans. He was promoted to lieutenant-general in March 1931, and left for England in May, where he returned to half-pay with the sinecure of Lieutenant of the Tower of London. He was then posted to India as Quartermaster-General in 1933, where he travelled extensively, crossing the country to visit regiments and oversee the Indianisation process. For all this, however, it was the best of a bad job; he was still far from the War Office, and unable to make significant impact on the army&#x27;s preparation for a future war.

==Preparation for war==
He returned home in 1936, recently promoted to full General, to lead Eastern Command, one of the corps-level regional commands in the United Kingdom, responsible for a single Regular division and three Territorial Army divisions. Here, he realised that a European War would come sooner rather than later, and that the Army was in a parlous state to defend the country. However, he found that as with his earlier posts, he could achieve little in Eastern Command – the most important decisions being made in Whitehall. He himself seemed to lose his opportunity for higher office in 1937, when he was rebuked over his mishandling of a mobile force in the annual exercises; until this point, he had been considered a possible candidate as Chief of the Imperial General Staff, but was dropped from consideration in favour of Lord Gort, whom Ironside considered unfit for the job. The Secretary of State for War, Leslie Hore-Belisha, gave him official notice that he was deemed too old for the post, aged 57. Thus, he was appointed an aide-de-camp to HM the King in October, a purely ceremonial position, and early in 1938 accepted the offer of Governor of Gibraltar, generally seen as a quiet role where to retire.

He was helped to accept Gibraltar by the suggestion that, in the event of war, he could be transferred to command the forces in the Middle East; as he believed no major force could usefully be sent to France, this seemed to him likely to be the main focus of British attention in the war. He took up the governorship in November 1938, and threw himself into preparing the colony for war; here, finally, he had free rein. Under his tenure, the defences were strengthened and the garrison prepared for a long siege.

In December 1938, only a month after he had taken up the post, Hore-Belisha had begun to consider the possibility of recalling Ironside to become Inspector-General of Overseas Forces. The position gave him overall responsibility for the readiness of forces based outside the United Kingdom, and many at the War Office worried that he might interpret this as a precursor to being given formal command of the Expeditionary Force on the outbreak of war. However, after some debate, Hore-Belisha went ahead and offered Ironside the position in May, appointing a corresponding Inspector-General of Home Forces at the same time, both under Lord Gort&#x27;s command. The decision to recall Ironside may have been helped by the fact that Hore-Belisha was particularly reliant on the advice of Liddell Hart, an old acquaintance of Ironside&#x27;s, who was already beginning to fall out with Gort.

As expected, Ironside chose to interpret the posting as indicating that he was the presumptive Commander-in-Chief, and soon began to clash with Lord Gort over their respective powers. Whilst Gort was nominally in the more senior position, Ironside had seniority of rank and a far more dominant personality, and had concluded several months earlier that Gort was &quot;out of his depth&quot; as CIGS; he is unlikely to have shown much deference. He held the post of Inspector for a few months, visiting Poland in July 1939 to meet with the Polish High Command. Whilst his sympathetic manner reassured the Poles, the visit may have unintentionally given the impression that Britain was intending to provide direct military assistance. He returned able to report that the Polish Government was unlikely to provoke Germany into war, but warned that the country would be quickly overrun and that no Eastern Front was likely to exist for long. His warnings, however, were broadly ignored.

==Second World War==
His appointment on 3 September 1939 as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) came as something of a surprise to Ironside; he had been led to believe he would be appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), and indeed had already despatched his Assistant to Aldershot to begin preparing his headquarters. The reorganisation was politically driven; Hore-Belisha had fallen out heavily with Viscount Gort during 1939, and the outbreak of war provided an excellent pretext for Gort to leave Whitehall. This left the post of CIGS vacant, and after heavy lobbying by Churchill, Ironside was chosen over Sir John Dill, then the General Officer Commanding, Aldershot Command.

As CIGS, Ironside adopted a policy of rapidly building up a strong force in France, aiming to put some twenty divisions in the field. However, this force would be broadly defensive, acting to support the French Army, and he aimed to influence the course of the war by forming a second strong force in the Middle East, which would be able to operate in peripheral operations in the Balkans. He strongly supported the development of a close-support air force, preferably under Army command, but at the same time argued that when a German offensive began in the West, the Royal Air Force (RAF) should throw its main strength into strategic bombing of the Ruhr rather than attacking the forward units.

===Norway===
Ironside&#x27;s enthusiasm for &quot;peripheral&quot; operations led him to plans for Allied intervention in Scandinavia; rather than the limited approach of simply mining Norwegian waters to stop Swedish iron-ore shipments to Germany, he argued for landing a strong force in northern Norway and physically occupying the Swedish orefields. If successful, this would allow the resupply of Finland – then fighting the Soviet Union, and aligned loosely with the Allied forces – as well as interdicting Germany&#x27;s ore supply, and could potentially force Germany to commit troops on a new and geographically unfavourable front. Both Ironside and Churchill supported the plan enthusiastically, but it met with opposition from many other officers, including from Gort – who saw his forces in France being depleted of resources – and from Cyrill Newall, the Chief of the Air Staff.

Planning continued through the winter of 1939–1940, and by March 1940 a force of around three divisions was prepared to sail. On 12 March, however, Finland sued for peace, and the expedition had to be abandoned.
Following the German invasion of Norway in April 1940 as part of Operation Weserübung, the Norwegian campaign of April–June 1940 saw significant British forces committed to action for the first time in the Second World War. Flaws in the command system quickly began to show. War Cabinet meetings dragged on at great length to little effect, as did meetings of the Chiefs of Staff, both to Ironside&#x27;s great frustration. He also found it hard to cope with Churchill&#x27;s mood swings and insistence on micromanagement of the campaign, and a gulf began to grow between the two. Ironside&#x27;s main contribution to resolving the Norwegian campaign was to insist on a withdrawal when the situation worsened, and he pushed through the evacuation of central Norway at the end of April despite ministerial ambivalence.
===Battle of France===
Ironside himself was sent to France in May 1940 to liaise with the BEF and the French in an attempt to halt the German advance. He was not well-qualified for this task, having a deep dislike and distrust for the French, whom he considered &quot;absolutely unscrupulous in everything&quot;. At a conference in Lens he clashed with the French Generals Billotte and Blanchard, whom he considered defeatists. He wrote: &quot;I lost my temper and shook Billotte by the button of his tunic. The man is completely defeated.&quot; Although Billotte was supposed to be co-ordinating the British, French and Belgian armies&#x27; operations in Belgium, Ironside took over the job himself, ordering Gort and Blanchard to launch a counter-attack against the Germans at Arras. This attack achieved some local success, but the German onslaught proved unstoppable. The French Commander-in-Chief, General Maxime Weygand, so resented Ironside&#x27;s actions that he said he would &quot;like to box Ironside&#x27;s ears.&quot; Ironside, despairing of the French Army&#x27;s unwillingness to fight, accepted Gort&#x27;s view that evacuation of the BEF was the only answer.

===Home Defence===
In his diary on the afternoon of 25 May, Ironside wrote that &quot;I am now concentrating upon the Home Defence ... [The Cabinet] want(s) a change to some man well-known in England. They are considering my appointment&quot;. That night, he spoke to Churchill, offering to take up the new post, and – again from his diary:

His appointment as Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces was announced to the public on 27 May, succeeding General Sir Walter Kirke. At the same time Ironside was succeeded as CIGS by his deputy, Sir John Dill. In his new command, Ironside commanded a force which amounted – on paper – to fifteen Territorial Infantry divisions, a single armoured division, fifty-seven home-defence battalions, and the Local Defence Volunteers (later the Home Guard). However, all of these were deficient in training and organisation, as the operational units had already been sent to France. They were also lacking in equipment; the force as a whole had almost no modern artillery or anti-tank guns, and the armoured division had just a small number of light tanks.

The deficiencies with equipment led to an overall lack of mobility, which coupled with the limited training of the units meant that very few were capable of organised offensive counter-attacks against an invading force. As a result, the only way they could practically be used would be to commit them to static defence; Ironside planned to steadily pull units away from the coast and into a central mobile reserve, but this was not possible until they were trained and equipped for the role. He threw himself into the details of the strategy, laying out plans for the static defence of village strongpoints by the Home Guard, patrols of &quot;Ironsides&quot; armoured cars to strengthen the divisions, and light artillery mounted on trucks as improvised tank destroyers.

He agreed to release two divisions for the Second BEF in early June, but was dubious about Churchill&#x27;s decision to bring home troops from the Middle East and India; even after the fall of France and the potential collapse of the defences in Britain, he still held to his pre-war position that &quot;[it] is essential to hold the East firmly, whatever happens here&quot;. By mid-June, he had begun to collect a scanty mobile reserve – the 8th RTR, with infantry tanks, and six regiments of armoured cars beginning to form – and the pillboxes and coastal defences were being prepared, though he emphasised to the local commanders that the latter &quot;are only meant as delaying lines, and are meant to give the mobile columns a chance of coming up to the threatened points.&quot;

The fall of France led to a brief interlude where the Cabinet debated sending Ironside on a diplomatic mission to meet Charles Noguès, the French commander in North Africa and a personal acquaintance of Ironside&#x27;s, but decided to retain him in Britain and send Lord Gort instead. On 25 June, he was called to the War Cabinet to brief them on the plans for Home Defence; his system of defence in depth provided for:

# A defensive &quot;crust&quot; along the coast, able to fight off small raids, give immediate warning of attack, and delay any landings.
# Home Guard roadblocks at crossroads, valleys, and other choke points, to stop German armoured columns penetrating inland.
# Static fortified stop lines sealing the Midlands and London off from the coast, and dividing the coastal area into defensible sectors
# A central corps-sized reserve to deal with a major breakthrough
# Local mobile columns to deal with local attacks and parachute landings

The plan was &quot;on the whole&quot; approved by the Cabinet, and by the Chiefs of Staff later in the week. He was clear in his diaries that he saw the static focus as an undesirable option – &quot;[the] eternal preaching of the defensive and taking cover behind anti-tank articles has been the curse of our tactics&quot; – but that it was the only practical way to make use of untrained and badly-equipped forces. By early July, he was optimistic that more troops could soon be pulled out of static positions and used in a mobile role, with the Home Guard taking over the local defences, but strongly resisted orders from Churchill to pull divisions out of the coastal areas before they could be effectively replaced.

However, criticism of the &quot;Ironside plan&quot; was soon manifest. On 26 June (only a day after the plan&#x27;s approval) at a meeting of the Vice-Chiefs of Staff, Air Marshal Richard Peirse pointed out that many of the RAF&#x27;s main operational airfields would be overrun by an invader before they reached Ironside&#x27;s principal stop line, the &quot;GHQ Line&quot;. The conclusion of the meeting was that the plan was &quot;completely unsound&quot;. Although Ironside managed to placate the Chiefs of Staff, discontent amongst his subordinates was growing; one divisional commander wrote &quot;We have become pill-box mad&quot;. There was widespread concern that troops were spending their time constructing defences rather than on the training which they desperately needed. Another critic was Major-General Bernard Montgomery, who later wrote that he found himself &quot;in complete disagreement with the general approach to the defence of Britain and refused to apply it.&quot; When Churchill visited Montgomery&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Division on 2 July, he described to the prime minister how his division, which was fully equipped except for transport, could be made into a mobile formation by the requisitioning of municipal buses, able to strike at the enemy beachheads rather than strung out along the coast as ordered. Ironside&#x27;s credibility was not improved by his association with &quot;Boney&quot; Fuller, a senior member of the British Union of Fascists. Finally, on 17 July, Churchill had a long drive with Lieutenant-General Sir Alan Brooke, the commander of Southern Command, whose views on creating mobile reserves held close to possible landing sites were in accordance with his own.

On 19 July, Ironside was summoned to the War Office and informed that he was to be replaced by Brooke as C-in-C Home Forces, effective immediately. The formal reason was that the Cabinet wished to have someone with recent combat experience in command, and Ironside accepted the dismissal gracefully – &quot;I was quite prepared to be released. I had done my best ... I can&#x27;t complain. Cabinets have to make decisions in times of stress. I don&#x27;t suppose that Winston liked doing it, for he is always loyal to his friends.&quot; On his arrival at Home Forces HQ, Brooke was astonished that Ironside had not stayed to apprise him of the situation; neither had he left him any notes except for a brief memo to say that he had arranged for Brooke to use his staff car.

Shortly before being dismissed, Ironside was implicated as a potential military leader for a fascist coup organized by Leigh Vaughan-Henry, intended to take place when Germany landed in Britain. While neither Ironside&#x27;s approval nor even his knowledge of the plot were conclusively proven, J.F.C. Fuller, a confirmed participant in the plot, told retired Admiral Barry Domvile, a fellow participant, that &quot;Ironside is with us.&quot; A fellow conspirator, Samuel Darwin-Fox, told an MI5 agent that:&quot;Italy would declare war almost immediately, that France would then give in and that Britain would follow before the end of the week. There would be a short civil war, the Government would leave first for Bristol and then for the Colonies, General Ironside would become dictator and after things had settled down Germany could do as she liked with Britain.&quot;

==Retirement and writing==
At the end of August, a month and a half after his resignation as Commander-in-Chief of Home Forces, Ironside was appointed a field marshal. He was raised to the peerage in the New Year Honours, on 29 January 1941, as &quot;Baron Ironside of Archangel and of Ironside in the County of Aberdeen&quot;, and retired to Morley Old Hall in Norfolk with his family. He never received another military posting, and ostracised by the Army establishment, rarely visited London, and never spoke in the House of Lords.

He turned to lecturing and writing books, including a study of the Archangel expedition, and farming his estates in Norfolk. After almost two decades in retirement, having survived a driving accident, he was injured in a fall at his home; he was taken to Queen Alexandra Military Hospital in London where he died on 22 September 1959, aged 79. His coffin was escorted to Westminster Abbey with full military honours, and he was buried near his home at Hingham, Norfolk. He is commemorated by a memorial plaque in the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Ironside kept a diary throughout his life, starting as a subaltern at the turn of the century, with the goal of keeping a clear recollection of what had happened during the day and allowing him to reflect on the day&#x27;s events. These were written directly into bound foolscap volumes, a page or more a day, each night; throughout his life, he totalled some twelve volumes and the best part of a million words. He did not ask for these to be destroyed on his death, though their content was sometimes quite contentious, but did write a will – in 1930 – asking that they not be published. In the late 1950s, however, a former colleague persuaded him to allow extracts to be published as part of an account of the run-up to the Second World War, although he died shortly before it saw print. This was published as &quot;The Ironside Diaries: 1937–1940&quot;, edited by Colonel Roderick Macleod and Denis Kelly, in 1962; the material was selected from May 1937 to his retirement in June 1940, and published as numbered daily entries with editorial notes.

A second volume, &quot;High Road to Command: the diaries of Major-General Sir Edmund Ironside, 1920–1922&quot;, was published in 1972, edited by his son; this covered the period from 1920 to 1922, during his service in the Middle East. The book was assembled by Ironside shortly before his death and, whilst it drew heavily on the diaries, it was written in a more conventional narrative form rather than as a strict day-by-day account, with editorial remarks kept to a minimum.

<text>The Franklin half dollar is a coin that was struck by the United States Mint from 1948 to 1963. The fifty-cent piece pictures Founding Father Benjamin Franklin on the obverse and the Liberty Bell on the reverse. A small eagle was placed to the right of the bell to fulfill the legal requirement that half dollars depict the figure of an eagle. Produced in 90 percent silver with a reeded edge, the coin was struck at the Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco mints.

Mint director Nellie Tayloe Ross had long admired Franklin, and wanted him to be depicted on a coin. In 1947, she instructed her chief engraver, John R. Sinnock, to prepare designs for a Franklin half dollar. Sinnock&#x27;s designs were based on his earlier work, but he died before their completion. The designs were completed by Sinnock&#x27;s successor, Gilroy Roberts. The Mint submitted the new designs to the Commission of Fine Arts (&quot;Commission&quot;) for its advisory opinion. The Commission disliked the small eagle and felt that depicting the crack in the Liberty Bell would expose the coinage to jokes and ridicule. Despite the Commission&#x27;s disapproval, the Mint proceeded with Sinnock&#x27;s designs.

After the coins were released in April 1948, the Mint received accusations that Sinnock&#x27;s initials &quot;JRS&quot; on the cutoff at Franklin&#x27;s shoulder were a tribute to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin (Stalin did not have a middle name that began with an &#x27;R&#x27;). No change was made, with the Mint responding that the letters were simply the artist&#x27;s initials (The same accusation was made after the release of the Sinnock designed Roosevelt Dime in 1946). The coin was struck regularly until 1963. Beginning in 1964 it was replaced by the Kennedy half dollar, issued in honor of the assassinated President John F. Kennedy. Though the coin is still legal tender, its value to collectors or as silver (bullion value) both greatly exceed its face value.

== Background and selection ==
Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross had long been an admirer of Benjamin Franklin, and wished to see him on a coin. In 1933, Sinnock had designed a medal featuring Franklin, which may have given her the idea. Franklin had opposed putting portraits on coins; he advocated proverbs about which the holder could profit through reflection. In a 1948 interview, Ross noted that Franklin only knew of living royalty on coins, and presumably would feel differently about a republic honoring a deceased founder. Indeed, Franklin might have been more upset at the reverse design: as numismatic writer Jonathan Tepper noted, &quot;Had Benjamin Franklin known that he would be appearing on a half dollar with an eagle, he most likely would have been quite upset. He detested the eagle, and numismatic lore has it that he often referred to it as a scavenger. Given the practical man that he was, Franklin proposed the wild turkey as our national bird.&quot;
An 1890 statute forbade the replacement of a coin design without congressional action, unless it had been in service for 25 years, counting the year of first issuance. The Walking Liberty half dollar and Mercury dime had been first issued in 1916; they could be replaced without congressional action from and after 1940. Mint officials considered putting Franklin on the dime in 1941, but the project was shelved due to heavy demands on the Mint for coins as the United States entered World War II. During the war, the Mint contemplated adding one or more new denominations of coinage; Sinnock prepared a Franklin design in anticipation of a new issue, which did not occur. The dime was redesigned in 1946 to depict fallen President Franklin Roosevelt, who had been closely associated with the March of Dimes. The Walking Liberty design seemed old-fashioned to Mint officials, and the only other coin being struck which was eligible for replacement was the Lincoln cent. Abraham Lincoln remained a beloved figure, and Ross did not want to be responsible for removing him from the coinage.

In 1947, Ross asked Sinnock to produce a design for a half dollar featuring Franklin. The chief engraver adapted his earlier work for the obverse. He had designed the medal from a bust of Franklin by Jean-Antoine Houdon. Sinnock based his design for the reverse on the 1926 commemorative half dollar for the sesquicentennial (150th anniversary) of American Independence. Numismatic writer Don Taxay later discovered that Sinnock had based his Liberty Bell (as depicted on both the Sesquicentennial half dollar and the Franklin half) on a sketch by John Frederick Lewis. Sinnock died in May 1947, before finishing the reverse design, which was completed by the new chief engraver, Gilroy Roberts. Similar to Sinnock&#x27;s work for the Roosevelt dime, the portrait is designed along simple lines, with Franklin depicted wearing a period suit. The small eagle on the reverse was added as an afterthought, when Mint officials realized that the Coinage Act of 1873 required one to be displayed on all coins of greater value than the dime.

The Mint sought comments on the designs from the Commission of Fine Arts, which was provided with a lead striking of the obverse and a view of the reverse; Taxay suggests they were shown a plaster model. On December 1, 1947, Commission chairman Gilmore Clarke wrote to Ross saying that they had no objection to the obverse, in which they recognized Sinnock&#x27;s &quot;good workmanship&quot;. As for the reverse,

Numismatist Paul Green later noted, &quot;Over the years there would probably have been even more puns and derogatory statements if there had been an attempt to depict the bell without a crack.&quot; The Commission suggested a design competition under its auspices. Its recommendations, which were only advisory, were rejected by the Treasury Department and the coin was approved by Treasury Secretary John W. Snyder, which Taxay ascribes to an unwillingness to dishonor Sinnock.

== Release and production ==

On January 7, 1948, the Treasury issued a press release announcing the new half dollar. The Commission&#x27;s disapproval went unreported; instead the release noted that the design had been Ross&#x27;s idea and had received Secretary Snyder&#x27;s &quot;enthusiastic approval&quot;. The release noted Franklin&#x27;s reputation for thrift, and expressed hope that the half dollar would serve as a reminder that spare cash should be used to purchase savings bonds and savings stamps. Franklin became the fifth person and first non-president to be honored by the issuance of a regular-issue US coin, after Lincoln, Roosevelt, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.

In a speech given when she unveiled the design in January 1948, Ross indicated that she had been urged to put Franklin on the cent because of his association with the adage &quot;a penny saved is a penny earned&quot; (in Franklin&#x27;s original, &quot;A penny saved is twopence dear&quot;.) Ross stated, &quot;You will agree, I believe, that the fifty-cent piece, being larger and of silver, lends itself much better to the production of an impressive effect.&quot; On April 29, 1948, the day before the coin&#x27;s public release, Ross held a dinner party for 200 at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia; each guest received a Franklin half dollar in a card signed by Ross.

The new half dollars first went on sale at noon on April 30, 1948, the anniversary of George Washington&#x27;s 1789 inauguration as President. They were sold from a booth on the steps of the Sub-Treasury Building in New York, by employees of the Franklin Savings Bank dressed in Revolutionary-era garb.
The Roosevelt dime had been designed by Sinnock, and had provoked complaints by citizens viewing Sinnock&#x27;s initials &quot;JS&quot; on the coin as those of Joseph Stalin, placed there by some Kremlin infiltrator within the Mint. Even though Sinnock&#x27;s initials (placed on the cutoff of Franklin&#x27;s bust) were expressed &quot;JRS&quot;, the Mint still received similar complaints, to which they responded with what numismatic historian Walter Breen termed &quot;outraged official denials&quot;. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;People wrote in demanding to know how the Bureau of the Mint had discovered that Joe Stalin had a middle name.&quot; Another rumor was that the small &quot;o&quot; in &quot;of&quot; was an error, and that the coins would be recalled. This claim died more quickly than the Stalin rumor.

After the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, Congress and the Mint moved with great speed to authorize and produce a half dollar in tribute to him. With the authorization of the Kennedy half dollar on December 30, 1963, the Franklin half dollar series came to an end. Breen reports rumors of 1964 Franklin half dollars, produced possibly as trial strikes to test 1964-dated dies, but none has ever come to light. A total of 465,814,455 Franklin half dollars were struck for circulation; in addition, 15,886,955 were struck in proof.
== Collecting ==
The Franklin half dollar was struck in relatively small numbers in its first years, as there was limited demand due to a glut of Walking Liberty halves. No half dollars were struck at Denver in 1955 and 1956 due to a lack of demand for additional pieces. The San Francisco Mint closed in 1955; it did not reopen until 1965. In 1957, with improved economic conditions, demand for the pieces began to rise. They were struck in much greater numbers beginning in 1962, which saw the start of the greatly increased demand for coins which would culminate in the great coin shortage of 1964. No Franklin half dollar is rare today, as even low-mintage dates were widely saved. Proof coins were struck at the Philadelphia Mint from 1950. &quot;Cameo proofs&quot;, with frosted surfaces and mirror-like fields, were struck in small numbers and carry a premium. Just under 498 million Franklin half dollars, including proofs, were struck.
There are only 35 different dates and mintmarks in the series, making it a relatively inexpensive collecting project. A widely known variety is the 1955 &quot;Bugs Bunny&quot; half. This variety was caused by a die clash between an obverse die and a reverse die. The impact of the eagle&#x27;s wings on the other die caused a marking outside of Franklin&#x27;s mouth which, according to some, resembles buck teeth. The quality of half dollars struck by the Mint decreased in the late 1950s, caused by deterioration of the master die from which working dies were made for coinage.

In an initial attempt to improve the quality of the pieces, the Mint made slight modifications to the designs, though both the old (Type I) and new (Type II) were struck in 1958 and 1959. One obvious difference between the types is the number of long tail feathers on the eagle—Type I half dollars have four tail feathers, Type II only three. Approximately 5-10% of the 1958 Philadelphia coinage is Type II, struck from dies which were first used to strike the 1958 proofs. About 70% of the 1959 half dollars struck at Philadelphia are Type II; all 1958-D and 1959-D half dollars are Type I. The Mint recut the master die before beginning the 1960 coinage, improving quality.

An especially well-struck Franklin half dollar is said to have full bell lines. To qualify, the seven parallel lines making up the bottom of the bell must be fully visible, and the three wisps of hair to the right of Franklin&#x27;s ear on the obverse must also fully show, and not blend together. Many Franklins have been damaged by &quot;roll friction&quot;: the tendency of pieces in a loose coin roll to rub together repeatedly, causing steel-gray abrasions, usually on Franklin&#x27;s cheek and on the center of the Liberty Bell.

By mintages, the key dates in this series are the 1948, 1949-S, 1953 and 1955. Franklin half dollars have been extensively melted for their silver, and many dates are rarer than the mintage figures indicate. For example, although more than nine million 1962 halves were struck for circulation, and an additional three million in proof, the coin was more valuable as bullion than in any condition when silver prices reached record levels in 1979–1980.

<text>William Irwin (July 12, 1827 – March 15, 1886) was an American politician from the Democratic Party who served as the 13th governor of California between 1875 and 1880. He previously served as acting lieutenant governor for nine months in 1875.

Born in Butler County, Ohio, Irwin graduated in 1848 from Marietta College in Marietta, where he later became an instructor. After moving to California, Irwin worked in various private industries and in 1865 was a candidate for Siskiyou County Tax Collector but lost. He was eventually elected to the California State Assembly, representing the 28th district. He became the editor of a newspaper and then was elected to the California State Senate. He served as President pro tempore of the Senate and as such, became acting lieutenant governor in 1875 when Lieutenant Governor Romualdo Pacheco became governor. Irwin was elected governor in his own right that same year. He died in 1886 in San Francisco, California and was interred in the Sacramento Historic City Cemetery in Sacramento, California.

Irwin was the one who appointed young journalist Henry George to the office of State Inspector of Gas Meters in 1876, which lifted George and his family out of destitution and allowed him to write &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;.

<text>William Henry Irwin (September 14, 1873 – February 24, 1948) was an American author, writer, and journalist who was associated with the muckrakers.

==Early life==
Irwin was born in 1873 in Oneida, New York. In his early childhood, the Irwin family moved to Clayville, New York, a farming and mining center south of Utica. In about 1878, his father moved to Leadville, Colorado, established himself in the lumber business, and brought his family there. When his business failed, Irwin&#x27;s father moved the family to Twin Lakes, Colorado. A hotel business there failed too, and the family moved back to Leadville in a bungalow at 125 West Twelfth Street. In 1889, the family moved to Denver, where he graduated from high school. He said he cured himself of a diagnosed bout of tuberculosis by &quot;roughing it&quot; for a year as a cowboy.

==University==

With a loan from his high school teacher, Irwin entered Stanford University in September 1894. Irwin was forced to withdraw for disciplinary reasons but was readmitted and graduated on May 24, 1899. According to journalism historians Clifford Weigle and David Clark in their biographical sketch of Irwin,

:&quot;During four riotous years at Stanford, Irwin &#x27;specialized&#x27; in campus politics, undergraduate theatricals and writing, and beer drinking and inventive pranks. Expelled three weeks before he was to have received the B.A. degree in 1898, he got the degree a year later after final, solemn consideration by a somewhat reluctant faculty committee on student affairs.&quot;

== The &quot;Chronicle&quot; and The &quot;Sun&quot;==
In 1901 Irwin got a job as a reporter on the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, eventually rising to Sunday editor. For the San Francisco-based Bohemian Club, he wrote the Grove Play &quot;The Hamadryads, A Masque of Apollo in One Act&quot;&#x27; in 1904. The same year, he moved to New York City to take a reporter&#x27;s position at &quot;The New York Sun&quot;, then in its heyday under the editorship of Chester Lord and Selah M. Clark. Also in 1904, Irwin co-authored a book of short stories with Gelett Burgess, &quot;The Picaroons&quot; (McClure, Phillips &amp; Co.)

Irwin arrived in New York City the same day as a major disaster, the sinking of the &quot;General Slocum&quot;. As a new reporter on &quot;The Sun&quot;, he was assigned to work the Bellevue Hospital morgue, where the more than 1,000 bodies of the victims of fire and drowning were taken.

==&quot;The City That Was&quot;==

Irwin&#x27;s biggest story and the feat that made his reputation as a journalist was his absentee coverage for &quot;The Sun&quot;, in New York City, of the San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906.

Weigle and Clark described his activities:
: &quot;Because he knew the city so well, he was assigned to write – mostly from memory, supplemented by scant telegraphic bulletins – the story of the quake. Before the last-edition deadline on the first day, April 18, 1906, he wrote fourteen columns of copy. and he kept writing, eight columns or more a day, for the next seven days, as fire swept the ruined city. The booklet, for which Irwin is most widely known, resulted from six or seven columns of the general description of pre-earthquake San Francisco that he wrote on the afternoon of the third day of the story.&quot;

== McClure&#x27;s and Collier&#x27;s ==
Irwin was hired by S.S. McClure in 1906 as managing editor of &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;. He rose to the position of editor but disliked the work and then moved to &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, edited by Norman Hapgood. He wrote investigative stories on the movement for Prohibition and a study of fake spiritual mediums.

Back on the Pacific coast in 1906–1907 to research a story on anti-Japanese racism, Irwin returned to San Francisco and found it flourishing. Several years later, he wrote an article on the city&#x27;s rebirth entitled &quot;The City That Is&quot; in the &quot;San Francisco Call&quot;, which concluded that San Francisco had become &quot;a larger city, a more convenient city, and since it is also a more beautiful and more distinctive city I announce myself a complete convert. This city that was business is the old stuff.&quot;

Irwin&#x27;s series on anti-Japanese discrimination appeared in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in September–October 1907 and &quot;Pearson&#x27;s&quot; in 1909.

==&quot;The American Newspaper&quot;==

Then came the &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine series, &quot;The American Newspaper&quot;, one of the most famous critical analyses of American journalism. The series was researched from September 23, 1909, until late June 1910 and published from January to June 1911.

==World War I==
Irwin continued to write articles, some in the muckraking style, until the outbreak of World War I. He sailed to Europe in August 1914 as one of the first American correspondents. According to the media historians Edwin and Michael Emery

:&quot;[Irwin&#x27;s] beats on the battles of Ypres and the first German use of poison gas were also printed in the &quot;Tribune&quot;. Irwin was one of several correspondents who represented American magazines in Europe; he first wrote for &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; and then for the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Irwin&#x27;s article appeared on the front page of &quot;The New York Tribune&quot; on April 27, 1915.

Irwin served on the executive committee of Herbert Hoover&#x27;s Commission for Relief in Belgium in 1914–1915 and was chief of the foreign department of George Creel&#x27;s Committee on Public Information in 1918.

==Skeptic of spiritualism==
Irwin was skeptical of paranormal claims. In 1907-1908, for the &quot;Colliers Weekly&quot;, he published four installments of &quot;The Medium Game: Behind the Scenes with Spiritualism&quot; to cover fraud and trickery associated with spiritualism.

The psychical researcher Hereward Carrington described Irwin as a well-known &quot;exposer of fraudulent mediums.&quot;

==Books and plays==
During and after the war Irwin wrote 17 more books, including &quot;Christ or Mars?&quot;, an anti-war treatise (1923); a biography of Herbert Hoover (1928); a history of Paramount Pictures and its founder, Adolph Zukor, &quot;The House That Shadows Built&quot; (1928); and his own autobiography, &quot;The Making of a Reporter&quot; (1942). He also wrote two plays and continued magazine writing.

==Personal life==
Irwin was married to the feminist author, Inez Haynes Irwin, who published under the name Inez Haynes Gillmore, author of &quot;Angel Island&quot; (1914) and &quot;The Californiacs&quot; (1916). The Irwins summered in Scituate, Massachusetts, in the early 1900s. Will Irwin wrote a story in 1914 for &quot;The American Magazine&quot; about summer life in Scituate.

Irwin died in 1948, at the age of 74.

<doc id="738541" wikidata="Q431168" url="?curid=738541" title="Pectus excavatum">
<text>Pectus excavatum is a structural deformity of the anterior thoracic wall in which the sternum and rib cage are shaped abnormally. This produces a caved-in or sunken appearance of the chest. It can either be present at birth or develop after puberty.

Pectus excavatum can impair cardiac and respiratory function and cause pain in the chest and back.

People with the condition may experience severe negative psychosocial effects and avoid activities that expose the chest.

==Signs and symptoms==
The hallmark of the condition is a sunken appearance of the sternum. The most common form is a cup-shaped concavity, involving the lower end of the sternum; a broader concavity involving the upper costal cartilages is possible. The lower-most ribs may protrude (&quot;flared ribs&quot;). Pectus excavatum defects may be symmetric or asymmetric.

People may also experience chest and back pain, which is usually of musculoskeletal origin.

In mild cases, cardiorespiratory function is normal, although the heart can be displaced and/or rotated. In severe cases, the right atrium may be compressed, mitral valve prolapse may be present, and physical capability may be limited due to base lung capacity being decreased.

Psychological symptoms manifest with feelings of embarrassment, social anxiety, shame, limited capacity for activities and communication, negativity, intolerance, frustration, and even depression.

==Causes==

Researchers are unsure of the cause of pectus excavatum. Some researchers take the stance that it is a congenital disorder (birth defect), but not genetic. Others assume that there is some genetic component. A small sample size test found that in at least some cases, 37% of individuals have an affected first degree family member. , a number of genetic markers for pectus excavatum had also been discovered.

It was believed for decades that pectus excavatum is caused by an overgrowth of costal cartilage; however, people with pectus excavatum actually tend to have shorter, not longer, costal cartilage relative to rib length.

Pectus excavatum can be present in other conditions too, including Noonan syndrome, Marfan syndrome and Loeys–Dietz syndrome as well as other connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. Many children with spinal muscular atrophy develop pectus excavatum due to their diaphragmatic breathing.

==Pathophysiology==
Physiologically, increased pressure &quot;in utero&quot;, rickets and increased traction on the sternum due to abnormalities of the diaphragm have been postulated as specific mechanisms. Because the heart is located behind the sternum, and because individuals with pectus excavatum have been shown to have visible deformities of the heart seen both on radiological imaging and after autopsies, it has been hypothesized that there is impairment of the function of the cardiovascular system in individuals with pectus excavatum.

While some studies have demonstrated decreased cardiovascular function, no consensus has been reached based on newer physiological tests such as echocardiography of the presence or degree of impairment in cardiovascular function. However, a 2016 meta-analysis found significant evidence that surgical correction of pectus excavatum improves patient cardiac performance.

==Diagnosis==

Pectus excavatum is initially suspected from visual examination of the anterior chest. Auscultation of the chest can reveal displaced heart beat and valve prolapse. There can be a heart murmur occurring during systole caused by proximity between the sternum and the pulmonary artery.
Lung sounds are usually clear yet diminished due to decreased base lung capacity.

Many scales have been developed to determine the degree of deformity in the chest wall. Most of these are variants on the distance between the sternum and the spine. One such index is the &quot;Backer ratio&quot; which grades severity of deformity based on the ratio between the diameter of the vertebral body nearest to xiphosternal junction and the distance between the xiphosternal junction and the nearest vertebral body. More recently the Haller index has been used based on CT scan measurements. An index over 3.25 is often defined as severe. The Haller index is the ratio between the horizontal distance of the inside of the ribcage and the shortest distance between the vertebrae and sternum.
Chest x-rays are also useful in the diagnosis. The chest x-ray in pectus excavatum can show an opacity in the right lung area that can be mistaken for an infiltrate (such as that seen with pneumonia). Some studies also suggest that the Haller index can be calculated based on chest x-ray as opposed to CT scanning in individuals who have no limitation in their function.

Pectus excavatum is differentiated from other disorders by a series of elimination of signs and symptoms. Pectus carinatum is excluded by the simple observation of a collapsing of the sternum rather than a protrusion. Kyphoscoliosis is excluded by diagnostic imaging of the spine, wherein pectus excavatum the spine usually appears normal in structure.

==Treatment==
Pectus excavatum requires no corrective procedures in mild cases. Treatment of severe cases can involve either invasive or non-invasive techniques or a combination of both. Before an operation proceeds several tests are usually performed. These include, but are not limited to, a CT scan, pulmonary function tests, and cardiology exams (such as auscultation and ECGs). After a CT scan is taken, the Haller index is measured. The patient&#x27;s Haller is calculated by obtaining the ratio of the transverse diameter (the horizontal distance of the inside of the ribcage) and the anteroposterior diameter (the shortest distance between the vertebrae and sternum). A Haller Index of greater than 3.25 is generally considered severe, while normal chest has an index of 2.5. The cardiopulmonary tests are used to determine the lung capacity and to check for heart murmurs.

===Conservative treatment===
The chest wall is elastic, gradually stiffening with age. Non-surgical treatments have been developed that aim at gradually alleviating the pectus excavatum condition, making use of the elasticity of the chest wall, including the costal cartilages, in particular in young cases.

====Exercise====
Physical exercise has an important role in conservative pectus excavatum treatment though is not seen as a means to resolve the condition on its own. It is used in order to halt or slow the progression of mild or moderate excavatum conditions and as supplementary treatment to improve a poor posture, to prevent secondary complications, and to prevent relapse after treatment.

Exercises are aimed at improving posture, strengthening back and chest muscles, and enhancing exercise capacity, ideally also increasing chest expansion. Pectus exercises include deep breathing and breath holding exercises, as well as strength training for the back and chest muscles. Additionally, aerobic exercises to improve cardiopulmonary function are employed.

====Vacuum bell====

An alternative to surgery, the vacuum bell, was described in 2006; the procedure is also referred to as treatment by &quot;cup suction&quot;. It consists of a bowl shaped device which fits over the caved-in area; the air is then removed by the use of a hand pump. The vacuum created by this lifts the sternum upwards, lessening the severity of the deformity. It has been proposed as an alternative to surgery in less severe cases. Once the defect visually disappears, two additional years of use of the vacuum bell is required to make what may be a permanent correction. The treatment, in combination with physiotherapy exercises, has been judged by some as &quot;a promising useful alternative&quot; to surgery provided the thorax is flexible; the duration of treatment that is required has been found to be &quot;directly linked to age, severity and the frequency of use&quot;. Long-term results are still lacking.

A single-center study reported in the Journal of Pediatric Surgery found that use of vacuum bell therapy resulted in an excellent correction in twenty percent of patients, but &quot;is not a substitute for the Nuss procedure which can achieve an excellent result in 90% of patients&quot;. Variables predictive of an excellent outcome include age ≤ 11 years, chest wall depth ≤ 1.5 cm, chest wall flexibility, and vacuum bell use over 12 consecutive months.

In an article by &quot;Interactive Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery&quot;, the results found that vacuum bell treatment is safe for correcting the deformity non-surgically. The treatment has been shown to have higher success rates in patients who present earlier, have a mild and/or symmetrical deformity, a flexible chest wall and lack of costal flaring.

The vacuum bell can also be used in preparation to surgery.

====Orthoses====
Brazilian orthopedist Sydney Haje developed a non-surgical protocol for treating pectus carinatum as well as pectus excavatum. The method involves wearing a compressive orthosis and adhering to an exercise protocol.

Mild cases have also reportedly been treated with corset-like orthopedic support vests and exercise.

===Thoracic surgery===

There has been controversy as to the best surgical approach for correction of pectus excavatum. It is important for the surgeon to select the appropriate operative approach based on each individual&#x27;s characteristics.
Surgical correction has been shown to repair any functional symptoms that may occur in the condition, such as respiratory problems or heart murmurs, provided that permanent damage has not already arisen from an extremely severe case.

Surgical correction of the pectus excavatum has been shown to significantly improve cardiovascular function; there is inconclusive evidence so far as to whether it might also improve pulmonary function. One of the most popular techniques for repair of pectus excavatum today is the minimally invasive operation, also known as MIRPE or Nuss technique.

====Magnetic mini-mover procedure====
The magnetic mini-mover procedure (3MP) is a minimally invasive procedure used to correct pectus excavatum by using two magnets to realign the sternum with the rest of the chest and ribcage. One magnet is inserted 1 cm into the patient&#x27;s body on the lower end of the sternum, the other is placed externally onto a custom fitted brace. These two magnets generate around 0.04 tesla (T) in order to slowly move the sternum outwards over a number of years. The maximum magnetic field that can be applied to the body safely is around 4 T, making this technique safe from a magnetic viewpoint. The 3MP technique&#x27;s main advantages are that it is more cost-effective than major surgical approaches such as the Nuss procedure and it is considerably less painful postoperatively.

Its effectiveness is limited to younger children in early- to mid-puberty because older individuals have less compliant (flexible) chest walls. One potential adverse interaction with other medical devices is possible inactivation of artificial pacemakers if present.

====Ravitch technique====

The Ravitch technique is an invasive surgery that was introduced in 1949 and developed in the 1950s. It involves creating an incision along the chest through which the cartilage is removed and the sternum detached. A small bar is inserted underneath the sternum to hold it up in the desired position. The bar is left implanted until the cartilage grows back, typically about six months. The bar is subsequently removed in a simple outpatient procedure; this technique is thus a two-stage procedure.

The Ravitch technique is not widely practiced because it is so invasive. It is more often used in older individuals, where the sternum has calcified when the deformity is asymmetrical, or when the less invasive Nuss procedure has proven unsuccessful.

====Nuss procedure====
In 1987, Donald Nuss, based at Children&#x27;s Hospital of The King&#x27;s Daughters in Norfolk, Virginia, performed the first minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) and presented it much later at a conference in 1997.

His two-stage procedure, widely known as the &quot;Nuss procedure&quot;, involves slipping in one or more concave steel bars into the chest, underneath the sternum.

The bar is flipped to a convex position so as to push outward on the sternum, correcting the deformity. The bar usually stays in the body for about two years, although many surgeons are currently moving toward leaving them in for up to five years. When the bones have solidified into place, the bar is removed through outpatient surgery.

Although initially designed to be performed in younger children of less than 10 years of age, whose sternum and cartilage is more flexible, there are successful series of Nuss treatment in patients well into their teens and twenties.

====Robicsek technique====
In 1965, Francis Robicsek, based at Charlotte Memorial Hospital, now named Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, developed the Robicsek procedure. Each time the procedure is performed, it is individually tailored based on the extent and location of the deformity in the patient. The operation begins with an incision, no more than 4–6 centimeters, to the sternum. The pectoralis major muscles are then detached from the sternum. Using the upper limit of the sternal depression as a guide, the deformed cartilages are removed one by one, using sharp and blunt dissection. The lower tip of the sternum is then grabbed with a towel-clip and, using blunt dissection, is freed of tissue connections with the pericardium and the pleura. The sternum is then forcefully bent forward into a corrected position. To keep the sternum elevated, a piece of mesh is placed under the mobilized sternum and sutured under moderate tension bilaterally to the stumps of the ribs. The pectoralis muscles are united in front of the sternum and the wound is closed. The Robicsek procedure is a single-stage procedure (one surgery only).

The purported advantage of this technique is that it is less invasive than the Ravitch technique, but critics have suggested that the relapse rate may be high due to cartilage and bone displaying memory phenomenon.

====Pectus Up technique====
In 2016, Carlos Bardají, a Barcelona-based pediatric surgeon, together with Lluís Cassou, a biomedical engineer, published a paper describing an extra-thoracic surgical procedure for the correction of pectus excavatum called Pectus up technique. A specially designed implant and traction hardware were developed specifically for the procedure.

Pectus up technique, a small hole is drilled into the sternum at the deepest point of defect, and a double screw is driven into the hole. Then, a stainless steel implant is placed underneath the skin on top of the sternum and ribs, centered over the double screw. Traction tools are then used to lift the sternum up by the double screw using the implant and ribs for traction. Additional screws are then used to secure the implant onto the sternum holding the sternum in the desired position. Optionally, stainless steel wire may be wrapped around the implant and ribs to further secure the implant in place.

Like the Nuss procedure, Pectus up technique requires follow-up surgery several years later to remove the implanted hardware once the sternum has permanently assumed its new position.

The implant and related hardware used in taulinoplasty is a proprietary product of Ventura Medical Technologies and is marketed as a surgical kit under the brand name Pectus UP.

Pectus up technique was developed to be an alternative to the Nuss procedure that eliminates the risks and drawbacks of entering the thorax. In particular, patients usually have shorter operating and recovery times, and less post-operative pain than with the Nuss procedure.

====Implants====

The implant allows pectus excavatum to be treated from a purely morphological perspective. Today it is used as a benchmark procedure as it is simple, reliable, and minimally intrusive while offering aesthetically pleasing results. This procedure does not, however, claim to correct existing cardiac and respiratory problems which, in very rare cases, can be triggered by the pectus excavatum condition. For female patients, the potential resulting breast asymmetry can be partially or completely corrected by this procedure.

The process of creating a plaster-cast model, directly on the skin of the patient&#x27;s thorax, can be used in the design of the implants. The evolution of medical imaging and CAD (computer-aided design) now allows customised 3D implants to be designed directly from the ribcage, therefore being much more precise, easier to place sub-pectorally and perfectly adapted to the shape of each patient. The implants are made of medical silicone rubber which is resistant to wear and extremely durable (different from the silicone gel used in breast implants). They will last for life (apart from the case of adverse reactions) and are not visible externally.

The surgery is performed under general anesthesia and takes about an hour. The surgeon makes an incision of approximately seven centimetres, prepares the customised space in the chest, inserts the implant deep beneath the muscle, then closes the incision. Post-operative hospitalization is typically around three days.

The recovery after the surgery typically requires only mild pain relief. Post-operatively, a surgical dressing is required for several days and compression vest for a month following the procedure. A check-up appointment is carried out after a week for puncture of seroma. If the surgery has minimal complications, the patient can resume normal activities quickly, returning to work after 15 days and participating in any sporting activities after three months.

====Lipofilling====
The &quot;lipofilling&quot; technique consists of sucking fat from the patient using a syringe with a large gauge needle (usually from the abdomen or the outer thighs), then after centrifugation, the fat cells are re-injected beneath the skin into whichever hollow it is needed to fill. This technique is primarily used to correct small defects which may persist after conventional surgical treatment.

==Epidemiology==
Pectus excavatum occurs in an estimated 1 in 150 to 1 in 1000 births, with male predominance (male-to-female ratio of 3:1). In 35% to 45% of cases family members are affected.

==Etymology==
Pectus excavatum is from Latin meaning &quot;hollowed chest&quot;. It is sometimes referred to as sunken chest syndrome, cobbler&#x27;s chest or funnel chest.

==Society==
American Olympic swimmer Cody Miller (born 1992) opted not to have treatment for pectus excavatum, even though it limited his lung capacity. He earned a gold medal in 2016.
Actor Joel Kinnaman underwent surgery prior to the filming of &quot;Altered Carbon&quot;, inserting two metal bars to push the sternum outward in order to correct the deformity. Mick Fleetwood, founding member of the band Fleetwood Mac has the condition. This is noticeable on the cover of their 1968 album &#x27;Mr. Wonderful&#x27;. English comedian and presenter Josh Widdicombe and YouTuber/streamer Ludwig Ahgren are known to have this condition. Zachary Woods is another popular American actor who has pectus excavatum, which is noticeable in his shirtless scene in an episode of &quot;The Office&quot; (Season 8, episode 12). Dutch bodybuilder, actor and Muscle Meats CEO Olivier Richters, &quot;The Dutch Giant&quot;, suffered from the condition before undergoing surgical correction.

Additionally, Eric Harris, an American mass murderer who perpetrated the Columbine High School massacre, had pectus excavatum. He had surgery at 12 and 13 to correct the deformity, but it was still visible during his autopsy.

==In non-human animals==
Pectus excavatum is also known to occur in non-human animals, e.g. the Munchkin breed of cat. Some procedures used to treat the condition in animals have not been used in human treatments, such as the use of a cast with sutures wrapped around the sternum and the use of internal and external splints. These techniques are generally used in immature animals with flexible cartilage.

<doc id="738557" wikidata="Q853754" url="?curid=738557" title="Battle of Saule">
<text>The Battle of Saule (; ; ) was fought on 22 September 1236, between the Livonian Brothers of the Sword and pagan troops of Samogitians and Semigallians. Between 48 and 60 knights were killed, including the Livonian Master, Volkwin. It was the earliest large-scale defeat suffered by the orders in Baltic lands. The Sword-Brothers, the first Catholic military order established in the Baltic lands, was soundly defeated and its remnants accepted incorporation into the Teutonic Order in 1237. The battle inspired rebellions among the Curonians, Semigallians, Selonians and Oeselians, tribes previously conquered by the Sword-Brothers. Some thirty years&#x27; worth of conquests on the left bank of Daugava were reversed. To commemorate the battle, in 2000 the Lithuanian and Latvian parliaments declared 22 September to be the Baltic Unity Day.

== Background ==
The Sword-Brothers were established in 1202 in Riga to conquer and convert pagan Baltic tribes to Christianity. By the 1230s under the leadership of Master Volkwin, the order was coping with strained financial resources, decreasing manpower, and an ill reputation. The order was in conflict with the papacy under Pope Gregory IX and the Holy Roman Emperor, two of its biggest supporters, over Estonia. However, on 19 February 1236, Pope Gregory IX issued a papal bull declaring a crusade against Lithuania. Volkwin was reluctant to launch offensive actions against Lithuanian lands. His reluctance was determined by understanding that the order lacked strength to wage war against the Lithuanians. The lack of strength was a result of internal conflicts with the Bishopric of Riga. Besides that, the Livonian Sword Brothers had still little knowledge of the lands lying south of the order&#x27;s territory. Volkwin delayed starting military actions for an entire summer, hoping to escape a risky operation into unexplored lands. However, the insistence of Pope Gregory IX forced him to lead a new campaign. Volkwin targeted Samogitia, planning to conquer the coast of the Baltic Sea and connect with the Teutonic Knights in Prussia. The Sword-Brothers wanted to keep expanding along the Daugava River and were reluctant to march against Samogitia. In the fall of 1236, a party of crusaders from Holstein arrived in Riga and demanded to be led into a battle. Volkwin gathered a large war party, which included troops from Pskov Republic, Livonians, Latgallians, Curonians, and Estonians.

== Events of the battle ==
Crossing the lands of Semigallians, which were not in the order&#x27;s control, the crusaders marched southward into Samogitia, raiding and plundering local settlements. The locals had only a few days to gather troops for defense. On the knights&#x27; northward return, however, they encountered a determined group of Samogitians at a river crossing. Unwilling to risk losing their horses in the swampland, the Holsteiners refused to fight on foot, forcing the knights to camp for the night. The next morning, on the day of Saint Maurice, the main pagan forces, possibly led by Duke Vykintas, arrived at the camp. The Lithuanian light cavalry flung javelins at short range, which were highly effective against the unwieldy Livonian heavy cavalry. The swampy terrain was advantageous for the lightly armed pagans. The slaughter of the Christian troops, including Volkwin, sowed the seeds of confusion in the Livonian ranks. The lightly armed native forces under the command of the Brothers soon fled from the battle. Almost all members of the order, including Volkwin, died in the battle. Those crusaders and knights who tried to flee to Riga were allegedly killed by the Semigallians. Only every tenth Crusader reached Riga.

The &quot;Livonian Rhymed Chronicle&quot; described the pagan&#x27;s defeat of the Sword-Brothers at the battle of Saule: &quot;More heathens arrived. The next day the Christians thought to ride away early, but they had to fight the pagans though they did not want to. In the swamp, they could offer but weak resistance, and they were cut down like women. I lament the deaths of so many heroes who were so easily slain. The Master and his Brothers put up a heroic defense until their horses were slain and even then fought on foot and felled many men before they were vanquished. Finally, and with great difficulty, the Lithuanians felled them with long spears.&quot;

== Location ==
The exact location where the battle took place is unknown. The &quot;Chronicum Livoniae&quot; by Hermann de Wartberge mentioned that the battle was fought in &quot;terram Sauleorum&quot;. Traditionally, this was identified with Šiauliai (, ) in Lithuania or with the small town of Vecsaule near Bauska in what is today southern Latvia. In 1965 the German historian Friedrich Benninghoven proposed Jauniūnai village in Joniškis district, Lithuania as the battle site. The theory gained some academic support and in 2010 the Lithuanian government sponsored construction of the memorial in Jauniūnai – a tall sundial, a pond, and a park of oaks. The village of Pamūšis, situated some east of Janiūnai on the Mūša River, also claims to be the location of the battle. &quot;Saule/Saulė&quot; means &quot;the Sun&quot; in both Latvian and Lithuanian, and is the name of the Baltic Sun goddess.

<doc id="738563" wikidata="Q2697631" url="?curid=738563" title="Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton">
<text>Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton (25 February 154015 June 1614) was an English aristocrat and courtier. He was suspected throughout his life of being Roman Catholic, and went through periods of royal disfavour, in which his reputation suffered greatly. He was distinguished for learning, artistic culture and his public charities. He built Northumberland House in London and superintended the construction of the fine house of Audley End. He founded and planned several hospitals. Francis Bacon included three of his sayings in his &quot;Apophthegms&quot;, and chose him as &quot;the learnedest councillor in the kingdom to present to the king his &quot;Advancement of Learning&quot;.&quot; After his death, it was discovered that he had been involved in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury.

==Early life==

Howard was born at Shottesham, Norfolk, on 25 February 1540, being the third of five children born to Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey and his wife, Lady Frances de Vere. His paternal grandparents were Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and Elizabeth Stafford. His maternal grandparents were John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford, and Elizabeth Trussell. His older siblings were Thomas born 1536 or 1538 and Jane, born 1533 or 1537 and his younger sisters were Katherine, born 1543 and Margaret, born in 1547 shortly after her father&#x27;s execution. Between his maternal and paternal families, the religious differences were notable: his maternal grandfather was a supporter of the Reformation and was the first Protestant earl of Oxford, whereas his paternal grandfather was the premier Roman Catholic nobleman of England although he had complied with the changes in the governance of the Church of England brought about by Henry VIII, and served the King in suppressing rebellion against those changes. 

Howard&#x27;s father, the Earl of Surrey, a Catholic but with reformist leanings, was heir to the 3rd Duke, and thereby destined to become the future 4th Duke; but that changed at the end of 1546 when Surrey quartered the royal arms of Edward the Confessor on his own coat of arms, incurring the fury of Henry VIII. Through his great-grandfather John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk (1483 creation), Surrey was a descendant of Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk, the sixth son of King Edward I; and the arms of the Howard ancestor Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk (1397 creation) show that Surrey was entitled to bear Edward the Confessor&#x27;s arms but to do so was an act of pride, and provocative in the eyes of the Crown. Henry was also possibly influenced by the Seymours, who were enemies of the Howard family, supporters of Protestantism and related to Henry&#x27;s son Prince Edward because the Prince was the son of Jane Seymour, Henry&#x27;s third wife. Henry, who was increasingly unwell, became convinced that Surrey and his father planned to usurp the crown from Edward in order to reverse the Reformation and thus return the English Church to papal jurisdiction. He ordered the arrest of the Duke and his son, both of them being tried for high treason and later sentenced to death; Surrey was executed on 19 January 1547. The Duke&#x27;s execution was scheduled for 28 January but did not take place because Henry VIII died in the early hours of the same day. The Privy Council made a decision not to inaugurate the new reign with bloodshed, but Howard remained a prisoner in the Tower of London for the next six years, with most of his property and titles forfeit to the Crown.

Surrey initially entrusted the education of his children to the Dutch physician and classical scholar Hadrianus Junius (the 3rd Duke and Surrey were patrons of the Dutchman), but following his patron&#x27;s fall from grace, Junius lost his work as tutor to the Howard children. After Surrey&#x27;s death, his sister Mary Howard, Dowager Duchess of Richmond took over the care of his children and John Foxe, the Protestant martyrologist was employed to be their tutor, at the suggestion of Lord Wentworth. During that time, they lived in Reigate Castle, one of the residences belonging to the 3rd Duke. From Foxe, the children learned Greek and Latin to a level where they &quot;could compete with the most learned men of the age&quot;. Despite being educated by Foxe, both Henry and his siblings were Catholics, as were most of his paternal family, who remained loyal to the Roman Church during the turmoil of the Reformation. His father fell out of favor in part because he had been a Catholic, and his grandfather remained a prisoner in the Tower throughout the reign of Edward VI, being released and pardoned in August 1553, shortly after the Catholic Queen Mary I ascended the throne. As soon as the 3rd Duke was released, he took over the upbringing of Henry and his siblings, dismissing Foxe, who soon had to go into exile in various countries of Continental Europe to escape the anti-Protestant measures taken by Queen Mary.

Subsequently both Henry and his older brother Thomas studied with John White, Bishop of Lincoln; when White was elected Bishop of Winchester in July 1556, Henry followed his tutor to Winchester. While with White, Howard read largely in philosophy, civil law, divinity, and history. On Mary&#x27;s death and Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s accession, White was deprived of his bishopric, and Elizabeth undertook the charge of Howard&#x27;s education. Henry was a second cousin of Elizabeth through her maternal grandmother, Lady Elizabeth Howard, sister of the 3rd Duke and mother of Anne Boleyn. He was restored in blood 8 May 1559, following a Bill in the House of Lords in April that year. At the queen&#x27;s expense he proceeded to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated M. A. in 1564. He afterwards joined Trinity Hall, read Latin lectures on rhetoric and civil law in public, and applied to a friend in London for a master to teach him the lute. Subsequently, in 1568 he was incorporated M.A., at Oxford.

==Under suspicion==
He protested in 1568 to Lord Burghley that his religious views were needlessly suspected, and wrote a treatise on natural and moral philosophy for his youngest sister, Katherine, wife of Henry Berkeley, 7th Baron Berkeley, dated from Trinity Hall 6 August 1569; she supported him in some hard times. It was rumoured that he contemplated taking holy orders in the vague hope of succeeding Thomas Young as Archbishop of York. He came to court about 1570 at a low ebb, but the intrigues of which his brother, the Duke of Norfolk, was suspected at the time further depressed his prospects. When Norfolk was arrested in September 1571, accused of being involved in the Ridolfi plot to overthrow Elizabeth and then release Mary I Stewart, Queen of Scots from her imprisonment to marry her and jointly accede to the English throne, Laurence Bannister, one of the Duke&#x27;s confidential agents, testified that Henry was the one who really intended to marry the former Scottish queen. He was arrested, but, after repeated examinations, established his innocence to Elizabeth&#x27;s satisfaction, was readmitted to court, and was granted a yearly pension. However, it had been generally rumored that it was the bad advice given by Henry that ended up causing the ruin of his brother Thomas&#x27; career.

On 16 January 1572, Norfolk was tried for high treason and sentenced to death. Following Thomas&#x27;s execution on 2 June that year, Howard retired to Audley End, where he took charge of the upbringing and education of his orphaned nephews and niece: Philip, Thomas, William and Margaret. He tried by frequent letters to Burghley and to Christopher Hatton to keep himself in favour with the queen&#x27;s ministers, and managed to offer satisfactory explanations when it was reported in 1574 that he was exchanging tokens with Mary, Queen of Scots. He supplied her for many years with political information, but, according to his own account, gave her prudent advice. Howard sought to regain Elizabeth&#x27;s favour by grossly flattering her in long petitions. About 1580 he circulated a manuscript tract in support of the scheme for the marriage of Elizabeth with François, Duke of Anjou, in answer to John Stubbe&#x27;s &quot;Discoverie of a Gaping Gulf&quot; (1579), and at Burghley&#x27;s request began a reply to a pamphlet denouncing female government, which he completed in 1589. In 1582 his cousin Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, quarrelled with him, and revived the charges of heresy and of treasonable correspondence with Mary. He was again arrested, and defended himself at length in a letter to Elizabeth, in which he admitted that he had taken part in Roman Catholic worship owing to conscientious difficulties on the sacramentary, but denied that he could win Mary Stuart&#x27;s favour. He was soon set free, and, retiring to St. Albans, spent a year (1582–3) in writing his &quot;Preservative against the Poison of supposed Prophecies&quot;, a learned attack on judicial astrology, dedicated to Francis Walsingham, and said to have been suggested by the astrological exploits of Richard Harvey. The book was suspected of apparent heresies and concealed treason, and in 1583, after the discovery of the Throckmorton Plot, Howard was sent to the Fleet Prison. He complained to Hatton of harsh treatment. Mary, it was now asserted, had sent him a ring with a message. Burghley declined to intervene in his behalf, but by the favour of Burghley&#x27;s son Robert Cecil he was sent on parole to the house of Sir Nicholas Bacon at Redgrave, Suffolk. On 19 July 1585 he wrote from there to Burghley, begging permission to visit the wells at Warwick for the benefit of his health. He was said to have travelled in Italy, visiting Florence and Rome. In 1587 his repeated requests to take an active part in resisting the threatened Spanish attack were refused. At the time he had few economic resources to help him live except for his pension, which was paid to him irregularly.

==In favour under James I==

He attached himself both to Lord Essex and to Robert Cecil, and through the influence of the latter was in 1600 again received by Elizabeth. At the close of the Queen&#x27;s reign he joined with Cecil in courting James VI, the heir to the English throne who was reigning in Scotland (in fact James suggested Howard as a trusted intermediary with Cecil). James sent him a jewel with three precious stones including a ruby. Howard sent long letters of advice, which James termed &quot;Asiatic and endless volumes&quot;. In their correspondence, Howard&#x27;s identity was concealed as number &quot;3&quot;. He had success in intriguing against Sir Walter Raleigh and other rivals. On James&#x27;s accession in 1603, Howard received a multitude of favours.

Howard helped his great-nephew, Thomas Howard, Lord Maltravers to regain royal favour following the Scottish monarch&#x27;s accession to the English throne as James I. Maltravers and his mother, the widowed Countess of Arundel had suffered economic and political difficulties in the 1580s and 1590s due to their Catholicism and the attainder of the 13th Earl in 1589 following his conviction for treason, which led to forfeiture of his title and property. In 1604, Thomas was able to regain the Earldom of Arundel and estates.

In 1603 he was made a Privy Counsellor, on 1 January 1604 Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and on 13 March Earl of Northampton and Baron Marnhull, of Marnhull in the County of Dorset; on 24 February 1605 he was given the Garter and on 29 April was appointed Lord Privy Seal. In 1609 he was elected High Steward of the University of Oxford, and in 1612 Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. The same year he was appointed one of the Commissioners of the Treasury. He was one of the judges at the trials of Walter Raleigh and Lord Cobham in 1603, of Guy Fawkes in 1605, and of Henry Garnet in 1606, in each case pressing for a conviction.

In 1604 he was one of the commissioners who composed the peace treaty with Spain. Howard organised the welcome of the Spanish ambassador, Juan Fernández de Velasco y Tovar, 5th Duke of Frías, Constable of Castile, who came to sign the treaty in August. The Constable was brought up the Thames in a boat, admiring the sights, including Anne of Denmark and her companions who attended in a barge near the Tower of London wearing black masks. Howard received a pension of £1000 from the Spanish Court.

In 1604, Howard called the playwright Ben Jonson before the Privy Council, accusing him of popery and treason in &quot;Sejanus&quot;. In 1610 he received a royal grant of territory in Newfoundland, and the London and Bristol Company (Newfoundland Company) was set up around him for its commercial exploitation. However, In January 1608 Northampton was out of favour with Anne of Denmark and sought a recipe from the Earl of Mar to restore his position.

==The Overbury case==

He assisted his great-niece, Lady Essex, in obtaining her divorce from her husband (son of the 2nd Earl of Essex whom Northampton had followed in the 1590s) in order to marry the favourite Somerset, whose mistress she already was. While Northampton may have treated this as routine intrigue, the outcome was a major murder scandal. Both Northampton and her father Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk represented her in an interview with Essex held at Whitehall in May 1613, in the hope of obtaining his assent to a divorce. Essex proved uncompliant, and Northampton contrived that the case should be brought before a special commission. When, however, the divorce was obtained, Somerset&#x27;s intimate acquaintance, Sir Thomas Overbury, dissuaded him from pursuing the project of marriage with Lady Frances. Northampton recommended, on slender grounds, Overbury&#x27;s imprisonment in the Tower of London, and contrived that a friend of the Howard family, Sir Gervase Helwys, should be appointed Lord Lieutenant of the Tower. Helwys frequently wrote to Northampton about Overbury&#x27;s conduct and health. In his extant letters to Helwys Northampton writes with contempt of Overbury and expresses a desire that his own name should not be mentioned in connection with his imprisonment, but he introduced to Helwys John Craig, one of the royal physicians, to report on the prisoner&#x27;s health. Overbury died in September 1613. When the matter was judicially investigated, after Northampton too had died, his political enemies credited him with a direct hand in the murder. Overbury had died from the effects of poison administered by the direction of Lady Essex.

==Last days==

Months before his death, Howard ordered his father&#x27;s remains moved from the Church of All Hallows in Tower Street, where he had been first buried after his execution in 1547, to St Michael the Archangel&#x27;s Church, Framlingham. Northampton himself commissioned the construction of the spectacular painted alabaster tomb richly decorated with the coats of arms and heraldic animals of the Howard and De Vere families, which was erected at Framlingham to house the remains of his parents. Frances de Vere, Northampton&#x27;s mother had died in 1577 and was buried in Framlingham, but in 1614 her remains were placed next to those of her first husband in the new tomb.

He advised against the summoning of Parliament in 1614, and then fomented disputes to compel James to dissolve it. He died unmarried on 15 June 1614 and was buried in the chapel of Dover Castle; the monument erected above his grave was subsequently removed to the chapel at Trinity Hospital, Greenwich. His title became extinct at his death. His will, in phrasing that has been considered equivocal, can be reasonably interpreted to imply that he died a Roman Catholic.

==Works==
He was the author of:
*A &quot;Treatise of Natural and Moral Philosophy&quot; (1569; manuscript in the Bodleian Library)
*A pamphlet supporting the union between Elizabeth and the duke of Anjou (1580; Harleian MSS. 180)
*&quot;A Defensative against the Poyson of supposed Prophecies&quot; (1583)
*A reply to a pamphlet denouncing female government (1589; Harleian Manuscript 7021)
*&quot;Duello Foiled&quot;, printed in Thomas Hearne&#x27;s &quot;Collection of Curious Discourses&quot; (1775), ii.225, and ascribed there to Sir Edward Coke
*&quot;Translation of Charles V&#x27;s Last Advice to Philip II&quot;, dedicated with a long epistle to the queen (Harl. 836, 1506 and elsewhere in Stowe 95, Kings Manuscripts 106)
*Devotional writings (Arundel Manuscripts 300)
*Speeches at the trials of Guy Fawkes and Garnet in &quot;State Trials&quot;, vol. I.
*In Somers&#x27; &quot;Tracts&quot; (ed. 1809), ii.136, his opinions on the union between England and Scotland are recorded.

==Building==
He enlarged Greenwich Castle (on the site of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich), and his London residence, afterwards Northumberland House, was built at his cost from the designs of Moses Glover. He supervised John Thorpe&#x27;s designs for Audley End, the residence of his nephew Suffolk. He planned and endowed three hospitals: Trinity Hospital at Clun, Shropshire; Trinity Hospital at Castle Rising, Norfolk, for twelve poor women; and a third Trinity Hospital at Greenwich, later called Norfolk College, for twelve poor natives of Greenwich, and for eight natives of Shottesham, Northampton&#x27;s birthplace. He laid the foundation-stone of the college at Greenwich, 25 February 1614, and placed its management under the Mercers&#x27; Company. His connection to the Mercers was principally through Lionel Cranfield.

During the funeral of Anne of Denmark in May 1619, a large stone letter &#x27;S&#x27; fell from the battlements of the frontispiece of Northampton House on the procession, killing one William Appleyard. According to Nathaniel Brent, the stone was &quot;thrust down by a gentlewoman who put her foot against it, not thinking it had been so brickle [brittle]&quot;.

<text>Samogitians (Samogitian: &quot;žemaitē&quot;, , ) are the inhabitants of Samogitia, an ethnographic region of Lithuania. Many speak the Samogitian language, which in Lithuania is mostly considered a dialect of the Lithuanian language together with the Aukštaitian dialect. The Samogitian language differs the most from the standard Lithuanian language.

Whether Samogitians are considered to be a distinct ethnic group or merely a subset of Lithuanians varies. However, 2,169 people declared their ethnicity as Samogitian during the Lithuanian census of 2011, of whom 53.9% live in Telšiai County. The political recognition and cultural understanding of the Samogitian ethnicity has, however, changed drastically throughout the last few centuries as 448,022 people declared themselves Samogitians, not Lithuanians, in the 1897 Russian Empire census.

==History==

On 13 July 1260, the Samogitians decisively defeated the joint forces of the Teutonic Knights from Prussia and Livonian Order from Livonia in the Battle of Durbe. Some 150 knights were killed, including Livonian Master Burchard von Hornhausen and Prussian Land Marshal Henrik Botel.
Samogitians lived in western Lithuania and were closely related to Semigallians and Curonians. In 1413, they became the last group of Europeans to convert to Christianity. Samogitians lived in the Duchy of Samogitia within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1857, there were 418,824 people of Samogitian roots and 444,921 persons declared the Samogitian language as their mother tongue in 1897 in Kovno Governorate. Currently Lithuania does not allow for declaration of Samogitian nationality in passports as it is not a recognized ethnicity. In list of ethnic groups of Russia there is one person who declared himself with &quot;Zhemaijty&quot;.

==Exonyms==
Samogitians call themselves &quot;žemaitē&quot;, although exonyms are used in different languages.

<text>101 Helena is a large, rocky main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by Canadian-American astronomer J. C. Watson on August 15, 1868, and was named after Helen of Troy in Greek mythology.

This object is orbiting the Sun with a period of 4.16 years and an eccentricity of 0.14. Its orbital plane is inclined by 10.2° to the plane of the ecliptic. Radar observations were made of this object on Oct 7 and 19, 2001 from the Arecibo Observatory. Analysis of the data gave an estimated ellipsoidal diameter of 71×63×63 ± 16% km. The mean diameter estimated from IRAS infrared measurements is 66 km, in agreement with the radar findings. It is classified as an S-type asteroid in the Tholen system, suggesting a predominantly silicate composition. 101 Helena is spinning on its axis with a period of 23 hours.

<text>102 Miriam is a moderately large, very dark main belt asteroid. It was discovered by C. H. F. Peters on August 22, 1868, from the Litchfield Observatory.

Peters named the asteroid after Miriam, the sister of Moses in the Old Testament. This caused some controversy, because at the time, asteroids were expected to be named after mythological figures, and devout Christians and Jews would not regard Biblical figures as such. According to fellow astronomer Edward S. Holden, Peters deliberately chose a name from the Bible so as to annoy an overly pious theology professor of his acquaintance.

Initially classified as a D-type asteroid, it was later classed as C-type based upon a broad absorption feature below 4,000 Å, most likely due to phyllosilicates on the surface. An occultation of the star HIP 37136 by 102 Miriam on February 15, 2000 was observed from multiple stations, with the chords yielding an estimated elliptical cross-section of .

Photometric observations of this asteroid during 2007 at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico, were used to create a light curve plot. This showed a rotation period of 23.613 ± 0.001 hours and a brightness variation of 0.12 ± 0.02 magnitude. The curve shows three maxima and minima during each cycle. This value for the period differs from the 15.789 hour estimate produced in a 2008 study.

<doc id="738592" wikidata="Q3329746" url="?curid=738592" title="Cul de Sac (band)">
<text>Cul de Sac were a rock group formed in 1990 in Boston, Massachusetts, and led by guitarist Glenn Jones. Their music is primarily instrumental. Jones and keyboardist Robin Amos have been the only constant members.

They have been classified by some as post rock, but Jones has expressed some discomfort with the term. He states that Cul de Sac is the most &quot;musically satisfying&quot; group he&#x27;s been involved with; a group that is the &quot;closest to being the band I&#x27;d dreamed of forming. It allows me to combine my love of open-tuned guitar, played fingerstyle, with my love for electronics and noise, all placed within a rhythmic rock framework.&quot; Jones occasionally plays &quot;The Contraption,&quot; a prepared lap steel guitar.

Cul de Sac performed at North East Sticks Together in 2006. They have collaborated with guitarist John Fahey and with Can singer Damo Suzuki.

The band has been inactive since 2009.

Glenn Jones has also recorded five solo albums, &quot;This Is the Wind That Blows It Out&quot; (2004), &quot;Against Which the Sea Continually Beats&quot; (2007), &quot;Barbecue Bob in Fishtown&quot; (2009), &quot;The Wanting&quot; (2011), and &quot;My Garden State&quot; (2013).

<text>A red star, five-pointed and filled, is a symbol that has often historically been associated with communist ideology, particularly in combination with the hammer and sickle, but is also used as a purely socialist symbol in the 21st century. It has been widely used in flags, state emblems, monuments, ornaments, and logos.

Some former Warsaw Pact nations have passed laws banning it, describing it as a totalitarian ideology. The red star has also been used in a non-communist context and before the emergence of this movement, in symbols of countries and states since the 19th century. It appears for example on the flags of New Zealand and the U.S. state of California. The red star has also been used as logo by private agencies and corporations, such as the oil giant Texaco and beer multinational Heineken.

== History ==
The star&#x27;s origins as a symbol of communist mass movements dates from the time of the Bolshevik Revolution and the Russian Civil War, but the precise first use remains unknown. The red star as a symbol of the Red Army was proposed by the Military Collegium for the organization of the Red Army and the creator of the Red Star emblem was the Bolshevik commander of the Petrograd Military District, Konstantin Eremeev. On the other hand, one account of the symbol&#x27;s origin traces its roots to the Moscow troop garrison toward the end of World War I. At this time, many troops were fleeing from the Austrian and German fronts, joining the local Moscow garrison upon their arrival in the city. To distinguish the Moscow troops from the influx of retreating front-liners, officers gave out tin stars to the Moscow garrison soldiers to wear on their hats. When those troops joined the Red Army and the Bolsheviks they painted their tin stars red, the color of socialism, thus creating the original red star.

The red star was used in communist media as early as in 1908 with the publication of the novel Red Star by Bolshevik revolutionary Alexander Bogdanov, which describes a technologically advanced communist civilization on Mars.

Another claimed origin for the red star relates to an alleged encounter between Leon Trotsky and Nikolai Krylenko. Krylenko, an Esperantist, wore a green-star lapel badge; Trotsky inquired as to its meaning and received an explanation that each arm of the star represented one of the five traditional continents. On hearing that, Trotsky specified that soldiers of the Red Army should wear a similar red star.

One interpretation sees the five points as representing the five fingers of the worker&#x27;s hand, as well as the five populated continents (counting the Americas as one). A lesser-known suggestion is that in communist symbolism, the five points on the star were intended to represent the five social groups that would lead Russia to communism: the youth, the military, the industrial labourers, the agricultural workers or peasantry and the intelligentsia. In Soviet heraldry, the red star symbolized the Red Army and military service, as opposed to the hammer and sickle, which symbolized peaceful labour.

Regardless of the star&#x27;s exact origin, it was incorporated into the Red Army&#x27;s uniforms and heraldry as early as 1918.
Shortly before the founding of the Soviet Union, in mid-March 1916 the U.S. Army Signal Corps&#x27; aviation section used the red star for the national insignia for U.S. aircraft on the aircraft of the Signal Corps&#x27; 1st Aero Squadron during the Pancho Villa Expedition to apprehend the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa.

=== Use in the USSR and its constituent republics ===
The symbol became one of the most prominent of the Soviet Union, adorning nearly all official buildings, awards and insignia. Sometimes the hammer and sickle appeared inside or below the star. In 1930 the Soviet Union established the Order of the Red Star and awarded its insignia to Red Army and Soviet Navy personnel for &quot;exceptional service in the cause of the defense of the Soviet Union in both war and peace&quot;. The Soviet and Russian Federation military newspaper bore and bears the name &quot;Red Star&quot; (Russian: &quot;Krasnaya Zvezda&quot;).

==== As a holiday ornament ====

During the 1930s, Soviet publications encouraged the practice of decorating a New Year&#x27;s tree, known as a &quot;yolka&quot; (). These trees were often decorated with a red star, a practice that has continued in Russia since the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union.

==== Gallery of Soviet flags ====
=== Use in other socialist countries ===
Following its adoption as an emblem of the Soviet Union, the red star became a symbol for communism around the world.

Several Communist states subsequently adopted the red star symbol, often placing it on their respective flags and coats of arms – for example on the flag of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Separatist and socialist movements also sometimes adopted the red star, as on the Estelada flag in the Catalan countries.

==== Eastern Bloc ====
The red star became a common element of the flags and heraldry of socialist states in the Eastern Bloc, appearing in heraldry for virtually all of the countries, and on the flags of Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Albania. From 1991 to 1995, Belarus dropped its Soviet-style emblem in favor of an emblem featuring the Pahonia; the Soviet-era heraldry was re-adopted in 1995, and continues to be used today with minor modifications in 2012 and 2020.

==== Yugoslavia ====
In former Yugoslavia the red star served not only a communist symbol, but also as a more generic symbol of resistance against Fascism and the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia, as well as of opposition to its associated ethnic policies. Tito&#x27;s partisans wore the red star as an identification symbol during World War II. 

==== Asia ====
As communist movements spread across Asia, some entities used a red star, while others used a yellow star (often on a red field) with the same symbolism. The Far Eastern Republic of 1920 to 1922 used a yellow star on its military uniforms, and the flag of the People&#x27;s Republic of China has five yellow stars on a red field. The flag of Vietnam also has a yellow star on a red field. Examples of communes and villages in China named after the red star include Hongxing Village in Huilong Township, Hubei, China and Kizilto in Xinjiang (named Hongxing Commune during the Cultural Revolution).

==== Africa ====
Socialist countries in Africa also incorporated the red or gold stars into their heraldry. This practice was also adopted by countries that formed following anti-colonial national liberation struggles, which often involved Marxist organizations.

==== State military units ====
By March 2010, the Russian government readopted the Soviet red star (but now with a blue outline reflecting the three colors – white, blue and red – of the Russian flag) as a military insignia. The Russian Air Force used this star as a roundel up to 2013, when Russia re-instated the Soviet-era red star.

 the Armed Forces of Belarus still use the old Soviet red star. The coat of arms of Armed Forces of the Republic of Kazakhstan includes a modified version of the Soviet red star.

==== By states with limited recognition ====
Transnistria and the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic are proto-states located in Eastern Europe. Due to their historical association with the Soviet Union, they have adopted socialist imagery – including the red star – into their flags and heraldry.

==== By sports teams ====
Several sporting clubs from countries ruled by communist parties used the red star as a symbol and named themselves after it, such as the Serbian club Red Star Belgrade ( / ), the East German Roter Stern Leipzig, the Angolan Estrela Vermelha do Huambo, the Estrela Vermelha from Beira, Mozambique or the Czechoslovak Rudá Hvězda Brno. Some sports teams from non-communist countries used it, such as French Red Star from Paris, Swiss club FC Red Star Zürich, English Seaham Red Star F.C., and even an American women&#x27;s soccer club (Chicago Stars FC (formerly Chicago Red Stars)—though in that case the star is based on the flag of Chicago and not on the communist logo). The American soccer clubs Sacramento Republic FC and D.C. United also use red stars in their logos, referencing the flags of California and the District of Columbia respectively. The German rowing club Pirnaer Ruderverein 1872 began (and continues) to use red star since the 19th century.

== Use by socialist groups ==
=== Armed revolutionary organizations ===
In 1970, the Red Army Faction, a West German militant group, used a red star paired with a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 in their highly recognizable insignia.

In 1994, the red star was included in the flag of the armed revolutionary Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) in Chiapas, Mexico.

A number of communist parties in Turkey utilize the red star. Likewise, a number of Kurdish revolutionary organizations connected to the Kurdistan Communities Union utilize the red star in their iconography. Those include the flags of the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party and the battle flag pennants of the People&#x27;s Defence Forces and Free Women&#x27;s Units in Turkish Kurdistan, the People&#x27;s Protection Units and Women&#x27;s Protection Units in Syrian Kurdistan, and the Eastern Kurdistan Units and Women&#x27;s Defense Forces in Iranian Kurdistan.

The Iranian Islamist-Socialist militant opposition group the Mojahedin-e-Khalq uses the red star with the rifle, sickle and the map of Iran in the background.

=== Political parties and movements ===
The Brazilian leftist Worker&#x27;s Party uses a red star as its symbol with the party acronym () inside. Hugo Chávez and his supporters in Venezuela have used the red star in numerous symbols and logos, and have included it in the logo of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). It was also used throughout 2007 as a symbol of the &quot;5 Engines of the Bolivarian Socialist Revolution&quot;. It is also used by the militant South African shack-dweller&#x27;s movement Abahlali baseMjondolo. Like in Latin America and Africa, several European socialist parties continue to use a star as a part of their logos. The red star is also featured prominently in the independence flags of various separatist movements in Spain.
== Uses without socialist symbolism ==
Some red stars adopted in emblems and flags have a significance that does not originally relate to socialism. Among these, the most well-known include the current state flag of California (echoing the Californian red star flag of 1836) and the flag of New Zealand (designed in 1869, officially adopted in 1902). The flag of the District of Columbia (designed in 1921, adopted in 1938) recalls George Washington&#x27;s coat of arms. DC Comics&#x27; Wonder Woman also wears a 5-point red star headband with gold or yellow background.

=== Crescent moon and star ===
The crescent moon and star was a symbol used by the Ottoman Empire. Various states with Ottoman history have thus adopted this symbol into their present-day flags.

=== Assorted Flags and Coats of Arms ===
=== Symbol of animal relief ===
The red star was adopted as the symbol of the International Red Star Alliance, a Geneva international treaty signed in 1914 with the purpose of bringing about international cooperation on behalf of sick and wounded war animals, while securing the neutral status of the personnel engaged in such work. Besides the International Alliance, national Red Star societies were also established. Regarding animal relief, the International Red Star Alliance had an analogous role of that of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. To identify their neutral status, white brassards with red stars were worn by military veterinary personnel in World War I in a similar way medical personal worn brassards with red crosses.

Following the War, the American Red Star turned to focus on domestic issues, including care for animals during disasters. The organization waxed and waned over the decades, and exists as the American Humane Association&#x27;s Red Star Animal Emergency Services.
== Red stars in labels and logos ==

The red star was used by the Texaco oil company in various forms from 1909 to 1981. Its overseas division Caltex also used the red star until 1996. Red Star Yeast was produced for a century in Milwaukee, Baltimore, and Oakland before its subsumption as a brand by Lesaffre.

A brand of Erguotou, a type of Baijiu, was named &quot;Hongxing&quot; () in 1949 to celebrate the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

North Korea&#x27;s Red Star operating system takes its name from the communist red star.

Red stars were included in the symbolism of many shipowners, such as Puget Sound Navigation Co. (1898–1927), Bombay Steam Navigation Co (since the 19th century), London &amp; Overseas Freighters (1948–1997) and Columbia Transportation Division of the Oglebay Norton Corporation. The two companies were independently named Red Star Line in the 19th century.

== Legal status ==

The red star and the hammer and sickle are regarded as occupation symbols as well as symbols of totalitarianism and state terror by several countries that were formerly either members of or occupied by the Soviet Union. Accordingly, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and Ukraine have banned the symbol among others deemed to be symbols of totalitarian political ideologies and the Soviet Union or its republics. In Poland, the Parliament passed in 2009 a ban that referred generally to &quot;fascist, communist or other totalitarian symbols&quot;, while not specifying any of them. Following a constitutional complaint, it has been abolished by the Constitutional Tribunal as contrary to articles in the Constitution of Poland guaranteeing the freedom of speech. A similar law was considered in Estonia, but eventually failed in a parliamentary committee due to its conflict with freedoms guaranteed by the constitution of Estonia.

The European Court of Human Rights has ruled, in a similar manner, against the laws that ban political symbols, which were deemed to be in clear opposition with basic human rights, such as freedom of speech, confirmed again in 2011 in case &quot;Fratanolo v. Hungary&quot;. The decision has been compared to the legislation concerning the symbols of Nazism, which continue to be banned in several European Union member states, including Germany and France.

There have been calls for an EU-wide ban on both Soviet and Nazi symbols, notably by politicians from Lithuania, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. The European Commissioner for Justice, Franco Frattini, felt it &quot;might not be appropriate&quot; to include communist symbols in the context of discussions on xenophobia and anti-Semitism.

In 2003, Hungarian politician Attila Vajnai was arrested, handcuffed and fined for wearing a red star on his lapel during a demonstration. He appealed his sentence to the European Court of Human Rights, which decided that the ban was a violation of the freedom of expression, calling the Hungarian ban &quot;indiscriminate&quot; and &quot;too broad&quot;.

In Slovenia, the red star was historically associated with the resistance movement that fought against fascist occupation in World War II, but was also later a state symbol of Yugoslavia during the dictatorship of Josip Broz Tito. On 21 March 2011, Slovenia issued a two-euro commemorative coin to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Franc Rozman, a partisan commander, featuring a large star that represented a red star. This led to criticism from the Slovenian democratic parties without a communist history.

<text>Gertrude Himmelfarb (August 8, 1922 – December 30, 2019), also known as Bea Kristol, was an American historian. She was a leader of conservative interpretations of history and historiography. She wrote extensively on intellectual history, with a focus on Great Britain and the Victorian era, as well as on contemporary society and culture.

==Biography==
Himmelfarb was born in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Bertha (née Lerner) and Max Himmelfarb, both of Russian Jewish background. She received her undergraduate degree from Brooklyn College in 1942 and her doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1950. Himmelfarb later went on to study at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, and the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York.

In 1942, she married Irving Kristol, known as the &quot;godfather&quot; of neoconservatism, and had two children, Elizabeth Nelson and William Kristol, a political commentator and editor of The Weekly Standard. She never changed her last name. Sociologist Daniel Bell wrote that theirs was &quot;the best marriage of our generation&quot; and her husband wrote that he was “astonished how intellectually twinned” the two were “pursuing different subjects while thinking the same thoughts and reaching the same conclusions”.

She was long involved in Jewish conservative intellectual circles. Professor Emerita at the Graduate School of the City University of New York, she was the recipient of many awards and honorary degrees. She served on the Council of Scholars of the Library of Congress, the Council of Academic Advisors of the American Enterprise Institute, and the Council of the National Endowment for the Humanities. She was a Fellow of the British Academy and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the American Philosophical Society. In 1991, she delivered the Jefferson Lecture under the auspices of the National Endowment for the Humanities. In 2004, she was awarded the National Humanities Medal by President George W. Bush. Himmelfarb died from heart failure at her home in Washington on December 30, 2019, at the age of 97.

==Historiography==
Himmelfarb long nurtured the neoconservative movement in U.S. politics and intellectual life; her husband, Irving Kristol, helped found the movement.

Himmelfarb was a leading defender of traditional historical methods and practices. Her book, &quot;The New History and the Old&quot; (published in 1987 and revised and expanded in 2004), is a critique of the varieties of &quot;new history&quot; that have sought to displace the old. The &quot;New Histories&quot; she critiqued include: quantitative history that presumes to be more &quot;scientific&quot; than conventional history, but relies on partial and dubious data; Marxist historiography derived from economic assumptions and class models that leave little room for the ideas and beliefs of contemporaries or the protagonists and events of history; psychoanalytic history dependent on theories and speculations that violate the accepted criteria of historical evidence; analytic history that reduces history to a series of isolated &quot;moments&quot; with no overriding narrative structure; social history, &quot;history from the bottom&quot;, that denigrates the role of politics, nationality, and individuals (the &quot;great men&quot; of history); and, later, postmodernist history, which denies even the ideal of objectivity, viewing all of history as a &quot;social construct&quot; on the part of the historian.

Himmelfarb criticized A.J.P. Taylor for seeking to &quot;demoralize&quot; history in his 1961 book &quot;The Origins of the Second World War&quot;, and for refusing to recognize &quot;moral facts&quot; about interwar Europe. Himmelfarb maintained that Taylor was wrong to treat Adolf Hitler as a &quot;normal&quot; German leader playing by the traditional rules of diplomacy in &quot;The Origins of the Second World War,&quot; instead of being a &quot;world-historical&quot; figure such as Napoleon.

Himmelfarb energetically rejected postmodern academic approaches:

==Ideas==
Himmelfarb was best known as a historian of Victorian England. Himmelfarb argued &quot;for the reintroduction of traditional values such as shame, responsibility, chastity, and self-reliance, into American political life and policy-making&quot;.

In an obituary, David Brooks described Himmelfarb as &quot;The Historian of Moral Revolution&quot;.

<text>Tsuen Wan () is the northern terminus of the MTR in Hong Kong. It is the only station on the Tsuen Wan line at ground level. It is located in the northern central part of Tsuen Wan New Town, New Territories West. The preceding station is .

It was the westernmost station in the MTR system until the opening of the in 1998. It was also the northernmost station in the MTR system until the MTR–KCR merger.

==History==
The station opened as part of the line opening on 10 May 1982. A commemorative plaque in the station concourse, near exit A, was unveiled by Acting Governor Sir Philip Haddon-Cave. The station was designed as an intermediate station with two side platforms, with trains terminating at Tsuen Wan West, further northwest near Tsuen King Garden, different from the present Tsuen Wan West station. It was built by Dragages, along with the line&#x27;s depot.

The area around the proposed terminus had a poor development record and it was decided to not build a station there, causing the station to use different platforms for loading and unloading. After leaving the unloading platform, trains enter the section of track beyond the station to proceed to the Tsuen Wan Depot or reverse back to the loading platform to head towards .

During the construction of the station, Route Twisk was diverted. The Sam Tung Uk walled village was also relocated, though it was later preserved as a museum.

New roads and shopping centres were set up around the station, and a private housing estate was built directly above the station. A bus interchange was set up under one of the shopping centres.

==Usage==
The usage of the station was low when it opened in 1982, as the station was located in the northern edge of Tsuen Wan town, with the connecting infrastructure being incomplete, making it difficult to attract residents in the town centre to take the use the station.

After 20 years of development, the area around the station gradually took over as the town centre. Several shopping malls were constructed near the station, and an extensive footbridge network was built to connect to nearby shopping malls, the original town centre, and some villages to the north. 

The station also acts as an important transportation interchange, with numerous bus and minibus routes serving near the station. Commuters from northwest New Territories used to change buses at this station to continue their journey into Kowloon by MTR, before the opened in 2003.

==Refurbishment==
The station was refurbished twice. In the early 1990s, a Chinese-style design was introduced inside the station. This design was removed after the second refurbishment in 2004, where more shops were set up in the station (a common practice of MTR station refurbishments in the 2000s). Gates were relocated to handle more passengers.

==Station layout==
Platforms 1 and 2 are both located at ground level, and the tracks are located right next to each other. One platform is used for boarding and the other is used for alighting. Two new exits have been built next to Platform 1, allowing passengers to leave the station without going up the escalators and coming back down again. Passengers entering the station via these exits will have to take an escalator up to the concourse, cross to the other side for the down escalator for Platform 2.

<text>Red Star () is a science fiction novel by Russian writer Alexander Bogdanov, published in 1908, about a communist society on Mars. The first edition was published in St. Petersburg in 1908, before eventually being republished in Moscow and Petrograd in 1918, and then again in Moscow in 1922. Set in early Russia during the Revolution of 1905 and additionally on a fictional socialist society on Mars, the novel tells the story of Leonid, a Russian scientist-revolutionary who travels to Mars to learn and experience their socialist system and to teach them of his own world. In the process, he becomes enamored of the people and technological efficiency that he encounters in this new world. An English translation by Charles Rougle was published in 1984.

==Plot summary==
===Part I===
Leonid, the narrator and protagonist of the story, is a Bolshevik revolutionary and mathematician living in St. Petersburg. The novel begins with an explanation of Leonid&#x27;s few relationships within the revolutionary movement and with his love interest, Anna Nikolaevna. Despite his intimate relationship with Anna, Leonid confesses in the opening pages that their ideological differences concerning the revolution were too extreme for him to overcome. It is at this point in his life that Leonid, informally known as Lenni, is visited by Menni, a Martian in disguise. Almost immediately after they become acquainted, Menni invites Leonid to assist in a project designed to study and visit other planets, such as Venus and Mars. At first, however, Menni fails to reveal that the true purpose of the visit would be for Leonid to teach his own culture to Martians and to simultaneously understand and experience theirs; this point is only revealed to Leonid after he has embarked on the journey to Mars.

The trip is accomplished by the &quot;etheroneph&quot;, a combination of nuclear rocket and anti-gravity device. On their way to Mars, Leonid is exposed gradually to Martians and their society. He is introduced to all of the other Martian travelers, such as Netti and Sterni, who he remarks as bearing very few individually distinguishable features, even when comparing opposite genders. With the help of Menni and Netti, his doctor, Leonid is able to speak the Martian language by the time they arrive. During an attempt to acquaint himself with all of the other travelers, Leonid partakes in a scientific experiment with an elder Martian named Letta. However, the experiment fails and causes a puncture in the etheroneph&#x27;s hull, causing Letta to sacrifice himself and plug the hole with his body. As a result of this, Leonid feels responsible for the elder Martian&#x27;s death. This is also the first notable instance of a strong emotional response by the crew, as they are deeply saddened by Letta&#x27;s passing (especially Netti).

Part 1 concludes with their arrival on the planet of Mars.

===Part II===
At this point in the novel, Bogdanov details some of the aspects of the socialist Martian society as seen through Leonid’s eyes. First, Leonid comments that the red hue of Mars is actually due to the red vegetation that covers the planet. Secondly, he remarks on the living conditions of the Martians, noting that they are indistinguishable from one another. Thus, even a Martian like Menni, whom Leonid perceives to be more accomplished individually than most of his peers, lives in the same housing as the rest of his Martian compatriots. Thirdly, Leonid learns that there is no professional specialization among Martians such that an individual can enroll himself for work in a clothing factory one day and switch to food production the next day. In fact, job assignments are chosen based on societal need, and there is furthermore no requirement for an individual to work at all; yet, almost all Martians decide to work a varying number of hours anyway in order to feel fulfilled and accomplished. Leonid soon learns that there is no focus on or appreciation for the individual whatsoever in this Martian society, but rather admiration arises for collective effort and decides to leave.

Eventually, the unfamiliarity of Mars and the stress of his mission exhaust Leonid to the point of being delusional and he becomes bedridden with severe auditory and visual hallucinations. Just in time, Netti is alerted to his condition and treats him for his severe illness. While Leonid is recovering, he finds out, contrary to his original assumption, that Netti is female. His previous feelings for her are then only deepened and they quickly fall in love with one another as Part 2 comes to a close.

===Part III===
As Leonid continues to build upon his relationship with Netti, he finds himself increasingly enjoying his time on Mars. He has formed strong bonds with a number of Martians, such as Netti and Menni, and has found himself a steady position working at the clothing factory, albeit at a noticeably less efficient pace than the Martians around him. However, it is soon after this period that both Netti and Menni are called away for what is described initially as a mining expedition to Venus. While they are away, Leonid develops a relationship with Enno, another fellow shipmate from his arrival to the planet whom he assumed to be male but is in fact a female. During their time together, Enno revealed that she used to be the wife of Menni, and likewise Netti used to be married to Sterni (yet another shipmate). This revelation of Netti&#x27;s previous marriage emotionally shakes Leonid, and he resorts to speaking with Netti&#x27;s mother, Nella, who produces a note written by Netti in which she confesses her love for Leonid despite her previous relationship. It is here that yet another idealized socialist aspect of Martian society is realized - the fluidity of love and the ability for a Martian to have multiple lovers and maintain multiple relationships, both at once and over the course of a lifetime.

While discovering many other things about the nature of personal relationships on Mars, Leonid uncovers frightening information. He discovers that the council in charge of the Venus expedition was vying for either Venus&#x27;s or Earth’s colonization as a possible solution to their hitherto untold problem of overpopulation on Mars. It is revealed to Leonid here that the true motive behind Menni and Netti&#x27;s expedition to Venus was to consider its habitability. Yet, as the recording of the debate that Leonid is watching seems to conclude, Venus is seemingly inhospitable, leaving Earth as the sole suitable host to be colonized by the Martians, for slowing population growth was out of the question and seen as regressive. The argument presented by Sterni in this conference states that colonization of Earth is the only feasible solution and that such an expansion would only be made possible if Earth’s human population was eradicated. It is only through the negative feedback presented by Netti and Menni that a final effort to visit Venus is allowed. As Leonid’s emotional state is not fully recovered from his exhaustion, this news sends him into a state of psychosis. His resolution is to murder Sterni, which he proceeds to do. Part 3 closes with Leonid&#x27;s realization that his act of murder likely only cast Earth and its inhabitants into a worse light, and he commits himself to leave Mars and subsequently returns to Earth in a hopeless mental state.

===Part IV===
Leonid finds himself in the mental health clinic of Dr. Werner, an old comrade. In a meeting with Dr. Werner, Leonid attempts to confess his murder of Sterni but Werner casts it aside as a symptom of Leonid&#x27;s disease, and tells Leonid that none of the events on Mars actually occurred, and that his memories are simply an effect of his delirium. In his stay at Werner&#x27;s clinic, he spends one day searching through Werner&#x27;s office and finds the scraps of a letter containing Netti&#x27;s handwriting, thus convincing him that Netti is on Earth. Once he is fully recovered, Leonid leaves the hospital with the assistance of a friendly guard and rejoins the revolutionary fight, but this time with a matured perspective. The novel ends with a letter from Dr. Werner to Mirsky (a character assumed to be Georgi Plekhanov). In this letter, Leonid’s reunion with Netti is described and it is inferred that they have returned to Mars together.

==Characters==
* Leonid: The main character and narrator, Leonid is a mathematician-philosopher-revolutionist who is chosen to accompany the Martians back to Mars in order to learn of their socialist system, and to help them understand his own. He is a native Russian and begins the story living in St. Petersburg. He was chosen for the mission because the Martians believe that he has both the mental and physical faculties to withstand the change in society and planet. Upon murdering Sterni and returning to Earth, however, Leonid ponders how and why he failed his mission, and more importantly why he was chosen to visit Mars in the first place. Leonid&#x27;s life closely resembles Bogdanov’s own, giving the assumption that his character was inspired from Bogdanov&#x27;s own life.
* Menni: Menni is the chief engineer for the expedition to Earth. He is Leonid’s first friend and one of the only two Martians who speaks Russian directly with Leonid. He is also the captain of the ship to Earth, although he occupies no higher societal role than does any other Martian. Once they have landed on Mars, Menni becomes occupied with the commission to colonize Venus and becomes a secondary, and rather obsolete, character. This Menni is a descendant of the engineer Menni of the prequel novel; he has a portrait of his famous namesake ancestor on the wall. 
* Netti: Netti is a doctor that specializes in foreign organisms, such as Leonid for example. She first appears in the novel as an aid to Leonid’s sleeping problems on the ship to Mars. Leonid assumes at first that Netti is male, but later discovers that she is female, at which point they fall in love. As Leonid&#x27;s love interest, she occupies a very important role and reappears consistently throughout the novel. Netti’s character is possibly inspired by Bogdanov’s own experience as a physician.
* Enno: Enno is a minor character that is a member of the crew for the expedition to Earth. Leonid mistook Enno, like Netti, for a male when she is in fact female. While Netti and Menni are away on the mission to Venus, Leonid and Enno engage in an amorous relationship, although not nearly to the extent of Leonid&#x27;s relationship with Netti. The purpose of her character seems primarily to divulge Netti&#x27;s previous marriage to Sterni.
* Sterni: Sterni is a minor character that is a member of the crew for the expedition to Earth, and specifically a mathematician and scientist. He is described as having a cold and overly scientific demeanor and intellect. His suggestion to the commission for colonization to take Earth is what eventually causes his death, as he is murdered by Leonid.
* Nella: Nella is the mother of Netti, and works as the head of a childcare facility. She appears in the story to deliver her daughter&#x27;s message of love to Leonid, which quells Leonid&#x27;s mental unrest caused by the knowledge of Netti&#x27;s prior involvement with Sterni.
* Dr. Werner: Dr. Werner is a minor character that only enters the novel at the very end. He is Leonid’s doctor on earth and his character serves as a venue in which to conclude the novel. Dr. Werner was also a pseudonym that Bogdanov used.

==Sequels==
Bogdanov followed the novel with a prequel in 1913, &quot;Engineer Menni&quot;, which detailed the creation of the communist society on Mars. The titular character is a famous ancestor of the namesake Menni who befriends Leonid in &quot;Red Star&quot;. His fame came from running the canal-building projects of earlier centuries on Mars, which happened in Mars&#x27;s presocialist era.

In 1924 Bogdanov published a poem entitled &quot;A Martian Stranded on Earth&quot; that was to be the outline for a third novel, but he did not finish it before his death.

==Cultural influences==
&quot;Red Star&quot; was influential on American writer Kim Stanley Robinson. His character Arkady Bogdanov, from his Mars Trilogy, is supposed to be a descendant of Alexander Bogdanov.

<doc id="738613" wikidata="Q1230986" url="?curid=738613" title="Patriation">
<text>Patriation is the political process that led to full Canadian sovereignty, culminating with the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;. The process was necessary because, at the time, under the &quot;Statute of Westminster, 1931&quot;, and with Canada&#x27;s agreement, the British Parliament retained the power to amend Canada&#x27;s &quot;British North America Acts&quot; and to enact, more generally, for Canada at the request and with the consent of the Dominion. That authority was removed from the UK by the enactment of the &quot;Canada Act, 1982&quot;, on March 29, 1982, by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, as requested by the Parliament of Canada.

A proclamation bringing the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, into effect was signed by Elizabeth II, as Queen of Canada, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and Minister of Justice Jean Chrétien on April 17, 1982, on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. The patriation process saw the provinces granted influence in constitutional matters and resulted in the constitution being amendable by Canada only and according to its amending formula, with no role for the United Kingdom.

The monarch&#x27;s constitutional powers over Canada were not affected by the act. Canada has complete sovereignty as an independent country; the role of the monarch of Canada is distinct from that of the monarch of the UK or any other Commonwealth realm.

The &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; formed the template for the removal of the British Parliament&#x27;s powers over other similar Commonwealth realms. In 1986, the Australia Act 1986 and the Constitution Act 1986 (New Zealand) also confirmed the total independence of the two countries&#x27; political processes from the United Kingdom.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;patriation&quot; was coined in Canada as a back-formation from &quot;repatriation&quot; (returning to one&#x27;s country). Prior to 1982, power to amend the Canadian constitution was held by the Parliament of the United Kingdom (subject in some respects to request and consent from Canada); hence some have felt that the term &quot;patriation&quot; was more suitable than the term &quot;repatriation&quot; (returning something). The term was first used in 1966 by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson in response to a question in Parliament: &quot;We intend to do everything we can to have the constitution of Canada repatriated, or patriated.&quot;

==Early attempts==
From 1867, the constitution of Canada was primarily contained in the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; and other &quot;British North America Acts&quot;, which were passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Several Canadian prime ministers, starting with William Lyon Mackenzie King in 1927, had made attempts to domesticize the amending formula, but could not obtain agreement with the provincial governments as to how such a formula would work. Thus, even after the &quot;Statute of Westminster&quot; granted Canada and other Commonwealth nations full legislative independence in 1931, Canada requested that the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;, be excluded from the laws that were now within Canada&#x27;s complete control to amend; until 1949, the constitution could only be changed by a further act at Westminster. The &quot;British North America (No. 2) Act, 1949&quot;, granted the Parliament of Canada limited power to amend the constitution in many areas of its own jurisdiction, without involvement of the United Kingdom. The constitution was amended in this manner five times: in 1952, 1965, 1974, and twice in 1975.

Negotiations continued sporadically between federal and provincial governments on the development of a new amending formula in which the United Kingdom would have no part. In the 1960s, efforts by the governments of Prime Ministers John Diefenbaker and Lester Pearson, including the Confederation of Tomorrow conference in Canada&#x27;s centennial year, culminated in the Fulton–Favreau formula, but without Quebec&#x27;s endorsement, the patriation attempt failed.

In 1968, Pearson was succeeded by Pierre Trudeau, who also advocated patriation. He made several attempts, including the Victoria Charter in 1971 and more proposed amendments in 1978. At the 1978–1979 conference, Trudeau prepared for the first time to provide some federal concessions with regard to the division of powers, including family law, fisheries, and resources. However, the other premiers balked, which led to speculation they were waiting to see if the more province-friendly Progressive Conservatives would win the coming federal election. In that campaign, the Liberals ran on constitutional change, including a speech at Maple Leaf Gardens in which Trudeau promised unilateral action if the premiers did not agree to patriation.

==Patriation achieved==
Patriation was given a new impetus after the 1980 referendum on Quebec independence, before which Trudeau promised a new constitutional agreement if the majority of Quebecers voted &quot;No&quot;. As the referendum did result in a majority rejecting separation, Trudeau approached his British counterpart, Margaret Thatcher, to inform her the Canadian government wanted to patriate the constitution. Thatcher&#x27;s reply was that the British Parliament would allow this, with provincial approval or not.

After a number of days of negotiation between Trudeau and the premiers and the leak of the Kirby Memo by an &quot;internal federal source&quot;, which antagonized Quebec, the premiers consulted at the Chateau Laurier and drafted a list of 10 powers to be devolved to the provinces in exchange for consent to patriation. Trudeau, when presented with the document, refused to accept it and reiterated his threat that he would seek the House of Commons&#x27; approval to proceed with a unilateral amendment. Faced with Premier of Manitoba Sterling Lyon&#x27;s charge that it would &quot;tear the country apart&quot;, Trudeau responded that, if Canada could not have control of its own constitution and a charter when most provinces had their own, the country would deserve to be torn apart. This led Thatcher to take a less certain view of how things might proceed through the British legislature, sensing the provincial opposition would make the legislation controversial in Parliament.

===Canada Bill and provincial opposition===
Trudeau announced his belief that the premiers were dealing in bad faith and met with his caucus to propose a new course. After offering a wide range of options and proposing full reform, a Quebec MP shouted &quot;&quot; (translated by Trudeau to mean &quot;let&#x27;s go first class ... be liberal to the end ... not to temper our convictions with political expediency&quot;). Taking the proposal to Cabinet, some ministers suggested using the manoeuvre to increase federal power over the economy, but Trudeau demurred, replying &quot;we shouldn&#x27;t upset the balance&quot;. On October 2, 1980, he announced on national television his intention to proceed with unilateral patriation in what he termed the &quot;people&#x27;s package&quot;. The proposal would request patriation from the UK Parliament, as well as the entrenchment of a charter of rights, and would call for a referendum to be held within two years on the amending formula for the new constitution, which would be a choice between the Victoria Charter veto formula and any joint proposal by the provinces that could be approved by provinces totalling 80% of the population. In the same month, the attorneys general of six provinces launched suits in three provincial courts, seeking clarity on whether or not the federal Cabinet could request the British Parliament pass legislation that would alter the balance of power between the provincial and federal crowns without the support of provincial governments. The British government became adverse to introducing any bill that might be found to be unconstitutional.
Trudeau found new allies in Premiers Bill Davis (Ontario) and Richard Hatfield (New Brunswick) and the federal New Democratic Party, under Ed Broadbent, announced its support after persuading Trudeau to devolve some resource powers to the provinces. The Prime Minister&#x27;s proposal in the House of Commons, which would be tabled as the Canada Bill, invited Aboriginal, feminist, and other groups to Ottawa for their input on the charter of rights in legislative committees. However, there was disagreement over the charter, which the premiers of six provinces (Lyon, René Lévesque of Quebec, Bill Bennett of British Columbia, Angus MacLean of Prince Edward Island, Peter Lougheed of Alberta, and Brian Peckford of Newfoundland) opposed as encroachments on their power; the press dubbed this the &quot;Gang of Six&quot;. Manitoba, Newfoundland, and Quebec launched references to their respective Courts of Appeal asking if the Canada Bill was constitutional. Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan remained neutral.

At the insistence of British Columbia, the premiers who opposed unilateral patriation drafted an alternative proposal to showcase the disagreement between the sides and to counter the federal government&#x27;s charges of obstructionism if the document were to proceed to Westminster. The idea was for patriation to take place with no charter of rights and the amending formula would permit amendment with the approval of seven provinces consisting of 50% of the population, referred to as the &quot;Vancouver Formula&quot;. The premiers&#x27; innovation was a clause allowing for dissenting provinces to &quot;opt out&quot; of new amendments that superseded provincial jurisdiction and receive equivalent funding to run a substitute programme if two-thirds of the members of the provincial legislature acquiesced. Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan approved of this, prompting the press to now call the opposition premiers the &quot;Gang of Eight&quot;.

Trudeau rejected the proposed document out of hand and again threatened to take the case for patriation straight to the British Parliament &quot;[without] bothering to ask one premier.&quot; The federal Cabinet and Crown counsel took the position that if the British Crown—in Council, in Parliament, and on the bench—was to exercise its residual sovereignty over Canada, it did so at the request of the federal ministers of the Crown only. Further, officials in the United Kingdom indicated that the British Parliament was under no obligation to fulfill any request for legal changes made by Trudeau, particularly if Canadian convention was not being followed. The British Commons Foreign Affairs Committee drafted a report in January 1981 stating it would be wrong for the Parliament of the United Kingdom to enact the proposals regardless of the provincial opposition.

===Patriation Reference===

The Courts of Appeal in Newfoundland, Quebec, and Manitoba delivered their opinions on the reference questions in the second quarter of 1981. The Manitoba and Quebec Courts of Appeal answered the questions posed by their provincial governments in favour of the federal government, ruling that there was no constitutional objection to the federal government proceeding unilaterally. The Court of Appeal of Newfoundland, however, ruled in favour of the provincial government. It held that both as a matter of constitutional law and constitutional convention, the federal government could not request the proposed amendments from the British Parliament without the consent of the provinces. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The governments of Manitoba and Quebec appealed from the decisions of the Courts of Appeal in those provinces and the federal government appealed from the decision of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal.

On September 28, 1981, the court ruled (on live television, for the first time) that the federal government had the right, by letter of the law, to proceed with the unilateral patriation of the constitution (the decision was seven to two in favour). However, by a different six-to-three majority, the court said that the constitution was made up as much of convention as written law and ruled that a unilateral patriation was not in accordance with constitutional convention. Although the courts enforce laws, not constitutional conventions, the court&#x27;s decision stated that agreement by a &quot;substantial&quot; number of premiers would be required to abide by the convention. This number was not defined and commentators later criticized the court&#x27;s failure to rule that the approval of all provinces was required. The decision was controversial and a loss for the premiers. Lévesque would later remark, &quot;in other words, Trudeau&#x27;s goals might be unconstitutional, illegitimate, and even &#x27;go against the principles of federalism&#x27;, but they were legal!&quot; Trudeau, in his memoirs, paraphrased the court as saying &quot;that patriation was legal, but not nice&quot;.

Both the United Kingdom and Canada undertook contingency preparations: Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s British cabinet explored simply unilaterally patriating the constitution to Canada with an amending formula requiring unanimous approval of the provinces. Trudeau began to plan for a referendum proposing a unilateral declaration of independence in the event of a United Kingdom refusal.

===Constitutional Conference, November 1981===
The decision set the stage for a meeting amongst all premiers and Trudeau in Ottawa, on November 2, 1981. The conference opened with Trudeau announcing an openness to a new amending formula, Davis postulating that his cabinet could accept an agreement without an Ontario veto, and Hatfield proposing deferral of some elements of a charter. This was seen as a general opening toward the provincial proposal, though Trudeau declared the charter was non-negotiable.
On November 3, a compromise put to Trudeau involving amending the Group of Eight&#x27;s proposal with a limited charter was met with a blunt refusal, with federal officials declining a &quot;gutted charter&quot;, while Lévesque and Trudeau argued on the language provisions of the charter. On November 4, the premiers&#x27; breakfast meeting saw two new proposals floated: The Premier of Saskatchewan, Allan Blakeney, would accept a charter without language rights and constitutional amendment by any seven provinces, regardless of population and the removal of financial compensation, while Bennett would allow Trudeau his language rights provisions in exchange for other considerations. Lyon and Lévesque were angered and refused to go along, with Lougheed successfully suggesting the ideas be proposed to test Trudeau&#x27;s negotiating position. In return, Trudeau launched a new federal initiative to the premiers: patriate the constitution as it was, but continue debates for two years and, if deadlock resulted, hold a national referendum on the amending formula and charter. Lévesque, fearing the alliance was crumbling and facing mocking remarks by Trudeau that as a &quot;great democrat&quot; (especially after the recent referendum he initiated on Quebec&#x27;s independence), but confident he could ensure any referendum on a charter would fail, agreed in principle. Trudeau promptly announced a &quot;Canada–Quebec alliance&quot; on the issue to the press, stating &quot;the cat is among the pigeons.&quot;

The other seven opposition premiers were startled: Campaigning against the protection of rights was generally seen as political suicide and a national referendum could be seen as &quot;conventionalizing&quot; the charter without the need for provincial approval. Further, Canadians nationwide were mostly in agreement with Trudeau on the issue and were tired of the constant constitutional talks; The draft text of the Federal proposal was later revealed to involve the approval of Trudeau&#x27;s reforms, with referendums being only if provinces representing 80% of the population demanded them within the two years. This prompted Lévesque to back away from the referendum proposal, saying it looked as though it was &quot;written in Chinese.&quot; The conference descended again into acrimony, with Trudeau and Lévesque angrily clashing over language rights. Trudeau announced that he would attend one final meeting at 9am the following day and head to Westminster if agreement was not reached. Peckford announced that Newfoundland would forward a proposal the next day. Lévesque and the Quebec delegation went to sleep in Hull, Quebec, for the night.

===Kitchen Accord===
That afternoon—November 4, 1981—the Minister of Justice, Jean Chrétien, met with Attorney General of Saskatchewan Roy Romanow and Attorney General of Ontario Roy McMurtry in the kitchen of Ottawa&#x27;s Government Conference Centre. The attorneys general discussed a scenario in which the provinces would agree to the charter and disallowing opting-out with compensation, while Chrétien agreed to the Vancouver amending formula and reluctantly offered to include the notwithstanding clause in the constitution. Chrétien, who had been deeply involved in supporting the &quot;no&quot; side of the Quebec referendum and abhorred the possibility of another one, recommended the compromise to Trudeau, but the Prime Minister felt, given the previous chaos, it would still be impossible to obtain the agreement of his provincial counterparts and demurred. In the evening, Davis, however, agreed in principle to the compromise and told Trudeau that he should do so as well, informing him he would not be on his side if he proceeded unilaterally at that point. Trudeau, who knew that his position in London was growing tenuous, even with the support he had, accepted. Thus, working with the draft proposal created by the Newfoundland delegation, the six groups worked through the night to prepare the compromise proposal. This period would be called the &quot;Kitchen Accord&quot;; the men at the table that night became known as the &quot;Kitchen Cabinet&quot;. In exchange for agreeing to the inclusion of the notwithstanding clause, Trudeau declined to remove the federal powers of disallowance and reservation from the draft Constitution.

At the end of this period of negotiations, René Lévesque left to sleep at Hull, a city on the other side of the Ottawa river, before leaving he asked the other premiers (who were all lodged in Ottawa) to call him if anything happened.
Lévesque and his people, all in Quebec, remained ignorant of the agreement until Lévesque walked into the premiers&#x27; breakfast and was told the agreement had been reached. Lévesque refused to give his support to the deal and left the meeting; the government of Quebec subsequently announced on November 25, 1981, that it would veto the decision. However, both the Quebec Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, which issued its ruling on the matter on December 6, 1982, stated that Quebec had never held such veto powers.

The events were divisive. Quebec nationalists saw the deal as the English-speaking premiers betraying Quebec, which prompted use of the term &quot;&quot;, or &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot;. In English Canada, Lévesque was seen as having tried to do the same to the English-speaking premiers by accepting the referendum. Among those was Brian Mulroney, who said that by &quot;accepting Mr. Trudeau&#x27;s referendum idea, Mr. Levesque [sic] himself abandoned, without notice, his colleagues of the common front.&quot; Chrétien&#x27;s role in the negotiations made him reviled among sovereigntists. Until the Quebec Liberals came to power in 1985, every law passed in Quebec used the notwithstanding clause.

Further, Peckford rebuked in an article in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; claims the events that night resembled anything akin to the Kitchen Accord or Night of the Long Knives. According to Peckford, four premiers—from Newfoundland, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia—and senior representatives from Alberta and British Columbia, worked from a proposal brought to the meeting by the Newfoundland delegation. Efforts were made to reach the other provinces, including Quebec, but to no avail. Peckford further asserted that Chrétien was not contacted and he had no knowledge of the &quot;so-called kitchen meetings&quot;. The proposal agreed upon that night was essentially the same as the Newfoundland delegation&#x27;s, except for minor alterations to wording and the addition of a new section, and the final draft was to go to all the provinces for approval the following morning.

Peckford&#x27;s assertions have, in turn, been challenged by Howard Leeson, who was then the Saskatchewan Deputy Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs and present during all of the negotiations that night. He claimed that, while the officials did work from Newfoundland&#x27;s draft, it was only because it was largely similar to the Kitchen Accord, which had already been developed and agreed to by the governments of Ontario and Saskatchewan and was known to the federal government. Further, Peckford played only a minor role that evening, entering later, with the majority of the negotiating being done by Blakeney and Davis. Leeson concluded that Davis and Lougheed were the most important players in securing an agreement. In his opinion, the presence in the National Archives of Canada of the Kitchen Accord leaves no doubt about its existence and it was one of several crucial linkages in the patriation negotiations.

===Legal closure===
With the agreement of the majority of provincial governments, the federal government moved to implement the patriation package. Joint resolutions of the Canadian House of Commons and the Senate requested that the Queen cause to be introduced in the British Parliament the necessary legislation to patriate the constitution. The resolution contained the text of what was to become the &quot;Canada Act, 1982&quot;, which included the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;. Though certain British parliamentarians continued to oppose the bill based on concerns about the rights of Canada&#x27;s Indigenous peoples, the Parliament at Westminster passed the &quot;Canada Act, 1982&quot;, and Queen Elizabeth II, as Queen of the United Kingdom, granted royal assent on March 29, 1982, 115 years to the day when Queen Victoria gave assent to the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;. The &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, included an amending formula involving only the federal House of Commons and Senate and provincial legislative assemblies. Section 2 of the &quot;Canada Act&quot; states that no subsequent UK law &quot;shall extend to Canada as part of its law&quot;, while item 17 of its schedule also amends the &quot;Statute of Westminster&quot; by removing the &quot;request and consent&quot; provision. Elizabeth II then, as Queen of Canada, proclaimed the patriated constitution in Ottawa on April 17, 1982.
Canada had established the final step in complete sovereignty as an independent country, with the Queen&#x27;s role as monarch of Canada separate from her role as the British monarch or the monarch of any of the other Commonwealth realms.

Paul Martin Sr, who was in 1981 sent, along with John Roberts and Mark MacGuigan, to the UK to discuss the patriation project, noted that, during that time, the Queen had taken a great interest in the constitutional debate and the three found the monarch &quot;better informed on both the substance and politics of Canada&#x27;s constitutional case than any of the British politicians or bureaucrats.&quot; Trudeau commented in his memoirs: &quot;I always said it was thanks to three women that we were eventually able to reform our Constitution[, including] The Queen, who was favourable... I was always impressed not only by the grace she displayed in public at all times, but by the wisdom she showed in private conversation.&quot;

Being aware that this was the first time in Canadian history that a major constitutional change had been made without the Quebec government&#x27;s agreement and Quebec&#x27;s exclusion from the patriation agreement had caused a rift, the Queen privately conveyed to journalists her regret that the province was not part of the settlement. Quebec sovereigntists have, since 1982, demanded that the Queen or another member of the Canadian Royal Family apologize for the enactment of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, calling the event a part of a &quot;cultural genocide of francophones in North America over the last 400 years&quot;. In 2002, Premier of Quebec Bernard Landry directed the executive council and lieutenant governor not to recognise Elizabeth&#x27;s golden jubilee in protest of the Queen having signed the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;.

==Legal questions==
As constitutional scholar Robin White has noted, some might think that, since the &quot;Canada Act, 1982&quot;, is British as well as Canadian law, the United Kingdom could theoretically repeal it and declare its laws to be binding in Canada. Peter Hogg, however, disputes this view, noting that since Canada is now sovereign, the Supreme Court of Canada would find a British law which purported to be binding in Canada just as invalid in Canada &quot;as a law enacted for Canada by Portugal.&quot; Paul Romney argued in 1999 that, regardless of what the British authorities did, the constitutional principle of responsible government in Canada denied them the right to ever again legislate for Canada; he stated: &quot;[T]he constitutional convention known as responsible government entailed legal as well as political sovereignty. Responsible government meant that the Queen of Canada could constitutionally act for Canada only on the advice of her Canadian ministers. If the British Parliament were to legislate for Canada, except at the request of the competent Canadian authorities, and the Queen assented to that legislation on the advice of her British ministers, Canadian courts would refuse to enforce that legislation.&quot;

<text>Joanna Marie Valentina &quot;Zizi&quot; Lambrino (3 October 1898 – 11 March 1953) was the first wife of the later King Carol II of Romania. They had one son, Carol, born in 1920, in Bucharest.

==Life==
Lambrino was born in Roman, Kingdom of Romania in 1898 to a Phanariot Greek family of former noble Byzantine origins, the Rangabe-Lambrino family. She was the daughter of Romanian Colonel, later General, Constantin Lambrino (d. 1916) and his wife, Euphrosine Alcaz (1875–1930). Joanna Lambrino met the Crown Prince Carol, a Hohenzollern who was the son of King Ferdinand of Romania and Queen Marie of Romania, in Iaşi in the Kingdom of Romania in 1918, during the First World War. The Romanian royal court had adjourned from Bucharest to Iaşi, to keep its distance from a German invasion. Journalist A.L. Easterman would later write that &quot;Carol fell violently in love and was at no pains to dissemble it&quot;, despite the obvious disapproval of the royal court for his bestowing his affections on a commoner. Even so, there are several photographs of Zizi Lambrino and Prince Carol at the royal family residences and together with other members of the Romanian royal family. Lulu, Zizi&#x27;s brother, was one of Carol&#x27;s best friends and they corresponded with each other throughout their lives.

Some say their union was opposed by his parents, but Carol &quot;smuggled&quot; her across the former Russian frontier and they were officially married in the Orthodox Cathedral of Odesa, Ukraine, on 31 August 1918, in the presence of witnesses. Carol&#x27;s parents were furious. The king ordered him to be kept in close confinement in Bistrița Monastery for seventy-five days. Prime Minister Ion I. C. Brătianu practically accused Carol of treason. Prince Carol threatened to renounce his right of royal succession and, indeed, when in August 1919 the Romanian Supreme Court ruled the marriage unconstitutional, unlawful and annulled it, Carol signed documents of renunciation. However, as Easterman describes it, &quot;intriguers... cunningly... [threw] other young and attractive women in his view and society&quot; and eventually &quot;corroded his relations with his wife...&quot;

Carol and Zizi Lambrino had one son, Mircea Gregor Carol Lambrino (8 August 1920 – 27 January 2006). Carol and the Romanian government continued to pay Lambrino&#x27;s maintenance and that of her son in their French exile.

Zizi Lambrino died in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris, France, on 11 March 1953. Her former husband, the now ex-King Carol II, died in exile in Estoril, Portugal, shortly after on 4 April 1953.

==Archives==
Zizi Lambrino&#x27;s personal papers (including diaries, correspondence and photographs related to her marriage to Carol II of Romania) are preserved in the &quot;Jeanne Marie Valentine Lambrino Papers&quot; collection in the Hoover Institution Archives (Stanford, California, US).

==Descendants==

Her son, Mircea Gregor Carol Lambrino, was named in memory of Prince Mircea of Romania (1913–1916), Carol&#x27;s youngest brother, who had died four years previous to the former&#x27;s birth, but he would later be known as &quot;Carol&quot; rather than &quot;Mircea.&quot; Mircea/Carol married three times, firstly (1944–1950) to Opera singer Hélène Nagavitzine (aka. Léna Pastor); they had one son, Paul-Philippe Hohenzollern. He next married Jeanne Williams (1960–1977); they had one son, Ion Nicolas George Alexander Hohenzollern (born 1961 in Dorset, England). He married his third wife, Antonia Colville, in 1984 and they remained married until he died in 2006.

In response to a suit by her grandson Paul, a Romanian Court determined in 1996 that her marriage was legal. This places a shadow over the status of Carol II&#x27;s son, the &quot;de facto&quot; King of Romania Michael, because if Carol&#x27;s marriage to Zizi Lambrino was never properly ended, that could invalidate his later royal marriage to Helen of Greece and Denmark, Michael&#x27;s mother.

ChivalricOrders.org sees this shadow as very slight: &quot;The legality of the annulment of the marriage was not only unchallenged at the time, but significantly, after eventually becoming King, Carol II did not attempt to undo this act nor declare his son Mircea legitimate. Neither did he ever name Mircea as his heir...&quot;; further, &quot;the annulment&quot; although contested by Carol at the time was &quot;... eventually acknowledged by Carol II himself who remarried twice.&quot;

<text>David Américo Ortiz Arias (born November 18, 1975), nicknamed &quot;Big Papi&quot;, is a Dominican-American former professional baseball designated hitter and first baseman who played 20 seasons in Major League Baseball from 1997 to 2016, primarily for the Boston Red Sox. After playing parts of six seasons with the Minnesota Twins with unremarkable results, Ortiz moved to the Red Sox, where he played a leading role in ending the team&#x27;s 86-year World Series championship drought in 2004, as well as winning championships in 2007 and 2013; he was named the World Series Most Valuable Player in 2013. In his first five seasons with the club, he averaged 41 home runs and 128 runs batted in (RBIs), leading the American League (AL) twice in the latter category and setting the team&#x27;s single-season record of 54 home runs in 2006; he finished in the top five of the AL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player voting all five years.

Used almost exclusively as a DH during his 14 seasons with the Red Sox, he was a ten-time All-Star and a seven-time Silver Slugger winner, and became regarded as one of the greatest designated hitters of all time. He received the Edgar Martínez Award as the league&#x27;s top DH eight times, and set major league records for career home runs (485), RBIs (1,569) and hits (2,192) as a DH. He posted ten seasons each with 30 home runs and 100 RBIs, and batted .300 or better seven times. After a drop in his offensive numbers from 2008 to 2012, he enjoyed a strong resurgence in his last four seasons, and had one of his best years in his final campaign, leading the AL in doubles, RBIs, and slugging percentage, once again leading the team to the postseason.

Upon his retirement, Ortiz ranked sixth in AL history with 541 home runs, fifth in doubles (632) and ninth in RBIs (1,768). Regarded as one of the greatest clutch hitters of all time, he had 11 career walk-off home runs during the regular season and two during the 2004 postseason, the first of which clinched the AL Division Series. In 2022, Ortiz was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.

==Early life==
Ortiz was born on November 18, 1975, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, as the oldest of four children of Enrique (Leo) Ortiz and Ángela Rosa Arias. As a boy, he followed the careers of standout pitcher Ramón Martinez and his younger brother Pedro, attending games whenever he could and building a friendship with Pedro that would only grow over the years. Ortiz graduated from Estudia Espaillat High School in the Dominican Republic, and was a standout baseball and basketball player there.

==Professional career==
On November 28, 1992, Ortiz was signed by the Seattle Mariners just 10 days after his 17th birthday, who listed him as &quot;David Arias&quot; due to not being familiar with Spanish naming customs. He made his professional debut in 1994 for the Mariners of the Arizona League, batting .246 with two home runs and 20 RBI. By 1995, he had improved those numbers to .332 with four home runs and 37 RBI. In 1996, he was promoted to the Single-A Wisconsin Timber Rattlers of the Midwest League, a Mariners farm team. He established himself as one of the Mariners&#x27; best hitting prospects, batting .322 with 18 home runs and 93 RBI. Ortiz also impressed both fans and Mariners&#x27; players like Alex Rodriguez with a strong performance in an impromptu home run derby—the result of a failed Mariners&#x27; promotion in which the Timber Rattlers were supposed to play an exhibition game against the MLB club in front of their home fans in Wisconsin, but the game was rained out. Also in Wisconsin, Ortiz met his future wife Tiffany; she led him to become a fan of the nearby Green Bay Packers NFL team, a devotion that would become lifelong. Baseball America named Ortiz the most exciting player in the Midwest League, as well as its best defensive first baseman for 1996.

Despite his strong year in the Mariners&#x27; system, on September 13, 1996, Ortiz was traded to the Minnesota Twins as the player to be named later to complete an earlier transaction for Dave Hollins. When he arrived in Minnesota, he informed the team that he preferred to be listed as &quot;David Ortiz&quot;—using his paternal family name rather than &quot;Arias&quot; which was his maternal family name. Referring to the switch, sportswriter Jay Jaffe called Arias/Ortiz &quot;literally the player to be named later.&quot;

Ortiz rose quickly through the Twins system in 1997. Though he started with the High-A Fort Myers Miracle, he quickly progressed through Double-A (New Britain Rock Cats), to the Triple-A Salt Lake Buzz. At the three levels, Ortiz combined to hit .317 with 31 home runs and 124 RBI, earning a September call-up to the Twins&#x27; MLB club.

===Minnesota Twins (1997–2002)===

====1997====
Ortiz made his MLB debut for the Twins on September 2, 1997. He played in 15 games in September, batting .327 in 49 at bats. He recorded his first major league hit in his second game, on September 3, with an eighth-inning pinch-hit double against the Chicago Cubs. He hit his first major league home run on September 14 against the Texas Rangers, off pitcher Julio Santana, going 3-for-4 with two walks in the game overall. Ortiz hit one home run and had 6 RBI in his first season.

====1998====
In 1998, Ortiz entered the season with his sights set on playing as the regular first baseman for the Twins. However, Ortiz&#x27;s playing style was somewhat different from the approach favored by manager Tom Kelly, which placed a premium on avoiding strikeouts, and great defense (which Kelly felt Ortiz still needed to work on). While Kelly worked with Ortiz on his defense, he hit well, batting .306 through May 9 before fracturing his wrist and going on the disabled list. He returned to the Twins in July following a rehab assignment to Triple-A and finished the season with the team. He ended his rookie year strong, batting .360 in September. All told, he hit .277 with nine home runs and 46 RBI in 86 games.

====1999====
In 1999, Ortiz figured to be a fixture in the lineup, but after a tough spring training which saw him bat only .137, he was sent down to the Triple-A Salt Lake Buzz as the sure-handed rookie Doug Mientkiewicz earned the first base job. It was becoming apparent that manager Tom Kelly preferred veteran players or those who fit into his small-ball and good defense philosophy, something Ortiz would later be vocal about after his days with the Twins. While Ortiz tore through minor league pitching to the tune of a .315 average with 30 home runs and 110 RBI, Twins first basemen would go on to hit just .245 with 11 homers and 69 RBI all season. Twins designated hitters did not fare much better, batting a combined .259 with 14 home runs and 82 RBI. Ortiz&#x27;s strong season in Triple-A was too much for Kelly to ignore, and Ortiz again earned a September call-up in 1999. It did not go well for Ortiz, as he struck out 12 times in 20 at-bats, and did not register a hit.

====2000====
By 2000, with the Twins coming off three consecutive seasons of over 90 losses, Ortiz&#x27;s bat could not be buried in the minor leagues much longer. After playing only sparingly during the season&#x27;s first two months, by June 2000 he finally established himself as an MLB regular. However, Ortiz played primarily at designated hitter as manager Kelly stuck with the veteran Ron Coomer at first base. When Ortiz homered on June 9 against the Milwaukee Brewers, it was his first MLB home run in more than a year. On September 7, he hit his first major league grand slam at Fenway Park against Boston Red Sox pitcher Ramón Martínez, one of his childhood heroes from the Dominican Republic. As his playing time increased, his stats improved. Despite his slow start, he finished at .282 with 10 home runs and 63 RBI. His 36 doubles were second on the team to Matt Lawton&#x27;s 44, despite Ortiz having almost 200 fewer plate appearances. Ortiz&#x27;s .364 on-base percentage was fourth on the team among players with more than 100 plate appearances.

====2001====
Ortiz began the 2001 season as the regular DH and started the year strong, batting .311 with six home runs and 18 RBI through May 4. For the first time in years, the Twins were a contender thanks to a hot start helped by Ortiz&#x27;s hitting. However, another wrist fracture landed Ortiz back on the disabled list, and he did not return until July. It was apparent the injury affected his production, as he batted just .202 upon his return. He finished the year with a disappointing .234 average, however, the 11 home runs he hit over the season&#x27;s final two months (including his first multihomer game on September 5 against the Texas Rangers) offered a glimmer of hope for the future. Despite their hot start, the Twins ultimately did not qualify for the postseason but did win a very respectable 85 games. It was the franchise&#x27;s first winning season since 1992. At the end of the season, longtime Twins manager Tom Kelly retired, and Ron Gardenhire took over the reins.

====2002====
The offseason proved very difficult for Ortiz, as on New Year&#x27;s Day 2002, his mother died following a car accident. Gardenhire reached out and helped Ortiz deal with the death, and Ortiz prepared hard for the coming baseball season, both saddened his mother never saw him play at his best and determined to reach new heights. When the season began, Ortiz battled knee injuries. It was a tale of two seasons for Ortiz, as his .240 average with five homers and 33 RBI before the All-Star break was disappointing. But after the All-Star break, Ortiz quietly turned in one of the better second halves in baseball, batting .297 with 15 home runs and 42 RBI. On August 16, he hit a memorable home run off his friend Pedro Martínez at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, hitting an inside cut fastball into the upper deck. On September 25, he hit the first walk-off home run of his career, against the Cleveland Indians. He finished the 2002 season batting .272 with 20 home runs and 75 RBI. At this point in his career, the home run and RBI totals were both career bests. However, as he batted only .203 against left-handed pitching, Ortiz still was not always guaranteed to start if a tough lefty would be on the mound. His career year coincided with the Twins qualifying for the postseason, as the team won 94 games and upset the Oakland Athletics in the Division Series before falling in the 2002 American League Championship Series to the eventual World Series winning Anaheim Angels. Ortiz batted .276 in his first postseason, with 4 RBI. His 9th inning double in the decisive Game 5 of the Division Series put the Twins ahead 5–1 in a game they would hold on to win 5–4. The series-winning RBI was the first of what would be many clutch postseason hits in Ortiz&#x27;s career.

After the season, the small market Twins faced a decision on Ortiz, who had made $950,000 and would likely have been granted around $2 million for 2003 by an arbitrator. Rather than negotiate a contract, or go to arbitration, the Twins instead decided to release Ortiz as a cost-cutting move on December 16, after being unable to swing a trade for him. In parts of six seasons totaling 455 games with the Twins, Ortiz hit 58 home runs and had 238 RBI. The player who replaced Ortiz on the Twins&#x27; roster, Jose Morban, would never play in a game for the team.

===Boston Red Sox (2003–2016)===

====2003====
After his release from the Twins, Ortiz had a chance encounter with Pedro Martínez at a restaurant in the Dominican Republic, and Martinez remembered the home run he had given up to Ortiz in August 2002. Excited at the prospect of his friend joining him on the Boston Red Sox (who needed a first baseman), Pedro began calling several Red Sox team officials to request that the team sign Ortiz. On January 22, Ortiz signed a non-guaranteed free agent contract with the Red Sox that would be worth $1.25 million if he made the team. New Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein envisioned Ortiz as one of several candidates to fill a void at first base. Sabermetrics favorite Jeremy Giambi was widely expected to get most of the playing time, but also in the mix were primary third baseman Bill Mueller (who figured to DH at times), Shea Hillenbrand (who could play third base, first base, or DH), and Kevin Millar (who could play first base or outfield). The team&#x27;s best hitter, outfielder Manny Ramirez, figured to DH at times also. When the season started, all of them made the team, including Ortiz, with the new designated hitter/first baseman taking player number 34 in honor of his mentor and friend on the Twins, Kirby Puckett.

Because of the logjam, Ortiz did not play steadily during the first two months of the season. He hit his first home run with his new team on April 27 at Anaheim, a go-ahead shot to break a 14th-inning tie in an eventual 6–4 win, but batted only .212 in April. By May, he had raised his average to .272. Ortiz became frustrated over his limited playing time, seeing a similarity to what had happened to him in Minnesota, especially considering that Giambi was only batting .125 on May 1. After expressing his frustration to the media, Pedro Martínez pulled his friend aside to defuse the situation, then asked manager Grady Little to ensure Ortiz always be in the lineup when he was pitching. As Ortiz&#x27;s bat heated up in May, the Red Sox finally broke the logjam when they traded Hillenbrand to the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 29. On June 1, manager Grady Little benched Giambi, who was still hitting only .185. These two moves allowed Ortiz to become the everyday designated hitter. As a regular, Ortiz finally had the breakout year he had envisioned. After hitting .299 with 10 home runs in the season&#x27;s first half, he turned on the power in the second half, hitting 21 home runs in 63 games. On July 26, he delivered a walk-off hit against the rival New York Yankees. He would add his first walk-off homer as a member of the Red Sox on September 23, against the Baltimore Orioles. He finished the season with 31 home runs, 101 RBI and a .288 average, finishing fifth in the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award voting as the Red Sox won the AL Wild Card and qualified for the postseason.

In the 2003 postseason, Ortiz struggled in the ALDS against the Oakland A&#x27;s until Game 4, when he hit a two-run double in the bottom of the eighth inning off closer Keith Foulke to turn a 4–3 deficit into a 5–4 Red Sox lead and eventual victory. In Game 1 of the AL Championship Series against the rival New York Yankees, Ortiz hit his first career postseason home run. He finished with two home runs and 6 RBI in the ALCS, including a solo home run in the eighth inning of the decisive Game 7 that gave the Red Sox a 5–2 lead at the time. However, the Red Sox would go on to blow the lead in the bottom of the inning, and Boston lost the series in heartbreaking fashion on Aaron Boone&#x27;s infamous extra-inning walk-off home run that instead sent the Yankees to the 2003 World Series.

====2004====
In the offseason, Ortiz was eligible for salary arbitration once again, but the Red Sox agreed with him on a $4.6 million salary for the 2004 season, avoiding hearings. Prior to the agreement, Ortiz and his agent had submitted a figure of $5 million, while the Red Sox had countered with $4.2 million, so the agreement split the difference.

Once the 2004 season started, Ortiz wasted no time picking up right where he left off with the bat. On May 28, Ortiz hit his 100th career home run, a grand slam, off Joel Piñeiro of the Seattle Mariners at Fenway Park. Also in May, Ortiz signed a two-year contract extension with the Red Sox worth $12.5 million. He batted .304 with 23 home runs and 78 RBI in the season&#x27;s first half, was named an All-Star for the first time in his career, and hit a long home run in the All-Star Game off Carl Pavano. Ortiz was suspended for three games in July, after being ejected following an incident in a July 16 game against the Angels in which he threw several bats onto the field that came close to hitting umpires Bill Hohn and Mark Carlson. Ortiz finished the 2004 season with 41 home runs and 139 RBI while batting .301 with an on-base plus slugging (OPS) of .983. He finished second in the AL in both home runs and RBIs and finished fourth in AL MVP voting. He also earned his first Silver Slugger award for his outstanding performance at designated hitter. In addition, Ortiz and teammate Manny Ramirez became the first pair of AL teammates to hit 40 home runs, have 100 RBIs, and bat .300 since the Yankees&#x27; Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in 1931. Together they hit back-to-back home runs six times, tying the major league single-season mark set by the Detroit Tigers&#x27; Hank Greenberg and Rudy York and later matched by the Chicago White Sox&#x27;s Frank Thomas and Magglio Ordóñez. The duo quickly became arguably the best hitting tandem of the decade.

In the 2004 postseason, Ortiz elevated his play to a new level. He had multiple game-winning hits to help Boston advance through the rounds. In the 2004 AL Division Series, he hit a series-winning walk-off home run off Jarrod Washburn in the 10th inning of Game 3 to knock out the Anaheim Angels. In the AL Championship Series against the New York Yankees, the Red Sox quickly fell behind 0 games to 3, a deficit that had never been surmounted in baseball history. Ortiz almost single-handedly paved the way for history, as he hit a walk-off two-run home run against Paul Quantrill in the 12th inning of Game 4 and a walk-off single off Esteban Loaiza in the 14th inning of Game 5. His heroics - namely batting .387 with three home runs and 11 RBI in the series - earned him AL Championship Series MVP honors, the first time a DH had ever won that award, as the Red Sox came back to win in seven games. In the 2004 World Series vs. the St. Louis Cardinals, Ortiz set the tone for the four-game sweep as he hit a three-run home run off Woody Williams in the first inning of Game 1 at Fenway Park. He hit .308 in the series with a home run and 4 RBI as the Red Sox swept the Cardinals to end the Curse of the Bambino by winning their first World Series Championship in 86 years. Overall, Ortiz batted .400 in the 2004 postseason with five home runs and 23 RBI.

====2005====

In 2005, Ortiz set new career highs with 47 home runs and 148 RBI. He batted .300 with an OPS of 1.001. On June 2, his three-run homer turned a 4–3 deficit into a 6–4 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. On September 6, his 38th home run of the year beat the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. On September 29, his eighth-inning home run against the Toronto Blue Jays tied the game at 4, then his ninth-inning single in his very next at-bat gave Boston the win. For all of his late-inning heroics, Red Sox ownership would present Ortiz with a plaque proclaiming him &quot;the greatest clutch-hitter in the history of the Boston Red Sox.&quot; He led the AL in RBI, while finishing second in home runs and third in OPS. Ortiz finished second in the AL MVP voting to Alex Rodriguez while leading the Red Sox to their third consecutive playoff appearance, where they lost in the first round to the eventual champion Chicago White Sox. For the second consecutive season, Ortiz was named an All-Star and won the Silver Slugger Award. He also won his first Hank Aaron Award as the outstanding hitter in the AL.

====2006====

On April 10, the Red Sox announced Ortiz signed a four-year, $52 million contract extension with the team. The contract also included a team option for a fifth year. Over the two months of June and July, he had five walk-off hits, three of which were home runs. Ortiz hit his 200th career home run on June 29, against Duaner Sánchez of the New York Mets at Fenway Park. He posted his best month of the season in July, batting .339 with 14 home runs. On September 20 at Fenway Park, Ortiz tied Jimmie Foxx&#x27;s single season Red Sox home run record of 50 set in 1938, in the sixth inning against Minnesota Twins&#x27; Boof Bonser. On September 21, Ortiz broke the record by hitting his 51st home run off Johan Santana of the Twins. The home run was also his 44th of the season as a designated hitter, breaking his own AL single-season record. Ortiz finished 2006 with a career-high 54 home runs to set a new Red Sox record and had 137 RBIs while batting .287 with an OPS of 1.049. He led the AL in both home runs and RBIs and finished third in OPS. He finished third in the AL MVP voting behind Justin Morneau and Derek Jeter. Despite his outstanding campaign, however, the Red Sox did not qualify for the postseason.

====2007====
In 2007, Ortiz was instrumental in leading the Red Sox to their seventh World Series title. In the regular season, he had 35 home runs and 117 RBI while batting a career-best .332, placing him in the top 10 in the AL in all three categories. In addition, he hit 52 doubles, led the AL in extra-base hits and finished second in OPS at 1.066. His .445 on-base percentage led the league. An All-Star for the fourth consecutive season, Ortiz finished fourth in the AL MVP voting and captured the Silver Slugger at DH once again, as the Red Sox won the AL East.

In the postseason, Ortiz again kept up the clutch hitting. He batted .714 (5-for-7) against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the Division Series, with two home runs. Then, after batting .292 with a home run against the Cleveland Indians in the AL Championship Series, he hit .333 in the 2007 World Series, with 4 RBI. Combined, Ortiz batted .370 with three home runs and 10 RBI and Boston swept the Colorado Rockies to win their second World Series Championship in four years.

====2008====
In 2008, Ortiz started slowly after suffering a wrist injury which caused him to miss several weeks. He played in a total of 109 games and finished the season with 23 home runs and 89 RBI while batting .264. Despite his struggles, Ortiz was named to his fifth All-Star team. In the playoffs, Ortiz batted just .186 over two rounds as the Red Sox ultimately fell to the Tampa Bay Rays in the AL Championship Series.

====2009====

Ortiz struggled early in the 2009 season, hitting only .206 with no home runs and 30 strikeouts in his first 34 games. He did not hit his first home run of the season until May 20 off Brett Cecil of the Toronto Blue Jays, ending a career-high 150 homerless at-bat streak.
In June, Ortiz broke out of his slump by hitting seven home runs with 22 RBI. He hit seven home runs in both July and August, including the 300th of his career against Luke Hochevar of the Kansas City Royals at Fenway Park on July 9. On September 17, Ortiz hit his 270th career home run as a DH off José Arredondo of the Los Angeles Angels, breaking the all-time record held by Frank Thomas. However, Ortiz finished the season with just a .238 average to go along with his 28 home runs and 99 RBI. He also struggled in the postseason, with just one hit in 12 at-bats. During 2009, Ortiz did, however, play first base for the first time since the 2007 season.

====2010====

In 2010, Ortiz again got off to a slow start, and questions loomed large about his future. Ortiz batted just .143 in April, with a home run and 4 RBI. But Ortiz returned to his All-Star form beginning with a hot May and finished at .270 with 32 home runs and 102 RBI for the year. His home run and RBI totals were both in the top 10 in the AL. At the All-Star Game, Ortiz won the Home Run Derby contest, defeating Florida Marlins shortstop Hanley Ramírez in the final. A strong September where Ortiz drove in 23 runs pushed him over the 100-RBI mark for the first time in three seasons. But despite Ortiz&#x27;s resurgence, the Red Sox finished third in the AL East and failed to qualify for the postseason. At the end of the season, the Red Sox announced that they would pick up the $12.5 million team option on his contract for 2011, though Ortiz had hoped for a multi-year extension instead.

====2011====
In 2011, Ortiz continued to produce, batting .309 with 29 home runs and 96 RBI. He passed several milestones during the year. On April 2, he set the record for RBI by a designated hitter with 1,004, surpassing Edgar Martínez. Then, on May 21, Ortiz became only the fifth player to hit 300 home runs as a member of the Red Sox, joining Ted Williams, Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice, and Dwight Evans. On July 15, Ortiz was suspended for four games for his part in a brawl that took place on July 8 in a game against the Baltimore Orioles. Ortiz charged Orioles pitcher Kevin Gregg after a brushback pitch and an exchange of words, triggering a bench-clearing brawl. In 2011, Ortiz made his seventh All-Star Team. He also earned his fifth Silver Slugger Award at the end of the year, and, on October 20, Major League Baseball announced that Ortiz was the winner of the Roberto Clemente Award. However, the Red Sox again failed to qualify for the postseason. Also at season&#x27;s end, as Ortiz and the Red Sox could not agree on a contract extension during the year, Ortiz headed for free agency for the first time since being released by the Twins in 2003. However, on December 7, he accepted the Red Sox offer of salary arbitration, and the two sides again avoided hearings by agreeing to a $14.575 million figure for the 2012 season.

====2012====
2012 began like Ortiz had his sights set on MVP contention again, as he hit .405 over the season&#x27;s first month, with six home runs and 20 RBI. On July 4, at O.co Coliseum in Oakland, Ortiz hit his 400th career home run off A. J. Griffin of the Oakland Athletics. However, on July 16, Ortiz suffered an injury to his right Achilles tendon and was placed on the DL on July 19. He returned on August 24 but returned to the DL on August 27 after playing just one game. He finished the season with 23 home runs and 60 RBI while batting .318 in 90 games. On the date of his injury, the Red Sox were 46–44. However, without Ortiz, the Red Sox cratered, going 23–49 over the last two and a half months of the season to finish last in the AL East.

With free agency again looming, Ortiz and the Red Sox agreed to terms on a two-year contract with $26 million, with incentives that could push the total value of the deal to $30 million. The deal was made official on November 5.

====2013====
Ortiz rebounded from his injury to post a strong 2013 campaign as he once again guided the Red Sox to a first-place finish in the AL East. During the regular season, he hit 30 home runs, had 103 RBI and batted .309. He finished in the top 10 in all the categories in the AL. On April 20, before the first game played at Fenway Park since the Boston Marathon bombing and his first since August 2012 after an Achilles tendon injury, Ortiz spoke emotionally to the crowd and stated, &quot;This is our fucking city, and no one is going to dictate our freedom. Stay strong.&quot; Ortiz reached several career milestones in 2013, including his 500th career double on July 2 and his 2,000th career hit on September 4. On July 10, Ortiz passed Harold Baines to become the all-time leader for hits by a DH with 1,689.

On July 27, Ortiz was ejected by home-plate umpire Tim Timmons for arguing balls and strikes in a game against the Baltimore Orioles. After his ejection, Ortiz used his bat to smash a pressbox phone in the dugout. Major League Baseball decided not to suspend Ortiz for the incident.

In the postseason, Ortiz hit five home runs and 13 RBI while batting .353 to lead the Red Sox to a World Series championship, the franchise&#x27;s eighth. In Game 2 of the AL Division Series against the Tampa Bay Rays, he hit two home runs off Rays&#x27; ace pitcher David Price. In Game 2 of the AL Championship Series versus the Detroit Tigers, Ortiz hit a dramatic, game-tying grand slam off reliever Joaquín Benoit in the bottom of the eighth inning, helping propel the Red Sox to victory. In the World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, Ortiz hit home runs in both Games 1 and 2, had six RBIs and batted .688 as the Red Sox won the series 4–2. He tied a Series record by reaching base nine times in a row, and the opposing Cardinals seemed to stop trying to get him out, with many intentional walks. Ortiz won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.

Ortiz gained several new nicknames from the media and his teammates as a result of his great postseason play such as &quot;Señor Octubre&quot; and &quot;Cooperstown.&quot; He finished third in Boston&#x27;s mayoral race that year with 560 write-in votes. He also finished 10th in AL MVP voting, the first season he garnered votes since 2007.

====2014====

On March 23, 2014, Ortiz signed a one-year, $16 million contract extension for the 2015 season. The extension also included two team option years to potentially keep him under contract with the Red Sox through the 2017 season. Once the season started, Ortiz continued to hit well, homering 35 times to go along with 104 RBI and a .263 average. He again placed in the top 10 in the AL in both home runs and RBI. During a game against the Tampa Bay Rays on May 31, Ortiz was hit by a pitch from David Price, leading to both benches being warned. Price later hit Mike Carp which led to both benches clearing and an enraged Ortiz shouting at Price. On June 29 at Yankee Stadium, Ortiz homered off New York Yankees pitcher Chase Whitley for his 450th career home run.

In a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; article, Red Sox great Carl Yastrzemski called David Ortiz the second greatest hitter in club history, stating &quot;I would say as a hitter, I would say he&#x27;s next to Ted [Williams].&quot;&quot;&quot;

====2015====
In 2015, Ortiz hit 37 home runs and had 108 RBI while batting .273. He finished in the top 10 in the AL in both home runs and RBIs for the eighth time in his career.

On April 19, in a game at Fenway Park vs. the Baltimore Orioles, Ortiz was ejected for arguing a check swing call. While arguing, Ortiz bumped into umpire John Tumpane. Two days later, MLB suspended Ortiz one game and fined him an undisclosed amount.

On July 14, in an announcement prior to the MLB All-Star Game at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, Ortiz was selected as one of the &quot;Franchise Four&quot; of the Boston Red Sox. The selection of the &quot;Franchise Four&quot; (the greatest four players of all time for every MLB team) was determined by online voting by fans on the MLB.com website. Along with Ortiz, Ted Williams, Carl Yastrzemski and Ortiz&#x27;s friend Pedro Martínez were selected as the four greatest players in Boston Red Sox history.

On September 5 at Fenway Park, Ortiz hit his 30th home run of the season off Jerome Williams of the Philadelphia Phillies. This marked the ninth time that Ortiz hit 30 or more home runs in a season, the most in Red Sox history. On September 12, in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field, Ortiz hit his 500th career home run off Rays pitcher Matt Moore. He became only the 27th player in MLB history to reach that milestone.

====2016====
On November 18, 2015, his 40th birthday, Ortiz announced on the website &quot;The Players&#x27; Tribune&quot; that he would retire following the 2016 season.

In the final season of his career, Ortiz hit 38 home runs—the most ever hit by a player in his final season—and had 127 RBI while batting .315. He finished in the top 10 in the AL in home runs and RBI for the ninth time in his career. He finished tied for first in the AL in RBI with Edwin Encarnación. Ortiz led the AL and MLB with a 1.021 OPS, .620 slugging percentage, 87 extra base hits and 48 doubles. He had the highest percentage of hard-hit batted balls in the majors (45.9%). He also had the highest ISO (Isolated Power) of all MLB players in 2016, at .305.

Throughout the season, opposing teams honored Ortiz by presenting him with gifts, some humorous, when the Red Sox visited, similar to how teams had done when other stars like Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera were in their final season. For example, the New York Yankees presented Ortiz with a painting of him at home plate in Yankee Stadium, as well as a book of notes to Ortiz written by several former and current Yankees. When it was their turn, the Baltimore Orioles presented Ortiz with the mangled dugout phone he had destroyed with a bat from his 2013 outburst.

On May 14, at Fenway Park, Ortiz hit a walk-off double to lead the Red Sox to a 6–5 victory over the Houston Astros; it was his 20th career walk-off hit. The double was the 600th of Ortiz&#x27; career, making him the 15th player all time to reach the milestone. He also joined Hank Aaron and Barry Bonds as only the third player in MLB history with at least 500 career home runs and 600 career doubles.
On August 24, in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field, Ortiz hit his 30th home run of the season. He became the oldest MLB player to ever do so. In the same game, he also reached 100 RBI for the season. It was the tenth time in his career he reached both milestones, a Red Sox record. He hit his 625th career double two days later against the Royals, passing Hank Aaron for tenth place all-time.

On October 2, during a pregame ceremony at Fenway Park for Ortiz prior to the final game of the season, the Red Sox announced that his uniform number 34 would be retired during the 2017 season. Additionally, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker was on hand to announce the bridge that carries Brookline Avenue over the Massachusetts Turnpike would be dedicated in honor of Ortiz.

Ortiz&#x27;s strong play in his final season was enough to get the Red Sox into the postseason, but a first-round sweep at the hands of the Cleveland Indians in the AL Division Series ended the Red Sox season on October 10. Following the loss at Fenway Park, Ortiz came out and saluted the Boston fans in a tearful goodbye before leaving the field.

On October 26, Major League Baseball announced that Ortiz had won his second Hank Aaron Award as the outstanding offensive player in the AL. He was the 2016 Esurance MLB/This Year in Baseball Award winner for Best Hitter, his third time. In addition, Ortiz also placed sixth in voting for 2016 AL MVP.

==Career statistics==

Sources:

Ortiz was productive in the postseason. In 85 postseason games including 3 World Series (2004,&#x27;07,&#x27;13) he batted .289 (88-for-304) with 22 doubles, 2 triples, 17 home runs, 61 RBI, 59 walks, .404 on-base percentage, .543 slugging percentage, and .947 on-base plus slugging percentage.

==Analyst career==

In October 2017 Ortiz joined &quot;MLB on Fox&quot; as a part-time sports analyst for the coverage of the 2017 World Series. He returned in late 2019 as a full-time studio analyst following the June 2019 shootings.

==Podcast==
In 2018, Ortiz hosted a podcast, &quot;David Ortiz: The Big Papi Story&quot; alongside Michael Chiklis. The series had four episodes and discussed Ortiz&#x27;s life and career.

==Personal life==

Ortiz&#x27;s nickname &quot;Big Papi&quot; originates from his habit of calling people (and teammates) whose names he could not remember &quot;Papi.&quot; The nickname was given to him by Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy.

On June 11, 2008, Ortiz became a United States citizen at John F. Kennedy Library in Boston.

Ortiz is a fan of the Boston Celtics and convinced Dominican NBA player Al Horford to sign with the Celtics in 2016.

=== Family ===
Each time Ortiz crossed the plate after hitting a home run, he would look up and point both index fingers to the sky in tribute to his mother, Angela Rosa Arias, who died in a car crash in January 2002 at the age of 46. Ortiz also has a tattoo of his mother on his biceps.

Ortiz and his wife, Tiffany, have three children. His wife hails from Kaukauna, Wisconsin, a town in between the cities of Green Bay and Appleton. In April 2013, Ortiz announced that he and his wife were separating, but they later reconciled. Since 2017, Ortiz and his wife and two of their children have resided in Miami; he also maintains a home in the Dominican Republic where his younger son, David Andres (also known as David Ortiz Jr.), lives with his mother Fary Almanzar. An home that Ortiz bought in 2007 in Weston, Massachusetts, was put up for sale in February 2019; it sold in early 2021 for $3.5 million. In December 2021, Tiffany announced on Instragram that the she and David had separated again.

Ortiz&#x27;s daughter Alex, who professionally goes by &quot;Alex Veda&quot; (her first and middle names) to distinguish herself from her famous father, graduated from Berklee College of Music in Boston in 2023. She sang the national anthem before the 2016 Red Sox home opener on April 11, 2016 and did the same before her father was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in the 2022 induction ceremony on July 24, 2022. His son D&#x27;Angelo played baseball at Westminster Christian School in Palmetto Bay, Florida and graduated in 2022. After playing baseball at Miami Dade College, D&#x27;Angelo was drafted by the Red Sox in the 19th round of the 2024 Major League Baseball draft. In August 2024 Ortiz&#x27;s youngest son David Jr. was signed as an international free agent by the Texas Rangers.

=== Business ===
Ortiz has received about $4.5 million in endorsements over the years. In April 2007, sporting-goods company Reebok debuted the Big Papi 10M Mid Baseball cleat, which Ortiz first used during the 2007 MLB All Star Game in San Francisco, California.

In October 2009, Ortiz opened a nightclub called &quot;Forty-Forty&quot; in his native Dominican Republic. In April 2010, rapper and producer Jay-Z and his business partner Juan Perez sued Ortiz for trademark infringement, alleging that the name of Ortiz&#x27;s nightclub was stolen from Jay-Z&#x27;s chain of sports clubs in New York. In March 2011, Ortiz reached a settlement deal with Jay-Z and Perez.

In July 2022, Ortiz launched his &quot;Papi Cannabis&quot; line of cannabis products in collaboration with the company Rev Brands. Ortiz stated: &quot;Cannabis has helped me relax, sleep better, manage stress, and heal physically after a lifetime of playing ball, and I look forward to sharing Papi Cannabis and my personal journey to help people understand its benefits.&quot;

In 2021, Ortiz, among other high-profile athletes and celebrities, was a paid spokesperson for FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange. In November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, wiping out billions of dollars in customer funds. Ortiz, alongside other spokespeople, is currently being sued for promoting unregistered securities through a class-action lawsuit.

===Charity work===
In 2007, Ortiz founded the David Ortiz Children&#x27;s Fund to support a range of his favorite causes and to help children, from Boston to the Dominican Republic and beyond. In 2008, Ortiz allowed his likeness to be used on a charity wine label, called Vintage Papi, with proceeds going to the Children&#x27;s Fund. In 2016, Ortiz joined UNICEF Kid Power as a brand ambassador Kid Power Champion for a global mission in Burkina Faso. A 2017 roast of Ortiz raised $335,000 for his Children&#x27;s Fund.

===June 2019 shooting===

At approximately 8:50 p.m. Atlantic Standard Time on June 9, 2019, Ortiz was shot and severely wounded while at the Dial Bar and Lounge in East Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Authorities stated that Ortiz was &quot;ambushed by a man who got off a motorcycle&quot; and shot him in the back. According to Ortiz&#x27;s spokesperson, Ortiz underwent a six-hour operation performed by three local physicians at the Abel Gonzalez Clinic. During the surgery, a portion of his intestines and colon, as well as his gallbladder, were removed; liver damage was also reported. Jhoel López, a Dominican TV host who was with Ortiz, was also wounded in the leg during the shooting.

On June 10, a medical flight sent by the Red Sox brought Ortiz to Boston, so he could receive further treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). He underwent a second surgery shortly after arriving at MGH, and was reported to be &quot;making good progress toward recovery.&quot; He was released from the hospital on July 26, 2019, following a third surgery; on July 29, 2019, his spokesperson released a statement saying that &quot;Big Papi will be back soon.&quot;

As of June 12, six suspects had been arrested in relation to the shooting and more were being sought. Police Major General Ney Aldrin Bautista Almonte revealed that the alleged organizer of the attack was promised 400,000 Dominican pesos (approximately $7,098) to carry out the attack. Security camera footage showed two men on a motorcycle allegedly planning the attack with a man in a car near the bar where the shooting took place. According to Ortiz&#x27;s friends in the Dominican Republic, Ortiz often went to popular nightspots with them without any security presence, &quot;trusting his fans to protect him.&quot; By June 18, there were at least 11 suspects in custody. 

Ortiz was discharged from MGH on July 26, 2019, after a six week stay. On July 29, in his first Instagram comments since leaving the hospital, Ortiz stated, &quot;too bad I can&#x27;t crush food yet.&quot; He made his first public appearance on September 9, throwing out a ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park.

On June 19, the Dominican Attorney General&#x27;s office announced that Ortiz had not been the intended victim of the gunman and that the shooting had been carried out on the orders of Victor Hugo Gomez Vasquez, a known associate of a Mexican drug cartel. The intended victim, Gomez Vasquez&#x27;s cousin Sixto David Fernández, was a regular patron at the bar. Shortly before the shooting, an accomplice had snapped a picture of the intended victim to guide the shooter, but the picture was blurry and the man&#x27;s black pants were obscured by a white object in the bar. The gunman went in, saw Ortiz wearing white pants, and shot a single bullet at him. Gomez Vasquez was arrested on June 28, as was Alberto Miguel Rodriguez Mota, who allegedly took the photo of Fernández and Ortiz. By July 29, 2019, at least 14 suspects had been arrested.

On March 19, 2022, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reported that Ed Davis, the former Boston Police Commissioner whom Ortiz hired to conduct an independent investigation into the shooting, had disclosed his findings for the first time, contradicting the official account of the shooting and saying that accused drug kingpin César &quot;The Abuser&quot; Peralta had put a bounty on Ortiz, whom he felt disrespected him.

=== Restraining order ===
A restraining order was issued on May 21, 2020, against Ortiz by Fary Almanzar Fernandez, who is also the mother of Ortiz&#x27;s firstborn son, David Andres Ortiz Almanzar. Ortiz was ordered to refrain from &quot;annoying, intimidating or threatening his former partner in person or by phone.&quot; According to Ortiz&#x27;s former partner, he &quot;intimidated and threatened&quot; her.

==Alleged PED use==
On July 30, 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, citing anonymous sources, reported that Ortiz was among a group of over 100 major league players on a list compiled by federal investigators, that allegedly tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during Major League Baseball survey testing conducted in spring training of 2003. The survey testing was agreed to by Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association to determine the extent of performance-enhancing drug use among players before permanent testing was officially implemented starting in 2004. As part of the agreement, the results of the survey testing were supposed to remain confidential and no suspensions or penalties would be issued to any player testing positive.

On August 8, 2009, Ortiz held a press conference before a game at Yankee Stadium and denied ever buying or using steroids and suggested the positive test might have been due to his use of supplements and vitamins at the time. When asked which supplements he had been taking, Ortiz said he did not know. Ortiz was accompanied at the press conference by Michael Weiner, the general counsel of the Major League Baseball Players Association. Because the list of players was seized as part of a government investigation and is currently under court-ordered seal pending the outcome of litigation, Weiner said the players union was unable to provide Ortiz with any details about his test result, including what substance he tested positive for.

On the same day, both Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association issued statements pointing out that because of several factors, any player appearing on the list compiled by federal investigators in 2003 did not necessarily test positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Among those factors were that the total number of players said to be on the list far exceeded the number of collected specimens that tested positive. In addition, there were questions raised regarding the lab that performed the testing and their interpretation of the positive tests. Also, the statement pointed out that certain legal supplements that were available over the counter at the time could cause a positive test result.

On October 2, 2016, at a press conference at Fenway Park, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said it was &quot;entirely possible&quot; Ortiz did not test positive during the MLB survey drug testing in 2003. The commissioner stated that the alleged failed test should not harm Ortiz&#x27;s legacy, and that there were &quot;legitimate scientific questions about whether or not those were truly positives&quot;. Manfred added &quot;Those particular tests were inconclusive because &quot;it was hard to distinguish between certain substances that were legal, available over the counter, and not banned under our program.&quot; He also said &quot;Ortiz has never been a positive at any point under our program&quot; since MLB began testing in 2004 and that it is unfair for Hall of Fame voters to consider &quot;leaks, rumors, innuendo and non-confirmed positive test results&quot; when assessing a player.

<text>104 Klymene is a large, dark Themistian asteroid that was discovered by J. C. Watson on September 13, 1868, and named after one of the many Clymenes in Greek mythology. It is orbiting the Sun with a period of 5.60 years and an eccentricity of 0.16. The orbital plane is inclined by 2.8° to the plane of the ecliptic. It is classified as a C-type asteroid, indicating it probably has a carbonaceous composition. The spectra indicates the presence of aqueous-altered minerals on the surface based upon a sharp feature at a wavelength of 3 μm, and, as of 2015, is the only member of the Themis family found to show this absorption.

Based upon measurements made using adaptive optics at the W. M. Keck Observatory, this object may have a bi-lobed shape with a length of 163 ± 3 km and width of 103 ± 5 km, for an average dimension of 133 km. This asteroid is located near the region of the Themis family but itself considered a background asteroid using HCM-analysis. It is listed as a member of the Hecuba group of asteroids that orbit near the 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter.

104 Klymene has been observed to occult 6 stars between 2009 and 2023.

<text>Henry Garnet (July 1555 – 3 May 1606), sometimes Henry Garnett, was an English Jesuit priest executed for high treason, based solely on having had advanced knowledge of the 1605 Gunpowder Plot and having refused to violate the Seal of the Confessional by notifying the authorities. Born in Heanor, Derbyshire, he was educated in Nottingham and later at Winchester College before he moved to London in 1571 to work for a publisher. There he professed an interest in legal studies and in 1575, he travelled to the continent and joined the Society of Jesus. He was ordained in Rome some time around 1582.

In 1586 Garnet returned to England as part of the Jesuit mission, soon succeeding Father William Weston as Jesuit superior, following the latter&#x27;s capture by the English authorities. Garnet established a secret press, which lasted until late 1588, and in 1594 he interceded in the Wisbech Stirs, a dispute between secular and regular clergy. Fr. Garnet preferred nonviolent resistance to the religious persecution Catholics faced in England. He accordingly approved of the disclosure by Catholic priests of the existence of the 1603 Bye Plot, and repeatedly exhorted English Catholics not to plot violent regime change.

In summer 1605 Garnet met with Robert Catesby, a member of the English nobility who, unknown to him, planned to assassinate the Protestant King James I. The existence of Catesby&#x27;s Gunpowder Plot was revealed to Fr. Garnet by Father Oswald Tesimond on 24 July 1605, but as the information was received under the seal of the confessional, canon law prevented Frs. Garnet and Tesimond from telling the authorities under penalty of immediate excommunication. Instead, Fr. Garnet pleaded with Catesby to cancel what he was plotting. Fr. Garnet also wrote to his superiors in Rome, urging them to order English Catholics not to use violence.

When the plot failed Garnet went into hiding, but he was eventually arrested on 27 January 1606. He was taken to London and interrogated by the Privy Council, whose members included John Popham, Edward Coke and Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury. Imprisoned in the Tower of London, his conversations with fellow prisoner Edward Oldcorne were monitored by eavesdroppers, and his letters to friends such as Anne Vaux were intercepted. His conviction, announced at the end of his trial on 28 March 1606, was a foregone conclusion. Criticised for his use of equivocation, which Coke called &quot;open and broad lying and forswearing&quot;, and condemned for not warning the authorities of what Catesby planned, he was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. He was executed on 3 May 1606.

==Early life==
Henry Garnet (or Garnett) was born some time around July 1555 at Heanor in Derbyshire, son of Brian Garnet (or Garnett) and Alice (née Jay). He had at least five siblings: two brothers, Richard and John, and three sisters, Margaret, Eleanor and Anne, all of whom became nuns at Louvain. He was uncle to Saint Thomas Garnet SJ. Henry studied at the grammar school in Nottingham where, from 1565, his father was master. Following his election as a scholar on 24 August 1567, in 1568 he entered Winchester College, where he apparently excelled. His love of music and &quot;rare and delightful&quot; voice were complemented by an ability to perform songs without preparation, and he was reportedly also skilled with the lute. Father Thomas Stanney wrote that Garnet was &quot;the prime scholar of Winchester College, very skilful in music and in playing upon the instruments, very modest in his countenance and in all his actions, so much that the schoolmasters and wardens offered him very great friendship, to be placed by their means in New College, Oxford.&quot;

==Rome==
Garnet did not enter New College; instead, late in 1571, he left Winchester for London. There he worked for a legal publisher, Richard Tottell, as a proof-reader and corrector. He often dined with Sir John Popham, who as Lord Chief Justice was to preside over the trial of the Gunpowder Plotters, men whose association with Garnet would eventually prove so fateful. Although Garnet professed to Popham an interest in legal studies, in 1575 he sailed for Portugal with Giles Gallop, to enter the Society of Jesus.

The two men travelled to Rome and on 11 September 1575 were accepted into the church at Sant&#x27;Andrea della Valle. Garnet studied under the theologian Father Robert Bellarmine. Two of his professors, Christopher Clavius and Robert Bellarmine, praised his abilities. He was ordained sometime around 1582 and stayed in Rome as a Professor of Hebrew, lecturing also on metaphysics and mathematics. He was also an English confessor at St Peter&#x27;s, but in May 1584 his academic career was curtailed when, perhaps as a consequence of a petition from the Jesuit superior for England William Weston, Father Robert Persons asked that he be sent to England. The Superior General Claudio Acquaviva, who saw Garnet as his successor, refused this request. He thought Garnet more suited to &quot;the quiet life&quot; than that which awaited him in England, but on 2 May 1586 he relented and allowed him to leave. Appointed superior for the journey, Garnet travelled with Robert Southwell, leaving for Calais on 8 May. He landed near Folkestone early in July 1586.

==England==
After meeting the Jesuit superior for England William Weston at a London inn, Garnet, Southwell and Weston travelled to Harlesford, near Marlow, Buckinghamshire. Spending just over a week at the home of Richard Bold, they engaged in prayer and masses, and also took confessions. They discussed their mission in England, deciding to meet each year in February and August (later changed to Easter and autumn). Weston also gave the two men details of Catholic houses that would shelter them.

Acquaviva had instructed that should anything happen to Weston, Garnet was to succeed him as superior in England, which he did when only days after leaving Harlesford, Weston was captured &quot;en route&quot; to London. Acquaviva had also given Garnet permission to print pro-Catholic literature, and so early the next year he met Southwell in London to discuss the establishment of a secret press, which was probably located somewhere around a former Augustinian hospital near Spitalfields. It lasted until late 1588 and was responsible for &quot;A Consolatory Letter to All the Afflicted Catholikes in England&quot;, author unknown, and &quot;An Epistle of Comfort&quot;, by Southwell. From a friend&#x27;s window in Ludgate Hill, Garnet witnessed the November 1588 procession to a thanksgiving service at Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, celebrating the failed Spanish invasion. Spain&#x27;s actions gave Garnet much cause for concern, &quot;For when we thought that there was an end to these disasters by which we are already nearly destroyed, our hope was suddenly turned to sorrow, and now with redoubled effort the overseers are pressing upon us&quot;. People were allowed to spectate from windows only if their loyalty to Queen Elizabeth I was guaranteed by the householder. In a letter to Acquaviva, Garnet said that many of his supporters thought that he was more concerned for the Queen than her Calvinist ministers. In light of the Armada&#x27;s destruction, he also wrote to the general to ask for advice on two versions of a proposed oath to allow Roman Catholics to swear their allegiance to the Queen. The government&#x27;s version required that Catholics reject the pope&#x27;s authority over Elizabeth, whereas the Catholic version proposed that they recognise her authority and &quot;would wish with every effort to struggle to thwart and to fight to the death all those who will in any way endanger the life of her Highness&quot;. The Privy Council rejected the latter.
Garnet&#x27;s first few years in England were spent meeting new priests in London, including John Gerard and Edward Oldcorne. Jesuits had been banished from England since 1585, and if discovered they risked being charged with high treason. Avoiding pursuers was therefore a recurrent problem, and Garnet was almost caught on several occasions. As a result of an almost disastrous meeting at Baddesley Clinton in 1591, when he and many others were almost captured together while renewing their vows, he reorganised the mission into eleven smaller groups, each assigned two weeks annually. Following Southwell&#x27;s capture in June 1592, and the search of Anne Vaux and Eleanor Brooksby&#x27;s rented house in Warwickshire, he wrote to Acquaviva to ask for an assistant who could succeed him as superior. Henry Walpole was thus dispatched, but was captured on his arrival in December 1593, and executed in York in April 1595. Garnet believed that it was his duty to observe (in disguise) the executions of his fellow priests, so as to secretly administer the last rites, and he may have been present at Southwell&#x27;s execution at Tyburn in 1595. The latter&#x27;s death was a significant blow for Garnet, who later wrote of the &quot;intolerable burden of loneliness&quot; he carried while in England.

In November 1593 Garnet travelled to the decrepit and decayed Wisbech Castle, requisitioned by the government in 1579 for the internment of Catholic priests. William Weston was held there. The castle&#x27;s inhabitants were supported by Catholic alms and lived a relatively comfortable existence; Garnet was complimentary about Wisbech, calling it a &quot;college of venerable confessors&quot;. The following year he mediated in a dispute there between secular and regular clergy (the latter represented by the Jesuits), which became known as the Wisbech Stirs. The argument was settled by the end of the year, but Garnet was concerned that reports of discontent at the Jesuit-administered English College in Rome and tension between some Catholic English exiles in Brussels might undermine his efforts to stabilise the situation.

==Gunpowder Plot==

===Introduction to Catesby===
Garnet spent much of 1604 on the move, although few details of his travels exist. At Easter he reportedly gave a Mass at Twigmoor Hall, the house of John Wright. In London, Garnet met the Spanish diplomats Juan de Tassis, 1st Count of Villamediana and Juan Fernández de Velasco y Tovar, 5th Duke of Frías. He visited Tassis two or three times, at Walsingham House and at Somerset House. He also met the French ambassador Christophe de Harlay, Count of Beaumont. In November he was with Anne Vaux (whose family he had been introduced to in summer 1586) at White Webbs near Enfield, renewing the vows given on the Feast of the Presentation of Our Lady.

On 9 June 1605, he was to be found in a room on Thames Street in London, with Robert Catesby. In the midst of what Garnet later recalled was a seemingly casual conversation, Catesby asked the priest about the morality of &quot;killing innocents&quot;. Garnet replied according to Catholic theology, that often, during war, innocents were killed alongside the enemy. According to Antonia Fraser, Garnet may have thought that Catesby&#x27;s request was to do with him possibly raising a regiment in Flanders.

Garnet was not at all like Catesby, described by Fraser as possessing the mentality &quot;of the crusader who does not hesitate to employ the sword in the cause of values which he considers are spiritual&quot;. Catesby was also described as &quot;exceedingly tangled in debts and barely able to subsist&quot; In contrast, Garnet believed that &quot;things were best settled by submission to the will of God.&quot; He was ebullient over King James I&#x27;s succession to the English throne and hoped that there would be no foreign interference. Of the 1603 Bye Plot, revealed (with his blessing) to the Privy Council by two Catholic priests, he wrote that it was &quot;a piece of impudent folly, for we know that it is by peaceful means that his Holiness and other princes are prepared to help us.&quot; He exhorted that Pope Clement VIII instruct all English Catholics not to engage in violent rebellion, &quot;quiete et pacifice&quot;. It was a message echoed by Archpriest George Blackwell, who commanded his priests never to attempt any such thing, but it proved controversial; early in summer 1605 Garnet reported to Rome that English Catholics had reached &quot;a stage of desperation&quot;.

The two met again in July at Fremland in Essex. Garnet told Catesby that he &quot;wished him to look what he did if he intended anything. That he must first look to the lawfulness of the act itself, and then he must not have so little regard of Innocents that he spare not friends and necessary persons for the Commonwealth.&quot; When Catesby offered to tell the priest more, Garnet declined: &quot;I told him what charge we all had of quietness and to procure the like in others.&quot; Garnet also spoke with William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, asking him &quot;if Catholics were able to make their part good by arms against the King&quot;, but Monteagle&#x27;s reply was vague. Author Alan Haynes suggests that Garnet may at that point have become marginalised.

===Seal of the confessional===
Garnet later claimed to have been ignorant of Catesby&#x27;s designs until 24 July, when he was approached by Father Oswald Tesimond. &quot;An intelligent and thoughtful man&quot;, Tesimond wanted his superior&#x27;s advice as Catesby had recently told him of his plan. As Garnet viewed Tesimond&#x27;s information as having been imparted under the seal of the confessional, he later claimed to have felt unable to warn anyone of Catesby&#x27;s plan. According to his own account, the two had a third meeting around 24 July. He read to Catesby a letter he had received from Persons, urging him to speak to the Pope before attempting any scheme, but fearful of being discovered, Catesby declined. So Garnet wrote to Aquaviva, claiming to have prevented several outbreaks of violence, and of his suspicion that there was &quot;a risk that some private endeavour may commit treason or use force against the King&quot;. As he had done following the failed Bye Plot, he urged the pope to publicly warn against the use of force, attempting to hide his knowledge of the plot by suggesting that the warning be aimed at recusants in Wales. He also sent Sir Edmund Baynham to deliver the same message, and when Parliament was prorogued on 28 July, Garnet satisfied himself that the danger had been averted.

On 24 August he was at White Webbs near Enfield, with Anne Vaux, her sister Eleanor Brooksby, her nephew William Brooksby and his wife Dorothy. A few days later the group set out on a pilgrimage to St Winefride&#x27;s Well at Holywell in Wales. They travelled to John Grant&#x27;s home at Norbrook, then Huddington Court near Worcester, through Shrewsbury, and finally to Wales. About 30 people made the journey west, including Everard Digby and his wife, and their secret chaplain Edward Oldcorne, and Nicholas Owen. On his return from Wales, Garnet travelled with Anne Vaux to Rushton Hall, home of the recently deceased Thomas Tresham (father to Francis Tresham). From there they travelled to Digby&#x27;s home at Gayhurst House in Buckinghamshire. Vaux was suspicious that so many horses were being collected at the homes of her friends and family, and confessed to Garnet her fear that &quot;these wild heads had something in hand&quot;. She asked him to speak with Catesby, but Garnet reassured her that Catesby was instead seeking a commission in Flanders. Garnet wrote a letter of recommendation for Catesby for that very purpose. When in October Vaux raised the issue once more, claiming that several women had asked her where they should retreat to once &quot;the brunt was passed in the beginning of Parliament&quot;, Garnet again mentioned Flanders, although Fraser suggests that Vaux&#x27;s questioning must have concerned him deeply.

===Arrest and imprisonment===

Garnet was at Coughton Court on 6 November when Thomas Bates brought news of the plot&#x27;s failure. Catesby wanted him to help raise support in Wales, where it was thought Catholic support would be more likely, but Garnet was horrified. In a letter to Catesby and Digby, he urged them to abandon their &quot;wicked actions&quot; and follow the pope&#x27;s advice. He spent weeks on the run but was eventually arrested on 27 January 1606, at Hindlip Hall. There, for eight days, he and Fr. Edward Oldcorne (later beatified as the Blessed Edward Oldcorne) had secreted themselves in a small, cramped space, unable even to stand or stretch their legs. They received sustenance from their protectors through a small drinking straw hidden within the building&#x27;s structure, but with no commode or drainage they were eventually forced by &quot;customs of nature which must of necessity be done&quot; to emerge from hiding, and were immediately captured. They were taken first to Holt Castle in Worcestershire, and a few days later to London. Garnet was still weak from his ordeal, and Salisbury therefore ordered that he be given a good mount; his supplies were paid for by the king. The group was accompanied by a Puritan minister who &quot;ranted at length without interruption&quot;, but Garnet&#x27;s replies remained erudite, brief and clear—much to the minister&#x27;s disappointment. On his arrival in London he was taken to the Gatehouse Prison in Westminster, which was already home to many Catholic prisoners, including his nephew, Father Thomas Garnet.

Garnet first appeared in front of the Privy Council on 13 February 1606. Present were John Popham, Edward Coke, Sir William Waad, and the Earls of Worcester, Northampton, Nottingham and Salisbury. Superficially, they treated him with respect, removing their hats and addressing him as &quot;Mr Garnet&quot;, although they made fun of his relationship with Anne Vaux, claiming he was her lover, not her confessor. During his questioning he admitted some of his movements, and that he had received Catesby&#x27;s letter on 6 November, but he denied being involved in the plot, whose members he did not name. Garnet was convinced that his captors were interested only in the failed scheme and believed he might be able to clear his name, but the councillors also asked him about the doctrine of equivocation. His own treatise on this topic, one of the &quot;heretical, treasonable and damnable books&quot; found amongst Francis Tresham&#x27;s possessions, was laid on the council table before him. Although it condemned lying, Garnet&#x27;s treatise supported the notion that when questioned, for instance, on the presence of a priest in his house, a Catholic might &quot;securely in conscience&quot; answer &quot;No&quot; if he had a &quot;secret meaning reserved in his mind&quot;. The occasions on which a Catholic might legitimately use equivocation, he supposed, were limited, but such replies could be taken as an example of insincerity or deviousness—especially to the king&#x27;s council, who may not have wanted to see Garnet prove his case. The council&#x27;s view of equivocation was very different from Garnet&#x27;s. In their eyes, it was simple deceit.

The next day, Garnet was moved to the Tower of London, into what he described as &quot;a very fine chamber&quot;. He was afforded claret with his meals, though it took him some time to get bedding and coal for the fireplace. He claimed that Lieutenant of the Tower William Waad treated him well, although on the subject of religion his speeches became &quot;violent and impotent&quot;.

Garnet&#x27;s recent interrogation was only the first of many. Generally, his answers were carefully considered and demonstrated a passive resistance to his questioners; the use of the rack was a distinct possibility, one which he answered with &quot;&quot;Minare ista pueris&quot; [Such threats are only for children]&quot;. What information he did give up was of limited interest only. His jailer, a man named Carey, was employed by Waad to gain the priest&#x27;s trust, offering to relay letters to his nephew in the Gatehouse Prison. Carey then placed Garnet into a cell containing a hole through which he was able to converse with Oldcorne, who was in a neighbouring cell. From &quot;a place which was made for this precise purpose&quot;, two government eavesdroppers were therefore able to record details of conversations between the two priests. Their communications were mostly innocent, although Garnet&#x27;s admission that on one occasion he drank too much wine was later used against him, along with other incriminating evidence recorded during their stay. His communications with his nephew, and Anne Vaux, were also intercepted. Most of these letters found their intended recipient, but not before they had first been read by Waad, who also kept Salisbury informed. Although Garnet told Vaux that the Council&#x27;s evidence constituted nothing but &quot;presumptions&quot;, insufficient for a state trial, early in March he confessed, possibly as a result of torture. Vaux too was arrested and interrogated twice, just as further questions were being asked of Garnet by the council and the king, the latter of whom was interested in his opinion on theological matters.

Despite his claims to have been horrified by Catesby&#x27;s plan, his declaration, which admitted that he had &quot;dealt very reservedly with your Lordships in the case of the late powder action&quot;, gave the government proof that he had prior knowledge of the plot, and in their view, he was therefore guilty of misprision of treason.

===Trial===

Garnet&#x27;s trial took place on Friday 28 March 1606. He was taken to the Guildhall by closed coach; an unusual method, considering prisoners were usually walked to trial, though the authorities may have had some concern about support from a sympathetic crowd. The trial began at about 9:30 am and lasted all day. In attendance were King James (hidden from public view) and several courtiers including Lady Arbella Stuart and Catherine Howard, Countess of Suffolk. Garnet was introduced with his various aliases, which included &quot;Whalley, otherwise Darcy, otherwise Roberts, otherwise Farmer, otherwise Philips&quot;. He was accused of having conspired with Catesby on 9 June 1605 to kill the king, his son, and to &quot;alter and subvert the government of the kingdom and the true worship of God established in England&quot;. He was also accused of having conspired with several others to blow up the House of Lords with gunpowder. He pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot;.

Speaking for the government, Edward Coke accused him of involvement in every treason since 1586, the year he returned to England. According to Coke, the provincial superior was involved in the Main and Bye Plots of 1603. He had sent Edmund Baynham to Rome to gain papal approval for the 1605 plot, and while at Coughton in November, had prayed &quot;for the success of the great action&quot;. Coke called Garnet &quot;a doctor of five Ds, namely, of dissimulation, of deposing of princes, of disposing of kingdoms, of daunting and deterring of subjects, and of destruction&quot;. His supposed inappropriate relationship with Anne Vaux was mentioned, but his adherence to the doctrine of equivocation proved extremely damaging. Francis Tresham&#x27;s deathbed letter, which claimed that Garnet had played no part in the so-called Spanish Treason, was read aloud. Tresham claimed not to have seen Garnet &quot;for fifteen or sixteen years before&quot;, despite government evidence that the two had met more recently. Garnet had not seen the letter and did not know that it referred to events before 1602, not 1605. He was unable to explain it, except by saying &quot;it may be, my Lord, that he meant to equivocate.&quot;

Statements regarding Jesuit-encouraged plots against Queen Elizabeth were read to the court, as well as some of the plotters&#x27; confessions. Garnet defended his use of equivocation with his own treatise on the doctrine. He had denied his conversation with Oldcorne as it was a secret, but said that in matters of faith, equivocation could never be lawful. When asked by Salisbury what he would do if the pope excommunicated King James, he &quot;denied to answer&quot;. His defence of equivocation was scorned by Coke, who called it &quot;open and broad lying and forswearing&quot;. As for Tesimond&#x27;s confession, the planned assassination had not at that point happened and so Salisbury said that Garnet could easily have alerted the government. Salisbury attacked the idea that it had ever been made under the seal of the confessional, and claimed anyway that Garnet could have warned the authorities after his more ordinary conversation with Catesby about the death of innocents; the priest replied by saying that at the time, he did not understand the relevance of Catesby&#x27;s questions. The Earl of Northampton said, in Latin, &quot;quod non-prohibet cum potest, jubet&quot; (what a man does not forbid when he can, he orders). Garnet&#x27;s defence, that he had forbidden Catesby from proceeding, was futile.

The jury took fifteen minutes to decide that Garnet was guilty of treason. He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered.

===Execution===
The day after his trial Garnet made a new statement, which he hoped would clarify his dealings with Tresham. He also wrote to the king, reiterating his stance on violence against a rightful monarch. When the government lied and told him they had captured Tesimond, he wrote an apologetic letter to the priest regarding the nature of their conversation the previous year. He also wrote a final letter to Anne Vaux, on 21 April, relating his lack of fortune over the previous few months.

After about three months spent in the Tower, on Saturday 3 May 1606 Garnet was strapped to a wooden hurdle and taken by three horses to the churchyard of St Paul&#x27;s. He wore a black cloak over his clothes and hat, and spent much of the journey with his hands together and eyes closed. Present in the churchyard were the Sheriff of London, Sir Henry Montague, George Abbot and John Overal. When asked if he had knowledge of any further treasons, Garnet replied that he had nothing to say. He rejected any entreatments to abandon his faith for Protestantism, and said that he had committed no offence against the king. The only thing he thought he might be condemned for was for abiding by the terms of the confessional, and if by that action he had offended the king or state, he asked for forgiveness. The recorder announced that this was an admission of guilt, but Garnet reiterated his not guilty plea and continued to argue the point.

Garnet highlighted the date of his execution, 3 May, the Feast of the Cross, and reaffirmed his innocence. He defended Anne Vaux against claims that their relationship had been inappropriate. He then prayed at the base of the ladder, disrobed down to his long, sewn-up shirt, &quot;that the wind might not blow it up&quot;, and mounted the ladder. He ignored a Protestant minister who came forward, replying to an objectionable member of the audience that he &quot;ever meant to die a true but perfect Catholic&quot;. Bishop Overal protested that &quot;we are all Catholics&quot;, although Garnet disagreed with this. He once again said his prayers, and was then thrown off the ladder. Before the executioner could cut him down alive, many in the crowd pulled on his legs, and as a result, Garnet did not suffer the remainder of his grim sentence. There was no applause when the executioner held Garnet&#x27;s heart aloft and said the traditional words, &quot;Behold the heart of a traitor&quot;. His head was set on a pole on London Bridge, but crowds of onlookers fascinated by its fresh and unblemished appearance eventually forced the government to turn the head upward, so its face was no longer visible.

A bloodstained straw husk saved from the scene of the execution and said to bear Garnet&#x27;s image became an object of curiosity. It was smuggled out of the country into the possession of the Society of Jesus, before being lost during the French Revolution.

==Writings==
Garnet&#x27;s writings include &quot;An Apology Against the Defence of Schisme&quot; (1593), an attack against church papistry in which he scolded Thomas Bell for supporting the occasional taking of Communion in the Church of England. This was followed by &quot;A Treatise of Christian Renunciation&quot; (1593), which comprised a selection of quotations on what Catholics should be prepared to renounce for their faith, and &quot;The Societie of the Rosary&quot; (1593–1594)

His defence of the practice of equivocation was published in &quot;A Treatise against lying and fraudulent dissimulation&quot; (c. 1598), originally titled &quot;A Treatise of Equivocation.&quot; Equivocation was condemned by most of his Protestant contemporaries as outright lying. Even William Shakespeare may have alluded to Garnet in &quot;Macbeth&quot; with the following line: &quot;who committed treason enough for God&#x27;s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven&quot;, although Shakespeare&#x27;s personal views on equivocation are unknown.

<text>Lee Francis Allen (July 2, 1927 – October 18, 1994) was an American tenor saxophone player. Phil Alvin, Allen&#x27;s bandmate in The Blasters, called him one of the most important instrumentalists in rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll. Allen&#x27;s distinctive tone has been hailed as &quot;one of the defining sounds of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot; and &quot;one of the DNA strands of rock.&quot;

Allen was a key figure in New Orleans rock and roll of the 1950s and recorded with many leading performers of the early rock and roll era. He was semiretired from music by the late 1960s, but in the late 1970s returned to performing intermittently until the end of his life.

==Biography==
Allen was born in Pittsburg, Kansas, and raised largely in Denver, Colorado. He played saxophone from his childhood. A combined athletics and music scholarship from Xavier University led him to relocate to New Orleans in 1943.

He fell into the city&#x27;s thriving music scene, performing or recording with dozens of musicians in the early days of rock and roll and rhythm and blues. In 1947, he joined the Paul Gayten Band and later, the Dave Bartholomew Band. Notable are his recordings with the singers Fats Domino and Lloyd Price. Allen also was the sax soloist on most of Little Richard&#x27;s epochal hits from 1955 and 1956. Earl King, whom Allen backed, recalled that Allen was &quot;part of the wallpaper&quot; at Cosimo Matassa&#x27;s studio, and that Allen was on all the records by Huey &quot;Piano&quot; Smith. Allen and drummer Earl Palmer also backed Professor Longhair on many recordings.

His own instrumental, &quot;Walkin&#x27; with Mr. Lee&quot;, released by Ember Records, was a minor hit in 1958, partly because it was frequently played on the television program &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. This and Allen&#x27;s subsequent singles are collected on the album also called &quot;Walkin&#x27; with Mr. Lee&quot;.

He appeared in the film &quot;Sweet Beat&quot; (1959).

By the mid-1960s, Allen found the city of New Orleans no longer the recording mecca it was for many years. So he soon followed Earl Palmer&#x27;s lead and moved to southern California in 1965, performing only occasionally on tours with Fats Domino. He found work at an aircraft manufacturing plant by day and also fell easily into the thriving R &amp; B scene by night. He formed an organ trio and performed with his close friends T-Bone Walker and Big Joe Turner.

The 1972 album &quot;Dr. John&#x27;s Gumbo&quot; by Dr. John features Allen&#x27;s sax work. He also appeared on albums by Buddy Miles in this period.

After the rockabilly revival got going in the late 1970s, younger musicians sought Allen&#x27;s distinctive saxophone. He recorded with the Stray Cats on their second album, &quot;Gonna Ball&quot; (1981).

Allen was a mentor to and eventually a member of The Blasters. He recorded with the roots-rockers on all of their albums except for their debut, &quot;American Music&quot;. The second and all subsequent releases from the band&#x27;s original incarnation, on Slash/Warner Bros, featured him on tenor sax as well as Steve Berlin on baritone sax. Allen also toured with The Blasters during the early to mid-1980s. He is visible in the sequence featuring the band in &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; (1984). He remained a regular guest in later lineups.

In October 1981, Allen played three shows with the Rolling Stones: on October 1 at the Metro Centre, in Rockford, Illinois, and on October 3 and 4 at Folsom Field, in Boulder, Colorado. Allen found it difficult to adjust to the stadium size shows of the Stones and was replaced with Ernie Watts and Bobby Keys for the remainder of the tour.

Allen continued to tour with Fats Domino into the 1990s. In late 1992, he took part in studio dates for what would be his final album: &quot;The Ultimate Session&quot;, released by High Street/Windham Hill in 1994. The group of New Orleans all-stars featured Palmer, Alvin Tyler, Dr. John, and Allen Toussaint.

Lee Allen died of lung cancer in 1994 at age 67. He was survived by his wife, Birdie, as well as five children from a previous marriage: Lee Jr., Patrick, Emmanuel, Aaron, and Karen.

After Allen&#x27;s death, Blasters member Dave Alvin dedicated the song &quot;Mister Lee&quot; (on the 1996 album &quot;Interstate City&quot;) to his longtime friend and bandmate. Alvin noted that melody was Allen&#x27;s passion, and that it was what separated him from less sophisticated honkers. Earl King added that whereas other saxophonists would get too jazzy, Allen had commercial appeal.

<text>Not Quite Human is the name of a series of young adult novels by Seth McEvoy about a scientist and his android creation which resembles a teenager.

==Description==
Widower scientist, Dr. Jonas Carson&#x27;s lifetime work is to create an android he names Chip. In order to conceal his project from those who would use Chip or Dr. Carson&#x27;s skills for sinister purposes, Dr. Carson passes off Chip as a student at a junior high school and claims he is his son. His daughter, Becky, is the only other one who knows the secret, and Dr. Carson takes a job as a science teacher at the school to keep an eye on his &quot;son&quot;. Chip has superior abilities such as great strength and a photographic memory, but also has a large density which gives him more weight than humans of his size. Chip also has a tendency to interpret communication quite literally. Throughout the novels, Chip better simulates being human as he gains a better understanding of humans.

The books were later made into a series of made-for-TV films for the Walt Disney anthology television series, starring Alan Thicke as Dr. Jonas Carson, Robyn Lively as his daughter Becky, and Jay Underwood as Chip. Chip is created to look age 17 at the start of the film series, as opposed to 13 in the novels.

<text>Strange Luck is an American television series that aired on Fox, created by Karl Schaefer and starring D. B. Sweeney in the role of Chance Harper who constantly stumbles into unusual situations. The series aired on Fox from 1995 to 1996. A total of seventeen episodes were aired before the show was canceled due to low ratings. Reruns were shown briefly on the Sci Fi Channel in 1997. The series was initially slotted as a lead-in to &quot;The X-Files&quot; on Friday nights, and was largely shot in Canada like the show which followed it.

==Plot==
Chance Harper, a freelance photographer, is afflicted with a bizarre tendency to always be in the wrong place at the right time. As Chance himself says, &quot;If I go to a restaurant, somebody chokes. If I walk into a bank, it gets robbed.&quot; Harper&#x27;s strange luck began when, as a small child, he was the sole survivor of a plane crash that killed everyone else aboard, including his mother and sister.

== Cast ==
* D. B. Sweeney as Chance Harper
* Pamela Gidley as Audrey Westin
* Cynthia Martells as Dr. Richter
* Frances Fisher as Angie
* Drew Monroe as Spirit
* Scott Plank as Arthur Vandenberg

== Production ==
=== Casting ===
D. B. Sweeney had been primarily a film actor before taking the role of Chance Harper. He did so because he had a series of unsuccessful low-budget films and decided to try his hand at television. He commented that &quot;Fox has spent more time and money and effort promoting me and this show than all of my movies put together&quot;

<text>Mei Foo () is a Hong Kong MTR station located in Mei Foo Sun Chuen, Lai Chi Kok, New Kowloon. It is the only interchange station between the and the , situated between and stations on the Tsuen Wan line and and stations on the Tuen Ma line. Mei Foo station&#x27;s colour is blue.

The Tsuen Wan line part of the station is a simple through station with a central island platform, located under Mount Sterling Mall, a pedestrian-only street between the rows of residential buildings in the Mei Foo Sun Chuen housing estate. The station is designed to facilitate transport needs of the residents of Mei Foo Sun Chuen housing estate, consisting of 132 buildings and several schools, and the point of transfer between the Kowloon urban area and the new town of Tsuen Wan. If there is heavy traffic on the main road into urban Kowloon, the Kwai Chung Road, many commuters get off their buses and use this station as their link to Kowloon and Central on Hong Kong Island.

==History==

=== Tsuen Wan line ===
The station&#x27;s original name was Lai Chi Kok during the planning stage, but upon its opening on 17 May 1982 the station was called &quot;Lai Wan&quot; (荔灣, short for Lai Chi Kok Bay), and was renamed to its current name on 31 May 1985 when opened. Kumagai Gumi was the contractor for the station&#x27;s construction.

=== West Rail line and the latter Tuen Ma line ===
The (then known as KCR West Rail) part of the station was opened on 20 December 2003 along with the rail line. The station is located in the middle of Lai Chi Kok Park, slightly to the west of the Tsuen Wan line&#x27;s part of the station. The contract for the station on the East Rail Line (now Tuen Ma Line) was awarded to Kier-Zen Pacific joint venture. The and West Rail line stations merged into one station on 2 December 2007 in the MTR–KCR merger.

On 27 June 2021, the West Rail line officially merged with the (which was already extended into the &quot;Tuen Ma line Phase 1&quot; at the time) in East Kowloon to form the new , as part of the Shatin to Central link project. Mei Foo was included in the project and is now an intermediate station on the Tuen Ma line.

== Layout ==
Both Tsuen Wan line platforms share the same island platform. Unlike at Nam Cheong station (where there is one cross-platform interchange between the and the Tuen Ma line), the and platforms are relatively far apart. The concourses for these platforms are a five to ten-minute walk along a connecting passageway.

Although the Tuen Ma line platform is constructed at ground level, like Nam Cheong station, the station and surrounding track is sealed to avoid disturbance to the colocated park.

<text>Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers (18 August 1720 – 5 May 1760) was an English nobleman, notable for being the last peer to be hanged, following his conviction for murdering his steward.

==Biography==
Shirley was the eldest son of Laurence Ferrers, himself the third son of the first Earl Ferrers. At the age of twenty, he quit his estates and Oxford University education, and began living a debauched life in France in Paris. At the age of 25 he inherited his title from his insane uncle the 3rd Earl Ferrers, and with it estates in Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Northamptonshire. He lived at Staunton Harold Hall in northwest Leicestershire. In 1752, he married Mary, the youngest sister of Sir William Meredith, 3rd Baronet. Ferrers was also a cousin to Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, the prominent Methodist lady and supporter of George Whitefield, though he was not involved in the Methodist revival.

===Marriage troubles===
Ferrers had a family history of insanity, and from an early age his behaviour seems to have been eccentric, and his temper violent, though he was quite capable of managing his business affairs. Significantly, in 1758, his wife obtained a separation from him for cruelty, which was rare for the time. She would not accept her husband&#x27;s drinking and womanising, and was particularly upset by his illegitimate children. The old family steward, Johnson, may have given evidence on Mary&#x27;s behalf and was afterwards tasked with collecting rents due to her. After Ferrers&#x27; death she was married again, on 28 March 1769, to Lord Frederick Campbell. Mary later died in a fire at her country seat, Coomb Bank, Kent, on 25 July 1807.

===Murder===

The Ferrers&#x27; estates were then vested in trustees; Ferrers secured the appointment of an old family steward named Johnson, as receiver of rents. This man faithfully performed his duty as a servant to the trustees, and did not prove amenable to Ferrers&#x27; personal wishes. On 18 January 1760, Johnson called at the earl&#x27;s mansion at Staunton Harold, Leicestershire, by appointment, and was directed to his lordship&#x27;s study. Here, after some business conversation, Lord Ferrers shot him. Johnson did not die immediately, but instead was given some treatment at the hall followed by continued verbal abuse from a drunken Ferrers before a physician, Thomas Kirkland, was able to convey him to his own home where he died the following morning.

===Trial===
In the following April, Ferrers was tried for murder by his peers in Westminster Hall, with the Attorney General, Charles Pratt KC (later 1st Earl Camden), leading for the prosecution. Ferrers&#x27;s defence, which he conducted in person with great ability, was a plea of insanity, and it was supported by considerable evidence, but he was found guilty. According to Horace Walpole, &quot;Lord Ferrers was not mad enough to be struck with Lady Huntingdon&#x27;s sermons. The Methodists have nothing to brag of his conversion, though Whitefield prayed for him.&quot; Ferrers subsequently said that he had only pleaded insanity to oblige his family, and that he had himself always been ashamed of such a defence.
===Execution===
On 5 May 1760, aged 39, dressed in a light-coloured suit embroidered with silver (the outfit he had worn at his wedding), he was taken in his own carriage from the Tower of London to Tyburn and there hanged by Thomas Turlis. There are several illustrations of the hanging. It has been said that as a concession to his rank the rope used was of silk. After the execution his body was taken to the Barber-Surgeons&#x27; Hall in Monkwell Street for public exhibition and dissection. The execution was widely publicised in popular culture as evidence of equality of the law, and the story of a wicked nobleman who was executed &quot;like a common criminal&quot; was told well into the 19th century.

Lord Ferrers was succeeded in the earldom by his younger brother Washington.

===Contemporary account===
Caroline Powys witnessed the procession and wrote in her Journal:-

&quot;1760 - may 6&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;Earl Ferrers was carried from the Tower to Tyburn executed by a party of Horse and Foot Guards, a Clergyman and the two Sherifs were in the Coach with him he poor unhappy man was drest in his wedding suit, dating as he himself said his whole unhappy conduct from a forced marriage He observed that the apparatus, and being made a spectacle of to so vast a multitude was greatly worse than death itself the procession was two hours &amp; 3/4 from setting out, the Landau &amp; six in which he was ye Sheriffs each in their Chariots one mourning Coach and a Hearse attended, and return’d thro’ Lincolns Inn Fields about one, I think I never shall forget a procession so moving, to know a man an hour before in perfect health then a Lifeless course, yet a just victim to his Country, for the abuse of [f.7] of that power his rank in Life had given him a Title too, his rank indeed caused his punishment, as the good Old King, in answer to numerous petitions of his greatly to be pitied Family made this memorable speech, “ That for the last years of his Life, he had been beyond his most Sanguine hopes successful, for which he should ever return thanks to God, and on his part he had and always would endeavor to Administer justice as he ought, as Events had shown by the punishment of his most exalted Subjects.” This was a noble answer. yet none could help pitying this unhappy Lord, his intellects most probably was rather more in fault than his heart in the murder for which he Suffer’d, and had he been low born his majesty would have shewn more Mercy without such strict Justice.&quot;

<text>105 Artemis is a main-belt asteroid that was discovered by J. C. Watson on September 16, 1868, at Ann Arbor, Michigan. It was named after Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, Moon, and crossways in Greek Mythology.

It is a C-type asteroid, meaning that it is very dark and composed of carbonaceous material. Although it shares a similar orbit to the Phocaea family of S-type asteroids, its classification means 105 Artemis is not a member. The spectra of the asteroid displays evidence of aqueous alteration.

In 1988, this object was detected with radar from the Arecibo Observatory at a distance of 1.07 AU. The measured radar cross-section was 1,800 km2. Photometric measurement of this asteroid made in 2010 at Organ Mesa Observatory in Las Cruces, New Mexico, produced an irregular light curve with a period of 37.150 ± 0.001 hours. During each rotation, the brightness varies by 0.16 ± 0.01 in magnitude.

Based upon radar data, the estimated near surface solid density of the asteroid is
3.0. Refined observations by the Arecibo Observatory, reported in 2006, showed a complex surface with varying albedo. Analysis of the spectra of 105 Artemis shows the presence of hydrated minerals at some rotation angles, but not at others.

An occultation of the star HD 197999 was observed in 1982, which gave an estimated chord length of 110 km. Between 1981 and 2021, 105 Artemis has been observed to occult 23 stars.

<text>Art forgery is the creation and sale of works of art which are intentionally falsely credited to other, usually more famous artists. Art forgery can be extremely lucrative, but modern dating and analysis techniques have made the identification of forged artwork much simpler.

This type of fraud is meant to mislead by creating a false provenance, or origin, of the object in order to enhance its value or prestige at the expense of the buyer. As a legal offense, it is not just the act of imitating a famous artist&#x27;s key characteristics in a piece of art, but the deliberate financial intent by the forger. When caught, some of these forgers attempt to pass off the fakes as jokes or hoaxes on the art experts and dealers they were selling to, or on the art world as a whole.
To excel in this type of forgery, the forger must pass themselves off as incredibly trustworthy and charismatic in order to recruit the necessary middlemen such as art dealers, sellers, experts, etc. as the forger will rarely deal in person. Forgers are often proficient in the current methods of art forgery authentication in order to reverse-engineer their work to cover up any potential mistakes that could get them caught.

Since the 1950s and 1960s there has been a growing demand for indigenous art. Many people began creating and selling faked busts, ceremonial masks, carvings, and sculptures to prestigious institutions such as the British Museum. Some artists even went as far as to create artifacts from cultures of which very little information is known, like Moabite, a Semitic culture that was alluded to in the Old Testament. In the 19th century, an icon painter from Jerusalem began to create clay figures with mysterious inscriptions and sold them to the Altes Museum in Berlin after giving them this false origin.

== History ==
Art forgery dates back more than two thousand years. Ancient Roman sculptors produced copies of Ancient Greek sculptures. The contemporary buyers likely knew that they were not genuine. During the classical period art was generally created for historical reference, religious inspiration, or simply enjoyment. The identity of the artist was often of little importance to the buyer. The first recorded art forgery was in the Italian Renaissance and has since modernized alongside society.

During the Renaissance, many painters took on apprentices who studied painting techniques by copying the works and style of the master. As a payment for the training, the master would then sell these works. This practice was generally considered a tribute, not forgery, although some of these copies have later erroneously been attributed to the master.

Following the Renaissance, the increasing prosperity of the bourgeoisie created a fierce demand for art. Near the end of the 14th century, Roman statues were unearthed in Italy, intensifying the populace&#x27;s interest in antiquities, and leading to a sharp increase in the value of these objects. This upsurge soon extended to contemporary and recently deceased artists. Art had become a commercial commodity, and the monetary value of the artwork came to depend on the identity of the artist. To identify their works, painters began to mark them. These marks later evolved into signatures. As the demand for certain artwork began to exceed the supply, fraudulent marks and signatures began to appear on the open market.

During the 16th century, imitators of Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s style of printmaking added signatures to them to increase the value of their prints. In his engraving of the Virgin, Dürer added the inscription &quot;Be cursed, plunderers and imitators of the work and talent of others&quot;. Even extremely famous artists created forgeries. In 1496, Michelangelo created a sleeping Cupid figure and treated it with acidic earth to cause it to appear ancient. He then sold it to a dealer, Baldassare del Milanese, who in turn sold it to Cardinal Raffaele Riario who later learned of the fraud and demanded his money back. However, Michelangelo was permitted to keep his share of the money.

Art forgery was documented as occurring in Imperial China and in contrast with the Western world, forgeries were seen in a much more positive light as the originals and faked works were seen as having the same level of prestige.

The 20th-century art market has favored artists such as Salvador Dalí, Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee and Matisse and works by these artists have commonly been targets of forgery. These forgeries are typically sold to art galleries and auction houses who cater to the tastes of art and antiquities collectors; at time of the occupation of France by German forces during World War II, the painting which fetched the highest price at Drouot, the main French auction house, was a fake Cézanne.

=== Africa ===
The earliest disputed case of forgery in Africa is the Olukun, the Bronze Head from Ife. German ethnologist Leo Frobenius collected the artifact in 1910 and was forced by British authorities to return it to the Ife palace for safekeeping in 1934. Eventually the head made its way back to the British Museum and while being cleaned in 1940 was erroneously found to be made by sand casting instead of lost-wax casting, alerting the museum that between 1910 and 1934 a fake had supposedly replaced the original bronze head. In 2010, a reexamination and metallurgical analysis of the sculpture conclusively proved the piece to be made by lost wax casting. It is therefore currently assumed to be the original head collected in 1910.

With many visitors to Africa in this time period, the art that was being created began to have more European aspects and inspiration behind them, such as crucifixion sculptures and Afro-Portuguese ivory carvings, and were often made with the intention of selling to tourists. These items went full circle in the case of authenticity; some suggest that it wasn&#x27;t until these pieces became fetishized that they were authentic, while others say that even if they were made with traditional materials for a traditional purpose, they did not conform to traditional forms and therefore were not authentic.

=== Australian Aboriginal ===
Historically, Aboriginal artists were thought to be simply replicating the designs that existed since from the beginning of history and communicated to them by supernatural beings, ancestors, and/or ghosts. Because of this, individual creativity was not critically acknowledged and there was no reason why several people shouldn&#x27;t participate in the creation of a single work. Today, if an artist is offered a prize or they sell a work under their name, they are presumed to be the sole creator of that work. If they have not been the sole creator but have credited themselves as such, they open themselves to the threat of misrepresentation and fraud.

Emily Kame Kngwarreye, one of the most famous Aboriginal artists from Utopia, Northern Territory, has some of the most widely forged works circulating. In the early stages of her painting career, she had inspired a school of learners under her who began to put out their own work under her name, and around half of the &quot;Emily&quot; paintings in the art market were fakes. Later on, the elders in her community were worried about the loss of income from her work and appointed a member who was a talented painter to continue on selling paintings as Emily.

Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri was another highly forged painter who had helped initiate the &#x27;Dot Style&quot; paintings common in Aboriginal artwork. After gaining notoriety in the art market, Clifford began to sign other artwork by Aboriginal artists with his own name in exchange for gifts of cash. Ginger Riley Munduwalawala was another artist who began to sign his name on other artists work in exchange for money, and even took photographs with the art, some of which he posed with a paintbrush as if he was in the midst of working on them for further credibility.

=== Meso-America and pre-Columbia ===
The earliest recorded artifact forgery from the Meso-American area was in the 16th century when the Spanish administration began to create false works in order to meet consumer demands back home in Spain. When Mexico opened their borders after their War of Independence, they became a tourist attraction and a popular destination for North Americans and Europeans. These tourists bought enough artifacts for their curio cabinets that it created a market for forgeries.

In 1820, forgery workshops began to pop up, starting with the workshop on Tlatelolco Street in Mexico City. Later, the Barrios Brothers began their own forgery workshop near an archeology site in San Juan Teotihuacan. Favorite forged artifacts for these workshops were masks; specifically polished jade, greenstone, and stone masks. The stone masks that were created were meant to resemble the British Museum Xipe Totec masks. These stone masks and the Olmec-style masks have continued to appear in the art market since the 1930s.

==Forgers==
There are essentially three varieties of art forger. The person who actually creates the fraudulent piece, the person who discovers a piece and attempts to pass it off as something it is not, typically in order to increase the piece&#x27;s value, and the third who discovers that a work is a fake, but sells it as an original anyway.

Copies, replicas, reproductions and pastiches are often legitimate works, and the distinction between a legitimate reproduction and deliberate forgery is blurred. For example, Guy Hain used original molds to reproduce several of Auguste Rodin&#x27;s sculptures. However, when Hain then signed the reproductions with the name of Rodin&#x27;s original foundry, the works became deliberate forgeries.

===Artists===

An art forger must be at least somewhat proficient in the type of art he is trying to imitate. Many forgers were once fledgling artists who tried, unsuccessfully, to break into the market, eventually resorting to forgery. Sometimes, an original item is borrowed or stolen from the owner in order to create a copy. The forger will then return the copy to the owner, keeping the original for himself. In 1799, a self-portrait by Albrecht Dürer which had hung in the Nuremberg Town Hall since the 16th century, was loaned to . The painter made a copy of the original and returned the copy in place of the original. The forgery was discovered in 1805, when the original came up for auction and was purchased for the royal collection.

Although many art forgers reproduce works solely for money, some have claimed that they have created forgeries to expose the credulity and snobbishness of the art world. Essentially the artists claim, usually after they have been caught, that they have performed only &quot;hoaxes of exposure&quot;.

Some exposed forgers have later sold their reproductions honestly, by attributing them as copies, and some have actually gained enough notoriety to become famous in their own right. Forgeries painted by the late Elmyr de Hory, featured in the film &quot;F for Fake&quot; directed by Orson Welles, have become so valuable that forged de Horys have appeared on the market.

A peculiar case was that of the artist Han van Meegeren who became famous by creating &quot;the finest Vermeer ever&quot; and exposing that feat eight years later in 1945. His own work became valuable as well, which in turn attracted other forgers. One of these forgers was his son Jacques van Meegeren who was in the unique position to write certificates stating that a particular piece of art that he was offering &quot;was created by his father, Han van Meegeren&quot;.
A forger of note specializing in ancient artifacts, Brigido Lara, created the Monumental Veracruz style and produced an entire culture&#x27;s worth of artifacts that ended up in museums around the world. After his early work was bought and sold on the black market, looters asked him to fix artifacts that they had stolen, Lara joined a forgery atelier that produced forged artifacts. In July 1974, Mexican authorities arrested and sentenced Lara to ten years in prison, claiming that he had been looting ancient ceramic artifacts in Veracruz, which he had denied and was able to prove that he had created them himself by making more replicas in the seven months he spent in prison before being released. Upon his release from prison, the Xalapa Museum of Anthropology offered him a job preserving artifacts and creating more replicas for their gift shop.

Forgers usually copy works by deceased artists, but a small number imitate living artists. In May 2004, Norwegian painter Kjell Nupen noticed that the Kristianstad gallery was selling unauthorized, signed copies of his work.

American art forger Ken Perenyi published a memoir in 2012 in which he detailed decades of his activities creating thousands of authentic-looking replicas of masters such as James Buttersworth, Martin Johnson Heade, and Charles Bird King, and selling the forgeries to famous auction houses such as Christie&#x27;s and Sotheby&#x27;s and wealthy private collectors.

===Dealers===
Certain art dealers and auction houses have been alleged to be overly eager to accept forgeries as genuine and sell them quickly to turn a profit. If a dealer finds the work is a forgery, they may quietly withdraw the piece and return it to its previous ownergiving the forger an opportunity to sell it elsewhere.

For example, New York art gallery M. Knoedler &amp; Co. sold $80 million of fake artworks claimed to be by Abstract Expressionist artists between 1994 and 2008. During this time, Glafira Rosales brought in about 40 paintings she claimed were genuine and sold them to gallery president Ann Freedman. Claimed to be by the likes of Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock, the paintings were all in fact forgeries by Pei-Shen Qian, an unknown Chinese artist and mathematician living in Queens. In 2013, Rosales entered a guilty plea to charges of wire fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion. In July 2017, Rosales was ordered by a federal judge to pay US$81 million to victims of the fraud. Pei-Shen Qian was indicted but fled to China and was not prosecuted. The final lawsuit connected with the case was settled in 2019. The case became the subject of a Netflix documentary &quot;Made You Look: The True Story About Fake Art,&quot; released in 2020.

Some forgers have created false paper trails relating to a piece in order to make the work appear genuine. British art dealer John Drewe created false documents of provenance for works forged by his partner John Myatt, and even inserted pictures of forgeries into the archives of prominent art institutions. In 2016, Eric Spoutz plead guilty to one count of wire fraud related to the sale of hundreds of falsely-attributed artworks to American masters, accompanied by forged provenance documents. Spoutz was sentenced to 41 months in federal prison and ordered to forfeit the $1.45 million he made from the scheme and pay $154,100 in restitution.

Experts and institutions may also be reluctant to admit their own fallibility. Art historian Thomas Hoving estimates that various types of forged art comprise up to 40% of the art market, though others find this estimate to be absurdly high.

The Canadian art forger, David Voss created thousands of forgeries of Indigenous artworks, in particular the work of the Anishmaabe artist Norval Morrisseau, of the Ojibway Bingwi Neyaashi Anishinaabek First Nation who had been deceased since 1987. He has forged documents between 1996 and 2019 as a part of a fraud ring that was based in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Working with a ring of eight people, they committed the largest art fraud in Canada, and Artforum magazine claims it was the &quot;world&#x27;s biggest art fraud.&quot;

=== Genuine fakes ===
After his conviction, John Myatt continues to paint and sell his forgeries as what he terms &quot;Genuine Fakes.&quot; This allows Myatt to create and sell legitimate copies of well-known works of art, or paint one in the style of an artist. His Genuine Fakes copy artists such as Vincent van Gogh, Claude Monet, Leonardo da Vinci and Gustav Klimt, which can be bought as originals or limited edition prints. They are popular among collectors, and can sell for tens of thousands of pounds (GBP).

British businessman James Stunt has allegedly commissioned a number of &quot;genuine fakes&quot; by Los Angeles artist and convicted forger Tony Tetro. However, some of these works were loaned by Stunt to the Princes&#x27; Foundation, which is one of King Charles III&#x27;s many charities, and displayed at historic Dumfries House, with the understanding that they were genuine. When Tetro claimed the works as his own, they were quietly removed from Dumfries House and returned to Stunt.

==Methods of detection==
The most obvious forgeries are revealed as clumsy copies of previous art. A forger may try to create a &quot;new&quot; work by combining the elements of more than one work. The forger may omit details typical to the artist they are trying to imitate, or add anachronisms, in an attempt to claim that the forged work is a slightly different copy, or a previous version of a more famous work. To detect the work of a skilled forger, investigators must rely on other methods.

===Technique of examination===
Often a thorough examination (sometimes referred to as Morellian Analysis) of the piece is enough to determine authenticity. For example, a sculpture may have been created with obviously modern methods and tools. Some forgers have used artistic methods inconsistent with those of the original artists, such as incorrect characteristic brushwork, perspective, preferred themes or techniques, or have used colors that were not available during the artist&#x27;s lifetime to create the painting. Some forgers have dipped pieces in chemicals to &quot;age&quot; them and some have even tried to imitate worm marks by drilling holes into objects (see image, right).

While attempting to authenticate artwork, experts will also determine the piece&#x27;s provenance. If the item has no paper trail, it is more likely to be a forgery. Other techniques forgers use which might indicate that a painting is not authentic include:
* Frames, either new or old, that have been altered in order to make forged paintings look more genuine.
* To hide inconsistencies or manipulations, forgers will sometimes glue paper, either new or old, to a painting&#x27;s back, or cut a forged painting from its original size.
* Recently added labels or artist listings on unsigned works of art, unless these labels are as old as the art itself, should cause suspicion.
* While art restorers legitimately use new stretcher bars when the old bars have worn, new stretcher bars on old canvases might be an indication that a forger is attempting to alter the painting&#x27;s identity.
* Old nail holes or mounting marks on the back of a piece might indicate that a painting has been removed from its frame, doctored and then replaced into either its original frame or different frame.
* Signatures on paintings or graphics that look inconsistent with the art itself (either fresher, bolder, etc.).
* Unsigned work that a dealer has &quot;heard&quot; is by a particular artist.

More recently, magnetic signatures, such as those used in the ink of bank notes, are becoming popular for authentication of artworks.

===Forensic authentication===
If examination of a piece fails to reveal whether it is authentic or forged, investigators may attempt to authenticate the object using some, or all, of the forensic methods below:
*Carbon dating is used to measure the age of an object up to 10,000 years old.
*&quot;White Lead&quot; dating is used to pinpoint the age of an object up to 1,600 years old.
*Conventional x-ray can be used to detect earlier work present under the surface of a painting (see image, right). Sometimes artists will legitimately re-use their own canvasses, but if the painting on top is supposed to be from the 17th century and the one underneath shows people in 19th-century dress, the scientist will assume the top painting is not authentic. Also x-rays can be used to view inside an object to determine if the object has been altered or repaired.
**X-ray diffraction (the object bends x-rays) is used to analyze the components that make up the paint an artist used, and to detect pentimenti (see image, right).
**X-ray fluorescence (bathing the object with radiation causes it to emit X-rays) which can reveal if the metals in a metal sculpture or the composition of pigments are too pure, or newer than their supposed age. This technique can also reveal the artist&#x27;s (or forger&#x27;s) fingerprints.
*Ultraviolet fluorescence and infrared analysis are used to detect repairs or earlier painting present on canvasses.
*Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) are used to detect anomalies in paintings and materials. If an element is present that the investigators know was not used historically in objects of this type, then the object is not authentic.
*Pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) can be used to analyze the paint-binding medium. Similar to AAS and ICP-MS, if there are elements detected that were not used in the period, or not available in the region where the art is from, then the object is not authentic.
*Stable isotope analysis can be used to determine where the marble used in a sculpture was quarried.
*Thermoluminescence (TL) is used to date pottery. TL is the light produced by heat; older pottery produces more TL when heated than a newer piece.
*A feature of genuine paintings sometimes used to detect forgery is craquelure.

===Digital authentication===
Statistical analysis of digital images of paintings is a new method that has recently been used to detect forgeries. Using a technique called wavelet decomposition, a picture is broken down into a collection of more basic images called sub-bands. These sub-bands are analyzed to determine textures, assigning a frequency to each sub-band. The broad strokes of a surface such as a blue sky would show up as mostly low frequency sub-bands whereas the fine strokes in blades of grass would produce high-frequency sub-bands.
A group of 13 drawings attributed to Pieter Brueghel the Elder was tested using the wavelet decomposition method. Five of the drawings were known to be imitations. The analysis was able to correctly identify the five forged paintings. The method was also used on the painting &quot;Virgin and Child with Saints&quot;, created in the studios of Pietro Perugino. Historians have long suspected that Perugino painted only a portion of the work. The wavelet decomposition method indicated that at least four different artists had worked on the painting.

==Problems with authentication==
Art specialists with expertise in art authentication began to surface in the art world during the late 1850s. At that time they were usually historians or museum curators, writing books about paintings, sculpture, and other art forms. Communication among the different specialties was poor, and they often made mistakes when authenticating pieces. While many books and art catalogues were published prior to 1900, many were not widely circulated, and often did not contain information about contemporary artwork. In addition, specialists prior to the 1900s lacked many of the important technological means that experts use to authenticate art today. Traditionally, a work in an artist&#x27;s &quot;catalogue raisonné&quot; has been key to confirming the authenticity, and thus value. Omission from an artist&#x27;s catalogue raisonné indeed can prove fatal to any potential resale of a work, notwithstanding any proof the owner may offer to support authenticity.

The fact that experts do not always agree on the authenticity of a particular item makes the matter of provenance more complex. Some artists have even accepted copies as their own work – Picasso once said that he &quot;would sign a very good forgery&quot;. Camille Corot painted more than 700 works, but also signed copies made by others in his name, because he felt honored to be copied. Occasionally work that has previously been declared a forgery is later accepted as genuine; Vermeer&#x27;s &quot;Young Woman Seated at the Virginals&quot; had been regarded as a forgery from 1947 until March 2004, when it was finally declared genuine, although some experts still disagree.

At times restoration of a piece is so extensive that the original is essentially replaced when new materials are used to supplement older ones. An art restorer may also add or remove details on a painting, in an attempt to make the painting more saleable on the contemporary art market. This, however, is not a modern phenomenon - historical painters often &quot;retouched&quot; other artist&#x27;s works by repainting some of the background or details.

Many forgeries still escape detection; Han van Meegeren, possibly the most famous forger of the 20th century, used historical canvasses for his Vermeer forgeries and created his own pigments to ensure that they were authentic. He confessed to creating the forgeries only after he was charged with treason, an offense which carried the death penalty. So masterful were his forgeries that van Meegeren was forced to create another &quot;Vermeer&quot; while under police guard, to prove himself innocent of the treason charges.

A recent instance of potential art forgery involves the Getty kouros, the authenticity of which has not been resolved. The Getty Kouros was offered, along with seven other pieces, to The J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, California, in the spring of 1983. For the next 12 years art historians, conservators, and archaeologists studied the Kouros, scientific tests were performed and showed that the surface could not have been created artificially. However, when several of the other pieces offered with the Kouros were shown to be forgeries, its authenticity was again questioned. In May 1992, the Kouros was displayed in Athens, Greece, at an international conference, called to determine its authenticity. The conference failed to solve the problem; while most art historians and archeologists denounced it, the scientists present believed the statue to be authentic. To this day, the Getty Kouros&#x27; authenticity remains a mystery and the statue is displayed with the date: &quot;Greek, 530 B.C. or modern forgery&quot;.

To combat these issues, some initiatives are being developed.

The Authentication in Art Foundation. Established in 2012 by experts from different fields involved with the authenticity of art. The aim of the foundation is to bring together experts from different specialities to combat art forgery. Among its members are noted experts such as David Bomford, Martin Kemp, and Maurizio Seracini.

The Cultural Heritage Science Open Source – CHSOS, founded by Antonino Cosentino. They &quot;provide practical methods for the scientific examination of fine arts, historical and archaeological objects&quot;.

The International Foundation for Art research – IFAR. Established 1969, it is a &quot;not-for-profit educational and research organization dedicated to integrity in the visual arts. IFAR offers impartial and authoritative information on authenticity, ownership, theft, and other artistic, legal, and ethical issues concerning art objects. IFAR serves as a bridge between the public, and the scholarly and commercial art communities&quot;.

Institute of Appraisal and Authentication of works of Art – i3A. A not-for-profit organization that gathers professionals of different fields, providing equipment and preparing procedure manuals aligned with international techniques, in the search of further knowledge on the production of Brazilian artists.

==Photographic forgery==
Recently, photographs have become the target of forgers, and as the market value of these works increase, so will forgery continue. Following their deaths, works by Man Ray and Ansel Adams became frequent targets of forgery. The detection of forged photography is particularly difficult, as experts must be able to tell the difference between originals and reprints.

In the case of photographer Man Ray print production was often poorly managed during his lifetime, and many of his negatives were stolen by people who had access to his studio. The possession of the photo-negatives would allow a forger to print an unlimited number of fake prints, which he could then pass off as original. Fake prints would be nearly indistinguishable from originals, if the same photographic paper was used. Since unused photographic paper has a short (2–5 years) useful life, and the composition of photographic paper was frequently changed, the fakes would have had to be produced not long after the originals.

Further complicating matters, following Man Ray&#x27;s death, control of printing copyrights fell to his widow, Juliet Man Ray, and her brother, who approved production of a large number of prints that Man Ray himself had earlier rejected. While these reprints are of limited value, the originals, printed during Man Ray&#x27;s lifetime, have skyrocketed in value, leading many forgers to alter the reprints, so that they appear to be original.

==US legal issues==
In the United States, criminal prosecutions of art forgers are possible under federal, state and/or local laws.

For example, federal prosecutions have been successful using generalized criminal statutes, including the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). A successful RICO charge was brought against a family which had sold counterfeit prints purportedly by Chagall, Miró, and Dalí. The defendants were also found guilty of other federal crimes including conspiracy to defraud, money laundering, and postal fraud. Federal prosecutors are also able to prosecute forgers using the federal wire fraud or mail fraud statutes where the defendants used such communications.

However, federal criminal prosecutions against art forgers are seldom brought due in part to high evidentiary burdens and competing law enforcement priorities. For example, internet art frauds now appear in the federal courts&#x27; rulings that one may study in the PACER court records. Some frauds are done on the internet on a popular auction websites. Traces are readily available to see the full extent of the frauds from a forensic standpoint or even basic due diligence of professionals who may research matters including sources of PACER / enforcing authority records and on the internet.

Prosecution is also possible under state criminal laws, such as prohibitions against criminal fraud, or against the simulation of personal signatures. However, in order to trigger criminal liability under states&#x27; laws, the government must prove that the defendant had intent to defraud. The evidentiary burden, as in all criminal prosecutions, is high; proof &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; is required.

Art forgery may also be subject to civil sanctions. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for example, has used the FTC Act to combat an array of unfair trade practices in the art market. An FTC Act case was successfully brought against a purveyor of fake Dalí prints in &quot;FTC v. Magui Publishers, Inc.&quot;, who was permanently enjoined from fraudulent activity and ordered to restore their illegal profits. In that case, the defendant had collected millions of dollars from his sale of forged prints.

At the state level, art forgery may constitute a species of fraud, material misrepresentation, or breach of contract. The Uniform Commercial Code provides contractually-based relief to duped buyers based on warranties of authenticity. The predominant civil theory to address art forgery remains civil fraud. When substantiating a civil fraud claim, the plaintiff is generally required to prove that the defendant falsely represented a material fact, that this representation was made with intent to deceive, that the plaintiff reasonably relied on the representation, and the representation resulted in damages to the plaintiff.

Some legal experts have recommended strengthening existing intellectual property laws to address the growing problem of art forgeries proliferating in the mass market. They argue that the existing legal regime is ineffective in combating this growing trend.

== UK legal issues ==
In the United Kingdom, if a piece of art is found to be a forgery, then the owner will have different legal remedies according to how the work was obtained. If bought at an auction house, then there may be a contractual guarantee which enables the buyer to be reimbursed for the piece, if returned within a set period. Further contractual warranties may be applicable through purchase meaning that terms such as fitness for purpose could be implied (ss.13–14 Sale of Goods Act 1979 or ss. 9-11 Consumer Rights Act 2015).

Detecting forgeries is difficult for a multitude of reasons; issues with the lack of resources to identify forgeries, a general reluctance to identify forgeries due to negative economic implications for both owner and dealer and the burden of proof requirement means its problematic to criminally charge forgers. Further, the international nature of the art market creates difficulties due to contrasting laws from different jurisdictions.

==Art crime education==
In summer 2009, ARCA - the Association for Research into Crimes against Art - began offering the first postgraduate program dedicated to the study of art crime. The Postgraduate Certificate Program in Art Crime and Cultural Heritage Protection includes coursework that discusses art fakes and forgery. Education on art crime also requires research efforts from the scholarly community through analysis on fake and forged artworks.

<text>Archaeological forgery is the manufacture of supposedly ancient items that are sold to the antiquities market and may even end up in the collections of museums. It is related to art forgery.

A string of archaeological forgeries have usually followed news of prominent archaeological excavations. Historically, famous excavations like those in Crete, the Valley of the Kings in Egypt and Pompeii have caused the appearance of a number of forgeries supposedly spirited away from the dig. Those have been usually presented in the open market but some have also ended up in museum collections and as objects of serious historical study.

In recent times, forgeries of pre-Columbian pottery from South America have been very common. Other popular examples include Ancient Egyptian earthenware and supposed ancient Greek cheese. There have also been paleontological forgeries like the archaeoraptor or the Piltdown Man skull.

==Motivations==
Most archaeological forgeries are made for reasons similar to art forgeries – for financial gain. The monetary value of an item that is thought to be thousands of years old is higher than if the item were sold as a souvenir.

However, archaeological or paleontological forgers may have other motives; they may try to manufacture proof for their point of view or favorite theory (or &quot;against&quot; a point of view/theory they dislike), or to gain increased fame and prestige for themselves. If the intention is to create &quot;proof&quot; for religious history, it is considered pious fraud.

==Detection==

Investigators of archaeological forgery rely on the tools of archaeology in general. Since the age of the object is usually the most significant detail, they try to use radiocarbon dating or neutron activation analysis to find out the real age of the object.

==Criticisms of antiquities trade==

Some historians and archaeologists have strongly criticized the antiquities trade for putting profit and art collecting before scientific accuracy and veracity. This, in effect, favours the archaeological forgery. Allegedly, some of the items in prominent museum collections are of dubious or at least of unknown origin. Looters who rob archaeologically important places and supply the antiquities market are rarely concerned with exact dating and placement of the items. Antiquities dealers may also embellish a genuine item to make it more saleable. Sometimes traders may even sell items that are attributed to nonexistent cultures.

As is the case with art forgery, scholars and experts don&#x27;t always agree on the authenticity of particular finds. Sometimes an entire research topic of a scholar may be based on finds that are later suspected as forgeries.

==Known archaeological forgers==

* Curzio Inghirami (1614—1655), 17th century Italian archaeologist and historian known as a forger of Etruscan artifacts.
* Alceo Dossena (1878–1937), 19th century Italian creator of many Archaic and Medieval statues
* Shinichi Fujimura (b. 1950), Japanese amateur archeologist who planted specimens on false layers to gain more prestige
* Alois Anton Führer (1853-1930), German indologist who forged many inscriptions
* Shaun Greenhalgh (b. 1961), a prolific and versatile British forger, who, with the help of his family, forged Ancient Egyptian statues, Roman silverware and Celtic gold jewelry among more modern artworks. Arrested in 2006 attempting to sell three Assyrian reliefs to the British Museum.
* Brigido Lara (b. 1939-1940), Mexican forger of pre-Columbian antiquities
*James Mellaart (1925–2012), English archaeologist and author who is noted for his discovery of the Neolithic settlement of Çatalhöyük in Turkey. After his death, it was discovered that he had forged many of his &quot;finds&quot;, including murals and inscriptions used to discover the Çatalhöyük site.
* Edward Simpson (b. 1815, 1874), Victorian English forger of prehistoric flint tools. He sold forgeries to many British museums, including the Yorkshire Museum and the British Museum

* Tjerk Vermaning (1929–1986), Dutch amateur archaeologist whose Middle Paleolithic finds were declared forgeries

==Known archaeological forgeries and hoaxes==

* Calaveras Skull (&quot;discovered&quot; 1866), purported to prove that humans lived in North America as early as the Pliocene Epoch (5.33–2.58 MYA)
* Cardiff Giant (&quot;discovered&quot; 1869), carved gypsum statue presented as a petrified man, over tall
* Davenport Tablets (discovered 1877–1878), ornately carved slate tablets of purported Native American origin, but dubious authenticity
* Drake&#x27;s Plate of Brass (discovered 1936), purported to have been left by Francis Drake after landing in Northern California in 1579
* &quot;Egyptian mummy&quot; ca. 1898, purchased from the estate of Confederate Colonel Breevoort Butler in the 1920s, the &quot;mummy&quot; was found to be a wooden frame covered with papier-mache; it is on display at the Old Capitol Museum in Jackson, Mississippi with its true nature openly revealed
* Etruscan terracotta warriors purchased by New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1915 to 1921; announced as forgeries in 1961
* Grave Creek Stone
* Japanese Paleolithic hoax
* Kinderhook plates
* Michigan relics

<text>The Plain Dealer is the major newspaper of Cleveland, Ohio; it is a major national newspaper. In the fall of 2019 it ranked 23rd in U.S. newspaper circulation, a significant drop since March 2013, when its circulation ranked 17th daily and 15th on Sunday.

, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; had 94,838 daily readers and 171,404 readers on Sunday. &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;″s media market, the Cleveland-Akron Designated Market Area, has a population of 3.8 million people making it the 19th-largest market in the United States.

In August 2013, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; reduced home delivery to four days a week, including Sunday. A daily version of &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; is available electronically as well as in print at stores, newsracks and newsstands.

==History==
===Founding===
The newspaper was established in January 1842 when two brothers, Joseph William Gray and Admiral Nelson Gray, took over &quot;The Cleveland Advertiser&quot; and changed its name to &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;. &quot;The Cleveland Advertiser&quot; had been published from 1831 to 1841. Some sources attribute the current spelling of the city name to &quot;The Cleveland Advertiser&quot;″s dropping the first &quot;a&quot; from the name of the city&#x27;s founder, Moses Cleaveland, so the newspaper&#x27;s name would fit on the masthead but others dispute that story.

===Name===
When the Gray brothers began publishing their newspaper in 1842, they wrote an explanation of their choice of name; after a discussion of several other possible names, they wrote, &quot;but our democracy and modesty suggest the only name that befits the occasion, the PLAIN DEALER.&quot; The phrase means &quot;someone who interacts or does business straightforwardly and honestly&quot;. Their choice of name was probably inspired by &quot;The Plaindealer&quot;, a weekly paper described as Jacksonian or radical, published in New York City by William Leggett from 1836 to either 1837 or 1839. Several other newspapers in California, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Oregon, Wisconsin, Manitoba, and South Australia later adopted versions of the same name in the 19th and early 20th centuries. At least three continue: &quot;Indiana Plain Dealer&quot;, a 2024 combination of newspapers including the former &quot;Wabash Plain Dealer&quot;, which had served Wabash, Indiana since 1859; the &quot;Ouray County Plaindealer&quot; of Ouray County, Colorado under names that included &quot;Plaindealer&quot; during 1888–1939 and since 1969; and the &quot;Cresco Times Plain Dealer&quot; of Cresco, Iowa. Winston Churchill reportedly said about the Cleveland paper, &quot;I think that by all odds, the Plain Dealer has the best newspaper name of any in the world.&quot; Although its first edition in 1842 was captioned simply &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, the name on the newspaper&#x27;s masthead included &quot;Cleveland&quot; for much of its history, and dropped the city name sometime between 1965 and 1970.

===Ownership history===
Joseph William Gray owned (initially with his brother) and edited the newspaper from 1842 until his death in 1862. A series of editors controlled the paper between then and 1885, when real estate investor Liberty Emery Holden purchased it. When Holden died in 1913, ownership of the Plain Dealer was placed in trust for his heirs.
WHK (AM) and WJAY were purchased by United Broadcasting Company in 1934 and 1936, respectively. United Broadcasting company was owned by the Forest City Publishing Company, which in turn owned &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fadedsignals/67518354911&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1967, the paper&#x27;s publishing company, The Plain Dealer Publishing Company, was part of the Forest City Publishing Company, which also published the &quot;Cleveland News&quot; until its closing in 1960. One of Holden&#x27;s heirs, Holden&#x27;s great-grandson Thomas Vail, became the paper&#x27;s editor and publisher in 1963. On March 1, 1967, the Holden trustees, including Vail, sold the Plain Dealer to Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr.&#x27;s newspaper chain for $54.2 million, then the highest price ever paid for a U.S. newspaper. Advance Publications Inc., a New York-based media company owned by Newhouse&#x27;s heirs, continues to own the Plain Dealer.

===Competition===
&quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; has been the sole major newspaper for Cleveland and Northeast Ohio since its two main 20th-century competitors, the &quot;Cleveland News&quot; and &quot;The Cleveland Press&quot;, closed in 1960 and 1982 respectively. However, since 2015, a number of nonprofit news outlets have begun reporting including the Cleveland Observer, Cleveland Documenters, The Land, and Signal Cleveland.

==Cleveland.com==
Cleveland.com which was launched by Advance Publications in 1997, is the sister company of &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;. Cleveland.com has only an online presence, while &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; provides a print newspaper only, not a digital edition. Content from each is cross-posted on the other site. Cleveland.com is described by its owners as &quot;the premier news and information website in the state of Ohio&quot;. Though it is under the same ownership as &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, cleveland.com was operated by a separate company and had separate staff and offices.

===History===
The corporate structure underpinning these changes was the launch, announced in April 2013 and effective that August, of a &quot;new, digitally focused company,&quot; also under ownership of Advance Publications, initially (in 2013) called the Northeast Ohio Media Group (NEOMG) and renamed in January 2016 as Advance Ohio. (The renaming happened several weeks after a major reorganization of the newsroom that included layoffs.) The original, older parent company, Plain Dealer Publishing Company, kept responsibility for &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; (i.e., the print edition), only, while NEOMG gained responsibility for operating cleveland.com and Sun Newspapers (also known as the &quot;Sun News&quot; suburban papers, a group of smaller, weekly, more suburban-oriented newspapers in the Greater Cleveland metro area also owned by Advance Publications). NEOMG was also made responsible for all ad sales and marketing for &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, &quot;Sun News&quot;, and cleveland.com. Both NEOMG (later Advance Ohio) and the Plain Dealer Publishing Company provide content to &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; and cleveland.com.

One way that contemporary observers viewed the 2013 establishment of NEOMG, in conjunction with the termination of daily home delivery and personnel cuts of the same year, was as implementation by &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;&#x27;s owner, Advance Publications, of a strategy to change its business from daily delivery of a print newspaper to online delivery of news, as Advance had done when it ended daily delivery of the &quot;New Orleans Times-Picayune&quot;.

Another way that the formation of NEOMG has been viewed is as a strategy to weaken, and ultimately kill, a labor union, by moving tasks from the unionized &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; staff to the non-unionized staff at cleveland.com. The division of &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; into two separate companies, a unionized, print organization and a non-union, online organization, was dubbed a &quot;transparent union-busting schism scheme&quot; by &quot;Cleveland Scene&quot; an alternative weekly Cleveland newspaper. The labor union representing Plain Dealer employees was called, from its founding in 1933 until its closure in 2020 as a result of these changes, Newspaper Guild Local 1, because it was the first local chapter of the national union now called the NewsGuild. The Plain Dealer News Guild also called NEOMG&#x27;s formation evidence of Advance&#x27;s involvement in &quot;union-busting&quot;, and repeated the claim in response to subsequent layoffs.

In February 2017, Advance Ohio named Chris Quinn editor and publisher. Quinn previously served as vice president of content at NEOMG and was the metro editor at &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; prior to that.

In 2019, cleveland.com was attracting an average of 9.9 million users monthly.

====Reviews====
In 2006, &quot;Cleveland Magazine&quot; called cleveland.com &quot;mediocre compared to its peers&quot;, while saying that it &quot;has only recently started to improve&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Cleveland Scene&quot;, the alternative weekly, said that &quot;Advance&#x27;s sites are notoriously poorly designed and borderline unnavigable&quot; and, to demonstrate its non-local management, said that Advance wanted to give the cleveland.com site a black-and-yellow color scheme, &quot;until someone informed them those are Steelers colors&quot;.

==Shrinking in the 21st century==
Since the late 20th century, like other media business organizations, the newspaper has faced reductions in circulation and revenue; it has undergone restructuring and layoffs.

===Declining circulation===
The paper&#x27;s circulation declined from the 1980s through about the first decade of the twenty-first century, then dropped precipitously in the following decade or so; the following figures (using circulation numbers derived from the same source, though made public only in other sources and in a patchwork fashion) show that in the 24 years between 1983 and 2007 the paper&#x27;s circulation dropped by 33% (daily) and 11% (Sunday), while in the next 12 years between 2007 and 2019, it lost a further 79% and 62% of its daily and Sunday circulation.

===Reductions in newspaper size and delivery===
On December 18, 2005, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; ceased publication of its weekly &quot;Sunday Magazine&quot;, which had been published since 1919. Its demise was attributed to rising expenses and the poor economy. The editor of &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, Doug Clifton, said that stories that would formerly have appeared in the &quot;Sunday Magazine&quot; would be integrated into other areas of the paper. In June 2008, the paper announced that it would cut four sections and an average of 32 pages per week.

In August 2013, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; reduced home delivery from seven days a week to four: Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. It continued to publish an edition seven days a week that is available in electronic form at cleveland.com, and in print at stores, newsracks and newsstands. Subscribers to the four print editions have access to the digital edition seven days a week. (Plans announced in April 2013 had called for a reduction to three days of delivery by August 2013, but Saturday delivery was retained after complaints from auto dealers, a major category of Saturday advertiser.)

===Closure and transfer of bureaus===
&quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; formerly operated a variety of news bureaus. By the middle of 2014, both the state capital bureau in Columbus and the Washington bureau were shifted to the Northeast Ohio Media Group, as shown by the affiliations of their bureau chiefs.

===Elimination of staff, 2006–2020===
In the early 2000s, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; employed almost 350 reporters and editors; by 2020 that number was zero. The elimination of its entire staff took the form of a series of cuts between 2006 and 2020, described below.

==== 2006–2009 buyouts, staff cuts, and pay decrease ====
Between October and November 2006, about 64 employees, or one-sixth of those in the newsroom, accepted a buyout offer to leave the newspaper, reducing the newsroom staff from 372 to 308. In December 2008, the paper reduced its newsroom staff by 50 persons, or 20%; 27 accepted a buyout offer and then 23 more were fired.

In 2009, employees agreed to accept a 12% pay cut in exchange for a two-year no-layoff agreement.

====2013 cuts====
In December 2012, members of the Newspaper Guild reported that &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; management had told them that, after the January 2013 expiration of a no-layoff provision in the union&#x27;s contract, it planned to eliminate about one-third of the newspaper&#x27;s staff and cut 58 of 168 union positions.

Later in December 2012, the guild endorsed an agreement with &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; management accepting the expected layoffs of 58 journalists starting in May 2013, but restoring some of the pay cut union members had accepted in 2009, setting a severance package, and minimizing future layoffs through 2019 (to &quot;just one more modest downsizing&quot;). The agreement also allowed work to &quot;flow freely&quot; between &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; and cleveland.com, in particular changing the rules to allow work of non-union staff of cleveland.com to be published in &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;. Following the agreement about two dozen newsroom employees departed voluntarily.

On the morning of Wednesday, July 31, 2013, after having been told in April that layoffs expected for May were &quot;on hold&quot; until the summer, nearly one third of the newsroom staff was eliminated through layoffs and voluntary resignations. The 2013 round of layoffs led to accusations by the Guild that management had misled the union by cutting more employees than had been agreed upon in the 2012 agreement, specifically by reneging on a promise to keep at least 110 union jobs in the newsroom.

This concern was heightened when, within 24 hours after the layoffs, NEOMG hired away from &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; thirteen of those who were not laid off, leaving 97 employees in the newsroom. The union filed a complaint with the NLRB which it settled in August 2014.

====2019 cuts====
&quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; announced plans to lay off a third of its remaining unionized staff in December 2018 as part of a transition to a &quot;centralized production system&quot;.

In March 2019, the paper laid off twelve (or fourteen) editors and reporters, and also outsourced its production, dropping another 24 jobs. Eight veteran reporters volunteered to take buyouts to spare others losing their jobs. Cleveland.com editor Chris Quinn blamed the parent organization&#x27;s falling revenue on the print side of the operation. &quot;It&#x27;s just the falling circulation numbers in print, they continue to hamper us&quot;, Quinn said. &quot;So we&#x27;ll—you hate to see them go, they&#x27;re veteran people, it&#x27;s a lot of experience. Nothing matters more. But if it fits for where they are in their lives, and we can save some money, we&#x27;re going for it.&quot; Rachel Dissell, a vice president of the News Guild, addressed Quinn&#x27;s remarks, saying &quot;we are baffled how print circulation can be blamed for buyouts at a digital company that we&#x27;ve been told again and again over five years is a separate entity from the Plain Dealer.&quot;

====2020 cuts====
On March 3, 2020, The Plain Dealer announced that 22 more journalists would be laid off. Their departures were delayed by two weeks, however, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to what was described as &quot;a farewell blitz of vital reporting&quot; on that topic by the soon-to-depart staff. On April 6, 2020, the Plain Dealer&#x27;s editor announced that ten of its fourteen remaining reporters would be assigned to cover Ohio counties outside of Cleveland, rather than Cuyahoga County. The ten reporters asked to be laid off instead, and on April 10, 2020, they were. This left the Plain Dealer with a staff of four union journalists: investigative journalist John Caniglia, travel editor Susan Glaser, art critic Steven Litt, and sports columnist Terry Pluto.

On May 12, 2020, it was announced that the final four union journalists would be laid off and offered positions in the non-union cleveland.com newsroom. Under an agreement with the Northeast Ohio Newspaper Guild, the guild would be barred from participating in union organizing activities in the cleveland.com newsroom for one year. The same day, after three months of serving as Plain Dealer editor and overseeing this period of layoffs, Tim Warsinskey announced that he would be starting in a new role as the senior editor for Advance Local, the parent company of cleveland.com on June 1, 2020.

These layoffs were the culmination of a drop over 20 years in membership in the United States&#x27; first News Guild (Local 1 of that union) from 340 members to zero.

==Politifact Ohio==
In July 2010, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; launched PolitiFact Ohio, a website that analyzes political issues relevant to Ohio and the greater Cleveland area. It also conducted fact-checking and was produced in conjunction with its creator, the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot;. Four years later, the relationship was ended. Although the operation had generated criticism, the decision to drop it was attributed instead to a desire to keep all content on cleveland.com rather than the separate PolitiFact Ohio site, which remains available as an archive.

==Pricing, distribution==
The copy rates are $3 for daily or $5 on Sunday/Thanksgiving Day at newsstands/newsracks. The full subscription weekly price is $4.65. These prices only apply to &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;&#x27;s home delivery area, which are the Northeast Ohio counties of Cuyahoga, Lake, Geauga, Portage, Erie, Ottawa, Summit, Ashtabula, Medina, and Lorain. &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; is available throughout the state at select newsstands including in the state capital, Columbus, and anywhere in the U.S. or world via U.S. mail service; prices are higher by mail.

==Cleveland.com criticism and controversies==
===Removal of debate video===
In October 2014, the Northeast Ohio Media Group hosted the three Ohio candidates for governor in what would be their only joint appearance. The debate was held before the NEOMG&#x27;s editorial board (which also serves as the editorial board of &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;) and NEOMG reporters. Incumbent Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, largely ignored his main rival, Democrat Ed FitzGerald. Kasich refused to admit he could hear the questions of FitzGerald, who was sitting next to him and insisted that a reporter repeat them.

During the debate, a video camera was positioned eight feet in front of the candidates. The resulting video was posted on cleveland.com. A few days later, however, it was removed. When other sites posted copies of the now-deleted video, the NEOMG sent letters threatening legal action. TechDirt reported that the owner of the Cleveland &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; had demanded that the unflattering video be taken down. The NEOMG&#x27;s actions were covered by other media organizations and it was criticized by media observers. Chris Quinn, the NEOMG vice president who sent the letters, declined all requests for comment.

At 7 a.m. on the day after the election, which Kasich who was endorsed by the NEOMG won easily, the news organization posted online an explanation of events written by its reader representative. The column cited Quinn&#x27;s explanation: 
Shortly after the video was posted, the Kasich campaign contacted him and said it had not been aware a video would be posted online. Quinn eventually decided that his failure to explicitly explain the presence of a video camera was unfair. Further, &quot;I thought that if I stated my reasons, the obvious next step would be people going to the candidates and asking them if they had any objection to putting the video back up,&quot; Quinn is quoted as saying. &quot;That would mean my error could put people into an uncomfortable situation.&quot;
The explanation left some critics unsatisfied.

===Tamir Rice coverage===

As part of NEOMG&#x27;s coverage of the 2014 shooting of Tamir Rice by Cleveland Police, NEOMG published a stories explaining that Rice&#x27;s parents had criminal backgrounds. NEOMG Vice President of Content Chris Quinn attempted to justify reporting on the criminal backgrounds of Rice&#x27;s parents in a follow-up piece, pointing out that Rice was playing with a toy gun that officers mistook for a real one at the time of the shooting. As a result, Quinn noted, many people asserted that the shooting was justified.

&quot;One of the questions these people raise is why a 12-year-old was walking about in a public place, randomly aiming what looks like a real gun in various directions, to the point where a witness called 9-1-1 in fear,&quot; Quinn wrote in a piece defending his organization&#x27;s reporting on the incident.

Quinn postulated, &quot;One way to stop police from killing any more 12-year-olds might be to understand the forces that lead children to undertake behavior that could put them in the sights of police guns.&quot; Cleveland Scene, the alternative weekly, compared Quinn&#x27;s explanation to &quot;digging himself a hole the exact width and depth of a coffin&quot; in a piece asserting that the narrative regarding Rice&#x27;s parents&#x27; criminal histories &quot;is absent any context whatsoever&quot;.

NEOMG&#x27;s handling of the situation was condemned on a national scale by the Huffington Post, as well as internally by Plain Dealer staffers.

==PD criticism and controversies==

===Political leanings===

In the presidential election of 1864, the paper was strongly opposed to the reelection of Abraham Lincoln. An editorial dated 5 November asked rhetorically, &quot;Do you want four more years of war? Vote for Lincoln. Do you want the Constitution destroyed? Vote for Lincoln... Do you want the degraded Negros made your social and political equals? Vote for Lincoln.&quot;

&quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; has been criticized in the past by liberal columnists for staking out generally conservative positions on its editorial page, despite serving a predominantly Democratic readership base. In 2004, the editorial board voted to endorse Democratic U.S. Senator John Kerry; after publisher Alex Machaskee overruled it, ordering the board to write an endorsement of Republican George W. Bush, editorial page editor Brent Larkin persuaded Machaskee to withhold any endorsement. The news coverage is generally more neutral, with national and international news often culled from wire services including &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

The paper had been criticized as being too soft in its coverage of Senator George Voinovich from Ohio. It also was criticized in the 2004 election cycle for the U.S. Senate, not providing fair coverage if any to Voinovich&#x27;s opponent, State Sen. Eric Fingerhut, a Democrat.

===Publishing concealed weapons permit holder lists===
In 2005, the newspaper twice published lists of concealed weapon permit holders from the five counties around Cleveland. Editor Doug Clifton defended the paper&#x27;s decision, sparking a feud with a pro-carry lobbyist group. State Senator Steve Austria called it abuse of the media access privilege, saying publishing these names would threaten the safety of the men and women who obtain these permits. An Ohio gun rights group then published Clifton&#x27;s home address and phone number.

===&quot;Held stories&quot; controversy===

&quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; made national headlines in summer 2005, when editor Douglas Clifton announced that the newspaper was withholding two stories &quot;of profound importance&quot; after Judith Miller of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Matthew Cooper of &quot;Time&quot; magazine were ordered to reveal confidential sources who had provided information on Valerie Plame, Joseph Wilson&#x27;s wife, being a CIA operative. Wilson was a prominent critic of the administration. The decision to compel the reporters to reveal sources was seen in the news media as a license to go after reporters and newspapers in the courtroom for not revealing confidential informants. It was considered a violation of the trust between reporter and said informants. Clifton was vilified in the news media as &quot;having no backbone&quot; and he admitted that people could refer to him as &quot;chickenshit&quot;. Clifton told the national press that while he and the reporters involved in the story were willing to be jailed for not revealing sources, the legal department of the Plain Dealer Publishing Company was worried that the newspaper itself would be sued and strongly opposed the printing of the stories. &quot;Talking isn&#x27;t an option and jail is too high a price to pay&quot;, he said.

The controversy ended a month later, when &quot;Cleveland Scene,&quot; the alternative weekly, published a similar story. &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; then printed its withheld story, a report that a federal corruption probe had targeted former Mayor Michael R. White. Both newspapers&#x27; stories were based on leaked documents. The second withheld story has not been revealed.

===Music critic sidelined===
On September 17, 2008, Donald Rosenberg, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;&#x27;s music critic of sixteen years, was told by the paper&#x27;s editor, Susan Goldberg, that he would no longer be covering performances of the Cleveland Orchestra. Rosenberg had criticized its performances under its conductor Franz Welser-Möst, although his reviews of Welser-Möst as a conductor of operas had been positive. Terrance C. Z. Egger, president and publisher of the paper, was on the orchestra&#x27;s board.

Welser-Möst had been strongly criticized during his earlier tenure at the London Philharmonic Orchestra, when London critics gave him the nickname &quot;Frankly Worse than Most&quot;. In December 2008, Rosenberg sued Cleveland&#x27;s Musical Arts Association, the newspaper and several members of their staffs, alleging a conspiracy to have him demoted. Rosenberg dropped a number of claims against the paper in 2009. In August 2009, a jury rejected the remaining claims.

===Shirley Strickland Saffold===
In March 2010, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; reported that about eighty comments had been posted to articles on its web site by an account registered to the email address of Shirley Strickland Saffold, a judge sitting on the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Several of the comments, posted under the pseudonym &quot;lawmiss&quot;, discussed matters that were or had been before the judge. Although the judge&#x27;s 23-year-old daughter Sydney Saffold took responsibility for the postings, the paper was able to use a public records request and determine that the exact times and dates of some of the postings corresponded to the times that the corresponding articles were being viewed on the judge&#x27;s court-issued computer. The revelation led one attorney, who had been criticized in the postings, to request the judge recuse herself from a homicide trial in which he represented the defendant. Ohio Supreme Court Acting Chief Justice Paul E. Pfeifer subsequently removed Saffold from the case.

In April, the judge sued the paper, its editor Susan Goldberg, and affiliated companies for $50 million claiming violation of its privacy policy. In December 2010, Saffold dropped the suit against the newspaper, and reached settlement with Advance Internet, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; affiliate which runs the newspaper&#x27;s website. The terms of the settlement were undisclosed, but included a charitable contribution in the name of Saffold&#x27;s mother.

<text>106 Dione is a large main-belt asteroid. It probably has a composition similar to 1 Ceres. It was discovered by J. C. Watson on October 10, 1868, and named after Dione, a Titaness in Greek mythology who was sometimes said to have been the mother of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty. It is listed as a member of the Hecuba group of asteroids that orbit near the 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter. The orbital period for this object is 5.66 years and it has an eccentricity of 0.17.

Measurements made with the IRAS observatory give a diameter of and a geometric albedo of . By comparison, the MIPS photometer on the Spitzer Space Telescope gives a diameter of and a geometric albedo of . Dione was observed to occult a dim star on January 19, 1983, by observers in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. A diameter of was deduced, closely matching the value acquired by the IRAS satellite. As of 2012, the mean diameter derived through occultation measurements is .

Photometric observations of this asteroid collected during 2004–2005 show a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of magnitude. It is classified as a rare G-type asteroid, suggesting it has a carbonaceous composition with phyllosilicate minerals also being detected.

<doc id="738665" wikidata="Q215113" url="?curid=738665" title="Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz">
<text>Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz (; 29 September 1904, Bremen – 16 February 1973) was a German diplomat. During World War II, he served as an attaché for Nazi Germany in occupied Denmark. He tipped off the Danes about the Germans&#x27; intended deportation of the Jewish population in 1943 and arranged for their reception in Sweden. Danish resistance groups subsequently rescued 95% of Denmark&#x27;s Jewish population. Israel has designated Duckwitz as one of the Righteous Among the Nations.

== Early life ==
Duckwitz was born on 29 September 1904 in Bremen, Germany, to an old patrician family in the Hanseatic City. After college, he began a career in the international coffee trade.

== Career ==
From 1928 to 1932 Duckwitz lived in Copenhagen, Denmark. In November 1932, he met Gregor Strasser, the leader of the leftist branch of the German nationalistic Nazi Party, in Bremen. Over the course of their conversation, Duckwitz found that &quot;elements of Scandinavian socialism [were] connected with nationalistic feelings&quot; and subsequently decided to enroll in the party. On 1 July 1933, he joined the Nazi Party&#x27;s Office of Foreign Affairs in Berlin. Over the course of his tenure, he became increasingly disillusioned by Nazi politics. In a 4 June 1935 letter to Alfred Rosenberg, the head of the office, he wrote, &quot;My two-year employment in the Reichsleitung [i.e. executive branch] of the [Nazi Party] has made me realize that I am so fundamentally deceived in the nature and purpose of the National Socialist movement that I am no longer able to work within this movement as an honest person&quot;. Around the same time, the Gestapo (secret police) made its first notes on Duckwitz after he had sheltered three Jewish women in his Kurfürstendamm apartment during a local antisemitic Sturmabteilung event. He later wrote that he had then become &quot;a fierce opponent of this [Nazi] system&quot;.

He eventually left the Office of Foreign Affairs to work for the Hamburg America Line shipping company. In 1939, he was assigned to the German embassy in Copenhagen as a maritime attaché.

=== Rescue of Jews in Denmark ===

After 1942, Duckwitz worked with the Nazi Reich representative Werner Best, who organised the Gestapo. On 11 September 1943 Best told Duckwitz about the intended roundup of all Danish Jews on 1 October. Duckwitz travelled to Berlin to attempt to stop the deportation through official channels. That failed, and he flew to Stockholm two weeks later, ostensibly to discuss the passage of German merchant ships. There, he contacted Swedish Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson and asked whether Sweden would be willing to receive Danish Jewish refugees. In a couple of days, Hansson promised them a favourable reception.

Back in Denmark on 29 September, Duckwitz contacted the Danish Social Democrat Hans Hedtoft and notified him of the intended deportation. Hedtoft warned the head of the Jewish community, C. B. Henriques, and the acting chief rabbi, Marcus Melchior, who spread the warning. Sympathetic Danes in all walks of life organized a mass escape of over 7,200 Jews and 700 of their non-Jewish relatives by sea to Sweden.
Afterward, Duckwitz went back to his official duties.

== Later life ==
After the war, Duckwitz remained in the German foreign service. In 1955 to 1958, he served as West German ambassador to Denmark and later as the ambassador to India. When Willy Brandt became Foreign Minister in 1966, he made Duckwitz Secretary of State in West Germany&#x27;s Foreign Office. After Brandt became Chancellor, he ordered Duckwitz to negotiate an agreement with the Polish government. Brandt&#x27;s work culminated in the 1970 Treaty of Warsaw. Duckwitz worked as Secretary of State until his retirement in 1970. On 21 March 1971, the Israeli government named him Righteous Among the Nations and included him in the Yad Vashem memorial. He died two years later, at 68.

==Legacy==
Duckwitz was portrayed by Patrick Malahide in the film &quot;Miracle at Midnight&quot;.

<text>The Blasters are an American rock band formed in 1979 in Downey, California, by brothers Phil Alvin (vocals and guitar) and Dave Alvin (guitar), with bass guitarist John Bazz and drummer Bill Bateman. Their self-described &quot;American Music&quot; is a blend of rockabilly, early rock and roll, punk rock, mountain music, and rhythm and blues and country.

==Band history==
===Origins and heyday (1979–1985)===
The Alvin brothers grew up in a household filled with music and parents who exposed their sons to different kinds of American music. They made friends with Bazz and Bateman, and together the boys were brave enough to go into Los Angeles blues clubs to watch their musical idols. They learned firsthand from the likes of Joe Turner and T-Bone Walker. Phil Alvin recalled how his mother would drive the boys anywhere, and around 1965 or 1966, she took Phil to see Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. At Phil&#x27;s request, Big Joe Williams introduced him to Terry, and Phil wound up taking a number of harmonica lessons from Terry. Another mentor was tenor saxophonist Lee Allen, who later joined The Blasters.

Phil Alvin explained the origin of the band&#x27;s name: &quot;I thought Joe Turner&#x27;s backup band on his Atlantic records–I had these 78s–I thought they were the Blues Blasters. That ends up it was Jimmy McCracklin. I just took the &#x27;Blues&#x27; off and Joe finally told me, that&#x27;s Jimmy McCracklin&#x27;s name, but you tell &#x27;im I gave you permission to steal it [laughs].&quot;

Gene Taylor joined after the release of &quot;American Music&quot; (1980), performing boogie woogie-style piano (he remained with the band through late 1985). Later on, Steve Berlin joined on baritone sax, forming a horn tandem with Lee Allen.

The Blasters&#x27; energetic live performances gained a local following, and they became fixtures of the early 1980s Los Angeles punk rock scene. They performed alongside X, Black Flag, The Gun Club, the Screamers and others. The L.A. scene of the time also featured the cowpunk genre, and a notable example was how The Blasters helped country artist Dwight Yoakam get established. They toured together in 1985.

Another local band that formed a strong musical bond with The Blasters was Los Lobos. The Mexican-American group first became friends with the Downey group in 1976. About five years later, The Blasters invited Los Lobos to open for them and also helped get the young men from East L.A. their first record deal. Steve Berlin made a transition to Los Lobos, with The Blasters&#x27; blessing.

The Blasters toured almost continuously for much of their heyday. The notes for &quot;The Blasters Collection&quot; observed that in one particular month, they toured with a wide range of acts: the all-girl band The Go-Go&#x27;s, psychobilly pioneers the Cramps, with western swing revivalists Asleep at the Wheel and on a leg of Queen&#x27;s west coast tour.

===Breakup and subsequent lineups (1985–2022)===
Like many other pairs of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll siblings, the Alvins got into fights with each other. In 2015, Dave also recalled that the internal tension in the band extended beyond his tumultuous relationship with Phil.

This tension came to a head on October 23, 1985, during a gig in Montreal at the Spectrum. Gene Taylor quit that night and offered his services to the opening act, the Fabulous Thunderbirds. Dave Alvin also quit, joining X for a brief stint, though he returned briefly in early 1986 amid plans to record a new album with Nick Lowe as producer. That didn&#x27;t work out, and Dave left The Blasters for good, save for occasional reunions and under other circumstances as well. Ultimately, he wanted to sing his own songs. He proceeded to launch his critically acclaimed solo career.

Phil Alvin has led various incarnations of The Blasters intermittently since then (he devoted much of his attention to graduate studies in mathematics). Hollywood Fats (birth name: Michael L. Mann) came aboard in the spring of 1986, appearing with The Blasters at Farm Aid II. Fats died in December 1986, whereupon Dave Alvin served as an emergency fill-in. In an odd twist, Fats was initially replaced as full-time lead guitarist by Billy Zoom, who had previously left X. Zoom&#x27;s stay in The Blasters was very brief. Succeeding guitarists were Smokey Hormel (1988–93), James Intveld (1993–95), and Keith Wyatt (1996-present). Dave Carroll succeeded Bill Bateman on drums in 1993 but was subsequently replaced by Jerry Angel in 1994.

There have also been a few reunion tours and live albums of the original lineup – including Dave Alvin. Along with these, examples of Dave&#x27;s return include the need that arose from the death of Hollywood Fats, as well as Phil&#x27;s knee ailment in December 2011.

In 2005, the band released its first studio CD in 20 years, &quot;4-11-44&quot;.

On July 3, 2012, the Blasters put out their most recent studio album to date, &quot;Fun On Saturday Night&quot;. The album includes a duet with Exene Cervenka of X and the Knitters, track number 2, &quot;Jackson&quot; — a cover of the 1963 song made most famous by Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash.

In advance of the album&#x27;s release, the band was touring Spain, and Phil Alvin had a near-death experience owing to an infection from an abscessed tooth. Though he had an emergency tracheotomy and flatlined twice, he recovered with his voice intact, and The Blasters have since continued to tour.

Personnel as of 2022: Phil Alvin, John Bazz, Keith Wyatt, and Bill Bateman. Bateman rejoined the band in 2008, replacing Jerry Angel.

===Timeline===
==Reception==
The Blasters have a devoted fan base and have received largely positive critical reviews, but have earned only limited mainstream success. Critic Mark Deming wrote of them, &quot;the Blasters displayed a wide-ranging musical style [and] were a supremely tight and tactful band with enough fire, smarts, and passion for two or three groups.&quot;

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; cited their strengths: &quot;tight ensemble work, swingin&#x27; original tunes in the classic mold and Phil Alvin&#x27;s ageless, confident vocals.&quot; &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; noted the ever-increasing numbers of originals written by Dave Alvin—songs about cars, girls, the working man and road dreams—and how he matured into a great songwriter.

In his memoir &quot;Get in the Van&quot; (1995), Henry Rollins of Black Flag and Rollins Band detailed his admiration the Blasters, after seeing them perform live many occasions as Black Flag and the Blasters crossed paths in southern California venues: &quot;In my mind, they were a great band that not enough people found out about. Bill Bateman is one of the best drummers there is, and then of course, there are the Alvin brothers. A lot of talent for one band.&quot;

==Music used in popular culture==
The Blasters gained exposure appearing as themselves in the Walter Hill film &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; (1984). They performed two songs, &quot;One Bad Stud&quot; and &quot;Blue Shadows&quot;.

Their song &quot;Dark Night&quot; was featured in a 1985 episode of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (Season 2 Episode 2, &quot;Whatever Works &quot;). Later, it was also used over the opening sequence of the Quentin Tarantino-Robert Rodriguez collaboration movie &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot;.

<text>William Watson (c. 23 April 15599 December 1603) was an English Roman Catholic priest and conspirator, executed for treason.

==Life==
In 1586 Watson became a Roman Catholic priest in France, and during the concluding years of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign he paid several visits to England; he was imprisoned and tortured more than once. He became prominent in the Archpriest Controversy as a champion of the secular priests in their dispute with the Jesuits, and in 1601 some writings by him on this question appeared which were answered by Robert Parsons. In September of that year he was resident at Fulham Palace, under the protection of Richard Bancroft.

When Elizabeth died, Watson hastened to Scotland to assure James I of the loyalty of his party, and to forestall the Jesuits, who were suspected of intriguing with Spain. The new king did not, however, as was hoped, cease to exact the fines on recusants; and the general dissatisfaction felt by the Roman Catholics gave rise to the &quot;Bye plot,&quot; or &quot;Watson&#x27;s plot,&quot; in which connection this priest&#x27;s name is best known, and to its sequel the Main Plot; Watson discussed the grievances of his co-religionists with another priest, William Clark, with Sir Griffin Markham and Anthony Copley, and with a disappointed Protestant courtier, George Brooke; they took another Protestant, Thomas Grey, 15th Baron Grey de Wilton, into their confidence, and following Scottish precedents it was arranged that James should be surprised and seized, while they talked loudly about capturing the Tower of London, converting the King to Catholicism, and making Watson Lord Keeper.

One or two of the conspirators drew back; but Watson and his remaining colleagues arranged to assemble at Greenwich on 24 June 1603, and under the pretence of presenting a petition to carry out their object. The plot was a complete failure; Henry Garnet and other Jesuits betrayed it to the authorities, and its principal authors were seized, Watson being captured in August at Hay-on-Wye on the Welsh border. They were tried at Winchester and found guilty; Watson and Clark were executed on 9 December 1603, and Brooke suffered the same fate a week later. Grey and Markham were reprieved.

Before the executions took place, however, the failure of the Bye plot had led to the discovery of the Main plot. Brooke&#x27;s share in the earlier scheme caused suspicion to fall upon his brother Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham, the ally and brother-in-law of Sir Robert Cecil. Cobham appears to have been in communication with Spain about the possibility of killing &quot;the king and his cubs&quot; and of placing Lady Arabella Stuart on the throne. He was seized, tried and condemned to death, but although led out to the scaffold he was not executed. It was on suspicion of being associated with Cobham in this matter that Sir Walter Raleigh was arrested and tried.

<doc id="738673" wikidata="Q5196607" url="?curid=738673" title="Sarah Biffin">
<text>Sarah Biffin (25 October 1784 – 2 October 1850), also known as Sarah Biffen, Sarah Beffin or by her married name Mrs E. M. Wright, was an English painter born with no arms and only vestigial legs. She was born in 1784 in Somerset. Despite her disability she learned to read and write, and to paint using her mouth. 

She was apprenticed to a man named Emmanuel Dukes, who exhibited her as an attraction throughout England. In the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Fair of 1808, she came to the attention of George Douglas, the Earl of Morton, who went on to sponsor her to receive lessons from a Royal Academy of Arts painter, William Craig. The Society of Arts awarded her a medal in 1821 for a historical miniature and the Royal Academy accepted her paintings. The Royal Family commissioned her to paint miniature portraits of them. 

When the Earl of Morton died in 1827, Biffin was left without a noble sponsor and she ran into financial trouble. Queen Victoria awarded her a Civil List pension and she retired to a private life in Liverpool. 

==Biography==
Sarah Biffin was born on 25 October 1784 in East Quantoxhead, Somerset to her father Henry Biffin, a shoemaker, and his wife Sarah. She was born with no arms and undeveloped legs – a result of the congenital condition phocomelia, and would grow to a height of 37 inches. Biffin lived with her parents and four siblings in a farmworker&#x27;s cottage, just outside East Quantoxhead. She learned to read and, despite her disability, later was able to write using her mouth.

When she was around the age of 13, her family apprenticed her to a man named Emmanuel Dukes, who exhibited her in fairs and sideshows throughout England. Dukes marketed her as &quot;The Eighth Wonder&quot;, who was skilled at writing and sewing with her mouth. At some point during the time, she learnt to paint holding the paint-brush in her mouth. During this period, she held exhibitions, sold her paintings and autographs, and took admission fees to let others see her sew, paint and draw. She drew landscapes or painted portrait miniatures on ivory with contemporaries praising her skill. Her miniatures were sold for three guineas each, however, Biffin may have received as little as £5 a year while she was with Dukes.
Biffin attended the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Fair of 1808, where she was depicted as a mermaid on the side of a showman&#x27;s van. There George Douglas, the Earl of Morton wanted to see if Biffin could really paint unaided, sitting in multiple sessions and taking the unfinished miniature with him so no one else could change it. Once he was convinced, he sponsored her to receive lessons from a Royal Academy of Arts painter, William Craig, and gain favour of George III. She would go on to paint for George IV, William IV and Victoria.

Some time after 1817, Biffin left Duke&#x27;s apprenticeship, and under the Earl of Morton&#x27;s sponsorship opened a studio on the Strand, London. The Society of Arts awarded her a medal in 1821 for a historical miniature and the Royal Academy accepted her paintings and travelled to Brussels with the Earl of Morton where she received commissions from the royal court. Charles Dickens mentioned her in &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;, &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;, and &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;, and in &quot;A Plated Article&quot;, when describing pottery figures spoiled in the firing process.

On 6 September 1824, she married a banker&#x27;s clerk, William Stephen Wright and paused her painting, but the relationship did not last. In spite of their separation, he took control of the money Biffin had earned and provided her with a salary of £40 each year. The Earl of Morton died in 1827. Without the support of a noble sponsor, Biffin ran into financial trouble. She returned to painting as &quot;Mrs. E. M. Wright&quot; and exhibited at the Royal Academy in the early 1830s.

Queen Victoria awarded her a Civil List pension of £12 per annum, and she travelled to Liverpool in 1841 where she would spend her final years. She set up a studio, and went back to signing her works as &quot;Miss Biffin&quot;. Her supporters in Liverpool, led by Richard Rathbone and including Jenny Lind, arranged a public subscription in 1847 to finance her for her final years.

Sarah Biffin died on 2 October 1850 at the age of 66. She is buried in St James Cemetery in Liverpool, though her gravestone no longer exists

==Legacy==
According to Mouth and Foot Painting Artists, Biffin was the first recorded British mouth painter. A self-portrait engraved by RW Sievier and published in London in June 1821 was sold at Sotheby’s in 1986 and again at Sotheby’s on 5 December 2019. The sale was of the collection of the late Dr Erika Pohl-Ströher. The auction estimate was £800–1200 but the final sale price was £137,500.

The first exhibition of Biffin’s work for 100 years &quot;Without Hands: the Art of Sarah Biffin,&quot; was held at the galleries of Philip Mould &amp; Company, London in 2022.

In February 2024, BBC news reported that the Museum of Somerset in Taunton, which holds a large collection of Sarah Biffin&#x27;s work, had acquired a self-portrait by the artist. A watercolour by Biffin dated circa 1812 is located in the Welcome Collection in Euston Station in London. Additional works can be found at the National Portrait Gallery, London.

<doc id="738677" wikidata="Q456626" url="?curid=738677" title="Alison Lapper">
<text>Alison Lapper MBE (born 7 April 1965) is a British artist. She is the subject of the sculpture Alison Lapper Pregnant, which was displayed on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square from September 2005 until late 2007. She and her late son Parys featured in the BBC docuseries &quot;Child of Our Time&quot;.

==Early life==
Alison Lapper was born on 7 April 1965 in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire. She was born without arms and with shortened legs, a condition called phocomelia. She was institutionalized in her infancy, and is still distant from her relatives. When she was fitted with artificial limbs, she felt that the aim was not to help her, but to make her look less disconcerting to others. She abandoned them, finding life far easier without external aids.

She left Chailey Heritage School, Sussex, at the age of 17, and moved to London. She then attended the Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Foundation for Disabled People, in Banstead, Surrey until the age of 19, where she learned to drive. She completed both &#x27;O&#x27; and &#x27;A&#x27;-levels in art at Sutton College of Learning for Adults, before pre-foundation and foundation courses at Heatherley School of Fine Art.

Lapper then moved to Brighton and studied in the Faculty of Art and Architecture at the University of Brighton, graduating with a first class honours degree in Fine Art in 1994.

==Career==
Lapper uses photography, digital imaging, and painting to, as she says, question physical normality and beauty, using herself as a subject. She is a member of the Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists of the World (AMFPA), having joined as a student member and receiving a full membership after her college graduation. One particular influence is the sculpture &quot;Venus de Milo&quot;, due to the physical similarities between the idealised classical female statue and Lapper&#x27;s own body. She has taken part in various British exhibitions, including in the Royal Festival Hall. In May 2003, Lapper was awarded an MBE for her services for art.

After she had given birth to her son Parys in 2000, she created an installation of photographs of herself with him. Lapper and her son featured on the BBC television documentary &quot;Child of Our Time&quot;. In 2006, she published her book &quot;My Life in My Hands&quot;.

==Marc Quinn sculpture==
Lapper was the subject of Marc Quinn&#x27;s sculpture, &quot;Alison Lapper Pregnant&quot;. Initially she refused to pose for him, unsure of the manner in which he intended to depict disability. She wanted to be sure his perspective was not one of pity.

Quinn observed that ancient statues whose limbs had fallen off were now often highly regarded. His aim was to create equally beautiful representations of bodies born naturally in that way. When he phoned again a few months later, Lapper informed him she was now seven months pregnant. His reply was, &quot;That&#x27;s even better!&quot; In November 1999, Lapper went to Quinn&#x27;s studio to have a cast made.

The sculpture is made of Carrara marble. It occupied the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square between September 2005 and late 2007. A large replica featured in the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony.

==Honours==
In May 2003, Lapper was awarded an MBE for services to art. In July 2014, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Brighton.

==Personal life==
Lapper had a son, Parys, with whom she was pregnant when posing for the Marc Quinn sculpture. He died suddenly from a suspected accidental drug overdose in August 2019, aged 19. His mother afterwards said that he had been bullied at school over her disability, which led to his being sectioned for mental health problems at the age of 17.

==Biography==
&quot;London Vénus: Une vie d&#x27;Alison Lapper&quot;, an unauthorised biography of Lapper in comic-book form, was published in France in 2022. It is written by Yaneck Chareyre and drawn by Mathieu Bertrand, and tells Lapper&#x27;s story from her birth to the funeral of Parys Lapper.

<doc id="738680" wikidata="Q6775469" url="?curid=738680" title="Martin Frankel">
<text>Martin R. &quot;Marty&quot; Frankel (born 1954) is an American financial criminal who conducted a series of investment frauds in the late 20th century, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. He was caught in 1999, and in 2004 was sentenced to 200 months in prison based on over $200 million in proven losses to insurance companies he bought then looted their actuarial reserves; the sentence was reaffirmed in 2006.

==Personal life==
Marty Frankel was born to Leon and Tilly Frankel in 1954; he was Leon&#x27;s fourth child and Tilly&#x27;s second, and was raised as Jewish. He attended the University of Toledo but never graduated.

==Career==
Frankel used astrology to make financial trading decisions. In addition, he usually could not bring himself to actually make trades, causing trouble for him with the brokerage firms he worked for. After being fired by his boss John Schulte in 1986, Schulte&#x27;s wife and brokerage partner, Sonia, left the marriage to join Frankel as his business and life partner. Frankel set up Winthrop Capital using the phony name of James Spencer. He also set up The Frankel Fund with Douglas Maxwell, but remained reluctant to buy or hold his chosen investments.

Frankel moved to Florida in 1987, and attracted Palm Beach investors, but the Frankel Fund lost money on trades, and Frankel was using shareholder accounts to pay expenses, including rent, stock-quote services, and personal spending money for himself, his sister, and his mother. By mid-1988, he was also raiding some investor&#x27;s accounts to cash out other, worried investors who were pulling out their money. He transferred the remaining funds to his personal account and told his remaining investor that the fund had collapsed due to Maxwell&#x27;s bad trades and embezzlement. Frankel gave the funds to an attorney, but the funds were then turned over to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Frankel moved back to Toledo and started a new firm, Creative Partners, while the SEC was investigating him, using the name Rothschild International Investments and a Swiss bank account to separate Creative Partners from his own name and ongoing investigation. By this time, his former boss&#x27;s wife, Sonia Schulte, was divorcing. Sonia Schulte set up a brokerage in direct competition with her husband&#x27;s and directed her clients to Creative Partners; meanwhile, Frankel set up another company, Donar Corporation, which paid for Sonia Schulte&#x27;s new house, and paid Sonia&#x27;s divorce and custody lawyers over $300,000 out of the Swiss bank account.

After paying a fine and agreeing to be barred from trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1992, Frankel used several aliases, including David Rosse.

In an attempt to use the Roman Catholic Church to discourage questions of legitimacy, Frankel founded the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation in the British Virgin Islands, with a nominal mission of investing in insurance companies in order to fund hospitals. Among people solicited to join the Foundation board was retired &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; anchorman Walter Cronkite; when he declined to join, his name was used anyway. An official of the Roman Curia, Monsignor Emilio Colagiovanni, agreed to sign a letter falsely stating that the Foundation received funding from the Vatican.

==Arrest and conviction==

Frankel fled the United States in May 1999. He went by private plane to Rome and then to Hamburg, Germany, where he was arrested on September 4. He was first tried and sentenced in Germany to three years in jail for passport fraud. He was then extradited to the U.S. in 2001.

Monsignor Colagiovanni was arrested in Cleveland, Ohio on August 30, 2001.

In May 2002, Frankel pleaded guilty to 24 federal counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, and related racketeering and conspiracy. Fifteen of Frankel&#x27;s associates, including Colagiovanni, also pleaded guilty to related crimes; Sonia Schulte pleaded guilty to money laundering and racketeering. By the time Frankel was first sentenced in December 2004, sixteen of his accomplices had been convicted. Frankel told the judge that most of his behavior was to earn enough money to provide for Sonia Schulte (by then Sonia Howe) and her two children; after this, the judge asked &quot;So, you stole $209 million in order to take care of the children?&quot; Frankel then explained that he could not end the scheme without it coming apart, and asked the judge to consider that deterrence should not be a factor in his sentencing because &quot;If somebody is mentally ill, you shouldn&#x27;t punish them because it won&#x27;t stop other mentally ill people from doing it.&quot; Frankel was sentenced to 200 months (16 years 8 months) in federal prison; a state court in Tennessee also sentenced Frankel to 16 years, which was allowed to run concurrently on the condition that he assist officials in recovering lost assets looted from his Tennessee insurance companies.

Per the Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator, Frankel (inmate number 14142-014) was released on October 27, 2016, after serving roughly 12 years of his 17-year sentence. Frankel was initially released from prison to a halfway house in Massachusetts in 2015, but was returned to prison for an additional 6 months for violations of the rules at the halfway house. He was then released to a halfway house in Hartford, CT only to once again be ordered to serve 6 more months for violations at that halfway house. He was then released to a reentry facility in Brooklyn.

Several states put Frankel&#x27;s insurance companies into receivership when it was discovered the companies&#x27; primary assets were investments in Frankel&#x27;s own shell company; among the states affected were Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia.
